See \"Use of Proceeds\" and \"Capitalization.\" 3 THE COMPANY Manhattan provides information technology solutions for distribution centers that are designed to enable the efficient movement of goods through the supply chain. The Company's solutions are designed to optimize the receipt, storage and distribution of inventory and the management of equipment and personnel within a distribution center, and to meet the increasingly complex information requirements of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. The Company's solutions consist of software, including PkMS, a comprehensive and modular software system; services, including design, configuration, implementation, training and support; and hardware. The Company's objective is to be the leading provider of information technology solutions to distribution centers by enhancing its core product functionality, targeting new vertical markets and expanding its sales and marketing organization. The Company believes that organizations that have implemented the PkMS system experience improved control and efficiency over distribution center operations, improved information flow, and increased efficiency in managing distribution center personnel and equipment. In order to remain competitive in a changing retail landscape, many retailers have demanded that manufacturers and distributors employ industry initiatives such as \"Quick Response,\" which use technology to improve the flow of information among manufacturers, distributors and retailers. As a result of these retailer demands, distribution centers have increased in size, complexity and cost. The efficient management of a distribution center operation now requires collecting information regarding customer orders, inbound shipments of products, products available on-site, product storage locations, weights and sizes, and outbound shipping data (including customer- or store-specific shipping requirements, routing data and carrier requirements). This information must be analyzed dynamically to determine the most efficient use of the distribution center's labor, materials handling equipment, packaging equipment and shipping and receiving areas. Additionally, manufacturers, distributors and retailers must exchange information with other participants in the supply chain in order to effectively integrate the operation of their distribution centers with the entire supply chain. PkMS allows organizations to manage the receiving, stock locating, stock picking, order verification, order packing and shipment of products in complex distribution centers. PkMS is designed to optimize the operation of a distribution center by increasing inventory turnover, improving inventory accuracy, reducing response times, reducing inventory levels, improving customer service and increasing the productivity of labor, facilities and materials handling equipment. In addition, through its recent acquisition of Performance Analysis Corporation (\"PAC\"), the Company offers slotting functionality, which helps determine the optimal storage location for inventory within a distribution center. The Company currently provides solutions to manufacturers, distributors and retailers primarily in the apparel, consumer products, food service and grocery markets. As of December 31, 1997, PkMS was licensed for use by more than 250 customers including Calvin Klein, Dean Foods, Jockey International, Mikasa, Nordstrom, Patagonia, Playtex Apparel, SEIKO Corporation of America, The Sports Authority, Timberland and Warnaco. The Company is a Georgia corporation formed to own all of the assets and liabilities of Manhattan Associates Software, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (\"Manhattan LLC\"). Manhattan LLC was formed in 1995 by the contribution of the assets, liabilities and intellectual property rights of Pegasys Systems Incorporated (\"Pegasys\") and the contribution of certain intellectual property rights from the other founders of Manhattan LLC. Pegasys is controlled by Alan J. Dabbiere, the Company's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. After the Restructuring, Pegasys, and Mr. Dabbiere through his control of Pegasys, will be a controlling stockholder of the Company. See \"Principal and Selling Stockholders.\" Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Prospectus to \"Manhattan\" or the \"Company\" refer to Manhattan Associates, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiary, PAC, acquired on February 16, 1998. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway, Suite 700, Atlanta, Georgia 30339 and its telephone number is (770) 955-7070. 4 RISK FACTORS An investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the Common Stock offered by this Prospectus. When used in this Prospectus, the words \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those risks discussed below and elsewhere in this Prospectus. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Prospectus. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY. The Company was founded and shipped its first version of PkMS in 1990. The Company and its operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Although the Company has experienced significant growth during the past five years, the Company does not believe that prior growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase its level of revenue or maintain profitability in the future. Increases in operating expenses are expected to continue and, together with pricing pressures, may result in a decrease in operating income and operating margin percentage. The Company's limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible. Future operating results will depend on many factors, including, without limitation, the degree and rate of growth of the markets in which the Company competes and the accompanying demand for the Company's software products, the level of product and price competition, the ability of the Company to establish strategic marketing relationships and develop and market new and enhanced products and to control costs, the ability of the Company to expand its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels both domestically and internationally, the ability of the Company to integrate acquired businesses, and the ability of the Company to attract, train and retain consulting, technical and other key personnel. See \"Selected Financial Data\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" POTENTIAL VARIABILITY OF QUARTERLY OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. The Company's operations and related revenue and operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Among the factors causing these potential variations are fluctuations in the demand for the Company's products, the level of product and price competition in the Company's markets, the length of the Company's sales process, the size and timing of individual transactions, the mix of products and services sold, delays in, or cancellations of, customer implementations, the Company's success in expanding its services and customer support organizations as well as its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels, the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by the Company or its competitors, commercial strategies adopted by competitors, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customers' budget constraints, the Company's ability to control costs and general economic conditions. A substantial portion of the Company's operating expenses, particularly personnel and facilities costs, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, any delay in the recognition of revenue may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter. In addition, an increase or decrease in hardware sales, which provide the Company with lower gross margins than sales of software licenses or services, may contribute to the variability of the Company's operating results in any particular quarter. As a result of the foregoing factors, the Company's operating results for a future quarter may be above or below the expectations of public market analysts 5 and investors. Should the Company's revenue and operating results fall below expectations, the price of the Company's Common Stock would be materially adversely affected. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" DEPENDENCE ON SINGLE PRODUCT. The Company currently derives substantially all of its revenue from sales of its PkMS software and related services and hardware. The Company expects to continue to focus on distribution center management systems as its primary line of business, and any factor adversely affecting the market for distribution center management systems in general, or the Company's products in particular, could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company's future financial performance will depend in large part on the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of PkMS. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in marketing PkMS or any new or enhanced versions of PkMS. The market for distribution center management systems is intensely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. The Company's future success will depend on continued growth in the market for distribution center management systems. There can be no assurance that the market for distribution center management systems will continue to grow. If this market fails to grow or grows more slowly than the Company currently anticipates, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" \"Business--Strategy\" and \"--Products and Services.\" ABILITY TO MANAGE GROWTH. The Company has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations and anticipates that significant expansion will continue to be required in order to address potential market opportunities. The Company anticipates significantly increasing the size of its sales, support, services, marketing and research and development operations following the completion of the Offering. There can be no assurance that such expansion will be successfully completed or that it will generate sufficient revenue to cover the Company's expenses. The Company has only recently begun the process of developing the management and operational capabilities and financial and accounting systems and controls necessary to support anticipated growth. For example, the Company hired its current Chief Financial Officer, Michael J. Casey, in November 1997. The Company did not previously have a Chief Financial Officer. In January 1998, the Company upgraded certain of its management information and accounting systems and the Company will need to continue to upgrade these and other systems to accommodate its expanding operations. There can be no assurance that the Company's expanded management information and accounting systems will be sufficient to support the Company's continued growth, if any. Similarly, the Company hired its Executive Vice President-- Sales and Marketing, Gregory Cronin, in December 1997, and he is responsible for expanding the Company's sales and marketing operations. The ability of the Company to manage its growth, if any, will depend in large part on its ability to build effective management information and accounting systems, to generally improve and expand its operational and sales and marketing capabilities, to develop the management skills of its managers and supervisors, and to train, motivate and manage both its existing employees and the additional employees that will be required if the Company is to achieve its business objectives. There can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in developing all or any of these capabilities, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Business--Strategy,\" \"--Sales and Marketing\" and \"Management.\" NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM; DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. The Company's future success will depend to a significant extent on its Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and 6 President, Alan J. Dabbiere, as well as the Company's other executive officers and technical, managerial and marketing personnel. A significant portion of the Company's senior management team has been in place for only a relatively short period of time. Oliver M. Cooper, Michael J. Casey, Gregory Cronin, Neil Thall, and David K. Dabbiere, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President--Sales and Marketing, Vice President--Supply Chain Strategy and Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, respectively, joined the Company full-time in August 1997, November 1997, December 1997, January 1998 and March 1998, respectively. Accordingly, each of these individuals has been involved with only the most recent operating activity of the Company. The Company's success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of its new executive officers to integrate themselves into the Company's daily operations, to gain the trust and confidence of the Company's other employees and to work effectively as a team. The loss of the services of any of the Company's executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any of these individuals or any other key employee will not voluntarily terminate his employment with the Company. The Company does not maintain key man life insurance on any of its executive officers. The failure of the Company to maintain key man life insurance on its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation. The Company believes that its future success will also depend significantly on its ability to attract, motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical, managerial, consulting, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting, motivating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate profitably. Failure to attract, motivate and retain such highly skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Business-- Employees\" and \"Management.\" LIMITED PREDICTABILITY OF SALES DUE TO LENGTH OF SALES PROCESS. The sale of PkMS generally requires the Company to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the product. Implementation of the Company's products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers and is commonly associated with substantial integration efforts which must be performed by the Company and/or the customer. For these and other reasons, the length of time between the date of initial contact with the potential customer and execution of a software license agreement typically ranges from three to six months, and is subject to delays over which the Company may have little or no control. In addition, as the average dollar size of the sale of the Company's products and services increases, the Company expects the sales cycle to lengthen as a result of a more time-consuming approval process typically required by its potential customers. The Company's implementation cycle could also be lengthened by increases in the size and complexity of its implementations. In addition, the Company will need to continue hiring qualified personnel to complete such installations. The failure of the Company to attract and retain such personnel or the delay in, or cancellation of, sales or implementations of PkMS could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the Company's operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business--Sales and Marketing.\" DEPENDENCE ON HARDWARE REVENUE. In conjunction with the licensing of PkMS, the Company resells a variety of hardware products, developed and manufactured by third parties, in order to provide the Company's customers with an integrated distribution center management solution. Revenue from such hardware sales can amount to a significant portion of the Company's total revenue in any period. As the market for the distribution of hardware products becomes more competitive, the Company's customers may choose to purchase such 7 hardware directly from the manufacturers or distributors of such products, with a resultant decrease to the Company in such ancillary revenue and related contribution to income. Hardware sales revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased in 1996 and 1997 and, as a result, the Company's profitability is increasingly dependent upon growth in its software licenses and services revenue. The failure of the Company to maintain or increase hardware revenues may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business--Products and Services.\" IMMIGRATION ISSUES. The Company believes that its success in part has resulted from its ability to attract and retain persons with technical and project management skills, some of whom are citizens of other countries, principally India. Many of the Company's employees are employed by the Company pursuant to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") H-1(B), non-immigrant work-permitted visa classification. There is a limit on the number of new H-1(B) petitions that the INS may approve in any year, and in years in which this limit is reached, the Company may be unable to obtain H-1(B) visas necessary to bring additional foreign employees to the U.S. Compliance with existing U.S. immigration laws, or changes in such laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting the ability of the Company to retain H-1(B) employees in the U.S., could require the Company to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses. Any such restrictions or limitations on the Company's hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Congress and administrative agencies with jurisdiction over immigration matters have periodically expressed concerns over the levels of immigration into the United States. These concerns have often resulted in proposed legislation, rules and regulations aimed at reducing the number of employment-based visas and permanent resident visas that may be issued. Any changes in such laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting the ability of the Company to retain foreign employees could require the Company to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or result in the Company having insufficient qualified personnel to carry on the business of the Company. The Company's Chief Technology Officer, Deepak Raghavan, is presently employed pursuant to an H-1(B) non-immigrant work-permitted visa that may be extended only through April 30, 2000. Mr. Raghavan's application for an EB-3 permanent immigrant visa is currently subject to a processing backlog which may or may not be alleviated in time for his EB-3 permanent immigrant visa to be issued before April 30, 2000. In the event that Mr. Raghavan's permanent work permit is not issued prior to such date, he may be required to leave the United States. In February 1998, Mr. Raghavan made a cash investment in the Company which allows him to qualify for an EB-5 permanent immigrant investor visa which may be granted sooner than the EB-3 permanent immigrant visa under his current application. While Mr. Raghavan has applied for the immigrant investor visa and the Company expects that such visa will be issued prior to April 30, 2000, there can be no assurance that any visa permitting Mr. Raghavan to remain in the United States will be issued prior to such date. In the event Mr. Raghavan is required to leave the United States, the Company's software development efforts, and thus its business, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially adversely affected. See \"Business-- Employees,\" \"Management\" and \"Certain Transactions.\" COMPETITION. The market for the Company's products is intensely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. The Company's competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain, as well as the enterprise as a whole. The Company's existing competitors include distribution center management software vendors, the corporate information technology departments of potential 8 customers capable of internally developing solutions, and smaller independent companies that have developed or are attempting to develop distribution center management software that competes with the Company's software solution. The Company may face competition in the future from business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of, distribution center management software, and Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") and Supply Chain Management (\"SCM\") applications vendors. To the extent such ERP and SCM vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable or superior to the Company's products, their significant installed customer bases, long-standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a significant competitive advantage over the Company. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. Many of the Company's competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than the Company. In order to be successful in the future, the Company must continue to respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors' innovations. There can be no assurance that current or potential competitors of the Company will not develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by the Company. In addition, no assurance can be given that the Company will not be required to make substantial additional investments in connection with its research, development, marketing, sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat, or that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition will result in reductions in market share, pressure for price reductions and related reductions in gross margins, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve its financial and business goals. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors. See \"Business--Competition.\" RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RECENT ACQUISITION AND POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS. The Company has recently completed the PAC Acquisition and may in the future engage in selective acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to those of the Company, including other providers of distribution center management solutions or technology. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisition or successfully integrate any acquired business (including the PAC business) into the Company's operations. Further, acquisitions may involve a number of special risks, including diversion of management's attention, failure to retain key acquired personnel, unanticipated events or circumstances, legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Problems with an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Company as a whole. The Company expects to finance any future acquisitions with the proceeds of the Offering as well as with possible debt financing, the issuance of equity securities (common or preferred stock) or combinations of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms. If the Company were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consisted of cash, a substantial portion of the Company's available cash (possibly a portion of the proceeds of the Offering) could be used to consummate the acquisitions. If the Company were to consummate one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration consisted of stock, shareholders of the Company could suffer dilution of their interests in the Company. Many business acquisitions must be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Most of the businesses that might become attractive acquisition candidates for the Company are likely to 9 have significant intangible assets, and acquisition of these businesses, if accounted for as a purchase, would typically result in substantial goodwill amortization charges to the Company, reducing future earnings. In addition, such acquisitions could involve acquisition-related charges, such as one-time acquired research and development charges. For example, the Company intends, in the first quarter of 1998, to record an acquired research and development expense of approximately $2.1 million in connection with the PAC Acquisition. See \"Business--Strategy,\" \"--Recent Developments\" and Financial Statements. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIRECT CHANNELS; POTENTIAL FOR CHANNEL CONFLICT. Although the Company has historically focused its efforts on marketing through its direct sales force, the Company is increasing resources dedicated to developing indirect marketing channels such as systems integrators. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of systems integrators to market successfully the Company's PkMS product. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's potential systems integrators will not develop, acquire or market products competitive with the Company's PkMS product. In addition, sales of PkMS through its indirect channels are also likely to reduce the Company's gross profits from its consulting services as the Company's third party systems integrators provide these services. Selling through indirect channels may limit the Company's contact with its customers. As a result, the Company's ability to accurately forecast sales, evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered. The Company's strategy of marketing its PkMS product directly to customers and indirectly through systems integrators may result in distribution channel conflicts. The Company's direct sales efforts may compete with those of its indirect channels and, to the extent different systems integrators target the same customers, systems integrators may also come into conflict with each other. As the Company strives to expand its indirect distribution channels, there can be no assurance that emerging channel conflicts will not have a material adverse effect on its relationships with potential systems integrators or adversely affect its ability to attract new systems integrators. See \"Business-- Strategy\" and \"--Sales and Marketing.\" RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. Revenue outside of North America has not been significant to date; however, a key element of the Company's strategy is to increase its international sales. The Company expects to face competition from foreign distribution center management system providers in their respective native countries. To successfully expand international sales, the Company will need to recruit and retain international systems integrators. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain or increase international sales of its products or that the Company's international distribution channels will be able to adequately market, service and support the Company's products. International operations generally are subject to certain risks, including dependence on independent resellers, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements, variability of foreign economic conditions and changing restrictions imposed by United States export laws. Additional risks inherent in the Company's international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, costs of localizing products for foreign countries, lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in managing international operations, difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws. Currently, the Company does not operate sales offices outside of the United States. The Company intends to establish international sales offices, and such operations will be subject to certain additional risks, including difficulties in staffing and managing such operations and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings. There can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's future international sales and, consequently, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 To date, all of the Company's sales have been made in United States dollars and the Company has not engaged in any hedging transactions through the purchase of derivative securities or otherwise. However, should the Company's revenue from international sales increase as intended, and should such sales be denominated in foreign currencies, the failure of the Company to adopt an adequate hedging strategy to guard against foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" \"Business--Strategy\" and \"-- Sales and Marketing.\" CONCENTRATION OF CONTROL. Upon completion of the Offering, the Company's directors, officers and their affiliates will beneficially own approximately 83.3% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock. In particular, Alan J. Dabbiere, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, will beneficially own approximately 46.9% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders will have the ability to elect the Company's directors and to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company. See \"Management\" and \"Principal and Selling Stockholders.\" RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES; NECESSITY OF DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS. The market for distribution center management systems is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete. As a result, the Company's position in this market could be eroded rapidly by unforeseen changes in customer requirements for application features, functions and technologies. The Company's growth and future operating results will depend in part upon its ability to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications that meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, that meet changing customer requirements, that respond to competitive products and that achieve market acceptance. Although the Company is presently developing a client/server version of its PkMS product, there can be no assurance that this product will be completed to meet potential customer demands, if any, on a timely basis. The Company's product development and testing efforts have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial investments by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to possess sufficient resources to make necessary investments in technology. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's products will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance, or that the Company's current or future products will conform to industry standards in the markets they serve. If the Company is unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See \"Business--Product Development.\" POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS. Many of the Company's installations involve products that are critical to the operations of its clients' businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. Any failure in a client's system could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Company's responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts to limit contractually its liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions, there can be no assurance the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect the Company from liability for damages. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. 11 The successful assertion of one or more large claims against the Company that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in the Company's insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. CONVERSION FROM LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (\"LLC\") STATUS AND UTILIZATION OF SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE OFFERING PROCEEDS TO SATISFY INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS TO CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. Manhattan LLC was formed by the contribution of the assets, liabilities and intellectual property rights of Pegasys and the contribution of certain intellectual property rights from the other founders of Manhattan LLC. Manhattan LLC has operated as an LLC, taxable as a partnership under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and generally taxable as a partnership under comparable provisions of state income tax laws. An LLC which is taxable as a partnership generally is not subject to income tax at the entity level. Instead, an LLC's taxable income generally passes through to its owners and is taxed to such owners as personal income. Historically, Manhattan LLC has distributed its earnings to its owners as the Company's working capital needs permitted. Since the Company's working capital needs are anticipated to be satisfied for at least the next twelve months by the proceeds of this Offering, prior to this Offering Manhattan LLC will disburse its accumulated undistributed earnings to its owners. As of the date of this Prospectus, the assets and liabilities of Manhattan LLC will be contributed to the Company in exchange for Common Stock of the Company in a transaction intended to be non-taxable under Section 351 of the Code (the \"Restructuring\"). Manhattan LLC will then distribute the Common Stock of the Company received to its stockholders as of the date of this Prospectus and Manhattan LLC will subsequently be dissolved. Purchasers of the Common Stock in the Offering will not receive any portion of the Common Stock distributed to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC in connection with the Restructuring. After the Restructuring, the Company will be taxable for federal and state income tax purposes as a \"C\" corporation. Manhattan LLC has entered into a line of credit for working capital purposes and to fund the disbursement of the undistributed earnings to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC that will be made prior to the completion of the Offering. Prior to the Offering, this distribution will cause the Company to sustain, on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 1997, a working capital deficit of $3.6 million and stockholders' deficit of $585,000. The Company will use a portion of the proceeds of the Offering to fund the repayment of all outstanding amounts under its line of credit, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $8,000,000. The Company will also use a portion of the proceeds of the Offering to repay all outstanding indebtedness under a note to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the balance of which was $1,937,000 (including accrued interest) as of February 28, 1998. The Company does not anticipate incurring any additional borrowings under the note to the Company's Chief Executive Officer prior to completion of the Offering. There can be no assurance that the remaining net proceeds of the Offering will be sufficient to pay for future acquisitions, planned research and development projects and other growth-oriented activities, which could require the Company to incur additional debt or other financing that could impose restrictive covenants and other terms having a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Purchasers of Common Stock in the Offering will not receive any portion of the distributions to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC prior to the Restructuring. See \"Conversion from Limited Liability Company Status and Related Distributions,\" \"Use of Proceeds,\" \"Certain Transactions\" and Notes 1 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The Company relies on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, service mark and trade dress laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its products and technology. There can be no assurance, however, that the confidentiality agreements on which the Company relies to protect 12 its trade secrets and proprietary technology will be adequate. Further, the Company may be subject to additional risks as it enters into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced. Legal protections of the Company's rights may be ineffective in such countries. Litigation to defend and enforce the Company's intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation. Despite the Company's efforts to safeguard and maintain its proprietary rights both in the United States and abroad, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so, or that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of the Company's technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using the Company's products or technology. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. As the number of supply chain management applications in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, software development companies like the Company may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against the Company in the future with respect to current or future products. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, diversion of management's attention and cause product shipment delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse determinations in such claims or litigation could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Business--Proprietary Rights.\" BROAD MANAGEMENT DISCRETION AS TO USE OF PROCEEDS. A substantial portion of the net proceeds to be received by the Company in connection with the Offering is allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, management will have broad discretion with respect to the expenditure of such proceeds. Purchasers of shares of Common Stock offered hereby will be entrusting their funds to the Company's management, upon whose judgment they must depend, with limited information concerning the specific working capital requirements and general corporate purposes to which the funds will ultimately be applied. See \"Use of Proceeds.\" CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS. The Board of Directors has authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of the preferred stock without further vote or action by the Company's stockholders. The rights of the holders of the Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of a preferred stock that may be issued in the future. While the Company has no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock, such issuance, while providing desired flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the Company. In addition, the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may discourage proposals or bids to acquire the Company. These provisions could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company. See \"Description of Capital Stock--Certain Articles of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions.\" 13 SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock in the public market following the Offering could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock prevailing from time to time. The number of shares of Common Stock available for sale in the public market is limited by restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and lock-up agreements executed by officers, directors, optionholders and all stockholders of the Company under which such security holders have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their shares for a period of 180 days after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. In addition to the 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby (assuming no exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option), there will be 20,206,674 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this Prospectus, all of which are \"restricted\" shares under the Securities Act. As a result of the lock-up agreements described above and the provisions of Rules 144(k), 144 and 701 promulgated under the Securities Act (\"Rule 144(k),\" \"Rule 144\" and \"Rule 701,\" respectively), the restricted shares will be available for sale in the public market as follows: (i) no shares will be eligible for immediate sale on the date of this Prospectus, (ii) approximately 19,870,008 shares will become eligible for sale 180 days after the date of this Prospectus (assuming no release from the lock-up agreements) upon expiration of lock-up agreements and (iii) approximately 336,666 shares will become eligible for sale in February 1999. In addition, the Company intends to register for offer and sale under the Securities Act 5,729,784 shares of Common Stock issued or issuable under the Company's stock option plans and other stock options. See \"Shares Eligible for Future Sale\" and \"Underwriting.\" NO PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK; POSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE. Prior to the Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. Although the Company has made application for the quotation of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be sustained after the Offering. In the event that the Company fails to appoint two independent Directors within 90 days after the Offering, Nasdaq could terminate the listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market, which would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and trading price of the Common Stock. The initial public offering price of the Common Stock offered hereby will be determined by negotiation between the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters and may bear no relationship to the market price of the Common Stock after the Offering. The market price of the Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors. In addition, the securities markets and, in particular the high technology stock market sector, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. See \"Underwriting.\" DILUTION. The purchasers of the Common Stock offered hereby will experience immediate and significant dilution in the pro forma net tangible book value of the Common Stock from the initial pubic offering price. See \"Dilution.\" YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. Many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field. Beginning in the year 2000, these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty-first century dates from twentieth century dates. As a result, over the next two years, computer systems and/or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such \"Year 2000\" requirements. Significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance. The latest versions of the Company's products are designed to be Year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the process of determining 14 the extent to which its earlier software products as implemented in the Company's installed customer base are Year 2000 compliant, as well as the impact of any non-compliance on the Company and its customers. The Company does not currently believe that the effects of any Year 2000 non-compliance in the Company's installed base of software will result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. However, the Company's investigation is in its preliminary stages, and no assurance can be given that the Company will not be exposed to potential claims resulting from system problems associated with the century change. There can also be no assurance that the Company's software products that are designed to be Year 2000 compliant contain all necessary date code changes. The Company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues in a variety of ways. Many companies are expending significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance. These expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the Company. Potential customers may also choose to defer purchasing Year 2000 compliant products until they believe it is absolutely necessary, thus potentially resulting in stalled market sales within the industry. Conversely, Year 2000 issues may cause other companies to accelerate purchases, thereby causing an increase in short-term demand and a consequent decrease in long-term demand for software products. Additionally, Year 2000 issues could cause a significant number of companies, including current Company customers, to reevaluate their current software needs and as a result switch to other systems or suppliers. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 CONVERSION FROM LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY STATUS AND RELATED DISTRIBUTIONS Manhattan LLC was formed by the contribution of the assets, liabilities and intellectual property rights of Pegasys and the contribution of certain intellectual property rights of the other founders of Manhattan LLC. Manhattan LLC has operated as a limited liability company (\"LLC\") taxable as a partnership under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and comparable provisions of state income tax laws. An LLC which is taxable as a partnership under the Code is generally not subject to income tax at the entity level. Instead, an LLC's taxable income generally passes through to its owners and is taxed to such owners as personal income. Historically, Manhattan LLC has distributed its earnings to its owners as the Company's working capital needs permitted. Since the Company's working capital needs are anticipated to be satisfied for at least the next twelve months by the proceeds of this Offering, prior to this Offering Manhattan LLC will disburse its accumulated earnings to its owners. As of the date of this Prospectus, the assets and liabilities of Manhattan LLC will be contributed to the Company in exchange for Common Stock of the Company. Manhattan LLC will then distribute the Common Stock of the Company received to its stockholders as of the date of this Prospectus and Manhattan LLC will subsequently be dissolved. After the Restructuring, the Company will be taxable for federal and state income tax purposes as a \"C\" corporation. The transfer of assets and liabilities to Manhattan LLC as part of the Restructuring is intended to qualify as a tax-free transfer under Section 351 of the Code, pursuant to which the Company will not recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. Purchasers of the Common Stock in the Offering will not receive any portion of the Common Stock distributed to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC in connection with the Restructuring. Prior to the completion of the Offering, the Company intends to distribute all undistributed earnings, calculated on a tax basis, to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC. As of December 31, 1997, the undistributed earnings, calculated on a tax basis, of the Company was $8.7 million and the Company expects to accumulate additional undistributed earnings from January 1, 1998 through the date of the Restructuring. These distributions will be funded through a series of payments from available Company cash and from the proceeds of a line of credit the Company has established. It is anticipated that any such advances or balance on the line of credit incurred to fund these distributions will be repaid using a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering. Purchasers of the Common Stock in the Offering will not receive any portion of the distributions to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC prior to the Restructuring. See \"Risk Factors--Conversion from Limited Liability Company (\"LLC\") Status and Utilization of Significant Portion of the Offering Proceeds to Satisfy Indebtedness Incurred to Fund Distributions to Current Stockholders\" and \"Use of Proceeds.\" 16 USE OF PROCEEDS The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $44.4 million, assuming an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and estimated expenses payable by the Company in connection with the Offering. From the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company will repay any amounts outstanding under its line of credit. The line of credit provides for the Company to borrow, subject to certain conditions, up to $8,000,000, secured by certain of the assets of the Company, at an interest rate of the commercial lender's prime rate plus one-half percent per year. As of March 31, 1998, the Company had no advances outstanding under this line of credit. This line of credit, in part, will be used to fund the LLC Distribution and to make additional distributions to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC based on income earned from January 1, 1998 through the date of the Restructuring. See \"Risk Factors--Conversion from Limited Liability Company (\"LLC\") Status and Utilization of Significant Portion of the Offering Proceeds to Satisfy Indebtedness Incurred to Fund Distributions to Current Stockholders,\" \"Conversion from Limited Liability Company Status and Related Distributions\" and \"Certain Transactions.\" In addition, the Company will use a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay a Grid Promissory Note (the \"1995 Note\") payable to its Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Alan J. Dabbiere. The 1995 Note is payable on demand and bears interest at a rate of 5% per year. As of February 28, 1998, the balance of the 1995 Note (including accrued interest) was $1,937,000. The remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Such purposes may include the funding of new product development efforts and possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. The Company has no specific agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions or investments. The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly and are subject to change at the Company's discretion depending upon certain factors, including economic or industry conditions, changes in the competitive environment and strategic opportunities that may arise. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of the Offering in interest-bearing securities. See \"Risk Factors--Broad Management Discretion as to Use of Proceeds\" and \"Business--Strategy.\" DIVIDEND POLICY The Company historically has made distributions to its stockholders related to its limited liability company status and the resulting tax payment obligations imposed on its stockholders. Other than the distributions to be made as described under \"Conversion from Limited Liability Company Status and Related Distributions,\" the Company does not intend to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Management anticipates that all earnings and other cash resources of the Company, if any, will be retained by the Company for investment in its business. The Company is prevented by its line of credit agreement from paying cash dividends without the consent of its commercial lender. 17 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth at December 31, 1997, the short-term obligations and capitalization of the Company on an actual, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted basis. This table should be read in conjunction with the Company's Financial Statements and the Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Prospectus.\n\nDECEMBER 31, 1997 --------------------------------- PRO FORMA AS ACTUAL PRO FORMA(1) ADJUSTED(2) ------ ------------ ------------ (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA) Note payable to stockholder, current portion. $1,019 $1,019 $ -- ====== ====== ======= Stockholders' equity: Preferred stock, no par value; 20,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding actual, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted......................... -- -- -- Common stock, $.01 par value; 100,000,000 shares authorized actual, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted, 20,000,008 shares issued and outstanding, actual, 20,206,674 shares issued and outstanding, pro forma; 23,706,674 shares issued and outstanding, pro forma as adjusted(3).................. 200 202 237 Additional paid-in capital................. 1,459 3,524 47,859 Retained earnings.......................... 7,458 (3,648) (3,648) Deferred compensation......................

See \"Use of Proceeds.\" (3) Excludes (i) 3,355,716 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding at February 28, 1998 under the LLC Option Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $4.66 per share, (ii) 729,784 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding at February 28, 1998 issued outside of the LLC Option Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $1.20 per share, and (iii) 1,644,284 reserved for future issuance under the Company's Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\"). See \"Management-Stock Option Plans\" and Note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements. 18 DILUTION As of December 31, 1997, the net tangible book value of the Company was approximately $8.3 million, or $0.42 per share of Common Stock. The pro forma net tangible book deficit as of December 31, 1997 was approximately $1.5 million or $0.08 per share. Pro forma net tangible book value (deficit) per share represents the amount of the Company's total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the PAC Acquisition, the Stockholder Investment, the establishment of the deferred tax assets in connection with the Recapitalization and the payments of the LLC Distribution. After giving effect to the sale by the Company of the 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby at an assumed initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and the application of the estimated net proceeds therefrom after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, the pro forma net tangible book value of the Company at December 31, 1997 would have been approximately $42.9 million, or $1.81 per share of Common Stock. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $1.89 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of $12.19 per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this unaudited per share dilution to new investors:\n\nAssumed initial public offering price per share.............. $14.00 Net book value per share as of December 31, 1997........... $ 0.42 Decrease per share attributable to pro forma adjustments...

See \"Risk Factors--Dilution,\" \"Management\" and \"Principal and Selling Stockholders.\" The calculation of net tangible book value and the other computations above assume no exercise of outstanding options. The Company has options outstanding at February 28, 1998 to acquire 4,085,500 shares at exercise prices ranging from $0.24 to $10.00 per share and a weighted average exercise price of $4.02 per share. The exercise of these options will have the effect of increasing the net tangible book value dilution of new investors in the Offering. 19 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) The selected financial data of the Company set forth below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company, including the Notes thereto, and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included elsewhere herein.

Certain statements in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of these and other business risks, see \"Risk Factors.\" OVERVIEW Manhattan provides information technology solutions for distribution centers that are designed to enable the efficient movement of goods through the supply chain. The Company's solutions are designed to optimize the receipt, storage and distribution of inventory and the management of equipment and personnel within a distribution center, and to meet the increasingly complex information requirements of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. The Company's solutions consist of software, including PkMS, a comprehensive and modular software system; services, including design, configuration, implementation, training and support; and hardware. The Company currently provides solutions to manufacturers, distributors and retailers primarily in the apparel, consumer products, food service and grocery markets. The Company's revenue consists of revenue from the licensing of PkMS; fees for consulting, implementation, training and maintenance services; and revenue from the resale of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment. In recent years, the Company has experienced an increase in services revenue and a decrease in hardware revenue as a percentage of total revenue. Services revenue generally provides the Company with greater profit margins than hardware revenue. The change in the composition of the Company's total revenue has resulted in an increase in the Company's gross margin resulting in increased net income. The Company recognizes software license revenue in accordance with the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. 91-1, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION. Accordingly, software license revenue is recognized upon shipment of the software following execution of a contract, provided that no significant vendor obligations remain outstanding, amounts are due within one year, and collection is considered probable by management. If significant post-delivery obligations exist, the software license revenue, as well as other components of the contract, are recognized using contract accounting. The Company's services revenue consists of revenue generated from services and maintenance related to the Company's software solutions. Services revenue is derived from fees based on consulting, implementation and training services contracted under separate service agreements. Revenue related to consulting, implementation and training services performed by the Company are recognized as the services are performed. Maintenance revenue represents amounts paid, generally in advance, by users for the support and enhancements to the software. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, typically 12 months. Hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products, developed and manufactured by third parties, that are integrated with and complementary to the Company's software solution. As part of a complete distribution center management solution, the Company's customers frequently purchase hardware from the Company in 21 conjunction with the licensing of PkMS. These products include computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals. Hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment. The Company generally purchases hardware from its vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a result, the Company does not maintain hardware inventory in any significant amounts. As a result of the election to report as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, the Company has not been subject to federal and state income taxes. Pro forma net income amounts discussed herein include additional provisions for income taxes on a pro forma basis as if the Company were liable for federal and state income taxes as a taxable corporate entity throughout the years presented. The pro forma tax provision is calculated by applying the Company's statutory tax rate to pretax income, adjusted for permanent tax differences. The Company's status as a limited liability company will terminate immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Offering and the Company will thereafter be taxed as a business corporation. On February 16, 1998, the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock of Performance Analysis Corporation (\"PAC\") for approximately $2.2 million in cash and 106,666 shares of the Company's Common Stock valued at $10.00 per share. PAC is a developer of distribution center slotting software. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price of approximately $3.3 million has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including acquired research and development of approximately $2.1 million, purchased software of $500,000, and other intangible assets of $300,000. Purchased software will be amortized over an estimated two-year useful life and other intangible assets will be amortized over a seven-year period. In connection with the PAC Acquisition, the Company will record a charge to income of $2.1 million in the first quarter of 1998 for acquired research and development. The pro forma effects of the acquisition of PAC have been included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Prospectus. PAC is currently in the process of developing a Windows-NT version of its existing product, SLOT-IT. In addition, the Company plans to focus development efforts on integrating the SLOT-IT application into a future product. The Company determined the value of the acquired research and development of approximately $2.1 million based on the estimated costs to reproduce the efforts that PAC incurred to begin the development of the Windows NT version of SLOT-IT. This amount was considered acquired research and development as the Company intends to focus its efforts on completing the development and integrating the SLOT-IT Windows NT version into its future client/server product. The Company currently estimates the cost to complete the development of the Windows NT version of SLOT-IT and to fully integrate the product into PkMS to range from approximately $500,000 to $1,000,000. The Company expects to complete development and to begin to benefit from the acquired project in the last half of 1999. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully complete these projects or that such products, if completed, will achieve market acceptance. If such projects are unsuccessful, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected. The financial results referred to herein reflect the historical results of the Company. The results have not been adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect the acquisition of PAC. In addition, on February 16, 1998, the Company received an investment of $1.0 million by Deepak Raghavan, the Chief Technology Officer and a Director of the Company. This investment provided the Company with additional working capital. In exchange for his investment, Mr. Raghavan received 100,000 shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 22 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the years indicated:\n\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------- 1995 1996 1997 ------- ------- ------- STATEMENT OF INCOME DATA: Revenue: Software license.................................... 22.0% 23.3% 22.1% Services............................................ 31.2 43.3 44.4 Hardware............................................ 46.8 33.4 33.5 ------- ------- ------- Total revenue...................................... 100.0 100.0 100.0 ------- ------- ------- Cost of revenue: Software license.................................... -- 1.2 1.4 Services............................................ 15.5 14.1 18.9 Hardware............................................ 35.6 25.9 24.7 ------- ------- ------- Total cost of revenue.............................. 51.1 41.2 45.0 ------- ------- ------- Gross margin......................................... 48.9 58.8 55.0 Operating expenses: Research and development............................ 10.1 8.6 9.3 Sales and marketing................................. 10.2 13.2 11.0 General and administrative.......................... 9.4 10.1 9.2 ------- ------- ------- Total operating expenses........................... 29.7 31.9 29.5 ------- ------- ------- Income from operations............................... 19.2 26.9 25.5 Other income, net.................................... 0.3 0.7 0.2 ------- ------- ------- Income before pro forma income taxes................. 19.5 27.6 25.7 Pro forma income taxes.............................. 7.2 10.3 9.3 ------- ------- ------- Pro forma net income................................. 12.3% 17.3% 16.4% ======= ======= =======\n\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996 REVENUE Total revenue increased 125.4% to $32.5 million in 1997 from $14.4 million in 1996. Total revenue consists of software license revenue, revenue derived from consulting, maintenance and other services and revenue from the sale of hardware. Software License. Software license revenue increased 113.5% to $7.2 million in 1997 from $3.4 million in 1996. The increase in revenue from software licenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of licenses of the Company's PkMS product and an increase in the average price of software licenses. The increase in the average price of software licenses is primarily due to increased product functionality and market acceptance of PkMS. Services. Services revenue increased 131.1% to $14.4 million in 1997 from $6.2 million in 1996. The increase in revenue from services was principally due to the increased demand for these services resulting from the increased demand for the Company's PkMS product. Hardware. Hardware revenue increased 126.3% to $10.9 million in 1997 from $4.8 million in 1996. The increase in revenue from hardware was principally due to the increased demand for the Company's PkMS product. 23 Cost of Revenue COST OF SOFTWARE LICENSE. Cost of software license revenue consists of the costs of software reproduction and delivery, media, packaging, documentation and other related costs and the amortization of capitalized software. Cost of software license revenue increased to $461,000, or 6.4% of software license revenue, in 1997 from $177,000, or 5.3% of software license revenue, in 1996. As a percentage of software license revenue, cost of software license revenue remained relatively constant in 1997 as compared to 1996. COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of consultant salaries and other personnel-related expenses incurred in system implementation projects and software support services. Cost of services revenue increased to $6.2 million, or 42.7% of services revenue, in 1997 from $2.0 million, or 32.5% of services revenue, in 1996. The increase in cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue is principally due to an increase in services personnel, which resulted in an initial increase in non-billable time incurred for training of these new personnel. COST OF HARDWARE. Cost of hardware revenue increased to $8.0 million, or 73.5% of hardware revenue, in 1997 from $3.7 million, or 77.6% of hardware revenue, in 1996. The decrease in the cost of hardware as a percentage of hardware revenue is principally due to an increase in sales of hardware products with higher gross margins as compared to the prior year. Operating Expenses RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses principally consist of salaries and other personnel-related costs for personnel involved in the Company's product development efforts. The Company's research and development expenses increased by 144.7% to $3.0 million in 1997, or 9.3% of total revenue, from $1.2 million in 1996, or 8.6% of total revenue. The increase in research and development expenses resulted from the addition of research and development personnel in 1997. Significant product development efforts include the continued development of PkMS and the development of a client/server version of PkMS. The Company believes that a continued commitment to product development will be required for the Company to remain competitive and expects the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase in the near future. SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, commissions and other personnel-related costs, travel expenses, advertising programs and other promotional activities. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 87.9% to $3.6 million in 1997, or 11.0% of total revenue, from $1.9 million in 1996, or 13.2% of total revenue. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was the result of additional sales and marketing personnel, an increase in sales commissions and expanded marketing program activities. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs of executive and financial personnel, as well as facilities, legal, insurance, accounting and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 104.6% to $3.0 million in 1997, or 9.2% of total revenue, from $1.5 million in 1996, or 10.1% of total revenue. The increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to increased staffing and other administrative expenses necessary to support the Company's growth. Income Taxes PRO FORMA PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The pro forma provision for income taxes was $3.0 million in 1997, as compared to $1.5 million in 1996, as a result of the Company's substantially increased income in 1997. 24 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1995 REVENUE Total revenue increased 28.3% to $14.4 million in 1996 from $11.2 million in 1995. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue from services and an increase i"
