        "text": "Manhattan Associates, Inc. today launched Manhattan Active™ Omni Solution, a first of its kind omni-channel-as-a-service platform for enterprises that must respond swiftly to the rapidly changing demands of the digital consumer. The solution was announced at Manhattan’s annual Momentum customer conference in Las Vegas.\n\nManhattan is the first to fuse order management and store fulfillment applications with next-generation, point of sale and clienteling applications on a single platform that is cloud native, versionless and fully extensible — setting the standard for next-generation sales, service and fulfillment technology.\n\n“Manhattan Associates has spent the last decade deploying market-leading omni-channel applications for many of the world’s leading brands and retailers. Our customers have told us they love our capabilities, but they must adapt more quickly to market demands,” said Brian Kinsella, Manhattan’s vice president of product management. “Our new Manhattan Active Omni Solution platform enables customers to stay current with our latest and greatest capabilities, while also giving them full flexibility to embed their own custom enhancements.”\n\nThe Manhattan Active Omni platform also includes the debut of Manhattan’s Adaptive Network Fulfillment (ANF), an optimization process designed to maximize customer profitability on every direct order. By blending discrete operational costs, such as parcel and fulfillment expense, with operational data, like historical store fulfillment rate, workload balancing and click-to-deliver implications, ANF develops a multifactorial fulfillment plan for each order. Additionally, ANF considers selling price, sell through and predictive markdowns to ensure maximum margin contribution from owned inventory.\n\nDebuting as part of the omni-channel-as-a-service platform, Manhattan Active Store Solution is a next-generation, integrated solution for store associates. Manhattan Active Store blends Manhattan’s Point of Sale, Clienteling, Store Fulfillment and Store Inventory capabilities with a common, responsive user interface (UI) that operates the same on Windows, Android and iOS operating systems and across any mix of fixed touch screen and mobile devices. The solution is designed to fully personalize selling and best-in-class service for retailers, while simultaneously enabling high-velocity fulfillment of digital sales directly from the store."
