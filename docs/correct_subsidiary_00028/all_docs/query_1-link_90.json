In the Merger, Sealed Air shareholders will receive one share of New Sealed Air Common Stock for each share of Sealed Air common stock, par value $.01 per share, held immediately prior to the Merger. On a fully-diluted basis and immeditely after the Merger, former Grace shareholders will own, in the aggregate, approximately 63% of the equity of New Sealed Air and former Sealed Air shareholders will own the remaining 37%.

(b) Each Newco Common Share and each Newco Convert- ible Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and out- standing and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

From and -4- after the Effective Time until the end of the six-month period following the Effective Time, Newco shall make available or cause to be made available to an exchange agent appointed prior to the Effective Time with the approval of each of Grace and Sealed Air (the \"Exchange Agent\") Newco Certificates in amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of Newco Certificates that are requested by holders of Old Sealed Air Certificates in exchange for Old Sealed Air Certifi- cates pursuant to this Article IV. In its discretion, Newco may elect to evidence ownership of Newco Common Shares through a book-entry transfer agent, in which case the Exchange Agent shall deliver, upon compliance by a former Sealed Air share- holder with the provisions of Section 4.2(b), a book-entry ac- count statement evidencing the ownership of Newco Common Shares (or, at the request of a former Sealed Air shareholder, a Newco Certificate evidencing such ownership). In the event Newco so elects, references herein to Newco Certificates shall be deemed to include references to the book-entry account statements re- lating to the ownership of Newco Common Shares. (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effec- tive Time, Newco shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or de- liver to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Sealed Air Common Shares a letter of transmittal (the terms of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the par- ties hereto prior to the Effective Time) containing instruc- tions for use by holders of Sealed Air Common Shares who may, in their discretion, desire to surrender their Old Sealed Air Certificates in exchange for Newco Certificates pursuant to this Article IV. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Old Sealed Air Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accor- dance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Old Sealed Air Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Newco Certificate representing the Newco Common Shares and the Old Sealed Air Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any Newco Certificate is to be is- sued in a name other than that in which the Old Sealed Air Cer- tificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the person request- ing such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes re- quired by reason of the issuance of such in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Sealed Air Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Newco that any such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Six months after the Effective Time, Newco shall be entitled to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any applicable Newco Certificates made available to the Exchange Agent that are un- claimed by the former shareholders of Sealed Air. Any such former shareholders who have not theretofore exchanged their -5- Old Sealed Air Certificates for Newco Certificates pursuant to this Article IV who desires to do so shall thereafter be en- titled to look exclusively to Newco and only as general credi- tors thereof to obtain Newco Certificates to which they become entitled upon exchange of their Old Sealed Air Certificates pursuant to this Article IV. Newco shall pay all applicable charges and expenses in connection with the exchange of Newco Certificates for Old Sealed Air Certificates as contemplated hereby. (c) No Transfers. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Sealed Air Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. (d) No Liability. If any Old Sealed Air Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certifi- cate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Newco, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Newco may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Sealed Air Certifi- cate, Newco shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or de- stroyed Old Sealed Air Certificates, issue or cause to be is- sued the Newco Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pur- suant to this Article IV. No party hereto, nor the Exchange Agent, shall be liable to any holder of former Sealed Air Com- mon Shares for any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (e) Withholding Rights. Newco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of former Sealed Air Common Shares such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the former Sealed Air Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. (f) Sealed Air Contingent Stock and Restricted Stock Plans. The Sealed Air Stock Plans shall be amended in accor- dance with their terms and applicable law, with the effect that as of the Effective Time, among other things, (i) all of the rights and obligations of Sealed Air under the Sealed Air Stock Plans, including with respect to awards outstanding at the Ef- fective Time, shall be rights and obligations of Newco follow- ing the Effective Time and (ii) each unexercised right granted -6- under the Sealed Air Stock Plans to purchase a Sealed Air Com- mon Share shall constitute a right to purchase a Newco Common Share in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ap- plicable Sealed Air Stock Plans, as amended from time to time.

Except as set forth above, except for Grace Common Shares issued after August 1, 1997 pur- suant to the terms of options, securities or plans re- ferred to above and except in connection with the Transac- tion Agreements, there are no shares of capital stock of Grace authorized, issued or outstanding and there are no preemptive rights or any outstanding subscriptions, op- tions, puts, calls, warrants, rights, convertible or ex- changeable securities or other agreements or commitments of Grace or any of its subsidiaries of any character re- lating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of Grace or any of its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the issuance, sale, purchase, redemp- tion, conversion, exchange, redemption, voting or transfer thereof). The Newco Common Shares to be issued in the Recapitalization and the Merger or upon exercise of the Grace Options after the Recapitalization and the Newco Preferred Shares to be issued in the Recapitalization will, upon such issuance, be duly authorized, fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable. (ii) Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the \"Merger Sub Com- mon Stock\").

Merger Sub was formed for the purpose of effecting the Merger and has no other business activity. (b) Corporate Organization and Qualification. Each of Grace and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and is in good standing (if recognized in such jurisdiction, or, if not, duly qualified) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the business conducted, by it or its subsidiaries require such qualification, except for any such failure so to qualify or be in good standing which, when taken together with all other such failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Grace. Each of Grace and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority and all mate- rial governmental licenses and approvals to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. Grace has made available to Sealed Air a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Grace and Merger Sub, each as amended to date and currently in full force and effect. (c) Corporate Authority. Subject only to the re- ceipt of the requisite approval of its shareholders neces- sary to consummate the Reorganization, each of Grace, Merger Sub and each other subsidiary of Grace that is or will be a party to a Transaction Agreement has the requi- site corporate power and authority and has taken all cor- porate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, the approval of the Grace Board and the resolution of the Grace Board to recommend, subject to their fiduciary duties, the trans- actions contemplated hereby and thereby for approval by Grace shareholders. Each Transaction Agreement to which Grace, Merger Sub or any of Grace's subsidiaries is a party is, or when executed and delivered shall be, a valid and binding agreement of such person enforceable in ac- cordance with its terms. The affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Grace Common Shares in favor of the Merger and related transactions (including the amendments to the Grace Certificate of In- corporation) and the Distribution are the only votes of the holders of Grace's capital stock necessary in connec- tion with the consummation of the Reorganization. -9- (d) Governmental Filings; No Violations.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance by Grace or any Grace subsidiary of each Transaction Agree- ment to which it is a party does not or will not, and the consummation by it of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, constitute or result in (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable governing instruments, or (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under, or an acceleration or termination of or change in the rights or obligations of any party under, or the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on any assets pursuant to, any provision of any agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation or commitment (\"Con- tracts\") of it or any of its subsidiaries or any law, rule, ordinance or regulation or judgment, decree, order, award or governmental or non-governmental permit or li- cense to which it or any of its subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for such breach- es, violations, defaults, accelerations or changes that are disclosed in the Grace Disclosure Letter or, individu- ally or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the New Grace Group or the Packco Group or prevent or materially delay or enable any person to enjoin consummation of the Reorganization. -10- (e) SEC Documents; Financial Statements; No Undis- closed Liabilities.

As of the Effective Time, the number of Sealed Air Common Shares outstanding (including any awards pursuant to the Sealed Air Stock Plans) shall not exceed the number outstanding as of August 14, 1997, except to the extent that such excess is reflected in an adjustment to the Per Share Common Consideration (as defined in the Distribution Agreement) as provided in the definition thereof. (b) Corporate Organization and Qualification. Each of Sealed Air and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its or such subsidiary's jurisdiction of organiza- tion and is in good standing (if recognized in such juris- diction, or, if not, duly qualified) as a foreign corpo- ration in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the business conducted, by it or such subsidiary require such qualification, except for any such failure so to qualify or be in good standing which, when taken together with all other such failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air. Each of Sealed Air and its subsid- iaries has the requisite corporate power and authority and all material governmental licenses and approvals to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. Sealed Air has made available to the other parties hereto a com- plete and correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, each as amended to date and currently in full force and effect. (c) Corporate Authority. Subject only to the re- ceipt of the requisite approval of its shareholders to consummate the Merger, Sealed Air has the requisite cor- porate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and there- by, including, without limitation, the approval of the -24- Sealed Air Board and the resolution of the Sealed Air Board to recommend, subject to their fiduciary duties, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for approval by Sealed Air shareholders. Each Transaction Agreement to which Sealed Air is a party is, or when executed and de- livered shall be, a valid and binding agreement of Sealed Air enforceable in accordance with its terms. The affir- mative vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding Sealed Air Common Shares in favor of the Merger is the only vote of the holders of Sealed Air's capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merg- er. (d) Governmental Filings; No Violations. (i) Other than as may be required under the HSR Act and similar statutes in other countries, the Exchange Act, the Securi- ties Act, and state securities laws, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries with, nor are any consents, regis- trations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by it or any such subsidiary from, any Govern- mental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of each Transaction Agreement to which Sealed Air is a party and the consummation by Sealed Air of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, ex- cept for such matters as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air or prevent or materially delay or enable any person to enjoin consummation of the transactions contem- plated hereby and thereby. (ii) The execution, delivery and performance by Sealed Air of each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party does not or will not, and the consummation by it of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, constitute or result in (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under, or an acceleration or termination of or change in the rights or obligations of any party under, or the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on any assets pursuant to, any provision of any Contracts of it or any of its subsidiaries or any law, rule, ordinance or regulation or judgment, decree, order, award or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which it or any of its subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for such breach- es, violations, defaults, accelerations or changes that are disclosed in the Sealed Air Disclosure Letter or, -25- individually and in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air or prevent or materially delay or enable any person to enjoin consummation of the Reorganization. (e) SEC Documents; Financial Statements; No Undis- closed Liabilities. (i) Sealed Air has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since December 31, 1994. As of its filing date, each such SEC Document filed, and each SEC Document that will be filed by Sealed Air or its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (A) complied or will comply in all material respects with the applicable re- quirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act and (B) did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mis- leading. Each of Sealed Air's consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into its SEC Documents fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of it and its subsidiaries as of the dates set forth therein, and each of the con- solidated statements of earnings, cash flows and share- holders' equity included in or incorporated by reference into its SEC Documents (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and share- holders' equity, as the case may be, of Sealed Air and its subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with US GAAP (applied on a consistent basis). (ii) Except as disclosed in its SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, neither Sealed Air nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air.

Except as disclosed in its SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Sealed Air and its subsidiaries have complied with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable thereto, except where the failure to comply is not reasonably likely, individually and in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air. Sealed Air and its subsidiaries have, and, immediately after the Merger, will have, all permits, li- censes, certificates of authority, orders, and approvals of, and has and will have made all filings, applications, and registrations with, federal, state, local, and foreign Governmental Entities that are required in order to permit it or such subsidiary to carry on its business as it is presently conducted, except for such permits, licenses, certificates, orders, filings, applications and registra- tions, the failure to have or make which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Ma- terial Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air.

Except as disclosed in Sealed Air's SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of its executive officers, threatened, or inves- tigations pending, against Sealed Air or any of its sub- sidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, are rea- sonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with re- spect to Sealed Air. There are no judgments or outstand- ing orders, writs, injunctions, decrees, stipulations or awards (whether rendered or issued by a court or Govern- mental Entity, or by arbitration) against Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or businesses, which are reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air.

(k) Contracts and Commitments. Except as set forth in the Sealed Air Disclosure Letter, and except for mat- ters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air, (i) Sealed Air and its subsidiaries will not, as of the -28- Effective Time, be parties to or bound by any Contract that materially limits the ability of Grace after the Merger, Packco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any person or in any geographic area; (ii) neither Sealed Air nor any of its subsidiaries is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect under any Con- tract that is material to the operation of Sealed Air; (iii) none of the other parties to any Contract that is material to the operation of Sealed Air is (with or with- out the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect thereunder; and (iv) neither Sealed Air nor any of its subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of any party to terminate any such Contract whether as a termination for convenience or for default of Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries thereunder. (l) Employee Benefits. (i) The Sealed Air Disclo- sure Letter includes a complete list of all material em- ployee benefit plans, programs, policies, practices and other arrangements (regardless of whether they are funded or unfunded or foreign or domestic, but excluding any such plans, programs, policies, practices and arrangements man- dated or sponsored by a Governmental Entity with respect to foreign employees) providing benefits to any current or former employee of Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Sealed Air Employees\") or beneficiary or dependent thereof, sponsored or maintained by Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries, or to which Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to con- tribute (the \"Sealed Air Plans\"); provided, that such list may not be complete as of the date hereof as to Sealed Air Plans providing benefits to foreign Sealed Air Employees, but such list shall be updated so as to be complete as to such Sealed Air Plans promptly following the date hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term \"Sealed Air Plans\" includes all employee welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA and all employee pension benefit plans within the meaning of Sec- tion 3(2) of ERISA. (ii) With respect to each Sealed Air Plan providing benefits to U.S. Sealed Air Employees, Sealed Air has de- livered or made available to Grace, and with respect to each Sealed Air Plan providing benefits to foreign Sealed Air Employees, promptly following the date hereof, Sealed Air will deliver or make available to Grace, a true, cor- rect and complete copy of each of the following: (A) all -29- plan documents, (B) all benefit schedules, trust agree- ments and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, and the current summary plan descriptions (if any); (C) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and ac- companying schedule, if any, or any similar filing made with any foreign authority; (D) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (E) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (F) the most recent determination let- ter from the IRS or similar document issued by any other taxing authority, if any.

(iii) The Sealed Air Disclosure Letter identifies each Sealed Air Plan that is intended to be a \"qualified plan\" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (\"Sealed Air Qualified Plans\"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Sealed Air Qual- ified Plan, in each case that has not been revoked, or application for such a letter has been or will be filed before the expiration of the remedial amendment period, and Sealed Air knows of no existing circumstances nor any events that have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such plan or the related trust. No Sealed Air Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. (iv) Sealed Air and its subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other laws and regulations applicable to the Sealed Air Plans. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to any Sealed Air Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of Sealed Air under ERISA or the Code. No prohibited transaction (as defined in ERISA) has oc- curred with respect to any Sealed Air Plan. (v) All contributions required to be made to any Sealed Air Plan by applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Sealed Air Plan, have been timely made or paid in full.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Sealed Air Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan, nor has Sealed Air or any ERISA Affiliate of Sealed Air, at any time since September 2, 1974, con- tributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multi- employer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could re- sult in, any liability under (A) Title IV of ERISA, (B) Section 302 of ERISA, (C) Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (D) the continuation coverage requirements of Sec- tion 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, or (E) corresponding or similar provisions of foreign laws or regulations, that would be a liability of Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the Sealed Air Plans. (vii) Neither Sealed Air nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Sealed Air Plan. (viii) All Sealed Air Plans covering foreign Sealed Air Employees comply with applicable local law, except when the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggre- gate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air. (ix) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contem- plated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any Sealed Air Employee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable in connection with the transactions contem- plated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an \"excess parachute payment\" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Sealed Air and its subsidiaries have not entered into any change-of-control agreements under which Sealed Air will be obligated to make change-of-control payments following the Merger. (m) Environmental Matters. Except as disclosed in its SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and ex- cept for such matters that, individually and in the ag- gregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Ad- verse Effect with respect to Sealed Air, (i) Sealed Air and its subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with -31- all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) Sealed Air and its subsidiaries hold and have held all permits under any En- vironmental Law required for the operation of their re- spective businesses as presently conducted and are in com- pliance with the terms of such permits; and (iii) neither Sealed Air nor any of its subsidiaries has received any outstanding written notices, demand letters, claims or re- quests for information, nor has any complaint been filed, penalty assessed, nor is any investigation, action, claim, suit, proceeding or review pending (with respect to which Sealed Air has been provided notice), or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of Sealed Air, threatened by any Governmental Entity or any third party that assert that Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries may be in violation of, or liable under, any Environmental Law (including as an indemnitor in connection with any threatened or as- serted claim by any third party indemnitee), and none of Sealed Air, its subsidiaries or its properties is subject to any citation, court order, administrative order or de- cree arising under any Environmental Law. None of the real property owned or leased by Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries is listed on, or, to the knowledge of Sealed Air's executive officers, proposed for listing on the \"Na- tional Priorities List\" under CERCLA, or any similar state, local or foreign list of sites requiring inves- tigation or cleanup. (n) Takeover Statutes; Rights Plans. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and consumma- tion of the transactions contemplated hereby will not cause to be applicable to Sealed Air any Takeover Statute (after giving effect to any actions that will be taken prior to the Effective Time). Sealed Air does not have any preferred share purchase rights plan or similar rights plan in effect. (o) Brokers and Finders. Neither Sealed Air nor any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commis- sions or finders' fees in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except pursuant to arrangements dis- closed in writing to the other parties hereto prior to the date hereof. (p) Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights. Sealed Air and its subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other rights to use all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, licenses and product licenses or registrations (including applications for any of the -32- foregoing), technology, know-how, tangible or intangible proprietary intellectual property rights, information or material (whether conceived, reduced to practice or under development), formulae, inventions and new and investiga- tional applications (including all options or rights to acquire any of the foregoing) as are necessary, used or held for use in connection with its business (the \"Sealed Air Intellectual Property\"), the lack of which would rea- sonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air. None of Sealed Air or any of its subsidiaries has received any adverse claim by any other person with respect to the Sealed Air Intellectual Prop- erty or is aware, to the knowledge of the executive offic- ers of Sealed Air and its subsidiaries, of any infringe- ment with respect thereto, and there is no infringement by Sealed Air or its subsidiaries of the intellectual prop- erty rights of others, which, in each case, would, indi- vidually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air. Except for matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sealed Air, immediately after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will own or possess ad- equate licenses or other rights to use (on substantially the same basis as currently owned or possessed by Sealed Air and its subsidiaries) all of the Sealed Air Intel- lectual Property. (q) Tax Matters. At the Effective Time, the repre- sentations set forth in the Tax Matters Certificates of Sealed Air, substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the \"Sealed Air Tax Matters Certificate\"), will be true and correct in all respects, and such representations are hereby incorporated herein by reference with the same ef- fect as if set forth herein in their entirety. (r) Disclosure. The representations and warranties of Sealed Air contained in this Agreement or in any writ- ten instrument, exhibit or certificate furnished or to be furnished by Sealed Air to Grace pursuant hereto or in connection herewith do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not mis- leading. -33- ARTICLE VI COVENANTS SECTION 6.1.
