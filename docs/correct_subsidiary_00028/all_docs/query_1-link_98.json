        "text": "ATLANTA, Oct. 23, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Leading supply chain solutions provider Manhattan Associates, Inc. (Nasdaq:MANH), today reported record third quarter 2007 revenue and earnings and raised its Earnings Per Share (EPS) guidance for the year. Manhattan Associates' third quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29, a 53% increase over the third quarter of 2006 on revenue of $84.6 million, a 17% increase. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.34, a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2006.\n\nThird Quarter Financial Highlights\n\nSummarized highlights of the 2007 third quarter results, as compared to the 2006 third quarter, follow.\n\n* Consolidated revenue increased 17% to $84.6 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue increased 16%. -- License revenue totaled $17.3 million, an increase of 14%. -- Services revenue totaled $58.4 million, increasing 14%. * GAAP Operating income increased 25% to $10.6 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, GAAP operating income increased 32%; * Operating income, on a non-GAAP basis, increased 10% to $12.7 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased 15%. * GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 53% to $0.29. * Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $0.34 per share. * Appreciation of the Rupee (the company has a major research and development center in India) and other currency changes negatively impacted GAAP and adjusted operating income by $0.6 million or $0.01 per share. The negative $0.01 impact of currency changes on operating results was offset by $0.02 of foreign exchange gains in Other Income. The combined net impact of currency appreciation and foreign exchange gains in the quarter for GAAP and Adjusted EPS results was an increase of $0.01 per diluted share. * Cash Flow from Operations was $6.4 million, with Days Sales Outstanding of 80 days. * Cash and Investments on Hand at September 30, 2007 was $82.0 million. * The Company repurchased 809,680 common shares totaling $22.2 million at an average share price of $27.37 in the quarter. * The Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of Manhattan Associates' outstanding common stock. The Board of Directors also appointed two additional members: Pete Kight, Chairman and CEO of CheckFree Corporation, a leading provider of financial e-commerce solutions; and Dan Lautenbach, a 30-year veteran of technology solution companies, primarily IBM, where he ran global software sales.\n\nYear-To-Date Financial Highlights\n\nSummarized highlights of the first nine months of 2007, as compared to the first nine months of 2006, follow.\n\n* Consolidated revenue increased 19% to $252.4 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue increased 17%. -- License revenue was $54.5 million, increasing 15%. -- Services revenue totaled $169.1 million, a 17% increase. * GAAP operating income increased 41% to $31.5 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, GAAP operating income increased 45%. * On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased 16% to $37.3 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased 19%. * GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 54% to $0.80. * Adjusted diluted earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, increased 21% to $0.94. * Appreciation of the Rupee and other currency changes negatively impacted GAAP and adjusted operating income by $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share. The negative $1.0 million impact of currency changes on operating results was partially offset by $0.3 million of foreign exchange gains in Other Income. The combined net impact of currency appreciation and foreign exchange gains on year-to-date GAAP and Adjusted EPS results was a reduction of $0.02 per diluted share.\n\n\"The third quarter of 2007 marks our 12th consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth,\" said Pete Sinisgalli, President and CEO. \"Each of our three regions contributed to our solid license revenue growth and was profitable in the quarter. Importantly, more than half of our third quarter license revenue came from new customers as we continue to capture market share from competitors. Moreover, our forecast for the fourth quarter is strong. Therefore, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range by 2 cents on the low end and by 3 cents on the high end to a revised range of $1.29 to $1.34,\" he added.\n\nSignificant sales-related achievements during the quarter follow.\n\n* New customers such as: 3 Suisses; ASICS America Corporation; Barnes Distribution; Bed, Bath & Beyond; Blackhawk Products Group; Citi Trends, Inc.; Domaxel; Dalepak Limited; Elecon; Electronics for Imaging, Inc.; ElektroKomplektServis; Fitness Quest, Inc.; Gloria Jeans; H E Butt Grocery (HEB); Jefferson Smurfit Corporation; Lamps Plus, Inc.; National Freight, Inc.; Nelson Education Limited; Nestle Nespresso SA; Nor-Cal Beverage Co., Inc.; Northern Safety Co., Inc.; Orchard Brands, Inc. (aka Blair Corp); Performance Warehouse; Reckitt Benckiser, Inc; Restoration Hardware; Safeway, Inc.; Target Corporation; The Apparel Group; and The Tire Rack, Inc. * Expanding partnerships with existing customers such as: Always; Argos Limited; Fruit of the Loom Limited; Tesco Stores Limited; and US Foodservice. * Closing four large contracts, each of which generated $1 million or more in recognized license revenue.\n\n2007 Guidance\n\nManhattan Associates provided the following diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2007. The GAAP diluted earnings per share includes the impact of stock options expense under SFAS 123(R). A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is included in the supplemental attachments to this release.\n\nFully Diluted EPS -------------------------------- Per Share range % Growth range -------------- -------------- GAAP Earnings Per Share ----------------------- Q4 2007 - diluted earnings per share $0.30 $0.35 76% 106% Full year 2007 - diluted earnings per share $1.09 $1.14 58% 65% Adjusted Earnings Per Share --------------------------- Q4 2007 - diluted earnings per share $0.35 $0.40 13% 29% Full year 2007 - diluted earnings per share $1.29 $1.34 19% 24%\n\nManhattan Associates currently intends to publish, in each quarterly earnings release, certain expectations with respect to future financial performance. These statements are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially, especially in the current uncertain economic environment. These statements do not reflect the potential impact of mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations that may be completed after the date of this release.\n\nManhattan Associates will make its earnings release and published expectations available on its Web site (www.manh.com). Beginning December 15, 2007, Manhattan Associates will observe a \"Quiet Period\" during which Manhattan Associates and its representatives will not comment concerning previously published financial expectations. Prior to the start of the Quiet Period, the public can continue to rely on the expectations published in this 2007 Guidance section as still being Manhattan Associates' current expectation on matters covered, unless Manhattan Associates publishes a notice stating otherwise. During the Quiet Period, previously published expectations should be considered historical only, speaking only as of or prior to the Quiet Period, and Manhattan Associates disclaims any obligation to update any previously published financial expectations during the Quiet Period. The Quiet Period will extend until the date when Manhattan Associates' next quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for the first week of February 2008.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company's conference call regarding its third quarter financial results will be held at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, October 23, 2007 after the market closes. Investors are invited to listen to a live Web cast of the conference call through the investor relations section of Manhattan Associates' Web site.

The phone replay will be available for two weeks after the call, and the Internet broadcast will be archived at Manhattan Associates' Web site.\n\nGAAP Versus Non-GAAP Presentation\n\nThe Company provides adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share in this press release as additional information regarding the Company's operating results. The measures are not in accordance with -- or an alternative for -- GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share measures used by other companies. The Company believes that this presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share facilitates investors' understanding of our historical operating trends, because it provides important supplemental measurement information in evaluating the operating results of our business, as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results, and thus provide investors with useful insight into our profitability exclusive of unusual adjustments. This release should be read in conjunction with our Form 8-K earnings release filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.\n\nThe non-GAAP adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share exclude the impact of acquisition related costs and the amortization thereof, the recapture of previously recognized sales tax expense and stock option expense under SFAS 123(R). A reconciliation of our GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP adjustments is included in the supplemental attachment to this release.\n\nThe Company also provides revenue, GAAP and adjusted operating income, and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. This information is not in accordance with -- or an alternative for -- GAAP, and may be different from measures used by other companies. The Company believes that this information allows a more meaningful comparison of the Company's performance from period to period.\n\nAbout Manhattan Associates, Inc.\n\nManhattan Associates(r) provides global supply chain solutions to organizations that consider supply chain software, processes and technology strategic to market leadership.

Because stock option expense is determined in significant part by the trading price of our common stock and the volatility thereof, over which we have no direct control, the impact of such expense is not subject to effective management by us. Thus, we have excluded the impact of this expense from adjusted non-GAAP results. The stock option expense is included in the following GAAP operating expense lines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, ------------------ ----------------- 2007 2006 2007 2006 ------ -------- ------ ------ Cost of services $ 108 $ 546 $ 321 $1,609 Research and development 160 261 474 737 Sales and marketing 375 405 1,115 1,114 General and administrative 581 619 1,565 1,991 ------ ------- ------ ------ Total stock option expense $1,224 $ 1,831 $3,475 $5,451 ====== ======= ====== ====== (b) Adjustments represent purchase amortization from prior acquisitions. Such amortization is commonly excluded from GAAP net income by companies in our industry and we therefore exclude these amortization costs to provide more relevant and meaningful comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. (c) In conjunction with the Evant acquisition, we paid $2.8 million into escrow for employee retention bonuses to be paid upon completion of up to 12 months of service with us. During 2006, we completed the Evant retention bonus program and paid out the final bonuses. The 2006 adjustment represents the current period expense associated with these retention bonuses. We have excluded these costs because they do not correlate to the expenses of our core operations. (d) During the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $270 against a $2.0 million investment in a technology company. We made our original investment in 2003. Because of the value of the investment is beyond our control and does not relate to our core operations, we have excluded the asset impairment from adjusted non-GAAP results. (e) Adjustment represents recoveries of previously expensed sales tax resulting primarily from the expiration of the sales tax audit statutes in certain states. Because we have recognized the full potential amount of the sales tax expense in prior periods, any recovery of that expense resulting from the expiration of the statutes or the collection of tax from our customers would overstate the current period net income derived from our core operations as the recovery is not a result of any event occurring within our control during the current period. Thus, we have excluded these recoveries from adjusted non-GAAP results. MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC.
