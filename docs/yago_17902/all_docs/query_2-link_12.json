        "meta_description": "\" New Babylon The most interesting film showing in Chicago this weekend is\nbeing presented by the Department of Music at the University of Chicago. NEW\nBABYLON, the last truly silent film directed by the team of Soviet\nfilmmakers Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg, had an original musical\nscore written for it by Dimitri Shostakovich. It will be shown with music\nperformed by a live orchestra. NEW BABYLON is both a historical\nand a revolutionary epic. It is set during the Paris Commune of 1871.\nThrough a series of incidents, it portrays the clash between the Paris\nworkers and the bourgeoisie. The film's heroine is Louise. She works as a\nclerk in a luxury store in Paris – the New Babylon of the film's\ntitle. As Louise becomes politicized, she joins the Communards, and ends up\ndying for her principles and the cause. The script was co-authored by\nKozintsev and Trauberg, who then shot the film in Leningrad and Paris.\nJay Leyda, the great historian of Soviet cinema, wrote that NEW\nBABYLON provides “a consistently magnificent climax to the silent\nfilms of Kozintsev and Trauberg. The performances have just the right\nmixture of warmth and caricature, and the chiefly studio photography is\nirreproachable. It is a glittering film in which the glitter plays a\ncalculated dramatic role.” Despite being considered today the\nculminating achieement of the Soviet silent film era, NEW BABYLON was\nreceived with mixed reviews when it was first released. Some critics thought\nits expressionistic style was too intellectual. Shostakovich wrote\na score that made use of French music popular at the time of the Commune.\nSome of this harks to the popular operetta-style of Jacques Offenbach, but\nthe score also features a highly original arrangement of La Marseillaise.\nThe music did not go over too well at the film's premiere. Shostakovich's\norchestration was too sophisticated for the orchestra which performed it.\nThose who attended the premiere simply thought that the conductor was drunk.\nKozintsev and Trauberg are the under-appreciated geniuses of\nSoviet cinema. Shortly after they arrived and met in St. Petersburg, the\n17-year-old Kozintsev and the 21-year-old Trauberg formed what they named\nthe FEKS Studio – the Factory of the Eccentric Actor. This\n“factory” was to integrate pantomime, circus and\ncommedia dell'arte into a new revolutionary art form. The films made by the\nFEKS team included “The Adventures of\nOktyabrina” in 1924, “The Devil's Wheel” in\n1926, and the great adaptation of Gogol's short story, “The\nOvercoat” in 1926. The films brought to the screen unforgettable\ncharacter-types which Kozintsev and Trauberg found on the city streets, in\nwhat they called “bottom of the city barrel.” This\nexpressionist realism in brilliant casting is evident in NEW BABYLON and\ncontinued throughout Kozintsev's career up to his last film, the greatest\nShakespeare adapted for film, KING LEAR. In NEW BABYLON, the\nlandmarks of Paris form a brilliant city-scape against which Kozintsev and\nTrauberg capture the intimate life of the people and textures of Paris, its\ncobblestones, the expressive faces of its people. These characters are\nmemorable – the young saleswoman, played by Elena\nKuzmina, a jaded, sometimes tipsy boss of the store, played by David\nGuffman, a young journalist played by Sergei Gerasimov, later to become a\nmajor Soviet director, and a young soldier who becomes the victim of a\nbourgeois conspiracy against the French people. The cinematographer for NEW\nBABYLON was the great Andrei Moskvin, who would later shoot Sergei\nEisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE. This is early Soviet cinema which\nwe don't expect –used as we are to the largely humor-less films of\nEisenstein, the psychological dramas of Pudovkin or the lyrical features of\nDovzhenko. NEW BABYLON is laced with satire and wit, it revels in its own\ninvention, it celebrates the imagination, even as it focuses on the\nrevolutionary struggle of the working class. The uniqueness of Kozintsev and\nTrauberg and of the FEKS group was that they celebrated individuals rather\nthan massive movements. It was inevitable that eventually both\nKozintsev and Trauberg would run up against the humorless tyranny of\nStalinism. Like Shostakovich and other great artists, Kozintsev and Trauberg\nboth had a difficult life in which they were unable to create for long\nperiods of time. Kozintsev eventually emerged from this only in the late\n1950s with three brilliant, theoretically apolitical and therefore\n“safe” films – his adaptations of Don Quixote,\nHamlet and King Lear. Much has been made in academic circles over\nthe version of NEW BABYLON used by Marek Pytel for the reconstruction of the\nShostakovich score. It is the shortest extant version of the film, cut by\nabout ten minutes largely for the export to foreign countries. Images of\nfemale cleavage, prostitutes and other images considered too erotic were cut\nto satisfy censors in France, Britain and America.
