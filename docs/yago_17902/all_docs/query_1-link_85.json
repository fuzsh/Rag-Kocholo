        "text": "THE 21st New York Film Festival, which opens this evening, has a rich mix of 32 features in 26 programs from 16 countries and departs from its predecessors in three major areas. The 17-day gala brings to Lincoln Center more directors than any previous festival, 16, more American films than ever, 11, and a movie that generated the sharpest critical split in the selection panel in memory.\n\nThe five-member panel of experts began using a 1-to-5 rating system about six years ago, according to Richard Roud, the festival's exuberant director and one of its founders.\n\nA 1 vote, he said in his basement office at Lincoln Center the other day, connotes, ''I hate this dreadful film, and I'll hate the rest of you if you accept it.'' A 2 vote, he continued, indicates ''I don't like it, but if the rest of you like it, I won't be angry.'' A 3 signifies ''Yes.'' A 4 concludes ''It must be in the festival.'' And a 5? ''It's a masterpiece!''\n\nMr. Roud, who heads the panel, said decisions were weighted toward enthusiasm to weed out the mediocre, ''the sort of film that nobody hates and nobody loves.'' The system, he said, eliminates a recurring problem in festivals, where some movies are chosen because no judge feels strongly about them. These middle-of-the-road films, he said, tend to be boring. Pressed to identify the movie that no two experts agreed on, Mr. Roud paused, ruminated and replied: ''I can't. The panel is a jury.''\n\nTo open the festival, the experts chose an American movie for the first time, Lawrence Kasdan's ''The Big Chill'' (reviewed on page C14), which the writer-director describes as ''a comedy of values.'' It features such stars as William Hurt, Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Meg Tilly and Jobeth Williams, and is about college chums of the 1960's who gather 15 years later for the funeral of one of their number, who has committed suicide. The movie deals with friendship, how it endures and how it changes, the loss of innocence and the tension between ideals and ambition. Mr. Kasdan's writing credits include ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back.'' He also wrote and directed ''Body Heat,'' the much-praised 1981 film noir.\n\n''The Big Chill'' will be screened twice this evening, at 7:30 in the 1,096-seat Alice Tully Hall and at 9 in the 2,500-seat Avery Fisher Hall. All other weekend films will be shown at Tully Hull. Tickets for both opening night performances (and the Oct. 9 closing) are $10 and $14. Tickets for all other screenings are $5 and $7.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
