        "text": "An interesting little movie, particularly to those who wish to explore Russian modernist film and formalist film theory - three contributors to The Overcoat (namely Tynyanov, the screenwriter, and cinematographers Moskvin and Mikhailov) also wrote texts for the influential 1927 anthology of film-theoretic essays Poetika kino.\n\nThe Overcoat contains highly expressive and sometimes delightfully surrealistic montage, acting and visuals. (Even has some stop-motion!) As an adaptation of Gogol, it captures his spirit really well, while, to compare with his other adaptations I'm familiar with, Eve of Ivan Kupalo, though it is a masterpiece, is definitely far too deeply into surrealism to retain that gogolian ambiguity (\"laughter with a lot of bitterness and sorrow\", writes Belinsky), while the 1984 Dead Souls…\n\n\"the overcoat\" is a silent film of grigori kozintsev and leonid trauberg that combines two short stories of gogol together to build a narrative. the visuals are unquestionably outstanding, the cinematography is quite effective in building the dark, noir-ish atmosphere, and i feel like the stylistic visual choices were very fitting for the underlying plot lines. however, i don’t find anything else about the film particularly appealing. i didn’t understand why they decided to merge two different works of gogol together. i don’t think this added anything especially interesting to the narrative, and i truly believe the piece would’ve worked better as simple \"the overcoat\" based-movie. also i absolutely hated how bashmachkin looked high throughout the entire thing, the surrealistic…\n\nHaving knowledge of the two stories this film is based on is probably best when going into this. As someone who has read neither and was assigned this to watch for a Russian film history class, I was extremely confused. I found the first half extremely difficult to follow, with most characters dressed very similarly and a mission for the main character that I never really understood.\n\nWhile the second half (which is pretty much an entirely separate story) is much simpler and easier to understand, it's premise feels way too basic to warrant being stretched into a half-hour long story, especially one featuring an inexpressive old man who moves at a snail's pace.\n\nFinally, throughout both halves of the…\n\nA real oddball Soviet concotion, a kitchen sink variation of styles from the 1920s. The story involves a weak minded clerk who gets in over his head with a couple of corrupt bureaucrats. This somewhat bumpily turns into an adaptation of Gogol's \"The Overcoat\", where the clerk gets the coat, loses the coat, etc, only here he doesn't end up a ghost haunting the streets of St. Petersburg. (Too romantic and dangerous for Leningrad). The first part of the story, inspired by another Gogol story (\"Nevsky Prospect\") though not terribly much, works as a communist add-on, sort of retconning Gogol's story into being a tale of the evils of capitalism. Still, there's lots of surreal imagery and expressionist touches as…"
