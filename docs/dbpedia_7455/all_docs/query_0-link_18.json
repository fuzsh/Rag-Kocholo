        "text": "Rob Ford, the combative former mayor of Toronto who gained international notoriety with his confession of crack cocaine use, his public drunkenness and his belligerent clashes with other public officials, died on Tuesday. He was 46.\n\nHis office announced his death but gave no other details. Mr. Ford had been undergoing treatment for malignant liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer, since September 2014.\n\nAlong with his brother Doug, Mr. Ford was a controversial figure in Toronto politics for years, drawing support largely from conservative residents of suburban communities that had been absorbed into the City of Toronto. In 2013 he acknowledged smoking crack cocaine during one of his “drunken stupors,” as he put it.\n\nAfter his cancer diagnosis, Mr. Ford withdrew from his mayoral re-election campaign in favor of his brother, who was defeated. But Rob Ford did win the seat on the City Council that Doug Ford had held.\n\nThe son of a millionaire, Mr. Ford built his power base among mainly blue-collar, right-wing voters — “the Ford Nation,” he called them — in five former municipalities that joined Toronto in 1998. Mr. Ford was a lifelong resident of one such suburb, Etobicoke, where he was born on May 28, 1969.\n\nHe echoed his constituents’ view that urban elitists were inflating taxes through social service programs and excessively generous contracts with public sector unions.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
