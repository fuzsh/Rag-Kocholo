Steele and published by Pelican Publishing Company, Inc. in 1987.\n\nAustin Ford, Born 1790, Fauquier County, Virginia, Died July, 1841, Married Jane Allison (1817 or 1818)\n\nAustin Ford met his wife, Jane Allison, while he was serving in the military and was active in campaigns against the Indians in Florida. Jane was born in Florida in 1794. Austin returned to Fauquier County, Virginia after his marriage and practiced his trade as a stone mason. Austin and Jane Allison had the following known children in Virginia:\n\nJames Thomas Ford (born 1820) John W. Ford Lucella Ford Charles Ford (born 1828) Elizabeth Ford Mary Jane Ford William H. Ford Arthur F. Ford (died 1885) Robert A. Ford (born March 13, 1840)\n\nIn 1840, Austin took his family from Virginia to Clark County, Missouri, where he managed a large farm for a man named Lee. In July of 1841, Ford was killed from a blow to the head in an altercation with Lee. John Wesley Ford then became head of the household. John married Anna Maria Storey and operated Seybolts Tavern in Missouri in 1870. John and Maria's children were William Ezra, Mary Jane, Georginia, John H., Edwin, Luther, and Florida. Georginia and Florida died as children. Austin Ford's widow, Jane Allison, moved to Clay County, Missouri in 1851, where she died in 1857.\n\nCharles Ford married a girl from Tennessee named Martha and spent his life as a farmer near Richmond in Ray County, Missouri.\n\nRobert Austin Ford was born in Virginia on March 13, 1840. He married Mary E. Story, a daughter of Thomas and Luck A. (Baldwin) Story in Clay County, Missouri. Luck was born in Clay County in 1850. Robert A. and Mary had the following children: Oscar A., Jesse James, Ella T., Walter N., Maggie L, Robert A., Flora Belle, and Arthur F. The following children all died young: John T., Flora, and Arthur.\n\nJames Thomas Ford was born in Virginia in 1820. He married Mary Ann Bruin, daughter of Elias and Ann Bruin, in Virginia on August 10, 1840. James moved to Missouri along with his father, Austin, and their family. James T. Ford returned to Virginia shortly after his father died and there became a tenant farmer for John A. Washington at Mt. Vernon. In 1843, James T. and his wife returned to Clark County, Missouri, where the following children were born:\n\nGeorgia Ford (born 1844) John T. Ford (born 1846) Elias Capline Ford Martha and Amanda Ford (twins--born 1855) Charles Wilson Ford (born July 9, 1857) Wilber Ford (born 1860) Robert Newton Ford (born January 31, 1862)\n\nShortly after Robert Newton Ford was born, the family returned to Mt. Vernon for a short period before finally settling on a farm in Clay County, Missouri. A well-known student of the Bible, James Thomas pastored a church near their home.\n\nWilliam H. Ford married Artella Cummins on September 21, 1862 and later Amanda Goode on February 27, 1866. William lived near Kearney, Missouri, where his children Fanny and Albert Ford were born.\n\nCharles Wilson Ford, the fifth child of James Thomas ford and Mary (Bruin) Ford, was born on July 9, 1857. Charles had apparently been involved with the James-Younger gang and was accepted by Jesse James. Charles went to St. Joseph some months before April 3, 1882, and because he was wanted by the law he was staying in Jesse's home. While they were planning the robbery of a Platte City, Nebraska bank, Charles Ford persuaded Jesse James to let his younger brother, Bob Ford, age twenty, participate. When bob arrived at Jesse's St. Joseph, Missouri home, Charles and Bob carefully waited for the proper moment to carry out the plot they had previously arranged with Missouri Governor Crittenden and law officials to bring down the notorious Jesse James. After breakfast on the morning of April 3, 1882, Jesse, Bob, and Charles left the kitchen and entered the parlor. Jesse removed his gun belt and laid it on a day bed. Noticing a picture on the wall that needed straightening or dusting, he stood on a chair. At that moment Robert Newton Ford fired his .44 and Jesse James fell dead.\n\nCharles Ford became distraught over the tremendous public ridicule he and his brother received over shooting the famous, unarmed outlaw Jesse James in the back of the head. Charles committed suicide on May 6, 1884, two years after their cowardly deed.\n\nBob Ford, apparently with a good portion of reward money, journeyed to Creede, Colorado where he established a saloon and reveled in the notoriety he had earned as the man who killed Jesse James. A man named O'Kelley, apparently a fan of Jesse James, became inebriated and walked into Ford's saloon and shot and killed him on June 8, 1892. Buried in Colorado, Ford's body was exhumed a few years later by his family and returned to Missouri.\n\nBiography\n\nJames Thomas Ford was born in Virginia in 1820. He married Mary Ann Bruin, daughter of Elias and Ann Bruin, in Virginia on August 10, 1840.\n\nChildren born to James Thomas Ford and Mary Ann Bruin:\n\nSarah J. Ford (b. abt. 1841)\n\nGeorgiana Ford (b. abt. 1843)\n\nMary T. Ford (b. abt. 1845)\n\nJohn Thomas Ford (b: November 6, 1847)\n\nMartha Elizabeth Ford (b: April 22, 1849)\n\nHarriet Ford (b. abt. 1851)\n\nElias Capline Ford (b: July 10, 1853)\n\nAmanda Francis Ford (b: April 1, 1855)\n\nCharles Wilson Ford (b: July 9, 1857)\n\nWilber Pottuck Ford (b: November 19, 1859)\n\nRobert Newton Ford (b: January 31, 1862)[1]\n\nJames was born in 1817. He was the son of Austin Ford and Jane Allison. He passed away in 1890.
