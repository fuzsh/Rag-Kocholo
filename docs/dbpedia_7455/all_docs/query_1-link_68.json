        "text": "On Sunday, June 14th 2020, Robert Matthew Ford went to be with his Lord and Savior in Heaven. He was 30 years old.\n\nRobert was born in 1989 in Englewood, Colorado. He received his diploma from Columbine High School. Robert worked for BrightView Landscape as an Irrigation Technician, which he took much pride in.\n\nRobert was preceded in death by his grandfather Robert Ford. He is survived by his father, Kenneth Ford, his mother, Debra Weger, as well as his grandparents Loretta Ford and Joe Coet, his Aunt Kathie and Uncle Jerry Ford, his Aunt Lorie and Uncle Bill Umpleby, Aunt Daphne Weger and brother Michael Weger, as well as his older sister, Krystal Ford, and nephew Wyatt Betz, and several Aunts, Uncles, and cousins.\n\nRobert had a deep love of fishing since he was a little kid, and he would often take his beloved golden retriever Abbey with him to the lake. He was a devoted Broncos fan, and had collected many Broncos jerseys and hats over the years. He loved music and attending concerts, especially at Red Rocks. Robert wanted to do what he could to help others, he was inspired by the motivational Pastor and speaker Joel Osteen. Most importantly, Robbie loved his family.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at a location to be determined at Chatfield State Park Reservoir on the morning of July 20th, 2020 at 9AM, which would have been Robbie's 31st birthday. The memorial will be officiated by Pastor Duane Brigman. A BBQ lunch reception will follow, Robbie's favorite food, at the following address: 6438 West Clifton Place in Littleton, Colorado 80128.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the Golden Retriever Rescue of the Rockies in Robert's honor, for he truly loved his golden Abbey. Cards of condolences may be sent to Ken Ford at 6438 W. Clifton Pl Littleton CO 80128.\n\n“It's hard to beat a person that never gives up.” - Babe Ruth\n\n“Dear loving Father, the presence of my Brother in my life is a gift to me. Thank you for his life, his heart, and his soul. Thanks for giving me someone who looked out for me and cared for me. Even the rivalry between us was a blessing to me. Thank you for what I learned from my Brother's life and love. So now I ask you Lord, bless my Brother with the abundance of Your love and mercy. Cover him with your grace. Let him feel your tenderness touch his soul. Let him know your mercy sets his spirit free. I present to you, oh Lord, My love for my brother. Open up the heavens to him. Bring him great peace and joy. Thank you for my brother, dear Lord. Thank you for his life and love. All in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, Amen.”"
