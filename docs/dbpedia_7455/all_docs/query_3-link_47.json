Code A Biography: Son of Francis Ford and Elsie Van Nami. ------- Bob Ford and his wife Augusta emigrated to New Zealand in the early 1950s and he died there in Takapuna which is a suburb of the principal city Auckland. The Auckland Museum holds a number of postcards and letters Ford sent during his time with the brigades. His discharge papers and his IB passbook (number 38758) are also held there. His uncle was John Ford the famous movie director. Bob was an exceedingly tall man and there is a photo of him in later life in \"Kiwi Camaneros\". \"In a house filled with books, cats and records, the two non-aligned leftists (i.e. Bob and Augusta) brought a flavour of US progressive liberalism to the closeted world of 1950s New Zealand. Bob owned hundreds of jazz records, which became increasingly important to him as he lost his sight in old age\". Submitted by John Shennan.
