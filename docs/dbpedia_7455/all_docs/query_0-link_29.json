        "text": "TORONTO — After an 18-month battle with a rare yet aggressive form of cancer, controversial former Toronto mayor Rob Ford has died.\n\nThe 46-year-old polarizing politician succumbed to complications from a fast-growing cancerous abdominal tumour known as pleomorphic liposarcoma, which was diagnosed in September 2014.\n\nREAD MORE: Rob Ford Dead: Canadians share their condolences on social media\n\nFord leaves behind his wife Renata and two children, Stephanie and Douglas.\n\nMonths of aggressive radiation treatments were ineffective in treating the cancerous tumour, which doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital also chose to combat with surgery and an innovative targeted chemotherapy known as the Panov Program.\n\nDespite his diagnosis, Ford continued to work as a city councillor for the western suburb of Etobicoke North since October 2014 after bowing out of the mayoral race due to his health.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“I’d rather come to work than go home. I want to work. The worst thing I can imagine doing is just sitting on the couch and thinking about it,” he told Global News of his cancer diagnosis in March 2015.\n\n“If I don’t get my health back, then I’ll be joining my dad, wherever he is, pretty soon.”\n\nWATCH: Rob Ford, polarizing but popular Toronto mayor, dies at 46\n\nThe Ford family released a statement Tuesday, announcing the loss of their “beloved son, brother, husband, and father.”\n\n“A dedicated man of the people, Councillor Ford spent his life serving the citizens of Toronto,” the statement read, adding that funeral details would follow at a later time.\n\n“The family asks that you respect their privacy and join them in their grieving and their prayers.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWATCH: ‘Definitely going to miss him’: Michael Ford talks passing of Rob Ford\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau gave his condolences to Ford’s family after hearing of the former mayor’s death “at the too-young age of 46 years.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“My heart goes out to his wife Renata and to his two young children,” he said in Ottawa.\n\n“Our thoughts are with the entire Ford family at this difficult time.”\n\nToronto Mayor John Tory said Tuesday the city was “reeling with this news” and that his thoughts were with the Ford family.\n\n“I have known Rob Ford for many years. He was a man who spoke his mind and who ran for office because of the deeply felt convictions that he had,” he said in a statement, adding the councillor had a profound affect on many Torontonians with his “gregarious nature and approach to public service.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“I had a chance to visit him not long ago and while he was clearly not well, he was happy to hear me say I looked forward to his return to City Hall. Sadly, that won’t now happen but whatever differences we had, he knew I meant it.\n\n“He was, above all else, a profoundly human guy whose presence in our city will be missed.”\n\nMeteoric rise to the mayor’s office\n\nFord rose to prominence after winning the 2010 Toronto mayoral election on the back of a campaign aimed at stopping the “gravy train” and cutting waste in city expenditures.\n\nREAD MORE: A look back at Rob Ford’s 18-month battle with cancer\n\nBefore his municipal election victory over rival George Smitherman with 47 per cent of the vote on Oct. 25, 2010, Ford served as city councillor for Ward 2 (Etobicoke North) for 10 years after marrying his former high schoolmate Renata Brejniak in 2000.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUpon taking the mayor’s office on Dec. 1, 2010, Ford worked quickly to eliminate the city’s controversial $60 Personal Vehicle Tax and slashed councillors budgets.\n\nFord also aimed to reduce his own waist in an effort to take on a healthier persona, launching the “Cut the Waist” weight-loss challenge with a goal of losing 50 pounds in January 2012.\n\nHe ultimately fell short of that goal in June 2012, losing just 22 pounds over the course of the five-month challenge, but solidified himself as a politician who didn’t shy away from making his personal struggles public.\n\nA controversial figure in the Toronto political spectrum, Ford will be remembered as much for his international notoriety as for the indelible mark he left on city hall.\n\nWATCH: Adrienne Batra, Toronto Sun editor and former director of communications for Rob Ford’s 2010 mayoral campaign, remembered the late politician on Tuesday after he passed away from cancer.\n\nScandal-plagued political history\n\nBorn in Etobicoke on May 28, 1969, Ford was the son of the late Doug Ford Sr., the political patriarch of the family who served as an MPP for Etobicoke-Humber from 1995 to 1999. He married his former high schoolmate Renata Brejniak in 2000.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nREAD MORE: What you need to know about Rob Ford’s cancer\n\nHis brother, Doug Ford Jr., was a former city councillor for Ward 2 Etobicoke North from 2010 to 2014 and unsuccessfully ran for mayor in his brother’s stead after his cancer diagnosis forced him to drop out of the race in 2014.\n\nMonths before his diagnosis, Ford admitted he had smoked crack cocaine after being asked by Global News journalist Jackson Proskow at Toronto city hall on Nov. 5, 2013 following months of denying the allegations.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“[It was] probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago,” he said at the time.\n\n“All I can do now is apologize and move on.”\n\nWATCH: Global National Washington Bureau Chief Jackson Proskow spent years covering Rob Ford’s time as Mayor of Toronto. Proskow takes a look back at the charismatic but troubled politician’s time in office.\n\nInfamous crack smoking video\n\nThe admission came months after a revelation that journalists from the Toronto Star and Gawker had seen a video of Ford smoking crack cocaine in May 2013.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nToronto police confirmed the video’s authenticity in October 2013, but even after it caused a worldwide sensation, Ford refused to step down and his personal problems continued to plague his time in office.\n\nTrending Now\n\nCanadian Olympian Eric Lamaze owes nearly $800K following latest court ruling\n\nWho is ‘Ketamine Queen’ Jasveen Sangha charged in Matthew Perry’s death?\n\nREAD MORE: Rob Ford’s celebrity encounters: Former Toronto mayor’s time with the stars\n\nThen-Police Chief Bill Blair said the video contained “images consistent with those that had been previously reported in the press,” but added there was nothing in the video that would allow police to “form reasonable grounds” to lay a criminal charge.\n\nFord said he couldn’t comment on a video he hadn’t seen and that he had no plans to resign as mayor. He then called for police to release the video, and repeated he was not a drug addict or an alcoholic.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUnable to remove him, Ford’s fellow councillors stripped him of his powers and budget.\n\n“You know what, now that I look back on it, it’s the best thing that ever happened to me,” he told Global News in March 2015.\n\n“I very well could have been dead. Or in jail, because I know the police were following me.”\n\nSubstance abuse speculation\n\nSpeculation the then-mayor had substance abuse issues were nothing new.\n\nFord was arrested in Miami, Florida in February 1999 for driving under the influence and removed from a Toronto Maple Leafs game in April 2006 for his drunken and belligerent behaviour. While he first denied his attendance at the game to the National Post, he later admitted his attendance and shared his regret.\n\nREAD MORE: IN PICTURES: Rob Ford’s controversial career\n\nDuring his time as mayor, he was also alleged to have shown up intoxicated to the Garrison Ball in March 2013. He was asked to leave after he arrived late and was speaking in a “rambling, incoherent manner that alarmed some of the guests,” according to the Toronto Star.\n\nSecurity staff reported seeing Ford visibly inebriated at city hall at 2 a.m. on St. Patrick’s Day in 2012, the same night he was accused of verbally abusing former staffer Olivia Gondek, according to information from documents related to an investigation by Toronto police into Ford and his associate Sandro Lisi.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFord was also suspected of being impaired at Toronto’s Taste of the Danforth festival in August 2013, leading to rampant speculation about the then-mayor’s condition after several videos of him acting strangely were uploaded to YouTube.\n\nThen, during an infamous press conference lampooned on late night talk shows around the world in November 2013, Ford denied allegations he verbally abused Gondek and that he had said he would “eat her out.”\n\nREAD MORE: Condolences pour in on passing of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford\n\nFord also said he planned to take legal action against a Bier Markt server who accused him of “doing lines” of cocaine, verbally abusing staffers and partying with women believed to be prostitutes.\n\n“I have more than enough to eat at home,” Ford said in the widely criticized scrum, before later apologizing that day for his “graphic remarks” with his wife Renata at his side in a rare public appearance.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlcohol as a catalyst for illicit drug use\n\nLooking back on his most turbulent time in the mayor’s office, Ford told Global News in March 2015 that alcohol was the catalyst for his descent into illicit drugs.\n\n“Everything revolves around alcohol, for me, when it comes to drugs,” he said at the time.\n\n“Everyone says, ‘Well you smoked crack, and you did lines and you’ve done all the drugs.’ Most people that do drugs, I’m not saying smoking marijuana, I’m saying doing cocaine … usually start with drinks.”\n\nBut Ford continued to deny the allegations for months, even after more footage of his intoxicated outbursts were released.\n\nHe later told Global News those controversial moments at city hall were a blur to him.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“I never knew what to do. I didn’t know – I was in a circle, basically, or a den with demons, that I needed to get out. And I didn’t know how to get out, and I didn’t know what the timing was to get out.
