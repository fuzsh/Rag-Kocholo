        "text": "Author: Rob Ford\n\nRobert Charles Ford BA (Hons) MEd Director of Heritage International School Group. British Council Schools' Ambassador & Advisor Principal of Wyedean School from 2015 – 2019. I am a committed , experienced and successful global school leader and educator. I believe in the transformative power of learning for our young people. During my time as Principal, Wyedean School was a high performing IB candidate World School delivering World Class education through C21st learning opportunities. I had the privilege to lead a team of incredible colleagues working tirelessly to ensure the very best inclusive education and compelling learning was the daily experience of our students. I am committed as an educator to the principles of international education, the IB as well as the power of digital learning, sustainability & creativity in developing the learner holistically. I am heavily involved in International Education as a long serving British Council ambassador, IB educator & school leader, contributing a number of articles about leadership, curriculum and global learning. I have been a speaker/contributor at a number of major conferences over the years including with the Microsoft-British Council’s ASEAN “Deep Learning” policy seminar series in SE Asia focussing on the impact of global learning in the curriculum and classroom as well as a number of projects with the British Council. I have advised and acted as a global education consultant to schools and school boards in the state and the independent sectors. As a father of three young global citizens I feel passionately that for my daughters growing up and all the young people in my care as a Global Educator, we should be preparing them all to access, participate and lead in their global society and to be happy in their personal lives.\n\nFrom Madeley to Moldova\n\nThe 1984-85 Miners' strike, 4 decades on from a Billy Elliot who didn't do ballet The “Dirty Dozen” March 1985, Hills Lane Social Club, Madeley, Shropshire. The only Shropshire Coal Miners to remain on strike for the year. My father, 3rd from left. “Your father’s battles are your father’s battles. Not yours. You don’t need… Continue reading From Madeley to Moldova\n\nThe sounds of a school\n\n“Nothing essential happens in the absence of noise.” Jacques Attali The Germans have a very apt phrase for this time of the year; \"zwischen den Jahren\" and it refers to the time between Christmas and New Year. A transition between the old year, still to end, and the promise of the new one, still yet… Continue reading The sounds of a school\n\nLeslie Jones MA (Oxon) 1933-2023, A life.\n\nLes was born in the north Welsh village of Coedpoeth, just outside Wrexham, in January 1933. Les was the youngest of four children. He had three elder sisters, Betty, Dilys and Gwen, who he adored and loved all his life. Les’s mother, Theresa nee Davies, originally from Moreton, stayed at home to look after the… Continue reading Leslie Jones MA (Oxon) 1933-2023, A life.\n\nTenderness needed for tumultuous times\n\n“Happiness, too, is inevitable” Albert Camus No two school years are ever the same. The calendar and cycle of events may seem the same but what you plan for in the summer rarely makes it into the late autumn schedule. The energy, optimism and enthusiasm of the late summer catapults the school community into the… Continue reading Tenderness needed for tumultuous times\n\n“Both a historian and a futurologist” – Finding the words as a school leader ahead of a new academic year.\n\n“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea” - attributed to Antoine De Saint-Exupery; ‘The Little Prince’. This life of contrasts is something I will never get used to. The… Continue reading “Both a historian and a futurologist” – Finding the words as a school leader ahead of a new academic year.\n\n“The only journey is the one within.” Finding your best self.\n\nI’ve noticed a lot of posts on social media from school leaders taking up new posts, first headships this autumn, all asking for what advice would experienced school leaders give to think about over the summer break. I think I am going to recommend to any school leader the need to be aware of your… Continue reading “The only journey is the one within.” Finding your best self.\n\nDid we just end another academic year so soon? Making moments in education.\n\n“Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air.” Ralph Waldo Emerson A year can feel like a long time in education. It’s hard to comprehend the sheer relief, and exhaustion, we all felt at Heritage this time last year, as we danced the hora in the May sunshine. A year, where we… Continue reading Did we just end another academic year so soon? Making moments in education.\n\nI choose Europe\n\n“Your feet will bring you where your heart is”. Karen Marie Moning It’s been a long while since I felt so emotional in a concert that tears rolled down my face. It was in the final choral moment of “Ode to Joy '' at the finale of the 4th movement and it took me by… Continue reading I choose Europe\n\nInternationalism over isolation; how to live in an age of stupid.\n\nIt’s not often I get to stroll across Westminster Bridge, umbrella in hand, on the 1st March, St David’s Day and wearing a Martisor for the start of Spring. The Houses of Parliament, the river Thames, Boudica and Big Ben, all familiar and famous. Especially familiar for me on that first Wednesday morning of March… Continue reading Internationalism over isolation; how to live in an age of stupid."
