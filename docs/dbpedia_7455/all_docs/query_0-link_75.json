        "text": "In the century since its founding, the Ford Motor Company of Canada has evolved from a relatively independent entity within the Ford empire, with a strong element of minority ownership and its own overseas subsidiaries, to a fully integrated and wholly owned part of Ford's North American operations. The unique emergence and transformation of Ford-Canada among Ford's foreign enterprises is explained by Canada's changing automotive trade policies, the personal relations of the Ford family with its Canadian offspring, and a corporate strategy pursued by Henry Ford's successors and the American Ford company, which sought to bring Ford-Canada more directly under Detroit's control.\n\n4 The classic study of Ford and his times is the three-volume biography by Nevins, Allan with Hill, Frank, Ford (New York, 1954–1962)Google Scholar. A small sample of the literature on Henry Ford and his company includes: Brinkley, Douglas, Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress, 1903–2003 (New York, 2003)Google Scholar; Bonin, Hubert, Lung, Yannick, and Tolliday, Steven, eds., Ford, 1903–2003: The European History (Paris, 2003)Google Scholar; Chandler, Alfred D.

In 2003, James Mays produced a chronology of the company with the assistance of Ford-Canada, Ford and Canada: 100 Years Together (Montreal, 2003)Google Scholar, but there is no detailed examination of the company or its evolution.\n\n9 On the spread of multinational enterprises, see Vernon, Raymond, Sovereignty at Bay: The Multinational Spread of U.S. Enterprises (New York, 1971)Google Scholar; Wilkins, Mira, The Maturing of the Multinational Enterprise: American Business Abroad from 1914 to 1970 (Cambridge, Mass., 1975)Google Scholar; Behrman, Jack N., U.S. International Business and Governments (New York, 1971)Google Scholar.

Overseas Companies (All Wholly Owned): Our Investment in Shares of and Dividends Received from These Companies,” BFRC, Ace. 880, Mira Wilkins Papers, Box 3. The founding dates are as follows: Ford-Australia, 1925; Ford–South Africa, 1923; Ford-India, 1926; Ford-Malaya, 1926; Ford–New Zealand, 1936. “Subsidiary Companies Data,” BFRC, Ace. 713, International Division Correspondence, Box 3, Canada-1949. For Ford-Canada production and imperial exports, see Wilkins and Hill, American Business Abroad, Appendix 6.\n\n25 The original agreement was found in a grease-covered cardboard box in Windsor's engine plant in 1996 as the company prepared to shut the facility down. A. Priddle, “History Comes Home: Original Documents Showing the Birth of the Canadian Auto Industry Are Ready for Viewing,” Windsor Star, 18 Mar. 1997, B1; “An Agreement made and entered into at the City of Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., this tenth day of August A.D., 1904,” BFRC, Ace. 284, Henry Ford Correspondence, Box 13, File 13–7.\n\n30 On the early Canadian auto industry, see Davis, Donald F., “Dependent Motorization: Canada and the Automobile to the 1930s,” in McCalla, Douglas, ed., The Development of Canadian Capitalism: Essays in Business History (Toronto, 1990)Google Scholar; Traves, Tom, “The Development of the Ontario Automobile Industry to 1939,” in Drummond, Ian, ed., Progress Without Planning: The Economic History of Ontario from Confederation to the Second World War (Toronto, 1987)Google Scholar.\n\n32 Ford-Canada held 99.9 percent of all the shares of its companies in Australia (both the manufacturing and sales companies), South Africa, India, Malaya and New Zealand. The remaining shares (between two and nine in each company) were held by directors or by locals for legal reasons. “Subsidiary Companies Data,” 1 Apr. 1949, BFRC, Ace. 713, Box 3, Canada, 1949.\n\n34 Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, Facts and Figures of the Automotive Industry (Toronto, 1969)Google Scholar; Moritz, Michael, Going For Broke: The Chrysler Story (New York, 1981)Google Scholar; Hyde, Charles K., Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation (Detroit, 2003)Google Scholar. American Motors did not begin production until 1946, under the name Nash Motor Company. Studebaker Canada was another wholly owned subsidiary, which folded in the 1960s.\n\n37 Tolliday writes that “[Perry’s] prominence aroused jealousies among the hard-bitten production men in Detroit, who were instinctively suspicious of outsiders who wanted to do things differently, especially if they were independent and strong minded.” McGregor was all of these things, of course, but was clearly not seen in the same light as Perry. “The Origins of Ford of Europe,” 157.\n\n41 Owing to their status as the only “Ford” securities on the market (they were listed in Toronto and Detroit), Ford-Canada shares were targeted in the mid-1920s by unscrupulous stock speculators, who sold “fractional shares” to unsuspecting investors keen to have a stake in a Ford company (though it was not the Detroit firm). The scam spread as far as Europe, and snared thousands. See the correspondence regarding this issue in BFRC, Ace. 75, Box 84, Folder FMC of Canada Stock, 1925.\n\n55 In 1950, the board was again expanded to eight members. “Report of the Annual Meeting of the Ford Motor Company of Canada, Ltd., 29 April 1946,” “Annual Report, Year Ended December 31,1946, Ford Motor Company of Canada,” and “Report of the Annual Meeting of the Ford Motor Company of Canada, Ltd., 28 April 1947,” BFRC, Ace. 285, Box 2827 and 2958, File Ford Motor Canada, 1946–47 and 1947–49.\n\n58 “Charges and service fees under new agreement with Ford Motor Company of Canada,” Donald Kehl to Robert S. McNamara, 14 Oct. 1949. BFRC, Ace. 713, Box 3, File Canada 1949. The exchange of information was a two-way street. In the early 1930s, Campbell had gone across the river to Dearborn to help with the development of the V-8 and to assist the company in gaining control over its disorganized inventories.\n\n60 That a new era between had begun in the relationship between the two companies became clear in a note by International Division head Russell I. Roberge to Breech regarding the setting of car prices: “The writer would like to know whether you consider a proposed price change affecting a major product of Ford of Canada requires consideration by the American directors of the Canadian company, or whether a matter of this kind could be considered a management decision by Ford of Canada.” Breech responded only that the Canadian pricing was “satisfactory.” “Regular Monthly Financial Summary of FMCC and its Overseas Subsidiaries for November and December, 1949,” R. S. McNamara to E. R. Breech, 18 Jan. 1950; “Canadian Pricing for Models to be Produced by FMCC,” R. I. Roberge to Henry Ford II and E. R. Breech, 2 Mar. 1950.

Roberge, Box 3, File Canada, 1950.\n\n63 The list included information on customs, tariffs, organization of the companies, dividends, dealer lists, quarterly financial reports, and even photographs of body types and models produced by the overseas companies that differed from those in the United States. R. S. Milliken (export manager, FMCC) to R. I. Roberge (Ford International), various dates. BFRC, Ace. 713, International Division Records, Russell I. Roberge, Box 3, File Canada 1949, 1–50.\n\n73 Henry Ford II to Arjay Miller et al., 6 Mar. 1964. L. A. Iacocca to K. E. Scott, 19 Mar. 1964. Ben D. Mills to K. E. Scott, 17 Mar. 1964. C. R.

Comments to the Executive Office from Ford-U.S. Staffs and Divisions Concerning the Proposed Increase in Integration of the Canadian and U.S Automotive Operations, Ford Motor Company of Canada Archives, Oakville, Ontario.\n\n77 Ford-Canada's R. M. Sale stated, “Henry Ford's commitment to free trade had no effect on the Canadian company viewpoint. A company like ours was a separate company and had to formulate its own approach. We recognized that there had to be some Canadian tariff or there would be no industry. There was never any conflict with Henry Ford over tariff policy–for Henry Ford took the view that it was good business for the Canadian company to formulate its own approach–the approach best for Canadian interests. Ford-Canada has never taken a ‘high tariff position’ but rather a position favouring a tariff ‘sufficient to let our industry grow.’” “Wilkins interview with R. M. Sale, 26 Apr. 1961.” BFRC, Ace. 880, Mira Wilkins Papers, Box 3.\n\n88 Officials at Ford described the changes: “Previously the Canadian company decided how it should meet the content requirements and what it should manufacture and assemble. Now, all of this is decided in Detroit simply because the US company has to decide what the content in Canada shall be in order to integrate it with all the North American operations. Consequently, the Canadian company is really a division under the North American operations rather than being a separate company as it used to be.” Jack Behrman interviews with John Andrews (FMC, vice president in charge of European auto operations) and Percy Prance (formerly a director of Ford of Canada), 28 Apr. 1967.

The company divested itself of its South African holding in 1987, selling 18 percent of Ford South Africa to the giant Anglo American Corp. and giving the remaining 24 percent of the company to the employees. Jim Jones, “Ford Finds Route Out of South Africa,” Financial Post, 30 Nov. 1987,11.\n\n97 In 1991 the company lost C$85 million, C$363 million in 1992, C$161 million in 1993, and C$35 million in 1994. Yet in 1994, Ford's parent company had profits of over $5 billion, while GM-Canada alone earned more than C$1 billion.
