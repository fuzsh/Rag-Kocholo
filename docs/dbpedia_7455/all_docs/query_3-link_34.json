        "text": "I grew up on a large farm in the northern part of Maryland. I’m an only child and being on a farm like that made me rely on the imaginations of others as I voraciously read everything I could, and then later, making up my own stories.\n\nMy imagination made me lead a rebellion in kindergarten and convince everyone to color Superman capes as opposed to doing a project the teacher wanted. She wasn’t pleased.\n\nAnd that started my opposition to authority.\n\nI grew up on a steady diet of The Twilight Zone, Tales from the Dark Side, Tales from the Crypt, and… well, you get the idea. My parents were an incredible influence on me as they kept feeding that fodder to my growing mind. We grew up on the lower end of middle class, but I was never in want of anything and my parents always made sure I had a few bucks for the Book Mobile when it came to school, or an issue of Famous Monsters or Fangoria if I requested it.\n\nMy writing has always leaned to horror and the human condition. I tend to write real life with a slight twist on the dial. I’ve been known to make readers cry, look under their beds at night, and rethink life choices."
