        "text": "Robert W. Ford, 69, of McHenry, passed away unexpectedly Monday, April 19, 2021 in Libertyville.\n\nHe was born May 31, 1951 in Chicago, the son of Robert I. Ford and Donna Rae (nee Williams) Mason.\n\nBob grew up in Park Ridge and graduated from Maine South High School in 1969. He attended Southern Illinois and Northern Illinois Universities. On June 24, 1972, he was united in marriage to his best friend and neighborhood sweetheart, Diane Engelen. As a devoted follower of Christ, he dedicated his time tirelessly serving in many capacities at the churches he attended.\n\nAfter 27 years of being a kitchen designer, he found new passion and pride making sure kids arrive at school on time as a school bus driver. He worked with diligence in all he did, but above all tasks, his heart and soul were for the people he worked with.\n\nBob enjoyed camping, spending time with his family, and taking many aimless car rides.\n\nHe touched many people’s lives with his kind giving, compassionate, outgoing personality and humor, with the biggest recipients being his loved ones and especially his 9 grandchildren.\n\nBob is survived by the love of his life of 49 years, Diane; his 4 children, Brian (Lori), Bradley (Lynn), Melissa (Jon) Monge and Michael (Angela); his 9 grandchildren that he adored and loved interacting with, Caleb, Kennedy and Kathryn Monge, Camryn and Logan Ford, Elliot and Nolan Ford, Huck and Theo Ford; his mother and step-father, Donna (Don) Mason; mother-in-law, Lorraine Engelen; siblings, Debbie (Rich) Kappel and David (Ellen) Ford; sisters-in-law, Jan (Jeff) Engelen, Laura Engelen and Karen Looye; brother-in-law, Mark Engelen; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, Robert; brother-in-law, Eric Looye; and father-in-law, Eugene Engelen.\n\nFriends are welcome to visit with Bob’s family on Saturday, April 24, from 9:30 a.m. until the time of the funeral service at 11 a.m. at Harvest Bible Chapel, 580 Tracy Tr., Crystal Lake. Interment will be held at a later date at Lake View Cemetery, Calumet, MI."
