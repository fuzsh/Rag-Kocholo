        "text": "Peacefully surrounded by family on the early morning of July 5th, 2023, in his 90th year. Best known as Hugh or Colonel, he was born May 23, 1934, and was the cherished son of the late Jean (Ford) and Frederick Gamble of Ottawa. Predeceased by his beloved wife Carol (Kerrigan) and first wife Elizabeth (Barber). Dear father to Sue (Hazen) Bazinet, Julia (Jeff Woods) and Heather (Mike Crozier). Devoted grandfather of Kristen & Courtenay Bettinger (Riley Culbert), Gavan Bazinet, Jacob & Jonah Longpre. Great-grandfather of Cai Bazinet. Hugh had a long and distinguished career in both the Public Service and the Military. From his foundations at Agriculture Canada and by applying his BSc from Ottawa University, he founded the Emergency Planning Canada program and trained government officials worldwide from his college in Arnprior, for over 20 years. Starting as a cold war program, he sat on the NATO planning committee, and he would have been commandant of the Diefenbunker in the instance of war but it developed into natural disaster preparedness later known as Emergency Preparedness Canada. Concurrently he became the Commanding Officer of the 28th Ottawa Service Battalion, and the District Commander for Eastern Ontario Militia District (OMD), commanding thousands of troops and remained active as the unitâ€™s Honourary Colonel. He will be missed by many colleagues, family and friends.\n\nFriends are invited to Pinecrest Remembrance Services, 2500 Baseline Road on Friday July 14, 2023 at 11am. Interment and Reception to follow."
