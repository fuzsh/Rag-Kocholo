        "text": "Robert Ford is a career diplomat who in January became the first US ambassador to Syria since 2005 as Washington sought to re-engage with Damascus.\n\nOn 7 July, Mr Ford enraged the Syrian government by travelling to the restive city of Hama to show solidarity with residents who had held a series of massive protests despite a brutal crackdown by security forces.\n\nAfter he left the city the next day, hundreds of thousands of residents once again took to the streets to demand the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad, prompting an angry reaction from the interior ministry.\n\nA statement said Mr Ford had met \"a number of the saboteurs and incited them to more violence and protest and to refuse dialogue\", and was attempting to deepen discord and sedition among the Syrian people.\n\nThe US state department said it was \"dismayed\" and dismissed the complaint that it was a provocation as \"absolute rubbish\", insisting he had only \"witnessed average Syrians asking for change\".\n\nThree days later, government supporters attacked the US embassy, breaking windows and writing graffiti calling Mr Ford a \"dog\".\n\nPrior to entering the Foreign Service in 1985, he served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco.\n\nAfter an early career that took him to a number of cities worldwide, including Izmir, Cairo, Algiers and Yaounde, Mr Ford was appointed deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Manama, Bahrain, in 2001.\n\nConsidered one of the state department's most proficient Arabic speakers, following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 he was sent to the city of Najaf as the representative of the Coalition Provision Authority.\n\nIn June 2004, Mr Ford became political counsellor in Baghdad.\n\nThere, he rose to prominence by working with Iraqi officials on the January 2005 legislative elections, the establishment of the transitional government, the new constitution, and the October 2005 referendum.\n\nMr Ford also spearheaded efforts to persuade the Sunni Arab community to participate in the December 2005 elections. Following his intervention, there were much improved turnouts in several mainly Sunni provinces.\n\n\"We realised that we had really turned a corner with Sunni Arab communities,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"If you had told me we were going to get a voter turnout of 75% of Anbar, I wouldn't have believed it.\"\n\nIn 2005, his achievements were recognised when he was given the James Clement Dunn Award for Excellence in mid-level Foreign Service officers. The following year, he was named ambassador to Algeria."
