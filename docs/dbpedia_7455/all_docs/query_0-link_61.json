        "text": "ABOUT\n\nWelcome to Kinetoscope, a blog covering two hefty topics: film and TV. Itâ€™s where you can find regular reviews, lists and short essays about both the big screen and the small screen. The site is a joint effort between Robert Snow and Jason Chen.\n\nHow did the site start? Its origins are in a blog called Professionally Incoherent, started by Robert in 2011. After Robert and Jason met during their Master of Journalism studies at Carleton University, they had the idea to collaborate on the site together. Now they track the movie and TV industries under the Kinetoscope banner, writing reviews, articles and recording the occasional podcast to catalogue, evaluate and argue over the best and worst films and TV shows on offer.\n\nI'm just a thirty-something writer and videographer who thinks someone out there might like to read what I think about things.\n\nI was born in Clarenville, Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada, but grew up in the province's capital city of St. John's.\n\nI got hooked on movies and TV (even the oldies) at a young age, and I soon became curious about how entertainment is made, from script to screen.\n\nIt wasn't until high school that I found out how much I like to write. That was also when I caught the theatre bug - I performed in outdoor productions of the works of Shakespeare with a local company and did some short productions of sketch comedy with my high school drama club.\n\nI went to Memorial University of Newfoundland for my Bachelor of Arts, where I studied English literature, Classics, history and philosophy (I know, I know, it sounds pretentious). While I was at MUN, I loved the courses that let me write essays about movies, and I even learned a thing or two about shooting and editing my own stuff.\n\nWhen I graduated from Memorial, I figured I'd give journalism a try. So I completed the Master of Journalism program at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. From there, I moved into a career as a jack-of-all-trades digital media type, where I shoot, edit, design and play around with all sorts of fancy tech.\n\nMy idea to start a blog about movies and TV came when I found that I wanted my own place to share my thoughts on all the things I'm passionate about. I never expected how much fun it would be to interact with readers and other bloggers, and I've even had the chance to use the site to teach undergrad students how to blog.\n\nI live and work in the city of Toronto, which is (among other things) the movie and television capital of Canada. My dream jobs include movie marketing and professional movie reviewing, but for now, I'm helping build this site one post at a time."
