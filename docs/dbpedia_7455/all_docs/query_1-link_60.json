        "text": "Funeral services for Mr. Robert S. Ford, of Monroe, LA, will be held at 2:00 P.M. Wednesday, May 15, 2024, in the chapel of Mulhearn Funeral Home Sterlington Rd., Monroe, LA, with Rev. Warren Eckhardt officiating. Interment will follow at Mulhearn Memorial Park Cemetery in Monroe, LA. Visitation will be held from 1:00 P.M. until service time at the funeral home.\n\nRobert S. Ford, aged 62, entered Eternal Rest on May 10, 2024, due to complications arising from a recent surgical procedure. Mr. Ford was born in Dallas, Texas on December 4,1961, and shortly thereafter came with his mother and sister to Monroe, LA, where he lived the rest of his life.\n\nMr. Ford was the owner and sole proprietor of Robert’s Lawn Care, L.L.C. for many years. He possessed a relentless work ethic and personal drive as his many lawn care customers and personal friends will attest to.\n\nHe was an active member of North Monroe Baptist Church of Monroe, LA. He was known for his candor, kindness and generosity, often providing for others less fortunate than himself.\n\nRobert is survived by his mother, Christine Ford of Monroe, LA; his sister, Donna Ford (Paul) Hendricks of Richardson, Texas; his brother, Milam W. (Lisa) Ford of Baton Rouge, LA; 2 nieces, Madeline Ford and Ashley Hendricks (Andrew) Adrian; 2 nephews, Alexander Ford of Baton Rouge LA and Andrew Ford of San Jose, CA. He is preceded in death by his Father, Milton W. Ford of Monroe, LA.\n\nPallbearers will be Alexander Ford, Andrew Ford, Bobby Leith, Pete Caston, Andrew Adrian, and Milam Ford.\n\n“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.” (Colossians 3:23-24)"
