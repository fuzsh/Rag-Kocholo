        "text": "If this slice of Indian Ocean perfection looks familiar, itâs for good reason: not only is it one of the most photographed beaches in the world, it was the backdrop of Hollywood films such as Tom Hanks' âCast Away.â LâAnse dâArgent remains the Seychellesâ most popular stretch of shoreline, as its dazzling, reef-sheltered water and granite boulders atop bone-colored sand regularly prove too alluring to pass up.\n\nThe waters of this beach on the island of La Digue teem with marine life -- one can spot tropical fish and turtles without the need to swim or snorkel -- and its west-facing profile sets the stage for sensational sunsets. Novice swimmers and families with small children will feel at ease with the water depth, which is often no more than knee-high during low tide. While most visitors are ferry daytrippers, itâs worth staying on La Digue overnight to have more of it to yourself."
