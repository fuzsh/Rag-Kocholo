        "text": "In December of 2021, my friends Kris and Niko invited me to join them for a week of island hopping on a sailing catamaran in the Seychelles… and how could I say no? It sounds insanely luxurious, but the great thing about sailing with my Russian pals is that they fill the boat with friends, and everybody splits the cost (so it’s way more affordable than you’d imagine). After many sailing trips where I traveled alone from the USA to join Kris and Niko in the Mediterranean, I was finally able to convince my boyfriend Jason to join. Our hilarious and equally adventurous friend Kitao (who also happens to be an excellent cook) from Los Angeles jumped on board as well.\n\nGetting to the Seychelles is quite the marathon of flying. We flew nonstop from Los Angeles to Istanbul, Turkey (12-ish hours), and then from Istanbul to the Seychelles’ capital city/island of Mahe (another 8 hours). Jason and I spent a week shaking off the jet-lag and exploring Mahe, before meeting up with the rest of the group to sail. In popular yachting destinations like Greece, Italy and Turkey; you can charter a yacht and sail short distances each day to marinas and ports where there is convenient access to restaurants, and shops to resupply… but that’s not the case in the Seychelles. Although the Seychelles are a popular tourist destination, there is not a whole lot of options for shopping or dining outside of the capital city or resorts. Our week at sea required almost all provisioning be done in one shopping trip before leaving Mahe—which was no easy feat for 9 people for a week.\n\nWith our Fountaine Pajot Lucia 40 catamaran “Lucinda” fully loaded with food, water, snacks, supplies, 6 Russians, and us 3 Americans, we departed Eden Island marina for the wilder islands in the Seychelles archipelago. After many days of stormy weather and rough seas on Mahe, the sea was completely calm. There wasn’t the slightest whiff of wind, so we made the 5-hour long ocean crossing using the boat’s motor, rather than sailing. The charter company had provided us with a fishing rod and trolling lure, which we dragged behind the boat in hopes of snagging dinners during the week.\n\nPhotos shot on film & DJI Mavic Pro drone"
