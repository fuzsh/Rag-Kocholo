Besides the old coconut and vanilla plantations, the Plantation House and the Union Giant Rock can also be seen in the park, the latter of which is an enormous boulder that is more than 700 million years old. Another attraction is seeing how coconut oil is extracted from kopra with the help of an ox. Meanwhile, in terms of historical significance, the old cemetery which contains the remains of the island's first settlers can also be visited. Finally, the path through the park leads to one of the most-photographed beaches in the world, as well as one of the most beautiful to be found anywhere: Anse Source d'Argent. This located has been used for numerous adverts and films, including the 1984 film Cast Away. The park has an entrance fee of 150 SCR (approx. € 10), if you are staying on La Digue for a longer period, you can also purchase a permanent entrance ticket.\n\nLocation: L'Union Estate, La Digue (-4.362321, 55.825462)\n\nPhone: +248 4 23 42 40\n\nOpening hours: Mon - Sun: 7.00 - 17.00 Entrance Fee: 150 SCR\n\nVeuve Reserve, La Digue\n\nNature Reserve\n\n3.5 of 5 88 Reviews\n\nLocated at the centre of the island is the Veuve Reserve, the breeding ground of the famous Seychelles Paradise Flycatcher, a rare, endemic species of bird that is immediately-recognisable thanks to its deep blue colour. The information centre at the main entrance to the reserve is the only environmental office on La Digue, and offers literature about the Seychelles' nature, as well as guided tours by Seychelles experts (pre-registration required). Of course, you can also explore the park by yourself if you so wish without any danger of getting lost inside.\n\nLocation: La Digue Veuve Reserve, c/o National Park Authoirity, Anse Reunion, La Digue (-4.359097, 55.841244)\n\nPhone: +248 2 78 31 14\n\nOpening hours: Mon - Fri: 8.00 - 16.00\n\nPlantation House, La Digue\n\nMonument\n\n3.5 of 5 80 Reviews\n\nThis French colonial-style plantation house was first built in the 19th century in the l'Union Estate, and is one of the last jewels of its kind in the Seychelles. The house has a straw rood, and the steps on either side are typical of plantation houses such as this one. The house is also one of the oldest historical pearls of the Seychelles' Creole culture.\n\nLocation: L'Union Estate, La Digue (-4.359096, 55.841244)\n\nPhone: +248 4 23 42 40\n\nOpening hours: Mon - Sun: 7.00 - 17.00 Entrance Fee: 100 SCR\n\nEustache Sarde's House, La Digue\n\nMonument\n\nThis traditional wooden house is one of the last of its kind in the Seychelles. It was built in the early 20th century, and gives you an idea of how houses used to look back then. The wonderful wooden veranda is a real highlight, while the house was also designed to enable natural ventilation and air-circulation.\n\nLocation: Anse Réunion, La Digue (-4.359169, 55.825588)"
