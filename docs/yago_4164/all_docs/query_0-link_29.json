Caption: <b>Madame Noizeux</b>.\n\t\n\t<b>Paulette Noizeux</b> (1887–1971) was a French stage and film actress who began her career on the stages of France and New York in the 1910s. Her career spanned sixty years.\n\t\n\tBorn Marie-Paule Cœuré in Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais, France, Paulette Noizeux made her film debut in the 1911 Abel Gance-directed film short La Digue, opposite actors Jean Renoir and Jean Toulout. The film is notable for being Gance's directorial debut. In the early 1910s she acted in various films by Pathé Frères, such as Le roman d'un jeune homme pauvre (Georges Denola 1913), with Gabriel de Gravone and Henri Étiévant, and \n\tL'infamie d'un autre (Camille de Morlhon, 1914), with Charles Mosnier and Jean Kemm. While she did several subsequent films with De Morlhon, she was also reunited with Gance in L'énigme de dix heures (1915). Noizeux also played at Éclair, e.g. in La bergère d'Ivry (Maurice Tourneur, 1913), starring Renée Sylvaire. In 1915 her silent film career stopped.\n\t\n\tPaulette Noizeux would go on to have a prolific stage career in her native France, as well as appearing on Broadway in several plays from 1917 to 1918. From the 1930s Noizeux returned to the film sets but only in small parts and rather incidentally. Noizeux was married to stage and screen actor Noël Roquevert. Her last film appearance was a small part in Mais qui donc m'a fait ce bébé? (1971), in which her husband acted too. In the same year 1971 Paulette Noizeux died in Paris at the age of 83.\n\t\n\tSources: English and French Wikipedia, IMDB, Filmographie Fondation Seydoux Pathé.",
