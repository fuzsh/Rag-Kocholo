        "text": "Description\n\nAbout “Anse Source d’Argent, La Digue Island, Seychelles” and Merr Watson\n\n“To me, I just love the idea of turning my perception of everyday life and my surroundings into something so richly visually appealing, whether that’s a simple top down shot of my favourite local beach or creating a composite of shots that captures the vast beauty of an entire landscape from above. Being able to put a camera in a place I physically can’t get to, to capture something so incredibly magical is what blows me away with the art of aerial photography and what sparked my interest in the first place.”\n\nPrinting\n\nPhotos are printed on high quality paper at an art gallery that is specialized in printing, having their own equipment.\n\nEco-friendly\n\nPaper used for the prints is ecological and 100% recycled.\n\nShipping & Delivery\n\nEach order is unique and will be printed on request. That means that it takes some time to process the order. Once your product has been sent, you will receive a confirmation email.\n\nPlease check your contact details carefully when placing your order, so the courier company can contact you in case of unexpected circumstances.\n\nYou should receive your order within 2-10 business days.\n\nInternational deliveries can take a little longer than indicated, as this depends on various logistics partners and their affiliates. You can track the status of your order to be up to date and to be reassured that your order is on its way.\n\nShipping rates are indicated before placing the final order and payment, and these rates vary per location.\n\nTaxes\n\nFor all international orders, import taxes, duties and tariffs (if any) should be paid according to your country’s governing laws in order to clear customs."
