        "text": "it is Paradise, La Digue\n\nMy experience this one require some walking like before. I can reach it from both directions on foot, I came from Grande firstly then and Petite Anse. The walk wasn't easy since it required some hiking on the beach, in the woods, in water and over two hills for a few times. suddenly I came across and ask the guy selling coconut on Anse Petite to get on the right path almost lost. The walk from Anse Petite is about half an hour, including a few of different terrain. Along the way i encounter with some travelers too. Then everything get exciting. Do not wear your favorite white dress, since it will be dirty when you get there ü§£ü§£. We all reached Anse Coco atlast. It is a small beach with a natural pool at the other end. There was only a few people when we got there. One guy was selling coconut water, otherwise there will be just you, the beach and crystal clear water Which is really gorgeous üòç. Seychelles was a superb nature wonders !!! #ladigue #seychelles #africa\n\nladigue\n\nseychelles\n\nDolly Tan sri P\n\nLa Digue, the fourth largest island in Seychelles, still retains the most original islands. For this reason, it was listed in the National Geographic magazine as one of 50 his places to visit. The beaches on La Digue Island are almost all the best beaches in the world. In particular, De Agen Beach has been on the cover of countless travel magazines and is one of the most photographed beaches in the world. In 2011 it was Geography Magazine ranked first in the \"Top Ten Most Beautiful Beaches in the World\". La Digue Island has beautiful mountain views and charming beaches. The rock on the island is a granite island. The terrain is rugged, and the clouds are covered by fog. The trees are scattered and the scenery is quiet and beautiful. The beaches here are known for their emerald clear blue waves and strangely shaped shore stones. The boulder on the beach is peculiar and beautiful, and the film is very expressive. Especially the well-known De Agen Beach, with various shapes of boulders, one by one, the strange posture, the smooth lines, as if the craftsman of God has carved it carefully, exudes the charm of a \"male\" beach, exuding a kind of Thrilling beauty. La Digue Island to the pier. Another feature of the island is that it still retains the ancient and original mode of transportation. The island cannot drive, only cattle carts and bicycles. From the poetic Lapas harbour to the magical united manor, from the old preserved Creo house to the coconut processing plant, and the ancient and traditional ancient ships still docked by the sea, everything will evoke Our memories of the good life of the past.\n\njiajiatravel.\n\nWhere is Seychelles? This ultra-romantic island nation is located in the Indian Ocean in eastern Africa, close to Kenya. There is the world's smallest capital, which has been voted by the National Geographic magazine as the world's top ten most beautiful beaches, the beach of De Agen, where the beach is as fine as flour, and the water there is like a gem. Since returning from Seychelles, it has become one of the honeymoon holy places that I recommend to my friends. Because I am free of visas, I will leave. There is the world's natural heritage, Vallee de Mai. The park is full of huge sea coconut trees, and you can see the blushing sea coconut. There are colorful underwater creatures, diverse water activities, and the empty beaches to watch the sunset and see the Milky Way. The sea of Tahiti and sacks will never let you down.\n\nAngeline Yang."
