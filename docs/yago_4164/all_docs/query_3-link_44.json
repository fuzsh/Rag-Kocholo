        "text": "There is a total of 115 islands of which some are inhabited, and others are privately owned. These islands are world-renowned for being home to exquisite beaches, a gloriously sunny climate, natural beauty, rare wildlife, and mountainous rainforests. Simply put, for filmmakers looking to shoot on an island paradise, Seychelles is a perfect choice.\n\nThe weather is warm and inviting all year round, even during the rainy season (November to March). The geographic positioning off the East Coast of Africa means the archipelago is outside of the cyclone belt, so unlike with other tropical destinations, there is not a high risk of adverse weather. If your film project calls for underwater filming, water tends to be clearest from March through to May. Seychelles is a popular destination for surfers, many of which can be found enjoying the best white caps from May to September. At NEEDaFIXER, we have a global talent pool of fixers in a range of locations, including Seychelles. If your production company requires assistance with anything from location sourcing to obtaining permits, booking accommodation or arranging transportation, we are on hand to help.\n\nOur film fixers can help arrange many aspects of your upcoming production in Seychelles, whether you need a bit of assistance with small checklist items or support throughout the organisation of your entire shoot.\n\nThe abundance of natural beauty here makes this a great destination for filmmakers interested in wildlife and greenery, both on land and underwater. Documentary filmmakers, feature film directors and more besides can enjoy the many benefits of shooting a project here:\n\nCosts and financing. When it comes to filming in Seychelles, the fact that it’s an archipelago can drive the cost of production upwards. As there is little to no film industry and supporting infrastructure here, crew, cast and equipment must all be imported. Furthermore, pre and post-production facilities are not available on the islands. For these reasons, having a Seychellois fixer can be particularly beneficial to keeping the costs down. A local expert will be able to negotiate rates and offer support in getting you the best deal for your budget so you can focus your spending efforts effectively.\n\nFilm permits. It is relatively easy to obtain permission to film in Seychelles, and this is one of many things with which one of our fixers can provide assistance.\n\nCrews and talent sourcing. Local residents are available to work as extras, but generally speaking, directors, photographers and other crew members will need to be brought in from overseas for the shoot. If you require assistance with sourcing talent for your production, a fixer will be able to help.\n\nTravel. The islands are serviced by the Seychelles International Airport (Aéroport de la Pointe Larue), located on the main island of Mahé. A number of international flights make this island easy to reach, but travel by water may be necessary to reach other islands. Roads are generally up to high standards, making it easy to transport equipment and personnel once on land.\n\nTranslation. There are three official languages spoken in the Seychelles – English, French and Creole. The most commonly spoken language is a blend of the latter two, known as Seychellois Creole, but English is widely used following the archipelago’s time as a British colony. Most visitors get by with just English without any problems whatsoever, but a local film fixer can provide assistance with translation from Creole to English and vice versa.\n\nAccommodation. There is plenty of accommodation in the way of resorts, hotels and apartments in Seychelles. If you require help arranging a place to stay for the duration of your shoot, one of our fixers can assist.\n\nVisas. Visas are required for entry into Seychelles, but which type will depend on the country of origin. A fixer can help arrange the correct entry paperwork for all crew and cast members to ensure you can arrive and begin your shoot without any issues.\n\nSet construction and studio sourcing. There are no studios or backlots in existence at the moment; most shoots in Seychelles are location-based. Basic set construction can take place if you receive the necessary permission, but bringing in talent capable of building the sets will need to be brought in from overseas.\n\nTax Incentives and credits. There currently are no financial incentives or tax breaks for productions that film in Seychelles.\n\nSafety and travel advisories. Seychelles is a very safe archipelago not prone to any issues of volatility, making it a pleasant and safe filming destination.\n\nAt NEEDaFIXER, we have a global talent pool of fixers in a range of locations, including Seychelles. If your production company requires assistance with anything from location sourcing to obtaining permits, booking accommodation or arranging transportation, we are on hand to help."
