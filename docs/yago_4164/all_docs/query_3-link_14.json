        "text": "La Digue island stands out from the Seychelles archipelago thanks to the panoramic landscapes with soft sand, giant granite rocks, turquoise ocean waters, and vivid exotic greenery. The beauty of the pristine nature attracts photographers, film directors, and tourists there.\n\nGeneral information\n\nLa Digue is located 43 kilometers away to the northeast from Mahe ,it will take 3 hours by a ferry or 10 minutes by a helicopter to get there. The island was discovered in 1744 but got its name only 22 years later after the visit of a French sailor.\n\nThere are no industrial enterprises, and the small population of 2 500 people works only in the tourism industry offering all the necessary conditions for tourists.\n\nDue to the small size of the island, undeveloped road infrastructure, thick jungles, and plantations the locals use bikes, carts, and scooters.\n\nLa Digue beaches\n\nAnse Source D’Argent – the most popular beach on the island, considered one of the best in the world. You can see its brilliant landscapes in many photos and postcards.\n\nAnse Cocos is a very picturesque place. The beach has a half-moon shape, it is ideal for having a rest, photo and video shooting thanks to the rocks in the edges and tropical forest behind the shore.\n\nGrand Anse Beach is a perfect beach that will make you feel like on an uninhabited island. The strip of powder sand spreads for more than a kilometer, tall palms and tranquil surf create a very calm and peaceful atmosphere.\n\nTourist attractions\n\nOne of the most popular places to visit is a cabin built in the 18th century in a creole style. It is the house where they shot a famous film Emmanuelle.\n\nThe natural reserve Veuve is home for rare tropical birds. The bird lovers would be happy to see black paradise flycatchers as there are only a few hundreds of them in the whole world. Tourists also come there to get closer to tortoises, look at orchids, vanilla vines, Indian almond trees.\n\nThere is a giant granite rock on the western shore, a real treasure of the island and a national monument. It takes about half a hectare and is about 750 million years old.\n\nThe park with a farm of giant tortoises, plantation of vanilla and coconuts is near it - you can see the process of coconut oil production there.\n\nNid d’Aigle rock is 300 meters high with a marvelous view on the island from its top. You can reach the foot on a bike, and the hiking will be quite easy – all you will need is a pair of comfortable shoes.\n\nEntertainment\n\nSpend at least a few hours on one of the picturesque beaches: relax on the ocean shore, take photos like a professional photographer. Wait for low tide and walk far away along the beach – such an activity is calming and gives much energy.\n\nGo for a walk or ride a bike to explore the island, enjoy fantastic views and attractions.\n\nDiving and snorkeling are the most popular watersports on La Digue. The ideal conditions, about 30 sites and centers will help to see the rich underwater world of the Indian Ocean.\n\nTaste Creole cuisine at the local restaurants: traditionally cooked seafood, rice with Indian spices, fruits and vegetables, such popular drinks as rum and draft beer, tropical cocktails.\n\nMore interesting activities on La Digue:\n\n• Fishing in the ocean;\n\n• Surfing;\n\n• Sailing.\n\nLa Digue is the fourth biggest island of the Seychelles archipelago, but it does not mean that it is less important. Beautiful beaches, unusual entertainment, and unique attractions are definitely worth attention of an explorer of the hidden places in Seychelles."
