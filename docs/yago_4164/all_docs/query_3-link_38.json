        "text": "(Seychelles News Agency) - A new film titled ‘Seychelles From the Air’ created by a German-born naturalised Seychellois couple is now being screened in Seychelles and will soon be available online.\n\nThe 50-minute production, which captures Seychelles' natural beauty, was done by a local-based company, Greenhut Studio.\n\n‘Seychelles From the Air’ is the brainchild of a German-born couple, Werner Schulz and his wife, Doris.\n\nDescribed as a first for Seychelles, Werner, who settled with his family in the 115-island archipelago in the western Indian Ocean 42 years ago, said the production would appeal to both Seychellois and foreigners.\n\nThe film shows an aerial view of landscapes, beaches, villages and towns of the country’s three most populated islands -- Mahe, Praslin and La Digue. Schulz says the views have remained unseen up to now, except for helicopter pilots.\n\nThe film shows an aerial view of landscapes, beaches, villages and towns of the country’s three most populated islands -- Mahe, Praslin and La Digue.

(Werner Schulz) Photo License: All Rights Reserved\n\nSome 97 percent of the images have been shot with a camera drone, and others were filmed from the ground and even underwater when there was the need arose.\n\nThe project took around two years as the couple had to wait for the perfect weather conditions to fly and film the locations.\n\nGreenhut Studio is presently developing a website exclusively for the film and people can purchase their copy online.\n\nThe web address will be www.seychellesfromtheair.com. The film can be downloaded from there for $9.99. It can also be purchased as a standard DVD at a cost ranging from $15 to $22, and as a full HD on a USB pen drive for $19 to $26.\n\nThe Greenhut Studio has done other productions including Seychelles first and only international award-winning tourism film entitled, ‘Seychelles – Another World’ in 2008.\n\nTwo of its environmental documentaries are being screened on board Air Seychelles’ inflight entertainment system."
