        "text": "La Digue Island – Travel Guide\n\nLa Digue Island is the third most populated of Seychelles. It is the smallest of the three main islands in Seychelles, with a population of 2000. If you stay here even for a day, you will run into the same people quite a few times. La Digue is laid-back, with just a handful of motor vehicles on the road. People either walk or ride bicycles, thereby giving a relaxed vibe.\n\nBoasting one of the world’s most photographed beaches, Anse Source d’Argent, the island oozes charm. Your trip to Seychelles is not complete without visiting La Digue. La Digue is the definition of allure. People generally plan a day trip here either from Mahe or Praslin even though the fascinating island is worth spending a couple of days or more. I want to go to La Digue again and stay for a week or more…just to enjoy nature and do nothing.\n\nA fun fact\n\nSeychelles is a Malaria free country. Yes, you read that right. Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the malaria parasite by their bite, are present almost throughout the world. Only five areas are exceptions: the Antarctic and Iceland, where there are no mosquitoes at all, New Caledonia, the Central Pacific islands, like French Polynesia, and Seychelles in the Indian Ocean.\n\nFor Flight Recommendations, the Best time to visit Seychelles Foreign Exchange, Visa, Itinerary, Mobile Network, Language Barrier, Culture in Seychelles, Food in Seychelles, Driving in Seychelles, Important tips, please refer to Mahe Island – The busiest yet laid-back\n\nAccommodation in La Digue Island\n\nYou can get a decent apartment for approx 80-100 Euros per night. La Digue is expensive as accommodation options are limited here as compared to Mahe and Praslin. I stayed at Elje Villa, Anse La Reunion.\n\nHow to reach La Digue Island\n\nThere is only one international airport in Seychelles, which is in Mahe. Thus, you can either take a helicopter or ferry to La Digue.\n\nIt is advisable to book your ferry tickets in advance, although I could see the tickets being sold on the spot as well. Nevertheless, it is better to buy in advance rather than disturb the itinerary at the end moment. I booked my ferry tickets through Cat Cocos.\n\nGood to know: Put the valuables in your carry bags. The staff will ask you to check in your big suitcases and handbags. They will allow carrying a small light bag.\n\nConveyance from La Digue Jetty\n\nAs mentioned in my earlier blog on Mahe, driving is the way to travel around in Seychelles. But, it is the bicycle that you have to ride to explore La Digue. You can rent one from the jetty itself or request one from your host. The rent is approx 9-11 Euros a day, if you take a taxi to your accommodation, the minimum fare would be around 5-6 Euros.\n\nGetting around in La Digue\n\nThe best is to walk or cycle. As mentioned above, you can rent a bicycle either from the jetty or your host for 9-11 Euros a day. You could also hire a taxi or an ox cart, but both options are too expensive. Nevertheless, Cliff Pirame is a reliable taxi service. But, book them well in advance. The fare ranges from 120-150 Euros per day.\n\nGood to know: Do check with your hotel/host if they provide complimentary bicycles and transfer service from the jetty.\n\nGood to know: It is better that you rent a bicycle from the jetty itself. This way you would save on the taxi fare.\n\nGood to know: It is best to rent a car in Mahe and Praslin.\n\nExploring La Digue Island – Top things to do\n\n1. L’Union Estate Park\n\nThe estate is situated in L’Union Village and is the biggest building on the island belonging to France Alber Rene, the former president of Seychelles. The park is a national reserve. You need to pay an entrance fee of approx 6 Euros at the park entrance. The ticket gives access to tourist attractions inside the park and is valid for the whole day.\n\na. Anse Source d’Argent\n\nHave you ever seen beautiful photos of beaches and wondered if beaches like this exist in the real world? Well, you will believe it when you visit Anse Source d’Argent.\n\nThis picturesque beach seems to be decorated by mother nature herself with every rock, tree, and granite boulders being unique and spectacular. The crystal clear turquoise water adds immensely to the beauty. You feel like you are in the arms of nature. The length of the beach, with small bays, is about a kilometer. Every 100-150 meters provides a different view. The beach is perfect for snorkeling.\n\nMovies like Crusoe, Emmanuelle, and Cast Away have been shot here.\n\nGeneral tips for Source d’Argent\n\nTry to visit the beach before 11 am (access to the beach opens at 7 am) to avoid the daytrippers crowd from Mahe and Praslin. You will have the beach to yourself to click on enviable photos.\n\nWear sunscreen all the time, just like at any other beach.\n\nWear rubber slippers/shoes to protect your feet against corals.\n\nCarry your snorkeling kit as the beach is excellent for the activity.\n\nb. Giant Union Rock\n\nIt is the largest contiguous granite rock on Earth and is said to be over 700 million years old. Climb the mountain to enjoy a beautiful sunset from its summit.\n\nc. Rare Aldabra Giant Land Tortoises\n\nThe main population (some 100000) of the Aldabra giant tortoises resides on the islands of the Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles. You can find a few of these species in a small enclosure in the park. A board near the enclosure said that these tortoises were between 30-100 years old. I was amazed to see the tortoises as I had never seen such giant ones before. It was lovely feeding them though I felt sorry for them as they cannot go out of that enclosure.\n\nd. Coconut plantation\n\nIt is like any other coconut plantation. However, you should find joy in small things too. Well, I plucked a coconut from the tree and had it. Yes, a couple of kind Indians, who were the caretakers as well, helped me. So, I had fresh coconut water on the farm itself.\n\ne. Vanilla Plantation\n\nThis was one of the things that were fascinating to me, and I was very keen on visiting. I had heard that one could smell a strong vanilla fragrance as soon as one enter the plantation. But unfortunately, the harvesting season is from May to August. However, the caretaker showed me the flowers of the plants, which had a vanilla fragrance. So, I was not very disappointed.\n\nf. Coconut Mill\n\nHere it is shown how they process green coconuts to make coconut oil. Also, they use the residue to make toilet paper and pot scrubbers. You can skip that if you want to spend more time on the beach.\n\ng. House of the owners of the plantation\n\nThat is a 19th-century house, which was used for the Emmanuelle movie. The house was under renovation and therefore was not open to visitors.\n\nGood to know: There is a small souvenir shop inside the park itself. The is a fixed price here. You can buy vanilla essence, coconut face scrub, and nutmeg from here. I bought these, and I do not regret them at all. Vanilla essence is the best since it is directly from the farms. Just one small drop will bring out the flavor.\n\n2. Cycle around and explore La Digue Island\n\nWell, this was the best part of my Seychelles trip. Apart from beaches, there is so much more beauty this island has to provide. Given that it is less than 5 km from north to south, the best and most enjoyable mode to get around is on foot or bicycle. I was staying on the western tip of the island. Therefore, I could easily bike toward the east and then toward the north. The path is pleasing to the eyes, ears, and heart.\n\nI wish I could explain to someone else’s eyes how hypnotizing the pathway was. I wish I could explain to someone else’s ears how the sound of the ocean waves and breeze on a peaceful island recharged my mind. I wish I could explain to someone else’s heart how the charm of the island sank deeper in my heart with every heartbeat.\n\nIt does get a little difficult to cycle at some points, but as they say – A difficult road often leads to a beautiful destination…\n\nBelow are the photos of what I encountered on my way to the northern tip of La Digue Island.\n\n3. Other beautiful beaches on La Digue Island\n\nIf you have time in hand, there are several other beaches on the island.\n\na. Grand Anse\n\nIt is considered one of the most beautiful beaches in La Digue. The beach is good for surfing and sunbathing.\n\nb. Petite Anse\n\nSome people suggest that Petite Anse is more beautiful than Grand Anse, thanks to its incredible scenery.\n\nc. Anse Severe\n\nIt is one of the most renowned beaches, thanks to its incredible sunset views. The beach is equally beautiful during the day, with shallow, calm water and excellent views of the ocean and of Praslin. The beach is great for swimming and snorkeling.\n\nA few other are Anse Banane, Anse Cocos, Anse Fourmis, Anse La Reunion etc.\n\nLa Digue Island is one of those destinations where I would like to go back. It is a different world there. The air is pure and fresh. Moreover, people here do not leave in a culture full of hares.\n\nPlease join my mailing list (at the bottom of the home page), and stay tuned for more stories.
