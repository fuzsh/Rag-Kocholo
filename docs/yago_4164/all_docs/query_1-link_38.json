        "text": "Emmanuelle | 1974\n\nThe film that defined 70s soft-core – all lacy dresses, wicker chairs and vaseline on the lens – as the wife of a French Embassy official explores the possibilities of tasteful sex in ‘Siam’.\n\nThe Bangkok scenes were filmed on location in the rather conservative country after proffering to the authorities a watered down script which didn’t include the rude bits, but much of the film was made in an old Plantation House on the island of La Digue in the Seychelles. The smallest of the three main inhabited islands, La Digue has a population of only 2,000 people. With no airport and a mere handful of road vehicles, it's an extremely laid back place, but has some of the most beautiful beaches in the Seychelles.\n\nThe house stands on the road between the main, and only, town of La Reunion and the main beach at Grand Anse.\n\nThe 1978 British spoof, Carry On Emmannuelle (possibly the worst of the much-loved Carry On... series), had to use the awkward spelling of âEmmannuelleâ to avoid copyright problems.\n\nThis is a basic entry and due to be expanded."
