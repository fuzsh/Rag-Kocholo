        "text": "Accessible via a lovely shaded path, Anse Source d’Argent is one of the most beautiful beaches on La Digue and in the world. You will discover turquoise and translucent water, white and powdery sand, scattered with multiple boulders sculpted over time by the wind and water.\n\nBordered by a crystal clear lagoon on one side and lush tropical vegetation on the other, Anse Source d’Argent is one of Seychelles’ greatest treasures.\n\nThe beach you were dreaming of when you picked Seychelles. Anse Source D’Argent, maybe one of the most photographed beaches in the world, has been featured in several films, commercials, and television shows due to its pure white sand and unusual stones. Imagine heaven, and it’s likely to look something like this.\n\nIsolated from the rest of the world as if it had to be preserved, the bay changes its appearance with the passing of the hours and the tides. Discover it in the morning before 9 am and in the evening after 5 pm to make sure you are safe. As the sun rises or sets, you will have the opportunity to admire the rocks, the sea, and the sky with their sumptuous reflections. It’s hard not to be captivated by the charm of the place, with the sound of the waves, the songs of the birds, and the rustle of the coconut trees in the background.\n\nBut does it live up to the hype? Yes, but perhaps it is a victim of its own success.\n\nThe Best experience is at Low Tide\n\nIt really is a stunning sight, but good timing is essential: it can all but disappear at high tide, and it can get very busy in the middle of the day. Yet the crystal clear turquoise waters and pristine sand are truly breathtaking, and it is easy to spot fish swimming in the shallow around the reef without so much as a mask or snorkel – lucky visitors may even spot a sea turtle swimming off the shore! Swimming is difficult due to the shallow water, but it is feasible to wade out into the seas to observe the marine life, and it is a good snorkeling area.\n\nThe sheer popularity of this beach on La Digue does mean that it is very rare you would find it as empty as on the Bounty ad or film that made it so famous, and this can alter your perception of a place, so we’d advise planning your trip to avoid the crowds. It’s best visited in early in the morning before the daytrippers from Mahe and Praslin arrive, though it’s worth checking the tide times too. It would be an incredible place to watch the sunset slowly on the island of Praslin, but sadly the Union Estate which you must pass through to reach the beach closes its gates at 5 pm.\n\nSource d’Argent is a long beach\n\nIf you decide the crowds are just a bit too much for you, it’s worth pointing out that the beach extends past the first set of boulders, and many tourists only make it to the first little cove. Carry on along the beach to the south, either walking through the shallow waters or taking the path along the back of the beach, and you’ll reach a much larger bay. Here the added space makes it feel more deserted, and on the way, there are numerous spots between boulders you can make your own if you prefer a bit more privacy.\n\nA part of the Source d’Agent is the Anse Pierrot\n\nThe last, easily accessible dream bay is Anse Pierrot. This is the beach where most holidaymakers end up after their walk. A small drawback is perhaps the somewhat narrow strip of sand. At low tide, of course, this is not a problem, but as soon as the tide comes in, the waves push the holidaymakers further and further up.\n\nAt the southern end of Anse Pierrot, a path leads into the forest. Because it should somehow lead to the southern bays, we try our luck. Unfortunately, the path soon turns into a trail, the course of which is difficult to find.\n\nIs Source d’Argent good for snorkelling?\n\nYes, absolutely. Although small turtles are uncommon, you can witness a variety of fish like butterflyfish, porcupinefish, Moorish idols, and damselfish. Because the water is shallow, you should take your time exploring the rocky crevices, where you’ll find little moray eels, groupers, pipefish, and hermit crabs. Undoubtedly, a large and not especially timid batfish will swim up to greet you. By not feeding them, you are allowing them to return to their natural state.\n\nWhether you can cross the reef and explore the other side depends on the tides. This alternative is only for experienced snorkelers, and it should be done only when the sea is calm and the currents are light. The marine life is comparable to that of other parts of the island.\n\nWhere to stay on La Digue Island?\n\nLa Digue Island Lodge\n\nThe Seychelles’ La Digue Island Lodge offers a unique vacation. The hotel is surrounded by beautiful gardens, the Indian Ocean, and the white sand of Anse Reunion Beach, all of which add to the property’s stunning natural beauty. Source d’Argent is just 5 minutes away, if you book a Union Chalet at L’Union Estate you can walk in a few minutes to Source d’Argent.\n\nWe’re confident you’ll appreciate the wonderfully traditional Creole architecture here, which is complemented by light and airy furnishings that will make you feel right at home. You’ll be treated to fantastic rustic luxury and style whether you select a beach hut, a quiet room in the Beach House, or a magnificent bungalow in L’Union Estate Park.\n\nLe Domaine de l’Orangeraie\n\nLe Domaine de l’Orangeraie is a lovely boutique resort perched above a beautiful beach on La Digue’s northwestern hillside. From the L’ Orangeraie hotel you need about 15 minutes by bicycle to read Union Estate and Source d’Argent.\n\nThere are a variety of activities available, such as watersports and the ability to rent bicycles, but if you just want to relax, head to the beach or the Eden Rock Wellness Centre for spa treatments. Two restaurants on the premises serve Mediterranean and Creole-inspired cuisine.\n\nMore about: Le Domaine de l’Orangeraie\n\nPatatran Village Hotel\n\nPatatran Village is tucked into the hillside with wonderful views across the ocean and is built on the rocks that frame Anse Patate, on the north tip of La Digue. iclist need abot 30 minutes to reach Source d’Argent.\n\nThe main building, which houses suites and two restaurants, has a beautiful view of the sea and the gorgeous swimming pool. A little sandy beach tucked among granite boulders, suitable for snorkeling, can be found here.\n\nMore about: Patatran Village Hotel\n\nHow to get to Anse Source d’Argent beach?\n\nThe helicopter landing pad is a 15-minute bike ride south from the jetty along the coastal road. This is where the L’Union Estate Park begins, which you must cross. The admission cost is 115 Scr per person and is good for the full day (including multiple entries and exits).\n\nIndividual stations of traditional coconut oil production, vanilla plantations, a medicinal plant garden, and huge tortoises may all be found in the park.\n\nThe route terminates at an open beach restaurant catering to tour groups shortly after the enormous rock boulder at L’Union Estate Farm and the turtle enclosure. Those who arrived by bicycle are required to leave it here. Swimming is difficult due to the shallow water, but it is feasible to wade out into the seas to observe the marine life, and it is a good snorkeling area."
