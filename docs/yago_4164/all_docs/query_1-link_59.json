        "text": "Emmanuelle, friend of the Seychelles\n\nSometimes, the world of cinema upsets the balance of an entire island. When a hundred stagehands arrive on La Digue, it's bound to cause a stir. Hotels are taken by storm; available vehicles are requisitioned... The island takes on the appearance of a studio! François Leterrier, with his erotic film Goodbye Emmanuelle, was the first, in 1976, to enrich the Republic of Seychelles, founded that same year. The superb Creole house of Emmanuelle, on La Digue, became the second home of ex-president René, who invited his friends and illustrious visitors to the archipelago, such as Tony Blair. The rupees began to fall. The producer of Pirates (1986) paid over $300,000 for a few scenes, and Crusoe (1988) cost the Seychelles over a million dollars. The local workforce also benefited, thanks to the construction of an estaminet for the film Pirates, which required the help of eighty workers. For a single scene in Cast Away (2000, starring Tom Hanks), fifty fishing boats were hired. Natives also benefited from extra work: more than sixty took part in the filming of Pirates, and were well paid.\n\nIn-house success"
