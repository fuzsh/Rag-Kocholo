        "text": "Our beaches are as unique and individual as our people. Some of our beaches are remote and not frequented by many so go ahead, find the beach that ticks all the right boxes and stake your claim! Wherever you settle, the azzure waters will be warm and welcoming, watch out for some beaches at the south of the island however as there are powerful currents.\n\nThis beach is part of the L'Union Estate, a plantation open to the public. Along its shore are the secluded L'Union Estate Chalets where famous names such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair have holidayed. The small boat-building yard, a traditional craft of La Digue, also used to share its shores but is now sadly closed.\n\nAnse Source d'Argent is reputed to be the most photographed beach in the world. With its soft white sand, clear turquoise water and huge granite boulders sculptured by the elements and time itself, it is not difficult to see why photographers and film makers still love to come here. The sea is sheltered by the reef, and is very calm and shallow, with only sand underfoot which makes it safe for children.\n\nWhen walking along the famous Anse Source d'Argent, continue across the small river until you reach anse Pierrot. This beach is slightly narrower than Anse Source d'Argent and its rock are less photogenic, but it has the same shallow warm waters and the advantage of privacy. Anse Severe is a quiet spot, well suited for sunbathing and swimming. It is the first beach that you will come to along the road if you turn left from the jetty. There are two small hotels along its shore, but the beach is never busy."
