        "text": "The director for pollution control, Flavie Joubert, confirmed this Thursday evening when Nation called his section to find out what initial reports erroneously suggested was an oil spill.\n\nMr Joubert said that his section was informed of the problem by a tourist.\n\n“We have already dispatched people on foot and the police are on their way too. We have also sent other teams on boats on a reconnaissance mission,” he said, but later reported that only a thin and narrow yellow film of oil was seen on the beach.\n\n“We believe it is a form of lubricating oil rather than fuel, and fortunately, the sand does not seem to be badly contaminated which would have been a more serious problem,” Mr Joubert told Nation.\n\nHe said that teams to clean up the beach were being organised, and they would continue the work this morning if necessary."
