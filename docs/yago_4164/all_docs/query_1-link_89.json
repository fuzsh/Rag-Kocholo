        "text": "All aboard the Hot Mess Express because Below Deck Down Under is back for Season Three, and we can’t wait!\n\nDespite rumours the hit show would be cancelled after its second season saw several instances of sexual misconduct, Bravo confirmed that BDDU would be back for another run.\n\nWhilst little has been confirmed about the upcoming season, several cast members have been leaked as well as a potential filming location.\n\nIf you love a lil’ spoiler action, keep scrolling to find out everything we know about Below Deck Down Under Season Three!\n\nWhich cast mates are joining Below Deck Down Under?\n\nAccording to Reality Tea, Season Three will see three returning cast members and seven new yachties take the high seas.\n\nCaptain Jason Chambers confirmed he’d be gracing our screens again during an interview with InTouch in December 2023.\n\nBeloved chef Tzarina Mace-Ralph and deckhand Harry Van Vliet, who both appeared in Season Two, are also said to return to the show.\n\nReality Tea also dropped seven names rumoured to join the crew next year, including Tzoni Arvanitis (Bosun), Wihan Du Toit (Deckhand), Adair Werley (Deckhand), Nicolas Cattelan (Deckhand), Brianna Duffield (Stew), and Marina Marcondes (Stew).\n\nLara Rigby is also tipped to be the Chief Stew after Aesha Scott made the move to Below Deck Mediterranean. However, her social media appears to have been deactivated since she was rumoured to join the cast.\n\nWhere is Below Deck Down Under Season Three filmed?\n\nOne eagle-eyed fan took to Reddit after spotting a film crew in La Digue, Seychelles, a small country in East Africa.\n\n“Walking along Anse Source D’Argent yesterday and came across the crew filming around a lunch table for an ‘unnamed boat show’ to air in the future. The cameramen had hats with Below Deck written on the back,” they wrote.\n\nAnother user responded, stating they’d got details about a “potential casting” for the show, confirming the crew was for BDDU Season Three.\n\n“They’ll be filming for another two weeks there,” they added. And we think this is an interesting choice of location, given the show is meant to be set in Australia.\n\nHowever, per Reality Tea, a production insider told the New York Times that fans should expect a HUGE shakeup on the Aussie rendition of the reality show. So, time will tell!\n\nWhat else do we know about Below Deck Down Under Season Three?\n\nAccording to Reality Tea, Nikita Sachdev, the founder of Luna Media Group, could be a charter guest on the upcoming season of BDDU.\n\nThe entrepreneur shared snaps on a yacht around the time of filming, and one was captioned: “In love with #seychelles.”\n\nCaptain Jason and the leaked crew are also reportedly following her and the people she travelled with.\n\nJessica Weldon, another potential charter guest, has also shared snaps on the sea, tagging Seychelles as the location.\n\nThese sneaky pics also showed off the show’s new yacht, Katina.\n\nWatch this space for more updates!\n\nWant even more goss?
