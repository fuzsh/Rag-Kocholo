        "text": "EUSTACHE SARDE’S HOUSE\n\nPredominantly a timber constructed house, it is no doubt one of the real remaining example of its kind in Seychelles. Dating from the early 20th Century, it was constructed with almost geometrical precision and refinement. The house once stood on large masonry pillars, but now rests on a habitable concrete basement. It has façade verandah, with ornamental wooden balusters mansards on its roof providing adequate and habitable attic space. The design has been conceived in such way as to allow natural ventilation.

It features on many of the promotional brochures. Ile Cocos Marine National Park is set around 3 small islets in shallow turquoise sea fringed by large expanses of coral reefs that provide the most breathtaking snorkeling experience. Visits to the island can be organized with ground operators and taxi boats on Praslin and La Digue.\n\nL'UNION ESTATE\n\nTake a step back in time and visit L'Union Estate – see a traditional copra mill and kiln (kalorifer), watch the antics of the estate’s population of giant land tortoises or stroll around the majestic Plantation House framed by giant granite boulders in landscaped gardens, or go horse back riding. The estate is also home to the cemetery of the original settlers of La Digue and to one of the most pristine beaches in Seychelles – the legendary ‘Source d'Argent’ – among the most photographed beaches on earth.\n\nPLANTATION HOUSE, LA DIGUE\n\nThis attraction forms part of L’Union Estate and is yet another architectural gem among the few plantation houses left in Seychelles. Said to be one of the oldest, the Plantation House is the focal point of L’Union Estate, which originally belonged to the wealthy Hossen family, who came to Seychelles from Mauritius in the 19th century. It is built in French colonial style, with the ground floor made of timber boarding laid on floor joists. The house has a thatched roof, supported by ridge-poles and rafters probably of capucin or takamaka hard wood, which were commonly used in the early years of the 20th century. The flights of steps on all four sides are an essential feature of a plantation house of this period. The house was used several years ago for the shooting of the film Goodbye Emmanuelle and is one of the cherished historical souvenirs of Seychelles’ Creole heritage.
