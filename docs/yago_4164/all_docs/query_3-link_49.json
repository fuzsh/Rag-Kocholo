        "text": "The beaches of the Seychelles are certainly among the most beautiful beaches in the world, with the turquoise blue water, powdery sand and the fascinating granite rocks. What we particularly liked about the Seychelles is the fact that all the beaches here are public, i.e. even if the beaches are located on the grounds of hotels, you can enter them (partly with prior permission). On the island of La Digue there are numerous beaches, some of which we have visited.\n\nA map of the most famous beaches on La Digue\n\nOn the following Google MyMaps map we have mapped the most famous beaches we have looked at on La Digue. Another very good and detailed overview of the beaches can be found on the page of SeyVillas.\n\nThe most beautiful beaches on the island of La Digue\n\nWe have explored the beaches of La Digue on our own as well as on various other paths. For example, as part of a Sunset boat tour with Jonathan from Liberty Charter, where we have circumnavigated the entire island in 1.5 hours…\n\n… and during our hike around the south coast of La Digue to Anse Marron with Gerard from CocoTrail Guide…\n\n… and as part of our “Robinson Crusoe Tour” with Crystal Water Kayaks.\n\nThese tours can be booked via the platform TourBookers.com. The German agency offers over 750 tours, activities and experiences in different countries on its online platform. The tours are offered and arranged directly online by a number of independent local tour operators.\n\nThe Anse Coco\n\nThe Anse Coco is located in the east of La Digue and is best reached by bike from the west coast. The bike can then be parked at the Grand Anse and from here follows the approximately 40-minute hiking trail to Anse Coco. You will be rewarded with a 450-metre-long, bright white sandy beach with natural pools and turquoise blue water. As is so often the case in the Seychelles, the Anse Coco is an absolute dream beach. Due to the seclusion there are not quite as many visitors here, so you will always find a nice quiet place to relax.\n\nThe Petite Anse\n\nThe Petite Anse is also best reached via its big brother, the Grand Anse, via a hill of rocks within about 15 minutes on foot. The 400 meter long beach with its fine sand and water colours offers a dreamlike backdrop – however, one should take care when bathing, as the sea drops steeply and there is no offshore reef.\n\nThe Grand Anse\n\nWhen we visited the Grand Anse in the early hours of the morning, there was no human soul here, only a decorated wedding pavilion stood alone in the powder-sugar-soft sand. When do you have such a dream beach completely on your own? The beach is about 450 meters long and framed on both sides by photogenic rock formations. Similar to the Petite Anse, the sea at Grande Anse drops just as steeply and there is no offshore reef. As a result, the waves here can be very high and the currents dangerous.\n\nTip: Just keep your eyes open for traces of turtles. Here at Grand Anse we have discovered the traces of a turtle in the sand, which probably came to the beach at night for egg laying and which we only missed by a few hours.\n\nThe Anse Songe\n\nThe Anse Songe is a small, wild beach with many rocks. Due to its remoteness, there are hardly or never any people to be found here. On the granite rocks we have found some old crab shells, which are the remnants of the skinning process of the crabs.\n\nThe Grand l’Anse\n\nIf you continue from The Anse Songe on the coast towards the south, you reach the Grand l’Anse. The beach is very long, but due to the strong surf and the rocky ground less suitable for bathing.\n\nThe Anse Marron\n\nAs part of our hike with Gerard from CocoTrail Guide we were able to visit the Anse Marron and were just back and forth: The Anse Marron is a dream beach that is unparalleled – as from the picture book! It is located at the southernmost tip of La Digue, which can only be reached by boat or by several hours of hiking.\n\nThe Anse Marron consists of two beach sections, which are separated by several granite rocks: the first section is a white little beach, where the sea quickly becomes deep and the waves come in unprotected. At the second part of the beach, sheltered between granite rocks, there is a natural lagoon pool with crystal clear water and lots of small fish. At Anse Marron we were also lucky enough to see a sea turtle laying ❤\n\nThe Anse Pierrot\n\nAnse Pierrot is a secluded beach in the southwest of La Digue, where the film Robinson Crusoe was shot in 1980. The often deserted beach offers the perfect backdrop for a few relaxing hours and is very suitable for swimming and snorkeling due to the shallow sea and the few waves.\n\nThe Anse Source d’Argent\n\nThe Anse Source d’Argent with its extraordinary granite formations is considered a dream beach and is regularly listed among the top 10 beaches worldwide. And precisely for this reason, the beach is a real visitor magnet for many day trippers from other islands and cruise guests. For us, the beach has lost some of its charm due to the large number of visitors, even if the scenery with the typical granite rock formations, the flat sloping beach and the turquoise blue water is of course fantastically beautiful.\n\nThe Anse Severe\n\nThe approximately 400 meter long Anse Severe is located at the northern tip of La Digue and is very suitable for swimming and snorkeling due to the shallow and calm sea. It is quite possible that you will encounter giant tortoises here on the beach – therefore absolutely keep your eyes open!\n\nThe Anse Gaulettes\n\nWe were able to see the Anse Gaulettes from the water during our boat trip around La Digue. It is located just east of the northern tip of the island and is easy to reach if you cycle around the north of the island. The narrow, about 800 meter long sandy beach is located between a small road and the sea. Since it is located a little away from the center of the island, you will meet very few people here.\n\nOur travelogues from the Seychelles\n\nWhite dream beaches, crystal clear water, sun and palm trees: the Seychelles are the epitome of an island paradise. For 2 weeks we explored the main islands of Mahé, Praslin and La Digue and saw the most beautiful sights: From gorgeous beaches, fascinating nature parks to hidden photo spots, animal islanders and beautiful viewpoints. » Seychelles: Things to know & Travel Tips (Mahé, Praslin & La Digue)\n\n» Seychelles: Travel Planning, Flight & Rental Car\n\n» Mahé: Things to know & places of interest\n\n» Mahé: Tropical Hideaway Apartement & Beau Vallon Beach\n\n» Mahé: Victoria – Things to do & beautiful photo spots\n\n» Mahé: The Rock Pool (Ros Sodyer) at Anse Takamaka\n\n» Mahé: Top 10 most beautiful beaches on the island\n\n» Cerf Island: Snorkeling in Sainte Anne Marine Park\n\n» Praslin: Things to know & places of interest on Praslin\n\n» Praslin: Acajou Beach Resort on the Cote d’Or Beach\n\n» Praslin: Fond Ferdinand – Coco de Mer Nature Reserve on Praslin\n\n» Praslin: Vallée de Mai – UNESCO National Park on Praslin\n\n» Praslin: Top 5 most beautiful beaches on the island of Praslin\n\n» Curieuse Island: A trip to the giant tortoises\n\n» Félicité: The luxury resort Six Senses Zil Pasyon\n\n» La Digue: Things to know & Travel Tips from the island of La Digue\n\n» La Digue: Cat Cocos Ferry & La Diguoise Guesthouse\n\n» La Digue: Crystal Water Kayaks – Transparent kayak tours on La Digue\n\n» La Digue: Anse Marron – Hike around the south coast of La Digue\n\n» La Digue: Top 10 – The most beautiful beaches on La Digue\n\n» La Digue: The resort Le Domaine de L’Orangeraie"
