        "text": "Arianne Mnouchkine has a way of merging theater and cinema so it becomes greater than either. Live actors as bunraku puppets manipulated by puppeteers in black so their movements are more puppet-like than natural. This heightens the action and creates a visual poem. The film cuts to actors reciting the lines offscreen breaking the fourth wall to remind one is watching a film. Some of the theatrical devices were so beautiful I was gasping. The story told is of greed where there is no justice. Ultimately, the film conveys a message that we are all puppets manipulated by what we do not comprehend."
