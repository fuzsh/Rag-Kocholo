        "text": "Eustache Sarde’s House La Digue\n\nIsland : La Digue\n\nType of Attraction : National Monument\n\nAddress : Anse Réunion, La Digue\n\nDescription:\n\nPredominantly a timber constructed house, it is no doubt one of the real remaining example of its kind in Seychelles.\n\nDating from the early 20th Century, it was constructed with almost geometrical precision and refinement. The house once stood on large masonry pillars, but now rests on a habitable concrete basement. It has façade verandah, with ornamental wooden balusters mansards on its roof providing adequate and habitable attic space. The design has been conceived in such way as to allow natural ventilation.\n\nText credit: National Heritage.\n\nGranite Boulder, La Digue\n\nIsland : La Digue\n\nType of Attraction : National Monument\n\nAddress : L'Union Estate, La Digue\n\nTel : +248 4 23 42 40\n\nFax : +248 4 23 40 05\n\nDescription:\n\nThis natural wonder forms part of L’Union Estate and is classified as a National Monument. Covering an acre of land at Anse L’Union on the west coast of the island of La Digue, it is by any standards an impressive monolith.\n\nThe granite boulder was formed during the Precambrian, around 750 million years ago, by the slow cooling of molten rocks (magma) deep within the earth’s crust which gave it its especially large crystals.\n\nThe granite boulder of Anse L’Union is a spectacular piece of natural sculpture brought forth from the womb of mother nature, its magnificent shape due to its long exposure to the sculpting forces of nature.\n\nText credit: “National Monuments of Seychelles” by National Heritage.\n\nL'Union Estate (attract. La Digue)\n\nIsland : La Digue\n\nType of Attraction : National Heritage Site, National Monument, Eco tourism site\n\nAddress : L'Union Estate, La Digue\n\nTel : +248 4 23 42 40\n\nFax : +248 4 23 40 05\n\nDescription:\n\nTake a step back in time and visit L'Union Estate – see a traditional copra mill and kiln (kalorifer), watch the antics of the estate’s population of giant land tortoises or stroll around the majestic Plantation House framed by giant granite boulders in landscaped gardens, or go horse back riding.\n\nThe estate is also home to the cemetery of the original settlers of La Digue and to one of the most pristine beaches in Seychelles – the legendary ‘Source d'Argent’ – among the most photographed beaches on earth.\n\nPlantation House, La Digue\n\nIsland : La Digue\n\nType of Attraction : National Monument\n\nAddress : L'Union Estate, La Digue\n\nTel : +248 4 23 42 40\n\nFax : +248 4 23 40 05\n\nThis attraction forms part of L’Union Estate and is yet another architectural gem among the few plantation houses left in Seychelles. Said to be one of the oldest, the Plantation House is the focal point of L’Union Estate, which originally belonged to the wealthy Hossen family, who came to Seychelles from Mauritius in the 19th century.\n\nIt is built in French colonial style, with the ground floor made of timber boarding laid on floor joists. The house has a thatched roof, supported by ridge-poles and rafters probably of capucin or takamaka hard wood, which were commonly used in the early years of the 20th century. The flights of steps on all four sides are an essential feature of a plantation house of this period.\n\nThe house was used several years ago for the shooting of the film Goodbye Emmanuelle and is one of the cherished historical souvenirs of Seychelles’ Creole heritage.\n\nText credit: “National Monuments of Seychelles” by National Heritage.\n\nVeuve Reserve\n\nIsland : La Digue\n\nType of Attraction : Nature Reserve, Eco tourism site\n\nAddress : La Digue Veuve Reserve, c/o National Park Authoirity, Anse Reunion, La Digue\n\nTel : +248 2 78 31 14\n\nFax : +248 4 23 43 52\n\nThe Veuve Information Centre is the only environment office on La Digue. The office manages the Veuve Reserve and the environment of La Digue and has available most information on the unique flora and fauna of La Digue especially of the Paradise Flycatcher or “Veuve”. They undertake regular monitoring of Paradise Flycatcher, rare Swiflets, Sea Turtles and once a year common Land Birds.\n\nOur staff is able to take you out for a short guided tour of the reserve to see nest sites and the elusive birds, or upon request to nature trails outside the reserve. Arrangements need to be made in advance.\n\nIn the near future the reserve would also be able to offer souvenirs, post cards and other items such as books."
