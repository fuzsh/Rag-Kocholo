P U T Z Birth Certiﬁcate: e Story of Danilo Kiš. By M T. Ithaca, NY, and London: Cornell University Press. .  pp. $; £.. ISBN –– ––. Mark ompson’s biography of Danilo Kiš, the ﬁrst published in English, serves to reintroduce the highly respected Yugoslav novelist and short-story writer to a new readership. Attentive to Kiš’s remark that ‘a biography of a writer is sheer reductionism if it has not experienced the grace of form’ (p. ), Mark ompson took this challenge as the task of his biography. However daring or experimental in its attempt, the book’s structure nevertheless falls short of a required ‘benediction of form’ (p. ). Birth Certiﬁcate is carefully craed and organized around Kiš’s two-page ﬁctionalized autobiography of the same title. His brief award acceptance speech has been dissected into small fragments, which are then applied as chapter headings, taken literally and meticulously annotated. e biography narrates his father’s Hungarian Jewish origin and his mother’s Montenegrin and Orthodox Christian background, comprising the subject’s ‘unresolved identities’ (p. ) and mirroring his Yugoslav inclinations. e narrative follows Kiš through his childhood in Hungary and Montenegro to his early student years in Belgrade, to the time he worked as a lector in Strasbourg, Bordeaux, and Lille, to his later years spent in Paris. e main contribution of ompson’s book is in the biographical material provided by people he interviewed: each of the phases of Kiš’s life is coloured by remarks and recollections made by dwellers in the Hungarian village in which the writer grew up, his students, internationally recognized writers, his companions and close friends. Discussions of Kiš’s major literary works interrupt the story of his life in seven instalments. Although informative and perceptive, these readings scarcely bring anything new to the scholarship, which is not necessarily expected from a biography of a writer. Still, one regrets that the book does not reﬂect some of the signiﬁcant changes within the s Yugoslav literary scene that created fertile ground for the formal literary experiments so characteristic of Kiš’s writing. ompson correctly remarks that Kiš ‘believed that all literature in Serbo-Croatian formed a whole’ and used for his own translations ‘the entire area and its literary heritage’ (p. ). Yet he neglects to examine the impact that important Yugoslav writers, such as Krleža, Andrić, Crnjanski, or Vinaver, had on the critical questions of language, poetics, and aesthetics tackled by Kiš, focusing instead on less relevant literary ﬁgures, such as the nineteenth-century Montenegrin writer Marko Miljanov (pp. –). More surprising is the biography’s oversight in failing to acknowledge Kiš’s membership in the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, which would have helped ompson to elucidate why this ‘passionately anti-nationalist’ (p. xi) writer would entrust his MLR, .,   books and papers to the institution ‘seen as Serbia’s heart of intellectual darkness’ (p. ). Sincerely invested in promoting one of Yugoslavia’s best writers as ‘a consummate standard of responsibility to language and society’ (p. ), ompson’s biography is written spiritedly and at moments artfully. Nonetheless, the roughly cut montage of biographical, encyclopedic, and critical fragments renders it stylistically and discursively uneven. For example, the discussion of Jovan Cvijić and Vladimir Dvorniković’s theories meshing with the biographical fact of Kiš’s infertility (pp. –) makes for a jarring juxtaposition. e book does not provide a clear and traceable chronology of Kiš’s life and œuvre. Instead, it convolutes these two, which may confuse readers lacking previous historical knowledge of the region and Kiš’s work. Most likely, the biography will ﬁnd its readers among a general audience less concerned with the book’s omissions and simpliﬁed approach, and more with the political role of writings from Central Europe and the Balkans.
