        "text": "The Yugoslav prime minister (and foreign minister), Milan Stojadinović, and Italian foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano, signed a friendship agreement on 25 March 1937, ushering in an atmosphere of confidence between the two formerly hostile countries. This rapprochement resulted from the changing international constellation: the resurgent Germany was expected to annex Austria and become a powerful neighbour to both countries. Ciano and Stojadinović struck close personal relations which no doubt buttressed the solidity of their agreement. Moreover, Ciano believed that Stojadinović was inclined towards authoritarian concept of power. There were also increasing signs that the Stojadinović regime was acquiring some fascist trappings in line with the new course of foreign policy. Indeed, Prince Regent, Paul, dropped Stojadinović from the government in February 1939 because he came to believe that his premier was intent on becoming a fascist dictator. This paper will explore whether there was substance to the often repeated accusations that Stojadinović was sliding towards fascism. Much of these accusations were centred on his foreign policy, especially his cordial relations with the fascist regime in Italy and, to a lesser extent, with Nazi Germany. Therefore, this paper will analyse, on the one hand, to what extent Stojadinović aligned Yugoslavia's conduct of foreign affairs with Rome's foreign policy and, on the other, to what degree the Yugoslav-Italian rapprochement was reflected in internal developments which might smack of fascism. The analysis will be undertaken with reference to the recent and influential theories of fascism.\n\nThe main focus of this thesis focuses on deconstructing and analysing the evolution of the different aspects of Dimitrije Ljotic’s ideological formation to show its relationship to his ZBOR movement and its development until his death in 1945. Ljotic’s ideological development and expression would show a marked syncretic and contradictory nature. This contradiction and incoherence stymies any definitive classification and categorisation of his politics. This creates difficulties in attempting to place ZBOR as a specific mono-ideological movement. This problem of categorisation will be reinforced through identifying and deconstructing the ideology of Ljotic and his ZBOR movement. It also will look at pre-existing ideological discourses that contributed to Ljotic’s ideas, including those of a wider European context of existing anti-democratic, anti-modernist, monarchist, and nationalist currents. The ideological and intellectual course of Ljotic, personified through the existence of ZB...\n\nThis paper analysis the policy of Milan Stojadinović, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1935–1939) towards the Croat question, i.e. the passive resistance with which the Croat Peasant Party led by Vlatko Maček opposed the Belgrade government, struggling for an autonomous status of Croatia. Based on the private papers of Stojadinović and Prince Regent, Paul Karadjordjević, the reports of the well-informed and shrewd British Minister in Belgrade, Ronald Hugh Campbell, as well as the rich literature on the Serbo-Croat relations in the Kingdom, this article attempts to examine Stojadinović’s approach to the Croat problem. It is argued here that Stojadinović’s treatment of the Croat question was closely related to his foreign policy, especially towards Italy and Germany.\n\nThis study elaborates the interaction between nationalism and religion in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between two world wars. It analyzes the relationaship between the Serbian Ortodox Church, representative of Eastern Christianity, and Serbian nationalism.Focusing on religion or Serbian Ortodox Church, discourse and dimensions of interaction between modern nation and modern nationalism have been explained. Due to the fact that so-called interaction affected both modernisation and secularisation processes, it has been a requirement to examine Church-State, Church- Nation interactions pertaining to de facto status, past and rhetorics of Serbian Ortodox Churh. However, evolution of nationalisation notion in what institutions through what incidents have been discussed within the framework of political history of The First Yugoslavia. In that sense, this study aims atanalyzing the events, commemorating ceremonies, myths and discourses about the interaction between Church and state, Church and Serbian identity with their political implications.\n\nThe Jewish Community and Antisemitism in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes/Yugoslavia 1918-1941The Jews in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes/Yugoslavia made up about 0.5 percent of the total population. The new national framework provided the ability to accept the new state and national idea, but also gave impetus to strengthening their own identity embodied in Jewish nationalism, Zionism. Jews adapted to the new political circumstances relatively quickly and without major turmoil, at least as a whole. A liberal political foundation enabled the Jews to identify relatively easily with the new state. However, over a shorter or longer period, there were earlier national identifications as well. The spread and acceptance of antisemitism in Yugoslavia was affected by different traditions of the attitude towards the Jews in the political culture, political relations in the country and international circumstances. These factors were cumulative, although international circu...\n\nThis article provides a short overview of the Independent Democratic Party’s (SDS) position on antifascism, Serb'Croat relations, and democratic solutions to Yugoslavia’s domestic problems from 1936 to 1939. During this period the SDS took a distinctly different approach on the Spanish Civil War from their coalition partners, the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). While both of these parties advocated good relations between Serbs and Croats, they responded differently to the rise of radical nationalism and fascism in Europe and in Croatia. Although the SDS was an example of a democratic party with an antifascist platform, the communist postwar historiography included them with other passive “bourgeois” interwar parties, contributing to perception in Croatia that equates antifascism exclusively with communism.\n\nThe celebration of St Sava’s Day in schools during the interwar period expressed the policy of the Yugoslav state authorities to reconcile religious diversity among its population with national unity by highlighting the parallel national character of Yugoslav Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Islam. These celebrations, however, generated strong opposition from leaders of the religious communities in Yugoslavia. Crucially, the criticism was not directed against the Yugoslav national program in education as such, but revolved around the fundamentally different ontologies of the nationalizing state and religious thinkers. For the former, religious symbolic resources like St Sava served the purpose of the nation, for the latter the meaning of St Sava could not be detached from Orthodoxy. The divergence between religious thinking and the national program of the Yugoslav state authorities explains the parallel shift among religious thinkers in Yugoslavia away from Yugoslavism to the Croatian Catholic, Serbian Orthodox and Bosnian Muslim nationalisation of religion."
