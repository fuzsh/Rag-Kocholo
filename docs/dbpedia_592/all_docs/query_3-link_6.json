        "text": "Why is the talk about Yugoslavia still emotionally charged and situated in the registers of passion, pain, sentimental recollections, or nostalgia even 30 years after its violent dissolution? How is the sphere of the affective, sensory, and embodied fundamental to understanding the historical project of Yugoslavia and its afterlives? Social Lives of Affect: Post-Yugoslav Reflections addresses these questions and explores how the attempts to conceptually capture our social realities in their messy, fluid, and indeterminate natures contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex sociopolitical processes in the region. Moreover, the book shows how using affect to understand social realities in their constant transformation often challenges not only the expected politics of belonging, identification, and solidarity but also how we (as scholars) give them sociopolitical meaning. It allows observing the social dynamics beyond an exclusive focus on the ethno-national (and increasingly racial) differences emphasized in the scholarly examinations of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe article discusses the necessity for the diversification of (hi)stories of Yugoslavia, arguing for the importance of incorporating the affects and experiences of Yugoslavia's citizens into the historical narratives. Acknowledging the difficulties emerging form the fact that what is articulated as historical narrative is still part of the experience for millions of citizens of post-Yugoslav societies, the article reflects upon the potential for and obstacles to an affective history of socialist Yugoslavia through the lens borrowed from German sociologist Georg Simmel. It particularly refers to – and makes use of – two sets of Simmel's ideas. The first concerns the nature of material and the way we are making a story out of it – more precisely, the relationship between history and experience, life and representation. The second is about the perspective from which we look at, approach , and synthesize this material. Simmel's reflections on history and form offer a very useful tool to look at the Yugoslav case and also help de-essentialize and normalize Yugoslav history, making the anxieties that characterize it part of a much broader discussion about history, its nature, and its internal contradictions.\n\nReflecting on the complex relationship between the affective, the aural, and the political, this issue points out the limits of existing interpretative discourses of music and memory in post-Yugoslav spaces, which underplay the lived intensity of the sensory experiences, emotional investment, and the affective technologies of remembering the past. The authors here argue that the emphasis on the social and political production of affect embedded in the experience of music might be beneficial for shedding new light on memory politics in a post-Yugoslav context. Examining why and how music matters for post-Yugoslav memory practices, the articles in this issue strive to fashion new readings that go beyond the dichotomies commonly drawn between political/nostalgic, commercial/engaged, and escapist/emancipatory. The issue thus argues that the sensorial politics of music can serve as a conceptual framework that provides an important base for new theorizations of Yugoslav cultural memories, which is done by focusing on the politics of sentimentalism and the politics of joy. Accordingly, the goal of this issue is to raise productive questions that resonate with a multiplicity of interpretational and theoretical dilemmas and gaps by mobilizing the tools of affect theory primarily to open a space and spur further criticism and theory.\n\nOver the past thirty years the analysis of the Balkan discourse have been raised issues on spatial and symbolic distribution of the affects. Today, the subdiscipline of emotional spatiality provides a new insights into the link between the political, economic and social status of Southeastern Europe and representations that imply affects. Taking into account the knowledge which comes from imagology and postcolonial critics, new question arise: “What is the role of representation in the creation of emotional geography and vice versa.?“ Namely, these seemingly different and somewhat opposed approaches which are resistant to essentialism, outline a number of key issues which are present in the text on the Balkans. These approaches were exposed and analyzed to indicate the silent presence of emotional geography in earlier studies of the Balkans, and to point out the possibility of their comprehensive application in the future."
