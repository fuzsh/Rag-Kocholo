        "text": "A constellation is both a figure made of stars and a region in space. A constellation is commonly drawn with lines between the stars, while longer back ago sometimes as a picture. Constellations can be drawn with lines in different ways and has therefor no firm rule how to look like. As a good system of navigation, the whole space in Milky Way is divided in regions where each is bordered by another one.\n\nConstellations are groups of stars in the sky, which are grouped according to some sign and united by a common mythology with each other. Constellations - in modern astronomy, areas into which the celestial sphere is divided for the convenience of orientation in the starry sky. In ancient times, constellations were the characteristic figures formed by bright stars.\n\nThere are 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Because there are still several other constellations from other cultures and historical, the idea of these recognized 88 constellations by the International Astronomical Union is to use and see a common system for the whole of humanity.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe word \"constellation\" comes originally from the Classical Latin constellatio ([kɔnstɛˈlaːtɪɔ]). Classical Latin is divided into parts where constellatio came in the time of Late Classical Latin, while the original one used in the Golden Age of Classical Latin is sidus ([ˈsiːdʊs]).\n\nMeaning[]\n\nBright stars in the constellations are at different distances from the Sun Stars that are visible on the celestial sphere at small angular distances from each other, in three-dimensional space can be located very far from each other. Thus, in one constellation there can be both very close and very distant stars from the Earth, which are not connected with each other in any way.\n\nThe significance of dividing the sky into constellations for observational astronomy lies in the fact that the characteristic contours, consisting of the brightest stars, are easy to remember, which makes it possible, knowing in which constellation the object is located, to quickly find it.\n\nStory[]\n\nConstellations on the star map of the 17th century by the Dutch cartographer Frederick de Wit In ancient times, people saw a certain system in the relative position of the stars and grouped them into constellations according to it. Over the course of history, observers have distinguished a different number of constellations and their outlines, and the origin of the names of some ancient constellations has not been fully elucidated. Until the 19th century, constellations were understood not as regions of the sky, but as groups of stars that often overlapped. In this case, it turned out that some stars belonged to two constellations at once, and some regions poor in stars did not belong to any constellation. At the beginning of the 19th century, boundaries were drawn between the constellations on the celestial sphere, eliminating the “voids” between the constellations, but there was still no clear definition of them, and different astronomers defined them in their own way.\n\n12 constellations - Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces - through which the center of the Sun passes during the annual rotation along the ecliptic, are called zodiacal. They have been known since ancient times. In our time (epoch 2014), from November 30 to December 17, the Sun is in the constellation of Ophiuchus, so formally this constellation is also a zodiacal one, but traditionally it is not considered a zodiac constellation.\n\nConstellations of the polar region of the sky in the atlas of Pardi (1674) The names of 48 of the 88 modern constellations are included in the Almagest catalog by Claudius Ptolemy, who lived in the 2nd century AD. e. They cover the region of the sky accessible to observations from the south of Europe. Early images of all the constellations introduced by Ptolemy can be found in the Book of Fixed Stars by al-Sufi, who lived in 903-998. The remaining modern constellations were introduced in the 17th-18th centuries as a result of the study of the southern sky (during the era of great geographical discoveries) and the filling of \"empty places\" in the northern sky. The names of the constellations can be associated with real or fictional animals (Ursa Major, Leo, Dragon, etc.), the heroes of Greek myths (Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Perseus, etc.), as well as with the names of objects whose outlines form bright constellation stars (Northern Crown, Triangle, Libra, Southern Cross, etc.). The names introduced in modern times were associated with travel and the development of technology (Microscope, Sextant, etc.).\n\nIn 1922, in Rome, by decision of the I General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, a list of 88 constellations into which the starry sky was divided was finally approved, and in 1928, clear and unambiguous boundaries between these constellations were adopted, drawn strictly along the lines of constant right ascension and lines constant declination in the equatorial celestial coordinate system for the epoch 1875.0. Within five years, refinements were made to the boundaries of the constellations. In 1935, the boundaries were finally approved, and the astronomers agreed that they would not be changed anymore. However, it should be remembered that on star charts compiled for epochs that do not coincide with the epoch of 1875.0 (in particular, on all modern maps), due to the precession of the earth's axis, the lines of constant declination and right ascension have shifted, and therefore the boundaries of the constellations are no longer match them.\n\nList of 88 Modern Constellations[]\n\nModern Constellations Constellation Abbr number of stars Best Star Photo Map Andromeda And 100 Antlia Ant 20 Apus Aps 20 Aquarius Aqr 90 Aquila Aql 70 Ara Ara 30 Aries Ari 50 Auriga Aur 90 Boötes Boo 90 Caelum Cae 10 Camelopardalis Cam 50 Cancer Cnc 60 Canes Venatici CVn 30 Canis Major CMa 80 Canis Minor CMi 20 Capricornus Cap 50 Carina Car 110 Cassiopeia Cas 90 Centaurus Cen 150 Cepheus Cep 60 Cetus Cet 100 Chamaeleon Cha 20 Circinus Cir 20 Columba Col 40 Coma Berenices Com 50 Corona Australis CrA 25 Corona Borealis CrB 20 Corvus Crv 15 Crater Crt 20 Crux Cru 30 Cygnus Cyg 150 Delphinus Del 30 Dorado Dor 20 Draco Dra 80 Equuleus Equ 10 Eridanus Eri 100 Fornax For 35 Gemini Gem 70 Grus Gru 30 Hercules Her 140 Horologium Hor 20 Hydra Hya 130 Hydrus Hyi 20 Indus Ind 20 Lacerta Lac 35 Leo Leo 70 Leo Minor LMi 20 Lepus Lep 40 Libra Lib 50 Lupus Lup 70 Lynx Lyn 60 Lyra Lyr 45 Mensa Men 15 Microscopium Mic 20 Monoceros Mon 85 Musca Mus 30 Norma Nor 20 Octans Oct 35 Ophiuchus Oph 100 Orion Ori 120 Pavo Pav 45 Pegasus Peg 100 Perseus Per 90 Phoenix Phe 40 Pictor Pic 30 Pisces Psc 75 Piscis Austrinus PsA 25 Puppis Pup 140 Pyxis Pyx 25 Reticulum Ret 15 Sagitta Sge 20 Sagittarius Sgr 115 Scorpius Sco 100 Sculptor Scl 30 Scutum Sct 20 Serpens Ser 60 Sextans Sex 25 Taurus Tau 125 Telescopium Tel 30 Triangulum Tri 15 Triangulum Australe TrA 20 Tucana Tuc 25 Ursa Major UMa 125 Ursa Minor UMi 20 Vela Vel 110 Virgo Vir 95 Volans Vol 20 Vulpecula Vul 45"
