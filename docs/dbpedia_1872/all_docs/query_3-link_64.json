        "text": "It’s kind of ridiculous it’s not already in every monolith but then when you take into account how close you need to be to it before you can see on the map? Isn’t the whole point of having new content for people to interact with it? I feel like I’m wasting my time when over half the time it isn’t there and you have to search every nook and cranny before finding out it isn’t there. It makes me not want to even play now that I’ve reached the endgame.\n\nNot even remotely. Unlike GGG which throws in unfinished barely tested mechanics which then get removed at times fully again - despite amazing aspects of it - EHG doesn’t do that.\n\nThe premise of GGG providing content which can only be enjoyed for 3 months and then never ever again is a despicable thing to say it directly. It’s entirely hinging on FOMO and a predatory business practice, even if they’d never intended it for it to become one by design at the beginning… it turned into one.\n\nSo with the current status of how LE handles their game and clearly implementing properly thought out systems which don’t utterly disrupt their game’s core premise I would say long-term EHG has a better standing with their game then GGG does. The sole reason GGG managed to sustain their front row was because no other company managed to provide a quality product, all of them becoming greedy to have a slice of the pie without putting the relevant effort into it.\n\nIt’s always the same arguments which cause me to simply sigh out.\n\nNo, obviously LE doesn’t hold a candle to PoE, it has roughly 8 years to catch up to, duh!\n\nBut surprise surprise… for some really ‘odd reason’ I just can’t put my finger down on PoE suddenly… after ignoring it for years… is focusing on QoL implementations?\n\nIt just might be that suddenly they’re enforced to do it since a competitor showcases ‘it can be done’ and people see how much better it feels. Who would’ve ever thought that to be the case, right?\n\nLE is a threat for PoE because it provides stable working base mechanics, has a competitive graphic and unlike the disillusioned playerbase of PoE has one thing… hope that the product goes into the direction which GGG ignored to take it since years despite people screaming at them left and right.\n\n‘Oh no, we can’t have automated trading in our game, it would ruin everything immediately!’ And here we are, with a really badly implemented automatic trading mechanic that Last Epoch has provided… and the game isn’t burning down because of it!\n\n‘Oh no, we can’t have stuff open automatically by people walking over it, what if they do it by mistake?’ Despite having breach implemented since years… and surprise… now the hands open automatically!\n\nWhere might they have seen that not needing to walk up to a waypoint but activating it from a distance is not a downfall making it ‘too easy’? Might be Last Epoch I would say, since it’s the only competitor with the same system doing that. Removing the outdated sextant mechanic which was limiting and detrimental beyond end? Why now? Hrmm… maybe because some other games don’t limit you? Like Torchlight Infinite and Last Epoch?\n\nThey got complacent with their status and stagnated, be happy that competition is there to push them finally forward again.\n\nSo don’t give me that crap about ‘fanbois’.\n\nLE is creating a game with a stable foundation and catching up to PoE fast, obviously it won’t be able to have 10 friggin years of content in it at day 1 of release. To think that would be the case is arrogant and delusional, it’s not a possibility, EHG is a good dev-studio… not a miracle machine.\n\nBut just look at the roadmap. Oh? A new pinnacle boss system? PoE needed years for that after release! What? Their story already is longer then what PoE offers and more interactive now? Despite 10 years of work? A rework of the end-game which is fairly barebones? Here we go, might compete with Shaper-atlas-times even suddenly in 1.3.\n\nThe skill system is too barebones? Well, let us implement a way to adjust it with sigils… however that might look.\n\nEquipment? Ah, no worries, we now got a mechanic to improve gear beyond the maximum normally possible and are bringing a whole slew of new uniques next cycle even, we got 30… new… uniques in a single cycle. That’s beyond the common PoE levels since a while now!\n\nAlso not enough end-game? No worries… here you get bosses… more bosses… and some more on top! The baseline mechanics? Well, that’s solid, isn’t it? Expanding is not as important if you got variety to keep someone busy in the meanwhile.\n\nYou’ll always have complainers.\n\nThere’s those people which point out the shortcomings of the game. The developer then looks at that and goes ‘yeah, point ‘e’ of the list is the most important, we’ll focus on that, then ‘b’, ‘j’, ‘h’’ and so on.\n\nAnd then there’s the people which come in which go ‘This is bad, why hasn’t it already those 50 mechanics inside with the competitor out since 10 years has?’ like our OP here. Which is… nonsensical.\n\nYou ignore those simply. Their only value lies in feedback as a overall sign of ‘we’re not there yet, we can’t rest on our laurels’. That’s all they do, provide a sense of direction. Beyond that they have zero meaning, and even that meaning is already established anyway and obvious.\n\nAs soon as you’ve got to handle customers you’ll quickly learn that customers are mess, always. Different people have different views… but a general notion which aligns with your core audience comes surprisingly easily through if you know how to look out for it.\n\n‘Is our direction actually still what the core of the game wants to provide?’ is one major aspect… for that you look for the people which have stayed with the product for a longer time already. They showcase if the ‘spirit’ of the product is upheld.\n\n‘Are we bringing in new people still?’ Is what you want to ask yourself through the feedback provided by newer players. Are they interested in engaging? Are those names leaving or coming up repeatedly? This shows if you’re progressing still or stagnating in old ways.\n\nAnd then you just got to sort out between viable suggestions and dismantle badly written messy convoluted posts. People rambling about their grandfathers while trying to make a point which has been made already. Repeated posts which simply showcase that something is controversial but neither bad/good maybe. Things where nearly everyone agrees ‘yeah, it’s not there yet.’ And with the last one you take special notice as a developer. ‘Well, we’re not there yet, how can we make it better and without flaws in the system?’.\n\nThis is why we get pinnacle bosses, more uniques for variety, a re-work of the end-game and only small amounts of effort in comparison to finishing the storyline (since it’s less important for retention at the moment then end-game aspects) are done and actively communicated.\n\nIn comparison we often see new developers bringing out EA titles and then suddenly you get things like ‘we implemented that you can pet the dog and it has 25 new animations!’… yay? Nice? What about the game itself?\n\nThey fail at seeing what the priorities are.\n\nIt’s also the reason why when people ask for ‘those new animations’, ‘why no gender choice’ or similar stuff get their eyes rolled at. A customer doesn’t need to know what takes how much effort… but it would be darn good as a customer to know how their product functions to understand what’s possible, how long it would take and to realize which things become a priority and which are… useless fluff.\n\nWelcome to game development!\n\nIt does. PoE launches a mechanic and goes overboard with it. It’s clearly OP most of the times and it’s the sole focus of the league. Then they tone it down and add it in a balanced state to the core (when they do add it). And then you get the outcries like you did with Harvest.\n\nLE is adding core stuff, so they add it already balanced. If they added nemesis to every echo it would be way too strong and when they toned it down in 1.2 it would feel bad.\n\nThat’s like saying that 1.0 cycle focus was factions and the 2 new classes, so you should be forced to play those classes.\n\nJust because something is added in a cycle doesn’t mean you have to go overboard with it. That’s what PoE does to create FOMO and make everyone play in league. They actively discourage people from playing in standard. LE doesn’t do that. At least not yet."
