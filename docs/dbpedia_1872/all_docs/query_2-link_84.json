        "text": "Historically, observatories [are] as simple as using or placing stably an astronomical sextant (for measuring the distance between stars) or Stonehenge (which has some alignments on astronomical phenomena). Most optical telescopes are housed within a dome or similar structure, to protect the delicate instruments from the elements. Telescope domes have a slit or other opening in the roof that can be opened during observing, and closed when the telescope is not in use. In most cases, the entire upper portion of the telescope dome can be rotated to allow the instrument to observe different sections of the night sky. Radio telescopes usually do not have domes.\n\nThere are \"a plethora of observations from heavenly bodies which did not agree with each other despite being from the same astronomical entities.\"[1]\n\nMain article: Radiation astronomy/Astronomy\n\n\"The radio quasar 3C 454.3 underwent an exceptional optical outburst lasting more than 1 year and culminating in spring 2005. The maximum brightness detected was R = 12.0, which represents the most luminous quasar state thus far observed (MB ~ −31.4). In order to follow the emission behaviour of the source in detail, a large multiwavelength campaign was organized by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT). Continuous optical, near-IR and radio monitoring was performed in several bands. Two pointings by the Chandra and INTEGRAL satellites provided additional information at high energies in May 2005.\"[2]\n\n\"The historical radio data are from the University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) and the Metsähovi Radio Observatory (Teräsranta et al. 2005, references therein, and unpublished data), while data from the Crimean (RT-22), MDSCC (PARTNeR), Medicina, Noto, and SAO RAS (RATAN-600) Observatories as well as data from the VLA/VLBA Polarization Calibration Database1 contribute to the most recent part of the light curves.\"[2]\n\n\"In order to have information on both the rising and decreasing phases of the outburst, data were collected from June 2004 to the end of September 2005. In total, 5584 UBV RI observations from 18 telescopes4 were performed in this period; moreover, JHK data were taken at Campo Imperatore, Calar Alto, and Roque de los Muchachos (NOT). Radio data from 1 to 43 GHz were acquired at several telescopes, mentioned above.\"[2]\n\nMain article: Astronomical observatories\n\nDef. a place where stars, planets and other celestial bodies are observed is called an observatory.\n\nThe \"Faulkes Telescope Project, sponsored by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, provides students in the United Kingdom with free access to two high-powered robotic telescopes, one in Hawaii and the other in Australia, which the students are able to use remotely to carry out their own scientific investigations (http://faulkes-telescope.com/).\"[3]\n\n\"The 0.6m Tortugas Mountain Observatory is used to monitor the temporal changes in the Jovian cloud deck and equatorial activity on Saturn. The data are collected with a CCD camera, archived at the NMSU astronomy department and made available to the Astronomical community through the NASA Planetary Data System Subnode. Images collected over the last 27 years are being used as a climatic data base to interpret the Hubble Space Telescope ~HST!, Galileo and Cassini data. Although funding has been reduced, simultaneous observations are scheduled when the 3.5 meter telescope is used for infrared imaging of Jupiter.\"[4]\n\nDef. a device used to measure the heating power of electromagnetic radiation, especially that of solar radiation is called an actinometer.\n\nDef. an actinometer used to measure solar radiation incident on a surface is called a pyranometer.\n\nAt right is an SR20 solar radiation sensor. It complies with the \"secondary standard\" specifications within the latest ISO and WMO standards.\n\nDef. the \"total solar radiation from sun and sky on a horizontal surface\"[5] is called the global radiation.\n\nThe Radiation Observatory, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway, latitude 60° 24' N and longitude 5° 19' E, at 45 m elevation above sea level, uses one or more pyranometers to measure the Global Radiation.[5]\n\nA sensitivity check is made of each pyranometer against a standard using the sun/shade method on a cloudless day.[5]\n\nA sensitivity may be similar to 4.818 V/Wm-2, which should be a small factor such as 1.0165 times the original sensitivity when first manufactured.[5]\n\nThe diffuse (sky) radiation is measured by a pyranometer. \"When measuring the sky radiation, the direct solar radiation is constantly shadowed off by means of a 6 cm diameter circular disc mounted on a 30 cm long rotating arm.\"[5]\n\nDef. a device that measures the intensity of solar radiation received on the surface of the earth is called a pyrheliometer.\n\nThe normal incidence beam radiation is measured by a normal incidence pyrheliometer with a known and calibrated sensitivity, e.g. 8.15 V/Wm-2.[5]\n\nThe pyrheliometer is mounted on an automatic solar tracker.[5]\n\nDef. a device that measures radiant energy is called a radiometer.\n\nUltraviolet radiation is measured by means of a total ultraviolet radiometer with a specific wavelength response such as 290 - 385 nm.[5]\n\n\"For the measurement of long-wave radiation, a ventilated [...] pyrgeometer [...] with coated silicon hemisphere [is] used. This makes it possible to compute the [Downward Atmospheric Radiation], since the temperature of the instrument is also recorded.\"[5]\n\n\"The [Duration of Sunshine] is measured by a Campbell-Stoke sunshine recorder with blue paper strips. The strips are read according to the rules of [the World Meteorological Organization] WMO [3]. Maximum possible duration gives the number of hours the sun is above the natural horizon, as found from the records on days with clear skies at sunrise or sunset. The [Duration of Sunshine] is also given as the number of minutes during which the [NIP records] irradiance above 120 Wm-2 (with one instantaneous recording counted as 20 seconds).\"[5]\n\n\"The necessary routine calibrations of the pyranometers and the NIP pyrheliometer are carried out by means of the absolute self-calibrating cavity pyrheliometer [which in turn is] compared to the World Radiation Reference Scale (WRR)\".[5]\n\nObservatory geology has two forms: the geological study necessary to put an observatory on a solid foundation to maximize telescope function through minimizing ground-based vibration and imaging terrain so that geological study may be performed.\n\n\"Images of Europa from the Galileo spacecraft [launch release at right from the shuttle Atlantis] show a surface with a complex history involving tectonic deformation, impact cratering, and possible emplacement of ice-rich materials and perhaps liquids on the surface. Differences in impact crater distributions suggest that some areas have been resurfaced more recently than others; Europa could experience current cryovolcanic and tectonic activity. Global-scale patterns of tectonic features suggest deformation resulting from non-synchronous rotation of Europa around Jupiter. Some regions of the lithosphere have been fractured, with icy plates separated and rotated into new positions. The dimensions of these plates suggest that the depth to liquid or mobile ice was only a few kilometers at the time of disruption. Some surfaces have also been upwarped, possibly by diapirs, cryomagmatic intrusions, or convective upwelling. In some places, this deformation has led to the development of chaotic terrain in which surface material has collapsed and/or been eroded\"[6]\n\nA \"'Theoretical Observatory' [...] decides which systems, sub-systems and sub-sub-systems should be recognizable, and which not. The result of this process [is] a Theoretically Observed Bright Multiple Star Catalogue or TOBMSC.\"[7]\n\nA computer code \"decides which components would actually be identifiable, either as visual systems, as spectroscopic systems or as eclipsing systems.\"[7]\n\nMain article: Radiation astronomy/Entities\n\n\"In order that the [Virtual Astronomical Observatory] VAO would be seen as an entity that is of and for the research community, a dedicated not-for-profit company was established to manage the governance and business functions.\"[8]\n\n\"The U.S. Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO; http://www.us-vao.org/) [...] goal is to enable new science through efficient integration of distributed multi-wavelength data.\"[8]\n\nMain article: Radiation astronomy/Sources\n\nThe \"Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) [...] are primarily, but not exclusively, based on multi–band imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).

These high energy particles have an estimated arrival rate of just 1 per km2 per century, therefore the Auger Observatory has created a detection area the size of Rhode Island — over 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi) — in order to record a large number of these events.

The BATSE searched the sky for gamma ray bursts (20 to >600 keV) and conducted full sky surveys for long-lived sources. It consisted of eight identical detector modules, one at each of the satellite's corners (left, right; front and back; top and bottom). Each module consisted of both a NaI(Tl) Large Area Detector (LAD) covering the 20 keV to ~2 MeV range, 50.48 cm in dia by 1.27 cm thick, and a 12.7 cm dia by 7.62 cm thick NaI Spectroscopy Detector, which extended the upper energy range to 8 MeV, all surrounded by a plastic scintillator in active anti-coincidence to veto the large background rates due to cosmic rays and trapped radiation. Sudden increases in the LAD rates triggered a high-speed data storage mode, the details of the burst being read out to telemetry later. Bursts were typically detected at rates of roughly one per day over the 9-year CGRO mission. A strong burst could result in the observation of many thousands of gamma rays within a time interval ranging from ~0.1 s up to about 100 s.\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/X-rays and X-ray astronomy\n\nThe X-ray/optical composite at left \"highlights an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) shown in the box. ...

Each extinction curve is found to have a broad bump which peaks near 2175 A and whose position and profile appear to be constant among all the stars. It is shown that the bump is probably interstellar in origin and that the constancy of its position and shape places such severe restrictions on grain geometrical parameters that classical scattering theory cannot be used to explain the feature unless the dust grains in widely separated regions of space and with very different physical conditions are assumed to have nearly identical size and shape distributions.\"[36]\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Visuals and Visual astronomy\n\nWhat is “the “old-fashioned” spirit of real-time visual astronomy”?[37] “I think everyone can conjure up a mental image of astronomers at every level and place in history, gazing through the eyepieces of their telescopes at sights far away - true visual astronomy.”[37]\n\nAt right is an image of the 26-inch Warner & Swasey refracting telescope at the United States Naval Observatory.\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Violets and Violet astronomy\n\nIn 1959 \"observations of the spectrum of the planet Venus, with spectrographs of low and high dispersion at the Georgetown College Observatory, show that a wide, continuous absorption band is present in the violet and near-ultraviolet.\"[38]\n\nThe spectra at right show a \"[c]omparison between a night sky spectrum obtained in a light polluted site (Asiago Astrophysical Observatory – Italy, upper panel) and a dark site (ESO-Paranal – Chile, lower panel).

The telescope is a spherical reflector, not a parabolic reflector. To aim the telescope, the receiver is moved to intercept signals reflected from different directions by the spherical dish surface. A parabolic mirror would induce a varying astigmatism when the receiver is in different positions off the focal point, but the error of a spherical mirror is the same in every direction.\n\nThe receiver is located on a 900-ton platform which is suspended 150 m (500 ft) in the air above the dish by 18 cables running from three reinforced concrete towers, one of which is 110 m (365 ft) high and the other two of which are 80 m (265 ft) high (the tops of the three towers are at the same elevation). The platform has a 93-meter-long rotating bow-shaped track called the azimuth arm on which receiving antennas, secondary and tertiary reflectors are mounted. This allows the telescope to observe any region of the sky within a forty-degree cone of visibility about the local zenith (between −1 and 38 degrees of declination). Puerto Rico's location near the equator allows Arecibo to view all of the planets in the Solar System, though the round trip light time to objects beyond Saturn is longer than the time the telescope can track it, preventing radar observations of more distant objects.\n\nThe radio telescope P-2500 (RT 70) - Soviet radio telescope with a mirror diameter of 70 meters - is one of the largest in the world.

Papagiannis in recognition of his 30 years of service to Boston University, this collection includes books in all areas of the field, current journals, and a comprehensive collection of sky atlases and maps.\"[70]\n\nThe image on the right shows reading tables and a portion of the stacks. The images on the left and center show the main reading rooms of the Cambridge Observatory Library and Van Vleck Observatory Library of Wesleyan University, respectively.\n\n\"Our objective is to design, build, and maintain the highest quality research and teaching instruments, while always keeping finished cost to a minimum and safety to a maximum.\"[71]\n\n\"I asked him where he had it made, he said he made it himself, & when I asked him where he got his tools said he made them himself & laughing added if I had staid for other people to make my tools & things for me...

The constellations and the movement of the sun, moon and planets can be clearly demonstrated and these important aspects of the science of astronomy can be easily explained.\"[73]\n\nAt left is the exterior structure for the Minsk planetarium.\n\nBoth astronomers and the general public who enjoy and support most astronomical observatories take advantage of observation platforms.\n\n\"The 300 square meters sized observation platform [at the Munich Public Observatory shown at right] is located at an altitude of 35 meters above street level and provides a splendid view over the city of [Munich] and the Alps. Two telescope domes [and] two smaller huts, housing the large telescopes are located here. In addition to these the visitors can use a series of smaller, portable telescopes.\"[73]\n\nAn airborne observatory is an airplane or balloon with an astronomical telescope. By carrying the telescope high, the telescope can avoid cloud cover, pollution, and carry out observations in the infrared spectrum, above water vapor in the atmosphere which absorbs infrared radiation.\n\nThe Gerard P. Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) was a national facility operated by NASA to support research in infrared astronomy. The observation platform was a highly modified C-141A jet transport aircraft with a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km), capable of conducting research operations up to 48,000 feet (14 km). The KAO was based at the Ames Research Center, NAS Moffett Field, in Sunnyvale, California. It began operation in 1974 as a replacement for an earlier aircraft, the Galileo Observatory, a converted Convair CV-990 (N711NA).\n\nThe Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) ... is based on a Boeing 747SP wide-body aircraft that has been modified to include a large door in the aft fuselage that can be opened in flight to allow a 2.5 meter diameter reflecting telescope access to the sky. This telescope is designed for infrared astronomy observations in the stratosphere at altitudes of about 41,000 feet (about 12 km). SOFIA's flight capability allows it to rise above almost all of the water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, which blocks some infrared wavelengths from reaching the ground. At the aircraft's cruising altitude, 85% of the full infrared range will be available.[74] The aircraft can also travel to almost any point on the Earth's surface, allowing observation from the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nMain article: Hypotheses\n\nRadiation astronomy observatories have probably been around as long as hominins have.\n\nInternational Astronomical Union\n\nOffice of Scientific & Technical Information\n\nQuestia - The Online Library of Books and Journals\n\nThe SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System\n\nScirus for scientific information only advanced search\n\nSpacecraft Query at NASA.\n\nUniversal coordinate converter"
