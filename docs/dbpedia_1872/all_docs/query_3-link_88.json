ZODIACAL INFORMATION KLAUDIO ZIC Academy for RTRRT and Scientific Astrology ABSTRACT The Academy of Scientific Astrology is based on astronomic principles confirming to the IAU convention. The calculations are performed on the HORIZONS integrator by Jon Giorgini of NASA JPL, Pasadena CA. Subject headings: solar system – Academic Zodiac, astronomy – precession, religion – planetary exorcism Online material: www.lulu.com/astrology http://youtube.com/astrology2012 http://youtube.com/RTRRTV Amo 5:8 seek him that made the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: Jehovah is his name. 1. MOTIVATION In the age of Cetus, our scientists uncover our distant past through walking snakes and whales1. A fossil is information. Information often requires further interpretation, sometimes even when simple and direct. We assume that the position of the sun is an information of interest to many. It will be immediately apparent that information is classified according to authority, namely NASA JPL. When an authority issues information, there is no doubt as to its efficaciousness as well as correctness. In extension, information, when properly applied, fertilizes the original human mind. On the other hand, misinformation binds the mind in the dungeons of darkness and superstition. Only a short ephemeris strip will provide more information than all superstition through ages, as well as stir exorcism in a crooked mind beset by dark superstition. The superstitious 2. PROBLEM Information travels like seed. If it falls on fertile ground, it will bloom, while if it slips towards barren minds, it will hardly produce any effect. In order to make gold, one must have at least a little gold oneself. In acquiring information, one must possess at least one happy thought an infinitesimal parcel of one’s original mind. A true mind is hard to find, as most human minds lie suffocated under the burden of false ego. The hermit seeks human beings with the help of a lamp. Ecce homo. False ego is an install, quite incapable of any magickal feat. The default ego victimizes humankind. Without that ego, humankind would not suffer death at all. This precise ego is marked for deletion according to the bible and the reality-rendering project. 3. APPROACH In order to exemplify information as function of planetary exorcism, we presented the astrological community with an authoritative set of ephemeris, the NASA JPL HORIZONS ephemeris. These are readily available as national patrimony and racial legacy. As there can be no doubt as to the precision and accuracy of such an ephemeris, we used them in defining the zodiac. The result was the Academic Zodiac, an accurate as well as operative environment for qualified astronomical as well as astrological praxis. 4. RESULTS The results of our research are enlisted as follow. The easiest way in one’s own progress is the acceptance of authority. As one’s often cherished mind is not one’s own at all, authority is called in dispelling doubts. You decide when to walk or when to sit, but you do not decide when to think. Moreover, no one can stop thinking2. If default mind would be our own, we would be able to switch it off and on at will. In order to absorb information, one relaxes into non-thinking. A second of non-thinking is worth an eternity. It is eternity! Time and space are just concepts like any, as unzipped by the true mind distiller3. Inspection shows that there are 22 zodiacal constellations. When scanned and packed together, they form the Academic Zodiac. Precession has 16 rising constellations at east at the present epoch. Some of the zodiacal constellations are occasionally overlapping with the zodiacal constellations. Several zodiacal constellations do not rise at east at the present epoch, namely Aries, Gemini, Cancer, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius and Capricornus do not rise at east, and thus can not be labeled as ascendants. Information is often packed within little capsules like this NASA ephemeris strip4 for the winter sun. The sun is still in Libra on November 23rd. 2008-Nov-23 00:00 Lib 2008-Nov-24 00:00 Sco 2008-Nov-25 00:00 Sco 2008-Nov-26 00:00 Sco 2008-Nov-27 00:00 Sco 2008-Nov-28 00:00 Sco 2008-Nov-29 00:00 Sco 2008-Nov-30 00:00 Oph 2008… 2008-Dec-17 00:00 Oph 2008-Dec-18 00:00 Sgr A further zodiacal information is provided within a graphical example. It happens that the example is a typical horoscope printout for modern times. This setup includes all the major dwarf planets, including the recent discoveries. Note that such a printout was never available anywhere else. Eris sitting precisely on the NYC western horizon, or moon in Orion for the WTC are simply not part of any pseudo-astrological experience. The horoscope of course shows 16 rising constellations5 as nested within the Cartesian house system. Thus, if the moon is rising in Cetus at east in your horoscope, Cetus is marked as ascendant and lord of the first house. On the other hand, if Venus in Hydra is rising at east, the longest zodiacal constellation will be visible at the ascendant in your horoscope. In the graphical example, we observe recently discovered dwarf planets as neatly nested within the Cartesian house system. The wheel chart is for Pas de Calais 15886. Eris is conjunct Masonic 2002 MS4 in the first house. While the lord of war, Mars is conjunct with 2006 QH181 precisely NE. The example serves as unique map for the modern astrologer, in that it announces an expansion of our integrating capabilities. NASA is introducing a new integration model which would be able to calculate the accurate position for e.g. dwarf planets like 2007 OR10, even towards remote epochs. As concern information, the map clearly stands as standard. Technically, we deal with an astronomical-astrological chart wheel as based on the Cartesian chart system. As all the new discoveries are automatically loaded, we gain a better perspective of the event. It is most exciting to discover our past as armed with the new discoveries, from giant comets to KELU-1 or the dwarf planets. The map shows 2007 OR10 in the 10th Cartesian house, as aligned with the prominent Moon Uranus conjunction. Dr John Dee would give everything to have this map on his desk. How do we use this map? If we associate 2007 OR10 with war waged and lost, we immediately have a warning for the current president of the USA, who has 2007 OR10 prominent in his own natal chart. Namely, the direction of 2007 OR10 in the map can be associated with the movement of the betrayed Armada fleet. Astrological maps clearly show the movement of troops. In our case, we would expect an attack from NE. When properly projected, minute detail clearly shows in its strategic proportions. Thus, 2007 OR10 will mark a specific vessel coming from the London direction. We can even determine the name and speed of the vessel itself, as based on a recent discovery within the dwarf planet realm. This is more data than Dr John Dee ever had or needed. 5. DISCUSSION The superstitious mind is a separate apparatus that is installed atop of the original, in order to suffocate it. The install pertains to the transcendental sphere, albeit intuition penetrates the mystery of the original sin. Children intuitively know not only that something is wrong, but also who and what is wrong, but are discouraged to claim their original mind, precisely by their already enslaved parents. Nevertheless, scientific is encouraged in an illuminated environment, from which true mind springs free as associated with objective science.\n\nZodiaco Accademico ABSTRACT #162220122017 a) 22 zodiacal stations – the 22 Tarot arcana all represent zodiacal constellations. b) 16 eastern ascendants – guardian angels – elementary court - Tarot permutations. c) Sidereal=tropical as Astronomy = Astrology &amp; Academic Zodiac = real natal sky d) Original astronomic IAU compatible calculations – no superstition involved. e) Solid state universal Cartesian house system as tested on spacecraft – unbreakable. f) 1008 original delineations for all objects within the solar system and beyond. g) Daily fresh delineations for new objects such as centaurs, comets or dwarf planets. h) Easy one-minute prediction as matched by personal future-changing technology. 1H TAKE IT BACK #162220122017 Claim your own true, verified, original, genuine, unique, real and veritable natal skies! Take it back! Take your life back. New Sun-sign, new ascendant, new guardian angel, new life, new karma, new fate, new never-ending adventurity. Never succumb to biomass or superstition as driven by the default mind of this world. Dark clouds are not for thee. NATAL SKIES #162220122017 The doctrine is the real sky. Nothing but the real sky. We ask of you nothing else but to follow your real natal sky. Not one, two or many: only one. You real natal sky is a blueprint of your soul. One of the true eastern ascendants is your guardian angel. Leave any false natal skies to the profane and the damned. We know that this is a hard point for they have imposed several faux skies upon you – and you yielded to a bundle of lies, and still do. Just stay with your real natal skies: that’s all. We are the real natal skies provider. ORIGINAL SKYMIND #162220122017 Human beings can not bear with too much reality. They are like babies till their bitter end, believing even in things that in fact could happen or have happened as if in some beautiful fable. They ask one 1 to bear with them in not trying to change their point of view, 0F providing there is any. Albeit oppressed by default mind, they are forced to defend it with their teeth. In that way, their very own enemy has programmed them for its own protection. Default is the world of the Hobbits. They cannot, won’t and wouldn’t change anything in return for any reward on this world or another. They may gaze at the sky but their real sky reflects in the shallow deep backyard pond. That’s OK while they rely on said pond, not faux skies at all. Any Nostradamus in fact relies on a sort of pond, not real skies at all. Retroactive mind is unchangeable – it repeats itself through nonsensical cantilena which in time alas becomes unspiritual tradition. ACADEMIC ZODIAC #162220122017 Once upon the time when astrology diverged from astronomy, people worshiped faux natal skies. Both East and West, confusion reigned as babies would be born into false personalities. No “astrologer” knew one’s own baby’s Sun-sign! Jehovah strongly admonished but apparently no one listened. Those who warned were ignored and silenced. Superstition flourished. People never knew who they are and whence their problems really came from. The Devil fed on malice that emanated from issuing confusion and emotional turmoil. Countries had misplaced heraldry, Masonic temples were disoriented, symbols were confused and occultism disgraced. People knew no Tarot proper. They never knew that they have one true natal sky only as sidereal is tropical. Then Hayagrivananta inspected the zodiac and established it in minutes. Once false separation between astrology and astronomy was put to an end by the Academic Zodiac, humanity entered a golden era of peace and prosperity as divorce, having a wrong organ cut off or bankruptcy became things of the past. Once more the whale rules the planet and e have peace. From time to time the mind of man takes a sudden leap forward in inventing something which makes life so much easier that people soon begin to wonder how they The missionary man. ever got on without it. The wheel, printing, electricity, Internet; and now the Academic Zodiac i. http://ow.ly/7cPnW Psa 91:11 For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. Your guardian angel is the eastern ascending star. There are sixteen (16) ascending constellations at east for the current epoch. Which one is your own guardian angel? http://ow.ly/6TpWd Conosci il tuo unico angelo custode? Il sant’angelo custode del tuo oroscopo è uno dei sedici ascendenti nascenti a est per l’epoca presente. Qual è il tuo unico angelo custode già stella dell’est? http://ow.ly/6TsxO #162220122017 The Sun figures as one of the most acclaimed ii objects in popular astrology iii. Do you know its position? As free horoscopes are mostly intended for entertainment only, they never reproduce any original natal sky at all. Thus, Sai Baba was born with Sun in Libra on November 23rd. How about you? http://ow.ly/6Tq9A The generally known 13 Sun-signs expanded are in fact 15, even 16. Is your natal Sun in Orion or Cetus? #162220122017 The lunar zodiac represents a complex grid. Leave the calculations to us as your natal Moon sign gets properly determined. Alixe iv has Moon rising in Cetus, Mercury in Sextans along with Venus in Orion. Her Juno is in zodiacal"
