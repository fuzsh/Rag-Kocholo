        "text": "A vulture and scorpion among the animals carved on Gobekli Tepe pillar D43, attracted several interpretations of a 'zodiac'. However no coherent star map, observational record, or zodiac emerged. Five different identifications extensively contradict one another. The artwork is not consistent with the interpretations of Stephany (who has two different views), Burley (supported by Hancock), Collins, or Sweatman and Tsikritsis. Yet there is some consensus that four species on two other pillars could be seasonal ‘beasts’, as all cultures identify the four solar calendar points with constellations. Like all artworks worldwide, the design on pillar D43 subconsciously expresses the five-layered archetypal structure that is also imprinted in myth, ritual, building sites, calendars and constellations, particularly in various sets of 16 to 36 decans. Characters expressing archetypes ever and always have an axial grid between their eyes, as demonstrated below. Various zodiacs worldwide also express some elements of archetypal structure, but culture does not come from the sky. Babylo-Assyrian boundary stones, and the Mul Apin (Starry Plough) list, demonstrate how apparently varied, yet how structurally rigorous iconography is. Nature and culture are compulsively sustained by the structure embedded in matter and energy, in our perception, and in our subconscious behaviour.\n\nContents: 1.
