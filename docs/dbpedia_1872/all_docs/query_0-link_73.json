        "text": "Some of My Recent Photos:\n\nSee the Drop-Down Menus above for photos of other Astronomical Objects. The order of the Menus generally flows from the largest and most distant objects – “Galaxies” – all the way down to the smallest – “Snowflakes”, which can be found under “Nature Photos”\n\nIf you are a repeat visitor, a log of recent additions to this site can be found at the bottom of this Page.\n\nIn April 2024 “The Great North American Solar Eclipse” gave millions of people across the United States the opportunity to view a total solar eclipse. While Colorado was not on the path of totality, a 65% partial Eclipse was visible from my home. Go to “The Sun“ page for more details and photos.\n\n* * *\n\nIn March 2024 I was able to tour the observatory complex located at the summit of the Haleakala Volcano on the island of Maui. Go to the” “Activities“ page for more details and photos.\n\n* * *\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nI have been a lifelong amateur astronomer starting at the age of ten when I received a 4” Reflector telescope as a Christmas present – I have rarely been without a telescope since that time. During the 1950’s and 60’s my father was a U.S. Naval officer who had a professional interest in the stars as navigational signposts as well as a scientific curiosity in the stars themselves which rubbed off on me over the years. During these formative years the space-race with the Soviet Union was in full swing and all things space and science were making front page news. My boyhood heroes were the “Mercury Seven” astronauts and their pictures along with pictures of rockets and solar system bodies, cut from the pages of Life Magazine, were taped to my bedroom walls. One of the most memorable moments at this time was when my father and I watched Echo I (one of the early satellites) as it passed overhead when we were living at the Presidio in San Francisco.\n\nOver the years I have witnessed the many advancements in amateur astronomy and I can say without hesitation that right now we are living in a “Amateur Astronomy Golden Age” due to the following factors:\n\nQuality telescopes at all apertures can be had at historically low prices.\n\nThe advent of Digital Cameras and image processing software has revolutionized Astro-photography.\n\nPersonal computers and the internet has made professional astronomical publications, databases, and software available to the amateur.\n\nMy primary astronomical interest is viewing, photographing, and researching Double Stars. Many of the photos that are posted on these pages are of these beautiful and interesting bodies. One however cannot be immune to the other treasures that populate our solar neighborhood and the greater universe at large, so there are samples of many other objects which I have visited and can be accessed through the Drop-Down Menus in the header on each page.\n\nMy home and primary observing location is Castle Pines Colorado (EL 6,500 ft), a suburb just south of the Denver Metro area. In 2019 I began construction of a permanent observatory structure which when completed will include a warm room, storage space and wind protection.\n\nThis website is very much a work-in-progress so check back for additions and updates.
