The Astra III Sextants have somewhat revolutionized celestial navigation because never before have such high quality, accurate metal sextants been available at such low prices. Over 30,000 sextants of these models have been sold in the US alone, far more than any other serious sextant. Its popularity has spread throughout the rest of the world as well, making it the most recognized (and supported) sextant worldwide."
