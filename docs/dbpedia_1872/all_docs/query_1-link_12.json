Smith 99\n\nKey Words.:\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe past two decades have seen a surge of interest in the research of Milky Way (MW) satellites, thanks to the advent of digital wide-field deep panchromatic photometric surveys.The application of high-performance over-density detection techniques to large data sets has led to a substantial increase in the number of known stellar systems inhabiting the MW halo (e.g. Belokurov et al., 2007; Walsh et al., 2009; Koposov et al., 2015; Torrealba et al., 2016; Cerny et al., 2021, and references therein). The quest for MW satellite galaxies carried out with the modern facilities opened up the study of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function down to the so-called ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies (see Belokurov, 2013, for discussion and references). These objects provide valuable insights into the mass assembly history of the MW. In addition, the UFDs are the most dark-matter-dominated objects in the Universe, as well as the faintest, oldest and least chemically evolved galaxies known so far (see for example the detailed review by Simon, 2019, and references therein). Therefore, they represent fossil evidence to probe the very early stages of the Universe, such as the epoch of the reionization (e.g. Bovill & Ricotti, 2011; Wheeler et al., 2015). Because of their pristine nature, UFDs are also ideal systems for testing and improving sub-branches of the stellar evolutionary models, such as the synthesis of heavy elements (e.g. Ji et al., 2016).\n\nThe majority of faint galaxies discovered in recent years were identified through a few large sky surveys that offer unprecedented photometric depth, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Willman et al., 2005a, b; Belokurov et al., 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010; Zucker et al., 2006b, a), the Dark Energy Survey (DES; Bechtol et al., 2015; Drlica-Wagner et al., 2015; Kim & Jerjen, 2015; Koposov et al., 2015; Luque et al., 2016), PanSTARRS (Laevens et al., 2015b, a), ATLAS (Torrealba et al., 2016), DELVE (Mau et al., 2020; Cerny et al., 2021, 2023), DESI (Martínez-Delgado et al., 2022; Sand et al., 2022), MagLiteS (Torrealba et al., 2018), HSC-SSP (Homma et al., 2016, 2018, 2019), and UNIONS (Smith et al., 2023b, a). In this study, we expand the search for unknown stellar systems to the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS; de Jong et al., 2013), which has not been exploited yet for this purpose.\n\nKiDS is an extensive multi-band photometric survey conducted using the VLT Survey Telescope (VST; Capaccioli & Schipani, 2011; Capaccioli et al., 2012). KiDS has observed about 1350 square degrees of the sky in the u,g,r𝑢𝑔𝑟u,g,ritalic_u , italic_g , italic_r, and i𝑖iitalic_i bands. KiDS was conceived as a cosmological survey, mainly to use weak gravitational lensing of galaxies to study the assembly of large-scale structures. However, as a side-product of extra-galactic studies, KiDS provides a deep and accurate catalogue of stars, making it suitable to search for low-surface brightness stellar systems in the Local Group. In this letter, we present a new UFD galaxy uncovered in a large-scale search for low-luminosity stellar overdensities over the whole KiDS Data Release 4 area.\n\n2 KiDS Data\n\nWe use the most recent KiDS data release (DR4, Kuijken et al., 2019), which includes 1006 of imaging and catalogue data with limiting 5⁢σ5𝜎5\\sigma5 italic_σ AB magnitudes of 24.23±0.12plus-or-minus24.230.1224.23\\pm 0.1224.23 ± 0.12, 25.12±0.14plus-or-minus25.120.1425.12\\pm 0.1425.12 ± 0.14, 25.02±0.13plus-or-minus25.020.1325.02\\pm 0.1325.02 ± 0.13 and 23.68±0.27plus-or-minus23.680.2723.68\\pm 0.2723.68 ± 0.27 mag in the u𝑢uitalic_u, g𝑔gitalic_g, r𝑟ritalic_r, and i𝑖iitalic_i filters, respectively, that is ≳2greater-than-or-similar-toabsent2\\ga 2≳ 2 mag deeper than SDSS and PanSTARRS DR1. DR4 also includes photometry in the Z,Y,J,H,Ks𝑍𝑌𝐽𝐻subscript𝐾𝑠Z,Y,J,H,K_{s}italic_Z , italic_Y , italic_J , italic_H , italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT infrared (IR) bands obtained with the VISTA Kilo-degree INfrared Galaxy survey (VIKING; Edge et al., 2013) carried out on the VISTA telescope. KiDS covers two different stripes in the sky, a Northern and a Southern stripe (KiDS-N and KiDS-S, hereafter, see Table 2 in Kuijken et al., 2019, for the exact boundaries).\n\nFrom the DR4 catalogue, we selected sources identified as stars, namely objects that are flagged 1, 4 or 5 in the SG2DPHOT column of the catalogue (see A.1.2 in Kuijken et al., 2019). In this way, we obtained a list of 4,422,730 stars in KiDS-N and 3,116,050 stars in KiDS-S . Successively, we filtered out sources with low-quality photometry by imposing a maximum tolerated photometric uncertainty in both g𝑔gitalic_g and r𝑟ritalic_r bands of 0.2 mag. Nonetheless, the catalogues at our disposal still include distant galaxies that have been erroneously classified as stars. To enhance the purity of our catalogues, we took advantage of the multi-band photometry provided by KiDS, utilizing colour-colour diagrams to further purge unresolved galaxies. Specifically, we focused on the g−r𝑔𝑟g-ritalic_g - italic_r versus g−i𝑔𝑖g-iitalic_g - italic_i plot, where stars occupy a distinctive, narrow sequence (see for example Fig. 18 in Kuijken et al., 2019). To this purpose, we selected only sources falling within the boundaries of a polygon defined by the following coordinates (expressed in mag): (g−r,r−i)=(1.25,0.25);(1.25,0.8);(−0.65,−0.05);(−0.65,−0.6)𝑔𝑟𝑟𝑖1.250.251.250.80.650.050.650.6(g-r,r-i)=(1.25,0.25);(1.25,0.8);(-0.65,-0.05);(-0.65,-0.6)( italic_g - italic_r , italic_r - italic_i ) = ( 1.25 , 0.25 ) ; ( 1.25 , 0.8 ) ; ( - 0.65 , - 0.05 ) ; ( - 0.65 , - 0.6 ). It is important to note that we also opted to exclude red stars, characterized by g−r>1.25𝑔𝑟1.25g-r>1.25italic_g - italic_r > 1.25 mag, as this colour range is dominated by M-type dwarf stars located within the MW disk. After the colour-colour selection we are left with 3,558,843 stars, 2,127,949 of which are located within the footprint of KiDS-N and the remaining 1,430,894 stars in KiDS-S.\n\n3 Method\n\nWe tackled the task of unveiling unknown faint MW satellites by identifying the over-densities of stars in the sky relative to the local average stellar background. To achieve this, we utilized the algorithm and the procedure described in Gatto et al. (2020). In addition, to augment the chances of detecting faint stellar systems projected against the dominant MW stellar population, we also followed the approach of Walsh et al. (2009), which has been widely used in recent years for the discovery of low-luminosity galaxies and globular clusters in the Milky Way halo (e.g. Bechtol et al., 2015; Koposov et al., 2015; Torrealba et al., 2016; Homma et al., 2019; Cerny et al., 2021, and references therein). This method consists of a preliminary isochrone-based matched filter on the catalogue of stars. In particular, prior to running the searching algorithm, we selected stars whose positions in the g−r,r𝑔𝑟𝑟g-r,ritalic_g - italic_r , italic_r colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) were within 0.05 mag in colour from a given isochrone representative of an old and metal-poor stellar population , which is characteristic of the faint galaxies expected to inhabit the MW halo. We opted to work with the suite of PARSEC isochrones (Bressan et al., 2012) and the isochrone filter was carried out by adopting three different ages, namely log⁡(t/y⁢r⁢s)𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑠\\log(t/yrs)roman_log ( italic_t / italic_y italic_r italic_s ) = 10.0, 10.06, 10.12 dex and three different metallicities, or [Fe/H] ∼similar-to\\sim∼ -2.2, -1.5, -1.2 dex. Additionally, we varied the distance modulus of the isochrone in a range between 16 and 23.6 mag (corresponding to a range of physical distances between ∼similar-to\\sim∼16 and ∼similar-to\\sim∼520 kpc) with steps of 0.4 mag. Therefore, we scanned the KiDS catalogue with 180 different isochrone filters.\n\nFor each isochrone, we analyse the resulting filtered map as follows. We divide the map into 4°×\\times× 4° regions, and then build density maps using the star coordinates as input parameters, moothed through a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique adopting a Gaussian kernel. Subsequently, the algorithm counts the number of stars (Nstarssubscript𝑁starsN_{\\rm stars}italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stars end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) in each pixel of the sub-field and measures the number of standard deviations above a local mean:\n\nSpxl=(Nstars−Nbkg)/σbkgsubscript𝑆pxlsubscript𝑁starssubscript𝑁bkgsubscript𝜎bkgS_{\\rm pxl}=(N_{\\rm stars}-N_{\\rm bkg})/\\sigma_{\\rm bkg}italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_pxl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stars end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_bkg end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) / italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_bkg end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (1)\n\nwhere Nbkgsubscript𝑁bkgN_{\\rm bkg}italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_bkg end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and σbkgsubscript𝜎bkg\\sigma_{\\rm bkg}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_bkg end_POSTSUBSCRIPT represent the average of the local stellar background and its standard deviation, respectively . In this work, we used a pixel size of 30″×\\times× 30″, and a bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel function of 1′ . As a sanity check, we conducted a validation of the algorithm by assessing its capability to accurately identify known stellar systems residing within the KiDS footprint, including Galactic globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. In this way, our algorithm recovered Leo V with Spxl=21.5subscript𝑆pxl21.5S_{\\rm pxl}=21.5italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_pxl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 21.5, by applying an isochrone filter with log⁡t𝑡\\log troman_log italic_t = 10.06 dex, [Fe/H] ∼similar-to\\sim∼ -2.2 and a distance modulus = 21.2 mag, corresponding to a distance of approximately 175 kpc. This determination closely aligns with the previously estimated distance to the dwarf, which is reported as 173±5plus-or-minus1735173\\pm 5173 ± 5 kpc by Medina et al. (2017).\n\n4 Results\n\nUtilizing the methodology outlined in the previous section, we identified a highly promising over-density in the Sextans constellation. Our detection revealed a Spxl=10.6subscript𝑆pxl10.6S_{\\rm pxl}=10.6italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_pxl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 10.6 stellar over-density by applying an isochrone filter with log⁡(t/y⁢r⁢s)𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑠\\log(t/yrs)roman_log ( italic_t / italic_y italic_r italic_s ) = 10.12 dex, [Fe/H] ∼similar-to\\sim∼ -1.5, and a distance modulus (m−M)0subscript𝑚𝑀0(m-M)_{0}( italic_m - italic_M ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 20.4 magnitudes. The left panel of Figure 1 shows the density map of stars in the region of the newfound galaxy candidate, for the aforementioned isochrone selection filter. The overdensity stands out clearly. The subsequent three panels of the figure illustrate the CMDs of stars within a 5′ radius from the over-density’s centre, the CMD of a representative local field covering an equivalent area, and the Hess diagram derived through the subtraction of the over-density and field CMDs, from left to right, respectively.\n\nThe inspection of these CMDs unveils a well-sampled red giant branch (RGB) within the inner 5′, that is absent in the local field CMD, suggesting the possible detection of a stellar system. Three likely candidate horizontal branch (HB) stars, highlighted as cyan squares in the figure, are found at (g−r,r)≃(0,21−21.5)similar-to-or-equals𝑔𝑟𝑟02121.5(g-r,r)\\simeq(0,21-21.5)( italic_g - italic_r , italic_r ) ≃ ( 0 , 21 - 21.5 ) mag . Unfortunately, the photometric depth of the KiDS data is not sufficient to reach the main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) of the candidate , whose detection would be crucial to confirm it as a genuine stellar system and to assess its properties better. In the next section, we describe the successful follow-up of the candidate with deeper photometry.\n\n4.1 Deeper photometry in HSC-SSP\n\nThe Hyper Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP; Aihara et al., 2018b, a) is a wide-field optical-near infrared survey conducted using the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope. The HSC-SSP is designed to cover approximately 1400 square degrees of the Northern sky across five distinct filters, namely g,r,i,z,y𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑧𝑦g,r,i,z,yitalic_g , italic_r , italic_i , italic_z , italic_y. The survey 5σ𝜎\\sigmaitalic_σ magnitude limits for point-sources are impressively deep: 26.5 mag in the g𝑔gitalic_g band, 26.1 mag in the r𝑟ritalic_r band, and 25.9 mag in the i𝑖iitalic_i band (Aihara et al., 2018b), surpassing the limiting magnitude of the KiDS survey by more than one mag in each passband. HSC-SSP has already demonstrated its power for the detection of low surface-brightness stellar systems (Homma et al., 2016, 2018, 2019). In particular, Homma et al. (2019) reported the discovery of Bootes IV, one of the faintest UFDs identified to date, characterized by surface brightness levels μ≥32𝜇32\\mu\\geq 32italic_μ ≥ 32 mag arcsec−22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT. Since our candidate lies within the HSC-SSP footprint, this survey provides an excellent means to follow it up.\n\nFrom the HSC-SSP catalogue provided by the public third data release (Aihara et al., 2022), which included data for slightly less than 700 square degrees, we selected point-like sources within the region of the newly discovered over-density by means of the extendedness parameter in i−limit-from𝑖i-italic_i -band, which is the filter with the best median seeing (i.e. ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 0.6″, Aihara et al., 2022). To further refine the star-galaxy separation, we used a color-color diagram, as done above for the KiDS data. In this case, we adopted (g−r,z−y)𝑔𝑟𝑧𝑦(g-r,z-y)( italic_g - italic_r , italic_z - italic_y ) diagram that is particularly efficient in this sense. Consequently, we selected all point-like sources located within the polygon defined by the criteria: (g−r,z−y)=(−0.3,−0.12);(−0.3,0.08);(1.2,0.25);(1.2,0)𝑔𝑟𝑧𝑦0.30.120.30.081.20.251.20(g-r,z-y)=(-0.3,-0.12);(-0.3,0.08);(1.2,0.25);(1.2,0)( italic_g - italic_r , italic_z - italic_y ) = ( - 0.3 , - 0.12 ) ; ( - 0.3 , 0.08 ) ; ( 1.2 , 0.25 ) ; ( 1.2 , 0 ). The following sections of this manuscript are based on the analysis of this catalogue.\n\n4.2 Analysis of the CMD\n\nIn Fig. 2 we show the results of the analysis of the deeper HSC-SSP catalogue. The top left panel shows the density map of the stars filtered by the best-fit isochrone (indicated by a red solid line in the bottom row of the same figure), fully confirming the detection of a strong and compact stellar over-density at the expected location. In contrast, the right panel of the same figure illustrates the density map for sources catalogued as galaxies based on the extendedness parameter and subsequently filtered by the same isochrone. Notably, no discernible over-density of galaxies in the same region is observed.\n\nThe panel a𝑎aitalic_a of the second row of Fig. 2 displays the CMD of all stars located within twice the half-light radius of the structure (for the determination of rhsubscript𝑟ℎr_{h}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, please refer to Section 4.3). The Sub Giant Branch (SGB) and the MSTO associated with the RGB already detected in KiDS data are unequivocally revealed. Notably, these features are not present in the CMD of the control field (same area, located 20′ from the centre of the over-density; see also the Hess diagram obtained by subtracting the two former CMDs). This compelling evidence strongly suggests that our candidate is a genuine stellar system, likely a faint local dwarf galaxy, hitherto unreported in the existing literature. In what follows we shall refer to it as Sextans II (KiDS-UFD-1) .\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the CMD also discloses the presence of four stars likely belonging to the HB evolutionary phase Specifically, two stars with colours of -0.06 mag and -0.08 mag reside within the half-light radius of the galaxy. The third star, slightly exceeding the rhsubscript𝑟ℎr_{h}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, has g−r𝑔𝑟g-ritalic_g - italic_r = -0.09 mag, while the fourth one has g−r𝑔𝑟g-ritalic_g - italic_r = 0.03 and is located at ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 8.3′ from the centre of the system (≃1.8⁢rhsimilar-to-or-equalsabsent1.8subscript𝑟ℎ\\simeq 1.8r_{h}≃ 1.8 italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, see Sect. 4.3). The absolute magnitude of the HB is a valuable distance indicator, and we used it as the strongest constraint on the distance modulus. Through a visual isochrone fitting, we re-determined the parameters that provide the best match to the observed CMD: log⁡(t/y⁢r⁢s)≃10.12similar-to-or-equals𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑠10.12\\log(t/yrs)\\simeq 10.12roman_log ( italic_t / italic_y italic_r italic_s ) ≃ 10.12 dex; [F⁢e/H]≃similar-to-or-equalsdelimited-[]𝐹𝑒𝐻absent[Fe/H]\\simeq[ italic_F italic_e / italic_H ] ≃ -2.2 dex and m−M𝑚𝑀m-Mitalic_m - italic_M = 20.8 ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 0.2 mag. This is the red solid line superimposed on all panels in the second row of Fig. 2.\n\nThe resulting distance modulus corresponds to a physical distance of approximately 150 kpc, well within the range of Galactic satellites. The green isochrone overlaid on the panel a𝑎aitalic_a of the second row of Fig. 2 deviates from the best-matching isochrone only in terms of age. Specifically, it has log⁢t=10.00logt10.00{\\rm log\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ t}=10.00roman_log roman_t = 10.00 dex, showing that decreasing the age of the stellar model by ∼±2−3similar-toabsentplus-or-minus23\\sim\\pm 2-3∼ ± 2 - 3 Gyr does not significantly affect the absolute magnitude of the HB (hence our distance estimate), as expected.\n\nFinally, the panel d𝑑ditalic_d of the second row of Fig. 2 presents the CMD of Sextans II, including all stars confined within 4 ×rhabsentsubscript𝑟ℎ\\times\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ r_{h}× italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This larger region enables a more comprehensive search for additional HB stars that might be associated with the system, albeit at the cost of higher contamination from MW stars within the CMD. We identify a potential fifth HB member at ∼similar-to\\sim∼15.9′ from the galaxy centre, corresponding to 3.4 ×rhabsentsubscript𝑟ℎ\\times r_{h}× italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This star has a colour of -0.09 mag, similar to the other three HB stars, and indeed it is barely discernible in the main panel. To enhance the visibility of these four closely colour-matched HB stars, we provide a zoomed-in view of the HB evolutionary phase in an inset at the top of the panel d𝑑ditalic_d, confined to a narrow range of colours encompassing those of the four stars.\n\n4.3 Structural parameters\n\nTo estimate the structural parameters, such as the centre, half-light radius, ellipticity, and position angle of the newfound stellar system, we adopted the maximum likelihood approach presented in Martin et al. (2008). In particular, Martin et al. (2008) model the two-dimensional position of the stars in the sky in the surroundings of the galaxy with the combination of the exponential profile of the galaxy and of a uniform background.\n\nWe adopted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to contemporaneously estimate the free parameters of our model: x0;y0;rh;e;θ;Nstarssubscript𝑥0subscript𝑦0subscript𝑟ℎ𝑒𝜃subscript𝑁starsx_{0};y_{0};r_{h};e;\\theta;N_{\\rm stars}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; italic_e ; italic_θ ; italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stars end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, employing only stars located within the best-fit isochrone mask. Our MCMC implementation utilized 1000 different walkers, each executing a chain composed of 10000 steps. We discarded the first 1000 steps as burn-in, resulting in a robust estimation of the model parameters. The MCMC analysis was conducted using the emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2013) Python library. The best-fit parameters and their uncertainties were determined from the median, 16th, and 84th quantiles of the posterior distributions. In Fig. 3, we present a corner plot displaying the posterior distribution of the six free parameters, while Table 1 lists the median values and uncertainties of these parameters.\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 4 illustrates the radial density profile (RDP) of the system, where r𝑟ritalic_r represents the elliptical radius as defined in eq. 4 in Martin et al. (2008). The red solid line denotes the best fit of the model for the two-dimensional position of the stars in the sky derived by employing the median values of the six parameters obtained through MCMC analysis. It is interesting to note that, both the derived half-light radius rh=194−45+61subscript𝑟ℎsubscriptsuperscript1946145r_{h}=194^{+61}_{-45}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 194 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 61 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 45 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT pc (assuming D⊙=145subscript𝐷direct-product145D_{\\odot}=145italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 145 kpc), and ellipticity e=0.46−0.15+0.11𝑒subscriptsuperscript0.460.110.15e=0.46^{+0.11}_{-0.15}italic_e = 0.46 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 0.11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 0.15 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are well within the range typical for local UFDs (see the latest version of the McConnachie, 2012, catalogue). The right panel of Fig. 4 displays the 2-D relative position of the filtered stars with respect to the galaxy centre, along with ellipses aligned according to the position angle determined by the MCMC procedure. These ellipses are defined by semi-major axes of 2⁢rh2subscript𝑟ℎ2r_{h}2 italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (dashed ellipse) and 4⁢rh4subscript𝑟ℎ4r_{h}4 italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (solid ellipse). Additionally, we indicate the relative position of the five stars in the HB evolutionary stage as cyan diamonds.

Our approach follows the methodology reported in Martin et al. (2008), which is based on Monte Carlo sampling of a synthetic CMD representative of Sextans II. Specifically, we built a synthetic stellar population with log⁡(t/y⁢r⁢s)=10.12𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑠10.12\\log(t/yrs)=10.12roman_log ( italic_t / italic_y italic_r italic_s ) = 10.12 dex; [Fe/H] ∼similar-to\\sim∼-2.2 dex, placed at a distance modulus 20.8 mag. We considered a total of Nstars=52±12subscript𝑁starsplus-or-minus5212N_{\\rm stars}=52\\pm 12italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stars end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 52 ± 12, that is the value obtained from the MCMC approach by adopting a cut at r=24𝑟24r=24italic_r = 24 mag, which is a conservative threshold adopted to mitigate potential issues of completeness in the central regions of the galaxy that might bias the estimation of its absolute magnitude. We generated 1000 realizations of the CMD, populating it with a Kroupa (2002) initial mass function (IMF), and subsequently computed the average absolute magnitude in the g𝑔gitalic_g and r𝑟ritalic_r SDSS filters, as well as in the Johnson V𝑉Vitalic_V band . Additionally, we determined the stellar mass of the galaxy. The median values, along with the 16th and 84th quantiles, were adopted to represent the best values and associated uncertainties, respectively. These results are presented in the final rows of Table 1.\n\nFigure 5 depicts the MVsubscript𝑀𝑉M_{V}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-rhsubscript𝑟ℎr_{h}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT plane for galaxies and candidate galaxies reported in catalog by McConnachie (2012) (version 2021), as well as for Galactic Globular Clusters included in the catalog by Harris (1996) (version 2010). The position of Sextans II within this plot clearly establishes it as one of the UFDs with the lowest surface brightness discovered to date, although it is important to note that some extremely faint low-surface brightness galaxies identified in recent years may not be represented in this figure.\n\n5 Summary and conclusions\n\nIn this letter we report on the discovery of an old and metal-poor stellar system located in the outskirts of the Milky Way, Sextans II (KiDS-UFD-1). This discovery resulted from an extensive search for low-surface brightness stellar systems in the MW halo within the KiDS survey catalogues. The KiDS detection, limited by photometric depth to the RGB and HB of the system, was confirmed with deeper HSC-SSP photometry which clearly unveiled the old MS of Sextans II down to about 1 mag below the MSTO.The isochrone fitting of the CMD revealed that the newly discovered system is ancient (t ≥\\geq≥ 10 Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H] ≤\\leq≤ -1.5), and is located at a distance of D⊙≃145similar-to-or-equalssubscript𝐷direct-product145D_{\\odot}\\simeq 145italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 145 kpc from the Sun and RG⁢C≃128.8similar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑅𝐺𝐶128.8R_{GC}\\simeq 128.8italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G italic_C end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 128.8 kpc from the center of the Galaxy. The structural parameters of Sextans II are typical of UFDs in the Local Group, strongly suggesting that the new system is a faint spheroidal satellite of the MW at the low end of the surface brightness distribution of local dwarfs. The most plausible alternative hypothesis is a disrupting globular cluster. However, even the most extended known globular clusters in the MW have rh≤30.0subscript𝑟ℎ30.0r_{h}\\leq 30.0italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≤ 30.0 pc, more than five times smaller than what we determined for Sextans II, hence the UDF hypothesis is, by far, the most likely. The final word on the nature of the system can be provided only by a proper spectroscopic follow up of a reasonable sample of member stars, that may be challenging, given the magnitude range spanned by candidate RGB members . The chemical composition can reveal the presence of a metallicity spread, while the kinematics can reveal the amount of non-baryonic dark matter required to keep the system at the dynamical equilibrium, both features that are generally used to discriminate between dwarf galaxies and star clusters (Willman & Strader, 2012).\n\nThe research of unknown stellar systems is still ongoing, and Sextans II might not be the only newfound stellar system detected in the KiDS DR4 catalog. Moreover this work underscores the importance of extending this research to the forthcoming fifth release of the KiDS survey, that will provide multi-band photometric data covering the entire 1350 square degrees of the KiDS footprint. This discovery serves as a reminder that the census of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxy population is far from complete. The upcoming wide and deep surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) set to be conducted at the imminent Vera Rubin Observatory, will likely contribute significantly to expanding our knowledge of Milky Way satellites, much like the impactful contributions of the SDSS and PanSTARRS surveys before it.\n\nAcknowledgements.\n\nBased on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme IDs 177.A-3016, 177.A-3017, 177.A-3018 and 179.A-2004, and on data products produced by the KiDS consortium.
