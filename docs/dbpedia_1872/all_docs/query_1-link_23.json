        "text": "Introduction\n\nVersion 4.94 (September 6, 2022)\n\nPurpose and Scope\n\nThe JPL Horizons on-line ephemeris system provides access to solar system data and customizable production of accurate ephemerides for observers, mission-planners, researchers, and the public, by numerically characterizing the location, motion, and observability of solar system objects as a function of time, as seen from locations within the solar system.\n\nAvailable objects include 1,229,000+ asteroids, 3822 comets, 211 natural satellites, all planets, the Sun, 202 spacecraft, and several dynamical points such as Earth-Sun L1, L2, L4, L5, Earth-Moon L1, L2, L4, L5 and planetary system barycenters. Ephemerides, lighting, and visibility for points on the surface of distant bodies may also be generated.\n\nAberrated sky location angles and angular rates can be characterized using right-ascension and declination in three coordinate systems, along with azimuth and elevation, sky-motion rates, and position angle, as a function of time and observer location. For comets and asteroids, corresponding statistical uncertainties and plane-of-sky error ellipse parameters can be generated as a function of time.\n\nTarget visibility in the sky can be assessed with magnitude, extinction, airmass, and visual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to background sky brightening caused by atmosphere-scattered moonlight, with Sun and Moon sky-presence and twilight-dawn indicators.\n\nTarget-body rise, maximum elevation, transit, and set may be identified along with eclipse circumstances for non-Earth natural satellites.\n\nSub-observer and sub-solar cartographic latitude and longitude can be returned for targets (or sites on targets) having defined rotational models.\n\nClose-approaches by asteroids and comets to planetary bodies (and sixteen of the largest asteroids) can be rapidly and automatically identified, along with their encounter uncertainties and impact probabilities.\n\nTables of vectors or osculating orbital elements of one body with respect to another can be produced to characterize relative motion and orbit geometry as a function of time.\n\nSPK binary file output can be plugged into user programs to reproduce the numerically integrated time-continuous state of small-body targets at any instant for remote usage. The SPK files can be used by existing visualization, animation and mission-design software that incorporate appropriate SPICE Toolkit readers.\n\nIn total, more than 100 different observational and physical aspect quantities can be requested at intervals for both topocentric and geocentric situations in one of 9 coordinate systems and 4 time scales (TDB, TT, UT, Civil).\n\nUsers may conduct parameter searches of the comet/asteroid database, searching for objects based on combinations of up to 42 different parameters, or define their own objects by specifying heliocentric IAU76/80 osculating elements, then use the system to accurately integrate the trajectory. Geocentric SGP4/SDP4 Two-Line Element (TLE) format data can also be specified and propagated by users to define an Earth-orbiting artificial satellite.\n\nOver 2300 predefined Earth station locations are available, along with sites on other major bodies, in addition to being able to use spacecraft as âobserving sitesâ from which to generate relative ephemerides. Users may define their own topocentric observing site coordinates on any planet or natural satellite having a known rotational model, if the desired site is not predefined.\n\nThe underlying solar system data from which output is derived is kept current to reflect the latest measurements, models, and solutions. It is typically the same data used at JPL for radar astronomy, mission planning, and spacecraft navigation.\n\nResults are suitable for tracking systems, observers, mission planners, and other researchers, although such determination is ultimately the usersâ responsibility.\n\nThe information is grouped into five general types of customizable output requests:\n\nObservables (plane-of-sky angles, rates, visibility, physical aspect)\n\nOsculating orbital elements\n\nCartesian state vectors\n\nClose approaches to planets and 16 largest asteroids\n\nSPK binary trajectory files (asteroids and comets only)\n\nThe first four are ASCII tables containing output at user-specified discrete time-steps. SPK requests return time-continuous binary files. Output is returned to the user via screen display, API query, e-mail, or FTP protocols. Table types 1-3 can be requested in a format suitable for spreadsheet import.\n\nOverview of Usage\n\nThere are four supported ways to access the program. All can be automated:\n\nBrowser (passive interactive GUI interface):\n\nPoint your browser to https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html\n\nAPI (GET and POST programmatic interface)\n\nSee documentation at https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html\n\nCommand-line (full access, active interactive prompt-based interface):\n\nConnect keyboard directly to the system telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775.\n\nNo account or password is required.\n\nSpecify an object to get a summary data screen.\n\nFollow prompts. At any prompt, type ? or ?! for short or long explanations of the prompt.\n\nTransmit results to your system by e-mail or FTP\n\nE-mail (full access, except for SPK file production, batch interface):\n\nSend e-mail to horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov with subject âBATCH-LONGâ.\n\nAn example command file will be mailed back to you.\n\nEdit this text file, then mail it back with the subject header âJOBâ\n\nResults of your request are mailed back to you.\n\nThe Horizons system was intended to be easy to use and should have a step-function learning curve. The main requirement to get started is understanding how connect to the system and then select âtargetâ objects.\n\nThe remainder of this documentation summarizes details of system capabilities and interpretation of the output. Check the end of each ephemeris generated for a specific explanation of what was returned.\n\nThis document often describes âtypingâ certain things, presupposing the interactive command-line interface is being used. If one is instead using the browser interface, these operations are typically done by using a pull down menu or check-box. The e-mail and API interfaces typically involve setting an appropriate command-file variable to accomplish the same thing.\n\nWhile using the command-line interface, type â?â or â?!â at any prompt for an explanation of options. Type â-â at any prompt to move backward to the previous prompt. âxâ exits the system immediately.\n\nSee the Acknowledgements section for contact information.\n\nTo be actively alerted to major changes such as new capabilities and operational changes, subscribe to the announcements list. It is generally low-traffic and has historically been used once or twice a year:\n\nhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/email_list.html\n\nA more frequently updated âsystem newsâ is also available by typing ânewsâ within the command-line interface, or from the URL below. âNewsâ reports all significant changes, not just major changes, and can include supplementary information on system usage, but you have to actively check it:\n\nhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/news.html\n\nConnecting to the System\n\nCommand-line\n\nThe Horizons on-line ephemeris and data system is available as a command-line terminal service. This is intended for people who want quick access to all program features with an interactive keyboard-type interface. User response to a series of guided-prompts sets up the desired output.\n\nFrom a telnet-capable machine, running a âVT100â-type terminal model, connect to âssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775â:\n\nFrom UNIX/LINUX/MacOSX command line:\n\ntelnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775\n\nâ¦ where 6775 is a required port number.\n\nAlternatively, from within a web-browser that supports telnet, enter a URL of this form:\n\ntelnet://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov:6775\n\nHowever, few modern browsers may recognize this form without additional configuration by the user.\n\nThe system will start a terminal session automatically. No user-ID or password is required. If the connection is refused, the two most likely causes are:\n\nThe port number was not specified or passed along by software:\n\nA few PC-type telnet programs do not to fully implement the telnet protocol and may not pass the port number to the network, or may need to be reconfigured to function properly, or may have a different syntax for specifying port numbers. Check your usersâ guide for information.\n\nThere is a firewall security restriction at your end\n\nContact your local computer system administrator in this case. Since no password or security information is exchanged, you may be able to request a firewall exception from your institution (âpoke a holeâ).\n\nThe command-line interface can be automated. However, this is no longer recommended given the APIs introduced in 2021. Deprecated example scripts may be found in the FTP directory <fhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/xfr/SCRIPTS/> and will be supported indefinately.\n\nCommand-line capability can be restored to recent MacOS systems if necessary using these two commands from within a Mac terminal window connected to the Internet:\n\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nbrew install inetutils\n\nThis installs âtelnetâ and âftpâ commands used for Mac terminal connections. However, file retrieval can be done without FTP using the already-available âcurlâ terminal command:. For example,\n\ncurl -s \"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/ssd/SCRIPTS/README\"\n\nWeb\n\nPoint your browser to: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html\n\nThis graphical interface is intended for the more casual user or general public but offers access to program features using pull-down menus, fill-in boxes and clickable buttons.\n\nUsers should verify default settings such as timescale, coordinate system, and desired output quantities are appropriate and as intended for the run.\n\nAPI\n\nAn API designed for direct programmatic access and automation (âmachine-to-machineâ) is available. Query parameters are specified either on a URL (GET), or in a file provided to the API when it is called (POST).\n\nDocumentation specific to the API interface is here:\n\nGET (URL encoded requests):\n\nhttps://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html\n\nPOST (file-based requests) :\n\nhttps://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons_file.html\n\nE-mail\n\nHorizons can also be controlled by sending e-mail messages to the address\n\nhorizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov\n\nSystem action is determined by the e-mail âsubjectâ set by the user.\n\nThe e-mail âprogramming-likeâ interface is generally for those who want access to most program features without the overhead of answering prompts or manipulating graphical interfaces; generally those already familiar with what the program does and who know what they want, and who might have local firewall problems with other interfaces.\n\nYou might set up an input file that does what you want once, and then make only minor changes to it thereafter, such as specifying a different object for a new run.\n\nAn example usage-case for the e-mail interface might be generation of rise-transit-set times for an object over decades. The request (or series of requests) can be submitted by email. Results will be returned when complete without the user having to be present, keep a connection open, or monitor a potentially lengthy process; a âfire and forgetâ mode of operation.\n\nIt offers the additional ability of allowing users to specify up to 10000 discrete times (to aid astrometric reduction) and up to 200 objects at once, although results are returned as a separate e-mail for each object. The e-mail interface does not currently allow the SPK file production available using the command-line interface or API.\n\nIMPORTANT: Please be sure your email client is sending content as plain ASCII text. Not doing so may result in no response from the system or an error message, even when your command-file appears perfectly normal from within your email client.\n\nE-mail requests to Horizons may be most practical for those working in a UNIX/Linux/MacOS terminal or command-line environment, with plain-text programming-type editors available such as vi, emacs, atom, sublime, and with mailers like mailx, or similar.\n\nModern graphical e-mail systems (gmail, Outlook, etc.) often assume they are communicating with other e-mail systems like themselves and insert hidden font and formatting codes that Horizons cannot currently interpret. There can also be issues with 8-bit character sets, such as generated by keyboards set up for use with non-US languages.\n\nA helpful (if dated) guide to suitably configuring some email clients for plain-text is available via this link:\n\nhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/Configuring_Mail_Clients_to_Send_Plain_ASCII_Text.pdf\n\nâ¦ but, in general, consult your mailerâs documentation on how to activate any plain-text mode that might be available.\n\nTo get started with the e-mail interface, send e-mail to the above address with the subject âBATCH-LONGâ. The latest, fully-commented example command-file will be mailed back. Edit this file to produce the results you want, then mail back with the subject âJOBâ.\n\nNote that the e-mail command file that is returned returned defines the identical settings used by the API interface, so is relevant there also.\n\nRecognized e-mail commands in the âSubject:â line are:\n\nSUBJECT HEADER MEANING -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- JOB Horizons run-stream DOC-TEXT Request ASCII (plain-text) version of current documentation DOC-PS Request PostScript version of current documentation BATCH-LONG Request latest fully commented example batch file BATCH-BRIEF Request latest example batch file without comments QUESTION Message forwarded to cognizant engineer\n\nThose automating e-mail interactions with Horizons should take a prudent approach for best results. For example, space requests at 1-2 seconds before sending the next. This reduces the chance of requests getting categorized as spam and diverted at some point along the route, which can happen if a script tries to send 1000 e-mail requests in 0.1 seconds.\n\nIncoming e-mail requests are queued and processed in the order received, one at a time. Results will typically be returned within a few seconds, depending on the request, but can also be delayed minutes or even longer if there are a number of requests to process ahead of yours, or if the specific request is a time-consuming by nature, or the receiving mail agent only checks for incoming at some preset interval.\n\nSeparate tools (for example, âprocmailâ) can be used automatically extract Horizons output from incoming e-mail and deposit in a local file.\n\nGeneral Definitions\n\nThe remainder of this document will use some terms and abbreviations defined below:\n\nReference Frame\n\nThe set of three axes at right angles to each other that define the cartesian (x, y, z) basis directions. The x and y axes define a reference plane from which declination or latitude is measured. The z-direction is at right angles to that x-y plane and defines the âpoleâ. The x-direction defines the origin from which right ascension or longitude is measured.\n\nHorizons may use â depending on circumstance and sometimes user-request â the following reference frames:\n\nICRF (International Celestial Reference Frame, equatorial-aligned radio frame)\n\nEarth true-of-date (IAU76/80)\n\nEarth ecliptic of-date (IAU76/80)\n\nEarth ecliptic at J2000 epoch (IAU76/80)\n\nIAU body-frame of-date (equatorial)\n\nLunar mean Earth (DE421)\n\nFK4/B1950 (equatorial)\n\nEarth ecliptic at B1950 epoch\n\nEcliptic\n\nIn this reference frame, the x-y plane is based on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. Since the Earthâs orbit plane fluctuates slightly due to gravitational perturbations, the ecliptic chosen can be at a fixed standard time (such as the J2000.0 epoch 2000-Jan-1.5) providing an inertial frame, or instead the time of interest (âof-dateâ), providing a dynamic frame, depending on the purpose. Both amount to adopting a standard due to definitional ambiguities caused by the Earth and Moonâs mutual motion affecting the Earthâs orbit plane.\n\nWhen transforming between the underlying ICRF reference frame, Horizons uses the IAU76/80 fixed obliquity of 84381.448 arcsec at the J2000.0 standard epoch, and an associated time-varying model for âof-dateâ ecliptic.\n\nWhen transforming between FK4/B1950, a fixed obliquity of 84404.8362512 arcseconds is used at the standard epoch, with an associated time-varying model for other instants.\n\nNorth\n\nFor planets and natural satellites, the spin-pole direction extending to the positive side of the plane defined by the solar systemsâ positive angular momentum vector.a For asteroids and comets, north is along the bodyâs spin-axis positive angular momentum direction\n\nEast\n\nThe counter-clockwise direction around the north-pole of rotation.\n\nRA\n\nRight ascension; the angular distance on the celestial sphere counter-clockwise (eastward) along the celestial equator from the reference equinox to the meridian of the object. RA is analogous to longitude, with the plane containing the equinox defining zero RA much as the Greenwich meridian defines zero longitude. There are different types of RA, described below, depending on what coordinate system and aberrations are requested. Values are expressed in sexagesimal time units of hours, minutes, and seconds OR decimal angular degrees, as requested.\n\nDEC\n\nDeclination; the angular distance on the celestial sphere north (positive) or south (negative) of the reference frame equator. It is analogous to latitude. As with RA, there are different types of DEC, described below, depending on what coordinate system and aberrations are requested. Usually expressed in decimal angular degrees.\n\nAZ\n\nAzimuth; the angle measured clockwise from the north along the horizon defined by the plane perpendicular to the local zenith to the point where the meridian passing through local zenith and the object intersects the horizon plane.\n\nEL\n\nElevation; the angular distance above or below the plane perpendicular to the local zenith. Note this plane is not necessarily the visible horizon, due to station elevation â the âhorizon dipâ effect.\n\nGeometric Coordinates\n\nThe instantaneous (âtrueâ) position of a body at a particular instant. These coordinates are referred to the x-y basis of a particular reference frame (ICRF or FK4/B1950 or their standard ecliptic variations) and primarily of interest to those doing dynamical modeling.\n\nAstrometric Coordinates\n\nPositions or values (such as RA and DEC) which account for the finite but varying amount of time it takes light to travel from the target to the observer, expressed with respect to the x-y basis definitions of a particular inertial reference frame, such as ICRF or FK4/B1950.\n\nWhen an object is at some position, an observer far away will still see it at a prior position that depends on how far away the observer is, due to the finite speed of light\n\nAstrometric coordinates are generally used when comparing positions to nearby stars in a star catalog. Nearby catalog stars experience essentially the same aberrational position shift due to observer motion such that stellar aberration is not considered when comparing to nearby stars.\n\nApparent Coordinates\n\nPositions or values (like RA and DEC) which take into account factors that appear to change the target position with respect to the background coordinate system: light-time, the deflection of light due to large or nearby masses, and stellar aberration.\n\nApparent coordinates can be with respect to an inertial frame such as ICRF or FK4/B1950, such as for space-based observers (spacecraft) or, for observers on a rotating surface, with respect to some âof-dateâ coordinate system, involving precession-nutation to the Earthâs true-equator and equinox-of-date (or that of a non-Earth body associated with the observer location).\n\nApparent positions are usually of interest to telescope systems on the surface of rotating body that are aligned with the pole at each instant and carried along as that pole precesses and nutates.\n\nFor space-based systems not linked to a rotating surface, the ICRF or FK4/B1950 inertial reference frame is used, and the aberrations that change apparent positions relative to that background reference frame are included.\n\nRefracted Coordinates\n\nApparent coordinates can additionally be corrected for atmospheric refraction. Available only for Earth-based sites, this ultimately is a function of the local atmosphere and weather between target and observer, which can only be approximately known. Some observatories have developed their own local refraction tables.\n\nSmall Body\n\nRefers to a comet or asteroid for which the trajectory is numerically integrated on demand from an initial set of previously statistically estimated orbital elements in the JPL database. Typically, no cartographic coordinate system is available for these objects, but there are a growing number of exceptions.\n\nMajor Body\n\nRefers to planet, natural satellite, spacecraft, Sun, barycenter, or other objects having pre-computed trajectories.\n\nOnly major bodies can be coordinate centers (observing sites) in Horizons. Their state vectors are obtained by interpolating previously defined ephemerides, such as DE441. Interpolation generally recovers the state to the millimeter level.\n\nIn some special cases, an asteroid or comet can be defined as a major body. An example might be a particular asteroid solution used for a spacecraft mission flyby or other historically âfixedâ purpose, such as the Eros solution for the NEAR mission.\n\nIn such cases, the particular trajectory is precomputed and stored as a âmajor bodyâ, while the objectsâ ground-based solution otherwise continues to be updated in the JPL small-body database as new observations are reported. Therefore, it may be possible to use either the fixed (historical) major-body trajectory solution or the âlatestâ small-body solution. Details for the specific cases are given in the objectâs data-sheet summaries.\n\nTarget Body\n\nRefers to the object of interest for which an ephemeris is to be created. Selected by the user. It can be a major-body or small-body.\n\nCenter (or coordinate origin, or observering location)\n\nThis is the point to which output quantities for the target (such as coordinates) are referred: (0,0,0). It is typically where the observer is located.\n\nAn observation point is âtopocentricâ if on the surface of a body with a known rotational state.\n\nIf at the center of a physical body, the observing point is âbodycentricâ (with âgeocentricâ referring to the particular case of origin at the Earthâs center).\n\nIf at the center-of-mass of some dynamical system, the center or observer is âbarycentricâ.\n\nPrimary Body\n\nRefers to closest body about which a target body orbits. For natural satellites, this would be a planet, although they orbit the Sun as well. For planets and small-bodies, the primary body is the Sun.\n\nInterfering Body\n\nRefers to the largest body in a system other than the one the observer is on, or the target.\n\nFor example, for an observer on the Earth, the âinterfering bodyâ is the Moon. If the observer is on the Moon, the interfering body is the Earth.\n\nThe location of the interfering body can be of interest because it can affect local sky brightness due to its reflectivity and closeness in the sky to the target.\n\nDeflecting Body\n\nRefers to the largest mass in the observersâ system; it can be used to estimate the gravitational bending (deflection) of light, in addition to that of the Sun. This can change the apparent position of an object slightly with respect to the background coordinate system.\n\nObject Selection\n\nWhen connecting by command-line, the primary thing one must know to use Horizons effectively is how to select objects. Once the user gets things started by selecting an object, everything else is prompted.\n\nSelecting an object can amount to just typing in its name or designation or IAU number and pressing return, but it is helpful to understand a few more things to avoid confusion in some situations.\n\nThere are two categories of objects in Horizons:\n\nMajor Bodies (planets, natural satellites, spacecraft, special cases):\n\nMajor bodies are represented in pre-computed trajectory files which are interpolated to very accurately retrieve position and velocity at any instant.\n\nSmall Bodies (comets and asteroids):\n\nSmall-bodies have their statistically estimated position and velocity at one instant compactly stored in a database as initial conditions and are then numerically integrated on-demand by Horizons, to other times of interest, using the necessary physics.\n\nThese two categories partly result from the objects being stored differently and partly from the historical overlap in the numbering and naming of bodies.\n\nFor example, since there is a natural satellite named Io as well as an asteroid named Io, there has to be some way to distinguish between them and it might as well be possible to do that immediately when formulating the look-up instead of always getting a list back asking âwhich one?â\n\nWhen an object is specified, the request is first examined for optional âkeywordsâ or a semicolon symbol that tells the system more about what is wanted.\n\nIf there arenât any keywords, the system will then try to match against the major body list. If a match is found among the list of major bodies, it will be displayed. If no match is found among the major bodies, it will then continue on and match against the small-body database.\n\nFor example, if you simply input âIoâ, it will return a list of matches from among the major bodies, including the moon of Jupiter, and then stop, waiting for the user to clarify by uniquely specifying one object. To uniquely specify Io, enter its unique ID number, â501â (which was displayed on the previous list of multiple matches).\n\nTo instead select the small-body named Io immediately, provide more information by specifying it one of these ways:\n\nHorizons> Io; (Semi-colon tells Horizons its a small-body look-up)\n\nHorizons> 85 (No match on major body, so search âfalls throughâ to small-body number look-up)\n\nHorizons> 85; (Semi-colon tells Horizons its a small-body look-up)\n\nHorizons> NAME= Io; (Keyword âNAMEâ tells Horizons its an asteroid or comet small-body look-up)\n\nHorizons> ASTNAM= Io; (Keyword âASTNAMâ tells Horizons its an asteroid name)\n\nFurther details, discussion, and examples follow.\n\nMajor Bodies\n\nType MB to get a list of all major-body strings that can be used to search on. To select a major body, enter one of the following:\n\nA string to search on (Mars or Trit). Case insensitive.\n\nA JPL ID integer code or fragment\n\nAn IAU number\n\nExamples (at the main prompt):\n\nHorizons> mars bary (uniquely select Mars barycenter; â4â does the same)\n\nHorizons> mars (list all major bodies with âmarsâ in an ID field)\n\nHorizons> 501 (uniquely select Io)\n\nHorizons> N* (list all major bodies with ânâ in an ID field)\n\nOnce a major-body is uniquely identified, a screen of data will be displayed for confirmation purposes. This display generally consists of various measured parameters for the body, drawn from published literature and displayed for informational purposes.\n\nNote that there is often more than one determination in the literature for many of the displayed parameters, and that they are subject to revision as more data are accumulated.\n\nSuch display values in major-body data sheets are NOT used in the subsequent ephemeris calculations. This differs from the small-body confirmation data screens, which are extracted from a JPL database and ARE what is used to initialize a Horizons small-body integration.\n\nPlanetary systems may have two associated integer ID numbers assigned. Those greater than 100 and ending in 99 (199, 299, 399, 499, 599, 699, 799, 899, 999) refer to the planet CENTER only.\n\nTo instead select planetary (system) BARYCENTERS, use the numeric ID codes less than 10 and greater than or equal to 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This selects the center-of-mass the objects in the planetary system move with respect to, including the planet itself and its natural satellites.\n\nFor example, 399 is the Earthâs center, 3 is the Earth-Moon Barycenter point about which the Earth and Moon both move, and 301 is the center of the Moon.\n\nFor Mercury and Venus, there is no difference between planet-center and system barycenter (1=199, 2=299) as far as Horizons selection is concerned because there is only the planet: no satellites, so no offset between planet center and planetary system center-of-mass.\n\n0 and ssb refer to the solar system barycenter (SSB).\n\n10 and sun refer to the center of the Sun.\n\nIf a planet name is entered, it may not be considered unique if a distinct system barycenter is available. For example, if Saturn is entered, a list containing âSaturnâ and the âSaturn Barycenterâ will be returned. To specify Saturn (the planet-center), you must use its unique ID code, 699.\n\nA unique ID code will be displayed whenever there are multiple matches, to help users select between objects and unambiguously specify the desired object. If you can remember the unique ID codes, it is always best to specify them instead of a name immediately followed by having to enter the code anyway to resolve the name ambiguity.\n\nSystem barycenters are available over longer time-spans than planet-centers because planet-centers are defined by satellite solutions. These satellite solutions are based on shorter data arcs than the entire system and can therefore be extrapolated only over shorter time-spans.\n\nFor example, the planet Jupiter 599 might be available over the interval 1600-2500, while the Jupiter system barycenter 5 is available over 9999 B.C. to A.D. 9999.\n\nNote that if youintend to generate an osculating orbital element ephemeris, you may want to specify barycenters to avoid having high frequency local system orbital motion aliased into the results.\n\nFor example, if you request orbital elements of the Earth (399) with respect to Sun (10), the resulting elements will contain short-period oscillations due to the Earthâs motion with respect to the Earth-Moon barycenter, as well as the Sunâs motion with respect to the solar system barycenter. Unless these short period motions are desired, you might want to instead request 3 with respect to 0 (Earth-Moon barycenter with respect to solar system barycenter).\n\nSurface Targets:\n\nHorizons can also compute ephemerides for targets that are on the surface of extended, rotating target bodies (generally, âmajor bodiesâ): Moon, Sun, planets, natural satellites, or other bodies with a defined rotational model.\n\nExample targets might be specific craters, topographic features, or spacecraft landing sites.\n\nTo specify a target on the surface of a major body that has a defined shape and rotation model, the most general form of input allows two types of coordinates, both in units of degrees and km:\n\nGeodetic/planetodetic coordinates:\n\n{g: E.Long, latitude, h @ } BODY\n\nCylindrical coordinates:\n\n{c: E.Long, DXY, DZ @ } BODY\n\nâ¦ where the brackets {} indicate optional components of the general specification.\n\nFor example, while 301 specifies the target to be the center of the Moon, and Apollo-11 @ 301 specifies the Apollo-11 landing site as target, the following â¦\n\ng: 348.8, -43.3, 0 @ 301\n\nâ¦ specifies an ephemeris for the crater Tycho on the Moon (body 301), at geodetic (planetodetic) coordinates 348.8 degrees east longitude, -43.3 degrees latitude (south), and zero km altitude with respect to the Moonâs mean-Earth reference frame and ellipsoid surface.\n\nTo input cylindrical coordinates using the âc:â prefix. DXY is distance from the spin axis in the body equator plane in km. DZ is distance above (+) or below (-) that plane, also in km.\n\nWhen a surface target is specified, two new markers are placed in observer table output. They indicate if the target point on the surface is lit by the Sun and if it is on the near or far-side of the target body relative to the observer.\n\nAltered descriptions are printed at the end of the output ephemeris tables as warranted to describe the output.\n\nSmall Bodies\n\nTo select an asteroid or comet, enter one or more parameters to search on, separated by a semi-colon, â;â.\n\nType SB for a list of 42 field keywords that can be used to search, or see the list later in this document. Match symbols are from the set { >, <, <>, = }.\n\nThe most direct and unambiguous way to look up a small-body is to specify its unique designation (and use a keyword to be sure). For example:\n\nDES= 1990 MU;\n\nDES= 2015 HM10;\n\nThe keyword can typically be dropped and the designation alone entered, along with a semi-colon:\n\n1990 MU;\n\n2015 HM10;\n\nâ¦ however, if the desired or unique response is not obtained, try the full keyword specification using âDES=â. If the small-body has a permanent IAU ID number, that can also be used for direct look-up without a keyword:\n\n1; (retrieves â1 Ceresâ)\n\n433; (retrieves â433 Erosâ)\n\n4179; (retrieves â4179 Toutatisâ)\n\nDesignation is only one of the small-body look-up keywords available, as indicated by the âSBâ list mentioned above and discussed in more detail later in this document.\n\nFor example, âA < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S, GM <> 0; â searches for all S-type small-bodies with semi-major axis less than 2.5 au and inclination greater than 7.8 degrees with a known (non-zero) GM.\n\nSpaces in the look-up command are not considered, nor are upper/lower-case distinctions. Exceptions are object names and designations. Name searches consider spaces. Designation searches consider spaces AND upper/lower-case.\n\nIf you want to match a fragment of a name or designation, end it with an asterisk (*). For example, DES = 1993&ast;). Otherwise, it is assumed a complete name or designation is specified and the search must match exactly and completely.\n\nThe â*â symbol is NOT a positional wildcard match but only a switch that activates matching on the preceding sub-string. Horizons searches do not support UNIX regular expressions or pattern matching syntax.\n\nFor example:\n\nNAME = CERES; (matches only if object name is âCeresâ)\n\nNAME = CER*; (match âCeresâ, âLucernaâ, âCiceroâ, etc.)\n\nThe same keyword can be used more than once in a search command.\n\nFor example, IN >10; IN < 20; will list those objects possessing an inclination between 10 and 20 degrees. If the directive LIST; is in the search request, the matched parameters will be displayed. For example, IN > 150; LIST will display the inclination of each object with inclination greater than 150 degrees.\n\nOnce a small-body is uniquely identified, a screen of data will be displayed. This data display shows the parameters retrieved from the JPL small-body database and are what will be used in subsequent ephemeris calculations (unlike the situation with major bodies, whose confirmation screen values are drawn from published literature for information purposes only and generally will not be used in subsequent calculations).\n\nIf more than one small-body matches the parameters, a list of matching objects is instead displayed. Individual objects from the matched list can then be requested by giving the displayed ârecord numberâ, followed by a semi-colon. This record number is not necessarily permanent and is valid only for the immediately prior search.\n\nThe semi-colon is used to indicate a small-body request and resolve number ambiguities. For example, entering â1â will select Mercury Barycenter. Enter â1;â to retrieve the small-body in record 1 (Ceres).\n\nOsculating elements for more than one comet apparition may be listed (âapparitionâ refers to a particular perihelion passage), since out-gassing near perihelion can alter the orbit for each passage. Select an apparition from the list with the closest epoch prior to the date of interest for the ephemeris, or add the âCAPâ directive to the search to automatically select the closest apparition of interest:\n\nCAP; (return last apparition before current date)\n\nCAP < JD#; (return last apparition before specified Julian Day Number)\n\nCAP < YEAR; (return last apparition before given integer year)\n\nIf the number after a < in a CAP; specification is less than 10000, it is interpreted as a year integer. Otherwise, the number is taken to be a Julian Day Number. If CAP; is specified, the search is automatically recognized as being a comets-only search.\n\nThe record (or file) number of unnumbered asteroids and comet apparitions should NOT be considered constants; they WILL change as the database is updated.\n\nTo enter your own heliocentric ecliptic elements, type ; within the command-line interface. This capability is described in more detail in a later section. Web-interface, API, and e-mail interfaces have settings or menus to specify user-input objects.\n\nExample queries follow. Where more than one example is given, the first is most likely to complete as intended.\n\nFor example, ASTNAM = Vesta; will always return the asteroid. However, if you use the convenient form Vesta, which is allowed, it is possible that a future natural satellite or spacecraft name will someday include that string and there will no longer be a unique match. A good habit might be to include at least one semi-colon in all small-body searches so as to be unambiguous.\n\nSearch for objects matching a set of parameters:\n\nHorizons> A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0; (asteroid & comets)\n\nHorizons> A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0; AST; (asteroids only)\n\nHorizons> A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0; COM; (comets only)\n\nMatch by name:\n\nHorizons> ASTNAM= Vesta;\n\nHorizons> Vesta;\n\nHorizons> Vesta\n\nMatch by name fragment:\n\nHorizons> NAME= mua*; (Objects with names containing âmuaâ)\n\nHorizons> mua*;\n\nâWildcardâ match designation:\n\nHorizons> DES = 1993*; (Objects with designations containing 1993)\n\nHorizons> 1993*;\n\nHorizons> 1993*\n\nNOTE: The * must be at the end and is NOT a true positional wildcard. It instead toggles searches on sub-strings of characters. For example, 19*3; is not a recognized search.\n\nMatch exact designation:\n\nHorizons> DES= 1990 MU;\n\nHorizons> 1990 MU;\n\nHorizons> 1990 MU\n\nSelect numbered asteroid:\n\nHorizons> 1; (Object in database record #1, â1 Ceresâ)\n\nDefine an arbitrary object not in database\n\nHorizons> ;\n\nComet searches:\n\nHorizons> COMNAM= HER*; (Comet names (only) containing âherâ)\n\nHorizons> DES= 73P; (Request comet 73P apparitions, including fragments, if any)\n\nHorizons> DES= 73P; NOFRAG (Request apparitions of comet 73P, excluding fragments)\n\nHorizons> DES= 73P; CAP (Request comet 73P apparition solution closest to present date, including any fragments)\n\nHorizons> DES= 73P; NOFRAG; CAP (Request comet 73P apparition solution closest to present date, excluding any fragments)\n\nHorizons> COM; NOFRAG; CAP (List the apparition solutions closest to to the present date for all comets, excluding fragments)\n\nHorizons> NAME=Halley;CAP<1690; (Request last Halley apparition prior to the year 1690)\n\nSpacecraft Trajectories in Horizons\n\nHorizons was generally intended to make the natural-body dynamics work of the JPL Solar System Dynamics Group accessible to astronomers and mission planners. However, it is often convenient to make spacecraft trajectory information available through the same mechanism, especially for use by space-based telescopes as observing sites.\n\nSources of the spacecraft trajectory data in Horizons include navigation teams at JPL, flight projects at other NASA centers, ESA, as well as TLE-based orbits from the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). Trajectories provided by navigation teams reflect the full dynamical model, including thruster firings, solar pressure, extended spherical harmonic gravity fields, atmospheric drag, and whatever other dynamic model is used for navigation.\n\nWhile Horizons will always have the latest comet, asteroid, planet, and natural satellite solutions, keeping current with the externally produced spacecraft trajectories is problematic; there is no mandate or funding or staff for this, and maneuvers and mission planning changes can occur without notification, making a trajectory obsolete after some point in time.\n\nSome flight projects do set up a regular delivery schedule to keep Horizons current (some mission science teams use Horizons for planning). More typically, a spacecraft is added if its inclusion is requested by a researcher with a specific need.\n\nA flight project might provide an initial planning trajectory prior to launch and a final historical trajectory after end of mission. This is often sufficient for spacecraft in interplanetary trajectory phases, since the spacecraft are maneuvered to maintain such reference trajectories, which are often designed years in advance.\n\nHowever, spacecraft trajectories can get orphaned in Horizons if updates stop happening. Always check the revision date in the upper left corner of the Horizons spacecraft data-sheet to determine the last time the spacecraftsâ trajectory was updated, and read the data-sheet comments for mission status information.\n\nSpacecraft in low Earth orbit in particular (such as ISS, HST, Swift, GALEX) need frequent updates to maintain high accuracy. Predictions more than a few days into the future can have 10s or 100âs of km of error, especially since maneuvers are not anticipated in the TLE-based predicts. Users can input their own TLEs to define an artificial satellite and propagate its trajectory, as described elswehere in this documentation.\n\nFor interplanetary missions, users having high-precision applications (such as mission data reduction) should contact JPL Solar System Dynamics to verify the status of the specific trajectory in Horizons if there is doubt as to the available trajectorysâ revision status:\n\nJon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov (SSDG analyst)\n\nSome archival mission trajectories are available. These spacecraft trajectories are often expressed relative to older, target-body trajectories such that multi-km offsets can appear if output is instead requested relative to a modern target-body trajectory. This is because the modern solutions are derived from different measurement datasets and dynamical models (planetary ephemerides), introducing inconsistencies.\n\nTo avoid this, Horizons usually includes the original mission-target ephemeris to permit consistent reconstruction with the archived spacecraft trajectory.\n\nFor example, the NEAR spacecraft trajectory during the Eros mapping phase was expressed relative to the asteroid Eros within the dynamical system of the DE200 planetary ephemeris, and has not been updated, while Erosâ trajectory is now expressed in Horizons relative to the Sun in the system of the DE441 planetary ephemeris.\n\nTo obtain the historically accurate position of NEAR with respect to Eros as it was during the mission, select the archived Eros trajectory along with the archived NEAR trajectory. How to do this is explained in the Horizons data-sheet for NEAR, but amounts to specifying the SPK ID of the archived target body instead of integrating it from the database of orbital elements.\n\nFor example, to obtain â¦.\n\nNEAR wrt historical Eros orbit solution (#80):\n\nSpecify target as NEAR with observing center @ 2000433\n\nNEAR wrt current Eros orbit solution: Not available\n\nEros historical orbit solution (#80) wrt to NEAR:\n\nSpecify target as 2000433 with observing center @ NEAR\n\nEros current orbit solution wrt NEAR (offset wrt to historical):\n\nSpecify target as Eros; or 2000433;, observing center @ NEAR\n\nCoordinate Center (Observing Site) Selection\n\nOnce a target is specified, the next step is to specify the origin of the coordinate system, or the âobserving pointâ, relative to which the ephemeris output quantities should be expressed.\n\nWhile osculating element tables may be generated with respect to a major body center only, vector and observer tables may produce output with respect to an arbitrary observing site defined with respect to a major body center.\n\nEarth Sites\n\nFor the Earth, a list with the locations of 2300+ sites is predefined. The list generally matches that of the Minor Planet Center while providing an expanded list of radar/radio sites (which have negative ID numbers). Station 500 is the geocenter.\n\nNon-Earth Sites\n\nFor non-Earth major bodies, station 500 also represents the body center. For those major bodies with IAU rotational models, additional topocentric sites may be defined. Spacecraft landing sites are typically predefined on non-Earth bodies.\n\nSpecifying a Predefined Observing Site\n\nThere are several equivalent ways of specifying an observing location. The most general form that always works is â¦\n\nsite @ body\n\nâ¦ where âsiteâ is a numeric code or name fragment of an observatory to match, and âbodyâ is a numeric major body code or name fragment to match.\n\nA list of such major body codes follows later in this document, or type MB at the main Horizons prompt in the command-line interface, or send âCOMMAND= MBâ via API or e-mail interfaces. For the web interface, see https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/time_spans.html\n\nHere are four equivalent ways of searching for and specifying the same Earth site location:\n\nCode Meaning ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------- 675@399 Site #675 on Earth (Palomar Mountain) palomar@399 \" 675@ \" Palomar \" (observer table only)\n\nObserver & Vector Tables\n\nIf an observer or vector table has been requested, the @ symbol may be dropped; the Earth will be assumed if only an integer like 675 or a name fragment like Palom is input.\n\nHowever, if you are trying to specify an observing site not on Earth, you MUST use the @ symbol for correct interpretation. For example, if an observer table as seen from the Sun is desired, it must be specified as @10 or @sun. Specifying 10 only will select the Caussols site.\n\nElement Tables\n\nFor an osculating element table, the different assumption (for abbreviated input of specified center) is made that a coordinate center request lacking a @ symbol is a major body. For example, 10 would mean the Caussols site for an observer or vector table, but Sun for a vector table. 10@ or 10@399 would mean the Caussols site for both table types.\n\nThe different assumptions are meant to be efficient for the particular types of output requested, expediting âtypicalâ usage, especially in the command-line interface. However, the full form site @ body can always be used to avoid having to remember âquirksâ.\n\nIf your specification returns more than one possible match, the list of matched sites is returned. Refine your site request to be more specific, by using the unique numeric codes listed for example, and try again.\n\nWhile one can spell out the names of the bodies and sites, it is possible unique matches wonât be returned. Thus, use the unique ID numbers when known.\n\nFor example, 675 @ Earth will first look for the body, match both the Earth & Earth-Moon barycenter, thus have to quit before finding specific Palomar site coordinates. 675 @ 399 is unique and avoids this problem. Spaces & upper/lower case are ignored.\n\nHere are examples for sites on bodies other than the Earth:\n\nCode Meaning ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------- Viking@499 List all defined Viking lander sites on Mars Viking-1@499 Select Viking-1 landing site on Mars 1 @301 Site #1 on the Moon 500 @ 501 Io body center 3 @ 499 Site #3 on Mars\n\nThe asterisk (â*â) can be used to generate lists:\n\nCode Meaning ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------- *@301 List all predefined sites on the Moon *@Phobos List all predefined sites on the Martian moon Phobos *@399 List all predefined sites on Earth *@ List all predefined sites on Earth (observer/vector table) * List all predefined sites on Earth (observer/vector table) * List all major bodies (element table only)\n\nThere are a several ways to request a body-centered site for a major body.\n\nCode Meaning ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------- 500@601 Mimas body center geo@601 \" g@601 \" g@Mimas \" 500@Deimos Deimos body center geo Earth Geocenter g@399 Earth Geocenter\n\nUser-Defined Topocentric Site Coordinates\n\nMany small or recently discovered natural satellites do not have defined rotation models, thus do not support topocentric site definition. Only body-centered observers can be defined.\n\nHowever, for sites with rotation models, topocentric sites may be input by the user as follows (command-line interface only; API, web, and e-mail specify with query settings or filling in boxes):\n\nCode Meaning ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------- c @ Europa Request prompting for user location on satellite Europa coord @ 502 (same thing)\n\nAfter coordinate input is requested, the site location may be entered as either geodetic or cylindrical coordinate triplets, separated by commas:\n\nGEODETIC (generally this means map coordinates) E-long - Geodetic east longitude (DEGREES) lat - Geodetic latitude (DEGREES) h - Altitude above reference ellipsoid (km) CYLINDRICAL E-long - Angle eastward from XZ plane (DEGREES) DXY - Distance from Z axis (KM) DZ - Height above XY equator plane (KM)\n\nFor Earth, observing site coordinates should be specified relative to the ITRF93 (or WGS-84 GPS) reference ellipsoid. The two systems differ by about 0.1 meters, but are currently treated as interchangeable in Horizons.\n\nAltitude specifications should be with respect to the reference ellipsoid, not âmean sea levelâ. There can be more than 100 meters of difference between MSL and ellipsoid altitudes of a site. Separate on-line tools can help convert from MSL to ellipsoid altitude:\n\nhttps://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/cgi-bin/GeoidEval\n\nFor other bodies, Horizons uses planetodetic/geodetic IAU coordinates (or mean Earth of DE421 for the Moon). This is typically the one used on maps, such as those by the USGS, unless the map says otherwise. In these coordinates, the rotational pole of the body that lies on the positive (north) side of the invariable plane of the solar system (the plane perpendicular to the solar systemsâ angular momentum vector) is called the ânorth poleâ.\n\nNorthern latitudes are positive, southern are negative. The planetodetic latitude takes into account body oblateness and, for a point on the surface, is the angle between the body equatorial plane and the normal to the reference surface at that point. For a point not on the reference surface, the geodetic latitude is the latitude of the point on the reference surface where the normal passes through the point at some altitude (h) above the reference surface.\n\nPrograde (or direct) rotation of a body is rotation eastward, or counter- clockwise, as seen from the north pole. For such bodies (with the exception of the Earth, Moon, and Sun discussed next), positive longitude values are taken to mean west and so the equivalent longitude eastward is specified negatively from the prime meridian (i.e., west-longitude - 360). For example, if you have a site on Mars at 12 degrees west, and Horizons asks you to enter the eastward longitude, enter -348 degrees. The negative sign is used in place of an âEâ symbol to ensure proper input.\n\nExceptions are the Earth, Moon and Sun, where longitude has historically been measured both east and west of the prime meridian. Though these bodies are direct rotators, positive longitude values are assumed to be eastward in this system due to historical precedence.\n\nIf starting with the positive west-longitude of an observing site on Earth, Moon, or Sun, it should be input here as an equivalent positive east-longitude, which would be (360 - given west-longitude). For example, if a site is at 23 degrees west on Earth, and Horizons asks you to specify the east-longitude (as it will), enter 337 degrees.\n\nIf a negative âeast-longitudeâ value (âmeaning westwardâ) is instead available for a location on these three bodies, one can input the negative value. However, it will be converted to a positive east-longitude on output, as (360 + value). For example, if Horizons asks for the east-longitude of an observing site on Earth and a â-5â is entered, it will be taken to mean the equivalent 355 degrees east-longitude.\n\nRetrograde rotation is rotation westward, or clockwise as seen from the north pole. Positive numeric longitudes for these bodies are taken to mean âeastward from the prime meridianâ in Horizons. If you are given a west-longitude for a site on a retrograde rotator, specify its equivalent longitude eastward to Horizons as (360 - west longitude). For example, if given a site on Venus at 78 degrees west, specify the eastward longitude to Horizons as 282 degrees.\n\nThe following major bodies are either retrograde or exceptions and require site input with positive east-longitude:\n\nRetrograde (+ east-longitude): ------------------------------ Venus (299), Arial (701), Umbriel (702), Titania (703), Oberon (704), Miranda (705), Cordelia (706), Ophelia (707), Bianca (708), Cressida (709), Desdemona (710), Juliet (711), Portia (712), Rosalind (713), Belinda (714), Puck (715), Uranus (799), Triton (801) Also + east-longitude (prograde exceptions): -------------------------------------------- Sun (10), Earth (399), Moon (301)\n\nThe other major bodies are prograde rotators and must be input with negative longitudes, indicating eastward relative to the prime meridian. Since such sites are usually expressed in terms of positive west-longitude on maps, the equivalent east-negative value would be (west-longitude - 360), as described above.\n\nTo verify proper interpretation, check the ephemeris output header which reports the user-input site coordinates used in the bodyâs native system.\n\nInterpreting non-Earth Observer Tables\n\nWhen selecting a site on a body other than the Earth, some definitions and quantities slightly shift in meaning:\n\nVisually interfering body\n\nThe largest other body in the system. Such a body may visually complicate observations at the site due to its brightness or by covering up the target. On the Earth, the âinterfering bodyâ is the Moon. On Io, it would be Jupiter. On Mars, it would be Phobos (largest body, though unlikely to genuinely interfere). Mercury and Venus have no interfering bodies.\n\nObserver tables provide some optional quantities that can be used to characterize the effect of the interfering body (or IB): how far is the target from the IB in the plane-of-sky, is it obscured by the IB, what fraction of the IB is lit by the Sun as seen from the observing site, and so on.\n\nFor observation points located on Earth, the estimated visual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target relative to atmosphere-scattered moonlight is available as an optional output.\n\nDeflecting body\n\nCurrently, only the Sunâs mass is used to compute the relativistic deflection of light that can change the apparent position of the target body.\n\nOther changes\n\nREFRACTION\n\nNo refraction effects are modeled for non-Earth sites. Any request for refraction is ignored and the refraction angle will be zero. This applies to rise-set determinations on non-Earth bodies as well.\n\nAIRMASS\n\nThere is no airmass model or airmass cut-off available for non-Earth sites. Any request for airmass computation is ignored, and output as ân.a.â (not available).\n\nAPPARENT RA & DEC\n\nThe origin of right-ascension for apparent coordinates on NON-EARTH sites with rotational models is the meridian containing the ICRF +x-axis. Apparent declination is with respect to the particular bodyâs true equator-of-date. This allows an observer to align axes with the pole and use the angle output as âlocal apparent sidereal timeâ output by this system to set the RA origin and acquire the target.\n\nFor objects lacking a pole & prime meridian rotational model (spacecraft and certain asteroids that may have been redefined as âmajor bodiesâ), the inertial reference frame (ICRF or FK4/B1950) coordinate system is used to compute apparent places.\n\nTIME\n\nTime tags refer to the time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth regardless of observer location within the solar system, although clock rates may differ due to the local gravity field and no analogous time-scales are locally defined.\n\nLimitations of non-Earth/Moon Rotation Models\n\nFor bodies other than the Earth and Moon, precession and nutation effects are not usually known to high accuracy. The IAU rotation and cartographic models used to determine surface sites may be accurate at only the ~0.1 degree or greater level in the present era for such cases.\n\nFor the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, IAU longitude is based on the âSet IIIâ prime meridian rotation angle of the magnetic field. By contrast, pole direction (thus latitude) is relative to the body dynamical equator. There can be an offset between the magnetic pole and the dynamical pole of rotation.\n\nFor many satellites, the official pole direction adopted for the IAU model was simply assumed perpendicular to the bodyâs mean orbit plane, lacking better information. For many satellites in the IAU model, the rotation rate was assumed equal to the mean orbital period.\n\nSome small satellite rotational models are strictly valid only at the time of the Voyager spacecraft flyby; extrapolation to other times is problematic. Topocentric results for such bodies (610-614, for example) should be used cautiously if at all. Results in these cases reflect only the best available model, which is known to be deficient.\n\nAs rotation models are refined through observation of surface features by visiting spacecraft (Cassini, etc.), Horizons will be updated to use the best generally sanctioned models available.\n\nOther Commands\n\nProgram information:\n\nMB ..............

For example, if your last table prior to saving the macro was a âvectorâ table, that table type will be saved as the default.\n\nSettings for the other table types are saved as well so, to access them, manually respond to the prompt requesting table type, over-riding the macrosâ âvectorâ default on that issue. Start and stop times are also macro settings that may commonly be overruled as necessary.\n\nIdeally, macro names would be something memorable:\n\nâOBS670-1â for macro #1 for Observatory Code 670, etc.\n\nâ¦ but the name is up to you.\n\nThe use of macros may make it less likely to stumble upon new capabilities as they are added, though they will described here and in the system news, as appropriate.\n\nIntegrator Display (command-line interface only)\n\nComet and asteroid ephemerides are integrated from initial conditions called âosculating elementsâ. These describe the 3-dimensional position and velocity of the body at a specific time. The integrator starts with this state and takes small time steps, summing the perturbing forces at each step and assessing error before taking another step. A variable order, variable step-size integrator is used to control error growth. In this way, the gravitational attraction of other major solar system bodies on the target body trajectory is taken into account.\n\nThe integrator starts at the epoch, or time, of the osculating elements. It then integrates forward or backward, as necessary, to the start of the requested table. Once it reaches the table start time, it may have to reverse direction and go forward in time to generate the table.\n\nEvery 50th step will be displayed so the user can get some sense of the progress of the ephemeris. Direction reversals are also displayed. If output is requested at small time intervals, the integrator may proceed rapidly to the start of the table. There may then be long (apparent) pauses, as numerous interpolations within a given integration step are performed to compute states at closely spaced print times.\n\nThe last number on the integrator display line is the most recent step size in days.\n\nSpecification of Time\n\nAccepted Formats\n\nTime may be specified many ways in addition to the primary form YYYY-MMM-DD HH:MM:SS.fff. Of particular note are Julian Day Number and day-of-yearforms. Examples are shown below. Input start times may be specified to 1/1000th of a second if the default output setting is changed from âminutesâ.\n\nGenerally, if the input start time has more digits of precision specified than the selected output format, start time will be truncated to the appropriate level. For example, if a start time of 23:45:12.4 is specified, but the output format is only set to minutes, start time will automatically be changed to 23:45(:00.000).\n\nYOUR INPUT PROGRAM INTERPRETATION ------------------------ --------------------------- Recommended: 2027-May-5 12:30:23.3348 ( 2027-May-5 12:30:23.334 ) Acceptable: Calendar formats: 1965-Jan-27.47083333 ( 1965-Jan-27 11:18:00.000 ) 2028-05-04 18:00 ( 2028-May-04 18:00.00.000 ) 04-05-2028 18:00 ( 2028-May-04 18:00.00.000 ) 2 jan 1991 3:00:12.2 ( 1991-Jan-02 03:00:12.200 ) 2017 MAR 10 12:00:00 ( 2017-Mar-10 12:00:00.000 ) 29 February 1976 3:00 ( 1976-Feb-29 03:00:00.000 ) 278bc-jan-12 12:34 ( B.C. 278-Jan-12 12:34:00.000 ) 99ad-Aug-30 12:34 ( A.D. 99-Aug-30 12:34:00.000 ) bc 2417-Jul-22 12:34 ( B.C. 2417-Jul-22 12:34:00.000 ) Julian Day Number: JD 2451545.

For API or browser interfaces, see https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/time_spans.html\n\nFor observer tables, output may be in either UT or TT timescale. For vector tables, any of three scales may be used (TDB, TT, UT). For osculating element tables, only the TDB timescale may be used.\n\nTo change the UT default for observer tables, append a âTTâ when entering START time. To switch back, append a âUTâ to the start time.\n\nThe three time systems are described as follows:\n\nTDB (âBarycentric Dynamical Timeâ); typically for cartesian, osculating element, and close-approach tables. A uniform relativistic timescale and independent variable of the planetary ephemeris dynamical equations of motion.\n\nTT (âTerrestrial Timeâ), called TDT prior to 1991, used for observer quantity tables. This is proper time as measured by an Earth-bound observer and is directly related to atomic time, TAI. TT periodically differs from TDB by, at most, 0.002 seconds.\n\nUT is Universal Time. This can mean one of two non-uniform time-scales based on the rotation of the Earth. For this program, prior to 1962, UT means UT1. After 1962, UT means UTC or âCoordinated Universal Timeâ. Future UTC leap-seconds are not known yet, so the closest known leap-second correction is used over future time-spans.\n\nTime Zone Corrections\n\nOutput time-tags may also be in local civil time. When specifying start time, enter your time-zone correction in the format:\n\nYYYY-Mon-Dy HH:MM UT{s}HH{:MM}\n\nâ¦ where\n\n{s} ... optional sign (+ or -). If unspecified, it is assumed \"+\". HH ... integer hours time-zone difference from UT {:MM} ... optional minutes offset (usually 0)\n\nNorth American standard time (winter) zone corrections are as follows:\n\nAtlantic Standard Time (AST) = UT-4 hours\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) = UT-5 hours\n\nCentral Standard Time (CST) = UT-6 hours\n\nMountain Standard Time (MST) = UT-7 hours\n\nPacific Standard Time (PST) = UT-8 hours\n\nIf daylight savings is in effect (summer), add one hour to the above negative offsets.\n\nFor example, 1999-Jun-2 12:30 UT-8 produces a table in Pacific Standard Time. A -7 would provide Pacific Daylight Time (or MST, if it is winter).\n\nCalendar dates input by users and output by the program can be set to either use the modern Gregorian calendar only, or a mixed calendar that automatically switches between the historical Julian and modern Gregorian calendars.\n\nThe Julian calendar was adopted on January 1, 45 BC. It was widely used until Oct 5, 1582, when the new Gregorian calendar began with Oct 15, 1582. The ten skipped calendar day labels restored correspondence with Earth seasons that had gradually drifted due to accumulated error in the Julian calendar.\n\nSince the modern Gregorian calendar more accurately corresponds to physical Earth seasons and orbital motion, it is an appropriate calendar to use when analyzing such dynamical events as solstices and equinoxes.\n\nHowever, historical events prior to 1582 are most likely recorded with the Julian calendar in use at that time.\n\nIf the mixed calendar mode option is active, input calendar dates 1582-Oct-15 and after are assumed to be in the Gregorian calendar system. Prior dates are assumed to be in the Julian calendar (which for earlier ancient dates is extended even prior to its 45 BC adoption).\n\nHistorically, not all regions switched between Julian and Gregorian calendars in 1582, or even in the same century. Thus, the user must be aware of which calendar was in effect for a particular historical record. It should NOT be assumed this systemsâ calendar automatically correlates with a date from an arbitrary historical document.\n\nHere is the progression near the Julian/Gregorian calendar switch point in mixed mode:\n\nInput Julian Calendar Type Calendar Date Julian Day Number Interpreted as ------------- ------------- ----------------- -------------- Julian 1582-Oct-03 2299158.5 Julian 1582-Oct-04 2299159.5 --> 1582-Oct-04 (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-05\" 2299160.5 | (1582-Oct-15) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-06\" 2299151.5 | (1582-Sep-26) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-07\" 2299152.5 | (1582-Sep-27) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-08\" 2299153.5 | (1582-Sep-28) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-09\" 2299154.5 | (1582-Sep-29) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-10\" 2299155.5 | (1582-Sep-30) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-11\" 2299156.5 | (1582-Oct-01) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-12\" 2299157.5 | (1582-Oct-02) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-13\" 2299158.5 | (1582-Oct-03) (J) (skipped) \"1582-Oct-14\" 2299159.5 | (1582-Oct-04) (J) Gregorian 1582-Oct-15 2299160.5 <-- 1582-Oct-15 (G) Gregorian 1582-Oct-16 2299161.5 Gregorian 1582-Oct-17 2299162.5\n\nNote that âJulian datesâ refer to the Julian calendar. By contrast, âJulian Day Numbersâ are a different concept, a uniform counting of days that is calendar-independent aside from the count beginning at Noon mean solar time on January 1st, 4713 B.C. in the proleptic Julian calendar.\n\nExamination of the above table shows that the date labels from Oct 5, 1582 through Oct 14, 1582 donât exist when transitioning between calendars. Of course, the days themselves do, as is shown in the continuous Julian Day Number column; it is just a matter of what they are labeled.\n\nIf you specify a non-existent calendarlabel that was âskippedâ, this program will automatically use a day number that maps into the previous Julian calendar system, as shown above in the right-hand column. For example, requesting a date of 1582-Oct-14 (skipped) is the same as requesting the Julian calendar date 1582-Oct-04.\n\nObjects 0-10, 199, 299, 301, and 399 (planet barycenters, their equivalents and the Sun & Moon) are available over a 9999 B.C. to A.D. 9999 interval. When specifying ancient calendar dates, this system requires input in the âBC/ADâ system. If no BC marker is input with a calendar date, it is assumed to be AD. Exceptions are AD years less than 100 which must have an AD symbol in the date in order to be recognized as a valid year. For example, 66ad-jan-27 will be accepted, but 66-Jan-27 cannot be parsed.\n\nIn this system, there are no negative years. The progression is as follows:\n\nJulian Day Number Labeling-convention (Jan 1 00:00) BC/AD Arithmetical ----------------- ----- ------------ 1720327.5 3bc -2 1720692.5 2bc -1 1721057.5 1bc 0 1721423.5 1ad 1 1721788.5 2ad 2\n\nFrom this, one can see that no days (in the arithmetical year â0â, for example) are skipped in the BC/AD scheme, but they do have a different label than in the corresponding arithmetical system.\n\nOutput observer-table lines begin with a âbâ in column 1, to indicate B.C. dates, and a space (â â) to indicate A.D. dates.\n\nOutput Stepping\n\nThere are three different ways of specifying when observer-table output should be generated\n\n1. Fixed time steps\n\nOutput time steps are specified as integers with some associated units from the set {days, hours, minutes}. Example responses to the prompt include â30 daysâ, â1 dayâ, â10 minâ, and so on. To get half day steps, specify â12 hourâ.\n\nIt is possible to obtain output at less than 1 minute intervals. After specifying a start and stop time, give a positive integer as the âtime-stepâ, without giving units, such as â10â. This will divide the time span into 10 parts. For example, if start and stop times are one hour (3600 seconds) apart, specifying a step of â240â will produce output every 15 seconds (3600/15 = 240 intervals). â3600â will produce output every second.\n\nRise/set and satellite eclipse circumstances may not be accurate to less than a minute since factors such as the primarysâ oblateness and atmosphere are not currently modelled.\n\n2. Calendar steps:\n\nIf a step-size in units of âyearsâ or âmonthsâ is specified, output steps will follow the calendar based on the starting date.\n\nFor example, if the start is 2008-Feb-29, and output is requested at â1 yearâ steps, output will be returned only for Feb 29 calendar days in those leap years having 29 days in Februrary.\n\nIf output is requested at â1 monthâ intervals, output will occur for every successive month on the 29th of that month. If a start date on the 31st is requested, output will only occur for months having 31 days.\n\n3. Time-varying angular-shift steps:\n\nOutput is typically at fixed time intervals. However, observer tables may additionally be requested at time-varying steps based on an angular shift specification. That is, âoutput only if the object has moved at least X arcseconds in the plane-of-skyâ.\n\nWhen specifying step-size, with the command-line or e-mail interfaces, respond with something like VAR ####, where #### is an integer from 60 to 3600 arcseconds. This will trigger output whenever the objectsâ position is predicted to be #### arcseconds different from the current output step in the observersâ plane-of-sky.\n\nTo preserve system performance, the time-varying output mode uses a simple linear extrapolation to predict the time when the object should have moved the requested distance. Due to non-linearities in the objectsâ actual motion in the plane-of-sky, this projection can be off by .1 to 5 (or more) arcsecs. Thus the angular-motion print criteria you give should be considered approximate.\n\nComputed quantities will be exact for the given time in the output, but the particular output time may not be exactly that required for the requested angular change.\n\nReference Frames\n\nReference frames are used to describe the position and velocity of an object in three-dimensional space. Horizons uses several references frames, depending on the purpose and user-specification.\n\nInternational Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)\n\nThe primary reference frame is the ICRF. It is based on thousands of remote extragalactic radio sources (mostly quasars) to specify three fixed reference directions: the ICRF pole direction (+Z) and right ascension origin (+X), along with the orthogonal +Y direction.\n\nThe ICRF was constructed to closely align with the older FK5/J2000 dynamic reference frame â within the uncertainties of that system â while replacing dynamical definitions based on intersecting and moving planes with ones based on the more precisely determined and fixed radio source positions. The ICRF has no associated standard epoch and, while it was aligned closely with the original FK5/J2000 equatorial system, is not itself equatorial, just ICRF.\n\nThe JPL planetary ephemeris solution (currently DE440/441) is closely aligned with the ICRF-3 realization, and is thought to differ by at most 0.0002 arcseconds, while the ICRF is thought to differ from the previous FK5/J2000 dynamical system by at most 0.02 arcseconds.\n\nAll underlying calculations in Horizons are done in the reference frame of the planetary ephemeris (DE440/441), taken to be indistinguishable from the ICRF using currently available measurements. They are then transformed to other frames if necessary for final output.\n\nOther reference frames developed relative to the ICRF in Horizons include:\n\nThis moving reference frame is defined by the Earthâs âtrueâ pole at any instant, which defines the +z-axis, and moves due to luni-solar precession and nutation. The slowly changing intersection of the equator plane and orbit plane at any instant defines an x-axis direction called the âequinox of-dateâ.\n\nHorizons currently uses the IAU76/80 precession-nutation theory, corrected daily by GPS measurements over the modern era, to transform from ICRF to the âtrue-of-dateâ reference frame. Due to different adopted ecliptics, the origin of RA (x-axis) in this intermediate reference frame differs by about -53 mas from the IAU2006/00A of-date system.\n\nInternational Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF93)\n\nThis is the Earth body-frame to which Earth station coordinates are referred, and is produced from the Earth TOD frame with additional small GPS-derived polar motion corrections.\n\nLunar Mean-Earth Frame of DE421\n\nLike the lower precision IAU lunar model, the mean Earth/polar axis model uses a +Z axis aligned with the north mean lunar rotation axis, while the prime meridian contains the mean Earth direction. This system is also sometimes called the âmean Earth/mean rotation axisâ system or just âmean Earthâ system, and is a rotation by a fixed offet from the DE440 principal axis (or PA) system sometimes also used in lunar studies to the standard DE421 mean Earth frame. The lunar PA frame is not currently available in Horizons.\n\nThe high precision lunar rotational-pole model is available only over the timespan A.D. 1550 - 2650. Outside that span, Horizons will automatically transition to use the low-precision IAU model. The models used are given in the output header.\n\nFor example, output involving the lunar cartographic model over 1500-2700 would contain the following summary line in the header:\n\nTarget pole/equ : IAU_MOON, MOON_ME, IAU_MOON {East-longitude positive}\n\nâ¦ indicating output begins with the IAU_MOON model, transitions to MOON_ME at 1550, then switches back to IAU_MOON after 2650.\n\nIf the output is entirely within the 1550-2650 interval of the high-precision model (typical usage), the label would instead be:\n\nTarget pole/equ : MOON_ME {East-longitude positive}\n\nRotational models for the planets, natural satellites, and some asteroids are periodically published by the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements. These specify body spin-pole direction in ICRF coordinates. Body rotation is specified relative to the intersection (node) of the bodyâs equator plane with the fixed ICRF fundamental plane, which defines the x-axis for the reference frame.\n\nThis is analagous to (but different from) the equinox direction used for Earth, whose of-date +x-axis is defined by intersection of an orbit and equator.\n\nSince some bodies have poles with fixed spin directions in the IAU system, âof-dateâ body coordinates may actually refer to a fixed node direction. Other bodies have moving poles such that the node reference direction can shift over time.\n\nEcliptic of Standard Epoch (J2000 or B1950)\n\nThis fixed reference frame was nominally based on an adopted model of the Earthâs mean heliocentric orbit plane, but is now produced by rotating around the ICRF x-axis by a standard fixed obliquity angle (epsilon) of 84381.448 arcseconds.\n\nAsteroid and comet orbit solutions at JPL and elsewhere continue to store and transfer solutions using this IAU76/86 standard ecliptic plane at the J2000 epoch.\n\nThe ecliptic concept, being based on adopted definitions of a âmean orbit planeâ, is ambiguous at high-precision levels due to the mutual motion of the Earth and Moon. Consistent usage is most important. If doing physics such as orbit propagations at high precision levels in a different ecliptic (not recommended), use the given epsilon to transform back to ICRF, then into the desired ecliptic frame.\n\nGiven FK4/B1950 ecliptic output from Horizons, an obliquity epsilon of 84404.8362512 arc-seconds should be used to recover the original FK4/B1950 coordinates.\n\nFK4/B1950\n\nThis older dynamical reference frame option is based on the Earth mean-equator and FK4 optical catalog equinox of the epoch B1950.0, the Julian Day Number at the start of the Besselian year B1950.0 (2433282.42345905). The Fricke equinox correction at epoch is applied. It can be described as:\n\nxy-plane: plane of the Earthâs mean equator at the reference epoch (B1950.0)\n\nx-axis : out along ascending node of the instantaneous plane of the Earthâs orbit and the Earthâs mean equator at the reference epoch\n\nz-axis : along the Earth mean north pole at the reference epoch\n\nUsed for some observer table quantities, this dynamic frame uses the IAU76/80 time-varying Earth obliquity model to construct the ecliptic x-y plane of-date over modern eras and the long-term IAU76/80-compatible model of Owen, a long-term integration of Kinoshitaâs polar equations of motion, for times more than 200 years from the year 2000.\n\nSearching for Small-Bodies\n\nSearch for small-bodies with following keywords (Type R=real, I=integer, C=char). Use comparisons from the set { <, >, <>, = }. Separate each field with a semi-colon. Example search formulation:\n\nA < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0;\n\nThe first group of keywords are common to asteroids AND comets:\n\nType Keyword Description ---- ------- ----------- C NAME ......

If one or more is used, the search will conclude faster by examining asteroids only. For example, including something like H > -10; will limit the search to asteroids only:\n\nC ASTNAM .... Asteroid name fragment (designation if unnamed) R B-V ....... B-V color (asteroid) R H ......... Absolute magnitude parameter (asteroid) R G ......... Magnitude slope parameter; can be < 0 (asteroid) R ROTPER .... Rotational period, hrs (asteroid) R ALBEDO .... Geometric albedo (asteroid) C STYP ...... Spectral type, Tholen scheme (asteroid)\n\nThe next parameters are COMET SPECIFIC. If one or more is used, the search will conclude faster by examining comets only. For example, including something like M1 > -10; will limit the search to comets only:\n\nC COMNAM .... Comet name fragment (designation if unnamed) I COMNUM .... Comet number R M1 ........ Total absolute magnitude (comet) R M2 ........ Nuclear absolute magnitude (comet) R K1 ........ Total magnitude scaling factor (comet) R K2 ........

Non-grav lag/delay parameter (comet), days\n\nOnly 1 of the 4 keywords ASTNAM, COMNAM, NAME or DES can be specified on a given search.\n\nDirectives\n\nThere are 5 special directives that may be used to limit or control searches:\n\nDirective Description --------- ----------- COM ..... Limit search to comets only AST ..... Limit search to asteroids only LIST .... Display parameter values for matched objects. (This may be set as a default for all subsequent searches by typing \"LIST\" at the main system prompt, \"Horizons>\".) For example, \"A < 2.5; IN > 10; AST;\" (match parameters against asteroids ONLY) \"A < 2.5; IN > 10; AST; LIST;\" (match AND display values of the parameters) NOFRAG .. Exclude/skip comet fragments CAP ..... A filter that guarantees only one comet apparition will be returned for each comet. It may be used three ways: CAP; (returns last apparition before the current date) CAP < JD#; (returns last apparition before the specified Julian Day Number) CAP < YEAR; (returns last apparition before the given integer year) If the number after a '<' is less than 10000, it is assumed to be a year integer. Otherwise, the number is taken to be a Julian Day Number. If \"CAP;\" is specified, the search is automatically recognized as being a comets-only search.\n\nExcluded from the database are single opposition asteroids with observational data arcs less than 30 days, unless they are NEOs, PHAs or radar targets (which ARE included). Everything else is in.\n\nExcept for âPHAsâ and NEOs, which are usually included within a couple hours of announcement, there can be a delay of a few days to a couple weeks before newly discovered objects (that meet the filter criteria) are added. Users can input their own objects, as described in the next section. The database is updated hourly with new objects and orbit solutions.\n\nUser-Specified Small-Bodies\n\nIt is possible to define an object not in the database by manual input of HELIOCENTRIC IAU76/J2000 ECLIPTIC elements and some other optional parameters. One could also display a database entry Horizons, then âcut-and-pasteâ elements back into the program, varying parameters (such as magnitude), as needed. Cut-and-paste is a function of your local terminal capability.\n\nFrom the command-line interface, type â;â at the main prompt.\n\nEnter the required data as described below. Press return on a blank line when done. Input format is:\n\nLABEL= VALUE LABEL= VALUE ... LABEL= VALUE ... . .\n\nâ¦ where acceptable label strings are defined as follows:\n\nEPOCH .. Julian Day Number of osculating elements (TDB timescale, JDTDB) EC ..... Eccentricity QR ..... Perihelion distance (au) TP ..... Perihelion Julian Day Number OM ..... Longitude of ascending node (DEGREES) wrt IAU76/80 ecliptic W ...... Argument of perihelion (DEGREES) with respect to IAU76/80 ecliptic IN ..... Inclination (DEGREES) with respect to IAU76/80 ecliptic\n\nInstead of {TP, QR}, {MA, A} or {MA,N} may be specified (not both):\n\nMA ..... Mean anomaly (DEGREES) A ...... Semi-major axis (au) N ...... Mean motion (DEG/DAY)\n\nNote that if you specify elements with MA, {TP, QR} will be computed from them. The program always uses TP and QR internally.\n\nOptional Inputs\n\nRAD ...... Object radius (KM) AMRAT .... Area-to-mass ratio (m^2/kg). Setting to a non-zero value activates calculation of solar radiation pressure acceleration. Total absorption is assumed, so scale the value to account for reflectivity. For example, if 15% of light is reflected, specify a value for AMRAT for which the actual value is multiplied by 1.15.\n\nFor asteroids, additional OPTIONAL parameters can be given:\n\nH ........

Non-grav. model constant, normalizing factor [0.1112620426] NM ........ Non-grav. model constant, exponent m [2.15] NN ........ Non-grav. model constant, exponent n [5.093] NK ........ Non-grav. model constant, exponent k [4.6142] DT ........ Non-grav lag/delay parameter (comets only), days AMRAT ..... Solar pressure model, area/mass ratio, m^2/kg\n\nIf {R0, ALN, NM, NN, NK} are not specified, but the non-gravitational model is activated with a non-zero A1, A2, or A3, the default values shown are assumed, as described in âCometary Orbit Determination and Nongravitational Forcesâ, in Comets II, University of Arizona Press (2004), pp. 137-151. They specify a semi-empirical water-ice sublimation dynamical model appropriate for the COMETARY A1, A2, and A3 data-fit solutions at JPL.\n\nIf ALN= 1.0, NK= 0.0, NM= 2.0, NN= 5.093, R0= 1.0 are specified instead, the A1-A3 scaling terms from the orbit solution indicate a non-gravitational acceleration that goes as 1 au/r^2, where r is heliocentric distance. This simple inverse square model is useful for modeling ASTEROID solar radiation pressure (in the A1 radial component) and/or approximating thermal re-radiation (Yarkovsky) and other cumulative accelerations in the transverse A2 component.\n\nFor the AMRAT solar pressure model, total absorption is assumed. Scale the value to account for reflectivity. For example, if 15% of light is reflected, specify a value for AMRAT for which the actual value is multiplied by 1.15.\n\nYou may enter each value on a separate line or several on one line. If you make a mistake, re-entering the label on another line will over-write the previously specified value. To erase a value, enter something like H=, where no value is given. To cancel all input, enter - as the first character on a line. To log-out, enter a q or x as first character on a line.\n\nWhen done, after having pressed return on a blank line, you will be asked whether the reference frame of the elements is J2000/ICRF or FK4/B1950.0. You will also be asked to supply a name for the object.\n\nExample input:\n\nEPOCH= 2450200.5 EC= .8241907231263196 QR= .532013766859137 TP= 2450077.480966184235 OM= 89.14262290335057 W = 326.0591239257098 IN= 4.247821264821585 A1= -5.113711376907895D-10 A2= -6.288085687976327D-10\n\nUser-Specified Two-Line Elements (TLEs)\n\nGeocentric SGP4/SDP4 Two-Line Element (TLE) format data can be specified by users to define an Earth-orbiting artificial satellite. Such data is primarily available from Space-Track.org and CelesTrak.com.\n\nHorizons maintains trajectories for only a small subset of Earth-orbiting satellites, so this user-input option allows specification of other objects not in Horizons. These add-ins can then be used as targets (to observe) and coordinate origins (observing sites from which to observe).\n\nThe standard TLE format can be cut-and-pasted into Horizons here. For example:\n\nSC-1 1 87820U 11053A 11273.79990913 .00099611 00000-0 64461-3 0 9991 2 87820 042.7843 189.7738 0014383 039.8647 002.5266 15.74868665 196 1 87820U 11053A 11273.86983630 -.00085102 +00000-0 -55758-3 0 9998 2 87820 042.7804 189.3478 0014258 040.7498 038.5752 15.74826749000204\n\nPress return on a blank line when done.\n\nType â-â alone on a line to abandon TLE input (discard)\n\nThe first line can be the objectsâ name (âSC-1â), as can every 3rd line. Names are a maximum of 24 characters in length.\n\nName is optional, but if no name is provided, you will be prompted for an optional name after TLE data input is complete.\n\nMultiple TLE sets can be input, up to some system limit which may change but is nominally 600 sets (1200 data lines â¦ name lines are not counted)\n\nInput TLEs can be extrapolated over a limited time-span before and after the first and last TLE epochs. This limit may change, but is nominally +/- 14 days. Extrapolation errors outside the TLE epoch bounds grow at perhaps 1-3 km per day, but this is highly variable and could be much worse if there is thruster activity. If there are large gaps in the data, ephemeris results could be heavily degraded (i.e., worthless â¦ passing through the Earth, etc.).\n\nThe data does not have to be in chronological order, though that would be a normal thing to do.\n\nOnce a TLE object has been defined, you can go off and do other things in Horizons (when using it interactively via telnet), then come back later and select the previously input dataset as a target by typing âTLEâ at the main Horizons prompt.\n\nAn input TLE object can be also used as a coordinate origin (an observing point) at any time, as explained below.\n\nLocal TLE ID Number:\n\nInternally, the TLE ID (columns 3-7, so 87820 in the example above) is prefixed with a -8 such that the temporary Horizons ID would be -887820.\n\nThis internal ID is displayed on the output, and can be used if you need to specify an observing point with respect to a user-input artifical satellite.\n\nUser-Defined TLE Objects as Observatories\n\nOnce defined, a TLE object can be used in the same way as other objects available from this system.\n\nTo generate an ephemeris of the Moon with respect to the TLE object, one would input TLEs such as those above, then select the Moon as a target, then specify a coordinate origin of @ -887820.\n\nThe output lunar ephemeris would then be with respect to the user-input TLE object.\n\nEquivalently, one can specify the observing center with @ TLE notation. This will use the last TLE object input as the coordinate origin. Only one such TLE object can be defined at a time; new TLE input deletes the prior specification.\n\nSince Horizons maintains trajectories for some Earth-orbiting satellites, this capability means one can produce satellite-to-satellite ephemerides and generate relative position data for them.\n\nExamples of satellite-to-satellite specification:\n\nTo observe the input TLE object from the already-in-Horizons International Space Station (ISS), request target TLE (or -887820, for the example above), then set observing point as @ -125544.\n\nTo instead observe ISS from the input TLE object, request target -125544, then set the observing point as @tle (or @ -887820, for the example above).\n\nCustomizing Output\n\nThere are four types of output tables users can request and customize:\n\nCartesian state vectors\n\nOsculating orbital element tables\n\nObserver tables\n\nClose-approach tables\n\nKeys are embedded in output ephemerides to assist with automated reading of the output by usersâ own software. The keys are:\n\n$$SOE Start of ephemeris $$EOE End of ephemeris\n\nThe â*â symbols below denote login defaults.\n\nTables types 1-3 may be optionally output in a âcomma-separated-valueâ format for import into spreadsheets.\n\n1. Cartesian state vector table\n\nOverview and usage:\n\nThis type of table provides the position and velocity at an instant of any object with respect to any major body or specified point on its surface. Such output would be of interest to those working on dynamical studies or needing the motion described in 3-dimensional space as a function of time.\n\nNote that for comets and asteroids, SPK binary files can be generated by users. Such files continuously represent this same state vector information in a way that can be interpolated by user software at any intermediate instant. SPK files for major bodies, such as planets and natural satellites, must be obtained separately, such as from the Solar System Dynamics group:\n\nhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/bsp\n\nhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/satellites/bsp\n\nâ¦ or from the NAIF node of the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS),\n\nhttps://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data_generic.html\n\nâ¦ but not through Horizons, which creates and distributes SPK files for asteroids and comets only.\n\nReference plane * frame (\"equatorial\" ICRF) ecliptic body (central body equator and node of date) Reference frame: * ICRF B1950 (FK4/B1950) Aberration corrections: * NONE (geometric state vectors) LT (light-time) LT+S (light-time & stellar aberration) Units: KM and seconds KM and days AU and days Quantities Output: Format Output ------ ------ 1 Position components {x,y,z} only (with optional statistical uncertainty output) 2 State vector {x,y,z,vx,vy,vz} (with optional statistical uncertainty output) * 3 State vector + 1-way light-time + range + range-rate 4 Position + 1-way light-time + range + range-rate 5 Velocity components {vx, vy, vz} only 6 1-way light-time + range + range-rate\n\nSpecify one of the basic vector table output types by its numeric code (1-6).\n\nThe DEFAULT is table type 3 (with no statistical uncertainties).\n\nStatistical uncertainties can be requested on table types 1 and 2 by adding coordinate system code(s) x, a, r, or p after the integer, where x refers to XYZ, a to ACN, r to RTN, and p to POS.\n\nFor example, 1xa returns position components with their uncertainties in XYZ and ACN coordinate systems; 2ap returns position and velocity, with their uncertainties in ACN and POS coordinates.\n\nIf no statistical data is available for a given target but uncertainty output is requested, ân.a.â symbols will appear in output (meaning ânot availableâ).\n\n2. Osculating orbital elements table\n\nOverview and usage:\n\nThe instantaneous osculating orbital elements of an object with respect to a planet or barycenter.\n\nOrbital elements encode the position and velocity (the state vector) at one instant in a geometrically meaningful way and can be used to initialize comet and asteroid numerical integrations. They should be used cautiously for any other purpose.\n\nReference plane: * frame (\"equatorial\", ICRF) ecliptic body (central body equator and node of date) Coordinate system: * ICRF FK4/B1950 Units: KM and seconds KM and days AU and days * Output quantities (fixed): JDTDB Epoch Julian Date, Barycentric Dynamical Time EC Eccentricity QR Periapsis distance IN Inclination w.r.t. xy-plane (degrees) OM Longitude of Ascending Node (degrees) W Argument of Perifocus (degrees) Tp Periapsis time (user specifies absolute or relative date) N Mean motion (degrees/DU) MA Mean anomaly (degrees) TA True anomaly (degrees) A Semi-major axis AD Apoapsis distance PER Orbital Period\n\n3. Observer table\n\nOverview and usage:\n\nThe output values in observer tables are âas seenâ by an observer, being compensated for aberrations such as light-time and other significant perspective-dependent effects.\n\nObserver tables may be produced for any target object as seen by an observer from topocentric coordinates on or at the center of a major body (planet, natural satellite, spacecraft, and some asteroids) with a defined rotation model.\n\nTargets can also be specified as surface coordinates on another major body, such as a crater.\n\nDefault quantities that are always present in an observer table: include\n\nTime Universal Time (UT) or Terrestrial Time (TT) output timescales can be selected\n\nSolar-presence symbol Indicates dawn and twilight conditions, and if the Sunâs limb is above or below the local horizon)\n\nLunar-presence Indicates if the Moonâs limb is above or below the local horizon\n\nAdditional user-selectable quantities are output in the order selected. The desired output quantities must be specified at least once. No initial default output exists in telnet o"
