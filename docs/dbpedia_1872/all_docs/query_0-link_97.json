        "text": "The Sextans Dwarf Spheroidal is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that was discovered in 1990 by Mike Irwin as the 8th satellite of the Milky Way,[4] located in the constellation of Sextans. It is also an elliptical galaxy, and displays a redshift because it is receding from the Sun at 224 km/s (72 km/s from the Galaxy). The distance to the galaxy is 320,000 light-years and the diameter is 8,400 light-years along its major axis.[5]\n\nSextans Dwarf SpheroidalObservation data (J2000 epoch)ConstellationSextansRight ascension10h 13m 02.9s[1]Declinationâ01Â° 36â² 53â³[1]Redshift224 Â± 2 km/s[1]Distance290 Â± 30 kly (90 Â± 10 kpc)[2][3]Apparent magnitude(V)10.4[1]CharacteristicsTypedSph[1]Apparent size(V)30â².0 Ã 12â².0[1]Notable featuressatellite galaxy of the Milky WayOther designationsSextans I,[1] LEDA 88608[1]"
