        "text": "Birth of Philosophy Circa 600 BCE:\n\nA short definition of philosophy is the study of the reality in terms of first principles which usually/always have to be discovered from their consequences.\n\nTwo main components of philosophy have always been natural philosophy (philosophy applied to nature in the broadest sense including human aspects) and ethics (philosophy applied to behavior of humans or, more generally, any intelligent beings).\n\nThe philosophy involves reason and observation/experiment.\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophers were relatively strong on the former and pretty weak on the latter.\n\nFor Ancient Hellas (AKA Ancient Greece) illustrated by the Acropolis of Athens, see the figure below (local link / general link: acropolis.html).\n\nphp require(\"/home/jeffery/public_html/astro/hellas/acropolis.html\");?> Philosophy was born (by usual reckoning) in Ancient Greece circa the early 6th century BCE.\n\nWhy then and there?\n\nThere probably can be no indisputable answer, but one can try.\n\nAncient Greece at that time (i.e., Archaic Greece (circa 8th century -- 480 BCE)) was a confident society.\n\nThe confidence was probably in large measure to its success in expansion: settling colonies around much of the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nIt's a glum fact that this colonization involved conquest and enslavement, but in ancient times this was generally regarded as OK if you did it to others, but NOT if it was done to you.\n\nHowever, confidence also came from self-aware progressive achievement in trade, crafts, art, literature (Homer (circa 700 BCE) Hesiod (circa late 8th century BCE), etc.) and sports (e.g., ancient Olympic Games)---the ancient Greeks generally thought well of themselves---but who doesn't? For Greek sculpture illustrated, see the figure below (local link / general link: charioteer_delphi.html).\n\nphp require(\"/home/jeffery/public_html/astro/art/charioteer_delphi.html\");?> Societal confidence plus the fact that the Archaic Greeks were aware they had much to learn from older societies of the ancient Near East and ancient Egypt made them relatively open to new ideas and innovations. The Archaic Greeks were, in fact, emerging from the Greek Dark Ages (circa 1100--circa 800 BCE) when they were illiterate and rather out of touch with the world at large.\n\nFor big example of an innovation, the Archaic Greeks accepted the alphabet from the Phoenicians---they modified for the ancient Greek language and added vowels (see Wikipedia: Alphabet: Ancient Northeast African and Middle Eastern scripts)---which meant they no longer had to say \"grk\".\n\nContact with other societies also made the Archaic Greeks aware that their mythology was NOT universal---others had other mythologies. One can react in three ways to this information:\n\nOur mythology is right and theirs is wrong---or vice versa.\n\nAll mythologies are about the same when you identify enough correspondances.\n\nMaybe all mythologies are just stories and you have to do philosophy.\n\nProbably, all reactions occurred to the Archaic Greeks. The case for philosophy is pretty certain since the Presocratic philosopher Xenophanes (c.570--c.475 BCE) tells us that was his reaction, more or less: his fragments:\n\nBut mortals think that the gods are born\n\nand have the mortals' own clothes and voice and form.\n\nOne god, greatest among gods and humans,\n\nlike mortals neither in form nor in thought.\n\nThe gods have NOT, of course, revealed all things to mortals from the beginning;\n\nbut rather, seeking in the course of time, they discover what is better.\n\nFor philosophy to flourish, free debate is probably essential.\n\nOne special kind of debate that the ancient Greek philosophers carried on is called elenchos and the logos is the logic behind the argument. As the John's Gospel puts it: ην αρχη ην ο λογοσ --- In the beginning was the logos. See video John 1 GREEK New Testament.\n\nFree debate the Archaic Greeks had to some degree.\n\nTheir society was politically pluralistic: it was divided into many independent city-states (poleis: singular polis) with varying kinds of government.\n\nVery few city-states were ancient Greek democracies, but in most, sufficiently high-ranking men (but NOT women) debated political and legal issues.\n\nThis means these high-ranking men (and probably others too) could easily slide over to debating other issues in art, literature, sport (inevitably), and, if they were so inclined, philosophy.\n\nIt seems that given the right societal conditions some individuals will always be interested in philosophy and, in particular, in natural philosophy.\n\nIn fact, in Classical Antiquity (AKA Greco-Roman Antiquity), the number of people interested in natural philosophy was always pretty small: just few recorded persons in any generation though probably a much larger number of unrecorded persons of generally lesser importance.\n\nActually in agrarian societies like Classical Antiquity (AKA Greco-Roman Antiquity), 90 % or more of the population were illiterate peasants and had limited participation in the high culture of their society (see Wikipedia: Roman Empire: GDP and income distribution). Yours truly imagines the lives of the peasants were like in the novels by Thomas Hardy (1840--1928) or in The Potato Eaters: see the figure below (local link / general link: vincent_van_gogh_potato_eaters.html).\n\nphp require(\"/home/jeffery/public_html/astro/art/vincent_van_gogh_potato_eaters.html\");?> That ancient Greece (prior to Alexander the Great (356--323 BCE) and his father Philip II of Macedon (382--336 BCE)) had pluralism (multiple independent city-states) and at the same time unity (same language, culture, mythology) was probably of critical importance in the development of impressive natural philosophy. There could be many experiments in thought and at the same wide cultural communication.\n\nThe period of continuous progress in ancient Greek science/nature-knowledge (i.e., natural philosophy and, speaking a bit more generally, nature-knowledge) is arguably from circa 600 BCE to circa 200 BCE---this was the golden age of ancient Greek science/nature-knowledge. After 200 BCE, ancient Greek science/nature-knowledge petered out with sporadic achievements until finally extinguished in the 6th century CE.\n\nWhy the petering out is the story for another day. In fact, we've already covered part of it in the subsection Golden Ages and the Scientific Revolution.\n\nThe societal situation that gave rise to the great achievements in ancient Greek science/nature-knowledge is similar to that of Western Europe in the Renaissance---a relatively confident, open society with pluralism and unity. So it is NOT surprising that the Renaissance was, among other things, the golden age of Renaissance science. The Renaissance, however, was at a much higher scientific and technological level actually than Classical Antiquity.\n\nRenaissance science did NOT, however, peter out, but accelerated into the Scientific Revolution (fiducial era c.1543--c.1687).\n\nBut that is also a story for another day. For a large part of the story, see H. Floris Cohen (1946--), How Modern Science Came into the World: Four Civilizations, One 17th-Century Breakthrough, 2011."
