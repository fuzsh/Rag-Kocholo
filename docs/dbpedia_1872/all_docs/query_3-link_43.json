        "text": "Each of the APOGEE spectrographs has 300 fibers that are held to their sky positions using plug plates. The 300 fibers are divided into three types of targets. First, we pick telluric targets to estimate atmospheric absorption lines, second we select our science targets, and third we choose sky targets to estimate sky emission across the field-of-view. The consolidated list of targets from each type is then sorted by priority such that if any pair of fibers are incompatible for plugging, the lower priority fiber is rejected. All potential rejections are checked until we have the desired number of fibers of each type.\n\nPlates observed with the APOGEE-N spectrograph have a 7 square degree field of view (1.5$^{\\circ}$ radius), while those observed with APOGEE-S spectrograph have a 2.8 square-degree field of view (0.95$^{\\circ}$ radius). After science and calibration targets are selected, we reject fibers based on fiber collisions. A \"collision\" occurs when two fibers, if placed on the plate, would be separated by less than the size of the protective ferrule around each fiber. When collisions occur, the lower priority target is rejected. For the APOGEE-N, the collision radius corresponds to 71.5$''$ while for APOGEE-S, it is 56$''$.\n\nFor APOGEE-2S, acquisition cameras at the center (on-axis) and outer (off-axis) regions of each plate are required. These cameras are used to calibrate the central location of pointing, alignment, and scale, but imply that the areas covered by those cameras are not available for fiber allocation. Thus, candidates in those positions are also rejected. The on-axis camera covers the central 5.5$'$ of the plate, and the dimensions of the off-axis camera are approximately 10$'$ by 7$'$. For APOGEE-2N, there is a central post that supports the plate that obscures the central 96$''$ of the field.\n\nEach field in an APOGEE observing program includes sets of stars to be observed separately called designs. They are identified using a design id, and several designs can have stars in common with each other. Still, even a difference of a single star distinguishes different designs, and each will be given a unique design id (DESIGNID). Then, a plate corresponds to the phyisical piece of metal used to make each observation. Each plate is used to observe all the stars from a single design and the position of the fibers in them depend not only on the coordinates of the stars, but also the hour angle (HA) at which the plate is going to be observed (because that parameter determines the atmospheric refraction correction terms). For that reason, a plate is equivalent to a design $+$ HA combination, and therefore, a plate contains only 1 design, but each design can be observed using multiple plates (at different HA values).\n\nA design can be further broken into targets in 1, 2, or 3 distinct cohorts, which are a subset of stars restricted to a specific magnitude range. For each field, we make multiple combinations of cohorts to create the different designs. This means that all the stars in a given cohort belong to the same designs, and thus, are always observed together. Cohorts were designed to make optimal use of our time to avoid observing bright stars for more time than needed to obtain the goal $S/N$ value. Using cohorts, we can get relatively similar total $S/N$ values over a wide range of magnitudes. Thus, the brightest stars are grouped into short cohorts, medium brightness stars into medium cohorts, and the faintest stars are grouped into long cohorts.\n\nAPOGEE Target Bitmasks\n\nTo track why each target was selected for observation, we use target flags that are recored using targeting bitmasks. If you are not familiar with bitmasks, please see the SDSS bitmask primer.\n\nThe target bitmasks used in APOGEE-2 are called APOGEE2_TARGET1, APOGEE2_TARGET2, and APOGEE2_TARGET3 (and an unused one called APOGEE2_TARGET4). The target bitmasks used for APOGEE-1 are APOGEE_TARGET1 and APOGEE_TARGET2 (and an unused one called APOGEE_TARGET3). The bits within the flags are not exactly aligned between the two generations of APOGEE.\n\nWe also include a streamlined bitmask called EXTRATARG in the summary data files. This bitmask allows users to quickly select Main Red Star Sample targets, which have no EXTRATARG bits set (i.e., EXTRATARG==0). More discussion on how to use EXTRATARG is given on Using Targets/Samples.\n\nMore information on how to use Target Bitmasks is on Using Targets/Samples and a summary of changes to the bitmasks in DR17 is given in Caveats, and some examples of using bitmasks with APOGEE data are provided in our Data Access Examples.\n\nTelluric Correction Targets\n\nIn APOGEE-2, each plate contains 15 telluric fibers, whereas APOGEE-1 plates had 35 telluric fibers.\n\nThe APOGEE wavelength range contains several contaminant spectral features from Earth's atmosphere, such as CO2, H2O, and CH4 absorption bands and OH airglow emission lines. The APOGEE data reduction pipeline (Nidever et al. 2015) attempts to remove these features using observations of hot stars to characterize the telluric absorption. To make a telluric absorption correction, we would ideally use a perfect (e.g., featureless) blackbody. Given that hot stars are the best approximation for those, we select the bluest stars in the field. Telluric calibrators are chosen across the full field-of-view to account for spatial variations in the telluric absorption . The procedure is as follows: (i) the field-of-view is divided into equal-area zones, (ii) the bluest star within each zone is selected, and (iii) the bluest stars in the field, regardless of location, are selected. The telluric targets are not dereddened. For more details, see Zasowski et al. (2013).\n\nThese stars have bit 9 set in APOGEE_TARGET2 or APOGEE2_TARGET2. EXTRATARG bit 2 is a convenience flag that identifies telluric calibrators across APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2.\n\nSky Targets\n\nAll APOGEE plates contain 35 sky fibers. The data reduction pipeline uses observations of the “empty” sky to monitor airglow. To select suitable empty-sky positions, we select positions that do not have a 2MASS detection within 6$''$. Then, the field is split into equal-area segments, and up to 8 candidates are selected for each zone. The final list of sky fibers is selected randomly from the candidates to ensure uniform coverage across the plate.\n\nThe resulting sky spectra could be suitable for the study of the physical conditions, chemical composition, and variability of Earth’s atmosphere. However, these spectra are available only at the single exposure stage, because sky subtraction is performed for each fiber location in each exposure (ap2D, data model). The details of how sky observations are used are given in Visit Combination. See the \"Observation Files\" section of the DR17 Data Access page for how to obtain intermediate data products through the SAS.\n\nThese \"targets\" have bit 4 set in APOGEE_TARGET2 or APOGEE2_TARGET2, but these spectra are not present beyond ap2D(data model).\n\nOrder of Operations\n\nGenerally, fibers are assigned in the following order:\n\nTarget Class\n\nDescription\n\nTelluric\n\n35 fibers in APOGEE-1, 15 fibers in APOGEE-2. See description.\n\nSpecial Targets\n\nTargets provided for specific goals (e.g. star clusters, ancillary programs, or contributed programs). The number of targets can vary from a handful to using all available science fibers. The targets are selected from catalogs based on their input priorities and then evaluated for fiber collisions.\n\nMain Red Star Sample\n\nFollowing the rules described below. If any fibers are unused on a plate, they will be assigned targets from the Main Red Star Sample.\n\nMaStar\n\nAPOGEE-2N only. Observations made are made with MaNGA fiber bundles for calibration stars as well as spectro-photometric standards and sky observations. See MaStar Observing Strategy.\n\nSky\n\n35 Fibers. See description.\n\nDuring the APOGEE-2N Bright Time Extension, the highest priority MaStar targets were allocated fibers at the highest priority on the plate (e.g., before APOGEE telluric selection). Lower priority targets, spectro-photometric calibrations, and skies for the MaStar program were assigned in the same order as above. Fields designed in this way have \"_btx\" appended to their FIELD name. The MaNGA fiber bundles are larger than APOGEE fibers and have a larger fiber-collision radius of 93.6$''$. Extra care was taken in these fields to ensure that this change did not adversely impact APOGEE-2 scientific priorities, but it could impact the Main Red Star Sample selection function (see Beaton et al. (2021) for a discussion).\n\nThe APOGEE Main Red Star Sample was designed to select giant-type stars using color-magnitude selection criteria. One important motivation for this method was having a simple set of rules permitting a robust reconstruction of the true selection function (see Selection Biases). We describe the general sense of the quantities used for targeting before giving the limits employed for the survey. We also provide brief descriptions of how targeting changed between parts of the survey as indicated by the specific color-magnitude criteria.\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nMagnitude Limits\n\nThe magnitude limits are determined by the number of visits expected for each group of stars and the objective to obtain S/N of 100 per pixel. For each field, there is an associated total number of visits. Long cohort (faintest) stars in a field will be observed every time APOGEE visits the field, while medium and short (brightest) cohort stars will only be observed for a subset of the total visits of the field. The type of cohort in which a star is included is recorded in APOGEE_TARGET2 or APOGEE2_TARGET2 targeting bitmasks, where bits 11, 12, and 13 are set for “short”, “medium”, and “long” cohort stars, respectively. The faint magnitude limits of each cohort are chosen such that the faintest stars of each one will have spectra with a final (combined) signal-to-noise of 100 per pixel and, typically three radial velocity epochs, which implies the following values\n\nH Magnitude Limits:\n\nNumber of Visits\n\nH Magnitude Range\n\n1\n\n7.01 $\\lt$ H $\\lt$ 11.0\n\n3\n\n7.01 $\\lt$ H $\\lt$ 12.2\n\n6\n\n12.2 $\\lt$ H $\\lt$ 12.8\n\n12\n\n12.8 $\\lt$ H $\\lt$ 13.3\n\n24\n\n12.8 $\\lt$ H $\\lt$ 13.8 or 13.3 $\\lt$ H $\\lt$ 13.8\n\n1In some disk cohorts, the bright limit was reduced to H=10; stars selected this way are flagged with APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 23.\n\nStars with $(J-K_{s})_0$ and $H$ within the relevant limits are then randomly sampled within each cohort. Note that the final total magnitude distribution of spectroscopic targets in a field may differ significantly from the underlying magnitude distribution because the former also depends on the number of each type of cohort in the field as well as on the fraction of science fibers allotted to each type of cohort. Further discussion can be found on Selection Biases.\n\nDereddened Color Selection\n\nFor color selection, we use dereddened colors. Thus, we apply a reddening correction to each source as follows:\n\nif $4.5\\mu m$ photometry is available from either Spitzer or WISE, $E(J-K)$ is estimated using $E(H−4.5 \\mu m)$ from the Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess method (RJCE; Majewski et al. 2011),\n\notherwise, $E(J-K)$ is estimated from the $E(B−V)$ reddening value from the Schlegel et al. (1998) maps.\n\nThe method used for each star is given by its APOGEE_TARGET1 or APOGEE2_TARGET1 bitmask:\n\nBit\n\nDereddening Technique\n\n3\n\nRJCE dereddening using Spitzer/IRAC photometry\n\n4\n\nRJCE dereddening using WISE photometry\n\n5\n\n$E(B-V)$ dereddening from Schlegel et al. (1998) (SFD)\n\n6\n\nNo dereddening\n\nNo reddening corrections were applied for telluric absorption calibrators.\n\nMain Red Star Sample Science Programs\n\nThe specific strategy used to select the Main Red Star Sample for a given field depends on the structural component of the Galaxy being targeted; these are: the bulge, disk, and halo. The classification of a field is loosely related to the field position in Galactic coordinates, but there are other considerations. Here we describe the magnitude and color limits imposed for specific structural components.\n\nBulge\n\nAll APOGEE bulge stars (both APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2) were selected using a single color limit of $(J−K_s)_0$ ≥ 0.5 mag. For APOGEE-1 targets, bulge fields were selected in the galactic region 357≤ l ≤ 22, |b| ≤ 16, while for APOGEE-2 the bulge region was expanded and corresponds to 340 ≤ l ≤ 20, |b| ≤ 25.\n\nAll APOGEE-1 bulge fields had one visit, with a faint magnitude limit of H=11 mag.\n\nGiven that the Galactic bulge reaches much higher altitudes in the southern hemisphere, all APOGEE-2 bulge fields were observed as part of APOGEE-2S. These fields have a faint magnitude limit of either H=12.2 mag or H = 12.8 mag. Fields designed to a H = 12.2 mag depth were scheduled for three total visits following the standard magnitude visits relation. Due to an underestimation of the time that it would require to complete the bulge APOGEE-2S plan, cohorts in H = 12.8 mag depth bulge fields are not always scheduled for the total number of visits required to reach S/N of 100. In any case, a lower limit of signal-to-noise of ~80 is guaranteed for all APOGEE-2S bulge fields given the number of visits assigned to each cohort.\n\nAll APOGEE-2 designs from bulge fields have the PROGRAMNAME “bulge”.\n\nSummary of Bulge Targeting\n\nSurvey Range in $b$ Range in $\\ell$ Color Magnitude Limit\n\nAPOGEE-1\n\n$|b|\\leq 16^{\\circ}$ $357^{\\circ}\\leq \\ell \\leq 22^{\\circ}$ $(J-K_s)_0\\geq 0.5$ $H\\leq 11$\n\nAPOGEE-2S\n\n$|b|\\leq 25^{\\circ}$ $340^{\\circ}\\leq \\ell \\leq 20^{\\circ}$ $(J-K_s)_0\\geq 0.5$ Either:\n\n$H\\leq 12.2$ or\n\n$H\\leq12.8$\n\nDisk\n\nFor APOGEE-1 targets, a single color limit of $(J−K_s)_0 \\geq 0.5$ mag was applied in disk fields. For APOGEE-2, a dual-color limit was used, with a defined fraction of the targets having $0.5 \\leq (J−K_s)_0 \\leq 0.8$ mag and the rest with $(J−K_s)_0 \\geq 0.8$ mag. For fields from the inner disk we selected half of the stars in each color bin, while fields from the outer disk ($120^{\\circ} \\le \\ell \\le 240^{\\circ}$) had 25% of stars selected with $0.5 \\leq (J−K_s)_0 \\leq 0.8$ and 75% with $(J−K_s)_0 \\geq 0.8$ mag. The fraction of targets in each color bin is recorded in the apogee2Design (data model) file for each plate design.\n\nFor APOGEE-1 targets, disk fields were selected in the Galactic region $24^{\\circ} \\leq \\ell \\leq 240^{\\circ}$, $|b| \\leq 16^{\\circ}$, while for APOGEE-2 the disk region corresponds to $20^{\\circ} \\leq \\ell \\leq 340^{\\circ}$, $|b| \\leq 25^{\\circ}$.\n\nAPOGEE disk fields had depths of $H$=12.2, 12.8, and, in some cases, 13.8 mag. In some APOGEE-2 disk cohorts, the bright limit was reduced to $H$=10 mag to increase the number of faint, and hopefully distant, disk targets. Our original plan was to apply this reduced magnitude limit for all the fields where we expected to fill both color bins with the reduced magnitude range, but due to an error in implementation it was not applied uniformly over regions of the sky (See Caveats); stars selected this way are flagged with APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 23.\n\nAPOGEE-2 designs from disk fields that are not part of APOGEE-2N Bright Time Extension have PROGRAMNAME “disk”, “disk1”, or “disk2”. In APOGEE-2, the \"disk1\" program is meant to mirror the APOGEE-1 disk footprint, \"disk2\" are new fields, and \"disk\" are randomly placed fields.\n\nIn the APOGEE-2N Bright Time Extension, a focused effort was made to target substructure in the outer disk. This occurred in two parts: (1) we explicitly targeted confirmed substructure members from previous work (APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 7) and (2) we identified substructure candidates using reduced proper motion criteria (following the $J$-band reduced proper motion dwarf-giant separation formulated by Collier Cameron et al. 2007) to remove foreground dwarf stars (APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 8). These fields have programname “odisk” and have “_btx” appended to FIELD.\n\nSummary of Disk Targeting\n\nSurvey Range in $b$ Range in $\\ell$ Color Magnitude Limit\n\nAPOGEE-1\n\n$|b|\\leq 16^{\\circ}$ $24^{\\circ}\\leq \\ell \\leq 240^{\\circ}$ $(J-K_s)_0 \\geq 0.5$ $H \\lt 12.2$ (3-vis)\n\n$12.2 \\lt H \\lt 12.8$ (6-vis)\n\n$12.8 \\lt H \\lt 13.3$ (12-vis)\n\nAPOGEE-2\n\n$|b|\\leq 25^{\\circ}$ $20^{\\circ}\\leq \\ell \\leq 340^{\\circ}$ Two Bins:\n\n$0.5 \\leq (J-K_s)_0 \\leq 0.8$\n\n$0.8 \\leq (J-K_s)_0$ Typical Cohorts:\n\n$H \\lt 12.2$ (3-vis)\n\n$12.2 \\lt H \\lt 12.8$ (6-vis)\n\n$12.8 \\lt H \\lt 13.8$ (12-vis)\n\nHalo\n\nFor all halo programs, a single limit of $(J−K_s)_0 \\geq 0.3$ mag was used for halo fields; the bluer color limit was enacted to boost counts because halo-fields have far fewer target candidates).\n\nFor APOGEE-1 targets, halo fields were selected in the galactic region $|b|\\gt 16^{\\circ}$, while for APOGEE-2N and APOGEE-2S the halo region corresponds to $|b| \\geq 25^{\\circ}$ APOGEE halo fields had depths of $H$ = 12.2, 12.8, or 13.8 mag, to increase the number of distant stars and, thus, halo membership fractions.\n\nThe APOGEE-2 halo effort had three targeting sub-programs:\n\nan APOGEE-1 like Washington+DDO51 strategy,\n\nthe Bright Time Extension halo program, and\n\nthe Southern halo/stream coordinated program.\n\nWashington+DDO51 strategy:\n\nFor the original APOGEE-2 halo program, we use Washington $M$, Washington $T2$, and $DDO51$ (Wash+D, hereafter) photometry to classify stars as dwarfs or giants prior to their selection as spectroscopic targets, in addition to the reddening and magnitude limits applied for each field (e.g., Majewski et al. 2000). This pre-selection is employed in these particular fields to increase the selection efficiency of giant stars, which have an intrinsically higher dwarf fraction for APOGEE's magnitude range than for fields in the Galactic plane. Even though a large fraction of APOGEE-2N fields were designed using this “original” strategy, the APOGEE-2S halo program was significantly modified, and thus, only 2 fields in APOGEE-2S were designed in this manner (280+45 and 320+45).\n\nStars targeted as photometrically classified giants have bit 7 set in APOGEE_TARGET1 or APOGEE2_TARGET1 and are prioritized over photometrically classified dwarfs which have bit 8 set in APOGEE_TARGET1 or APOGEE2_TARGET1. All APOGEE-2 designs from halo fields that are not part of APOGEE-2N Bright Time Extension have PROGRAMNAME “halo.”\n\nBright Time Extension:\n\nIn the APOGEE-2N Bright Time Extension, a focused effort was made to target more distant stars. This occurred in two parts:\n\nwe explicitly targeted confirmed K-giants from SEGUE (APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 20), and\n\nwe identified halo candidates using proper motion criteria that removed foreground stars (APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 21).\n\nDesigns from these halo fields will have PROGRAMNAME “halo_btx” and “_btx” appended to FIELD.\n\nSouthern Halo-Stream Coordinated Program:\n\nThe majority of the APOGEE-2S halo fields were designed to target more distant stars. Four of these new fields exclusively target halo members and candidates (313+29, 294+40, 256+26, and 255-27), while the other 34 new fields coordinated halo and stream observations in the same field by placing fields on identified stream members (described below in Halo Substructures), and targeting other foreground/background halo members and candidates. 26 of these fields targeted the Sagittarius tidal stream, six targeted the JHelum stream, and two the Orphan Stream. Metal-poor halo members (APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 20) in these fields were selected from Skymapper photometric metallicities, and distant halo candidates (APOGEE2_TARGET2 bit 21) in these fields were identified and targeted using Gaia DR2 proper motions.\n\nSummary of Halo Targeting:\n\nSurvey Range in $b$ Range in $\\ell$ Color Magnitude Limit\n\nAPOGEE-1\n\n$|b|\\geq 16^{\\circ}$ no $\\ell$ limits $(J-K_s)_0 \\geq 0.3$ $H \\lt 12.2$ (3-vis)\n\n$12.2 \\lt H \\lt 12.8$ (6-vis)\n\nAPOGEE-2\n\n$|b| \\geq 25^{\\circ}$ no $\\ell$ limits $(J-K_s)_0 \\geq 0.3$ Typical Cohorts:\n\n$H \\lt 12.2$ (3-vis)\n\n$12.2 \\lt H \\lt 12.8$ (6-vis)\n\n$12.8 \\lt H \\lt 13.3$ (12-vis)\n\n$13.3 \\lt H \\lt 13.8$ (24-vis)\n\nFiller Targets\n\nIf there are any unused fibers in a plate design for any scientific sub-program -- including Special Programs, then these unused fibers are assigned to the Main Red Star Sample using the appropriate color-magnitude selection. The color-magnitude selection is set by the number of visits for the plate and the Galactic sub-component suitable for the field as given above (e.g., the ($\\ell$, $b$) limits for bulge, halo, disk given above). These targets are selected after targets are assigned fibers for the primary scientific goal."
