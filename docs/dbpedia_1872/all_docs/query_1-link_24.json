        "text": "Planetary radiation consists mainly of thermally emitted radiation (at IR wavelengths) and of reflected light of the parent star (at UV-optical-IR wavelengths). Both types of radiation hold information on the composition and structure of the planet’s atmosphere and/or surface. Traditionally, most instruments measure only the spectral dependence of the total flux (i.e. total energy) of planetary radiation. However, LUVOIR will measure both total and linearly polarized fluxes as functions of the wavelength.\n\nThe next decade will see a multiplication of space-based planet detection facilities (CHEOPS, TESS, and PLATO in particular [note that these missions have neither spectroscopic nor UV capabilities]) that will provide us with a large number of transiting planets covering the whole parameter space necessary to thoroughly study transiting exoplanet atmospheres and escape processes from an observational perspective. For example, the TESS mission is expected to find about 1700 planets orbiting nearby stars, some of which will lie in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs, while PLATO will greatly supersede these numbers, particularly by extending the search to longer-period planets [118, 133].\n\n2.1 Direct imaging and spectroscopy of Exo-earths\n\nTo date, about a dozen exoplanets have been discovered with masses and/or radii similar to or somewhat larger than the Earth in the “habitable zone” of their parent star (i.e. at distances from their parent star that may allow liquid water on their surfaces), including a planet in the habitable zone of our nearest stellar neighbour, Proxima Centauri b [2]. However, whether or not these planets are truly habitable remains an open question – the habitable zone planets known to date have only been detected indirectly, and we cannot yet probe their atmospheric composition. Characterising the planetary context as well as the detection of biosignature gases in exoplanet atmospheres via spectroscopy and photometry is necessary to determine if so-called habitable zone planets are truly habitable or indeed, inhabited. There are only two methods – direct imaging and transit spectroscopy – that yield photons and hence spectra from planets, enabling direct measurement of atmospheric properties.\n\nSuch spectroscopic techniques are already in use today to characterise the atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets, mini-Neptunes, and super-Earths, all highly irradiated transiting planets [76, 128] as well as wide-separation, young giant planets [12, 99, 152]. Exoplanet spectroscopy has revealed that aerosols are likely common both for transiting and directly imaged planets [76, 129, 130].\n\nWhile transit spectroscopy is a highly valuable technique for characterizing exoplanets, due to viewing geometry, only ~10% of planets will have observable transits, and even less for habitable zone planets. Thus, direct imaging will provide a more complete census of the characteristics of planets, particularly those around higher mass stars where transits of habitable zone planets are too infrequent to characterise systems on reasonable timescales. Direct imaging spectroscopy of planets also literally provides a different angle compared to the currently dominant transmission spectrum method of studying transiting exoplanet atmospheres. For an Earth-like planet around a G2V star, refraction geometrical effects limit the depth of the atmosphere probed to 12 km and higher even in the absence of clouds or hazes [8]. Many spectral features that are only marginally detected or undetected in transmission spectra would be more easily detected in directly imaged spectra [108].\n\nA LUVOIR will be sensitive to almost all exoplanet atmospheres, from hot to cold, close-in and far, gas giants to exo-Earths. Such sensitivity is necessary to properly place any exo-Earth in context. It will also yield unprecedented new characterisation opportunities for higher mass planets. For instance, Crossfield et al. [22] used the Doppler imaging technique to produce a surface map of the nearby brown dwarf Luhman 16B -- the first such map for any brown dwarf. With a high-resolution spectrograph and the high-contrast capabilities of LUVOIR, it will be possible to produce similar surface maps for directly imaged exo-Jupiters, allowing us to literally map out the cloud patterns on these planets [23].\n\nHabitable zone planets will likely be imaged in the next two decades -- Proxima Centauri b will be easily imaged by an extreme AO coronagraph at the E-ELT [140] and the E-ELT instrument METIS may detect additional exo-Earths around somewhat higher mass nearby early M stars [21]. However, without spectroscopic confirmation of the presence of biosignature gases, such as O2/O3 in combination with CH4, in context with other planetary indicators of habitability such as H2O and CO2, it will be unclear if such planets are truly habitable or inhabited [96].\n\nAdditionally, LUVOIR will enable UV observations (inaccessible from the ground), critical to understanding the photochemistry of these atmospheres. A low stellar UV environment allows certain biosignatures undetectable in an Earth-Sun analogue to potentially build up to detectable levels, such as N2O around quiescent M dwarfs [123]. Also, the ratio of far-UV to near-UV is what determines the amount of O3 in an exo-Earth atmosphere [127]. Most of the known false positive mechanisms for O2 and O3 are informed in part by the UV environment of the host star [28, 53, 97]. Thus, it will be vital to have contemporaneous measurements of the UV stellar radiation field of habitable exoplanets in order to contextualize the atmospheric abundance of biosignatures in habitable exoplanets.\n\nTo build a picture of habitability as a function of host star, planet mass, etc., it is vital to characterise habitable zone planets orbiting a wide range of host stars. In Fig. 1, contrasts achievable with current and future high-resolution imagers are plotted alongside current known directly imaged exoplanets and our own Solar System planets (assuming a distance of 20 pc). There are 64 G0-G5 stars within 20 pc of the Earth. While earlier missions and telescopes such as JWST, the Roman Space Telescope, and the ELTs will yield photometry and spectroscopy of a handful of habitable zone planets around low mass M and K dwarfs (e.g. Proxima Centauri b), only LUVOIR will yield the contrasts and resolutions necessary to detect and characterise true Earth twins (i.e. Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars). Through a LUVOIR-class mission we will be able to observe enough planets to reach statistically meaningful conclusions regarding the frequency and characteristics of exo-Earths and of Earth-like habitable environments, and to better understand our own planet in its astronomical context.\n\nCoronagraphic capabilities will also enable the study of Jupiter and Saturn analogues. Some observations of this class of planet (of order 10 targets) are likely to be obtained with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman Space Telescope) at wavelengths from 0.5–0.9 μm, but a larger platform would require shorter integration times and would, therefore, be able to cover a far greater number of targets. In addition, the increased wavelength range into the near-IR and UV would enable further constraints to be placed on atmospheric properties. Space-based observations of Solar System gas giants from 0.2–5 μm in both reflected and thermal (> 4 μm) radiation have uncovered details of cloud structure and ammonia/phosphine chemistry (e.g. [39, 47, 65]). R ~ 150 ultraviolet measurements of Jupiter using IUE in the 1980s [50] provided constraints on abundances of trace hydrocarbon species, providing important information about carbon chemistry on the planet. A large space-based coronagraph with spectral coverage across a substantial part of this wavelength range, would, therefore be extremely valuable.\n\n2.2 Transiting exoplanet atmospheres\n\nSince the detection of the first exoplanet transit in 2002, our understanding of these exotic worlds has increased enormously, mostly thanks to the technique of transit spectroscopy. As an exoplanet passes in front of its star during transit, some of the starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere, and it reaches the observer bearing signatures of any absorbers and scattering particles that are present in the atmosphere (e.g. [111, 128]). In addition, when the same planet is eclipsed by the star, the difference between the total fluxes outside of and during the eclipse enables detection of thermal radiation from the planet in the infrared, and reflected starlight in the visible and ultraviolet [35, 104]. For a few hot planets orbiting bright stars, phase-resolved spectroscopic observations over a whole orbit have provided longitudinal maps of atmospheric properties (e.g. [4, 73, 77, 132]). Taken together, these measurements can provide sufficient information to constrain atmospheric structure and composition (e.g. [5, 38, 57, 92, 100, 139]), and thence to draw inferences about atmospheric chemistry and dynamics (e.g. [66, 89, 94]).\n\nThe vast majority of high-quality transit, eclipse, and phase curve observations have been obtained from space using the HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), in both high- and low- resolution modes, the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instruments, and the Spitzer InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC), or from the ground using high resolution spectrographs. Together, these instruments cover the wavelength region between 0.3–5 μm, with several gaps and variable spectral resolution (e.g. [128]). JWST will cover this spectral region from 0.6 μm onwards, but the eventual failure of HST will spell an end to space-based near-UV/visible light measurements for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe near-UV and visible spectral region is particularly critical for the study of cloud and haze properties of exoplanets in transmission spectra. The scattering efficiency for atmospheric aerosols, particularly for small particles, tends to increase at shorter wavelengths, making this spectral region ideal for detecting their presence and placing constraints on particle size and altitude. Condensation and photochemical haze formation are both critical atmospheric processes, and characterisation of aerosols is, therefore, an important aspect of atmospheric science, with links to atmospheric chemistry and structure. In addition, a poor understanding of aerosol properties can lead to misinterpretations of other spectral characteristics, as molecular absorption features in cloudy extended atmospheres can mimic absorption features in compact, high molecular weight atmospheres (e.g. [93]).\n\nOnly two examples exist so far of a reflection spectrum from secondary eclipse, but the geometric albedo measurement of HD 189733b in particular, showing substantial reflection at blue wavelengths ([35]; Fig. 2), is arguably one of the most important in the field. Determining planetary albedo, as well as measuring outgoing thermal flux, is necessary to understand the energy budget of a planet (e.g. [125]). The majority of known exoplanet host stars have significant output in the UV and visible. Hence, albedo measurements in these wavelength regions are necessary if the field is to progress. Such measurements are challenging as reflected light signatures are generally very small compared with the total system flux, and a space telescope with a large collecting area represents the only viable means of obtaining them. A UVOIR platform will allow reflected light and thermal signatures to be obtained with the same optics, minimising potential systematic problems with reconciling the data. Understanding energy deposition, recirculation and radiation in hot exoplanets requires an observatory of this kind.\n\nAs well as providing significant opportunities to advance the study of hot Jupiters, smaller temperate worlds will also be key targets for a large UVOIR observatory. The TRAPPIST-1 system [48, 49] hosts seven transiting Earth-sized planets. TRAPPIST-1 planets are already key targets for JWST, but since the M8-type host star is red, small and faint, observations in the UV and visible with HST are more challenging. A larger platform would significantly enhance the likelihood of obtaining such measurements in the UV and visible, which would allow among other things a direct search for atmospheric oxygen as a biosignature through detection of the 0.75 μm O2-A band. Characterising the atmospheres of nearby rocky, temperate worlds is a key goal for the immediate future of UVOIR astronomy, and a space-based spectroscopic platform with coronagraphic potential is a key part of this vision.\n\nDuring transit, a planet may or may not occult star spots present on the star’s surface. Transit spectra for planets orbiting stars with high spot coverage will contain signatures of occulted or unocculted star spots, which can be misinterpreted as planetary atmospheric features [115, 116]. UV spectroscopic observations of the star prior to or after transit can help assessment of stellar activity, via measurement of CaII H and K lines. In addition, starspot contrast is strongest at shorter wavelengths, meaning that the presence of spots in lightcurves is more likely to be detected in the UV and enabling an estimate of the spot coverage. Stellar activity is a critical factor for planetary environment, especially for worlds in close orbits, and ultraviolet capability can provide key constraints in this regard.\n\nVidal-Madjar et al. [143, 144] obtained STIS far-ultraviolet transmission spectra of the close-in giant planet HD209458b revealing that the planet possesses an extended hydrogen atmosphere. How much of the extended atmosphere is hydrodynamically escaping [75] and how much is due to stellar wind interaction [71] is still an open question. It is clear that atmospheric escape is a key factor shaping the evolution of close-in planets ([112], and references therein) and their habitability [20, 83, 84], but the dependence of escape on the irradiating stellar UV flux and wind is far from being understood.\n\nThis atmospheric escape is driven mostly by the stellar X-ray and EUV photons that deposit energy (i.e., heat) in the planet upper atmosphere, but the majority of the stellar spectrum causing escape is unobserved (no efficient instrument with EUV coverage has been built so far and the stellar EUV emission is absorbed by the interstellar medium). UV observations, particularly of Lyman alpha and other high formation temperature lines, allow one to infer the EUV stellar flux and hence correctly estimate the energy budget of an exoplanet atmosphere [19, 41, 95, 154]. By observing planetary transits at different wavelengths, from the FUV to the NUV, one also probes the intermediate region between the upper and lower atmosphere [15].\n\nAtmospheric escape also has a major impact on our understanding of planet formation and consequently population (e.g., [79]). Because of high mass-loss rates, some low-mass close-in planets (e.g., CoRoT-7b, Kepler-10b) might be the remnant cores of evaporated Neptune-mass planets [78, 82, 87, 88, 91, 97]. HST observations of the Neptune-size planet GJ436b showed that even warm giant planets can undergo significant escape and form very large tails of escaped planetary material (Fig. 3; [14, 32, 81]). Escape processes, the upper atmosphere of planets, and its interactions with the host star can be thoroughly studied only at UV wavelengths, because at longer wavelengths the optical depth of the escaping planetary material is too low.\n\nTo fully explain the processes behind atmospheric escape requires the acquisition of UV transmission spectroscopy observations for about 150 transiting planets orbiting stars down to a V-band magnitude of 14. The brightest solar-like stars that are members of nearby, young (between 20 Myr and 100 Myr), clusters and associations have V-band magnitudes between 12 and 14. The observations should ideally be carried out at both FUV and NUV wavelengths for the brightest/nearest systems (< 60 pc and/or brighter than V ~ 9 mag, depending on the stellar characteristics) and only at NUV wavelengths for the remaining objects. A complete sample of planets is necessary to look for and study on a statistically significant basis, correlations of atmospheric escape with system parameters.\n\n2.3 Spectropolarimetry of exoplanets\n\nPolarimetry increases the planet/star contrast [67] and thus helps distinguishing planetary from stellar photons. Indeed, while direct starlight is virtually unpolarised [68], starlight that has been reflected by a planet will generally be polarised, even when integrated across the planetary disc, and even for a symmetric planet (e.g. [126, 131]). Measuring a polarised signal would directly confirm the planetary nature of an object. Indeed, the polarisation signal will be largest around planetary phase angles of 90° (that occur at least twice every planetary orbit), where the planet-star angular separation is largest. Also a planet’s thermal radiation will be polarised when it is scattered by aerosol and clouds within a planet’s atmosphere [74]. However, for a symmetric planet, the disc integrated thermal polarisation signal will be negligible, which is why one should prefer polarimetry across the UVOIR.\n\nThe state of polarisation of the reflected starlight is more sensitive to the planet’s physical properties, such as the cloud particles composition (see Figs. 4 & 5 from [63, 121]), than the total flux (see [52]), especially when measured as functions of the phase angle and wavelength. Because the state of polarisation is a relative measure (polarised flux versus total flux), it is insensitive to e.g. distances and/or the planet’s radius. Spectropolarimetry can thus play an essential role in characterising properties of planetary atmospheres and surfaces. For instance, the polarisation across the O2-A band is strongly sensitive to cloud coverage and altitude [36]. Polarised signals of exo-zodiacal dust discs and e.g. planetary rings will differ from those of exoplanets and allow the characterisation of planetary environments.\n\n2.4 Detection and measurement of planetary magnetic fields\n\nThe presence of a planetary magnetic field appears to be an important ingredient for the advent and further evolution of complex life on the surface of a planet. A large scale magnetic field would screen the planetary surface and atmosphere from high-energy stellar wind particles that would lead to a quicker escape of the atmosphere [70] through ion pick-up from the stellar wind (hence the need to study also stellar winds; [71]), and greatly damage the formation and stability of complex molecules, such as DNA. For a distant observer, Earth’s magnetic field could be detected by measuring the bow-shock heading towards the Sun and lying at several Earth radii from the surface, well above Earth’s atmosphere. This bow-shock is generated by the interaction of Earth’s magnetic field with the supersonic Solar wind.\n\nTransit asymmetries (i.e., early ingress; Fig. 6), some of which are believed to be caused by bow-shocks, have been detected at UV and optical wavelengths (e.g., [7, 18, 40, 145, 146]). Bow-shocks could be of magnetic or non-magnetic origin and in some cases, from repeated observations and detailed modeling, it is possible to distinguish between them [10, 31, 141]. This can be done for example by measuring the distance between the planet and the head of the bow-shock from the timing of the early-ingress, where a large distance would hint at a magnetic support of the bow-shock, that could then be confirmed by follow-up modeling. Transit observations with LUVOIR will allow us to detect and measure transit asymmetries. Follow-up modeling will allow us then to infer their origin and, in some cases, the planetary magnetic field strengths [145].\n\n2.5 The bulk composition of rocky Planetesimals and planets\n\nKnowledge of the bulk composition of exoplanets is of key importance for their detailed characterisation, and a complete understanding of planet formation. However, traditional exoplanet observations yield only bulk densities (from mass and radius measurements obtained for transiting planets), and interior structures and composition based on these measurements are model-dependent and subject to degeneracies [29, 120]. For the foreseeable future, FUV spectroscopy of white dwarfs accreting planetary debris remains the only way to directly and accurately measure the bulk abundances of rocky exoplanetary bodies.\n\nPractically all known planet host stars, including the Sun, will evolve into white dwarfs, and many of their planets will survive [150]. Planetesimals and planets are perturbed onto star-crossing orbits by dynamical interactions with more massive planets [26, 149], where they are eventually tidally disrupted and accreted by the white dwarf [61, 142]. In a pioneering paper, Zuckerman et al. [155] showed that measuring the photospheric abundances of debris-polluted white dwarfs provides an unrivalled window into the bulk composition of exoplanets, in full analogy to meteorites informing us about the composition of the Solar System. High-resolution (R > 20,000) ultraviolet spectroscopy is fundamental for this work, as the wavelength range contains strong transitions of the rock-forming elements (Si, Fe, Mg, O), refractory lithophiles (Ca, Al, Ti), and in particular of volatile elements (C, N, P, S) that must be resolved to trace the formation region of the planetary material relative to the snow line. HST/COS spectroscopy corroborates the rocky, volatile-depleted nature of the disrupted planetesimals and planets [62], with a variety of bulk compositions similar to, if not exceeding, that seen among Solar System bodies ([43], see Fig. 7). These results have already informed recent models of planet formation [17]. Of particular importance for the properties of planetary systems are the C/O and Mg/Si ratios. C/O ratios >0.8 would result in a radically different setup from the Solar System, with O-chemistry replaced by C-chemistry, which is discussed abundantly in the literature (e.g. [109]). The Mg/Si ratio determines the exact composition of silicates, which in turn has implications for planetary processes such as plate tectonics.\n\nGlobal insight into the chemistry of planetary systems as a function of the mass and age of their host stars requires far-UV abundance studies of a substantial number of white dwarfs. Both the number of available targets, and the sensitivity of HST/COS currently limit progress. Over the next decade, Gaia will astrometrically identify ~105 white dwarfs, which will be followed up with ground-based multi-object spectrographs (WEAVE, 4MOST, DESI). Detection of Ca K 393 nm will select 1000s of systems accreting planetary debris spanning the full parameter range in host/progenitor properties, providing a rich target sample for detailed LUVOIR far-ultraviolet bulk composition measurements.\n\nIt would also be possible to determine the abundances present by using transit spectroscopy of rocky surfaces of very close-in planets, such as Mercury. Such planets usually hold a mineral atmosphere that is composed of the minerals evaporated from the rocky solid or liquid (i.e., lava) surface (e.g., [27, 117]). Minerals evaporate from the planetary surface under the action of the intense stellar wind (sputtering) and then escape from the planet (Fig. 8; e.g., [58, 72, 103, 110, 148]). UV and optical high spectral resolution transit observations would allow one to characterise the physical properties of the mineral atmosphere, including the identification of the major chemical species forming the atmosphere (e.g. O, Ca, Fe, Na, Si) and of their relative abundance (e.g., [72, 148]).\n\nIt is currently believed that several of these close-in rocky planets would be the remnant cores of Neptune-mass planets that have lost their atmosphere through escape (e.g., [60]). If this is the case, the study of mineral atmospheres would allow us to infer the chemical composition of the core of gaseous giant planets, something which is not possible even for the Solar System planets. The results obtained from such observations would be invaluable to inform planetary formation and structure models. The CHEOPS, TESS, and PLATO space missions will discover several of such close-in rocky planets, which observations (by CoRoT, Kepler, and K2) have shown constitute a non-negligible population of all planets in the galaxy.\n\n4.1 The evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs)\n\nAccretion discs are very common structures in the Universe- they are the means for nature to channel mass accretion when the intrinsic angular momentum of the infalling gas is high. They work on a poorly known mechanism that transports angular momentum from the large scale into the viscous/micro scale where the excess angular momentum is released as heat. In the most widely used approach, the so-called α-disc, the disc is treated as a set of nested rings with matter orbiting as per Kepler’s laws. For the matter from the outer disc to reach the stellar surface, viscosity and shear between adjacent rings need to be invoked. The excess energy is transported to (and dissipated at) the eddy scale (i.e., the smallest scales of the turbulence), but angular momentum is transported to large radius, producing the subsequent heating of the disc. The spectral energy distribution predicted by this simple model fits well with the integrated radiative output from PPDs in spite of the uncertainties about its physical foundations and operation. Since 1991, Magneto Rotational Instability (MRI) has been thought to play a key role in enabling the radial transport of mass. However, to operate, MRI requires disc ionisation fractions that are not met by the gas in some areas of PPDs; for Solar-like stars, this MRI dead zone is located in the planet formation zone (at radii from 1 AU to 10 AU). Many ideas have been advanced to solve this problem in the context of PPD evolution. To mention but a few: the onset of turbulent mixing in the PPDs dead zone, the action of gravitational instabilities and density waves as additional mechanisms for angular transport, or a more realistic evaluation of the energy budget irradiating the disc, including the outflow contribution. However, only direct imaging of the inner 20 AU of PPDs can provide the data to determine the sources of radiation accurately, to measure the radiation field reaching the surface of PPDs, map the gravitational/density waves acting on the disc and study the variation of the disc temperature from the mid plane (at IR wavelengths) to the atmosphere (at UV wavelengths) for radii in the 1–100 AU range. Milliarcsecond spatial resolution (MASI) is required to rigorously address the physics of PPDs since all spectroscopic means rely on the Keplerian rotation of the disc and derive the disc structure based on the Doppler shifting/broadening of the relevant spectral tracers.\n\n4.2 The connection between PPDs and jets\n\nThough bipolar outflows are the first signature of star formation, no theory anticipated them prior to the discovery of the outflow from L1551. The collimation and mechanical power of outflows decreases as stars approach the main sequence and protoplanetary discs (PPDs) evolve into debris discs. The tracers of the outflows depend on the degree of evolution of the parent source. Flows from very young sources (104–105 yrs. old) often contain molecules such as H2, CO, and SiO. Later on, they tend to be dominated by HI and low-ionization metals that are observed as prominent large-scale jets detected at optical wavelengths ([S II], [N II], or Hα lines). Mass-loss rates decline from ~10−6 M⊙ yr−1 in the youngest sources to ~10−10 M⊙ yr−1 before being switched off. Typically, the mass-loss rate is ~10% of the PPD accretion rate and the velocity about few hundred km s−1.\n\nOutflows are thought to be composed of:\n\nAn episodic component ejected from the boundary layer between the star and the disc that carries on the excess magnetic energy generated by the magnetic coupling between the star and the inner border of the disc.\n\nA stable component or disc wind that carries on the toroidal magnetic field and keeps the wind collimated.\n\nRequired diagnostics that cannot be observed today are:\n\nRotation of the jet (if disc wind is magnetised and carries on a toroidal field it should be rotating)\n\nConnection between magnetized disc winds and photoevaporative flows\n\nSource of the episodic emission and connection with accretion\n\nIrradiation of the disc by the outflow.\n\nMany uncertainties remain due to the lack of observations to constrain the modeling. Very important questions still open are: What role do disc instabilities play in the whole accretion/outflow process? What are the dominant processes involved in wind acceleration? How does this mechanism work, if it does, when radiation pressure becomes significant as for Herbig Ae/Be stars? What are the relevant time-scales for mass ejection? How does the high-energy environment affect the chemical properties of the disc and planetary assembly? How do the stellar magnetospheres evolve? What is the role of binarity and planet formation in disc evolution? MASI at UVOIR wavelengths is needed to address them.\n\n4.3 Globular clusters and nearby stellar populations\n\nThe nearby Universe offers us a unique window to the processes of star formation and galaxy assembly. The depth and level of detail of nearby studies provide us with a reference to calibrate more distant systems, and represent the only opportunity to constrain and understand the underlying physics at the (sub)parsec level.\n\nStellar clusters were traditionally thought of as excellent examples of “simple stellar populations” - consisting of stars with a single age and a single chemical composition. While this still holds true for low-mass open clusters in the Solar neighbourhood, it is clear that massive globular clusters (GCs) that inhabit the Galactic halo are far more complex systems. Colour-magnitude diagrams from HST show multiple populations that reveal themselves through parallel main sequences, split red giant branches, and other features [105]. In massive GCs in the Milky Way, multiple populations are associated with enhancements in light elements and helium content [6, 51].\n\nTwo key capabilities of HST have been crucial in uncovering the variety of this phenomenon in old GCs: 1) from space, it is possible to achieve exquisite photometric accuracy that is very hard to reach from the ground, especially in crowded environments, 2) space-based observations provide access to important spectral features in the UV (CH, CN, and NH molecular bands) that are sensitive to the light-element abundance variations that trace the multiple populations (see Fig. 9). It is important to note that none of the currently planned future facilities (JWST, Euclid, E-ELT…) will deliver improvements in these two critical aspects simultaneously.\n\nYoung star clusters with globular cluster-like masses (>105 M⊙) are rare and tend to be located beyond the Local Group. Even with HST, it is extremely challenging to obtain photometry of individual stars in such clusters, and only crude information exists about their stellar contents [85]. Imaging with a 10 m space telescope will, however, make it possible to obtain exquisite photometry for hundreds of post-main sequence stars per cluster, as well as thousands of fainter stars. In addition to providing unprecedented constraints on stellar evolution (e.g. the role of binary/multiple stars and stellar rotation), such observations would also provide a key constraint on formation scenarios for multiple populations by establishing (or ruling out) their existence in young clusters (and other environments, such as galaxy nuclei), establishing whether age spreads are present, and determining the fractions of stars belonging to the different populations.\n\nThe GC systems of galaxies beyond the Local Group (LG) offer unique complementary diagnostic power to the problem of multiple populations [6]. A 10 m-class telescope in space will provide ~1pc resolution and unprecedented sensitivity (AB~31mag) out to a distance of ~20Mpc. This volume includes the two closest galaxy clusters, Virgo and Fornax. These environments represent the natural habitats of compact stellar systems, harbouring tens of thousands of old GCs and ultra-compact dwarfs (e.g. [30]). A 10 m-class telescope in space will be able to infer the existence of such He-enriched subpopulations through accurate UV-to-optical colours, because a UV excess is characteristic of horizontal branches that are well populated at high effective temperatures. For the first time, it will be possible to fully resolve these compact stellar systems radially, further constraining the relative radial contribution of the subpopulations. These studies will finally assess whether the presence of helium-enriched subpopulations is a widespread phenomenon of all GCs, or if it depends on the nature (stellar mass, morphological type) of the host galaxy.\n\nUnfortunately, detailed studies of field stars and stellar clusters are mostly confined to the Local Group (LG) because of sensitivity, resolution, and crowding effects. While much has been learned of the ages and elemental abundances of stars in LG galaxies, cosmic variance still constitutes a fundamental limitation. A 10 m-class observatory with UV-to-NIR imaging capabilities in space will allow the study of the star formation and chemical enrichment histories, the dust content, the massive end of the stellar mass function, and the populations of star clusters of all galaxies within the Local Volume (~10 Mpc). This will represent an order of magnitude increase in sample size, finally including galaxies of all luminosities, morphological types, and inhabiting a variety of environments. Access to UV imaging at high spatial resolution is of particular relevance to address questions related to star clusters and hot stars, and when combined with optical and NIR photometry allows for simultaneous determination of effective temperatures and extinction.\n\n4.4 Massive stars\n\nMassive stars are cosmic engines and probes of the Universe. In life they are mighty sources of ionising radiation and mechanical energy, leaving their striking imprint as bubbles and giant HII regions or as galactic-scale outflows. In death they are the progenitors of supernovae and long γ-ray bursts, events so bright they can be detected in distant galaxies, offering promising potential probes of star formation up to redshift z = 9 [119]. During the explosion a number of chemical elements essential to life as we know it are released, the most important of which is Oxygen. Their remnants are neutron stars, pulsars and black holes, sites of extreme physics that will guide us through the Universe in the new domain of gravitational waves opened by LIGO and Virgo (e.g. [1]).\n\nInsights into these topics require an excellent understanding of the lifecycle of massive stars, including their physical properties and evolutionary sequence, both of which are strongly affected by their chemical compositions. Massive stars in the low-metallicity regime are key to interpreting the Universe as we look toward the earliest times, particularly toward the near metal-free ‘first stars’ (Population III). However, current facilities put severe limits on our ability to obtain robust empirical constraints at the lowest metallicities. The Small Magellanic. Cloud (SMC; at 60 kpc) is the most metal-poor environment where a broad sample of massive stars can be resolved and analyzed in detail today, forming the current standard for the metal-poor regime, e.g. spectral libraries of its massive stars feed population-synthesis codes that model the far Universe such as Starburst99 [90]. However, the SMC’s 1/5 Z⊙ metallicity is far from the 1/300 Z⊙ detected in quasars at z = 5 [114].\n\nA vital aspect to our understanding of the evolution of metal-poor massive stars is their stellar winds. During most of their lives, massive stars shed mass by the action of their own radiation field at a rate that decreases with decreasing luminosity and metallicity [80]. This prediction has been confirmed observationally down to the metallicity of the SMC [107] and, indeed, radiation-driven mass loss is considered negligible in models of Pop III stars [33, 101]. This point is relevant as the mass-loss prescription in the models of stellar evolution can significantly change the evolutionary sequence, stellar feedback, and the final pre-supernova mass.\n\nGround-based 8-10 m telescopes enabled first exploration of galaxies beyond the SMC with lower oxygen abundances: IC1613, WLM, and NGC3109, finding unexpected results such as a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) with strong P Cygni profiles [54], an extreme oxygen-rich Wolf-Rayet star [137], and indications of stronger-than-expected stellar winds from analysis of visible spectroscopy [55, 138]. The essential need for UV observations was demonstrated by HST/COS observations of OB stars in IC1613 which showed that their wind strength had been overestimated [13, 44]. Only with the UV data were we able to glean that the sample stars are oxygen-poor, but their iron content is roughly comparable to that of the SMC. In other words, the truly metal-poor regime remains unexplored.\n\nThe evolutionary sequence of metal-poor massive stars is also yet to be defined. Very fast rotating stars could undergo a special channel, called chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) where they stay compact with high effective temperatures [135], leading to increased ionizing fluxes by factors of two to four. This is one of the channels invoked to explain the binary systems leading to the gravitational wave signals detected by LIGO [106]. However, we have been unable to test the predictions of CHE due to the paucity of observations in sub-SMC metallicity environments.\n\nHST has produced outstanding contributions to the advancement of massive stars, but it is time for a sizeable step forward. IC1613, WLM, NGC3109, and the promising 1/10 Z⨀ galaxy Sextans A [16] are located at 0.7–1.2 Mpc, i.e., a factor 10 to 20 further than the SMC and at the limit of current facilities. Two other extremely metal-poor star-forming galaxies have been recently surveyed for O-type stars, SagDIG (1/20 Z⨀; [46]) and Leo P (1/30 Z⨀; [34]), but they have relatively sparse populations as well as the fact that their distance and foreground extinctions limit optical (let alone UV) follow-up. In short, greater sensitivity combined with excellent spatial resolution (at visible and UV wavelengths) is needed to enable the required quantitative studies in the metal-poor regime. We also note that only UV spectroscopy can provide insights on the stratification of stellar winds and their inhomogeneities [42, 134]. UV access, together with ALMA and/or Athena is essential to characterise radiation-driven winds in extragalactic massive stars.\n\nA formidable facility such as LUVOIR will allow us to study individual stars in DDO68 and IZw18, an important landmark in the road to the low-metallicity Universe with 1/32 Z⨀ [3, 151]. Located at distances of 13 and 18 Mpc, respectively, their populations cannot be resolved by current instrumentation, but would be by LUVOIR working at the diffraction limit in the UV. LUVOIR would also open-up observations of resolved massive stars in a diverse range of galaxies out to several Mpc, including galaxies in the Sculptor, Centaurus, and M81 groups (see e.g. KINGFISH: [69]).\n\nReconstructing the lifecycle of metal-poor massive stars requires observations of quasi-coeval populations and determination of physical properties of large samples. This is typically performed in three stages:\n\nPhotometric census: High quality optical/near-IR photometry is crucial to study the star-formation history of external galaxies and to identify candidate massive stars. HST has proved superior to larger ground-based telescopes in this respect, with minimal sky background levels and a spatial resolution unmatched by adaptive optics at the shorter wavelengths, providing outstanding photometric catalogs of resolved populations in Local Group and nearby galaxies (e.g. [136]; ANGST: [24], HTTP: [124]). The enhanced collecting power of LUVOIR will comfortably reach IZw18, and continue the search of very massive stars in gas- and dust-enshrouded nurseries of closer galaxies. Its spatial resolution will be key to push such studies of resolved populations beyond the Local Group.\n\nMulti-object spectroscopy: Visible/near-IR spectroscopy is then needed to confirm the candidate stars and determine their physical properties. Because of the large integration times involved, this is typically performed with multi-object spectrographs from the ground. The ELT will be able to reach the brightest OB stars out to ~4–5 Mpc. However, panchromatic UV to near-IR spectra with stable flux calibration from space are also needed, as only Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting can yield extinction towards the star, hence accurate luminosities and stellar masses. Moreover, at visible wavelengths the ELT will be significantly limited by the effects of Earth’s atmosphere – high-performance adaptive optics at blue wavelengths is still a long way in the future, space-borne spectroscopy with a LUVOIR-like platform will substantially out-perform ELT spatially, and be competitive in terms of overall sensitivity.\n\nUV spectroscopy: UV observations will enable characterisation of the winds of metal-poor massive stars. The 1200–1800 Å range, accessible only from space, holds exclusive information on the wind velocity and is the spectral range where hot massive stars emit the most. Sparing regions of severe extinction, both LUVOIR concepts will comfortably reach the faintest O-stars out to distances of several Mpc (see Fig. 10). Pushing the facility to its limits, and thanks to the spatial resolution improvement, it will also reach the brightest OB stars in galaxies such as DDO68 and IZw18, providing a unique chance to investigate the properties of massive-stars in near primordial conditions.\n\nA more expansive version of this case is given in Garcia et al. [45] (this volume)."
