Sextantis; HD 92841; HR 4193), or simply 35 Sex, is a triple star system located in the equatorial constellation Sextans. The primary has an apparent magnitude of 6.09,[2] making it barely visible to the naked eye, even under ideal conditions. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 7.01,[2] making it readily visible in binoculars, but not to the naked eye. The system is located relatively far at a distance of approximately 700 light-years but it is drifting closer with a combined heliocentric radial velocity of −2.18 km/s.[16]\n\nThe System\n\nThe system was first observed by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve in 1821.[17] The separation between the A and B component was initially 7.90 arcseconds,[17] but it has since decreased to 6.62\".[18] Thanks to this separation, the components 35 Sextantis can be distinguished using a telescope. Observations from Tokovinin & Gorynya (2007) revealed that the B component is a single-lined spectroscopic binary.[9] The primary and secondary both take 23,302 years to orbit each other while the secondary and its close companion take 1,568 days to revolve around each other in a relatively eccentric orbit.[9]\n\nPhysical characteristic\n\n35 Sextantis A has a stellar classification of K2.5 III,[5] indicating that it is an evolved K-type giant star that has exhausted hydrogen at its core and left the main sequence. 35 Sextantis B has a classification of K1 II-III,[6] indicating that it is a hotter, more evolved K-type star that has the luminosity class intermediate between a bright giant and giant star. The primary has 2.45 times the mass of the Sun[8] but it has expanded to 25.39 times the radius of the Sun.[10] It radiates 240 times the luminosity of the Sun[10] from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,512 K,[11] giving it an orange-hued when viewed in the night sky.\n\nThe secondary has a similar mass to the primary[8] but it is smaller, having a radius 10.15 times that of the Sun.[13] 35 Sextantis B radiates 57.2 times the luminosity of the Sun[13] from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5030 K.[11] Both stars are metal deficient with iron abundances of [Fe/H] = −0.17 and [Fe/H] = −0.16 respectively.[12] They spin modestly with projected rotational velocities of 3.7 km/s and 4.1 km/s.[7] The close companion has a mass 58% that of the Sun's,[8] suggesting that it may be a K-type main-sequence star."
