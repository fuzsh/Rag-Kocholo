        "text": "Divine Orb - general information\n\nDivine Orb is one of the most expensive and rarest Orbs in Path of Exile. Divine Orbs have an average exchange ratio of around 1 to 200 to Chaos Orbs, having replaced Exalted Orbs as the primary in-game currency just recently. For most players, they have very limited uses, as they are mainly used for end-game/meta Crafting, and you will usually need a bunch of them to complete such craft. Originally,\n\nDivine Orbs can be found anywhere in the game, looted from slain monsters, dropped from chests, destructible objects, and strongboxes. They have a slightly higher drop chance from Arcanist's Strongboxes and Blighted/Legion Chests which are guaranteed to drop Currency items. Obviously the higher the Monster level, the higher the chance to drop Divine Orbs and other higher Tier Currency, but the chances are still extremely, whereas you can complete tons of Maps and find not a single Divine Orb in them. If you are a casual player and you come across a Divine Orb on your journey, you should primarily consider exchanging it for Chaos Orbs or valuable items and buying a gear upgrade.\n\nDivine Orbs are used by high-level players in the process of meta-crafting to min-max the stats of end-game gear. Since their drop chance is so low, most likely no one would be able to provide themselves with enough Divine Orbs to complete their items, and obtaining them via trading is usually the only efficient way. Like all other Orbs, you can buy them using real cash on the Odealo marketplace. You can go to Odealo to buy PoE Divine Orb at the best possible prices and in any quantity. With multiple sellers offering Divine Orbs for sale, you can buy them all the platforms available including PC, Xbox One, and PS4, and on all available Leagues and all game modes including Standard, Softcore/Hardcore, and Ruthless.\n\nAcquisition - Divine Orbs are much harder to obtain than almost any other type of currency item in the game as there are no shards to progressively assemble one, and because of their exceptional rarity. There is no vendor recipe for a Divine Orb too. The most reliable way to get them is to exchange your Chaos Orbs or to aim for specific Divination Cards - The Sephirot, Divine Beauty, and Brother's Gift. Such Cards drop in specific areas or from certain monsters. Increase your chance of getting them by using Divination Scarabs or activating proper Eldritch Altars. Blue Eldritch Altars themselves are capable of rewarding you with Divine Orbs, although the chance for it is small. Another quite reliable way of getting them is from Tujen whom you can haggle with for 1-slot items. You can, of course, also aim for items whose value exceeds a Divine Orb and trade them away, as the Divine Orbs themselves are treated more like means of getting rich than a goal in itself. Players may also consider to Buy Divine Orb with real money in online stores, or directly from regular players on marketplaces like Odealo.com\n\nFunctionality - The function of a Divine Orb is to change the values of all explicit modifiers on an item. Their tiers and types remain the same so there is no chance of ruining an already good item. You can use them on Unique items too, some of which heavily rely on these values. Examples of such items are Ventor's Gamble, The Brass Dome, and Black Sun Crest. However, be aware that by selling three of the same unique items to a vendor you can receive one of them back with random rolls, which mimics the usage of a Divine Orb. Changing values with Divine Orbs is only justified in already very expensive unique items such as Mageblood, or to min-max a rare gear piece. Another function of Divine Orbs is to craft meta-mods on a Crafting Bech. These mods have no value other than to help you craft an item further by preserving a certain group of modifiers or increasing the number of modifiers that can be crafted. It's a complex and expensive endeavor used by experienced players. Divine Orbs also have an interesting property that's not directly indicated in its description. When new Patches introduce significant changes to Unique Items, sometimes you may be able to change the outdated Items' stats to the new current version of the Item. However, it's not always recommended, as on many occasions the older version will have significantly better stats. For example, using Divine Orb on Legacy Kaom's Heart (with 1,000 bonus Maximum Life) would lower the Life bonus by half (and you would be basically throwing away a couple of Mirrors in the process).\n\nIn trade - Because of their function combined with unprecedented rarity, Divine Orbs are very valuable. A single Divine Orb is valued at around 200 Chaos Orbs which are another popular currency item. Divine Orbs are used to trade for expensive gear pieces, most notably those whose price exceeds 1200 Chaos Orbs as you can't fit more of them into a trade window. It's also much more convenient. One Divine Orb is usually enough to purchase a sophisticated rare gear piece for a popular build. If the desired item is listed for a fraction of a Divine Orb, be sure to have Chaos Orbs at hand and calculate how much of them will be needed using their current worth.\n\nOdealo is one of the best places to supply gamers with Divine Orbs for their daily needs in the Path of Exile. Odealo is one of the most secure shops for PoE Divine Orb, where all offers are posted by regular players. It has a form of an open, global marketplace, whereas Odealo maintains the security of each transaction. Here you can sell and buy Divine Orbs at the best exchange rate and with fast delivery. Odealo supports trading on all available game modes: Standard, Challenge Leagues, and for both Softcore and Hardcore players. You can also trade Divine Orbs on all platforms including PC/Steam, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 (PS4)."
