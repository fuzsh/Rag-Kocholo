        "text": "The Local Group of Galaxies\n\nThis is \"our\" group of galaxies. It was first recognized by Hubble, in the time of the first distance determinations and redshift measurements (see, e.g., his The Realm of the Nebulae).\n\nMessier objects: The Andromeda Galaxy M31 and its satellites M32 and M110, as well as the Triangulum Galaxy M33.\n\nOther members (over 30 in all) include our Milky Way Galaxy, the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC), which have been known before the invention of the telescope, as well as several smaller galaxies which were discovered more recently. These galaxies are spread in a volume of nearly 10 million light years diameter, centered somewhere between the Milky Way and M31. Membership is not certain for all these galaxies, and there are possible other candidate members.\n\nOf the Local Group member galaxies, the Milky Way and M31 are by far the most massive, and therefore dominant members. Each of these two giant spirals has accumulated a system of satellite galaxies, where\n\nthe system of the Milky Way contains many (nearby) dwarf galaxies, spread all over the sky, namely Sag DEG, LMC, SMC, the recently discovered and widely disrupted Canis Major Dwarf, and the dwarf galaxies in Ursa Minor, Draco, Carina, Sextans (dwarf), Sculptor, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, and perhaps the Phoenix Dwarf, and Leo A (which may alternatively belong to the NGC 3109 subgroup), as well as probably 10 or 11 newly discovered known dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n\nthe system of the Andromeda galaxy is seen from outside, and thus grouped around its main galaxy M31 in Andromeda, containing bright nearby M32 and M110 as well as fainter and more far-out NGCs 147 and 185, the very faint systems And I, And II, And III and possibly And IV (but for this one see remark below), And V, And VI (Pegasus dwarf), And VII (Cassiopeia dwarf), And VIII, And IX, and And X, as well as probably the newly discovered dwarf spheroidals And XI, And XII, And XIII, and And XIV.\n\nThe third-largest galaxy, the Triangulum spiral M33, may or may not be an outlying gravitationally bound companion of M31, but has itself probably the dwarf LGS 3 as a satellite. Also, IC 1613 may perhaps be a member of the M31 subgroup, as may be the doubtful members UGCA 86 and UGCA 92.\n\nThere is a third potential subgroup around irregular galaxy NGC 3109, which contains Sextans A, Sextans B, the Antlia Dwarf and perhaps Leo A (but that one may belong to the Milky Way subgroup).\n\nThe other members, mostly dwarf irregulars, cannot be assigned to one of these main subgroups, and float quite alone in the gravitational field of the giant group members. They tend to form a vast cloud, the Local Group Cloud.\n\nOnly one dwarf galaxy, GR 8, seems to be so isolated that it doesn't belong to any of these substructures.\n\nThe substructures of the group are probably not stable. Observations and calculations suggest that the group is highly dynamic and has changed significantly in the past: The galaxies around the large elliptical Maffei 1 have probably been once part of our galaxy group.\n\nAs this shows, the Local Group is not isolated, but in gravitional interaction, and member exchange, with the nearest surrounding groups, notably:\n\nthe Maffei 1 group, which besides the giant elliptical galaxy Maffei 1 also contains smaller Maffei 2, and is associated with nearby IC 342 and a number of smaller galaxies. Highly obscurred by dark dust near the Milky Way's equatorial plane.\n\nthe Sculptor Group or South Polar Group (with members situated around the South Galactic pole), dominated by NGC 253\n\nthe M81 group\n\nthe M83 group\n\nThe next more distant galaxy groups, the NGC 4244 group and the CVn I Cloud (with M94 and M64) are probably too remote to have interacted significantly with the Local Group in the past.\n\nIt is of interest that of the subgroups of the Local Group mentioned above, the NGC 3109 group tends to the general direction of the Maffei 1 group and the M81 group, while the Local Group Cloud tends to the general direction of the Sculptor Group.\n\nIn the future, interaction between the member galaxies and with the cosmic neighborhood will continue to change the Local Group. Some astronomers speculate that the two large spirals, our Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy, may perhaps collide and merge in some distant future, to form a giant elliptical (see a summary of a possible scenario). In addition, there is evidence that our nearest big cluster of galaxies, the Virgo Cluster, will probably stop our cosmological recession away from it, accelerate the Local Group toward itself so that it will finally fall and merge into this huge cluster of galaxies, see our Virgo Cluster & Local Group page.\n\nA table of the currently known Local Group member galaxies follows. While the positions are known very acurately, the distances are only very vaguely known for some members, and the sources even disagree for the most prominent members such as M31 and M33. If interested, look at our compilation of distances from various sources. Please note that this table is currently under review, as new data (Hipparcos distances, discovery of new members) keep our knowledge in flow.\n\nLocal Group Member Galaxies\n\nGalaxy RA Dec Type m_v dim RV Dist WLM 00:02.0 -15:28 IB(s) IV-V 10.9 12 x 4 - 42 3400 IC 10 00:20.4 +59:18 KBm? 10.3 7.3 x 6.4 - 83 4200: Cet dw 00:26.1 -11:02 dSph/E4 14.4 2800 NGC 147 00:33.2 +48:31 dE5 pec 9.5 15.0 x 9.4 + 89 2400 And III 00:35.4 +36:31 dSph/E2 13.5p 4.5 x 3.0 2900: NGC 185 00:39.0 +84:20 dE3 pec 9.2 14.5 x 12.5 + 39 2300 M110 00:41.3 +41:41 E5 pec 8.5 19.5 x 12.5 - 1 2900 And VIII 00:42.3 +40:37 dSph pec 9.1 45 x 10 -250 2700: M 32 00:42.7 +40:52 E2 (cE2) 8.1 11.0 x 7.3 + 35 2900 M 31 00:42.7 +41:16 SA(s)b I-II 3.4 185.0 x 75.0 - 59 2900 And I 00:45.7 +38:00 dSph/E3 pec ? 13.2 2.5 x 2.5 2900: SMC 00:51.7 -73:14 SB(s)m pec 2.3 280 x 160 - 30 210 And IX 00:52.9 +43:12 dSph 16.2 5 2900: Scl dw 01:00.0 -33:42 dSph/E3 pec 10.5p +162 300: LGS 3 01:03.8 +21:53 Irr 15.4p 2 3000: IC 1613 01:05.1 +02:08 IAB(s)m V 9.2 20.0 x 18.5 -125 2900: And X 01:06.6 +44:48 dSph 16.1 7 2900: And V 01:10.3 +47:38 dSph 15.9 2900: And II 01:16.4 +33:27 dSph/E0 13.5 3.6 x 2.5 2900: M 33 01:33.9 +30:39 SA(s)cd II-III 5.7 67.0 x 41.5 + 3 3000 Phe dw 01:51.1 -44:27 Irr 13.1 4.9 x 4.1 1600: For dw 02:39.9 -34:32 dSph/E2 8.1 12.0 x 10.2 500 UGCA 92 04:32.0 +63:36 Irr ?

Also, some of the galaxies are of extreme low surface brightness, and it was only recently possible to detect them. Therefore, it must be expected that more Local Group members exist, obscurred by dust, or extremely faint, and are still waiting for their detection somewhen in the future.\n\nJeff Bondono has compiled a comprehensive list of Local Group member and member candidate galaxies.\n\nLinks\n\nYou are invited to contribute more links which are of interest for this page; please contact the maintainer.\n\nLocal Group Galaxies, images and more information on all known certain and possible member galaxies as well as all former candidates, at SEDS Bill Arnett's table of Local Group galaxies (Lengthy) article on the Local Group by George Lake Mike Irwin's Local Group page and Local Group Member list Brian Skiff's list of Local Group galaxies (based on Sidney van den Bergh's article in PASP May 2000 issue) Local Group Galaxies table from NED (from Mateo 1998) Local Group Survey, by Phil Massey Based on High Resolution Images from the KPNO and CTIO 4-m telescopes.
