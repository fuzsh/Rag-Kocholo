It was first recognized by Hubble, in the time of the first distance determinations and redshift measurements.\n\nMessier objects: The Andromeda Galaxy M31 and its satellites M32 and M110, as well as the Triangulum galaxy M33.\n\nOther members (over 30 in all) include our Milky Way Galaxy, the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC), which have been known before the invention of the telescope, as well as several smaller galaxies which were discovered more recently. These galaxies are spread in a volume of nearly 10 million light years diameter, centered somewhere between the Milky Way and M31. Membership is not certain for all these galaxies, and there are possible other candidate members.\n\nOf the Local Group member galaxies, the Milky Way and M31 are by for the most massive, and therefore dominant members. Each of these two giant spirals has accumulated a system of satellite galaxies, where\n\nthe system of the Milky Way contains many (nearby) dwarf galaxies, spread all over the sky, namely Sag DEG, LMC, SMC, and the dwarf galaxies in Ursa Minor, Draco, Carina, Sextans (dwarf), Sculptor, Fornax, Leo I and Leo II,\n\nthe system of the Andromeda galaxy is seen from outside, and thus grouped around its main galaxy M31 in Andromeda, containing bright nearby M32 and M110 as well as fainter and more far-out NGCs 147 and 185, the very faint systems And I, And II, And III and possibly And IV (but for this one see remark below), And V, And VI (Pegasus dwarf), and And VII (Cassiopeia dwarf).\n\nThe third-largest galaxy, the Triangulum spiral M33, may or may not be an outlying gravitationally bound companion of M31, but has itself probably the dwarf LGS 3 as a satellite.\n\nThe other members cannot be assigned to one of the main subgroups, and float quite alone in the gravitational field of the giant group members. The substructures of the group are probably not stable. Observations and calculations suggest that the group is highly dynamic and has changed significantly in the past: The galaxies around the large elliptical Maffei 1 have probably been once part of our galaxy group.\n\nAs this shows, the Local Group is not isolated, but in gravitional interaction, and member exchange, with the nearest surrounding groups, notably:\n\nthe Maffei 1 group, which besides the giant elliptical galaxy Maffei 1 also contains smaller Maffei 2, and is associated with nearby IC 342. Highly obscurred by dark dust near the Milky Way's equatorial plane\n\nthe Sculptor Group or South Polar Group (with members situated around the South Galactic pole), dominated by NGC 253\n\nthe M81 group\n\nthe M83 group\n\nIn the future, interaction between the member galaxies and with the cosmic neighborhood will continue to change the Local Group. Some astronomers speculate that the two large spirals, our Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy, may perhaps collide and merge in some distant future, to form a giant elliptical. In addition, there is evidence that our nearest big cluster of galaxies, the Virgo Cluster, will probably stop our cosmological recession away from it, accelerate the Local Group toward itself so that it will finally fall and merge into this huge cluster of galaxies, see our Virgo Cluster & Local Group page.\n\nA table of the currently known Local Group member galaxies follows. While the positions are known very acurately, the distances are only very vaguely known for some members, and the sources even disagree for the most prominent members such as M31 and M33. If interested, look at our compilation of distances from various sources. Please note that this table is currently under review, as new data (Hipparcos distances, discovery of new members) keep our knowledge in flow.\n\nLocal Group Member Galaxies Galaxy RA Dec Type m_v dim RV Dist\n\nWLM 00:02.0 -15:28 IB(s) IV-V 10.9 12 x 4 - 42 4200\n\nIC 10 00:20.4 +59:18 KBm? 10.3 7.3 x 6.4 - 83 4200:\n\nCet dw 00:26.1 -11:02 dSph/E4 3000:\n\nNGC 147 00:33.2 +48:31 dE5 pec 9.5 15.0 x 9.4 + 89 2400:\n\nAnd III 00:35.4 +36:31 dSph/E2 13.5p 2900:\n\nNGC 185 00:39.0 +84:20 dE3 pec 9.2 14.5 x 12.5 + 39 2500:\n\nM110 00:41.3 +41:41 E5 pec 8.5 19.5 x 12.5 - 1 2900\n\nAnd IV 00:42.5 +40:34 Irr ? 2900:\n\nM 32 00:42.7 +40:52 E2 (cE2) 8.1 11.0 x 7.3 + 35 2900\n\nM 31 00:42.7 +41:16 SA(s)b I-II 3.4 185.0 x 75.0 - 59 2900\n\nAnd I 00:45.7 +38:00 dSph/E3 pec ? 13.2 2900:\n\nSMC 00:51.7 -73:14 SB(s)m pec 2.3 280 x 160 - 30 210\n\nScl dw 01:00.0 -33:42 dSph/E3 pec 10.5p +162 300:\n\nLGS 3 01:03.8 +21:53 Irr 15.4p 2 3000:\n\nIC 1613 01:05.1 +02:08 IAB(s)m V 9.2 20.0 x 18.5 -125 2900:\n\nAnd V 01:10.3 +47:38 dSph 2900:\n\nAnd II 01:16.4 +33:27 dSph/E0 13: 2900:\n\nM 33 01:33.9 +30:39 SA(s)cd II-III 5.7 67.0 x 41.5 + 3 3000\n\nPhe dw 01:49.0*-44:42* Irr 1600:\n\nFor dw 02:39.9 -34:32 dSph/E2 8. 530:\n\nUGCA 86 03:59.9 +67:08 Irr ?

Also, some of the galaxies are of extreme low surface brightness, and it was only recently possible to detect them. Therefore, it must be expected that more Local Group members exist, obscurred by dust, or extremely faint, and are still waiting for their detection somewhen in the future.\n\nJeff Bondono has compiled a comprehensive list of Local Group member and member candidate galaxies.\n\nLinks\n\nYou are invited to contribute more links which are of interest for this page; please email the maintainer.\n\nBill Arnett's table of Local Group galaxies (Lengthy) article on the Local Group by George Lake Mike Irwin's Local Group page and Local Group Member list Local Group Galaxies images and information at SEDS Local Group galaxy images from the Astronomical Picture of the Day archives 0bserving the Local Group by Tom Polakis; from Deep Sky Magazine #36.\n\nReferences\n\nTom Polakis has published an interesting article for observers of local group galaxies, Observing the Local Group, in the Deep Sky magazine (#36), which was reprinted in David Eicher's book Galaxies and the Universe.
