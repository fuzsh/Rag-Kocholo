        "text": "Back to Blog\n\nThe Ultimate List of Dog Friendly Wineries in Paso Robles\n\nDestination Drivers is the original designated driver service, providing 5-Star luxury hospitality in California Wine Country since 2010. With seven operations statewide, we conduct thousands of wine country tours every year giving us an extensive knowledge of the wineries in our service areas as well as travel routes, road construction, dining options, tourist highlights and more. Hire one of our drivers for your next wine country tour and let us help you plan your itinerary!\n\n•••••\n\nPlanning to Visit Dog Friendly Wineries in Paso Robles?\n\nWhile it is true that Paso Robles is a wonderful place to bring your dog, a little common courtesy and awareness will go a long way to ensure Fluffy and your winery stay friendly:\n\nKeep your dog leashed. Most dog-friendly wineries in Paso Robles will ask that dogs be kept on a leash at all times. This is for the safety of both your dog and other visitors to the winery.\n\nBring water and snacks for your dog. While some wineries provide water bowls for dogs, it’s always a good idea to bring your own water and a few snacks to keep them satisfied. As a courtesy, feeding and hydrating them outside would surely be appreciated.\n\nBe respectful of other visitors. Not everyone is a dog lover, and there are some whom are phobic, so, keep your dog close to you and under control at all times, being mindful of other visitors’ personal space.\n\nClean up after your dog. It’s critical to clean up after your dog, both inside and outside the winery. Bring a few bags with you and ensure that you account for their need for a bathroom break as far away from the tasting area as is reasonable, such as the parking lot.\n\nCall ahead if you aren’t certain the winery’s policy about dogs, your size dog etc. If you have hired a designated driver, check if they are OK with watching your dog while you are tasting.\n\nHandy List of Dog Friendly Wineries in Paso Robles\n\nPlease note* this list MAY not be 100% accurate as times and policies change. It never hurts to confirm with wineries ahead of time to be sure. Most of these are pulled from other Paso Robles travel websites, and a few from our direct experience. It is certain that this list can be added to as the Paso Robles wine map is large and ever-evolving. So, if a winery you hope to travel with your dog isn’t listed here, that does not necessarily mean they aren’t dog friendly. A dog-friendly tour company like Destination Drivers is happy to confirm these details for you if needed.\n\nAaron\n\nAbsolution Cellars\n\nAllegretto Wines\n\nAlta Colina Vineyard & Winery\n\nAmbyth Estate\n\nAnarchy Wine Co.\n\nAncient Peaks Winery\n\nArbuckle Ridge\n\nAsuncion Ridge Vineyards\n\nAustin Hope & Treana Tasting Cellar\n\nB & E Vineyard & Winery\n\nBarr Estate Winery\n\nBarton Family Wines\n\nBella Luna Estate Winery\n\nBethel Rd.
