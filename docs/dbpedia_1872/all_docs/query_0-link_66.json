        "text": "Greetings Exiles!\n\nHello and welcome to my 3.21 Crucible Cold Conversion Summoner, also known as the Ghazzy Zoomancer. His build is his own version of this build using most of the setup I'm already running. Due to time constraints I'm unable to fully update this buildguide and I've allowed Ghazzy to take my Zoomancer build making his own buildguide. You can find Ghazzy's Zoomaner on his PoE vault site and on youtube.\n\nI will be updating the rest of this buildguide in the future but due to the scope of the guide I don't have time right now. For 3.21 I am providing a thourough Path of Building of how I'm going to be running the Zoomancer and if you're intrested in my version you can find PoBs and bossing/mapping showcase videos in the spoiler for 3.21 below. The biggest difference between my and Ghazzy's version is that I prefer to run as an Occultist in the earlier parts of the game swapping to a Necromancer in the endgame while Ghazzy suggests running a Necromancer all the way since it's more beginner friendly and easier to follow. I do believe my version is far more efficient though.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nInformation for 3.21 Crucible League\n\n3.21:\n\nWelcome to the Crucible League!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not updating the entire buildguide for 3.21 due to time restrictions and will most likely do that for 3.22 instead. Ghazzy, a huge minion creator in the community learned about this build recently though and has created his own updated version of the build. So if you're interested in running a Cold Conversion Summoner(Zoomancer) you can check out his guide and Youtube video going through the build.\n\nGhazzy's Zoomancer:\n\nZoomancer Buildguide\n\nGhazzy Youtube Video\n\nHe does most of the things similar to me but there are some differences, especially during the leaguestart which is why I've decided to release a PoB for my version of the build if anyone is still intrested in how I'm running it. The biggest difference is that I now recommend everyone to run as an Occultist during league start. Getting Explosions from Profane Bloom just feels too good to pass on. I then suggest pivoting to Necro later on when the AG is setup. Since Ghazzy's buildguides are more for the general public he doesn't think it's a good idea to tell newer or inexperienced players to swap ascendencies so he runs Necromancer all the way.\n\nI agree with him, ascendence swapping creates alot of questions for new players. So I decided to leave this PoB out for more experienced players who're confident in their understanding in the game and will be able to swap Ascendencies later down the line.\n\nThe tradeoff running Occultist is that the mapping and clearing experience feels really good early on. We lose the ability to cap out block and Physical damage becomes a problem since you can't fit Determination. But I think it's worth it.\n\nVideos:\n\nVideos\n\n[3.20] Endgame version vs All Ubers:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x8HzxPQPEE&lc=Ugza2x4-B4CcyyQAsr14AaABAg.9oB--BVaz3s9oB2acXuxYL&ab_channel=HenrikSwanstr%C3%B6m\n\nIf you're interested in farming Ubers, here's a videoshowcase of an endgame version able to farm Uber bosses very comfortably. I'm not a bossrunner so I don't have too much Uber experience. Ubers are incredibly hard with alot of abilities that just are straight oneshots which kill you if you're mechanics are subpar like mine. To farm ubers you need to run Block which I'm running here. This is also a high budget version running a Mageblood.\n\n[3.20] Endgame version Mapping:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNXLyk4c-kI&t=1s&ab_channel=HenrikSwanstr%C3%B6m\n\nMapping showcase on high budget to show off the clearspeed. I don't think any other minion build comes remotely close to this level of clearspeed.\n\n[3.20] Low Budget Occultist Showcase:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWA2rN-LpuA&t=908s&ab_channel=HenrikSwanstr%C3%B6m\n\nLow budget showcase of the Occultist version clearing red maps\n\n[3.20] Very Low Budget Occultist Showcase:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWgIZAfvmX8&ab_channel=HenrikSwanstr%C3%B6m\n\nVery lowbudget version of the Occultist league starter from 3.20 with day2 items running some yellow maps.\n\n[3.21] Path of Building:\n\nPoB\n\nThis league I'm condensing all PoBs into a single one rather than having several different setups. This PoB will contain different setups based on how far you've come in your progression. This PoB includes:\n\n- Campaign to Maps setup:\n\nThis is the campaing and early leveling PoB. It includes skilltrees for all acts, skillgem setups for the early game(Act1-3) and later skillgem setups. It also includes a recommended Uniques setup in the gearing section.\n\n- White Maps Setup(Occultist):\n\nSkilltree, gearing and skillgem setup for early white maps.\n\n- Yellow Maps Setup:\n\nSkilltree, gearing and skillgem setup for Yellow maps.\n\nHere we opt out for the Bitterdreams and try to automize the build a bit more.\n\nAn option is to run a Lightning Coil chest instead of Doppleganger if the Doppleganger is too expensive or enough aren't on the market yet (Remember to 6-link items with Tainted Fusings).\n\n- Red Maps Setup (Occultist):\n\nThis is the final version of the Occultist version you'll run which should be able to do all Redmaps and most bossing content. This version starts stacking more defensive layers and damage allowing you to do endgame relatively comfortably. The focus on this version is getting a relatively cheap minion helm and fitting Determination with the Frontline combination.\n\n- Necromancer (Medium Budget):\n\nThis section focuses on the swap from Occultist to Necromancer. It's much better geared towards the endgame with higher damage and tankiness. It also contain more expensive gear in general. The point at which you want to swap from Occultist to Necromancer is when you got enough +1 to levels from your gear and have a the money to setup an Explodey AG removing the need for Profane Bloom from the Occultist Ascendency.\n\n- Necromancer (Lategame):\n\nRelatively High budget Necromaner version with much more expensive items.\n\nShould be able to do all content in the game except for Ubers which will require more investment and specific changes like Block.\n\n- Necromancer Endgame Version:\n\nNot yet implemented.\n\nYou can check out my 3.20 Endgame build to get an idea of how the build looks.\n\nThis version is very expensive and can do all content in the game. It's what I'm using in my Ubers showcase.\n\n[3.21] Crucible Complete PoB profile:\n\nhttps://pobb.in/HvaOtnIY4awU\n\n[3.20] My Sanctum Endgame PoB:\n\nhttps://pobb.in/EBCu-5ZxDls6\n\nHow to use it:\n\nSpoiler\n\nThis PoB has different setups for:\n\n- Skill Tree\n\n- Gem page\n\n- Gear\n\nHow you're supposed to use it is by matching the correct skilltree with the correct Gem setup and correct gear setup. You do this by filtering through the different setup options marked in these 3 images:\n\nSkill Tree:\n\nGem Setup:\n\nGear Setup:\n\nEvery setup should have the same name and be easy to navigate through. As an example, if you're looking for the Low Budget version, simply match the Skilltree, Gem and Gear setup all named [3.19] Low Budget. If you're in Act3 and need help with the setup, match the [3.19] Act3 (Campaign) setups together.\n\n[3.21] My League Start Atlas Tree:\n\nGood luck with your league start!\n\nDISCLAIMER: All 3.21 Crucible information will be posted in the spoiler above. Everything below this point concern previous leagues and due to the huge minion meta shakeup from Kalandra League, I'm not going to be updating the general buildguide for this league start. If you're still interested in this build for the upcoming challenge league, use the review the videos and download the Path of Building profiles provided above.\n\n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\n\n[3.13] Awakened9 Sirus\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTable of Content:\n\nI.

Additional Information\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nI. Introduction\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe premise of this build revolves around finding a happy medium between clearspeed and single target allowing us to swiftly defeat any encounter in the game. We utilize a high movementspeed, a completely automated low interaction playstyle with high throughput and enough tankiness for the build to feel good to play. Flasks are entirely automated with the new Instilling Orbs and most important aspects of the build are automated with triggers or the Numlock Trick leaving us with Dash and Convocation as our only abilities to press. The basics of the build is based around Ghazzy's pure spectre build and how to scale minions through converting pure physical damage to cold with the use of Triad grip gloves.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis build:\n\nAfter making massive changes in the 3.16 build apocalypse I'm certain we've come out stronger than ever. While our dps numbers will never rival that of 3.13 before the massive nerfageddon to support gems in 3.15 and removal of pre-nerf harvest crafting we are still able to achieve enough dps to oneshot all content in the game except for specific Uber bosses. The biggest changes is that we're now a pretty tanky build as well as boasting over a 100 million dps for the minmaxed version.\n\nThe biggest changes though is for the lower ends where the low budget version of the build comfortably can do content like juiced up The Feared rotations. My new low budget version is even able to do full 30-wave simulacrums if played properly. (You can read more about the lower budget options in the low budget section of the guide)\n\nThe purpose of this build is to be a highly versatile build that can do everything in the game. Be it Bossing, mapping, Deep Delve, various forms of AFK farming et.c. To obvious downside is that it turns to a jack of all trades kind of build that can do everything but doesn't really excell at anything.\n\nAt higher budgets it's an excellent bosser but will never rival something like a minmaxed bossing build with billions of dps. Even if we can kill Sirus in 1 second there will always be minmaxed builds like trappers or Generals Cry builds that do it in 0.3 seconds. This build is still a strong mapper, but unfortunately never will come close to dedicated mapping builds designed around having 30+ Headhunter stacks scaling clearspeed with screen wide explodey mods and a billion projectiles. We happily sit somewhere in the middle being able to do everything but not excelling at anything.\n\nThe strength aside from our versatility predominantly lies in how easy the build is to play. My goal always is to make my build as simple to play as possible minimizing the amount of button inputs required. In the beginning of the build you will be pressing alot more skills since we don't have access to the more high end budget items. But as the build progress most of it will go away leaving us with very few abilities to maintain. This allows you to focus more on just dodging abilities and picking up loot while constantly being on the run.\n\nIf you follow this build through to the end you can expect to:\n\n- Comfortably clear all content in the game\n\n- Clear the hardest bosses and Maven invitations\n\n- Farm full wave-30 Simulacrums (Afkable up to wave 23ish)\n\n- Deep Delve past 1000 depth\n\n- Farm 100% delirius maps\n\n- Have enough clearspeed fullclear things like Legions\n\n- AFK fully juiced T16 normal Blighted Maps\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nII. Pros and Cons\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPROS:\n\nPros\n\n- Extremely strong league starter with massive dps and tankiness on a low budget.\n\n- Fast mapper and excellent bossfarmer.\n\n- Clears all the content in the game.\n\n- Great bosser due to high dps and tankiness\n\n- Very flexible build. It's easy to move certain parts around for more tankiness, dps or speed if you want to.\n\n- Easy to play. Only press mobility abilities and summon Skeletons.\n\n- Mostly automated build. Curses, Offerings and Debuffs are applied entirely through triggers which allows you to focus on positioning.\n\n- Heavy reliance on movespeed which makes dodging abilities and clearing smooth and easy.\n\n- Endless scaling, you're never done with the build.\n\nCONS:\n\nCons\n\n- When Molten Shell is down we're vulnerable so you have to keep that in mind.\n\n- Can be pricey during league start due to the price of primordial Jewels early on. The prices of these jewels taper off though.\n\n- This build has alot of chase items once you've finished the medium budget version like 8-link helmets, +2 trigger wands and Elemental Equilibrium Skin of the Lords.\n\n- Very hard to minmax, especially hitting the 160 Dex requirement and all resistances while keeping your EHP and damage modifiers high enough. It's a very finetuned build.\n\n- Due to the 25% reduced health nerf to Minion Damage Support Golems and Zombies can get shotgunned at lower budgets. Especially annoying on bosses like Veritania early on.\n\n- Endless scaling, you're never done with the build.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nIII.

It has level 17 gems, a tabula rasa and some other very cheap uniques. This is how the build should be looking when you first get to white maps. Still able to clear T16 maps, although a bit slow.\n\nAll Path of Buildings:\n\nPoB\n\n[3.18] Campaign & Leveling PoB:\n\n- Frost Auto-scouts: https://pastebin.com/VMSwDGSv\n\nThis PoB is intended to bring you from the start of the game into mapping. Having this setup it's possible to do red maps but it will probably feel pretty slow so I suggest that you upgrade to the next PoB which increases dps tenfold.\n\n[3.18] White Maps PoB:\n\n- Frost Auto-scouts: https://pastebin.com/WhwvALKZ\n\nThis PoB is for the player who has just finished the campaign and is looking to polish their gear and links for starting their mapping journey. This is basically a starter kit for white maps. It is able to do A8 red maps but this PoB assumes underleveled gems and extremely cheap league start items.\n\n[3.18] Yellow Maps PoB:\n\n- Primal Crushclaws: https://pastebin.com/dkayMu5h\n\nThis PoB act as a intermediary between your whitemaps setup and the eventual low budget setup that's able to clear most content in the game.\n\nWhile going through this stage, the biggest change is changing Spectres from Autoscouts to Crushclaws and going full Cold Conversion with Triad Grips.\n\n[3.18] Low budget PoB:\n\n- Primal Crushclaw Setup(Normal Version): https://pastebin.com/ZKLx27vw\n\n- Hyrri's Watch Setup(Ranged Spectres): https://pastebin.com/w4KQJ4tk\n\n- Tanky Setup: https://pastebin.com/A37Txc3Y\n\nThe lowbudget PoBs are intended to be the base of the build which I base everything around. This version is able to clear almost all content in the game, including Maven Invitations and getting deep into late simulacrum waves. For people who want to be tankier, there's an alternte tanky setup available that sacrifices DPS for huge amounts of survivability. The shield cost of the defensive version brings up the cost by a couple exalted orbs.\n\nSpoiler\n\n[3.18] Medium budget PoB:\n\n- Primal Crushclaws https://pastebin.com/JFPNvhUU\n\nThe medium budget version contains several higher ticket items in the range of +15 ex each. This version is for people who want to works towards steamrolling the endgame with ridiculous dps and minion clearspeed.\n\nThe estimated cost of this version is fairly high.\n\n[3.18] High budget PoB:\n\n- Primal Crushclaws https://pastebin.com/JQUwiRfm\n\nThis is the true endgame and finished version of the build.\n\nThe version in this PoB utilizes very high end gear worth several Mirror of Kalandras worth of currency.\n\nIf you don't have Path of Building community fork on your computer, download it here: https://pathofbuilding.community/\n\nBeginner instructions to PoB:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPGs1jkHatE\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nIV. General Build Mechanics\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nMechanics\n\nOffensive capabilities, mechanics and scaling:\n\nOffence\n\nSingle Target:\n\nPrimary scaling of the build is done with the Summon Carrion Golem skill gem and Summon Skeletons. This is where the majority of our single target damage comes from. We funnel majority of our single target damage into both these minions letting them share the strongest linked item we got.\n\nAt lower budget versions of the build we will be linking the Skeletons together with the Golems in a Skin of the Lords chestpiece. The combination of having them in this type of chest effectively allows them to act as x2 6-linked minions rather than one 7-linked one. The +2 from Skin of the Lords and +1 levels from Awakened minion damage gives a total of +3 levels which is the same as an Empower4 support gem. This is why having them share the links in a chest causes both of them to be pseudo 6-linked.\n\nAt higher budgets, meaning mirror tier helm levels, the minion helm becomes the clear stronger option for our primary minions and we migrate the skeletons and Golems into the helm instead.\n\nSecondary Minions:\n\nSecondaryMinions\n\nOur secondary minions are mainly there for support in damage and clear speed. During earlier itterations of the build you will be running these minions in a classic minion helm. The purpose of these minions are to assist buff our entire army with Feeding Frenzy, increase boss damage taken through the use of Primal Crushclaw Screech abilities and to aid with clear speed where Golems and Skeletons are lacking.\n\nPrior to patch 3.16 Scourge League Syndicate Operatives were the only support minion we needed since they had unparalleled clearspeed and their single target was unrivaled due to their ability to shotgun with Increased Projectile support gems. This has changed though and we've had to get creative with which our secondary minions are supposed to be. This has lead us to create two different setups, one which is more focused on map clearing and one which has better single target:\n\nHyrri's Watch & Phantasms:\n\nThis is the stronger map clearing setup since it utilizes ranged spectres scaling higher projectile numbers. When running these minions clearspeed is mainly done by both the Hyrri's Watch and the phantasms with their inherent piercing long range projectiles. This setup runs x3 Hyrri's Watch and an added Primal Crushclaw for the 50% increased cold damage taken screech it does which is invaluable for single target.\n\nHow to obtain Hyrri's Watch Spectres:\n\nSpoiler\n\nHyrri's Watch spectres are obtained from Kraui Legion armies. To raise them, just create a map with a Legion Scarab and be on the look for Karui Armies which are the orange ones.\n\nThe Hyrri's Watch spectres look like female bowmen shooting ice projectiles. When you kill one of them you have to be really fast with raising it because the corpse despawns in ~2 seconds. To make sure you're able to raise it before it despawns I suggest that you despawn all your passive minions like Zombies, Golems or Spectres so you can control what you kill. After you've released a Karui army from stasis, run away from the freed army and unequip all passive minions. Then go back to the army and use skeletons to control which monsters you kill to make sure you can raise Hyrri's Watch corpses before they despawn.\n\nPrimal Crushclaws & Zombies:\n\nThis setup is much stronger and consistent for single target. Crushclaws and Zombies simply do more single target than the ranged counterparts and running x4 Crushclaws is far more consistent against bosses for keeping the Screech Ability up. The downsides are obvious though. These are all melee minions which means their clearspeed is inferior. To solve this we have to get creative. When running with Crushclaws and Zombies you want to scale minion AoE by speccing into Fearsome Force in the skilltree. We combine this with running Melee Splash support gems and most clearing issues are solved.\n\nAs a cherry on top, we also run an Inpulsa chestpiece on our Animate Guardian which gives us an explodey mod to our build. With all these things combined the build has very respectable clearspeed. Still worse than running Phantasms and Hyrri's Watch though.\n\nHow to obtain Primal Crushclaw Spectres:\n\nSpoiler\n\nTo obtain Primal Crushclaw spectres can only be obtained through soloplay through the use of Harvest plots in maps.\n\nBlue Harvest plots may contain Primal Crushclaw Blubs which when harvest, will spawn a Primal Crushclaw. After defeating it, quickly use Raise Spectre on it since the corpse despawns after ~2 seconds.\n\nOther Minions:\n\nOtherMinions\n\nThis build runs several different support minions which fill key roles in the overall picture of the build.\n\nPrimal Crushclaws:\n\nPrimal crushclaws or 'crabs' as they're commonaly known are a massive addition to any cold conversion build. On they're own they're a decent spectre with pretty good damage and clearspeed. They have a big Slam attack they do which is good for clearspeed and a charge attack to solve with mobility issues. But the primary reason we want to use them is because of their Screech ability called Frigid Roar.\n\nThis ability is a large AoE screech which causes all monsters hit by it to take 50% increased cold damage. The effect of this screech alone is more powerful than adding the strongest Awakened Support gem to any of our minions. The Screech ability has a 6 second duration and a 12 second cooldown though making it somewhat inconsistent to rely on. That's why running more of them makes the debuff application much more consistent, especially if their timings are disjointed from oneanother.\n\nAnimate Guardian:\n\nThe Animate Guardian is one of the strongest part of a minion build and a well built one can almost double your dps if you invest well into it. In our build we use the Animate Guardian to vastly increase our single target and clear speed through the gear we choose to give him.\n\nFrenzy & Power Gorillas:\n\nAt higher budgets when we're using Minimum power and Frenzy charge shields an option is to run charge monkeys to ensure we have the maximum number of 3 charges for our minions consistently. Power charges at this level is especially powerful. When we're using Victario's Charity shield though, this is not necessary since Victario's already provide 3 of each charge during general mapping.\n\nScaling Mechanics:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the mandatory scaling is predominantly done through scaling Cold damage through the Hatred Aura skill gem combined with Triad Grips gloves. By combining these two items we effectively allow our minions to doubledip their damage by focusing on physical damage that. The physical damage is then converted into cold damage and which is further amplified by the Hatred Aura. Majority of the actual damage is scaled by introdcuing Hatred Aura effect into the build.\n\nPower Charge and Frenzy Charge generation:\n\nFrenzy and Power charges are a key component to how we scale the damage of the build. I cannot stress the importance of charges enough for minion builds since minions get a 200% increase effect of Charges. That's why we always want to have charges up on our minions. We get these through the use of Necromantic Aegis.\n\nBlade Vortex:\n\nThis build utilizes Blade Vortex as our primary means to spread and apply debuffs on monsters in a completely automated fashion.\n\nThis is done by equipping a BV skillgem in our wand allowing it to automatically trigger whenever we cast another spell. The mechanics are simple:\n\nWhen we cast Phase Run or Dash it will automatically trigger Blade Vortex. Blade Vortex which allows us to permenantly have BV up around us. This causes BV to behave as a pseudo mini aura which applies everything we modify it with like Curses and Elemental Equilibrium.\n\nCurses:\n\nThis is a Curse reliant build and we scale the build through the use of negative resistance applications done to our enemies. This is done through the use of 2 curses predominantly: Frostbite and Elemental Weakness for the higher end versions. Early on we instead run Assassin's Mark to boost Single Target. Since GGG removed Assassin's Mark on Hit as a modifier from rings we can only play with Assassin's Mark via Self-casting.\n\nIn the beginning we can only afford 1 curse for the build, but later on we get our second Elemental Weakness curse by gearing our Animate Guardian with proper items.\n\nDefensive capabilities:\n\nDefenses\n\nWhere this build really shines is in the dps department. This is done by running four different multi-linked minions at the same time and by granting Power & Frenzy Charges for them by sacrificing the defensive properties of our Shield. This undoubly leads to some pretty drastic sacrifices in defenses, but we counteract this by adding High armour and extremely juiced Molten Shells. Higher budget versions even incoroprate Evasion for further physical damage mitigation and we can always sacrifice some dps to cap block if we want even more tankiness.\n\nPrimary Defenses:\n\nYour primary source of defense basically is your life Pool, your maximum resistances and Molten Shell. We always try to aim for ~4.5k health. The more you can get the better. I've personally found that 4k life is enough to feel safe at most times.\n\nResistances must always be capped at 75%, especially all three elemental resistances. Chaos resistance can be capped as an afterthought. It's nice to get but not as essential. I always cap out Chaos resistance later on in the league through items like rings/boots. Think of Chaos resistance as a luxury. The game is very playable with Chaos resistance in the negatives but can open you up to random oneshots and nasty poison stacks at times.\n\nMolten Shell is probably the most important primary defense we run in this build. Since we're scaling alot of Armour we get Molten Shells absorbing over 6k health effectively doubling our effective healthpool when it's up. A key component to scaling our defenses also lie in The Frontline small cluster jewel.\n\nThis adds the Veterans Awareness noteable to the build which increases maximum elemental resistances by 10% and reduces physical damage taken by 20% while Molten Shell is up. The downside is that these bonuses are lost when you lose Molten Shell and you instead take 20% increased damage while Molten Shell is down.\n\nTo combat this downside we're scaling alot of Duration in the build bringing our Molten Shell up to over 10 seconds. We can also bring down the cooldown of Molten shell to 3.33 seconds giving it a very respectable uptime. By utilizing the Numlock Trick for Molten Shell we're able to autocast Molten Shell keeping it up consistently almost all the time.\n\nSecondary Layers of Defense:\n\nAvoidance&Armour\n\nSecondary Layers of Defense:\n\nTo drastically increase our survivability we implement several layers of defense through the use of stacking multipile avoidance mechanics and Armour ontop of eachothers. This includes Evasion and Block mechanics. Alot of this survivability is centered around the Skin of the Lords chestpiece.\n\nEvasion:\n\nAt higher budgets we're using 2 sources of Evasion to help aid us against Physical hits. This includes a Jade Flask for 1500 additional Evasion and the Vaal Grace Aura. Stacking these together and adding the 100% global defense modifier from Skin of the Lords allows us to get 85% Evasion for a very low investment with Vaal Grace and flasks up.\n\nKeep in mind that lower budget versions can't afford to invest into Evasion.\n\nArmour and Physical Damage Reduction:\n\nA second layer of defense against physical damage is achieved by stacking Armour and pure phys damage mitigation. This is done by running Determination coupled with Granite Flasks like Rumis. If we want to be extra tanky we run Basalt Flask aswell which allows us to reach over 40k armour. These armour values gives us Molten Shells absorbing over 8000 damage. Coupled with the 20% phys dmg mitigation from The Frontline we become quasi immortal to physical damage.\n\nSpell and Attack Block(Optional):\n\nBlock\n\nPeople who prefer to play tankier versions of the build can choose to invest into block which drastically supercharges defensive layers to the moon.\n\nWe've already got alot of physical damage mitigation due to our high armour. The Frontline also gives us 85% max resistances protecting us against elemental damage. On top of that we have massive Molten Shells which almost never will break to damage. Ontop of that we're including block cap through the use of Bone Offering, Tempest Shield and a Life on Block Shield.\n\nSpoiler\n\n- Tanky Low Budget PoB: https://pastebin.com/A37Txc3Y\n\nAs mentioning earlier, anyone who wants to cap block wants to run Tempest Shield in the build for a passive ~25% spell block. We're also using Divergent Bone Offering combined with Rumis Concoction and some block nodes in the tree to entirely cap out our block.\n\nThe biggest sacrifice here, as mentioned earlier is the loss of Necromantic Aegis which drastically lowers damage output. Instead, we run a %life on block shield with increased mana reservation to make sure we still can fit Tempest Shield in the aura setup.\n\nEndurance Charges(Optional):\n\nAn option we have to stack even more defensive layers is to run x4 Endurance Charges in the build. To achieve this we run a small Armour Cluster with Enduring Composure which gives us Endurance Charges when we take damage. We can also run Enduring Cry for even stronger Endurance Charges but this requires sacrificing a gem in your gear. The cast time of Enduring Cry makes it feel somewhat clunky to cast though.\n\nMobillity:\n\nSpoiler\n\nIn patch 3.15 the mobility of all builds were nerfed across the board. This was done in several steps by nerfing mobility gems and removing several sources of movement speed from the game.\n\nEven if mobility is nerfed, we're still trying to maximize it because additional runspeed is one of the most important modifiers allowing us to run more maps per hour. Runspeed is acquired to the build through several sources. This includes a Quicksilver Flask, running a Silver Flask for Onslaught and getting as much movement speed from our boots as possible. On top of this, we also stack Phase Run and for higher budgets, a Headhunter. This allows for some ridiculous movement speeds. Flesh Offering is also a valuable option during maps for increased clearspeed. Running Flesh Offering sacrifices block though which might result in occasional Deaths.\n\nIn 3.15 Dash and Second Wind was nerfed severely.. It won't feel as good as before, but simply means we'll have to rely more on Phase Run and actual running rather than spamming Dash. A second option for better mobility would be to have the Uber Lab enchant that provides +2 Charges to Dash on your helm. This gives you 3 total charges on Dash which allows us to run Enhance4 in our Gloves giving us more movement speed on Phase Run and shorter cooldown on Dash.\n\n3.14 Footage\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nV. Skill Point Allocations and Other\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTree&Points\n\nSkilltree and Point Allocation:\n\nSkilltree\n\nKeep in mind that all skill trees uses Cluster Jewels and a medium sized Thread of Hope so some of the points in the actual build cannot be allocated on PoB planner.\n\n[3.18] Low Budget Skill Tree:\n\nhttps://poeplanner.com/b/Znf\n\n[3.18] Medium Budget Skill Tree:\n\nhttps://poeplanner.com/b/ZnV\n\n[3.18] High Budget Skill Tree:\n\nhttps://poeplanner.com/b/Z1L\n\nAscendancy, Bandits, Annointments and Pantheon:\n\nAscendancy\n\nAscendancy:\n\n#1. Commander of Darkness\n\nThis is the first point we allocate because it provides much needed Resistances and damage to the build. Also provides +30% to all elemental resistances to your minions which is mandatory to keep your things alive.\n\n#2. Mindless Aggression\n\nSimple point that provides some nice damage bonuses to the build and some minion life which helps with minion survivability.\n\n#3. Unnatural Strength\n\nThis point provides +2 to all minion skill levels which is a massive boost. This means that it provides 2 additional levels to all skills with the \"minion\" tag. This includes skill gems like Flesh Offering, Minion Damage Support, Convocation et.c.\n\nI can't stress enough how important additional skill level is to minion builds. It's basically a 10% more damage multiplier for each level and also provides alot of additional health to all your minions.\n\n#4. Mistress of Sacrifice\n\nIn the past we used to run Bone Barrier but since the build is now more focused on stacking Duration, boosting our Offering skills and running extremely juiced up Molten Shells Bone Barrier basically becomes useless for us. For this reason, Mistress of Sacrifie is the clear and obvious choice as it provides us with 50% increased duration. It also allows us to either cap our Spell Block which is necesarry for harder content or run Flesh Offering for a boost in movement speed effectively increasing your clearspeed in maps.\n\nElementalist:\n\nSpoiler\n\nFor very high budget versions of the build the Elementalist Ascendency is stronger than the Necromancer one so we respecc away from Necromancer.\n\nKeep in mind that this only is for very geared characters.\n\nThe benefit of the Elementalist in the Lategame is more damage, more defenses and alot of passive health regeneration due to adding a Stone Golem to the build.\n\nBandits\n\nNothing special here, we simply kill all 3 bandits to recieve 2 additional skill points. This build craves skill points so we need to get every point possible.\n\nAnnointments:\n\nFor anointments we run Charisma to help with Aura mana reservation. This is however a pretty expensive anointment so if you're on a budget, you can instead run Death Attunement. This will disable you from running all auras though.\n\nCharisma:\n\nIf you don't have the money for Charisma, consider running Death Attunement.\n\nSpoiler\n\nDeath Attunement:\n\nRings:\n\nWhen it comes to ring Anoints I did alot of testing in 3.17 and the absolute best setup I could come up with is this:\n\nBurning Ground:\n\nThis causes meteors fired from your Meteor tower to leave a burning ground effect on the ground. One of the main issues with Meteor Towers is that they try to target moving monsters. During the time the meteor is channeling, some monsters will already have gone out of the AoE when it hits the ground.\n\nThe Burning Ground lingers for enough time to wipe out almost all trash monsters though. Another huge benefit is that the Burning Ground damages Fire Immune targets which is why this tower is so strong for AFK blight farming.\n\nDouble Meteor:\n\nNot much to say regarding this anointment. Double meteors results in double damage pretty much. This anoint is what allows you to basically oneshot Blighted bosses with a single Meteor tower. It's absolutely disgusting.\n\nPantheon\n\nGenerally I always use one primary setup overall. might swap points potentially.\n\nMajor Pantheon:\n\n- Soul of Bring King: If you don't have freeze immunity on your boots this pantheon is mandatory.\n\n- Soul of Lunaris: Once you've gotten higher budget boots with Freeze immunity Soul of Lunaris becomes the best option to run. It gives you immunity to chained projectiles, some increased phys dmg reduction and movement speed while mapping aswell as other benefits.\n\nMinor Pantheons:\n\n- Soul of Abberath: If you don't have Ignite immunity, run this pantheon. The 60% reduced ignite duration gives us quasi ignite mitigation.\n\n- Soul of Shakari: Provides some chaos damage mitigation and protection against poisons which is very valuable if chaos resistance is in the negatives.\n\n- Soul of Tukohama: This pantheon provides 9% phys dmg mitigation and 2% life regen when we stand still. I use this for AFK blighted maps.\n\n- Soul of Yugul: Very useful pantheon. Combine it with a rare anti reflect ring and we can run elemental reflect map mods in case we mess up our map rolling or we want to run Uber Atziri.\n\nLast edited by Deadandlivin on Apr 7, 2023, 5:11:30 PM\n\nLast bumped on Apr 11, 2024, 8:47:50 PM\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nVI.

Make sure to get a lvl 21 gem fast.\n\n- Vaal Summon Skeletons: lvl 21 gem is a priority.\n\n- Increased Critical Damage Support The biggest multiplier we can find. Normal version adds 148% Critical strike Multiplier.\n\n- Awakened Multistrike: Very high dmg multiplier.\n\nIf you're on a budget:\n\nGet a 21/0 Carrion Golem gem and the non awakened versions of the support gems.\n\nDisclaimer: In my 3.18 PoBs I'm running Melee Splash for both single target and clear. This is because the unintended interaction of Melee Splash cleaving on Hydrosphere still is possible cause of a balance oversight. Since it will be removed in the future, I'm not including Melee Splash in my links in the forum guide but a different support gem instead. You can read more about this interaction in IV. General Build Mechanics -> Offensive Capabilities. To make I clear, follow the PoB links. The links listed here is intended for when this interaction is later removed.\n\nChest - Spectre setup for AoE clear:\n\nThis is our secondary damage link containing the either Primal Crushclaws & Zombies linked together or Hyrri's Watch & Phantasms.\n\nMy Links:\n\nPrimal Crushclaws & Zombies:\n\nAnomalous Raise Spectre - Awakened Minion Damage - Raise Zombies - Awakened Elemental Damage with Attacks - Awakened Melee Physical Damage Support - Awakened Multistrke Damage Support\n\n- Raise Spectre: Since we're running Primal Crushclaws the Anomalous version of the gem the best version.\n\n- Raise Zombies: I personally prefer running 21/20 normal Zombies for the added life and movement speed. Phantasmal Zombies provide higher dps though.\n\n- Awakened Minion Damage: One of the biggest damage multipliers. At level 5 it also grants +1 to socketed minion levels which is very strong.\n\n- Awakened Melee Physical Damage: A big multiplier but more importantly, also adds intimidate to the build which increases physical damage taken by 10%. This is converted into cold damage meaning a flat 10% increased damage boost to the build.\n\n- Awakened Multistrike: Simply the strongest multiplier for the build.\n\n- Awakened Elemental Damage with Attacks: Also one of the strongest multiplier for the build. Divergent Predator would be a dps increase if you can bother to mark enemies.\n\nIf you're on a budget, get 21/0 Raise spectre and simply 20/20 of the non awakened versions of the gem.\n\nAlternative support gems:\n\nAlternatives\n\nDivergent Melee Splash:\n\nFor increased clearspeed during mapping or against content with alot of density swapping out Multistrike for Melee Splash makes huge difference.\n\nDisclaimer: In my 3.18 PoBs I'm running Melee Splash for both single target and clear. This is because the unintended interaction of Melee Splash cleaving on Hydrosphere still is possible cause of a balance oversight. Since it will be removed in the future, I'm not including Melee Splash in my links in the forum guide but a different support gem instead. You can read more about this interaction in IV. General Build Mechanics -> Offensive Capabilities. To make I clear, follow the PoB links. The links listed here is intended for when this interaction is later removed.\n\nWeapon - Trigger setup:\n\nThe wand contains our primary method for spreading curses and other debuffs. A key component for this build to work is through the use of a crafted trigger wand which allows for all socketed skill gems to be casted automatically when we use Dash or Phase Run. We also run Bone Offering and Tempest Shield in here aswell.\n\nMy Links:\n\nBladevortex - Divergent Flesh Offering - Determination\n\n- Bladevortex: We use the normal BV because it gives additional Area of effect to the skill. 20/23 gem is enough because the skill recieves +1 from a proper trigger wand which adds +1 additional weapon range compared to a basic level 20 BV.\n\n- Divergent Flesh Offering: The Divergent version of the gem provides even more attack speed and is a large dps bonus.\n\n- Determination: Determination is put in the wand cause we have nowhere else to put it.\n\nShield - Skitterbots + Convocation:\n\nIn our shield we simply link our Skitterbots with Bone Chill and Convocation. Keep in mind that Bonechill and Skitterbots absolutely have to be linked together.\n\nMy Links:\n\nDivergent Summon Skitterbots - Divergent Bonechill Support - Anomalous Convocation\n\n- Divergent Skitterbots: We choose to use Divergent skitterbots as it ads 10% increased effect of the shock and chill provided by them. This basically translates into more damage compared to other skitterbot alternatives.\n\n- Divergent Bonechill: Divergent Bonechill causes targets chilled by abilities linked by bonechill, meaning skitterbots, to have a 10% increased chill effect. This basically empowers to slow effect of your skitterbots slows. Appears to not increase damage according to PoB so only has an effect on the chill slow, not the chill effect.\n\n- Anomalous Convoation: It's either this or normal convocation. Anomalous provides our minions with 40% additional movespeed which increases the mobility of our minions. Normal convocation gives 20% increased CDR which also is decent if you find yourself pressing Convocation alot. Ashes of the Stars increases this bonus to 100% movement speed on our minions.\n\nBonechill and Skitterbots Interaction:\n\nInteraction\n\nReading these two skills it's very hard to understand how they interact and how our damage actually is increased. I'll try to explain it as best I can.\n\nSkitterbots provides us with two bots, one that shocks and one that chills.\n\nThese bots have an Aura around themselves which permenantly shocks and chills anyone close to both of them.\n\nhttps://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Summon_Skitterbots\n\nAs you can see by the provided link, skitterbots have a baseline chill effect of 10% and a baseline shock effect of 15%.\n\nThese numbers are multiplied by our effect of chill and effect of shock which we can find on our skitterbots details description.\n\nAs you can see from the image I've provided it tells us that My personal skitterbots provide +107% chill effectiveness and +33% shock effectiveness. We simply use these numbers and multiply them with the base chill and shock of our skitterbots.\n\nEffect of Shock = Baseline Shock Effect * Shock Effectiveness = 15 * 1.33 = 19.95 = 20% shock effect.\n\nThis translates into a straight up 20% damage multiplier to all enemies close to the shocking bot.\n\nEffect of Chill = Baseline Chill * Chill effectiveness = 10 * 2.07 = 20.7 = 21% chill effect. Now this doesn't provide any damage buff alone. 21% chill effect basically means that all enemies close to the chilling bot has 21% reduced movement and attack speed.\n\nThe magic comes from our Bonechill support which reads:\n\n\"Enemies Chilled by Supported Skills have Cold Damage taken increased by Chill Effect.\n\nEnemies in Chilling Areas from Supported Skills have Cold Damage taken increased by Chill Effect.\"\n\nOur skitterbots has a chilling area around them caused by the aura they provide. Bonechill causes all enemies within this area to take additional cold damage based on the chill effect it provides. It provides 21% chill effect which translates into 21% additional damage taken.\n\nGloves - Mobility Setup:\n\nAll mobility abilities in the build are linked together in the gloves since they all hve green colors.\n\nMy Links:\n\nPhase Run - Divergent Dash - Second Wind - Vaal Grace\n\n- Divergent Dash: Our gapcloser/creater. Used to get out of dangerous AoE effects or away from enemies or to close the gap. I personally like to initiate combat by dashing into enemies and convocating my minions ontop of them. Dash triggers all our wand gemlinks aswell. Running Divergent dash for permanent Phasing is the optimal choice. Even if Phase Run provides phasing it will be down alot of the time. This gem alone ensures 100% uptime on phasing and is the best solution for clowny dashes into large packs where you might otherwise get bodyblocked.\n\n- Phase Run: One of our primary mobility skills. Provides us with a massive movement speed buff and phasing. We basically want to press this ability off cooldown. Run this on your left mouse button to press it off cooldown.\n\n- Second Wind: We run second wind to grant our dash 2 charges. It increases the fluidity of the build alot. Make sure it's only linked to Dash and no other gem in the gloves. Reason is because it has a big mana multiplier which otherwise increases the manacost of Phase Run or Grace without adding anything. Second Wind linked to Grace increases the mana so much that you can't use it either.\n\n- Vaal Grace: For an additional defensive layer we run Vaal Grace in the build. Coupled with a Jade Flask and Skin of the Lords it allows us to reach close to Evasion cap to help against physical damage.\n\nAlternatively you can run Vaal Haste instead which opens up for increased clearspeed and higher dps. However, it makes you more vulnerable to physical damage while mapping.\n\nBoots - Aura + Utility:\n\nThe boots has our Hatred Aura and Molten Shell linked together.\n\nMy Links:\n\nHatred - Awakened Generosity Support - Molten Shell - Increased Duration Support\n\n- Hatred: One of our primary tools for scaling our damage. We use the normal version of Hatred which gives it a bigger AoE so it covers our minions better.\n\n- Awakened Generosity Support: Causes hatred to grant a bigger buff to our minions, have a bigger AoE and also gives it 1 additional level. If you're poor, start of with normal generosity.\n\n- Molten Shell: Molten Shell adds a tremendous defensive layer to the build, especially when combined with a The Frontline small cluster jewel. We want to have as close to 100% uptime on this as possible. To do so we invest into increased duration for it and use the Numlock trick on it to effectively autocast it off cooldown. We run normal Molten Shell for better uptime.\n\n- Increased Duration: Its only purpose is to extend the duration of Molten Shell.\n\nRing1 - Animate Guardian:\n\nThis build requires additional sockets from Unset Rings. In here we put our Animate Guardian. In 3.17 I've started to use a Hungry Loop ring for our Animate Guardian to save up on socket slots in our gear. This allows our AG to be far tankier, frees up Feeding Frenzy from our secondary minions and increase his Area of Effect for massive clearspeed advantages due to how large his Explosions from his gear will be.\n\nMy Links:\n\nAnomalous Animate Guardian\n\n- Anomalous Animate Guardian: Our Animate Guardian will have an entirely own section. For the skillgem the priority is to get a level 21 animate guardian gem forthmost. If you got currency to spare, try to find a level 21/20 Anomalous Animate Guardian. These gems are very rare and pretty expensive. The Anomalous Animate Guardian gives him 60% increased Area of Effect. This synergizes very well with his equipped explodey giving him 60% larger explosions when enemies die. Against harder high density content like 100% delirius maps or wave 30 Simulacrums the explosions also inflict Elemental Weakness in an AoE which increases clear speed further. Items like Ashes of the Stars increase his AoE by an additional 90%.\n\nRing2 - Optional:\n\nThe last socket slot in our gear is highly variable and depends on what type of budget your currently at. In my high budget version, I'm running an Elementalist version of the build so I'm using a Stone Golem here to massively boost my Health Regen. This gives me 1300 passive HP regen and also allows me to run a Bottled Faith instead of a life flask.\n\nOther options to put here include Assassin's Mark, Hydrosphere or Tempest Shield. It all depends on what you want to do with the build.\n\nIf you're running Assassin's Mark, you want to use the regular version as it allows your minions to get the last third Power Charge. Divergent Tempest Shield provides additional spell block if you decide to build a block version of the build. Anomalous Hydrosphere gives it increased cast speed so there's less friction when using it.\n\nMy Links:\n\nAnomalous Stone Golem\n\n- Stone Golem: I run an Anomalous Stone Golem to drastically increase my Health Regen as an Elementalist.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nVII. Gearing and Item Acquisition\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nGear and Equipment:\n\nEquipment\n\nMy 3.17 Gear:\n\nMinmaxed Gear:\n\nSpoiler\n\nThis is the most minmaxed version of the build I've created. It used pre-nerf harvest crafting so most of these items are uncraftable nowadays.\n\nHelm:\n\nHelm\n\nThe Helm is one of our most important equipment slot as it's what enables us to run both golems and spectres in the first place.\n\nLow budget:\n\nWhen we start mapping we're simply looking for a very cheap starting helm. We're looking for a +2 minion helm with either added Hypothermia or added Minion damage. We also want high life and resistances on the helm if possible. Usually, hypothermia is cheaper to get than Minion damage. Minion damage is the stronger choice to get though. During low budget, spectres are socketed into the helm.\n\nDuring very early mapping at the start of the league a Maw of Mischief helm can be an option. This pairs very well with the Amplification Rod weapon which allow our spectres to still be strong in a weapon instead of the helm.\n\nMaw of mischief gives some minion dmg, life and reduced mana cost of spells which is decent. But the biggest benefit is that it makes all minions aggressive which is very strong early on when Primordial Might jewels are super expensive.\n\nMedium/Intermediate budget:\n\nOur intermediate budget helm is actually going to be pretty expensive. These helms usually go for 12-20 exalted orbs. The basic premise here is to obtain a 7-link helm. The stats you're looking for are +3 to minion skill gems, Hypothermia and Minion damage support. A free prefix to benchcraft +1 Skeletons & Zombies is or 70 life is also preferable. During medium budget, spectres are socketed into the helm.\n\nUsually these heads are crafted using Frigid & Bound fossils with 2-socket resonators so you can often find them with some cold resistance aswell which is nice during league start.\n\nSome helms also has an open prefix which allows us to benchcraft 70 life or +1 Skeletons & Zombies. These helms will always exist and getting one of them is a early priority for the build as we ventur into the endgame.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nDon't ever try to craft one of these helms yourself. There are always dedicated crafting teams each league that make these helms that you can mirror service. When we run high budget versions of the build, golems and skeletons are socketed into the helm.\n\nBody Armour:\n\nBody\n\nIn our chest slot we're looking to link and power up one of our primary minions. During early parts of the league the chest is the strongest item we have which is why we run Golems and Skeletons in it early on. However, later on we swap and put our Golem & Skelly combo in the helm instead.\n\nLow budget:\n\nWhen you're poor, start of with a tabula or any 6link with some life and resistances if possible. Look to upgrade into a Skin of the Lords with good colors and a Keystone that doesn't break the build. These should be available for around ~50 chaos. This version runs Golems and Skeletons in the chest.\n\nFor the colors, you're looking for a minimum of 3 blue and 1 green.\n\nBest colors are 3b-1g-2r for low budget.\n\nIf you can't find a good Skin of the Lords or they're out of your Price range, a 6-link Covenant chest is a decent option during the very first days of a league. It's also very good at the end of the league cause no one uses it and it costs ~20 chaos then. The chest makes your skeletons cost life instead of mana which is a huge QoL thing early on when we have mana issues.\n\nMedium Budget:\n\nFor the intermediate budget version of the build we work towards a Skin of the Lords Chest with Elemental Equilibrium. These chests have become quite pricey because they're pretty niche and due to the popularity of the build.\n\nYou're looking for one with Elemental Equilibrium which provides a 25% cold exposure for the build. Lower budget versions run Awakened Cold pen for a 15% exposure but this option frees up a gem link and adds a stronger exposure on top of that. The colors you're looking for is a minmum of 3 blue and 2 red. The last color can be anything and what's the strongest depends on what version you're running so it's not set in stone. If you're running a green socket as the last one, either Divergent Hypothermia or Awakened Cold Pen is the strongest. If your final socket is red, Awakened Elemental Damage with Attacks is the best. If your final socket is blue you want to run either Divergent Predator or Increased Critical Strikes Damage support.\n\nThe intermediate version runs Golems and Skeletons in the chest.\n\nHigh Budget:\n\nFor high budget we're using the same Body Armour as the medium budget chest.\n\nThe reason is because this body Armour provides absurd defenses which helps us stay alive. After the 3.14 Beast nerf, getting your hands on high end +1 Spectre chests is extremely hard.\n\nThe colors of the chest are the same as in the medium budget version. 3 blue sockets and 2 red ones are mandatory. THe last socket can be filled with any color and what's going to be strongest depends on the rest of your gear. I'd argue that 3blue, 3red is the best color setup overall.\n\nThe high budget version of the build swaps Golems and Spectres around so Spectres and Zombies are instead socketed into the chest now.\n\nWeapon:\n\nWeapon\n\nLeague Start:\n\nDuring league start we're using a Clayshaper for the 1 additional Golem.\n\nDuring very early mapping before we have a decent helm we can also run an Amplification Rod. This limits us to only run Frost Auto-scout spectres however. This wand is great for getting started during the campaign.\n\nLow Budget:\n\nThe low budget version uses a +1 wand with ~50% increased minion damage. Make sure that it has a free suffix slot open so you can craft trigger on it which is imperative to make the build feel good. One of these wands usually costs around ~100 chaos.\n\nSpoiler\n\nIf you're extremely low budget, you can selfcraft a wand with an essence of fear.\n\nJust put one of those essences on a convoking wand until you hit one open suffix. Then craft the trigger and you have a very low budget trigger wand for a couple of chaos.\n\nMedium Budget:\n\n+2 wand with trigger bench craft and additional minion damage and Hatred effect. These wands are pretty expensive and usually cost around ~15 exalted orbs or more.\n\nWhatever you do, don't buy one with additional cold damage to spells as it messes up Elemental Equilibrium.\n\nThese wands are crafted using 4-socket resonators on Convoking Wands. The fossil combination is Metallic-Corroded-Shuddering-Jagged and should give you a 1/12 chance to get a +2 wand. The trigger craft is bench crafted and the Hatred Aura effect is added in the end by slamming a Redeemers Exalted Orb on top of the Wand.\n\nHigh Budget:\n\n+2 Wand with trigger craft, very high minion damage, attack speed and hatred aura effect.\n\nThese wands are very expensive and a perfect one is always available for mirror service every league.\n\nNormal Highbudget version:\n\nMirror Version:\n\nShield:\n\nShield\n\nLow budget:\n\nAs soon as we hit level 51 we want to get our hands on a Victario's Charity. This shield provides our minions with 3 Power and 3 Frenzy charges almost all the time. Unfortunately we don't get Power Charges for bosses since those are only generated when your minions kill enemies. Eitherway, this shield is a massive early game item and usually costs 1 chaos orb. We'll be using this shield for a long time.\n\nMedium Budget:\n\nFor our medium version of the build we're looking for any shield with +2 minimum Frenzy and +2 minimum Power charges. We also want a free Suffix to craft 5% chance to deal double damage or a free prefix to craft 8% cold damage as extra chaos damage. If you can, look for a shield with high %increased cold damage. These can get pricier though.\n\nThese shield is very easy to craft and all it requires is for you to Awakeners Orb the two bases together and finish it with a bench craft.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nThe high budget version of the shield is extremely hard to craft and costs hundred of Exalted Orbs so you're often better of getting a mirror service.\n\nWhat you're looking for is a high end +2 minimum Frenzy and Power charge shield with other very high damage modifiers. Cold Attuned Buckler used to be the strongest shield as it provided Brittle for the build. But since we have Brittle boots nowadays any bases work. Here's some examples of high end versions.\n\nGloves:\n\nGloves\n\nLeague Start:\n\nDuring the league start there won't be a supply of green Triads and they can be somewhat pricey aswell. A pair of Grip of the Councils only costs around ~2 chaos and work well at carrying you through the very first day of a new league.\n\nLow budget:\n\nFortunately our gloves are pretty cheap. You're looking for 4 socket green Triad Grips. People are usually pumping thee out on the market for 30 chaos early on which isn't too bad. Get one of them early on as they're build defining.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nWe're looking for 4 socket green Triad Grips with Commandment of the Grave lab enchant and a decent double corruption. The best corruptions you can get are %life and +1 to socketed gems.\n\nBoots:\n\nBoots\n\nBoots are very simple in this build and there's not much things changing between the lower and higher budgets. This build is very starved on suffix slots to cap resistances and get as high dexterity as possible. For this reason, the boots are simply there to get as much resistance, movespeed, life and dexterity as possible. Boots are also an important part for increasing our DPS as we want to craft Brittle on Ground effect as an implicit on them via Eldritch crafting.\n\nLow budget:\n\nDue to the existence of Rog crafting buying boots with high tiers of modifiers have never been easier. High suffix values, ~30% movespeed and crafted life boots are perfect on a low budget. Also make sure to Eldritch craft Brittle on Ground when walking.\n\nMedium Budget:\n\nMedium budget boots are basically any high life boots with very high resistances. You also want to Aisling Craft 30% movement speed with chill immunity and bench craft Freeze immunity to cross those Ailments of the list.\n\nCrafting these type of boots are also very straight forward and not too expensive. What you basically do is buy a base pair of boots with perfect suffixes sorted (Very cheap). Then you eldritch with Eldritch chaos orbs for high tier life. Bench suffixes cannot be changed. Aisling craft and pray that you don't hit the life mod to get movementspeed and chill immunity. Then finish the boots by bench crafting freeze immunity. As eldritch implicit mods Brittle is mandatory. The Eater of Worlds mod can be anything you like.\n\nThe medium budget also needs the Lightning Damage enchant from lab to make sure it can procc Elemental Equilibrium.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nHigh budget boots don't really change from the medium budget ones. It's basically the same but with higher tiers. A pair of high tier boots would have T1 in every modifier aswell as the highest tier of Brittle implicit.\n\nSpoiler\n\nIn the past we used to run +2 Spectre Boots, but that requires Elder on the boots which limits us from running Brittle unfortunately.\n\nBelt:\n\nBelt\n\nLow budget:\n\nOur low budget approach uses any cheap Stygian Vise with high life and resistances.\n\nMedium budget:\n\nAt medium budgets we're going for a Stygian Vise that simply is a stronger version of the low budget option. Getting one with very high dexterity and resistances aswell as the life is a good option. High armour prefix might also be nice. Getting a hunter mod on the belt with %increased life also increases the value of the belt alot.\n\nWe're also looking for a high life Ghastly Eye Jewel with Taunt.\n\nIf you can get additional physical or cold damage to minions that's even better. Minions deal 20% increased damage if you've used a minion skill recently is the best damage mod we can get on a Eye Jewel.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nFor the endgame budget we're using either a Headhunter, a Mageblood or a Darkness Enthroned Belt with perfect Ghastly Eye Jewels. Personally I prefer the Headhunter as it's the strongest belt for mapping available as it scales with the difficulty of the content you're running. Headhunters weakness is in low investment mapping and bossing where there's not enough rares to give you strong buff effects. For bossing a Darkness Enthroned with strong Jewels is the best option. No other belt comes close and this setup adds alot of extra damage to the build.\n\n3.18 Update:\n\nMonster modifiers have been changed in Sentinel League and Headhunter might actually become a very bad choice for minion builds. This is especially true if all Aura modifiers from rare monsters are gone. If that's the case, Headhunter becomes truly useless for minions.\n\nMageblood is the best defensive option due to its consistency. It's however 5 times as expensive as the headhunter and adds no offensive power. The strength of Mageblood is in its consistency and how it fixes things like resistance issues which this build struggles with.\n\nAmulet:\n\nAmulet\n\nThe purpose of our Amulet Item slot is to provide Life, resistances, Dexterity and an annointment. With a higher budget versions we're looking to run a Aul's Uprising allowing us to run an additional aura.\n\nLeague start:\n\nThe league start amulet is simply any rare Jade amulet with high life, resistances and dexterity. When on a limited budget we Annoint Death Attunement.\n\nLow Budget:\n\nIn 3.17 GGG introduced one of the strongest amulets in the game, Ashes of the Stars.\n\nThis amulet drops from the boss Eater of Worlds and has a very high droprate which makes it extremely cheap for what it gives. The amulet basically gives is all we want. +1 to skills, reservation to fit many Auras and +30% quality which gives us massive boosts to dps, clear and QoL.\n\nSome examples of why the quality is so strong for us are these gems:\n\n- Anomalous AG: 90% extra AoE.\n\n- Anomalous Convocation: 60% extra minion movement speed.\n\n- Divergent Flesh Offering: 15% extra minion attack speed.\n\n- Divergent Skitterbots: 15% increased ailment effect.\n\nThe list goes on, this amulet is absolutely nuts for this build and no amulet comes close. The availability of it also makes it very cheap. The lowbudget version anoints Charisma to fit as many auras as possible. Death Attunement is also an option if you're on a budget but aura management might become a trouble then. You're also looking for as much gem quality as possible.\n\nIntermediate:\n\nNothing changes here. Ashes of the Stars is simply too good and we're running one here aswell. The only changes is that you want to get one with higher Mana reservation and gem quality. Medium budget versions will look to get 20% hatred effect on the amulet as a corruption aswell.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nNo changes here either, just a higher budget Ashes of the Stars.\n\nHigh budget versions of the build will be looking for high values in reservation and gem quality aswell as strong Corrupted implicits. For implicits, you're probably looking for something like Hatred and +1 Curse.\n\nRings\n\nRings\n\nGoing forward we're now running a Hungryloop ring to solve issues with socket slots. The hungrloop also helps boost the defenses and offensive capabilities of our Animate Guardian. Using a Hungry Loop is extremely budget friendly but it makes it much harder to hit resistance and attribute requirements. We also lose a large chunk of life. But I think the benefits are too good to pass.\n\nOur secondary ring is used for life, resistances, potentially dexterity and Frostbite on hit.\n\nLow budget:\n\nThe low budget approach to the rings are basic. Find unset rings with High life, some resistances and maybe attributes. If you're struggling finding a good ring, ignore Dexterity and just run lower levels of Dash and Phase Run.\n\nJust make sure you get as much life and resistances here as possible.\n\nIn our Hungry Loop we're running:\n\nIncreased Area of Effect\n\nFeeding Frenzy\n\nMinion Life\n\nElemental Army\n\nMedium budget:\n\nIn the medium version of the build you're looking for one rare ring Frostbite on Hit aswell as resistances and life. The Hungry Loop also changes to using more high budget support gems. You're now looking to use:\n\nAwakened Increased Area of Effect\n\nFeeding Frenzy\n\nMinion Life\n\nEnhance Support\n\nIf you're worried about your Animate Guardian not being tanky enough, you can sacrifice some of his AoE from Enhancen and continue running Elemental Army Support.\n\nHigh budget:\n\nThe high budget version of the build runs the same rings as before, just with higher quality. In the Hungry Loop we're looking to run an Awakened Enhance Support instead for even more AoE on the AG. The other Unset Ring is looking for as high tiers as possible. In addition to high tiers of resistances and Frostbite, you want % increased minion damage aswell.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nVIII. Jewelsockets and Clusters\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nJewels and Clusters:\n\nJewels\n\nMy personal Jewels:\n\nMy personal Cluster Jewels:\n\nJewel Enchants and Corruptions:\n\nI highly advice to try and obtain 25% bleed avoidance on all of our Primordial Jewels. These jewels are usually pretty cheap to get and 100% bleed avoidance is huge for survivability. This also includes Corrupted blood. For the rest of your jewels you're looking to get either Stun Avoidance or Ignite Avoidance.\n\nYou want to focus on one of them. We're able to get 50% avoidance from our Frontline Cluster Jewel and our Thread of Hope. We don't really want to corrupt our Cluster Jewels so they can provide us with 15% from Harvest crafting enchants resulting in 45% avoidance. This allow us to get a total of 95% additional avoidance to one ailment from the remaining Jewels.\n\nThe very high budget version of the build runs as an Elementalist which is the reason why I'm running Forbidden Jewels with Unnatural Strength to increase our minion level, thus increasing damage and minion survivability. There are also valid Forbidden Jewels for Necromancer versions of the build aswell but these items are extremely expensive.\n\nSkill Tree Jewels:\n\nSpoiler\n\nSince we're running a Golem build, Primordial Jewels are a central aspect in our build. My final version of the build uses 1 Anima Stone, 1 Primordial Might and 2 Primordial Eminences. These jewels are essential as they provide the build with two additional Golems.\n\nWe also run a medium Thread of Hope which allows us to save up 8 skillpoints.\n\nCluster Jewels:\n\nSpoiler\n\nThis build recives a large part of its defensive layers from our cluster jewel. In the past we used cluster jewels to increase our dps but GGG decided to remove our only offensive cluster jewel option leaving us with nothing worth looking at offensively. This means that cluster jewels are a very low priority for us.\n\nLarge Cluster Jewels:\n\nThe cluster we run serve the primary purpose of anchoring two of our small cluster jewels. To make the most out of it we're also squeezing some added damage to the build by running Renewal and Vicious Bite on the cluster. For the last Noteable I like running Feasting Fiends as it gives our minions leech which they otherwise are lacking.\n\nHigh budget versions run 8-point clusters to save as much skill points as possible. Lower budget versions can run 9 or even 10 point Large clusters without Vicious Bite which are very cheap.\n\nThe easiest way to craft this cluster is to use harvest Reforge Crit crafts on a 8-socket minion base that's atleast ilvl 75. The crit ensures you roll Vicious Bite 100% of the time so all you gotta do is hit Renewal and Feasting Fiend aswell.\n\nThere could be an argument for running very high end budget 12-point clusters but I honestly don't know if I could fit the skill points to do so with the revamped skill tree.\n\nMedium Clusters:\n\nOur medium clusters serve one purpose and that's minion survivability.\n\nThe key component to this is Blessed Rebirth and the Life from Death noteables.\n\nBlessed Rebirth causes all minions summoned recently to be unvulnerable to damage which is a key component in keeping our Skeletons and Phantasms alive after summoning them recently. This will allow us to keep our minions up consistently without having to worry about them instantly dying once created.\n\nLife From Death is our primary source of healing for our minions. It causes all minions who die to instantly heal the rest of your minions for 4% per lost minion. Luckily, whenever we summon a new minion while the count is maximized the newly summoned minion replaces earlier summoned ones. This counts as the earlier summoned minions \"dying\". Each click with Raise Skeleton raises 4 skeletons which means each click heals all minions by 16%. Same thing goes for Phantasms who go away which constantly are resummoned automatically.\n\nThis effect alone makes sure that we almost never lose our minions, and more importantly, never lose our Animate Guardian.\n\nBest way I've found to craft this cluster is by using all your harvest Life reforges on a medium cluster base and just hope you get it eventually. Other methods could include using 1-socket resonators with Pristine Fossils.\n\nSmall Cluster Jewels:\n\nThis build runs two small clusters jewels which are essential to make the build work. Both are there for defensive purposes.\n\nThe first cluster is a small Aura efficiency cluster. It's important that it's a 3-point small cluster because we need all the mana reservation efficiency we can get. The notable we use is Sublime Form which increases the mana reservation of Grace allowing us to fit 5 Auras in the build without much cost.\n\nThe second cluster we run is a The Front Line unique small cluster jewel obtained from Delirium. This cluster Jewel grants us Veterans Awareness which increases maximum elemental resistances by 10% and physical damage reduction by 20% while a Guard skill is active. The downside is that we take 20% increased damage while our guard skill is removed. To mitigate this we scale duration on our Molten Shell bringing it over 10 second durations. We can also push cooldown reduction on guard skills pushing the cooldown to as low as 2 seconds possibly.\n\nLast edited by Deadandlivin on May 11, 2022, 3:30:37 PM\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nIX. Flask Setup\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlasks:\n\nSpoiler\n\nLow Budget flasks:\n\nLife Flask:\n\nOur Life Flask of choice is an Eternal Life Flask with a increased recovery rate prefix. This prefix causes the entire flask to heal its effect over the duration of 1.1 seconds which feels amazing. For a suffix we run bleed removal as. If you have bleed immunity from Jewel corruptions, either Ignite or Poison removal are the best options.\n\nGranite Flask:\n\nWe run a magic Granite Flask with chance to avoid Ignite/Stun/Shock/Curse as one of our armour sources. The mod you run on your flask depends on what you feel that your build is lacking.\n\nJade Flask:\n\nWe run a Jade Flask with increased Charge Recovery and Increased Armour during flask effect. The Evasion from the Jade flask gets multiplied from our Grace aura and our Skin of the Lords allowing us to reach very high evasion values without any evasion gear whatsoever. Increased charge recovery is used as it's the only prefix that increases our flask uptime which scales with our use of Instilling Orbs. Increased Duration also feels pretty good.\n\nQuicksilver Flask:\n\nFor movement speed we're running a quicksilver flask with increased charge recovery and 14% increased movement speed. This results in a flask that increases movement speed by 54%. In some instances, increased flask duration gives better uptime than increased charge recovery rate.\n\nBasalt Flask:\n\nOur last Flask option is a Basalt Flask to further increase Armour and juice up pur Molten Shell. We also want increased charge recovery or Increased Duration here to maximize flask uptime. The Suffix option can be somewhat flexible and you can choose whatever your build lacks for avoidances.\n\nIf you want to sacrifice survivability in favour of more speed you can swap the Basalt or Jade Flask for a Silver Flask instead to provide you with Onslaught. This is what I personally prefer.\n\nMageblood flasks:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nX. Animate Guardian Guide and Setup\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnimate Guardian Setup:\n\nSpoiler\n\nLets talk about the Animate Guardian, a central piece to any high tier proper Summoner build. First of all, what is an Animate Guardian?\n\nThe Animate Guardian is a skill gem you acquire which allows you to Summon a minion equipped with the gear of your choice. To summon an Animate Guardian, you must first create one. This is done by using your Animate Guardian skill on an item that's lying on the ground. Once you've used the actual skill on an item, your AG has been created and you'll see a flying item circling around you. As you start equipping more items the you finally will see a minion fully decked in the gear you've given him.\n\nThe Animate Guardian can equip 5 items:\n\n- Head\n\n- Chestpiece\n\n- Twohanded Weapon or 1-hand + Shield\n\n- Pair of boots\n\n- Pair of Gloves\n\nHis role in your minion army is to act as a buffer rather than a source of actual DPS. Our goal is to equip him with several Aura-like buffing items so amplify the damage of our minions. And there is several incredibly powerful items we have access to in the game that makes the Animate Guardian a central piece of all minion builds.\n\nBefore we start talking about what gear to use on him. Lets start of by discussing when to actually acquire one. A massive drawback with the animate guardian is that: When he dies - All gear on him is lost.\n\nFor that reason I would recommend a person to never start building an animate guardian unless you have a minimum of lvl 20 skill gem.\n\nIf you're gonna build a higher budget animate guardian, you will want to obtain a 21/20 skill gem. For the most expensive Animate Guardians you want a 21/20 Anomalous Animate Guardian as the alternate quality version adds 60% increased AoE for him. The goal is to make your AG as beefy as possible by capping his resistances and buffing up his healthpool through levels.\n\nHow do we make our Animate Guardian tanky enough to feel safe:\n\nBy raising his levels, acquiring increased life nodes in our tree and lastly, by giving him a ton of % life regeneration.\n\nIn the past we used to run the animate guardian in a +3 Unset Ring but nowadays we're running a new setup having him placed in a Hungry Loop. This makes him far tankier and increases the dps of the build.\n\nIn our Hungry Loop we're looking to use these support gems:\n\nMinion Life Support - For survivability\n\nFeeding Frenzy - For the Feeding Frenzy buff.\n\nAwakened Increased Area of Effect - For better clearspeed\n\nEnhance Support - For even more clearspeed\n\nIf you're afraid of your Animate Guardian dying you can also run Elemental Army on him instead of Enhance. This gives him +2% to maximum ele resistances, overcaps his Elemental resistance and increases his explosion damage by 20%. Meatshield Support could also be a very strong option to make him tankier.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, life regeneration is also one of the AGs primary defenses. Since minions have such large healthpools % of life regeneration mechanics are extremely strong on them. In the case of my Animate Guardian who has close to 80 000 health, 1% life regeneration translates into 800 life per second. Our goal here is gear up our guardian whith as much % of life regeneration as possible making him outregen all damage in the game.\n\nThe animate guardian has 40% base elemental resistances and 20% base Chaos Resistance. That means that we need 35% Fire/Cold/Lightning and 55% Chaos Resistance to cap out our AG. Running my build, the AG also recieves 23% Elemental Resistance from our skill tree and 30% elemental from our Necromancer Ascendency which actually makes him overcapped at 93% elemental resistance. The only reason we get additional resistance from his helm and boots is for the rare occurances where our AG runs out of range from our Auras and don't get affected by the Necromancer ascendency.\n\nAnimate Guardian Gear\n\nLets talk about the gear and our options for the Animate Guardian. I'll start by showing the type of items I use on my guardian.\n\nMy Gear:\n\nSpoiler\n\nHelm:\n\nReduced cold resistance Redeemer Helm:\n\nThe purpose of the AG helm is to reduce nearby monster cold resistance. This requires a redeemer helm with the \"Nearby enemies have -9% cold resistance\" mod. For very high budgets we're running a awakened shaper and redeemer helm with double maven elevated mods. This allows him to run a helm which reduces cold resistance by 12% and increases elemental damage taken by 9%. Such a helm costs over 20 exalted orbs though.\n\nWeapon:\n\nKingmaker\n\nKingmaker is handsdown the best weapon an Animate Guardian can use for any build. It provides +50% critical strike multiplier which is a huge dps boost and culling strike. It also provides a fortify aura around the Guardian.\n\nBody Armour:\n\nFor our chest we're looking to selfcraft a rare body armour with T1 explodey and +1 to curse. This is done via Awakened Orb crafting by combining a Crusader body armour with T1 Explodey.\n\nFor a base, you want an Astral Plate with +1 to curse which can be found on Hunter influenced body armours. After combining the chest pieces you should have an Astral Plate with +1 Curse and T1 Explodey. Make sure to Divine the explodey mod to 30% and bench craft something useful for your Animate Guardian.\n\nThis chest is pretty expensive though and will cost a couple of Exalted Orbs to craft. If you're on a budget, you can instead run an Inpulsa's Broken Heart. It causes shocked enemies to explode which works consistently when monsters die close to your Skitterbots since they have a Shocking Aura. The downside of running an Inpulsa is that the explosions wont chain outside of the Skitterbots Aura unlike a proper explodey chest. We also lose 1 curse which disable us from running Elemental Weakness as a corruption on his gloves.\n\nBoots:\n\nLegacy of Fury\n\nIn 3.17 GGG buffed Legacy of Fury making them give a Schorch Aura rather than dropping Scorched Ground. This is absolutely massive as the boots now causes our Animate Guardian to provide a -15% elemental resistance aura around him. In addition to that, he also gains another source of Explodey as scorched enemies now explode dealing fire damage aswell.\n\nGloves:\n\nGravebind Gloves\n\nOur gloves of choice is a pair of Gravebind Gloves corrupted with Elemental Weakness on hit. These can be very pricey costing a couple of Exalted Orbs. The effect of these gloves is what allows us to run explosion mods on the AG which drastically increases our clearspeed. For lower budgets you can run these gloves without the curse corruption because the added clearspeed from explosions are so powerful.\n\nAnimate Guardian Regeneration:\n\nOne of the biggest fears to any summoner is losing their animate guardian and all money they've invested into it. For this reason, one of the best ways to scale his defenses is by maximising his health and % health regeneration.\n\nFor this reason, alot of other build creators like to run things like The Dopplegangers Guise chest which gives him a flat 10% life regen making him really tanky and borderline immortal. I value the Inpulsa explosions too much to ever run any other chest however.\n\nThis undoubtably reduces our AGs recovery rate since all he gets is 2% from his boots, 1% from Renewaland 1% from the skill tree resulting in 4%.\n\nHowever, since we're running a Life From Death notable on one of our medium cluster jewels that cluster jewel alone provides immensive amounts of regen to our Animate Guardian constantly outhealing all damage he's taking. Whenever you see your AG health dropping you can \"spamheal\" him by casting skeletons healing him for over 30% life per second effecitvely outhealing most damage in the game.\n\nBudget Animate Guardian Setup:\n\nBudget\n\nThis is an item list for the early game once we reach maps. Only buy the items for this list once you have a 20/20 Animate Guardian Gem minimum. Try to get it as soon as possible, these items are basically free.\n\nAll of this is 1-3 chaos items. All in all, this setup will cost you ~10 chaos orbs and look at all you get for it. Defintely worth the value.\n\nHow to put Animate Guardian into your PoB:\n\nSpoiler\n\nLets talk about how we put make our Animate Guardians items actually affect our PoB profile:\n\n1. When in your PoB, press on the ITEMS tab in the upper left corner of the UI.\n\n2. Under the All Items section you will see all items included in your build. Pick one item you want to use to represent your Animate Guardian. I personally like using a flask for this because I can turn it on and off easily.\n\n3. Pick one item to use, for example your bottled faith and dubble click on it in the list.\n\n4. In the upper left corner of the UI you will find the option Edit Item. Click on Edit Item.\n\n5. A textbox will appear containing your item information.\n\nCopypaste this exact text and put it at the bottom of the textbox:\n\nMinions have +50% to critical strike multiplier\n\nNearby enemies have 50% increased fire and cold resistances\n\nIt should look like this.\n\n6. Press Save on the Textbox.\n\n7. Press Save again in the upper left corner of the PoB UI.\n\n8. DONE\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nXI. Medium Budget Guide\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nAfter completing the low budget version of the build you'll want to start working on the medium budget version. This version is far more expensive and utilizes some fairly expensive items, especially for new player standards.\n\nSome examples of items you'll be farming when working on this version is a higher budget summoner helm, summoner wand and a crafted rare shield.\n\nYou'll also be looking to get proper high end clusters, upgrade all of your gems to their highest level aswell as bringing up the level of your general gear. Some of the bigger ticket items like the 7-link helm and the +2 trigger wand usually cost around 15 exalted orbs each so prepare for a pretty steep increase in total build cost compared to the low budget variant.\n\nThis version is also where we're looking to change a core concept of the build by finally introducing Blade Vortex to the build further automatic curse uses and allocating Elemental Equilibrium with a Skin of the Lords. This version also marks creation of the final endgame version of our Animate Guardian with a proper Explodey Chest.\n\nMediumBudget\n\nMedium Budget PoB:\n\nSpoiler\n\nPath of Building pastebin links:\n\n- Full Medium Budget: https://pastebin.com/Ep93RewG\n\nOn average I would consider a build with a proper Helm, Wand and Clusters being in the medium budget range. This would bring it to an estimated build cost of ~50 ex in total. The PoB ahead is pretty maxed out and borderlines on high budget using things like x2 Awakened Multistrikes (~25 ex each). The total cost of the PoB is well over 100 ex.\n\nPoint allocations and Skilltree:\n\nSkillpoints\n\nPassive Skilltree(Up to level 100):\n\nhttps://poeplanner.com/b/ZFh\n\nDisclaimer: The skill tree does not include skill points allocated in Cluster Jewels or Thread of Hope.\n\nAscendancy:\n\nBandits:\n\nKill all bandits for 2 additional skill points.\n\nPantheon:\n\nPantheon's are flexible. In general, we run Brine King for Freeze immunity and Aberrath to protect against ignite. If you got Freeze immunity on boots, Soul of Lunaris is my prefered major Pantheon. If you got ignite covered with Jewel Corruptions, Soul of Shikari for poison and chaos protection is the best.\n\nAmulet and Ring Annointments:\n\nLike the general build guide suggests, we're running Charisma to fit all auras.\n\nCharisma:\n\nRings:\n\nRing anointments are the same as in all other versions of the build. We run two different Meteor Tower anointments. This includes the Burning Ground anoint on one ring and Double Meteor on the other.\n\nBurning Ground:\n\nThis causes meteors fired from your Meteor tower to leave a burning ground effect on the ground. Deals damage through fire immunity.\n\nDouble Meteor:\n\nNot much to say regarding this anointment. Simply fires two meteors instead of one.\n\nSkillgems and support links:\n\nGems\n\nHelmet - Spectres and Zombies:\n\nIn the medium version of the build, the helmet is reserved for our secondary minions. A 6-linked Skin of the Loyal is still better for dps than a medium budget helm which is why our secondary minions are here.\n\nLinks:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nWe're looking for an Anomalous 21/20 Raise Spectre as it buffs our Spectres marginally. Multistrike and Melee Physical Damage are two of the biggest modifiers we can get which is why we support with them.\n\nDisclaimer: In the PoB I run Melee Splash because minions still are able to cleave dealing double damage with Hydrosphere. You can read about it more in the general build guide. This mechanic is getting removed in the future and when it is, Melee Phys will be the best single target support gem. Currently due to the cleaving, Melee Splash is the best support gem for both clear and single target.\n\nChest - Carrion Golems and Skeletons:\n\nThese are our primary minions who'll be doing the most damage in the build. Just like a 7-link minion helm, Skin of the Lords provide +2 levels. Coupled with an Awakened Minion Damage you get +3 total which also makes it stronger than the helm.\n\nLinks:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nYou're looking for a 21/20 Carrion Golem here. A 21/20 Vaal Summon Skeletons will be extremely expensive and not worth your money. 21/0 skeletons are enough.\n\nWe want a divergent Hypothermia as it decreases enemies cold resistance by -4% per minion attacking which is a nice dps boost. It's currently unclear to me whether effects like this still work on freeze immune bosses. I've asked different build creators and they all say different things. People who specialize in cold builds however, say that pinnacle bosses have a minimum Ailment threshold which we can't break. This means that their actionspeed can't be reduced by a specific number which is why bosses don't get frozen. But technically, they are actually frozen, just that the freeze don't have full effect which means this gem would work.\n\nDisclaimer: In the PoB I run Divergent Melee Splash because minions still are able to cleave dealing double damage with Hydrosphere. You can read about it more in the general build guide. This mechanic is getting removed in the future and when it is, Hypothermia or a different gem will be the best single target support gem. Currently due to the cleaving, Melee Splash is the best support gem for both clear and single target.\n\nWeapon - Trigger setup:\n\nThe wand contains our primary method for spreading debuffs through Blade Vortex. It also triggers Flesh Offering for us and serve as a slot for our Determination Aura.\n\nLinks:\n\nDivergent Flesh Offering is used as it provides a substantial dps increase. By using Ashes of the Stars the quality of this alternate quality increases all minions attack speed by an additional 25%. Triggers don't affect Auras so the wand won't automatically turn on or off our Determination.\n\nShield - Skitterbots and Assassin's Mark:\n\nOur shield has our Skitterbots aswell as Assassin's Mark allocated. Assassin's Mark is only used for single target dps since mark skills aren't reduced by curse effectiveness. It also provides us with extra Power Charges for our minions due to its quality effect.\n\nLinks:\n\nDivergent Skitterbots and Bonechill provides a larger dps increase than the regular ones. Normal Assassin's Mark also allows our minions to get additional Power Charges for a large dps increase. For general purpose mapping, Assassin's Mark is rarely used and can be swapped for any other gem if you like. This include skills like Defiance Banner for more survivability or Awakened Unbound Ailments for a passive dps increase.\n\nDisclaimer: In 3.18 we're still able to cleave with Hydrosphere. That's why my 3.18 PoBs have Hydrosphere here cause we have nowhere else to put it. Generally, I'm sacrificing Assassin's Mark for it.\n\nIf I want to maximize single target I'll sacrifice Convocation and run both Hydrosphere and Assassin's Mark.\n\nGloves - Mobility Setup:\n\nSince we're running Cold Conversion we're forced to run 4 Green Gems. We're using our two mobility gems here and Desecrate so we can use Offering Skills on bossfights.\n\nMy Links:\n\nWe run divergent Dash for permanent phasing and normal Phase Run for increased movement speed, both which are improved by Ashes of the Stars. Desecrate is used to allow us to produce corpses for bossfights.\n\nDisclaimer: Make sure ONLY Dash is linked to Second Wind. You want to avoid having Desecrate or Phase Run linked to Second Wind cause it needlessly increases the manacost of those spells.\n\nBoots - Hatred and Molten Shell:\n\nIn our boots we're running Hatred and Molten Shell with their respective support gems. Increased Duration is a large part of our defensives since it increases the duration of Molten Shell by a large amount.\n\nLinks:\n\nAwakened Generosity is used for an additional level added to Hatred and even more aura effect. All other gems are normal quality.\n\nRing1 - Animate Guardian:\n\nOur Animate Guardian is socketed into a Hungry Loop for maximum support and to save gemlinks cause we're extremely socket starved.\n\nLinks:\n\nHungry Loop Links:\n\nAlternatively:\n\nWe're running a 21/20 Anomalous Animate Guardian in this build for the increased Area of Effect added to his explosions. Enhanced Support is also used to further increase his area of effect. If you're afraid that your Animate Guardian is too squishy you can instead run with Elemental Army Support which gives him maximum Elemental resistance aswell as increased damage. Meatshield Support is also a viable option.\n\nRing2 - Convocation:\n\nIn the Ring we're running Convocation. This can be flexed and we can swap Convocation for a different skill gem if we like. This can be helpful for difficult bosses were Convocation don't really matter.\n\nLinks:\n\nWe're using Anomalous Convocation since every 1% of quality gives our minions 2% movement speed. Coupled with Ashes of the Stars this results in a 100% movement speed increase for our minions. Due to our duration investment overall, the speed buff lasts longer than the cooldown of Convocation too.\n\nEquipment Guide:\n\nGear\n\nHelm - 7-link Bone Helmet:\n\nThe helm is one of the bigger purchases in the medium budget version of the build. You're looking for a double influenced Elder & Shaper Bone Helm, a so called 7-link helm. The most important mods to get is +3 level to minion gems, minion damage support and Hypothermia support.\n\nYou'll also have to make sure that the helm has alot of resistances so you can cap yourself due to how constrained we are on resistances. Since we're also lacking life on most of our items, getting a high life roll is extremely helpful here. A free prefix to benchcraft +1 skellies and +1 Zombies is also optional for even more dps. This sacrifices alot of life though.\n\nThe BiS head enchant for dps is Flesh Offering attack speed increase as it provides an additional 21% minion attack speed.\n\nPrice: ~15 exalted orbs\n\nChest - Skin of the Lords:\n\nIn our chest we're looking for a Skin of the Lords with Elemental Equilibrium as a keystone modifier. The mandatory colors you're looking for are 3blue and 2red colors. The last color can be any other color where all have their own advantages.\n\nIn general, I would say that 1 red is the best last socket to get overall.\n\nFor pure single target, a fourth blue is the best.\n\nDefensively green is the best due to added freeze chance with Hypothermia Support. Divergent Hypothermia also decrease the cold resistance of frozen targets by 4% PER MINION. This stacks up and provides a massive single target dps boost against monsters affected by freeze.\n\nElemental Equilibirum increase the power of our Exposure in the build by 15% additional resistance reduction giving us a 25% cold reduction exposure. This is applied with Blade Vortex. The 100% increased global defense modifier also serve to increase our Armour by a huge margin.\n\nPrice: ~4 exalted orbs (colors and availability changes the price drastically)\n\nWeapon - +2 Trigger Wand:\n\nIn our weaponslot we're looking for a classic +2 minion Convoking Wand. Not only that, we're also looking for a moderate minion damage modifier, I'd say atleast above 40% but it depends on what the market prices are.\n\nYou finish the suffixes on the wand by benchcrafting multimod so you can craft both minion attackspeed and trigger on it. Any wand with the prefixes sorted(+ to skills and minion damage) can be finished with multimod. Via harvest crafting you can reduce the amount of suffixes allowing you to metacraft Prefixes cannot be changed. After that you can use an Orb of Scouring to clear all suffixes and finish of the item with the multimod craft.\n\nPrice: ~15 exalted orbs\n\nShield - Minimum Charges rare Shield:\n\nNote: This is actually a decently high budget shield. A medium budget shield would worse mods than this but I don't own any medium budget shield.\n\nIn our shield slot we're looking for a Crusader and Redeemer influenced shield with +2 to minimum power and frenzy charges. Ideally, we also want a free suffix on the shield so we can craft 5% chance to deal double damage. The base for this type of shield is easily crafted slamming two shields together with an Awakeners Orb to get the charges sorted. If you get a free suffix you got a shield worth working on.\n\nObtaining good prefixes is entirely RNG. You either get good prefixes from the initial Awakener Orb. If not you'll have to resort to Harvestspamming reforge keep suffix until you're happy with the mods you get.\n\nWhat you're looking for is any of these mods:\n\n- % increased cold damage\n\n- % increased damage per chance to block\n\n- %cold damage as extra chaos\n\n- % increased elemental damage with attacks\n\nThrowing the shield into the lottery for good prefixes can be frustrating and it's often just easier to straight out buy a finished shield you're happy with.\n\nPrice: ~15 exalted orbs\n\nGloves - 4Green Triads:\n\n4 Green Triads is a staple of the build and required to convert our minions physical damage to cold. As a Lab enchant, you're looking for Commandment of the Grave to spawn additional minions.\n\nPrice: 20-30 chaos\n\nBoots - Brittle Boots with Freeze immunity:\n\nIn the medium budget build I've included a pair of farily high budget boots.\n\nIt's mandatory to get as much resistances and dexterity on here to make sure you're able to cap resistances and use all your skill gems. I wouldn't settle for anything less than T2 personally unless you can afford it in your stat budget.\n\nIf you have the suffixes sorted the rest of the boots are fairly easy to craft. Via eldritch crafting you just spam Eldritch Chaos Orbs to reroll the prefixes until you get T1 Life and a free prefix. If your eldritch chaos orb was succesfull, you can craft Suffixes cannot be changed on the item to Anul of the second prefix leaving 1 free prefix and the Suffixes cannot be changed mod. After that you just Aisling Slam via Betrayal to get "
