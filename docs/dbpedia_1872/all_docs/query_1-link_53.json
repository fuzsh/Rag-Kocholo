        "text": "It is a great pleasure for me to report about your colleague and my friend François Mignard. I know him since now 43 years and shared with him some scientific adventures. If, because of my age, I had to leave the Gaia project, I have followed the tremendous work done since by François Mignard and noticed that, despite his masterly played role as the conductor of the Gaia orchestra, he kept an important scientific activity. Actually, Gaia is far from being all his scientific achievements. And this is what I shall try to convince you.\n\nGaia is an ESA cornerstone mission conducting a full sky survey over its 5 year operational period. Gaia performs astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic measurements. The data processing is entrusted to scientists and engineers who have formed the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC). The photometric science alerts started in 2014. The first intermediate data release (Gaia DR1) took place 14 September 2016 and it has been extensively used by the community. Gaia DR2 is scheduled for April 2018. Gaia is expected to be able to continue observations roughly for another 5 years after the nominal phase. The procedure to grant funding for the extension period has been initiated. In case funding is granted, the total operational time of Gaia may be 10 years.\n\nIn this contribution I provide a brief summary of the contents of Gaia DR1. This is followed by a discussion of studies in the literature that attempt to characterize the quality of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution parallaxes in Gaia DR1, and I point out a misconception about the handling of the known systematic errors in the Gaia DR1 parallaxes. I highlight some of the more unexpected uses of the Gaia DR1 data and close with a look ahead at the next Gaia data releases, with Gaia DR2 coming up in April 2018.\n\nGaia DR1 was released in September 2016 and contained a photometric catalogue of over 1 billion sources. At this stage, this only included mean G-band photometry and an estimate of the error. Even though this may sound limited in nature, interesting science can still be achieved with this data thanks to its quality. A high level overview of the photometric processing and some validation results will be presented. Additionally, epoch photometry in the G-band was released in Gaia DR1 for a small number of variable sources in the South Ecliptic Pole which covers the LMC. The second data release (Gaia DR2) is currently being prepared and, if available, some preliminary validation results will be presented. It is planned that this release will contain colour information in the form of integrated BP and RP photometry in addition to the latest G-band photometry.\n\nGaia DR1 is based on the first 14 months of Gaia's observations. This is not long enough to reliably disentangle the parallax effect from proper motion. For most sources, therefore, only positions and magnitudes are given. Parallaxes and proper motions were nevertheless obtained for about two million of the brighter stars through the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS), combining the Gaia observations with the much earlier Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions. In this review I focus on some important characteristics and limitations of TGAS, in particular the reference frame, astrometric uncertainties, correlations, and systematic errors.\n\nThe Gaia first data release (DR1) already provides an almost error free optical reference frame on the milli-arcsecond (mas) level allowing significantly better calibration of ground-based astrometric data than ever before. Gaia DR1 provides positions, proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes for just over 2 million stars in the Tycho-2 catalog. For over 1.1 billion additional stars DR1 gives positions. Proper motions for these, mainly fainter stars (G ≥ 11.5) are currently provided by several new projects which combine earlier epoch ground-based observations with Gaia DR1 positions. These data are very helpful in the interim period but will become obsolete with the second Gaia data release (DR2) expected in April 2018. The era of traditional, ground-based, wide-field astrometry with the goal to provide accurate reference stars has come to an end. Future ground-based astrometry will fill in some gaps (very bright stars, observations needed at many or specific epochs) and mainly will go fainter than the Gaia limit, like the PanSTARRS and the upcoming LSST surveys.\n\nBecause of to its exceptional resolving power, Gaia should detect a few thousands gravitational lensed systems. These consist in multiple images of background quasars. The estimated number of lens phenomena in the sky, however, depends on the cosmological model considered. By taking into account the observational bias that will restrict the detection of lensed quasars, identification of these up to a given limiting magnitude will constrain the cosmological parameters.\n\nWe have investigated the known gravitationally lensed quasars present in the Gaia DR1, and found that a significant number of components of these systems have been measured and are present in the Gaia DR1 catalogue although quasi none of them have all their components detected. We additionally examined the immediate surroundings of QSOs from the large Quasar catalogue, LQAC3, and detected several configurations compatible with gravitational lensing phenomena. A more global strategy to systematically detect the potential candidates in the various releases of the Gaia catalogue is presented.\n\nIn this proceeding, we show how observations of Solar System Objects with Gaia can be used to test General Relativity and to constrain modified gravitational theories. The high number of Solar System objects observed and the variety of their orbital parameters associated with the impressive astrometric accuracy will allow us to perform local tests of General Relativity. In this communication, we present a preliminary sensitivity study of the Gaia observations on dynamical parameters such as the Sun quadrupolar moment and on various extensions to general relativity such as the parametrized post-Newtonian parameters, the fifth force formalism and a violation of Lorentz symmetry parametrized by the Standard-Model extension framework. We take into account the time sequences and the geometry of the observations that are particular to Gaia for its nominal mission (5 years) and for an extended mission (10 years).\n\nWith the launch of Gaia in December 2013, Europe entered a new era of space astrometry following in the footsteps of the very successful Hipparcos mission. A weakness of Gaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths. However, much of the Galactic centre and the spiral arm regions are obscured by interstellar extinction. An obvious improvement on Gaia is to include the Near-Infra-Red (NIR) which requires the use of new types of detectors. Additionally, to scan the entire sky and measure global absolute parallaxes the spacecraft must have a constant rotation resulting in a moving image that must be compensated for by, for example, operating the detectors in Time Delayed Integration (TDI) mode. If these technical issues can be solved a new Gaia-like mission separated by a 20 year interval would give; 1) NIR all-sky astrometry and photometry to penetrate the obscured regions and to observe intrinsically red objects with almost diffraction limited resolution; 2) improved proper motions with fourteen times smaller errors than from Gaia alone opening up new science cases, such as long period exoplanets and accurate halo measurements; 3) allow the slowly degrading accuracy of the Gaia reference frame, which will be the basis for future astronomical measurements, to be reset.\n\nThanks to their point-like structure and to their lack of significant proper motion, quasars represent the ideal objects for modeling quasi-inertial directions in space. For that reason the present primary conventional reference frame, the ICRF-2, is constructed from the set of the celestial coordinates of a sample of extragalactic objects, whose the very large majority are quasars. Thus any newly discovered quasar must be considered as a potential future ideal astrometric marker. Therefore compiling all the recorded quasars at a given epoch looks as a useful task. This constitutes the aim of the LQAC (Large Quasar Astrometric Catalogue). We present here the contents of the future release of this catalogue quoted as the LQAC-4, insisting on the related strategy of compilation. Preliminary results concerning the cross-identification with the Gaia DR1 catalogue are emphasized\n\nWe use methods of differential astrometry to construct a small field inertial reference frame stable at the micro-arcsecond level. Using Gaia measurements of field angles we look at the influence of the number of reference stars and the stars magnitude as well as astrometric systematics on the total error budget with the help of Gaia-like simulations around the Ecliptic Pole in a differential astrometric scenario. We find that the systematic errors are modeled and reliably estimated to the μas level even in fields with a modest number of 37 stars with G <13 mag over a 0.24 sq. degrees field of view for short timescales of the order of a day for a perfect instrument and with high-cadence observations. Accounting for large-scale calibrations by including the geometric instrument model over such short timescales requires fainter stars down to G=14 mag without diminishing the accuracy of the reference frame.\n\nWe combined the data from the Gaia DR1 and Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogues in order to derive the absolute proper motions more than 420 million stars distributed all over the sky in the stellar magnitude range 8 mag < G < 21 mag (Gaia magnitude). To eliminate the systematic zonal errors in position of 2MASS catalogue objects, the 2-dimensional median filter was used. The PMA system of proper motion has been obtained by direct link to 1.6 millions extragalactic sources. The short analysis of the absolute proper motion of the PMA stars Catalogue is presented in this work. From a comparison of this data with same stars from the TGAS, UCAC4 and PPMXL catalogues, the equatorial components of the mutual rotation vector of these coordinate systems are determined.\n\nThe Gaia astrometric reference catalogue will provide star proper motions with an accuracy of one mas one century ago for stars of magnitude 14 or brighter. Our project is to re-reduced the old observations with the new catalogue allowing to have an astrometric accuracy only limited by the observational biases and not by reference stars. Then, we plan to get an accuracy of 50 mas where the old reductions were not better than 500 mas!\n\nFor our purpose, we will digitize old photographic plates with a sub-micrometric scanner. Tests were made using the UCAC catalogue showing that old photographic plates have an intrinsect accuracy of 30 to 60 mas.\n\nGaia DR1 positions are used to astrometrically calibrate three epochs’ worth of Subaru SuprimeCam images in the fields of globular cluster NGC 2419 and the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Distortion-correction “maps” are constructed from a combination of offset dithers and reference to Gaia DR1. These are used to derive absolute proper motions in the field of NGC 2419. Notably, we identify the photometrically-detected Monoceros structure in the foreground of NGC 2419 as a kinematically-cold population of stars, distinct from Galactic-field stars. This project demonstrates the feasibility of combining Gaia with deep, ground-based surveys, thus extending high-quality astrometry to magnitudes beyond the limits of Gaia.\n\nSince September 2016, the first release (DR1) of the Gaia catalogue was appeared. The optical Gaia positions of sources will be linked to the ICRF (VLBI radio positions of mostly quasars, QSOs). For high accurate link we need to investigate variations of optical flux of QSOs via their magnitude variations using data of ground-based telescopes. To do that, from 2013 we observed 47 QSOs and other sources; nine optical telescopes were used for that monitoring. To increase the total number of objects for the link, after a first set of 70 objects (Bourda et al. 2008), Bourda et al. (2011) established a second set of 47 objects. It is necessary to investigate the photometry and morphology of these objects. We collected ground-based data of QSOs (B, V and R mag) and compared with G mag of Gaia DR1; some results are presented here.\n\nA Danish computer, GIER, from 1961 played a vital role in the development of a new method for astrometric measurement. This method, photon counting astrometry, ultimately led to two satellites with a significant role in the modern revolution of astronomy. A GIER was installed at the Hamburg Observatory in 1964 where it was used to implement the entirely new method for the measurement of stellar positions by means of a meridian circle, at that time the fundamental instrument of astrometry. An expedition to Perth in Western Australia with the instrument and the computer was a success. This method was also implemented in space in the first ever astrometric satellite Hipparcos launched by ESA in 1989. The Hipparcos results published in 1997 revolutionized astrometry with an impact in all branches of astronomy from the solar system and stellar structure to cosmic distances and the dynamics of the Milky Way. In turn, the results paved the way for a successor, the one million times more powerful Gaia astrometry satellite launched by ESA in 2013. Preparations for a Gaia successor in twenty years are making progress."
