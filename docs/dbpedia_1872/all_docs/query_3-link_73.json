        "text": "Low- and intermediate-mass stars are one of the important dust sources in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. The compositions of dust ejected from these stars are likely to affect those in the ISM. We investigate dust in post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, which are in a late evolutionary phase for low- and intermediate-mass stars, and which produce a wide variety of dust grains. We are particularly targeting post-AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which has about half of the solar metallicity, to investigate the effects of sub-solar metallicity on dust compositions. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained 5-30 micron spectra of 24 post-AGB candidates in the LMC. Five are C-rich post-AGB stars, and this presentation focuses on spectra of these stars. We found that rare dust features in the Milky Way, such as a 21 micron unidentified feature are commonly found in LMC post-AGB stars. The 6-8 micron spectra are compared with those of Galactic objects. F..."
