Irregular galaxy Sextans A. The bright Milky Way foreground stars appear yellowish in this view. Beyond them lie the stars of Sextans A with young blue star clusters clearly visible.

Sextans A ( as known as UGCA 205 ), is a tiny dwarf irregular galaxy. It spans about 5000 light-years across, and is located within the Local Group of galaxies, which includes our Milky Way galaxy. At 4.3 million light-years away from Earth, Sextans A is one of most distant members of the Local Group, and is notable for its peculiar square shape. Massive short-lived stars exploded in supernovae that caused more star formation, triggering yet more supernovae, ultimately resulting in an expanding shell. Young blue stars now highlight areas and shell edges high in current star formation, which from the perspective of observers on Earth appears roughly square.[5]
