        "text": "Cabinda\n\nCabinda is a piece of land in West Africa that lies between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo and the Atlantic Ocean. Adjacent to its coast are some of the largest offshore oil fields in the world. Formally, it is an exclave and province of Angola, but this status has been disputed by several groups that proclaimed independence in 1975. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda - Forces Armadas de Cabinda (FLEC-FAC) runs an exile office in Paris.\n\nBaarle\n\nBaarle is a tiny village that is divided in to thirty pieces of land—mostly enclaves, sub-enclaves and exclaves—on the border of Belgium and the Netherlands. The Belgian parts of the village are called Baarle-Hertog and the Dutch form Baarle-Nassau. The village has two mayors, two police offices and two town councils. The border runs straight through streets, squares, gardens and even houses. It is not without reason that Baarle is often called the most curious village in the world.\n\nNutopia\n\nOn the 1st of April, 1973 John Lennon and Yoko Ono announced: ‘[...] the birth of a conceptual country, NUTOPIA. Citizenship of the country can be obtained by declaration of your awareness of NUTOPIA. NUTOPIA has no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people. NUTOPIA has no laws other than cosmic. All people of NUTOPIA are ambassadors of the country. As two ambassadors of NUTOPIA, we ask for diplomatic immunity and recognition in the United Nations of our country and its people.’ The Nutopian anthem (included on Lennon’s album Mind Games) consists of only a few seconds of silence, finding a resemblance in John Cage's 4’33’’. Besides stating an ideology that is in line with the famous song ‘Imagine’ this was also seen as a satirical response to Lennon’s ongoing immigration troubles."
