        "text": "Suddenly, with a roar of its engine, the ship set off, carrying about 30 journalists for a tour of the port of Mariupol. The bottle-green waves of the Sea of Azov lapped gently at its sides as the June sun shone on the deck. You would almost forget that you were on a military ship, that the port was littered with debris and that the city beyond it was covered in charred ruins.\n\nThe feeling of unease faded a little at the sight of a few dozens of Mariupolitans who came to spend the day on the first beach in the city to be completely cleared of mines. It is surreal to see their sunbathing bodies lying on the sand, at the foot of the collapsed buildings, some of which still hide other – lifeless – bodies.\n\nThe message sent by the Russian army, which organized this press trip in the conquered territories of eastern and southern Ukraine, was that of a return to normal. The port and its waters were cleared of mines at the end of May, and the docks were largely cleaned up. Everything was ready to function, despite the fact that 70% of the infrastructure was destroyed by the war.\n\nAccording to director Pavel Chvatski, three water trade routes have already been opened with Russia to transport metal produced by the famous Donbas steel mills. A modest target is set at one million tons by the end of the year. Above all, the port of Mariupol must be used to export the grain produced in the Donbas and especially in the newly-conquered rural regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nAlso on this subject – which concerns the whole world with the prospect of a major food crisis – the message is clear. Denis Pushilin, the leader of the \"Donetsk People's Republic\" (DPR), to which Mariupol is supposed to be attached, consistently repeated to the journalists: \"We have the technical capacity. (...) Western sanctions are an obstacle, but there is no shortage of clients, and we can export to third countries, which in turn will resell the grain.\"\n\nMore on this topic Subscribers only The grim future of Ukrainian agriculture\n\nMariupol is coming out of a long nightmare. During a two-month siege, this city of 500,000 inhabitants was crushed under bombs, amassing thousands or possibly even tens of thousands of civilian casualties. The city is now slowly emerging. The streets are gradually cleared and the stores are once again stocked. The corpses buried in shallow graves in courtyards during the siege have been dug up and buried in huge makeshift graveyards. Running water and electricity are back in some neighborhoods. Gas is not, which means next winter could be harsh.\n\nRehearsals of a play by Chekhov"
