        "text": "Abkhazia\n\nAbkhazia lies on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, flanked by Russia to the North and Georgia to the South. In 1990, just before the dissolution of the USSR, Abkhazia declared its sovereignty. This was not accepted by neighbor state Georgia nor the government in Moscow and led to an armed conflict in 1992 which lasted for 14 months. The Georgian troops were forced to leave Abkhazia and in 1994 a new constitution was drawn. It was adopted by popular referendum in 1999 after which Abkhazia once again declared its State Sovereignty. However, it was only after Abkhazian forces fought against Georgian forces during the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 that Abkhazia was formally recognized by Russia. It is also recognized as an independent state by Venezuela, Nicaragua, Syria, Nauru, South Ossetia, Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Parliament of Georgia still considers Abkhazia as an autonomous republic within its territory.\n\nMont Blanc\n\nThe Mont Blanc is the highest mountain of the Mont Blanc Massif and one of the highest peaks in Europe. The summit lies at the border between France and Italy. French cartographers claim three of the principal peaks (of which the Mont Blanc is one) within its territory, but this is disputed by the Italians who place the border right on the top of the mountain. This claim is backed up by locals from both sides who suggest the summit should be shared. The first recorded ascent was made on 8th August 1786, marking it the start of modern mountaineering.\n\nConch Republic\n\nIn 1982 the Conch Republic was declared as a ludic protest against a Border Patrol blockade which was installed by the US Federal Government to control drug trafficking in and out the Florida Keys. As a result of this roadblock, tourists cancelled their visits and the local community saw their biggest source of income disappear and turned to their Mayor Dennis Wardlow. After a lost lawsuit to stop the roadblock, Wardlow told the press “We are going to go home and secede”. Wardlow declared independence from and war against the US, and surrendered on the same day, demanding one million dollars to restore the pre-blockade economy. The locals view their secession not as a revolutionary act against the US but rather the opposite—they felt that they were alienated as Americans. In the end the publicity surrounding the faux secession led to a new source of income for the local entrepreneurs."
