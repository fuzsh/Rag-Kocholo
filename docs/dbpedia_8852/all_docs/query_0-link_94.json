        "text": "MOSCOW, June 22. /TASS/. The territory located outside the US Embassy in Moscow has been named \"Donetsk People's Republic Square\" thanks to the decree signed by the Russian capital’s mayor, Sergey Sobyanin.\n\nThe embassy’s address was subsequently changed to \"Donetsk People's Republic Square No. 1, buildings 1-9\". Its former address, Bolshoy Devyatinsky Pereulok No. 8, was annulled.\n\nThe proposal to rename the area the US embassy occupies, was put forward by a group of Moscow legislators, while Muscovites were asked to vote online for the best name.\n\nThe move follows the decision by some unfriendly countries, namely Lithuania, Latvia and the Czech Republic to rename streets where Russian embassies are located after Ukraine and Ukrainian heroes."
