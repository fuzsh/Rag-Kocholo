        "text": "Western Sahara\n\nThe Sahrawi Republic is a partially recognized state that claims the non-self-governed territory of Western Sahara, but controls only the easternmost one-fifth of it. Morocco controls and administers the rest of the disputed territory and calls these lands its Southern Provinces. The Sahrawi Republic was proclaimed by the Polisario Front on 27th February, 1976, to fill what they considered a political void left by the departing Spanish colonizers. It maintains diplomatic relations with 40 UN states and is a full member of the African Union. While the claimed capital is the former Western Sahara capital El-Aaiún, the provisional capital was formally moved to Tifariti in 2008. Day-to-day business, however, is conducted in the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria, which house most of the exiled Sahrawi community.\n\nAntarctica\n\nAntarctica is the most southern continent on Earth. Although there was speculation dating back to antiquity about a large piece of land in the South territory (Terra Australis), Antarctica was discovered as late as 1820 by a Russian expedition. As a result of the barren conditions it was left untouched until a Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen landed on the continent in 1895, beating the British Robert Scott whose team died in the attempt. Antarctica is a condominium, governed by parties who signed the Antarctic Treaty drawn up in 1959. Fifty countries have signed up so far. Since Antarctica is relatively untouched it is an important place for scientific research on climate change.\n\nBoon Island\n\nThe Republic of Boon Island declared its independence on 1st April 2003, in an effort to raise funds to restore and maintain the remote lighthouse off the coast of Maine. ‘Every political and government office for the new Republic is for sale—for the right price’, the self proclaimed regent of the new republic Tim Harrison said to reporters. ‘We are a corrupt government, but we are corrupt for the benefit of the people and for the people.’ Citizenship was available to anyone who was willing to pay the $25.00 fee. In 2014, the lighthouse was sold to a real estate developer."
