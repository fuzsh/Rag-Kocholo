        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Dan Bartlett interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. Thanks for coming to be with us here in Washington. We talked before the tape began running about the fundamental ground rules, but I'll just repeat for the record that we're talking under a veil of confidentiality. We're pleased to say after some two decades of time we've never had a breach of our confidences, so we want you to speak candidly to the record. I know in Washington that may seem to be a bold statement, but we're good for our word on these things, and we hope that you'll speak candidly, recognizing that the audience is not the two of us but people in future generations who want to come to understand this President and his Presidency as you lived it.\n\nOne of the things that we always like to do at the beginning is to find out a little about the people who came in to serve in a Presidential administration. So I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about your own background, your growing up and your family and things like that.\n\nBartlett\n\nI grew up in what I guess is the smallest of the 254 counties in Texas, Rockwall County, which sounds very rural and rustic, and at the time it was, but now it's just a bedroom community of Dallas, Texas, because of the growth there. It's about halfway between Dallas and Tyler, Texas.\n\nI was not raised in a family that was overly political. One of my buddies growing up, his dad was the mayor of Rockwall, and I worked on his campaign a little bit, but that was more out of boredom than any sort of passion for politics. In Texas there is a fork in the road usually somewhere between sixth and eighth grade where you either become a Longhorn or an Aggie. I took the—\n\nRiley\n\nYou waited that late?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nSee, I'm from Alabama. You couldn't get that old.\n\nBartlett\n\nMaybe it was earlier than that. Ended up going to the University of Texas. From where I was coming from I wasn't even attempting to put together the fact that I wouldn't be going to college, the home of the state government and politics there. It was only because I didn't want to go home for a summer—I had to get a job to stay in Austin—that a buddy of mine got me a job at the state capitol to work the legislative session there. I was good friends with members of the family of our state senator, who was a Democrat at the time, Ted Lyon [Jr.], and so I got a job there. I started to get the political bug, and was watching Ann Richards, who was Governor of Texas at the time, and Bob Bullock, the legendary Lieutenant Governor. I worked on the Senate side and there was a big public debate about whether Texas should have a lottery and all the politics around that. It really sparked my interest in politics.\n\nBut I really had no path or understanding of how I was going to stay involved in it. Or frankly even if I was going to stay involved in politics. It was one of those things that just by happenstance the guy I met at the capitol turned out to be a good buddy of mine, got another job for some guy named Karl Rove, who at that time was not a household name but a pretty well-known name in political circles, direct mail, particularly as a direct mail consultant at the time. This would have been in 1991 going into 1992.\n\nHe got over there and was working only for a couple of weeks and said, \"Hey, we've got more work over here and it pays better.\" That was my motive to go. It wasn't that I thought I was hitching onto a wagon that was going somewhere as much as it was to make a little bit more money.\n\nIt may have been literally my first week or two working over in Karl's office that I was answering the phone and some guy named George W. Bush was calling. That was going into the '92 cycle. We were doing a lot of regional direct mail for the Bush oil campaign at the time, and I was doing a lot of the research for it that would go into the direct mail pieces.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you considered yourself a Republican at the time? You made the change?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nSo that was settled.\n\nBartlett\n\nYes. There were no doubts in my mind about my politics. It was interesting going to the University of Texas. I was a minority voice in most of my government classes. I was a government major and so had to go and defend my views quite a bit. But I never got involved in student politics or anything.\n\nRiley\n\nAny professors that you particularly looked up to or had a reaction to?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes, there was—I'm trying to remember his name now. [Robert] Luskin—\n\nNelson\n\nBob Luskin.\n\nBartlett\n\nHe did the campaigns. He had a campaigns class down there and I really took to him and working on that. We stayed in touch over the years. I think he is still there. But no, there wasn't a kind of galvanizing force, at least from my academic perspective.\n\nNelson\n\nWas Daron Shaw there then?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nBecause he ended up working in the '04 campaign.\n\nBartlett\n\nOh, sure.\n\nNelson\n\nMaybe others as well.\n\nBartlett\n\nYes. I actually saw him a few months ago.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nSo when you say you were in the minority, was that among students?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes. I distinctly remember in my government class during the '92 campaign they called us public enemy number one, two, and three—there were three of us. We sat at the back of the class. It was hilarious. One day he said, \"Who is for Bush?\" There were the three of us. We were the only three in the entire class. It was pretty funny. It kept us on our toes. But there wasn't, like I said, and you fast-forward a little bit. Before October '93, after the Bush oil stuff, we were working on quite a few statewide races, some larger races. There was a pretty obscure House member from the Texas legislature running for agriculture commissioner named Rick Perry. We worked on Rick Perry's campaign.\n\nInteresting that my first taste of the nastiness of politics was that we ended up, Karl ended up, being the general consultant and direct mail provider for a mayor of Plano, Texas, who ended up running for the state senate seat against Florence Shapiro. She was running against our family friend, and mine. He was a conservative Democrat, but not conservative enough in the way the change was. It was a nasty, nasty race. Accusations were flying back and forth. Karl was earning his reputation in very early days of being in the middle of a lot of that.\n\nTed wouldn't talk to me for at least—Shapiro defeated him. It was years before he would talk to me, and even that I would work for Karl Rove, much less work on that campaign. I tried to stay out of that campaign as much as I could. But I remember one of the accusations was that Ted had accepted a gift from a big real estate developer in town and it was a Cadillac. Ted denied that, never heard about having a Cadillac. I had ridden in the Cadillac with my friend. It was one of those awkward moments. I didn't want to be a fact witness in this deal. But it was my first taste of how politics could get tough.\n\nNelson\n\nAt this time direct mail was cutting-edge campaign technology.\n\nBartlett\n\nOh sure, absolutely.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nBartlett\n\nI was really the one who was doing the fact checking. Knowing that—obviously it was a little bit under the radar, and what was good about direct mail at the time and which you're incapable of doing today is you could have silo conversations with constituencies. If you're running a political campaign, you're basically trying to stack up constituencies to get 51 percent of the vote. But knowing that if you just look on the conservative side of that you had libertarians, you have social conservatives. You don't want to alienate one as you try to recruit another, and direct mail was a very precise, discrete way to deliver messages.\n\nIt was also a very discrete way to deliver negative messages against your opponent. Knowing that those would always get surfaced, it was important that we had all the substantiation of facts and things like that. A lot of my job was unearthing those facts and substantiating a lot of the mail pieces we were doing at the time. So it was just a lot of gofer-type work being the lowest man on the totem pole at Karl Rove and Company.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat made Rove emerge as such a leading consultant in Texas, first of all? What was it that made him stand out from the others?\n\nBartlett\n\nYou hear a lot about Karl's bandwidth, just an unbelievable bandwidth. I've never seen somebody who could go from the big strategic conversation, direction, down to the minutia of dotting i's and crossing t's on a mail piece and not missing a step in between and doing that across multiple candidates and at a level of chutzpah or confidence that you know some consultants have and some don't. Which is interesting because—I don't know how much we will get into this—Karl's and my relationship over 20 years has evolved quite a bit.\n\nIn many respects, he is a deeply insecure person, but he always made up for those insecurities in how he gave advice to candidates. He overcompensated, I think, which played to his benefit. There is no lack of confidence in his views and in his direction. It was interesting to see him evolve from running his own company to becoming a part of the campaign and part of the staff and team. He was very different at Karl Rove and Company in his office there.\n\nHe was a consultant. He had his firm and he was consultant on the first campaign for Governor. He was an outside entity during the first term—during the entire Governorship. It was only when the Presidential campaign hit a certain point that he sold his company and became a member of the staff. He was a very volatile person when he ran his own company. There were stories of people hiding under desks. He has a very volcanic-type temper. Highs and lows. He could be one of the best people to be around, fun, but it was definitely a roller coaster.\n\nThen when he came on board it was remarkable how that part of him never emerged again.\n\nNelson\n\nYou mean came on board in 2000?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes, throughout the Presidency. There were times when he had every right to explode. The pressure he was under during the leak investigation, things like that. Not even raise his voice.\n\nNelson\n\nHow do you account for that?\n\nBartlett\n\nI don't know. To tell you the truth, I think he probably recognized it is a different sense when you're the boss running your own organization and you have hiring and firing capabilities. He had a big foot in a small pie on the campaign, and he was obviously a force, but he wasn't entirely in charge. Maybe that was the difference he kind of rationalized in his mind. But those of us who were veterans of his firm, we were all sort of like where is that? Everyone is kind of waiting. When will it happen? It never really did.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat occurs to me is that Bush is not somebody who would want to see that behavior.\n\nBartlett\n\nThat's true. That's a fair point.\n\nNelson\n\nThe phone rings in '93 and it's George W. Bush.\n\nBartlett\n\nYes, the first time. The first phone call, now that I think about it, the first couple of days it was actually President [George H. W.] Bush 41. Yes, I guess it would have been—that's when it kind of registered: Maybe this Karl Rove guy is somebody I should—I kind of got lucky here.\n\nNelson: This is after Bush is out of office, Bush 41, or is he still President?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, this is when he's running for reelection. These are my early days. This is before the run-up to the '92 election. I'm like, Wow. It was a little bit later that Bush 43 calls. It was a \"Hey, is Karl there?\" type thing. It was probably over that summer of 1993 when he came by the office and I met him for the first time.\n\nMost people of my age at that time—I'm graduating from college. I want to get involved in politics. You're lucky to get an opportunity potentially to serve on one race. I was in a unique position, and Karl was very good to me to say, \"If you really want to get involved in politics, you do need to get on a campaign.\" At that time there was the Kay Bailey Hutchison special election race for the U.S. Senate seat. Then there was this talk of a long-shot bid for Governor by this guy George W. Bush to take on a very formidable incumbent in Ann Richards.\n\nHad I been smart and calculating about this, the smarter choice would have been to join Kay Bailey Hutchison's campaign. I had the opportunity to do one or the other. But I met George W. Bush. He came into the office and was just a normal guy. He was very friendly to me. In meeting him I thought, I'd rather work for this guy. So it was just dumb luck.\n\nActually I share this with a lot of young people now. I think people try to overengineer or orchestrate their career and say, \"I have to do this because of that.\" Sometimes just trusting your instincts is good. That time it was just a gut instinct. I had already heard she was not particularly a nice person to work for, so that was an easy one. At that time, there were a lot of people who were very dismissive of his chances of winning the Governorship.\n\nNelson\n\nYou're good-looking enough, Dan, you could have been one of her purse boys. [laughter]\n\nBartlett\n\nThe stories around that—it could be a whole other day. A girlfriend at a later time was Kay Bailey's scheduler, and the stories are just outrageous. She's an interesting lady. So yes, when that started to take form it was really the nucleus of that campaign that started in Karl's office. We were preparing for him. He made the announcement that he was going to run for Governor exactly, I think, a year out from the Election Day in 1993. In October '93 two other staffers and I were feverishly trying to pull together what would be something that could be a part of his announcement speech, getting facts put together.\n\nThey hired a guy—he turned out to be the policy director from the Governor's office—[T.] Vance McMahon, and Vance was working out of Andrews Kurth law firm in Houston. To tell the truth, I forgot how Karl got connected to Vance, but Vance came in, and at that time Israel Hernandez, the travel aide, was being hired up in Dallas.\n\nAt this time Bush is living in Dallas, and we're in Austin. That was really the beginning of that campaign. Brian Berry was brought on after that. The team started to be built, but that was the whole start.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you get a sense about why George W. Bush wanted to be Governor?\n\nBartlett\n\nI didn't have the type of access at that point that I could understand what was making him tick. I would say that when I saw him either privately or even a little bit publicly in those early days it wasn't ever any of this, \"I have to follow in the footsteps\" or \"I'm obligated to run.\"\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBartlett\n\nIt was more that we were fairly religious about the issues on which he was going to campaign, the four issues at the time: education reform, juvenile justice reform, welfare reform, and tort reform. But particularly education was one that he really came alive on.\n\nHaving grown up in Dallas and being a Rangers fan, I knew about his connections with the ball club and those things, and the building of the stadium, which was interesting. It all came full circle, because as it evolved I became the keeper of the record in all things Bush in the personal world, which was—when people ask me—I don't know if I'm jumping ahead. I'll be jumping back and forth.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's why we do this for a day and a half.\n\nBartlett\n\nI'm often asked about how did you, at your age, leapfrog several rungs of people and become part of the inner circle? Frankly, what did it more than anything—I'd like to sit here and tell you it was because I was that much smarter than everybody else, my brilliance kind of burst through, it was obvious. It really wasn't the case.\n\nWhat happened was very early on in the campaign I picked up—we had the established gubernatorial campaign and its headquarters outside of Karl's now and it was being—it was operated. I was an early morning guy, so I would always get to the campaign office before anybody else, 6:30, 6:45 in the morning. I learned pretty quickly that Bush was an early guy. The phone would start ringing at the campaign headquarters. I could hear it ringing in every office. It wasn't ringing in mine, but I started to pick it up and it would be him. \"Who's that?\" He'd say, \"Barty?\" That's his nickname. That's when he started calling me \"Barty.\" \"What's going on down there?\" I'd say, \"I'm the only one here.\" He'd say, \"God dang it.\"\n\nWe'd get going. But then he'd start asking me, \"What's going on? What's in the papers?\" I never really told people. He and I would talk almost every morning. He'd call the campaign and want to know what's going on, give me some scuttlebutt about what's happening. So for a guy who was coming in on a very entry-level position—I was in the policy apparatus at that time and helping again just as we were building out those four planks and what would constitute a campaign agenda and platform.\n\nI was not in any position of authority or anything like that, but I had this back channel of communications with him that forged a little bit of a personal relationship with the candidate that really nobody else outside of the top leadership had. It wasn't for a while that people picked up on it. I would know stuff that was going on and I would tell him about stuff that was going on. It would be little stuff—obviously we're not talking about advice or strategy.\n\nIt would be more like, \"What's Richard saying today? What's in the news? What's going on around there? Who's-dating-who?\" type thing. So we kind of struck up a relationship. We'd talk sports or this or that. A level of familiarity and trust emerged. Somehow—I can't tell you when or how it officially happened, but through that process I started to become kind of the keeper of the record.\n\nFor some reason I became the ombudsman for all the kooks around. The Bush trilateral commission, any kind of conspiracy that was leveled against the Bush family, I took these calls and all that. He always had an interest in the type of incoming we'd get on that. Then that evolved over a period of time in which I slowly gained access to his circle of friends and his spheres of life, around his business career and those things.\n\nAs we were looking particularly, we knew that his reelection as Governor was going to be a testing ground for national Democrats. The speculation was very ripe at the time that they were going to test run some themes on him during the reelection. So we were preparing for the reelection. At that time I had left the Governor's office and went back to the reelection committee and served as issues director. But really my job was the defender of the record and those things, to anticipate and be prepared for attacks. They were using Gary Mauro as kind of a vessel for these attacks from the DNC [Democratic National Committee] and others.\n\nIt was through that process, preparing for that, that I gained a lot of access to—that's when I really forged my first relationship with Harriet Miers, because Harriet was his personal lawyer at the time. Between Harriet and me, we were doing a fairly methodical process. This is where I had the joy of picking up the National Guard account. That was actually while I was in the Governor's office because he was—Joe Allbaugh was chief of staff, and we were the liaison to the National Guard. Not as in the case of his own personal service, but as commander of the Texas National Guard. So my familiarity with how the National Guard worked through that process, the Governor's office, and then from a political standpoint, the ensuing allegations and attack around his own service.\n\nThat came up a bit in '94, but not anywhere near what we thought or anticipated in the future. It was through this process when I'm spending time out in Midland, Texas, and in Arlington with [John Thomas] Tom Schieffer and others who were part of the Texas Rangers baseball organization, with members of Harken Energy and others who were part of his career. I was just put in a unique position to essentially get to know more about George W. Bush than anybody else on our campaign staff outside of his family.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBartlett\n\nHis race for Congress against Kent Hance, all of those different things. So it was through that opportunity and responsibilities that I just forged a relationship with him that was probably unheard of for a staffer my age. It really was during that reelection campaign going into the Presidential campaign that I had one foot in policy but was starting to put another foot into the communications realm and developing a relationship with Karen [Hughes] that that all kind of evolved from.\n\nNelson\n\nI have a question about '94. That is, where did those four themes come from and how did they end up being the four themes? No matter what the question was, the answer was already there, those four.\n\nBartlett\n\nTwo things. One was Vance McMahon and Karl based on research in a pretty good—Karl's network of state legislators both in the House and the Senate, knowing what was doable, what was ripe, what was from a standpoint of you didn't want to put out an agenda that you couldn't actually act upon. In all four of those areas there was a real appetite for reform. There was also a strategic analysis that we knew that based on her past campaigns she wanted this to be a contest of personalities, not one on substance.\n\nWhat we couldn't appreciate at the time, which was just gifted to us, was that she made no real attempt at trying to articulate a second-term agenda. That was just the biggest gift we could have ever—when she ran against [James] Mattox she was very good at, and very disciplined at, turning the terms of the debate around to personalities. I don't think anybody expected George W. Bush at that time to be as disciplined as he turned out to be, to stay on those four issues. There was a strategy to say we know through research that these four issues resonate with the public. There is a real opportunity for change. It also gives him a safe harbor to say, \"Look, keep staying on these. Don't get pulled into the debate.\"\n\nNow, one challenge we did have that we lived up to the very last day in the White House: He is not a natural orator. To get his sea legs, Karl had a very smart strategy. We started in small towns and in small county seats where he was still kind of a rock star by name, but also the press wasn't going to be as tough and he could get his sea legs. We spent a big majority of those early days just doing that, getting his sea legs in those rural county seats. It would be one reporter for the entire county. We'd sit down over a cup of coffee. It gave him a chance to really hone his message in an environment that was manageable.\n\nMy first—it's a great story—I don't know if it's in any—didn't Karen write a book about his—\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nBartlett\n\nSo many books. My first kind of crisis communication was when he shot the wrong bird. I was in charge of that event.\n\nRiley\n\nIn charge of the hunt or the—?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes, the whole thing. One of the things we were hammering her on was the penal code got its largest rewrite in like 20 years. They started this whole state jail felony system. There were all those laws. It was going to lessen penalties for certain crimes, which in the long term was probably the right policy, but politically it was a real opportunity for us.\n\nI remember the laws were to go into effect on the same day as opening day of dove season in the fall campaign. So our logic was what a great photo op it would be to have law enforcement officials who have enforced us—we did this right outside of Houston, right outside of Harris County. We had prosecutors, country judges. We had a Bush law enforcement coalition come and do a dove hunt in the morning and then press conference, talking about we're going to be tough on crime, all these guys with guns, sheriffs and everything. This was going to be perfect. We were then going to do another press conference in Dallas later that day.\n\nWe knew also that Ann Richards always went on a dove hunt. The funny thing about that was Ann Richards was hunting on a piece of property from that old state senator who we had beaten who was my friend. She was hunting on property that I grew up hunting on myself. It came back to be an interesting perspective.\n\nSo we set up the event. President Bush, I want to say that he was just returning from—I think he had gone on a West Coast fundraising trip. I think he went out to California to raise money. They flew him in the night before. We were staying in—I think it was like a Motel 6. I remember because it was one of those where the door opens up right to the parking lot. The night before he says, \"I haven't shot a shotgun—\" he knew how to hunt. \"I haven't done this in a while, and our version of dove hunting back in the day was what can we kill quicker, a case of beer or a dove out in West Texas?\"\n\nWe had a shotgun there and it wasn't his because he had been in California. He didn't have time to go get his gun in Dallas and all that, which Ann Richards later tried to make a big deal of, that he had to borrow a gun. We go over the night before. I remember it was an overcast day. We get out there and it is like a circus. We had 20 cameras with us. It's hard enough to shoot a bird on a perfect day, but when you have this whole circus behind you—\n\nAnyway, we're waiting. Finally there were three doves and there was a bird trailing. Shoots the bird. Everybody says, \"Yes, shot the bird.\" All the lights were on us. No one knew at the time what had happened. There was a guide. The guide went out there and he obviously knew because he saw the—he freaked out and panicked and that's when he pulled out another bird that had been shot.\n\nRiley\n\nSubstitute.\n\nBartlett\n\nSubstituted it. So Bush didn't know. None of us knew. We do the press conference, hammer on crime. I'm on cloud nine. This is one of the first events that I was in charge of and all that—me and another guy named Abel Guerra. We're back in the hotel packing the cars. He has to get to the airport because they're flying to Dallas to do another press conference. He's asking, \"What are we hearing about Richards? What are they doing?\"\n\nI'm packing the car and I hear this, \"Bartlett, get in here.\" Karen is in there. He says, \"Did I shoot the wrong bird? Did I shoot the wrong bird? They're saying I shot the wrong bird.\" I had no idea. It turns out that the local Fox photographer or cameraman went back to the studio in Houston. They're doing the video and they're slowing it down and some guy in the production room who knows birds says, \"Stop that. That's not a dove.\" They started looking at it and they're the ones who first detected it. They called Karen or the press office and said, \"We believe that George W. Bush shot the wrong bird.\" It turned out to be this killdeer. By the end of the news cycle you would have thought he shot a bald eagle. It was called a protected bird, but a killdeer is a very common bird. I don't want to be disrespectful, but they're not an endangered species by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nHe is freaking out. \"What are we doing here?\" This was Karen really showing her media chops. \"You need to get on the phone with every one of these reporters and you have to make light of this.\" I remember Ken Herman from the Austin American-Statesman came. He was on the ground rolling, laughing about the whole thing. They came up with the phrase, \"I'm glad I wasn't deer hunting or I might have shot a cow.\" He tried to really make fun of himself, but privately he was pissed at himself. There was no one else he could be mad at.\n\nBut the whole problem now was, did he violate the law? He said, \"You have to go back to the 'scene of the crime' and figure this out.\" He gave me a blank check and signed it and said, \"Whatever the fine is, fill it out. Let's take care of this.\" So I go back out to the field. They get on the plane. First he's like, \"Oh, and Ann Richards is going to shoot a bird—\" I said, \"Don't worry, one thing I can be assured is they're not going to shoot any birds. I've been going to open-ended season there for a decade and there's never any birds.\" And he says, \"I guarantee you, they're going to shoot a bird.\" Sure enough, it came out they all got bored up there. The media convinced Ann to shoot the gun in the air for a photo op, but she was just shooting the gun in the air, which turned out to be an interesting moment.\n\nWe get back. I go out to the field. This poor guide is beside himself. \"I didn't know what to do. I panicked.\" He's fine. The game warden comes out there and he said, \"I don't know what to do. No one has ever been caught on camera shooting a killdeer. We're going to have to go downtown.\" So we all get in cars, we all drive down to the magistrate's office downtown. We get in this room—\n\nRiley\n\nDowntown where?\n\nBartlett\n\nHouston. We go in this room and they all say, \"Look, we don't know what to do.\" I think, OK, here's my first test. They said, \"It can be a—\" We said, \"We're not going to get off. We want him to pay.\" They said, \"The maximum penalty is $1,000.\" I said, \"Whoa, whoa, it was just a killdeer. A thousand dollars?\" First they were saying we don't need to pay anything. I said, \"No, we're going to pay something.\" They said, \"Five dollars.\"\n\nI said, \"No, that's not—\" So they said, \"Give me a thousand dollars.\" Whoa, I don't know about that. So I came up with, \"I remember from hunting a lot of times if you go over your limit and stuff it is usually about a $100 fine and then $35 of court fines or something like that.\" They all said, \"That sounds very reasonable.\" So it turned out to be roughly around $135. I fill it out and they're all, I remember, \"Can we take a picture with the check?\" So we all take a picture with this George W. Bush check paying the fine.\n\nRiley\n\nShould have gotten one of those—\n\nBartlett\n\nSo we pay the fine. We get that done. I drive all the way back to Austin to the headquarters and everybody there just—\"Oh, Bartlett, we send you on one freaking event, here it is, and you have him shoot the wrong bird.\" I said, \"I can put the guy in the field. I can't pull the trigger.\" But there was a lot of anxiety that this was going to be the moment that we really screwed up.\n\nIf you recall, the battleground for Texas at that time was east Texas because that's where you had Blue Dog Democrats, conservative Democrats. This is where the shift was really happening to Republicans. Essentially what it did, which we didn't fully appreciate in those early hours, but came to appreciate as the week unfolded, was it humanized George W. Bush. He made a mistake that a lot of hunters have all made a mistake doing. He owned up to it, he made fun of himself, and she was crass and, \"Oh, poor George.\" Her handling of it—she shot the gun in the air as a photo op and the whole thing. What we thought was going to be a turning point for the worse actually galvanized a part of his personality and humanity that people at that time needed to see. It was really a fascinating development.\n\nNelson\n\nI was thinking, Karen Hughes—and I don't know if she was the only one, but her quick reaction. I wonder to what extent that was based on her experience on the news—\n\nBartlett\n\nOh sure, there's no doubt about it. Her being a television reporter, those skills kicked in, and that's where I first began to learn how to do that part of the job, which I ultimately ended up doing later. She was really good on her toes. That was one of her real talents.\n\nNelson\n\nShe could see the second-day story and the third-day story.\n\nBartlett\n\nExactly.\n\nNelson\n\nIf you all didn't do what you did.\n\nBartlett\n\nExactly. As we were driving to the airport he was calling every one of those reporters and talking to them himself, not trying to spin it, just trying to make light of it. But you had a scene behind the scenes. He was calling me, \"What's going on? What's going on?\" I'm like—\"Downtown? Why are you going downtown?\" So for me personally it was—\n\nNelson\n\nBaptism by fire.\n\nBartlett\n\nIt was.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you came through it.\n\nBartlett\n\nOh, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nSo it's a success story for you as well as for the Governor.\n\nBartlett\n\nAbsolutely. That was just kind of trusting my instincts and figuring it out. What I learned there was I liked being in the middle of the action. That was a high. I was still afraid for my job at that point.\n\nRiley\n\nYou're how old at this point?\n\nBartlett\n\nI was 21, 22 years old. Wet behind the ears.\n\nRiley\n\nDid Mr. Bush know that you had saved him about $800?\n\nBartlett\n\nI told him the whole story.\n\nNelson\n\nProbably thought you cost him $130.\n\nBartlett\n\nWe ended up doing stuff because we developed this personal relationship. I worked in the policy office. He was a big runner at the time. We were at an event on a Saturday morning when he was Governor and he was getting his knee scoped and he couldn't run in the Capitol 10,000, the big Austin race. I was going to run in it. We got to talking. He's a competitive guy, and he said, \"How fast do you think you can run this thing?\" I said, \"I'm going to run it faster than you did last year.\" He goes, \"I'll bet you a hundred bucks.\" I said, \"Fine. I'll bet you a hundred bucks.\"\n\nAt that time I was not running fast enough to—he was a good runner at the time. That was on a Saturday morning. We were speaking to some law enforcement group there in Austin. By about ten o'clock on Monday morning the entire capitol knew that there was a bet between Governor Bush and me about whether—and he was going to be the honorary starter of it. I had three weeks to get in race shape. I remember he was at the starting line. I had headphones on. I like to run with music on. He said, \"I've never seen anybody run a sub-42:30 with headphones on. I don't want to hear about any excuses about the crowds and all that.\" He was trying to get in my head.\n\nSo I got up at the very front. I panicked because that's where the fast guys go out. I ran the first mile like in six minutes and five seconds. Then I panicked that I was going to run out of—I ended up beating it. He always had a big barbeque at the mansion afterward. He signed my number—I have it somewhere. It said, \"To Fleetfoot, great race.\" I have his check. Never cashed the check; I had it framed.\n\nHe's just competitive. It's that type of personal relationship that he really spent time on developing with his staff. When people ask me, \"How did you stay with this guy this long? The average stay in the West Wing is what, for senior staff, a little over two years? Something like that. You do it for seven.\" It's these kinds of bonding relationships that started very early that made you endure.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me ask you a question about that. I'm taken by the extent to which your relationship with him develops out of these early morning phone calls and your ability—I guess if he ever sensed that you were trying to leverage those calls into something to feather your own nest he would have terminated them immediately.\n\nBartlett\n\nProbably.\n\nRiley\n\nThere was a sense of confidence that emerged from these things. I'm thinking about this in relation to the fact that he also had very close staffing relationships with women. He was surrounded by powerful women. I can't quite square those two things. It seems to me that the kind of relationship that you had with him was almost a kind of—you see the term \"locker room\" thrown around occasionally. The women aren't in the locker room. How do you reconcile these two aspects of this man's operating style when he's Governor?\n\nBartlett\n\nHe treated all of us the same. Unfortunately, Karen and they got pulled into the locker room probably more than they wanted to. It may be part of it. I don't want to get too—I don't want you all to bring a couch in here and lie down, but my parents divorced at an early age. I was not close with my father. He only had daughters. I'm not going to say it was a father-son type of relationship, but we bonded in a way that was interesting.\n\nWhat was interesting also was that things that he had a lot of passion for—for example, things that Karl for example wasn't very—Karl is a book man. He was a nerd. He didn't talk baseball or Longhorn football or this or that. In some way I think I filled a little bit of a void there with some of the folks. Not to say that there weren't others like Don Evans and people like that. I know there has been a lot of commentary about his relationship with powerful women and whether it came from his mother being such a dominant personality. Maybe so. But at the time it never looked like he was making a special effort to pull in strong women voices.\n\nRiley\n\nIt was just a natural part of how he—\n\nBartlett\n\nIt really was.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you ever recall any circumstances where the women felt excluded from these types of communications? You could envision a situation in which these early morning conversations are going on, you're out running with the Governor. Maybe you're having breakfast at midnight after a long day at the capitol and the women aren't included. They might feel resentful of that.\n\nBartlett\n\nIf they weren't getting their own access at times, maybe so. You have to think about the personalities of these women. These weren't shrinking violets. Margaret Spellings, Margaret LaMontagne at the time, later Condi [Condoleezza Rice], Karen, and what was her name—she was on the campaign, [Jennifer] Dunn. She was a former 41. They could hold their own. That was part of the commonality of all these women; these weren't shrinking violets. Were there others who felt like they were on the outside looking in? Maybe, but I never detected it, nor was it raised, the idea that there's the good old boys and I can't break through.\n\nNelson\n\nI have a couple of questions about '94. One is, at the beginning of the campaign—Bush had run for Congress once. Granted, it was 16 years earlier, and he had been involved in a pretty hands-on way on his father's Presidential campaigns, at least one of them, maybe both of them. What do you think he brought to his candidacy based on those earlier experiences, if anything? You say he was not ready for the big city in terms of oratorical ability, but what do you think he knew from experience that a candidate otherwise might not have known?\n\nBartlett\n\nIt really spanned the spectrum of little things, like details around events, things that he saw from his father. You show up on time, you stay late. You have to build—knowing what the pace of a candidate would be like, how we built his schedule, things like that. A candidate doing it for the first time just wouldn't know what questions to ask. So on the tactics of it there is a familiarity. Strategically, the lesson he mostly took away from his race for Congress was don't let your opponent define you.\n\nHe was very keen on responding to attacks, defending ourselves, and always having what is our message today. He was very tuned in to message discipline, what that meant, at a level that a candidate running for statewide office for the first time just wouldn't appreciate. So those things jump out at me. Essentially, when you're at that level, even though he wasn't the candidate, you can anticipate things that others can't. I always likened him to—I don't know if you play golf, but a golfer's swing can either be a feel swing or they're mechanical. Bush doesn't have a mechanical swing. It is a feel. His feel and his instincts in those things were always good. He really knew when to trust them.\n\nI would say that in that entire political career that I was involved with him I can only remember one period that I'm sure we'll get to later where his instincts let him down, and that was during Katrina. Every other time we were always better off trusting his instincts on things. You either have it, or you don't. Bill Clinton had it.\n\nWe knew that he was a fantastic—he got his energy in those things from being a retail politician and doing that part of the business. So in the early days he had a very definitive view of how he wanted to run campaigns. A lot of it was based on his loss and then how his father ran his own. Does that make sense?\n\nNelson\n\nYes, and I wonder too what he learned from running that first gubernatorial race against a very formidable candidate that stood him in good stead six years later.\n\nBartlett\n\nYou know, it probably was more than anything else the message discipline—that you have to really—he'd say, \"I'm so tired of mentioning those four issues that I'm going to puke if I have to say them again.\" We'd say that's when it's just starting to push through. To have it validated. Then we passed laws in all four areas that really got cemented in his mind, as we prepared for a Presidential run, that you have to have that discipline. Particularly if you're going to beat somebody as formidable as Ann Richards. It just proved that that strategy could work.\n\nRiley\n\nHe also wanted a disciplined organization around him. Is that correct?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you recall any instances—\n\nBartlett\n\nDiscipline—I actually think it started in the Governor's office. He wanted the anti-[John] Sununu organization. He did not want a gatekeeper. He always talked about how I'm going to have access to my staff. He always really blamed the fact that his father didn't get access to advice he needed at the time because Sununu and maybe other Chiefs of Staff, but Sununu's name always came up. He would serve too much as a gatekeeper and filtered what got to him.\n\nRiley\n\nThis was as early as the—\n\nBartlett\n\nOh, yes. Absolutely. When he is Governor, his first year as Governor in 1995. He operated that office—Joe Allbaugh you would think was kind of like a security guard. He is a big, imposing guy, but he had no authority in keeping people from accessing Governor Bush. That was the style of management that he kept in place until his last days in office as President. What I said about sometimes you can overcorrect, I would say that—and I probably did myself. We took advantage of that access at times too much.\n\nRiley\n\nEarly or late? Are you talking about Texas or D.C.?\n\nBartlett\n\nLate. D.C. I'm sure you sat down with Andy [Card] and President Bush. He made it very clear to Andy, \"You're not going to choke off my Texas people. I'm going to have access.\" I think with that signal, Andy didn't manage the Texas crew like he probably should have. We probably could have used a little more belt-tightening when it comes to me and Karen. Early on, Karen, Karl, me, and whatnot. There was a healthy, competitive tension between Karen and Karl and then later Karl and me. I was caught very much in the middle of that as you can probably imagine.\n\nHe was very firm very early on about the structure and the access. He also set a very clear tone early on about how he wanted to be—\n\nRiley\n\nEarly on in Texas or—\n\nBartlett\n\nTexas, I'm sorry. One of the projects I had early on was we were looking at Texas' economic development capabilities in the department—I don't remember—Texas Economic Development Department or Commerce or something like that. I was charged with helping pull together a modernization of that capability in Texas. I had written a four-page memo on this whole thing. He said, \"Son, if you can't make your points in less than a page and a half, then you don't know what you're talking about.\" He gave me the memo back and said, \"Go work on this.\"\n\nPeople always viewed that as Bush is not intellectually in it, he just wants one-pagers or this or that. It was more a process to make you really try to understand what you're trying to communicate and what you're trying to recommend. If you can't succinctly make your point in a page and a half, that's on you, not on me. So it was a process that he pushed on us.\n\nPunctuality was one of his biggest pet peeves that he picked up from his father. The rudest thing in the world is to make somebody wait. We left people on tarmacs who weren't on time. We left somebody in Abilene; I can't remember who it was. We're taking off. They weren't there; we're gone. He was legendary for that.\n\nWhat was best about him from a management standpoint was you always knew where you stood with him. If he was mad, you were going to know. I used to say his temper was like a West Texas storm. It would come, it could be violent, but it was gone pretty quick. That was his style. He'd let you know. Then 10 minutes later there weren't any doubts about where you stood, and then that's behind us. Over life I've had a lot of different—not everybody is that way as a manager. He was very easy to read, Mrs. [Laura] Bush not. She was harder to read. I always tell people I was more afraid of her than him any day; she could be intimidating.\n\nRiley\n\nOh, yes?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nGive an example of that, even though it is out of the chronology.\n\nBartlett\n\nYou just never knew.\n\nNelson\n\nIt will take everybody by surprise.\n\nBartlett\n\nShe didn't suffer fools very gingerly—I'm trying to think of a specific anecdote. It was interesting, I was looking over the timeline. One of the events that is highlighted in there was election night 2004. The whole decision—in the middle of the night there was a breathless attempt to roll Bush out there and declare victory. There was a very small minority saying we can't do that. It was a pretty fierce debate. Laura Bush walked in and just said, \"George, you can't go out there,\" and walked off. Everybody was like, \"OK, we have the answer.\" [laughter] I was in the minority at the time on that view.\n\nRiley\n\nYou cheered the decision, right? The tape doesn't pick up the action.\n\nBartlett\n\nThere's a whole story behind that night that I'm sure we'll get to. She was just hard to read. It was harder to tell where you stood with her. Always pleasant. Her tone never got high or low. You can read him; it's visceral. With her she just keeps her cards close to her chest. I have a deep amount of respect for her. I never had any indication that she didn't like me, but a lot of times you sat around wondering why when you'd get the call that the First Lady would like to talk to you. I would wrack my brain over a call from her. When he called us, not a big deal.\n\nNelson\n\nYou said that in '98 the national Democrats knew Bush was coming and tried to use that Garry Mauro campaign as a vehicle for attacking Bush. How did that manifest itself? What was Bush attacked for and how did you all handle that in '98?\n\nBartlett\n\nThere were themes around—they really started going against his business career, the Rangers and Harken and failed energy. It started in a way that Richards never really got any traction on, going after his biography. It was hard for them because it was hard for them to penetrate his first term. He had had bipartisan success. He had Bob Bullock essentially endorsing him for reelection over Garry Mauro. I think he was the godfather to one of Garry Mauro's children. Just unheard of political support in the state on both sides of the aisle, a track record that, as I said before, things all got acted upon. The state of the economy at the time was good. They really were testing the themes around his business career and other things that he basically had not done anything.\n\nThen the National Guard stuff started to emerge again, not full-throated, but they were planting seeds around that as well. That gave us a relatively calm setting, and frankly we wanted some of these issues to surface so we could validate with election saying the voters heard that and it has been dismissed. We actually wanted to get some of that stuff on the table knowing we were going to win and win big. We could just sweep—it was pretty naive on our part that that was going to solve those issues going into the Presidential.\n\nThen the biggest lesson, the biggest thing that he really impressed upon us was that he wasn't going to make this mistake that Richards made, which was take for granted a second term. He was very aggressive, we were very aggressive, in articulating a second-term agenda and eschewing any sort of talk about national intentions or ambitions. We were very disciplined about that as well.\n\nNelson\n\nAt what point did you become the person whose job it was to—I'm thinking about this in terms of anticipatory opposition research of your own guy. When did that begin?\n\nBartlett\n\nWhen I left the state house and joined the election committee, so this would have been right after the '97 legislative session completed. It would have been June of '97-ish.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen did you learn, for example, about drunk driving?\n\nBartlett\n\nThat was some time later. It was before the Presidential campaign started in earnest. I want to say it was after the '98 reelection, but it could—no, now that I think about that, we discussed whether we should put it out there before the '98 election and the decision was not to, which ultimately, in hindsight, was a mistake.\n\nRiley\n\nHe made the decision himself?\n\nBartlett\n\nHe did.\n\nRiley\n\nYou think Laura was complicit in that?\n\nBartlett\n\nProbably, but I don't fully accept his explanation. This was a big part of it. He didn't want it out there sending a signal to his daughters that you can get away and still run and become President. I think in his heart of hearts he didn't think it would get out. There had been investigative reporters and others, op [opposition] research guys digging all over Texas for stuff. He lived in Houston during the party days, Midland, Dallas. They'll never look in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\nI hit him on that before. I said, \"You just didn't think you were going to get caught?\" \"Naw,\" he'd bark at me. But there, in my heart of hearts, I truly believe that, which is any politician running—\n\nNelson\n\nHow did you find out about it?\n\nBartlett\n\nKaren.\n\nNelson\n\nHow did she find out?\n\nBartlett\n\nHim. I don't remember the first day what it was like when he told them, but I remember there was a conversation about it. Karen called me. I don't remember if I was actually where there was a huddle because what we should have done was done an event with Mothers Against Drunk Driving and couple it with an awareness campaign. I've had these. There was a discussion about that, but just decided not to do it. I don't remember a big moment, but I remember Karen called me just as the decision had been made, or before, and wanted to get my feedback on it. But yes. I don't know if that was one of those times where staff just didn't push back hard enough.\n\nThere is always that perception that those who are closest—the current President is getting this criticism—they're too loyal, they just tell them what they want to hear. Nothing could be further from the truth. We were the only ones who didn't have the fear of walking in there and telling the President of the United States that he was wrong on something. I actually think there is a critical role for the most loyal and trusted aides to be there because they are the only ones who actually have that level of trust and comfort to deliver that.\n\nMaybe in that moment we failed him because that was a long day when that came out. We can go through it because it was interesting. Whenever you want to.\n\nNelson\n\nOne last thing. One thing that seems to have worked is that there weren't stories coming out about when Bush was drinking heavily, bar fights or groping women or any of the things that I'm sure reporters were looking for in connection with somebody who at one time drank too much. Usually you'd think that would manifest itself in some bad behavior, but I don't remember anything like that.\n\nBartlett\n\nI think the big fear—where they were going the most was during his days in Houston when he was in the Guard, he was living at the apartment complex where he met Laura Bush and we talked about it. He said, \"Look—\" He never feared that there was going to be some disclosure about him doing hard-core drugs, but he went to a lot of parties where drugs were being done. We always feared that somebody would say, \"I saw him at a party doing—\" line of attack. I talked to a lot of his buddies back then just to validate that if something like that emerged that we could have other voices say, \"No, I was there\" type stuff. I never really feared that there was something else out there, particularly after learning about the DUI [driving under the influence]. I knew that the DUI was. Outside of that—\n\nRiley\n\nCan I ask, was there anything else that we didn't find out about?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, not that I know of. Look, he chased skirt and drank a lot, but not anything that I ever came across. I imagine there is a lot to discuss about the National Guard service. Was there a lot of favoritism happening in the National Guard, in Texas politics at the time? Absolutely. Did he ask for favors? No. Did he get preferential treatment in some circumstances? Or that some might consider he was? Hard to deny that the commanders at the time knew who he was and those things. But did he do what others didn't do and become a pilot and have to perform a lot more than most of them like Lloyd Bentsen's son who was a pencil pusher behind a desk? He did more.\n\nNow, was he proud of his final year of service and was he committed? No. I don't think he liked that. There was a lot of did he show up type stuff, but did he abdicate his responsibilities? No. I never feared that there was—I talked to General [Walter B. Buck] Staudt before he died and the guys involved in this. That was a different time and culture and those guys were running hard, partying hard, and doing what they were doing. But it never dawned on me that—nor did I ever fear that there was going to be some sort of damning, explosive development around either of those two issues.\n\nNow there were times when I was worried that our recollection and providing of events, how they unfolded, could be contradicted. The 60 Minutes story made us all pause. The records were horrible, not just his but in general. I learned a lot of that as it was going through. I know people made accusations that I was destroying documents and all. It was just crazy talk. One particular individual said that they literally saw me at National Guard headquarters shredding, Joe Allbaugh and I were described—just crazy kind of allegations.\n\nThat was just a story that would never go away. It was amazing. Every single election some new element of that came up.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have to trail this in Alabama also?\n\nBartlett\n\nI never went to Alabama. I talked to people; I talked to his girlfriend at the time. There were very few people I didn't talk to, but I didn't have to travel to Alabama. I remember when we found those records that proved—the dentist report. I'll never forget my best line, \"I don't know if you were there, but your teeth sure were.\" [laughter] He died laughing on that one. It was one that he used.\n\nRiley\n\nThere were two or three things in general that I wanted to touch on, and I don't really even know how to ask a question about this. You're dealing with a Texan who has out-of-state roots also, Connecticut and Washington, D.C. That was used against him certainly in the Congressional race. Was it a problem for him? In your experience, you're a Texan I guess. Not born in Texas, but raised in Texas.\n\nBartlett\n\nHe used to remind me when I would question his credentials. \"Where are you from? Illinois?\" I'd say, \"I was six months old when I got here.\" We'd fight over that.\n\nRiley\n\nBut he was a Texan? Is a Texan?\n\nBartlett\n\nYou know, people can see through it if you're not. Actually even at times I think his father never until much later truly felt comfortable in his Texas roots. It was authentic. Did he have a little bit of a chip on his shoulder about it? Yes, because he probably hated the fact of where he was born and all that and wished that he was born in Midland. But based on his own passion and the validators being his friends and those who—almost all are going to say, \"He's all right, he's one of us\" early on. We'd laugh about it, and like I said we'd poke fun at it, but he never really got defensive about it.\n\nRiley\n\nGot you. The corollary issue is his education.\n\nBartlett\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich sort of relates to his own conception of his own intellect. A lot of people were criticizing him for his intellect or lack thereof. It strikes me—I'll just throw this out as a proposition. It's sort of conventionally Southern to wear your intellect lightly. Is that your understanding of the man that you came to know?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes. It's the difference between are you book smart and those things. His grades obviously weren't something he's proud of, but at the same time if you spent any time with him—it would have been a bigger issue if he actually wasn't smart. So you got reassured very early. My big challenge was that from the outset he is not a natural communicator, and the malaprops and those things exacerbated that narrative. But early on, his lesson in politics is lower expectations. They want to call me dumb? Call me dumb.\n\nIt was part of the strategy too, which we probably took to too high a level. But every time—we just got lucky in both cases that we were gifted such interesting opponents in Al Gore and John Kerry. Intellectually there couldn't have been a better contrast. Now, had there been another candidate that maybe could have gone toe-to-toe on that everyday man familiarity, that was always our calling card. May not like everything George W. Bush did, but I can relate to him, have a beer with him. That always played to our benefit.\n\nNelson\n\nI think [John] McCain might have been a tougher candidate in that way in the 2000 primaries. Harder to brand as an elitist.\n\nBartlett\n\nOh yes.\n\nNelson\n\nSomebody who didn't know what real life was like.\n\nBartlett\n\nYes. Luckily he had other weaknesses that we were able to—I saw Senator McCain last week and we had lunch and talked about some of those old days. He totally underestimated Bush as a candidate. He admits it to this day.\n\nNelson\n\nDid he tell you that?\n\nBartlett\n\nWe've talked about it before.\n\nNelson\n\nI know we'll come back and fill in some blanks, but go with this if you will. What were the weaknesses McCain had, and in what ways did he underestimate Bush?\n\nBartlett\n\nThe hardest thing is that you couldn't really talk about his weaknesses publicly because people would always construe it as attacking his temperament because of his POW [prisoner of war] service. I have no idea if it has anything to do with this, but it was not hard to get under John McCain's skin. He is a volatile person who wears his emotion on his sleeve. He is about one of the most undisciplined, in that regard, candidates or political figures that I've seen and that we had seen. That was easy to exploit.\n\nThen they had a terrible strategy in 2000. They didn't have a choice really, but his whole \"straight talk express\" and those things, it was the process of how he was running that became the reason he was running. I'm going to be the guy who is successful telling you how it is and all this. But when you basically cede control of your narrative to the media—he traveled with them every day. He let them in the bus. They controlled his message every day and we just took advantage of it completely.\n\nI know there is a lot of talk about the dirty politics in South Carolina. I spent 21 days after we lost in New Hampshire. I got deployed to South Carolina and was part of the team on the ground there. Were there third-party activities going on there? Yes. Did we have control over it? No. But there were some things being said about Bush that I know McCain didn't have control over. I never was this blunt to McCain himself later, but what always worried me about him being President—I voted for him, but I was reluctant—was that on the big things, and this is hard for people to appreciate, the President only makes probably a handful of big, monumental decisions as President. You can count them on your hand, usually. I'd sleep well at night with John McCain making those big decisions. War, things like that, big stuff.\n\nThe Presidency is the millions of small decisions you make that are very relevant. I don't mean small in the sense they don't have consequences, but they're just routine. It takes an enormous amount of discipline and interest, which was interesting because a lot of people didn't think Bush had the intellectual firepower or interest to do that process. In fact it was quite the opposite. He was very disciplined about taking every one of those little decisions very seriously. I just never trusted that McCain would. Those steer the direction of the Presidency more so than the big ones at times.\n\nIt's interesting. You just wouldn't think that his—and he told me, he said, \"I couldn't let bad stories go. I'd get fired up.\" I said, \"I know. We used to take advantage of it, Senator.\" When he would travel with us, later when he was endorsing us and running, he was just glued to the TV. \"What are they saying?\" And Bush is like, \"This guy is going to pop. How does he do it?\"\n\nSo in many respects we were—he posted the biggest threat to us coming out of New Hampshire. He was a flawed candidate, which was exposed not once but twice.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat is it that McCain underestimated about Bush, and what do you think the source of that misunderstanding was?\n\nBartlett\n\nI think it is this narrative. I think it's, I'm smarter than him. Particularly if you're a Senator. Just get me in a debate with him and I'm going to do circles around this guy. It's clear that everybody is going to see that this guy is not smart and I am. It's amazing how often people played into that narrative and stereotype and built strategies around it that turned out to be wrong every time. Really fascinating.\n\nNow, how different would a campaign look if you took that more seriously? I don't know. You'd have to think about that. What type of campaign, more successful type of campaign, to run against him? Not sure. I think Gore's biggest mistake is that he didn't embrace Clinton. He could have done better with that.\n\nRiley\n\nWe spent a lot of time asking the Clinton people why that happened. I think they scratch their heads over it too.\n\nBartlett\n\nIt's just amazing every step of the way how people underestimated George W. Bush throughout his political career. It all starts from the beginning. He wasn't supposed to run; [John Ellis] Jeb [Bush] was supposed to run. Jeb was the smart one. It's just funny. That whole narrative never went away.\n\nRiley\n\nDid George W. acknowledge this business with Jeb?\n\nBartlett\n\nI don't know. As brothers go they're not particularly close. I'm not sure. That may have come out. You probably read that he was closer to Marvin [Bush] and Dora [Bush Koch]. There was a certain healthy competitiveness there I guess. I don't know how much the two of them talked about it. We talked about it a lot.\n\nRiley\n\nWe need probably to tie up the Governorship. Let me pose the broad question to you. From hindsight, what are the things that we should pay most attention to out of the Governorship that have a bearing on our understanding of the man George W. Bush and then the President he becomes? Are there things that are underappreciated from that period that folks ought to pay attention to?\n\nBartlett\n\nI'd say from a governing standpoint he really honed his abilities around personal diplomacy with legislators. I know it has been documented, particularly the relationship he had with Bob Bullock and others. But he really honed a skill that paid off later with the likes of a Ted Kennedy or others when he got to Washington, D.C. He needed that experience and that time doing the legislative process and the minutia of legislative law making.\n\nKarl gets as much credit for this as anyone, really having a strategic imperative around the Hispanic vote. We really made it a big priority to be the first Republican Governor to win El Paso County, for example. We spent a lot of time out there. Again, it wasn't forced. He was a natural at it. Everybody thought that was Jeb's calling card because of his marriage and his fluency in Spanish. Bush's \"Spanglish\" did him proud. There was an authenticity. But the strategy early on paid dividends big time when he ran for President and reelection and had inroads that have now been entirely eroded for the party. But I think people will look back at that and say Bush was on to something very early in his political career that if it had stayed on track could have altered future Presidential races. It has been a real missed opportunity for the party.\n\nFast-forward to when we embarked on comprehensive immigration reform. One thing that was clear, our views in Washington about immigration reform were largely shaped based on our experience in Texas. His living in West Texas, sharing 2,000 miles of border, the assimilation, the familiarity. Where we missed was that in the eight years that we were gone, Texas changed. Texas got pissed off about the immigrant, the Hispanic issue, in a way that we did not appreciate.\n\nI got back to Texas in '08 and the schools, the hospital rooms, the things—in that short period of time the dynamic had shifted in Texas and we missed it. Really interesting. Now we can appreciate—when you're talking to a Congressman in northern Georgia and for the first time they get Hispanic voters there and they didn't know—so we understood their fears and we said, \"We've got this. We know.\" What we didn't see was that even in states like Texas and Arizona, where assimilation ought to take place, there was a level of anger and unrest around this issue that we didn't appreciate.\n\nNelson\n\nSo by 2006 when he is pushing immigration reform, this change has already occurred.\n\nBartlett\n\nAnd we missed it.\n\nNelson\n\nI wonder. You mention the bipartisanship, cross partisanship, however you want to describe it, of Bush's style as Governor when he was elected in 2000. Because of the circumstances of that election there was a lot of public commentary that he ought to run more of that kind of Presidency. [Richard B.] Cheney at least is the one who is quoted as saying, \"We thought about that for about 30 seconds and then decided we won, we're going to run it as a Republican administration.\" What about that? To the extent that Cheney's characterization is correct. I know there was No Child Left Behind and other across-the-aisle things—\n\nBartlett\n\nAnd entrees to Ted Kennedy and early on that helped on No Child Left Behind, followed by a bipartisan vote on the tax bill.\n\nNelson\n\nWas there any serious discussion, for example, of appointing a Cabinet with a substantial number of Democrats or any of these other things that might have sounded like the Bush style in Texas, which to people in Washington seemed to be the only style after an election like 2000?\n\nBartlett\n\nI would say that what we learned very quickly was that we're not in Kansas anymore. Bipartisanship in Texas, where the ideological differences are much narrower than they are here—to be a Democrat in Texas is a little bit different from being a Democrat from California or New York, just the professionalism of partisanship here and the hardening of it. But there was talk. It was his instinct to try the government way, but you just get crushed by the realities. I think at times it was easy for me to say, because it wasn't my job to worry about vote counts on the Hill and in retaining control. But we were slaves to what was going to help in the midterm. The pressure was always put on us, and they always put that guilt on us. \"We're going to lose our seat.\" It's hard, and I know every President deals with it, that pressure. It makes us do things that you look back on, like the Terri Schiavo deal, and you just think, Really? We really did that? You want to just pull your hair out over some of those decisions we made. But when you have those members of Congress and the Speaker, [John Dennis] Hastert, and all of them day in, day out, \"This is going to kill us for sure. This is going to kill us. We have to win. You think you have it bad now? If we lose the House—\"\n\nIt wears you down. I will tell you he never lost that. His instinct and impulse was always to do things that way. But just the crushing realities of politics here would always get us off of it.\n\nRiley\n\nTake us back—I'm trying to tie off some of the preliminaries. You were doing policy work for how long in the Governor's—\n\nBartlett\n\nFor the first two legislative sessions. Remember, in Texas every other year is a legislative session. So '95 was a legislative session, and I'm in the policy office, the assistant policy director, the number two guy. My job was not to really go deep on any of the issues but to make sure we were fulfilling all our campaign promises. So I had a finger in a lot of different issues that we were dealing with. There were a few that I spent more time on. I dealt with the National Guard stuff. Juvenile justice reform was something I spent an additional portion of time on. Then '96 is a nonlegislative session year. That's the one year I can remember actually having fun. It was just fun. The legislature is not in town, we're not having a campaign going on, an election. It probably was the only normal year. I was single at the time. It was a fun year.\n\nThen in '97 you have a legislative session, which is a precursor to your run for reelection, and it was right after—I was still kind of fulfilling the same role. I would say in '97 I'm starting to spend more and more time with Karen and communications and bridging that. My title—after the legislative session in '97 was over, which was roughly around June of '97, I moved over to the campaign. I had the position of issues director. We wanted it to be vague enough that it was communications, policy, a little bit of everything. Dale Laine was the campaign manager. Karen was doing part time toward the end of both.\n\nAfter we won reelection a lot of people reoriented themselves to the Governor's office, and then I broke off and started working out of Karl's office again as we started doing the preparatory work for the exploratory committee. There were a bunch of resolutions passed by Republicans around the country generating this authentic—I was one of a handful of guys who were generating that authentic—\n\nNelson\n\nSpontaneous.\n\nBartlett\n\nThat spontaneous \"front-porch\" campaign it was called, which was bringing people in. So I was working with Karl on those things.\n\nRiley\n\nHow soon?\n\nBartlett\n\nHours.\n\nRiley\n\nBut the question is how early did the business of Presidential aspirations start intruding—or how early were you familiar with it? When did it start?\n\nBartlett\n\nWhen I went to the reelection campaign for Governor. There was talk more in the Governor's office, but it was just talk. We were running our reelection campaign as a precursor to being ready to run for President. Had he made his decision? No. We were supposed—the whole MO [modus operandi] was assume—because I'd rather pull the plug on something that was ready to go as opposed to try and create something overnight.\n\nRiley\n\nUnderstand.\n\nBartlett\n\nWe all just assumed he was going to run, knowing that he had made this decision. So it wasn't a secret. We all knew he was going to. The way he accounts it is how it happened. When he ultimately decided to run—but we had all systems go. So there was no break from late '97 all the way through '99.\n\nRiley\n\nGot you. So tell us a little bit about this grassroots campaign to generate.\n\nBartlett\n\nThis was Karl's brainchild.\n\nRiley\n\nThe call for a Bush Presidency.\n\nBartlett\n\nHe's like—we need to generate an enormous amount of enthusiasm about him running, like he's being drafted to run. It was identifying Republican members of states and Karl using his vast Rolodex of people he had worked for in direct mail or he had through his own college Republican—all the things he'd been through. We pulled every lever we had in the Bush-[J. Danforth] Quayle apparatus, the Bush 41 apparatus as well. We really leaned on that to generate these resolutions and get them voted on at state conventions and things like that, in addition to bringing in these folks on this front-porch campaign.\n\nIt was a combination of political people, policy people, and helping. That was Karl's brainchild, and I helped to execute the mechanics around a lot of that. There was a handful of us who did.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did those operate, the front-porch campaign events? Who dreams them up? Who identifies—\n\nBartlett\n\nAt that point we had—I think even Condi—in each subject area somebody was designated and their job was, \"OK, who are we going to tap, bring in?\" Then work the calendar. As far as the resolution, we just divided up the country. I don't even remember what region I had. We divided up the states and said you have until X-day to get as many Republicans as you can to sign a petition to say he ought to run type thing. Classic grassroots campaigning without there being a campaign.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you largely pushing on an open door?\n\nBartlett\n\nOh yes. It was easy, fun work.\n\nNelson\n\nThere is a legislative session in '99 and I'm wondering. There are liberal Democrats in Texas. There is a national Democratic party. Both might have an interest in using this '99 session to create problems for George W. Bush. Did that happen?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, mainly through the relationship with the Speaker and the Lieutenant Governor. They just weren't going to let it happen. There were some moments, but we didn't worry about it. There were some nits and gnats that we had to deal with, but in the scheme of things it gave us a great platform to be governing.\n\nRiley\n\nYou've already mentioned McCain a couple of times. Who did you view as the top threat in competition for the—\n\nBartlett\n\nEarly on we worried about Steve Forbes because of his money. Obviously McCain, but I remember early on a real preoccupation with Forbes, that he was just going to be able to blow through with his money. So there was a lot of focus on him. Then on McCain. But I remember in those early days it was a big focus of our time and attention. That's why we thought it was so important on that first fundraising cycle that we put a big number out there. That was the one where everybody gasped when we put up the number. The \"great expectations tour\" was the name of that first swing through Iowa. Interesting, because as I was talking about earlier, lowering expectations. But it was hard to manage expectations during that time period. It was a whole new animal.\n\nIn large part on that first campaign I was on the road hardly at all. I was at headquarters. Really I was still technically—that's when we brought Josh Bolten on. Let's see how this actually worked. Formally I had one foot in policy, one foot in communication, but a little bit more in policy. Again, it was my job to—and then in charge of rapid response. Any attack on the Governor I was in charge of, because a lot of it was about his record, about those things. So I was running point on that. Part of that is a communications issue and part of that is a policy issue.\n\nKaren is on the road. Josh not having a relationship with the Governor, I was the bellwether. They're working on policies. I could quickly say that or this, so an interesting role. As the campaign unfolded, we got through the primaries, which is an interesting time for me personally because I got married in the middle of all this. I was a glutton for punishment.\n\nSo I get married in the 2000 Presidential campaign. I had twin boys during the reelect in '04, and I had my third child literally the day after the '07 State of the Union address I was in charge of. That was pretty much when the game was up.\n\nRiley\n\nI remember reading through the briefing books and seeing one article that said you and your wife were childless. I got through about 10 more pages and there were three children.\n\nBartlett\n\nI'll never forget—this is classic Bush. This is like January 10th of '07. Whit [Bartlett]'s birth is the 24th, so the State of the Union was on January 23rd. It's a Sunday night or something. He calls the house and Allyson [Bartlett], my wife, answered the phone. \"Yes, Mr. President.\"\n\nShe recounts the conversation: \"Hi Ally, how's that baby coming along?\" \"Fine, Mr. President.\" He says, \"You know I have this speech coming up?\" She says, \"Yes, sir, I do know that.\" He says, \"Keep your legs crossed.\" She throws the phone to me, like, Look, I don't need your help on this. Let me handle this part. She's glaring at me.\n\nBut anyway, '99, right after the primary, I got married. There was a big issue around the gun debate I think it was. Somehow that became a focal point of the campaign. I remember because going on my honeymoon to Hawaii, we literally walk into our honeymoon suite and the phone is blowing up. She's like, \"I've got my ring, I'm going to the pool. You can stay in here and take forever.\" So I spent the first day of our honeymoon in a hotel room dealing with some New York Times story, if I remember correctly, about Bush. Maybe it was on guns. I can't remember what it was. Something about guns, I remember, but I remember spending a significant period of the first day of my honeymoon dealing with the campaign. That's what you get for getting married in the middle of a Presidential campaign.\n\nRiley\n\nExactly.\n\nBartlett\n\nI don't know what other people have said about this, but there is a campaign and then there are debates. You cannot appreciate the level of stress and anxiety around Presidential debates.\n\nNelson\n\nYou're talking about all the debates?\n\nBartlett\n\nOh, yes. My role in the second, in '04, was different from the first term. I was in charge of rapid response, so literally during the middle of the debates I was the one as charges are being leveled we're putting out documents, refuting, and those things, but just on the candidate, on the team, it paralyzes campaigns. I just remember I played a more strategic role the second time around, more so than I did the first time. But there's no better process than a debate process, and every President—look what happened to President [Barack] Obama. It's a fascinating process to be involved in.\n\nRiley\n\nMike had asked the question about—during the primary season as well?\n\nNelson\n\nThe primary as well, the Republican debates.\n\nBartlett\n\nOh, I'm sorry, yes.\n\nNelson\n\nSame thing?\n\nBartlett\n\nNot quite, because the multicandidate forum is easier to navigate. That one we had in South Carolina was—Brian Williams I think moderated it, and they served booze for an hour and a half before we got there to the entire audience. It was raucous. McCain lost his cool at that one. There were two memorable ones; that was one. There was a Larry King debate in South Carolina during the primary and it was us, McCain, and Alan Keyes. This was when all the charges were flying about the personal attacks and those things. There were commercial breaks because it was the Larry King show.\n\nIn the first segment—we're all right there watching—Keyes just blisters McCain, I think on abortion or something, just hammer and tong going after him. They cut to break and McCain almost came over the table to strangle Alan Keyes. He was furious. We all just looked and said, \"We're going to win this one.\" Look at this—he blew up. It was a disaster for McCain to the point where they sent McCain to the spin room afterward to try to clean it up. It was bad. That was one of the classic ones we had.\n\nWe knew he was going to attack us about all the dirty attacks on him. They had been putting out flyers attacking Bush. Bush knew. He said, \"Your campaign is doing attacks as well.\" He pulled out a flyer. McCain said, \"That's not our—\" He was defiant.\n\nBush said, \"It says, 'Paid for by John McCain' right here.\" McCain just got beet red. He was going to lose it. We knew we had him, but Alan Keyes helped us a lot that night. So the drama around the debates was just fascinating to say the least. I don't remember the primary ones. The first one or two everyone was gunning for him, but nowhere near—maybe at the time we thought, Gosh, can't get any worse than this. Nothing compares to the general election debates.\n\nRiley\n\nLet's take a break.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nNelson\n\nThere were a couple of things Bush said during that debate season, one of which might have been in a debate that ended up becoming big stories. One was, \"Who is your favorite philosopher?\" He said, \"Jesus Christ, because he changed my life.\" The other was, \"Who is the leader of Pakistan?\" et cetera. How do you—obviously the second one wasn't planned—wasn't calculated.\n\nBartlett\n\nNor was the first.\n\nNelson\n\nNor was the first, OK.\n\nBartlett\n\nThat's what I told you. Instincts. He froze. That is, he said, \"I just pulled it out of my keister.\" That was not a planned answer. It was not a question we had anticipated. But considering where we were, which I believe was in Iowa, it was pretty safe territory. Even though he got ridiculed and lampooned by the New York Times we actually thought that kind of validated that it was a good instinct, but he froze.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat I wonder is, so you're sitting there and you're hearing him say that. Are you thinking, This is something we can use or This is something we're going to have to defend?\n\nBartlett\n\nBoth. The [Pervez] Musharraf one was more troubling because that was like is he ready to be President. He was a little bit over his skis. That one was more troubling, and what made us worry a bit more. Ironically, years later I remember sitting in Pakistan with General Musharraf and President Bush and smoking cigars and laughing about that.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you anticipate that something like that, where people who—\n\nBartlett\n\nWe tried to come up with as many gotcha angles, questions, things like that as we could, and you know you can't begin to prepare enough. If somebody wants to do that, they're going to be able to pull it off. I don't remember though, was the Musharraf one in an interview?\n\nNelson\n\nThat was in a radio interview.\n\nRiley\n\nIt was with somebody who had a history—\n\nBartlett\n\nHe did, and that was on us—it was a guy out of Austin.\n\nNelson\n\nExactly.\n\nBartlett\n\nA reporter out of Austin who had a history of doing it, so that was bad staff work, whoever that was.\n\nRiley\n\nWere you present for these meetings in the mansion, the policy meetings that were taking place, the front-porch campaign meetings?\n\nBartlett\n\nSome, not all of them. I do remember the first time I met Dick Cheney because he came down for one of them. At the time I guess he was CEO [chief executive officer] of Halliburton.\n\nRiley\n\nI think so.\n\nBartlett\n\nI learned pretty quickly about—so he comes out of the meeting first and I was outside out in the back of the mansion. He was pacing. I'm sitting there, see if I can generate some small talk. So I said, \"Mr. Secretary, what time is your flight?\" God, I'm asking a guy who is CEO of Halliburton what time his flight is, like he's going to go jump on Southwest Airlines. \"I have my own plane.\" Silence. Crickets. He is perfectly comfortable with nothing being said, but I'm sitting there, Blew that one. My one shot to establish rapport with the guy.\n\nI remember being in some meetings and not in others.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you have any recollection of the dynamic in those meetings? Is this a case where the Governor is in a listening mode?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, he's hammering questions. Again, it comes back to this friend and foe alike all bought into the narrative that Bush was dumb. So they come in thinking, I'll have to do a tutorial and teach him the ABCs of policy. They'd get in there and Bush is firing questions about elements of the minutia of policy and they're on their heels. So it's not a passive environment at all. Quite the contrary.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd he's not in sales mode either.\n\nBartlett\n\nThe charm mode. He's not trying to sell his bona fides as an intellectual, no; it is more charm mode. But some of those folks who were brought down early on turned out to be some of the fiercest, loyalist of his defenders, the Al Hubbards of the world and people like that. The Vulcans, I think they were called, on the foreign policy side. I think it was that group that was particularly—that one was probably more—asking questions more than demonstrating ability.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any famous blowups, or did you lose anybody in any of those episodes?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, not to my knowledge.\n\nRiley\n\nI'm not signaling that I've heard anything, it just strikes me that with that many meetings and that many high-profile people, particularly if they come in and their preconceptions are at variance with their—\n\nBartlett\n\nI don't know on the legislator side, but on the policy side, the ones who were brought in for policy discussions, none.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you recall the Governor at any point nixing—issuing instructions that this person is not going to—\n\nBartlett\n\nI'm sure there was, but I don't remember. That would have been an edict to Karl. I don't remember.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat's the quickest way for somebody in a situation like that to find themselves on the outs?\n\nBartlett\n\nThe typical bragging, I'm smarter—talking tonally, condescending. That would be a quick way to get in that doghouse. Most people who came in who didn't know him quickly learned there has been a misconception of who he was.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen Josh was brought in, how did that work? Because you were the guy who had the track record with the Governor on policy issues.\n\nBartlett\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it awkward for you suddenly to have a boss or a new boss, or somebody higher in the pecking order whose portfolio is—\n\nBartlett\n\nIt wasn't as awkward for me as it was for Vance because Vance was policy director over in the Governor's office. That was hard for Vance.\n\nRiley\n\nWhy wasn't Vance elevated to a position as national policy director?\n\nBartlett\n\nIt's a whole different field. Vance was a smart guy who learned quickly over time about Texas politics. The learning curve and the time frame that we had—that's the same with me. We all not only recognized but welcomed the added firepower. I picked up Josh the first time. He was with Goldman Sachs working out of London I believe. I picked him up at the airport after an overnight flight and I took him straight to an event in Austin.\n\nWe were doing some dinner deal at Shoreline Grill that the Governor had staffed. I met him literally off the plane and we hit it off. He was one of the best guys ever. That was the same for a lot of those early—whether it was Josh in that role later—I mean if you can't get along with Andy Card, then you need to look in the mirror. We were really, I don't know if the right word is blessed—grateful to have them. The personalities who got injected into our process early were really good people.\n\nInteresting enough that the stagers on these days, Ted Cruz was a staffer on Josh's campaign policy staff. The irony was that if you ran a poll of campaign staff during that and you had to ask the question who was the most elitist, lazy, pompous ass on the staff, Ted Cruz would have won going away. Now he is the populist, everyman, Tea Party. It is an interesting transformation. It's a smart political strategy for him to win, and that's what it was, a strategy.\n\nAnyway, the first molding of the Texas crew with the national crew was relatively seamless.\n\nRiley\n\nWho gets the credit for that?\n\nBartlett\n\nBush. He set the right tone. A lot of those folks Karl knew. All the overlap with his father—these weren't unfamiliar faces. I would say there was a squeaky wheel—David Beckwith didn't work out. I don't know if that has come up. He was a communications guy. To tell you the truth, several communications people didn't pan out with Karen. I remember the first campaign for Governor, Deborah Burstion-Wade was her name. She was a casualty. David Beckwith, who had a relationship with Karl, was a Bush guy. I think he worked on Kay Bailey Hutchison's race. He flamed out pretty early.\n\nAfter Elizabeth Dole flamed out in the primary, that's when we recruited Ari Fleischer. Ari was a pretty squeaky wheel early on. That was a process—it is his personality—to get him acclimated. So not all of it was smooth and seamless, but for the most part, particularly the Joshes of the world, the Andys of the world, there was a quick chemistry.\n\nNelson\n\nIn their case it wouldn't have been treating Bush condescendingly.\n\nBartlett\n\nOh, no.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat were the rough edges that Beckwith, for example, didn't smooth off?\n\nBartlett\n\nIt was not as much with Bush himself. This was more just staff not knowing our style. As I said, this may be more about Karen than it was about anybody else. How we go about things, the flip tone of comments. He had had some things he said in the press that just weren't our style. Ari had that a little bit too.\n\nRiley\n\nWas there a disrespect for Karen's role in the pecking order?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, it was just she had a very strong point of view about the tone, how we were going to engage the press, and they kind of had their own identity, how they were going to do it. That does come to a head.\n\nNelson\n\nFor example.\n\nBartlett\n\nThat tension, to the last day Ari was press secretary, never went away.\n\nNelson\n\nFor example, what kinds of things would Karen think were inconsistent?\n\nBartlett\n\nI can't remember the exact quote, but it was something about one of our financial disclosures made early on and Beckwith said something, was quoted in the New York Times or some paper that sent everybody off, particularly Karen. He was gone maybe 30 days after that. I'd have to—\n\nRiley\n\nThat's enough of a flag for somebody who is interested in the question to go search it out. I'm wondering about the question of leaks, which is a big one that we'll probably want to delve into later, although now might be the right time to do it. Is it the case that during the gubernatorial years there is a discipline within the communication apparatus so that there aren't people going around to speak to newspaper reporters then?\n\nBartlett\n\nYes, it was interesting. It was kind of unheard of for people to unilaterally engage the media, save one person—Karl. He always thought he was smart enough to not leave tracks, but we always knew, up to the final days. I could sniff out a Karl Rove quote from a mile away. It really wasn't an issue. It was only when we got into the Presidential stuff. Once we got in the White House we learned that that was a part of governing. The agencies and how you box in a President in the policy-making process, which we learned the hard way multiple times. But that wasn't a reality—and it wasn't as much during the Presidential campaign. We didn't have a problem with the core staff. It was always that layer right outside. It was just a challenge.\n\nThat was a reality we had to start understanding better and operating under. But relatively speaking, for a Presidential campaign we were pretty buttoned up.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's what I thought.\n\nBartlett\n\nAbsolutely. It wasn't until we actually got into office that it became a bigger issue. Even, frankly, compared to Clinton, we ran a pretty good ship.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's the fundamental basis for the question. There is a perception among people who study these things that you did run a tight ship. What we're interested in knowing is how does that happen? What are the predicates? You wonder if it is replicable. Can other administrations learn something from your experience?\n\nBartlett\n\nThere's a difference. We suffered like every President with agency leaks around issues, so DoD [Department of Defense] or State Department, that fight between those two agencies. But what we did avoid is that usually leaks within the White House come from a divided White House. I'll never forget Andy Card telling me about his first day on the job in the [Ronald] Reagan White House. There was a meeting in the Roosevelt Room without the President. He didn't know—he got there about 20 minutes early and the first person in the room is a lady putting place cards down. He says, \"Where do I sit?\" She says, \"Well, are you [Edwin] Meese or [James Addison] Baker [III]?\" It depended on if you were a Meese guy or a Baker guy what side of the room you sat on. It was that clear.\n\nHe learned early on that that was a very—we did not have that. We had tension within the White House at times, but it was all done in family. There was a pretty healthy tension between Karl and Karen. I became kind of the interlocutor. There is some history on that going back to 1999 or 2000. The election, we thought, was over. The recount is underway. We're in the middle of the recount and Karen comes to me and says, \"Look.\" At this point we're feeling pretty good about our chances. She said, \"I'd really like you to be my deputy in the White House, be my number two and help me on all this.\" I was ecstatic because my passion was turning toward the communications side of things. I was battle-tested in dealing with the national media throughout the Presidential race. It was just more interesting to me rather than going back into policy, and I knew Karen's style.\n\nShe was a massive delegator. Karen is not a multitasker at all. She gets totally preoccupied with one thing, which was great for a deputy because then I got to do everything. She would go off on a speech and she'd spend days—she'd hole up for a day on a speech, so I knew the opportunity for growth for me was going to be great. Literally the next day Karl calls me into his office and says, \"I'd really love for you to be my deputy. You know me, I'm worried about my bandwidth.\" Bullshit. \"I'm worried about life balance with my family, I'm going to really try to approach this smartly, so I'm going to have to lean on my deputy,\" which I knew wasn't true. He can't delegate. Had I not gotten the offer from Karen I'd be still—\n\nI had to tell him not only that I couldn't do it, but also that I'm going to go work for Karen and be her deputy. That was a massive blow to our relationship. He could rightly say you wouldn't be here today if it weren't for me giving you a job back then, and he's absolutely right. But then as Karl can do—he may have never gotten over it, but then he was going to find a way to use it to his advantage. So that's how I really started to play that interlocutor, which was important.\n\nHe and I met and did things on behalf of Karen more than the two of them did. We had different responsibilities. It was always great when his perspective and our perspective overlapped and we could do things, but there were times when his political agenda, his ability to think about the political objectives and our ability to try and communicate a narrative about the President and the Presidency, they're going to clash.\n\nThat kind of played its way out throughout the Presidency. There was tension and things like that, but never would we take that to the press. We knew that would do nothing but hurt our boss. We just got lucky that in almost every one of those key positions we had people who were there for the right reasons. We may have been loyal to a fault in putting too many Texans in key positions, but even the ones we supplemented with Washingtonians, they were true to the cause. When you think of somebody like Steve Hadley, you don't get any better than Steve Hadley—\n\nRiley\n\nOr self-effacing.\n\nBartlett\n\nLarry Lindsey, complicated guy. Love him. He clumsily tried to leak things and we'd catch him. \"Larry, this is not going to work.\" He'd go, \"I didn't do it.\" I'd say, \"I know you did.\" But their hearts were in the right place. I can't say that there was any magic recipe that we had that made us better at it than others. I do think it is his style and the loyalty that he engenders. A lot of people also feel compelled to leak when they don't have access. But his open door became a very valuable tool to make people feel connected and part of the team and therefore you wouldn't be as incentivized.\n\nRiley\n\nLet's go ahead and follow this. There are pieces of the campaign that we may still want to come back to.\n\nNelson\n\nBig pieces.\n\nRiley\n\nBig pieces of the campaign we'd want to come back to, but because we raised this issue a couple of times, and it is really important, let's go ahead and talk about this question of organization of the White House and the bringing in of the Texans and how they're salted in and how all of this works. Your take on this is that there are some access questions to the President that you felt like maybe weren't handled, in retrospect, in the best possible way.\n\nBartlett\n\nI would just say that the President, and therefore Andy, overcorrected from the gatekeeper—\n\nRiley\n\nThe Sununu.\n\nBartlett\n\nWhat he witnessed with his father. If he were sitting here today he would dispute this, I'm certain.\n\nRiley\n\nAndy would?\n\nBartlett\n\nNo, Andy I don't think would. I think George W. Bush would dispute it. President Bush would say, \"No, it's exactly what I wanted.\" He knew the tensions that we had. But Andy, I think, and I've talked to him a little bit about it, he should have managed us more tightly, and Josh did. Josh stripped Karl of his policy role and he managed us better and we were better for it. It's not fair to the process if at any given moment one of us who was close to him can circumvent that process by going straight to him. I think at times we probably—I can't think of one massive one where it was exploited, but there is no doubt that it was.\n\nI'm sure I was as guilty as anybody. If I knew there was a big meeting that afternoon, I'd go in there at 6:30 in the morning and start to say, \"We have this meeting. Can you believe they're going to bring this to your table?\"\n\nRiley\n\nSo you're replicating what you were doing in Texas. You'd have a few minutes to talk with him in the morning.\n\nBartlett\n\nAnd he loved it. I think Andy in retrospect would probably wish he controlled that more.\n\nRiley\n\nInteresting. Let me give you the premise for the question. Mike and I come out of political science and studying the Presidency, particularly a lot on White House organization. There is a sense that you guys were enormously effective in the way that the structure was created. In some respects it is a little bit of a puzzle, because when we teach our classes there are these two classic models of White House organization. There is the strong Chief of Staff, which is very hierarchical, where everything gets funneled up through him. Then there is the spokes of the wheel, where five or six or seven people have common access, and we always teach that that is a flawed model, but Presidents want accessibility.\n\nThen we come to some departures from the model. The first Reagan White House, which for a while seemed to work well with the troika, not very long, and in your case, which is always puzzling when I'm trying to teach my classes because I say there was a very experienced Chief of Staff—\n\nBartlett\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nYet there were people who seemed to have—\n\nBartlett\n\nIt was definitely a hybrid. He did wield considerable authority and respect. He was not neutered in the sense—I don't want to leave that impression. He ran a very good process, but I may be talking at the margin here. I live in the margin of 90 percent of the time, 98 percent of the time, it probably worked well. But I just felt like there were times when maybe in the structure—at the end of the day, the staff and the structure are always going to reflect the personality of the leader. Whether we had a different structure, those abuses—I don't want to say abuses because it might sound like there was some kind of nefarious motivation behind it. It's not. It's more human nature.\n\nI don't want to overstate that. I would just state that Josh was not as deferential as Andy was to the access points, to the process. Whether it was how he decided to restruc"
