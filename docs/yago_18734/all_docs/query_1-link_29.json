        "text": "Janice Claire Miller, of Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, passed away peacefully at home on February 6th, 2024. She was 81 years old. Jan is survived by her husband of 55 years, Daniel Gordon Miller, her son, Troy, daughter-in-law Nina, three beloved grandchildren, Hayden, Grace and Luke, her brother, John Dorenbecher and wife, Marita, her niece, Kati Lutes and her husband Billy. We will miss her forever and cherish the amazing kindness, generosity and love she provided to everyone around her.\n\nJan was born on Long Island to Joseph and June Dorenbecher and spent her childhood in Hicksville, New York. She enjoyed life near the shore, where she fell in love with the endless magic of the ocean and often visited her grandparents in East Quogue. As an adult she would often talk about how the sound of the waves and the salt air brought her peace. After graduation from high school she attended nursing school at Adelphi University then later moved to Texas to join the U.S. Army in the throes of the Vietnam War. She quickly rose to the rank of Captain in the 2nd and 3rd Armored Division. While stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, she encountered a young Lieutenant who was so hypnotized by her confidence and beauty that he \"elbowed aside\" a young doctor to ask her on a date. That eventual date at the Officer's Club led to marriage in 1968 and over 55 years together, in spite of our playful joking that Mom outranked Dad. Jan and Dan shared a deep love and friendship that was honest and fulfilling.\n\nAfter their enlistment ended in the early seventies, they moved to Lafayette, California and started a family. Throughout her life, Jan let her artistic energy guide her. She excelled in painting water colors and taking black and white photos, often entering her work in local contests. Quilting, gardening and baking became everlasting pursuits. Jan doted on her three Brittany Spaniels, and later in life her \"grandpup\" Sully. The dogs were never lacking for love or treats. Being a mom was one of her greatest joys, and she taught her son about the importance of character and hard work, and the value of friendship. She was unafraid of a challenge and continuously developed new artistic skills, always finding that the beauty in the world was there for the taking. You just had to seek it out and savor it. She brought so much love to her family and friends, and was immensely proud of her grandchildren. \"Nana\" made a great pirate, was not afraid of slipping into a living room fort constructed of cushions and sheets held together by clothespins, and attended every soccer game and flag football event with Grandpa that was possible. She baked incredible biscotti and shortbread, and for a time ran her own bakery. She always enjoyed speaking with customers at local farmers' markets, and experimenting with new recipes. Her family was more than happy to be her culinary taste testers. (We may or may not have gained a few pounds as a result.)\n\nJan left an indelible imprint on our lives. We will celebrate her in between tears and know that she is still guiding us in her calm, gentle and instructive way. Family and friends, please join us for visiting hours on Saturday, February 10th from 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm at Smith & Heald Funeral Home, 63 Elm Street, Milford, New Hampshire. This will be followed by a brief service for family and friends at 1:30 pm, also at the funeral home. Due to the cold weather there will be no burial at this time. In lieu of flowers, a donation to the American Heart Association is welcomed."
