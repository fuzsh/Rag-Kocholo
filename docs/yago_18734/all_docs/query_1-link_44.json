        "text": "Showrunner/Executive Producer DANIEL C. CONNOLLY and Creator/Writer/Co-Executive Producer HOLDEN MILLER discuss the wonder, the challenges, and the joy of bringing the NIGHT SKY to life in this exclusive interview.\n\nIt’s always wondrous when the cinematic stars align for a project and Amazon Studio’s latest series NIGHT SKY is no exception. A spellbinding story and concept, within just the first episode of this eight-episode series, you are enthralled by not only the mystery of what is unfolding but by the performances of Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons. A story that may initially appear to be quiet, intimate, and “small”, quickly becomes much larger, expanding not only the imagination but the heart.\n\nSYNOPSIS: “Spanning space and time, NIGHT SKY follows Irene and Franklin York, a couple who, years ago, discovered a chamber buried in their backyard which inexplicably leads to a strange, deserted planet. They’ve carefully guarded their secret ever since, but when an enigmatic young man enters their lives, the Yorks’ quiet existence is quickly upended…and the mystifying chamber they thought they knew so well turns out to be much more than they could ever have imagined.”\n\nCreated by HOLDEN MILLER with episodes written by Holden Miller, Daniel C. Connolly, Allison Moore, Anne-Marie Hess, and Ezra Claytan Daniels, and directed by Juan José Campanella, Philip Martin, Robert Pulcini, Shari Springer Berman, Sara Colangelo, Jessica Lowrey, and Victoria Mahoney, NIGHT SKY boasts an impressive cast led by Spacek and Simmons. Joining them are Chai Hansen, Adam Bartley, Kiah McKirnan, Julietta Zylberberg, and Rocio Hernandez.\n\nEPISODES:\n\nEpisode 1 – To the Stars\n\nEpisode 2 – La Capilla\n\nEpisode 3 – The Caretaker\n\nEpisode 4 – Boilermakers\n\nEpisode 5 – Driving Lessons\n\nEpisode 6 – Dear Franklin\n\nEpisode 7 – Lake Driving\n\nEpisode 8 – Compensation\n\nIn this exclusive interview, DANIEL C. CONNOLLY and HOLDEN MILLER go deep into the making of NIGHT SKY discussing the series leads Spacek and Simmons at length and the “heartbeat” they provide, crafting the dramatic beats and expanding the adventure from the intimate story of Irene and Franklin to something vast and outward looking, structural pacing on the page and translating that into episodes onscreen, working with editors Josh Beal, Sheridan Sotelo, and Joe Giganti to find the visual and emotional beats, choosing the various directors and cinematographers and the reasons for each selected, the mastery of production designer Scott Kuzio, the overall collaborative process, their individual learning curves in bringing NIGHT SKY to fruition, and more.\n\nTAKE A LISTEN. . .\n\nby debbie elias, exclusive interview 05/13/2022"
