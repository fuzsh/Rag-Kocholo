        "text": "So you would say a frag tank could be more profitable?\n\nDepends on your tank. I had a lot of corals and room. My corals grew well and I had a lot of high end zoas that grew well for me. I was able to make most of the money from them and a few pieces of sps that did well also.\n\nThe feeding of the fry and getting them to sellable size is where the cost will most likely outweigh the profit. Like I said I got lucky in the timing of mine and the demand was very high so lfs were paying top dollar for them. I would not even try it now. Within the last 5 years I have bred quite a few fw fish that were highly desirable when I was sourcing them but now everyone has a source and always have them in stock so I cant even give them away. The one that would probably still be worth something take forever to become mature and even then lfs wouldnt pay what it took to grow these out to a sellable size. I've been offered $200 for the male and $75 for each of the females for them now that they are hitting maturity. These came from my original trio that I lost during or slightly after my move 5 years ago. I was able to get the original trio for a good price and they had 2 batches of babies. The first batch I sold and the second I sold half of then I had to move. I lost the three adults and half of the half of the second batch. What I have left is 1m 4f which are just now getting to breeding size. Basically what I guess I am saying is its not worth the time and effort to try this you wont make enough to equalize the cost as a business. But on the hobbyist level it can be rewarding just for the fun or challenge of it. Dont do this hobby to try and make money do it because you like it and if you make some money then great."
