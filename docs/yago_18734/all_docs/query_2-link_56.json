        "text": "NEW BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Incumbent District Judge Jeffrey C. Miller is seeking re-election for his third term as Magisterial District Judge in District Court 18-3-04, Clarion County.\n\nThe district covers the Boroughs of Callensburg, East Brady, Hawthorn, New Bethlehem, Rimersburg, and Sligo and the Townships of Brady, Licking, Limestone, Madison, Perry, Piney, Porter, Redbank, and Toby.\n\nHe received his certification from the Administration Office of Pennsylvania Courts in September of 2007 and updates with the Minor Judiciary yearly on recertification. He has sat on the bench for summary trials, civil actions, landlord-tenant and criminal proceedings and criminal arrangements throughout his judicial career.\n\nHaving been elected in 2007, upon the retirement of Daniel P. George in 2008, he is a lifelong resident of the district and a 1975 graduate of Redbank Valley High School. He was former business partner with his late father, Wallace Miller, and served as Pennsylvania State Constable, working with the courts for over a ten year period.\n\nHe is a member of the New Bethlehem Lions Club and Masonic Lodge F&AM 522. He spends his free time volunteering as a public announcer for AC Valley/Union Football, Rimersburg Youth Football, Redbank Valley Basketball, Soccer, and Softball. He also is a supporter of the Clarion County Fair and serves as a daily announcer for the Fair. He supports charity events for the New Bethlehem Fire Department and many numerous events. He supports Blessing Bags, East Brady Riverfest, Hawthorn, Limestone, New Bethlehem Fire Department Gun Raffles, Sligo NWTF Banquet, New Bethlehem Little League, RVHS school play, New Bethlehem Community Center, American Legion projects, Bridge Builders Foundations, and Clarion-Limestone and Union “Pink” cancer basketball games, along with many other charitable events.\n\nJeffrey C. Miller is asking for your support for his re-election.\n\n“It is important that a District Judge be involved with the communities they serve. It takes a feel for the social and economics of the venue. A court must be run with Experience, Fairness, and Compassion!”\n\nMiller will be filing as incumbent on both the Republican and Democratic ballot as a candidate for District Judge."
