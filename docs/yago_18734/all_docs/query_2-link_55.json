        "text": "For Trooper Joshua Miller:\n\nThe risks while holding a position in law enforcement are many.\n\nAmong such risks is the occasion when we are called to intercept the unbalanced or reckless individual who is fully-engaged in a heated family dispute. No one can predict how he or she will act while they are bent-upon making disposition of such matters beyond the orders of the court.\n\nEach of us that wear the uniform and patrol are routinely called to such disputes. Each time, and every time, we have reason to be cautious. Most such incidents are settled either by tense negotiation or just plain and sensible dialogue between the officer and the subject involved. They realize that another solution to their problem exists. We then all breath easier. Another call answered. Another dispute settled. No violence has occurred.\n\nBut, this is not always the case. There exists the individual who will risk the personal safety of all involved. A wife, a husband, a son, or a daugtter. Suddenly the police officer sent to intervene becomes the enemy. He or she is the target of aggression. The actor lashes-out and the strike is deadly. It is some times sudden. It is usually with little warning. It is always dangerous.\n\nThe officer who responds has reason to be tense. He or she is confronted with the possibility of having to defend himself or another. Lives hang in the balance. A mistake can bring heartache, lasting regret and endless criticism. Such judgements are sometimes made in seconds. Defensive tactics are taught in our training. Police officers act as trained. Not as psychologists. Not as social workers. Not as trigger-happy individuals, as some would have you believe. It is our duty to act. It is ours alone. No second-guessing. And, no second chance.\n\nWhen a shooting occurs, unlike the television or movies, the after-math is tense. It is emotional. Sometimes it is chaotic. It is always serious. It is mostly sad. It is not over quickly. A long investigation, with many interviews, scene searching, testing, reporting, and hearings will follow. It can be months before the entire inquiry is completed. Those having the power to prosecute make the final decision. Not the police. In the mean time for those directly involved the toll on the mind is great and the emotions are heavy. No police officer who has been involved in a gun battle, and seeing a brother or sister officer die, is ever the same. The pain of such an incident is truly known only to those who have experienced it. Recovery is possible, but never complete.\n\nIn the end are the family, the friends, and the co-workers of the deceased. Each of them wonder. Each of them ask: Why? We have no answer. We have no magic. No soothing words. We cannot imagine what words would suffice. We can only ponder how our own family would feel at this moment. We know from experience that time, and only time, will have to pass to bring about healing to this horrible wound. We shall pray for each of them. We shall have hope for all of them.\n\nOur Call of Honor says that we shall lay down our life rather than swerve from the path of duty. To recite this creed is noble. To live this creed distinguished. To believe this creed is honorable. Trooper Joshua Miller recited this creed in training. He lived this creed each day. He distinguished himself on duty. And, he has honored both himself and the Pennsylvania State Police by laying down his life rather than swerving from the path of his duty. And, he did it for others. Indeed, no honor is higher.\n\nTo Trooper Joshua Miller I render a final salute.\n\nCpl. Ralph D. Fiorenza (Ret.)\n\nPennylvania State Police"
