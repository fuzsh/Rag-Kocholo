        "text": "Meghan Cunningham, vice president for marketing and communications, has been a Rocket for more than a dozen years.\n\nShe joined The University of Toledo as a media relations specialist in 2010 from The Blade newspaper where she had been a reporter for five years. Her UToledo career also has included serving as assistant director of media relations, director of University communications and executive director of marketing and communications. She assumed the vice president role in May 2023.\n\nMeghan strongly believes in the power of higher education to change lives, especially at UToledo, and appreciates her awesome responsibility to tell the Universityâs story. She is proud of the talented and creative team in the Office of Marketing and Communications that is committed to sharing the wonderful value of a UToledo education with prospective students and celebrating the successes of our incredible students, faculty and staff.\n\nA UToledo alumna, Meghan has a master of business administration degree from the John B. and Lillian E. Neff College of Business and Innovation and a bachelorâs degree in journalism from Michigan State University. She lives in Sylvania with her husband and two children and enjoys novels and films that move her to tears, trying new restaurants and squeezing in extra minutes of sleep whenever possible.\n\nJen Sorgenfrei serves as executive director of marketing and communications. She brings to the role more than a decade of experience in marketing and communications strategy in both public and private sector organizations.\n\nPrior to joining The University of Toledo, Jen was media relations manager at ProMedica, where she served as the health systemâs crisis communicator in addition to promoting acute care facilities throughout Ohio and Michigan, as well as the oncology, neurology and behavioral health service lines. From 2010-14, Jen was public information officer for the city of Toledo. Additionally, she worked for Funk Luetke Skunda (now FLS Group, a division of Thread), the Lucas County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board and the Ohio House of Representatives, where she was responsible for developing communications plans for maintaining a dialogue with the community, assisting clients in achieving their business goals and managing institutional reputation.\n\nJen is a graduate of The University of Toledo, where she earned a bachelorâs degree in political science and a masterâs degree in public administration. A native of the Toledo region, she enjoys exploring Toledoâs Metroparks with her dog, Oscar, supporting local businesses and restaurants, and planning her next trip to a sunny vacation retreat.\n\nA longtime print journalist, Kirk Baird joined The University of Toledo Marketing and Communication team in October, 2020, as Internal Communications Manager, in the chief role of providing and editing content for UToledo News.\n\nA Dallas native, Baird graduated from Texas Tech University with the stubborn dream of being a features writer and film critic at a daily newspaper.\n\nHis first career stop was at the Odessa American in Odessa, Texas, where, as a copy editor-turned entertainment editor, Baird came to see the beauty in the scrub tree desolation of West Texas (and to appreciate the hardscrabble resolve of those who defined themselves by it).\n\nA few years later, he accepted a position at the Las Vegas Sun â a life-changing career move where Baird met his wife and became a father. At the Las Vegas Sun, Baird wrote feature and entertainment stories about Sin City eccentrics and strip mall neighborhoods, and quickly learned the fun in name-dropping celebrities he had interviewed. Baird considers his hourlong phone interview with Hunter S. Thompson to be his second favorite Las Vegas Sun story to share. His first? When Thompson called Baird back minutes after they hung up just to chat.\n\nBaird joined the newspaper staff of the Toledo Blade as the paperâs film critic and pop culture editor in July, 2008. In his dozen years at The Blade, Baird expanded his newspaper presence to include weekly columns (which the Associated Press deemed to be among the best in Ohio), and generated more stories about those who live in Northwest Ohio than he can remember.\n\nDuring his formative years as a journalist, Baird learned that everyone has a story to tell. They just need someone to tell it.\n\nHe is excited about telling those stories of the incredible students, faculty and staff at UToledo. When not telling stories, Baird is likely to be at home playing classic video games on his full-size arcade cabinet â¦ and explaining to his beloved wife and daughter why there is a full-size arcade cabinet in their home.\n\nAs a Media Relations Specialist, Nicki Gorny is focused on sharing the stories of students and faculty at The University of Toledo. She primarily works on Main Campus.\n\nPrior to joining UToledo in August, 2023, she spent more than a half-decade at The Blade, initially covering religion and other features that frequently put her in contact with experts on campus. She later coordinated the daily newspaperâs features section as an editor, developing stories with a team of staff writers specializing in art, music, theater, religion, and more.\n\nGorny is a Toledo native who grew up outside Cleveland, then headed to Upstate New York to earn a bachelorâs degree in Spanish Language, Literature, and Culture, and Newspaper and Online Journalism from Syracuse University. She loves a good book and a well-stocked thrift store.\n\nTyrel Linkhorn is the primary storyteller and media contact for The University of Toledoâs academic health and clinical programs, including the College of Medicine and Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Nursing, College of Health and Human Services and The University of Toledo Medical Center.\n\nTyrel helps promote the work of University of Toledo researchers, physicians and nationally known experts who dedicate their lives to helping us be happier, healthier and better understand the world around us.\n\nPrior to joining the University in 2018, he spent more than a decade as a newspaper journalist.
