I'm excited to learn alongside my peers and get to care for patients every day.\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nI was very impressed with both the residents and the Med/Peds department during my interview day. Dr. Derhammer, especially, was one of the program directors I was most excited to work with. He showed a genuine passion for the program and for each of the residents.\n\nMadeline Keane, MD\n\nBurnett School of Medicine at TCU\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nSt. Charles, IL\n\nWhere will you live during residency?\n\nWest Town\n\nWhat are your current career plans?\n\nCurrently, I love the idea of being a jack-of-all-trades as a med/peds hospitalist, but I’m also interested in heme/onc and critical care!\n\nWhat are your personal interests?\n\nI love to read, travel, try new restaurants (especially in Chicago!), host theme nights with friends, running and long coffee walks, and recently got back into cross-stitching!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about residency?\n\nI can’t wait to have boundless learning opportunities every day, serving patients of the Chicago area, and to get to know my co-residents, med/peds faculty, and the rest of the team! I’m excited to grow into who I will be as a physician at Loyola.\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nI immediately could sense a culture of caring about the patient as a whole person, placing humanism at the forefront of their medical care, from everyone I spoke with at Loyola on interview day.

I grew up in a very artistic family, so I love singing, playing instruments, and making music with the people I care about. My most recent hobby is pottery, which is now my favorite way to relax. I also love to read, cook, and host elaborate dinner parties!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about residency?\n\nI’m really looking forward to putting all these years of school to use!

Also always in the mood for a good board game night or some relaxation time with my parents' dog!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about residency?\n\nI am most looking forward to the patient interactions. I cannot wait to get the responsibility and privilege to take care of these patients and give them the best care.\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nI choose Loyola for so many reasons, one of which is that this is where my Dad did his pediatrics residency way back when, but also because of the welcoming community that I saw during my interview. I could tell both during the social and the interview that the residents liked being around each other and liked the attendings that they were working with. And it doesn't hurt to get to stay close to home and Chicago.\n\nPGY-2 Residents\n\nGulnihal Akbulut, DO\n\nMidwestern University Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nChicago, IL\n\nWhere will you live during residency?\n\nForest Park, IL\n\nWhat are your current career plans?\n\nMostly undecided and excited to see everything (in true Med-Peds fashion), but currently interested in Combined ID.\n\nWhat are your personal interests?\n\nI enjoy traveling, trying new foods, painting, cuddling my 2 cats, ice skating, and being bad at paddleboarding. Oh! And learning guidelines for the clinical practice of medicine of course!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about residency?\n\nI am looking forward to learning from faculty, peers, and patients at Loyola while figuring out how to be a doctor and serving those in the Chicagoland area.\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nI knew that I liked Loyola when the residents struggled to come up with something they would change about the program during the meet and greet. But I ended up choosing Loyola because it was my favorite interview! I loved the family feel faculty and residents gave, the opportunities for outreach, the location, the huge med-peds presence, etc etc, I could go on and on, but I already matched!\n\nEmily Dobrzynski, DO\n\nDes Moines University College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI grew up in a small part of the southwest suburbs, in a village called Justice!\n\nWhere will you live during residency?\n\nI will be living in the lovely Forest Park, close to work and family.\n\nWhat are your current career plans?\n\nThe world is my oyster! I can see myself in various settings and am open to knowing my desires may change. I hope to use residency as a jumping-off point for any brewing sub-specialty interest. As it stands, I would love to become a combined hospitalist!\n\nWhat are your personal interests?\n\nFresh air, greenery, sunshine! Anything that gets me outside, especially with a good book or good company. I am getting back to my first love (the piano), and I'm always down to find live music.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about residency?\n\nBelieve it or not, after all the chaos of the last 2 years of medical school, I am actually looking forward to a bit of routine. Without the title of \"student,\" I'll be learning, building new habits, and stepping into more meaningful roles. I am looking forward to using all this to better define my styles and identity as a physician. I look forward to seeing who I will be when I come out of training!\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nWhen a close friend and I were trying to carve out our rank lists, we practiced an exercise where we each wrote our programs on tiny pieces of paper. I would choose one for them, and they would choose one for me. In a very serious manner, we handed each other the tiny paper and said, \"Congratulations, you've matched!\" We did this a handful of times, at different times. Still, when I saw Loyola, the feeling I had was overwhelming relief. I actually teared up a little (in a good way). My mind was flooded with all the good things about what my life would be like here. And so that is how I knew!\n\nKatelyn Ferguson, MD\n\nUniversity of Kentucky College of Medicine\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nCincinnati, OH\n\nWhere will you live during residency?\n\nOak Park, IL\n\nWhat are your current career plans?\n\nPrimary Care or Med-Peds combined hospitalist.\n\nWhat are your personal interests?\n\nCooking and baking.

I look forward to learning more about how I can better serve my new community and, of course, exploring the Chicagoland area!\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nFrom interview day, I could tell that Loyola embodied exactly what I was searching for in a residency program - a family atmosphere, a welcoming environment, a place I knew I could comfortably learn and grow while being pushed and inspired by my colleagues to become a more compassionate physician focused on comprehensive, patient-centered care.\n\nSamuel Lubor, MD\n\nLoyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nMundelein, IL\n\nWhere will you live during residency?\n\nOak Park, IL\n\nWhat are your current career plans?\n\nI’m a classic Med-Peds person in that I like a little bit of everything, so I plan on staying general and doing either primary care or dual hospitalist. I would love to precept medical students as well!\n\nWhat are your personal interests?\n\nExploring Chicago’s food and drink scene, cooking Italian food, board game nights with friends, playing the violin, volleyball, travel, dog walking, live music, the Auburn Tigers, and the Chicago White Sox/Blackhawks.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about residency?\n\nI’m most looking forward to learning how to actually be a doctor and all that entails; from teaching sessions on the wards, to meeting patients in clinic, to bonding with my co-residents on night float over delivered food, coffee, and ER admits.\n\nWhy did you choose Loyola?\n\nAs a Stritch grad, I have been lucky to work with our outstanding clinical faculty for four years already, and I have seen how they prioritize resident and medical student education on the wards. That faculty support, as well as the opportunity to work with a diverse and underserved patient population in my favorite city, made Loyola a great choice.\n\nPGY-3 Residents\n\nSofia Ahmed, MD\n\nUniversity of Illinois, Chicago\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nLombard, IL (and living here during residency!)\n\nPersonal interests:\n\nI love cooking, baking bread and desserts, board games or card games, puzzles, and reading.\n\nWhat are your career plans?\n\nRight now I'm most interested in inpatient medicine and pediatrics and medical education but it's always changing.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to?\n\nI'm very excited to be a part of the Loyola Med-Peds family and caring for our diverse and underserved population.
