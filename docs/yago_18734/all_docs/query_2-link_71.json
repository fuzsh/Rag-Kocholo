        "text": "Dr. Miller completed his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2009. While at Johns Hopkins, he was a Pre-doctoral Clinical Research Training Program fellow and earned a Masters of Public Health with a focus in Epidemiology and Biostatistics.\n\nHe completed his surgical internship and urologic residency at the University of Michigan in 2014 and a fellowship in Endourology (kidney stones) and Minimally Invasive Surgery at the University of California San Diego/Kaiser Permanente in 2015.\n\nHe is a board-certified Diplomate of the American Board of Urology and a member of the Endourological Society. He has particular expertise in the management of complex kidney stone disease and use of the DaVinci surgical system for the treatment of prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer.\n\nDr. Miller finds the greatest satisfaction in the opportunity that urology offers to provide interventions that can treat debilitating, even life-threatening diseases while maximizing quality-of-life.\n\nIn his spare time, Dr Miller enjoys exploring the outdoors of the Pacific Northwest, particularly backcountry snowboarding, hiking, and trail running."
