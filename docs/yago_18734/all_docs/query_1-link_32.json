        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nConservation Social Science\n\nGroundbreaking book that examines the essential contribution of the social sciences to understanding and conserving biodiversity across the globe\n\nAuthored by leading scholars at the nexus of social science and biodiversity conservation, Conservation Social Science addresses the growing realization that biodiversity conservation is, at heart, a social phenomenon. Threats to biological diversity are influenced by a wide range of political, economic and cultural factors. The conservation of biodiversity is conceived and carried out by people. Biodiversity conservation is a manifestation of human beliefs and values. Choices about which species and habitats to conserve, how to prioritize efforts, and how to conserve them are inherently social - with consequences not just for wildlife but also human lives and livelihoods.\n\nKey topics covered in this thought-provoking text include:\n\nAn introduction to key social science disciplines and how each field specifically relates to biodiversity conservation\n\nHow to make social sciences an integral part of conservation strategies and initiatives\n\nHow social science theories and analytic approaches can explain and help predict patterns of human behavior\n\nHow biodiversity conservation as a ubiquitous societal phenomenon can provide insights into human society in general\n\nConservation Social Science is an essential, one-of-a-kind survey of novel approaches to explaining and fostering more effective, just, and enduring conservation of biodiversity. It is academically rigorous and comprehensive in scope, yet sufficiently nontechnical and concise to be accessible to a global audience of students, faculty, and environmental professionals and policymakers.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nGroundbreaking book that examines the essential contribution of the social sciences to understanding and conserving biodiversity across the globe\n\nAuthored by leading scholars at the nexus of social science and biodiversity conservation, Conservation Social Science addresses the growing realization that biodiversity conservation is, at heart, a social phenomenon.
