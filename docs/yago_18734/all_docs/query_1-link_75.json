        "meta_description": "Joseph Daniel Miller of Hayward, California, died suddenly Monday, January 23, 2017. He was 82 years old.\n\nJoe was born September 18, 1934 in Delano, California, the son of Daniel Loya Miller and Urbana (Ruiz) Miller. \n\nFor most of his years, he was a resident of Hayward, California. He loved his job working as a machinist for National Can Corporation for 48 years, and was known for being a hard-working and responsible man. However, Joe's first priority was his family, and he always made time for them, taking them on countless adventures as they were growing up, forming wonderful memories that will always be cherished. \n\nAfter retirement, Joe continued to live life to its fullest, always on the go, and creating fun and adventure at every possible opportunity. He had a deep love of the outdoors, and of travelling, and especially loved Mexico, where he travelled extensively. \n\nJoe placed the highest value on family and close friendships, and those fortunate enough to be in his life experienced his generosity and wonderful heart. He was a kind and generous man, and will be deeply missed by his family and friends. \n\nHe leaves his wife Nancy of 48 years; his sons, Daniel Miller and Jose Miller; his daughter, Debra Moses; step-son David Hillis; and step-daughter, Maria Hillis; along with eight grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, many, many nieces and nephews, and lots of good friends. \n\nHe is also survived by his sisters Helen C. Miller, Alicia Miller, Viviana Miller, Dolores Miller-Santos, Virginia Miller, and his lifelong best friend, Miguel Sanchez.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, his sisters Ernestine Paredez and Patricia Miller, and brother Manuel Miller.\n\nA memorial will be held in his honor on Wednesday, February 1, 2017 at 11:30 a.m. at Chapel of the Angels, 40842 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, CA 94538, with reception to immediately follow at Veteran's Memorial Hall, 37154 2nd Street, Fremont, CA 94536.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to the American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) or the American Heart Association (www.heart.org).",
