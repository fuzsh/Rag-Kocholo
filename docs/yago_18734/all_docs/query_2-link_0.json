        "text": "Hello! I am originally from southern West Virginia and grew up in a small town called Princeton. I then attended West Virginia University (Go Mountaineers!) where I majored in Public Health with an emphasis in Community and Population Health and a minor in Biology. I then attended Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, WV. After living in West Virginia my whole life, I decided to make the move to Pittsburgh and am loving it so far! I have broad interests within family medicine including inpatient medicine, FM OB, lifestyle medicine, and academic medicine. Outside of residency, I really enjoy hiking, backpacking, making charcuterie boards, and checking out all the local coffee shops in Pittsburgh."
