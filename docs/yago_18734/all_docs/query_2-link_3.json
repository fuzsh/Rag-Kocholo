        "text": "Daniel Clyde Miller, 74, of Henderson, Nev., passed away April 30, 2023, at Saint Rose Dominican Hospital Siena Campus in Henderson with his family by his side.\n\nDanny was born Aug. 1, 1948, in Johnstown, Pa. His family moved to Glendora, Calif., when he was a young boy and he graduated from Charter Oak High School in Covina, Calif., in 1966. He lived in Huntington Beach, Calif., and Chico, Calif., before settling down in Mariposa, where he was owner of Mariposa Glass from 1987 to 2005. Dan met his wife, Wendy Jay, at Yosemite Bank in 1989 where she worked. They were married in 1993.\n\nDan loved Mariposa and was happiest outdoors camping, fishing and hunting. He retired and sold the glass business in 2005 after a heart attack in 2004. Wendy went back to school and became a physical therapist.\n\nThey traveled for Wendy’s work and lived in a motor home from 2006 to 2013 and lived for three to six months at a time in California, Washington, Arizona and Nevada. They then settled down in Henderson to be near his aging parents who passed away in 2019 and 2020.\n\nMariposa Glass was one of the first businesses to be voted “Business of the Year” during Dan’s ownership. He was a skilled glazier for over 30 years. He was a past director for the Mariposa County Chamber of Commerce, was a member of the Matuca Chapter of the Clampers and loved riding his Harley Davidson. Dan was involved for many years in the Mariposa County Fish & Game Association.\n\nHe loved partying with his family and friends and making people laugh. He will be deeply missed.\n\nDan was preceded in death by his parents, Homer and Joanne Miller, and his mother-in-law, Mary Kay Jay.\n\nDan is survived by his wife of 29 years, Wendy Jay Miller; brothers, Gary Miller (Marilyn) of Sedro Woolley, Wash.; Jeff Miller (Kim) of Henderson; a sister, Tonnie Miller of Vicksburg, Miss.; numerous nieces and nephews; and his dogs, Lucy and Peaches.\n\nA memorial and celebration of life will be planned for October in Mariposa."
