Yet the field faces the challenges of establishing evidence-based linkages between assessment and interventions and of broadening its approaches to culturally diverse populations.\n\nEdited by a leading expert in school neuropsychology, Best Practices in School Neuropsychology: Guidelines for Effective Practice, Assessment, and Evidence-Based Intervention addresses these challenges and their solutions and provides learning specialists and school psychologists with clear coverage and vital information on this burgeoning area of practice within school psychology.\n\nThis insightful reference features comprehensive discussion of:\n\nCurrent school neuropsychological assessment and intervention models\n\nBest practices in assessing cognitive processes\n\nAn overview of what neuroscience offers to the practice of school neuropsychology\n\nHow school neuropsychology fits within a Response to Intervention (RTI) model\n\nThe rationale for the importance of school psychologists’ collaboration with parents, educators, and other professionals to maximize services to children\n\nClinical applications of school neuropsychology with special populations, academic disabilities, processing deficits, and medical disorders\n\nUnique challenges in working with culturally diverse populations\n\nFeaturing contributions from internationally renowned school psychologists, neuropsychologists, clinicians, and academics, Best Practices in School Neuropsychology is the first book of its kind to present best practices and evidence-informed guidelines for the assessment and intervention of children with learning disabilities, as well as other issues practitioners working with children encounter in school settings.\n\nDANIEL C. MILLER, PhD, is a Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at Texas Woman’s University in Denton, Texas.
