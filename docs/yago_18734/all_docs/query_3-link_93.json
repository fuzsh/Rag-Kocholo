        "text": "Three people, reportedly members of the same Nevada family, were arrested after a TikTok video alleging racist behavior during a vintage car show in Virginia City went viral.\n\nThe Storey County Sheriff's Office confirmed the arrests of Gary Miller, Janis Miller and Tiffany Miller following an investigation into the incident that occurred at the Hot August Nights kickoff event on Friday.\n\nGary Miller has been charged with a gross misdemeanor for Breach of Peace under Nevada law, while Janis Miller faces a misdemeanor battery charge. Tiffany Miller has been charged with obstructing and delaying a peace officer, also a misdemeanor. All three were said to be members of the same family according to the Reno Gazette-Journal.\n\nAll three were booked into the Storey County Detention Center, with bail amounts set individually.\n\nThe video was recorded by Ricky Johnson, who goes by \"@unclerickyd1\" online, before it was removed from TikTok for violating community guidelines.\n\nIn the video, which has amassed over a million views, Johnson claims that Gary Miller made racist remarks, including referencing a \"hanging tree\" and using a racial slur. The altercation escalated, with some bystanders appearing to support Miller, and Janis Miller attempting to usher Johnson away.\n\nIn an interview with cable news station KRNV-TV, Johnson said he was in Virginia City on Friday asking people to sign a petition to get an issue on the November ballot.\n\n\"The first thing that this guy said was, 'Get the f*** out of my face,' with the N-word,\" Johnson told KRNV.\n\nThe Storey County Sheriff's Office stated that they are continuing to investigate the incident and are reviewing all available evidence.\n\n\"The Storey County Sheriff's Office does not tolerate hate or racist speech of any kind toward any person or group of persons,\" Sheriff Mike Cullen said in a press release issued Wednesday evening.\n\nJohnson expressed frustration on TikTok on Wednesday about his original video being removed from the platform because of community guideline violations, but thanked his supporters for their \"love and support.\"\n\nHowever, he noted that the video continues to circulate widely on other social media platforms, including his Instagram account.Johnson also set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to seek legal action, describing the incident as \"traumatic and scary.\"\n\nThe fundraiser has garnered over $42,000 of its $100,000 goal as of Thursday.\n\nHot August Nights has distanced itself from the individuals involved in the video, revoking their event registrations and stressing that they were not affiliated with the event's staff or volunteers, the organization wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Storey County Sheriff's Office said, with support from the State of Nevada, that it was investigating threatening and harassing phone calls reportedly received by community members in the wake of the video's release."
