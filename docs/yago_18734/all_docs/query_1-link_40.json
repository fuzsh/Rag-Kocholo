Additionally, she has worked closely with imminent breast imaging specialists including Drs. Làszló Tabar, Edward Sickles, Daniel Kopans and Michael Linver. In August of 2011, she completed a one-week internship at the world renowned Laszlo Tabar Clinic in Falun, Sweden.\n\nSince 1985, Louise has served on numerous committees for national professional societies such as the American College of Radiology, the Society of Breast Imaging, and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists to develop and update mammography education and skill-based training standards. She has also donated thousands of hours as a volunteer for the American Cancer Society. Collectively, she has taught or trained more than 50,000 technologists throughout the world, consulted in over 300 breast centers in the US, and has been invited as a consultant/lecturer in over 20 foreign countries.\n\nAbroad, Louise has volunteered and donated her time and expertise to help develop, coordinate and implement mammography screening programs and breast health education for mammography technologists and other professionals in countries such as the Ukraine, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia. In the Middle East, Louise is a member of the International Oversight Committee for the Jordanian Breast Cancer Project and served as the Lead Trainer for a major training of Breast Health professionals in Amman.\n\nFrom 1990 – 2010, she served as primary coordinator and senior faculty for Quality, Care and Commitment (QCC) Mammography Seminars. These courses have provided didactic and hands-on training for thousands of radiologic technologists in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 2014, Louise authored a Positioning Guidebook, the first published in over 20 years. In 1999, Louise co-authored a textbook, The Handbook of Mammography, 4th and 5th Edition. In 2020, Louise co-authored Image Quality & Positioning Problem Solving for Breast Imagers: Meeting EQUIP Standards. These publications feature her unique teaching/learning approaches and specialized techniques.\n\nIn 2011, Louise was awarded the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCBC) Impact Award, the first mammography technologist to be chosen for this prestigious national honor, which recognizes outstanding dedication, commitment, achievement and overall impact on breast cancer detection worldwide. In March of 2017, the National Consortium of Breast Centers nominated Louise Miller as Fellow of NCBC. This designation recognizes Louise for her expertise, knowledge and leadership in breast related contributions and education in the field.\n\nIn April of 2017, Louise was given the distinguished title of the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) Honorary Fellow. This award is given annually to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to breast imaging. Furthermore, in July 2017 Ms. Miller was appointed as Consumer Representative for the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee, which advises the FDA on the mammography related quality issues and the implementation of MQSA. Shortly following this appointment Louise was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Her diagnosis, treatment and recovery has provided her with an additional level of commitment, experience, knowledge and compassion as an educator.\n\nLouise lives in San Diego, CA and enjoys traveling, hiking, swimming, mentoring, teaching and cooking for her appreciative friends and family. She receives support from her big, wild and wacky family which foremost, include her daughter Erin, and adult grandsons Alex and Jeffrey."
