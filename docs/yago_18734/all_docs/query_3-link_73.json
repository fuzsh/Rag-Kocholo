        "text": "Monica Ellis\n\nGuest Artist\n\nBassoonist Monica Ellis is a founding member of the twice Grammy-nominated wind quintet Imani Winds, which in their 25th season continues to dazzle audiences with their dynamic playing, adventurous programming, and commitment to outreach, new works, and collaborations.\n\nEllis’s strong work ethic was instilled early on by her mother and father, the late jazz saxophonist Clarence Oden. She is executive director and tour manager for Imani Winds, co-artistic director for the Imani Winds Chamber Music Festival, and treasurer for the Imani Winds Foundation.\n\nA self-proclaimed “band kid,” growing up in her beloved city of Pittsburgh, Ellis played clarinet, saxophone, and piano. After being introduced to the bassoon in middle school, she began studying with Mark Pancerev, of the Pittsburgh Symphony and went on to receive her Bachelor of Music degree from Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, studying with George Sakakeeny. While at Oberlin, her desire to connect with others flourished through her participation in the Panama Project, a month-long camp for young Panamanian musicians. She received her Master of Music degree from the Juilliard School and Professional Studies Certificate from Manhattan School of Music in the Orchestral Performance Program, studying with Frank Morelli at both institutions.\n\nRecording credits include nine albums with Imani Winds on the labels Bright Shiny Things, Koch International Classics, EOne, and EMI Classics.

Her recording projects include the CD’s Carillon Sky, Dialogues and Dragon Rhyme. One review in Fanfare Magazine calls her playing “suave, subtly nuanced, and technically secure in its every gesture,” while another refers to her “melting tone and touching sensitivity.” She also has an ongoing recording and performing series entitled Pink Ink that is dedicated to promoting the music of living women composers. Committed to new music, its commissions and premieres include 52 compositions.\n\nKoffman performs in a contemporary chamber music duo, The Irrelevants, with violist Tim Deighton. Their “excellent playing” of several new works in a New York recital was noted in The Strad. She also recently completed tours of Italy, Cyprus, and the United States as tenor saxophonist in the Transcontinental Saxophone Quartet. Additionally, she appears frequently as a soloist, chamber musician, and clinician.\n\nIn addition to traditional performance spaces, Koffman enjoys bringing live music to unexpected places.
