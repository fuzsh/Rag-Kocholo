Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat are influential forms of communication, of sharing photos, and of keeping up with friends. Increasingly, these common social media sites are becoming useful tools for authorities to track suspects and detect crime, sometimes even serving as key evidence in criminal cases. A casual post on Facebook can have huge consequences for those who don't think before they click. We especially need to educate teens about the enormous consequences Internet posts can have.\n\nRead More\n\nJuly 10, 2015\n\nKeep Your Teen Driver Safe\n\nPosted by Daniel Miller | Summer is the time when many teens begin to learn to drive for the first time. Getting a driver's license is exciting for teens, but often terrifying for parents. Unfortunately, most teens don't understand the full responsibility that driving a vehicle involves. They simple see driving a car as a mode of freedom from their parents. Because teens don't often realize the seriousness with which they should treat driving, teens are at a higher risk for getting into an accident. In fact, teens aged 16-19 are three times more likely to be in a fatal crash than older drivers. Luckily, there are plenty of ways for teen drivers to stay safe behind the wheel.\n\nRead More\n\nJune 25, 2015\n\nWhat to do if You Experience Workplace Discrimination\n\nPosted by Daniel Miller | Workplace discrimination, when left unchallenged, can become a serious issue and a hindrance to a person's career.

Going to the lake seems like a carefree and easy trip to take, whether with friends or family. Some people enjoy swimming around and sitting out by the lake, while others are more active and enjoy boating and jet skiing. Unfortunately, a fun day in the sun can quickly turn into a nightmare in the case of a jet ski or boating accident or other watercraft mishap. No one expects such a disaster to happen to them, which means that often when a boating accident does occur, those involved are not prepared and do not know what to do. By being prepared for the worst, you can reduce your chances of being in an accident, and know what to do when involved in a boating accident.\n\nRead More\n\nJune 15, 2015\n\nLandlords: How to Resolve Tenant Disputes\n\nPosted by Daniel Miller | As many people already know, owning and maintaining a rental property is a lot of work. Beyond the everyday maintenance duties to keep the property and house kept up and functioning properly, landlords must deal with tenants. While some landlord-tenant relationships run smoothly and encounter no real problems, many landlords face tenants who don't care about treating the property with respect, who may even do damage to the property, and who don't want to take responsibility for the conditions they agreed upon in the lease agreement. It is important to know the best way to handle the many different types of tenant disputes and problems that you may face as a landlord.\n\nRead More\n\nJune 03, 2015\n\nKnow Your Landlord Rights for Summer Troubles\n\nPosted by Daniel Miller | As a landlord, you can face a number of frustrating and money-draining issues, such as unpaid rent, property damage, and landlord-tenant disputes.

However, it's doubtful that these handheld BAC detectors can actually prevent a DUI.\n\nRead More\n\nMay 15, 2015\n\nYou May Not \"Like\" Getting Served via Facebook\n\nPosted by Daniel Miller | Recent rulings by more than one judge indicate that Facebook is gaining ground as a means for service of process.
