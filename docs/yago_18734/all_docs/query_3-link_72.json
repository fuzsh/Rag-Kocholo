        "text": "In Central Slovakia, homes \"grow\" and get cluttered with age. Cabinets and closets are used to house this profusion of possessions. However, their very role as containers for precious and meaningful objects—such as expensive cut glass or family heirlooms—gives them a poetic and symbolic weight that belies their modest appearance. Based on anthropological fieldwork, this article investigates how practices of collection, storage, and display of particular genres of domestic objects create spaces of intimacy in the home that work to perpetuate a sense of family history amongst middle-aged Slovaks in and around the provincial town of Banská Bystrica. Inspired by the historiography of Walter Benjamin, as well as his biographical writings, the focus of the study lies on the relation between memory and material culture in the home. Rather than relying on narratives of consumption and aesthetic choice recently popular amongst anthropologists studying domestic decor, it forms an attempt to reengage with literature that looks to the home as a site for the poetic imagination in order to grasp sentiments that are rarely verbalized.\n\nThis article uses “The Ballad of the Tyrannical Husband,” a late fifteenth-century text that associates men with the outdoors and women with the home and the domestic, as a springboard for a comparative analysis of rural and urban housing to explore questions concerning the gender division of space over the course of the English later Middle Ages. The article questions the value of rigid models of gender difference that both normative texts and numbers of modern scholars propose. Drawing upon extant late medieval probate inventories and archaeological evidence, it explores rather different cultural norms between peasant and bourgeois society as reflected in the physical fabric and furnishings of homes. It further considers differences between different levels of society and over time. The article advocates an interdisciplinary methodology and the exploitation of narrative sources, literary or otherwise, to interrogate social practice and the meanings of space.\n\nThis article examines the meanings of home possessions and the connection of these meanings to migrants’ identity and culture, based on research investigating the homes of Russian migrants in the United Kingdom. Focusing on several types of objects (religious items, folk souvenirs, and books in the Russian language) that are often found in migrants’ homes, this paper looks at variations in the meanings of such home artifacts, as well as various strategies of self-identification utilized by migrants to negotiate their cultural identity and sense of belonging. The data demonstrates two main variations in the way Russian identity is expressed at home. The first category of informants, “refusers,” reflects the identity and experiences of those with an ambivalent attachment towards the UK; whereas the second, “acceptors,” relates to those who have a positive image of the UK and use various means to integrate themselves into the host culture. Based on interview material, I discuss several case studies that show how these variations in participants’ sense of identity are linked to the meaning of home possessions.\n\nThesis (PhDArchitectureandDesign)--University of South Australia, 2005. 'Home' in a country with a notorious history of division becomes both a material and symbolic handle for belonging. The thesis looks at the nature of home making and home building as it is subjected to conflicts of tradition and domestic design organisation. The material objects together with the physical as well as the psychological spaces of home in South Africa exemplify the struggle with the ironies of a nascent modern era. The thesis addresses the combination of home and modernity in a place and at a time when the one seemed to cancel the other. The role of authorities and missionaries in determining what home was to particularly categorised people and also what modernity should represent contributes to the subtle formulations of meaning in the narrative of this thesis. South African design and material culture precedes a discussion of land as home and visual culture's expression of this. This expression is seen in the monumentalising of struggles for a home country and more specifically a homeland. Some of these visual expressions are in the form of architecture and some as sculpture, painting or drawing. The visual art of the time informs and comments upon the notion of home as a place of belonging, longing or a place that is lost. A subtle reading of this ostensibly modern art is that it is strangely disengaged from its subject matter. Notions of white supremacy in line with a romantic nationalism based on theocratic beliefs in the 'promised land' are addressed in relation to these and other visual documents of the time. Domestic design advice and advertising for the home provides insight into the home as an ideal as well as the home as an example of ostensible modernity. Issues such as fashion, taste, relevant theories of consumption together with the constant denial of African consumption form the background to the chapter's arguments on white South African middle class consumer reticence. The printed face of South Africa's supposed domestic modernity in the advertisements and decorating columns is balanced by a discussion of deeper psychological and emotional interiorities, these are evidenced in biographies, letters, oral family histories and historical novels. The possible meaning of home is also viewed through the lens of historical documentation, which shows the role of authorities and missionaries as partial players in the construction of modern domesticities. The notion of domesticity and its association with western progress or civilisation is shown to be filled with anxieties relating to hygiene and order."
