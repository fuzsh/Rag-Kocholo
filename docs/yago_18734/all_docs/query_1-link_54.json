        "text": "Thank you Dr. Feyten for that kind introduction.\n\nAs Dr. Feyten mentioned in her remarks, a \"funny thing happened on my way to my retirement\". Actually it has been quite a wonderful development, which I am honored to be a part of. Dr. Woodcock and I have known each other as professional colleagues and friends for over 20 years. We have collaborated on several book and research projects and have presented together at national conferences. We share a common passion for neurocognitive theory and assessment.\n\nIn January, Dr. Woodcock called me to discuss his generous offer of having our university and myself assume the duties of preserving his legacy. Needless to say, I was initially speechless, and of course thrilled and honored. Over the years, Dr. Woodcock has funded the non-profit Woodcock-Munoz Foundation from his many test royalties and now he and the Board of Directors have agreed to transfer those funds over to our university.\n\nIn February, Dr. Woodcock and the Woodcock-Munoz Foundation President visited the Texas Woman's University's Denton campus and initial agreements to establish the Richard W. Woodcock Endowment Fund and the Woodcock Institute for the Advancement of Neurocognitive Research and Applied Practice were drafted. Let me take a moment to thank the Woodcock-Munoz Foundation Board of Directors for making this generous gift to our university.\n\nThe Woodcock-Munoz Foundation will be donating nearly $10 million dollars to the TWU Woodcock Endowment Fund within the next few weeks. The Woodcock-Munoz Foundation will be winding down their operations this year, with any remaining funds being transferred to TWU by October.\n\nJust a note that the TWU Woodcock Endowment Fund is a charitable fund that anyone can contribute to in the future for a tax donation.\n\nDr. Woodcock will also be graciously donating annually to the TWU Woodcock Endowment Fund additional royalty income from the sale of the Woodcock-Johnson Fourth Edition Tests of Cognitive Abilities, Academic Achievement, and Oral Language. These funds should amount to over 1 million a year over the next decade.\n\nAnnual interest from the Woodcock Endowment Fund will be used to create and maintain the Woodcock Institute on the TWU Denton campus and I am honored to serve as the Executive Director for the institute starting September 1st.\n\nThe activities of the Woodcock Institute will include:\n\nFunding of research grants that focus on expanding neurocognitive assessment theories and practice.\n\nSponsoring a bi-annual Richard Woodcock Conference were grant recipients can share their findings (with the next conference being held at TWU in the 2016).\n\nProvide two outstanding doctoral dissertation awards, one for a TWU Doctoral student and the other for any other doctoral student.\n\nA major initiative will be to start an interdisciplinary clinic on campus that will provide assessment services to children and their families. TWU is uniquely posed to provide such services to the public due to the quality graduate training programs we offer.\n\nSeek additional funding to promote the mission of the university.\n\nI would be happy to answer any questions later about the Woodcock Institute activities, but now I would like to tell all of you a little bit about our generous benefactor, Dr. Richard W. Woodcock.\n\nDr. Woodcock lives in San Diego, CA with his wife Elizabeth.\n\nDr. Woodcock has a wide background in education and psychology. He has held a variety of positions, including elementary school teacher, school psychologist, college professor, director of special education, and test developer. He earned his doctorate from the University of Oregon with a dual major in statistics and psycho-education. He later undertook training in neuropsychology as a postdoctoral fellow at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Woodcock has held academic faculty appointments at Western Oregon University, the University of Northern Colorado, and George Peabody College of Vanderbilt University. He has worked as the Editor and Director of Research for a major education publishing company, American Guidance Service.\n\nDr. Woodcock's test publications are widely used internationally. They include tests of braille for the blind, reading tests, tests to measure auditory processing, language proficiency in English and Spanish, adaptive behavior, academic achievement levels in children and adults in both English and Spanish, sensorimotor skills, and probably most importantly tests of cognitive abilities.\n\nOver his career he has been one of the most prolific and influential figures in the field of applied psychological assessment. I am very pleased that Dr. Woodcock will be joining the TWU faculty as a research professor in the Department of Psychology and Philosophy starting this fall where he will continue to collaborate with other faculty on research projects and provide occasional guest lectures.\n\nI could go on and on about Dr. Woodcock's achievements and his international contributions to the field of psychology and education, but now it is my pleasure to introduce to all of you Dr. Richard W. Woodcock who will make a few comments."
