        "text": "When I came to Paylocity in 2017, I was excited to join an incredible team and culture, and to make an impact for our business, our clients, and our employees. Today, I serve as President and CEO and partner with the rest of Paylocity leadership to guide our teams as we #EarnItEveryDay! And I remain as passionate as ever about continuing to develop our culture while helping drive our growth (#GrowthFuelsOpportunity).\n\nI’ve held multiple software company leadership roles throughout my career in operations, product, strategy, and finance – after starting out as a corporate lawyer and investment banker.\n\nI earned a Bachelor of Arts from Houghton College and my Master of Business Administration and Juris Doctor from The Ohio State University (Go Bucks!). When I’m not at work, you can find me enjoying the outdoors!\n\n“I love how we strive to make a difference for our clients and their employees — and our employees — every single day. It makes working at Paylocity the perfect combination of fun and rewarding.”\n\nA company is only as good as its people. Today, I'm fortunate to work alongside Toby Williams, our President & CEO and be surrounded by the best people in the business—from our leadership team to software engineers, sales, and all team members who assist our clients daily. They have supported me every step of the way. Part of my role as Executive Chairman is partnering with our Product & Technology team to drive the company’s growth and success, and that really excites me.\n\nWe’ve done a lot of great things here at Paylocity and something that continues to make me proud is the strong internal culture we’ve built. Because not only do our employees deserve it, our clients do as well. It all stems from my belief that a great culture is the key to delivery an exceptional client experience. And when you look at Paylocity that’s what we do best. We partner with our clients to help them with whatever they need today, so we can move forward together toward a tomorrow that is full of opportunity.\n\nI hold a Bachelor of Business Administration from Wilfrid Laurier University and a Master of Business Administration from Queen’s University – both located in Ontario, Canada, which is where I’m from. (Proud Canadian that I am.) When I’m not working, I spend my free time with my wife and our four kids.\n\nIn fact, I often ask them for their reaction to product and marketing ideas as a way of gauging their appeal to Gen Z. I strongly believe interacting with as many different people as possible allows a leader to develop a broader perspective and ultimately make better decisions. So in a way, I have my kids to thank for that too.\n\n“True partnership happens when you communicate purpose fully with openness and transparency. When you commit yourself to really helping each other move forward toward something different so you can achieve something greater than were you’re at today. That’s one of the things that makes Paylocity so great. We’re more than a provider. We’re a partner to all our customers.”\n\nI joined Paylocity in 2013, and as CFO I lead our finance, accounting, legal, and procurement teams. It’s also my responsibility to manage interactions with the investment community, which means communicating the financial results and the strategic direction of the company to our investors, who mean a lot to me personally, as I was a key member of the team who helped take Paylocity public in 2014.\n\nI earned a Bachelor of Science Summa Cum Laude from the University at Buffalo and a Master of Business Administration from Cornell, and have spent my whole career working closely with companies on various accounting and reporting topics related to equity offerings and other capital markets transactions. Outside the office, I spend most of my time with my wife and two daughters. But I also try to sneak in a few rounds of golf here and there whenever I can.\n\n“One thing that sets Paylocity apart is, while we’re squarely focused on growth, it’s not at all costs. Every decision we make is made with our employees and clients in mind, and I think that is a real differentiator.”\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development and Chief Strategy Officer at Paylocity, I partner with our leadership team in the development and execution of Paylocity's strategy. I joined the team in 2018 with significant experience in strategy, focused on the software/tech sector, as well as corporate finance and investment banking, including mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, and debt financings.\n\nA native North Carolinian, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy with a minor in Economics from Duke University and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Outside the office, I put my strategic mind to work thinking about how I can spend more time outdoors. Different geographies. Different seasons. Each one prime for a different activity: hiking, snowboarding, snowshoeing, sea kayaking, snorkeling. I love them all.\n\n“I am proud to be part of a team that’s developing and executing a strategy focused on the promise of tomorrow and driven by customer needs.”\n\nI joined Paylocity in 2018 after spending more than 20 years serving in senior financial leadership and operational roles. I was excited to accept a position at Paylocity, as I saw it as a tremendous opportunity to highlight and expand my roles in all aspects of the HCM industry.\n\nAfter obtaining my Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting and Master of Business Administration in Finance from Saint Bonaventure University, I achieved my Certified Public Accountant’s certification and joined KPMG as a senior leader in a public accounting role. I then moved to the lead global audit function at Black & Decker. In 2006, I transitioned to the HCM space where I served in senior leadership roles overseeing areas in finance, operations, and sales enablement for Paychex and Trinet. In so doing, I’ve enjoyed the ability to touch every aspect of the HCM industry from payroll to PEO to ASO, to retirement and insurance services.\n\nAt Paylocity, I’ve had the honor of serving in various senior level roles, including Chief Accounting Officer, Vice President of Client Tax Operations, and currently Vice President of Finance & Chief Risk and Compliance Officer.\n\nOutside of the office, you will find me in Montana casting flies to rising trout or attending an SEC game somewhere with my daughters shouting “Roll Tide!” and “Go Gamecocks!”.\n\n“We have an amazing culture here. That’s not a tagline; it’s the cornerstone DNA in how we approach our work, our relationships, our innovation, and our client service. I’m grateful to be a part of a company that has such a strong commitment to always doing the right thing.”\n\nSuperior service and industry-leading technology are the hallmark of Paylocity — our people and our products. And as Senior Vice President of Sales, I’m focused on capitalizing on both. I came to Paylocity with more than two decades of payroll experience, which helps me lead sales nationally for each of our segments: enterprise, mid-market, and small business. Throughout my career, I’ve always been passionate about sales as well as leadership. Before Paylocity, I served as Vice President of Enterprise Sales at National Cash Register and successfully led a team that serviced companies with $3.5 billion to $100 million in annual revenue. Before that, I managed a winning team of more than 350 leaders and 1,800 direct sales associates.\n\nTravel just comes with the territory in sales, so naturally, I’ve got roots all over the country. I’m a native of upstate New York. I’m a proud 1994 graduate of Northern Michigan University (go Wildcats!). And I currently live near Atlanta with my wife Amy and our two daughters, Alexa and Erica. In my free time, you can find me hanging with my “home” team, relaxing with my family in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\n“Sales at Paylocity is being able to devote your energy and effort to sales distribution and partner engagement. That’s what happens when you’re backed by an amazing product and impeccable implementation and service.”\n\nAs Chief Information Security Officer, the ultimate goal of my team is to keep the private information of our many customers and employees safe from undue harm or access. The best part of my job is being able to work collaboratively with nearly every part of our business, leveraging my natural curiosity to help strike the right balance between managing our digital risk while allowing teams to operate at the same level of innovation that made Paylocity the market leader it is today.\n\nI have dedicated the last 18 years of my career to cybersecurity, in both industry and consulting positions. Before Paylocity, I worked in various leadership roles as a Director at KPMG, where I helped the world’s largest companies solve their most complex problems.\n\nI was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, not too far from our headquarters. I received my bachelor’s degree in network security from DePaul University and have stayed in the city ever since. In the moments not related to Cybersecurity, I enjoy cooking, playing video games, and finding new excuses not to exercise.\n\n“Paylocity’s security culture is among the best that I’ve witnessed. The importance is driven from the top down, and everyone has secured our customer’s data as top of mind. Security is usually seen as an impediment in most businesses; it is an amazing thing to see the level eagerness of an entire company rally around your group’s mission.”\n\nAs Chief Technology Officer, Senior Vice President (Engineering and Product), at Paylocity, I am excited to be a part of the transformation, building human capital management (HCM) technology that improves our clients’ workplaces and experiences. The HCM space is evolving and driving a lot of much-needed change, and at Paylocity our values promote a strong culture that not only encourages our teams to listen to our clients while building for the future but also respect each other’s unique backgrounds and values. I strongly align with Paylocity in terms of culture, perspective, and the impact that we want to have on people. I am grateful to be a member of this amazing team.\n\nMy experience spans across 15 years in the engineering space, leading and mentoring teams globally for companies such as AOL, Netflix, Intuit, and most recently Atlassian, where I was Head of Engineering, leading a team of more than 400, responsible for the product and core experiences serving over 25 million customers.\n\nWhen I am not in “build” mode for Paylocity specifically, I spend time with my girls. I have 2 daughters, and my world revolves around them. I think they sense that and have started to take advantage of that, which I love.\n\n“As a leader, I strive to build high-performing teams by bringing customers closer to the makers. The most exciting part of my job is the people. Once we have the right environment, organizations can deliver value to delight the customer.”\n\nAs Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), I enjoy the privilege of overseeing the strategy for the people and culture initiatives at Paylocity. Our HR teams work with leaders across the organization to translate business requirements into an executable talent strategy that supports long-term employee growth and development.\n\nI joined Paylocity in 2022, bringing more than 20 years of dedicated and progressive HR experience. I’m especially looking forward to leveraging my many years as a change agent and leader in high-tech companies experiencing tremendous growth and transformation. As an HCM company that puts people first, Paylocity is the perfect place for me to exercise my passion for HR’s unique role in enabling the success of individuals and the business as a whole.\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of Michigan (Go Blue!) and started my HR career in automotive advertising in Detroit. After six wonderful years working abroad in London, I returned to the States and continued in the technology industry in the Northern Virginia area. Most recently, I spent more than seven years in the dynamic higher education tech space, leading several areas of HR at Ellucian and supporting the business through significant private equity transactions and acquisitions. Outside the office, you can find me with my family on one of the many trails, rivers, or lakes in Northern Virginia, or planning our next big travel adventure.\n\n“I feel so fortunate to contribute to the impressive growth and continued success of Paylocity. It’s clear from our culture, decisions, and everyday actions that people are the heart of how the business moves forward together — with both our employees and our clients.”\n\nAs Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development, I lead a talented group of individuals that are responsible for driving the company’s mergers and acquisitions (M&A), business development, and corporate-level strategic initiatives. Prior to joining Paylocity in 2019, I worked for Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, gaining experience through several roles that spanned M&A, corporate finance, capital markets, regulatory risk management, and operations research.\n\nI graduated from The Pennsylvania State University with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and earned a Master of Business Administration with high honors from the University of Chicago (Booth). I currently live in the Charlotte metro area, and when I’m not working, I enjoy exploring the nearby beaches and mountains with my wife and three children.\n\n“A key factor that brought me to Paylocity was the company’s focus on people and culture, as well as growth and business success. This provides an environment where our employees are motivated to bring the best version of themselves every day to drive differentiated outcomes for our clients.”\n\nAs the Vice President of Infrastructure Engineering at Paylocity, I lead a diverse team spanning Corporate Infrastructure, Public Cloud and Data Center Infrastructure, Developer Productivity (DevOps), Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and FinOps. My focus is on orchestrating multiple teams with a singular goal: ensuring customer success remains at the forefront of everything we do.\n\nIn addition to my role at Paylocity, I serve as the President of the DevOps Institute, Silicon Valley chapter, and as a committee chair within the FinOps foundation, where I’m committed to shaping industry standards.\n\nMy leadership journey includes pivotal roles in global enterprises such as SAP and Salesforce, where at Salesforce, I spearheaded Infrastructure, DevOps, and SRE teams for the world's largest iPaaS. Successfully managing billions of transactions daily, I honed my skills in delivering high-performance solutions at scale.\n\nJoining Paylocity, I was drawn to the tangible impact our products and services have on thousands of employees. Three key pillars—payroll, enhanced feedback, and improved access to benefits—resonated with me, reflecting the fundamental needs we address for our customers. Championing innovation, ensuring seamless feature availability, and driving overall excellence across our teams aligns with our mission to better serve our customers.\n\nMy academic background includes a bachelor's degree in Management and Information Systems from Queen's University, Belfast. Currently residing in the California Bay Area, I am not only dedicated to our professional pursuits, but also passionate about community service. Alongside my wife and two children, I actively contribute to various community initiatives. Outside the professional arena, I enjoy hiking and a broad spectrum of outdoor activities.\n\nAs VP of Talent Management and Program Delivery at Paylocity, I have the honor of leading a best-in-class team of professionals who partner with business leaders to support the growth of Paylocity and each team member in it. My role includes the strategy and execution of our talent management, leadership, and organizational effectiveness, learning and development, internal communications, HR thought leadership, and HR PMO functions. My goal is to bring a business mindset, collaborative leadership, and high impact initiatives to improve the employee experience and help leaders lead through change.\n\nWith 25 years of human capital management, consulting, and professional services experience, I developed my expertise at large global organizations such as Bank of America and Verizon, and in best-in-class consulting firms Forrester Research and Impact Performance Group. As an HR pro and tech enthusiast, I am thrilled to work at a company that delivers the most modern HCM experience for HR pros and employees while nurturing a client and employee-focused culture.\n\nI earned my master’s in business administration, with a marketing concentration, from Bentley University and a bachelor’s degree in communications from the University of New Hampshire.\n\nA native New Englander, living in Winchester Massachusetts, allows me to spend time with my large extended family enjoying four beautiful seasons of outdoor activities and cheering on great Boston sports teams.\n\nAt Paylocity, we are committed to providing our clients with the best service combined with our industry leading technology. As Vice President of Client Services, my team is responsible for providing an effortless experience that makes joining the Paylocity family easy for clients. I am fortunate to lead a group of amazing individuals who are committed to ensuring we deliver on the value of our solution. I also enjoy working with teams across the organization to fulfill our promise of moving forward together.\n\nBefore joining Paylocity, I spent 20 years in the human capital management space holding various leadership roles in both finance and operations. I earned my Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting from The University of Notre Dame (GO IRISH!). Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family and taking in all that Upstate New York has to offer. In the summer you can also find me on the golf course enjoying time with family and friends.\n\n“I am proud to be part of a team this committed to the employee experience and driven to provide solutions to our clients’ ever-changing business needs. We combine an amazing culture with passionate people and best-in-class technology to create something special.”\n\nAt Paylocity, I play a pivotal role in ensuring our clients have an exceptional experience. What resonates with me deeply about PCTY is our commitment to collaborative partnerships and actively incorporating client feedback to deliver a modernized experience across our comprehensive range of products and services.\n\nI’ve spent my entire career around the technology industry. Before joining Paylocity, I spent 15 years advising SaaS companies and their private equity investors to drive growth and optimize operations. Earlier in my career, I held a number of strategy and operational roles at tech companies including Firefly Mobile, NAVTEQ, IBM, and Motorola.\n\nI hold a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Actively engaged with my alma mater, Cornell University, I serve as an alumni admissions ambassador committee chair. I'm also an emeritus board member of Steep Theatre Company and have previously served on the boards of MAPSCorps and the Technology Services Industry Association.\n\nBeyond my professional pursuits, when I'm not immersed in enhancing client experience, I'm typically planning our family's next adventure to a faraway destination.\n\nAt Paylocity, I lead the company’s legal strategy and initiatives. My job is to help the business navigate the ever-evolving legal landscape so Paylocity can focus on doing what it does best — delivering the highest quality technology and service to our clients.\n\nBefore I joined Paylocity in 2020, I spent several years as the Corporate and Securities Counsel at Motorola Solutions where I focused on corporate governance, corporate initiatives, SEC compliance, and ESG. I started my career as a corporate associate at Skadden in Chicago primarily spending my time on mergers and acquisitions, SEC reporting, and corporate governance.\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from Emory University and received my law degree from Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.\n\nWhen I’m not tackling legal matters for Paylocity, you can find me and my husband tackling the busy schedules of our 5 and 7-year-old daughters.\n\n“One of the reasons I was drawn to Paylocity is the community culture. Everyone is willing to come together, roll up their sleeves and create solutions to problems that aren’t necessarily their direct problem. There is passion for our product engrained in the PCTY culture and customers should rest easy knowing there are 6,000+ minds at work creating and iterating on the most thoughtful HCM solutions.”\n\nAs Vice President of Sales for Enterprise at Paylocity, I oversee the Enterprise Sales organization. I have extensive global sales management experience, having led enterprise and channel sales teams for various public and private software companies.\n\nBefore joining Paylocity, I was Chief Revenue Officer at Calabrio, a leading developer of workforce optimization and analytics solutions. Prior to that, I served as Chief Revenue Officer at CentralSquare Technologies, which provides solutions for public safety and public administration.\n\nI was also Senior Vice President of North American Markets at Ellucian, a top ERP provider for higher education. Earlier in my career, I held roles including Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Corporate Reimbursement Services, Inc. and Vice President of Sales at Illume Software.\n\nI spent my first 11 years at PTC (PTC:NASDAQ), where I held multiple sales and sales management positions, including Senior Vice President for the Americas Channel Sales and Vice President for Worldwide Inside Sales, as well as a two-year sales assignment in China.\n\nBefore entering the tech industry, I served as a Captain in the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy family time, sports, and investing. I am an Eagle Scout Coach for Scouts BSA, serve on the board for Sudbury Youth Basketball, and am active in my community. I hold a B.S. in Political Science from Loyola University Maryland.\n\nAs Vice President of User Experience, I am responsible for leading a cross-functional team of designers and researchers focused on transforming customer and employee experiences in our software. I partner closely with product management, engineering, sales, marketing, and client services to ensure we are crafting simple, easy, and meaningful experiences that delight our users.\n\nWith a career spanning over two decades in the tech industry, I have held executive design leadership roles in high-growth global enterprise software companies such as Citrix, Cvent, Wrike, and SAP SuccessFactors. My expertise lies in transforming design strategy, vision, and experiences to consumer-grade standards for business software products, particularly in the realms of events and hospitality, human capital management, and social and collaboration.\n\nI hold a bachelor’s degree from East Carolina University and have a specialized background in human factors design—where art and science meet design for technology. I reside in Maryland with my two teen daughters and a Bengal cat. Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy live music, while my personal passion revolves around integrative wellness and nutrition, which I actively combine with career coaching.\n\nI am so excited and proud to be part of the Paylocity culture. This is a culture dedicated to its people and delivering the best customer experience to our customers. I love being part of a culture that fosters collaboration, where diverse perspectives help us create innovative solutions and collective success.\n\nAs Chief Accounting Officer & Treasurer, I lead our accounting, tax, financial reporting and treasury teams. Prior to Paylocity, I held various financial leadership roles for an automotive supplier and was a senior manager at PwC serving global Fortune 500 companies.\n\nI love the challenge that Paylocity’s growth provides in building scalable processes and through a steady stream of opportunities for our team members.\n\nAs a native Michigander, I earned my Bachelor’s in Business Administration degree in Accounting Information Systems from Central Michigan University and am also a Certified Public Accountant. In my free time, you can either find me on the tennis court or perfecting a new gourmet dish, with my wife and daughter as tough judges.\n\n\"What attracted me about Paylocity was how the company and leadership team “lives the reputation” in caring deeply about building and maintaining an outstanding culture.\"\n\nWhen I joined Paylocity in 2013 as Vice President of Human Resources, we were expanding into new spaces I had the privilege of helping to design. We started with floor plans and workspaces for our new corporate headquarters in Schaumburg, IL, and then moved on to our new offices in Lake Mary, FL, and Meridian, ID. In 2018, I transitioned to Vice President of Real Estate and Procurement.\n\nMy 25-year career as an HR executive has included wide-ranging experience, working alongside other executives to align HR and business strategies. I’ve developed services, leadership, and operations capabilities for global business services, operations, call centers, and information technology business units.\n\nIn addition to my time in HR, I also have expertise in business management, large-scale project and program management, and steering all aspects of mergers and acquisitions integrations. I hold a Master of Science in Organizational Development and a Bachelor of Science in Human Resources from Northeastern Illinois University.\n\n“It is an honor to work for Paylocity, an organization that truly values its employees, and puts its best foot forward each day for them.”\n\nI joined Paylocity in January of 2019 as the Regional Vice President of Sales for the East, leading that team to top performance the following year. I’m proud that those markets continue to see quality expansion and continued success that has opened many doors for others to advance their careers. Today, as Vice President of Sales, I oversee our entire Major Markets Sales organization and our Channel Success team, working closely with nearly every functional area to support our go-to-market efforts and long-term growth strategy. We’re focused on delivering great support and experiences for our employees, prospects, clients, and partners. I strongly believe that engaged and motivated employees deliver exceptional levels of service to our clients, along with tremendous results that typically exceed our business objectives.\n\nI’ve had the pleasure of working at a few world-class organizations in my professional life and lean on that diverse experience each and every day. My childhood upbringing as an “Army brat” also taught me how to adapt to new surroundings, foreign cultures, and different types of individuals at a very rapid pace. As a kid, I attended nine different schools during my K-12 years, but eventually found my home in Athens, GA. I attended the University of Georgia and graduated from the Terry College of Business. When I’m not doing what I love at Paylocity, you can find me cheering on my two daughters, Audrey and Abigail, at an Atlanta-area tennis court, or on Lake Lanier enjoying a peaceful sunset with my wife, Irma.\n\n“I wake up every day focused on how to help my broader team capitalize on the opportunity that Paylocity affords them. Building a fun work environment, centered around our people being equipped with great tools to share the Paylocity story, is at the core of what we do. Dynamic leaders with motivated teams deliver great results. Therefore we’ll remain focused on keeping Paylocity the premier destination for employees and clients alike, and the rest will take care of itself.”\n\nDelivering exceptional, modern workforce experiences for our customers is at the heart of everything we do. But it's not just about what we do; it's how we do it that drew me to Paylocity through our cultural pillars, including \"live the reputation\" and \"earn it every day.\" As the head of our sales strategy, operations, and enablement organization, I'm hyper-focused on driving sales excellence, evolving our strategy, and empowering our team with the tools and resources to drive predictable revenue growth and productivity. Every day is an opportunity to improve the lives and experiences of our employees, customers, prospects, and partners with an EQ and innovation-led approach. I'm passionate about leveraging the latest in AI and natural language processing and am a vocal champion for diversity, equity inclusion, and accessibility.\n\nBefore joining Paylocity, I spent over 23 years driving sales, service, marketing, and strategy excellence across SaaS and B2B industries at organizations such as Qualtrics, Aon, Allianz, and Zurich. I'm a proud University of Richmond Spider and earned my MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband, Robert, and two teenage children, Clayton and Maggie. I have a passion for experiencing other cultures and have had the great privilege of living and working in Munich, Germany, for three years. In addition to travel, I enjoy cooking and working on my golf game.\n\nWhat we do, we do right and with integrity. Everything we do is rooted in our shared values. They are our North Star, our guiding light. They drive how we make decisions, treat each other, and define success.\n\nAs Vice President and Head of Engineering, I am responsible for bringing our product vision to life. This involves a very close partnership with our product management, data, infrastructure, sales, and operations teams. Driving customer value through continuous product improvements and high-quality releases is our mission.\n\nBefore joining Paylocity, I led several high-growth, multi-region teams focusing on high-scale cloud-based solutions for video streaming, higher education, supply chain, digital preservation, transportation logistics, air traffic control, and a few cool projects for the government I am still not allowed to talk about.\n\nI earned my master’s degree in computer science at Johns Hopkins University and have undergraduate degrees in computer science, marketing, and finance from Towson University. In my spare time, you will find me going on a run, taking photographs, trying a new restaurant, or learning how to make new cocktails.\n\nThe thing I enjoy most about Paylocity is the overall passion to continually look for ways to simplify our customers’ lives at all levels of the organization. From the C-Suite to the HR department to the employees, there is no end in sight to what we will be able to accomplish together."
