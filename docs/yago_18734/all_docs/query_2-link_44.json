        "text": "Thomas Miller, 66, of Equinunk, PA, passed away Thursday, Dec. 23, 2021, at Wayne Memorial Hospital. He was born May 24,1955, in Danbury, CT, a son of the late Clearance Ralph and Helen Virginia (Ziegler) Miller. In addition to his parents, he was also preceded in death by his brother, Philip Miller. He is survived by his loving wife Cherry Lyn (Flores) Miller; and siblings Pamela (Miller) Evanuska, Paula L. Miller, Kevin Miller, Kenneth Miller SR, Robert Miller SR, Roy C. Miller SR, and Lisa (Miller) Placella.\n\nThomas graduated from Henry Abbott Tech Highschool in Danbury, CT, and was a “Jack of all trades”, from restoring old cars to running and fixing equipment. What he enjoyed the most was welding and being a business owner. When he was not involved in that, he was lending a helping hand or educating the “younger generation” with his wealth of knowledge, if they were willing to learn. He enjoyed his time with the family, and especially the afternoon naps with his great-grandchildren.\n\nThomas was a loving father to his children, Richard Auriel Flores, of Equinunk, PA, Debi (Miller) Firmstone and husband, Jason, of Honesdale, PA, and Cathi Miller of Honesdale, PA; grandfather to Caitlin and Brett Firmstone of Honesdale, PA, Jonathan Miller and fiancé Jennifer Duley of Damascus, PA, Jodi Calvert and fiancé, Daniel Fenkner of Equinunk, PA; and attentive great-grandfather to Austin, Skylar, Oliver, Elianna, Adalyn, Isabella, Shannon, Logan, Elizabeth, Adrianna, Cameron, and Tyler. Several Cousins, Nieces and Nephews.\n\nPlease join us as we share your memories and we share ours at the Celebration of Life, at his resident in Equinunk, PA. Saturday, January 8th, 2022, from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.\n\nWe are planning for a beautiful day, with laughter and tears, as our most loving Dad, Grandfather, Great grandfather, and friend joins so many others in heaven, for there is no greater place. Please plan to stay a while, dine with us and be merry, or maybe just pass through and leave a kind word. Tom has left a forever footprint on so many hearts, and would like us to remember the good times, as we dry our tears. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in Thomas’s memory to the Equinunk Volunteer Fire Company."
