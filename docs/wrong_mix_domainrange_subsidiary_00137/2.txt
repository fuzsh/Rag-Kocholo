5 reasons to DUST YOURSELF OFF TODAY 👇 👇 👇 If you say that someone has dusted himself or herself off or dusted himself or herself down, you mean that they have managed to recover from a severe problem which has affected their life. This guy fell over on the way to the stage - ouch! Did he sit and cry at the embarrassment ? No, he 'dusted himself off' and made the best of it. Here are 5 great reasons for you to DUST YOURSELF OFF TODAY : 🍒 TAKE CONTROL There is a Japanese proverb that says, “fall seven times, stand up eight”. As hard as it can be to rally yourself when you feel as though you’ve failed, it’s important to remember that your failures don’t define you. Those seven times you’ve fallen are not what makes up your character--it’s the fact that you stood up again that makes you who you are. LIKE THE MAN IN THE VIDEO ❤️❤️❤️ 🍒 BE GRATEFUL It can be really difficult to remember just how good you really have it. If you’re reading this, you likely have access to resources and tools that much of the world does not. This doesn’t mean that your suffering is meaningless or silly, just that you already have a lot to be thankful for. Try to look at the big picture of your world and not just the failure you are focusing on - over all I bet you have it good and you need to remember that 🔥 🔥 🔥 🍒 THE POWER OF NOW Read this book by Ekhart Tolle. He teaches that feeling terrible is due to regretting the past or fearing the future. If you focus on what you are doing right now, those things are impossible. So, read the book and stick to the here and now and you will understand it's power 🌈🌈🌈 🍒 FLIP YOUR VIEW Albert Einstein said that, “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Maybe you’ve failed at something because you’re a fish trying to climb a tree. Maybe you’ve failed for a greater purpose, or maybe this failure is showing you where you need to change. Look at it differently and maybe failure is actually what you need, what is right, what will ultimately make you 🚀🚀🚀 🍒 ACCEPT IT Sometimes you fail, sometimes you don't get what you want, sometimes it's not all roses - true? Once you accept that you cannot have the ups without the downs, you realise that, "this too shall pass". When bad stuff happens to me, I like to 'lick my wounds' for a while and then, like the brilliant footballer, Harry Kane, I 'GO AGAIN'. Do this too - YES, YOU 🙏 🙏 🙏 Wow, I have given my all to this little piece on 'dusting yourself off'. I hope that I have not failed in my goal to help one person 😀 😀 😀 Have a blessed day and help someone today too !!! 🍒 Peace 🙏 and Love ❤️x #love #help #change #grateful #inpspiration #motivation #Caboom 🚀🚀🚀

Life. One moment you’re in your small room in Ikorodu struggling with hunger pangs and wondering if you’ll make it through the day. 2 years down the line you’re speaking at Oxford University and sharing your ideas in a room with some of the most brilliant minds in the world. It is said that there are decades when nothing happens and weeks when decades happen. In the stillness of those decades when nothing happens, learn,unlearn and build immense capacity. So when your decades in a week happens, you will be ready for it. One day the spotlight will find you, and you’ll get a chance to prove your mettle and show the world what you’re truly made of. Until then,never lose sight of who you are and the light you carry within, for it is this light that will illuminate your path and guide you when your moment in the spotlight arrives. Keep going Dreamer. I hope you never stop giving the world something new to believe in.

I’m 25 with 2 businesses and no home. All of this ‘happened’ in the last year. But it certainly wasn’t overnight. Here’s how I got here: Age 0-15: Raised by an incredible single mother who wore both hats. Gave everything to support me. Age 16: First job stacking shelves at Booths (a supermarket). Completed high school with bang-average grades. Started sixth form college. Age 17: Quit sixth form college after 3 months due to illness. Doctor said I was 24 hours away from dying of Septicemia. Spent my 17th birthday in hospital. Then became an apprentice at a print marketing agency. Learnt my way around Adobe’s design suite. Started doing bits of design work on the side with clients from outreach. Age 18-19: Discovered search marketing to help get more clients for the print marketing agency. Became obsessed with SEO. Spent most of my free time messing around with websites I built. Age 20: Wanted to take marketing more seriously. Quit my job to start a marketing degree. Quit after 2 weeks. Started an apprenticeship for an SEO agency where I managed 25 clients. This was alongside college I started 6 months later. Quit after 3 months. Realised traditional education systems suck. I learnt 100x more (and quicker) through self-education. Went all-in on learning and building whilst living at home with my mother and 2 young siblings. £0 income. Age 21: Got my first 2 freelancing clients on Upwork. They referred me to other clients. Hit £10K/mo by the end of the year. Age 22-23: Started a podcast side project and quickly reached 300K listeners per month. Sold it for 5 figures. Bought and sold 5 websites. Maxed out freelancing service at £15K/mo. Age 24: Founded Content Growth and built a team to help companies turn their blog into a 6 figure sales channel. Started posting on LinkedIn and increased revenue by 166% in 5 months. Age 25: Co-founded Byword; software that generates articles at scale for SEO. Sold everything and moved to Medellin, Colombia. Scaling both companies to 7 figures in ARR. Closing in on 100K total audience. I don’t think my journey is at all special. But there are some key themes: - Continuously learning and testing - Knowing when to quit and taking risks - Always improving relationships and networking My goal is to continue levelling up, exploring, meeting incredible people, achieving more freedom, and helping family and friends along the way. Because I believe that's why we're on this planet. What say you?
