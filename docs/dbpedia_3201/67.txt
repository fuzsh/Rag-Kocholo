Saiyuki is a manga series written by Kazuya Minekura and based on the Chinese tale, Journey to the West. It is a well-loved story of four men who face countless hardships, and survive only through unbreakable bonds they share with one another.

Yet several chapters of the story remain inaccessible to the English-speaking audience. This is a request that an English Publishing House please take up Saiyuki Gaiden (complete at 4 vol.) and Saiyuki Ibun (ongoing at 1 vol.), The Anthology (complete at 1 vol.), and the sequel, Saiyuki Reload Blast (ongoing at 3 vol.)

We the fans would be very grateful, and very enthusiastic.
