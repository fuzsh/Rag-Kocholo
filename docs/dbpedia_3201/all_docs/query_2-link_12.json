        "text": "Characters\n\nReviews\n\nTo me, Minekura-sama is a god. Her work is beautifully drawn, with deep, intricately real characters, strong page-turning storylines and laugh-out-loud one-liners. A recipe for perfection if ever I saw one. And Saiyuki may well be her best manga so far.\n\nStory: Intense, fast-paced and moving. High-tension battle scenes are perfectly balanced with calm character-interaction moments, and every now and then there's a flashback. Now Minekura-sama can't take full credit for the story, as it's based (quite closely, apparently) on the Chinese &quot;Xiyouji&quot; legend, so it's not like she came up with it. However, since my favourite arc is the &quot;Be There&quot; arc, which is fully ... Minekura-sama's invention, I think I can award her high marks here ^^\n\nArt: Ah, the art. You only need to look at the cover of volume one to know that you're dealing with an exceptional artist. The only reason I gave it a 9 rather than a 10 for art is that it takes Minekura-sama a while to get into her stride. In the first volume, the art is - well - kind of rubbish. But DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY IT!!! By the time you hit volume 4, all the &quot;Oh gods, what's with his bendy neck?&quot; moments are gone, and by the end of volume 9 it's as though you're looking at a different manga. Each frame is worthy of a front cover. Magnificent ^^ Just stick with it!\n\nCharacter: The cast of characters in Saiyuki are some of the most loveable characters I've ever come across. A gun-toting priest, a food-obsessed monkey, a lecherous half-demon and a kind human-turned-youkai. Each of them has a dark tragedy in their past that makes them who they are, and so each character has several layers to their personality, making them extremely believeable and real. Luckily, though, Minekura-sama decided not to make Hakkai a pig, as in the original Xiyouji legend xD He is faar improved as a gorgeous bishonen ^^\n\n[sorry, I keep using ^^, it's a bit of a habit xD moving on!]\n\nEnjoyment: The most enjoyable series I have had the pleasure to read. As I said, the art is wonderful (once you get past the first few volumes), the story is thrilling and the characters are loveable. A better bunch of bishonen you couldn't find anywhere. And it's the brilliant one-liners that make you scream with laughter (well, maybe that's just me xD). Oh and the translators deserve a mention: the Nibley sisters (?) have done the best translating job I've ever seen! And, of course, there's the shonen-ai. Now for those who are uncomfortable with shonen-ai, don't worry - there is nothing explicit, it is all just little phrases and glances that *can* be interpreted in that way, but you can read the entire series just thinking they're all just good friends. Me, I love shonen-ai, and seeing all the subtext just made the series stick in my mind that much more, and is one of the reasons I keep going back to re-read and re-read.\n\nOverall: Fantastic! Amazing! Superb! Unrivalled! I honestly can't recommend this series highly enough. Whether you're interested in comedy, drama, character analysis, beautiful art, shonen-ai, comeraderie, action; it's all here! Saiyuki is the full and ultimate manga package and anyone and everyone should at least give it a try. Go and read it now!! Right now!!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nSaiyuki is a slow to start series. As I started, I was a little confused as to what the hell was going on, thinking that I'd missed something. Too much was happening with no proper character introductions, and no real story.\n\nThe story gets better as you go though. By the start of the second volume, I had regained my ground. I knew who the characters were and what they were doing.\n\nUnfortunately Saiyuki's story isn't up to scratch. It isn 't a bad story, it just doesn't go anywhere. By the end of it, realising that it hadn't been completed and that there was an entire ... series. Saiyuki Reload follows it. The problem is that the story wasn't enticing enough for me to even bother with the next series. I was just a little annoyed that I thought I was getting to the end of the series and in the end there was little to no plot development, with the characters basically ending up back where they were at the start.\n\nThe characters in the series are interesting but highly cliched. The second I saw them, I could guess practically everything about them. And generally, I was correct. They are see-through and unbelievable. The only redeeming parts are the stories of Hakkai and Gojyo, who have deep and interesting backstories.\n\nWhile the story and characters aren't amazing, the artwork is incredibly well done.The artstyle is a little hard to get used to, but once you have, it is the best thing about the series.\n\nOverall, the series is interesting, but not really worth your time. If you've really got nothing better to read, give it a go. It's not bad, but there are much better series out there.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nJust a shitty yaoi manga with a poor excuse of a storyline. Incest is involved too, so it appeals to a lot of people, heh. Shallow yaoi faingirls who are into the typical pretty boys, drama, scandal and incest will eat this up. The action sequences are so crap. I had no idea what they were doing. And the \"powers\" and \"abilities\" are so mediocre but the characters act like they're super awesome. For people looking for a good series, this is not for you. Turn back and stay well away from this pathetic excuse of a manga. Wish I could give it a zero ... overall. Need I really say more?\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for January\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for January Week 1: January 5 - 11 Anime Releases Black Bullet Blu-ray [2021 re-release] Conception Blu-ray [E...read more\n\nJan 5, 2021 2:08 PM by ImperfectBlue | Discuss (8 comments)\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for November\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for November Week 1: November 3 - 9 Anime Releases Actors: Songs Connection Complete Collection Blu-ray Dragon...read more\n\nNov 2, 2020 6:44 PM by ImperfectBlue | Discuss (1 comment)\n\nRecent Forum Discussion\n\nPoll: Saiyuki Chapter 55 Discussion\n\nLunar191 - Oct 31, 2012 2 repliesby TitanInsane »»\n\nOct 7, 2021 2:45 AM Raws\n\npionelya - Mar 8, 2021 0 repliesby pionelya »»\n\nMar 8, 2021 11:28 PM Poll: Saiyuuki Chapter 37 Discussion\n\ntheshinsengumi - Sep 10, 2017 0 repliesby theshinsengumi »»\n\nSep 10, 2017 8:30 AM Poll: Saiyuki Chapter 3 Discussion\n\nDecadent - Apr 21, 2011 0 repliesby Decadent »»\n\nApr 21, 2011 2:41 AM Poll: Saiyuki Chapter 42 Discussion\n\nNaivette - Feb 25, 2011 0 repliesby Naivette »»\n\nFeb 25, 2011 6:55 PM\n\nRecent Featured Articles\n\nOur Picks for the 5 Best Shows (So Far) this Summer 2017 Season\n\nHave you been enjoying the anime shows this summer?
