In a time when Death was unknown, a boy was brought into Heaven and entrusted to the care of the minor God Konzen Douji. Named Goku, the boy soon became the best of friends with gods Tenpou and Kenren of the Army of Heaven, and the War Prince Nataku. Yet even Heaven has it's devils, and when a plot to seize the throne of Heaven leaves Nataku dead, Goku loses control of his powers, causing a massacre, while Konzen, Tenpou and Kenren find themselves accused as heretics for attempting to defend their friend. Now their only hope is to break through the ranks of the Army of Heaven and escape to the lower world. The origins of the heroes of the classic anime series Saiyuki are unveiled in an epic, expanded series of original animation videos in Saiyuki Gaiden!Less"
