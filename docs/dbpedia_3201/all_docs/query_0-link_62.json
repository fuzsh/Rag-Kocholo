        "text": "Title: Saiyuki\n\nAlt name(s): Saiyuuki, Gensomaden Saiyuki\n\nAuthor: MINEKURA Kazuya\n\nDemographic: Shounen\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy\n\nVolumes: 9\n\n♡ I wasn’t familiar with Journey to the West when I came across this series. I saw that one of the characters was called Son Goku, and I was a big Dragon Ball fan, so I read it ^^; I fell in love with Minekura’s art style, the way she draws her men *dreamy sigh*. I was obsessed with Sanzo, he’s still rated way up there in my favourite characters. Story-wise I don’t remember much. I hope this series holds up. I’m still waiting for it to finish…\n\nFour Hot Dudes Go West\n\nA mysterious malevolent energy is driving the Yokai (demons) insane. Humans are living in fear, and on top of that someone is trying to resurrect the great demon king Gyuu Maou.\n\nSurly but beautiful Buddhist priest Genjyo Sanzo is assigned with the task of heading West to stop the resurrection from occurring. With him are his posse – staff welding monkey boy Son Goku, definitely not a pig Cho Hakkai, and womanizer half-yokai Sha Gojyo.\n\nTogether they journey across the land in their dragon/jeep, meeting many friend and foe.\n\nDid I mention they’re attractive?\n\nI’m sitting here with a thesaurus open on ‘beautiful’ because I’m going to run out of words for how appealing I find Minekura’s artstyle. You might start the series and be like ‘girl’s got weird taste’ but let me show you how the style evolves.\n\nOn many occasions I found myself staring at each panel admiring the line work. Everyone is drawn with such splendor. Minekura has mastered the art of drawing a face let me tell you. I do need more than just pretty faces to get me through a series though, otherwise I would have liked Doubt!! (I didn’t, read about it here).\n\nIt’s a good thing then, that Saiyuki is more than just its looks.\n\nThe world premise is compelling – a mix of old and new, where magic and science co-exist. Our heroes ride around in a dragon turned Jeep Wrangler, drink Asahi and smoke Marlboros. Hakkai manipulates his chi to form barriers and heal the team, whilst our Priest opts for a pistol, it’s gorgeous.\n\nOur characters, on a surface level are tropes; the hungry one, the ladies man, the kind one, the irritable one. But as we get a glimpse into their pasts, we see they are also complex, flawed and oh so very broken. No’one in Saiyuki has had an easy life. Even minor characters we are introduced to have their own backstories and agendas, and I look forward to seeing how they will intertwine with the gang.\n\nAs for the source material, the extent of my knowledge is a wiki page, so I can’t really comment on how authentic Saiyuki is. To me, it looks like a loose interpretation that uses the characters. And even then Hakkai and Gojyo seem to have had a personality transplant. As with both works, Sanzo’s party are headed West and it’s going to take a long time (four more manga serializations in fact, yay!).\n\nSounds like you still liked it?"
