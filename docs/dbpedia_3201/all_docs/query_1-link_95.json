For the title alone, I should be shot.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nKonzen was getting used to coming back to his office and finding it a mess. Goku was a one monkey typhoon, capable of causing chaos while simply sitting down. So it was no surprise when Konzen stepped inside his office, and promptly tripped. It was no surprise at all.\n\nThat didn’t mean he liked it.\n\n“Stupid monkey! What is all this?”\n\nGoku looked up. “Books. Ten-chan gave me books. I’m learning from them.” He said the last part with a proud smile.\n\nKonzen told himself he wasn’t going to ask what Goku was learning. He didn’t care. He wasn’t going to ask.\n\n“Just what are you learning, Monkey?”\n\nDamn it.\n\n“Lots of things,” Goku replied. “Like plants, and which ones are tasty and which ones aren’t; and how to make things, like meat buns and sweet things; and—“\n\n“Are you bothering with anything that doesn’t involve food?” Konzen asked caustically.\n\nGoku pondered this for moment. (If he actually could do things like ponder, which Konzen doubted sometimes.) Finally he beamed. “Yeah, I learned something else.”\n\nBefore Konzen could ask what this something was, Goku had leapt up, wrapped his arms around Konzen, and was kissing him enthusiastically.\n\nKonzen’s eyes nearly popped out of his head, and he pushed Goku away, sputtering. “Which one of Tenpou’s books did you learn that from?!”\n\nGoku grinned. “Oh, it wasn’t a book Ten-chan gave me. Ken-niichan gave it to me. He said you would like it.”\n\nKonzen tried to remain calm; he tried to keep his temper.\n\nHe failed.\n\n“KENREN!!”\n\nThe shout was so loud that Kenren managed to hear it while relaxing in his very, very safe hiding place. He chuckled and raised his cup of sake. “One day you’ll thank me,” he said confidently.\n\nUntil then, Kenren figured he’d hide here.\n\nLove Stories:konzen/goku, saiyuki\n\nIn the Mood:deeply ashamed"
