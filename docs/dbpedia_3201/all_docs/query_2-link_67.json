        "text": "Fiery Heart (Saiyuki One-Shot. Yaoi!)\n\nRen and Sanzo have known each other since they were found by Koumyou Sanzo. They were best friends. Soon Ren leaves and Kouryuu becomes Genjo Sanzo. Once they find each other again, their connection goes to a new level.\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nCho Hakkai x Reader Lemon *Completed*\n\nLike it says at the top. If you don't like sexual content, or are faint-hearted, Do Not Read!\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nSaiyuki Oneshots\n\nOneshots. Quite a few of these are exceptionally old. Over all I'm happy with the results though. It's mostly all fluff though. Enjoy my little ducklings!\n\nSaiyuki One-Shots\n\nThis story will feature one-shots based on the anime and manga called Saiyuki. I might not update this one for long periods of time though, just as a warning. I don't write a lot of Saiyuki stuff :) there will be reader-inserts and OC inserts alike.\n\nYears Later\n\nThree years after their mission, they have started to live a normal life. They continued to grow up together, points of views have changed, some have remained and they are set to discover more as their lives go on.\n\nMature"
