        "text": "Note: This is a sequel to my Saiyuki: Gaiden story in Anime Story's Unleashed.\n\nI do realize that I am taking some things from the anime, and changing them a bit, or I may forget some things. Please bare with me though. I will do my best to stay in character., but I will be inserting some of my own creativity.\n\nNevaeh Kijin was once one of the greatest Goddesses in Heaven - hence her name being \"heaven' spelled backwards. A brilliant woman, skilled in the element of light, she was in charge of teaching new elemental recruits in Heaven what their roles would be. She was content with brushing off the feeling that Heaven wasn't all it was said to be.\n\nUntil, a certain young heretic boy shook the world she knew up.\n\nA little boy named Goku.\n\nNevaeh's every moment after forming a friendship that would eventually bloom into a deeper motherly love was spent wondering why she hadn't seen the lies sooner, why she had chosen to accept her fate, and why she never tried to care for anyone other than herself.\n\nSoon, she became close friends with three other men, and for a few weeks, everything went smoothly. Nevaeh started to believe that Heaven may not be so bad if you had the right people around.\n\nThat opinion was crushed when a man named Li Touten threatened her to stay away from Goku.\n\nThe four males and Nevaeh fled for the Lower World, with high hopes that life would be better there. They wanted to feel more, and see the Cherry blossoms die and re-bloom, to experience was the humans did, and to love with a deeper and desperate force.\n\nThey wanted to be free.\n\nBut, unfortunately.. Their dreams did not come true. Nevaeh was dragged away after sharing a first kiss that was meant to be one of many with Konzen Douji, volunteering to protect them as they continued to the Dimensional Gate. Her plan was to meet them there, until, weakened, she was manipulated by a past student and brought to the safety of the Merciful Goddess's palace.\n\nWhen she had woken, she learned that her two friends Tenpou and Kenren had been killed. Begging to go finish the quest with the two she considered her family, she convinced those taking care of her to let her go, then ran to catch up - only to see her beloved Konzen being crushed to death by the Dimensional Gate's doors.\n\nAfter she had finally his presence completely ebb away, did she get up and decide, with tears streaming down her face, that she would one day go to Earth to make their dearest wish come true.\n\nSo, after pleading with the Merciful Goddess for days, she was granted her wish of going to the Lower World. In payment, she was stripped of all of the titles she had earned, and was put in charge of watching over Goku for 480 years. As well as rebuilding all the damages that Heaven had sustained by the rebellion.\n\n480 years later, the Merciful Goddess woke a disheveled and worn Nevaeh from another restless sleep, and before anyone could say anything - Erased her memories of everything that the Goddess had been through, and even the reason why she wanted to go to the Lower World in the first place.\n\nAlso taking half of her powers, the Merciful Goddess turned her into a baby. She named the little girl, Nevaeh in remembrance of the beautiful, but shattered Goddess - then placed her in a small village in the Lower World, uttering the words..\n\n\"You're going to have a rough life here, you better not let all that waiting be in vain and die before you meet your friends again.\" then vanishing, leaving the baby Nevaeh to whatever troubles and pleasures may come her way.\n\nThat is only the beginning though.\n\nNevaeh Kijin got her second chance, and one particularly sunny but cold day, she met a young boy and his master underneath the bare cherry blossom trees.\n\nThis is her story of pain, memories, forgiveness, family and love."
