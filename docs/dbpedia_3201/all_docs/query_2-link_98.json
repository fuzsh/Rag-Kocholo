It features all variations within the pairing as well as all ratings. HIGHLY recommended.\n\nTarnished Gold - The FanFiction.net C2 community devoted to them. It is a selective archive, and per regulations of FanFiction.net only features stories up to the R level.\n\nIndividual Stories\n\n( Note: I did my best away from stories containing explicit sexual content, but there are two stories below that I believe are an exception to this rule due to how Sanzo and Goku are portrayed in the stories. This, by no means, does not mean that smut for Sanzo and Goku hasn't been done well and in character, but the two stories containing it below showcase their feelings in how I was trying to address them in this essay.\n\nAlso, there are two stories below that are my own. I believe that showing how I personally write Sanzo and Goku together would help explain some of the finer points of my essay. )\n\nAwakenings by stitcher2ficcer\n\nAmid sleepless nights and trying days, Goku comes of age and throws the relationships of the Sanzo-ikkou into chaos. PG-13\n\n(Also Test of Rain, R)\n\nBashert by Iapetus\n\nThere is no greater peace than finally being with the one you love - and realizing that they love you back. And while physical touch is nice, it's the emotion behind it that means so much more. PG-13\n\nFade to Black by D-chan\n\nAfter Gyumaoh's defeat Sanzo finds himself plagued by dreams and nightmares even more than he realizes. PG-13\n\n(Also Breathe Again, R)\n\nGood Enough by iamzuul\n\nSanzo's in the bath, and he's not washing up. NC-17 WARNING.\n\nLast Christmas by Iapetus\n\nAU. Sometimes what a person really wants for Christmas is not theirs to ask for. NC-17 WARNING.\n\nRebellion by D-chan\n\nBecause Sanzo wasn't ready for Goku to grow up. PG-13\n\nSoliloquium by Pervasive Threnody\n\nThere is nothing inherently remarkable about the sight of Sanzo at his morning repast; Goku has seen it umpteen times already, since being brought to this place. But today, he watches with new eyes. G\n\nThe Honeymoon by Hth\n\nDeep down, Sanzo has a heart. We're reasonably sure. R\n\nTicklish by Diva Urd\n\nGoku's thoughts during a certain procedure in Reload Ep. 20... involving a paintbrush. No real spoilers for the end of Reload. PG-13\n\nUndone by Neko-chan -Silvered Tongue-\n\nSanzo refuses to admit any type of weakness--and Goku tells him that it's okay to admit a weakness sometimes. PG\n\nWinter of Our Discontent by Hallucination\n\nSanzo struggles to accept the presence of others in his life, and the changes that they bring. PG\n\n::Fin::"
