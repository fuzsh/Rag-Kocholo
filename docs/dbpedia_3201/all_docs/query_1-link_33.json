        "text": "Hi! I used to watch Saiyuki when I was young and ever since then Goku has been my all time bae (still is!) next to Naruto. I was thinking of rewatching this anime soon, but I have never read the mangas and the series have not reach its end yet right? So I am quite confuse on whats happening now. Should I read the manga for the clear picture or...? And the series, I know Gensomaden Saiyuki is the first one, then what goes after? It will be so nice if you could help me. Thanks\n\nHello there ♥\n\nThere’s several different animes for Saiyuki\n\n2000 - 2001 - Gensomaden Saiyuki\n\n2003 - 2004 - Saiyuki Reload/Reload Gunlock\n\nThere’s also quite a few movies and OVAs.\n\nI’d highly recommend reading the manga! The animes have their own charm but are full of fillers and sometimes skew the original manga plot (the biggest culprit being Hazel’s arc in Gunlock!!)\n\nSaiyuki itself has many series as well and it may be a bit confusing at first.\n\nLet’s go in reading order based on my own personal preference:\n\n1) Saiyuki - This is the first series. Basically we get intros of our main dudes and back stories. We get some world building as well and are introduced to our main antagonists. The first series is 9 volumes long.\n\n2) Saiyuki Gaiden or Saiyuki Reload -\n\nThis is a toss up. Saiyuki Gaiden is actually a prequel of our main hero’s lives. There are a lot of hints in Saiyuki about Goku’s past and it’s revealed in Gaiden. It starts off pretty light hearted, but it turns very tragic very quickly. While you don’t have to read Gaiden until later, it’s essential in Goku’s character and why he ended up in the cave at the beginning of Saiyuki. It’s very bloody, even more so than Saiyuki, by the end. Also note that there’s an art shift throughout Gaiden’s 4 volumes as Minekura worked on it for a few years on and off.\n\nSaiyuki Reload is the direct continuation of the story, not a sequel. The journey continues on and we have more character development in this series. If you like Seiten Taisei (True Goku) you will enjoy this series. I wont spoil it for you, but if you only watch the anime you’ll miss out on some very good plot development and one of the cruelest antagonists that shows up near the end of the run. I highly recommend reading Reload, I enjoyed it even more than Saiyuki.\n\nAgain, Reload and Gaiden can be flipped, but Gaiden IS important. At some point it may benefit you to read it before BLAST because it’s been mentioned that the two will tie in together.\n\nSaiyuki Reload BLAST - The direct continuation of Reload and the last installment of the series (Minekura stated). It’s currently on hiatus due to Minekura’s bad luck with her health. Chapters come sporadically so be sure to keep that in mind. There have been some developments that have already tied events from Gaiden, which is why you’ll want to read it before you start BLAST.\n\nSaiyuki Ibun - A prequel of Saiyuki. Focuses on Sanzo’s master and his companions who are trying to become Sanzo priests. Currently on hiatus.\n\nSaiyuki Dice of Destiny - Taken from the site: While recovering from surgery, Minekura Kazuya is asked by the Zero-Sum editor-in-chief Koyagi to create a series of illustrations for the manga magazine Zero-Sum Ward. To create a theme, Koyagi rolls four dice: two hold character names, one holds a situation, and the last holds an action. With each roll, characters are placed in strange situations, much to Minekura's chagrin.\n\nHere’s more info on all the animated adaptions!"
