        "text": "the ending made me cry...\n\nI took the chance to read all the available Saiyuki anthology in Manga Fox. I read the Saiyuki Gaiden.\n\nSaiyuki Gaiden is set 500 years before the actual Saiyuki series. It tells the life of a nameless heretical child who was sent in heaven to be guided by the gods, who was later named Goku. The story focuses on Goku's past life in the upper world together with the incarnates of the Sanzo-ikkou and his newly-found friend Nataku. It also reveals the \"crime\" that Goku made in heaven which resulted for him to be imprisoned for 5 centuries.\n\nIn my opinion, its just a simple story. Goku is portrayed as an innocent child who just wants to play and have fun, which differs from his Saiyuki persona where he has a prankster disposition and loves fighting.\n\nCreator Kazuya Minekura made Goku the cutest and most pure child she could ever imagine. The twists and turns in the story appeared when Goku and his friends were accused of being rebels. They later had the will of escaping to heaven and live on earth for the sake of child.\n\nI knew that its a sad ending but it definitely brought tears in my eyes. Its the first time that I actually cried just because of reading a story. I'm not that emotional but Saiyuki Gaiden tore my heart into pieces. I was already droping tears when the Sanzo-ikkou incarnates are dying one by one and Goku is the only one left.\n\nI felt more pain when I saw this scene:\n\n\"You were the one who reached out to me first. Next time, I promise... I'll be the one to reach for you. I'll definitely reach for you.\"\n\nFor me, the most painful part of the story is when Kanzeon Bosatsu was ordered to use her powers to erase Goku's memories in heaven. Kanzeon Bosatsu tells Goku that his punishment is to be imprisoned for 500 years. She erased all of his memories except his name.\n\n\"I don't know where this is. I don't even know how long I've been here...\"\n\nI felt relieved when Sanzo is shown releasing Goku in prison. Which I think is the fulfillment of Konzen's (Sanzo's incarnate) promise.\n\nRead Saiyuki Gaiden here."
