        "text": "In Saiyuki, especially on merchandise, you might often see numbers and one of four colors associated with our dudes.\n\nFor instance, this purple pouch with the number 3 on it.\n\nIt seems minimalist, there’s no character on it. But it represents Sanzo, our hot headed priest. There’s a couple ways to identify this;\n\nSanzo is represented with purple\n\nGoku is represented with yellow/orange\n\nGojyo is represented with red\n\nHakkai is represented with green\n\nMinekura even did a series of postcards featuring the guys with their respected color awhile back.\n\nAnother popular way to identify the guys is with numbers. Their names are linked to numbers, so we have\n\nSanzo - 3 (San = 3)\n\nGojyo - 5 (Go = 5)\n\nHakkai - 8 (Hachi = 8)\n\nGoku - 9 (Ku = 9)\n\nSo if somebody were to say ‘I enjoy reading 353 fics’, it means they like reading stories with Sanzo and Gojyo.\n\nNot all pairings are fully numbered, for instance 10K is commonly used for Tenpou and Kenren.\n\nOther times pairings are done the old school way, like Kougaiji x Yaone.\n\nSome popular pairings that come up are:\n\n393 - Sanzo and Goku\n\n585 - Gojyo and Hakkai\n\n10K - Tenpou and Kenren\n\nOther well known pairings\n\nUkoku x Koumyou\n\nKougaiji x Yaone\n\nMixtures of the main four in different pairings\n\nThis is not an extensive list, and I have seen many different pairings over the years! Please note, this does not mean stories or art with these numbers/pairings are always sexual in nature. There are many fics that show the characters in domestic relationships sharing in intimate moments without having anything sexual happen.\n\nI also want to ask that everyone be respectful of people’s OTPs and NOTPs. It doesn’t hurt anyone if someone likes a certain ship. This is a fandom and people are allowed to like what they like, or dislike what they dislike. Just be civil and don’t force your ideals in the faces of others, please!"
