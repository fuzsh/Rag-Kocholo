Soupy was a comedic genius. Some people have thought that my \"screen name\", \"White Fang\" came from a Jack London novel, but it actually came directly from the Soupy Sales Show. \"White Fang\" was Soupy's rather large, pie throwing dog.\n\nUnfortunately, Soupy's TV popularity reached its peak in the 60's, although his show was resurrected briefly as \"The New Soupy Sales Show\" in 1979, but didn't last very long. A few of his show's episodes are available on VHS & DVD...\n\nSoupy's Biography Video\n\nAn Ad for Spy With A Pie (from Billboard Magazine, December 19, 1964)\n\nAn Ad for Soupy's Records (from Billboard Magazine, May 8, 1965)\n\nSoupy with Frank Sinatra - 1965\n\nHere are Soupy's LPs, which were released in the early 60's:\n\nThis album was released in 1981 - Soupy autographed it for me...\n\nThis limited edition compilation CD was released by Rhino in 2000\n\nThis CD is a Korean import. Perhaps a bootleg/pirate - but it has perfect sound quality\n\nHere's a 2002 CD release of \"Do The Mouse\"\n\nA Rare 45\n\nSome Books:\n\nThese are written by Soupy...\n\nSheet Music for \"The Mouse\"\n\nApril 1965 Program for the Paramount Theater Show\n\n1966 Playbill for \"Come Live With Me\"\n\nMy On-Line Namesake - \"White Fang\"\n\n\"Black Tooth\"\n\nSoupy Sales Lunch Box\n\nA Soupy Sales Marionette\n\nA Hand Puppet\n\nA Small Doll\n\nAnd... A card game\n\nSome of Soupy's \"word's of wisdom\"\n\nSoupy Sales Trading Cards\n\nLobby Cards from Soupy's Movie, \"Birds Do It\"\n\nPress Book for \"Birds Do It\"\n\nAll About Soupy Sales - 1965\n\nTeen Life Magazine - September, 1965 (Fold Out Cover)\n\nTeen Stars Yearbook - 1965\n\nSoupy Sales - New York News - July 25, 1965\n\nSoupy's Comic Book\n\nSoupy Sales Magazine - First Issue\n\nSoupy Sales Magazine\n\nStop Magazine - Summer 1983\n\nA Promotional Poster for \"Still Soupy...\"\n\nMiscellaneous Promotional Photos\n\n1979 Promotional Can Of Soup\n\nA Ticket From One Of Soupy's Performances\n\nBack"
