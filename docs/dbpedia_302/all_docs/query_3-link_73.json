        "meta_description": "\"One of London's most interesting and ambitious works\"-Robert Greenwood White Fang is an allegorical adventure story about a part wolf, part dog who is born in the violent, harsh environment of the Canadian Yukon territory. The novel begins with two men attempting to bring a corpse back to civilization as they are followed by a pack of starving wolves. The novel, in its second act, switches to the perspective of the wolves. As a pup, White Fang endures battles of survival with his mother, One-Eye, against other wolves and a lynx. When One-Eye is in the close vicinity to a Native Indian village, she is recognized as an animal who had been part of the encampment at one point. Grey Beaver, a young hunter, adopts White Fang. The other dogs and pups resent the new addition to the village, and torment White Fang, who in turn becomes contentious. He is sold to a dog fighter, and into a brutal life of violence. He is eventually rescued and brought to California, to start a very different life in the care of a loving master and his family. Although White Fang has become a very popular classic among readers, as an allegorical novel it is of great interest to sophisticated readers. The book has been adapted into many film versions, TV series, and animations. With an eye-catching new cover, and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of White Fang is both modern and readable. Since our inception in 2020, Mint Editions has kept sustainability and innovation at the forefront of our mission. Each and every Mint Edition title gets a fresh, professionally typeset manuscript and a dazzling new cover, all while maintaining the integrity of the original book.
