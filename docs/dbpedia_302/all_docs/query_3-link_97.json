        "text": "A clip from an upcoming animated version of Jack London’s classic 1906 novel White Fang was screened on Sunday at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is expected to be released later this year.\n\nLondon’s novel is told from the point of view of its titular protagonist, a wolfdog that becomes domesticated and serves his master loyally. Previous adaptations include feature films and an animated television series. The latest movie has been directed by Alexander Espigares, who co-directed the Oscar-winning short film Mr Hubolt in 2013. The film combines motion capture and cell animation. The voice cast includes Rashida Jones and Nick Offerman.\n\nThe clip was screened at Sundance by producer Big Beach, whose titles include Little Miss Sunshine, Chop Shop, Loving and an upcoming animated version of Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid."
