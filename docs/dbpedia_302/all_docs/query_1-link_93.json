        "text": "Minato stated him to have the same level of reputation as the sannin.\n\nThe second data book stated his as having SKILLS that overshadowed the sannin. The sannin were in their prime when both were said. So, did that comment include Hermit mode? Would TWF finish off pain?\n\nhell yeah.\n\nWe have no idea about TWF also we know just minatos statement.According to him TWF is the superior to sannins.Oros white snake or jiraiyas hermit mode is not effect him, i guess.Probably he can take down madara and pain together.. (am i crazy or sometin, anyway at least i wish.)\n\nFirst consider DataBook > anything that a char say (if the manga is older than DB publish)\n\nSo White Fang had skills that even made the Sannin pitful near him, well it means he would have a high chance to kill Pein even without know his secret while knowing Pein's secret = Pein's death, easily.\n\nI doubt that TWF is that that strong, because we don't know how much Minato knew about the Sannin. He probably knew alot about Jiraiya obviously, but did he know about the white snake and Genisis rebirth that Oro and Tsunade have?\n\nAlso the databook is a joke. It says that Kurenia's genjutsu is equal to Itachi's.\n\nBesides Pein beat someone that beat all the Sannin at the same time, so it doesn't really matter.\n\nI never read data book... it says that? Since Pein admitted the closeness of the fight... gotta say WF if thats true.\n\nYep in DB says Sannin title was pitful near White Fang name.\n\nAs these manga renown = power, WF was one of the best ever.\n\nToo bad for Konoha that TWF's offspring is the exception to the theme of the younger generation surpassing the older generation .\n\nwell,i am pretty sure that\n\nkakashi>white fang.\n\nWF was an unimportant character.WF didn't even have sharngan.\n\nad i remember that minato said \"jiraiya sensei,i can't remember a finer shinobi than you\"\n\nso jiraiya>white fang.\n\nreputation is a completely different thing.\n\nand the databook is crap.it's very misleading as it tends to hype each and every character.remember that hanzou was once >all saanin put together?\n\ni doubt that it's true now.And still pain>hanzou>kakashi>white fang.\n\nMinato stated him to have the same level of reputation as the sannin.\n\nThe second data book stated his as having SKILLS that overshadowed the sannin. The sannin were in their prime when both were said. So, did that comment include Hermit mode? Would TWF finish off pain?\n\nActually, Minato stated that Sakumo made the Sannin look like shit.\n\nWhite Fang would simply own Pein.\n\nwell,i am pretty sure that\n\nkakashi>white fang.\n\nWF was an unimportant character.WF didn't even have sharngan.\n\nad i remember that minato said \"jiraiya sensei,i can't remember a finer shinobi than you\"\n\nso jiraiya>white fang.\n\nreputation is a completely different thing.\n\nand the databook is crap.it's very misleading as it tends to hype each and every character.remember that hanzou was once >all saanin put together?\n\ni doubt that it's true now.And still pain>hanzou>kakashi>white fang.\n\nLol. TWF's hype isn't databook, it's cannon. TWF was a god, Kakashi is nowhere near him atm.\n\nLol. TWF's hype isn't databook, it's cannon. TWF was a god, Kakashi is nowhere near him atm.\n\nit isn't cannon.\n\nHe only had reputation>a young sannin.\n\nbut hanzou defeated 3 young sannins.\n\nminato only said \"WF had reputation greater than a sannin\".\n\nbut minato said \"jiraiya is the finest shinobi he can think of\".\n\njiraiya>kakashi>whitefang.\n\nit's obvious.\n\ni highly doubt that kishi would like to make a emo ninja any more powerful than jiraiya.\n\nit isn't cannon.\n\nHe only had reputation>a young sannin.\n\nbut hanzou defeated 3 young sannins.\n\nminato only said \"WF had reputation greater than a sannin\".\n\nbut minato said \"jiraiya is the finest shinobi he can think of\".\n\njiraiya>kakashi>whitefang.\n\nit's obvious.\n\ni highly doubt that kishi would like to make a emo ninja any more powerful than jiraiya.\n\nBecause Jiraiya was being emo and saying how he sucked? Minato cheered him up. Also, finest =/= strongest. Finest could mean, the person he looked up to, the person he'd like his son to be a godchild to. It doesn't mean \"You were the finest shinobi I knew, you could take down a city.\"\n\nHowever, Minato said TWF's rep exceeded the Sannin's. Meaning he accomplished more than the sannin did.\n\nAlso, Pein did said Jiraiya would have beaten them had Jiraiya not known their secret. Re-read the latest chapter.\n\nJiraya is not stronger than Pein. You're an idiot if you think so.\n\nSuicide boy is overrated. He was said to be greater than the sannin who were very young at the time he was living.. Pein destroyed Hanzou, the guy who defeated all three sannins when they were at their prime. Also, Pein killed Jiraya... Obviously if one knew his opponents \"secrets\" - fighting style, his weak point, blah blah... he would have a greater chance of winning.. that's just logic.. you don't need to believe it only after pein says so.\n\nPLease, TWF is overrated.. just look at how shit Kakashi is... TWF is probably not that far off from Kakashi..\n\nItachi Pein >>>>>>>>>>> Hanzou>>>>>>>3 sannin>>>>TWF."
