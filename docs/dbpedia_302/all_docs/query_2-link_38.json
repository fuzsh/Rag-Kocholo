        "text": "Born in 1962, Boggs grew up on a farm near Timmonsville, South Carolina. He knew he wanted to be a writer at an early age. “Kids my age would want to play characters from a popular TV show or movie like Steve McGarrett or Cool Hand Luke,” he recalls. “I was too busy making up my own characters and playing them. I wrote my first story in third grade and was hooked. I also started writing stories — super hero or detective stories mostly, not Westerns — and selling them to my classmates for a nickel or dime. My royalties were a lot higher then.”\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of South Carolina in 1984, Boggs took a job in the Dallas Times Herald sports department, working his way up to assistant sports editor when the paper folded in 1991. In 1992, Boggs joined the Fort Worth Star-Telegram sports department and was again an assistant sports editor when he left in 1998 to concentrate on his novels and free-lance writing.\n\nMore recently, he has started writing film histories. “I’ve been a film buff for as long as I can remember, and took a number of film and theater-speech classes in college,” he says. His nonfiction film studies include American Newspaper Journalists on Film: Portrayals of the Press During the Sound Era (McFarland, 2023); Sports on Film (ABC-CLIO, 2021), Billy the Kid on Film, 1911-2012 (McFarland, 2013) and Jesse James and the Movies (McFarland, 2011).\n\nAs far as his interest in the West is concerned, Boggs explains: “I remember watching Gunsmoke on Monday nights with my dad and grew up during the tail end of the TV Western era. The Virginian. Bonanza. High Chaparral. I was a fan. I also once played hooky to watch John Ford’s Fort Apache on television. I was always interested in the American West and as I grew older and discovered the true West as opposed to the Hollywood West, I became even more fascinated. When I discovered the Western fiction of Jack Schaefer and Dorothy M. Johnson, I knew that’s what I wanted to do.”\n\nA prolific writer of short nonfiction, Boggs has written about all aspects of the American West: travel stories, environmental issues, fashion news, apparel industry trends, history articles, reviews and celebrity Q&As and profiles (including James Arness, Val Kilmer, Chuck Norris, Wes Studi, Randy Travis and his friends rodeo legend Larry Mahan and the late Western writers Elmer Kelton and Max Evans). He is a frequent contributor to True West, Wild West and Western Art and Architecture magazines. He’s also an accomplished photographer whose works have appeared alongside many of his articles.\n\nWhat’s the future of the Western genre? “Publishers and filmmakers might be fickle from time to time,” he says, “but there will always be an interest in the West and our heritage. The West was, and is, vast, and there are many stories that haven’t been told, and many stories that deserve retelling. Besides, I’ve always believed that the West isn’t as much of a physical place as it is spiritual. The West is how you feel it.”\n\nActive in Little League and other community and youth activities, Boggs lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico with his wife, Lisa Smith; son, Jack."
