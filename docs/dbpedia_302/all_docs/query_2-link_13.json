These felines do not store any fat, and consequently must constantly be on the hunt. They are the only creatures on Hoth capable of matching a tauntaun's running speed.  Certain enterprising crime lords have attempted to train captured whitefangs for use as guard animals. These experiments have routinely ended in disaster for trainers and beasts alike. On the other hand, underground death duel arenas have profited tremendously from the spectacle these untamed creatures can provide.",

        "text": "Acklay\n\nAcklay are native to the planet Vendaxa, whose ultra-dense ecosystem lends itself to evolutionary specialization. There, acklay are among the top predators, able to stalk and eviscerate prey among the jungles and plains, tracking creatures by their electrical auras. An acklay is not built to build nests or forage or migrate when seasons change--an acklay only knows how to hunt, and survive the hunting.\n\nDespite various governments' efforts to prevent the spread of acklay, the creatures are traded on the black market as gladiatorial challenges and targets for big game hunters. Inevitably, a few acklay escape or are left out in the wild, and the creatures either die--or they breed, survive and threaten anyone they encounter.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141121725666440689\n\nXP Level: 40\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​acklay\n\nAkk Dog\n\nLoyal guard dogs, faithful pets and savage killers: with the right training, akk dogs can fill any of these roles. Those brave enough to challenge the beasts must contend with a thick, scaly carapace that deflects the most powerful of blows and jaws strong enough to crush durasteel. Although native to Haruun Kal, akk dogs have been exported across the galaxy to serve a variety of masters. When not domesticated, akk dogs live in the wild, hunting in packs and attacking anyone foolish enough to enter their territory.\n\nIn addition to their incredible strength, akk dogs are rumored to be Force sensitive. In recent years a Jedi named Master Sulan attempted to connect with the creatures through Force-bonding exercises. The Jedi's endeavor was cut short when his Padawan's life was claimed by a particularly hungry akk dog pack leader.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141158871960526176\n\nXP Level: 5\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​akk_dog\n\nArkonok\n\nThere's a good reason for the expression \"angry as an arkonok\" on Onderon. Though they're the closest thing to a domesticated herd animal on the planet, their unpredictable rages put would-be tamers at risk of serious bodily harm on a daily basis and destroy all but the stoutest enclosures. Arkonok meat is prized as a delicacy on Onderon, but by all accounts this is more out of respect for the handlers than for its flavor (described as \"just okay\" and \"sort of gritty\" by famed culinarian Ton-Zek Aimar).\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140981776572514752\n\nXP Level: 1\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​arkonok\n\nAsharl Panther\n\nThese fierce, attractively spotted cats are found on numerous worlds in the Outer Rim and Unknown Regions. The distinctive dorsal fronds of the asharl panther work as a set of extra sensory organs; thick nerve bundles running up the fronds allow the asharl panther to pick up the vibrations of threats approaching from behind. Along with the panthers' pelts, these fronds are often sought after by hunters.\n\nThe asharl panther has been adopted as a mascot of the Mandalorian Rodarch clan, whose members train the animals to fight alongside them and who paint their armor to match the panthers' pelts. The symbolism of a beast which is fearless and always aware of its surroundings is one the Rodarch clan has embraced wholeheartedly.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141145871965102174\n\nXP Level: 50\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​asharl_panther\n\nBantha\n\nDomestication of the bantha has become vital to survival on Tatooine and other colonized worlds. Intelligent and reliable creatures, they can be trained as pack animals, passenger carriers and even war mounts. When needed, banthas also serve as a source of sustenance. Their meat and milk are edible, and a single bantha can provide weeks' worth of food. Bantha skin and fur can be made into leather and clothing, and their horns are often carved into tools or jewelry.\n\nA lumbering Houk bounty hunter reluctantly gained the nickname \"Bantha\" Boskirn after performing several jobs on Tatooine. Boskirn's career was cut short when he angrily pulled his blaster on a smuggler who mocked him for the name; Boskirn was unfortunately too slow on the draw.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​bantha\n\nBaspoor Glider\n\nThe baspoor glider, sometimes called the \"sky swimmer\" for its fishlike appearance, is an omnivorous flying amphibian often found on temperate worlds. Its unique physiology allows it to \"land\" in water, where it can continue to propel itself with its powerful wings. It has very little mobility on solid surfaces, and has difficulty taking flight again should it find itself grounded.\n\nThe young of the baspoor glider are carried on its mother's back for the first few months of life and have a highly unusual diet. Children gnaw at the skin of the mother for nourishment while the mother focuses on her own needs--her trivial injuries healing quickly each day.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141121725666440689\n\nXP Level: 40\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​baspoor_glider\n\nBogwing\n\nBogwings are dangerous reptavian carnivores who often live near lakes or marshes. When they hunt, they skim the ground or marsh at high speed, using their long jaws to snatch up prey or strain the water for fish. Larger creatures are grasped in the bogwing's heavy front claws, which are surprisingly powerful for its size. Observations show that if a bogwing is hungry enough, it can tackle animals several times its own weight.\n\nBecause of this trait, during the Great War the Republic military briefly considered training bogwings to carry supplies or even munitions to squads in remote areas. However, bogwings are extremely temperamental and respond badly to being handled. The risk to potential trainers was judged to be too high, and the idea was never widely implemented.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141121725666440689\n\nXP Level: 41\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​bogwing\n\nBolraida\n\nUtterly at odds with the tranquility of their native Alderaan, bolraidas are one of the most aggressive species in the galaxy. They are brutally effective hunters, running down prey with their powerful front legs before gouging them with the hook-like tusks on their lower jaws.\n\nEarly Alderaanian settlers were shocked to encounter such violent beasts on their paradisiacal new home, and it wasn't long before bolraida attacks became a leading cause of death. Unlike their distant relative, the iraida, bolraidas are impossible to train; nearly every attempt to domesticate the beasts has ended disastrously.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141076066187801147\n\nXP Level: 28\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​bolraida\n\nCave Jurgoran\n\nThough not limited exclusively to caves, this subspecies of jurgoran is usually found in environments with little-to-no natural light. In order to adapt to its dark surroundings, the cave jurgoran has developed bioluminescent scales and a reflective hide. Each creature has a distinct glow pattern, nearly undetectable to most, but instantly recognizable by other cave jurgorans.\n\nIt is currently unknown how the jurgoran managed to migrate out of Dromund Kaas and settle in the darker corners of the galaxy. The most common theory among biologists is that the early Sith used jurgorans in battle but found them unpredictable and deserted them like forgotten pets. If this theory is correct, the cave jurgorans of today are descendants of these abandoned tools of war.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nXP Level: 1\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​cave_jurgoran\n\nChemilizard\n\nMost creatures avoid Hutta's polluted swamps, but these massive reptiles call the toxic marshes home. Nicknamed \"chemilizards\" by the local workers, these predators have adapted to the poisonous land by absorbing toxins, which contribute to their unique coloring and acidic saliva. Many also believe these toxins have poisoned the chemilizards' minds, turning the ferocious reptiles violent and untamable.\n\nBefore their mutation, chemilizards were a Hutt delicacy known as orpali dragons. These rare lizards were bred for harvest, killed in infancy and traditionally served over a bed of glazed chuba eyes. Orpali dragons were on the menu for the centennial feast of Bakuush the Hutt when several hatchlings escaped into the wild through the palace sewers. Over time, the resilient lizards evolved, and although one Hutt did attempt to dine on the adapted chemilizards, the results were most unappetizing.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141158871960526176\n\nXP Level: 5\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​chemlizard\n\nCthon\n\nCthons are vicious humanoids that have plagued the underworld of Coruscant for centuries, though some have found their way or been smuggled offworld. Swift to mutate from generation to generation, nearly blind despite their unusual eye structure, cthons find their prey by listening for movement and feeling vibrations through Coruscant's substructures. Many of the lower level's more superstitious believe the cthons were originally Coruscanti criminals, banished from the upper levels and left to devolve. There is no scientific evidence for this belief.\n\nWhile they usually scavenge from the huge piles of garbage that accumulate in Coruscant's lower levels, cthons are vicious hunters, capable of bringing down security patrols. Coruscant's reconstruction has been particularly beneficial to the cthon population, providing new lairs and breeding grounds, not to mention a surfeit of lost and easily preyed-upon refugees.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141154995358231178\n\nXP Level: 14\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​cthon\n\nCyberbeasts\n\nThe Gormak's fascination with technology has led them to experiment heavily in the field of organic-cybernetic hybrids, using the native fauna of Voss as their test subjects. Gormak hunting parties set out at regular intervals to trap mawvorrs, shaclaws and even the deadly vorantikus alive so that the creatures can be implanted with cybernetic upgrades, creating monstrous cyberbeasts.\n\nWhile the Voss consider this practice barbaric, it is important to note that the Gormak see cyberbeasts as improved versions of what nature intended. Considering that the cyberbeasts are faster, stronger and far more dangerous than their organic counterparts, there is some merit to this belief.\n\nThe cybernetic implants allow the Gormak to influence the natural instincts of the cyberbeasts, effectively letting the Gormak program them with simple yet very specific instructions. Not surprisingly, this makes the cyberbeasts excellent guardians of Gormak lands.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141116506689843478\n\nXP Level: 44\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​cyber_beasts\n\nDewback\n\nDewbacks are omnivorous reptiles that originated on Tatooine, where settlements, moisture farmers and Sand People alike use them as work beasts and transportation, and where wild dewbacks still roam the planet's deserts and canyons. Over time, the sturdy creatures have been exported to other worlds and found similar utilitarian niches elsewhere.\n\nCenturies ago, Czerka Corporation scientists attempted to breed \"war dewbacks\" that were larger and more aggressive than their easily domesticated cousins. Although the scientists eventually succeeded, the project was written off as a failure when the test herd broke out of its enclosure and rampaged through the research facility.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​dewback\n\nDragonbat\n\nDragonbats are nocturnal hunters often found in the dark places of warm and temperate worlds. They are able to draw sustenance from carrion as well from fresh meat, and this wide-ranging diet makes them adaptable to many environments--making them a pest to sentient creatures and a source of fear for fellow animals.\n\nDragonbats generally hunt alone or in small packs, but they occasionally gather into massive \"swarms.\" The swarm is combination mating ritual and battle royale, where the weakest of the species are culled by stronger members, who may then reproduce. While vicious, this ritual helps ensure dragonbat genetic diversity while capping the creatures' population.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​dragonbat\n\nDuneclaw\n\nRarely seen even on its home planet of Tatooine, the omnivorous, reptilian duneclaw is an aloof and solitary creature. Possibly a distant cousin of the wraid, the duneclaw has tough skin covered in armor-like plating, and this--along with its thick skull--makes this beast very difficult to bring down. A head-butt from a duneclaw is powerful enough to shatter bones, crack stone and dent metal.\n\nAlthough its eyesight is adequate, a duneclaw is able to navigate in dim light through echolocation and can easily pick up sound waves made by other creatures. For this reason, duneclaws can often be found hunting prey near Tatooine's cliffside caves and other dark, enclosed spaces.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​duneclaw\n\nFerrazid Hound\n\nMillennia ago, before Taris became a city-world--and long before that city was destroyed--ferrazid hounds lived in the planet's jungles and swamps, hunting birds and lizards and roaming in small packs. When Taris became an urban environment, ferrazids were believed extinct--the population wiped out, with only a few specimens preserved in zoos.\n\nWhen the Republic returned to the ruins of Taris, explorers found the ferrazid hound population robust and recovered. Unfortunately, the ferrazids are extremely territorial. Although they keep their distance from major settlements, they are an increasing problem for scouts and transports.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141008063347613517\n\nXP Level: 16\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​ferrazid_hound\n\nGapillian Grazer\n\nThe slow-moving, gentle-tempered Gapillian grazers are herbivores that range across Ord Mantell's grassy plains. Although their massive curved tusks and rock-like hides give them a fearsome appearance, these beasts are among the most peaceful creatures inhabiting the planet. This does not mean they are entirely harmless, however.\n\nFew things are more terrifying than a Gapillian grazer stampede at the height of mating season. With so many of these beasts grouped together, a single spooked grazer can initiate a charge capable of leveling a small town. Unwary travelers caught on foot during these catastrophic panics are rarely seen again.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141091541170885060\n\nXP Level: 3\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​grazer\n\nGrophet\n\nDomestication of the foraging omnivores known as grophets has long been a goal of livestock farmers on Rishi, but the notoriously stubborn and intelligent mammals do not take well to pens or cages. Grophets use their dense mass, low centers of gravity and nodule-pocked foreheads to ram defensively into predators and other nuisances, while their long, sensitive ears make them especially difficult to get the drop on. Grophet demand has spiked among game hunters in recent years as their raw entrails have become a noted Hutt delicacy.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141088354346344157\n\nXP Level: 55\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​grophet\n\nGuid\n\nGuids are hoofed quadrupeds indigenous to Tython. Notable for their muscular forelegs and the distinctive tufts of hair on the shoulders, back and chin, they are typically encountered grazing alone or in small herds. Guids are not particularly aggressive, but if threatened, they are capable of causing injury or even death with their massive forelegs and powerful jaws. Attempts to domesticate guids have proved unsuccessful due to their stubborn and occasionally irritable nature.\n\nJedi Master Silvarte has taken to labeling Padawans with a particularly lumbering lightsaber stance as devotees of the \"Form of the Guid.\" At least one of these Padawans--since proclaimed a full Jedi Knight--has taken this mild insult to heart, developing several lightsaber techniques inspired by the study and observation of these strange creatures. Master Silvarte considers this a mark of his success as a teacher.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140933910212274443\n\nXP Level: 6\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​guid\n\nGundark\n\nThe gundark is among the most feared of all species. Its strength is matched only by its resilience and keen senses, and it is a favorite target of big game hunters and a featured attraction in gladiatorial arenas galaxy-wide. Gundarks rarely last long in captivity, however; many beast tamers tell of letting their guard down for a half-second in the presence of these mighty creatures, only to be attacked and horribly mauled. They are the lucky ones. Anyone encountering a gundark in the wild knows to give this monster a wide berth or else be prepared for a fight; the gundark is known to attack unprovoked.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140969352659235187\n\nXP Level: 11\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​gundark\n\nHarvap\n\nOne of two new species discovered by Jarn Harvus on Nim Drovis, the harvap can be found on several planets and has thrived on heavily industrialized worlds in particular. Originally a carrion-eater, the harvap has adapted to other ecosystems by feeding on industrial waste and garbage in addition to its normal diet.\n\nHarvap infestations have plagued Hutt Space due to the density of industry and the generally lax decontamination procedures used when moving cargo from world to world. On Quesh, the byproducts of venom mining and processing have created a particularly strong breed of harvap that can thrive in the toxic atmosphere.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141165625065288506\n\nXP Level: 36\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​harvap\n\nHarvorisk\n\nThe second of two species discovered by Jarn Harvus on Nim Drovis, the harvorisk is actually no relation to the similarly named harvap. Shortly after its discovery, the harvorisk was coveted by Hutts across the galaxy, who considered it alternately an exotic new pet and a tasty meal. But its rapid rate of breeding and vicious, untrainable personality quickly led to the Hutts' becoming disenchanted with their new pets, causing the release of many harvorisks into the wild.\n\nOn Quesh, it was the Three Families who brought harvorisks to the planet and genetically modified the creatures so they might survive in the toxic atmosphere--albeit at a cost of half their lifespan. The Hutts refuse to accept responsibility for the creatures' escape, but the harvorisks have begun reproducing, seeking prey among the planet's miners.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141165625065288506\n\nXP Level: 36\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​harvorisk\n\nHorranth\n\nFour-legged reptilian predators found primarily on Tython, horranths typically hunt in large family groups called broods. With their high birth rate, quick maturation and few natural predators, the horranth population is usually constrained only by a limited food supply.\n\nIf food suddenly becomes more abundant in a region, a horranth matriarch will lay hundreds of eggs, causing her brood's population to explode. As their numbers multiply, the beasts grow bolder and more aggressive. Unchecked, the brood will continue to spread until they finally exceed their food supply, at which point the matriarch will suddenly stop producing eggs. Unfortunately, this return to normal population levels typically only happens after the brood has thoroughly devastated the region.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140933910212274443\n\nXP Level: 8\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​horranth\n\nScyk\n\nThe bloodthirsty scyks inhabit remote regions of Tatooine, thankfully far from most settled areas. They seem almost to delight in carnage, brutally tearing through prey and unwary desert travelers. Their fangs are a prized trophy among hunters, who rarely escape the creatures without scars.\n\nThe Sith beastmaster Lord Adrazar found the scyk a deadly and eager servant. However, no amount of training or Force manipulation could persuade the creatures to cooperate in packs for more than a few days. The scyk that survived--obviously the strongest--now guards his personal domicile on Dromund Kaas.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​hssiss\n\nKath Hound\n\nNative to Dantooine, kath hounds are sturdy, horned creatures with a ruff of fur. Although they can be aggressive if threatened or during mating season, they are normally docile, intelligent creatures who take well to training. Kath hounds are popular across the galaxy as guard dogs and pets (although the latter usually have their horns trimmed as a precaution).\n\nAlbino kath hounds are rare and highly prized by breeders. On Dantooine, seeing an albino kath hound is considered lucky; there are even stories of albino hounds protecting people lost in the hills. While these stories are unlikely to be more than legends, an albino kath hound is large and intimidating enough to frighten off Dantooine's worst predators, kinraths, which certainly would prey on lost travelers.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141076066187801147\n\nXP Level: 50\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​kath_hound\n\nKintan Crusher\n\nKintan crushers, also known as \"Kintan enforcers,\" are savage, brutish creatures native to the Nikto homeworld of Kintan. They are characterized by their stocky builds, powerful arms and large, meaty fists. Crushers are notably smarter than their cousins, the Kintan striders, and are rarely seen in the wild thanks to centuries of \"domestication\" by the Hutts; the Kintan crushers' ability to follow complex commands and pound their victims into jelly inspired the Hutts to employ them as reliable and obedient footsoldiers. Many speculate as to how the Hutts pay their Kintan enforcers, with guesses ranging from the absurd to the grotesque.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141121725666440689\n\nXP Level: 40\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​kintan\n\nK'lor'slug\n\nHulking, worm-like creatures with pincer legs and gaping maws of teeth, k'lor'slugs are among the most dangerous species on Korriban. Not only can they shear a man in half or swallow him whole, they can project their vile, venomous spit great distances. Hatched from eggs laid hundreds at a time by their queens and blessed with a short incubation period, these hideous monsters can infest and overrun an area in no time.\n\nA century ago, a notorious hunter named Riegenn Hetuu was contracted to bring a live k'lor'slug queen to an eccentric Hutt for a gala celebration. The beast was meant to be a highlight in the Hutt's annual gladiatorial tournament, but when Riegenn arrived on Hutta and opened his cargo bay, some four hundred k'lor'slugs poured out, consuming the hunter as well as the Hutt. To this day, the sound made when a batch of k'lor'slugs hatch is called \"a Hutt's cry.\"\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140965352798472550\n\nXP Level: 1\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​klorslug\n\nKowakian Monkey-Lizard\n\nWhen it comes to compatibility, few pets in the criminal underworld can outmatch a monkey-lizard from the planet Kowak.

The Kowakian monkey-lizard isn't exactly defenseless, either. When cornered, they are known to go for any would-be assailant's neck and eyes with their sharp claws and powerful beaks.\n\nFor those whose sense of humor tends toward the sadistic, it also doesn't hurt that Kowakian monkey-lizards are notoriously cruel. Their knack for recognizing weakness in others provides ample opportunity for acts of public humiliation, which they'll often carry out while chirping away with a mocking laughter that will haunt the victim until their dying days.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141088354346344157\n\nXP Level: 55\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​kowakian_monkey_lizard\n\nKrakjya\n\nThe golden-hued and black-striped pelage of the krakjya instills in those who behold the tropical feline a notion of majestic beauty, but maintaining that affectation would be a mistake. Krakjyas are savage predators, acting only in regard to self-preservation without anything resembling decorum or elegance. Powerful back muscles allow krakjyas to leap great distances and pin down quarry several times their own weight long enough to render it lifeless with their long, sharp teeth. Even the great Massassi warriors of Yavin 4 know better than to face a krakjya without lots of backup.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141006993103609455\n\nXP Level: 58\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​krakjya\n\nLisk\n\nDespite its bipedal shape, the lisk is actually a carnivorous species of warm-blooded reptile suited to cold-weather climates. The \"hairs\" on its head and torso are in fact sharp, fibrous scales that help protect it from low temperatures and larger creatures. Sentient species are often surprised at how vicious a lisk can be, as its wide eyes and childlike grin give it a harmless appearance.\n\nThe lisk's two pairs of eyes are operated by different hemispheres of its brain, and are integral to its survival while sleeping. Only half of the lisk's body falls asleep at one time, allowing each pair of eyes to keep watch during half of its sleep cycle.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​lisk\n\nLobel\n\nThe lobel appears to be one of very few species actually indigenous to the planet Quesh, though it can be found in small pockets throughout the galaxy--perhaps the work of a single explorer thousands of years ago.\n\nA slow-moving creature, the lobel has four stomachs that are key to its survival in some of the most ravaged ecosystems known to civilization. The slow rate of digestion and normally languid movement of the lobel has allowed it to survive even when food is very rare, and there appears to be a degree of redundancy in the four stomachs--when the toxicity of industry damages one, the lobel is able to continue eating and digesting.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141165625065288506\n\nXP Level: 36\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​lobel\n\nLurker\n\nLean, amphibious bipeds with a tendency to travel in packs, lurkers are carrion eaters most comfortable in tropical environments. Alone, they usually avoid confronting danger, crawling into tight spaces and observing potential threats from a distance. In numbers, they can strike with a rabid, frenzied intensity, happily downing prey for later consumption.\n\nBiologists serving the Hutt Cartel believe that lurkers originated on a nameless jungle world on the edges of the Torch Nebula. They were first identified in the wider galaxy two hundred years ago, and have begun appearing on more and more worlds ever since. No convincing explanation for the lurkers' spread has been offered, leaving the creatures a disturbing mystery.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141121725666440689\n\nXP Level: 40\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​lurker\n\nManka Cat\n\nFierce feline hunters, manka cats are believed to have originated on Alderaan but can now be found on a number of different worlds due to their desirability as exotic pets or trained guardians. It is no surprise that these accomplished hunters have thrived in virtually every ecosystem into which they have been introduced. Sleek and powerful, they have the speed to run down smaller prey, while their massive protruding tusks and claws also allow them to tackle much larger targets. Often traveling in prides, even a lone manka cat can be dangerous, and extreme caution should be exercised when in their territory. Despite the risks, manka cats are sometimes hunted for sport and for their tusks and teeth, which are said to possess healing properties.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140933910212274443\n\nXP Level: 7\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​manka\n\nMantellian Flutterplume\n\nAlthough its beautiful feathers are valued as good luck charms, everything else about the Mantellian flutterplume is worth avoiding. This enormous scavenger bird is noted for its impressive hook-like beak and four sets of curled talons--tools that it uses to tear apart and consume rotting carcasses.\n\nThe flutterplume population has skyrocketed thanks to Ord Mantell's brutal civil war. An abundant supply of fresh battlefield kills attracts flocks of these carrion eaters. Soldiers whisper horror stories of wounded men unable to defend themselves and doomed by the hungry winged predators.\n\nSubspecies of the Mantellian flutterplume have evolved on a handful of other Republic worlds where the birds have been imported.

They prefer striking at whatever wounded predators or wandering humanoids they come across to carefully hunting and stalking their food, though in packs they exhibit increased aggression and have been known to attack even the mighty vorantikus.\n\nMawvorrs also typically attack Gormak on sight, though they refuse to eat the bodies afterwards. This odd behavior has led the Voss to perceive mawvorrs as guardians or protectors who abhor the Gormak. Because of this, the Voss take steps to maintain the mawvorr population around Voss-Ka.\n\nThis symbiotic relationship can be taken to extremes during times when the mawvorr food supply is low. There is a historical account of a Mystic's vision resulting in unarmed Voss wandering out into the wilderness and allowing themselves to be devoured by mawvorr packs.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141116506689843478\n\nXP Level: 44\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​mawvorr\n\nNekghoul\n\nRakghouls evolve with incredible speed, but until recently, they had never shown signs of intelligence. Larger and far smarter than their rakghoul cousins, nekghouls may qualify as a new species in their own right--they appear unable to infect and transform their victims, but instead possess sensitivity to the Force and violent, untrained talent in its use.\n\nAlthough nekghouls are capable of speech, they have no known history or record of their origins. Are they the result of a Jedi or Sith being infected with the rakghoul virus? A mutation caused by radiation from Taris's shattered reactors?

Their tendency to spit on people has only cemented their reputation for being particularly unpleasant animals to handle; it's no surprise that nerf-herding is regarded as one of the less glamorous professions in the galaxy.\n\nAlthough they are native to Alderaan, the nerfs' hardiness has allowed them to adapt to a variety of climates on other planets.

The rakghoul virus can infect hundreds of known species and is most often delivered through a rakghoul's bite; a person attacked by a rakghoul and \"lucky\" enough to survive typically becomes a rakghoul him- or herself. Some victims resist the virus for days, succumbing to rakghoul instincts while retaining their original bodies.\n\nDifferent strains of the virus manifest in different breeds of rakghoul--the smallest and weakest travel in enormous colonies, whereas larger, smarter rakghouls often hunt alone. The virus mutates fastest when infecting new species, and slowest when rakghouls reproduce with other rakghouls.\n\nBefore the planet's bombardment, Taris contained its substantial rakghoul population in the undercity. Many specialists believe rakghouls are native to Taris, but rare outbreaks elsewhere in the galaxy suggest the truth is more complicated.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141008063347613517\n\nXP Level: 16\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​rakghoul\n\nRancor\n\nRancors are reptilian monstrosities known as some of the galaxy's most dangerous predators.

Rancors are a favorite among the wealthiest underworld crime lords, who raise them from eggs to become (relatively) tame pets. Those whose rancors survive to adulthood are afforded a great deal of status, as well as a powerful weapon against their enemies.\n\nA unique feature of the rancor is its tough hide--a mixture of fine scales, thick skin and bony plates. Blaster bolts and vibroblades have little effect upon the hide, and while these attributes fade from a hide removed from a rancor carcass, a few lucky hunters nonetheless wear ornamental outfits made from the material.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141121725666440689\n\nXP Level: 40\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​rancor\n\nRanphyx\n\n\"I was somewhere in the Sertar sector, on my way back to Centares.

It is no exaggeration to state that these tusked, fanged beasts present a serious threat to anything smaller than an armored shuttlecraft.\n\nDuring the early settlement of Ord Mantell, a small farming convoy broke down on a remote plain at nightfall and fell prey to a razoronn pack. The curious predators began \"investigating\" these intruders in their hunting grounds. The farmers' landspeeders offered no shelter from the ravenous creatures.

They originally hail from the planet Ylesia but can be found all over the galaxy, particularly on Iridonia, Ithor and Tatooine. They are highly sought-after as pack animals, but are also commonly used as mounts.\n\nCuriously, reeks' temperaments are largely dictated by their diets. While they normally subsist on plants, reeks will eat meat if it is offered to them; however, a carnivorous diet turns their skin dark red and makes them extremely hostile. This phenomenon inspired the phrase \"mad as a red reek\" and has led to the practice of using battle-maddened reeks in gladiatorial arenas.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​reek\n\nRill\n\nOne of the swiftest land animals on Tatooine, the rill is a reptilian predator that hunts womp rats and other large mammals.

To sleep and protect itself from Tatooine's blistering heat, the rill burrows into the sand several meters below the surface.\n\nThese nests are also where rills lay their eggs, burying the eggs under sand to hide them from scavengers. The first task of a newly hatched rill is to successfully dig its way back up to the surface, or else be abandoned by its mother and broodmates.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​rill\n\nSalky Hound\n\nMany know the salky hound for its acute senses, unbreakable claws and exceptionally powerful bite; few know this vicious beast was actually designed in a laboratory.

Salky hounds turned out to be ferocious and impossible to train for military action. After several accidental deaths, the Republic military canceled the contract, and salky hounds were banned from the Core Worlds.\n\nHowever, many breeding pairs were sold quietly on the black market, and the hounds have appeared on dozens of worlds since.

Some stories report that the beast is capable of \"sand swimming,\" gliding underneath the surface of the desert as if it were water. Others claim it bores through rock using its hardened, talon-like legs.\n\nCave paintings suggest the Sand People believe the Sand Demon devours the life essence of its victims, growing stronger and tougher with each kill.

Sandtuskers mainly feed on carrion, and their powerful maws are capable of crunching through even krayt dragon bones to reach the nutrient-rich marrow inside.\n\nA platoon in the Republic's Thirty-eighth Infantry--several members of which had lived on Tatooine--named its armored walker \"the Sandtusker.\" True to form, it carried the soldiers safely through the harshest battles of the Great War.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​sandtusker\n\nSavrip\n\nThe savrips' bestial appearance leads many to dismiss them as nothing more than monstrous hulking predators that attack on instinct.

Would a mindless animal really wear a tanned hide and belt made from Gapillian grazers?\n\nDespite their brutish and primitive appearance, savrips are an intelligent species capable of communication. Unfortunately, for the average Ord Mantellian, savrips are actively hostile to other life-forms. Previously content to remain in their home territories, recent surges in savrip attacks have led authorities to speculate on a separatist-savrip alliance, but these claims remain unsubstantiated.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141091541170885060\n\nXP Level: 8\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​savrip\n\nShaclaw\n\nMassive, armored insects, shaclaws use their powerful foreclaws primarily for burrowing into the soil in search of the roots and subterranean mammals that make up their diet. If challenged, however, they can also use their claws as savage weapons capable of shredding the flesh or armor of their enemies.\n\nThe Gormak consider the meat of the shaclaw to be a delicacy, but within minutes of dying the insects release a deadly toxin into their tissues that contaminates the flesh. To circumvent this, the Gormak have become quite skilled at capturing shaclaws and cooking them alive.\n\nXenoanthropologists are quick to note that Gormak only dine on shaclaws during special coming of age feasts in which the capture and preparation of the meal is considered an essential part of the ritual celebration. The Voss reject this symbolic justification, however, and point to the practice of cooking any creature alive as proof of Gormak savagery and barbarism.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141116506689843478\n\nXP Level: 44\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​shaclaw\n\nShade Stalker\n\nAn excerpt of notes from Dr. Juvard Illip Oggurobb:\n\nThe creatures appear predatory in nature, exhibiting highly aggressive tendencies.

Whether they were born of the conditions or simply corrupted by them remains to be seen. Their scaly hides indicate a defense against aggressors, suggesting these creatures may not have always been so predatory. My conjecture is that their natural course of evolution was somehow rapidly thrust forward by an unknown process. Could the Force be responsible?

Although they have poor eyesight, skyslashers have evolved a powerful sense of smell that allows them to not only detect victims at a distance, but tell whether they are injured or exhausted enough to be easy prey.\n\nThe bad eyesight of skyslashers may be no accident. The Sith Lord Erindax had an interest in creating new species and bred the first skyslashers centuries ago as a hobby. He overestimated his control of the creatures, however, and was blinded in one eye when the flock suddenly turned on him. Afterward, Erindax engineered his skyslashers to be almost blind; either out of fear for his remaining eye, or to avenge himself on his wayward pets.\n\nCategory: Lost Knowledge\n\nXP Level: 10\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​skyslasher\n\nSleen\n\nSleek and web-footed, the sleen is among the fastest creatures that crawl through the Dromund Kaas jungle.

Ancient chronicles report terentatek-like creatures on Korriban, twisted by the dark side rituals performed by early Dark Jedi. Other sources attribute their creation directly to the Sith Lord Exar Kun, who performed many Force experiments on creatures on Yavin 4. Terentateks are undoubtedly one of the most vicious of all creatures steeped in the dark side, and they are doubly dangerous because of their unnatural resistance to Force powers.\n\nJedi throughout the ages have tried to wipe terentateks from the galaxy, but the creatures have proven incredibly resilient.

Early Alderaanian colonists made extensive use of thrantas, using them for personal and military transport.\n\nTheir popularity on Alderaan generated an enormous demand for the animals on Coruscant; thousands of thrantas were transplanted, but they were unable to survive the city-world's heavy air pollution.

A prime example of this is the Ruhnukan Tineback. As humorous as their features may be to onlookers, they all have a purpose. The Tineback's ridged nose and large, blunt underbite allows it to hoe soil and chisel rock at an alarming rate. The Tineback's stout, spined tail often serves a dual purpose. In addition to providing a perfect posterior defense against an enemy, the tail can also be used as camouflage. When feeling vulnerable, Tinebacks can quickly bore straight down into the dirt, burying themselves up to their haunches. Its tail--the only part of the Tineback left exposed--resembles a dangerous, spiny succulent that grows in some of the world's more hazardous areas.\n\nAmong the beasts found on Ruhnuk, the Tineback is the most varied. From canyon to clifftop, these thickset beasts roam in groups varying from small clusters to large mobs--referred to by many as a \"mix,\" given their range in color and pattern--chewing their way through most anything in their path. The few sentient visitors to the planet have been known to make a game out of documenting and sharing tales of their sightings.\n\nThe most unique discoveries include the elusive \"Knock-Kneed\" Tineback, whose uncanny speed is the envy of mount trainers, and the \"Dulcet Tone\"-back, so named for its glass-like tines that chime as it scurries. One famous encounter involved a smaller, unusually friendly, \"beefy\" variety of Tineback.

Packs of vrblthers are known to roam the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa, in constant search of their next meal.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140948956820683845\n\nXP Level: 20\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​vrbither\n\nVulagool\n\nVulagools are a species of small, hunched bipeds most commonly found on Alderaan. They are primarily scavengers, though they are known to bring down larger animals in packs.\n\nWhile their planet of origin is unclear, some researchers believe vulagools were once a sentient species driven to near-extinction by the Killiks and brought to Alderaan to work in the Killik hives millennia ago. Others suggest the vulagools are themselves descended from Killik Joiners who mutated unexpectedly and were driven from the nests. Whatever their true nature, vulagools seem to both fear and hate the Killiks and do whatever they can to steer clear of the insectoids.\n\nCategory: Lost Knowledge\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​vulagool\n\nWampa\n\nThe fearsome wampa is Hoth's apex predator. These surprisingly intelligent beasts pose a major hazard to unwary travelers, especially those wandering near unexplored caves. More than one combat patrol has vanished after seeking shelter in a seemingly unoccupied ice cavern. Among fresh arrivals to the planet, horror stories circulate of men swallowed whole by these towering creatures.\n\nThe more terrifying truth is that wampas prefer fresh meat and rarely kill a victim outright, instead stunning or incapacitating prey. Future meals are dragged back to a wampa's lair and suspended immobilized from the cave's ceiling. Wampa victims may have hours or even days to contemplate their eventual fates.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141109882649941585\n\nXP Level: 36\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​wampa\n\nWingmaw\n\nWingmaws are a biological oddity, an evolutionary branch of Balmorran life that developed on an isolated chain of islands; it was only six hundred years ago that wingmaws were accidentally carried to the mainland by unwary explorers. The creatures maintain insect-like social structures despite their reptilian appearance, frequently traveling in groups and favoring open spaces to dark caves.\n\nThe wingmaw population on Balmorra has increased rapidly since the Imperial invasion, as the creatures' primary predator--the Balmorran maweater, another transplant from the island chain--was completely wiped out during the bombardment. Unchecked, the wingmaw has become a threat to Imperial and resistance soldiers alike and wreaked havoc on the rest of the Balmorran ecosystem. They are bold carnivores and scavengers, happily swarming on a lone fighter or an unprepared convoy.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140933910212274443\n\nXP Level: 16\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​wingmaw\n\nWomp Rat\n\nCarnivorous rodents native to Tatooine, womp rats are a menace to any permanent settlement. They reproduce at a staggering rate and are known to stalk urban alleyways and remote moisture farms alike, prompting some authorities to maintain a standing bounty on the creatures. Vicious and ill-tempered, they prefer meals of organic debris and runoff--but even lone womp rats will attack any creature that gets too close, often spreading virulent disease.\n\nWhen found in the desert, womp rats also hunt in packs, emerging from burrows and swarming their unfortunate victims in a flurry of claws and teeth. A dozen womp rats can overwhelm a full-grown dewback in just a few seconds, and larger packs regularly feast on fresh bantha.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​womprat\n\nWraid\n\nHunting dangerous predators is a tradition on Tatooine, and stalking the deadly wraid is often a test to separate the amateurs from the experts. In addition to its great strength and powerful jaws, a wraid is able to quickly cover large distances by breaking into a bounding sprint. The impact of its massive forelegs creates highly distinctive tracks in the sand for hunters to either follow or avoid.\n\nRumors persist across Tatooine of a gigantic \"alpha\" wraid that stalks deep in the desert wastes. Some hunters claim to have seen it; others tell tales of stumbling across its oversized claw prints before the desert wind blew them away. Its existence, however, has never been confirmed.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141178175742985098\n\nXP Level: 24\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​wraid\n\nXuvva\n\nThe flapping of thick, hairless wings is often the last sound heard by a victim of the deadly xuvvas. Their fangs bite with brutal precision, quickly disabling prey while filling the xuvvas' swollen stomachs. The creatures then take flight and hunt down their next meal using sensitive electroreceptors in their horn-like antenna. A single xuvva is capable of killing a trained hunter; an entire flock can reduce a mature Hutt to bones in minutes.\n\nUnknown to most, xuvvas are distant relations to the decidedly less vicious mynocks. Like their parasitic cousins, xuvvas latch onto power sources and leech their electrical energy. Ten years ago, an entire xuvva flock sapped enough power from a subterranean conduit to cause a blackout over half of Jiguuna. In a fit of fury, Nem'ro the Hutt placed a bounty on the creatures that was quickly called off when his palace became littered with the trophies of dead xuvvas.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16141158871960526176\n\nXP Level: 5\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​xuvva_soarer\n\nYozusk\n\nYozusks were originally referred to as \"rock wardens\" by the Sith when they arrived on Dromund Kaas, because they nested in the cliffsides around the jungle and because of the hard, rocky protrusions on their backs. Though they are extremely territorial, they primarily feed on animals living beneath the ground, which they dig up with their long arms. They are nocturnal creatures and rely primarily on their sense of smell in the darkness. They are incredibly strong, and many young thrill-seekers cut their teeth fighting the yozusks before moving on to the larger, more powerful gundarks.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140969352659235187\n\nXP Level: 11\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​yozusk\n\nZeldrate\n\nThe zeldrate is a sleek predator that used to hunt bormus in the Balmorran plains--but with the bormu population dwindling, the zeldrate has increasingly targeted sentient prey. Imperial troops and resistance fighters wounded during battle are common victims, but bolder zeldrates have assaulted full squads.\n\nPrior to the invasion, zeldrates were hunted for a caustic chemical secretion useful as a cleaning solution for industrial parts. Today, with Balmorran industry operating below half capacity, the zeldrate population has seen a slight increase--balanced by the fact that they are often killed seeking easy prey on the battlefield.\n\nCategory: Bestiary\n\nPlanet: 16140903155296015570\n\nXP Level: 16\n\nFQN: cdx.​bestiary.​zeldrate"
