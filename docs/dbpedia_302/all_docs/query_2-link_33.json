        "text": "The guest of honor at a gathering of volunteers for Jack London State Historic Park had its own table of honor at last week’s celebration marking the writer’s 148th birthday.\n\nIn a dimly lit dining room at the old Jack London Saloon in downtown Glen Ellen guests paid their respects to the original typewriter on which London most likely tapped out classics such as, “The Call of the Wild,” and “White Fang,” as well as numerous other books, stories and articles that made him one of the most prolific and prosperous writers of his day.\n\nThe antique machine had been away from Glen Ellen for decades, one of many artifacts and heirlooms belonging to the author that had been sold or given away by his heirs over the years.\n\nSome 50 guests took turns inspecting the tool of London’s trade, which was perched on a small table and backlit by the flames from a big fireplace behind it.\n\nMany experienced a bit of awe realizing it was on this typewriter that London produced so many of his greatest works.\n\n“I’m star struck by the typewriter,” laughed Laurie Armstrong Gossy, who handles public relations for Jack London Park Partners, the group that manages the historic park that once was the home and ranch of London and his wife Charmian.\n\nThe typewriter was made by the Columbia Typewriter Manufacturing Co. in 1903 with an old keyboard foreign to modern typists. It has separate keys for upper and lowercase letters and with the top row featuring 2WBMRN, rather than the QWERTY that became the standard of 20th-century keyboards.\n\nAccording to the American Typewriters Museum in Chicago, there also is no exclamation point, so London would have had to type a period and add a capital I above it.\n\nThe typewriter had a long journey home to Glen Ellen. It was acquired in the early 1960s by Waring Jones, a writer, theatrical producer and collector of American authors. Some of his London collection is now housed in an eponymous reading room at Sonoma State University.\n\nThe typewriter, though, was not part of the items that went to Sonoma State 24 years ago.\n\nIt had been sold to Steve Soboroff, an Los Angeles businessman, civic leader and philanthropist who had assembled a world-class collection of typewriters, not just owned by great authors but famous people — all of whom had appeared on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nLifetime literary collector\n\nDarius Anderson, himself a lifetime and leading collector of London ephemera and artifacts, had long set his sights on that very typewriter.\n\nWhen he read that Soboroff’s collection was going up for auction in December, billed as “The World’s Greatest Typewriter Collection,” he finally scored the Columbia Bar-lock Model 10, once owned by London.\n\nAnderson is a developer, lobbyist, political strategist, investor and managing partner of Sonoma Media Investments (parent company of The Press Democrat).\n\n“I have a couple of other things that I think are as important but I’ve been searching for this for 37 years,” he said at the birthday celebration where he set his prized new acquisition out for volunteers — London fans all — to inspect and ogle.\n\nFor a literary collector, owning Jack London’s typewriter, he explained, is akin to owning Yo-Yo Ma’s cello or Johnny Cash’s guitar.\n\n“It’s a great thing, ” he said, “and I’m glad to have it home.”\n\nLong pursuit of London\n\nAnderson has been in pursuit of London since he was 12 years old, when his father Tom Anderson, brought him up from their Novato home to Jack London Park.\n\nAnderson’s father also bought him his first edition at the old World of Jack London Bookstore. The Glen Ellen shop was run by the late Russ Kingman, a legendary London biographer and booster whose bookstore was a gathering spot for the writer’s ardent fans and scholars.\n\n”He bought me a book called “War of the Classes,” which is a struggle between rich and poor. It was very hard for a 12-year-old dyslexic kid to read. It wasn’t until adulthood that I finally finished it,“ Darius Anderson said. ”It’s a lifelong passion.“\n\nTom Anderson also attended the party, with his wife Eileen and Darius’ young son Tyge, a fellow London fan whose favorite book is “Call of the Wild.”\n\nThe eldest Anderson said the family’s multigenerational fascination for Jack London goes back to his own father, who came out from Georgia on his own at the age of 12 and took a job at Heinold’s First and Last Chance Saloon, which is still in business at what is now Jack London Square in Oakland.\n\nHeinold’s was a frequent watering hole for the writer. It contains the very table where it is believed London often sat — a venerated spot.\n\n“My dad was called a swamper,“ Tom Anderson recalled. ”He used to clean out the spittoon and wipe the floors. Then I got interested in Jack London and I passed that on to my oldest son.“\n\nDarius Anderson won the typewriter with an $11,200 bid, a modest amount compared to the $162,000 someone paid for the 1926 Underwood Standard that Ernest Hemingway used to type letters from his estate in Havana.\n\nBut London’s machine still was the third-most expensive typewriter in the auction, fetching more than typewriters used by E.M. Forester, George Bernard Shaw, Tennessee Williams and “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynksi.\n\nAnderson said he was prepared to pay more if he had to. But because the auction was through Heritage Auctions, which specializes in Americana, he wasn’t facing the same global competition he went up against 30 years ago. At that time, he said, he was bidding against big wheel London collectors in the Soviet Union and Asia through major international auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s.\n\nAnd London, he added, despite being a bone fide celebrity in his day, does not get the same continuing attention as some other 20th-century authors.\n\n“The problem with Jack is he’s no longer on the reading list. And I think a lot of people are losing connection with him. Especially because of some of the controversial issues like (London’s) views on race and politics,” Anderson said.\n\nKathy Hillback, who with her husband George, volunteers as a curatorial assistant in the cottage where London lived and wrote, said it was “fascinating” to see the actual typewriter he used to pound out up to 15,000 words a day.\n\nLondon churned out a lot of material, largely to support the ranch, his travels and larger than life lifestyle.\n\nHillback said the typewriter on display in the cottage is not original to London. Many of the items there, she added, are replacements.\n\n“It’s fun to see something that is a real artifact from Jack London’s time,” she said. “In the cottage, where it can get real hot in the porches, things would just fry. We would not put out real artifacts.”\n\nStill, there are some items — desks and chairs — that actually were used by London, items she cleans and inspects with white gloves.\n\n“We always think we’re going to hear Jack talk to us and thank us for taking care of his things. It hasn’t happened yet,” she chuckled. “It’s just an honor and a privilege to be able to work with the artifacts.”\n\nEric Metz, director of operations for the park, said people were excited by the prospect of seeing such a new and important artifact.\n\n“We’re blessed to get to see a lot of Jack London artifacts up there but, obviously, this typewriter is something special. It’s something I’ve never seen before and probably won’t get a lot of opportunities to see again,” he said.\n\nA loss of memorabilia\n\nA lot of items left the ranch when it fell on hard times.\n\nAnderson said Charmian struggled to maintain the sprawling ranch after her husband’s death in 1916. She and London’s sister, Eliza Shepard, weighed a lot of options, with Charmian writing books and selling licensing agreements for movies to generate cash to keep the ranch going.\n\n“But it just didn’t cover all the costs,” he said.\n\nAs a result, objects like the typewriter were sold, well before their historical significance was fully realized. Shepard’s son, Milo, also sold items to select collectors, like Jones, who he believed were serious and had a deep appreciation for London.\n\nAnderson said he actually knew Soboroff when he was living and working in L.A. in the 1990s. The collector thoroughly researched the provenance of each of his typewriters.\n\nWith London, he worked with the curator of the London collection at The Huntington Library in San Marino, digging up any documents referencing the typewriter.\n\nAll of that came with the typewriter at auction and there were some interesting tidbits, including a letter that London had written to another writer saying he wrote 1,500 to 2,000 words a day. Most references suggest he pumped out 1,200 to 1,500 words a day.\n\n“Its important because he was a spendaholic and he was paid by the word,” Anderson said.\n\nHe said London probably owned many typewriters. But he figured the writer used this one between 1903 and 1912, a fruitful period in his career that included “Call of the Wild.”\n\nAmong the research that came with the machine at auction was a promotional card handed out at stores featuring the new Bar-Lock No. 10 and noting that Jack London owned one.\n\nThe typewriter will remain in Anderson’s personal museum, along with other acquisitions, like London’s dictaphone and a typewriter that belonged to Charmian, who in later years typed London’s work from his longhand drafts.\n\nMuch of Anderson’s collection is centered around London’s literature, first editions and papers, which are fragile and need to be maintain in a strict temperature and humidity-controlled environment, conditions not available at Jack London Park.\n\nHe said he and his son have talked about perhaps building a structure to properly house the collection.\n\n“Tyge and I have guaranteed one thing: I’m not going to sell the collection,” he said. ”It will stay in Sonoma County. It will be part of our culture.“\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Meg McConahey at 707-521-5204 or meg.mcconahey@pressdemocrat.com."
