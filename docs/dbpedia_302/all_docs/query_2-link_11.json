Saturday morning comedy for all ages brought to you by comic Soupy Sales and his friends Black Tooth, White Fang and Pookie. Largely one-set production relied heavily on cuts to old film clips and a certain amount of slapstick, as well as amusing improvisation.",

        "text": "I loved this show as a kid. It was very funny, and the pie throwing slap stick comedy was perfect for a 10 year old, but a lot of the subtle humor was way over our heads, aimed at adults. I remember he used to answer a knock on the door and open it. We never saw who was behind the door unless they entered, but could only imagine who or what was there. In college when I worked at a TV station, I saw some rather blue video tapes. One of them was a Soupy Sales show in which he would answer the door and they would play the song The Stripper. He would ooh, ah and grin before closing the door. I think he reopened the door 4 or 5 times - same song - same comments. The video I saw interspersed cuts from behind the door. Yes there was a stripper there. I heard his crew pulled all kinds of pranks like this and worse, on him while he was doing his live show."
