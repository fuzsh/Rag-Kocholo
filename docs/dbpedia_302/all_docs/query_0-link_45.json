        "text": "White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf is a 1994 sequel to the 1991 film, White Fang. It was released on April 15, 1994, by Walt Disney Pictures. This Northern film was directed by Ken Olin and stars Scott Bairstow, Alfred Molina, and Geoffrey Lewis. Ethan Hawke reprises his role of Jack Conroy. The filming locations were entirely in British Columbia, Canada's Metro Vancouver region. Walt Disney Home Video released this movie on VHS October 19, 1994\n\nPlot[]\n\nWhile Jack Conroy (Ethan Hawke) was in San Francisco, White Fang was living and banding together with his master's friend, Henry Casey (Scott Bairstow). While they were sailing to bring their gold to town, they had been washed up. At the Native Americans' tribe, Moses (Al Harrington) had a dream about White Fang with his daughter Lilly (Charmaine Craig). He said that Lilly will guide them the way to finding the wolf due to this dream. Lilly sailed to the river and then walked through the forest when she heard White Fang barking. She ran as fast as she could, and she saw White Fang, but White Fang suddenly disappeared, then she saw Henry appearing, leading her to believe that the wolf (White Fang) had changed into Henry. She rescued Henry from the river and placed him inside her small boat, and traveled back to the starving tribe. Then she introduced Henry to her father when they got back to Lilly's home. While Moses was telling Henry that he is the wolf, Henry said that he is not the wolf, and that the wolf was his friend, White Fang, and that he himself is a human, leading to laughter from the crowd. In actuality, White Fang was left at the river, but he got out of the waters and onto land. White Fang then walked through the wilderness in the forest and saw some wolves. He followed them, saw a pack, but he did not socialize with them.\n\nThat day, Henry went back to the town. He saw many hungry people and was seen by Reverend Leland Drury, saying \"Sad, isn't it?\" to Henry. White Fang, who saw the village where Lilly lived in, approached the village and was seen by Lilly. Lilly called Moses, her father, and said, \"That's him,\" pointing at White Fang, indicating that White Fang was the wolf. Moses went to see White Fang, but the half-dog, half-wolf ran away.\n\nThe next day, Henry decided to go back to the village, with a white cloth. He saw Lilly and decided to give the cloth to her, Lilly said something that led Henry to be angry. While White Fang was at the forest, he saw again the pack, but one female wolf decided to join him to play. That night, he was in the Native American group dancing the Native American dance, suddenly, he heard White Fang howling, and Moses allowed him to go. Henry ran and traveled to the forest with a torch, calling White Fang, and he saw a wolf, and gently saying White Fang, and was surprised that it was another wolf, and White Fang came and protected him against the wolf. And Henry called White Fang to go to the village, but because White Fang had another friend wolf, that made him hesitate. Henry understood White Fang and let him to go with his friend, but White Fang decided against and joined Henry traveling back to the village. When he slept, he also dreamed what Moses dreamed about, White Fang and Lilly, but now, with him.\n\nMoses then prepares Henry, giving him a pack of arrows and a bow and being sent to the forest to practice his skills in hunting. He shot once but missed, but is surprised that an arrow hit his target perfectly. He shouts if someone is there, and Lilly comes out. She then helps him how to hunt using his bow with extreme accuracy.\n\nPeter and Henry practice hunting in the forest. Lilly, now Henry's love interest, was the cousin of Peter, so he asked some ideas about how he could answer her. Peter said \"Put your chin to her shoulder, and whisper through her ears,\" then Henry asked why Peter said, \"She'll break your nose.\"\n\nMoses allows Peter, Lilly's cousin to hunt with Henry, then after that Lilly's mother asks his husband, Moses, what will happen next, and he says that Peter will not come back. Lilly is forcing his father to join Henry hunt, but his father replied that she's a woman, and she can't hunt.\n\nWhen the time of the hunting came, Henry, with White Fang and Peter goes to the forest. Lilly grabs her bow and secretly slips into the forest to join Henry hunt. Henry and Joseph then see that the village's hunters that didn't return. Henry accidentally steps into a trap, resulting in a log to be swung towards him, but successfully evades it. Peter goes up to the dead body of the hunter that didn't listen to Henry, who said not to go there, then a bullet hit the dead body, and Henry saw it. Peter ran tree by tree, with the man with the gun chasing him. Henry and White Fang continued traveling, and Henry stepped in a trap, and there was the man, with his rifle, he aimed at Henry with his gun, then suddenly, Lilly saw him and the guy, she made fire as fast as she could, and put her arrow on the fire, and aimed her bow with the arrow with fire, and hit the man. The man ran away, and his hiding area explode. Lilly pulled the rope and removed Henry. They continued traveling with White Fang. And then they were already at the final destination. Henry saw the path that blocks the animals. They went back and, they accidentally fell into a hole, which led them to the mining area. They quietly walked and hide from the miners. There was a guard guarding, and he suddenly heard a sound. He wondered what was there and Lilly shouted, and Henry hit him. They get the dynamite that will open the path that blocks the animals. Then they saw Reverend Leland Drury and the miners working. Henry shot him, and Reverend Leland Drury ordered his miners to catch him. Henry and Lilly ran. Henry saw an exit, but Lilly was caught by the miners, Lilly let Henry go. Then Henry saw White Fang. He guards him against Reverend Leland Drury's men while he plants the dynamite to the path. The path exploded!! The animals were free.\n\nReverend Leland Drury ordered his men to get the girl. Henry and White Fang ran, and they saw Lilly with Reverend Leland Drury. White Fang jumped and attacked Reverend Leland Drury, while Henry jumped in order to save Lilly. Henry untied Lilly, and when the screw combining the horses and the thing Reverend Leland Drury and Lilly riding on was removed, it separated it and the thing Lilly and Henry were riding on fell into a cliff then they both jumped off. Reverend Leland Drury, who already climbed the cliff where he also fell, was shocked when he saw the animals running. He was trampled to death by that group of animals.\n\nHenry and Lilly went into where White Fang fell. They saw him weak. They carried him and returned to the village. They saw Lilly's parents. Moses went to Lilly and Henry with the weak White Fang. Henry ran towards Lilly's mother, with Peter, who died.\n\nAfter the hunt, Lilly and Joseph went to the forest, and Lilly gave Henry his gold and said Henry can leave now. Lilly walked through the village. Henry, arranging his things, talked with Moses. The village thanked him. When Henry was ready to go with White Fang, Lilly wore the white cloth that Henry gave him and ran towards him. She shouted \"White Wolf!!\" Henry ran towards her. Lilly said, \"I choose you\". Then she hugged him. After that Lilly kissed him. And White Fang's female wolf friend was there. White Fang ran towards her. Like what Henry and Lilly did, she also kissed him and hugged him.\n\nThree months later, White Fang and the wolf had many puppies.
