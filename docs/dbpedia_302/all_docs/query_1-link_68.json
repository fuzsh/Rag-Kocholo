        "text": "Like most animation purists, I have been pretty bummed out over the decline of traditional hand-drawn style feature films this last decade. In 2009, a glimmer of hope entered my radar with the discovery of the teaser for White Fang, a French animated adaptation of Jack London's classic novel of the same name. The quality of the visuals brought back for me fond memories of the glory years at Disney. However, my hopes were crushed when I soon learned that the studio producing the film had been closed down.\n\nFortunately, the project is still alive and we now have a poster and the first image via the new production company Superprod. Dominique Monfery, a former supervising animator at Disney and the director of Eleanor's Secret, has taken the helm of the film and the release date has been set during the winter of 2014. You'll find the poster and full size image and the earlier 2009 teaser trailer below. We'll keep you posted as more details on the project arrive.\n\nInspired by the novel of Jack London, White Fang is a story about redemption or how a wolfhound caught in a spiral of violence, becomes, in spite of himself, a legend dreaded and feared to then return to his true nature guided by a couple of humans.\n\nHalf-wolf from his father and half-dog from his mother, the life of White-Fang is finely tuned into the laws of nature from an early age. The disappearance of his father and the famine that follows, teaches him the uncertainties of existence. As a wolf-cub, he is brought face to face with the grandeur and danger of Mother Nature that he learns to master step by step.\n\nMeeting an Indian tribe opens the door of a new world that White Fang quickly adapts to. The world of men, nonetheless, holds for White Fang a danger more insidious than anything he has ever experienced in the Great North. His adoption launches a rampage of jealousy and vindictiveness from the other dogs of the tribe. This rejection and hatred will forever mark White Fang.\n\nLater, civilization and its vices take hold of White Fang when his Indian master sales him to a greedy and despicable white man. His new owner abuses White Fang to increase and fuel the dog's rage prior to dog fights that he secretly organizes. Kill or be killed, now White Fang must unleash his anger against his victims for his own survival.\n\nWhite Fang will owe his salvation to a man of integrity who will provide him the opportunity to prove his loyalty and his real nature.\n\nDo you feel this content is inappropriate or infringes upon your rights?
