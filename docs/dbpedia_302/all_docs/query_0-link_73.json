        "text": "Last Modified: 2024-03-22 14:20:00\n\nRedirected from White Fang\n\n1. Jack London 's novel\n\nA 1906 novel by Jack London , a writer of realism who wrote novels such as Call of the Wild and Boots of Steel , and the name of the wolf , the main character in the novel . In Korea, the name White Tusk has been translated a lot. 1990's It was also published as one of the <International Edition World Masterpieces> series from Gyeemongsa . As with other novels in the series, the realistic illustrations are quite enjoyable.\n\nIt is a story in which a wild wolf living in the wilderness gradually loses its wildness and becomes tamed through interactions with humans. content.\n\nThe harsh wild life, its cruelty and the horrors of survival were described extremely realistically with the artist's unique handwriting. However, since it is a novel, it is not without academic errors.\n\n1.1. media mix\n\nIt has also appeared in movies several times. Lucio Fulci, an Italian film director who has made several silent black-and-white films since 1925 and is famous for giallo horror films such as Beyond , directed the 1973 version of the film, which was a box office hit overseas. Misha, an indigenous child who did not appear in the original work, appears as the main character, takes care of White Fang and becomes friends with him. This movie was a hit in Japan as well, so in 1982, the Japanese animation White Fang Story was made based on this movie, with Misha as the main character. In 1974, Lucio Fulci made a sequel to this film called Challenge to White Fang, which was also a success, but it was also an original film that had nothing to do with the original White Fang. Before the 1979 movie Zombie 2, Lucio Fulci was a director who made a variety of action, thriller, and all-age films, but after the huge success of Zombie 2, he switched to giallo horror and only directed this genre until his death.\n\nThere is also a 70-minute TV special aired Japanese animation made by Studio Dean that aired in 1982. The White Fang Story . The first few minutes talk about two people being chased by a pack of wolves like in the original work, but based on the 1973 Italian, German, and French joint film, Misha, a native child who was not in the original, develops friendship while taking care of a young White Fang. Yasuhiko Yoshikazu took over the character design.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures produced a live-action film of the same name in 1991 based on this novel, but in Korea, it was released as Wolf Dog , and the book with this title came out again, causing confusion between wolf dogs and white tusks. Ethan Hawke portrayed the main character, Jack. There is also a sequel (White Fang 2: Myth Of The White Wolf), but the characters have changed. The movie released in Korea as Werewolf 2 is not an official sequel, and the original title is Iron Will. Actually, Wolf Dog 2 came out as a video titled Wolf Dog 3 in Korea. In 2018, it was released as a 3D animated film on Netflix .\n\n2. mass media\n\n2.1. Forces appearing in New Mobile Report Gundam W\n\nAn organization founded by Kangzie , a person called the right-hand man of Heiro Yui , who brought the colonies together as the leader of the colonies in the past .\n\nAs the forerunner of the colony independence movement organization that existed 20 years ago, when the Rompeller Foundation overthrew Trez Ksurinada and turned the colony policy into a line of de facto military suppression, in AC 195, the remnants of the old allied forces or OZ ( Oz ) They rallied Trezpa and others to raise an uprising. Although it was an underground organization, it boasted a large scale in terms of personnel and equipment, but it had many problems with cohesion, ideology, and loyalty because it was an organization that was improvised by combining several organizations.\n\nAppearing later in the story, he activates Artemis Revolution , arrests new recruits from OZ Space Force Commander Zbarov Vilmon, and at the same time takes control of OZ's Lunar Base as well as OZ's space battleship Libra , which was under construction. However, since he was also a ragtag person, he needed a person with strong charisma and leadership to lead it, and Kangzie, who actually organized the White Fang, made Millardo Peacecraft, who had lost his energy and wandered after the Battle of Shank Kingdom, as the leader and symbolic presence of the organization . attract to\n\nThis is because Millardo, who is called OZ's Lightning Counter and the only pilot who fought on equal footing with Gundam, reigned as a legendary existence in OZ both as an MS pilot and as a soldier. It was considered that the political position that he had, and that he was the legitimate son of Shank Kingdom, was not enough to unite White Fang. Milardo, who appeared on the forefront of history as the leader of the White Fang by counteracting Kang's proposal and the uprising of the colony armed forces, declares the exclusion of Earth, the absolute strongest, and declares war on the nations of the world. At this time, it seems that Kangz originally intended to make Milardo a formal leader, but no matter how you look at it, Kangz was swayed by Milardo.\n\nAfterwards, it confronted the World Alliance of Nations through a great war represented by the Battle of Libra . After losing Trez Ksurinada, the World Alliance of Nations surrenders and White Fang wins the battle, but Milardo does not give up on the fall of Libra and the exclusion of Earth until the end. However, Libra's main gun was silenced by 5 scientists, and the MD control room was destroyed by Cator Lavava Winner, all MD functions stopped, and White Fang's combat capability was also substantially lost. At this time, White Fang's second-in-command, Dorothy Catalonia, was also defeated by the Gundam pilot, and Kangz, who organized White Fang and assisted Milardo, was also caught up in the Libra explosion and went missing. In the end, Millardo, who wanted to die in the fight against Yui Heero , also explodes Libra's power core and disappears in the heat wave.\n\nIn the end, it seems that White Fang was destroyed due to the loss of fighting ability of White Fang, the peace negotiations with the world countries of the colony side, which should have been the winner of this war, and the disappearance of leader Millardo Peacecraft, deputy commander Dorothy Catalonia, and Kanze. However, since White Fang was born into a resistance, resistance group, and guerrilla alliance, some of White Fang's remaining forces spread the embers of war, such as trying to steal the Gundam or resisting the unified nation of the Earth Sphere, and among them, they went to the Mari Mayer Army. Those who participate also appear. However, the Marie Mayer Incident failed, and it seems that the remaining forces of the White Fang collapsed one after another due to the preventer 's secret strategy.\n\nAt the time of the uprising, OZ's mass production machine was mainly used, and after Artemis Revolution, MD Virgo and Virgo II seized from the lunar base were mainly used. The leader, Miliardo Peacecraft, has redesigned a tactical program to overcome MD's fundamental weakness, and also operates MD by applying the Epion system to bring out MD's organic mobility and potential.\n\n2.2. The Fighting 's Boxing Techniques\n\nRussian boxer Alexander Bolg Zangiev 's finish blow.\n\nLeft upper and chopping right to opponent's head [1] It is a high-speed combination that fires almost simultaneously, and it is similar to the shape of a wolf biting, so it was named White Fang. [2] To be precise, the left upper that strikes upward is expressed as a wolf's fang, and the right hook that strikes down is expressed as a wolf's fang. It was said that a player's life could be ended if it was hit with a straight hit because it had the power to shake the opponent's brain up and down, but none of the players who were hit with this reached the end of their life (...). Still, it's clear that it's a skill that can KO most enemies if you hit it right, so it's clear that it's very threatening.\n\nThe biggest advantage of this technique is that it is difficult to defend rather than power . Compared to the fact that most finishers are single punches, [3] Since this technique involves launching two punches with opposite directions of attack at high speed, it is practically necessary to block attacks from both directions at the same time. In the above, it was said that the brain shakes up and down when a combination is hit with a straight hit, but in fact, there are very few cases where a boxer of a level that can compete with Bolg hits both punches. Usually, like a one-two punch, the left upper is first thrown as bait, and when the upper and left defenses are weak due to the opponent blocking the upper, the right hook is blasted with a clean hit to KO. Ilbo and Sendo also said that if you try to block the left, the right will explode, and if you only care about the right, the left will fly in, making it a really difficult technique to block or avoid. For reference, during the Bolg vs. Sendo match, Sendo wondered if his foot slipped when White Fang was cast, anyway, while leaning against the ring, he stumbled backwards to avoid it, and then boasted to Connor, saying, \"Have you seen White Fang break?\"\n\nIt's obvious, but it's not an invincible skill. The vertical combination of the left upper-right hook is tricky, but if you think about it simply, defend the left upper and counter the right hook. However, it is difficult to get used to because it is a vertical continuous hit compared to horizontal consecutive hits such as hooks and straights, and Bolg's hand speed is so transcendent that it is difficult. In the work, this is the method that Mike Elliott, Bolg's title match opponent, showed , and it seems possible that other boxers who are almost certain to have at least equal or higher skills to Bolg can fight in a sufficiently similar way. Ilbo also showed the appearance of avoiding both attacks in the second half when Bolg's stamina was low (...).\n\nChansung Jung Lee Ed used a similar combination before. # There is destructive power with the punch that made the match win.\n\nFor reference, Bolg, who became the IBF Junior Lightweight Champion, formed a professional coaching team with friends he made in Chinatown, and named it \"White Fang.\"\n\n2.3. Factions in RWBY\n\nmore detailsWhite Fang (RWBY) document\n\ncast\n\nof number of paragraphs\n\nPlease note.\n\n2.4. Monsters from Maplestory\n\n[1] A hook that strikes obliquely from top to bottom.[2] In the Korean version, it is translated as \"white wolf\". 'Iri' is a pure Korean word for wolf, and it is a translation that subtly goes well with the feeling of Japanese and English so that it does not die.[3] Such as Sendo's Smash, Date's Heart Break Shot , Kimura's Dragon Fish Blow , and Miyata's Counter. Ilbo's exceptional move, the Dempsey Roll , is a combination of dozens of punches and body work. Mamoru's heavyweight boxers seem to fight with natural punching power and physicality without special moves.\n\nThis document is available under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 KR.
