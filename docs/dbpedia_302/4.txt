Characters

Among the many characters in Jack London’s novel, White Fang stands out as the central protagonist. Although he is a dog, White Fang seems to have more in common with a wolf than any other animal in the book. His ability to survive is impressive, and he seems to have more in common with his mother Kiche than his siblings.

During the famine, all of the other dogs die, leaving White Fang alone. During the time he is alone, he learns to kill and to survive. He also learns to obey his master.

White Fang’s first master is a neutral Indian named Gray Beaver. He doesn’t express any kind of love towards his dog, but he defends him when he’s satisfied. He also doesn’t seem to fear the humans around him.

Storyline

Having a dog named White Fang is a good way to get into the White Fang storyline. White Fang is the son of a wolf and a dog. He was born and raised in the wilderness. He grows up to be a vicious and dangerous dog.

White Fang starts out as a cute little pup. He is a gray wolf cub. He is also the feisty pup of his litter. The pup is a great example of the “survival of the fittest” theme of the book.

The pup is named White Fang after his fangs. He is three quarters wolf and one quarter husky. The wolf-dog hybrid is more active than the others. He has to learn how to protect himself from the other pups. He also has to learn how to behave in the presence of Indians.
