Half dog, half wolf White Fang was born in the Canadian North. Guided by instinct, it will then go to meet men and live many adventures, bumping into civilization and the different aspects of human beings: the cruelty or greed on the one hand, but also the confidence and friendship other hand ... So it will befriend the young Wendy Scott, a child full of enthusiasm and only daughter of Weedon Scott, a journalist of "the Bugle". In Dawson City, you can also count on Bella O'Brien who runs a hotel on Sergeant Oakes and especially Raven Moon, an Indian living alone in the forest and always gives good advice. Wendy and White Fang will often have to face Alex De Laszlo (Duke of Dawson) and Beauty Smith, a not very smart character always accompanied by his bulldog Jack.

FilmFair, at the time a division of the Storm Group, produced this animated television series for the Canadian pay television channel Family, which transmitted it from 1992–94; HBO later transmitted it in the United States. Canadian writer Pierre Berton was a history consultant to the series.
