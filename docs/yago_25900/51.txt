Isabella of Bavaria (born 1371—died September 1435, Paris) was the queen consort of Charles VI of France, who frequently was regent because of her husband’s periodic insanity. Her gravest political act was the signing of the Treaty of Troyes (May 21, 1420), which recognized King Henry V of England as heir to the French crown in place of her son Charles (afterward Charles VII), who was to be exiled from France.

The daughter of Stephen III, duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, she was married to Charles VI on July 17, 1385. Her husband’s first severe attack of insanity (Aug. 5, 1392) caused her great distress; for years she sought remedies, both medical and supernatural. She bore the King six children between 1393 and 1403, but, as his illness grew worse, his rebuffs (he occasionally did not recognize her) drove her into flagrant sexual misconduct. Her brother-in-law, Louis, duc d’ Orléans, became her constant companion, though it has not been proved that he was her lover. After the murder of Orléans (1407) she relied on John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy, who rescued her from imprisonment by her son, the dauphin Charles (1417), and with her set up governments, at Chartres and then at Troyes, that rivalled the administration at Paris.
