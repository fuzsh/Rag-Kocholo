        "text": "On this date in history cam the death of Rudolf I, King of the Germans, King of the Romans..”Holy Roman Emperor,” Although technically he did not hold the imperial title he is counted as one of the Holy Roman Emperors.\n\nIn this blog entry I will examine his rise to power and title as German King.\n\nRudolf I (May 1, 1218 – July 15, 1291) was the first German King from the House of Habsburg. The first of the count-kings of Germany, he reigned from 1273 until his death.\n\nRudolf’s election marked the end of the Great Interregnum which had begun after the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Friedrich II in 1250. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria in opposition to his mighty rival, the Přemyslid King Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. The territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg Monarchy and the present-day country of Austria. Rudolf played a vital role in raising the comital House of Habsburg to the rank of Imperial princes.\n\nEarly life\n\nRudolf was born on May 1, 1218 at Limburgh Castle near Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in the Breisgau region of present-day southwestern Germany. He was the son of Count Albert IV of Habsburg and of Hedwig of Kyburg, daughter of Count Ulrich of Kyburg. Around 1232, he was given as a squire to his uncle, Rudolf I, Count of Laufenburg, to train in knightly pursuits.\n\nCount of Habsburg\n\nAt his father’s death in 1239, Rudolf inherited from him large estates around the ancestral seat of Habsburg Castle in the Aargau region of present-day Switzerland as well as in Alsace.\n\nGreat Interregnum\n\nThe term Great Interregnum is used for the period between 1250 (the death of Friedrich II) and 1273 (the accession of Rudolf I).\n\nAfter the deposition of Emperor Friedrich II by Pope Innocent IV in 1245, Heinrich Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia was set up as anti-king to Friedrich’s son Conrad IV (d. 1254). Heinrich Raspe was killed in 1247 and succeeded as anti-king by Willem II of Holland (died 1256). After 1257, the crown was contested between Richard of Cornwall, who was supported by the Guelph party, and Alfonso X of Castile, who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. Richard of Cornwall was the second son of John, King of England, and one of the wealthiest men in Europe. After Richard’s death in 1273, Rudolf I of Germany, a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the Habsburgs to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf’s death in 1291, Adolf and Albert were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAs mentioned, Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors Adolf and Albert. The next emperor was Heinrich VII, crowned on June 29, 1312 by Pope Clement V. Not receiving the imperial title was unusual bot not unprecedented. Several rulers were crowned king of the Romans (king of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, and are counted among the Holy Roman Emperors, among whom were: Conrad I and Hienrich I the Fowler in the 10th century, and Conrad IV, Rudolf I, Adolf and Albert I during the aforementioned Great Interregnum of the late 13th century.\n\nThe disorder in Germany during the interregnum after the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty afforded an opportunity for Count Rudolf to increase his possessions. His wife was a Hohenberg heiress. Rudolf was married twice. First, in 1251, to Gertrude of Hohenberg and second, in 1284, to Isabelle of Burgundy. All children were from the first marriage.\n\nGertrude was born in Deilingen, Swabia to Count Burkhard V of Hohenberg (died 1253) and his wife Matilda (Mechtild), daughter of Count Palatine Rudolf II of Tübingen. The comital Hohenberg dynasty, a cadet branch of the Swabian House of Hohenzollern, then ruled over extended estates in southwestern Germany. Isabella of Burgundy (1270 – August 1323), Lady of Vieux-Château, was the second and last Queen consort of Rudolf I of Germany.\n\nOn the death of his childless maternal uncle Count Hartmann IV of Kyburg in 1264, Rudolf seized Hartmann’s valuable estates. Successful feuds with the Bishops of Strasbourg and Basel further augmented his wealth and reputation, including rights over various tracts of land that he purchased from abbots and others.\n\nThese various sources of wealth and influence rendered Rudolf the most powerful prince and noble in southwestern Germany (where the tribal Duchy of Swabia had disintegrated, enabling its vassals to become completely independent). In the autumn of 1273, the prince-electors met to choose a king after Richard of Cornwall had died in England in April 1272. Rudolf’s election in Frankfurt on October 1, 1273, when he was 55 years old, was largely due to the efforts of his brother-in-law, the Hohenzollern burgrave Friedrich III of Nuremberg. The support of Duke Albert II of Saxony and Elector Palatine Ludwig II had been purchased by betrothing them to two of Rudolf’s daughters.\n\nAs a result, within the electoral college, King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1230–1278), himself a candidate for the throne and related to the late Hohenstaufen king Philipp of Swabia (being the son of the eldest surviving daughter), was almost alone in opposing Rudolf. Other candidates were Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt and Margrave Friedrich I of Meissen (1257–1323), a young grandson of the excommunicated Emperor Friedrich II, who did not yet even have a principality of his own as his father was still alive. By the admission of Duke Hienrich XIII of Lower Bavaria instead of the King of Bohemia as the seventh Elector, Rudolf gained all seven votes.\n\nKing of the Germans\n\nRudolf was crowned in Aachen Cathedral on October 24, 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolf renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade. Pope Gregory X, despite the protests of Ottokar II of Bohemia, not only recognised Rudolf himself, but persuaded King Alfonso X of Castile (another grandson of Philipp of Swabia), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count Willem II of Holland, to do the same. Thus, Rudolf surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty whom he had earlier served so loyally.\n\nRudolf died in Speyer on 15 July 1291 and was buried in Speyer Cathedral. Although he had a large family, he was survived by only one son, Albert I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Catherine who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.\n\nRudolf’s reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of Imperial authority since the days of the Investiture Controversy continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy, Dante finds Rudolf sitting outside the gates of purgatory with his contemporaries, characterizing him as “he who neglected that which he ought to have done”.\n\nKing of the Germans\n\nRudolf was crowned in Aachen Cathedral on October 24, 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolf renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade. Pope Gregory X, despite the protests of Ottokar II of Bohemia, not only recognised Rudolf himself, but persuaded King Alfonso X of Castile (another grandson of Philip of Swabia), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count Willem II of Holland, to do the same. Thus, Rudolf surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty whom he had earlier served so loyally.\n\nIn November 1274, the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg decided that all Crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Friedrich II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia together with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden.\n\nRudolf refuted Ottokar’s succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs. King Ottokar was placed under the imperial ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.\n\nHaving persuaded Ottokar’s former ally Duke Heinrich XIII of Lower Bavaria to switch sides, Rudolf compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the Kingdom of Bohemia, betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar’s son Wenceslaus II, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna.\n\nOttokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Heinrich XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolf formed an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and gave additional privileges to the Viennese citizens. On August 26, 1278, the rival armies met at the Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The Margraviate of Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolf’s representatives, leaving Ottokar’s widow Kunigunda of Slavonia in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolf’s youngest daughter Judith.\n\nRudolf’s attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length the hostility of the princes was overcome.\n\nCoat of Arms of Rudolf as King of Germany\n\nIn December 1282, at the Hoftag (imperial diet) in Augsburg, Rudolf invested his sons, Albrecht and Rudolf II, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolf Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since Conradin’s execution.[citation needed] The 27-year-old Duke Albrecht, married since 1274 to a daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol (1238–95), was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.\n\nIn 1286, King Rudolf fully invested Albert’s father-in-law Count Meinhard with the Duchy of Carinthia, one of the conquered provinces taken from Ottokar. The Princes of the Empire did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too.\n\nTurning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count Philip I of Savoy to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of Bern to pay the tribute that they had been refusing. In 1289 he marched against Count Philip’s successor, Otto IV, compelling him to do homage.\n\nIn 1281, Rudolf’s first wife died. On February 5, 1284, he married Isabella, daughter of Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy, the Empire’s western neighbor in the Kingdom of France.\n\nRudolf was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of landpeaces in Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and afterwards for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, and determination to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into Thuringia, where he destroyed a number of robber castles.\n\nIsabella of Burgundy\n\nIn 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. The electors refused, however, claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, wary of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolf’s death they elected Count Adolf of Nassau.\n\nDeath\n\nRudolf died in Speyer on July 15, 1291 and was buried in Speyer Cathedral. Although he had a large family, he was survived by only one son, Albrecht, afterwards the German king Albrecht I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Katharina who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.\n\nRudolf’s reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of Imperial authority since the days of the Investiture Controversy continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.\n\nRudolf’s last legitimate agnatic descendant was Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress (1717–1780), by Albrecht I of Germany’s fourth son Albrecht II, Duke of Austria."
