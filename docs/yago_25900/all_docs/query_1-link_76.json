        "text": "8/18: Sunday Morning\n\nHosted by Jane Pauley. In our cover story, Robert Costa previews this week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Also: David Martin talks with former national security adviser H.R. McMaster about his 13 months working in the Trump White House; Nancy Giles profiles actress Carol Kane, now starring in the film “Between the Temples”; Lesley Stahl interviews novelist Carl Hiaasen, whose bestseller “Bad Monkey” is now an Apple TV+ series; Ted Koppel examines why coal miners in Appalachia are suffering from black lung disease at increasingly younger ages; Tracy Smith talks with artist Mickalene Thomas, subject of a new exhibition in Los Angeles; and Conor Knighton looks at efforts to protect and rescue wild donkeys.\n\n01:02:41\n\nLatest Videos\n\nA preview of the Democrats' convention in Chicago\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be gaveled into session this Monday in Chicago, a city with a long, sometimes controversial history of Democratic nominating conventions. Longtime party figure and native Chicagoan Bill Daley offers CBS News chief election & campaign correspondent Robert Costa a message to his fellow Democrats about the prospects of the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket come Election Day. [Watch CBS News' live anchored coverage starting Monday, August 19 at 5:00 p.m. ET, streaming on CBS News 24/7, Paramount+ and Pluto TV, with primetime coverage from 8:00-11:00 p.m. ET on CBS.]\n\n05:28\n\nGiving wild donkeys a new life\n\nOriginally from Africa, donkeys (or burros, in Spanish) have been in North America for centuries. They were work animals that helped build the West, and today there are thousands of free-roaming donkeys on public lands, where they can overgraze and threaten delicate ecosystems. Correspondent Conor Knighton looks at efforts (such as adoption programs for wild and domestic burros) aimed at giving these social animals a better life.\n\n05:38\n\nYoung coal miners suffering from black lung\n\nCoal mining has always been a dangerous job, with one in every five miners ending up with \"black lung\" disease. But today, in Appalachia, miners are suffering from black lung at increasingly younger ages. \"Sunday Morning\" senior contributor Ted Koppel talks with miners and union officials who say coal companies routinely break the rules that could help protect their employees' health; and looks at a new government proposal that might offer real protection for miners, but which is facing opposition in Congress. (This story was originally broadcast December 10, 2023.)\n\n12:14\n\nThe distinctive voices of Carol Kane\n\nIn her latest film, \"Between the Temples,\" Oscar-nominated actress Carol Kane plays a retired music teacher who is determined to be bat mitzvahed. Kane talks with correspondent Nancy Giles about how her own mother inspired her character; how Andy Kaufman taught her the \"language\" that their characters, Latka and Simka, spoke on the TV series \"Taxi\"; and how, as a student, she resisted the opinion of a doctor who said she should never set foot on stage.\n\n07:20\n\nAuthor Carl Hiaasen on his love for Florida\n\nFlorida native Carl Hiaasen has written about his beloved state in a series of bestselling comedic novels that target the darkness which can cloud the Sunshine State. \"60 Minutes' correspondent Lesley Stahl talks with Hiaasen about his love affair with Florida; and visits the Florida Keys location of \"Bad Monkey,\" a new Apple TV+ series adapted from Hiaasen's 2013 bestseller about a failed detective, murder, and a misbehaving monkey.\n\n08:25\n\nThe art of Mickalene Thomas\n\nIn college Mickalene Thomas studied pre-law because she wanted to change the world. But then she saw an exhibition of photographs by Carrie Mae Weems, and she knew then what she wanted to do. The 53-year-old artist, who creates pieces celebrating women, is now being featured in an exhibition at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles titled \"Mickalene Thomas: All About Love.\" Correspondent Tracy Smith talks with Thomas about her muses and her mixing of media, from collage and silkscreen to rhinestones.\n\n05:34\n\nH.R. McMaster on 13 months working for Trump\n\nIn his new book, \"At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,\" retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster discusses the 13 months he served as national security adviser in the White House before former President Donald Trump fired him. McMaster talks with CBS News national security correspondent David Martin about working in a White House where \"everything was much harder than it needed to be\"; about Trump's attraction to the qualities of autocrats; and how he participated in an intervention to prevent Trump from threatening fellow members of NATO.\n\n07:20\n\nPhotographer Russell Lee's testament to coal miners\n\nWhen coal was king, coal miners risked their lives to fuel America. Photographer Russell Lee captured the hardships and privations (as well as moments of joy) in America's mining communities in the mid-1940s. His pictures are now on display at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., in an exhibit titled \"Power & Light: Russell Lee's Coal Survey.\" \"Sunday Morning\" host Jane Pauley offers us a tour.\n\n02:49\n\nPresident Biden on ending reelection bid, and defeating Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden sits down with CBS News chief election & campaign correspondent Robert Costa for his first interview since announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race. He talks about dropping his bid for reelection; his support of the Harris-Walz ticket; and what he sees as the threat posed to democracy if former President Donald Trump is successful in regaining the White House.\n\n12:01\n\nPost Malone on success, acceptance, and his new country album\n\nHe's one of the biggest pop stars in the world, yet Post Malone's new album, \"F-1 Trillion,\" features his duets with some of the biggest names in country, including Luke Combs, Blake Shelton, Morgan Wallen and Dolly Parton. Correspondent Anthony Mason visits Malone in Nashville to talk about his acceptance among country music fans; how he dealt with being called a \"one-hit wonder\" following his debut with the 2015 hip hop smash \"White Iverson\"; and how he recovered from a downward spiral that he experienced in the midst of his success.\n\n07:49\n\nCrocheting magical gifts for special patients\n\nHolly Christensen, a former oncology nurse, saw how much joy could be brought to young cancer patients and their families when she made a Rapunzel wig out of soft yarn for a friend's daughter undergoing chemotherapy. What began in 2015 as a thoughtful gift has since spun into a national non-profit, the Magic Yarn Project. Volunteers at 10 chapters nationwide transform yarn into character wigs for kids with cancer (or any child dealing with medical hair loss). Correspondent Serena Altschul reports.\n\n05:02\n\nSutton Foster & Carol Burnett: Musical comedy royalty\n\nIn 1959 an unknown named Carol Burnett burst onto the New York stage in the musical comedy \"Once Upon a Mattress.\" Now, two-time Tony-winning star Sutton Foster is recreating the role of Princess Winnifred, a princess in search of a suitable mate, in the new Broadway revival. Correspondent Tracy Smith talks with Burnett and Foster about the power of fairy tales – from the theatrical kind to real life.\n\n07:32\n\nJames Baldwin at 100\n\nA century after his birth in Harlem, the writer and activist James Baldwin is being celebrated for his visionary work, and for the many facets of his personality – Black, gay, playwright, essayist, New Yorker, expatriate – that transformed him into an iconic figure in the civil rights movement, even beyond his death in 1987 at age 63. \"Sunday Morning\" contributor Kelefa Sanneh looks back at the author of such noted works as \"Notes of a Native Son,\" \"The Fire Next Time,\" and \"Giovanni's Room.\"\n\n05:15\n\nPresident Biden on the stakes of this election\n\nIn his first interview since withdrawing from the race, the president reflects on his decision to end his bid for reelection; and what he says is the importance of defeating Trump to protect democracy.\n\nProfiles\n\nThe distinctive voices of Carol Kane\n\nIn her latest film, \"Between the Temples,\" Oscar-nominated actress Carol Kane plays a retired music teacher who is determined to be bat mitzvahed.
