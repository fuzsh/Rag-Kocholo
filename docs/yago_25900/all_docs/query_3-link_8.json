        "text": "Princess Margaret of Burgundy was the wife of Prince Louis and the future Queen of France. She arrived in Paris upon learning of her husband's return and her mother-in-law, Joan's death.\n\nMargaret moved into the Palace and spent time with Isabella, unaware that the French Princess was secretly planning to bring her downfall for a comment she meant to be comforting that Isabella took as patronizing.\n\nDuring a dinner with Isabella, Margaret was drugged and raped by Isabella's lovers, Gautier and Philippe, framing her for adultery. King Philip then had her locked away in a tower where she eventually killed herself.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMargaret of Burgundy was a kind, caring and loving woman and wife to her husband, Louis. She was also kind and respectful to Louis's family upon moving into the Palace.\n\nShe was also very moral, proven when she was horrified by Lydia revealing that Louis had murdered her husband and infant son and also called Philip a monster for having her unjustly imprisoned. She was willing to confront Louis concerning what Lydia had said, deeply shaken by the revelation, but she still loved him as her husband.\n\nShe was unaware of the darker nature of the royal family, never suspecting her husband to be such a remorseless killer, King Philip to have Lydia unjustly imprisoned or the fact that Isabella was secretly planning her downfall. This came back to bite her when she was drugged by Isabella and framed as an adulterer."
