        "text": "Hmm, let's think, Isabella became the heiress of Spain in 1468, according to the treaty of the Bulls of Guisando. At the same time she became the most attractive bacheleress in Europe. The Portuguese prince Joao was only 13 at the time. Isabella's halfbrother Henry IV had tried to marry his daughter Joan to the Portuguese king Alfonso V. The pope had however annulled this marriage because he did not approve a marriage between close relatives (Alfonso was Joan's uncle and besides Joan was just a little child at the moment). The portuguese king is a widower, but has a son. Isabella's brother could of course marry her of to him, since that would be a strike against the Castillan nobility, who was supporting Isabella. With Alfonso already having a son (Joao) there would be no chance of Isabella's heirs to get the Portuguese throne, and suddenly Isabella would not be as attractive as queen of Castille anymore. Perhaps Henry IV would get a chance to annull the treaty of the Bulls of Guisando, and get his daughter Joan to be the heriess of Castille.\n\nHowever let's say Henry won't make such a move. He still dreamed of having nhis daughter Joan marry Alfonso. In 1474 Henry died, Joan, only 12 year old moved to Lisbon, and in 1475, when she was 13 she married he uncle, who swore to restore the Castillan throne from her aunt Isabella. If Isabella still in 1475 is unmarried it's time for her to find a husband. The pope annulled Joan's and Alfonso's marriage IRL because of pressure from Ferdinand and Isabella. Now there is perhaps no such pressure, and Alfonso and Joan is a threat to Isabella. Also there might be plans to marry Joao to Isabella at this time, Joao would now be 20. However for Isabella a marriage to Joao at this point might as well be accepting as vassal relation with Alfonso and Joan. The Catillan nobility would perhaps not allow their queen to kneel for the Portuguese. She might seek support from the neighbouring Aragon-Burgundy, who in turn need support against the potential thrreat of France. However she would still need a husband. At this time Ferdinand was onlu ruling Aragon as a governor for his father John II, king of Navarra and Aragon. He was at this time 78 years old, not a ideal marriage, but perhaps necessary. At the age of 24, many of the princes of her own age would already be married. Then again she would probably get nothing, expect the promise of Ferdinand and Mary to protect her kingdom from the Portuguese, and the obligation to support Ferdinand and Mary against the French.\n\nStill I think Henry would have married Isabella of, at some point in 1469 or 1470, in hope of getting an alliance with another power, but with France not having any princes in her age, there would not be many good alternatives. However in 1470 the brother of Edward IV of England, Richard was still unmarried. Matching Isabella with Richard would be interresting, since who knows if his plans for taking the crown of England would have been affected by his marriage to the Castillan queen. He might not have killed his nephews, then again Isabella might have been dragged in to the endless battles over the English throne that raged in the late 1400s.\n\nOOC;I am again shamelesly repying my own post to keep the discussion goinig.\n\nIC; Let's say Isabella in 1475 is the unmarried queen of Castille. She has the Portuguese in the west, where her niece Juana is declared the rightful queen of Castille. In her east are the Aragonese, which would provide her with support if she submit to them, i.e. marry old king John and ally with them against France. Making France her enemy would be too daring move, and in 1475 Prince Joao was already married, so a deal with Portugal seemed impossible. Instead many nobles in secret started to support Juana, since her offspring with Alfonso V would not be heirs of the Portuguese throne, only the Castillan. In 1476 the Portuguese attacked Castille, with the support of some Castillan nobles. Isabella was forces to sign a treaty where she would accept Juana as the rightful queen and Juana's children as the heirs to the Castillan throne, the Galician territory would be annexed by Portugal, while Isabella would have to flee in exile. In exile she met the Habsburg prince Maximilian I, and married him in 1480. The Habsburgs saw this as an opportunity to lay claim on the Castillan throne. Isabella would give Maximilian some children, but she would die early (in 1488) and Maximilian then decided to remarry in 1492 when he married Bianca Maria Sforza, the daughter of the duke of Milan.\n\nThis would be a nice butterfly effect. We have a unstabel union between Aragon and Burgundy, as well as a somewhat weaker house of Habsburg and a huge Portuguese influence over Castille.\n\nWhy would Portugal try to seize Galicia when they never claimed it?\n\nThe goal would be another one, they could support the heiress to the Castillian throne: either Isabel or Juana and merge both kingdoms under the house of Avis. I think the movement is clear: the portuguese would back up one of the infantas and become kings of Portugal-Castille.\n\nRemember that IOTL the portuguese king was enraged when Ferdinand and Isabel started to use the term \"Spain\" for their dominions as it was thought even in Portugal that Spain (Hispania) was the term for the full peninsula. And that there was an strong feeling of unification in the Peninsular kingdoms. Add to that the fact that royal houses in those centuries did not think in the best for their nations, but in the best for them. The result is that the house of Avis finds itself in a unique situation to unify the whole peninsula under their rule. The first step would be to marry the heir with one of the infantas (Juana or Isabel), then join both crowns to get by far the stronger peninsular kingdom. You have an extremely weak Navarre in almost a civil war and a weak Aragon overstretched around France and having to defend territories very far away from each other. The result is a greedy house of Avis ruling in Castille and Portugal, looking at Aragon and Navarre and dreaming in the title of Rex Totius Hispaniae.\n\nI'm not convinced it gets this far. How does Isabella become queen without Aragonese support? Seems to me that it is more likely that Juana is queen, and Isabella has fled to Aragon or France. Perhaps she can drum up support there.\n\nOTL, the Castilian nobility openly supported Juana. Why is their support suddenly secret?\n\nPart of the nobility had supported her after her bother Alfonso's death. The treaty of the Bulls of Guisando 1468 forced Henry IV to accept Isabella as his heir, instead of Juana. That was before the Aragonese got involved. In any country the nobility better not openly oppose the regent, or bad things will happen. Even Juana's supporters IRL was careful about it, knowing very well the consequences of treason. In this scenario supporting Juana would mean supporting Portuguese dominance, Castille would end up as a Portuguese vassal, at least as long as Alfonso V was alive. I reckon there also would be a strong movement supporting the queen and the independence of Castille too. Fleeing to Aragon would not be an option, that would mean submiting to the Aragonese will and become a ally of Aragon against France. I am sure Castille at this point would not desire France as a enemy.\n\nSo Juana would probably marry the Portuguese king or his heir (it would be even better, because it would mean a union between Portugal and Castille). But could Isabella maybe marry someone from France or Navarre, as a way to have support for her claim? I think it would make more sense than marrying a distant Habsburg. There were any French of Navarrese princes available?\n\nYes, Juana could marry Joao. That would be better than her marrying Alfonso, but Joao was already married. He married in 1473, when Juana still was too young for marriage. Navarra was ruled by Ferdinand's father John II, an old widower after several marriages. The heir of Navarra was Ferdinand's half sister Eleanor. In France the only living son of Louis XI, the future Charles VIII is only 5 year-old. So there are no availiable princes in France or Navarra. Maximilian is not a bad choice either, already in the 1470s his father Frederick III had strengthened the Habsburg position in the HRE that it was hard to not make Maximilian emperor (although the throne was vacant 1493-1508 due to conflicts with the pope, Maximilian was the first emperor to not be crowned by the pope). The Habsburgs had lost their chance to become filthy rich in this scenario though, since they do not have the Burgundian posessions.\n\nYes, Juana could marry Joao.

The Habsburgs had lost their chance to become filthy rich in this scenario though, since they do not have the Burgundian posessions.\n\nThe problem that I can see with a Habsburg is that ITTL as they don't have the Burgundian lands they would probably seek a heiress with a good downry. Isabella would be a fugitive with only a chance of being the heir of Castille, and they wouldn't be sure of conquering it.\n\nAnd idea I've got was to have Isabella marrying John of Foix, or Diogo, Duke of Viseu (he ITTL was an enemy of John II of Portugal, and maybe Isabella could use it)."
