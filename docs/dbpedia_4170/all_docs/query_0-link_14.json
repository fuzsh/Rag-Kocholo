        "text": "American singer-songwriter\n\nMusical artist\n\nJames Andrew House (born March 22, 1955) is an American country music artist. Originally a member of a group called the House Band, he recorded a solo rock album in 1983 on Atlantic Records before he began his country music career in 1989 on MCA Records, recording two albums for that label. He later penned singles for Diamond Rio and Dwight Yoakam, before finding another record deal on Epic Records in 1994. That year, he charted two Top 40 singles on the Billboard country chart, including the Top 10 hit \"This Is Me Missing You\".\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nJames House's musical career began in a band called the House Band, which was signed first to Warner Bros. Records and later to Atlantic Records.[2] In addition, House served as vocal coach for Dustin Hoffman on the movie Ishtar.[2] In 1983, House recorded a rock album for Atlantic.[3]\n\nHouse later moved to Nashville and signed as a solo artist on MCA Nashville in 1989. On that label, he recorded two albums: James House and Hard Times for an Honest Man. The former accounted for \"Don't Quit Me Now\", a number 25 on the country charts, while the latter produced no Top 40 hits. House wrote seven of the ten songs on his first album.[4]\n\nIn 1990, House was slated to be a nominee for the Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year, but he didn't make the final three.[5]\n\nAfter exiting MCA, he co-wrote \"Ain't That Lonely Yet\" for Dwight Yoakam and \"In a Week or Two\" by Diamond Rio, both of which peaked at number 2 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in the early 1990s. By 1994, House had signed to Epic Records. His first album for that label, Days Gone By, was released that year, producing his highest-charting single in the top 10 \"This Is Me Missing You\". The album's title track, while not a single, was featured in the soundtrack for the movie The Cowboy Way.[6] In addition, the album featured collaborations with Raul Malo, Trisha Yearwood and Nikki Nelson.\n\nAlthough House never entered Top 40 on the country music charts again after \"This Is Me Missing You\", he made an appearance on The Beach Boys' album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, which featured re-recordings of Beach Boys songs with country music artists. He also continued to write songs for other artists. In late 1997, Martina McBride reached the top of the country charts with \"A Broken Wing\", which House co-wrote.[7] House also contributed three songs to Steve Holy's debut album Blue Moon. He also co-wrote six songs on Steve Azar's 2009 album Slide On Over Here, on which he also played acoustic guitar, percussion and sang backing vocals.[8] In 2012, House co-wrote The Mavericks' single \"Born to Be Blue\".[9]\n\nIn 2012, House formed the duo Troubadour Kings with John Brannen. Their debut album, Heartache Town, was released in June 2012.[10]\n\nIn 2022, MelodicRock Classics released The L.A. Tapes: Classic Rock Years including his 1983 self-titled debut as well as a second disc featuring soundtrack cuts.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Peak positions US Country US Heat James House\n\nRelease date: 1983\n\nLabel: Atlantic\n\n— — James House\n\nRelease date: 1989\n\nLabel: MCA\n\n— — Hard Times for an Honest Man\n\nRelease date: August 17, 1990\n\nLabel: MCA\n\n— — Days Gone By\n\nRelease date: January 17, 1995\n\nLabel: Epic\n\n48 19 Broken Glass Twisted Steel\n\nRelease date: April 29, 2014\n\nLabel: Victor House\n\n— — James House and the Blues Cowboys\n\nRelease date: August 3, 2018\n\nLabel: Victor House\n\n— — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Home, Vol. 1\n\nRelease date: March 3, 2009\n\nLabel: Dream On\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nAs lead artist\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single Peak positions Album US Country\n\n[1] CAN Country\n\n[11] 1983 \"Steal Your Love Away\"[12] — — James House (Atlantic) 1989 \"Don't Quit Me Now\" 25 — James House (MCA) \"That'll Be the Last Thing\" 52 78 \"Hard Times for an Honest Man\" 48 69 Hard Times for an Honest Man 1990 \"Southern Belles\" —[a] 76 \"You Just Get Better All the Time\" 60 — 1994 \"A Real Good Way to Wind Up Lonesome\" 52 79 Days Gone By 1995 \"Little by Little\" 25 27 \"This Is Me Missing You\" 6 10 \"Anything for Love\" 49 33 1996 \"Until You Set Me Free\" — 90 2009 \"I Love You Man\"[14] — — Non-album single 2014 \"Every Time It Rains\"[15] — — Broken Glass Twisted Steel \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nAs featured artist\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single Peak positions Album US Country\n\n[1] CAN Country\n\n[11] 1996 \"Little Deuce Coupe\"\n\n(The Beach Boys featuring James House) 69 41 Stars and Stripes Vol. 1\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Video Director 1989 \"Hard Times for an Honest Man\"[16] Bud Schaetzle 1990 \"You Just Get Better All the Time\" not available 1994 \"A Real Good Way to Wind Up Lonesome\"[17] Matti Leshem 1995 \"Little by Little\"[18] \"This Is Me Missing You\"[19] Steven Goldmann \"Anything for Love\"[20] 1996 \"Little Deuce Coupe\" (with The Beach Boys)[21] Jim Yukich 2014 \"Every Time It Rains\"[22] Marcel\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
