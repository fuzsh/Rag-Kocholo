        "text": "I’m not expecting to make any fans with this review - if anything, it feels like I’ve been set up to fail.\n\nAnd I’ve known this for a while: ever since Beyonce announced that she was making a ‘country’ album - the air quotes are very intentional and we’ll get to why in a moment - I knew the broader discourse was going to go into the toilet and take all the nuance with it, where it feels like there’s an obligation to stack up caveats in advance especially as I’ve been known to have some opinions on Beyonce’s albums that are not exactly in line with the mainstream norm, like Lemonade and 4 being her best records because they don’t lean into the perfect queen-diva iconography and instead hit the deeply flawed humanity I find compelling, and feeling that the self-titled album and Renaissance aren’t exactly the unimpeachable classics that certain folks want to make them out to be. That’s not saying that Beyonce isn’t a tremendous singer and live performer, or that she doesn’t work impressively hard to maintain that status… but I also understand she’s a better curator of iconography that serves her brand than a unique creator. It’s one of the reasons Renaissance bounced off me more than I wanted: I did the work to understand the sound and queer Black history from which Beyonce was pulling, but there was a decontextualization of what she was referencing to serve what she wanted, especially in the politics; certainly impressive, but when Special Interest put out Endure later that year and brought a house sound that was more ragged and rooted to the harsh global reality of those spaces, I wasn’t mesmerized.\n\nBut country is a different beast altogether: part of my reputation on YouTube is one of the few critics who consistently discusses country music, both mainstream and independent, I’ve got roots in this space, and I’ve been very willing to criticize it; see my last video essay. So it might surprise some of you when I say that not only did this not surprise me, I was looking forward to this album. The pump had already been primed with ‘Daddy Lessons’, which of course sparked its own truly frustrating brand of controversy when she performed it with The Chicks at the CMAs years ago, mostly because the backlash against her was flattened into pure racism by white country purists when there was more than that, because instead of actually making institutional changes to platform or elevate the Black country artists they already have, the CMAs would rather swing for the biggest mainstream crossover act for clickbait, propping up the traditional institution until they can find a way to get more cash and eyeballs and clickbait. Or to put it another way, I think it was a bad look for Alan Jackson to walk out of that performance - he’s a neotraditionalist to a fault, he doesn’t think Chris Stapleton is country but more southern soul, but ‘Daddy Lessons’ is way more country than the majority of what Music Row platforms - but in every statement he’s made about the industry and the utterly corrupt Nashville apparatus, including some stunts at the CMAs of his own, he’s often had a point.\n\nBut when the buzz starting circulating about COWBOY CARTER, I knew that Beyonce’s return to country as a genre was going to be loaded… and that’s not inherently a bad thing. The ultimate thematic framing of her grand artistic statements might frustrate me, but she and her team absolutely do their homework, and if Beyonce wants to further expand the profile of Black women in the history of country music, I consider that a huge net positive, especially for a pop audience that doesn’t know that history; there are so many different frames of reference to explore history, and critical race theory applied to the institution of American country music is incredibly valid! You could argue that the timing of this album is opportunistic given the explosion of mainstream country acts on the charts, but that doesn’t really matter to me - if Beyonce is on a journey to trace and reclaim her artistic roots, Texas country was always going to be a stop on that journey, and if she kept the tones warm and organic it could even be a huge boon to her, tap into a firepower I’ve wanted to hear more of since Lemonade! Granted, when I started hearing statement that this album wasn’t full country, more a ‘Beyonce album first’… well, I wasn’t surprised, especially with the two singles and their production, but I was a bit disappointed; it felt the requirement that a Beyonce album is an event was overshadowing sonic cohesion. I also wasn’t wild about the eighty minute runtime and some very obvious feature choices, but that’s not surprising either - she did that with Renaissance for better and for worse - so what did we get on COWBOY CARTER?\n\nSo albums like this can be difficult to discuss, partially because there’s a grand scale to COWBOY CARTER that demands to be considered simultaneously on multiple levels that often feel in tension with each other and openly confrontational with certain subsections of the audience. Part of this album wants to continue the riotous party of Renaissance, part of this album wants to showcase Beyonce’s knowledge and aptitude within country and all manner of southern Black music, from soul to blues to folk to country rap, and part of this album wants to take one’s conception of genre defined by the industry and shove it down everyone’s throat, carry all of it under her banner as Beyonce and fuck everyone who dare stand in her way. As such it can feel markedly more experimental and openly challenging than Renaissance was, calling back to older genres of music but blending and reframing them with a white-hot intensity, with the subtext being that if there is any act working today who can do this and then demand it be accepted or at least taken seriously by audience and industry alike, it’s Beyonce - more than ever, this is an album that leans on her performance, unquestionably the best part of this album and why I believe it works at all. At the same time, for an album that is so thorough in building its world in Beyonce’s image and shadow, if you dig even a little past the blinding glare - which a lot of folks will just refuse to do, because it’s uncomfortable work and exposes you to plenty of backlash, well-meaning and otherwise - and you’ll find a bloated, wildly inconsistent and compromised project that can neglect the execution to attempt to make its point, where self-awareness of the power of Beyonce and her brand becomes more revealing of what was chosen, and what was left out; in other words, I saw some folks on social media call this her Rattle & Hum to make a U2 comparison, and I don’t think that’s far amiss as well as being a very apt continuation of themes and questions I had with Renaissance, and while I like this more, I would struggle to say this is great or close to her best.\n\nBut for starters, as a gesture of goodwill, I want to start off with what I think works in spades, and that is Beyonce herself. One of my ongoing issues with Renaissance was her choice to lean on so much above-it-all house vamping, which didn’t really flatter her skillset as a singer, which led to a lingering feeling of disengagement that had me at a distance throughout most of that album; it felt like resting on laurels, indulging a queenly power fantasy, which as I said two years ago will absolutely work for her target audience but rarely does for me. COWBOY CARTER is different - you can tell there’s a raw intensity and edge that I loved so much on 4 and Lemonade that is here; you can tell she knows this will be a tougher sell to audiences who look sideways at country music, and you can tell just how hard she’s working to show that she cares, stacking up the harmonies to be as lush and robust as they’ve ever been. And that translates - somewhat - into the album’s sense of scale and the acknowledgement that this was not a cheap endeavor either; if your second song is a Beatles cover of ‘Blackbird’ - and for what it’s worth, a really damn pretty one - and you later sample The Beach Boys, Nancy Sinatra, Chuck Berry, and Patsy Cline, interpolate Fleetwood Mac, and “cover” one of Dolly Parton’s most famous songs in ‘Jolene’, and believe me, we’ll get to that one, you’re paying a fortune in royalties, and for some really well-known cultural signifiers too. I really wish all the harmonies were allowed to sound as organic as they should - the vocal mastering and blending can feel frustratingly inconsistent across this album, which happens when you’re probably not recording in the same space with the same producers, usually too clean and touched up which is an odd choice when you’re trying to amplify a more organic analog foundation.\n\nBut really, that’s indicative of the larger question of the sound and structure of this album as a whole, and let’s get into the latter, which seems to have the feel of two ideas inelegantly mashed together, that of a vintage country radio show hosted by Willie Nelson in ‘let’s get high and hang out’ mode, that less-than-seamlessly slides into the ‘Linda Martell Show’, starting with snippets of Martell discussing genre as the first Black woman to play at the Grand Ole Opry now having her own throwback variety hour show. The juxtaposition is stark and intentional: what Texas “country” in some form is, highlighting the moments where as a consummate performer Beyonce is not far removed and in a different timeline could have played the Opry herself, but also how limited the structures of genre can be, opening up songs where Beyonce samples and dives into various regional flavours of country past and present, highlighting roots in blues and classic R&B and Memphis soul and even modern Texas rap, which coincidentally is seeing something of a revival the past few years and it would have been kind of cool to see some of that get featured outside of production choices. But if you dig into the liner notes, it’s very telling how her team doesn’t really bring in even acclaimed producers in modern country - yes, the Cam and Rhiannon Giddens writing/performance credits are welcome, but this is an album that leans on The-Dream and Pharrell and even a pleasant surprise for me with Raphael Saadiq, which leads to a sound palette where you’ll hear acoustic guitar and slightly more organic percussion and the occasional bit of fiddle, but grounded in different grooves and structures that owe more to, well, Beyonce’s usual sound in pop and R&B and soul. The closest we get to country leaning production comes from Shawn Everett and Jonathan Rado on the Miley Cyrus duet ‘II MOST WANTED’, and they’re both predominantly indie rock - although incidentally, they nail the sound palette here, the fiddle sounds terrific, and Beyonce and Miley have better vocal chemistry than I think Beyonce has had with anyone since Destiny’s Child, it’s a tremendous highlight. Kind of an utter shame that Beyonce follows it with ‘LEVII’S JEANS’, where the mix is milquetoast and Post Malone sounds abysmal minus his usual production especially alongside Beyonce, but hey, have to include the pop crossover concession - we’ll absolutely get back to that. But overall, like with Renaissance Beyonce’s voice is often the most prominent element in any mix outside of the groove… but with less groove to work with and a reliance on heavier midtempo ballads, the songs start feeling skeletal, lacking in foundational melody and that means the album starts feeling its extended length very fast, with a lot fewer uptempo songs. And this strikes me as a bizarre choice: Beyonce has the voice and power to make some huge, warm, epic-sounding Texas country jams, where the mix could feel a lot more full and rollicking and anthemic, built for the live show, and it doesn’t really happen - ‘TEXAS HOLD’EM’, the sample heavy dance jam ‘YA YA’, or the pulsing acoustic ‘RIIVERDANCE’ are the exceptions, not the rule… unless you count the country rap cuts where there’s more twang alongside stock if well-balanced percussion, where they feel a little lackluster in terms of the melodic hook, or with ‘SWEET ★ HONEY ★ BUCKIIN’ sounding like three ideas Pharrell mashed together. But that’s also frustratingly common on this album: the songs generally flow into each other well, and it’s a nice conceit that the project could flow into itself back to front, but there’s no consideration for momentum, and it leads to swerves that struggle to make sense even context. Take ‘DAUGHTER’, the sort of sultry, dark country melodrama where I was totally onboard for Beyonce going here… but midway through the song she interpolates an Italian opera aria and while lyrically it makes sense in context, in execution it feels like it’s only here so Beyonce could prove she could sing in that style and pull it off. And when you follow it with Linda Martell talking about the confines of genre on ‘SPAGHETTI’, which is straight up country trap… and look, I get what the wild juxtapositions in sound are trying to imply about genre convention and who is allowed to expand and explore it, a conversation Beyonce wants to just take by force, and the execution can feel really hamfisted.\n\nIn fact… you know, we’ve danced around this long enough: let’s talk about genre and what it really is, and what Beyonce knows that it is: marketing. It’s branding, it’s setting up broad descriptive signifiers that if someone is getting a product, they have a rough idea of what they’re getting, more built for the consumer than the artist if we’re being brutally honest. Were genre conventions often built on societal factors like racism, absolutely - country was split from the blues at its origin point by the early radio programmers and marketers to tell white and Black audiences who the music is for so they could make more money off targeted and segregated audiences and incidentally keep them away from recognizing any class solidarity and common ground, country music historians at the Hall of Fame in Nashville make that clear, and this has persisted across all genres, especially those in which Beyonce has worked, pop and R&B. And let’s keep it real, it still occurs today: the Black acts that make pop music are pushed and marketed as R&B, which has its own unique sound and traditions, where white pop acts are allowed to dabble and jump across genres and get acclaim for not sticking inside the box. Country can actually be a bit unique in this space in that there are conservative genre purists who get annoyed at the slightest genre-bending from anyone, but I did an entire two hour video essay about how bro-country was industry-backed and was allowed to flaunt those conventions and grab rap cliches wholesale - often badly - and yet Beyonce playing to more organic Texas sounds got backlash? But I said this back in 2019 with ‘Old Town Road’ and Lil Nas X and it’s just as relevant: while systemic racism is a factor in covering genre and its history, in industry towns like Nashville and within record labels, ‘genre’ is a construct that built to protect the money and prop up an exploitative system, who ‘paid their dues’ and who are in the club versus those who aren’t, and those boundaries get flexible when the right cheques are cashed, especially when you’re willing to play the game. Going back to Linda Martell, it is true that her career was derailed by racist bullshit from her label boss - it was literally called Plantation Records, good lord - and him threatening to sue any other label she signed to, but also what struck me in digging through the history is how so much of it mimics bad business in Nashville to this very day across the board; systemic oppression only compounds.\n\nSo let’s go back to Beyonce and COWBOY CARTER, and two very real truths that need to be stressed, the first being that as a Black woman coming up across pop and R&B she worked her ass off to get to where she is, especially to achieve this type of longevity; she played a hard game and won, and on some base level the ‘go fuck yourself’ attitude of this album to those who are still scorning her, trying to take what is rightfully hers, I absolutely get the emotional resonance and heady power fantasy that it is, why so many are just enthralled from jump. Hell, I’m on her side when it comes to the bullshit she faced from Nashville and to a similar extent from the Grammys - she references not caring about winning the top prize for Album of the Year when she absolutely should have at least for Lemonade, and the systemic context of the losses clearly stings when she’s so talented and not getting the acclaim despite having played the game. It is also fundamentally true that Beyonce has had the benefit of excellent management, label support, and her husband being a top tier rapper, businessman, and mogul that has translated to billionaire status; talent and hard work is absolutely there, but opportune circumstance, good connections, and support did a lot of heavy lifting too, and her access to resources has only grown greater with time. And it’s a massive complicating factor when it comes to drawing genre parallels by just making it about the sound and art when you don’t acknowledge how utterly unique and against all odds Beyonce’s situation is, and how it doesn’t remotely mirror the vast majority of artists working today, especially other Black women in Nashville. That’s not to disparage those who Beyonce brought onboard for this album - the harmonies on ‘Blackbird’ are striking, I’m thrilled that Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy & Reyna Roberts are going to get the first featuring credits on the Billboard Hot 100 when they chart, despite it just being for a Beatles cover where their splits will be very limited, and I’m happy all their streaming numbers went up with this release including those for Linda Martell… but that’s an atomized boost, that’s not systemic change that’ll last on Music Row or the industry at large, and I’m not even sure that for the most awarded person in Grammy history it moves a needle for this as Album of the Year. And for an album that wants to claim that it’s so genre-breaking in its structure and epic scale, magnifying Beyonce’s power, with so much attitude, it leaves me asking why she bothers to give the CMAs and Music Row or the goddamn Grammys the time of day, or worse still, very obvious label concessions - Post Malone should not be on this album, for god’s sake! Incidentally, the initial vinyl and CD releases exclude chunks of this album… with pretty much every moment where Linda Martell is actually mentioned, and while some of that might just be incidental or a screwup in product release, it does feel revealing what could be cut. What it also reveals is that Beyonce and her team are still very much playing the game - I said this with Renaissance and if anything it’s more true here, while there is more structural experimentation in some of the juxtapositions, I don’t think it’s a very strong subversion of even Nashville power structures so much as reinforcing the structures in which she has her own power…\n\nAnd truth be told, I don’t think she’s trying for subversion anymore, and this is where we have to get to the content because outside of the dance jams and broad genre critique, in terms of subject matter this album plays to a lot of very traditional, conservative-leaning tropes in the genre. Hard work, raising one’s children, standing by your man - and there’s a decent number of sex songs here, and Beyonce is still pretty good at them - pulling yourself up by your bootstraps to beat the odds, being a good Christian woman, American patriotism, individualism, where proper heritage and history needs to be reclaimed. To be abundantly fucking clear, you can make great art with these themes, I’ve praised a lot of it for over a decade… and moreover, for as much as folks like Azealia Banks think all of this is Jay-Z’s fault that’s she’s playing into these tropes, I remember those Beyonce albums in the 2000s and 2010s, especially on Lemonade - the subtext has not changed all that much, a country framing just shows a different side of it. But what I find most revealing, in the direct throughline from Lemonade and in the proud tradition of country revenge songs, is how much pure venom Beyonce has for that ‘Becky with the good hair’ that has persisted nearly a decade later, as this album focuses the majority of its anger on bringing down that woman with righteous vengeance. And that takes us to the cover of Dolly Parton’s ‘Jolene’, and let’s be clear: the vocal performance and arrangement of the song are excellent, if it was a pure cover, it’d be a tremendous highlight… but Beyonce and her team rewrite the lyrics where desperate pleas become threats and any possibility of vulnerability or deeper humanity goes out the window. Honestly, it feels tacky - at least when ‘DAUGHTER’ follows it there’s some pathos in the violent melodrama that feels like it could have been pulled from a soap opera, but what’s wild is that it doesn’t stop there - the next track ‘SPAGHETTI’ features lines that are in direct reference to Kelis calling out Beyonce for sampling without asking or credit… which Beyonce and Pharrell absolutely did, they took the sample off Renaissance, if she’s so beneath you, why are you punching down. It’s a sour moment amidst more than a few across this album - which for an act who has been this successful, it’s a human ugliness that feels very self-serving… and also emblematic of a very specific hyper-rich brand of conservatism, those who have achieved every success but still aren’t that happy. And to the conversation about genres and the poisonous conflation of systemic racism and capitalism which entrenched them, you can tell exactly where this album stops short of taking that next step, challenging the bad systems… because it would have to acknowledge how much Beyonce and Jay-Z have benefited from compromising within it; it echoes a much heavier problem with Renaissance, where country has been more willing to play by the rules, but if Beyonce wants to explicitly highlight how those rules were written, why not go all the way. And I’ll be honest, that’s kind of heartbreaking because Beyonce has the power and influence to reach out to women white or Black to speak at length about Music Row has screwed them over, never giving them their fair shake if they don’t play by the rules, or even if they do. Ask Yola, who is a Black woman with a tremendous voice and great, acclaimed albums working in Nashville who has never sniffed radio crossover. Ask Neko Case, who is still blackballed from the Grand Ole Opry to this day. Ask Maren Morris - hell, ask any of the Highwomen, a supergroup Nashville couldn’t promote worth shit in 2019; you think Beyonce couldn’t have found pathos working with Amanda Shires post-divorce from Jason Isbell after a project like 2022’s Take It Like A Man? Ask Carly Pearce, who saw her ex-husband’s flailing career get as much of a shot of life as hers in the wake of her divorce. Hell, ask Kacey Musgraves - even beyond her own divorce, she’s a woman from Texas who was blackballed from country radio and only got to #1 on the Hot 100 a decade after she broke through thanks to Zach Bryan and ‘I Remember Everything’, where Nashville radio made the choice to lose money and deliberately not play the song… but she won album of the year at the Grammys, so that might speak for itself. And fuck the Grammys for that one too, Dirty Computer was right goddamn there, and it’s a better album than Golden Hour.\n\nNow if you’re looking at all of this critique and thinking, ‘you’re being unfair, Beyonce is not going to fix these systems, she should not be expected to, this sort of systemic critique is why leftists don’t enjoy art, you need to meet it where it is and not care if it aligns with your politics’… honestly, there’s truth in that. I want to make this clear, this is not a purity test for Beyonce - although I’m of the belief that if you have this much power and resources, you face more critique, not less - because truth be told, if she had just made a pure country album with plenty of fiddle and pedal steel and stack the harmonies as rich as she does here, I’d probably call it one of her best, even if it played to a lot of the same subject matter; it’d be brash as hell, but I would probably get onboard. I also think that if she did all the genre bending anyway and didn’t frequently draw attention to old bitter grudges and how she’s kind of flaunting genre conventions, let the songs speak for themselves, I think this could have been a lot more effective in its thematic arc; that sort of historical metatext has a lot of richness for me. And that’s where the tension lies: Beyonce is a consummate entertainer looking to explore a genre near-and-dear to her and maybe push further… but the need to pair it with the import of ‘Beyonce the Neoliberal Icon’, and the mountains of bad discourse that come with it, especially by folks who proudly know very little of country except their proclamations Beyonce is now queen of it, it forces the album itself into a weird, thorny, compromised place. And the sad thing is that I can’t even get mad at folks in mainstream and indie country circles praising this album, because they’re doing so with hope - they want to believe that someone of Beyonce’s talent and influence can do the unthinkable and make the bad systems better, inform more folks of country’s layered history and Black roots… or hell, maybe they’re just happy she’s patronizing the genre and they buy into the hype, there’s probably truth in that too. And again, when the album gets out of its own way, there are great moments here: the cover of ‘Blackbird’ is gorgeous, ‘TEXAS HOLD’EM’ is still a lot of fun even if that whistling outro owes more to Edward Sharpe than any country, I really liked the brittle acoustics and harmonies on ‘ALLIIGATOR TEARS’, the build-up of ‘JUST FOR FUN’ with Willie Jones was terrific, ‘YA YA’ will work a lot of dancefloors this year and for good reason, and ‘II MOST WANTED’ is an absolute pop country crossover smash that with any justice is going to be huge, probably my favourite song from either Beyonce or Miley in years. Hell, ‘DAUGHTER’ is ridiculous but I respect the melodramatic vamping more than I probably should.\n\nBut as a whole, COWBOY CARTER is pretty good but not great, at least once you get a handle on what it is, more country in ethos and content than sound with some stunning highlights, but really it’s an album defined by its tension. It’s a sprawling epic full of brittle, spotty compositions, unkempt sequencing, and production that sporadically pays off the climaxes, delivered with the righteous fervour to set old glory ablaze, but ultimately holding it high for everyone to see you. It is some of Beyonce’s best ever performances that hang lonely in the wind so the circle may never be unbroken. It is her American dream and American heartbreak, which on some level for her, sound like two sides of the same coin."
