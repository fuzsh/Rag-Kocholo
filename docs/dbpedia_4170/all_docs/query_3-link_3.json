What chain of events led to its creation? Just as detectives look for traces of evidence to solve a mystery, astronomers analyze the evidence that points to the formation of the Sun and planets. In particular, they study the influence that impacts and collisions had on the worlds of the solar system. The most dramatic evidence for this collisional history of solar system evolution are the impact craters found on almost all the bodies in the solar system, including Earth. These surface scars tell us the formation history of planets, moons, and rings was violent. Yet today, we live in a relatively stable solar system, made possible by the shattering collisions that shaped our worlds.\n\nThis program gives us a unique look at the formation of the solar system by tracing the role that collisions played throughout its history. Beginning with the condensation of the initial cloud of gas and cosmic dust, we explore the history of planetary formation and the mechanism of accretion that played an important role in shaping the worlds of the solar system.\n\nRecommended Age: 14+\n\nRun Time: 21 Minutes\n\nScience Education Standards Info »\n\nBlack Holes (2006)\n\nBlack Holes takes you on a fully immersive journey through one of the most mystifying, awe-inspiring phenomena in the universe: a black hole.\n\nWhere do they come from?

What are the required conditions to foster life? Solar energy, a protective atmosphere, liquid water—but maybe much more. The record of Earth's past shows long-term stability, punctuated by moving continents, periods of rising and falling oceans and ice ages followed by global warming. What combination of environmental variation and stability is required for life to begin and to become intelligent?\n\nBased on the genetic diversity in human DNA around the globe, all modern humans can be traced to an ancestral source population in East Africa. The East African Rift Valley is a unique environment for the discovery of ancient hominid remains. Here, moving faults have exposed sediments of ancient lakes and rivers, and the precious fossils they conceal. Lucy lived here 3.2 million years ago at a time of changing climate with more seasonal variation and of savannahs replacing rainforests. The embodiment of early hominids, Lucy was about the height and weight of a modern ten-year-old girl and was fully bipedal. By standing upright, she could look over the grassland, cover longer distances, spot predators, and regulate her body temperature more efficiently.\n\nFollowing Lucy came hominids with more human behaviors: stone tool making, scavenging, meat eating, hunting and mastering fire. The larger brains needed for these tasks resulted in an extended childhood, which required more complex social groups and the development of language.\n\nLucys Cradle, the Birth of Wonder chronicles these developments along the East African Rift Valley and then follows the spread of humans around the globe. From the obelisks of Axum to mountaintop observatories, humans have searched for a relationship with the heavens. Modern astronomers are continuing a magnificent journey of human vision that began over 3 million years ago when a young female hominid peered over the grassland of East Africa and saw the distant horizon beyond her fingertips.\n\nRecommended Age: 10+\n\nRun Time: 23 Minutes\n\nStandard Alignment Educator Resource »\n\nMax Goes to the Moon (2015)\n\nMax (the dog) and a young girl named Tori take the first trip to the Moon since the Apollo era.

What was it that brought the Magi from the East to a little town in Palestine? Who were the wise men? Were there just three? Did they come from Persia, Babylon or Ethiopia? Did they follow a visible star to Jerusalem? Was Jesus born 2005 years ago? Is December 25th his real birthday?\n\nStar of Bethlehem takes you to the time of mystery, in a planetarium show produced by the Houston Museum of Natural Science that answers these questions and more, as audiences search for a celestial object that could have led the wise men to the Christ child. A planet was called a \"wandering star.\" A meteor was a \"shooting star.\" And a comet was a \"hairy star\" because its tail looked like a beard. These are all candidates in our search. See the new research of a triple conjunction that may have been the sign in the East of the new Messiah.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 22 Minutes\n\nThe Sun, Our Living Star (2018)\n\nThe Sun has shone on our world for four and a half billion years. The light that warms our skin today has been felt by every person who has ever lived. It is our nearest star and our planets powerhouse, the source of the energy that drives our winds, our weather and all life.\n\nThe passage of the Suns fiery disc across the sky—day by day, month by month—was the only way to keep track of time for countless past civilizations.

When impacted by an asteroid, the Cosmonaute is forced to make a forced landing on an unknown planet. There he will meet a strange rabbit who will help him to return home, teaching us a valuable lesson.\n\nRecommended Age: 4+\n\nRun Time: 4 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 1: Grace (2018)\n\nIts difficult to measure the depletion of water reservoirs when they are underground. NASA has come up with a creative solution—measuring changes in Earths gravity from space. Wet ground has more mass than dry ground, just like how a wet sponge is heavier than a dry one. This means that wet ground has a larger gravitational pull than dry ground. By measuring this fractional change, a pair of NASA satellites, called the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, have been mapping our remaining underground water reservoirs across the globe.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 7 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 2: Big Science, Small Packages (2018)\n\nIn this episode we explore the development of Cube Satellites.

Pluto is part of a system of small bodies in the outer solar system known as the Kuiper Belt, where many comets linger. After New Horizons sped by Pluto, astronomers decided to steer the spacecraft toward an even smaller target, a dumbbell-shaped object dubbed MU-69, hoping it can teach us about the conditions of the early solar system.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 6 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 4: Parker Solar Probe (2019)\n\nHundreds of engineers, scientists, and technicians spent nearly a decade constructing the Parker Solar Probe to send it into the Suns atmosphere where it will study how the solar wind is created. The solar wind is a gas that streams off from the Sun, strong enough to strip away a planets atmosphere. Scientists currently do not understand how that gas is accelerated away from the Sun. Parker Solar Probe will be able to answer these questions by physically going to the spot where we think the solar wind is created and watching it happen. To do this, the Parker Solar Probe has to go into the outer layers of the Sun, six times closer than Mercury. At this point, the spacecraft will be going 430,000 miles per hour and shielded from temperatures of over 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 7 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 5: Apollos Legacy — Rocks from the Moon (2019)\n\nWeather and geological activity erase Earths earliest records of how the planet formed, so this information needs to come from elsewhere. Fifty years ago, the Apollo astronauts brought back 840 pounds of moon rocks, pebbles, sand, and dust from six different landing sites. These rocks tell us that the Moon formed from the Earth: billions of years ago, Earth was likely hit by a body the size of Mars, and the Moon formed out of the resulting debris. The chemical composition of the Moon rocks has also taught us about how the Earth itself formed, with the heavier elements sinking down to the planets core and the lighter elements floating on the top to form the crust.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 8 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 6: The Dawn of Orion (2019)\n\nIts been 50 years since NASA last built a human spacecraft. The Orion spacecraft follows in Apollos footsteps, but with technology upgrades that allow it to support up to six crew members for three weeks. Astronauts will use Orion to conduct a lunar flyby in 2023. Subsequent missions will also be used to construct a lunar space station, termed the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway. The Gateway will be used for both manned and robotic exploration of the Moon and extraction of resources, such as mining lunar water ice which can be used to make rocket fuel.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 5 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 7: TESS (2020)\n\nThe Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, is currently looking all over the sky at 200,000 nearby stars, searching for new planets. It does this by measuring how a stars brightness changes over time. A planet that travels in front of its star will block out the stars light, which TESS will measure as a dimming. This method can also tell us about the planets size, orbit, and even a bit about its atmosphere.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 6 Minutes\n\nFiske Explorations 8: SOFIA (2021)\n\nBy looking at the universe in infrared light, astronomers are able to see objects that are otherwise invisible. However, this infrared light gets absorbed by water vapor low in Earth's atmosphere.To solve this problem, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry an infrared telescope high above Earth's surface. SOFIA is also known for the Airborne Astronomy Ambassadors program, where groups of high school teachers are brought onto the flight to see the teamwork and process involved in scientific research. They then take this unique experience back to their classrooms.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 7 Minutes\n\nFour Paths of the Sun\n\nThis short program illustrates why Earth has seasons, how the Sun's altitude in the sky changes over the course of a year, and how the angle of the Sun causes changes in weather.\n\nRecommended Age: 8+\n\nRun Time: 10 Minutes\n\nGalaxies (2016)\n\nOnce we thought that Earth was the center of the universe.
