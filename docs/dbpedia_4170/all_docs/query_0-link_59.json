        "text": "Nashville may be known as Music City to most, but to those in the music industry, it's the \"10-Year Town.\" While overnight successes can happen, for most creatives, it's a slow and steady climb — and in Nashville specifically, the story often goes that it takes a decade before catching that big break.\n\nActs like reigning ACM and CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Carly Pearce and CMA New Artist of the Year (and 2022 Best New Artist GRAMMY nominee) Jimmie Allen — who moved to Nashville in 2009 and 2007, respectively — are a testament to this adage. So is rising star Hailey Whitters, who even wrote a song titled \"Ten Year Town\" in 2017; she proclaims in the final verse, \"This next song could turn it all around.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old singer/songwriter is part of country's latest class of artists who are making waves years after their start in Music City. That class includes Walker Hayes, whose \"Fancy Like\" went from TikTok sensation to GRAMMY-nominated No. 1 hit last year — 17 years into his time in Nashville — and Jameson Rodgers, who saw his first No. 1 as a singer with 2020's \"Some Girls\" 10 years after he moved to Music City.\n\n\"I compare it to going to law school or medical school,\" Rodgers says. \"It takes moving here and meeting as many people as possible. It takes being poor for a few years while you work on your craft. The early years prepare you for what's to come. It's a crazy dream to chase, but I'm really glad I did it.\"\n\nBelow, discover the journeys of Whitters, Hayes, Rodgers, and five more of their country cohorts, and hear their testimonials on why the Nashville grind is worth it.\n\nERNEST\n\nHometown: Nashville, TN\n\nSigned label deal: 2018\n\nBig break: \"Flower Shops,\" a duet with Morgan Wallen, broke the top 20 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart in June 2022\n\nERNEST has been writing songs since middle school and credits a trip to the Grand Ole Opry in the fourth grade for further igniting that fire for music. \"Even as a fourth grader I was like, 'I want to do this one day,'\" he recalls.\n\nThe singer saw early success co-penning No. 1 songs for Chris Lane (\"Big, Big Plans\"), Morgan Wallen (\"More Than My Hometown\") and Sam Hunt (\"Breaking Up Was Easy in the 90s\") but it was his Flower Shops (The Album) that set the bar even higher. \"With the Flower Shops album, I've come into full form as my country artist self,\" he says. \"I'm still going to be growing always and evolving, but this is me. This album is me, and I'm here.\"\n\nThough he's a native Nashvillian, ERNEST says 2022 marks 10 years since he began pursuing music. Fittingly, he agrees that Nashville is a 10-year town. \"Obviously there are people that have success super early on and get that lucky break immediately but as [hit songwriter and Big Loud Records Partner] Craig Wiseman said, 'Everybody pays their dues — you either pay them at the beginning, or pay them at the end.'\"\n\nHailey Whitters\n\nHometown: Shueyville, IA\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2007\n\nSigned label deal: 2020\n\nBig break: 2020's The Dream, which Whitters self-funded and self-released\n\nHailey Whitters picked up the guitar at 14 and has been writing songs ever since. Whitters' earliest influences include '90s country radio titans Alan Jackson, Trisha Yearwood, the Chicks and Tim McGraw. Little did she know that decades later, she'd have her songs recorded by Jackson, Martina McBride and Little Big Town.\n\n\"Growing up adoring country radio, I think I knew early on [I wanted to be an artist] — but I had no idea how to go about it, because no one from my town had ever tried,\" Whitters says. \"I had a guidance counselor in elementary school tell me if I wanted to be a country music star, I had to learn how to write my own songs, so I started doing that.\"\n\nWhitters' relatable storytelling on songs like the autobiographical (and fittingly titled) \"Ten Year Town\" eventually caught the attention of Music Row, and she signed with Big Loud Records' female-driven imprint Songs & Daughters in 2020. Her infectious breakthrough single, \"Everything She Ain't,\" goes for adds at country radio June 27 — nearly 15 years after she relocated from her native Iowa to Nashville.\n\nSo, what's Whitters' opinion on the 10-year town philosophy? \"Everyone's experience is different,\" she says. \"I will say in my time here, I've found that most things that last weren't the things that happened overnight.\"\n\nHARDY\n\nHometown: Philadelphia, MS\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2010\n\nSigned label deal: 2018\n\nBig break: \"One Beer\" feat. Lauren Alaina and Devin Dawson hit No. 1 on Billboard and Mediabase charts in December 2020\n\nHARDY never intended to be an artist. As a teenager, he learned about songwriters and became a fan of Rodney Clawson, Casey Beathard, Eric Church and Brad Paisley. He started writing songs at 17, and in the nearly 14 years since, he has authored 10 No. 1 songs including Blake Shelton's \"God's Country,\" Florida Georgia Line's \"Simple,\" Morgan Wallen's \"Up Down\" and Dierks Bentley's \"Beers On Me.\" But it wasn't until producer Joey Moi reached out that his career path changed.\n\n\"He was my favorite producer of all time,\" HARDY says. \"He had just produced 'Up Down,' and it was climbing up the charts, and he called me and said, 'Dude, if you ever wanted to cut a record, I would love to cut a record [for] you.' A switch flipped in my head, and I said, 'Okay, let's do this.'\"\n\nWhile he's managed to earn two No. 1s as an artist in his own right, HARDY feels he hasn't arrived quite yet. \"I think a lot of artists never really have that moment,\" he says. \"Part of their muse and part of what drives them and keeps them going is always looking for something more.\"\n\nJameson Rodgers\n\nHometown: Batesville, MS\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2010\n\nSigned label deal: 2018\n\nBig break: \"Some Girls\" reached No. 1 on Billboard and Mediabase in October 2020\n\nJameson Rodgers can't remember a time when he wasn't singing. As a kid, he'd walk around school belting Travis Tritt's \"Here's a Quarter\" and other '90s hits. His first musical memory is a Garth Brooks show at the Pyramid in Memphis, TN, at age 5. \"He used to break his guitar on stage every night back then,\" Rodgers says. \"Seeing him do that, as a young kid, I felt like I knew I wanted to do that someday, but I was too young to process it.\"\n\nRodgers picked up guitar in college and began writing songs. An Eric Church show during his freshman year reaffirmed the feeling that Garth had inspired: \"I knew that I had to chase this dream.\"\n\nHe didn't know anyone when he moved to Nashville in 2010, so he went to every open-mic night he could and quickly made friends with HARDY, Hunter Phelps and Jordan Davis. He's since had two No. 1 songs as an artist with \"Some Girls\" and \"Cold Beer Calling My Name\" (a duet with Luke Combs), as well as co-written Chris Lane's No. 1 hit \"I Don't Know About You\" and songs for Florida Georgia Line, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nHometown: Baskin, LA\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2011\n\nSigned label deal: 2018\n\nBig break: \"Things a Man Oughta Know\" hit No. 1 on Billboard and Mediabase in September 2021\n\nLainey Wilson's success story is practically the definition of the 10-year town sentiment: In September 2021, 10 years and one month — nearly to the day — that she moved to Nashville, her debut single, \"Things a Man Oughta Know,\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard and Mediabase country radio charts. (Thanks to her 2022 Cole Swindell collaboration, \"Never Say Never,\" she's already notched her second chart-topper.)\n\n\"I've been blessed with several milestone 'pinch me' moments, especially within the last year, and I feel like I'm always going to be a work in progress,\" Wilson suggests. \"I don't know if I'll ever feel like I've fully arrived. But I will say, when my deddy [sic] called the first time he heard my song on the radio, that was a pivotal moment.\"\n\nWilson first performed in public at her kindergarten graduation. Even at just 5 years old, she knew she wanted to sing for the rest of her life.\n\n\"I wrote my first song at 9 years old and took a family vacation to Nashville,\" she recalls. \"I remember exactly where I was on the interstate with my family when I said, 'This is home.' I knew in my heart I was going to be a part of the country music family in some way. I've never had a doubt.\"\n\nShy Carter\n\nHometown: Memphis, TN\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2011\n\nSigned label deal: 2020\n\nBig break: 2021's The Rest of Us EP, which has garnered more than 12 million streams on Spotify\n\nAs a songwriter, Shy Carter has co-written countless country hits like Kane Brown's \"Heaven\" and \"Good As You,\" Keith Urban's \"Never Coming Down\" and \"God Whispered Your Name,\" and Sugarland's \"Stuck Like Glue.\" While he knew he wanted to be an artist from a young age, singing along to songs in his bedroom, it took years of writing hits for other artists before his artist dream came to fruition.\n\nIn 2020, he released his spirited debut single, \"Good Love\" and landed on MusicRow's \"Top 100 Songwriters of 2020\" list. The Rest of Us EP followed in 2021, and included the raucous ode to a night out with his buddies, \"Beer With My Friends,\" featuring Cole Swindell and David Lee Murphy. To date, he has amassed 35 million streams worldwide across all on-demand DSP platforms.\n\n\"I've had a particular vision for how I want the music to feel and how I want to bring people together from all different walks of life,\" Carter says of his artist career. \"There have been a lot of wonderful things happening in my career, and I'm so grateful for all of it. But there's a lot more to me as an artist, and I'll be arriving live in living color very soon.\"\n\nWhile Carter agrees that Nashville is a 10-year town, as it has taken him a decade to launch his artist career, he says there are exceptions. \"I have seen some people blow up really fast, and I'm glad to see it! I'm happy to take the journey slow and steady and soak up every moment.\"\n\nTenille Townes\n\nHometown: Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2014\n\nSigned label deal: 2018\n\nBig break: \"Somebody's Daughter\" reached the Top 30 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart in May 2019\n\nWhen Tenille Townes was 9, Shania Twain pulled her up on stage to sing. \"That lit a fire in me and made me believe anything was possible,\" she remembers.\n\nBy 14, Townes was traveling back and forth to Nashville. Ten years later, in 2018, she signed with Columbia Nashville and caught attention with her thoughtful songwriting and powerful story songs \"Somebody's Daughter\" and \"Jersey On the Wall (I'm Just Asking).\"\n\nBoth tracks topped the Canadian Country Airplay charts while \"Somebody's Daughter\" peaked at No. 26 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart. Named the 2020 ACM New Female Artist of the Year, Townes' star has only continued to rise. By 2021 her Jay Joyce-produced debut album, The Lemonade Stand, was named Country Album of the Year at the JUNO Awards in her native Canada. A believer in the 10 year town adage, Townes says Nashville continues to embrace and inspire those who are brave enough to keep showing up.\n\n\"It's a welcoming community, and at the same time it's also hard to not bend and shift your shape to fit in,\" she says. \"I also believe there's validity in the 10,000-hour theory, and that arriving to a solid foundation of your craft is connected to the time you put in — however many years that amounts to in any town.\"\n\nWalker Hayes\n\nHometown: Mobile, AL\n\nArrived in Nashville: 2004\n\nSigned label deal: 2017\n\nBig break: \"Fancy Like\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard and Mediabase country charts in July 2021\n\n\"Nashville, to me, is a 17-year town,\" Walker Hayes says. \"It is not a town you come and conquer overnight. There's really no such thing as an overnight success. 'Fancy Like' did pop overnight, but it took multiple jobs, a lot of heartbreaks, financial woes that I don't ever want to go back and relive.\"\n\nIt took nearly two decades and three record deals before Hayes achieved a No. 1 single with \"Fancy Like.\" Hayes (who had moderate success with 2017's \"You Broke Up With Me\" which peaked at No. 10 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart), admits his story isn't the norm, as he didn't play his first show until he was 23 at local Mobile bar the Yacht Club — a night he says \"changed my life.\"\n\nWhen he and his wife came back from their honeymoon, the couple drove their U-Haul to Nashville. Two weeks later, Hayes found himself at Nashville's preeminent listening room, the Bluebird Café, where he was introduced to the magic of songwriting. He walked out of the venue having written his first song and hasn't stopped since.\n\n\"I wouldn't change my journey for the world,\" Hayes says. \"To me, the adventure is what's priceless. That's what shapes us. I'm so grateful for how the journey has unfolded.\"\n\nLiving Legends: Kenny Loggins On Self-Acceptance, The Art Of Collaboration & New Memoir 'Still Alright'\n\nLainey Wilson will be in discussion, with a performace to follow, at the GRAMMY Museum on Sept. 5. Learn more about the event here.\n\nIf there's one word to describe Lainey Wilson's life in the past year, it's whirlwind — which is exactly how she chose the name of her third album.\n\nSince releasing Bell Bottom Country in 2022, the Louisiana-bred singer has been on an unprecedented tear. Whether she's selling out arenas nationwide, collecting countless awards, or launching or own line with Wrangler, Wilson is country music's newest queen.\n\nIt's the culmination of a long and hard-fought journey for Wilson, who first moved to Nashville over a decade ago with not much more than a dream. But as she explained to GRAMMY.com earlier this year, Wilson has been manifesting this level of country music success since she wrote her first song at just 9 years old.\n\n\"I've dedicated my life to it,\" she said. \"And it really is cool to just feel like that little 9-year-old girl who was writing her first song, that she wasn't completely crazy.\"\n\nRead More: Lainey Wilson On How Her Stardom Is A Testament To \"Believin' And Receivin'\"\n\nWilson grinded behind the scenes in songwriter rooms and at local gigs during her early years in Nashville, independently releasing her self-titled debut record in 2014, followed by the fittingly titled Tougher in 2016. It was a time of trial by fire as Wilson was learning how to navigate not only Nashville's music scene, but honing her own voice as a songwriter as well.\n\n\"Each album has been a reflection of the season I was in at the time,\" Wilson tells GRAMMY.com now. \"My first album was the safest. I was young and had just moved to Nashville, but still hadn't seen too much of the world just yet. My next album became more confident and a little sassy. After that, I started to really discover my north star, staying open to all kinds of people and opportunities and sticking with the parts that felt the most authentic to me.\"\n\nJust months before signing with Broken Bow Records in 2018, she delivered another self-titled project – this time, an EP, which conveyed both gratitude and sensitivity with songs like \"Dreamcatcher\" and \"Breakin' Your Heart.\" Both qualities would soon become Wilson's trademark, and what particularly made listeners gravitate toward her breakthrough hit (and eventual first No. 1 at country radio), \"Things A Man Oughta Know.\"\n\nFirst appearing on her 2019 EP, Redneck Hollywood, \"Things\" was the second single on her debut studio album, 2021's Sayin' What I'm Thinkin'. Along with putting Wilson on the map, the LP also introduced fans to her unique style that she calls \"bell bottom country\" — sonically, a mix of nostalgic and twangy, pop-tinged sounds that never takes itself too seriously; visually, presented with flair (and flare) in her now-signature bell bottom pants.\n\n\"It's finding that thing that makes you unique, and leaning into it,\" Wilson told Rolling Stone in 2021. \"It could be your story, your sound, where you're from, how you're raised, how you dress. I kept thinking about those words, 'bell-bottom country'…how can we do this? I definitely wanted a bit of Bobbie Gentry vibe, but also the pureness of Lee Ann Womack but also the sassiness of Dolly Parton. I wanted it to feel timeless and classic and, honestly, a little not too perfect.\"\n\nOnce \"Things A Man Oughta Know\" topped the charts, it wasn't long before Wilson did it again with Cole Swindell on \"Never Say Never,\" her first of several chart-topping duets to come. She also hit the road opening for Jason Aldean, setting her up as an artist to watch and ensuring that she wouldn't be a flash-in-the-pan success story.\n\nAfter being unapologetically herself on Sayin' What I'm Thinkin', Wilson doubled down on that sentiment — and her brand — with Bell Bottom Country, a 16-song exploration of classic country instrumentation with glimmering '70s rock elements. It saw Wilson tell her story more than ever before, from the heartfelt ode to her father, \"Those Boots (Deddy's Song),\" to the strong-willed generational tale of \"Wildflowers & Wild Horses.\"\n\nThough Bell Bottom Country was a bit of a slow burn — peaking at No. 9 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart — Wilson's place in the country music zeitgeist was rapidly rising. Two weeks after Bell Bottom Country arrived, she made her acting debut as a guest star in \"Yellowstone\"; a month later, her booty-hugging bell bottoms went viral on TikTok.\n\nWithin the next several months, Bell Bottom Country spawned two No. 1 hits: the dynamic resilience tale, \"Heart Like a Truck,\" and the \"Strawberry Wine\"-esque \"Watermelon Moonshine.\" By the end of 2023, she'd score four No. 1s (thanks to collabs with HARDY and Jelly Roll), serve as direct support for Luke Combs' stadium tour, and become a brand ambassador for Wrangler jeans and Stella Rosa wines — all of it propelling Wilson to becoming a household name. And by May 2024, she'd scooped up three of the most coveted country awards: Entertainer Of The Year at both the Country Music Association Awards and the Academy Of Country Music Awards, and a GRAMMY for Best Country Album for Bell Bottom Country.\n\nAs her fame rose, Wilson had to make a conscious effort to stay grounded — especially because her personal life presented a whirlwind of its own. While the singer's career, as she puts it, \"had me feeling like I was holding on to the tail of an airplane,\" her dad experienced several health issues, and simultaneously, she was balancing a relationship with former NFL quarterback Devlin Hodges.\n\n\"I had to learn how to rise to the occasion, deal with the pressure, and tend to my feelings and personal life around it all,\" Wilson explains. \"I didn't feel in control of anything; like I was the victim of the chaos.\"\n\nBut as she started to make peace with her new reality, Wilson found solace in music. Soon, she had the makings of her fifth album, Whirlwind. \"I [found] my footing through writing these songs and committing to a few good habits that have helped me become my best self,\" she adds.\n\nLike Bell Bottom Country, Whirlwind sees Wilson telling her story — so, naturally, this time, there's a lot more love songs. \"Counting Chickens\" and \"4x4xU\" hint that she's found her life partner, while \"Hang Tight Honey\" and \"Good Horses\" remind that she won't let fame get in the way of a good thing. (Even the title track flips the proverbial whirlwind of her career into a metaphor for love: \"We're a whirlwind/ But baby, loving you's a breeze.\")\n\nWhirlwind largely expands on Wilson's signature country flair, but a standout is the hip-hop, rock and country mash-up \"Ring Finger\" (which, ironically, is a breakup song; \"I got the ring, he got the finger,\" she sings on the chorus). Much like with her previous two albums, Wilson teamed up with producer Jay Joyce for the project, noting that his willingness to experiment has helped her establish a sound that's fresh and unique, but also classic and timeless — a formula that's only proving to be more and more successful for the singer.\n\n\"I've become more confident, first and foremost,\" Wilson says of her growth. \"I've seen beautiful things that come from pressure, and the things it can break. From that, I feel like I am writing with more wisdom and understanding and doing so in a way that kind of observes feelings instead of getting lost in them.\"\n\nThat wisdom and understanding is perhaps most apparent on \"Middle Of It,\" an autobiographical illustration of how she's navigated her growing success. But whether she's exploring new sounds or new storylines, Wilson continues to prove that she'll never lose sight of the country-loving, hard-working girl she's always been.\n\nWhirlwind paints a picture of Wilson rising above her success and its ensuing chaos, ultimately finding herself more at ease than ever before. It's all proof that her long-traveled journey has been well worth it — she's helped make country music cool again, and she doesn't plan on slowing down anytime soon.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nAugust 2024 comes with five Fridays and five weeks of piping hot new music releases. And if July was busy, the upcoming month puts it to task with a sundry of albums for every genre, generation, and gusto.\n\nKicking off August, R&B star Khalid releases Sincere, while masked country singer Orville Peck will release his first duets album, Stampede. The following week, Aug. 9 heralds the third LP from Filipino British singer beabadoobee, This Is How Tomorrow Moves.\n\nBy mid-August, new releases from Foster The People, Nikka Costa, Post Malone and Tinashe will drop, as well as the debut of KATSEYE — a multinational girl group formed by K-pop label HYBE in partnership with Geffen Records. A week later, all eyes and ears will turn to Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet, Lainey Wilson’s Whirlwind, Thomas Rhett’s About A Woman, and Fontaines D.C.’s Romance.\n\nJust before September arrives, Laurie Anderson will release her tribute to aviator Amelia Earhart, Amelia, and A$AP Rocky will make a long-awaited return with Don’t Be Dumb.\n\nTo fill up your upcoming weekends with fresh music, GRAMMY.com crafted a list with 13 remarkable new albums coming out August 2024.\n\nLos Lonely Boys — 'Resurrection' (Aug. 2)\n\nAfter more than a decade away from the studios, Texican rock trio Los Lonely Boys are ready for their Resurrection. The 10-track LP was recorded at guitarist Henry Garza’s home studio in St. Angelo, Texas and in El Paso’s Sonic Ranch (Fiona Apple, Bon Iver).\n\nOn lead singles \"Wish You Would\" and \"See Your Face,\" Los Lonely Boys prove that the wait was worth it, as they experiment with their signature sound for a deeper, more mature output. Resurrection aims to rekindle \"the sonic fire that bonds the Los Lonely Boys brotherhood,\" while also paying respects to Texas legends like Stevie Ray Vaughan and Freddy Fender, per a press release.\n\n\"It’s something we think people need to hear — especially the youth,\" said bassist Jojo Garza. \"When we’re young, we think we have it figured out. When you get older, you start to see things differently. Having kids of our own, we see their ambitions and ideas of what they want to be, so we want to be good parents. The message is, ‘Be careful what you wish for. There could be a false light, and we don’t want you to get hurt.’\"\n\nLos Lonely Boys are also celebrating the 20th anniversary of their self-titled debut, and the commemorations will be extended to a lengthy North American tour. Starting in August and running until November, the shows will also feature long time peers Los Lobos.\n\nKhalid — 'Sincere' (Aug. 2)\n\nFive years after the release of Free Spirit, R&B singer/songwriter Khalid is back with his third full length. Per a press release, Sincere is a \"combination of my life experiences\" that explores the pains and joys of growing up. Khalid noted that \"it takes inspiration from conversations that I have had with my fans, supporters, and the people that love me.\"\n\n\"When I listen back to this project, I hear a sound that’s so unique and represents me at my best,\" he added. \"This album is me at 26, continuing to evolve with the knowledge that I have garnered throughout the years.\" Previewed by singles \"Please Don’t Fall In Love With Me,\" \"Adore U,\" and \"Ground (Cotton Candy Skies),\" Sincere is a 16-track collection that, most of all, showcases Khalid’s maturing.\n\n\"This all feels like the biggest reset for me,\" he shared on Instagram. \"I feel so reminiscent to how I did when I first started my career 8 years ago. I can’t wait for all of you to experience the album.\"\n\nOrville Peck — 'Stampede' (Aug. 2)\n\nGroundbreaking country singer Orville Peck is about to surprise his audience once again. Following 2022’s Bronco, Stampede — his first duet album, and third overall — spans 15 tracks with collaborations from Elton John, Willie Nelson, Beck, Kylie Minogue, Diplo, and more.\n\nBack in May, Peck teased the project with EP Stampede Vol. 1, featuring songs with Noah Cyrus, Midland, and others. \"This project has always been something I’ve fantasized about, so to see it finally come to fruition really is a dream come true,\" said the South African masked star in a press release.\n\nAmong a busy schedule, Peck also announced that his 6th annual Rodeo will happen on Aug. 23, 24 and 25 in Nashville. It will be headlined by himself and Tanya Tucker, and will feature sets from Medium Build, Reyna Roberts, and more. The Stampede North American tour is underway through October.\n\nLearn more: How Queer Country Artists Are Creating Space For Inclusive Stories In The Genre\n\nBeabadoobee — 'This Is How Tomorrow Moves' (Aug. 9)\n\nFilipino-British singer beabadoobee — also known as Beatrice Laus — is so excited about her upcoming third studio album that she decided to bring its release one week forward. This Is How Tomorrow Moves is now coming out on Aug. 9, via Dirty Hit.\n\nFronted by singles \"Take a Bite,\" \"Coming Home,\" and \"Ever Seen,\" the album was produced by Rick Rubin, and features \"themes of self-acceptance and personal growth,\" per a press release. \"I think I’m more aware of my actions in these songs,\" said Laus. \"In my previous records, I would consistently sing about my reaction towards other people’s doings, like a blame game. But in this record, it’s accepting that there’s an inevitability of my fault in there too.\"\n\nTo crystallize those lessons, the alt-pop star is slated to perform at a one-off acoustic show in London, on Aug. 2. Then, she will play two intimate shows in London and Coventry, and a set at All Points East UK festival. In September, Laus will begin her North American tour, following with a string of November concerts in Europe.\n\nPost Malone — 'F-1 Trillion' (Aug. 16)\n\nPosty has been riding high on the country wave ever since May, when he released the top-charting single \"I Had Some Help\" with Morgan Wallen. Followed by \"Pour Me a Drink\" with Blake Shelton, and more recently by \"Guy For That\" with Luke Combs, his shift into the Nashville scene feels not only natural, but also rewarding.\n\nAll three pre-releases are part of Malone’s sixth studio album, F-1 Trillion. The singer also collaborated with Chris Stapleton and Hardy in tracks yet to be revealed, and featured production by Louis Bell, Charlie Handsome, and Hoskins. F-1 also marks the first time that the singer fully dives into country music, despite dabbling with the genre for years.\n\nTo celebrate this momentous phase, Malone will embark on a North American Tour starting September. In the company of backing band The Fools For You, he will hit cities like Boston, Atlanta, Virginia Beach, Charleston, and wrap up in Nashville in October.\n\nRead more: Post Malone's Country Roots: 8 Key Moments In Covers and Collaborations\n\nTinashe — 'Quantum Baby' (Aug. 16)\n\n\"Quantum Baby is about getting to know me on a deeper level,\" said Tinashe in a press release about her upcoming album. \"It’s about exploring who I am as a person and who I am as an artist. I’ve never been one to be put into a box, so the name ‘Quantum Baby’ encompasses all the different parts that make up who I am as a creative.\"\n\nSpearheaded by April’s viral hit \"Nasty,\" which serves as the album’s lead single, Quantum Baby is the second installment of a trilogy that began with 2023’s BB/ANG3L. \"For BB/ANG3L, I was very inspired by the concept of identity. Exploring both how I self-identify and also challenging the perceptions of others,\" explained Tinashe. \"I’ve enjoyed stripping back layers of aesthetic fluff, smoke and mirrors, and white noise to get down to the core of myself. Who we are at a core level, when we are alone — raw and unfiltered, is what I want this album to reflect.\"\n\nSecond single \"Getting No Sleep\" reflects that forthright perspective: \"Feels Friday like, different night, same vibe / Take you outside, movie scene every time / Flick me up, I’m fitted up, so pretty, no bad side / Not a dog, but it’s in me, taking shots like I’m Lindsay,\" she sings.\n\nRead more: Love \"Nasty\"?

Previously shared singles \"Hang Tight Honey,\" \"Country’s Cool Again,\" and \"4x4xU\" feature on the tracklist, as well as a collaboration with Miranda Lambert on \"Good Horses.\"\n\nSeizing the momentum, Wilson recently opened the Bell Bottoms Up bar in Nashville, and released a Hulu-exclusive documentary, Lainey Wilson: Bell Bottom Country. She is also amidst her North American tour, Country’s Cool Again.\n\nSteve Cropper — 'Friendlytown' (Aug. 23)\n\nTime may be tight, but is also just a number to legendary guitarist Steve Cropper. Best known as a member of Stax house band Booker T. & The M.G.’s and as a guitarist for the Blues Brothers, he’s now 82 years old — but just getting started with his solo project, Steve Cropper & the Midnight Hour.\n\nHis 2021 solo debut album, Fire It Up, was nominated for a GRAMMY award in the Best Contemporary Blues Album category, and the upcoming Friendlytown aims to follow the same steps. \"If your booty is not shaking in the first two bars of this album you’re already dead in a chair,\" said Cropper in a press statement. \"I feel so good about this batch of songs. They’re packed with radio hooks, and we have Billy Gibbons, Brian May, and Tim Montana playing on the album — it’s like guitar heaven.\"\n\nSingle \"Too Much Stress\" with Brian May teases what’s to come in Friendlytown: 13 tracks of unbridled creativity and stirring melodies that bring back your faith in humanity. As Cropper said, \"when I think about my legacy, I want it to be said that I was a nice guy.\"\n\nSofi Tukker — 'BREAD' (Aug. 23)\n\n\"Be really energetic and dance.\" That’s the acronym behind Sofi Tukker’s upcoming BREAD, but could also be their official slogan. The electronic duo formed by Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern bring joy and irreverence to their beats, mixing English with Portuguese, EDM with favela funk, fun with elegance. Now, they come forward with a brand new recipe for their third studio album.\n\n\"BREAD is pure energy,\" said Hawley-Weld in a press release. \"Literally, carbs. That's exactly what we want our music to do. When you put on the album, we want it to give you energy.\" Halpern added, \"We didn't know when we wrote the song ‘Bread’ that it was going to feel like a thesis statement for the album, and we didn't know that was going to be the name of the album initially, but as we were discussing, it became clearer and clearer that what we wanted to say to the world is: the world can be dark but it's also a really fun place.\"\n\nTo get a hint of the BREAD vibes, tune in to singles \"Hey Homie,\" \"Spiral,\" and the cheeky \"Throw Some Ass.\" Then, catch Sofi Tukker live on their world tour starting September in Oceania, North America, and Europe.\n\nFontaines D.C. — 'Romance' (Aug. 23)\n\nFollowing their acclaimed 2022 album Skinty Fia, Irish band Fontaines D.C. are gearing up to release their fourth LP, Romance. This is the post-punk ensemble’s first album under XL Recordings, and first album with producer James Ford, but it’s said to be their \"most assured, inventive, and sonically adventurous\" yet, according to a press release.\n\n\"We’ve always had this sense of idealism and romance,\" said guitarist Conor Deegan of the upcoming record. \"Each album gets further away from observing that through the lens of Ireland, as directly as [debut album] Dogrel. The second album [A Hero’s Death] is about that detachment, and the third [Skinty Fia] is about Irishness dislocated in the diaspora. Now we look to where and what else there is to be romantic about.\"\n\nRomance’s 11 tracks boast many inspirations — not all of them romantic per se. Frantic lead single \"Starburster,\" for example, was inspired by a panic attack that vocalist Grian Chatten suffered at London’s St. Pancras station. Aside from that, other references include the dystopian anime Akira, singer Shygirl, Prodigy, Sega Bodega, and more.\n\nFontaines D.C. will kick off a world tour starting September in the U.S. and Canada, and then head on to Europe and the UK throughout December.\n\nZedd — 'TELOS' (Aug. 30)\n\nThis month also marks the return of German DJ and producer Zedd, who will release his first LP in nearly a decade, TELOS. Described in a press release as a \"profound listening experience,\" the album was crafted in hopes to create deep bonds with the audience. \"I wanted everyone to be able to feel a deeper emotional connection, like how I felt listening to my favorite albums when I was growing up. It was the details, transitions and cohesiveness that made me want to create a truly meaningful body of work,\" said Zedd.\n\nLead single \"Out Of Time\" has been in the works since 2015, and is still one of Zedd’s favorite compositions. \"I made an intro for my live show based on this chord progression, but was never able to finish it,\" he said. \"Bea [Miller] was the missing piece of the puzzle; her voice added an emotional depth that completed the song. \"Out Of Time\" really encapsulates the DNA of the Telos album, which is why I chose it to be the song that introduces this new era.\"\n\nFans will be able to check out how this new era sounds live starting September, as Zedd just announced his TELOS North American tour. Starting in Los Angeles, he will play 18 shows throughout 10 cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, and Dallas.\n\nA$AP Rocky — 'Don’t Be Dumb' (Aug. 30)\n\nOne of 2024’s most awaited releases, A$AP Rocky’s fourth LP, Don’t Be Dumb, will finally drop at the end of the month. It’s been six years since the New Yorker put out his last full effort, Testing, and several changes happened in his life since — including becoming a father to two sons with his partner, Rihanna.\n\nIn a 2023 interview for Dazed, Lord Flacko affirmed that the album feels like his \"best work yet,\" and that he wants to \"leave expectations wide and open. I don’t want to tell you what to expect. I just want people to experience it how they do naturally.\"\n\nDon’t Be Dumb has been teased for a long time, and Rocky previewed three unreleased songs off it at his Rolling Loud performance in July 2023. It is also preceded by singles \"S—in’ Me,\" \"Same Problems?,\" and Pharrell Williams-produced \"RIOT (Rowdy Pipe’n),\" although there’s no confirmation if they will end up on the final tracklist.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nHaters take note: nothing fires up a country boy like HARDY more than a naysayer. And this redneck has a long memory.\n\nDespite the coveted catalog of country music hits to his credit — tunes he wrote for artists like Florida Georgia Line, Blake Shelton and Morgan Wallen, plus his own work as a solo artist — HARDY's third album begins with a three-minute response to a heckler who once left a nasty note in his jar in place of a tip.\n\nThat moment may have occurred a decade ago, but it's key to HARDY's defiant persona. In fact, the album's title is exactly what that note read — Quit!! — and its cover art is the actual napkin the message was written on, which the singer/songwriter has held on to all these years.\n\nHARDY laughs off the memory at first, but as the title track plays on, his olive branch soon turns to coal. \"I'm not the GOAT, I'm the black sheep hell-bent to find closure,\" he barks as the song escalates. \"I can't let go — a note somebody wrote like ten years ago put a chip on my shoulder. If you wanted me to quit, you should've saved it, bro.\"\n\nThe takeaway here? HARDY won't quit. Or, to quote another Quit!! banger, \"I DON'T MISS,\" when a hit is in the crosshairs, he \"don't hit nothing but the bull's eye.\"\n\nNo doubt, he has the numbers to back it up. HARDY linked up with Florida Georgia Line after moving to Nashville in the 2010s, and landed his first country No. 1 as a songwriter in 2018 thanks to the duo and Wallen, with the smash \"Up Down.\" As he began building a solo career — releasing a pair of EPs in 2018 (This Ole Boy) and 2019 (Where to Find Me) — he continued delivering chart-topping hits for FGL, Shelton, LOCASH, Wallen, Dierks Bentley, and more. As Quit!! arrives, HARDY boasts 15 No. 1 hits: 11 as a songwriter, and four as an artist.\n\nAlong the way, HARDY also established his Hixtape series, a countrified version of a hip-hop mixtape now three volumes deep, bringing together friends and superstars like Keith Urban, Trace Adkins, Thomas Rhett and a host of other stars to collaborate. Not only did Hixtape Vol. 1 land HARDY his first No. 1 as an artist in his own right — the Lauren Alaina and Devin Dawson team-up \"ONE BEER\" — but it put HARDY's shapeshifting musicality front and center.\n\n\"A lot of people ask, 'When did you decide to jump into the rock and roll thing?' HARDY, who uses his last name as his stage name, says. \"I feel like I've always dipped my toes in it here and there, and a lot of my songs have been really close to it but not quite there. Hixtape, especially Vol. 1, I was definitely foreshadowing my sound, and I really didn't even know it at the time.\"\n\nBy now, modern country musicians regularly reflect influences from beyond Nashville's confines. But HARDY has played a big role in rock's country crossover, as he gradually showed more of his Mississippi-bred, guitar-riffing roots on his 2020 debut album, A ROCK. He fully embraced them on the 2023 double album, the mockingbird & THE CROW; while the first half has more country-oriented tunes like the Lainey Wilson-featuring murder ballad \"wait in the truck,\" he lets loose on THE CROW.\n\n\"THE CROW will always be that cornerstone moment that defined who I am,\" he asserts. \"It gave me the courage to do this Quit!! record.\"\n\nHARDY has not only been an architect of this genre blending, but also its chief proponent — so much that in 2023, the L.A. Times crowned him \"Nashville's nu-metal king.\" On Quit!!, he cashes in that currency with the gargantuan guitar riffs and bombastic beats popularized by acts like Limp Bizkit, and leans deeper into the rhythms and playful lyricism of hip-hop, a skill he recently flexed at the request of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre on a hicked-up rendition of Snoop Dogg's G-funk classic \"Gin and Juice.\"\n\nIronically, the further HARDY gets from straightforward country music, the closer he gets to who he really is as an artist. Below, the chart-topping star details the backstory of Quit!!, his conflicted relationship with the country-music formula, and how he'll continue pushing boundaries within the genre and beyond.\n\nYou grew up in the small town of Philadelphia, Mississippi. What role did music play in your upbringing?\n\nMy dad introduced me to rock and roll in general, but it was his era of rock and roll. Whatever you define as classic rock and everything under that umbrella. But music was a big deal in Philadelphia and it still is. There were tons of cover bands, and a lot of [my] buddies were into music. So that had a big influence on me.\n\nI, thankfully, was in that last era of kids that the only time they got to hear a song was on MTV or on the radio. And I remember hearing \"In the End\" [by] Linkin Park, and then getting Hybrid Theory on CD. I remember the first time I saw [Limp Bizkit's] \"Nookie\" video on MTV. I was heavily influenced by all that stuff. I'm very thankful that I grew up in the era before the internet was really big.\n\nWere you into country music back then?\n\nSurprisingly, not at all. Not until Eric Church, Brad Paisley, a couple of people started singing about stuff that really piqued my interest. But no, I didn't really listen to much country.\n\nI think the only country that I listened to, if you even call it that, was Charlie Daniels. He played at the Neshoba County Fair. I got to see him twice. But even he was more of, like, you'd almost call it more Southern rock. For some reason, country music at the time didn't do it for me. It took me a long time to get into it.\n\nYou recently re-envisioned \"Gin and Juice.\" Were Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre big artists for you when you were younger?\n\nYeah, especially Snoop. Snoop was in his later years when he started doing more pop stuff. I was a little too young for Doggystyle. I was 4 years old when Doggystyle came out, so my folks weren't letting me listen to that. But I will say, [Dr. Dre's 1992 album] The Chronic and especially [1999's] Chronic II, those records were huge. And anything that Dre touched after that, like all the beats he produced for 50 Cent, and obviously I'm a huge Eminem fan. I mean, all the way up to Kendrick [Lamar]'s early stuff.\n\nI don't know how much they influenced me musically, but I definitely listened to both of them at the time.\n\nYou've got so many projects and co-writes and stuff going on, always. Is it easy to pinpoint where your journey to Quit!! began?\n\nI can tell you for a stone-cold fact that \"BOOTS\" [from A ROCK] is responsible for the album Quit!! That was the first song that I ever wrote that had a breakdown in it. And when I played that live before it came out, people didn't know it, so it was a little different then. But once the song came out, and we started playing it live, it was bigger than \"ONE BEER.\" It was bigger than \"REDNECKER.\" It was the biggest song in our set, and to this day, it's still one of the biggest songs in the set.\n\nBut because I love the rock and roll sound so much, that's the song that I was like, Okay, this is working, because these people are losing their s— when we go into this song. So, then, that inspired me to write \"SOLD OUT,\" and once \"SOLD OUT\" came out, and we started playing that song, that song was even bigger than \"BOOTS,\" and it was heavier than \"BOOTS.\" After \"SOLD OUT,\" it was \"JACK,\" and it's just a snowball of writing heavier songs and having the courage to keep going. \"BOOTS\" crawled so that Quit!! could run, you know? That was definitely the song that started it all.\n\nThe new album builds on the mockingbird & THE CROW and the direction you were heading.\n\nYeah, I think it builds on it maybe in the sense that there's a lot more screams, and maybe more breakdowns, and it's a little heavier than the mockingbird & THE CROW at times. But it is also very different. There's a lot more, like, pop-punk stuff and, I don't even know what you would call it, post-hardcore-sounding s—.\n\nBut all of the rock and roll stuff stands on the shoulders of THE CROW. It will always be that cornerstone moment that defined who I am. I mean, it definitely teed me up. It gave me the courage to do this Quit!! record.\n\nI like that word, courage. It's not a word I expected to hear out of you based on your persona, but that's a very interesting way to phrase it.\n\nNo, I mean, the metal and country cultures are very, very, very different. There's never fear, but there's definitely, what's the right way to say that? You know, there's like when we throw like the goat horns and s— on the screen. Country has a big Christian background, and metal is like the exact opposite of that, and those can clash a lot, but there's definitely a little bit of some reserve — it seems to not get too much push back — mixing the two. My mom's not crazy about it, but what can you do?\n\nAnd you have moments like \"wait in the truck,\" where you're not writing for the party. Do you see yourself pursuing those avenues more often? Does the world want to hear HARDY reflect?\n\nYou mean like more of the deeper country stuff?\n\nCorrect, yeah.\n\nI hope. That's the s— I love. I feel like they're so few and far between. Like, \"wait in the truck,\" we just got so lucky. I feel like \"ONE BEER\" was kind of the same. Like, it's gotta be the right day, and the right time, and the right people in the room to really tell a story. It's tough. But I would love to continue to have those cool story songs.\n\nBut what I will say is there's a lot of gray area between the black-and-white of HARDY country and HARDY rock and roll. I'm still going to put out country songs. The gray area is that to me and to a lot of people, they're all just HARDY songs. But I have so many songs that I have written that I wanna put out that are so, maybe if they're not storylines, they're even deeper down the rabbit hole of thought-provoking stuff, like \"A ROCK,\" or maybe even \"wait in the truck,\" or even a song I have called \"happy,\" on the last record — just songs that are very, very thought-provoking.\n\nJust trying to push my own boundaries of country music, and not everything is right down the gut, you know, \"let's go to radio with it.\" But just really trying to experiment with what I wanna say with country music. So, yes, there's definitely more of that coming.\n\nYou're playing your first headlining stadium gig in September. How has performing in those venues, and anticipating that, informed how you write? Are you writing for the stage?\n\nYeah, 100 percent. I would say, 75 percent of the time you're writing for the stage — even if it's not for myself, if I'm writing for somebody else — I'm definitely writing for the stage. I cannot tell you how many times I've sat in the room and been like, This s— is going to pop off live! And then try to put the other writers in that headspace.\n\nLike on [Quit!! track] \"JIM BOB,\" when we did the pow-pow-pow! thing, I'm like, just think about how cool it's gonna be live, and living in that headspace, because that's where it all comes to life. That's the end product.\n\nWriting for the stage is something that a lot of people do. And that's why songwriters love going out on the road, is because they go out and they write songs with these artists, but they love watching the show because they get to see what really translates live, and then take that back to the writing room and try to recreate that.\n\nDid that kind of experience have anything to do with you making the move to a marquee artist? Because not all songwriters can make that jump. Or was that always the plan?\n\nYeah, I mean, it was always that kind of thing. I was fortunate that I got to see Morgan [Wallen] perform \"Up Down,\" and FGL perform a couple of their songs before I made the jump into an artist. I kind of already scratched that itch a little bit.\n\nThe Nashville writing scene can seem like a 9-to-5 kind of boring thing. But it doesn't sound that way from the way you describe it.\n\nIt's a little bit of both. The funny thing about that is like, if you walk into a publishing company, 10:30, 11 o'clock, whenever people start getting there, it's a bunch of dudes or girls standing around drinking coffee, hanging out. It's like a break room, and then everybody's like, \"All right, well, y'all get a good one.\" And then everybody goes into their own rooms. That part of it is very 9 to 5.\n\nBut there is definitely — especially with our group of people, when you get on something that is so special, it's beyond, like, \"We're writing a hit today.\" There's just something that transcends that. I don't know how to describe it, man. That's when it's really, really, really, really great. The Nashville process, that's what it's all about — having those moments in the room where you're like, \"This is special,\" and, like, \"We're witnessing something special that is going to affect people on a global or on a nationwide scale.\"\n\nI remember when we wrote \"wait In the truck\" and how we were all just gassing each other up because we were like, \"Dude, this song is gonna help a lot of people.\" And that's when the 9 to 5 goes away. We're being creative together, and it's a special thing.\n\nThere's been so many moments like that, where you're just so thankful to be a part of a great song, and how hyped everybody is. It's a feeling that's really, really hard to beat.\n\nMore Of The Latest Country Music & News\n\nWith the arrival of July, half of 2024 is already behind us. It's been a remarkable, prolific year in music, with notables like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and even Paul McCartney's band, Wings, making brand new comebacks. The artists releasing albums in the coming months will have to strive to keep up the pace — but judging by July's upcoming blossoms, this won't be an issue.\n\nThe month will start strong with Megan Moroney's sophomore LP, Am I Okay?, Sturgill Simpson (now Johnny Blue Skies)'s Passage du Desir, OneRepublic's Artificial Paradise, and John Summit's debut, Comfort in Chaos. Later on, 5SOS's drummer Ashton Irwin will bring forth the second part of his sophomore solo, Blood on the Drums, alt-R&B star BLK ODYSSY will unveil the concept album 1-800-FANTASY, and rock legends Deep Purple will come forward with their twenty-third LP, =1. Alt-pop duo Cults will return with their fifth album, To The Ghosts, and 2023's revelation Ice Spice will also drop her long-awaited debut, Y2K!.\n\nBelow, GRAMMY.com crafted an exciting list with 15 unmissable albums coming out July 2024.\n\nHARDY — 'Quit!!' (July 12)\n\nAlmost a decade ago, country rockstar HARDY found a napkin with the word \"quit\" in his tip jar. In 2024, the napkin became history as the Philadelphia singer named his upcoming record after it. \"Thank you for inspiring me to be great. I guess sometimes holding a grudge is a good thing,\" wrote HARDY on social media.\n\nQuit!! is HARDY's first LP fully embracing rock music, and follows 2023's the mockingbird & THE CROW. Comprising 13 tracks, the album features Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith, Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, and rising star Knox. HARDY also shared a slew of singles ahead, including \"Six Feet Under (Caleigh's Song)\" and \"Psycho.\"\n\nThe genre-bending artist has just headlined CMA Fest in Nashville, Tennessee, and is currently touring the U.S. throughout the summer.\n\nCassadee Pope — 'Hereditary' (July 12)\n\nMore than 10 years after winning \"The Voice Season 3,\" Cassadee Pope has journeyed plenty of roads — from pop punk to country, and now back again. Her upcoming studio album, Hereditary, is due July 12 and marks her first release after deciding to leave country music.\n\nPope said in a statement that Hereditary \"offers a soundtrack to navigate the complexities of life with authenticity and courage.\" Her first full-length work since 2021's Thrive, the album is also \"an emotional rollercoaster ride through the ups and downs of life, love, and self-discovery,\" where each track is imbued with history. The title Hereditary, according to the statement, \"captures the essence of our roots, the echoes of our past, and the quest to carve our own path.\"\n\nIn preparation for the release, Pope shared singles \"Eye Contact,\" \"Three of Us,\" and \"I Died\" with Daisha McBride. The Hey Monday alum will also launch a North American tour with The Foxies and Natalia Taylar, starting July 11 in Anaheim, California.\n\nMegan Moroney — 'Am I Okay?' (July 12)\n\nFollowing the breakout success of her 2023 debut record, Lucky, professional emo cowgirl Megan Moroney will be back in just a few weeks with her sophomore effort, Am I Okay? According to a statement, the album provides \"an up-close look at the life-changing pain of heartbreak and the glory of moving on.\"\n\nMoroney is said to \"light up\" each of the LP's 14 tracks with her \"signature balance of raw emotional honesty and warmhearted sensitivity.\" \"I think after every song, [a] fair question would be, ‘Is she OK?' Whether it's good or bad,\" Moroney told ABC audio about the title of the project. \"At the beginning, you're like, 'Am I OK?' And then, by the end, it's like, ‘Oh, I don't think she is.'\"\n\nThe \"Tennessee Orange\" singer already shared four tracks from the album, including \"No Caller ID,\" \"Man on the Moon,\" \"Indifferent,\" and \"28th of June.\" Currently, Moroney is opening for Kenny Chesney's Sun Goes Down tour.\n\nSturgill Simpson (Johnny Blue Skies) — 'Passage du Desir' (July 12)\n\nSturgill Simpson will mark the beginning of a new era under the moniker Johnny Blue Skies, after fulfilling his promise to release only five studio albums under his own name with 2020's projects Cuttin' Grass Vol. 2. His first oeuvre is the LP Passage Du Desir, set to come out on July 12.\n\nThe album includes eight songs, all produced by Johnny Blue Skies and David Ferguson, and was recorded at both Clement House Recording Studio in Nashville and the iconic Abbey Road Studios in London. Passage Du Desir also marks his first project since 2021's The Ballad of Dood and Juanita.\n\nFans will be able to meet Johnny Blue Skies for the first time on a lengthy tour titled Why Not? this fall. Some of the stops include Nashville, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, two nights in Toronto, and Boston.\n\nOneRepublic — 'Artificial Paradise' (July 12)\n\nOneRepublic's upcoming album, Artificial Paradise, was inspired by the digital paradigm that we live in now. \"So many of these songs were written in the last couple years while we navigated a world full of artificial stories and constructs and paradise,\" shared frontman Ryan Tedder on Instagram. \"All around the world and people's digitally broadcasted lives and the lives that we create for ourselves and the stories that we tell ourselves and others.\"\n\nAccording to Tedder, the album comprises 15 tracks written over the last eight years \"that didn't quite make sense together.\" Hence, previously released singles like \"I Don't Wanna Wait\" with David Guetta, \"Nobody\" off the anime series Kaiju No. 8, and \"West Coast\" are already well known by fans.\n\nArtificial Paradise is the GRAMMY-nominated group's first release since 2021's Human, and precedes a three-day weekend of shows in Colorado Springs, CO, and a string of festival appearances including Summer Sonic Tokyo in Japan, Lollapalooza Berlin in Germany, and Rock in Rio in Brazil. \"Amidst all of that artificiality, we are trying to find real connection and real love, and a real story,\" concludes Tedder.\n\nJohn Summit — 'Comfort in Chaos' (July 12)\n\nTo put forward his debut album, Comfort in Chaos, dance music phenomenon John Summit had to dive deep into himself. \"John Summit is the performing act, but when I write music I get more vulnerable,\" he shared in a statement. \"While writing this album, I had to go from being in the mindset of John Summit to being John Schuster, my real name.\"\n\nComfort in Chaos arrives after a run of hit singles included in the tracklist, namely \"Eat the Bass,\" \"Go Back\" with Sub Focus and Julia Church, and the Hayla-featuring duets \"Where You Are\" and \"Shiver.\" Described as his \"most introspective\" and \"emotional\" work to date, Summit took the LP's 12 nifty tracks to expand his Chicago house foundations into genres like garage and drum & bass.\n\nAfter stellar headline shows at Coachella and sold-out performances at Los Angeles' BMO Stadium and New York City's Madison Square Garden, 2024 is already a pivotal year for the Illinois-born sensation, and Comfort in Chaos arrives to consolidate his impact. As for summer and fall, Summit is booked for 26 shows and festival appearances scheduled around the world, with more to be announced.\n\nGirl Ultra — 'blush' (July 12)\n\nIf you're in need of some early 2000s nostalgia, Mexican singer Girl Ultra — real name Mariana de Miguel — is coming out with her fourth EP, blush, on July 12. Inspired by R&B, club music, and trip hop sounds of the new millennium, the album comprises seven tracks that follow de Miguel's \"need for experimentation\" and lush artistry.\n\n\"I wanted short energetic tracks, and in lyrical terms, I was trying to find very precise messages about sadness, femininity and lust that inhabit these current times,\" she explained further in a statement. Singles \"blu,\" \"blush,\" and \"rimel\" exemplify that atmosphere, tackling beauty rituals with a touch of melancholy and yearning. Overall, blush is described as a plunge \"into the complex dynamics of self-image and sexuality with a poignant touch of bitterness.\"\n\nAfter opening for Julieta Venegas in her hometown of Mexico City and performing at Coachella this year, Girl Ultra is set to support Chromeo and The Midnight on a U.S. tour this fall.\n\nClairo — 'Charm' (July 12)\n\nAs the popular saying goes, \"third time is the charm\" — and so singer/songwriter Clairo (a.k.a Claire Cottrill) decided the title of her third studio album. Charm will arrive on July 12, and was produced by Clairo and Leon Michels of El Michels Affair.\n\nWith the announcement, Clairo shared the delicate single \"Sexy to Someone,\" as well as a tracklist with 11 songs. Like her previous LP, 2021's Sling, Charm was recorded in New York's Diamond Mine Recording and Allaire Studios, but this time she tracked it live-to-tape.\n\nIn September, Clairo will kickstart separate five-day residencies in both Los Angeles and New York. Further concert dates are expected.\n\nOrquesta Akokán — 'Caracoles' (July 12)\n\nSince 2018, Orquesta Akokán have brought mambo to the spotlight, honoring its roots and infusing it with fresh twists. \"Akokán\" is a Cuban Yoruba word meaning \"from the heart,\" and such is the thread underlining all of their work. Following their 2018's eponymous debut and 2021's 16 Rayos, the Cuban music enthusiasts are now ready to put forward Caracoles, out July 12.\n\nFor their third LP, producer Jacob Plasse and composer Michael Eckroth combined talents with renowned Cuban singer/songwriter Kiko Ruiz. The result is a danceable, uplifting record that fuses classic and modern traditions. According to a press release, \"yes, it's mambo, with its prototypical instrumentation and structures, but these songs belong one hundred percent to 2024.\" As Ruiz said, Caracoles can \"...vibrate your soul, which is precisely what the world needs right now.\"\n\nAshton Irwin — 'Blood On The Drums (The Roses)' (July 17)\n\n\"I love to make full length albums, but also the idea of the listener digesting it in two parts initially, forming their own interpretation,\" said Ashton Irwin, drummer of pop-rock band 5 Seconds of Summer (5SOS), in a press release about his sophomore solo album. \"It's important to me, as a fan of music, to have a comprehensive body of work to fully dig into the artist's perspective.\"\n\nFollowing 2020's Superbloom, Blood On The Drums is divided in two installments: Side 1, dubbed The Thorns, came out on June 12, and Side 2, The Roses, is set for release on July 17. Totaling 16 tracks, the LP blends 80s-inspired melodies with classic rock, experimental pop, and more, as it traverses Irwin's highs and lows. \"I was thinking about the people I left behind, the people I miss, the family that I had to leave when I was young,\" the Australian musician shared. \"Thinking about the addictions I've been through. The way I evolved as a young man who never had a father.\"\n\nThe title of the album is intended to be \"a metaphor for how much I've given my music,\" said Irwin. To celebrate the release, he will play a single show at Los Angeles' The Belasco on July 18.\n\nHighly Suspect — 'As Above, So Below' (July 19)\n\nThe Massachusetts rockers of Highly Suspect are gearing up to release their fifth full-length album, As Above, So Below. Following 2022's The Midnight Demon Club, the band opted to tone down the electronic elements and embrace a more psychedelic, stoner rock sound, as can be heard on pre-release track \"Summertime Voodoo.\"\n\n\"If my life is a book, then this album is the first chapter that truly addresses the central conflict,\" frontman Johnny Stevens said in a press statement. \"The recognition of an ego, the problems it's caused — and the birth of its death. ‘As Above, So Below.' If I'm being real, I hit rock bottom again. After another close call with death, I feel wide awake. I don't know how the book ends yet, but I'm very engaged in the plot now. I'd rather it not end at all.\"\n\nTo celebrate, Highly Suspect will play the new album in its entirety in an intimate, seven-city U.S. Tour, kicking off on July 24 in Memphis, Tennessee and wrapping up on August 2 in Brooklyn.\n\nDeep Purple — '=1' (July 19)\n\nFew bands get to release 23 albums, and for that fact alone, Deep Purple deserve praise. It does help that they are rock legends in their own right, therefore, =1 comes as a sweet, inspiring surprise.\n\nPaired with acclaimed producer Bob Ezrin once again, =1 sees the British band evoke their classic sound \"without relying on nostalgia,\" according to a statement. They promise to bring \"rip-roaring rock n' roll\" in 13 energetic tracks, and a taste of what's to come can be seen in singles \"Portable Door\" and \"Pictures of You.\" It is also the band's first album with guitarist Simon McBride, who joined the band after member Steve Morse left due to personal circumstances in 2022.\n\nThe title =1 symbolizes the idea that, in a complex world, everything eventually equals one. In that communal spirit, Deep Purple is set for an extensive tour, starting with European dates in July, North and South American shows in September, and back with more European dates throughout November.\n\nBLK ODYSSY — '1-800-FANTASY' (July 19)\n\n\"The album is a concept album where we get into the world of Afro-surrealism with a high school kid who's madly in love with a popular girl, but she really has no idea he exists,\" explained BLK ODYSSY about his upcoming album, 1-800-FANTASY, in an interview with BET. \"He understands that she's out of his league but he is dedicated to proving to her that he's worthy of her attention and her love.\"\n\n1-800-FANTASY follows that story while dipping into themes of mental health and self-control. \"He creates these characters in his head to justify his crazy actions that he goes through to get her attention,\" BLK said, adding that that's where the album's \"angsty sound\" comes from. So far, a preview of that atmosphere can be seen in singles \"XXX\" with Wiz Khalifa, and a live performance of \"Phase\" at A Colors Show.\n\nBorn Juwan Elcock in New Jersey, he cites Kendrick Lamar, D'Angelo, and Outkast as influences to his own brand of alt-R&B and hip hop. \"Whether it's me as an artist, or me as a producer, it is a very cinematic sound,\" he shared. \"And it's a very theatrical sound, I like to take elements from what the human perceives as real life and put it in my music.\"\n\nBLK will promote the album in his The Fantasy House tour this summer, starting off in North America and following up with European dates.\n\nIce Spice — 'Y2K!' (July 26)\n\nOne of last year's biggest revelations, GRAMMY-nominated rapper Ice Spice will finally release her debut LP, Y2K!. Titled as a nod to her birthdate (1st January 2000), the long-awaited effort comes after 2023's acclaimed EP Like..?, and was co-produced by longtime collaborator RIOTUSA.\n\nIce Spice has been keeping the 10-song tracklist a mystery, though, and so far shared only three singles: \"Think U The Shit (Fart),\" \"Gimmie A Light\" (which samples Sean Paul's similarly titled \"Gimme the Light\"), and \"Phat Butt.\" In an interview with \"The Today Show\", she also revealed to have locked in a \"crazy collaboration,\" and to have experimented with \"a lot of different sounding beats that I haven't really been heard on much.\"\n\nStarting July, the Bronx native will be busy with a handful of performances at European Festivals, followed up by a 17-date North American tour in August.\n\nCULTS — 'To The Ghosts' (July 26)\n\nMadeline Follin and Brian Oblivion have been making soft alt-pop music as the duo Cults for over a decade now. July brings forth yet another of their magical offerings: fifth studio album To The Ghosts, out via IMPERIAL on July 26.\n\nThe first ideas for the album sprung up during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"when they wrote music on weekdays from 10am-5pm with no deadlines or distractions,\" says a press release. To The Ghosts was recorded at Oblivion's apartment, and co-produced by trusted collaborator Shane Stoneback. The New York duo shared singles \"Crybaby\" and \"Left My Keys\" in advance. Of the latter, Oblivion stated that \"With this being To the Ghosts, ‘Left My Keys' is dedicated to the ghost of your high school memories with an element of fondness.\"\n\nCults will kick off a headline North American tour in August, followed by a month-long stint as the opening act for Vampire Weekend's Only God Was Above Us tour.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos"
