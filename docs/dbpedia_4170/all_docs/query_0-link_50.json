Azoff tells HITS: \"It was important to promote Richard because he’s the only one left around here whose name ends in a vowel, and we needed a new target for the L.A. Times.\"\n\nJuly, 1989: Shortly after Fine Young Cannibals’ The Raw and the Cooked, Bobby Brown’s Don’t Be Cruel and Tom Petty’s Full Moon Fever grab the top three places on the album charts, Azoff resigns from MCA Records to form WB-distributed Giant Records, replaced by his hand-picked choice, ex-Columbia Records President Al Teller, who retains EVP/GM Palmese as his #2.\n\n1991: Azoff brings his Giant into the fold of WB (who saw it as a replacement for the outgoing Geffen label, which had moved to Universal), scoring hits with Color Me Badd and Disturbed, while also releasing records by Steely Dan, Deep Purple, Oingo Boingo, Kenny Rogers, Air Supply, Pat McGee Band, Owsley and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Their best-selling album was the New Jack City soundtrack, which sold 16 million copies in the U.S. under urban head Cassandra Mills.\n\n1993: Giant switches distribution outside U.S. to BMG from WEA, releases band’s award-winning country tribute album, Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles.\n\n1994: Eagles reunite to record Hell Freezes Over, go on tour.\n\n1999: Azoff serves as a producer on Hurricane, the story of boxer Ruben “Hurricane” Carter, with Denzel Washington earning an Oscar nomination in the title role.\n\n2000: Azoff signs Christina Aguilera and Seal as management clients.

The pair join forces after Thomas H. Lee Partners’ Scott Sperling and Bain Capital, two of the principles in Edgar Bronfman Jr.’s acquisition of Warner Music Group, fund a $200 million+ investment in the management company headed by Azoff, who then acquires Kaufman’s HK.\n\nOct. 2006: Eagles announce an exclusive distribution deal with Wal-Mart for their next album.\n\n2007: Pollstar names Azoff Personal Manager of the Year.\n\nNov. 2007: Eagles debut at #1 on the album chart with 714k albums sold at Wal-Mart and online for their album, Long Road Out of Eden.\n\nMarch 2008: Azoff and Andy Gould negotiate an exclusive Best Buy deal for Guns N’ Roses’ upcoming Chinese Democracy album, their first new studio release in more than 16 years.\n\nMay 2008: Front Line expands to more than 200 acts and a management team that grows to include Paul Geary, Jared Paul, Damien Smith, Alejandro Asensi, John Baruck, Tom Consolo, Dan Field, Mark Adelman, Dana Dufine, Jordan Feldstein, Brian Doyle, Rob Kos, Craig Fruin, Trudy Green, Sheryl Louis, Bobby Collin, Jason Morey, Jim Morey, Scott Siman, Clarence Spalding, Dan Dalton, Peter Asher, Ron Gillyard, Marion Kraft, Simon Renshaw, Steve Feinberg, Joel Hoffner, Susan Markheim, Ken Levitan, Jack Rovner, Pete Galli and Blaze James, among others.\n\nJuly 2008: Advertising Age names Azoff Marketer of the Year."
