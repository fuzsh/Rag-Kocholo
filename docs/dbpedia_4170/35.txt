It's the courage of the pioneers who crossed a continent's span

It's the spirit of the red men who shed their blood to save their land

It's the will to know the truth, good or bad, come what may

It's a heart that's free and grateful, it's the Cowboy Way

It's the strength to say you're sorry, to admit that you were wrong

It's the wisdom, too, to recognize the time you must be strong

It's a love of nature's creatures in their struggle and their play

It's the quite flame of justice, it's the Cowboy Way

It's the hand to help a neighbor or a stranger in their need

It's the love of humankind with not a thought of race or creed

It's the courage of convictions, without posture or display

It's the peaceful sleep of children, it's the Cowboy Way

It's the moment that you take before the words you might regret

It's the time you give to others with no thought of what you'll get

It's the time you take in smelling all the roses on the way

It's doing just the best you can

It's the Cowboy Way
