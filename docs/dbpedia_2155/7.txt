The tombs of Ferdinand-Philippe, Duke of Orleans (1810 - 1842) and his Duchess, Hélène de Mecklembourg-Schwerin (1814 - 1858). He was the eldest son of King Louis-Philippe and died tragically in a carriage accident in 1842. His wife died of tuberculosis in 1858 and, as she was a Protestant, was not allowed to be buried in the Catholic chapel. Her tomb was placed in a separate little chapel, accessed by an outside door. The artist Henri Chapu who sculpted her effigy succeeded in reuniting the royal couple by a touching scene whereby the princess joins her husband with the movement of her arm through the window.
