The book I had intended to write was a five-generation study of the house of Orléans, beginning with Monsieur and ending with Philippe Egalité in the late eighteenth century. It was to have focused primarily on the finances and estate management of the princes. I had not anticipated being especially interested in or sympathetic to any of the five, with\n\nthe possible exception of the famous and talented regent, son of Monsieur. My preconceived ideas of Monsieur, based as they were on casual acquaintance with contemporary memoirs and secondary accounts of the period, were unflattering, to say the least. To me he was a kind of freakish decoration of Versailles or court buffoon. A homosexual living in a society that regarded homosexuality with contempt and loathing, he was alternately pitied and despised by his brother, the king. These views began to change when | undertook the study of the\n\nestate management and finances of the house of Orléans as recorded in the recently available family archives. To my astonishment, | discovered that the foundation of the vast fortune of the family was laid down in the time of Monsieur, by him or his council,\n\nor both. This was the wealth that subsequently enabled the family to achieve its independence from the Crown and to influence the course of French history. Then there was the Battle of Cassel, at which Monsieur defeated the combined Spanish-Dutch forces of X111\n\nPREFACE\n\nWilliam of Orange in the Dutch War. How could so insignificant a prince have led a French army to victory? Perhaps, I began to think, Philippe deserved a closer look.\n\nAt that point the appeal of Monsieur’s personality and the uniqueness of his position in the court of the Sun King asserted themselves. Younger brother of the most powerful king France has ever known, the prince was perceived as a threat to the throne and was deliberately thrust into the background. An intelligent, gifted man, he could not be permitted to excel and was with few excep-\n\ntions denied honorable service to the Crown. Only two years younger than Louis, he was the perpetual loser in a lifelong sibling rivalry. His life was the classic history of an underdog, a term that\n\nmight have made its way to the title page of this book had such colloquialisms been appropriate in a scholarly publication.\n\nMonsieur has no previous biographer in English. The only biographer of him in the French language has written with much grace but, having designed his book for the general public, he confined his research primarily to memoirs of the period.' The present study of the prince is the first to make extensive use of archives and other manuscript sources. The family papers, deposited in the Archives Nationales by the count of Paris, present head of the house of Orléans and available to scholars with his permission, are indispensable for reconstruction of financial management. The archives, manuscript collections, and other resources of the Ministry of War, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bibliotheque Nationale, the Bib-\n\nliothéque Historique de la Ville de Paris, and in London, of the Public Record Office, among other repositories, have helped me to follow the prince as he went to war, built his palaces, married his wives, and fathered a family. With the exception of the Public Rec-\n\nord Office, where are deposited the letters Philippe wrote to his brother-in-law, King Charles II of England, no collection of the prince’s letters is known to exist. Although he wrote them by the hundreds, not many have survived, and those that have are widely scattered. In my quest | feel fortunate to have unearthed not a few that had previously escaped the notice of scholars of the period. The present biography has a psychological dimension, but as any psychohistorian would readily agree, it is not a psychobiography.\n\nTrained as a historian, | have been unwilling to place theory of personality at the axis of my investigation of Philippe’s behavior and character. I have not subordinated factual evidence gathered from contemporary sources of information to a theoretical model or to cognitive assumptions. I have not attempted to make the historical data fit a theoretical procrustean bed. On the other hand, when X1V\n\nPREFACE\n\npsychological theory was compatible with verifiable evidence, | have used it as a tool to increase my understanding. I soon came to realize that in studying an individual so singularly\n\nplaced in society and so deeply demoralized as was Monsieur, the commonsense psychology employed by the conventional biographer would not suffice. The use of psychological theory has, if nothing else, prompted questions that | would otherwise not have thought to ask. It has suggested possibilities that otherwise would have gone unperceived. As a historian, I tend to be a cultural relativist, committed to acknowledging profound differences between centuries, cultures, regions, social classes, and even families. Yet | can agree that to a degree human biological development is more or less timeless. What Freud has called man’s “long childlike helplessness and dependence,” for example, is merely one of the inevitable sociological realities common to mankind in all periods of its history. Without attempting to resolve the controversy between the psychoanalytic reductionist and the historical relativist, | have on occasion resorted to the theory of personality in order to sharpen and broaden my biographer’s sense of reality. Throughout the writing of this book [ have been exceedingly grateful to my colleague formerly at the University of Texas at Austin, Dr. James Bieri, professor of psychology and practicing clinical psychologist, who has\n\nread it in its entirety and given me the benefit of his specialized knowledge. Other colleagues and friends, both in this country and in Europe,\n\nhave generously placed their knowledge and time at my disposal. Ruth Kleinman, professor of history at Brooklyn College, CUNY, and author of the scholarly and perceptive Ann of Austria: Queen of France, read the manuscript in an early stage and helped me enormously to place the prince in proper historical perspective. Several of the themes throughout the work evolved in part from her inspiration. Georges Dethan, associate director of the Archives of the French Foreign Ministry and author of scholarly books on Gaston d’Orléans and Mazarin, guided me through the archives to a number of letters of Monsieur that I might otherwise have missed. Orest Ranum, professor of history at the Johns Hopkins University and a great seventeenth-century specialist, offered wise counsel along the way on solving a variety of archival problems. Virginia Crosby, professor of French literature at Pomona College, who now resides mainly in Paris, helped me especially in the acquisition of prints and in the search for data on the lost chateau of Saint-Cloud. Special thanks are also due Mme Yves Bercé, conservateur of the Bibliothéque du Ministére de la Culture, to Georges Molvinger, secrétaire XV\n\nPREFACE\n\ngénéral adjoint des Amis du Parc de Saint-Cloud, and to Mme André Schmitz, wife of the former conservateur du Domaine National de Saint-Cloud for help in research on the prince’s palaces and chateaus, and to A. D. K. Hawkyard in London for furthering my research in the Public Record Office. Throughout the several years of preparation of this manuscript, the deans of the Graduate School and the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin, William S. Livingstone and Robert D. King, have been generous in affording me financial support and leaves of absence for uninterrupted writing. For encouragement when it was much needed, as well as for medical expertise, | am grateful to my brother, Dr. M. M. Nichols,\n\nprofessor of medicine at the University of Texas at Galveston. My sister-in-law, Margaret Nichols, whose gift for understanding people can scarcely be equaled, and who is no mean stylist, read the entire manuscript to my immense benefit. Always in my thoughts\n\nwas the memory of my late husband, Stephen Barker, without whose love and support I should not have written this or any other book.\n\nXVI\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nONE Brother of Le Dieudonné\n\nTHe New Duke oF ANJOU On Christmas night 1639 Louis XIII, king of France, allegedly startled his court with the order to prepare his bed in the chamber of the queen. The result of this rare conjugal visit was the birth on September 21, 1640, of Philippe, duke of Anjou, later duke of Orléans, founder of the house of Orléans of modern times. The baby prince was the son of the king and the queen, Anne of Austria (so styled owing to her Habsburg lineage) and the younger and only brother of the dauphin, Louis, whose “miraculous” arrival only two years earlier had earned him the epithet le Dieudonné, the gift of God. The succession to the throne, so long in peril, was now doubly assured. The joyful news traveled quickly to Paris, which erupted into celebrations nearly equal to those that had greeted the birth of the dauphin. The bells of the Palais Royal, which sounded only for enfants de France (legitimate children of kings) played a gay carillon;\n\nthe guns of the Arsenal and the Bastille boomed; the city fathers gave official thanks; citizens danced in the streets and lit fires before\n\ntheir portals. A solemn Te Deum was celebrated by the bishop of Meaux at the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. The official Gazette de France wrote fulsomely of the two princes as twin “pillars” on\n\nwhich the future glory of France would rest. Even Louis XII roused from his customary moroseness and joined in the general\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nrejoicing, jubilant to see himself the father of two sons, “he who had feared to have had none at all.” The happy event was a strange contrast to the tormented family history that lay behind it. His Most Christian King Louis XIII and the infanta Dofia Ana Maria Mauricia, daughter of Philip III of Spain, were in their teens when they married in 1615. From the first the relationship was strained and unhappy. The neurasthenic Louis proved a reluctant bridegroom and fulfilled his marital duties with an infrequency that not only dismayed his wife but alarmed the court and ministers, all of whom were keenly aware of the necessity of an heir. Although not overtly homosexual, he was apparently repelled by female contact and on occasion showed unnatural attraction to males at court. Absorbed in his cares as ruler, frequently absent on campaign or on hunting trips, he neglected his wife and at the same time suspected her of all manner of immoral and treasonable conduct. According to contemporary stories, a singular combination of events had been necessary to produce a dauphin for France: the exhortations of the king’s confessor, the good offices of a young nun who urged on Louis the need for reconciliation with his wife, and a rainstorm that caught him far from home and obliged him to accept the queen’s hospitality for the night. Inevitably, there had been amazement and gossip surrounding the circumstances of this birth, which took place eighteen years after the marriage of the parents.\n\nThe birth of a son and heir to the throne consolidated Anne’s position as queen of France but did not noticeably improve her relations with her difficult husband. Despite occasional visits to the marital bed, Louis made her life unhappy by dismissing her friends at court and giving his affections to the young marquis de CingMars, to whom he became strangely attached. Even during Anne’s second pregnancy Louis did not hesitate to cross her, and only a few days before she gave birth he reduced her to tears by threaten-\n\ning to remove the dauphin from her care. | It is true that Anne’s record was not unblemished, even though excuses for it are easy to find. As a foreigner, she found her position at court difficult from the start. Rejected by her husband, who disliked Spaniards, she ran the risk of being repudiated for failing in her duty to provide an heir to the throne. In her predicament, her behavior was at times foolish and indiscreet. Regarding her husband’s chief minister Cardinal Richelieu as her personal enemy, she became involved to one degree or another in plots against him.’ Suspicions mounted against her: her letters to her brother, Philip IV, were accounted treason; her dalliances with the duke of Buck2\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\ningham and others were judged infidelity. A beautiful and exquisitely feminine woman, even her appearance was against her. Moreover, she loved to dance, to gamble, to attend the theater, and even to read ribald literature. She rose late, ate too much rich food, drank too much chocolate, and gave every impression of idleness and frivolity. Worst of all, however, were her alleged conspiracies with Gaston, duke of Orléans, scapegrace younger brother of Louis and, in the continued absence of a dauphin, the immediate heir to the\n\nthrone. Louis deeply suspected the pair of engaging the help of Spain in a plot to place Gaston on the throne and to make Anne his queen once the deed was done. Kings of France had always to be on their guard against rebellious brothers, who more than once had imperiled the royal authority and the unity of the realm. His anger at Anne was the greater because it was strongly tinctured with jealousy of the prince who, lighthearted, debonair, successful with the ladies, was everything the king was not. What woman would not have preferred this charmer to the dour Louis? Moreover, it was\n\nonly too true that Gaston hoped one day to be king and was an inveterate if less than resolute conspirator. With the income from his proprietary possessions, from his large appanage, and from his governorship of the states of Languedoc, Gaston was in a position to mount a formidable challenge to the authority of his brother.’ Yet Anne had a strong, dutiful aspect to her character that deepened with the passage of time. A pious woman with deep moral convictions, she weathered the bleak years before her children were born, outgrew much of her frivolous behavior, and matured into a responsible queen and mother. Neither her religious scruples nor, for that matter, the close surveillance under which she lived would have permitted marital irregularities. No one close to the court ever seriously questioned the paternity of Louis and Philippe. Although her longtime friend and confidant at court, Mme de Motteville, criticized Anne for having defied her husband and opposed Richelieu, she well understood the struggle the queen had gone through: “She was born to make the late king her husband the happiest man in the world, and if he had so wished he no doubt would have been, but that fate that seems always to separate the hearts of sovereigns, came between the king and the queen. The love that she could have given to that prince, she gave to her children.’”* The baby prince was born at the old chateau of Saint-Germain outside Paris in the presence of the king and the great ladies of the court, Mme la Princesse (de Condé), Mme la Connétable (de Montmorency), and the duchess of Vendéme, while crowds of courtiers pressed at the doors. An hour later the infant was baptized privately 3\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nby the bishop of Meaux and received the name of Philippe. Although Louis at first seemed inclined to favor the title of count of Artois, in honor of the recent French victory at Arras in that county, he followed royal tradition in creating his second-born duke of An-\n\njou, the title borne by the brothers of Louis [X (Saint Louis), Charles V, and Charles [X. The new duke was then removed to the apartments prepared for him, where were admitted the ladies and gentlemen of the court.\n\nLike his brother, he was a vigorous and beautiful infant, although, in contrast to the blond dauphin, he had dark eyes and black hair. ‘The princes’ physical health and beauty, it has been suggested, were perhaps the result of their unusual heritage: the cross-\n\ning of genes of the Burgundian Valois, Habsburgs, Medicis, and Bourbon families at fortuitous moments in the past.’ Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, Charles the Bold of Burgundy, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Emperor Charles V and his son Philip I, and the celebrated Bourbon king Henry IV were among their famous ancestors. And\n\nif their father were sickly and short-lived, their mother exuded a vitality and earthy beauty rarely seen in queens of France. As soon as Philippe was born, arrangements were made for his household. Like most royal children of the seventeenth century, he occupied a nursery apart from his parents and his brother, although, being only two years younger than Louis, he shared the same governess. In addition, he had his own assistant governess, wet nurse,\n\nchambermaids, physician, and steward. The only difference between his household and that of the dauphin seems to have been that whereas Philippe had one wet nurse, Louis had two.‘ Like Louis, and in accordance with accepted practice, Philippe would remain in this household in the care of women for some seven years, after which he would be placed under the governance of men. The position of the governess was thus a very important one. She was a respected personage at court and lived in intimacy with the royal family. Her duties were to watch over the health of her charges, to form their tastes and habits, and so far as it was possible with children of that age, to inculcate in them principles of honesty and moral rectitude.’ In thus setting up the households of her children and giving them over to wet nurses, Anne was of course following the accepted practice of her day for royal and other highborn families and was not at liberty to indulge her own inclinations. Even the choice of the allimportant governess was not hers, the position falling to Francoise de Souvré, marquise de Lansac, who had the support of Richelieu and the king. Even so, Anne was far from relinquishing her influ4\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\nence in the nursery, which became the center of existence. Much evidence exists that despite the governesses, the wet nurses, the\n\nservants that might seem to have been a human wall dividing mother from sons—to say nothing of the separate apartments they occupied—she maintained a close and loving relationship with her children. Unlike the king’s mother Marie de Medici, who rarely saw her children, Anne constantly watched over Louis and Philippe. A few months after the birth of the dauphin, an attendant wrote: “The queen hardly leaves him. She takes great pleasure in playing with him and taking him out in her carriage whenever the weather is fine; it is the whole of her amusement.”*® After Philippe appeared, she continued to live a quiet life in the old castle at Saint-Germain with only the exceptional visit to Paris. A few historians cling to the myth that Louis and Philippe were neglected as children and were raised principally by servants of low birth who allowed them to play recklessly and eat unheathfully.? In support of these allegations, except for the superficial testimony of the abbé de Choisy, who played with Philippe as a child, and that of Saint-Simon, who was not yet born when the royal brothers were children, there are only the stories told by Louis XIV to Mme de Maintenon, the companion of his old age. But if the king could recall shabby linen and indigestible treats purloined from the kitchens, not too much faith should be placed in the reminiscences of a septuagenarian. To the contrary, the little princes were continuously surrounded by an attentive staff and watched over by a loving mother, all of whom were quite aware that not only the future of the realm but their own positions at court depended upon the lives and health of their precious charges. If there were danger, especially for Louis, it lay in constant adulation rather than in neglect. Within a year or so of Philippe’s birth, Anne began to think seriously about the education of the princes and consulted a number of learned and pious authorities. One of them, whose identity is not\n\nknown but whose views almost certainly reflected those of the queen, wrote for her a treatise entitled “Maxims of Childhood Education and Direction.” !° It was addressed specifically to the training of the dauphin, but because many of the maxims were of a general nature, they would presumably have applied to Philippe as well. The emphasis was above all on religion and moral development but also included prescriptions for physical health and daily activities. Suggestions were made on the means of explaining to a small child abstractions such as charity, justice, evil, and virtue. He must love God and his parents, for example, because they love him. Evil and sin are those things that displease them and that he must thus avoid. )\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nDevotion he would learn by simple prayers, but above all by the reverent example of his mother and father. Instruction in reading French and even Latin might begin at age five, but such lessons should be brief, informal, and enjoyable. Coercion and threats should be avoided, and praise rather then censure should be used to encourage his efforts. Corporal punishment should be used only as a last resort, since the author believed that a child’s fear of the dis-\n\npleasure of those he loved was more powerful than his fear of a beating as an incentive to improve and to learn. The whole document is noteworthy for its insistence on teaching\n\nby example and has a remarkably modern ring. Very likely it is evidence not only of the sound maternal judgment of the queen but also of the evolution of attitudes toward the treatment of small children that took place during the course of the seventeenth century. '! The author’s appeal to the child’s senses and affection is in marked contrast to the harsh discipline, including brutal beatings, that had been imposed on Louis XIII as a child on the orders of his father Henry IV, who believed that he himself had profited enormously from frequent caning as a boy. And in fact, so far as can be known, neither Louis nor Philippe was systematically beaten, although evidence exists that neither entirely escaped corporal punishment.\n\nLe Petit MONSIEUR Philippe was still a toddler when it became clear that his father had not much longer to live. By the spring of 1643 the king was in the\n\nlast stages of what was probably intestinal tuberculosis, and the deathwatch began. The child could have had no understanding of the portentous events taking place, although possibly he sensed something was amiss from the solemnity of the adults around him and the tenseness of his mother as she alternated visits to the king’s chamber and counsels with the ministers.'? Contemporary accounts\n\nmake little or no mention of Philippe at this time, although they abound with dramatic stories of the young Louis in his last meetings with the dying king. According to one of them, almost certainly apocryphal, when his father asked him his name, the child replied, “Louis XIV.” To which the dying man responded, “No, my son, not yet.” If the anecdote were false, at least it was an accurate reflection of the focus of attention on the heir to the throne as the court waited in suspense for the transition to take place. Except for a farewell visit to his father’s bedside to receive his blessing, 6\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\nPhilippe must have remained out of sight in his apartments with his household. The end came on May 14, 1643. Philippe was not yet three years old—thirty-two months precisely—and Louis was not yet five. The\n\nold order, of which the prince could scarcely have had conscious memory, had passed away to be replaced by the one he would know\n\nto the end of his life. The reign of the Sun King had begun. His mother was now regent; Philippe was now the younger brother of the king and the immediate heir to the throne. Those in court would henceforth refer to him as Monsieur (in fact, he was usually known\n\nas le Petit Monsieur to distinguish him from Gaston). That very night his signature as duke of Anjou, along with those of Anne, Gaston, and other relatives and high dignitaries, was affixed to the death certificate of his father as a guarantee of his recognition of the accession of his brother.\" The new life began immediately as Anne, surrounded by the dig-\n\nnitaries of the court, knelt in homage to her older son, who was now her sovereign. “The king is dead, long live the king.” The next day she left Saint-Germain with her sons and rode with ceremony in an open carriage to Paris.'* As he was to do so many times in the future, Philippe looked on while his brother and mother received the applause of the crowds and the blessings of the clergymen who\n\ngreeted the cavalcade entering the capital. A few days later the child-king made his first official appearance at the At de justice in the\n\nGrand Chamber of Parlement (a high court of law), where he was carried to his high throne by a peer of the realm. Once in Paris Anne faced immediate and formidable problems. Although regent in name, by the terms of her late husband’s will she was severely limited in the exercise of sovereign power. Distrusting his wife to the end, Louis XIII had named Gaston lieutenant general of the realm and had created a council of regency composed of powerful royal relatives and ministers whose decisions were binding on the queen. Where would the new focus of power lie? In theory, of course, it\n\nwas situated in the king, revered as a kind of visible deity. But although he was treated with elaborate respect, as a small child who\n\ncould not yet even write his name, Louis could count for little in reality. The traditional opponents of the Crown—the parlements, especially the Parlement of Paris (possessing the power to register royal decrees, its members, owning their offices, tried to assert the right of judicial review), the provincial governors, and others of the greater nobility—could be expected to lay claim to privilege and to\n\n7\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\na role in the government. Henry IV (1589-1610) had begun in earnest to curtail the authority of these powerful groups and had laid\n\nthe foundations for the later transformation of France into an\n\nabsolute monarchy. Louis XIII (1610-43), his successor (after the regency of his mother, Marie de Medici), chiefly through the wily and ruthless Richelieu, had truncated the rights of the Protestants and had subdued defiant nobles in the provinces. Largely owing to the work of the cardinal, Louis XIV would later be able to make his greater nobility into sycophants in his court. Richelieu had also extended the practice of sending royal intendants across the land to enforce the king’s will in matters of police, taxation, and justice, thus going far toward creating a centralized government. But the long battle of the Crown to extend the law of the king was still not won.'? With the death of Louis XIII the restrained centrifugal forces would be released again. As regent for a minor king, Anne would also face the demands of a crowd of relatives and other fortune seekers hoping to detach for themselves some part of the royal patrimony—offices, lands, benefices, whatever—that they claimed was their due. In Anne’s case the situation was especially difficult. Not only was she inexperienced in public affairs, but she had the reputation of being too weak and lazy to inform herself or to impose her will. Nor could she turn to Richelieu, who had died five months before Louis XIII. Even if he had opposed her in the past, the cardinal would certainly have rallied to the cause of preserving the royal authority of the child-king. Now all of the minister’s past enemies and victims as well of those of the late king flocked to court to clamor for revenge.\n\nTheir hopes were the greater because in the regent herself they recognized a former accomplice.\n\nThe court proper was still relatively small, the Crown not yet having established itself as the sole source of favor and benefits. Its permanent members comprised first the households of the king, the\n\nqueen, Monsieur, le Petit Monsieur (Philippe), the princes of the blood, and other members of the royal family. Next came those great nobles whose interest and connections required their residence near the king, and finally all the favorites and creatures of these personages. Only much later, when the mature Louis XIV had extended his authority, did the court swell to comprise most of the great families of France. Of all these persons with whom Anne would be obliged to treat there was, first and foremost, Gaston, with his long record of conspiracy, inconstancy, and incapacity. In the last days of his reign Louis had named him lieutenant governor in the council of the fu8\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\nture regency with the intention of using one enemy, his brother, as a check on another, his wife. The prince was not sufficiently black of heart to be suspected of planning the murder of his nephews in order to usurp the throne; but at best he would be demanding, and at worst he would be a possible locus of future rebellion.\n\nAmong other potential sources of discord was Henry Il of Condé, head of the other cadet house of Bourbon. A fearsome prince in his prime, former fomenter of civil war and butcher of Protestants during the minority of Louis XIII, he was now basking in the glory of his son, the duke of Enghien, who had won a great victory over the Spanish at Rocroi only a few days after the acces-\n\nsion of Louis XIV. On the death of his father in 1646, Enghien would take his place as first prince of the blood, with the title “Monsieur le Prince.” Owing to his successes in war, he has gone down in history as the Grand Conde. Also in the “family” were the legitimized descendants of Henry IV, the Vendémes, father (César de Vendéme) and son (the duke of Beaufort), both ravaged by the jealousy members of a bastard line felt for the legitimate relatives of the king. Additionally, there was a long list of returnees to the court, many of whom had been friends of the queen in her rebellious youth and were hoping to profit from that fact—Mme de Chevreuse, Mme de Hautefort, M. de la Porte,\n\nand others. These, known as the “important ones,” coveting the lands, offices, and pensions once held by the favorites of the late king and his minister, could be expected to push their own interests even at the expense of the monarchy.\n\nThey were soon to be disenchanted. Anne moved quickly to break the testament of Louis XIII and take to herself the right to govern the kingdom “with full power and freedom” during her son’s minority. Exploiting the enmity that had existed between the parlementaires and the late king and his chief minister, the regent had\n\nno difficulty in persuading the Parlement of Paris to override the last wishes of its old enemy. The members were only too ready to demonstrate that their authority was sufhcient to set up the machinery of the new government. Consequently, by the time the boyking held his first lit de justice on May 18, all was arranged. Anne alone was declared responsible for the person and education of the king and for the administration of the realm. She could set up her own council and appoint her ministers. Gaston retained the title of lieutenant general but was subject to the authority of the regent. The queen proceeded relentlessly to blast the hopes of the “important ones” and to punish would-be fomenters of rebellion. In her\n\nnew position as regent, Anne changed her political identity. She 9\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nnow took the cause of the Bourbon monarchy as her own and became the enemy of those with whom she had collaborated in the past to thwart the will of her husband and Richelieu. Her goals were to preserve and extend the power of the Crown for the benefit of her son. Now she would carry on the struggle to assert the royal prerogative. She must govern so as to ensure the grandeur of Louis\n\nXIV’s future reign. As a pious Christian mother, Anne wanted Louis to grow up to be a good man; but even more, this Habsburg granddaughter of Philip Il of Spain wanted him to become a great king. Passing one day before the portrait of the late cardinal, with whom she had often clashed, she is said to have remarked aloud: “If you were alive today, never would you have been as powerful!” Even if the anecdote is not true, it could have been, for Anne herself was well aware of her change of heart and policy. Where had Anne acquired the political wisdom to maneuver so adroitly and to consolidate her authority as regent so quickly? The answer was chiefly to be found in the remarkable man who had served as Louis XIII’s chief minister in the last few months of his reign: Cardinal Jules Mazarin. A protégé of Richelieu, Mazarin had been a diplomat for the Vatican before entering the service of the French court. His intelligence, ambition, and devoted work, to say nothing of his charm, had earned him the esteem of the king, who had done him the signal honor of making him godfather of le Dieudonné. Mazarin had been known to Anne at least slightly since\n\n1634, when the late cardinal had presented him to her with the insolent remark: “He will please you, Madame, he is much like Buckingham,” an allusion to a scandal of the 1620s caused by the English duke’s indiscreet advances to the young queen. Buckingham aside, Mazarin did have the qualities to appeal. About the same age as the queen, handsome and cultured, he had sojourned in Spain and could converse in her native language. Elegant, worldly, but with refined tastes and habits, he understood how to flatter both the queen and the woman. But more than anything else, knowledgable and experienced in public affairs, devoted to the cause of the monarchy, he was there when Anne needed him. It was he who had guided her in the crucial maneuvers to break the testament of the late king and to consolidate her authority as regent. In foreign affairs as well Mazarin was invaluable. It would be he\n\nwho would persuade the queen to place the interests of France above her pro-Spanish proclivities. When Anne became regent the kingdom was openly involved in the so-called Swedish-French period of the devastating Thirty Years War in the Germanies and was following a tortuous diplomatic course. Richelieu, although sup10\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\nporting the Spanish alliance that had arranged the marriage of Louis XII with the then-infanta Anne and Catholic religious unity within France, had been strongly anti-Habsburg. He had been determined to contain Spanish power, even when that meant aiding Protestant Sweden in Germany and making war on Spain. Now Mazarin was to make it plain to Anne that Richelieu’s policies must be carried on. Under his guidance Anne became, if not a bellicist, at least a\n\nproponent of continuing the war against Spain to a victorious conclusion. As Anne continued to take Mazarin’s counsel in long téte-a-tétes\n\nnearly every evening—the doors carefully left open for the sake\n\nof appearances—the returning aspirants to court began to feel alarmed, well knowing that he would stiffen her resistance to their ambitions and claims. Mme de Chevreuse and the duchess of Longueville, sister of Enghien, with others, thought to end his influence by telling the queen the scandal his visits were creating. In vain.\n\nAlthough Anne “blushed to the whites of her eyes,” she turned more and more to his guidance. By the time the troubles and uncertainty of the transition were passed and the policies of the Regency laid down, Mazarin’s ascendancy over the queen and her government was an established fact at court. Philippe, of course, could have known nothing of these plays for power attendant on the beginning of the new reign. But very early\n\nhe must have come to sense that although as Monsieur he was a very important person indeed—he outranked even the princes of the blood—he ran a very distant second to his brother the king. At the time of his birth the Gazette de france had indeed written\n\nof the princes as two “pillars” supporting the monarchy; but the pillars were by no means of equal stature. Philippe’s position of inferiority was rooted in the law of primogeniture, which conferred upon the firstborn the exclusive right of inheritance. Even had he been born into less exalted circumstances, he would have suffered in comparison with an older male sibling. The privilege of the child favored by primogeniture or by his parents’ choice was firmly fixed in the economic and social framework of early European society. It enabled the family to prevent the division of its estate and the derogation of its assets and honor. Younger sons were sacrificed to serve the interests of the one, usually the oldest male, designated to carry on the interests of the house and pass the inheritance intact to the\n\nnext generation.'® Not until the very late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries did moralists and educational theorists begin to preach the concept of equal rights of children. If the cadet in households of relatively modest means could exII\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\npect discrimination, how much worse the fate of younger sons of royalty. At stake was the unity of the realm and the sovereign authority of the Crown. Obviously the throne could accommodate only one occupant at a time. The marked preference that Anne had shown for her firstborn from the very beginning was thus based, at least in part, on what she must have perceived as her duty. But according to those who observed her, it also flowed from inclination. Although the queen loved Philippe very much, noted Mme de Motteville, Louis was her idol, toward whom she displayed “an infinite tenderness.”\"’ It was his birth, after all, that had made her mother of the heir to the throne\n\nand ended her humiliating position at court. Now that Louis was king, she rose when he entered her presence and to others referred to him formally as “the king, Monsieur my son.” In speaking of Philippe, however, she said simply “my son.” The relative positions of the two children are vividly preserved for us in an anonymous contemporary engraving (see plate 1) designed to commemorate the accession of Louis XIV and the Battle of Rocroi. With the battle scene depicted in the background, the seated Anne holds a laurel crown in one hand and with the other hand supports the arm of the child-king, who holds aloft a scepter. Although the figure of the regent occupies the near center of the picture, Louis, clad in an ermine-trimmed robe and seated beneath an imposing drapery, is the center of attention. On a cushion to his right rests the crown of France. Off to one side on the left of the queen and ignored by her stands Philippe. Wearing a dress decorated with a single ribbon, he reaches out to touch his mother’s skirt as if to remind her that he too is a member of the family.\n\nThat Philippe is dressed in skirts in this and other tableaus of those years should not be misinterpreted. In the seventeenth century small boys customarily wore dresses until they were “‘breeched,” that is, clothed in the breeches or trousers worn by men, an event that usually took place about the time they were taken from the custody of women. Louis, too, wore skirts when very young. Historians have often mistakenly concluded that Anne was deliberately cross-dressing her younger son as part of a plan to render him effeminate and thus submissive to his brother. The error is the easier to make because Anne did tend often to treat Philippe more like a daughter than a son, calling him “my little girl,” and\n\nwhen the time came for his education to begin, acquiescing to a much less rigorous program than that designed for Louis. Thus the representation of the prince in skirts, although perfectly in accor12\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\ndance with the practice of the day, can be seen as symbolic of his mother’s attitude toward him and of his later role in life. Her preference for Louis was never more apparent than in the way she responded to the occasional illnesses of the two children. When in the autumn of 1647, for example, Philippe fell ill with measles complicated by a dangerous dysentery, Anne left him in Paris with his household and, though alarmed, nonetheless went off to Fontainebleau with Louis for a change of air. Following the advice of Mazarin, she hid her concern for political reasons and returned to Paris to the bedside of the prince only when he took a turn for the worse. But soon persuaded that he was improving, she left after three days on hearing that Louis was lonely for her. When the court returned to the capital in mid-October, she found Philippe so thin and pale as to be almost unrecognizable. Even so, again probably for political reasons, she went ahead with plans for a ball. A similar incident took place the following year when Philippe contracted smallpox and was left alone for a short time with his household in Paris. At that time the revolt known as the Fronde had just begun, and Mazarin, desiring to remove the king from the danger of popular violence, used the risk of infection (even though Louis had already had smallpox) as an excuse to spirit him and his mother out of the capital, leaving Philippe behind. When Louis took sick, on the other hand, it was a very different story. In 1647, while Philippe was still convalescing from his long illness, Louis had come down with smallpox. There was no pretense this time that all was well; nor were excuses found to leave him alone until he recovered. Anne hastened to his bedside, where she remained night and day until he was out of danger. All at court could see how differently she reacted when Louis, not Philippe, was the patient. Imperiling her own health by her vigil, she later con-\n\nfessed that had she lost the king she would not have had the strength to go on living. After he recovered, she ordered public rejoicing and religious celebration. In January 1648 and again the following April, Louis, acclaimed by the crowds, went in state to the cathedrals in Paris and Chartres to render public thanks for the return of his health.'® Philippe, present on both occasions and nearly eight, was old enough to have noticed that no such ceremonies were ever held for his benefit. Anne made no attempt, as a modern mother might do, to lessen\n\nor play down the distinction in rank between the two brothers. Quite the contrary. From earliest childhood, even in play, Philippe was required to defer to and to obey his brother the king and made\n\n13\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nto understand that only in that manner could he earn his mother’s love and approval. Submission was the price of social acceptance. Louis, on the other hand, was made constantly aware of what was his due as king and of the distance between him and his subjects, including his brother. The decision to instill in the cadet the need for obedience and submission was a conscious one on the part of the regent and Mazarin, since they were well aware of how often in French history younger brothers had mounted rebellions against the Crown and plunged the country into civil war. Always there was the living and lamentable example of Gaston before their eyes. The minister was devoting his life to completing the work of Richelieu—destroying the enemies of the monarchy. Louis XIV could never become a great king if he had a second Gaston at his side. The lessons of regent and minister seem to have had early and complete success. According to the Venetian ambassador, by the time Louis was five years old he was clearly conscious of his maj-\n\nesty. “In his relations with the duke of Anjou, his brother aged three, he [Louis] wishes to be respected and obeyed,” he wrote. “He\n\nunderstands and recognizes that he is king and he wishes to be treated as such. And if sometimes his mother scolds him, he answers\n\nthat there will come a day when he will be master.”!? Apparently the older brother, at least at this stage of his life, was encouraged from his vantage point as king not so much to disdain or belittle the\n\nyounger boy (as he was later to do), as to use his authority to protect and watch over him. There is considerable evidence that as children they could play harmoniously together. But it was less the\n\nrelationship of brother to brother than of father to son. In one of the letters Louis wrote to Philippe during their childhood, he asked\n\nearnestly about his health and, after assuring him of his own, closed: “Believe me always your affectionate and good little papa.\n\nLouIs.”\n\nThe efforts of Anne and Mazarin to efface Philippe may have been at least in part inspired by a genuine concern lest he outshine his older brother. By all accounts the prince developed into a handsome, active little boy with fine, regular features, bright black eyes,\n\nand an abundance of dark, curly hair. He was much shorter than Louis and promised never to be very tall, but he was exceedingly well proportioned. “The prettiest child in the world,” was the verdict of his cousin, la Grande Mademoiselle, daughter of Gaston.?! And whereas the king was quiet and reserved (“dignified” and “noble” in the vocabulary of the memoirists), Philippe was affectionate and vivacious. “As soon as he learned how to talk, this prince displayed a lively intelligence,” wrote Mme de Motteville.” 14\n\nBROTHER OF LE DIEUDONNE\n\nMoreover, according to the same source, he was not without a will and ideas of his own, which he could express very clearly when he wished. Once, she related, when Philippe was convalescing in 1647 and found his room crowded with visitors who tired him, he begged his mother to get rid of them. When she refused, explaining that they were ladies of quality whom she could not offend, the child riposted: “But Madame, what difference does that make? Are you\n\nnot the mistress? What good is your crown if it cannot get you your way? You chase me out often enough when it suits you, | who am your son. Why shouldn’t they have their turn?”’”’ If the story is true, and there is little reason to doubt it, it reveals on the part of the seven-year-old not only a well-developed facility of expres-\n\nsion but also a precocious if naive understanding of the pecking order about him.\n\nOn public occasions, too, Philippe was much more likely to speak out while the king remained silent. Louis’s confessor, Father Paulin, described an incident in 1650 when the two brothers and their mother were traveling in Burgundy in an effort to pacify the provinces by showing the people their king. On being received by the dignitaries at Dijon, Louis listened to their speeches in silence and made no reply (“‘he preferred to observe and reflect,” wrote the good father). Philippe, on the other hand, “less inhibited by grandeur,” and apparently not intimidated by the crowd, “let all admire his graceful manner of speech.”’* Coming from the pen of a man who owed his post and position in life to his devotion to the king, this evidence is impressive. This occasion and no doubt others like it may well have truly alarmed Anne and Mazarin and been at least\n\none reason they tended more and more in future years to leave Philippe behind with the court during their official travels across France with Louis. No one could be permitted to upstage the king.\n\nAs LE Petit Monsieur was ready to leave his female attendants, what can be said of the start he had made, or been given, in life? Obviously, as the account above reveals, the record of those early years so precious to theorists of personality is far from complete. Although we know Philippe was suckled by a wet nurse, for example, we do not know for how long, or under what conditions. Yet certain facts are clear. Philippe was born in highly unusual circumstances: his father was a king and his brother would soon be one. He was a healthy infant and an active child. Small for his age but well proportioned, handsome, intelligent, even precocious, he seems to have had every grace of mind and body. The child lost his 15\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nfather, whom he had scarcely known, before he was three years old. His mother markedly favored her older son and so far as was possible suppressed sibling rivalry. In addition, the older boy possessed not only the advantages normal to age but his authority and pres-\n\ntige as king. Forced to defer to him in every way, Philippe may have regarded him in the light of a surrogate father. His feelings for him must necessarily have been ambivalent. Sparse as are such data, they are an essential foundation on which to build in explaining the formation of Philippe’s adult personality.\n\n16\n\nTWO\n\nThe “Education” of a Prince\n\nTHE TEACHERS, THEIR DUTIES, AND THEIR THEORIES In the spring of 1648, when Philippe was nearly eight years old, within the space of a few weeks he was taken from the care of women and baptized publicly in an elaborate ceremony attended by\n\nthe king and queen, other members of the royal family, and high dignitaries of the court.' It was an important transition in the life of the prince, marking the beginning of his participation in the public life of the court and of a supposedly serious preparation for his position as brother of the king and heir to the throne. Henceforth he would take his dinner with Louis each evening and appear by his side at many of the court functions, lay and religious.\n\nThe public baptism (as opposed to the private one he had received at birth) took place on the afternoon of May 11 in the chapel\n\nof the Palais Royal, the residence of the queen and her children in the heart of Paris. Presiding was the bishop of Meaux, and serv-\n\ning as godparents were his uncle Gaston, duke of Orléans, and Henriette of France, queen of England, wife of the deposed Charles I. The ceremony was a fairly long and complicated one for which the prince had been carefully coached and which, at least according to the official account, he carried off faultlessly.? It involved, among other things, taking his place on an elevated seat before the assembled court and chief prelates of the church, voicing a request for the 17\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nrite of baptism, accepting anointment with holy oil, and answering in Latin the questions put to him. The prince, “beautiful as an angel,” displayed throughout such “marvelous attention and devotion” and made his answers so distinctly and correctly that all were impressed; and several of the ladies, unable to contain their admiration for the solemn child, cried out repeatedly, “Oh, how beautiful he is!”\n\nSuch accounts, of course, cannot be taken too literally. Comments and phrases like “beautiful as an angel,” for example, were standard for baptismal rites. Much the same thing in many of the same words had been said of Louis at the time of his public baptism\n\nin 1643.’ And it is not difficult to agree that both children, handsome and exquisitely dressed, must have cut appealing figures as they stood alone before the great altar and faced the impressively gowned and mitered prelates. In the case of Philippe, a graceful performance may have come quite naturally. All his life he was to enjoy ceremony and to insist upon its correct observance in every detail. Later in life this pleasure may have derived from his realization that it represented one of the few areas of public affairs, if not at times the sole one, in which he was allowed to participate. But if in this early day he could find satisfaction in it, so much the better. A lifetime of ritual and ceremony lay ahead of him. The next step after baptism was confirmation, which Louis and Philippe received together in December 1649.* This ritual was preparatory to first communion, which newly confirmed children normally received the following Easter. Anne, however, wishing to emphasize the unique relation of a king by divine right with the King of Heaven, arranged for Louis to receive his first communion alone on Christmas Day and, rather than in the private chapel inside the Palais Royal, in his parish church of Saint-Eustache. Philippe’s role in the ceremony was limited to holding one of the four corners of the cloth laid across the communion table.> His own first communion followed not the following spring but, delayed owing to the civil uprising in Paris, on Easter Sunday of 1651.° These events, however, constituted but a small part of the religious life of Anne and her children. Devout in the Spanish way, by which the French meant that she attached great importance to external forms and religious ritual, the queen was tireless in visits to churches, convents, and monasteries. She especially favored Val-de-\n\nGrace, where she had constructed an impressive baroque chapel, the cathedral of the Virgin at Chartres, to which she made frequent pilgrimages, and their parish church of Saint-Eustache. The reli18\n\nTHE “EDUCATION” OF A PRINCE\n\ngious calendar was meticulously observed, with all the saints receiving their due. The schedule was especially crowded in the week before Christmas and in the spring during Lent, when, in addition to daily mass, the court participated in special prayers, vigils, processions, visits to shrines, or other forms of Catholic worship. During Holy Week in 1647, for example, the Gazette reported that on\n\nPalm Sunday “the king and Monsieur, his brother, went to hear mass at the house of the Capuchins on rue Saint Honoré, where His Majesty received the palm from the hands of the Capuchin general.” Three days later Anne, Louis, and Philippe heard high mass at the cathedral of Notre Dame, after which the king and queen washed the feet of twenty-two beggars and served them at table. A separate table of thirteen services was set up for “Monsieur, only brother of\n\nthe king, who wished to take part in the ceremony.” And the following day Louis, candle in hand, was present at the procession of the Holy Sacrament, “Monsieur, his brother at his side.”’ Consider, too, that in addition to these public services, stunning to modern readers in their frequency and duration, Philippe heard mass daily in his own household and received the ministrations and exhortations of his chaplain and private confessor. It all added up to a childhood fairly steeped in religion. Not surprisingly, it seems to have made a lasting impression on him, as it did on Louis. Although neither was ever even slightly interested in questions of theology, and each was perfectly capable of separating his personal morality\n\nfrom religious practice, as adults both were unfailingly dutiful in observing the outward forms of Catholic worship. As for Philippe, he carried over to adulthood not only a liking for exercises of religious piety—even funeral services—but a belief in the efficacy of amulets, medals, and chaplets. Also, his love of jewelry and dress, which manifested itself while he was still a child and grew with the years, was undoubtedly stimulated by the brilliance of the vestments of the clergy and the gold and silver, jewel-encrusted ecclesiastical vessels.\n\nThe lay, as opposed to the religious, education of princes was a totally masculine sphere. Princesses, Anne included, received only that instruction deemed necessary to produce dutiful wives and mothers, and their lessons usually did not extend much beyond religion and the social graces. It was only natural, then, that the regent should turn to Mazarin when the time came for Louis and Philippe to leave the custody of women and begin their formal education. In March of 1646 when Louis was seven years old, she appointed Mazarin to the newly created office of superintendent of the\n\n19\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\neducation of her sons, with the power to designate the governors, assistant governors, preceptors, and other members of the princes’ educational staff who would serve under his authority.®\n\nThis appointment was a critical one for current and future reasons. At stake was not only the appointment of the personnel of the households of Louis and Philippe, matters involving finances and patronage, but the larger question of the quality of the children’s education and the shaping they would receive. By controlling the nomination of these educators, Mazarin had in his power the development of the character and intelligence of the king and the imme-\n\ndiate heir to the throne and, by extension, the power to influence the future of the monarchy itself. So vital a position was bound to be controversial, and it was especially so when it was held by a man who accumulated as many enemies as did Mazarin. And while cer-\n\ntainly many of the charges made against him were spurious and motivated by a desire for spite or revenge, others, especially those relating to the shaping of Philippe, merit consideration. There is in fact good reason to question whether he always made responsible use of the trust placed in him. At the top of the list under Mazarin was the governor, who was at least in theory the real director of his charge’s education and of the formation of his character. His duties were to supervise the conduct of the prince, to preserve him from corruption, to raise him in virtue, and to teach him to direct his life and to be a judge of men. He was supposedly to guide by example, as he was to live in close association with his student, sleeping in his chamber and accompanying him in his carriage when he rode out. Always the governor was a personage of high rank and birth, and more often than not he was an army ofhcer, perhaps even a marshal of France. The military profession not only enjoyed the general esteem of the court but was considered especially suitable for one called upon to direct the education of a prince, whose most important subject of study was mili-\n\ntary science. To assist him and to replace him if he were called away, the governor of both Louis and Philippe had two assistant governors, who were also usually men of high military rank. The actual teaching of a prince was undertaken by the preceptor, whose duty was to develop his student’s intelligence by the study of the arts and sciences. This person was usually a man of erudition with a reputation as a savant and would most likely have a connection with the church. He would be assisted by a battery of instructors in specific subjects and skills. However, his goal was not to make the prince into a scholar but to give him the kind of education 20\n\nTHE “SEDUCATION’’ OF A PRINCE\n\nthat would enable him to rule wisely and well. Latin and Greek would be of far less use than knowledge of the army, of horseman-\n\nship, of drawing, of fencing, even of dancing. These rather than scholarship would command the respect of the nobility in times of war and peace. Even so, Latin, history, literature, mathematics, and foreign languages were not to be entirely neglected; the king must be a civilized and cultured prince, not merely a crude and ignorant soldier. Still, the emphasis was definitely on the practical rather than the intellectual, on applied knowledge as opposed to the humanities or liberal arts. Such general principles reflected the ideas of Mazarin and also no doubt a growing perception in the seventeenth century of the noble as a man of gentility versed in the arts of civilization as well as of war.’ In choosing the principal educators of Louis in 1646, Mazarin had adhered closely to these general guidelines. The marquis de Villeroi, who became the king’s governor, was a highly regarded army officer. Louis’s preceptor was Hardouin de Péréfixe, a scholarly clergyman.'° Under their ministrations, the king developed rapidly and, notwithstanding the many criticisms then and since of the education to which he was exposed, acquired the accomplishments essential to his royal craft. When Mazarin set about creating Philippe’s household of mentors, he seemed to repeat this pattern, and superficially, at least, his\n\nselections were impeccable. Chosen as governor was César de Choiseul, count of Plessis-Praslin, whose qualifications were impressive. A marshal of France, renowned for bravery and a specialist in artillery and siege warfare, he had long been an esteemed figure at court, having been one of the children of honor when Louis XIII\n\nwas the dauphin. The assistant governors, Millet de Jeure and D’Aluimar, were also high-ranking officers in the army.!'! The preceptor was Francois de La Mothe Le Vayer, who, though a married\n\nman and not an ordained priest, was a member of the French Academy and admired for his scholarship. He was to write essays on geography, rhetoric, and morals in 1651 and an undated /fistory of France that was addressed specifically to Philippe.\n\nDespite the impressive credentials of these men, their appointments were questionable in a number of ways. In the first place, Mazarin was in no hurry to make them. Plessis-Praslin did not take office until 1649, when Philippe was nearly nine years of age, and even then, owing to the outbreak of civil war that required his active service in the army, he was not generally available to fulfill his duties until 1653. The other members of the household were not in\n\n21\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nplace until 1651 or later. In the meantime, Philippe was placed under the tutelage of Louis’s governor, Villeroi, but in fact he seems to have been allowed to fritter away his days in foolish games with the ladies of honor and their daughters in the service of the queen. Mme de Motteville, although she regarded the prince with tender affection, remarked with regret his penchant for wasting time and concluded: “It would [have been] desirable if an effort had been made to remove him from the idle play that was allowed him in his youth.” '? Although Philippe may have shared some lessons with\n\nthe king, he did not truly enter upon his formal education until 1653, after the end of the Fronde. In the second place, both governor and preceptor were men who had earlier tried and failed to win appointment in the service of the king. The reasons for the rejection of Plessis-Praslin as Louis’s governor are not entirely clear, although they may be guessed at from difficulties that arose when he was nominated to serve Philippe. In the case of La Mothe Le Vayer, an element of “pyrronism,” of the “vice” of Protagoras, a Greek Sophist, was allegedly present in his scholarly work and was held against him. The mentor of His Most Christian Majesty could not be permitted to introduce into his mind\n\neven the shadow of doubt or questioning of the truth of Catholic orthodoxy. The result could be a fatal loss of self-confidence and destruction of the king’s qualities of leadership. It may be, however,\n\nthat this objection was not taken too seriously by Mazarin, since La Mothe Le Vayer was permitted at times to instruct the king and has been credited with influencing his intellectual development as much as his own governor, Péréfixe.'? Yet the fact remains that for Philippe’s two most important teachers, Mazarin chose men he had rejected for the service of the king. Plessis-Praslin’s appointment was vulnerable from other points of view as well. Disappointed not to be accepted as Louis’s mentor, he was less than enthusiastic about taking second best. In the end he accepted the office, which of course was a venal one, because it was very important to him financially. There is good reason to think\n\nthat he was much more interested in making his fortune than in instructing his charge. Plessis-Praslin has been criticized for having been the creature of Mazarin, which to a degree he must have been,\n\nand for having too slavishly followed his direction;'* but in fact there was hard feeling between the two, which had its root in money. Mazarin too, when he had accepted the office of superintendent of the education of Louis and Philippe, had been thinking in terms of financial gain, since it carried with it the right to receive a 22\n\nTHE “SEDUCATION’’ OF A PRINCE\n\ncommission from the recipients of posts in their households, educational and other. A problem of jurisdiction arose when PlessisPraslin asserted that as governor he had within his purview the post of the prince’s superintendent of finances, claimed also by Mazarin, with the right to collect the provisions attached to it. The sordid side of the affair came to light when Jean Baptiste Colbert, to whom Mazarin had entrusted the care of his personal finances, advised the cardinal to double the offices of Philippe’s household in order to turn a better profit and to remove Plessis-Praslin from jurisdiction over half of them. “Thus I have caused to be created a second provision of intendant,” wrote Colbert. “And if you want to believe me, you will do the same thing for the post of secretary of commands; I shall sell them profitably; just rely on me.” In the same letter he was at pains to put the cardinal on guard against the governor who, he averred, “can never be one of your friends.” He continued: “[Plessis-Praslin] thinks he has a right to half of the money that you will derive from those offices; and when I speak of money, it is his God and his veritable soul, and the same can be said for his\n\nwife.”\n\nDespite this dispute, the manner of whose resolution is not known, Plessis-Praslin held on to his office. When he began to fulfill its duties in 1653, he became the subordinate of Mazarin, to whom he reported daily on the conduct and progress of his charge.'¢ It was\n\nthus the cardinal and not the governor who had overall control of the direction and purpose of the prince’s education, what ideas and principles he should emphasize and what subjects he should avoid. Plessis-Praslin followed Mazarin’s instructions carefully, which, he wrote, “he [the governor referred to himself in the third person in his memoirs] found very reasonable.” Always, he added, “He devoted himself entirely to the training of the prince who had been entrusted to his care... . he encouraged him as much as possible in the direction of piety and study; he engendered in him the sentiments of respect and of tenderness that he owed to the king and made him understand that his true greatness consisted in being in the good graces of His Majesty, and that he should never permit even a hint of misplaced ambition to give rise to doubt of his loyalty.” Expanding on this theme, he continued: “Brothers of kings cannot have too much greatness of soul, nobility of sentiment, or elevation of view, but all of these must be subordinated to what they are duty bound to owe their sovereigns, for even while being their brothers, they do not cease to be their subjects.” \"’\n\nThe governor was very likely perfectly truthful when he wrote 23\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nthat he found Mazarin’s instructions sensible. He had, after all, just been through the Fronde of the princes, in which once again Gaston had rebelled against royal authority. As a marshal of France, Plessis-Praslin had participated in the military defeat of the Frondeurs and had served as negotiator with the prince to obtain his submission. No need to instruct him in the dangers of a disloyal younger brother. Despite Plessis-Praslin’s conviction of the need to teach Philippe his duty of submission to Louis, he chafed at the limitations placed upon his governance after 1653 when he took up his duties. By this time his charge was entering his teens and in the opinion of the old soldier should begin to learn the arts of war and other “quantities of things” proper to his rank. He knew that Mazarin was constantly initiating the king into his life’s work. Louis was now permitted to sit in the royal council and was often taken to the army, not only to improve its morale, but to enable him to learn about its organization and operations. Meanwhile Philippe was left behind with the queen and her ladies. Plessis-Praslin complained, but to no avail. Governors of princes, he observed, are not always masters of their conduct, and when obliged to submit to the will of “superior forces,” he kept silent and remained with Monsieur at court. Even so, he protested that Philippe was much too old by this time to live apart from men and that the prince himself was much displeased at the idleness of his life.'®\n\nBy “superior forces” the governor had of course referred to Anne and Mazarin, but of the two he really meant Mazarin, who made the\n\ndecisions on the education of Louis and Philippe and indeed on virtually everything else. Now the confidant as well as first minister of the queen, he governed her life and the business of the state as well. Whenever separated, the two wrote to each other constantly and in terms that leave no doubt that there was more to their relationship than that of minister and regent. In 1653, in a sort of code they had worked out to refer to themselves, Louis, and a few others, Anne wrote: “15 [Anne] cannot have other designs than those that\n\nplease 16 [Mazarin] and, to show him that there is nothing in the world equal to the attachment [amuté] that 22 [also Anne] has for 16, 15 does not wish to displease him even in her thoughts.” Historians are still not in agreement on the exact nature of their relationship, Louis’s foremost biographer arguing that they were man and wife (the cardinal was not an ordained priest and could have married within the church), while Anne’s most recent biographer has concluded that Mazarin’s position as godfather of Louis ruled 24\n\nTHE “SEDUCATION’’ OF A PRINCE\n\nout the possibility of marriage (according to the church, marriage of the mother to the godfather of her child was incest).”° AN ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT\n\nHowever it may have been, what is certain is that the education Philippe received is the education that the all-powerful Mazarin intended for him. What were those intentions, and what plans did he entertain for the future of Monsieur, heir to the throne? Submission\n\nto his brother was obviously lesson number one. But was that the entire story? At court the accusation was frequently heard that\n\nthe cardinal, out of fear lest the cadet outperform the king, instructed La Mothe Le Vayer to retard the prince’s academic progress. Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Philippe’s second wife,\n\nwas almost certainly repeating that view—and perhaps that of Philippe as well—when she related Mazarin’s alleged reprimand to the preceptor on an occasion when his pupil had performed well:\n\n“What can you be thinking of, Monsieur La Mothe, in making a clever man of the brother of the king! If he becomes more learned than the king he will no longer be able to obey him blindly.”?! The upshot reportedly was the cardinal’s order to the teacher to cease his lessons and send the prince off to play. Little came of the bright promise that the prince had shown as a small boy. When Mademoiselle returned to court in 1657 after an absence of several years, she was astonished at how little the prince had changed. While the king was entering his manhood, brimming\n\nwith confidence and actively engaged in the affairs of the army, Philippe was still living the life of a feckless child. Rather than going to the army or sitting in on councils, he was splashing in the river with the ladies of the queen and amusing them with puerile pranks.” The problem of Philippe’s education must have been difficult for Mazarin from both a personal and a political point of view. In his close daily association with Anne and Louis, he had come to regard himself as a surrogate father to the king, to whom he had become totally devoted. Anyone who has read his letters cannot doubt the genuineness of his love for Louis or fail to realize that for the cardinal, even more than for Anne, Louis came first. Yet as chief minister of state, he must have been aware of his responsibility to ensure the future governance of the kingdom. Until the time Louis\n\nmarried and had a son, Philippe was next in line to the throne. 25\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nGiven the high mortality rate in the seventeenth century, especially of children, the possibility that Philippe would become king was no remote one. Simple prudence required his preparation for that eventuality. And even if he did not assume the crown of France, there were other thrones the brother of the king of France might be called upon to ascend. When Philippe was six years old, the only son of the widowed king of Spain died. Anne thought of pressing her own claim to the throne on behalf of her younger son, a project that fell through when the Spanish king remarried and his queen gave birth\n\nto the future Charles II.2’ Some ten years later Mazarin, hoping to evict the Habsburgs from their possession of the imperial crown, suggested Monsieur as a potentially suitable emperor.” And Philippe himself in the decade of the 1660s aspired at least briefly to be king of Naples. Of course, if Monsieur were to rule a country other than France, his ignorance and resulting incompetence would pose less of a danger and might even be advantageous to the French\n\nking. But in failing to groom Philippe to succeed Louis, Mazarin must have known he was taking great risks. Of course, it could be argued that even if the prince had received\n\nexactly the same training as Louis he might still have grown into the same puerile, self-indulgent adolescent he in fact became. Perhaps he might have defeated the efforts of the most diligent and exacting mentors. [he causes of the prince’s arrested development can never be known with certainty. This much admitted, it is still undeniable that Philippe received an education and training in many ways more befitting a princess than the heir to the throne. Mazarin so feared he might pose a threat to Louis that he did not submit him to a serious program of study or offer him an apprenticeship in the métier of a king. He was left to his games, and his boyish indolence was fostered rather than combated. And as he fell further and further behind his brother, games and indolence would themselves become a refuge from the humiliation and failure he was to experience in competition with Louis.” What enduring marks did these pedagogical theories and prac-\n\ntices leave on the young Philippe? If Saint-Simon, the celebrated memoirist of the later years of the reign of Louis XIV, is to be believed, they were disastrous: “With more affability [du monde] than intelligence and no learning whatever, although with an extensive and precise recollection of family trees, births, and marriages, he was capable of nothing. No one so soft of mind and body.” ”¢ But\n\nSaint-Simon knew the prince only from a distance and in the last years of his life. This merciless pen portrait, drawn when Philippe 26\n\nTHE ‘EDUCATION’ OF A PRINCE\n\nwas prematurely aged in body and broken in spirit, tells us nothing about the man in his prime.\n\nDespite certain unfounded horror stories to the contrary, the prince did not remain a functional illiterate well into his teens. A letter in his hand, or rather scrawl, to his uncle Gaston congratulaing him on the birth of a son in September 1650 is incontrovertible proof that he could read and write at least serviceably, if not correctly, by his tenth birthday (plate 6).”” Even so, subsequent correspondence evidenced less improvement than one might expect if the student had been more diligent or the teachers more demanding. He was never to master the grammatical structure of the French lan-\n\nguage; his spelling was faulty and his handwriting remained so poor that he frequently could not read it himself. “Here Madame,” Liselotte (the family name of Elizabeth Charlotte) later remembered his saying: “you are accustomed to my handwriting. Read me this;\n\nI do not know what | have written.” Both thought it a joke and would enjoy a good laugh over his dilemma.”* Here no doubt he differed little from most of the nobility of his day. As a rule, the higher the rank, the more illegible and ungrammatical the hand. (Louis, however, was at least one exception; even if his orthography were poor, he learned to handle French correctly and even with elegance.) Certainly Philippe derived no pleasure from the written word and had no gift for literary expression. He wrote no memoirs and although, as brother of the king, he was obliged to write letters\n\nby the hundreds (not many of which have survived), he usually kept them as brief as possible. Except for the rare occasion when he gave vent to emotion, perhaps pent-up rage and frustration, his letters make use of a limited vocabulary and colorless formula. Most\n\nare chiefly remarkable for triteness of expression and banality of thought. In speaking, however, as in early childhood the prince continued to command an easy flow of words and often an apt turn of expression. When he was close to fourteen one of his chaplains published a little book, Les dits notables de Monsieur Philippe de France, in which\n\nsome of his most noteworthy expressions were set down. Extremely laudatory, indeed to the point of ridiculousness, much of it can be\n\nwritten off as sheer flattery. The alleged purity of the prince’s speech, his modesty, piety, and virtue came in for special praise. When someone expressed surprise at Philippe’s short stature, the prince supposedly replied in a clever play on words “that princes were always somewhat grand [tall or great], but as for himself he wanted only to grow grand in wisdom.” Nonetheless, the choice of 27\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nthis particular form of adulation was undoubtedly a reflection of Philippe’s articulateness and wit. No one ever composed a similar encomium on the more reserved Louis at this or any other time of his life. The prince was always to have a reputation as a great talker (often without having said very much). Later he was said to have\n\nbeen a veritable chatterbox and incapable of keeping a secret.” “Oh!” Louis would remark scornfully, “if anyone could talk as much as my brother.” Philippe seems to have made no formal study of languages other than French, although he became reasonably fluent in Spanish. He probably learned most of it from Anne, who reportedly spoke Span-\n\nish to her children in the intimacy of family life. Shortly before Louis’s marriage to his Spanish cousin Maria Theresa, the prince joined his brother in working on the vocabulary that would be useful in the exchanges of protocol. On that occasion he was able to converse successfully with the bride and her father,*’ but subsequently he seems to have made no use of the language except to show off his knowledge on occasion before the dutifully admiring ladies of the French court. Philippe was anything but a student or scholar. In any case, Maz-\n\narin did not desire to give him, or the king, for that matter, an education in the humanities. The few books that he was known to\n\nhave read—or at least that were written for his express benefit—were tracts by La Mothe Le Vayer on, in addition to the history of France, geography, rhetoric, and ethics. But dry and colorless, they must have repelled him rather than attracted him to the printed page. He seems never to have been introduced to classical literature.\n\nA translation of Florus from the Latin was published under his name, but it was almost certainly mostly or entirely the work of a tutor. As an adult he was never known to have read or referred to any of the great Latin essayists, poets, or statesmen. Nor was he known to take any interest in the literature of his day. Although for many years he was a friend of Mme de Sable, hostess of a celebrated literary salon, he was not a part of her literary circle, which included\n\nLa Rochefoucauld, nor, to judge from his letters, did he discuss literary subjects with her. The world of belles lettres was closed to him. Louis, too, of course, was never bookish either as a boy or as an adult. But whereas the king was instructed personally and daily by Mazarin in the craft of statesmanship and was soon obliged to spend long hours reading, writing, and analyzing government papers, Philippe was shut out of these adult pursuits. Thus he could not acquire the vast practical knowledge of politics, diplomacy, and organization of government that distinguished his brother. Nor was 28\n\nTHE “SEDUCATION’’ OF A PRINCE\n\nhe ever trained to approach a question analytically and to pursue it systematically. Contemporaries noted his inability to concentrate long on any given subject. Such habits of thought and expression were no doubt the inevitable results of what Philippe’s chaplain, Daniel de Cosnac, bishop of Valence, summed up as “an education disproportionate to his rank.” ” Not that the prince was devoid of wit or knowledge. However, such accomplishments as he came to possess were of the kind that could be acquired more through observation and instinct than by systematic study. Foremost among them were his talents and achievements as a\n\ncollector of paintings, gems, and objets d’art and as a builder of gardens and chateaus. For these occupations he had to thank above\n\nall his innate love of beauty and his artistic gifts, which evinced themselves early in a childish fascination with jewelry and adornment. He also was soon greatly beholden to the cardinal who, himself a connoisseur of the arts and owner of an incomparable palace in Rome, probably took a spontaneous pleasure in gratifying a kindred spirit and fostering and shaping his aesthetic tastes. In addition, Mazarin must soon have realized that the prince’s artistry could serve his purpose very well. Not only could his interests and energies be thus diverted into areas that posed no political threat to his brother, but his gratitude and obedience to Louis’s will could be ensured through timely gifts to feed his passion for building and collecting. A discernible pattern emerged during Philippe’s adolescence. Whenever the prince appeared to kick against the pricks, a gift (some might say a bribe), great or small, ranging from the magnificent property of Saint-Cloud on the Seine down to a small sum\n\nof money or a painting or two would effect a reconciliation and bring him to heel. Another, and no doubt unintended, result of this policy was the fostering of a spirit of acquisitiveness in Philippe. It was probably no accident that in his adult life he was to demonstrate a passion not only for collecting works of art but for amassing wealth and material possessions of all kinds. By then it may have become a means of securing gratification or compensation for other satisfactions that had escaped or been denied him.® As for physical activity, Philippe was taught, or at least exposed to, all the skills usual in boys of high rank: horsemanship, hunting, shooting, fencing, and dancing.™ The enclosed garden of the Palais Royal was a splendid playground, and in it Mazarin had constructed a miniature fortress in which Louis and Philippe played at war with\n\na selected group of children of honor. He was barely six years of age when a letter of the cardinal informs us that he was being taken to the hunt. And according to the Gazette de France, in summer 29\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\nhe often joined Louis in swimming in the Seine.* He must have been a good dancer, since he frequently appeared in the ballets that were one of the highlights of the court in the 1650s and 1660s. Even in later years, according to his second wife, “he danced well” and enjoyed attending balls and masquerades.*’ On these occasions, again according to the Gazette de France, his performance was grace-\n\nful and accomplished, though never, of course, equal to that of the king, who was always the star. He also must have become a skilled equestrian. He took prominent roles in the extravagant pageants and tests of equestrian skills that Louis staged in the early years of his adult reign and later, when with the army in Flanders, thought nothing of spending entire nights in the saddle. Nonetheless, during his adult life Monsieur displayed a marked aversion for physical activity of any kind. In contrast to his brother\n\nand to the tradition of his Bourbon ancestors, he had no taste for the hunt. “Were it not for war,” wrote Liselotte, “[Monsieur] never in his life would have mounted a horse.” * Perhaps he was sedentary by nature. But it could not have been much pleasure for Philippe as a child to compete with Louis in sports and exercises. The older boy possessed all the natural advantages of age—superior strength, coordination, and skill—and was a natural athlete to boot. He was also the king, who had to excel at everything and to whom all the children had to defer. He probably would have prevailed even had the game not always been rigged. To Philippe fell the role of perpetual loser. Small wonder he preferred the company of women and girls for games and play. With them competition was absent. In any case, outranked by the prince, they deferred to him\n\njust as he was obliged to yield to the king. One need not be a psychologist to understand that an increasingly marked preference for female companionship, reinforced by the slackness of the educational program designed for Philippe, was in part the result of the demoralization he felt in competition with Louis. His seeming laziness could easily have been a means of avoiding being put to the test.” Perhaps also as an adult he decided, consciously or unconsciously, that this was one humiliation he could forgo.\n\nTHE SocIAL GRACES Except during the years of the Fronde, the court in which Louis and\n\nPhilippe grew up was lively and full of gaiety. Although in her middle age Anne took seriously her duty to God and her responsibilities as regent, she had by no means lost her taste for a good 30\n\nTHE ‘SEDUCATION’’ OF A PRINCE\n\ntime. From the Spanish court, where Lope de Vega had performed, she had brought a well-developed interest in the theater. In France she became a devoted patron of Corneille and Moliére. Mazarin broadened her taste by importing Italian opera and ballet. Theatricals were only a small part of the social life of the court. Receptions, balls, banquets, masquerades, and pageants succeeded each other at a dazzling pace. Especially during the winter months, the social calendar was crowded. In addition, on evenings when no special entertainment was planned there was always the gaming table, which\n\nnever aroused any religious scruples in Anne. Both she and the cardinal were avid gamblers and, in line with attitudes typical of their century, probably saw nothing wrong in permitting small chil-\n\ndren to play games of chance, even for money.” Certainly Louis and Philippe could have come by their gambling habits early in life.\n\nIt was later a staple feature in Louis’s court and became almost a passion for Philippe during his mature years. Anne presided over these festivities with the ease and practice of\n\na natural hostess. She understood the importance of the social graces in the life of a court and believed her sons’ training in them could not begin too soon. Both children began appearing at recep-\n\ntions and dinners for visiting dignitaries as soon as they left the custody of women. By the time they were ten or eleven they were already hosting small afternoon gatherings or early evening suppers for selected children of the court. In these affairs Philippe was a willing and gifted pupil. Naturally gregarious and sociable, he enjoyed mixing with people and going\n\ninto society. Even more than attending parties, he loved giving them and in time became a celebrated host. He was still in his teens when his cousin, la Grande Mademoiselle, after attending a reception in his quarters while traveling with the court, noted his “special talent for doing the honors of his house.”*! Philippe had opportunities aplenty to perfect his social skills. Af-\n\nter the Fronde he moved away from Anne and Louis and set up a separate household in the Tuileries, vacated by Mademoiselle, then in disgrace for her role in the rebellion. There, while the pace of court social life increased in the return of domestic peace, Philippe began to preside over more elaborate entertainments and participated with Louis in the round of gaiety. Consider, for example, the month of January 1655, when the prince was fifteen years old. The year began with a ball given by Louis at the Louvre, his residence after the Fronde, in honor of his mother in the traditional feast\n\nof kings. The next day there was a supper at the adjacent palace of Mazarin during which Louis and Philippe entertained the 31\n\nBROTHER TO THE SUN KING\n\ncompany with “a very gallant improvised masquerade.” On January 7 Philippe invited all the ladies of the court (with escorts, of course, including the king) to a ball and comedy followed by a late collation. The eleventh saw a hunt at the forest of Vincennes, the fourteenth an Italian comedy at the Louvre. On the seventeenth Philippe again hosted a great ball and buffet at the Tuileries. The festivities of the month drew to a close when Louis and Philippe at the head of a band of young nobles, all in disguise, trooped to the lodging of Henriette, princess of England, to sing a serenade, after which they descended on the mansion of Chancellor Séguier. Recognizing his august visitors and reacting quickly, the chancellor spread a feast. So delighted were the invaders that they asked to\n\nreturn, which they did two evenings later to be offered a ball, comedy, music, and banquet.”\n\nTHE FRONDE AND Its EFFECTS The civil war known as the Fronde—in French literally a slingshot used by boys—was far more serious and complex than its name would imply. Lasting nearly five years, it involved a fundamental\n\nchallenge of the authority of the Crown: among others, its right to control taxation, its right to direct foreign policy, its right to dictate to the Parlement of Paris, and its ability to sweep aside the grievances and ambitions of a nobility that desired to share the royal\n\nprerogative. The leaders of the Fronde lacked a well-formulated ideology of revolt and offered no clear alternative to absolutism. But many of their grievances and demands were to reappear 140 years later in only slightly altered form in the origins of the great French Revolution. In the seventeenth century as in the eighteenth, these conflicts were fought out in a larger context of class struggle, widespread economic deprivation, popular violence, and a royal treasury desperate for revenue. [he rebellion is usually divided into two phases, the parlementary Fronde of 1648-49 and the Fronde of the princes of 1651-52.” From the very beginning the Fronde involved a clash of persons in high places and a network of intrigue and conspiracy that often masked the significance of the important questions at stake.“* To Anne the revolt reduced itself to disobedience to her beloved son, her firstborn and her sovereign. It was also, of course, an attack on her own person and authority as well as on those of Mazarin, whose\n\ndirection of affairs of state she upheld. Both came in for vilification of the grossest kind. In her desire for forceful suppression 32\n\nTHE “SEDUCATION’’ OF A PRINCE\n\nof the disorders and punishment of its perpetrators, she reacted with\n\nthe outrage of a mother as well as a regent. Bad enough that the parlementaires, for whom she had nothing but contempt, should rebel. Far worse and infinitely more dangerous was the disloyalty of members of the high nobility and of the king’s own family. Cadet branches of the royal family, both legitimate and illegitimate, formed the nucleus of cabals reaching down to their creatures and\n\nother ambitious place hunters. Possessed of provincial governorships and enormous financial resources, the princes were capable of fomenting and leading armed rebellion across the land. When joined by the Grand Condé, Louis II of Bourbon, first prince of the blood, and by that prince of conspirators, Gaston, duke of Orléans, they posed a formidable threat to Louis’s throne. Thus, to the already complex political situation were added the strains of a family feud, all exacerbated by the wounded maternal instincts and pride of the regent. Philippe had not yet passed his eighth birthday and was ill with smallpox when disorder broke out in Paris in the summer of 1648. He could, of course, have had no comprehension of the issues involved. Perhaps in his childish mind the early events of the Fronde were no more than a jumble of frightening impressions and experiences: his feverish sufferings, an inexplicable separation from his\n\nmother, mysterious arrivals and departures in the middle of the night, and terrifying hours shut in the trunk of a carriage as it jolted and rocked through the streets of the capital. The violence erupted when Anne and Mazarin, who had been negotiating in vain with the demands of Parlement and other sov-\n\nereign courts in Paris, ordered the arrest of three of their most prominent members. The poor—the menu peuple—incited by the courts and always on the edge of starvation, poured into the street and erected barricades around the Palais Royal and across the city. Paris was out of control. In the Parlement proposals were heard to seize the king, to shut the queen up in a convent, to create a regency for Gaston, and to dismiss Mazarin and replace him with Monsieur’s closest adviser, abbé de la Riviére.*\n\nFearing for the safety of Louis, Mazarin used Philippe’s illness\n\nas a pretext for removing the king from Paris while the Palais Royal was cleaned to rid it of the danger of infection.
