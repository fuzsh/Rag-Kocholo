        "text": "I think, as SunZi mentioned, there's a question as to the structure of the Regency that emerges after the death of Carlos. Our best point of reference is the Regency of Carlos himself after the death of his father. Philip IV in his will granted Mariana, the now dowager Queen, the guardianship of Carlos as Tutor and Curator. Tutorship granted her physical custody of the King and control of his education and responsibility for his welfare until he turned 14. Curatorship granted lesser powers from age 14 to 25 but the young King could potentially reject the Curatorship during that period, I believe if there was support within the court to appoint an alternative. Since Joseph Ferdinand is not Carlos' son he would have no right to grant a Tutorship over the boy so presumably Joseph's father Max Emanuel would have to be recognized as Tutor until he turned 14 in 1706. Max Emanuel would like also claim Curatorship as well although there may be a fight over that. But he would definitely have physical custody over the the new King, the right to control his education and perhaps appoint or maybe at least veto members of the King's household.\n\nSeparately from the Tutorship and Curatorship Mariana was also made Governor, which was essentially the office of Regent as normally the King was the King-Governor legally speaking so a King during his minority could have the office and authority of Governor invested in another party who would thus effectively be Regent. So she had the political authority to act as King or on the King's behalf and govern Spain as head of the Junta de Gobierno or Regency Council. This would be the office that would be contested at Carlos' death.\n\nCarlos is going to name someone as Regent in his will. I do not know who was considered as Governor OTL when Joseph Ferdinand was named as heir. I think it may have been Cardinal Portocarrero but I'm not sure and in any event the situation was fluid so Queen Maria Anna could possibly have been named as well in this ATL if Joseph lives to Carlos' death. It's also possible perhaps even likely that the Governorship would not be granted in the same full powers as Mariana received OTL. Philip IV started installing her in power before his death and ensured a relatively smooth transition to her making clear in his will that she could and should act with the full powers of the King to head the Junta, appoint viceroys and officers etc etc. But Carlos could instead appoint a Governor with more circumscribed powers. The Governor appointed for Joseph could, for example, be limited to acting merely as head of the Junta with most powers having to be exercised through the council with the consent of its members. More like a figurehead Regent with actual power in the hands of the Regency Council. Such a setup would probably elevate the relative power of Max Emanuel in his role as Tutor.\n\nSo this is all pretty nuanced but its going to be important because when Carlos dies there's a pretty immediate international diplomatic crisis given that Carlos would likely leave the entire Spanish empire to Joseph to counter the Anglo-French plan to partition it. Representation of the Spanish in whatever diplomatic maneuverings that occur as a result is going to be dictated by the structure of the Spanish Regency. So lets say Carlos leaves all Spanish territory to Joseph in his will. He names Portocarrero as Governor but with limited powers such that he can only exercise control through the Junta which likely includes the Dowager Queen as a member. An embassy is dispatched to Brussels to Max Emanuel to see if he will accept the Spanish throne for his son under those conditions. Max wasn't party to any partition Treaty so he probably agrees to accept the whole inheritance and disclaim any plans for partition. He likely makes a demand about being added to the Junta as Tutor of the King, which is probably accepted. So Joseph is proclaimed King and the Junta de Gobierno is established with Max Emanuel as a member as Tutor, Portocarrero a member as Archbishop of Toledo, possibly dowager Queen Maria Anna as a Councilor of State. Looking again to Carlos' Junta as a model they would likely be joined by the Grand Inquisitor Baltasar de Mendoza y Sandoval, the President of the Council of Castile, Manuel Arias y Porres, the President or Vice Chancellor of the Council of Aragon (I believe appropriate person here would be Rodrigo Manuel Manrique de Lara) along with a Grandee as representative of the nobility. Portocarrero is nominally Regent but his powers are severely limited and he mostly has to defer to the Junta collectively.\n\nThe French court protests the accession of Joseph Ferdinand referencing the Dauphin's rights as heir of Maria Theresa's claims and maybe obliquely referencing the partition Treaty. Vienna protests as well citing Maria Antonia's renunciation of her rights to Spain. No one on the Junta, regardless of faction, would actually propose making outright concessions to either side. At least superficially the Junta would be united in proclaiming Joseph as sole heir. But it would be understood by all that Spain would struggle to defend its territories against the rival claimants of France and Austria. The Junta would be smart to approach William III to get backing for installing Joseph as sole heir. William did sign a partition Treaty with France but he's not otherwise opposed to Joseph. And if the Junta offered some commercial privileges in the Spanish Americas that could help win him over.\n\nFrance will not be put off, however, and Portocarrero will be sympathetic to them. Though he couldn't outright suggest conceding any territory to the French and the Junta is likely to be badly divided on the issue. The Council of Aragon will not want to part with any of Spanish Italy and so will be against accommodating the French. De Lara was also a staunch supporter of Maria Anna so if the two of them are on the Junta they would form a natural block. The Grand Inquisitor OTL favored Austria so probably joins that block as well. Against them is Portocarrero, Manuel Arias and probably the Grandee Councilor. So Max Emanuel could potentially hold the balance of power. Notably he is probably also still nominally the Governor the Spanish Netherlands. Max Emanuel is probably going to do whatever is best for him and side with whomever he thinks will be more likely to accommodate his interests. In some ways I think the French could work as partners in his eyes. Leopold is going to really resent him for stealing the Spanish inheritance and he won't ever like the idea of a Prince of the HRE suddenly being elevated to one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe. So Max is going to be preoccupied with the need to secure Bavaria from potential Austrian aggression where as all France wants is a slice of Italy which he probably doesn't care as much about.\n\nPortocarreco might suggest some half measures in favor of France like conceding commercial privileges to the French or allowing them to occupy the Presidi for security in order to placate them. While the pro-Austrian block might do the same for Austria, for example suggesting that Archduke Charles be named a Viceroy in Spanish Italy. Or maybe conceding the right of Leopold, as Emperor, to adjudicate the succession to the Duchy of Milan as an Imperial fief. So if Max comes down on the pro-French side in the Junta Spain could move towards concessions to France.\n\nThe trick would be to triangulate a position acceptable to France and to England and domestically in Spain itself. It would be much easier if Austria were the aggressor, either in Milan or Bavaria but that's not guaranteed. I think there's a chance that Portocarrero could manipulate the situation by spurning Harrach, the Austrian representative in Madrid, and controlling the embassy to Vienna such that he could provoke a resentful Leopold into attacking first. If Leopold sent troops into Milan that could provide Portocarrero the cover the request French aid in defending Italy and using the resulting military struggle as cover to make concessions to France. On the other hand if the French do something stupid like recognizing James III as they did OTL then that could push England too far against France to find a solution acceptable to all. Definitely a tricky situation.\n\nI could potentially see it ending with Austria gaining Milan and France gaining Naples and the Presidi but nothing else. Louis might accept that as he was primarily concerned to ensure any aggrandizement of Austria was matched by an equivalent or greater gain for France. And moving Spain from anti-French pro-Austrian Habsburg rule to neutral or maybe even pro-French Wittelsbach rule might be seen as enough of a win. Especially if the Spanish also consent to a French match for their new King.\n\nFrom there: Spain is still a decentralized, declining empire. Without a major war, centralization and/or reform is going to be a tough row to hoe. Still, other than a good start at reform, Philip was not all that good for Spain.\n\nButterflies flapping their wings: France is much more powerful going into the 18th century. They still have a good foothold/claim to Rupert's Land. Without the massive war drain, a little more effort could be put into New France (not talking radical, just a little, which could have a big ripple effect). The Bourbon die-off in 1711/12 is likely butterflied as daily routines are changed. The entire history from 1700 will likely be massively altered.\n\nYou can write the narrative any way you want\n\nI definitely agree. Spain will be quite weak. It won't have the benefits of Philip V's centralizing reforms. It's governed by a divided and unwieldy regency council. The marriage of Joseph will be the most pressing issue for the Junta if it hasn't already been decided as part of the resolution to the succession claims. Marie Louise d'Orleans is a likely French match. I think with a divided Junta Theresa Maria of Portugal might be a could compromise candidate, if she lives. Or given the Sobieski connection through Max Emanuel's wife a marriage with Maria Kazimiera Sobieska could be a possibility as it perhaps could be used to placate her aunt, the dowager Queen Maria Anna.\n\nBeyond that Max Emanuel probably bides his time until Joseph turns 14 and then proclaims himself Curator and has his son recognize his authority. The only danger would be if he acts too imperiously or brings too many Bavarians into the King's household and upsets the Castilians in Madrid. If we was savvy he can appease the Spanish nobility and place the blame for all of Spain's losses since the death of Carlos on Portocarrero in order to neutralize him. Maria Anna's position will only continue to weaken until she becomes utterly irrelevant. So Max Emanuel can probably overturn the Junta de Gobierno in 1707 or 1708 and have his son name him as Governor. Both de Lara and Arias died in 1717 OTL so they can then be replaced by supporters of Max Emanuel. Maybe then something could be accomplished but Spain is going to be pretty much paralyzed through the first 10-20 years of the 1700s until a strong governor comes into office or Joseph can assert himself independently.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if a French controlled Naples gets involved in renewed fighting in the Balkans if the Turks end up back at war with Venice and/or Austria. A Franco-Neapolitan expedition to Albania or Crete or Cyprus would be really interesting. There will also be a looming succession issue in Tuscany, likely tied up in the ATL fate of Isabella Farnese."
