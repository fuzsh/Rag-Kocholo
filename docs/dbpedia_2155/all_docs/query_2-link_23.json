        "text": "By definition, a pretender is a person who lays claim to something – specifically: a claimant to a throne who is held to have no just title. (source: Merriam-Webster.com)\n\nIn the case of former ruling houses and monarchies, this is typically the person who would be the ruling monarch today, following the defined line of succession, if the monarchy was still in existence. For many of the majority of former monarchies, the line of succession is very clear and there exists just one current pretender. However, several involve disputes from various branches of the families, resulting in multiple claimants to the former thrones.\n\nThis area of Unofficial Royalty will include articles about the current, and former, pretenders to the various thrones, and try to best explain the disputes and multiple claims where they exist.\n\nNOTE: Traditionally, former sovereigns continue to use their royal title, but their heirs do not assume a new title upon succeeding them. There is only one instance of a pretender taking on a higher title. Upon the death of King Zog of the Albanians in 1961, his son, Crown Prince Leka, was declared King by the government in exile at the time. However, the monarchy had been abolished 15 years earlier and this declaration held no legal validity. So while many referred to him as King Leka I, he was never actually a reigning sovereign.\n\nLinks attached to the names of the monarchies go to the Unofficial Royalty index for that monarchy.\n\nKINGDOM OF ALBANIA\n\nLAST REIGNING: King Zog I of the Albanians (reigned 1928 – 1939, pretender 1939 – 1961)\n\nFormer: Crown Prince Leka I of the Albanians (pretender 1961 –

PORTUGAL\n\nLAST REIGNING MONARCH: King Manuel II of Portugal (reigned 1908 – 1910, pretender 1910 – 1932)\n\nAfter the childless King Manuel II’s death in 1932, the Portuguese National Assembly authorized the return of the banned branch of the Braganzas, the Miguelist line, the deposed King Miguel I’s descendants. However, Portugal has remained a republic since 1910.\n\nMiguelist Line\n\nLast Reigning: King Miguel I of Portugal (reigned 1828 – 1834, pretender 1834 – 1866)\n\nFormer: Prince Miguel, Duke of Braganza (pretender 1866 -1920)\n\nFormer: Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza (pretender 1920 – 1976)\n\nCurrent: Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza (pretender 1976 – present)\n\nCurrent Heir: Portugal: Afonso, Prince of Beira (born 1996)\n\nKINGDOM OF ROMANIA\n\nLAST REIGNING: King Mihai I of Romania (1st reign 1927 – 1930, 2nd reign 1940 – 1947, pretender 1947 – 2017)\n\nCurrent: Margareta, Custodian of the Crown of Romania (pretender 2017 – present)\n\nCurrent Heir: Princess Elena of Romania (born 1950)\n\nRUSSIAN EMPIRE\n\nThe succession to the former Russian throne has been in dispute, mainly due to disagreements over the validity of marriages. In 1924, after Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich (son of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia and brother of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia) was declared legally dead, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, a male-line grandson of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia, declared himself Guardian of the Throne and later assumed the title Emperor of All Russia. In 1938, upon the death of Kirill Vladimirovich, his son Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich assumed the Headship of the Imperial Family of Russia.\n\nVladimir Kirillovich’s only child, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna (born 1953), claims to have succeeded her father upon his death in 1992. Her claim to the Headship of the Imperial Family of Russia is based on a claim that all male lines of the Romanov family are either extinct, illegitimate, or morganatic, triggering semi-salic succession, and that she is the closest female to the last dynast. Maria Vladimirovna’s claim was disputed by the Romanov Family Association, a private organization of living male-line descendants of Paul I, Emperor of All Russia (except Maria Vladimirovna and her son).\n\nPre-revolutionary Romanov house law allowed only those born of an equal marriage between a Romanov dynast and a member of a royal or sovereign house to be in the line of succession to the Russian throne. The throne could only pass to a female and through the female line upon the extinction of all legitimately-born, male dynasts. Maria Vladimiovna’s mother Princess Leonida of Bagration belonged to a family that had been kings in Georgia from medieval times until the early 19th century. However, no male line ancestor of Leonida had reigned as a king in Georgia since 1505 and her branch of the Bagrations, the House of Mukhrani, had been naturalized as non-ruling nobility of Russia after Georgia was annexed to the Russian empire in 1801. There is a precedent that a marriage between the House of Romanov and the House of Bragation-Mukhrani was unequal. The House of Bragation-Mukhrani did not possess sovereign status and was not recognized as an equal marriage by Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia for the purpose of dynastic marriages at the time of the marriage of Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia and Prince Konstantine Bragation-Mukhrani in 1911, thirty-seven years before the marriage of Princess Leonida of Bragation-Mukhrani and Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia. The couple married but Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna was required to renounce her rights to the Russian throne and she was no longer a member of the House of Romanov because the marriage was unequal.\n\nAfter the death of Vladimir Kirillovich in 1992, Prince Nicholas Romanov claimed that he was the Head of the Imperial Family of Russia. Except for Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, who said that the marriage of Nicholas’ parents was not in conformity with the house laws, Nicholas was recognized by the rest of the family as head of the Romanov family. However, Maria Vladimirovna seems to be more accepted by European royalty and she is sometimes invited to royal events. She attended the 2023 funeral of former King Constantine II of Greece.\n\nDescendants of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia, eldest son of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia.
