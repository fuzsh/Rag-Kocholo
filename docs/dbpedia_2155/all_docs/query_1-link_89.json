        "text": "Prince Ferdinand Philippe Duc d'Orleans and Prince Royale was the eldest son and heir of the Citizen King, Louis-Philippe I. By all accounts he was a popular Prince, thanks in part to his brilliant military career and Liberal ideas. He was considered to be the most popular Member of the Royal Family while he was alive. Sadly he died in a carriage accident in July 1842. Some say that his death is what helped cause his father's over through during the February Revolution of 1848. So what if he didn't die and lived for at least as long as his brothers? Would the July Monarchy have survived 1848? If, not could we have seen a Restoration in the 1870s? Or would we meanly have had a different Orleans Pretender?\n\nI honestly can't see the survival of the prince saving his father's throne. Louis Phillipe was more and more disliked by his people and out of touch as well. If the prince's survival somehow butterflys away the economic problems in 1847, the there is a chance for the survival of the Orleanist monarchy.\n\nI had two thoughts with that regard.\n\n1. A situation similar to the one James II had before James Francis Edward was born could develop. James was unpopular but was tolerated because he had a popular protestant heir. The birth of a Prince of Wales negated this. So Louis-Philippe could be tolerated while waiting for his heir to ascend.\n\n2. During the February Revolution Louis-Philippe abdicated in favor of his grandson, the Comte de Paris, who was 10 years old. There was an attempt to have the Comte de Paris become Louis-Philippe II, with his mother as Regent, but the French Parliament rejected this and proclaimed a Republic. With a popular and of age heir, who had a very successful military career, the Parliament and more importantly the Parisian mobs,might accept Ferdinand-Philippe as King of the French."
