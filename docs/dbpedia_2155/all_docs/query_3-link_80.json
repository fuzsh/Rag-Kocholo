        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nJoseph F. Cullman 3rd, an urbane tobacco man who in the face of rising health concerns about smoking led a relatively lackluster cigarette company called Philip Morris through Marlboro Country to become one of the largest corporations in America and the maker of the best-selling product in the world, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.\n\nHis death was announced by the Cullman family.\n\nMr. Cullman retired as chairman and chief executive in 1978. But 21 years before that and well into the 80's and 90's, he continued to come in regularly to the Philip Morris headquarters in Manhattan, serving as chairman emeritus and playing a crucial role in a multipronged defense of the tobacco industry known as the ''cigarette wars.''\n\nHis dealings involved legions of lobbyists, lawyers, public relations experts and legislators. For many years he contended with and often deflected and delayed calls to curb cigarette smoking and advertising by scientists, public health specialists, legislators, lung-damaged plaintiffs and personal injury lawyers.\n\nWhen the battles intensified, it was Mr. Cullman, who as chief spokesman for the industry, often appeared at Congressional hearings testifying that cigarettes were not a proven health hazard and that manufacturers should not be forced to include warnings on cigarette packages or in their advertisements. Similarly, Mr. Cullman took the lead in efforts to block a ban on cigarette advertising on radio and television, and it was his signature that was affixed to letters to editors pleading for ''objectivity,'' and opposing any rush to judgment on the dangers of tobacco.\n\nIn Jan. 3, 1971, the day that the federal ban on cigarette advertising on television went into effect, Mr. Cullman, who by then had become chairman of the Tobacco Institute's Executive Committee, appeared on the program ''Face the Nation,'' saying, ''I do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous to one's health.''\n\nIn response to a question on the same program about a study that concluded that smoking mothers gave birth to smaller babies than nonsmoking mothers, Mr. Cullman replied, ''Some women would prefer having smaller babies.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
