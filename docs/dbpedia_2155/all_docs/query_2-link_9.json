For a brief moment, his younger brother Philippe, would become heir presumptive to the French throne.\n\nPhilippe was heir presumptive from 1643 until the Dauphin's birth, so not really brief.\n\n. However his brother recovered, and would go on to become one of the longest reigning monarch in history and arguably one of the greatest French Royal Monarchs (Excluding Imperial)\n\nPhilippe himself became the Duke of Orleans, and founded the Bourbon Cadet Branch of the House of Orleans, which would hold that title till 1842, and even go on to rule France in 1830, and until 1848.\n\nAnother fact, is later in life, while Philippe had wives and children, he preferred male lovers, like Chevalier de Lorraine\n\nWhat if, in 1658, Louis XIV succumbed to sickness, meaning his younger brother, OTL Philippe became King of France?\n\nHow could his reign be different of that of his brother Louis XIV in timeline\n\nPhilippe, IMO, wouldn't be MUCH different: shared upbringing/experiences and all that. He'd still marry Maria Teresa of Spain (I don't think France or Spain will pass up the opportunity). Ergo, Minette likely gets a happier marriage (either to Cosmo III de Medici- if her brother isn't restored and she weds as a French proxy - or Emperor Leopold - if she weds as a king's sister). If the former, Marguerite Louise d'Orléans ends up in Lisbon as queen of Portugal or Turin as Duchess of Savoy, if the latter, Margarita Teresa might marry Karl Joseph of Austria and get a decent shot at having more than one surviving kids.\n\nHHow would Philippe VII rule? He was a far better military commander than Louis XIV (it was why after the battle of Cassel, Monsieur was never allowed command of an army again). And he was also far more financially savvy than his brother - he laid the foundations for the Orléans fortune down the line - so I doubt we'd get Versailles. That said, how bellicose and conquest oriented Philippe VII would be, I have no idea\n\nNever say never, but Louis never saw a peace he couldn't turn into a war, so it's hard to believe Philippe could be any worse. Louis also had the knack of not doing so well in his wars. Again, never say never, but maybe Philippe can manage to do better in the wars he does get involved with.\n\nThen, we have the Huguenots. Louis decided to outlaw them, leading to many of them leaving. Brain drain from France, and a growing hatred of Catholic France in the Protestant countries. Religious strife would still be present, but would it be as driving a force?\n\nLots of butterfly considerations: no reason to think this would affect Philip IV of Spain's reproductive history (although it is possible, perhaps his daily routine is altered due to an altered war, and he fathers a different Carlos, who is not bewitched), so how would Philippe react to the crisis of the Spanish Succession? No matter how it goes, there are different actors on stage, so Spain will get a completely different line of Kings, meaning there's another massive branch of alternate history.\n\nNorth America: with potentially much fewer wars in Europe, New France will see a little more effort. This was always the plan, but France never had resources due to Louis' penchant for war. Even a little bit of change makes a difference. And, with an entirely different set of wars in the meanwhile, the fate of New Spain and/or USA may go differently, making for another massive branch of alternate history.\n\nBottom line, history is completely different.\n\nNever say never, but Louis never saw a peace he couldn't turn into a war, so it's hard to believe Philippe could be any worse.

No matter how it goes, there are different actors on stage, so Spain will get a completely different line of Kings, meaning there's another massive branch of alternate history.\n\nWell Mariana could always die in childbirth with her third child, leading to a third marriage of Philip IV (at this point he has still a son or two if Mariana died but her child lived) who will be likely to a French princess so either Anne Marie Louise d’Orleans, who is already in her 30s but could still give him heirs and was very rich, or her behalf-sister Marguerite Louise, barely 14 years old and either of them would birth a very different Charles II as they had (almost) no Habsburg blood (their grandmother Marie de’Medici had an Habsburg mother, but she was a daughter of Ferdinand I meaning who the Orleans sisters were only third cousins of Philip, while Mariana‘s parents were the sister and a first cousin of Philip)\n\nThat said, how bellicose and conquest oriented Philippe VII would be, I have no idea\n\nCompletely agree with everything else and I think this is the defining question. My assumption is that he still pursues a war with Spain after Philip dies but I'm not so sure about the Franco-Dutch war. Obviously there were myriad causes but one major one was Louis' thirst for gloire. Philippe may be satisfied with whatever he gets from Spain in the 1660s,\n\nAnother issue down the road will be the Huguenots. I would tend to think that Philippe would be shrewd enough not to mess with the religious settlement in France. Taken together those two things could have huge effects as it could forestall the formation of a broad anti-French coalition in Europe.\n\nWell Mariana could always die in childbirth with her third child, leading to a third marriage of Philip IV (at this point he has still a son or two if Mariana died but her child lived) who will be likely to a French princess so either Anne Marie Louise d’Orleans, who is already in her 30s but could still give him heirs and was very rich, or her behalf-sister Marguerite Louise, barely 14 years old and either of them would birth a very different Charles II as they had (almost) no Habsburg blood (their grandmother Marie de’Medici had an Habsburg mother, but she was a daughter of Ferdinand I meaning who the Orleans sisters were only third cousins of Philip, while Mariana‘s parents were the sister and a first cousin of Philip)\n\nIf Philip was looking for a new wife around '59-61 I think Henriette would be a candidate. Her brothers had fought on the Spanish side at the end after Mazarin dumped them in favor of an alliance with Cromwell. She's also a French princess in many ways and could be an ersatz French bride but without the risk of transferring Montpensier's large French estates into Spanish hands (though the French could always invoke the droit d'aubaine when she dies to confiscate them).\n\nCompletely agree with everything else and I think this is the defining question.

And Philip IV at this point has two sons so I can see Mazarin and Philip VII (who is trying to get Maria Teresa as wife) only saying who the estates of Anne Marie Louise could be inherited only by her own children and can not belong to the King of Spain. An interesting consequence of a wedding between Philip IV and Anne Marie Louise is who not only Philip will likely have an healthy son able to father children of his own and so the Spanish Habsburg will live at least for another couple of generation but also who France would NOT get any kind of right of succession to Spain as Maria Teresa’s dowry to Philip VII would be fully paid (most likely with the French estates of the Queen of Spain)\n\nWell Mariana could always die in childbirth with her third child, leading to a third marriage of Philip IV (at this point he has still a son or two if Mariana died but her child lived) who will be likely to a French princess so either Anne Marie Louise d’Orleans, who is already in her 30s but could still give him heirs and was very rich, or her behalf-sister Marguerite Louise, barely 14 years old and either of them would birth a very different Charles II as they had (almost) no Habsburg blood (their grandmother Marie de’Medici had an Habsburg mother, but she was a daughter of Ferdinand I meaning who the Orleans sisters were only third cousins of Philip, while Mariana‘s parents were the sister and a first cousin of Philip)\n\nIf you're writing a TL, you can write in this narrative, but...\n\nsaid it before, I'll say it again: for What Ifs, I prefer the butterflies to be rational outcomes of the POD. There's no real reason for Philip's daily routine to be altered, so OTL would likely ensue. But, anything after POD is fair game, which is why I mentioned it. Placing a hypothetical bet on life in Spain between '58 and 65, without an ALT author's intervention, I'd bet that Philip's offspring are exactly as OTL.\n\nIf Mariana dies in childbed with Carlos II\n\nWhat in the POD of Louis dying would cause Mariana to die in ATL? Unless there's some cause and effect, this is a separate POD.\n\nNow, perhaps (long shot, but still a possibility), Philip, upon hearing the news of Louis' death, weeps with joy and decides to celebrate by doing the horizontal bop with Mariana, and thus sires a different male heir. Or maybe Philippe (France) sends an envoy to Spain for some reason, and as a result Philip (Spain) has a different daily schedule because of it, and thus sires alternate offspring. Something from Philippe becoming King must result in Philip changing his routine from OTL. My guess is that sans major action by Philippe, events in Spain remain the same.\n\nWhat in the POD of Louis dying would cause Mariana to die in ATL?

My guess is that sans major action by Philippe, events in Spain remain the same.\n\nAs I said, Mariana nearly died in the delivery of either Carlos II or the son before him (Fernando?), both after the POD. I suspect that her nearly dying in the delivery was why there were no kids AFTER Carlos II. It's the Spanish Court, she wouldn't be the first queen to die in childbed because they relied on a priest instead of a doctor\n\nWhat in the POD of Louis dying would cause Mariana to die in ATL?

Something from Philippe becoming King must result in Philip changing his routine from OTL. My guess is that sans major action by Philippe, events in Spain remain the same.\n\nWell, considering who Mariana had difficult childbirths in OTL and at least once she was close to and spanish doctors were NOT the best and many Spanish queens died in childbirth is not unreasonable. If you want a direct effect, well in OTL Louis (and so ATL Philippe) in this timeframe was in war with Spain and trying to get Maria Teresa as bride so I am pretty sure who Philip will receive a different letter in a different day from Philippe and would have a different reaction than OTL determining changes in Spain…\n\nIt would be interesting if Philippe decides to ally with the Dutch against England, so no War of Devolution?\n\nMuch depends on whether Philippe follows the same line of thinking as Louis that the Spanish Netherlands are essential to gain, and his strategy to take them.\n\nTaking SN puts Dutch into the opposition camp, so the alliance has to come before taking SN. Philippe could decide to ally with England to defeat the Dutch first, then take SN. Or he could ally with the Dutch to defeat England first, then turn on the Dutch in taking SN.\n\nOr, he could decide SN isn't worth the hassle/enmity of the rest of Europe. That leaves him free to ally with the Dutch, although for what gain? Might be better to let England and Dutch keep smacking each other.\n\nOr, he could conduct the war better, and take SN. OTL, Louis backed off, and gave back a lot, thinking he would get it through treaty when Carlos II died, which was expected any day. Carlos lived for another few decades, though. Philippe might decide to continue the conquest, then worry about Spain later.\n\nOr, IF, through tiny butterflies leading to huge effect, there may be a healthy Spanish infant King (or Queen), meaning Philippe would continue the conquest.\n\nHaving a different French King means there's endless ripple effects/possibilities.\n\nI think any chance of the Dutch abrogating the Treaty of Munster and resuming hostilities with Spain died with William II. After that power passed back into the hands of those in Holland who were quite content with the peace. War with Spain would have been costly, would have had short turn impacts on trade, and in the long run any reclaimed territory in Flanders could have siphoned commerce away from Amsterdam. And William's attempted coup had made clear the dangers of concentrating power in the hands of a wartime military commander.\n\nSo if Philippe goes to war with Spain after Philip IV dies (which I still think is likely) I think the Dutch reaction is more likely to be as it was ITOL, concern over French expansion, than any desire to jump in and carve off a slice for themselves.\n\nI could see Philippe being more aggressive. Looking to make a final settlement of the Spanish question. Though that probably depends on who the Spanish heir to Philp is. If its a weak or sickly son like Carlos was OTL then the same possibility exists to wait him out and claim all of Spain in a few years. However if that seems less likely if Philip leaves a healthy heir behind then Philippe might press for more of the Spanish Netherlands, Franche Comte etc, maybe an invasion of Catalonia or Navarre."
