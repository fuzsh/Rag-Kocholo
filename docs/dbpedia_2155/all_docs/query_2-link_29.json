        "text": "Hugues Capet used the title, Duke of France, as well as Count of Paris.\n\nSo both of these titles, used nowadays by the head of the Bourbon house, are originally Capetian.\n\nPlease note - the Bourbons descend in a direct male line from Hugh Capet. The present Comte de Paris descends directly from Henry IV, first Bourbon King of France, and he himself descends directly from Robert Capet, a younger son of King St Louis, who married the heiress of the Bourbon title and founded the junior Capetian branch of Bourbon.\n\n---------------------\n\nWilliam the Conqueror was Duke of Normandy and the title was held by his descendants, as a fief of the French Crown.\n\nFrom the time of Edward III onwards, the English king also styled himself \"King of France\".\n\nSo Queen Elizabeth is not only Duchess of Normandy but also Queen of France.\n\nBoth her \"Kingdom of France\" and \"Duchy of Normandy\" are limited to the Channel Islands, since the rest obviously has been lost long ago Kinda like Taiwan, I believe, who style themselves \"China\" although they lost mainland China long time ago.\n\nHowever, I do believe that there were a number of French princes who held the title \"Duc de Normandie\" throughout the ages, although I don't believe any of them survived to adulthood or had any issue.\n\nA few years ago Prince Charles Emmanuel de Bourbon de Parme requested to have the form of address Son Altesse Royale.\n\nHis lawyer, Maître Rosny Minvielle de Guilhem de Lataillade, explained: \"The Republic abolished the monarchy, but not the nobility. It is normal for my client to be designated by the qualification of a Royal Highness. President M Nicolas Sarkozy, in his written response to the letter from the Prince de Bourbon de Parme, who asked for the exhibition (a much provoking exhibition by Jeff Koons) to be closed, named him 'Monseigneur'.\n\nBaron Hervé de Pinoteau, historian and, among others, member of the International Academy of Heraldry, was for twenty-six years the private secretary of the late Don Alfonso de Borbón (father of Don Luis Alfonso de Borbón): \"In 1986, the prefect of Hérault [M Yves-Jean Bentegeac], received a letter from the Palais de l'Elysée which ordered him to award all titles of nobility, including the qualification of a Royal Highness to Prince Alphonse\".\n\nThis qualification on identity papers has no legal existence. \"HRH is not a strictly legal statement. It is a qualification, not a title,” he explains. Unlike titles of nobility (Duke, Baron, Count...), which have retained a legal basis. Which means that 'HRH' accompanies the title of nobility - one is a Royal Highness and Duke of Anjou at the same time.\n\n“It is an administrative friendliness, a deference towards the three dynasties, the three families which once reigned over France, even if legally, it is not founded. Let us not forget that France is, above all, a country of customary law.\n\nOnly princes of blood the blood of the Houses Bourbon, Orléans, and Napoléon, can obtain it, and from birth.\"\n\nBaron de Pinoteau: \"It is, in a way, the recognition of royal dignity. This distinction depends on the goodwill of the prefect or the competent minister. It is, neither more nor less, a kindness of the Republic.\"\n\n“President M Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, who wanted to play both the man of the people as well the grand seigneur, made the titles of nobility disappear from the protocol of the Republic”, remembers Baron Hervé de Pinoteau. With the exception of the Duke of Orléans (Count of Paris) and the Duke of Anjou, who continued to be designated by their title within the walls of the Palais de l'Éysée. 'I think governments say to themselves: these princes are not dangerous people, so why make fun of them?'\n\nCertainly, but then, why add it to identity papers, if it is simply a matter of protocol? In the Bourbon-Parme case against expo Koons, the prince's lawyer attached a copy of the passport (with HRH) to the investigation file, as did M Nicolas Sarkozy's letter. Two documents supposed to give credibility to his client's request.\n\nAround 90 royal blooded people are said to have the qualification of HRH on their identity papers today. They do not all reside in France, dynastic confusion oblige.\n\nSource: https://www.nouvelobs.com/rue89/rue...rivileges-pour-princes-de-sang.html#modal-msg\n\nThank you for summarizing the paywalled article.\n\nInteresting that the French republic recognizes as \"princes\" men who would not have been French princes on the basis of the dynastic protocol in effect while France was still a monarchy, since they were descended from members of the house who expatriated themselves and became members of foreign royal houses.\n\nIf the historian is correct that \"Only princes of blood of the Houses Bourbon, Orléans, and Napoléon\" can obtain the HRH on their passports, then whose competence is it to adjudicate whether someone requesting an HRH is a \"prince of the blood\"? And what about princesses?\n\nThank you for summarizing the paywalled article.\n\nInteresting that the French republic recognizes as \"princes\" men who would not have been French princes on the basis of the dynastic protocol in effect while France was still a monarchy, since they were descended from members of the house who expatriated themselves and became members of foreign royal houses.\n\nIf the historian is correct that \"Only princes of blood of the Houses Bourbon, Orléans, and Napoléon\" can obtain the HRH on their passports, then whose competence is it to adjudicate whether someone requesting an HRH is a \"prince of the blood\"? And what about princesses?\n\nAnother point is that, as far as I understand, not all \"princes du sang\" were HRHs, but rather only those who were \"enfants\" or \"petits-enfants\" of France. Princes of the blood not in the preceding categories were originally accorded the style of Serene Highness only in the \"Ancien Régime\", although I believe that, towards the end of the Bourbon restoration and in the Orléanist monarchy, they were indeed upgraded to \"Royal Highness\".\n\nFurthermore, \"Royal Highness\" was not a common style of address in France, not even in third person citations. As the lawyer acknowledges, a prince of the Royal House would be addressed or even cited as \"Monseigneur\", rather than \"Royal Highness\","
