Philippe d’Orléans, count de Paris (born Aug. 24, 1838, Paris, Fr.—died Sept. 8, 1894, Stow House, Twickenham, Middlesex, Eng.) was a pretender to the French throne after the death of Louis-Philippe (1850). The death of his father, Ferdinand, Duke d’Orléans, son and heir of King Louis-Philippe, in 1842 made the young Philippe heir to the throne and the candidate of the Orleanists. The title of Count de Paris was created for him.

During the Revolution of 1848 he was taken into exile in England. He and his brother Robert, Duke de Chartres, served as volunteers under the Federal general George B. McClellan in the American Civil War in 1861–62. Back in England, the count married his cousin, Isabelle d’Orléans-Montpensier, in 1864.
