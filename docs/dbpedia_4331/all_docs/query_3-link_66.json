        "text": "JANUARY:\n\nJanuary 16, 1974: Mickey is elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY in his first year of eligibility. In addition to Mickey, his close friend Whitey Ford is also elected, along with Negro League star Cool Papa Bell and umpire Jocko Conlan. The induction ceremony is scheduled for August 12, 1974. (Mickey's Hall of Fame plaque is shown in the picture on the right. It reads, \"Mickey Charles Mantle New York A. L. 1951 - 1968 Hit 536 home runs, won league homer title and slugging crown four times. Made 2415 hits. Batted .300 or over in each of ten years with top of .365 in 1957. Topped A. L. in walks five years and in runs scored six seasons. voted Most Valuable Player 1956-57-62. Named on 20 A. L. All-Star Teams. Set World Series Records for Homers, 18; Runs, 42; Runs Batted In, 40; Total Bases, 125; and Bases on Balls, 45.\")\n\nFEBRUARY:\n\nFeb. 2, 1954: Mickey enters the hospital in Springfield, MO to undergo surgery to have a cyst removed from his right knee by Dr. Dan Yancey. Mickey had surgery the previous November to have cartilage removed from the same knee.\n\nFeb. 2, 1959: The grand opening for Mickeys bowling alley is held in Dallas, TX. Mickey, Billy Martin, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford and other Yankees players attend to help kick-off Mickey's new business.\n\nFeb. 3, 1954: Mickey undergoes surgery in Springfield, MO to have a cyst removed from his right knee by Dr. Dan Yancey, the same knee that was operated on to remove cartilage the previous November. The cyst had been in the tendon muscle of his hamstring since his knee injury in the 1951 World Series, but fluid didnt accumulate until he tested his knee after his November surgery.\n\nFeb. 3, 1957: The New York Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America presents Mickey their Player of the Year plaque, the Mercer Award, at an awards dinner at the Waldorf Astoria. The award is named after baseball writer Sid Mercer as a memorial.\n\nFeb. 3, 1957: At the NY Baseball Writers Association dinner Casey Stengel says, Mickey is the greatest hitter Ive seen  for distance  as a modern-age ballplayer. Ive seen hit balls so far in this park (Yankee Stadium) and in Washington that even the President came out to see him twice.\n\nFeb. 4, 1954: Mickeys doctors say that Mickey will be as good as new and feeling fine when he reports to spring training after his surgery yesterday to remove a cyst from his right knee. They also say that he will be up and around tomorrow, and that the 22-year-old switch-hitter will probably be released from the hospital next week.\n\nFeb. 4, 1957: After winning the Triple Crown in 1956, difficult, sometimes bitter salary negotiations and a holdout, Mickey signs his contract for the 1957 season for $60,000. The $27,500 raise is the largest raise of his career. Adjusted for inflation, his $60,000 salary was equivalent to approximately $500,000 in 2013, a steal by any standard.\n\nFeb. 5, 1954: Its announced that Mickey is recovering ahead of schedule after surgery to remove a cyst from his right knee and will leave the hospital tomorrow.\n\nFeb. 5, 1962: After over 35 years in St. Petersburg, the Yankees open their new million dollar spring training facility in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The team is quartered in a hotel appropriately named, The Yankee Clipper.\n\nFeb. 5, 1966: The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN announces that Mickey is leaving St. Marys Hospital after surgery to remove a bone chip from his right shoulder. He will remain at the Mayo Clinic for several weeks of physical therapy. A clinic spokesman says Mickey was doing well recovering from the operation, but made no comment whether Mickey would be ready for spring training.\n\nFeb. 6, 1954: Mickey leaves the hospital on crutches in Springfield, MO after knee surgery performed by Dr. Dan Yancey to remove a cyst from the back of his right knee. He had surgery on the same knee the previous November to remove cartilage. His 17-year-old twin brothers, Ray and Roy, drive him home to Commerce, Oklahoma by automobile.\n\nFeb. 6, 1970: In a Pro-Am golf tournament in Phoenix Mickey, paired with football great Joe Namath, makes a remarkable shot out of a lake to just a couple of feet from the hole. One spectator is so shocked he falls backward into the lake!\n\nFeb. 7, 1959: Mickey uses the only leverage baseball players had before free agency to try to get a better salary. He refuses to sign his Yankees contract for the 1957 season and holds out for a better salary.\n\nFeb. 8, 1959: Mickey says he will never set foot in St. Pete until he reaches terms with the Yankees on a new contract for the 1959 season. The Yankees want Mickey to take a pay cut from last years $75,000 salary  Mickey wants a raise to $80,000.\n\nFeb.9, 1952: Mickey signs his contract for the 1952 season and returns it to the Yankees. Says Mickey, Its a pretty good contract. Mickey receives the same salary he was paid his rookie year, $7,500. Adjusted for inflation, $7,500 in 1952 was equivalent to about $64,000 today. Its $2,500 over the $5,000 major league minimum, which is now is $79,000 a year.\n\nFeb. 11, 1952: Mickey arrives in New York for a check-up on his right knee, injured in the 1951 World Series. The exam will be performed by the Yankees team doctor, Dr. Sidney Gaynor.\n\nFeb. 11, 1952: New York Yankees General Manager Roy Hamey acknowledges receiving Mickey's signed contract for the 1952 season.\n\nFeb. 13, 1954: The Yankees sign outfielder Irv Noren as a backup center-fielder in case Mickey is slow to recover from his two knee surgeries. Yankees PR man Red Patterson says, With Mickeys condition doubtful right now Casey has to worry about that, and Noren is the guy who will have to take over if Mantle doesnt recover from that cyst operation on the back of his right knee.\n\nFeb. 14, 1962: M&M mania continues! Shooting begins on the film Safe at Home, written especially for and starring Mickey and his teammate and friend Roger Maris, at the Yankees new million dollar spring training complex in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nFeb. 14, 1965: Mickey signs his Yankees contract for the 1965 season, his third straight $100,000 contract. It makes him the highest paid player in baseball for the sixth year in a row. (After adjusting for inflation, $100,000 in 1965 is equivalent to about $729,000 in 2013.

(Adjusted for inflation, $25,000 in 1955 was equivalent to about $220,000 in 2013.)\n\nFeb.15, 1965: Mickey signs his Yankees contract for the 1965 season, his third straight $100,000 contract. It makes him the highest paid player in baseball for the sixth year in a row. (After adjusting for inflation, $100,000 in 1965 was equivalent to about $728,000 in 2013. In contrast, the average MLB salary in 2012 was over $3.3 million and the minimum salary was $414,500.)\n\nFeb. 16, 1954: Mickey, still on crutches after knee surgery, says he expects to join his teammates in spring training on March first in St. Petersburg. Mickey remains unsigned for the 1954 season.\n\nFeb.16, 1961: Mickey signs his contract for the 1961 season for $75,000, a $10,000 raise over his 1960 salary. It makes him the highest paid player in baseball. (Adjusted for inflation, $75,000 is equivalent to about $575,000 in 2013.)\n\nFeb. 17, 1952: The NY Times reports that outfielder Jackie Jensen says that he will beat out Mickey as the center-field replacement for Joe DiMaggio in spring training. The Times got the story off the wire from a story written by a reporter in Oakland, California.\n\nFeb. 17, 1956: In Miami Mickey shoots a 99 in the National Baseball Players Golf Championship to finish in the top 20 in the Major League division.\n\nFeb. 18, 1959: Its reported that the Yankees have asked Mickey to accept a good behavior clause in his 1959 contract  Mickey refuses.\n\nFeb. 19, 1959: After an initial offer of $60,000 - a $10,000 pay cut - Mickey signs his contract for the 1959 season for $72,000, a $2,000 raise.\n\nFeb. 20, 1954: Mickey declares his right knee is in good shape after surgery to remove a cyst behind his right knee and that it will stand up to a full seasons play.\n\nFeb. 21, 1953: Mickey attends the National Sportsmans Show in NY at the Grand Central Palace, demonstrating how to tie fly fishing ties.\n\nFeb. 21, 1957: Mickey reports to spring training in St. Petersburg after playing in golf tournaments in Miami and Lake Worth, FL.\n\nFeb. 21, 1958: After tough negotiations with Yankees General Manager George Weiss and threatening to hold-out, and despite a career high .365 batting avg. in 1957, Mickey signs his 1958 contract for $70,000, just a $10,000 raise. Weiss justified the contract by saying that Mickey hadn't won another Triple Crown in 1957 like he had in 1956.\n\nFeb. 21, 1959: Yogi Berra unwittingly starts a rumor that The Mick has come to training camp when he is overheard saying he played 18 holes of golf with Mickey. Mickey is actually in Texas, contract unsigned, holding out for a raise to his salary. It turns out Berra played golf with a different Mickey, St. Pete local farmer and restaurateur Chicken Mickey.\n\nFeb. 22, 1952: Mickey, convalescing from his World Series knee injury, participates in the Yankees opening spring training drills. Hes the only outfielder to participate other than a dozen battery-men (pitchers and catchers). Although still limping, Mickey says he has no pain and expects to be as good as ever after his spring training strengthening and conditioning drills.\n\nFeb. 22, 1954: Mickey, along with 23 other players, remains unsigned for the 1954 season, but isnt due to report to spring training in St. Petersburg, FL until March 1st.\n\nFeb. 23, 1951: Mickeys a no-show at spring training - he doesn't have the train fare. The team can't reach him because his family doesn't own a phone. A local sportswriter locates Mickey so the Yankees can wire him the train fare to spring training in Phoenix, where the Yankees have swapped facilities with the NY Giants, who train at the Yankees camp in St. Pete, FL.\n\nFeb. 23, 1952: Observers say Mickey, still limping from his World Series knee injury, wont play as a regular until late in the exhibition season.\n\nFeb. 23, 1955: One of Mickeys twin brothers, Roy, stars at bat the second day in a row, hitting a homer and a single in the Yankees' rookie camp.\n\nFeb. 24, 1953: After strained contract negotiations, Mickey signs his 1953 contract for $17,500, more than double the $7,500 salary he made in 1951 and 1952.\n\nFeb. 24, 1960: After a lengthy salary dispute Mickey finally signs his 1960 contract for $65,000, a $7,000 pay cut. However, it's $10,000 more than the Yankees' original offer of $55,000 that represented a $17,000 pay cut! It's the first and only pay cut of The Mick's career.\n\nFeb. 25, 1951: Playing a game of pepper on his first day of spring training, Mickey bats a ball that smacks a passing player in the shin. It's Joe DiMaggio. That's how Mickey first meets the Yankee Clipper!\n\nFeb. 25, 1955: Mickey arrives early for spring training at the Yankees' training facility in St. Petersburg, FL.

Says Yogi Berra, It left nobody feelin hurt at nobody. (Photo of Mickey with Jackie Jensen in Boston on the right.)\n\nFeb 26, 1955: In his Sports of the Times column, writer Arthur Daley declares that 1955 could be a year of decision for Mickey.\n\nFeb. 26, 1959: On the first day of spring training Mickey officially becomes a holdout when he doesnt report, his 1959 contract unsigned.\n\nFeb. 26, 1962: Shooting of \"Safe at Home\" - a film written especially for and starring Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris - is completed at the Yankees' new Fort Lauderdale spring training facility. The film is in response to \"M&M Boys\" mania, generated by the 1961 home run race between Mickey and Roger, when Roger broke Babe Ruth's single-season home run record by hitting 61 home runs.\n\nFeb. 27, 1952: Yankees physician, Dr. Sidney Gaynor, examines Mickey knee, injured in the 51 World Series, and again expresses satisfaction with the way it is coming along.\n\nFeb 27, 1954: Mickey signs his 1954 contract with the Yankees for $22,500 and is immediately leaving his home in Commerce, Oklahoma by car for spring training.

Trainer Gene Mauch asks Mickey to not participate in the Baseball Players Golf Tournament in Tampa.\n\nFeb 27, 1963: Mickey finally joins the elite six-figure club in baseball when he signs his 1963 contract for $100,000. It makes Mickey the highest paid player in baseball and is his highest career salary. Only Joe DiMaggio has been paid $100,000 prior to Mickey. (Adjusted for inflation, $100,000 in 1963 is equivalent to about $750,000 in 2011 - a steal by today's standards.)\n\nFeb. 27, 1969: Mickey Mantle and Joe Namath, teamed together at the American Airlines golf classic, shoot a 12 under par 60 to place just one shot behind the leaders on the first day of the tournament.\n\nFeb. 28, 1959: Casey Stengel tells reporters that Mickey could become the top earner in baseball, forecasting a $150,000 yearly salary.\n\nFeb. 28, 1969: Ralph Houk says that how the Yankees play for the 1969 season hinges on Mickey.\n\nFeb. 29, 1952: Mickey bears down in spring training drills, running hard and in spurts with no trace of a limp. Oddly, only when he slows down does he still show a slight limp.\n\nMARCH:\n\nMarch 1, 1969: Mickey announces his retirement from baseball at a press conference at Yankee Stadium in New York. Mickey played 18 seasons for the Yankees, from 1951-1968. He played a total of 2,401 games, the most games of any Yankees player. (Photo on the right.)\n\nMarch 11, 1956: In a spring training game in St. Petersburg against the St. Louis Cardinals Mickey crushes a spectacular home run over the left-field bleachers, across a street and into Tampa Bay. (The path of this home run is shown by the middle arrow in the photo on the left. Photo of the field was taken after the bleachers were removed.)\n\nMarch 26, 1951: Mickey crushes two epic, monster home runs in an exhibition game played at Bovard Field at the University of Southern California (USC). Both are hit left-handed. The first - a moon shot if ever there was one - left the park in right-centerfield, crossed a football field adjacent to the baseball diamond then short-hopped a low wall out of the facility and onto a neighboring street, never to be seen again. The exact spot where it landed was witnessed by legendary USC coach Rod Dedeaux and center-fielder Tom Riach. Each led observers to the landing point they saw, which were a mere two feet apart. It may the longest home run ever measured, traveling a mythic 656 feet! Mickey's second homer is also remarkable: an opposite-field blast that travels well over 500 feet. It sails out of the park, across the street bordering the field, then crashes into the second-story porch of the third house down down the street. He also triples and, in his final at-bat, uses his world-class speed to beat out a routine grounder for a single. His box score for the game: 5-AB, 4-H, 2-HR, 1-3B, 1-1B, 7-RBI. (The red arrows in the diagram above left show the paths of both homers.)\n\nAPRIL:\n\nApril 9, 1965: Mickey hits the first home run ever in the Houston Astrodome in an exhibition game against the Houston Astros. Leading off the sixth inning, Mickey crushes a high drive off Astros' pitcher Turk Farrell that lands in centerfield near the 406 foot marker. Mickey also got the first hit in the Astrodome, a single to center to lead off the first inning. (In the photo on the right Mickey waits for the pitch from Astros' pitcher Turk Farrell that he slammed into the centerfield seats for the first home run ever hit at the Astrodome in Houston.)\n\nApril 10, 1962: Mickey hits his last Opening Day home run. It goes some 425 feet into the right-centerfield bleachers at Yankee Stadium as the Yankees nip Baltimore 7-6.\n\nApril 12, 1953: Mickey's first son, Mickey Jr., is born.\n\nApril 13, 1955: Mickey homers on Opening Day for the first time.\n\nApril 17, 1951: Mickey makes his Yankees debut against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium before nearly 45,000 fans. Whitey Ford, on leave from the Army, throws out the first pitch. Mickey gets his first hit, a single in the sixth inning that drives in his first run, as the Yankees shut out the Red Sox 5-0. Mickey goes 1-for-4 with an rbi and a run scored.\n\nApril 17, 1953: Mickey, batting right-handed, blasts a monster 565-foot homer out of Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC. Yankees PR director Red Patterson coins the term \"tape measure home run\" by measuring the homer during the game. It may be the most famous home run ever hit. The Guinness Book of World Records lists it as the longest home run to be measured at the time it was hit.\n\n(The photo on the above right illustrates the path of Mickey's homer. Mickey is shown batting left-handed but he hit the home run right-handed. The yellow arrow in the diagram below the photo shows how far it went after it left Griffith Stadium.)\n\nApril 17, 1956: Mickey belts two tremendous Opening Day homers against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC. President Eisenhower cheers Mickey from his seat behind the Senators dugout. Both homers are searing line drives hit left-handed off Camilo Pascual. Each goes over 500 feet, clearing the 31-foot wall in centerfield. The first homer lands atop a house across from the park. The second homer ricochets off a tree growing in a clump of trees outside the park. It caroms out and onto adjacent Fifth Street. Only Babe Ruth had ever hit a ball into the trees outside Griffith Stadium, and he only did it once. (In the diagram on the left Mickey's two Opening Day homers are shown in red. The red arrow in the center shows the path of Mickey's first home run that landed atop a house across Fifth Street. The red arrow on the left shows the path of his second home run that ricocheted off a tree behind the centerfield wall and then caromed out onto Fifth Street. For comparison, the yellow arrow shows the path of his 565-foot homer hit on April 17, 1953, exactly two years earlier.)\n\nApril 20, 1951: Mickey plays his first major league game at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMAY:\n\nMay 1, 1951: Mickey hits his first major league home run at Comiskey Park in Chicago. The ball travels nearly 500 feet.\n\nMay 1, 1956: Mickey begins the scoring with a first-inning solo home run to right-field that just clears Al Kalines glove, who makes a leaping stab at the ball in an attempt to take Mickeys homer away from him, and the Bombers go on to beat the Tigers 9-2 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 2, 1961: In the Yankees first game ever in Minnesota, Mickey hammers a tenth-inning grand slam over the 402-foot sign on the screen in center-field to give them a 6-4 win over the Twins. Its only the sixth extra-inning grand slam in Yankees history. The Yankees are 10-5, and seven of their ten wins are due to Mickeys clutch hitting. How sweet it is!\n\nMay 3, 1956: Mickey goes 2-for-2 with 2 runs, 2 rbi and his first right-handed homer of the year, a titanic 440-foot blast deep into the left-field seats, giving him seven homers and 18 rbi on the year. Despite three Yankees homers theyre nipped by the As in the ninth by a bunt and a sacrifice and lose 8-7 to the Kansas City Athletics at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 4, 1951: Mickeys second career home run is an historic and formidable 500-plus-foot blast that flies over the roof and completely out of Sportsmans Park in St. Louis as the red hot Bronx Bombers win their sixth straight game. (The path of The Mick's blast at Sportsman's Park is shown in the diagram on the right.)\n\nMay 4, 1961: Mickey wins a case of beer by hitting a home run directly into the teeth of a 25-mph wind in a 5-2 win in Minnesota after the Twins pitcher, Ted Sadowski, bets The Mick a case of beer that he cant homer with the wind blowing in at him. While rounding third base Mickey yells to Sadowski, on the mound in shock after witnessing Micks amazing feat, Ill take Budweiser!\n\nMay 5, 1956: Mickey hits his first home run to strike the façade at Yankee Stadium. It's off righty Moe Burtschy of the Kansas City A's and his second homer of the game as the Yankees win 5-2. It's his first homer to nearly go out of Yankee Stadium. A's broadcaster Merle Harmon says, \"If not for the roof, it would have hit the subway across the street!\" (The path of Mickey's first façade shot at Yankee Stadium is diagrammed in the photo on the right.)\n\nMay 5, 1957: Mickey goes 3-for-3 with a walk, a run, 2 rbi, a stolen base and a two-run homer into the top deck in left-field at Comiskey Park in Chicago for a 5-2 win over the White Sox.\n\nMay 5, 1962: Mickey goes 2-for-4 with 2 runs scored, a run-batted-in, and a two-run homer deep into the third deck in right-field as the Yankees nip the Washington Senators 7-6 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 6, 1962: Mickey goes 4-for-8 with 3 runs, 5 rbi and 3 homers in a doubleheader split against the Senators at Yankee Stadium. His tape-measure shot in the first game goes 460-feet into the last row of the right-field bleachers. In the second game Mickey switch-hits homers for the ninth time in his career  only one player in the American League had done it before, and only once.\n\nMay 6, 1962:Mickey goes 4-for-8 with 3 runs, 5 rbi and 3 homers in a doubleheader split against the Senators at Yankee Stadium. His tape-measure shot in the first game goes 460-feet into the last row of the right-field bleachers. In the second game Mickey switch-hits homers for the ninth time in his career  only one player in the American League had done it before, and only once.\n\nMay 6, 1963: Mickey goes 3-for-3 with a walk, a run, 3 rbi, a sacrifice fly and a bazooka shot home run to the upper deck in left-field to beat the Tigers 10-3 at Tiger Stadium in Detroit.\n\nMay 6, 1964: Mickey goes 3-for-8 with a walk, 2 runs, 5 rbi and his first two homers of the year, one in each game of a doubleheader split against the Senators at DC Stadium in Washington.\n\nMay 6, 1968: Mickey passes Ted Williams for fourth in the all-time career home runs with #522, a two-run shot into the lower deck in right off Indians lefty Sam McDowell in a 3-2 loss in NY. McDowell, who breaks the AL record this day for Ks in consecutive games with 30, later says it was a change-up in which I knew that I had him fooled, yet he hit it out to the opposite field.\n\nMay 6, 1998 (14 Years): WCBS-TV in New York reports that the FBI maintains a 29-page file on Mickey. They say it contains a report that an unidentified blackmailer tried to extort $15,000 from Mickey after he was caught in a compromising situation with a married woman, that he received calls from a known gambler in 1963 and letters threatening to shoot him.\n\nMay 7, 1954: Mickeys sky-high howitzer blast over the 402-foot sign in left soars over 425 feet, past the double rows of box seats, and leads the Bombers to a 2-0 win over the Philadelphia Athletics at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 7, 1955: Mickey launches a towering solo home run in the eighth deep to dead center-field in Fenway Park to put the Yankees ahead for good as the Bombers beat the Red Sox 9-6.\n\nMay 7, 1998 (14 Years): The FBI confirms that it kept a 29-page file on Mickey. 24 pages concern a blackmail attempt and letters threatening to shoot him. Five pages are their response to a 1969 White House request that Mickeys name be checked to see if it turned up in other files. Says the FBI, By no stretch of the imagination was Mickey Mantle ever the subject of an FBI investigation.\n\nMay 8, 1956: Mickey, despite a painful muscle spasm in his left thigh and fouling a ball off his right big toe in batting practice, still manages to knock a homer into Yankee Stadiums lower right-field seats for a 4-3 win. Mickeys dinger came off Indians right-hander Early Wynn, Mickeys favorite pitcher for career home runs. Wynn gave up 13 to The Mick, the most of any pitcher.\n\nMay 8, 1957: Mickey belts a 440-foot three-run home run to deepest center-field in Cleveland's cavernous Municipal Stadium, adding to his total of career home runs hit off Early Wynn, but the Yankees lose 10-4.\n\nMay 8, 1964: Despite tornado warnings and stormy skies, Mickey rips a homer through the winds over the right-field fence at Clevelands cavernous Municipal Stadium as the Yankees crush the Indians 10-3.\n\nMay 9, 1953: Mickey catapults a tremendous home run off the light-tower above the net in left-field and is later robbed of a homer when Jimmy Piersall makes a leaping, back-hand catch above the wall in deep center near the 420-foot sign as the Bombers beat Boston 6-4 at Fenway Park.\n\nMay 9, 1958: Mickey hits the first of three inside-the-park home runs in less than a month, a 450-ft drive into the monuments in center-field at Yankee Stadium. The Mick turns on the after-burners and flies around the bases for an inside-the-park home run. He goes 3-for-5, scoring 2 runs and driving home an rbi, and steals third as part of a double steal as the Bombers beat the Senators 9-5 in NY. This one is against the Senators at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 9, 1964: Mickey hits his 12th and final career homer off left-handed pitcher Pedro Ramos (his second favorite pitcher for hitting home runs) as the Bronx Bombers beat the Indians 6-2 at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.\n\nMay 9, 1966: Slowed by major shoulder surgery in the off-season, Mickey finally hits his first homer of the year in the 23rd game of the season. Its the latest hes homered in any year of his career, but it comes at a good time as it enables the Bombers nip the Minnesota Twins 3-2 at Metropolitan Stadium in Minneapolis.\n\nMay 10, 1959: In a doubleheader sweep over the Senators at Yankee Stadium, in the first game Mickey smacks a 410-foot homer into the left-field bullpen and scores two runs. In the second game he singles and scores the winning run in the bottom of the tenth.\n\nMay 10, 1965: Mickey goes 3-for-4 with a run, 2 rbi, a long homer to right and a double. The Micks double comes with two out in the ninth, a long, hard hit ball that caroms high off the left-center-field wall, missing being a homer by two feet. Mickey's pinch runner is stranded at second and the Yankees lose 3-2 at Fenway Park. It is pitcher Jim Lonborgs first big league win.\n\nMay 11, 1963: Mickey goes 2-for-4 with a walk, 3 runs, 3 rbi and a homer off Milt Pappas in a 13-1 massacre of the Orioles at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore. Roger Maris homers too, the first time M&M homered in the same game this season.\n\nMay 11, 1965: After Mickey hurt his hands hitting a hard sinker off the end of his bat, pitcher Arnie Earley sees Mickey set-up in the back of the batters box. On a 3-2 pitch Earley fires another hard sinker well outside. Rather than walk, Mickey reaches out and smashes it 430-feet into the seats beyond the Red Sox bullpen in right-center-field and the Yankees win 5-3 at Fenway.\n\nMay 12, 1957: Mickey belts a game-winning homer deep into the right-field seats with two out in the eighth inning to lead the Yankees to a 4-3 win over the Orioles at Municipal Stadium in Baltimore.\n\nMay 12, 1959: Mickey hits a tremendous drive all the way to the 457-foot sign in left-center-field at Yankee Stadium then races around the bases for an inside-the-park homer, but the Bombers lose 7-6 to the Indians in NY.\n\nMay 12, 1962: Mickey crushes a 450-foot ninth inning blast into the bullpen in right-field to help seal a 9-6 victory over the Tribe at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.\n\nMay 13, 1951: Mickeys first right-handed major league home run is overshadowed by the Philadelphia Athletics sweep of a doubleheader from the Yankees at Shibe Park. With a runner on third Mickey popped out trying to bunt to end the first game. In the second game he made a rookie running mistake and missed touching second base. Game two was called after 8 innings due to a curfew.\n\nMay 13, 1955: Mickey has the only three-homer game in his career and first switch-hit homer game  one righty and two lefty  goes 4-for-4 and drives in all five runs to beat the Detroit Tigers in New York. All three homers are hit to the right-centerfield bleachers. Each is well over 400 feet.\n\nMay 13, 1960: Mickey, batting second for one of the few times in his career, bashes a tremendous opposite-field homer over the 31-foot high wall in right-field, completely out of Griffith Stadium  a rare feat for a right-handed hitter - and the Yankees beat the Senators 7-3 in Washington.\n\nMay 14, 1966: Mickey mauls a monster mash of a homer - over 500 feet - that clears the outfield fence in deepest right-center-field and continues rocketing to the base of a second, outer fence - something never before accomplished - but the Athletics go on to win 4-2 in Kansas City.\n\nMay 14, 1967: On a two out full count Mickey smokes Orioles pitcher Stu Millers pitchers pitch (low & away) deep into the lower seats in right for career homer #500. It's the difference in the Bombers' 7-6 win at Yankee Stadium. Only the 6th player ever to hit 500 career homers, Yankees 3rd base coach Frank Crosetti breaks tradition by shaking The Micks hand as he rounds 3rd.\n\nMay 15, 1957:While celebrating Billy Martins birthday, Mickey, Billy, Yogi Berra and Hank Bauer are involved in a brawl at the Copacabana nightclub. When the players ask a drunk bowling team to stop yelling racial slurs at Sammy Davis during his performance, they challenge the Yankees to a fight in the cloak room. The highly publicized incident gives GM George Weiss an excuse to trade Billy to Kansas City. One of the bowlers sues Hank Bauer for $1,000,000. The judge throws out the case.\n\nMay 16, 1951: Mickey hits his first major league home run at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 20, 1958: Mickey hits the second of three inside-the-park home runs in less than a month. This one is against the White Sox at Comiskey Park.\n\nMAY 21\n\nMay 21, 1963: Mickey goes 2-for-4, scoring 2 runs with 5 rbi. Both of his hits are home runs to right (one goes into the lower seats, the other soars into the bullpen) to help the Yanks beat the Kansas City A's 7-4 at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nMAY 22\n\nMay 22, 1962: Mickey hits what he calls \"the hardest ball I ever hit\" at Yankee Stadium off Bill Fischer of the Kansas City A's. The ball hits the façade inches from the top and bounces back to the infield. It wins the game in the bottom of the tenth inning. (The diagram in photo on right shows the location where Mickey's home run off Bill Fischer hit the façade at Yankee Stadium.)\n\nMAY 23\n\nMay 23, 1959:Mickey breaks a personal slump and a team slump with a great game by going 3-for-3 with 2 walks, 3 runs scored, an rbi double in the first followed by a steal of third - when the catcher's throw gets away Mickey races home to score, plus a hefty home run in the fifth belted deep over the barrier in right to give the Yankees a 13-5 win at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore.\n\nMAY 24\n\nMay 24, 1956: Mickey has a great day, going 5-for-5 with a long home run into the stands in right in the second inning, plus a walk, 3 runs, and 3 rbi as the Yankees pound Detroit 11-4 at Tiger Stadium. Mickey's performance raises his average to .421, with 17 homers and 39 rbi - the best in the majors, and speculation about Mickey winning the Triple Crown begins!\n\nMAY 25\n\nMay 25, 1954: Mickey goes 3-for-4 with a walk, 2 runs, 1 rbi, uses his blazing speed to beat-out two infield singles, and then in the eighth inning catapults a homer well over Griffith Stadiums 31-foot high wall in right-field to help the Yankees beat the Senators 9-3 in Washington.\n\nMay 25, 1957: Mickey goes 2-for-4 with a run and 2 rbi, then in the fifth inning picks on home run favorite Pedro Ramos again by hitting another homer off him, a sharp drive into the lower seats in right-field, as the Yankees beat the Senators 8-1 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 25, 1966: Mickey has his first two-homer game since Aug. 12, 1964. He goes 3-for-3 with 2 walks, 3 runs, 5 rbi and 2 homers. He hits one homer into the back of the bullpen in right-field, and the other homer he slices to the opposite-field stands in left, helping the Yankees knock the halos off the Angels 11-6 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMAY 26\n\nMay 26, 1957: Mickeys towering eye-opening homer disappears through a runway opening in the top tier in right, bringing the Yankees back to even from a 6-0 deficit, but the Senators manage to eke out a 9-6 win anyway in the first game of a twin-bill split with Washington at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 26, 1963:This game against the Senators is a tense pitchers duel until the 6th inning when Mickey kites an opposite-field homer that sails into the lower deck in right-field, giving the Yankees a 2-1 lead. That opens the floodgates and the Bombers go on to win 7-1 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMAY 27\n\nMay 27, 1959: Mickey wins this game with his speed rather than his bat. He stretches a line single into a double, steals a base and gets 3 walks. After Mickey walks in the 8th Bosox hurler Murray Wall, mindful of his speed, tries a half-dozen pick-off attempts. When he finally pitches to Moose Skowron its a gopher ball. Moose parks it in the right-field seats for a 3-2 win in NY.\n\nMAY 28\n\nMay 28, 1960: Mickey breaks a scoreless tie (and an 0-for-20 slump) in the 6th inning with a lead-off opposite-field homer that travels over 400 feet into the bleachers in right to lead the Yankees to a 5-1 win over the Senators at Yankee Stadium. New right-fielder Roger Maris  traded for in the off-season - also homers, the first time the M&M Boys both homer in the same game.\n\nMAY 29\n\nMay 29, 1960: Mickey, batting right-handed, lifts an opposite-field drive into the bleachers in right-field for a home run to start a three-run rally in the sixth inning, leading the Yankees to a 6-4 win over the Senators at Yankee Stadium. Its his third righty homer of the year, and all have been hit to the opposite field.\n\nMAY 30\n\nMay 30, 1956: In a Memorial Day doubleheader at Yankee Stadium Mickey launches his first façade shot off Pedro Ramos in game 1. It misses going out by 18 inches and reporters estimate it wouldve gone at least 600 feet! In game 2 he clouts a 450-footer off Camilo Pascual that goes half-way up the bleachers in right to lead the Yankees to a twinbill sweep over the Senators. (The façade home run hit the façade a little to the right of the home run shown in the \"hardest ball\" photo diagram just above this entry.)\n\nMay 30, 1961: The Yankees turn on the power and hit 7 homers. Mickey & Roger Maris hit two each - two back-to-back and each of the four over 400 feet - as NY clobbers the Bosox 12-3 at Fenway Park.\n\nMay 30, 1965: Mickey, playing left-field, goes 2-for-4 and homers in the fourth for the first run as the Yankees beat the Chisox 3-1 at Comiskey Park.\n\nMay 30, 1968: In his finest game as a first-baseman, Mickey has his fourth and last 5-hit game and third 5-for-5 game, with 2 homers, a double, 2 singles, 3 runs and 5 rbi to beat the Senators 13-4 in game 1 of a twinbill sweep in NY.\n\nMAY 31\n\nMay 31, 1954: Though his 11-game hitting streak ends in game 1, Mickey goes 3-for-3 with a run, 2 rbi & a triple in the nightcap to give the Yanks a twinbill split with the Senators in NY. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie is in attendance.\n\nMay 31, 1960: The NY Times reports Mickeys face and jaw are bruised by fans running on the field, clawing and grabbing him after the Memorial Day twinbill. Stadium security is beefed up due to the incident. Mickey later says I learned to throw the ball one way, my cap the other way, and then to run like hell for the clubhouse.\n\nMay 31, 1956: Arthur Daley devotes his NY Times column primarily to tape measure homers at Yankee Stadium due to Mickeys tremendous homer off the façade on May 30.\n\nMay 31, 1961: Mickey hits the key blow, a 400+-foot home run to center-field with Roger Maris on base (Maris also homered earlier) to give the Yankees a 7-6 win over Boston at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMay 31, 1964: Sitting out due to a leg injury that prevents him from running, Mickey is called on to pinch-hit. Batting right-handed, he hits a shot that scores two-runs. It would normally have been a double but The Mick has to jog to first and stop there because of his injury. Thus far in the season his average batting right-handed is .559, with 18 rbi in 34 at-bats!\n\nMay 31, 1965: Mickey singles, steals second base, races to third on a ground ball, then scores on a passed ball. His daring base running makes the difference, giving the Yankees a doubleheader split with Detroit at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJUNE:\n\nJUNE 1\n\nJune 1, 1960: Mickey whacks a 400+-foot homer to center his first at-bat for the Yankees only hit. He also makes a great catch, turning his back to the ball and racing to the fence in center for a spectacular backhanded grab, but its not enough as the Bombers lose 4-1 to the Birds in Baltimore.\n\nJune 1, 1966: Mickeys homer into the center-field bullpen in the ninth spoils White Sox pitcher Juan Pizarros shutout, but the Bombers lose to the Pale Hose 6-2 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\nJUNE 2\n\nJune 2, 1957: Mickeys two-run first inning homer off Orioles righty Hal Brown flies high into the top deck in right, followed by solo shots from Berra and Howard - all the Yankees need to ground the Birds 4-0 at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJune 2, 1958: Mickeys solo clout in the first is enough for Whitey Ford, who ties the AL record with six consecutive strikeouts, but Hank Bauer hammers two homers also as the Pale Hose wash out at Yankee Stadium 3-0.\n\nJUNE 3\n\nJune 3, 1955: Mickey crushes a solo homer that caroms off Comiskey Parks upper deck in left-center to tie the game 2-2 in the sixth, but Chicago holds off the Yankees and ekes out a 3-2 win.\n\nJune 3, 1958: Mickey lines a 3-run shot into the seats in right in the first to get the Yankees rolling (Mickey works Chisox pitchers for 3 walks and scores 3 runs, too) as the Pale Hose get hosed 13-0 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 3, 1959: With the game tied 5-5 in the ninth inning, Mickey swings at a pitch but doesnt get it all. But even a little can be a lot when its The Mick. He lofts a fly ball to right-center that looks like a fly out. To everyones surprise  except Mickeys  it keeps going and going, eventually carrying over the fence for a game-winning homer and a 6-5 Yankees win in Detroit.\n\nJUNE 4\n\nJune 4, 1953: Mickey belts 420-foot homer into the Yankees bullpen in the third inning, then singles to ignite a four-run rally in the tenth inning that leads to a 9-5 win at Comiskey Park in the Windy City.\n\nJune 4, 1958: Mickeys 478-foot blast to row 19 of the bleachers in left-center is only the eighth ball ever hit there. The Mick has now homered to all of the seating areas at Yankee Stadium, but the Chisox take this one 7-2.\n\nJune 4, 1963: With Orioles ace Steve Barber in command in the second, Mickey lunges at a full-count pitch. Though fooled on the pitch, The Micks off-balance poke demonstrates his incredible strength. The resulting lazy fly ball to the opposite-field just keeps on carrying, sailing 360 feet to the bleachers in left. Its the Yankees only run in a 3-1 loss at Memorial Stadium in Charm City.\n\nJUNE 5\n\nJune 5, 1953: Mickey extends his hitting streak to 10 games by racking up a single and belting a homer into the seats in right-center as the Bombers beat the Browns 5-0 at Busch Stadium in Mound City.\n\nJune 5, 1955: Mickey launches a tape measure rocket that leaves the field between the 352-foot and 367-foot signs, flying over the Comiskey Park roof and sailing into a parking lot over 550 feet away as the Yankees split a twinbill with the Pale Hose in Chicago. (A diagram of Mickey's homer on 6/5/55 homer out of Comiskey Park in Chicago is in the photo on the right.)\n\nJune 5, 1956: As manager Lou Boudreau uses the Mantle Shift when Mickey is batting lefty with no one on base. Complicated, it moves fielders to the right to give KC five outfielders. Mickey tries bunting twice but strikes out. In the eighth with no shift Mickey belts a 2-run homer but the Yankees lose 7-3. Says GM George Weiss of the shift, It got him thinking, and thats bad.\n\nJune 5, 1957: Mickey goes 3-for-5, scores two runs and slams a long 450-foot homer to right as the Yankees scalp the Indians 13-3 at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.\n\nJune 5, 1958: Mickey hits his third inside-the-park home run in less than a month  half his career total - when he wallops a shot to the 461-foot sign in center and blazes around the bases as the Yankees split a twinbill with Chicagos Pale Hose at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJune 5, 1960: Mickey goes 2-for-3 with a single and a home run in the first game to help the Bombers win 5-4 and sweep a doubleheader from the Bosox at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJune 5, 1961: Mickeys 420-foot 2-run homer to the bleachers in right helps the Bombers sweep a twinbill from the Twins at Yankee Stadium in NY. Its his 15th homer of the season and career home run #335. His homers are almost perfectly divided: The Micks hit 168 homers on the road and 167 at home.\n\nJune 5, 1963: It's a black day for The Mick. Chasing a fly ball in Baltimore he crashes into the center-field railing, breaks a bone in his left foot and tears a cartilage in his knee. He's carried off the field on a stretcher. As a result he plays in only 65 games this season.\n\nJune 5, 1965: Mickey homers in the sixth, then makes a fine running catch to rob a bid for extra-bases to help Mel Stottlemyre, who pitches the full ten innings and hits his first major league home run. Elston Howard, newly back from elbow surgery, rips a single to left to drive in the winning run in the tenth as the Bombers nip the Pale Hose 4-3 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 5, 1967: Mickey goes after a waste pitch from Senators reliever Darold Knowles  a sinker thrown ankle-high and about a foot outside - and golfs a drive that slices towards the opposite-field, continuing to carry until it sails into the lower right-field seats for a home run, as the Yankees beat the Senators 4-2 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJUNE 6\n\nJune 6, 1954: Mickey goes 2-for-4 with 2 runs, 2 rbi and a homer into the right-field stands as the Bombers beat the first-year Orioles (the former St. Louis Browns) 5-2 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 6, 1955: Mickey hits a 450-foot homer that clears the 440 foot sign and lands in the stands in dead center at Tiger Stadium - the first homer ever hit there! It leads the Bombers to a 7-5 win over the Tigers in Detroit.\n\nJune 6, 1957: Mickey goes 2-for-3 with 3 walks, 3 runs, 4 rbi and a 450-foot homer that clears the fence and one-hops off a cinder track into the never-before-reached seats in center-field for a 14-5 win over the Tribe in Cleveland.\n\nJune 6, 1958: Mickey goes 3-for-3 with a walk, 3 runs, 4 rbi and 2 homers  one caroms off the railing of the upper deck in left  as the Bombers nip the Cleveland Indians 6-5 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJUNE 7\n\nJune 7, 1957: Mickey silences a large crowd in Detroit when he launches a prodigious blast in the first inning that ricochets off the facing of the right-field roof to give the Yankees a temporary 1-0 lead at Tiger Stadium, but the Tigers eventually prevail over the Bombers 6-3.\n\nJune 8, 1969: \"Mickey Mantle Day\" - the third day honoring Mickey - is held at Yankee Stadium. 70,000 people attend. (Mickey is overcome with emotion on \"Mickey Mantle Day\" in photo on the right.)\n\nJUNE 8\n\nJune 8, 1958: Mickey blasts his seventh homer in seven days but today it's not enough and the Bombers still lose a doubleheader to the Cleveland Indians at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 8, 1960: Mickey is red hot with his fourth consecutive 2-hit game (minus a 3 walks in 3 at-bats game). Hes 2-for-4 with 2 runs, 3 rbi and 2 homers into the seats in right - #9 & #10 on the year, one his first back-to-back homer with Roger Maris - in a 6-0 win vs. Chicago. Maris benefits from Mickey batting behind him. He already has 16 homers, his total for last year.\n\nJune 8, 1969: Approximately 70,000 people turn out for Mickey Mantle Day at Yankee Stadium to honor Mickey and his 18-year career with the Yankees. NY Mayor John Lindsay passes a resolution proclaiming June 8, 1969 as Mickey Mantle Day in New York. Its the third day held at Yankee Stadium to honor Mickey, the most of any player! (A fourth MM Day will be held after his death.)\n\nJUNE 9\n\nJune 9, 1959: Mickey goes 2-for-5 with 2 walks, 2 runs, 2 rbi, 2 stolen bases and a home run hit deep to right-field to lead the Yankees to a 9-8 win in 13 innings over the Kansas City As at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 9, 1960: Mickey pounds a right-handed home run into the opposite-field bullpen in right as the Chicago Pale Hose fade to the Yankees 5-2 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 9, 1961: Mickey gets on base four times in two official at-bats, going 2-for-2 with 2 walks, 2 runs and 4 rbi. He walks in the second, moves to second on an out and scores on a single, lifts a 3-run homer to left in the third (#16), and singles home Kubek from second in the fifth in a game delayed by rain four times. Maris also homers (#18) as the Yankees beat KC 8-6 in NY.\n\nJUNE 10\n\nJune 10, 1954: Mickey goes 2-for-5 with 2 runs and 2 rbi, and slams a back-to-back homer with Dr. Bobby Brown deep into the seats in right to beat the Tigers 9-5 at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJune 10, 1957: Mickey goes 2-for-3 with a walk, a run and 1 rbi with a homer to right in the sixth but the Tigers still beat the Yankees 9-4 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit.\n\nJune 10, 1960: Mickeys powerful homer in the eighth breaks a 3-3 tie to beat the Cleveland Indians 4-3 in NY. His fourth homer in six games and sixth in June, he also makes a great running catch in deep center-field in Yankee Stadium to rob the Tribe of a triple.\n\nJune 10, 1961: Mickey hammers a triple and belts season homer #17 to lead the Yankees to a 5-3 win over the Kansas City A's at Yankee Stadium. The Mick goes 2-for-3 with a walk, three runs and one rbi. Whitey Ford pitches and gets the complete game win to go 9-2 on the season. It's the Yankees' seventh win in eight games of their 11-games-in-8-days home stand.\n\nJUNE 11\n\nJune 11, 1953: Mickey rockets a shot off the roof of the top deck in right-center-field at Briggs Stadium  only Ted Williams had ever cleared the roof, but the Detroit Free Press says Mickey's wouldve gone further but for the roof. It gives The Mick a 16-game hitting streak and the Yankees their 14th win in a row as they beat the Tigers 6-3 in Detroit.\n\nJune 11, 1957: Mickey crushes a homer high into the top deck in right at Comiskey Park, then doubles and scores the winning run in a 3-2 win over the Pale Hose in Chicago.\n\nJune 11, 1959: Mickeys solo homer plus home runs hit by Marv Throneberry and Norm Siebern arent enough as the Kansas City As beat the Yankees 9-5 at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJune 11, 1961: In game one of a twinbill vs. the Los Angeles Angels in NY, Mickey robs the Angels of extra bases with an incredible, backhand grab in left-center & Maris robs them of two more homers with great catches. In game two Mickey belts a long three-run homer & Maris hits two to give the Bombers the sweep.\n\nJune 11, 1964: After two weeks off due to injury, Mickey comes back into the line-up and catapults two long home runs deep to right  one onto the runway and the other into the seats  to lead the Yankees to an 8-4 win over the Bosox at Fenway Park.\n\nJune 11, 1968: Mickey hammers a two-run homer and Tom Tresh hits a three-run dinger but it's not enough as the Pale Hose from the Windy City win 9-5 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJUNE 12\n\nJune 12, 1957: In a game with several rain delays on a stormy Chicago night, Mickey goes 4-for-5, scoring two runs and driving in four. He switch-hits two homers - one a two-run shot into the bullpen in center in the ninth, but its not enough. The Yanks lose to the Pale Hose 7-6 at Comiskey. Says pitcher Jack Harshman about Mickey, They ought to create a new league for that guy.\n\nJUNE 13\n\nJune 13, 1958: Mickey smashes a towering, cloud-duster of a home run that carries deep into the seats in left to tie the game against the Tigers 1-1 in NY, but the Bengals go on to win 4-2 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 13, 1959: Mickeys first inning solo home run clubbed into the front rows of seats in right-field starts things off for the Yankees, who go on to beat the Detroit Tigers 6-4 at Yankee Stadium. Its win #1,000 for the Yankees under their legendary manager, Casey Stengel.\n\nJune 13, 1964: In a crucial series against the first place White Sox at Yankee Stadium, Mickey comes up big, going 3-for-3 with a walk, a run, and 2 rbi. He singles in a run in the first, then rips a solo homer to right in the fourth for season #11, career #430 (215 on the road and 215 at home!). The Yankees go on to beat the Chisox 6-3, their third win over Chicago in 24 hours!\n\nJUNE 14\n\nJune 14, 1956: Mickey goes 2-for-3 with a walk, 2 runs scored and 2 rbi. He doubles home a run in the third, then in the seventh he breaks a short home run drought by blasting his first homer in eight games. He drills it 20 rows deep into the bleachers in right for season homer #22, leading the Yankees to a 5-1 win over the Chisox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 14, 1957: Mickey does his part (1-for-3, 3 walks, 2 runs, 2 rbi, solo homer) in the Yanks 10-1 rout of the As at Municipal Stadium. Mickeys pal Tom Sturdivant pitches a complete game to go 5-3 on the year. Talk of his pitchers throwing bean balls leads Casey Stengel to say, Now that Mantle wears a protective helmet, pitchers walk him by throwing at his legs and feet.\n\nJUNE 15\n\nJune 15, 1952: Mickey hits his first left-handed homer of the year, a three-run shot, to lift the Bronx Bombers to a twinbill sweep of the Tribe before 69,468 fans in Cleveland.\n\nJune 15, 1956: In the first inning Mickey slices a 2-run opposite-field homer over the fence in left, putting him five games ahead of Babe Ruths 1927 record 60-homer pace as the Yankees beat the Indians 6-2 in Cleveland.\n\nJune 15, 1957: Mickeys best friend, Billy Martin, is traded by Yankees' General Manager George Weiss to the Kansas City Athletics in the wake of the Copacabana nightclub incident on May 15. Weiss thinks Martin is a bad influence on The Mick and was looking for a reason to trade him. Mickey is devastated by the loss of his best pal. (Mickey and Billy are in the photo on the right.)\n\nJune 15, 1961: Mickey slams a homer in the seventh inning to tie the game at one all, then the Yankees go on to win 3-2 in the eleventh inning on John Blanchards pinch-hit rbi single at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.\n\nJune 15, 1967: After missing five games due to a pulled thigh muscle, Mickey returns to the lineup and rockets a 450-foot drive high into the upper deck in left-center-field at DC Stadium in Washington to lead the Bombers to a 2-0 win over the Senators.\n\nJUNE 16\n\nJune 16, 1956: Trailing 1-0 in the third, Mickey wallops a long 2-run homer well over the left-field fence to give NY the lead and help beat the Indians 3-1 in Cleveland.\n\nJune 16, 1962: A big moment for Mickey. Benched by a severe muscle tear, he's asked to pinch-hit in the eighth with two men on. Hes determined to hit a homer since he can't run due to his injury. He misses a fastball for a strike, then smashes a dramatic three-run homer to give NY a 9-7 lead in Cleveland. The fans cheer him like one of their own as he limps around the bases.\n\nJune 16, 1968: Angels pitcher Clyde Wright struck out Mickey on a curve-ball last season, so he thought hed try it again.

The Chicago papers report that it wouldve gone 480 feet if unobstructed.\n\nJune 17, 1960: The Yankees mock the new $300,000 exploding scoreboard at Comiskey Park (it sets off fireworks after a Chisox homer) by waving sparklers after homers by Clete Boyer in the second and Mickey in the eighth. Mickey and Casey Stengel lead the dugout celebration and Yogi Berra leads the bullpen. The first game of a key 4-game series, the Yanks win 4-2 and sweep the series.\n\nJune 17, 1961: With two on and two out In the ninth, Mickey launches a spectacular homer into the third deck in right-field at Tiger Stadium. Elston Howard follows with a solo homer but its not enough and the Yanks lose to the Tigers 12-10 in Detroit.\n\nJune 17, 1964: Mickey called Bosox reliever Dick Radatz, the toughest pitcher I ever faced. In the bottom of the eighth Mickey finally gets a Radatz pitch he can hit. He jumps on it and skies it to right. At first he thinks hes flied out. But the ball has plenty of carry, finally landing in the bleachers in right. Crossing the plate Mickey says to Radatz, I finally got you!\n\nJUNE 18\n\nJune 18, 1953: Mickey rips a two-run home run into the seats in left in the first game of a twinbill sweep vs. the St. Louis Browns at Yankee Stadium.

Mickey reaches for an away pitch, hits a high fly and thinks, mission accomplished. But Mickey is so strong that even his sacrifice flies have plenty of carry. It keeps going and going, finally touching down in the seats in left for a grand slam! It leads the Yanks over the Twins 10-2 in NY.\n\nJUNE 19\n\nJune 19, 1951: On Mickeys first two-homer day he belts one in each game of a twinbill split with the Chisox at Yankee Stadium.

(.380 vs. .370).\n\nJUNE 21\n\nJune 21, 1953: Mickey hits for a twinbill cycle: in Game One he belts a single, triple and 425-foot opposite-way right-handed homer hit deep into the Bombers bullpen in right, and a double in Game Two for a split with the Detroit Tigers at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJune 21, 1955: Mickey makes history in a 6-2 win vs. the Kansas City Athletics at Yankee Stadium, crushing an explosive 486-foot drive that clears the 30-foot hitters screen in center-field and lands in bleachers row 9.

The win makes Whitey Ford 13-2 on the year.\n\nJUNE 27\n\nJune 27, 1952: Mickey's raps his seventh homer of the season and third lefty homer, this one with Yogi Berra on and one out in the fourth, giving the Yankees all they really need, but he goes on to walk and score a run in the fifth too, as Joe Collins shuts out the Philadelphia Athletics 10-0 at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.\n\nJune 27, 1964: Mickey, batting against Denny McLain, lofts a solo home run that sails high and deep into the seats in right-field to help power the Yankees to a 5-4 win over Detroit's Bengal Cats at Yankee Stadium in NY.\n\nJUNE 28\n\nJune 28, 1960: Mickey homers into the left-field stands in the third inning to tie the score 2-2, as the Bronx Bombers go on to a 5-2 win over the Kansas City Athletics at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJune 28, 1961: Mickey belts a towering blast over a light tower in left-center-field off Angels pitcher Ryne Duren in a 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles.

(In the photo on the right the red arrow on the left shows the approximate path of Joe Collins' home run at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The red arrow on the right shows the approximate path of Mickey's home run.)\n\nAUGUST 6\n\nAugust 6, 1954: Mickey slams his first pinch-hit home run, over 500 feet out of Shibe Park in Philadelphia.\n\nAUGUST 7\n\nAugust 7, 1953: Mickey hits his first inside-the-park home run as the Yankees beat Chicago 6-1 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nAUGUST 11\n\nAugust 11, 1954: Mickey has his first two-homer game in a 7-0 win over the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nAUGUST 12\n\nAugust 12, 1964: Mickey crushes a sky-high fly ball to centerfield.

The first: Mickey's home run on June 21, 1955.\n\nAugust 12, 1974: Mickey is inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame with friend and teammate Whitey Ford.

(In the photo on the left the red arrow shows the path of Mickey's historic 643-foot home run hit into Brooks Lumber Yard across the street from Tiger Stadium in Detroit.)\n\nSEPTEMBER 17\n\nSeptember 17, 1952: Mickey, batting right-handed, clouts a prodigious opposite-field home run off the upper deck football press box in right-centerfield, just below the roof, to beat the Tigers in Detroit. The ball bounced back onto the field almost to second base. At the time Mickey called it, \"the hardest ball I ever hit.\" That, of course, would change as Mickey racked up more tape-measure blasts later in his career.\n\nSeptember 17, 1958: Mickey batting left-handed against Tigers' pitcher Jim Bunning, belts a mammoth homer down the rightfield line that goes over the roof and out of Briggs Stadium (later renamed Tiger Stadium) in Detroit. The ball crosses adjacent Trumbull Avenue and hits the second story of a building across from the Stadium. It's recovered by taxi driver Bob Gilbert.

Mickey, while batting only .208, has five hits, seven rbi, and wins two games with home runs, one of them a grand slam. It's the only time in history that a team wins five world championships in a row.\n\nOCTOBER 8\n\nOctober 8, 1956: Don Larsen pitches the only perfect game in World Series history as the Yankees beat the Dodgers 2-0 in game five of the 1956 World Series. Mickey hits a solo home run in the fourth inning for the first Yankees' run (the only run they'll need, as it turns out), then makes a spectacular game-saving catch in the fifth inning to rob Gil Hodges of an extra-base hit. Hodges drive would have gone into the upper deck had the game been played at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, but Mickey's tremendous speed enabled him to make the catch at Yankee Stadium. (Mickey's game-saving catch of Gil Hodges' bid for extra bases in Don Larsen's Perfect Game is shown in the three-panel sequence on the above right.)\n\nOCTOBER 10\n\nOctober 10, 1951: Mickey wins his first World Series championship as the Yankees beat the Giants in six games.

It's The Mick's \"called shot\" - he predicted the homer to Elston Howard in the on-deck circle while Schultz warmed up. Mickey's walk-off home run wins the game for the Yankees in the bottom of the ninth inning. (Mickey's swing for his walk-off home run in Game 3 of the 1964 World Series - his record-breaking World Series home run #16 - hit off knuckleball pitcher Barney Schultz, is shown in the photo on the right.)\n\nOCTOBER 12\n\nOctober 12, 1955: Mickey and the Yankees open their tour of Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines with a 12-1 win over the Hawaii Red Sox.\n\nOctober 12, 1960: Mickey and the Yankees win Game 6 of the 1960 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-0.

The Yankees tied the game in the top of the ninth due to Mickey's remarkably intuitive base-running. With the score 9-8 and one out, Mickey on first and Gil McDougald on third, Yogi Berra grounded to Pirates' first-baseman Rocky Bridges in what appeared to be a game-ending double-play ball. Bridges stepped on first to force Berra but Mantle, instead of running to second, distracted Bridges from throwing home to get McDougald, then dove around him - avoiding the tag - sliding safely back into first. It allowed the tying run to score and took the game to the bottom of the ninth. It's the sort of play that perhaps 1 in 1000 players might make. The Yankees outscored Pittsburgh 55-27 in the Series. Mickey was so upset by losing the Series that he cried on the plane trip home. He called it, \"The greatest disappointment of my career.\"\n\nOCTOBER 14\n\nOctober 14, 1964: Mickey adds to his World Series home run record by smashing Series home run #17 as the Yankees beat the Cardinals 8-3 in Game 6 of the 1964 World Series in St. Louis, tying the Series at 3 games each.

(In the photo on the right Yankees' second baseman Bobby Richardson spears Willie McCovey's line drive with two on and two out in the bottom of the ninth inning in Game 7 of the 1962 World Series. It ended the game and the Yankees held on to win 1-0.
