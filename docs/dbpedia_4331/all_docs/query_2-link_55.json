        "text": "The Original Hall of Fame\n\nMany of my readers know of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, or the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, or the Rock and Roll Hall of fame in Cleveland. But how many know of the original Hall of Fame situated on the old New York University campus in the Bronx? I know because I grew up on Loring Place two blocks north of the now Bronx Community College.\n\nSo, I went back to visit the old campus where I ran around the track to get in shape for football. I indulged my OCD tendency and took a photo of each and everyone one of the nearly100 bust displayed in the hall. I will not torture you with all of them. I am not including the very well know celebrates like Lincoln, Grant, Alexander Graham Bell, Edison, Sherman, or Hamilton.\n\nInstead, I will be focusing on the lesser known Hall of Famers, including the women that are usually forgotten about.\n\nSo, here is my First Flight of six “Famers.”\n\nLouis Agassiz\n\nAlso, he founded the study of glaciology – as an ice age theorist, he examined the last ice age on north America focusing on the structure and movement of ice.\n\nSomething that tarnished his reputation was his belief in creationism. He believed that “nature had order because God created it directly.” Also, he never accepted the theory of natural selection.\n\nOne aspect that I respect him for was that he supposedly was a tough teacher. He would lock up a student in a closet with lobster shells or oyster shells or some other type of shell and wouldn’t let them out until the pupil could discern the truth which the objects contained. Try to get away with that today!\n\nMissing his statue – Sorry, I somehow missed this one. Please forgive me. You will just have to image what his bust looks like from this Photo.\n\nOne observation of him by scientists of his day, that causes me to like him more that I thought I would, is their disdain for his research protocols. These ivory tower types tsk-tsked him for being more concerned with results than research. They looked down their noses at him for wanting to spend more time in his garden experimenting than in his office writing down each trial and error. He produced products for the market, they produced monograms for a conference. I’m going to enjoy my next bite of a Mickey D’s French fry even more now.\n\nNext Bust on the wall - George Washington Carver\n\n1860’s to 1943\n\nThe Peanut man was born into slavery. After the civil war he struggled to get a high school degree from Minneapolis High School in Minneapolis. Then he was encouraged to go to college to study plan management and biology. He was the first black student at Iowa State University where he received a bachelor’s degree as well as a master’s degree. He later became a professor at Tuskegee Institute where he served for 47 years.\n\nHis major contribution was to educate cotton farmers about how to improve their soil that had been depleted of nitrogen by repeated plantings of cotton. His solution was to recommend crop rotation with sweet potatoes or legumes especially peanuts and soybeans. On unintended consequence of this plant rotation was a surplus of peanuts\n\nGW Carver set out to promote peanuts and identified 300 products made from the peanut. His expertise was so recognized that the peanut industry had him be their spokesperson in front of Congress’s Ways and Means Committee to support a tariff on peanuts. The southern representatives at first mocked him; but when he finished his testimony, he received a standing ovation.\n\nGW Carver has been honored with a stamp, a 1943 liberty Ship named for him, as well as a state park, a bridge, a botanical garden and several schools.\n\nA woman living in Mary Lyon's time could:\n\n· Vote\n\n· Go to medical, law, or graduate school.\n\n· Wear pants.\n\n· Be a minister.\n\n· Run for political office.\n\n· Serve in the military.\n\n· Earn wages equal to men's.\n\n· Sue someone in her own name.\n\n· Keep ownership of her property after marriage.\n\n· Continue contracts made before marriage.\n\n· Enroll at Harvard College.\n\n· Keep her birth name without controversy.\n\n· Go about without wearing a bonnet or cap\n\n- NOT\n\nI’ve paraphrased and copied passages about Mary Lyon from sources found on the internet. Here’s my findings:\n\nThere were a lot of restrictions on women in the 1800’s. The one restriction that Mary Lyon rebelled against was the lack of opportunities for women to get an education. The thought at the time was that since women were going to get married and raise a family, education was wasted on them.\n\nThis future founder of Mt Holyoke University struggled to get a rudimary education. In many towns girls could only attend school in the summer, when boys were needed to do farm work. In these towns if girls were allowed to attend at all during the winter, they would have to sit on the school steps, hoping to catch bits of the teacher’s lessons. Mary was fortunate that the school in Buckland allowed girls to attend school year round and, though she left school at the age of thirteen, she had more education than most girls, who knew little more than the basics of reading, writing, and math, if that much at all.\n\nAt seventeen she took a teaching job that paid $3.00 a month compared to a man’s teaching salary of $10 -12 a month. For twenty years she refined her teaching philosophy and classroom strategies and techniques. She also attended schools and studied with experts in different fields. Her expertise as an educator was recognized and people sought her advice on the education of women and classroom management.\n\nHer struggle in obtaining a good education gave Mary a new idea. Mary decided to establish an affordable college for women with an advanced curriculum equal to that available to men; one that prepared women for more than homemaking and teaching. That college was Mt. Holyoke, later honored as one of the Seven Sisters’ colleges.\n\nAn educator ahead of her time, Mary required seven courses in the sciences and mathematics for graduation, a requirement unheard of at other female seminaries. She also introduced science-laboratory experiments to the women, which they performed themselves, often collecting their own specimens for lab work from field trips. She also invited distinguished scientists to lecture at the school and inspired women to pursue careers in the sciences as college teachers and researchers. Mary herself, taught chemistry, one of her favorite subjects.\n\nI, for one, am glad that Mary Lyon has been recognized as a great American with her bust displayed in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThat ends our short trip through the colonnades of the Hall of Fame. We will be back with more unknown famous busts to contemplate."
