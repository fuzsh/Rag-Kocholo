        "text": "MacDONALD\n\nSister Genevieve MacDonald, formerly Sister Ann Ronald, 91, a Sister of St. Martha of Antigonish, died at Mary’s Court, on Saturday August 24th, 2024, in the 66th year of her Religious Life. Born in Little Judique Ponds, Nova Scotia, Sister Genevieve was the daughter of the late Alexander D. and Mary Janet (MacDonald) MacDonald. At the age of six, after her mother’s death, she and her younger brother Ronnie moved to Harbour View, where they were raised by Alex P. and Annie May (MacDonald) MacEachern. Sister Genevieve entered the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Martha on August 15th, 1956. She pronounced her first vows on August 15th, 1958, and her perpetual vows on August 15th, 1961. Sr. Genevieve was a lifelong educator and learner. She entered the congregation as a teacher and continued in that ministry for most of her religious life. She received her BA/BEd from St. Francis Xavier University. In Cape Breton, NS, she taught in Main-a-Dieu; Dominion; South West Margaree; and Eskasoni. She was principal at Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Kamloops, BC; and taught in Basse Terre, St. Kitts, in the West Indies. Sr. Genevieve completed her time in the classroom volunteering in the school in Eskasoni, a community she loved. Sr. Gen’s leadership skills were often called upon within the congregation and she served as local leader in many of the communities in which she lived, including a term as leader of the community at Bethany, the Motherhouse. She served in congregation leadership as an apostolic director for a term and was a member of several committees. Card playing was a favourite activity, not only for the love of the game but the opportunity it provided for laughter, conversation, and some fierce competition. Sr. Genevieve loved to laugh and always had a good story, memory, or anecdote for any occasion. Sister Genevieve is survived by brother Ronnie (Josephine) MacDonald and many devoted nieces and nephews and their families. Besides her parents she was predeceased by brothers, Angus B (Pauline), Neil (Edna), and Frank; and sisters, Isabel, Florence, Margaret, and Janet (Frank)Taylor. The remains rested at Martha Place, Parkland Antigonish, Tuesday, August 27th, at 9:00 a.m.; a Celebration of Vigil and Eulogy was held at 11:00 a.m. in St. Martha Chapel, Parkland Antigonish. A Closing Ritual followed by Liturgy of Christian Burial took place on the same day, Tuesday, August 27th, beginning at 1:45 p.m. in St. Martha Chapel, Parkland Antigonish. The funeral was livestreamed. Visitation was available from 9:00 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. Arrangements were under the direction of CL Curry Funeral Services of Antigonish.\n\nBEATON\n\nTerrence Joseph (Terry) Beaton, the beloved son of Hector and Jacqueline Beaton, passed away in Edmonton, Alberta, on December 29th, 2023.

Beaton of Glencoe and his father, Hector, as well as uncles Alexander, Malcolm, John Duncan, Charlie, and Angus; aunts Marie, Agnes, Margaret, and Anne. He is survived by aunts Kaye Brady and Theresa MacDonell, as well as many cousins, all who loved him dearly. Terry spent many of his formative years at the home of his grandparents in Glencoe.

Terry’s cremation has taken place. On August 24th at 11:00 a.m., a funeral service will be held at St. Joseph Parish in Glencoe with Fr. Danny MacLennan officiating. Prior to the service, from 10:00 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., a visitation will be held in the church.\n\nCOSMAN\n\nOctober 7th, 1943 – August 13th, 2024: Donald Joseph Cosman of Mabou, Nova Scotia passed away peacefully at the Port Hawkesbury Nursing Home on August 13th, 2024. The son of Jessie Isabel (Campbell) and Earle Arthur Cosman, Donald will be fondly remembered for his love of a good time and a laugh, his “stubbornness,” the love of his dogs and as a tireless community volunteer. Donald spent countless hours on numerous projects benefiting Mabou and its surrounding areas such as playing an integral role in the construction and planning of the Mabou and District Community Fire Hall that opened in 1992. There, he spent numerous years as fire chief for the Mabou Volunteer Fire Department. He also spent countless years as a member of the Mabou Ceilidh Committee and Mabou Athletic Centre planning events and fundraising activities to benefit Mabou and the areas it serves. He was employed several years as manager of the Mabou Athletic Centre and coached numerous Minor Hockey teams throughout the years. He also served as a member of the Knights of Columbus lending a helping hand to his community of Mabou. Donald held numerous jobs during his younger years driving trucks in Detroit, mining in Sudbury, Ontario, and working as a carpenter in British Columbia. He eventually returned home to work and be alongside his beloved mother, Jessie and uncle Donald Angus, where they lived together in the big yellow house on Back Street. There were many stories, laughs, and chats to be had around the old kitchen table at “Jessie’s Place.” He worked for the Inverness Regional Housing Authority as a carpenter until health issues forced him into retirement in 1996. Donald will always be remembered for the love of his dogs through the years such as Chum, Shag, Lady, and Kino that were treated as his own children and lived long loving lives! He enjoyed a peaceful walk on the Mabou Trails after his retirement and throughout the years could often be seen with his dogs early mornings getting in his daily walk. He enjoyed a small get together with friends and family, having a good laugh and picking on anyone he knew he could get a reaction from! There are many fond memories of earlier days of good natured fun and his greeting or goodbye with a “Happy Easter” or “Merry Christmas” regardless of what time of year it was! Let us remember those days where the laughs and good times were most abundant. Donald was predeceased by his parents and his brothers, Kenneth (Mary), Earle and Billy (Linda), numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins of whom he loved to spend time with throughout the years. He will be dearly missed by those in which he held a close friendship and bond. A special thank you to all who visited and spent time with Donald throughout his time at Port Hawkesbury Nursing Home as well as the staff of both the Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital and Port Hawkesbury Nursing Home during his time spent at both places.

Those are your friends.” – Unknown\n\nMacDOUGALL\n\nPeacefully in the morning on Saturday, August 17th, 2024, Hugh Alexander “Suey” MacDougall, age 81, passed away at home with his family by his side. He was the son of the late John Dan and Mary Sarah (MacDonald) MacDougall. Loving and dedicated husband to Catherine “Cassie” (Gillis) and proud Dad to Brady, Sarah, and John (Danielle). Cherished Papa of Alexa, Katherine, and Brayden MacDougall. He was born in Inverness on May 13th, 1943. He was a proud member of Stella Maris Parish, Inverness. Suey lived close to 72 of his 81 years in Inverness between Central Avenue and Quincy Street (Spidertown). Love and passion ran deep through Suey’s veins. Whether it was baseball and Roberto Clemente, politics, Bruce Springsteen, Celtic music, or horses. Suey could talk about anything for days with just about anyone who would listen. At the end of the day, the topics were secondary, Suey just loved to talk to people. A natural born storyteller, he loved people. When you came to visit, you can bet your bottom dollar he was going to feed you too. A certified electrician by trade is what took up much of his work life. He was, however, a self-proclaimed handicapper, songwriter, poet as well as expert tax man and botanist in his spare time. His love and passions ran deepest for his family. It could be the MacDougall or Gillis side, but family was his life. He became a husband to Cassie, a woman who restored faith and purpose. He became a dad to three great children who elevated his love and passion for life. He then became Papa. His grandchildren were the final piece of his puzzle. His life was complete. It was perfect for him, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Leaving to mourn with loving memories are his wife, Cassie (Gillis); sons, Brady, John (Danielle); daughter, Sarah; grandchildren Alexa, Katherine, Brayden; brothers, Harold (Dolores); sisters, Killy (Malcolm), Thelma (the late Don McNeil); brothers-in-law Sandy (Anne) Beaton, Stewart (Mary), Earl, John, Steven (Mary), Archie (Ruth), Hugh; sisters-in-law, Josie, Mary (Steve), Minnie, Rhoda (Stan), Susan, Hughena, Theresa, Peggy, Annabelle, Kay; along with many nieces and nephews whom he loved dearly. Suey was predeceased by his brothers, Willie Dan (Jesse), John Archie, Francis “Chalk”(Tina), and John James MacDougall; sisters, Mary Florence “Trixie” (Archie Sofan), Lizzie Beaton, Margaret Marie MacDougall, and Margie MacDougall; nephew Alexander “Skooks”; grand-nephews Breton and Liam; brothers- and sisters-in-law, Sam, DD, Olive, Anne MacDonald, Angus; and nephews Ben and Terry; as well as a wide circle of friends and community members. Visitation will be held in Stella Maris Church, Inverness, on Friday, August 23rd, 2024, from 10:00 a.m. - 10:45 a.m. with funeral mass to follow at 11:00 a.m. Memorial donations may be made to Central Inverness Palliative Care Society.

Donnie was a dearly loved father, grandfather, son, brother, and uncle, with many loving family members and close friends. He leaves behind his children, Bradley (Krista), Stratford, Ontario; Brianna (Justin), Toronto, Ontario; parents, Gussie and Adelaide MacLellan; Inverness; grandchildren, Audrey and Carson; sister, Laurie (Charles) Smith, Antigonish; niece and nephew, Taylor and Devin; and many loving extended family members and friends. Donnie was born on June 17th, 1960, and grew up in the town of Inverness, Cape Breton. He left at an early age and lived in several places across Canada over the years making many friends and leaving his mark everywhere he went. The most recent being in Sussex, New Brunswick, where he owned and operated Roxie’s Food Truck and Catering, which was named after his treasured dog Roxie. Donnie was always a self-made entrepreneur and never shied away from hard work. He owned and operated many businesses over the years and was at his best when he was active and pursuing bigger and better things. From the time Donnie was very young he created his own opportunities to get out and enjoy life. In grade five, he was in a band called “The 5B’s” and by high school he was busy every weekend hosting events like teen dances and disco skating at the local arena. He was the kind of DJ that worked hard to make sure everyone was included and having fun, and he never missed the chance to give away a prize or make someone smile. His contagious laugh would fill a room and his motto in life was always “the more the merrier!” Donnie was also an avid sportsman. Throughout his school years he played basketball, hockey, and held records in track and field. After he left school he continued to coach teams and volunteered to help many people and organizations throughout his community in which he gained the respect and affection of many. Donnie was a true Cape Bretoner and very proud of it. He loved his family, his home, music and playing guitar, sports, and was ever the life of the party. No matter where he went over the years or where his career may have taken him, his good humour and generous spirit touched everyone he met. A graveside service will be held in Stella Maris Parish Cemetery on August 23rd, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. with Father Danny MacLennan officiating. Memorial donations in memory of Donnie may be made to Stella Maris Parish Cemetery Fund, Inverness.

Despite her battle with cancer Cornelia got to spend her last year doing what she loved most, watching her son play sports, get accepted to post secondary school, and most recently, become a high school graduate. While also seeing her daughter reconnect with her love of horses. A big thank you is due to all the incredible people at CBHEC/A and all the people of the Margaree for their love and support generously given to Cornelia and her family during multiple bouts of illness over the years. The family would also like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all that were involved in Cornelia’s care especially Dr. Ritter, Dr. Egar, Lori Ann MacDonald, and Melissa Beaton. The love and compassion you showed her will never be forgotten. Cornelia is survived by her son, Darius Stone and his father Darren Stone; daughter, Chelsea MacIntosh and her father Bob Reeves; brothers, Franklin (Joanie), and Byron (Denise); sisters Adrienne (James) Thompson and Donnetta (Ian) Maclean; as well as many nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her brother Roland, as well as her parents Shirley and Donnie. Memorial donations in memory of Cornelia may be made to the Central Inverness Palliative Care Society or Cape Breton Cancer Patient Fund. A celebration of life will be held at a later date.

He enjoyed woodworking and with this talent he did many renovations around the house. He loved nothing more than spending time outside, whether it was going fishing, or enjoying time at his shore with his family.

We feel that heaven just gained a new handyman. Dad was born, and lived most of his life, in Creignish. His parents were Alex Angus and Bessie MacEachern and he had a younger brother Joseph (Ruth). He grew up in a fishing and farming household and his early education was in Creignish and Judique. He left home at age 16, got a welding trade in Halifax and proceeded to work on some of Canada’s major infrastructure projects of the ’50s: the Canso Causeway and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. He returned home to work with Stora Forest Industries and worked in various capacities as a stationary engineer until his retirement. He married Clare MacDonald, from Long Point, in 1962, and started a new adventure that lasted the rest of his life. Dad rarely had an idle moment. He inherited his father’s lobster license and fished until the age of 80. He would leave work at the end of the day and come home to fish in the evening. He was also dedicated to service of family, faith, and his community. He was active in church repairs. He was a member of parish council and was very involved in decisions and construction of the Creignish Recreation Centre and the pastoral centre. He was passionate about cars and kept the family cars running, and those of friends, while finding time to fix a series of antique cars. He was self-taught and resourceful. Dad had many interests. He had a deep love of Scottish music and aspired to be a fiddler. He and Mom attended many concerts and enjoyed many square sets over the years. He also took up bowling and golfing as he neared retirement. His hole-in-one certificate is still hanging in the den. Dad was one of those die-hard Leafs fans and Saturday nights were often spent in front of the TV. If not, it is likely that he and Mom were at a card game. Mom and Dad were serious contenders and would compete in seniors games and at their club. They were active members of the Evergreen Club in Port Hawkesbury. He even found time to play the occasional bingo game and helped operate them for over 30 years as a member of the Creignish Men’s Club. In the midst of all of this activity, he found time to be a great husband and father to six kids. Dad was a quiet man and his love shone brilliantly in his actions. He leaves his wife Clare; six children, Larry, Elaine (Richard) Pellerin, Garry (Shelley), Shelley (Ian) Graham, Todd (Jen) and Donna (Trevor) McLeod; 14 grandchildren, Crystal (Stephen), Simon, Julia, Isaac, Megan, Kaleb, Kate, Rory, Callum, Jamie, Sloane, Alec, Liam and Kendra; and three great-grandchildren, Conrad, Jessie and Lizzie. Dad lived a great life and is a true example of maximizing your time on earth. We are proud of him and the example he set of taking initiative, pursuing your interests, giving to your community, showing kindness, humility, and quietly caring for those you love. We are thankful for the wonderful care and support Dad received from Dr. Howard and the entire palliative care team at St. Martha’s Hospital. Visitation was from 2:00 – 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 – 9:00 p.m., on July 19th, at Haverstocks funeral home in Port Hawkesbury. Funeral was at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, July 20th at Stella Maris Roman Catholic church in Creignish; Rev Barrett Clare-Johnson officiated.

July 17th, 2024, we had to say that to our mother, Theresa Glencoe MacNeil (91 years young), who had faith, perseverance, and what we thought would be immortality. She has joined her husband Francis MacNeil, her son Kevin MacNeil, her adoptive parents Duncan Peter and Maggie (MacEachern) Campbell, and her adoptive brother John Hughie and wife Mary (Young) MacDonald in eternal life. Theresa spent her life growing up in Glencoe Mills and began working at a very young age. She later needed to spread her wings and moved to Windsor. She really enjoyed Windsor and Detroit and all the antics that took place. She later moved to Toronto to work. This is where she met her future husband Francis – maybe some days, not the love of her life – but they shared 42 years of marriage that was full of dance, laughter, and entertainment. They moved back to Glencoe where their family grew to four, Kevin, Blaine (Donna), Debra (Ron) MacDonell, and Terrence (Mary). Mom started to work at Mary’s Hill Home after her youngest started school. This is where she was employed until the home closed in 1997. She has many fond memories spending time with the residents and there was much laughter with her co-workers. Theresa was head cook in the kitchen and was very proud of her certification later in life. Theresa managed to convince Francis to move to Mabou and they both enjoyed this new adventure. This is when their children started having children: Justin, Travis, Marissa, Emily, Duncan, Dylan, Malcolm, Clayton, and Terryn. This was where the happiest times were, always celebrating Theresa’s birthday in a unique way! Then in recent years, Theresa got to enjoy the blessings of great-grandchildren: Cooper, Georgia, Bentley, Colson, Thomas, Nicholas, and Paisley. Theresa enjoyed life and every stranger became her friend. She welcomed everyone into her home, which became known as the “Little Shoe” where she would hold “happy hour” every day at 5:00 p.m. Theresa enjoyed feeding all her guests with two drinks (because you can’t fly on one wing) and, of course, tea and biscuits. Please join us in celebrating the life of one heck of a lady. There will be visitation from 2:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Wednesday, July 24th, in Saint Mary’s Vestry Mabou. Funeral will be held Thursday, July 25th, at 2:00 p.m. in St. Joseph’s Parish Glencoe Mills with burial to follow. In the honour of Mom’s special love for Mary’s Hill Home, donations may be made to L’Arche Cape Breton (www.larchecapebreton.org) or to St. Joseph’s Cemetery, Glencoe. Although she was our mom she was a mom to many. If you knew Theresa Glencoe, now your life is blessed with one special angel.

Born in 1956, in Niagara Falls, and raised in Port Hood, John William was the oldest of eight children of the late Donald Angus Beaton and Mary Florence (MacIsaac) Beaton. John Willie (JW) was well known throughout the island and touched a much wider circle throughout the horse community. JW’s lifetime career was working in the construction industry as a masonry labourer and primarily worked for Brimac Masonry, but outside of work his real passion that never waned was for harness racing. Since he was a youngster, JW started attending the races in Inverness with his father. He would then begin going to the racetrack in Port Hood where he would help groom and jog horses and would spend many of his summers at Donmar Farms in Balls Creek under the guidance of Donald Rankin Senior. After graduating high school, JW travelled abroad to Pompano Park in Florida to work with the racehorses and would later receive his driver's license while working in Saint John, NB. After working away for some time, JW returned home to Port Hood and started driving in Inverness. Since then, JW raced at all the tracks around the Maritimes, especially at Tartan Downs, Northside Downs, and Inverness Raceway, and has owned and trained standardbreds with his wife Kim for many years. JW continued to catch drives for various other owners, totalling 993 lifetime wins, until his health issues began the last few years. JW has been inducted into the CB Horseman's Hall of Fame and has enjoyed his racing passion as it truly was a lifelong experience right up to his passing. JW is survived by his wife, Kim (Robertson) of 37 years; son, Johnathan (Colleen) Beaton; two granddaughters, Isabel and Abigail Beaton; two brothers, Donald Francis, Port Hood, Anthony (Lisa) Beaton, Waterdown, Ontario; and five sisters, Caddy (late Harold) Pond, Louise (Greg) MacInnis, Anita (late Danny) Gillis, Judique, Marcella (Brian) Ingraham, Port Hood, and Colina (Paul) Galan, Brampton, Ontario, as well as his many nieces and nephews. JW will be remembered for his story telling, humour, fullness of life, and love for the dance floor. JW will be immensely missed by all his family and friends.

She had a unique gift of making one feel loved, special, understood, heard, and for maintaining these lifelong friendships. Winnie was the first of four children born to Marie (Fogarty) and Frank MacInnis in Inverness, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. She is survived by her siblings, John (Theresa) Judique, Louise (Dudy, deceased) Inverness, Leo, Kingston, stepchildren, Daniel Suboski, Viki, William and Lisa (deceased), and her much loved MacInnis, Poirier, and Suboski nieces, nephews, grandnephews, grandnieces, and many cousins. Winnie had a long and varied nursing career. After completing studies for bachelor of nursing in Antigonish, she began working in Inverness and then moved on to Montreal and Sioux Lookout. She later obtained a BA in Psychology at Queens University, which led to working at the Kingston Penitentiary as a psychiatric nurse until she retired. It was in Kingston that she met the love of her life, Milt Suboski, professor at Queen's University with whom she had adventures, companionship, and later lovingly cared for him at home during a long illness before his death in 2008. Spirituality was an integral part of her life with connections to Christianity, Buddhism, Life Energy Fundamentals, and she was a Jin Shin practitioner. Winnie remained an avid reader, and a lifelong learner with interests that included yoga, her book club, and most recently helping with a pollinator garden, Irish dancing and playing the ukulele. Lover of fiddle music and square dancing, she enjoyed many a night at the Cape Breton square dances. She also enjoyed swimming at the beach in Inverness and visiting with her family and many friends on her vacations back to her hometown. The family would like to thank her friends, and the staff, nurses and doctors at Kingston General Hospital and Providence Care for their professional and caring support. Towards the end of her life, she suggested to a friend that she did not have enough time for dancing, laughing and visiting her hometown. To remember her, take a moment to do something you love, whatever it may be, and may Winnie now laugh and dance with the angels. As per Winnie’s wishes there will be no formal service.\n\nTIMMONS\n\nRalph Edward Timmons, August 24th, 1954 – July 8th, 2024: Ralph Edward Timmons, beloved husband, father, brother, and friend passed away suddenly. Born in Inverness on August 24th, 1954, he was the son of the late Eddie and the late Mary Catherine (Finn) Timmons. Ralph was known for his unwavering selflessness and passion for camping, hunting, fishing, and his love of music. Ralph touched the lives of all who knew him and left everyone smiling. Ralph passed away doing what he loved to do most: camping with his wife of 46 years, the person he loved most, Denise. Ralph grew up in Inverness before going on to follow his university studies at St. F.X. in Antigonish. After two years of studying and partying, he moved to Toronto where he began working as a lab technician for Lever. This is where he met the love of his life, Denise (of Grand Étang) in 1976. They were married two years later and decided to move back home to Cape Breton to start a family. There was no better place for Ralph to live than Cape Breton Island; the ocean, the wilderness, and the music called to him and it showed in how he spent each and every day. Upon arriving in Cape Breton, he started as a helper on a few fishing boats throughout the ’80s before purchasing his own fishing boat: the “Flying Swan” in the early ’90s. That was eventually replaced with the “Peter Pan,” the “Cory and Kiel,” and finally was able to have his dream boat built, “L’Écossois,” where he and Denise could fish in luxury and comfort until they decided to sell the gear and retire. Throughout his entire fishing career, he graciously shared the fruits of his labours with any visiting family members who thoroughly enjoyed his perfectly cooked crustacean cuisine. As much as Ralph loved being on the ocean, he was equally in his glory in the Cape Breton wilderness; camping, trout fishing, hunting, skiing, snowshoeing, blueberry picking, and anything else involving nature. When he wasn’t enjoying the outdoors, nothing made Ralph happier than playing the guitar and singing songs. Even though he kept himself busy, there was always time for others. He volunteered with plenty of organizations around town including being on the board of AMAC, he was a member of the Cheticamp Search and Rescue for over 30 years, helping new hunters with firearm safety and map and compass classes, and of course he was always willing to sing a tune or seven for any event around town. This cheerful outdoorsman will be remembered forever by his loving wife Denise, his incredible sons Cory and Kiel (Mandy), and his adored dog, Ila. Survived by his loving siblings, Ralph is remembered by his brother Donnie Timmons (Theresa), and sisters Edna MacNeil (Jimmy), Kathleen Timmons, and Jean MacDonald (Finley), and all of his loving nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends. Besides his parents, Ralph was predeceased by his sisters Mary Jesse Gallant (Doug) and Catherine (in infancy). Cremation has taken place and everyone was welcome to join the family at La salle des Retraités – Senior’s Hall in Cheticamp on Saturday, July 13th, from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. for a celebration of life and sing-along. A private graveside service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (https://www.heartandstroke.ca/) or a charity that would be dear to Ralph’s heart.\n\nMAILLET\n\nOn December 10th, 2023, our loving mother, Ann Gloria Maillet (Gillis), 78, was received into the loving arms of our Saviour. Ann was born on April 1st, 1945, in Southwest Margaree in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia to Peter and Catherine (MacKinnon) Gillis. Ann left her beloved island at the age of 18 and immigrated to the United States, landing in Waltham, MA. Ann quickly found her calling as a nurse’s aide, immeasurably touching the lives of her many patients with her endless kindness and generosity. Ann also had great wit and a wicked sense of humour, as evidenced by the stories she would share about growing up in a small rural community in Canada, attending a one-room schoolhouse as a child. It is there that she so often found herself sent to the corner after instigating mischief. To know Ann, was to love her and we hope that her spirit of kindness, love, and joy of life will inspire those she knew to find the beauty in the benign and to never be too shy to tell someone you love them. Ann is survived by her children, Karen Saisa, Shawn Maillet (Gina), Cheryl MacMillan (Craig); grandchildren Olivia (David), Ben, Athena, Natalie, Shania, Jack; and great-grandson Leo. Also survived by siblings Lorraine Gillis Jones, Donald Gillis (Florence), Jimmy Gillis and Margaret Maillet; as well as many cherished nieces and nephews. In eternal life she joins her loving parents; sisters, Mary, Caroline and Sandra; brother-in-law Lawrence; nephews Stephen and Roger; and niece Corrina. Her funeral mass and burial will take place at St. Josephs Parish in Southwest Margaree on Monday, July 29th, at 11:00 a.m.\n\nMORRISON\n\nEdward William Morrison, aged 56 years, of Port Hood, passed away suddenly, surrounded by family at Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital, on July 4th, 2024.

Throughout his life, Eddie was an avid biker and was lovingly referred to as “Ninja Ed”. He was also very keen on his crossword puzzles and eagerly looked forward to Saturday's editions of the New York Times. He was a huge fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and an even bigger fan of carrot cake cream cheese icing! He loved to play Assassin's Creed and would often seek help from his nephews to help him beat a level. He will be deeply missed by his little dog, Baby, who has been his comfort for many years.

One could start by listing some of her remarkable accomplishments: A professional wilderness guide with over 1,000 days living, sleeping, and caring for clients in the remote areas of the world. An acclaimed wildlife and landscape photographer. A poet. An academic. A pilot. But that would not capture her independent spirit that fueled her passion for learning, exploring, and constantly discovering new limits. It would not capture the immense compassion and kindness Natalie brought to the world. She had a deep love and curiosity for the wild and natural places, which led her to seek out the breathtaking moments that so many of us miss in the busyness of our day-to-day lives. Natalie shared her passion through her camera lens and her storytelling. Her generosity was vast, taking many of us along on her countless adventures as she explored the world: observing narwhals breach from the floe edge in Nunavut, trekking through the valleys of Baffin Island, encountering penguins and icebergs while sea kayaking in Antarctica, and experiencing the world from the bird’s-eye view of her favourite plane, the Twin Otter. (To name just a few). Never thwarted by limitations that would stymie most, she always followed through on her dreams. In short, Natalie was epic. She was loved. She lived life to the fullest. We’ve never been so grateful for the odyssey she left behind, giving us access to her unique perspective of the world through her meticulous record keeping of her photos and poetry. Natalie released her first book of poetry in 2021 titled This is Where Atlantis Sank. In her 34 years, she did not waste a second. This is Where Atlantis Sank – June 17th, 2024, 8:15 a.m., 42.724997° N 073.790118° W. Natalie is survived by her mother, Mary Yap, brother Matthew Yap,11-year old rescue dog Stikine, and many cousins, aunts, uncles, and friends. She will be deeply missed by the thousands of lives that she touched, on all corners of the globe. Natalie’s celebration of life was held on Sunday, June 23rd, 2024, from 1:00-3:00 p.m. at Kane-Jerrett Funeral Homes 6191 Yonge Street, Toronto.\n\nGOOGOO\n\nChief Alexander Brian “Sandy” Googoo, 60, of We’koqma’q First Nation, passed away suddenly on Wednesday, June 19th, 2024, in Victoria County.

Colleen had the gift to gab. She could spark up a conversation with anyone. She had friends everywhere. During her life she overcame obstacles, no one else thought possible. She was very strong willed and determined. Colleen enjoyed her life and impressed many who had the pleasure of meeting her. She had worked at Walmart in Port Hawkesbury for 16 years. She brought so many smiles to peoples’ faces who stopped by to have a chat. She fought hard those 16 years, giving her all even through her tough days, always showing up with a smile. Colleen enjoyed the simple things in life. She was her happiest heading out on the weekends with her mother to enjoy late nights at the Port Hawkesbury Legion or the Carriage House, sitting around and gossiping with her friends. She loved listening and dancing to the music. She would never turn down an opportunity to dance the night away. Colleen was always daddy’s girl. The first born to steal Danny’s heart. He took so much pride in all her accomplishments. He was Colleen’s private taxi, making sure she got out on the weekends to enjoy herself, giving her the opportunity to go to Granville Green, work at Walmart, taking drives to see family and making sure she had the best Christmas possible. She had her father wrapped around her fingers. Colleen's whole life revolved around her three nieces. The days they were born, she was the proudest. Sophia – the oldest, her goddaughter, spent endless days and nights never being apart. They enjoyed going out shopping together and Snapchat filters. Always being each other's listening ears and can't forget the love they shared with cuddles, kisses, and hugs. They were each other's rock. The bond these two shared will never be broken and will live on in Sophia's heart forever. Arabella was Colleen’s sidekick. She enjoyed being snuggled so close to Colleen and sharing endless laughs while scrolling through Snapchat, finding the silliest filters and bursting out laughing. Bella also enjoyed and took part in doing anything possible for Colleen. She would be the first to the kitchen to make Colleen a coffee, some toast and an egg. Colleen was the absolute best aunt to Sophia and Bella, giving them anything and everything. She spoiled those girls at Christmas time, birthdays, you name it, she never hesitated to spend a dollar on them. She was the proudest aunt you could ever ask for. She will be missed, so dearly. While growing up in Port Hawkesbury, she always had her twin sisters. Crystal and Diane grew up always having the respect and drive to appreciate people of all abilities. Colleen was their hero. They looked up to her and made sure she was always included. Crystal and her brother-in-law, Josh, had a special bond with Colleen. Taking her into their care after her mother passed away. From the day she moved in, she knew she was safe. She had so much love for both. She always said she was treated like a queen. She enjoyed her hot dogs and her Pepsi. Josh treated her like his own. She was so loved. It was never a dull moment being an aunt to five dogs, she loved each and every one and they made her so happy. She will be missed by Porky, Benji, Remi, Sasha, and Scotch. Her newest niece, Rielle, came early at 27 weeks. She wanted to make sure Colleen got a glimpse of her with pictures and FaceTimes. Colleen was so proud of Rielle. Always making sure she was doing okay. She couldn't wait to hold her and spoil her too. Colleen and her sister Diane loved each other immensely. She was so proud of the mother Diane became. Diane made sure Colleen always had the most beautiful pictures, and aunty gifts. She made Colleen feel so blessed. She will also miss her fur nephew Harley, who always put a smile on her face. Colleen’s most favourite pastime was talking on FaceTime, seeing her friends and family light up with each call. It got Colleen through some dark days. She was the happiest talking to Harriet Timmons. She could never get enough. She would enjoy every minute of their chats four or five times a day. Harriet kept Colleen calm, happy, loved, and adored. The family can’t thank her enough for her support. If she wasn’t talking to Harriet, she would be FaceTiming her cousin Irene, aunt Linda, or Sophia and Bella with Harley in the background. The family would like to thank everyone who supported Colleen, including friends, Sheila MacNeil and Tanya DeCoste, who went above and beyond for Colleen during her hospital stays. Her aunt Sharon and aunt Crystal, who never left her side when the scary times came. Her cousin Dakota for being her hairstylist. The Knocton family for their love and support, especially Seraya, who made Colleen feel the most beautiful she had felt in years. A special thanks to, Evelyn MacRae for visiting her at her bedside and enjoying some songs and letting Colleen have one last dance. Colleen will be forever missed by everyone. Fly high with Momma, Colleen. She needed you! A celebration of life will take place at a later date.\n\nMacDONALD\n\nJohn Hugh MacDonald, Broad Cove, Inverness County, passed away at home on June 18th, 2024, at the age of 73. John was born in Inverness to the late Donald and Anne (Gillis) MacDonald, the sixth of eight children, on March 14th, 1951. On December 28th, 1973, John married Lorraine in East Margaree; shortly thereafter, they started their family and raised three daughters together in Broad Cove, where he lived his entire life. John attended the Nova Scotia Institute of Technology in Halifax to become a plumber and pipefitter. He was a member of the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters, Local 682 for over 50 years and worked across Canada and within Cape Breton on many major construction projects that were central to the communities they operated in, such as hospitals, schools, universities, oil and gas, and more. In addition to his career, his real love was hobby farming which involved many animals, making hay, and selling sods. John loved his community of Broad Cove and the parish of Saint Margaret of Scotland Catholic Church. He was a fixture in the planning of the annual Broad Cove Scottish Concert and always looked forward to this main event of the year, and the preparations with good friends, family and neighbours that led up to it. John’s family was most important to him, and with Lorraine always by his side, they welcomed everyone to the family home in Broad Cove. Full of hospitality, it was a place where people connected over conversation, tea and good food, always. He loved it most when the house was full of his family and grandchildren and loved hearing about everyone’s accomplishments and adventures. His keen interest in people saw him with friends from across generations; everyone was a “good buddy” and he loved sharing a good story and joke. He had a quest for information; there wasn’t a newscast missed, by radio, print, television, or the internet. Harness racing was a love of his, he regularly attended the races in Inverness and watched the ones from far and wide online. John had many other interests including politics, sports, sawmills, and loved being educated by his grandchildren who shared with their grandpa about the world they are growing up in. John is survived by his wife of 50 years, Lorraine (nee LeBlanc); his three daughters, Jennifer (Steve Ashton) of Halifax, Jocelyn (Dan Jackson) of Halifax, and Joanne (Matt MacIsaac) of Yarmouth; as well as his grandchildren, Maya Ashton, Charlotte, and Flora Jackson, Luke and Sarah Burns. He is also survived by his siblings, Effie Rankin (late Joe), Rona MacLean (late Neil C), Mary Peddle (late Albert), Randy MacDonald (Eleanor), Jake MacDonald (Laura), Dolores Chapin (Paul), Michael MacDonald; cousin, Anne MacLeod; as well as his LeBlanc in-laws and many nieces, nephews, and cousins. John was predeceased by his infant daughter, his parents, and his in-laws, John Joseph and Annie Rose LeBlanc. As we move forward without him, we are left with many cherished memories of his kindness, generosity, faith, humour, and devotion to his people and community. There will be many reminders of him, ensuring that his presence is always felt in our lives. Visitation will took place on Tuesday, June 25th, in Inverness Funeral Home, 45 MacIsaac Street, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Funeral mass took place on Wednesday, June 26th, in St. Margaret of Scotland Catholic Church in Broad Cove at 11:00 a.m., followed by burial in the parish cemetery.
