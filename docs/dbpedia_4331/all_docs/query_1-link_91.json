        "text": "Standardbred inductees include horses San Pail and Odies Fame and people John Ferguson Sr., Yves Filion and Bruce Johnston. The Thoroughbred inductees are Wise Dan, Dahlia, Mark Casse, Dr. Michael Colterjohn and Daryl Wells, Sr.\n\nSan Pail, bred by co-owner Glenn Van Camp of Port Perry, Ontario and co-owned by trainer Rod Hughes of Dunsford, Ontario, is one of the sport’s most popular horses in recent years. He retired in September 2015 following a career that saw him win 52 of 114 races, record a mark of 1:50.4 and earn over\n\n$3.1 million. Partnered with regular driver Randy Waples, San Pail dominated Canadian harness racing in 2011, topping the charts for older trotting horses in North America with over $1.2 million in earnings and 14 wins in 16 races, highlighted by victories in every stakes event he competed in. The season included his third consecutive victory in the Maple Leaf Trot and and a Breeders Crown Championship where he defeated a world class field of trotters and was joined by hundreds of racing fans and supporters in the winner’s circle. In December 2011, San Pail was honoured at the Trotteur Francais International Awards in Vincennes, Paris. Voted the O’Brien Award winner as Canada’s Older Trotting Horse in 2009, 2010 and 2011, he also won O’Brien Awards and Dan Patch Awards as Horse of the Year and a Dan Patch Award as Trotter of the Year in 2011. Reaching beyond harness racing, San Pail was named Equine Canada’s Canadian Bred Horse of the Year in 2011 and was inducted into the Scugog Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nOdies Fame, purchased for $7,500 by Buddy (Harold) Wellwood and Dr. Norm Amos at the 1997 Forest City Yearling Sale, raced 77 times from 1998 through 2001 and managed 26 wins, 13 seconds, 9 thirds, earnings of $1,410,720 and a mark of 1:52 while under the care of Wellwood. A daughter of CHRHF member Apaches Fame, she posted six track records at age two, set a World Record of 1:52.3 on a five-eighths mile track at Rideau Carleton and was almost unbeatable in the Ontario Sires Stakes where she won seven of nine events and earnings of $247,800. She received two O’Brien Awards being awarded Canada’s Horse of the Year and Two-Year-Old Pacing Filly of the Year. At age three, she had 8 wins in 21 races, just under $800,000 in earnings, and scored victories in the Fan Hanover and Breeders Crown Championship. She was again a divisional champion in the Ontario Sires Stakes, winning five of eight events and over $161,000. Named the Canadian Sportsman’s Readers’ Choice Award winner as the 1999 Horse of the Year over triple crown winner Blissfull Hall, Odies Fame also added another O’Brien trophy to her collection as she was voted Canada’s Three-Year-Old Pacing Filly of the Year, as well as the Dan Patch Award for her division, despite not setting foot in the U.S. Odies Fame raced as a four and five-year-old, mainly in Woodbine Entertainment’s top fillies and mares class and an injury forced her into retirement in September, 2001.\n\nYves Filion, 69 of Saint-Andre-D’argent, Quebec, a member of one of Canada’s greatest harness racing families, was one of his province’s premier trainer-drivers for close to 30 years, driving in over 18,000 races with 4,387 wins and $26.7 million in earnings. Training credits include 273 winners and earnings of almost $3.7 million. He bred many successful horses at his Bayama Farms including Runnymede Lobell and Goliath Bayama. Yves trained and drove Runnymede Lobell to victory in the 1988 North America Cup, his richest of 31 career wins to go along with over $1.6 million in earnings. Filion also bred and trained Goliath Bayama to 25 wins and earnings of over $1.5 million in his career. After his two-year-old season, Yves turned the driving duties over to his son Sylvain. The pair combined for a runner- up finish in the North America Cup in his three-year-old campaign. Yves, the brother of Hall of Famer Herve Filion, is the youngest of eleven children. His son, Sylvain Filion, was Canada’s Driver of the Year in 2012, 2013 and 2015.\n\nThe late John B. Ferguson may be best known for his time in the National Hockey League, but his passion for Canadian horse racing was drawn from early years spent with his father and grandfather, both Thoroughbred horsemen, at old Hastings Park in Vancouver, BC. During his time with the Montreal Canadians, he became a fixture at Blue Bonnets Raceway. He ventured into harness horse ownership in the early 70s as a partner with Del MacTavish Sr. and Roger White in trotter Harlan Marv and later teamed up with the Stall Family in forming Double Two Ranch to campaign horses such as Keystone Sandra and Comet Angus.\n\nOn the advice of Hall of Fame Breeder Elgin Armstrong, Ferguson began purchasing fillies with breeding potential. He eventually sold most of the mares except Lady Kin Hanover, the dam of Merger, who Ferguson bred. Merger was syndicated at the age of two for over $8 million before going on to win the 1982 Little Brown Jug.\n\nAs an owner, Ferguson’s best horse was Hardie Hanover, Canada’s Three-Year-Old Pacing Filly of the Year in 1994, a winner of the Fan Hanover and Breeders Crown and over $718,000 in purse money.\n\nIn addition to his role as a very active owner and breeder, Ferguson was involved in track management. He was hired by Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal, Quebec, and after leaving the NHL became the President of Windsor Raceway. He was also one of the driving forces behind the formation of the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and assisted with researching and writing the by-laws.\n\nIn 1976, Bruce Johnston of Aylmer, Ontario, acquired The Canadian Sportsman, ‘the oldest turf journal in America’. His editorial policy was to promote harness racing and to suggest proposals, such as those that resulted in improvements to the Ontario Sires Stakes format in 1991. Under Johnston’s leadership, The Canadian Sportsman became one of the sport’s leading publications. His “Short Turns” column was known for its wit and tales of fictional racing characters.\n\nJohnston was also involved in various racing related lobbying efforts and was an active member of the Ontario Agriculture and Horse Racing Coalition. He was posthumously named winner of the Canadian Standardbred Horse Society’s General Achievement Award for 1993, recognizing excellence, leadership and contributions to the Canadian Standardbred breeding industry. That same year the Johnston Cup was established in his memory and is awarded annually to the leading trainer in the Ontario Sires Stakes. Johnston owned several horses including Sam Fella and Pickerel and one of his broodmares produced the $127,000 winning trotter, Dream Of Ironstone. Johnston died suddenly in May, 1993, from a heart attack at age 59.\n\nThe Thoroughbred inductees in the CHRHF class of 2016 are:\n\nWise Dan’s racing career concluded in 2014 at the age of seven after 23 wins and two seconds in 31 starts, amassing a bank account of $7,552,920 for breeder/owner Morton Fink and trainer Charles LoPresti. Included in these impressive statistics for the multiple graded stakes winner, were back-to-back wins in the Ricoh Woodbine Mile Stakes (G1) in 2012 and 2013. The chestnut gelding’s 2013 victory in that race was in an impressive course record of 1:31.75. Wise Dan also had back-to-back wins in the Breeders’ Cup Mile (G1) 2012, 2013 and was honoured as Eclipse Award Horse of the Year in both 2012 and 2013 as well as Champion Grass Horse and Champion Older Horse in the U.S. in those two years. Wise Dan’s bloodlines can be traced back to the great Northern Dancer and his pedigree also includes 1973 Triple Crown winner and two-time Horse of the Year Secretariat, who is the grandsire of Wise Dan’s dam Lisa Danielle, also owned and campaigned by Fink.\n\nBred in Kentucky by Nelson Bunker Hunt, french-trained Dahlia was regarded as an equine pioneer of international racing. The filly was under the tutelage of Maurice Zilber from age two through five. She was later owned by Allen Paulson and trained by Charlie Whittingham. She won Group or Grade 1 stakes in five different countries including Canada, when she won the Canadian International in 1974 as a four-year-old. That Canadian victory brought international attention to the race and subsequently resulted in other European horses making the trip to Toronto for the annual turf event. She spent much of her race career taking on the boys, doing so 35 times in her 48 starts, and was the first female horse to surpass $1 million in career earnings. Total career stats include a record of 15-3-7 in 48 starts with earnings of $1,489,105. As a broodmare, she produced three Grade 1 winners – Dahar, Rivlia and Delegant.\n\nMark Casse, to date is the winner of seven Sovereign Awards as Canada’s Outstanding Trainer and ten leading-trainer titles at Woodbine. Born in Indiana in 1961, he took over his father’s Kentucky operation at the age of 18 and soon after scored his first winner as trainer at Keeneland. A 69-win season in 2002 earned Casse his first Woodbine trainers’ title. Since then, he’s trained a number of Sovereign Award winning horses including three Horses of the Year – Lexie Lou (2014) bred by fellow 2016 inductee Dr. Michael Colterjohn, Uncaptured (2012), and 2013 CHRHF mare Sealy Hill (2007), the only filly to win the Canadian Triple Tiara. Other champions include My Conquestadory and Marchfield. In 2011, Casse won a record 119 races, surpassing the previous mark of 89 victories by Frank Passero in 1995 and collected a then-record $6.6 million plus in purses. He saddled Lexie Lou to win both the Queen’s Plate and Woodbine Oaks in 2014. 2015 was Casse’s biggest year yet, as he amassed $13.6 million in purses with 159 winners including Breeders’ Cup Grade 1 wins with both Tepin, 2015 Eclipse Award-winner as Champion Turf Female, and Catch a Glimpse, who is a 2015 Sovereign finalist as Canada’s Outstanding 2-year-old Filly. Other achievements on Casse’s training resume include 8 Canadian Classic wins, 46 graded stakes win and 170 stake wins. In addition, he has trained three winners of the Woodbine Oaks, three Prince of Wales winners and one Breeders’ Stakes winner. Non-training roles in the racing industry include that of Director of HBPA and Steward of the Jockey Club of Canada.\n\nThe late Dr. Michael Colterjohn, born in Edinburgh, Scotland, immigrated with his family to Canada at the age of 11 living in Lindsay, ON, where his father Duncan was a family physician. Michael grew up surrounded by horses, fostering a passion for show jumping and fox hunting which inspired a career as one of Canada’s top equine reproductive veterinarians. He joined Gardiner Farms in 1987 and was soon named farm President. Under his management, the Caledon East farm became one of the country’s most well-respected and accomplished breeding operations. He built a quality broodmare band to elevate the farm into a significant player in the Canadian-yearling market.\n\nGardiner Farms Limited bred numerous stakes winners including Kitty’s Got Class, winner of the Fanfreluche Stakes and Victorian Queen Stakes, both at Woodbine, for Colterjohn and Denny Andrews. Gardiner Farms Limited’s other stakes winners as breeder include Are You Serious, Bear It’s Time, Cocney Lass, Legal Move, London Snow, Midnight Shadow, Rare Friends, and Top Ten List. Following the sale of Gardiner Farms 2008, Colterjohn along with his wife Dr. Moira Gunn and farm manager Sherry McLean, purchased the Gardiner livestock he had spent so much time and effort amassing and the three partners launched Paradox Farm Inc. The long list of Paradox-bred horses include 2014 Queen’s Plate winner Lexie Lou along with venerable Ontario Sire stakes performer, Pender Harbour.\n\nThe voice of Daryl Wells, Sr. became as much a part of Ontario thoroughbred racing as the track where he honed his craft. His career as announcer for the OJC began when the Etobicoke, ON track opened in 1956 and the assignment also included calling races at Fort Erie and Greenwood. Twenty years later, he began focussing exclusively on races at Woodbine, providing an opportunity for his son Daryl, Jr. to take over at Fort Erie. Wells’ broadcast career began as a disc jockey at the age of 15 in British Columbia, moving east several years later, working in the sports department at radio station CHML in Hamilton, ON in the 1940s and ’50s, eventually becoming the sports director for Hamilton’s CHCH-TV. Working with another radio/TV legend Norm Marshall, Wells co-hosted the first four races live from Woodbine during weekday afternoons. In so doing, he provided easy-to-understand commentary which truly enhanced racing’s image and dramatically boosted its popularity and increased the sport’s fan base. His calls of Northern Dancer winning the Queen’s Plate in 1964 as well as Secretariat’s final race at Woodbine in 1973, live on in the memories of racing fans everywhere. Following his death in 2003, the headline in the Toronto Sun read, “Woodbine loses legend. Long-time announcer dies”\n\nThe Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame 2016 Induction Ceremony will be hosted at the Mississauga Convention Centre on Wednesday, August 3th, 2016.\n\nLocated at Woodbine Racetrack, Toronto, ON, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame is a national organization dedicated to honouring the best in Canadian horse racing as we preserve the history and heritage of the sport.\n\nAdditional information about the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame may be found atwww.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com\n\nStandardbred Inductees\n\nMale Horse Category: San Pail – Breeder, Glenn Van Camp, Port Perry, ON; owners Glenn Van Camp and Hughes Stable Inc., Dunsford, ON.; trainer, Rod Hughes; driver, Randy Waples.\n\nFemale Horse Category: Odies Fame – Breeder, Glengate Farms, Campbellville, ON; owners, Buddy (Harold) Wellwood and Dr. Norm Amos/Linda Wellwood, St. George, ON; trainers, Harold Wellwood, Lyle McArthur; primary driver, Dave Wall.\n\nBuilder Category: John Ferguson, Sr. (deceased), born in Vancouver, BC, resident of Montreal, QC, & Windsor, ON\n\nDriver/Trainer: Yves Filion, Saint-Andre-D’argent, QC\n\nCommunicator Category: Bruce Johnston, (deceased), Aylmer, ON\n\nThoroughbred Inductees\n\nMale Horse Category: Wise Dan – Bred and owned by Morton Fink, Chicago, IL; Trained by Charles LoPresti, Lexington, KY;\n\nVeteran Horse Category: Dahlia (deceased), bred and owned by Nelson Bunker Hunt, trained by Maurice Zilber, later owned by Allen Paulson and trainer Charlie Whittingham\n\nTrainer Category: Mark Casse, Ocala, FL\n\nBuilder Category: Dr. Michael Colterjohn (deceased), Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, resident of Lindsay ON and Caledon, ON\n\nCommunicator Category: Daryl Wells Sr. (deceased), Born in Victoria, BC, resident of Lewiston, NY"
