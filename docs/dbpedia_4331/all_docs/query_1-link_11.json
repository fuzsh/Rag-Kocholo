        "text": "2023 Hastings Thoroughbred Awards\n\n2023 Hastings Thoroughbred Awards\n\nBritish Columbia’s racing and breeding community were out in force this week to celebrate the very best of the 2023 Hastings’ racing season, writes Nigel Reid.\n\nThe event was again a near sell-out, with around 200 horsemen and women gathering at Vancouver’s popular Italian Cultural Centre.\n\nAs well as the horses, there were awards for leading owners, breeders, trainers, riders and backstretch staff, as well as the induction to the B.C. Thoroughbred Hall of Fame of Ron and Rae Fawcett of Tod Mountain Thoroughbreds, owner Terry Sangara and racing writer, Randy Goulding.\n\nThe evening was hosted in typically smooth style by Hastings’ track announcer Dan Juckic and paddock analyst Mike Heads, with the New Stride Thoroughbred Adoption Society once again on hand to raise money through the sale of 50-50 tickets, the auction of a limited-edition racing print of the legends John Henry and Bill Shoemaker, as well as a porcelain bowl depicting racing scenes.\n\nThere were no surprises in the Horse of the Year category, with the magnificent racemare INFINITE PATIENCE once again taking both BC-bred and Open Horse-of-the-Year crowns, as well as both BC-bred and Open divisions of the Older Filly/Mare category. Fans of the remarkable mare may also be delighted to hear that, according to her breeder and part-owner Bill DeCoursey, she is back in training at Hastings ahead of a 2024 campaign,.\n\nAppropriately, there were standing ovations for the recipients of two special awards on the night. Trainer Patricia Jarvis received the prestigious Richard Yates Backstretch Award, while the HBPA Diamond Award, which is reserved for particularly deserving candidates in recognition of their invaluable commitment to the sport of horse racing in British Columbia and beyond, was presented to Darlene Smith.\n\nThe New Stride 50-50 prize capped quite an evening for Eugene Chan, whose table of fellow owners were still busy celebrating after their filly LIZZIE RAYNE was crowned two-year-old filly of the year when he realized he had the winning ticket!\n\nWe’ll have lots of pictures and a full report from the big night in the next newsletter but, in the meantime, many congratulations to all the award recipients on Wednesday and much gratitude to those who organized what was a successful and enjoyable evening for all.\n\nOpen Horse of the Year: INFINITE PATIENCE\n\nOwner: William DeCoursey and R.
