        "text": "Below you will find all Candidates who were nominated by their peers for the Windsurfing Hall of Fame Class of 2023.\n\nThe balloting results were comprised of a popular vote from the Windsurfing Hall of Fame FB Group, a closed group of selected windsurfing veterans of at least 20 years of experience which counts for 30% of the vote. It was conducted through a FB Poll. The other 70% of the weighted vote came from an elite voting body composed of current WHOF Inductees. This was done through a Survey Monkey link sent out via email to all Inductees.\n\nBest of luck next year to the candidates who did not get in! This was the Year of the Internationals, so the focus was indeed taken off the many great wavesailors in Hawaii and beyond.\n\nWHOF Class of 2023 Candidates\n\nRider's Hall Men (5)\n\nAntoine Albeau – France – by Cliff Webb\n\nMickey Eskimo – Austria – by Jonathan Weston\n\nBrian Talma – Barbados – by Alex Williams\n\nRobby Seeger – Germany – by Jonathan Weston\n\nScotty H O'Connor – Australia – by Andrew Dolly Divola/Jonathan Weston/Dick Lamb\n\nErik Beale – UK/France – by Agostina/ Jonathan Weston\n\nNik Baker – UK – by Joanna Robbins/Cliff Webb/Ant Baker\n\nCesare Cantagalli– Italy – by Marcello Rivalta/Pietro Porcella\n\nErik Thieme – France – by Sébastien Ruyant\n\nRider's Hall Women (3)\n\nAlessandra Sensini– Italy – by Bryan McDonald/Pietro Porcella\n\nNatalie Simon – France – by Jonathan Weston\n\nTomoko Okazaki– Japan – by Sonja Evensen/Jonathan Weston\n\nAndrea Livingston-Barbara – USA – by Annie Gardner\n\nInge Bouwmeester – Netherlands – by Michiel Bouwmeester\n\nCarollAnn Alie – Canada – by Bryan McDonald\n\nJulie deWerd (RIP)– USA – by Joel Eser Richman\n\nCraftsmen (Shapers, Sailmakers, Innovators) (3)\n\nHugues de Turckheim – Shaper – France – by Jean-Paul Riou\n\nKevin Wadham – Sailmaker – Australia – by Stuart Gilbert\n\nMike Zajicek – Czechoslovakia – by Skip Boman\n\nBen Severn – Sailmaker – Australia by Jonathan Weston\n\nWillem Blauw – Sailmaker – Netherlands by Jonathan Weston\n\nNeil Pryde – Hong Kong – by Nils Nils Axel Rosenblad\n\nCharchulla Brothers – Innovators – Germany – by Chad Lyons\n\nAndré Lefèvre – Sailmaker – France – Sapina Michel\n\nMedia (Photographers, Filmmakers, Journalists) (3)\n\nCliff Webb – Photojournalist/Video Producer – UK by Jonathan Weston/Niklas Salzmann-Webb\n\nTaki Takiguchi (RIP) – Photographer – Japan – by Darrell Wong\n\nKazuhiro Shimokawatoko – Journalist – Japan – by Darrell Wong\n\nEric Sanford – Photojournalist – USA – by Jack Hennessy\n\nJace Panebianco – Filmmaker – USA – by Jonathan Weston\n\nBrian Caserio – Filmmaker – USA – by Larry Stanley\n\nAlex Williams – Photographer – UK – by Jonathan Weston\n\nPioneers & Promoters (3)\n\nMichiel Bouwmeester – Netherlands – by Stefania Poli/Inge Bouwmeester\n\nGreg Johns – Australia –by Scotty O'Connor\n\nPeter Brockhaus – Germany – by Steve West\n\nGlenn Taylor (RIP) – USA – by Dick Lamb\n\nMartin Spanjer (RIP) – Netherlands – Dick Lamb\n\nColin Perry – USA – Dick Lamb\n\nAlan Parducci (RIP) – USA #3 – Jonathan Weston\n\nBep Thijs – Netherlands – Jonathan Weston\n\nSusie Swatek – Jonathan Weston\n\nErnstfried Prade – Jonathan Weston\n\nJaap Van Der Rest – Holland – Jonathan Weston\n\nSerge Griessman – France – Jonathan Weston\n\nPitchforks! Run for the hills!\n\nI found it funny that I've had so few arguments over sailors chosen for the Rider's Hall of Fame. Hardly a peep out of anyone for both Class of 2021 nor 2022, just announced. I only get one vote as member of the WHOF Selection Committee, but I also weigh in heavily, after discussion with the SC, on how many get in. But this is not about that. It's about the newly developed categories, the first to be announced in particular:\n\nPHOTOGRAPHERS, FILMMAKERS, JOURNALIST.\n\nWhen I posted the inductees on FB Group WHOF, a lot of hands went up. What about this guy? What about that guy? Every pond has its pontificating pontif! Everyone gets a prize!\n\n​Why not EVERYONE GETS A PRIZE? For one, it takes a great deal of computer hours to wrangle and write content, graphically design bio pages and individual plaques. It's my free time gone to hell. I have a regular job and three book projects in the way. There are steep web hosting and computer/software expenses (my job won't let me use theirs anymore), with very few people pitching in with support. For two, it waters the golden waters down. There are a couple of guys I put in because I feel they deserve to be there, have dedicated their lives to the sport. Though I may not judge their imagery to be on par with those top shelf guys, who am I to judge? Longevity and passion for the sport are key to entry.\n\nOne other criterion was, How did they influence others to enter the sport, or changed their lives with their imagery or wordsmithering inspiration? Okay, not a word. There a couple of guys with their picture on that wall that were not really in it for the passion of the sport. It was more of a side gig to surfing and a way to make money. But they recognized the beauty of the sport and had a great INTERNATIONAL impact on others. A few like Tonix were late to the ballot due to drained memory cells, but those guys had passion and skills.\n\nHere's my consolation prize: I will create a list that follows those portraits titled, OTHER GREAT CONTRIBUTORS to the sport, and if you think so strongly about it, you should have campaigned ahead of time on WHOF FB site. I called for it, nothing but crickets and Buelhler's.\n\nBetter yet, put your money where your mouse is and donate to the Windsurfing Hall Of Fame. Without your support, the whole thing will be gone with the wind. Thanks for reading and your passion, your participation.\n\nJonathan Weston\n\nFounder/President\n\nWindsurfing Hall Of Fame\n\n​What's new with the Windsurfing Hall of Fame? A lot going on here I can tell you, so why don't I begin with the Facebook Windsurfing Hall of Fame page Nationality Polls. Each day, I've been posting a poll for a new nationality (and in some cases, grouping nations so this doesn't take all year). Those playing along can add names by scrolling down and using the Options field. The criteria of the candidate being at least 50 years old, not already in the 2021 WHOF Class, and unless otherwise stated, born and raised in that country.\n\nWhat will become of these polls? Is this just a game? This particular group is an Open FB group, therefore the audience is not vetted based on their experience and knowledge of the spor (only recently were the animals herding into the barn given a door full of questions). The younger body of voters leans toward who they have been exposed to. That said, this is a hall of FAME, therefore, many names still in the limelight seem to be rising to the top. However, it is also evident that many incredible sailors that should be at the top are garnishing only one or two votes. So the answer is yes, it's just a game. So why do it?\n\nThe original intention was to shed light on the people from all nations, that may not have ventured onto the international stage. Unfortunately, some of these incredible sailors who have long been retired or fled to ahem, other sports, feel slighted by the results. This is the downside of running any poll, and my apologies to them. They most likely will see themselves on the official ballot regardless of these \"fun\" polls, which are not fun to all.\n\nThe results are there to see for all members of the Official WHOF Voting Body and WHOF Selection Committee. There are two separate, closed and private groups. And...those that are receiving a ton of votes will most likely be seen on the official ballot. Their names are not surprising, and they do have a ring of Fame to their names.\n\nCurrently, the newly selected Selection Committee are voting on opening up pages for categorization of the WHOF: Photographers, Media, Sailmakers, Innovaters, Shapers, Pioneers... to name just a few.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n​JW"
