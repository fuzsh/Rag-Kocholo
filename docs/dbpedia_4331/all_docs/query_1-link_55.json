        "text": "History\n\nMore than 100 years of Glory\n\nOur epic story began more than a century ago, back in 1881 when we opened as the Ontario Jockey Club. Today, we have evolved from a picturesque little horse racing track in east Toronto to a world-class entertainment destination offering the very best dining, entertainment and horse racing experiences.\n\nHere is a timeline of our storied past\n\n1881\n\nOntario Jockey Club Opens its Doors in Toronto\n\nJuly 1 Queen’s Plate is held at “The Woodbine,” a picturesque track by the shores of Lake Ontario.\n\n1939\n\nFirst Monarch at the Races\n\nKing George VI witnesses the running of the King’s Plate at Woodbine Park, later named “Old Woodbine” and then Greenwood.\n\n1947\n\nOJC Expansion – and Raising the Racing Standards\n\nNewly appointed director Edward Plunket Taylor embarks on an ambitious scheme to raise horse racing standards in the Toronto area to the high standards of leading racetracks in North America. He also begins to radically expand the club. Under his inspired leadership, OJC acquires local racetracks (Hamilton, Thorncliffe, Long Branch, Dufferin and Stamford) and consolidates its racing charters into three racetracks: Fort Erie, Greenwood and a to-be-built Woodbine.\n\nBy the end of 1955, the OJC has enough racing charters to conduct 196 thoroughbred and 252 standard bred race dates.\n\n1950\n\nMaple Leaf Trot Stakes Race Run for the First Time at Dufferin Park\n\n1954\n\n“Old Woodbine” Opens for Standard bred Racing\n\n1956\n\nFirst World-Class Racetrack Opens in Etobicoke\n\nThe brand new modern and spacious racing facility in Etobicoke – 780 acres – takes Woodbine to the big leagues.

Taylor’s master plan to streamline the province’s racing industry and transform a fragmented, inefficient “leaky-roof circuit” into one of the world’s elite racing facilities.\n\nMomentum and excitement from the opening of this beautiful large facility sparks an evolution and growth that forever changes the landscape of the Canadian horseracing industry and makes it one of the best anywhere in the world.\n\n1959\n\nThe Queen and Prince Phillip at the Plate\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh attend the Queen’s Plate for the first time.\n\n1963\n\nMohawk Racetrack Opens for Harness Racing\n\nSpurred by an explosion in the popularity of standard bred racing, OJC builds a new harness racing facility in Southern Ontario.
