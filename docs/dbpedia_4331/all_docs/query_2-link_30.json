        "text": "Abrams grew up in Detroit and worked behind the scenes as a press officer for three record labels, including Motown. He created press for such famed musicians as Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Flo Ballard, The Supremes and The Miracles, and is credited with writing Bob Seger’s very first press release.\n\nIn 2009, Abrams co-wrote and starred in the musical “Memories of Motown” along with Motown song writer and record producer Mickey Stevenson.\n\nIn his 14 years as a resident of Findlay, Abrams authored several books reflecting on his involvement in the national music industry and its correlation to the Civil Rights movement. In 2011, he created “Motown Black & White,” which travels to venues around the globe.\n\nAbrams died in 2015. His philanthropic efforts continue to benefit local agencies including the Findlay-Hancock County Public Library, Hancock Historical Museum, Zonta Club of Findlay, the Hancock County Literacy Coalition, City Mission, Hancock Park District and First Step.\n\nBaker spent his formative years in Findlay, Ohio, attending Central Junior High and graduating from Findlay High School in 1993. He was a featured performer in the show choirs Central Edition, award-winning Findlay First Edition and performed in numerous musicals. He has since gone on to work at Wall Street at Salomon Asset Management, Nederlander Production Company of America, Sony Pictures Entertainment and TriStar Films with box office films and A-list clientele.\n\nBaker’s achievements include founding JB Studio in 2007 to develop emerging talent and guided more than 150 artists in all aspects of the entertainment industry, as well as New Renaissance Entertainment to manage a select few multi-hyphenate JB Studio students in 2015. He also received Best Actor for his role in Thank You for Not Smoking, an official entry in the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. Recently, Jonathan’s film, Crown Heights, for which he served as an executive producer, was presented at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and won the Audience Choice Award. The film was then selected by Amazon for global release and distribution.\n\nCable’s love of marching bands led him to establish the Arlington High School All Brass Marching Band in 1969. He later assisted Dr. Jack Taylor in establishing University of Findlay’s Marching Oiler Brass in 1997. During his time at Arlington, the band played for three Presidents of the United States during their Findlay and Hancock County.\n\nHis impressive record of community service includes serving on the University of Findlay’s Board of Governors, Blanchard Valley Center’s Board of Education and Board of Human Rights and Hancock Federal Credit Union’s Board of Directors. He is an active member of Curtain Raisers and received their Wall of Fame Award as well as the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Findlay.\n\nNominator, Dottie Wehrle, shared, “Ron made music fun for students… his career in the art of music and community service speaks volumes for the number of lives he has influenced.”\n\nOn the musical stage, Gavin played the leading role on Broadway in “Thoroughly Modern Millie;” “Mary Poppins” in London; “Hair,” both in London and on Broadway; “Book of Mormon,” in London and on Broadway, and more. He is next to perform in “She Loves Me,” in 2016 on Broadway.\n\nOn television, Gavin appeared in “Eloise at the Plaza,” and “Eloise at Christmastime,” both co-starring Julie Andrews. He also writes songs and has recorded three original albums.\n\nAmong his many achievements, Gavin is the recipient of the Sir Laurence Olivier Award in London for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for “Book of Mormon” (comparable to the Tony Award in the United States). He also received Tony Award nominations for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for “Thoroughly Modern Millie” and “Hair.”\n\nAttending Findlay schools from kindergarten through 12th grade, Gavin sang in various church choirs from the age of 3 to college age. He was active in Findlay school and vocal groups, musicals and Findlay First Edition performance group. He received his higher education from the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre and Dance.\n\nNominator Rosanna Palmer said, “With his many achievements, Gavin maintains a supportive professional demeanor within his career while being the genuinely kind and caring individual he has always been. Most compelling is the recognition for his excellence by the members of his profession.”\n\nCrouse first pursued a career in acting in 1928, but took a job as a publicist for the Theatre Guild and began writing for the stage, his first Broadway credit being in 1931 for “The Gang’s All Here.” Here he worked alongside some of the greatest theatrical minds, including Oscar Hammerstein and Howard Lindsay. It was with theatre veteran, Howard Lindsay, that he spent the greater portion of his career in collaboration. A partnership so successful it is considered to be one of the longest and most successful in Broadway history.\n\nLindsay and Crouse wrote and produced such well-known plays as “Anything Goes,” “Arsenic and Old Lace” and “The Sound of Music,” among many others. The collaboration of Crouse and Lindsay lasted until 1962, ultimately earning them a Tony achievement award in 1959 for a partnership that outlasted even that of Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nAmong these achievements, Crouse also earned the 1946 Pulitzer Price for Drama for “State of the Union,” a 1960 Tony award for the musical, “The Sound of Music,” and holds the record for the longest-running non-musical in Broadway history, “Life with Father.” Crouse is also a member of the Theatre Hall of Fame.\n\nNominator Gregory Meyers said, “His theatrical legacy is an enduring one, and Findlay and Hancock County should be proud of the fact that a young boy, who grew up on First St., is responsible for some of the most iconic plays in Broadway history.”\n\nDavid has played Monsieur Firmin in “Phantom of the Opera” for more than 7,000 performances, for six years on Broadway and 13 years all across America. He played Peron in “Evita” on Broadway more than 1,000 times – more than any other actor – and has appeared in 13 Broadway shows in all.\n\nReflecting upon his career, David was thrilled to play the same role of The Red Shadow in “The Desert Song,” on Broadway just as he had done at Findlay High School; he credits “Come Summer” on Broadway as most fun, as it was during the production he met his wife of 41 years, Britt Swanson Cryer; and he fondly remembers singing show stopper “Molasses to Rum” in Broadway show “1776.” David felt privileged to work with Leonard Bernstein in his “Mass” and played the lead role of The Celebrant at the Metropolitan Opera House all over the U.S. – more times than any other person.\n\nCryer is one of the founders of The American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, which was moved from its original location in Pittsburgh. He is also a founder of New York’s Mirror Repertory Theatre. As a producer, Cryer teamed with Albert Poland to create national tour “The Fantasticks” and “Now is Time for All Good Men,” which played in a New York theater now known as the Lucille Lortel Theatre. He also directed Bernstein’s “Mass” for the Seattle Opera.\n\nCryer appeared in movies “New York Stories,” “American Gigolo,” and “Escape from Alcatraz.” On television, he played roles on “Law and Order,” “Dallas,” and “Wonder Woman” (during which he notes he was lassoed by the woman), and appeared in soap operas “Where the Heart Is” and “As the World Turns\".\n\nRichard E. “Dick” Daugherty, born and raised in Findlay, began his entertainment career as a drum major for the Findlay High School band.\n\nFollowing graduation, he went to work at The Ohio Oil Company and later took military leave to volunteer for duty in the U. S. Coast Guard where he served aboard an anti-submarine convoy escort vessel for three years. Following World War II, he graduated from Miami University before returning to Findlay. He was hired by radio station WFIN, where he eventually became sales manager. He also hosted many programs on radio and local TV, including the WFIN morning show 'Coffee Time’ and longstanding Big Band Show.\n\nHe played drums for many years with the 'Moonlighters', a popular dance band. He was also Master of Ceremonies for the Findlay Civic Concert Band and Civic Jazz concerts at Riverside Park for 50 years. In 2004, a section of the park was dedicated in his honor and named Dick Daugherty Plaza.\n\nWatch the 2020 Wall of Fame Induction Ceremony with Mr. David A. Hanson HERE\n\nDavid A.

Under his direction, the concert band received acclaim at numerous invitational events, and was chosen to be on the Historic Roll of Honor of High School Bands of America.

The FLOC offered summer music programming for 25 years on the Central Auditorium stage, now the Marathon Center for the Performing Arts. The widely-enjoyed performances brought high-quality, fully-staged operetta and musical theater to the Findlay community, drawing large audiences, attracting talented outside performers, and providing opportunity for local talent to perform.\n\nBorn in Beaver Falls, Pa., Jack attended the Julliard School of Music for one year and earned a professional diploma in music performance.
