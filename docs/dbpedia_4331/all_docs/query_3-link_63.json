        "text": "Make a Gift in Memory or Honor\n\nGiving a gift to honor or memorialize someone you love(d), celebrate a loved one’s birthday or graduation, or commemorate a beloved pet is another way to give to BCHS. Honorees (or families of honorees) will receive a note from BCHS noting the gift but not including the amount, so please include contact information for the honoree.\n\nThe name can be inscribed on a plaque mounted on our Office & Adoption Center’s Memory Wall for certain levels of donations. Your donation will create a lasting tribute to your loved one and help extend the lives of animals in BCHS’s care. There are five* donation categories:\n\nAnimal Friends ($25 - $99 — acknowledged in newsletter and/or website only, as of 2022)\n\nAnimal Lovers ($100 - $499)\n\nAnimal Sponsors ($500 - $2499)\n\nAnimal Angels ($2500 - $4999)\n\nAnimal Heroes ($5000 and up)\n\nWhen an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.\n\nAll the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.\n\nThey all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.\n\nYou have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.\n\nThen you cross Rainbow Bridge together....\n\nAuthor unknown..."
