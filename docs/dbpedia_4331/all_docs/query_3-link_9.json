        "text": "Memorial to CIA employees\n\nNot to be confused with DIA Memorial Wall.\n\nThe Memorial Wall is a memorial at the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia.[1] It honors 140 CIA employees who died in service to their nation.[2]\n\nMemorial\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Memorial Wall is located in the Original Headquarters Building lobby on the north wall. There are 140 stars[2] carved into the white Alabama marble wall,[3] each one representing an employee who died in the line of service.[1] Paramilitary Operations Officers (PMOO) of the Special Activities Center comprise the majority of those memorialized.[4]\n\nA black Moroccan goatskin-bound book, called the \"Book of Honor\", sits in a steel frame beneath the stars, its \"slender case jutting out from the wall just below the field of stars\", and is \"framed in stainless steel and topped by an inch-thick plate of glass.\"[5] Inside it shows the stars, arranged by year of death and, when possible, lists the names of employees who died in CIA service alongside them.[1][5] The identities of the unnamed stars remain secret, even in death, though many names from the Cold War era have been released or uncovered in recent years.[1] In 1997, there were 70 stars, 29 of which had names.[5] There were 79 stars in 2002,[6] 83 in 2004,[7] 90 in 2009,[8] 107 in 2013,[9] 111 in 2014,[3] 125 in 2017,[10] 129 in 2018,[11] 133 in 2019,[12] 135 in 2020,[13] 137 in 2021,[14] 139 in 2022,[15] and 140 in 2023.[2] Of the 140 entries in the book in 2023, 106 are named, while 34 are not.[16] The 34 not named are represented only by a gold star followed by a blank space.[17][18]\n\nThe wall bears the inscription \"In honor of those members of the Central Intelligence Agency who gave their lives in the service of their country.\"[5] The wall is flanked by the flag of the United States on the left and a flag bearing the CIA seal on the right.[5]\n\nAdding new stars\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen new names are added to the Book of Honor, stone carver Tim Johnston of the Carving and Restoration Team in Manassas, Virginia adds a new star to the wall if that person's star is not already present.[1] Johnston learned the process of creating the stars from the original sculptor of the wall, Harold Vogel, who created the first 31 stars[7] and the Memorial Wall inscription when the wall was created in July 1974.[1] Although the wall was \"first conceived as a small plaque to recognize those from the CIA who died in Southeast Asia, the idea quickly grew to a memorial for Agency employees who died in the line of duty.\"[7] The process used by Johnston to add a new star is as follows:\n\nJohnston creates a star by first tracing the new star on the wall using a template. Each star measures 2¼ inches tall by 2¼ inches wide and half an inch deep; all the stars are six inches apart from each other, as are all the rows. Johnston uses both a pneumatic air hammer and a chisel to carve out the traced pattern. After he finishes carving the star, he cleans the dust and sprays the star black, which as the star ages, fades to gray.[1]\n\nThe Honor and Merit Awards Board (HMAB) recommends approval of candidates to be listed on the wall to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[1] The CIA states that\n\n[i]nclusion on the Memorial Wall is awarded posthumously to employees who lose their lives while serving their country in the field of intelligence. Death may occur in the foreign field or in the United States. Death must be of an inspirational or heroic character while in the performance of duty; or as the result of an act of terrorism while in the performance of duty; or as an act of premeditated violence targeted against an employee, motivated solely by that employee's Agency affiliation; or in the performance of duty while serving in areas of hostilities or other exceptionally hazardous conditions where the death is a direct result of such hostilities or hazards.[1] After approval by the director, the Office of Protocol arranges for a new star to be placed on the Wall.[1]\n\nThe first suicide to be added to the wall was for employee Ranya Abdelsayed, who died by suicide in 2013 after working for a year in Afghanistan. CIA leadership was criticized by some who feel she did not meet the criteria for the wall.[19]\n\nCurrent stars and known individuals\n\n[edit]\n\nDate of Death Name Cause of Death 1947 March 20, 1947 Lieutenant John W. Creech Killed when their plane crashed in bad weather while en route to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. They worked for the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the direct predecessor to CIA.[12][20] Daniel C. Dennett, Jr. 1950 April 29, 1950 Douglas Mackiernan The first CIA employee to be killed in the line of duty and the first star on the wall. Mackiernan had worked for the State Department in China since 1947. When the People's Republic of China was established at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the State Department ordered that the Tihwa (Ürümqi) consulate where Mackiernan was stationed as vice consul be closed, and personnel were to leave the country immediately. Mackiernan, however, was ordered to stay behind, destroy cryptographic equipment, monitor the situation, and aid anti-communist Nationalists. Mackiernan fled south toward India after most escape routes were cut off, along with Frank Bessac, an American Fulbright Scholar who was in Tihwa, and three White Russians. Although Mackiernan and his party survived the Taklamakan Desert and Himalayas, Mackiernan was shot by Tibetan border guards, probably because they mistook them as Communist infiltrators, on April 29, 1950.[21] 1951 January 11, 1951 Jerome P.
