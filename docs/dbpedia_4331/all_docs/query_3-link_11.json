        "text": "At 9:02 a.m., on a beautiful Wednesday morning 29 years ago, two individuals detonated a bomb inside a rental truck parked in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The U.S. Secret Service’s Oklahoma City Field Office was located in that building.\n\nThis act of domestic terrorism injured 650 people and caused the deaths of 168 men, women, and children, including six employees of the U.S. Secret Service’s Oklahoma City Field Office – those employees were Special Agent Cynthia Brown, Special Agent Donald Leonard, Special Agent Mickey Maroney, Office Manager Linda McKinney, Investigative Assistant Kathy Seidl and Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alan Whicher.\n\nMore than a third of the population of Oklahoma City knew someone either killed or injured in the bombing. As many as 190,000 people, 19 percent of the population of Oklahoma City, attended funerals for the victims.\n\nThe bomb damaged 347 buildings, impacting 20 blocks of downtown Oklahoma City which were cordoned off due to the extent of the bomb’s damage.\n\nSecret Service personnel throughout the United States responded in the aftermath to aid in the recovery, consoling, healing, and rebuilding.\n\nToday, the U.S. Secret Service Oklahoma City Field Office is located a few blocks south of the Murrah Federal Building site and the Oklahoma National Memorial."
