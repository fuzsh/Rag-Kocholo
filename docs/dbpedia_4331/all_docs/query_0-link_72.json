Please send comments or suggestions to Bob Inglis, COR Communications Chair.\n\nSpring 2010\n\nIn this issue:\n\nAn introduction to your new Regional Youth Rep\n\nA note on the OEF grant.\n\nSome information on Maple's Shop and Learn Nights\n\nEmily Lindsay of Rising Star reports on her riding experience in Spain\n\nWe salute Carolyn Russell-Poliquin who has won a scholarship to England\n\nA report on the April 10 Mini-meet in WOR\n\nSome thoughts on the H1N1 epidemic in Toronto and its hitherto unknown link to Nunavut\n\nMeet Your New Regional Youth Rep\n\nThe Central Ontario Regional Youth Rep for 2010 is Ali Sprague, who serves as Branch Youth Rep for the Kawartha Pony Club. Here's what Ali had to say in her nomination papers, to introduce herself.\n\nFor those of you who don't know me, I'm Ali Sprague from the Kawartha Pony Club. I have been a member of Kawartha for seven years and their Youth Rep for the last two. The opportunities for education, growth and friendship make me want to encourage others to do the same.\n\nMy background is mostly in dressage with my ten year old TB/QH mare, Kaya. I currently have my C Level and ride at First Level. We plan to start eventing this year to gain experience in different areas. I would also like to work toward my coaching licence. I really enjoy helping the younger members reach their goals both in education and riding. With that in mind, I would like to be COR's youth rep in order to reach out to other clubs.\n\nWe wish Ali well and look forward to her participation in this year's Regional Committee meetings.\n\nThank You, Ontario Equestrian Federation!\n\nCentral Ontario Region has received a grant of $1,820 from the Ontario Equestrian Federation. Thank you, OEF! And thank you, Karol Shipley, who put together the grant application.\n\nShop and Learn Nights at Greenhawk\n\nHighly educational, though not a part of the formal COR program, has been a series of \"Shop and Learn\" nights organized by the Maple Pony Club and held at a local Greenhawk store. These proved popular, not least because Greenhawk offered a discount to Pony Club members attending these mini-workshops. Here is a brief report from Mike Stephenson, Maple's DC, on the second one.\n\nHi everyone....what a fabulous turn out this evening...the Pony Clubbers came out in force to support our second Greenhawk Education and Barn Night.\n\nSo how successful was it?\n\nWell we had 51 members and parents....My count is not perfect on the breakdown, but I estimate that there were eight from TNY, seven from King, 20 from Maple, five from Rising Star, seven from Centaurus, three from Whitchurch and one from Uxbridge....I apologize if I did not get that count exactly right...not everyone put their club's name on the sign-in sheet...but suffice to say, it was a great turn out.\n\nThanks to Katie Stephenson who held a D2 Testing prep session, Kyra Holmes who held a very popular bandaging session and Emily Mitchell who held a D, D1 level Quiz Visuals session. Thanks to all three of you....I think all of the club members got a lot out of your lessons and I saw many parents in the shadows as you went along...clearly they were interested in learning as was I.\n\nThe Rain in Spain ...\n\nHow would you like to take some time off from (a) school and (b) winter, to go riding in Spain? What's that? Some of you could tolerate it? Well, that's exactly what happened to Rising Star Pony Club member Emily Lindsay. Here is her account of what most of us - or at least those of us who can ride - would count as a dream trip.\n\nI am on a student exchange program in Seville, Spain, organized through ISE (International Student Exchange). They come to the school to talk about the program. Most kids go on this exchange in grade 10 but there are some that go in grade 8 right through to grade 11. I left Canada on February 12th ( first day of the Olympics) right after second semester started. I have worked with my teachers and am doing school work while I am over here. Some of my classes are the same here as at home, like gym and commtech. As part of the exchange we had a girl come and stay at our place for three months as well. Some of you might remember seeing her as she came to Banquet with me. Her name is Belen, I am staying with her family now, just outside of Seville.\n\nThe country is beautiful and so are the horses. The horses are very well trained - the school horses can do first level dressage (pc). In some parts of the city people offer horse and carriage ride to the public. We got to see the centre of the city in a horse drawn buggy, it was amazing. Over here dressage is the main discipline, but they also do show jumping and endurance; I have yet to see ANY eventers. I am taking lesson over here, they are very different from home. The barn is very big, it has over 40 horses all in box stalls (there is no turn out for the horses). My favorite horse here is Etiope (he is one in the pic). He is a TB cross. Most of the School horses are cross breeds just like at home. There are some Andalusians but not in the lesson barn. The style taught is different. My coach believes that every horse should wear a curb bit, even if they do not need it. The lesson reminds me of a trail ride. Whatever the horse in the lead does the rest just follow. All the horses side pass and leg yield pretty much on their own. At first look you would think the riders are fairly advanced as the horses all go around in frame. But then I found out with the big bits in it is just a false frame to kept the kids from pulling on their mouths. The horses don't jump much here, hopefully next week I will get to jump bigger then 12\".\n\nIn Spain there is so much to see and do, if you like old Roman architecture some of the buildings are amazing. We saw a book from the 1600s in one of the churches - really cool. We even went to the beach in Portugal last week. Very different then anything I have ever seen before. Spain would be an awesome place to go for a vacation. Next week is a huge celebration in Seville called \"La Faria\"... Everyone dresses up in traditional clothing, including the horses. I think it is going to be amazing to see. I have only seen pictures and the horses have flowers on their bridles.\n\nI arrive back home on May 7th... Just in time for the first PPG meet. Can't wait to get home and start practicing PPG's again.\n\nOshawa Pony Club Member Wins Scholarship to University in England\n\nCarolyn Russell-Poliquin, a proud C level member of the Oshawa Pony Club (who just received her ten year membership award from National), has been accepted at the University of Western England, Hartpury College, to study Equine Sport Science starting this September. Hartpury College has an elite athlete program for dressage, showjumping, and eventing, AND Carolyn had just been offered a spot on the Hartpury Equine Academy for elite dressage riders. This is a huge accomplishment for her and her horse, Cornucopia.(aka Corbin). They were the 2008 second level provincial junior champions, rode the FEI JUNIOR level in 2009, and are schooling fourth level movements now. They have been recognized by Dressage Canada with Achievement awards in 2008 and 2009 for second and third levels. She was recognized by COR with year end championships several times in the past four years. She is representing COR at this year's National Dressage Championships in BC, and then will be off to England with her horse to study and train. Well done, Carolyn!\n\nWOR Tetrathlon Mini-Meet\n\nHere is a report forwarded to me by Helaina Rothenberg of Centaurus, on behalf of Rhonda Hutcheson. Thank you, Centaurus!\n\nOn Saturday, April 10th, five members of the local Centaurus Pony Club attended a Western Ontario Region Tetrathlon mini-meet hosted by Headwaters Pony Club in Orangeville. The sport of Tetrathlon includes pistol shooting, swimming, cross country running, and horseback riding. As a pre-season tune-up, this meet did not include the horseback phase.\n\nAlyson Weedon placed second overall in the Novice B division, her strongest event being the running.\n\nThe Novice division was the largest division of the day, and Rebecca McDowell, Patricia Rothenburg and Andie Munro demonstrated the Club's consistency by placing seventh, eighth and ninth respectively. Munro's strongest phase was swimming, while Rothenburg and McDowell tied for second in the division for the running phase.\n\nNicole McDowell placed fifth in the Green Junior division, with an impressive result in the shooting phase. That's Nicole running in the picture to your left. This was the first time any of the girls had competed in shooting.\n\nSome Thoughts on the H1N1 Epidemic in Toronto\n\nLast Fall, just after putting out the Fall 2009 edition of CORBits, Your Humble Editor got sick. It may or may not have been the H1N1 flu, but if it was, there was no help available for it, at least in Toronto. On one of his rare excursions out of his sick bed, Yr. Hmbl. Ed. dashed off an e-mail about the situation to his Virginia relatives. Some of them forwarded it to their friends, and some were kind enough to suggest that it should have a wider audience. Since you, gentle readers, are the only wider audience to which I have access, and since we are a bit short of material this edition, here is an abridged version for your amusement (hopefully).\n\nLiz says she has let you know I have some kind of bug. We don't really know what I have, just what I don't have. I don't have the regular flu, because we have had our shots for that. And we are really hoping it's not the H1N1 flu, the so-called Swine Flu, because that is potentially much more serious, and also because our various governments have seriously dropped the ball on getting the vaccine for it out to the public.\n\nFirst, the federal government decided to sole-source the vaccine, and when you sole-source anything you really, really need, production problems follow as surely as night follows day.\n\nSecond, the local Toronto government decided to distribute the vaccine only through central clinics, not in workplaces, schools and family doctors' offices, as they had done successfully with regular flu vaccine for decades.\n\nA few days before the first clinics were due to open, a healthy young 13 year old hockey player began feeling ill near the end of his game, and he was dead before morning from H1N1. This was headline news and caused a panic across the country, including, it seems, among the organizers. They decided to open a limited number of clinics early, and asked that only those in high priority groups go to them. In Toronto itself, with a population approaching three million, they opened two (2) clinics, which were promptly overwhelmed. Gosh! who could have seen that coming? And because they opened up before they were ready, they had neither the staff nor the vaccine supply to deal with the rush. People were lining up for four hours in the rain before the clinics opened, only to be told to go home ten minutes after the opening because there was only enough vaccine to get to some point far ahead of them in the line. Now, I might line up for four hours for a vaccine that I knew would save me from otherwise certain death, or for front row seats at the Second Coming, but nothing less. And if I had lined up for four hours in the rain with my pre-schoolers, and then got sent home, I would be tempted to come back with a \"Close-Shave-On-U\" do it yourself guillotine kit (some assembly required; tumbrel sold separately).\n\nThey did eventually open more clinics, but still could not keep up with the demand. So the next step was to make sure those in line fell into one of the high priority groups and send all others away. It turned out, however, that there were different definitions of \"high priority\" depending on who you were. Everyone agreed and accepted that health-care workers had to have the vaccine first of all. They have to be able to look after the rest of us if this turns into a real pandemic. But members of hospitals' Boards of Directors, who venture into the administrative wing of a hospital about once a quarter and never get near a patient? Hmm. Not so good. Then it turned out that vaccine was being diverted from Canadian clinics to give to Taliban prisoners of war in Afghanistan. Okay, as signatories to the Geneva Convention, we are honour bound to look after the health of our POWs, but surely they could have come a little lower on the priority list. We have not yet vaccinated our troops!\n\nThe argument used there was that the POWs were in crowded conditions and people in close proximity are vulnerable to a quick spread of the disease. Well, once that argument came out it spread like wildfire. Inmates in prisons got vaccinated. Members of professional sports teams got vaccinated, including the Maple Leafs and the Raptors. Now we have officials at private boarding schools saying that their pupils should come before the general public because they live so close together. The jury's still out on that one, but the government may listen! The people who make the priority decisions have probably not done their own grocery shopping for years, though some of them may have children in private boarding schools.\n\nThe Federal Minister of Health in particular is ill-equipped to understand crowding, not only because her current position means that she travels around Ottawa in a chauffeured limousine, and around the country by private jet, but also because of her background. She is an Innu from Nunavut. The Innuit are the people we used to call Eskimos, but they don't like that term anymore. And Nunavut used to be the Eastern part of the Northwest Territories, but got split off about ten years ago. The first thing you need to know about Nunavut is that it's enormous - over 800,000 square miles, slightly bigger than Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy put together, with Andorra, Liechenstein, Luxembourg and Monaco sprinkled on top for garnish. And scattered over that vast territory is a total population of 29,500 people - about one for every 27 1/2 square miles. They couldn't infect each other by telegram up there! What the heck could the poor Minister of Health know about crowding? Crowding in Nunavut is when you can see a tiny dot on the far horizon that might possibly turn out to be another person (of course, it also might possibly turn out to be a polar bear, so most of the time you don't stick around to find out). If she wants to understand crowding, the Minister of Health should go to the Bloor-Yonge subway station here in Toronto, where the main east-west line intersects the main north-south line, any weekday morning. There, every two minutes, she would see a number of people roughly equivalent to the entire population of Nunavut get off one train and onto another, and be replaced on their original train by about the same number. There they sit and stand, packed in like sardines, half of them sneezing and the other half coughing. The people who make decisions about crowding should have to hold their meetings on one of those trains.\n\nBy the way, speaking of dropped balls and Nunavut, here's another one that might interest you. The territorial capitol of Nunavut is a village called Iqaluit. Notice there is no \"u\" after the \"q\", a construction alien to both of Canada's official languages. But it is important to leave it out, because Iqaluit, without the \"u\", translates as \"place with many fishes\", whereas iqualuit, with the \"u\", means \"one who does not properly wipe his bottom\". The Prime Minister's Office accidentally included the \"u\" in some press release not long ago, the Nunavut press shared the joke with their southern colleagues and of course our newspapers were all over it and the whole country had a good laugh. The really silly thing is that Inuktitut, the Innuit language, has its own alphabet and doesn't use our Roman letters at all. So why the capitol's name could not have been rendered as \"Ikaluit\", leaving the \"qu\" version for the Great Unwiped, I shall never know. My guess is that decision needed months of deliberation by a committee of highly paid bureaucrats and consultants (all of whom have already had their H1N1 shots). But I digress.\n\nI am very unhappy about being sick. But I am trying to keep my sense of humour up, and not show bitterness. If what I have does turn out to be H1N1 and it kills me, then I might allow myself some bitterness. I don't think that's going to happen because (a) I seem to be feeling a bit better every day, and (b) I have had no urge to oink. If it does, however, my fall-back plan calls for some serious haunting. Those bungling bureaucrats and me-first line-jumpers shall smart for their sins! I shall pursue them through their dreams to the end of their days, wielding a gigantic made-for-use-on-brontosauruses hypodermic needle, which I shall plunge dozens of times a night into their improperly-wiped bottoms.\n\nOf course, I do have to end on a serious note. While the situation in Toronto has been badly handled, our system does have one saving grace. In time, all Canadians who want to be vaccinated against H1N1 will get their shots, free of charge - not just those with private medical insurance or the means to pay for the vaccination at steep rates.\n\nYour humble editor is pleased to report that the H1N1 did not carry him off, and he is still on the right side of the grass.\n\nComments and criticisms are welcome, letters to the Editor are invited and news of your activities is really needed for the next issue.\n\nHave a great summer!\n\nFall 2009\n\nYour 2010 Regional Officers and Chairs\n\nAt the Central Ontario Annual General Meeting on Saturday, November 21, the following people were elected or acclaimed.\n\nRegional Chair/National Director - Sue Foell (Regional Chair has a two year term, while all the others are for one year; Sue is starting her second year)\n\nRegional Vice Chair - Laurie Blake\n\nRegional Assistant Chair - OPEN (this is meant to be occupied by someone from one of the northern Branches, to make sure they are represented at the highest level)\n\nTreasurer - Marg O'Neill\n\nAssistant Treasurer - Karol Shipley\n\nSecretary - Debbie Baker\n\nMembership Secretary - Maisie Durward\n\nActive Member Rep(s) - To be determined by vote of the Branch Active Members if more than two nominations received\n\nOEF Association Rep - Karol Shipley\n\nCommunications Chair - Bob Inglis\n\nCommunications Assistant: CORCOMMs - Bill Murray\n\nCommunications Assistant: Website - Teri Lindsay\n\nEducation Chair - Christy Barnes\n\nEducation Assistant Chair - Katie Stephenson\n\nQuiz Chair - Sally Chamney\n\nQuiz Assistant Chair - Margie Kenedy\n\nTesting Chair - Gwen Barnes\n\nTesting Assistant Chair - OPEN\n\nDressage Chair - Bev Rice\n\nDressage Assistant Chair - Marie Howran\n\nPPG/Games Chair - Debbie Davies\n\nPPG/Games Assistant Chair - OPEN\n\nRally Chair - Mike Stephenson\n\nRally Assistant Chair: D Rally - Daina Strickland\n\nRally Assistant Chair: Working Rally - Education Committe\n\nShow Jumping Chair - Teri Lindsay\n\nShow Jumping Assistant Chair - Heather Lane\n\nLe Trec Chair - Brenda Rowe\n\nLe Trec Assistant Chair - OPEN\n\nTetrathlon Chair - OPEN\n\nTetrathlon Assistant Chair - OPEN\n\nProperties Chair - Debbie Davies\n\nProperties Assistant Chair - Debbie Baker\n\nVisiting Commissioners - Nancy Codlin, Barbara Grimm, Bill Murray, Marg O'Neill and Karol Shipley\n\nThere are two points to be made about the above list. First, it is meant to let you know whom to pester about what. And second, please note how many people are doing more than one job, and how many jobs are open. Apparently there have been some complaints heard about our slimmer than usual 2009 program of activities, but the reason the program was slimmer is that the number of people available to help out was smaller. Everyone is busy, but we hope everyone will also try to help COR in whatever way they can. And if they can't help at all, then we hope they don't spend a lot of energy complaining - energy that might have been better spent doing. Here endeth the first rant.\n\nReport from National Quiz By Kyra Holmes and Katherine Earle\n\nNational Quiz was held in the lovely city of Vancouver this year. We were on a combined AB team with BCLM. Team A5, as it was called, consisted of two Quiz veterans and two Quiz newbie's, which was a great match. Casey Leroux, the Western Canada Youth Rep and Amanda Brooke were on our team. Katherine's mom, Tina, was our awesome chaperone this year.\n\nSaturday morning was the written test. Almost every competitor agreed that this year's test was a fair yet tough challenge. There were lots of questions on anatomy, nutrition, and barn building specifics. The afternoon had the games, which was a lot of fun, as always!\n\nSaturday night we were taken on a lovely boat cruise of Vancouver Harbour. This was probably the best possible way to see the city, and it was a lot of fun! We saw the famous Seawall in Stanley Park, the Olympic Village, Granville Island, where we would go on Sunday, and the Science Dome. The weather was fantastic, with no hint of rain, and with the scene of the mountains and the city skyscrapers, it was certainly an impressive view!\n\nSunday morning we had the I.D. portion. It went quite well, with Katherine achieving one of the only perfect scores of 15 at a table. There was a large variety of items this year, and it was all balanced out.\n\nSunday Afternoon we went to Granville Island, a marketplace on the waterfront. We spend almost two hours there, and that was not nearly enough time! there was so much to see, including the cheese market, the Emily Carr Institute, which is an art school, the various street performers, the arcade, the candy stores, the toy stores there was just so much stuff!\n\nAt the end of the day, we had the Awards Banquet. Team A5 had a great team placing of 6th, and Kyra was 2nd individually. Katherine did not place in the ribbons, but we were all very proud of her score considering it was her first time at National Quiz and she had to go as an AB!\n\nThis year was a lovely year, and we are both looking forward to qualifying to go to National Quiz in Halifax in 2010, in conjunction with International Quiz. We both encourage every club to send as many kids as they can to Regional Quiz, because the opportunity to compete all over Canada is amazing! Thanks to everyone who made it happen!!\n\nRiding With Royalty\n\nThis November 6, nine Central Ontario Pony Club members had a once in a lifetime opportunity to assist Their Royal Highnesses, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, at the opening of the Royal Winter Fair. Along with Pony Clubbers from the Western Ontario and Saint Lawrence-Ottawa Valley Regions, they provided a ceremonial guard of honour.\n\nFrom left to right in the picture, Sarah Cowie of the King Pony Club (rider), Rebecca Simmons of the Durham Pony Club (rider), Emily Lindsay of the Rising Star Pony Club (rider), Kayla Weber of Rising Star (groom), Karen Foell of the Toronto & North York Pony Club (groom), Jenna Meeser of Rising Star (groom), Meaghan Lloyd of Durham (groom), Jennifer McKeen of the Oshawa Pony Club (rider), Laura Austin of the Kawartha Pony Club (rider) and Shelby Heinbuch of the United Counties Pony Club in SLOV (rider). Standing in front of all of them is J.P. (pony).\n\nMs. Heinbuch, by the way, was NOT showing at the Royal anyway. She trailered her pony all the way from the Ottawa area just for the opening ceremony, then took him home again. Who says Canadians are no longer interested in the monarchy?\n\nYour Humble Editor was not a member of the selection committee, but he understands that there were many strong applications, and that the selection committee had a hard time choosing the lucky nine.\n\nYr. Hmbl. Ed. has also heard a rumour that the acceptance e-mails prompted much squealing and running in circles. And that was just the Moms!\n\nFinally, we hear from Gayle McPherson, President of the Royal Winter Fair and one of the newest Honourary Life Members of the Canadian Pony Club, that the Royal couple were quite complimentary about how well all the Pony Clubbers and their mounts were turned out. Congratulations to all from Y.H.E., and haven't you got something to tell your grandchildren about!\n\nCanadian Pony Club Awards/Honours\n\nYear-end awards are always an important part of any Fall issue of CORBits. Before we get to our Central Ontario awards, however, it is a pleasure to report that several Central Ontario members have been honoured by the national organization this year.\n\nOne Active Member and one Affiliate Member received Sandra Sillcox Memorial Awards. They were Christy Chamney of the Maple Pony Club and Katie Stephenson, formerly of Maple and now an Affiliate.\n\nKatie and her Dad Michael also accepted the award for the top showing in the Ride for 75 program, on behalf of Maple. (Durham, Rising Star, Uxbridge-Scugog and Kawartha also finished in the top ten Branches, making it five from Central Ontario and five from the rest of Canada - well done all!)\n\nGayle McPherson, President of the Royal Winter Fair, was made an Honourary Life Member. We have Ms. McPherson to thank for all those Royal tickets we get every year (and also, we suspect, for the Riding With Royalty opportunity). At right we have Ms. McPherson introducing Prince Charles at the opening ceremonies for the Royal.\n\nKyra Holmes of Maple was chosen to be Youth Director on the National Board, representing Eastern Canada.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Karol Shipley, former Central Ontario Regional Chair, received the Canadian Pony Club Chairman's Award for her efforts as Chair of the 75th Anniversary Committee.\n\nCentral Ontario Region Year-End Awards\n\nDressage\n\nEntry - Champion was Solstice Pecile of Kawartha, with Samantha Lobbezoo of Brooklin the Reserve.\n\nStarter - Champion was Meg Scott of Victoria, with Emily Pearson, also of Victoria, the Reserve.

There was a tie for Reserve between Jennifer McKeen of Oshawa and Emily Lindsay of Rising Star.\n\nPrince Philip/Masters Games\n\nChampionship ribbons were actually presented after the final meet in July rather than at the banquet, and the exploits of our A and Masters teams have been reported in previous issues, but it is still appropriate to honour the winning teams here.\n\nAt the A level, a combined Uxbridge-Scugog/Simcoe team won the Regional championship. The members of this team were James Cruikshanks, Crystal Geer, Jane Stephenson, Emily Stubbings and Rachel Stewart (Simcoe).\n\nIn the Masters competition, Uxbridge-Scugog also finished on top, with a team comprising Kendra Abbey, Mori Cruikshanks, Sean Cruikshanks, Jesse Durward and Samantha Macdonald.\n\nThe Durham Pony Club team took the honours at the B level. Team members were Kaisha Barber, Jake Durack, Jessica Rowe, Michelle Treen and Sarah Treen.\n\nAt the C level, Temiskaming was first, with a team including Reid Archambault, Spencer Brisson, Kiara Crawford, Ashley Maille and Lynnsey St. Louis.\n\nQuiz\n\nAs noted earlier in this edition, Kyra Holmes of Maple was the leading A/B competitor at our Regional Quiz, with Katherine Earle of Ajax the top C, and off they went to National Quiz in Vancouver. Emma Lemay-Nedjelski of Ajax was the top D2 individual.\n\nIn team competition, Maple won at the A/B level, Ajax took the honours at all of the C, D2 and D levels, while Durham was the D1 Champion. Centaurus won the project competition.\n\nChair's Award\n\nThe winner of this prestigious award for 2009 was Daina Strickland, for her work in reviving D Rally.\n\nWelsh Pony and Cob High Point Award Program\n\nThis program comprises two awards, one to a purebred Welsh and one to a half Welsh. The purebred Welsh winner for 2009 was Sec. D Welsh Cob Stonecroft Geraint ap Dilwyn (a.k.a. Winston) owned by Lisa Hossack Scott and ridden by Janene Howran of Kawartha Pony Club. Winston and Janene were partnered in Dressage, at the First level, in Central Ontario Pony Club as well as at Bronze level Dressage shows. The half Welsh champion was Wabi Brook Tarragon, owned by Emily Lindsay, ridden by Olivia Gionet in Show Jumping and by Emily in the A level and by Jaide Johnson at the C Level, Prince Philip Games.\n\nStillwoods Farm Award\n\nNot awarded this year.\n\nRoyal China Memorial Award\n\nThis year the award went to In the Ribbons, who belongs to Jenna Meeser of the Rising Star Pony Club. Here is the nomination that won \"Ribbons\" the award.\n\nMy ponys name is In the Ribbons, but at home, we just call her Ribbons. She is a beautiful 14HH bay pinto mare who has really helped me grow as a rider. I didnt learn to ride until I was 14, so I was a little older than the average rider when I started out.\n\nMy family purchased Ribbons back in March of 2007. This pony has helped me to try a lot of new things and made me more confident. Everything I learned about riding, I learned on her. My first dressage test I ever rode was on her in the Starter level, which we placed 3rd on my Starter test 2. At the end of 2007, I was fourth overall for the Starter division. Last year I went to two dressage qualifiers and competed at the pre-training level, where we finished 6th overall for the year.\n\nAlong with dressage, I tried some eventing outside of pony club, which Ribbons was not a huge fan of, but she still did it, because I asked her. She is a very obedient pony.\n\nLast year I tried Show Jumping with her and absolutely loved it. We did our best and even with it being our first year, we came out with pretty good results. The first time we went we got a 5th in Table A, 2nd in Power and Speed and 4th in Equitation. After that I went to the other two qualifiers, but I was unable to attend finals. Still, luckily, I ended up fourth overall for the Entry division at banquet.\n\nThis year was especially fun because we tried PPGs for the first time together. The year before I borrowed a pony from our DC, but this year I wanted to see if she would be good at it. Plus, if I was going to do PPGs, I had to do the Masters level, which many people know is the hardest so I was nervous. To my surprise she was amazing. Usually she is a little cautious of new things, but she took to PPGs like a fish to water. I still couldnt believe that she liked it so much, so we had an animal communicator come out and talk to her. She said that Ribbons runs really fast, not because she is scared, but because she is having fun! I thought that was funny and could relate to how fast she went and how she didnt want to stop I thought it was fear of the props, but apparently it was joy.\n\nThis year we have also had a lot of great results with Show Jumping. At all of the qualifiers I have been champion and I am really proud to own such an outstanding pony. It is her hard work that got us there. We now have a very strong connection and I trust my pony beyond belief. My moms friend has little children who love to go for pony rides. Her oldest daughter has just turned 5 and she is determined to ride all by herself this summer and she wants to do it on Ribbons. I have full faith in her and I know she fills their little hearts with happiness.\n\nOne of my favourite days with Ribbons was when I entered her in our local fair for the western games. She earned a ribbon in the egg stomp, which was a lot of fun. We were just out of the ribbons in the musical stalls game, and we gave everyone there a good laugh. There was my Ribbons pony cantering around the ring in collection, her head in a pretty frame, while we competed against all of the western quarter horses who were going a million miles an hour. There was no question who the dressage horse was out there, she just looked so cute!\n\nOutside of shows and riding, Ribbons is a character in our barn. She is the first one to nicker hello to you in the morning when you come outside, and she has been a second Mom to our little companion pony we bought to keep her company. Ribbons always lets the other horses know when meals are almost ready, with her steady neighing and nickering from her stall. She is sassy, and can sometimes be a bit bossy, but she is also the cuddliest pony in the world when she wants to be. Ribbons has no trouble letting you know what she likes. She even lets me die her tail to be pretty for a show, or just for fun! I absolutely love her!\n\nUnfortunately, I am outgrowing my wonderful talented pony which breaks my heart. She was the first pony that I have ever shown with and tried new things like dressage, eventing, show jumping and PPGs. We are at the point where we have to decide what is best for her, whether it be staying with us, or finding a new home where some other new rider can experience the wonderful things she has to offer. I sincerely hope that you will consider Ribbons for the Royal China Memorial award. Ribbons is a brave, helpful, loving and reliable pony, which are all attributes that I believe make her a remarkable pony!\n\n~Jenna Meeser, Rising Star Pony Club~\n\nKaren Meuleman Award\n\nKaren Meuleman was a member of the Leitchcroft Pony Club branch who was part of a severe motor accident on her way to enter a dressage show in March 1989. This memorial award was created by the Leitchcroft Pony Club branch in memory of Karen. As the branch is now retired, due to the sale of the property known as Leitchcroft Farm, the branch has given the award to the Central Ontario Region.\n\nRecipients of the award can be of any level within Pony Club and from any branch within the Region. The winner will be a member who best meets the ideals of Pony Club in his/her participation in activities, sportsmanship and effort, support of others and progress in riding and horsemanship during the current year. There is a trophy that remains with the Region with a plate with the winner's name engraved upon it. The winner is presented with a commemorative gift and an award card.\n\nThis year's winner is Taylor Ryan of the Whitchurch Pony Club. Her nomination form read as follows.\n\nAt Whitchurch Pony Club, Taylor Ryan is Pony Club. She exemplifies all the Pony Club ideals of sportsmanship, encouragement and attitude. She is a leader at WPC. Having joined the club five years ago, Taylor has faithfully attended all activities. In fact, I think she has a 100% attendance record over those five years! However, it's not about the attendance; it's about the attitude.\n\nTaylor is currently our most senior member. Over the past two years she has taken an active role in mentoring the younger members of the club. As a barn-based club almost 100% of our members ride out of Whitchurch Riding Academy. Taylor can be found on most weekends cheerfully going about her barn duties and all the while encouraging younger members in their flat work, their jumping and in their horsemanship. At every event, Taylor takes an active leadership role. When competing, she cheers on each WPC member even if they are competing against her. If they win, she cheers loudly, if they do not, Taylor always finds something positive in what they've done and points out their accomplishment not only to the rider but to the entire club. Her encouragement has made many a discouraged rider feel better about themselves and their abilities.\n\nThis past year Taylor organized and led two clinics for members that resulted in our members obtaining two badges: Barn Safety and Handling and Grooming. She has organized games nights for our members, supported them in their riding goals and constantly encourages riders to join the pony club.\n\nLast Christmas Taylor organized a barn night at Greenhawk and coordinated the event by sending out reminders, putting up sign up sheets and following up with all members on their attendance and the benefits of going as a group. In total over 30 members and parents attended the event.\n\nTaylor has participated in many Pony Club disciplines including dressage, jumping, rally, and quiz. At these events Taylor supports those competing with and against her from the other Pony Clubs. As well, she helps younger members prepare teaching them how to groom, how to braid, and most importantly how to tame the butterflies in their stomachs!\n\nLast year Taylor finished 6th overall in the Entry Division on Sammy's Girl. At the start of this season Taylor put together a personal plan for her riding. She decided to focus on jumping at the Starter level. This season Taylor participated in two of the three qualifiers and was eligible for the Show Jumping Finals. At Finals she finished as Champion! Interestingly, the first thing Taylor said when she received her trophy was 'This is going to look great in the Pony Club lounge; it belongs to all of us'. (As a barn based club, we have a lounge at Whitchurch Riding Academy). The entire WPC was thrilled to see her achieve her personal goal. We know that Taylor will make everyone at the club feel as if they were a part of her accomplishment.\n\nWe're nominating Taylor because of her enthusiasm, her love of the horse and her support of her fellow riders to both in and outside of her own pony club. To us, Taylor Ryan is Pony Club!\n\nThank you for considering our nomination.\n\nElizabeth Brims, District Commissioner, Whitchurch Pony Club\n\nPeople Who Make A Difference Award\n\nThis is actually an Ontario Equestrian Federation Award, presented at the OEF Annual Banquet. COR gets to nominate one person per year, and this year the award went to Bill Murray. Congratulations to Bill!\n\nIn closing, Your Humble Editor would like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, Ecstatic Eid, Delirious Diwali, Karefree Kwanzaa, Sensational Saturnalia, and All-the-Best to Anyone-I've-Accidentally-Left-Out\n\nSummer 2009\n\nWe don't always publish a Summer CORBits, but we have lots of material this year, so here goes.\n\nPony Club Cross-Country Clinic\n\nMost Pony Club news is about competition - show jumping, dressage, Prince Philip Games, tetrathlon and rallies (not to overlook quiz). But some people may not know that education is an equally important part of Pony Club. Each Pony Club Branch has study sessions to go along with the youngsters' lessons and coaching, and most Regions offer educational clinics on a variety of topics. As D Rally approaches, the first experience with cross-country courses for many of the young riders, the Central Ontario Region tried to help prepare them by organizing a clinic with well-known eventer Jessica Phoenix. Christy Barnes, Central Ontario Education Chair, sends this report, which has also appeared in \"English Rider\".\n\n\"After many weather-related delays, Jessica Phoenix finally met our Central Ontario Region riders July 17th. Jessica invited us in and looked after us in style, with even her mother and grandmother helping out on the barbeque. Ten riders from the Maple, Uxbridge-Scugog, Toronto & North York, and Rising Star branches rode, each with their own goals, problems and expectations. While the day started off hot and sunny, the last group of the day rode under threat of a downpour and spectators collected sweaters and rain jackets, just in case.\n\n\"For some, the day would have been positive without jumping a fence, since the chance to get up close and personal with a cow doesn't come every day, but Jessica quickly focused on each rider's weaknesses. She encouraged every rider to affect their horse's way of going in some way - to go forward, to relax, to balance, or to slow down and each horse improved! One or two horses had to be gently reminded that a jump was for jumping over, not for looking at; one pony had to learn that stopping after a jump is much better than \"barrelling\" on to the next one! Jessica first built up the skills to use, then confidence by introducing each exercise in small steps.\n\n\"Thanks Jessica for spending the afternoon with us!\n\nAbove we see Jacob Daniels of the Uxbridge-Scugog Pony Club riding Cricket. Cricket seems to regard the little drop with quite a bit of suspicion, but Jacob eventually did get him to go forward.\n\nAs a footnote, four of the kids who took part in this clinic also rode in D-Rally, and none of them had any jumping faults on the cross-country phase. All completed it safely, which is the main thing, and two went completely clear - only minor time faults for the other two.\n\nMany thanks to everyone who sent me photos of this clinic after \"English Rider\" asked for some. This one was by Daina Strickland, an Uxbridge-Scugog Mom.\n\nNational Dressage Championships\n\nCOR riders covered themselves with glory at the National Dressage Championships held in Salmon River, Nova Scotia, August 14-16. The 2008 National Dressage Competition was not held last year; therefore the 2007 and 2008 provincial champions were invited to the 2009 Competition to vie for their respective national titles. Unless otherwise noted, all these placings are among 2008 qualifiers. Here is the tally.\n\n- Janene Howran of the Kawartha Pony Club was 2007 group Champion in the Pre-Training Division\n\n- Devon Cassel lof the Springwater Pony Club was Champion of the Starter Division\n\n- Johanna McKeen of the Oshawa Pony Club was Reserve Champion in the Second Level competition, the highest level offered\n\n- Jennifer McKeen, also of Oshawa, was Reserve Champion in the Training Division.\n\n- Meaghan Lloyd of the Durham Pony Club was seventh in First Level\n\n- Tara Chiasson of the Simcoe Pony Club was eighth in Pre-Training.\n\nWell done, all. And again, many thanks to those who sent me photos when I asked for them to go along with press releases to the local newspapers covering these Branches, especially to Theresa Cruschieri, who downloaded extra software to get some still from her camcorder. This picture of our COR representatives, though, was sent by Patrick Foote of the Nova Scotia Region.\n\nNational Show Jumping Championships\n\nHere is a report from Kyra Holmes of the Maple Pony Club, who represented Central Ontario at the National Show Jumping Championships.\n\nThis year National Show Jumping Medal Finals were held in Winnipeg, Manitoba at the lovely Birds Hill Provincial Park.\n\nThursday, for the horse draw, the owners rode all of the horses, and riders were asked to pick one out from the group. There were about 20 horses brought in for 15 riders. I rode with a lovely pony named Chip, who was about 14 hands and a piebald. All the riders were in the same boat, with local members riding borrowed horses as well.\n\nFriday morning we went back to the barns at Birds Hill, braided all of the horses and got ready for the flat ride. Chip and I had a nice flat ride, and I was happy with the result. We rode the gymnastics after lunch, and I was pleased with our ride. That night all the pony clubbers went to Assiniboia Downs, the thoroughbred track in Winnipeg. Canadian Pony Club sponsored the fourth race of the evening, so all 15 riders got to go into the winners circle to watch the race, and then we met the winning jockey.\n\nSaturday morning we got ready for the medal round. Chip and I had a great ride and we moved up to sixth place, just out of the top four, but I was very happy with that placing. After lunch the top four did the switch, and the results were held until the banquet, to keep us all guessing!\n\nThat night we had a banquet, where they gave out all the ribbons and thanked everyone. What a wonderful weekend, and I couldn't have asked for a better time!\n\nD-Rally Returns and Maple Represents COR at ABC rally\n\nKatie Stephenson sends this report.\n\nAfter a year long hiatus, D Rally has returned!!!!! On Sunday August 9th, 28 Pony Clubbers, their mounts, grooms and of course some fantabulous volunteers gathered at Foggy River in Mount Albert for a day of fun in the sun ... and in the rain. Despite the hour long hold that occurred due to electrical storms (even the gods just couldn't hold in their excitement that D rally was back!) the day could not be deemed anything but a success. Thanks to the new format of the rally, the day included some Pony Clubbers that would otherwise not have been able to take part as riders. I have to say, seeing nine ponies and riders warming up for their Cross Country was one of the cutest things I have ever seen! And the smiles on the riders faces as they crossed the finish line is, in my opinion, what Pony Club is supposed to be all about. Hopefully the happy smiles and the fun that was had will bring out greater numbers next year.\n\n(Photo by Jayme Holmes of the Maple Pony Club)\n\nThe D's aren't the only ones who have had some rally fun this month. The weekend of August 14th-16th heralded the date of the WOR/COR ABC rally. Or, as it turned out, the WOR/Maple ABC rally. I will come out right now and admit that I went strictly as a spectator. Which was nice since this is the first Rally I have been to that I got to shower at the half way mark. But I digress. Despite the loneliness that Maple felt being the sole CORians at Checkmate, they trudged forward to have one heck of a weekend! Now Maple does have a reputation - we are known as loud and can seem a bit obnoxious when out in large numbers, but as a completely biased party, I think we are also brimming with sportsmanship. This weekend was no different. They cheered and laughed the loudest but they also worked the hardest. While that last one can't be proven, the fact that our grooms walked away with three out of the five top honours in the grooms awards, including first place going to Kiara Crosby, speaks for itself. Speaking of ribbons, well Maple did not fail to display the talent of the COR region. The final scores came out with Maple taking home six firsts, five seconds, one third, three fourths and two fifths individually, not to mention six out of six clear rounds in stadium. As for the team awards (keep in mind that all teams are made up of mixed clubs), Maple came home with two firsts, two seconds and a third. More exciting than the ribbons, the clean rounds and the insane cheering was the fact that on both Friday and Saturday night, Mapleopoulos was not the last camp to quiet down and go to sleep, and we were only told to keep it down once! Most of you readers may not realize what an accomplishment this is; if you want to understand the full immensity of it, I guess you will just all have to come and take part in ABC rally next year. (Photo by Mike Stevenson of the Maple Pony Club)\n\nUxbridge-Scugog Team Wins Canadian Masters Games Championship (Again)\n\nA team from the Uxbridge-Scugog Pony Club won the National Masters Games Championships August 23 near Cannington, Ontario, defeating teams from the Western Ontario, Alberta North and Nova Scotia Regions.\n\nThe competition comprised four sets of five races each, with the teams riding different ponies in each set. None of the Uxbridge-Scugog team members' own ponies were used, so all teams rode borrowed ponies exclusively. It soon became clear that it did not matter who was riding which ponies, Uxbridge-Scugog was clearly the dominant team. It won 16 of the 20 races, placed second in three and third in one, amassing 95 out of a possible 100 points (five points awarded for each first place finish). The members of the Uxbridge-Scugog team are Kendra Abbey, Mori Cruikshanks, Sean Cruikshanks, Jesse Durward and Samantha Macdonald.\n\nThis marks the sixth time in the past eight years that Uxbridge-Scugog has won the National Masters Games Championship (I was sooo tempted to add \"In other news, the sun is expected to rise in the East tomorrow\", but I didn't).\n\nUxbridge-Scugog/Simcoe Team a Close Second at National PPG A Championship\n\nOur COR representatives finished a mere six points behind a team from Alberta North Region at the National PPG A Championship held in Vancouver. The final standings were Alberta North 91, COR 85, BC Lower Mainland (East Maple Ridge) 77, BC Lower Mainland (Vancouver PC) 72 and Nova Scotia 69. Well done to our riders - James Cruikshanks, Chrystal Geer, Jane Stephenson, Rachel Stewart and Emily Stubbings.\n\nNOTE: We are hoping for photos of both the Masters and A Championships, and will add them if/when we get them.\n\nThe Student's Lament (a poem by Elyse Bondy of the Maple Pony Club)\n\nI make this song about my woes sadly\n\nMy own pitiful quandary. I a student tell\n\nwhat sorrows I have encountered since the beginning of 11U English.\n\nNever more than now did I know the dark days of Anglo-Saxon times.\n\nThe dark nights of Beowulf homework, cutting into the daylight of my\n\nriding times. Clean my horse's stall or stall on cleaning my binder?\n\nHere am I pen poised in hand unable to decipher the language\n\npresented before me. Mr. McCrea proclaimed that there was\n\nto be a test tomorrow yet there is so much more to do\n\nMore time, more time, how can there ever be enough hours\n\nin my meager day to prepare for this arduous task?\n\nI'd rather clean a hoof of pooh than have another essay to do!\n\nMy mount awaits my time and attention doesn't my teacher\n\nunderstand that exercising my horse is preferable to exercising my brain?\n\nThe wind billowing through my hair whilst cantering o'er the meadow is more pleasing to me than a day of reading and re-reading.\n\nI don't understand the English language the way my horse understands me.\n\nThe reins in my hands have a language of their own\n\na language understood without extra time in English tutorials.\n\nOh woe is me, am I ever to succeed in the comprehension of these confusing parodies? Time and time again I rewrite. \"Hello?\" Not happening!!\n\nThis is why I have an epic decision to make. Do I\n\nkeep on riding or quit to hit the books? 11U English is tying me down\n\ninstead of me tying my boots on the way out the door to riding.\n\nWhen will the teachers see that there is more to life and more to me?\n\nOh the fun life of a student is not all that it appears to be!\n\nThis poem reminds me of the time my daughter Stephanie had to skip a riding lesson to study for a philosophy exam, thus putting Descartes before de horse.\n\nSpring 2009\n\nThe competition season is still a little off (though we hope you are all working hard to prepare for Quiz) but there is still some news to report and some thank-you's to be made.\n\nRevised COR Rules & Regulations Approved at Canadian Pony Club Annual General Meeting\n\nThe extensive revisions to our Regional Rules & Regulations made at the March meeting of the Regional Committee have now been approved, along with those made in 2008 which were inadvertantly not presented for approval last year. They will be posted to the website soon (if they haven't already been - Teri Lindsay is pretty quick!) and I am sure you will all have them completely memorized before long. If time permits, there will be recitation contests every night at Working Rally (just kidding, but wouldn't that be good for ending the parties by putting everyone to sleep?). One of the main changes was to allow a lot more than before to be done by teleconference, so that the Northern Branches can participate more easily and fully in the business of the Region. One of the other important changes has to do with the position of Regional Youth Rep - see \"Congratulations!\", below.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nSeveral Central Ontario Pony Club members have achievements for us to salute in this issue.\n\nJohanna McKeen of Oshawa and Rebecca Simmons of Durham will BOTH be Regional Youth Reps for the coming year. The election that was held when we only had one Regional Youth Rep ended in a tie, but the revised Rules & Regs let us have more than one, so\n\nKyra Holmes of Maple has qualified to represent our Region at the National Show Jumping Finals to be held in Manitoba this September.\n\nWe are sending six competitors to the National Dressage Finals in Nova Scotia in August, as follows:\n\nStarter - Devon Cassell of Springwater\n\nPre-Training - Tara Chaisson of Simcoe and Janene Howran of Kawartha\n\nTraining - Jennifer McKeen of Oshawa\n\nFirst Level - Meaghan Lloyd of Durham\n\nSecond Level - Johanna McKeen of Oshawa\n\nAdditionally, two Central Ontarians - Stacy Bootsma of Rising Star and Taylor Ryan of Whitchurch - have been awarded OEF bursaries (see the Press Releases section for more details).\n\nThank You's\n\nSeveral organizations have supported Pony Club in general and Central Ontario in particular for many years, and they deserve our thanks.\n\nFirst, the Ontario Equestrian Federation - In addition to bursaries such as those noted above, the OEF has given very welcome grants to the three Ontario Pony Club Regions for many, many years. Fairly often, we get the largest grant given to any of the OEF's member associations. This year alone, Central Ontario's share amounted to nearly $3,000 - $2,886 to be exact. Many, many thanks.\n\nNext, a tip of the hat (ha ha) to Apple Saddlery, which has donated merchandise to be used at our Pony Club shows for years now, maybe decades. If you don't already have an Apple Saddlery hat, practice harder, and you might win one this season.\n\nLast but not least, a long overdue thank you to the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Karol Shipley writes, \"I am sure most pony clubbers don't know that, mainly through the efforts of Gayle McPherson, the RAWF has donated free tickets to the fair and the Royal Horse Show to the Ontario Region Pony Clubs for 14 years now. At 500 to 600 tickets a year for the 3 ontario regions, that amounts to a total donation estimated at $234,000. Gayle started the first pony club in Manitoba (Assiniboine) with Doug Catto. She then came to Ontario and was with the Caledon PC. Gayle is now the first woman to serve as President of the RAWF, a wonderful achievement. Many, many thanks to her for so many years of supporting our members and volunteers who go to enjoy the show every year...on what a lot of us now unofficially call 'Pony Club night at the Royal. The http://www.freewebs.com/yorkuequestrian/index.htmRAWF is further supporting CPC this year on our 75th Anniversary with an additional donation towards tickets for the youth conference participants in November 2009.\"\n\nYork University Equestrian Team\n\nThose of you enrolled at York, or about to graduate from high school, may be interested to learn that former Pony Club member Alicia Cantin has started a York University Equestrian Show Team at her barn, Constellation Farms. There are also teams at Brock, Guelph, Laurier, McMaster, Toronto, Trent, Waterloo and Western, and they do compete with each other at the Beginner, Novice, Intermediate and Open levels - NOT necessarily the same as Pony Club levels with the same names. All shows are on a catch-ride basis, but York team members may train on their own horses if they are at Constellation, or use one of Alicia's horses. So if you are away from home at university and cannot get to Pony Club activities, here is a way to keep your hand in. Alicia reports that the team has a mini-horse for a mascot, and that the girls are making a sweater for it.

The clinic on which it is based took place when Spring was only a few days old, but our first appointment to do this story, including an interview, was torpedoed by cellphone problems, and then show season was upon us - both Di Langmuir's and our own. Better late than never, we hope.\n\nDi Langmuir Jumper Medal Clinic\n\nOn March 29, COR held a jumper medal clinic with Di Langmuir. Di is a Level 2 coach whose students now compete on the Ontario \"A\" Circuit. She is the current President of the Ontario Hunter-Jumper Association. But she is also an alumna of the Guelph Pony Club, and instructed at the Eglinton Pony Club back when it was located at Leslie and John Streets in Thornhill, and later when it was at what is now RCRA.\n\nTo start with, this clinic had a problem - an unusual problem for COR clinics and educational activities most of the time - that is, squeezing in everyone who wanted to come. Diane McGill, COR Show Jumping Chair, estimates the audience at something over 120 people, of whom about 80 were active members and the rest a mix of parents and coaches. The clinic was held at the McKeen family's place, so thanks are due to them and to the Oshawa Pony Club. Diane McGill reports, \"The day went off without a hitch, the weather was fantastic, no one got stuck in the mud or snow, the facility was wonderful, lunch was great and Di was perfect. She covered so much information in a very informal and often humorous way. Everything from dress, attitude, respect to horse and helpers and of course the technical aspects of riding medals. The break down of the clinic was also good, with the \"classroom/lecture\" portion first, then the explanation and importance of walking and counting the course and then the test rides. There was opportunity at all portions to ask questions which was very important. Although the parents asked most of the questions, Di was able to cover and confirm what the Show Jumping committee has been trying to get across for a few years now, only she managed to do it in a few hours. The riders for the day were Allison Loveridge and Lady, Michelle Treen and Garnett (both from the Durham Pony Club) and Brigid Goulem on Poco in the 2 foot group (Kawartha Pony Club), Johanna McKeen and Millie, Jenn McKeen on Mya (both Oshawa Pony Club) and Rebecca Simmons on Mo (Durham) in the 2foot 6\" level and Rebecca Adrian and Dusty (Kawartha) rode in the 3 foot group. These types of clinics can be tough on the riders as they are very much in the spot light, and we thank them for being our guinea pigs for the day. Having them ride was a very effective way to demonstrate her information.\"\n\nTetrathlon Update\n\nThanks to Grace Wavryk for this report.\n\nThe 2008 National Tetrathlon took place July 28th - August 1st in Ottawa, Ontario and was hosted by St. Lawrence-Ottawa Valley Region. Twenty five competitors from coast to coast travelled to compete in this five day competition. The competitors stayed in the heart of the Nation's capital at Ashbury College where the shooting and running portions of the competition took place. We were very fortunate to have the riding portion take place at Nepean National Equestrian Park.\n\nKristen Wavryk, Maple Pony Club, was the lone competitor representing Central Ontario Region (her sister Amber was off in Europe learning English?!?!? and improving her French). Kristen competed as a Junior and had a personal best in shooting with a score of 171, winning the high point award and beating the senior competitors as well. She placed fourth overall in the individual competition, scoring 4,064 points. Kristen was also on a mixed team with competitors from Calgary, Nova Scotia and Ottawa, and this team placed second overall.\n\nWith Tetrathlon barely over, five of the competitors, including Kristen, rushed off to compete at National Pentathlon which took place August 1st - 3rd in Guelph, Ontario. Pentathlon also includes epee fencing and at the national level, only competitors 19 years and older are allowed to compete in the riding phase (stadium jumping only). Kristen competed in the Youth A division (15 and under) and placed 3rd in the shoot and the fence, and 2nd in the run, with an overall 3rd place finish. Where Tetrathlon takes place over two or three days, Pentathlon is completed all in one day, starting with the shoot at 7:00am followed by fencing, swimming, riding and finishing with the run at the end of the day. It was a busy, but fun filled week for these tetrathletes/pentathletes and we were able to see Joshua Riker-Fox, a former Pony Clubber from Delacour, Alberta compete at National Pentathlon before travelling off to compete at the Olympics.\n\nIn 2009, both National Tetrathlon and National Pentathlon will take place in British Columbia, so let's see if we can get some more representation from Central Ontario!\n\nVisiting Kawartha Downs\n\nThanks to Laurie Reynolds for this report.\n\nOn Saturday, April 19, 2008 at Kawartha Downs Race Track, members of the Kawartha Pony Club were treated to a Clinic on the Race Industry by Jim Huck, Race Secretary and a number of volunteer drivers, trainers and a blacksmith.\n\nThe members and parents were given a very thorough clinic on what happens at the race track with the following areas being covered:\n\n1) A Day in the Life of a Racehorse\n\n2) Harnessing a Standardbred\n\n3) Tour of the Grandstand/Paddock\n\n4) Ride in the two seater jog cart\n\n5) Driver/Blacksmith/Groom sharing information\n\n6) Rules and Regulations of Harness Racing\n\nAll the Pony club members had the opportunity to jog a horse out on the track in the two seater jog carts. A very special opportunity was to meet and drive with the youngest female trainer in Canada at 16 years old, Elaine Reid.\n\nKawartha Pony club would also like to thank the following people for volunteering their time to speak with our group:\n\nJim Huck, Race Secretary\n\nCrystal O'Brien, Simulcast Manager\n\nDoug Hie, Trainer / Driver\n\nArt Balson, Trainer / Driver\n\nKyle Balson, Trainer / Driver\n\nJason Woodward, Trainer / Driver\n\nTed Reid, Trainer\n\nElaine Reid, Trainer\n\nIan McCardle, Blacksmith\n\nMy European Vacation - by Katie Stephenson, Maple Pony Club\n\nWhat do you get when you take a Pony Clubber, a camera, a backpack and a whirlwind trip through Europe? You get some amazing memories, a lot of pictures and a very interesting photo album.\n\nLike all good graduates, when I finished my last year of University I planned a trip to Europe with a friend. Unlike other graduates whose only concern is how far they can make their money stretch, my primary concern was how long I would be leaving my horse for. However, I made up for missing my creature by becoming a stalker of all things horse related wherever we went. Thankfully I was blessed with a travel companion who acknowledges my sickness as part of my charm - however that did not stop her from making fun of me on a daily basis.\n\nDespite the mockery, Europe really is a treasure trove for the horse obsessed and not always in the places that you would expect. We didn't do any barn or horsie day trips despite the fact that we were in London during Badminton. Nonetheless, it seemed that just about everywhere you looked there were horses. In London there was the Queen's guard performing their various roles and tasks. In Paris, there were Police horses everywhere from their barns (happily situated within minutes of our hostel), to the streets outside of Notre Dame, to the palace grounds at Versailles. Carriage horses seemed to abound in Italy, from outside the gates of the Vatican to the base of the leaning tower in Pisa.\n\nEven when there weren't horses, there was horsie paraphernalia. We found a monument to Animals in War while wandering the streets of London and there are statues in Hyde Park. Past Monarchs are memorialized at the Tower of London by their horses and armour and the British Museum holds the amazing statues from the Parthenon among countless others. The city of Paris is littered with breathtaking statues, many with horses, as are the grounds of Versailles.\n\nThe Louvre, among the beautiful paintings and statues many with horses, also has bits. Yes that's right, bits! And yes I have pictures. More bits were found at the Vatican Museum along with a number of chariots and many more statues of horses were discovered on our wanderings through Rome.\n\nThere were other discoveries made in Europe. Like the fact that the house of Windsor can be traced back to a guy named Egbert. That good Gelato should be considered one of the seven wonders. That there are pigeons everywhere you go - not kidding, there were pigeons in every city we visited, some were just more obnoxious then others. I also reconfirmed the knowledge that my obsession with horses is an age old one that entire civilizations have been memorializing in various media for centuries. So Moms and Dads out there, when your kids would rather clean a stall then their room, encourage it. Who knows, they could end up with a painting in the Louvre one day.\n\nLe Trec\n\nMany thanks to Diane McGill for this report.\n\nOn Sunday September 28th, the hills of Burketon were alive with sounds of laughter and hoof beats. Fiddlesticks Farms and Durham Pony Club had the pleasure of hosting the second Pony Club LE TREC competition. Forty one riders entered the show- 21 D's, 12 D 1's and 8 C's. The weather cooperated beautifully and despite a chill in the morning air and some threatening clouds in the afternoon we were all able to stay dry.\n\nThis year we chose to have all phases mounted. The younger riders were especially happy about this. They were permitted to have two adults with their team for Phase A, the orienteering and check point phase. This allowed for a safe and enjoyable way for the children to complete the trail. The parents did not need a work out that night after all of the walking they would do that day. The D1 and C riders also rode as teams. The maps were challenging and those who knew how to read a compass faired much better. The horses and riders really seemed to love this part of LE TREC. The trails were primarily wooded while the C's also spent some time in the hilly meadow area. One team became very lost but kept their wits and good spirits and were able to get back on track. Although none of the teams managed the optimum time some did come very close.\n\nPhase B- the control of gaits, proved to be a challenge for some again this year. It is not as easy as it looks to trot slow and walk fast when it counts. We toned down the penalties from the National Rule Book and subtracted ten for each error rather than assigning a zero score. This allowed the riders some room for error while still maintaining some scores in this Phase. A nicer way to score and no tears this year( yes!) .\n\nAfter a short lunch break we all hit the trails on foot to walk Phase C. This was approximately a two km walk but it did not dampen the spirits of any of the riders. The younger D riders have boundless energy, and chatted and giggled the whole way. We provided some challenges here. The stations all had a task that required the horse and rider i.e. no questions. This seemed to be well received. We had a wooden trail bridge for the D1's and C's to do, had them opening gates and jumping. The D's only had one small log to jump, which according to them was not nearly enough. The C's had five small cross country type jumps on their trail. We did have one rider in a Western saddle which is permitted. She was concern edinitially but in true Pony Club spirit completed the course Western tack and all.\n\nScoring takes a long time for this competition. Many thanks to Mike Stephenson for offering to do that for us. We have some ideas to help speed this process along for next year. We have to remember that this is still a very new competition and there is much to learn. The do's and don'ts of LE TREC are still to be totally determined.\n\nThere is a great deal of preparation for Le TREC and Durham Pony Club parents and members really pulled through to make it come together. The day of the competition also required many volunteers and we were able to count of several people from other clubs, as well as friends of Durham Pony Club, to help with this. That's what I love about Pony Club, there are always many volunteers that you can count on\n\nBill and Nancy Murray were very generous to allow us to invade their piece of paradise and we appreciate it. Thanks you to the competitors who left the field and trails as you found them. Thumbs up to LE TREC. Let's try to keep this as an annual competition.\n\nYear-End Awards Banquet\n\nThe annual COR Awards Banquet was held October 25 at the Newmarket Optimist Hall, hosted by the Rising Star Pony Club. Unfortunately your humble Editor was unable to be there this year, but all reports have been positive and we understand that Rising Star deserves our thanks. Our information is not quite complete at the time of writing this edition, but here is what we have so far.\n\nShow Jumping - Here are the Champions and Reserves for each Division, based on points accumulated over the 2008 season.\n\nPre-Entry A2 - Champion was Rachel Scott of the Victoria Pony Club riding Peanut, with Michaels McLachlan of the Brooklin Pony Club and Nevada the Reserve.\n\nPre-Entry B - Durham Pony Club riders finished one-two in this Division.

There was a tie for the Reserve between Stacy Bootsma of the Rising Star Pony Club on Reecez Pieces (and as the guy who puts out the press releases, I can tell you that this pony also should win a prize for having its name spelled the most different ways from show program to show program throughout the year, and I only hope we have it right this time) and Maggie Brims of the Whitchurch Pony Club on M and M.\n\nStarter - Kassandra Sloan of the Oshawa Pony Club was the Champion on Finders Keepers, with Samantha Lobbezoo of the Brooklin Pony Club the Reserve on Ride 'Em Harley Style.\n\nBeginner - Patrick Kossa of the Whitchurch Pony Club was Champion on Milo, with Carrie Doorenspleet of Durham the Reserve on Gold Rush Frontier.\n\nNovice - Another one-two finish by one Pony Club, this time Oshawa.

The Year End High Point Award went to Jennifer McKeen, also of Oshawa.\n\nDressage - to come\n\nGames - Our A Champions were the \"USSTs\", whose members were James Cruikshanks, Stephen Hall and Jane Stephenson, all of Uxbridge-Scugog, along with Emily Stubbings of the Simcoe Pony Club and Meghan Midwood of the Toronto & North York Pony Club. Finishing second were the Rising Star \"Sandybacks\", made up of Stacy Bootsma, Emily Lindsay, Rhiannon McCarren, Chloe Raitt and Jenna Meeser. These teams went on to the National Championships in Western Ontario, where the \"USSTs\" finished first and the \"Sandybacks\" second (in a tie-breaker with East Maple Ridge, BC). COR rules!\n\nAt the Masters level, our Regional Champions were from Uxbridge-Scugog (what a shock!), the \"Electric Six\", made up of Mori Cruikshanks, Sean Cruikshanks, Samantha Macdonald, Jessica McVittie and Jessica Lloyd. This team went on to win the Zones and placed a close second at the National Championships in Alberta North, only two points behind the new Champions, the Vancouver Pony Club. Our second place team Regionally was the \"Draters\", whose members were Rebecca Simmons, Carrie Doorenspleet and Amanda Treen, all of the Durham Pony Club, plus Jocelyn Donaldson of Uxbridge-Scugog.\n\nThe winning B team was from the Maple Pony Club. The members of the B Champions are Laura Hicks, Riikka Kojola, Megan O'Hara, Lauren Sergejewich and Molly White-Williams. Rising Star finished second, but unfortunately we do not have the names of the members of that team.\n\nOur Central Ontario C Champions were Maple #1. The members of Maple #1 are Sunny Willert, Alice Pintaric, Jen Stoltz and Kiara Crosbie. The Temiskaming \"Sapphires\" finished second; again we unfortunately have their names.\n\nA/B/CRally - Many thanks to Sue Foell for this report.\n\nIt was with great excitment that our COR ABC members where once again offered an invitation to join our WOR friends at ABC Rally. It was held August 15th -17th at the historic event grounds of Checkmate. COR was represented by six riders from the Maple and three fromToronto & North York Branches and eight grooms from Maple, Rising Star and Toronto & North York Branches. WOR supplied each team with extra grooms to allow for one groom per rider and a head groom.\n\nAfter weeks and weeks of daily downpours and drizzle, we all packed our vehicles with every type of waterproof clothing (of the two-legged and four-legged type) as well as waterproof tents for slepping and extra shelters for eating/meeting. I personally could have used an 18 wheeler to pack all the extras \"just in case\" in true Pony Club style. (I am embarrassed to confess the one thing I forgot was my sleeping bag, but alas a horse blanket will do in a pinch!) We arrived Friday afternoon and after settling the horses in we set up our tents in a gentle mist trying not to let the rain dampen our spirits.\n\n6:00 pm arrived and the competition began- with the stable management and trot-up. Our COR riders and grooms looked professional as the horses were evaluated at the trot-up. The Grand River grooms shone when they proved they could make a white tail sparkle and shine! ( and it stayed like this all weekend!)\n\nThe next morning saw competitors awakening to a SUNNY sunrise energizing all for the day's event. Dressage was in the morning and stadium jumping in the afternoon.\n\nThe grooms also enjoyed a fun round in the stadium ring. At day's end our Rising Star Groom Emily Lindsay was leading in the Grooms Competition.\n\nThe next morning was even sunnier and warmer for the roads and tracks phase followed by the cross country phase. It was a lovely day for the ride and the footing was awesome! Our teams continued to put forth their best efforts throughout the competition.\n\nFinally the points were tallied and awards presented.\n\nCOR members recieved the following Overall Individual awards:\n\nEntry Level -4th Laura Gilligan and Nightlite (TNY) , 6th- Karen Foell and My Little Romeo, 8th Kristen Wavryk and Flubber Bunny (Maple), 9th Erin McLaughlin and Heineken (TNY).\n\nPre-Training -1st Sophie Kaplan and Kye (Maple), 3rd Sarah Nason and That Kinda Girl\"(Maple), 4th Jennifer Nason and Faolin Ruadh (Maple), 5th Kyra Holmes and Heart and Soul: (Maple).\n\nTraining - 3rd Emily Boyce and Serendipity (Maple)\n\nGrooms- 3rd -Emily Lindsay (Rising Star),3rd Emily Mitchell (Maple) 5th Riikka Kojola (Maple)\n\nWe would like to thank all the WOR ABC Rally organizers, the chaperones, parents and volunteers, whom together made this a great experience for our members. A special \"Thank-you\" to Lyn Morris for warmly welcoming us and helping to find us grooms to complete our teams. Finally a well-fed thank-you to the ladies who looked after feeding us. Lots of tasty meals and treats were enjoyed!\n\nQuiz - Our Regional Quiz winners were as follows:\n\nA/B Level - Maya Kenedy, Kyra Holmes, Christy Chamney and Alicia Cantin all of Maple.\n\nC Level - Johanna McKeen and Stephanie Rutherford, both of Oshawa, Stephanie Kalgoris of Ajax and Jenny Isaacs of Maple.\n\nD2 Level - Nikki Clark of Centaurus, Katherine Earle and Emma Lemay-Nejedelski, both of Ajax, and Samantha Morandin of Centaurus.\n\nAs everyone knows, Central Ontario hosted this year's National Quiz - and hats off to Margie Kenedy and her team for the great job they did. Nationally, at the A/B level, Maya Kenedy of the Maple Pony Club finished second on an individual basis, and the Central Ontario A/B team, shown at right, also finished second. The only Central Ontario member to compete in the Affiliates division, for competitors 21-25 years old, Katie Stephenson of Maple, also finished second. The other members of the Central Ontario A/B team were Kyra Holmes (11th individually), Alicia Cantin (14th) and Christy Chamney (19th), all members of the Maple Pony Club. Carolyn Wight of the Northumberland Pony Club formed part of a mixed Manitoba/Nova Scotia/Central Ontario team that finished seventh, while she finished 18th individually.\n\nCentral Ontario's C level competitors did not do quite so well, finishing tenth as a team and with no individual ranked higher than 30th. But by all accounts they had a great time.\n\nThere is no D2 level competition at National Quiz.\n\nChair's Award\n\nThis year the Chair's Award went to Margie Kenedy and Sally Chamney for their magnificent effort in staging the National Quiz. It took them 18 months of preparation, e-mails and phone calls to develop a working group as well as volunteers for the event and finished with four days of no sleep - but awesome feedback from all participants,volunteers and parents. A well deserved award.\n\nWelsh Pony and Cob High Point Award Program\n\nThanks to Marie Howran for this report, and to Howran Hills Farm for sponsoring this award, new for 2008.\n\nOn behalf of the Welsh Pony and Cob Association of Ontario, Howran Hills Farm sponsored the Central Ontario Pony Club, High Point Award for Welsh Ponies, Cobs and Half-Welsh participating in Pony Club events during the 2008 year.\n\nThese High Point Awards are intended to recognize the versatility of the Welsh Breed and their suitability for riders of all ages.\n\nThe winners of these awards demonstrate the Welsh qualities that Welsh breeders hold dear, ponies of substance, with true Welsh character and versatility.\n\nIn the Purebred category for 2008, there was a \"Tie\" for the Champion Position. To award the ribbons, the total number of events attended was used to break the tie.\n\nChampion Purebred Welsh\n\nSection A Welsh Mountain Pony - PPF Garnet - 45 points - Ridden and owned by Michelle Treen of the Durham Pony Club.\n\n\"Darnit Garnet\" participated in Show Jumping qualifiers, Show Jumping Finals, Working Rally and Le Trec.\n\nTied for total points:\n\nSection.

It is for the best job schooling and training a green horse or pony. The first winner of the Stillwoods Farm Award was Emily Lindsay (lots of exercise for Emily going between the Rising Star table and the podium), for her work training a five year old Clydesdale-Thoroughbred cross named Trinity. Here are excerpts of Emily's entry for this award.\n\nI got Trinity in March 2008 to do a favour for a friend. I thought this would be a good chance to try eventing on a horse, as well as try to qualify for National Medals next year. (My pony is 13HH..) When I got her I realized how green she really was. She either had very little to no training on her or she had forgotten everything.\n\nWhen I got Trinity in March she was green and did not know how to canter. Before each lesson we would lunge her to help me get the bend, before I rode her. This went on for about a month, and then we started to ride her without lunging her first. She was getting better and was learning how to canter. She was very stubborn and strong but we worked through it now she is responsive and respectful (most the time). For the first three months we worked hard and long. I had two lessons a week and was riding her at least 4 -5 times each week. Then she was going so well we started jumping her over little things no bigger than 2. As soon as she was ready we started trailering her and a friend to Cedar Peaks for lessons with Anne Zander on the cross-country course. There we also had lessons in dressage and stadium. In the spring I was having three lessons week on Trinity and sometimes a show on the weekend. In the summer because of my Mom's business we have to move away from my coaches, but still I rode her three times a week and once a week on the cross. When we got back we now have lessons twice a week at Cedar Peaks. We are jumping 26 to 29 in our lesson to get ready for the event coming. I have learned that working with a young, green horse requires a lot of patience and persistence, I found out (sometimes the hard way) that green horses have to be rode differently then my trained pony. You have to help them out with some things like balance. Working with Trinity was a lot more work then I though when I agreed to take her, but it has been a lot fun and I have learnt a lot. I will be very sad when I have to give her back at the end of next season.\n\nMy first show was at Wits End. This show was a combined training event (not with Pony Club). It was dressage and jumper. We did a walk/trot dressage test, and since there was no real walk/trot division I didnt get any placing. It was just for experience for Trinity. Next, I went to the Simcoe dressage show in the pre-training level. I got a fourth and a second in my two tests that I rode. After that, it was the Uxbridge-Scugog, Show Jumper Qualifier at Blue Star. I rode in the starter division. I got a first in the medal, but was eliminated in the other two rounds. The next show was the Brooklin Show Jumper. Here I got a seventh in the Table A, a fourth in the Power and Speed as well as a fourth in the Medal. We went to Show Jumping Finals at Ajax. I got a fourth in the Power and Speed, also a fourth in the Medal. My last show was at Foggy River. It was a short course and I got fourth in dressage and went clear in the jumping portion. So, I got third overall in the entry division (this was a non-Pony Club event). I am also working towards going to the Grand View horse trials in October.\n\nRoyal China Memorial Award\n\nThis trophy, new this year in honour of a well-loved pony who has gone to the great pasture in the sky, is to recognize the pony/horse that a Pony Clubber rides in any discipline. The winner is chosen based on a short essay. Once again, the winner was Emily Lindsay of Rising Star. Here is her winning essay.\n\nMy pony's name is Tarragon. He is 13hh, 18 years old bay reg. Welsh. I got him when he was 12. We borrowed him for 2 years and then bought him from a pony club family. Tarragon was a surprise to me, because he was my tenth birthday present.\n\nI rode my first dressage test ever on Tarragon at a Pony Club dressage qualifier and we came 2nd and 3rd at Entry level in 2003 and in 2007 we were champions in the Pre-training division.\n\nIn the years in between he has taken me lots of places and we have accomplished many things together. With Tarragon I have had a lot of fun showing, playing, going on trail rides, galloping through fields, sometimes bareback and bridleless. He has taught me to ride, to jump, and have fun. When I go to the field and call his name he comes to me. (he won't do this for anyone else, not even my mom). He is my best friend.\n\nTarragon has done \"A\" PPG's for 2 years, one of those years that team made it to the National competition. He played at the B level before that. Last year we won the pre-training division for dressage, and I lent him to another Pony Cluber who didn't have her own pony and they were reserve champion in the starter division. Also he was on the national pre-training drill team for 2007 and 2008. Tarragon was reserve champion for the entry division in Show jumping in 2007. Through out his years in pony club he was champion at D Rally at the D1 level. Also he has taken several beginners through a dressage test and came out in the ribbons. In 2006 he took the year off from doing PPG's to do the Trillium Hunter Shows. He was 6th in his division (medium pony) in the Zone and went to championships at Palgrave and placed 2nd. (He & I like Pony Club shows much better)\n\nTarragon also teaches young kids to ride. He is in a summer camp program, for the 9 weeks of the summer. In the winter he is teaches lesson to beginners he is extremely good. He just took a beginner to her first show ever and she was Res. Champion in the cross rails division.\n\nI have, very sadly, outgrown Tarragon. I will continue to ride him for fun and to play PPG's on and he will continue to be my best friend and will forever be my first pony that taught me everything I know. And he will continue to teach young pony clubber all he knows.\n\nI hope you will consider Tarragon for your award. He is what I consider the perfect Pony Clubber Pony!! He takes good care of his younger riders but will still do what I ask him to.\n\nKaren Meuleman Award\n\nKaren Meuleman was a member of the Leitchcroft Pony Club branch who was part of a severe motor accident on her way to enter a dressage show in March 1989. This memorial award was created by the Leitchcroft Pony Club branch in memory of Karen. As the branch is now retired, due to the sale of the property known as Leitchcroft Farm, the branch has given the award to the Central Ontario Region.\n\nRecipients of the award can be of any level within Pony Club and from any branch within the Region. The winner will be a member who best meets the ideals of Pony Club in his/her participation in activities, sportsmanship and effort, support of others and progress in riding and horsemanship during the current year. There is a trophy that would remain with the Region with a plate with the winner's name engraved upon it. The winner would be presented with a commemorative gift and an award card.\n\nThis year's winner is Rebecca Jones of the Springwater Pony Club. Here is her nomination form, submitted by her DC.\n\nSpringwater Pony Club would like to nominate REBECCA JONES for this award. Rebecca is the most senior rider in our club as well as being our Youth Rep. Rebecca is currently at the D2 level and her main goal is to become a C before she leaves for university next year. Her riding interests include, dressage, show jumping, tetrathlon and rally.\n\nRebecca has been the ideal role model for all members. Below is a list of Rebecca's outstanding contributions to our club.\n\n1. At the Durham/Uxbridge SJ at Blue Star this year, our coach had a personal tragedy and was unable to attend this meet. Rebecca took it upon herself to scratch from the competition so she could coach our team. She showed a tremendous amount of leadership and helped the girls through the day especially through the emotional times.\n\n2. During working rally this year, Rebecca stepped up to be the \"leader\" to the other first time attendees. She was terrific in explaining the process of how rally and working rally works and made sure the kids understood everything.\n\n3. Rebecca has stepped in to coach lessons whenever needed and is always willing to help out.\n\n4. She is excellent at working with riders with various cognitive and physical challenges.\n\n5. Rebecca has always showed leadership during our pony club meetings. She has led the girls through many activities while the parents had their meetings.\n\nOverall, Rebecca's team spirit, sportsmanship and overall general attitude make her a valuable team member and a worthy recipient of this award. Rebecca has an infectious personality that makes her very enjoyable to be around.\n\nSpring, 2008\n\n\"Spring\" may be a bit optimistic at the time of writing this, since it is cold and blowy outside today. It seems clear, however, that we have entered Stage 1 of Spring in Canada. Did you know that Spring has four stages in Canada? It's true! I heard about it on the radio a few years ago so it must be true. The four stages are:\n\nStage 1: This usually kicks in about mid to late February, when the days really are getting a little longer, and the birds are starting to sing again. We start thinking about Spring, and that is Stage 1.\n\nStage 2: As the month of March comes in, roaring or baa-ing as the case may be, we start really looking forward to Spring, and that is Stage 2.\n\nStage 3: As April wears on, cold and rainy and doing its best impression of November, we start complaining about how late Spring is this year, and that is Stage 3.\n\nStage 4: Stage 4, of course, is Summer.\n\nAnd while we're at it, hands up everyone who thinks having Leap Day in February is a total rip-off. This is another argument I heard on the radio last week, and I couldn't agree more. I mean, whether February has 28 days or 29, it's always going to be the runt of the litter, right? Why not add the extra day to a nice, deserving month that could use it. There are several perfectly fine months that have only 30 days right now. Think of it! The powers that be could have given us an extra day in June, or September, or even April (April needs an extra day to get its act together; see \"Stage 3\", above). But nooo, we get an extra day of February, with extra snow. I guess those who celebrated Groundhog Day by roasting one of the dratted critters for dinner can use the extra day to finish off the last of the leftover groundhog casserole, but to them, the rest of us say, \"Freeze it, for goodness sake!\"\n\nOn re-reading the above paragraph, I realized that we have been dealing in half measures here. Let's think bigger. Right now most of the world is using the Gregorian calendar, while a minority have stuck with the older Julian calendar. And let's face it, as calendars go, they are both pretty clunky. Here is a chance to unite everyone by getting them to adopt the new, much better-planned CORian calendar. In the new calendar, May, June, July, August and September would each have 32 days. That is seven more than they have now. Where do those seven days come from? Easy. We cut back November, December, January and March to 29 days each, thus making winter shorter and, just as a bonus, giving February less of an inferiority complex. February, April and October can stay as they are. As for Leap Year, every four years June would get an extra Sunday, and just for this once it would come between Wednesday and Thursday, to give the horses a little time to rest between the activities scheduled for the regular Sundays at each end of Leap Week (well, since it is Leap Day of course we would schedule an extra show jumping qualifier for it, wouldn't we?). Ta da! Perfection! Now all we have to do is get the rest of the world to go along with this obviously far more satisfactory arrangement. Let's start a petition.\n\nOur call for news from the Branches has not met with much response, but here are a couple of items from around Central Ontario.\n\nVisiting an Olympian\n\nOn Saturday, January 26, 2008 at Oakcrest Farms, members of the Kawartha Pony Club and the Uxbridge-Scugog Pony Club were treated to a Dressage presentation by Belinda Trussell and Royan II, the horse that she rode at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.\n\nThe members and parents were given a tour of Belinda's facility and had the opportunity to ask Belinda questions about all aspects of her career.\n\nSimcoe Pony Club Member Heading to Africa\n\nEmily Stubbings, a member of the Simcoe Pony Club, is scheduled to leave for Botswana on March 9, as part of the Canadian Mounted Games team. Here is a message from her DC, Bev Rice (I had planned to run this earlier but was hoping for a bit more material).\n\nEmily Stubbings is a 12 year old member of the Simcoe Pony Club. Emily has been involved with Simcoe since the 2000/2001 season and has been heavily involved in many of the pony club disciplines including Dressage, Prince Philip Games, Quiz and D-rally. This past summer Emily was scouted at a Prince Philip Games competition by Jim Dunn who coaches the Canada Mounted Games teams and was invited to try out for a spot on an International team that would be travelling to Botswana, Africa this coming March. After a lot of hard work and dedicated training, Emily has been invited to join the team and travel to Africa not only to compete but to work with other youth teams there and teach them gaming techniques while on horseback.\n\nThe cost of this entire trip is close to $5,000 and we have decided that as a club, that Simcoe Pony Club would like to make an effort to assist the family in raising the funds that will allow Emily to follow her dream and participate on the International team. The youth in equestrian sports are the up and coming riders for the future so we are reaching out to equestrian organizations, equestrian retailers/wholesalers, and equestrian enthusiasts who would like to help us assist Emily to reach her goal of being a team member on this International team.\n\nIf you would like to help us to help Emily reach her goal, please contact me and I will gladly accept your donation.\n\nWe thank everyone for at least taking the time to read of Emily's accomplishments in hopes of getting her to Africa with the Canada Mounted Games team.\n\nBev. Rice, DC\n\nSimcoe Pony Club\n\nrice.bev@gmail.com\n\nThe January Conference\n\nCOR held its second annual two-day conference for District Commissioners, ADCs and other members of Branch Executives on January 19 and 20, with a Regional Committee meeting on the afternoon of January 20.\n\nInsurance Issues, or, Taking Silly Chances\n\nAside from discussing scheduling and rule changes for our own activities, we also had a repeat presentation on insurance from the Canadian Pony Club insurance broker, Mike King of InterCity. A former Pony Club member, Mike explained very clearly the reason for all the paperwork that some of the DCs seem to find so burdensome, and patiently answered many questions. Despite this, several Branches have still not filed the required information and have had to be suspended. If you are not sure whether or not your Branch is suspended, go to the home page of the COR website and click on the \"Suspended Branches\" link. If a Branch is suspended, it is not allowed to conduct any Pony Club activities, and its members are NOT, repeat NOT, covered by the Pony Club insurance policy. What that means is, if a suspended Branch does do something, and, heaven forbid, an accident should happen, the DC and other members of the Branch Executive are on their own. These days, if an accident happens, some lawyer will sue everybody who was in the same time zone when it happened, on behalf of the parents and the child. What I did not know until this session is, whatever the outcome of the original lawsuit by the parents, the child can launch another one once he or she reaches the age of 18. If you go ahead with \"Pony Club\" activity while under suspension, you are betting your house - and that bet may stay on the table for a long, long time - to avoid the trouble of filling out some forms. As a risk vs. reward proposition, it does not make sense.\n\nEducational Clinic(s)\n\nAn educational clinic was held for active members on January 19, featuring a morning session on equine dentistry and an afternoon session on parasites. The clinic was attended by 28 active members, with a visit by delegates to the main conference in the afternoon (all those planning to serve noodles for dinner quickly had their minds changed by assorted disgusting creatures floating in formaldehyde: main hobby when alive - oozing). On March 1 there will be another clinic, this one with a session on poisonous plants and another on corrective shoeing.\n\nNational Quiz\n\nCOR is hosting National Quiz this coming Thanksgiving, and Margie Kenedy gave a presentation about it on the morning of January 20. Margie is bursting with plans, and got some offers of help from Branches represented at the conference, but could use lots more. Please get in touch with her to help make the 2008 National Quiz the most exciting ever.\n\nA Report from the Ontario Winter Games - by Kristen Wavryk, Maple Pony Club\n\nHello all,\n\nThis past March 5th to 9th I participated in the Ontario Winter Games in Collingwood. I was allowed to participate in both Fencing and Shooting, which are both part of the Olympic sport of Modern Pentathlon (fencing, riding, shooting, swimming, and running). This is a slight variation of Tetrathlon but with fencing added, and tetrathlon has a heavier focus on riding (Pentathlon only has stadium jumping).\n\nThis was my first year of fencing (epée) and I much enjoyed learning these new skills. I was quite honoured to be selected to participate in these 2008 Ontario Winter Games. There were over 3000 athletes in 23 different sports (including hockey, figure skating, snowboarding, and badminton. etc.) In fencing there were almost 100 athletes competing in epée, foil and sabre. Although I did not finish in the medals, I fought hard and was proud of my accomplishments. In the team portion, my sister Amber and I (as well as two other female fencers) finished in an amazing second place in epée. We lost only by two points.\n\nIn addition to my sister and I, there were two other pentathletes (Mathea Stephens and Garnet Stephens) participating in fencing. The four of us are all Tetrathletes! Fencing is quite new to all of us and, I have to admit, was a bit difficult to pick up, but I believe we all did well and tried our best. Unfortunately, as Penthaletes, it is difficult to be good in all five sports, and even more difficult competing against other athletes who are experts in their sport.\n\nThe same day I finished fencing, I was rushed over to the shooting venue which took place in Meaford, about 20 minutes away. We stayed and competed at an army base which was quite the experience. Every morning we were wakened to the national anthem at 06:00 hours, although most of us slept through it! It was also strange knowing that eyes were constantly watching you, as if they have never seen a girl our age before! Can you imagine?? Anyway we shot twice, once Friday for team competition, and on Saturday, for the individual competition. I did pretty well and ended up fourth overall in my division; our team didn't too well, but that's okay. It was fun and a great experience! At shooting, almost half the air pistol competitors were Pony Club members from COR, WOR and SLOV who also compete in the sport of Tetrathlon.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about my first Ontario Winter Games was the new friendships I made and the old friends I saw. Everyone was really friendly and we had a great time playing 'Guitar hero"
