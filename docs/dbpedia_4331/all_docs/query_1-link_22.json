        "text": "The Jockey Club of Canada hosted the 49th annual Sovereign Awards ceremony April 18 where Beverly D. Stakes (G1T) winner Fev Rover landed the Horse of the Year honor and was named champion female turf horse.\n\nThe top three finalists in each category are determined by the online ballots of the Jockey Club of Canada's knowledgeable voters. The media category award finalists were determined by media professionals within the industry selected from across North America.\n\nThe Jockey Club of Canada is pleased to announce the 2023 Sovereign Award winners in the order in which they were presented.\n\nSpecial Sovereign Award: ROBERT \"RED\" MCKENZIE\n\nAfter more than 80 years working in horse racing in Alberta, you might think that Robert 'Red' McKenzie has done it all. A former jockey, and then successful trainer, who has won some 1,600 races, Robert landed in the record books the evening of June 23, 2023 when his mare Entitled Star won a claiming race at Century Mile. At the age of 96, he became the oldest trainer to saddle a winner in Canadian racing history when his mare circled the field as the longest shot on the board at 25-1.\n\nConsidering Thoroughbred racing statistics are hard to come by before 1976, the official number of winners for Robert as a jockey, trainer, and owner, could be much higher than 1,600. But what is known is that the Alberta resident, who was born Jan. 1, 1927, was still bringing horses over to race in 2023. Robert loved horses and started riding at the age of 10 at a riding academy in Edmonton. He accompanied his father and sister to the racetrack and started riding races at bush tracks such as Ponoka, Rimbey, and Red Deer. When he turned 16 and was old enough to ride the 'A' tracks, he would travel throughout the Western Canada Association which included tracks in Calgary, Winnipeg, Edmonton, and Saskatoon.\n\nMedia Awards\n\nOutstanding Writing: JENNIFER MORRISON\n\nCat's Long Way Home\n\nPublished Dec. 31, 2023 on Canadian Thoroughbred.com\n\nOutstanding Photograph: JASON HALSTEAD\n\nA Kiss for Commando\n\nPublished: Sept. 22, 2023 in The Inside Track Issue #98\n\nOutstanding Audio Visual/Digital Broadcast: WOODBINE ENTERTAINMENT\n\nSecretariat The Last Race\n\nAired on TSN Oct. 8, 2023\n\nOutstanding Groom: MICHELLE ARMATA\n\nBeing from one of the most successful racing families in Canada, horse racing is an integral part of Michelle Armata. Her father, Joe, was a trainer at Woodbine and Michelle would often visit the stable, despite being a bit scared of horses when she was young.\n\nMichelle studied early childhood education in the latter part of her school years, working toward her diploma, until one day she decided her life was with horses. There was a litany of family members at Woodbine by then, including brother Steve and sister Josie. She was in her 20s when she started working there, first for Joe, and then for Steve. \"My brother and his wife Sharon taught me a lot about grooming horses,\" said Michelle. \"I was taught horsemanship the old school way.\"\n\nAfter leaving the track to start a family—she has two children with her husband, trainer Ross Armata, Jr.—Michelle returned to work for her brother-in-law, Mike De Paulo and his wife and assistant, Josie, Michelle's sister.\n\nOutstanding Off-track Worker: JENNIFER BUCK\n\nThe inaugural Outstanding Off-Track Worker Award was presented to Jennifer Buck, who has been with Adrian Munro's Highfield Stock Farm in Okotoks, Alberta, since 2013.\n\nThe Jockey Club of Canada introduced the Outstanding Off-Track Worker Award as a way to honor the unsung heroes who make Thoroughbred racing in Canada possible through their hard work and dedication at off-track thoroughbred racing, training, boarding, breeding, sales, and aftercare farms and facilities.\n\nJennifer, who was born in Ontario, learned to ride horses at a young age when living in Connecticut. Once settled in Alberta as a teenager, she worked for Glenview Stables and manager Brian Ferguson, a Windfields Farm alumni, learning the intricacies of farm management, from painting fences to barn care. She pursued performing arts in school at Mount Royal and worked as a fly-fishing guide on the famous Bow River, which she still does today.\n\nBut the lure of horses was too strong. While raising her son Hunter, Jennifer went to work at the famed Bar None Ranches for Mike Vanin. She also had a love for working with polo horses and she played at the Calgary Polo Club before moving over to Highfield.\n\nChampion 2-year Old Female: WITWATERSRAND\n\nTrainer: Mark Casse\n\nOwner: Gary Barber\n\nBreeder: G.

But, it has been in the breeding shed where the Ontario-bred has really left her mark. From five foals, each of which have run and won, her progeny earnings stand at just more than $1.2 million.\n\nMendocino Beano's highest earner is Tone Broke, who captured two-thirds of the 2019 Canadian Triple Crown and finished third in that year's Queen's Plate Stakes on his way to amassing more than $500,000 in earnings. She also produced grade 3 winner Millie Girl, overnight stakes winner Stallion Heiress, and the stakes-placed winner Conquest Fleetfeet.\n\nVote: Mendocino Beano (74), Sunday Affair (54), Game (31)\n\nOutstanding Breeder: ADENA SPRINGS\n\nIn Canada:\n\nStarters 42; Winners 19\n\nEarnings $1,934,913\n\nStarts 221; Wins 27; 2nd 33; 3rd 28\n\nFrank and Frieda Stronach's legendary Adena Springs North, in Aurora, Ontario, was voted Outstanding Breeder for the 13th time, more than any other Canadian breeder in the history of the Sovereign Awards. The Adena Springs-bred star of 2023 was again Moira, the 2022 Horse of the Year who came back at 4 and won the Canadian Stakes (G2T) at Woodbine. Campaigned by Madaket Stables, SF Racing, and X-Men Racing, Moira placed in four graded stakes at Woodbine before ending her season with an impressive third-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf (G1T) at Santa Anita Park.\n\nThe debut victory by their homebred filly Shamans Girl in the $150,000 Shady Well Stakes was a highlight. A daughter of Adena stallion Shaman Ghost , by Ghostzapper , Shamans Girl is out of the Stronachs' 2008 Woodbine Oaks-winning mare, Ginger Brew.

Her impressive win total at Woodbine, 88, put her fourth in the rider standings behind reigning champion Kazushi Kimura, Sahin Civaci, and Rafael Hernandez, and ahead of champions Emma-Jayne Wilson and Patrick Husbands.\n\nVives also rode at Parx Racing. Born in Walterboro, S.C., and raised in horse country in Ocala, Fla., Vives followed her father, former jockey Lazaro Vives, to the barns of dual Hall of Famer Mark Casse, who gave Vives a leg up to start her riding career.

He was also the Eclipse Award outstanding apprentice jockey in 2019. It has been a smooth transition for Kazushi as a journeyman and in 2023, he won more races at Woodbine than he ever has and set a personal best for purse money.
