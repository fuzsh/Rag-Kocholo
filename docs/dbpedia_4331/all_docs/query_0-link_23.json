        "text": "Canadaâs Thoroughbred Racing Newspaper The Game, January 2007 29 Toronto Thoroughbred Racing Clubâs President, Sam Lima (right), presents Don Burton with a sculp- ture in appreciation of his 44 years of dedication to the Club. Don Burton joined the TTRC in 1962, the year after the Club was founded. He has been the auditor for 44 years, as well as being an editor of the Monthly TTRC Bulletin for 20 or more years along with a 5 year stint as President. âDon can tell you anything about the club and the he loves the sport.â Sam spoke enthusiastically about his long-time friend, âHe has been a tremendous value to the club for so many years.â Around The Racetrack Don accepted by saying, âIt has been great to be a part of the Club. We have a hard working group of people and I hope there are many more years of success. Many thanks for this recognition.â The Toronto Thoroughbred Racing Club meets at Woodbine on the first Wednesday of every month during live racing. For more information on becoming a member for 2007 call 416-239-2236. Trainer Frank Passero Jr. (right) and former Jockey Agent Colin Wick âWickseyâ reminisce about the past as they leave Woodbine on the final day of thoroughbred racing in 2006. Colinâs jockeys were aboard for many wins for Frank Passero Jr., namely Sandy Hawley, Brian Swatuk; Robbie King Jr.; Robin Platts; Mickey Walls and Jim McAleney. âThere are hundreds of races that he put my jockeys on and made them famous.â said a complimentary Wick. Futural Retirement Continued from Page 5 On July 28, 2006 Futural entered his final race and once again his true determination led to victory. âHe went out a champion and he deserves that,â said Milburn. Futural finished his career with a record of 12 wins, 15 seconds and 8 thirds from 70 starts with lifetime earnings of $816,107. Milburnâs longtime partner, Minna Rytkonen phoned Barrett and informed her of Futuralâs retirement. âKatey was really excited. She really did most of the work,â said Rytkonen, âShe was talking with Michael Blowen at Old Friends back and forth and thatâs how it all happened and Futural is going to a great retirement home. Heâs going to meet up with Kudos, a horse he raced with in California. Itâll be like meeting his old friend,â President of Old Friends Retirement Facility, Michael Blowen, is very excited about the arrival of Futural. âWe are really looking forward to receiving him. It was really because of Katey Barrett and the people at Hastings that this is taking place. Weâre just trying to get some of his race tapes now to show to the people taking the tours,â said Blowen. Old Friends Retirement Facility is very active with as many as four free tours a day for the public to visit these past champions. âWe recently added a Bed and Breakfast right on the farm for visitors,â said Blowen. According to Blowen, jockey Chris McCarron, who rode Futural many times (including the fateful Hollywood Gold Cup) is also excited about Futuralâs arrival. âChris told me heâs going to come visit in the next day or two. He told me he had finished second eight times in a row in the Hollywood Gold Cup and then he won on Futural only to be moved to third. When I spoke to him He said he was excited about seeing his old friend again,â said Blowen. On Dec.13, Futural arrived at Old Friends and began his retirement. âHeâs a fabulous horse. Heâs so easy to be around. He has already become one of the favorites. I mean heâs so handsome. He is going to popular here at Old Friends,â said Blowen. The big chestnut with the bossy personality at Hastings is now the talk of the town in Georgetown, Kentucky. Thatâs the only way Futural would have it. NORTH AMERICAN STAKES SERVICES Stakes Schedules & Closing Dates Includes information from all racetracks in North America 1-866-886-5827 stacie@nastakes.com www.nastakes.com BC & Alberta Stallions - Continued from Previous Page We see no reason why he wonât attract the same quality of mares as he has in the past.â High expectations for a horse in his autumn stage, but worth noting as they come from the Andersons, top-notch B.C. breeders. Canmor Stables is the other home of B.C.âs leading sires of 2006. In fact, control of the provinceâs top five earners is almost evenly divided between Ternes Farm and Canmor. Stephanotis, advertised on the web as âone of Western Canadaâs hottest young sires,â appears among the most promising of his stable mates. âStephanotis has had a very solid year,â says Ole Nielsen, owner/operator of Canmor Stables. âHe doesnât have the number of runners that the others have, but he still managed to rank #2 on the top B.C. sire list.â In 2006, his progeny boast- ed average earnings per starter of $13,255 and average earnings per start of $2,152. These numbers may have been even higher had his main offspring, Notis Otis, performed to capacity. âNotis had some hard luck this year and the year before,â says Nielsen of the 2004 champion two-year-old. âWe do, however, have high hopes for him in 2007.â In the meantime, Hurry an Notis came in second in the B.C.âs Breeders Cup. âStephanotis has a great crop of two- year-olds on the way,â predicts Nielsen. âHis future prospects, especially in Western Canada, are very bright.â On the opposite end of the age spectrum at Canmor is 22-year-old Regal Intention. The stallion entered stud in 1991 and has had a long, distinguished career, with twenty-four Stakes winners to date. From his progeny heâs collected over $12 million, and in 2005, he took the Leading Two-Year-Old Sire in B.C. award from Vying Victor. Trick broke out very well at Hastings this year, and theyâre sure to be competitive as two-year-olds in 2007. Mazel Trick sires horses with speed, which makes him ideal for the 5/8-mile track at Hastings.â It will be interesting to see how Mazel Trick factors into the B.C. sire scene when he settles down to business in his new home. In Alberta, top sire honors went to Kiridashi, son of 2006 Canadian Horse âHeâs a good, good, good - and I repeat good - old sire,â says Nielsen. âThough heâs getting on in years, heâs still getting the job done.â In 2006, his progeny earned $696,770, a significant drop from 2005 ($1,098,426). Still, Nielsen states that âif you want a really solid horse who can sprint and route, Regal Intention can get that done for you over the years.â In September, Mazel Trick joined Canmorâs stallion roster, and he arrived at the top of his game with five Sakes horses in 2006 (three of which were winners). In terms of progeny average earnings for the year and progeny average earnings per start, Mazel Trick outshone his stable mates: $19,226 and $3,024, respectively. 1) Vying Victor, 1989 2) Stephanotis, 1993 3) Katahaula Country, 1988 4) Regal Intention, 1985 5) Mass Market, 1997 6) Dixieland Brass, 1986 7) Alfaari, 1989 8) Few dEnfer, 1980 9) Silver Fox, 1991 10) Western Trick, 1987 11) Yoonevano, 1995 Leading Stallions: Alberta 1) Kiridashi, 1992 2) General Royal, 1994 3) Captain Bodgit, 1994 4) Alydeed, 1989 5) Regal Remark, 1982 Wins Stakes 58 3 32 2 35 4 38 1 15 0 24 3 17 0 18 1 16 0 13 0 12 1 Wins Stakes 32 2 45 2 50 0 38 0 31 3 Earnings $1,474,156 $748,250 $780,299 $696,770 $506,655 $474,790 $363,135 $337,748 $280,085 $270,807 $235,758 Earnings $1, 545,983 $1,450,722 $1,304,804 $1,020,468 $679,027 âWeâre very excited about Mazel Trick,â says Nielsen. âWeâve had our eyes on him for years, but he wasnât for sale.â One horseplayerâs misfortune is anotherâs gain, as Mazel Trickâs availability to Canmor and subsequent move from south of the border only came after his owners died in a helicopter accident. âHe hasnât had a B.C. crop yet,â Nielsen says, âbut Mazel Star and Hazel Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Bold Ruckus. Kiridashi entered stud in 1999 and has since racked up close to $7 million in earnings. A close second, in terms of 2006 earnings, was General Royal ($1,450,722), and close on his heals were Captain Bodgit ($1,263,224) and Alydeed ($1,020,468). With a few more solid seasons, Alydeed could crack $20,000,000 in lifetime earnings. Leading Stallions: British Columbia"
