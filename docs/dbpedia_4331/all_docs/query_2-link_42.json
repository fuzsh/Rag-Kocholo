        "text": "Jonathan and Laura Ayers\n\nJonathan’s family moved inland after he was born in Southern California, and he didn’t really find himself until he lived in Wyoming. Laura was raised where she and Jonathan live now, deep in Armstrong Woods, on land her father bought for its timber. As a girl, she rode her horse on wildlife trails amidst majestic trees, where she also learned to drive a logging truck by the time she was eleven.\n\nThey both traveled extensively as young adults, and it was on an international trip that Laura and Jonathan first met before continuing on separate paths, but they’d meet again.\n\nLaura came back to Sonoma County 45 years ago to homestead her family’s land. Jonathan made his way back via a Wyoming pack operation, a Texas cattle ranch, and a breeding operation in California, which is where he was when he tracked down Laura and reestablished their connection. They’ve been together since.\n\nIn the early eighties, their shared love of nature and horses came together—or, as Jonathan describes, “we had one horse, then another, then, suddenly we had a lot of horses!” A vendor approached the park service about doing horseback rides in the park, then came to them and said, “if we’re going to let someone do that, though, we prefer that be you.”\n\n30-years later, Armstrong Woods Pack Station had guided 25,000 people across 25,000 miles of trails through Sonoma County’s greatest nature area. They also found time to teach six-hundred Camp Newman kids how to ride and learn from horses. They did the same thing for a different group, creating and operating a program for adults with serious limitations resulting from traumatic illness, accidents, and other life-altering ailments. Jonathan recalls, “I’ve learned a lot, and my horse, Dox Why Worry, he was the boss, taught me more than I could have ever learned on my own. We had the opportunity to open that experience to others who might not ever have known what horses can do for us. Working with those challenged adults changed them, and it changed me too.”\n\nThey recently ended the pack operation, closing a decades-long chapter in their lives. Their legacy now resides in the memories of those lucky enough to have experienced once in a lifetime trail rides, and with those who, for a brief moment, left their limitations in the dust of special horses, led by very special guides.\n\nAmber Bowen, D.V.M.\n\nHer 1967 Ford Mustang is her only horse right now, but Amber has never had a shortage of animals, going back to Missy—“Pissy Missy,” as Amber fondly calls her—a paint pony she found walking along Ross Road and took home to Forestville. “Dad said if you have a horse you need a trailer, so I found an ad for one and talked the guy down to one-hundred-and-twenty-dollars.” Amber was all of twelve.Solutions came easy to Amber, like acing college-level math in grammar school. She went from El Molino to Cal Poly for a BS in physics and a Masters in agriculture, then graduated from UC Davis vet school.\n\nAmidst all that learning, she co-founded International Veterinary Outreach in 2011, a nonprofit providing free veterinary care and education to developing countries. She’s taken vet teams to the Philippines several times, and Nicaragua.But she always wanted to get back home. After work in Australia, Southern California and Florida, she came back, worked two years with a Sonoma County practice, and then went out on her own. There’s no transition here that can easily take us back to October 9th, so we’re going right to the fairgrounds: After a night evacuating her own, friends’, and clients’ animals, Amber arrived at the fairgrounds the next morning to treat a colic. She and Horse Council board member, Dr. Ted Stashak, organized sheltering even as they evaluated a stream of arriving horses and other animals. For two weeks she coordinated hundreds of volunteers, vaccinated, put biosecurity protocols in place, dealt with strangles, colic, corona virus, and treated injured animals. From her education and experience, she knew “mass animal emergencies are as much about humans as animals; human management is a necessity.” 50-percent of the people there are her clients, and other clients, friends, the Office of Emergency Services, everyone showed up and asked, ‘what do you need?’ Her husband, Martin, was out of the country, and her parents moved their trailer to the fairgrounds so Amber didn’t have to leave. The Equus Awards focuses on a nominee’s history and accomplishments, but Amber’s depth of experience and actions under fire deservedly flip that focus, as best described by her nominators: “her calm control of the situation, compassion, vet skills, and patient empathy minimized animals’ and owners’ anxiety during a historic evacuation…she is already an exceptional member of our equestrian community.”\n\nMichael Murphy\n\nOn top of, or working behind a horse, Michael Murphy is the go-to guy for many people in this room. He’s got an expertise that has become incredibly important, even high profile, in this day of sustainability and the environment. And he’s all ours.\n\nHe’s a long way from his Mississippi upbringing, the brother to 6 younger sisters. Yikes. He was outta the south not too long after graduating with an environmental planning degree, reaching the freedomland of San Francisco in 1970. Working part-time day jobs and playing in bands at night, he moved north over the next few years until he reached Sebastopol, where he bought his first horse. Then, with all that horse experience to guide him, he quickly bought another. Yikes, again.\n\nGathering riding experience through rides and joining the Backcountry Horseman of California, he began to grow his niche business, um, we’ll call it waste management. An easy talker, he became known throughout Northern California, talking with horse owners, ranchers, cattleman and stable owners, and arrived in the perfect place to lead them as a future of one-sided, complex water and waste management regulations threatened to overwhelm the local horse and dairy industries.\n\nYou heard it earlier: conversations turned to meetings, meetings created consensus, and Michael laid those planks that became the Horse Council’s foundation. But he also infused that creation with the right qualities, ensuring that agendas or vendettas were put aside, positioning the Council as an organization to get things done, and work with government, not against it.\n\nHe might have come a little later to horses than many of us, but he caught up fairly quickly, joining with riding clubs, working with open space districts, and putting his own family roots deep into Sonoma County. The trails he took to get here don’t matter to us as much as that he got here, and without his professional expertise, from creating plans for stables or thousand-acre dairy operations, to spreading the word about the Horse Council and working to protect our unique place, we’d be knee deep in… well, we’d be knee deep in it.\n\nHe’s one of our own, the guy in the wide-brimmed hat who led the parade of concerned, disgruntled cowboys and cowgirls into a future that brought us all here tonight. He could probably write a book about it all, if he’d stop movin’ and talkin’ long enough to do it.\n\nHe is, essentially, the man who got us here. Thanks, Michael Murphy.\n\nSue Curry Shaffer\n\nThe only thing more winning than Sue Curry Shaffer’s accomplishments may be her smile, and the only things she might wish for, are more hours in the day. Born in Ohio and raised in Pennsylvania, she bought her first horse when she was barely 13 and did anything necessary to keep it. She rode during college, where she “fell in love with dressage,” got her degree in equine studies, and had her own horse business in Colorado at 22. In 1985, she and her horse, Orpheus, were number 1 in the U.S. Dressage Federation rankings at Prix-St.-Georges, and long listed for the World Championships and Olympics.\n\nShe moved here in 1992—“because,” she says, “I was freezing,”—started a new business with 9 horses, and with her husband, Dyke Shaffer, founded Fairwind Farm in 1999. Over the course of a decade, importing horses from Germany and growing her breeding operation, 40 horses, including several historic stallions, delivered more than 40 foals. Her magnificent, foundational stallion, Donnerschlahg, lived to be 30.\n\nMatching her accomplishments on horses and breeding horses, she has become both an esteemed judge and teacher of judges. From her start as a judge at 21, she’s now a U.S.E.F. ’S’ dressage judge, a retired FEI para equestrian judge, and in 2017 was the only candidate selected to be a U.S.E.F. ‘L’ program faculty member, teaching judges. And she just heard that she has been picked to judge the 2018 U.S. Dressage Finals in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nOn competing, she says, “I like it, don’t love it.” What does she love? Obviously horses, and, well, all animals, evident from her nominators’ description or rescues, “from rescued dogs and cats, to chickens and, occasionally, humans.” What she really loves “Teaching. I love teaching the most.” She prefers to swing any spot light away from her accomplishments and onto the dressage students she trains, riders she has helped qualify for regional and state championships, and who have earned their bronze, silver, and gold medals.\n\nWe’re often judged by the company we keep. She is surrounded by students who love her, and nationally ranked dressage and event trainers who board at Fairwind. Their praise is universal, but not for her accomplishments as much for how much of herself, her experience, and her riding wisdom, she continues to share with her community. She could certainly relax, if she chose to. She doesn’t have anything to prove, but she won’t, because ask her about her overbooked life and schedule of clinics and classes, she smiles and says, “I’m very, very happy.”\n\nPete Mattioli\n\nFormer Equus Honoree Pete Mattioli’s life goes from San Francisco nightclubs to champion cutting horses, but it was his strong view that stable and riding operators speak as one voice that placed him in the center of the Horse Council’s formation.\n\nPete’s has entertained us with stories about his San Francisco club, or the Oakland Raiders riding at his and Benita’s Double Bar M Ranch—one of the early, largest stable operations in the county.\n\nHe’s always been a handshake, man-of-his-word guy—respect people, be honest and fair, the attributes of a good cowboy. His horse world started as business in the seventies, which eventually thrived due to the champion genes of his horse Cal Bar, described by The Quarter Horse Journal as, “Joe Montana, Magic Johnson and Mozart all rolled in to one.”\n\nIn the early 90s, before the county recognized the economic contributions of our horse-related businesses, local government proposed regulations and oversight initiatives that many stable owners thought were, well, let’s just describe them as things with which stable owners took issue. Pete’s position in the equine community was well established, and as things got stirred up, Pete bent, or more likely burned, then Riding and Driving board member Michael Murphy’s ear about the need to ‘help the county understand’ the value of the horse community. As Pete said, “We need to be organized, we got to look out for ourselves.”\n\nPhone lines heated up, word got around, there was a large meeting and shortly thereafter the equine community came together like never before. The birth of an organization usually begins with a chorus of ‘we need to get this done.’ Pete Mattioli was the prominent, foundational voice in that early chorus. But the chorus needed a director.\n\nPete Mattioli, Ed Weber and Michael Murphy\n\nThe details of 25 years ago are a bit faded, but there is unanimous agreement that Michael Murphy, also 2018 Equus honoree, hooked up the horses to this wagon now known as the Horse Council.\n\nIn 1993, when that meeting with Pete and a handful of other concerned horse people grew into a full room at the Sebastopol Veterans Hall, Michael knew their concerns not just because he knew everyone, and not just because of his expertise in the backside of a horse, and out of the backside too, but because he was smart, engaging, and informed about the issues.\n\nThe crowd agreed unanimously to organize, and then, there were those looks around the room, and the realization—we need a leader. You can ask Michael for the details after the show, but all eyes turned his way, him being the guy who had brought all these men and women together—a majority of women, according to Michael—and while he doesn’t remember his exact words, he believes they were something like. “Okay.” He led the way to filing our nonprofit status in 1995, and here we are a quarter century after that meeting, and this damn Horse Council continues to gallop across this Sonoma County landscape. This all leads us to another founder who came down the trail just a tad later.\n\nHow did a south side Chicago kid become so instrumental in the growth of the Horse Council? Ed Weber says he was born looking for a pony. When he finally made his way to Northern California, he used his professional television production expertise to create the first issues of the Horse Journal.\n\nThere aren’t any ‘ranches’ in Chicago, but there are places to ride, and twelve year-old Ed Weber wanted to be so like his favorite Saturday morning cowboys that he once stole twelve dollars from his mom’s purse so he could ride a horse. He went right from college to the television industry at a local television station, and bought his first horse, Sunny. He sold Sunny when he moved to take a new television job, won an Emmy in 1968, and balanced his career ascent with horse ownership whenever he could, eventually making his way to Northern California in 1978 and raising two children.\n\nMr. Ed finally got his first Sonoma county horse, Willie, in 1984, a relationship he describes as, “we both needed a little work.” A decade later, that ‘we both needed a little work’ might still have applied, depending upon who you ask, when Ed met Michael Murphy. The two became riding friends, and one day Michael asked Ed to join the Horse Council Board.\n\nEd sensed a need to make the equine community more aware of the Council’s efforts. Taking on a managing editor’s role, with art direction by Carol Bolum, they created the first versions of the Horse Journal magazine. Benita Mattioli scored advertisers, circulation increased, membership grew, and the Horse Council was energized.\n\nHis concern for everything ‘horse’ is evident in his awareness of equine-related issues throughout the county, and the Bodega Bay Trailhead may be Ed’s most notable accomplishment. His efforts eventually transformed a pot-holed, overgrown mess into an accessible and workable space to unload horses for rides through beautiful coastal dunes.\n\nHe created what is arguably the Horse Council’s most prominent, instantly recognizable ambassador, and when this seventy-five year-old, horse riding, guitar playing, tennis team captain says, “I still haven’t stopped doing and caring,” we say, “Lucky for us, Mr. Ed.”\n\nStan Fonsen\n\nStan Fonsen was born on a cattle ranch in Willets, and the ranching lifestyle exposed him to animals and developed his love for horses. The training facet of his life began when he was about 19 years old and working on the Ridgewood Ranch, home of Seabiscuit. Fonsen remembers, \"There was a man there named Al Payne, who was my first mentor.\" After attending Cal Poly, Stan moved to Petaluma and married Marti. He competed in rodeos, taught riding lessons, and started colts in his spare time.\n\nJust after beginning to train full time, he won the 1971 Cow Palace Reserve Championship. Stan also won the very first NRCHA Hackamore Maturity. The biggest pleasure futurity in the '70s and '80s was in Santa Rosa, and he had an outstanding barn. Stan and Marti swept the 2- and 3-year-old championships. Only three years after starting his full-time training operation, Stan competed in his first Snaffle Bit Futurity and nailed third place, and in 1976 he won the reserve championship. That year, he also won the Bakersfield Hackamore Championship. In '79 Stan won the Cow Palace Bridle Horse.\n\nBut 1983 would be Stan's biggest year. Stan and Doc's Ruby Girl ran away with the title in the Snaffle Bit Maturity of the California Reined Cow Horse Association. The same year, Im Full Of Pep and Stan captured one of the greatest titles in the performance horse industry, the Snaffle Bit Futurity. In 1983 Stan also won the West Coast Quarter Horse Association Pleasure Horse Futurity, and in 1984 he won the Cow Palace Snaffle Bit Futurity on Lei Aloha. In 1985 the pair returned to the Cow Palace to win the Hackamore Championship.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999 Stan contested nearly every Snaffle Bit Futurity and made the finals all but once, and he's equally as tough in the cutting horse pen. He's consistently made the PCCHA Finals in the aged events, and he's trained and shown some of the industry's greatest horses while coaching top riders.\n\nIn addition to decades of training, showing and winning, Stan has served as an AQHA judge for more than 15 years. He's judged at the open, amateur and youth divisions at the World Show and has traveled around the world judging competitions. In 2001, Stan was honored with the Pacific Coast Cutting Horse Association's prestigious Dave McGregor Award for outstanding horsemanship and leadership skills in the cutting horse arena.\n\nIn 2004, he was inducted into the National Reined Cow Horse Hall of Fame. Stan and Marti have recently moved to their ranch to Potter Valley, where they're enjoying a much more laid-back lifestyle while breeding and raising some fantastic cutting horses.\n\nEd Laney\n\nEd Laney receives the Equus Award for his achievements as a role model and teacher in Sonoma County's farrier trade, and for his extraordinary caring for the wild horse. Ed was one of the first shoers certified by the American Farriers Association (AFA) in the 1980s. In his very first blacksmithing and horseshoeing contest in Carson City, Nev., in his first attempt, Ed swept the division 2 competition and moved up to the highest, division 3.\n\nToday, Ed Laney is one of only a few who have been classified by AHA as a \"certified journeyman farrier.\" But there is still more to the man. At age 69, his photographs of nature and horses have begun to gain him newfound fame. You can see them in gallery at the Pacific Arts Center in Healdsburg.\n\nEd was born in Utah and raised in Idaho. Four generations of Laney blacksmiths came before him. He remembers in 1948, at the ripe old age of 9, that he and his cousin Butch tried to trim their first horse. They wanted to ride Chico, a favorite small blue-eyed horse. They trimmed him so close his feet were sore. After catching the dickens for their mistake, they had to turn Chico out to pasture and be satisfied with riding the workhorses he rest of the summer.\n\nHe's always considered the \"high desert\" his place of origin. While packing in the high country where Oregon and California share state borders, he discovered hardy herds of wild horses. These were tougher and warier than their lowland counterparts, he realized, and he's returned many times to photograph and study these wild horses, which thrive in the arid environment above 4.000 feet. \"You can't hide or sneak up on these horses,\" Ed says. \"They know when you're near.\" But the herds have allowed him to get closer over his years of visits. \"The frogs of their feet are thick and wide, and the hoof walls grow longer to contact the ground and raise the sole,\" he notes.\n\nIn the early '60s, Ed seized the chance to work with legendary Sonoma County horseshoer Maurice (Mossy) Fitzpatrick. Mossy was one of the old-school shoers, and Ed learned much from him. Ed decided to move to Sonoma County, realizing the diversity of horse activity and seizing the opportunity to learn from some great farriers. In those days, the Sonoma County fairgrounds were a year-round training facility. Ed shod everything from gaited horses to Thoroughbreds to harness race horses.\n\nHe spent the next 35 years learning all he could by shoeing Sonoma County's ever-expanding variety of horses. Ed remembers what he learned from an earlier group of local farriers, including Saul Benelli, who made barn calls in a tiny Nash Metropolitan with the trunk lid removed; and Joe Pike, Harold Young and Bruce Northridge. He likes and respects Stuart Greenberg and his SRJC farrier program; he remembers shoeing Fred McMurray's horses for nearly 30 years, and he considers his horse \"bible\" to be the Wagner Stock Manual, first published in1887. Observes Ed, \"Basic principles never change.\"\n\nRay Valladao\n\nRay Valladao is the real deal, the \"cowboy in the white hat\" for Sonoma County. A long time member of the Back Country Horsemen's North Bay Unit, Ray is considered by his hard-working peers to be the best planner and most productive hand that group has ever seen. For more than a decade, Ray has acted on his belief that he would earn respect for equestrians by delivering benefits to the state and county park systems and other local land stewards. We have him to thank for many of the hundreds of miles of developed horse trails in Sonoma County. He not only has negotiated for us as parks are being developed; he gets his hands dirty cutting trails, side by side with park employees. He has organized volunteers to expand the work force, acting, always with humility, as lead worker, installing hitching rails and building all those recycling manure bunkers in Sonoma County parks, so appreciated and used by local rose growers.\n\nAs Public Lands Representative of the North Bay Chapter Ray's heartfelt advocacy has produced untold benefits for all horse and stock users of California's backcountry. It might be difficult to find a Sonoma County trail rider who hasn't run into Ray on the trail. He always offers a friendly greeting, and often helps newer riders get oriented. Following some personal challenges, last year Ray sold his horse, Sox, and his friendly smile and helpful ways haven't been seen as much lately on local trails.\n\nThis Equus Award is the Horse Council's way to let Ray know we need him back in the saddle, again!\n\nGene Harlan\n\nGene Harlan, DVM, is a recipient of this year's Equus Award to honor his amazing sensitivity and dedication to the health care of horses and other agricultural animals. Gene is a serious Sonoma County cattle rancher who was raised in Fresno County on a dairy and beef farm. His early interest in horses and animal health led to a job as a teenage veterinary technician, assisting his early mentor, Dr. C.D. Cooper. He first earned his bachelor's degree in quantitative biology at U.C. Davis, and then graduated from the renowned veterinary school there in 1973. Two of his college summers were spent packing professionally in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n\nDuring his college years, Gene supported himself by shoeing horses. He recalls that his girlfriends weren't too impressed, though, when they heard horseshoes unromantically clanging around in the back of his station wagon. He still prefers to shoe his own horses. After completing his internship in equine and bovine reproduction at U.C. Davis in 1974, Gene was hired by Dr. Bill Kortum at the Cotati Large Animal Clinic. Dr. Harlan has been a partner in the business for the past 33 years. He established the \"Preceptor Program\" at the Cotati Clinic, which allows vet students at U.C. Davis to intern at the clinic for a year. This program receives veterinary interns from all over the world, and the clinic has recently welcomed students from Iraq and Kenya.\n\nGene Harlan is dedicated to our Sonoma County community, where he's volunteered as president of the local Cattlemen's Association and served as vice chairman of animal health for the California Cattleman's Association. He's been a Sonoma County 4-H leader for the past 33 years. For the past 15 years, Gene has served on the Agricultural Committee for the California Veterinary Association. He also is an animal health advisor for the California Department of Food and Agriculture.\n\nKris Hout\n\nKristine Huot receives an Equus Award this year for her dedication to children and for the hard work she did to earn her special place in the equestrian world. She spent 32 years teaching history and science in Sonoma County K-12 schools, and she's been a competitive rider and trainer since her early college years. She owns and operates Wine Country Riding Academy, in a lovely hillside setting near the Sonoma County Fairgrounds. In a world where customer loyalty is highly valued, many of Kris' students today are children of her former students. Any age and any level of aspiring rider is welcome at her stables.\n\nKris first began to ride her uncle's horses at age 8. When her family moved to Stockton, she began taking saddle seat lessons from Mrs. Clark, who taught her the basics and provided inspiration. Kris rode all through high school and moved on to college in Santa Barbara. By now she was riding hunt seat, and Mrs. Clark gave her a horse to take with her. She spent college summers as a camp counselor and riding instructor. After completing her teaching degree, Kris still didn't have her own horse. So she \"begged and borrowed horses\" until she received a horse as a wedding present, a Thoroughbred named Sea-Bam, an offspring of Seabiscuit.\n\nThe year after her graduation, she came to Sonoma County. It took a while to get settled, but in 1970 Kris moved to her current horse property. She ponied and exercised racehorses at the fairgrounds and gave riding lessons on weekends. She also competed in endurance racing and eventing. After retiring, she trained and taught at Double Bar M Ranch for several years, while she also supported the Sonoma State intercollegiate equestrian team, often lending her own horses for students to show. In 1999 Kris built a new arena, and today she teaches the next generation of equestrians at her own ranch.\n\nNancy Smith Kasovich\n\nNancy Smith Kasovich began taking riding lessons at age 4, inspired when her grandmother began to take her to watch international polo at Golden Gate Park. The stables at the park then housed polo and stock horses, Saddlebreds, hunter/jumpers and racehorses. Nancy earned the chance to ride, and later to show, a wide variety of horses there for their owners, an opportunity rarely available in today's specialized world.\n\nIn 1956, Nancy married Bob Smith, an outstanding polo player whom she'd first admired at the Golden Gate Park stables. Together, they operated training stables in Northern and Southern California, specializing in polo, jumping and racehorses. Bob handled polo, and Nancy handled the show ring and the track. In 1959, Nancy followed a client on her hunter in her first Tevis Cup100-mile ride. She quickly learned how much endurance training it really takes for horse and rider to aggressively attack those mountains. She returned a year later and completed the race to earn her Tevis Cup buckle, and she's added five more over the years.\n\nBob and Nancy moved their horse operation to Santa Rosa in 1961. Soon their ranch was teeming with horsey kids who wanted to form a competitive drill team. Nancy enthusiastically trained the Rincon Rider Drill Team, whose riders made quite a name for themselves in both competition and exhibitions. The youngsters became famous for their speed, and the crowds loved them. Nancy also took them on trail rides and saw the need to educate riders on safety and horse care out on the trail. In 1962, Nancy became part of an organization that did just that, the North American Trail Ride Conference (NATRC).\n\nNancy has completed more than 12,000 NATRC miles, presented clinics, and has served three terms as NATRC president. In 1987-'88, when she was battling advanced breast cancer, she continued to compete by scheduling chemotherapy treatments around her riding schedule. Then, in 2005, as vice president of the Sonoma County Mounted Assistance Unit, Nancy rewrote the training requirements for MAU horses. She's now ridden more than 900 MAU hours, patrolling Annadel State Park each week, in all seasons.\n\nNancy served as president of the Sonoma County Driving and Riding Club for 2006 and 2007. It was a challenge she truly enjoyed, especially when the newly formed junior auxiliary chose the name Rincon Riders.\n\nGeorge Snyder\n\nGeorge Snyder is being honored with an Equus Award for his journalistic achievement in publicizing horses and the equestrian culture. His work is particularly relevant because it fulfills the Sonoma County Horse Council's mission to inform the general public of the important social role of horses and horse owners. You might remember a wonderful photo story he wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle a few years ago, about the trail-clearing work of our local back-country horsemen.\n\nGeorge has had an admirable career reporting for the Associated Press, the Sacramento Union, the San Francisco Chronicle, KPIX and KGO-TV. Ask him for the favorite stories of his career, and you'll most likely get a tale involving horses. Like the spring night he spent with rancher and BLM horse-catcher Jim Clapp, up in Modoc County, sitting in the sagebrush, drinking Buds around a fire and spinning horse tales. Or gathering cattle with Rick Baxman on what's now the Willow Creek tract of Sonoma Coast State Beach, with the deep blue ocean as a backdrop for the grazing Herefords.\n\nHe was born December 6, 1944, in New Orleans, La., of a Creole family that truck farmed and sold timber. His family worked a section of land in Natchitoches, which had been in the family since 1836. The property was owned by Joseph Welch, a Scots-Irish, who is George's great-great-grandfather. In addition to that heritage, you'll find in George some Cherokee, Choctaw, Chinese and African American. In a native way of thinking, that blood represents the Four Directions. In another way of thinking, George is a full-blooded American.\n\nGeorge is a Sonoma County resident, married, with four children. He is a horse owner, riding out of the Occidental area. He currently works with the Sonoma West Times and News, where he has published a number of articles about the horse world.\n\nNatlee Kenoyer\n\nNatlee Kenoyer, a Sonoma County equestrian and author, is presented with the Equus Award for living a joyful life surrounded by horses, as a role model for all who dream of horses. Natlee says she's \"a Californian, by birth and by choice.\" She was born in Modesto on March 1, 1907, and just turned 102 years old a few weeks ago.\n\nNatlee's love of horses began when she was 7 and she first rode a burro through Golden Gate Park. And she loved watching the fire horses rushing their water wagons down busy city streets. At the time, San Francisco was still recovering from the destructive earthquake and fire of 1906. Natlee's father bought her a pony when she was 8. Their next-door neighbor gave her a book about riding and said, \"Here, read this. I'm tired of watching you fall off that horse.\" She rode her pony to and from school. Natlee says, \"I'd go anyplace a horse would take me.\" She moved to Sonoma County in the 1960s. Natlee already had a successful career in nursing, but knew she needed to work with horses full time. She trained horses at the Smith Ranch on Highway 12 and at the Perriman Ranch in Geyserville.\n\nIn 1975, Natlee started her own riding school, the \"K-5 Ranch.\" There, she gave riding instruction in English, Western, dressage, jumping, trail riding and gymkhana. She has judged horse shows at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds. Natlee has authored many articles for horse publications and is a member of the Western Writers of America. She has written ten books about horses, including Three Children and a Firehorse, which became a Literary Guild selection. She also authored Gymkhana Games and A Beginner's Guide to the Western Horse. Natlee Kenoyer is a renaissance horsewoman, a part of Sonoma County's equestrian foundation, and is currently writing her autobiography at her residence in Windsor.\n\nDick Dilworth\n\nDick Dilworth earns entry into the Equus Awards Hall of Fame through his lifelong dedication to Sonoma County agriculture. He is admired by many for his Geyserville vineyards, his good nature and willingness to help, and his fine Belgian horses. Dick's father, Norman, was a career police officer for the City of Santa Rosa. His mother, Florence, was a Geyserville native. Florence's father, August McPherson, used horses to work his Sonoma County acreage.\n\nDick spent much of his childhood with his grandparents on the ranch, forming his life's goal to become a farmer, horseman and steward of the land. Dick eventually moved to Geyserville to begin farming. His first team of draft horses, Belgian geldings Chubby and Red, had been used in the filming of Little House on the Prairie. He used his team to work the fields, and in a business he started, Stage a Picnic, where patrons toured vineyards and were treated to gourmet picnic lunches.\n\nIn 1982, Dick Dilworth, Greg Hannan and Bob Donnelly founded the North Bay Draft Horse & Mule Club to preserve the use of draft animals in local agriculture. Even today, horse drawn wagon rides are presented by club volunteers, including Dick's son, Casey, as a popular feature at the Sonoma County Fair. Dick is a Sonoma County Trail Blazer who shares his love of horses and children at the Farm Bureau's annual Kid's Day each spring. He has served as President for the Geyserville School Board, and is currently Battalion Chief for the Geyserville Volunteer Fire Department. He has been a board member of the Alexander Valley Grape Growers. He is a member of the Sonoma County Driving and Riding Club. Dick Dilworth is a true Sonoma County horseman!\n\nDr. Jim Steere\n\nDr. Jim Steere is a most deserving 2007 Equus Award Hall of Fame inductee He is a true renaissance man - athlete, horseman, physician, teacher, student, trail builder, and family man. He is the founding partner of Artaurus Veterinary Clinic, an innovative vet practice with special emphasis on equine health and fitness. The clinic and hospital are recognizable along highway 101 at San Antonio road, near the Marin/Sonoma county line, memorable for its unique and award-winning sod roof.\n\nJim began his life-long journey with animals when, at age nine, his father gave him a horse to ride from the family's desert homestead to a one room elementary school in Rosamond, CA. In high school, he competed in horse shows and worked on local cattle ranches. During WW II, he served in uniform from l942 to 1946, ultimately as an officer in the Air Corps, navigating B29's in the Pacific Theatre. He earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from UC Davis in 1953. Doc Steere is a Fulbright Scholar, and in 1965, he attended Harvard University School of Public Health in Boston and added a Masters' Degree to his credentials.\n\nHe resides in Petaluma and is a member of the Sonoma County Trail Blazers and past President of the Marin Horse Council. He is a dedicated senior athlete, a sporting competitor in endurance horse racing and a role model for all equestrians, as we age. He has participated in the Levi Strauss Ride and Tie Race since 1971, eight years as a competitor, and 26 years as the head veterinarian for the World Championship Ride & Tie Race. He still competes in endurance racing, completing the 100 Mile Tevis Cup in 2005. Being a horse doctor is not work for Doc Steere; for him, It has been a dance with horses for 53 years.\n\nLilo Fore\n\nLiselotte (Lilo) Fore is owner of \"Sporthorse America\" in Santa Rosa. Lilo is being honored with an Equus Award for playing a major role in raising the quality of Dressage training and horses to an international level in Sonoma County. She has offered as many as six Champion stallions at stud at one time, and received national and international awards for Dressage horses from her breeding program. She frequently offers Dressage symposiums and clinics at her Sonoma County facility, delivering uniquely expert Dressage education to the local equestrian community.\n\nShe grew up outside of Dusseldorf, Germany, where, at age four, she saw her first horse. Lilo says \"...from that time on I knew that four legs, a mane and tail would be my life.\" She came to California in 1971 and bought, for one dollar, an injured three year old American Thoroughbred, Dionysus. Under her training, Dionysus not only healed; he became U.S. \"Horse of the Year\" in all national levels. She and Dionysus were selected for the USET short list in 1976. Dionysus was only the first in a succession of Lilo's many hard earned and on-going accomplishments over more than 30 years in Sonoma County. She is the winner of numerous national and international Horse of the Year awards for California, USDF and USET. Her judging credentials include: USEF \"S\" Judge, FEI \"I\" Judge and Sporthorse Breed Judge. She is among the founders and serves as chair of the USDF Instructor-Trainer Certification Program. She is continuously involved in many educational programs for Dressage trainers, teachers and judges throughout the United States.\n\nJoann Slissman\n\nJoann Slissman is being honored with an Equus Award for her many years of promoting horses and agriculture in Sonoma County. She operates the Wyammy Ranch in Occidental, where she has bred Quarter Horses for forty-six years. \"Wyammy\" comes from her younger sister's mix up of \"Wyoming\" and \"Miami.\" Joann took over full responsibility for the family ranch in 1982. She and her sister, Karen, continue to oversee the family business in San Francisco.\n\nJoann's career as an expert equestrian has been shared with many North Bay children and adults to whom she has taught horsemanship. She has practiced \"gentle use\" principles with her horses, even before this approach became mainstream. She volunteered for a decade as a project leader for 4H. Her students have gone on to compete significantly in dressage, steeplechase, and hunter/jumper. One of her star pupils became a top female farrier in the U.S. Joann founded the Occidental Equestriennes over thirty years ago and remains a charter member. She took up cutting at the age of fifty, and enjoys packing in the Emigrant Wilderness in the Sierras for fun and recreation.\n\nShe is past president of the Sonoma County Driving and Riding Club, past president of the Redwood Empire Cutting Horse Association, and a board member of the Vintage Cutting Horse Association. Joann was among the original organizers of the Sonoma County Trails Council.\n\nArt Grunig\n\nArt Grunig is honored with an Equus Award for his outstanding achievements training horses in Western disciplines, general horse training, and for his innovative contributions to equine wellness and performance.

He became a full-time trainer in 1980, then incorporated innovative bodywork with his training in 1986. Art Grunig has studied bodywork in the United States, France, and Italy. His list of credentials include: massage, cranial sacral, visceral manipulation, lymphatic drainage, sports massage, watsu, and tantsu. Art also has developed a form of bodywork called Reflex Balancing.\n\nArt says fairness is the key in his approach to training. He defines fairness as the horse always having a good opportunity to find a way to be happy, comfortable and healthy. All of his techniques, methods, and procedures are based on this philosophy. He has performed his work from coast to coast in the continental US and Hawaii, as well as Mexico, Italy, Ethiopia and the Virgin Islands. Art has trained horses for reining, cutting, working cow horse, western riding, western pleasure, trail, jumping, dressage, gaited horses, jousting, vaulting, driving, and racing.

Both her grandfathers were excellent teamsters \"who could turn 8 horses on a dime.\" She loved horses, and rode whenever she could. She moved to Santa Rosa, met Bob and married him in 1953. They settled down on their dairy ranch, which stood at Stony Point and highway 116.\n\nBob is a native of Petaluma. His dad, Henry, did custom farming with teams of horses. Bob grew up going to local rodeos and fairs, where his dad operated the bucking chutes and ranked well in horse pulling contests. Bob recalls that Andy Devine was a clown at the rodeo, and how Andy took young Bob under his wing, protecting him from the \"rowdy\" cowboys.\n\nIn 1968, Bob bought the dairy from his dad and immediately implemented a top nutritional program for the cows. Feeding top quality hay and a balanced diet, Bob increased daily milk production by 27%. After tripling the herd, Bob sold the cows in 1974 \"for a great price\" and found himself with a barn full of hay. That stack of hay was the first product sold by the new Larsen's Feed and Pet Supply. These days, Larsen's delivers hay, grain and supplements as far north as Sea Ranch and throughout Sonoma and Napa Counties. Son, Kenny Larsen, a SC Trailblazer, carries on the family tradition of owning and driving his Belgian draft horse team for fun and entertainment.\n\nBuzz and Cookie Bozzini\n\nBuzz and Cookie Bozzini are honored as community leaders in promoting good horsemanship and the equestrian way of life in Sonoma County. Together, they have taught countless numbers of kids, teens and adults how to ride and rope over the last three decades. Cookie teaches equitation; Buzz trains teens and adults in roping.\n\nA native of Southern California, Cookie started riding English when she was 7 years old. When she was 10, she was seen on horseback in western movies being filmed in Burbank. She moved to Northern California in the 70's, established the Doubletree Ranch in Sebastopol, and teamed with Buzz in 1976. They opened the tack shop and made the ranch a Sonoma County institution where kids learn about horses.\n\nBuzz was born in San Francisco. He learned to ride and rope in \"Butcher Town,\" where the stockyards were located in the city. He came to Santa Rosa to compete in jackpot roping, met Cookie, and they settled down together.\n\nIn the early 80's, the Bozzinis joined the grass roots discussion that initiated the SCHC. They objected to paying taxes for trails which didn't accommodate horses. Then Supervisor, Ernie Carpenter, told them to get organized. The first meeting was held at Sebastopol's Veterans Memorial Building. Cookie and Buzz have been promoting the horse for many years through organizations such as AQHA, APHA, American Buckskin, Sebastopol Wranglers, PRDC and Novato Horsemen.\n\nMaxine Freitas\n\nMaxine Freitas receives the Equus Award for her life's work, Equi-Ed, now in its twelfth year, which offers an individualized equestrian experience to motivate academic, personal, social and physical growth for students with and without special needs.\n\nEqui-Ed is affiliated with the Adapted Physical Education and Equine Science departments of Santa Rosa Junior College and offers horsemanship instruction, competition opportunities and specialized educational programs for children and adults. Today's Santa Rosa Junior College Agriculture Department offers courses for training in therapeutic riding methods, which are taught by Equi-Ed's Director, Maxine Freitas.\n\nMaxine says the inspiration for Equi-Ed came from her work with a paraplegic, brain injured client who came to her barn out of a desire to be with horses. Amazing and positive changes occurred for the patient in the presence of horses, observed by his entire treatment team, including Maxine Freitas. She then drew upon her education in Therapeutic Recreation and Counseling, and her love of horses, to create a pilot program in 1994.\n\nToday, Equi-Ed has a lovely home in Loch Haven, off Mark West Springs Road. There, students and volunteers conduct sessions in therapeutic horseback riding. Other riders and vaulters come from Sonoma and Napa counties. Maxine has been an instructor in the Equine Science Department at SRJC for 17 years. She has developed the only college level curriculum in therapeutic riding/equine assisted activities, in the State of California.

They recently celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary.\n\nJohn Neves\n\nSanta Rosa's John Neves was nominated for the Equus Award by the Sonoma County Driving and Riding Club (SCDRC). Since the 1980's, John has been recognized as a North Bay leader in developing the positiverelationships today's local equine industry enjoys with local parks and political entities. While John has been instrumental in building and installing so many of the hitching rails, water troughs and other improvements seen today along Sonoma County Trails. It was a near fatal accident in 1997 that raised John's influence on local equestrians to a new level.\n\nHis recovery from the spinal injury that left him fully paralyzed borders on miraculous. Drawing on an incredible drive to survive and his love of people and horses, at nearly 60 years of age, John pulled himself up through excruciating pain and made his injured body respond. He taught himself to walk again. Surrounded by a loving circle of family, friends and supporters, John fought his way back in the saddle and on to the back of his horse.\n\nHe has been both student and volunteer at SRJC and in private riding programs, offering personal insight and demonstrating the possibilities for the disabled to find balance aboard a horse. Still riding Sonoma County trails weekly, John retired this year from the Vice Presidency of the SCDRC, where he has been locating and booking club rides.\n\nRobert H. Walter\n\nA posthumous Equus Award is presented to Robert H. Walter, respected breeder of race horses, benefactor, and a most talented horseman who introduced the sport of Polo to Sonoma County. Mr. Walter passed away at 86 in May of 2003.\n\nBob and Barbara Walter established their Vine Hill Ranch in 1983 and developed it into an award-winning thoroughbred breeding and racing operation. In 1995, two year old filly and two year old colt championships were awarded the Walters, for the first time in California state history to the same owner, breeder, and sire. Bob left most of the breeding decisions to Barbara. He was the consummate horseman whose passion was early training. \"You give a horse balance and agility with the proper developmental program,\" he believed. Bob and Barbara's partnership produced the gelding, Cavonnier, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, who came within a nose of winning the 1996 Kentucky Derby, as well as five California championships and Horse of the Year, returning horse racing fame to Sonoma County and the Walter's Sebastopol ranch.\n\nMr. Walter was well known as a benefactor, making significant contributions in support of music and education. According to Wine Country Polo Club founder, Henry Trione, It was during the 1950s that Bob coaxed Trione and other friends into playing polo-a lifelong passion for Walter since his childhood in Wisconsin.\n\nMr. Walter is survived by his loving wife Barbara, his daughter Cathy, her husband John, and Grandson David. Barbara will accept the Equus Award on behalf of Bob, and continues the family horse racing tradition.\n\nDr. Jack Woolsey\n\nDr. Jack Woolsey joins the Equus Award Hall of Fame in honor of his more than 50 years of caring for the horses and other animals of Sonoma County. Born in San Francisco and raised in Woodland, he grew up riding a cow pony and loving horses. After serving in WWII, he graduated from Veterinary school in Kansas. He finished his education at U.C. Davis, where he taught veterinary medicine for several years. But he longed for his own practice.\n\n\"Doc\" Woolsey opened his first Vet practice in Santa Rosa, which had a population of just 36,000 then, in 1952. He came to know every pay phone in Sonoma County, traveling the backroads day and night to serve his clients. He eventually established his equine practice, Empire Equine Hospital, in Windsor. Doc made the farm calls in the field, while his practice partner, Dr. Norrie, performed in-hospital surgeries. They used 2-way radios, considered state of the art. Doc Woolsey has enjoyed much success raising his beloved racehorses. He also has a long involvement breeding Australian Working Kelpies.\n\nWhen Doc came to Santa Rosa, there were five vets. Now there are around 100 with many specialties. He's proud to have worked with many outstanding vets over the years, including his own daughter, Elizabeth, who now practices and lives in Australia.\n\nDennis Reis\n\nDennis Reis is the founder of the \"National Day of the Horse,\" occurring each December 13th from now on, as passed by Congress, just this past November 18, 2004 by unanimous vote. He first lobbied for and achieved the \"California Day of the Horse,\" which was passed by the California legislature by a unanimous vote June 2002. The outstanding single effort of this local trainer has produced this special day focused on our horses for the entire nation, for which we are all so grateful.\n\nDennis has devoted his life to the practice of horsemanship and is dedicated to improving the horse-human relationship through the sharing of age-old methods. He is an internationally recognized leader and expert in this method of dealing with horses.

Certified Mounted Law Enforcement Instructor, and a Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association Gold Card member.\n\nDeborah Ilene Bailey\n\nDebby Bailey has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for her many years of volunteer work for the Sonoma County equestrian community, and in particular, for her outstanding work in creation and development of the Regional Parks Mounted Assistance Unit (MAU).\n\nDebby was born in Los Angeles, which she insists was a mistake. She yearned for the country life from day one. The only horse she rode as a child was the \"Wonder Horse\" in front of the grocery store.\n\nDebby moved to Sonoma County in 1975 with her husband, Mike. In 1984, Debby and Mike bought their current home in Windsor. Debby chose the house because it came with a horse (her first) in the back yard. Debby joined the State Parks MAU in 1996. She served as President for three years. Debby soon saw a need for a separate unit that focused on the regional parks. She collaborated with Sonoma County, the Regional Parks Rangers, and the State MAU to create a well-organized Regional Parks Mounted Unit. This unit is now over fifty members strong, with more than one hundred horses. As Regional MAU President, she has collaborated with local administration to facilitate equestrian access to open spaces, including Riverfront and Tolay. Debby forged a partnership with Back Country Horseman of California (BCHC), promoting projects that improved equestrian facilities, and earning her BCHC's \"Top Hand Award.\" Debby has also received the California State Parks \"California Poppy Award.\" The Sonoma County Board of Supervisors acknowledged her outstanding \"County Volunteer Efforts,\" for acting as a liaison between the County and the equestrian community. Debby has also served as President of the Peruvian Paso Club, and has been featured in Gaited Horse Magazine.\n\nDebby and Mike currently live in Windsor. Their three daughters live in Northern California. She still has horses in her back yard.\n\nRobert Kenneth Birkland Jr.\n\nBob Birkland, affectionately known as \"Ranger Bob,\" has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for his dedication in promoting the multi-use trail system in Sonoma County, and for his role in developing the California State Parks Mounted Assistance Unit (MAU).\n\nRanger Bob was born in Reno, Nevada. He moved to Sonoma County in 1970, at the age of thirteen. Bob received his first horse, Diamond Lil, at the age of fourteen. As a teen he rode his bike one mile to Diamond Lil's pasture in Rincon Valley, and then rode his mare right into the hills of Annadel. Bob always dreamed that he would one day be a State Park Ranger assigned to Annadel State Park.\n\nRanger Bob has served Sonoma County with both the regional and state parks, and has always advocated for equestrians. During his first state park assignment, Sonoma Coast State Beach, he worked with Backcountry Horseman to install trail signs and hitching rails at Bodega Dunes. In 2000, Ranger Bob was finally assigned to his dream park, Annadel. He patrolled on horseback, and was instrumental in facilitating communication and safety among hikers, cyclists, and equestrians. Ranger Bob encourages all user groups to volunteer and act as park stewards, and to collaborate to maintain trails. In particular, Bob supports and promotes the MAU, which has grown from a handful to seventy-five riders under his wisdom and guidance. Ranger Bob has obtained more than $10,000 in grant funding from REI for map design and trail maintenance at Annadel. He continues to work with local companies to help fund park improvements for all user groups.\n\nRanger Bob lives in Rincon Valley with his wife, Sandy, and daughter, Kelly. He still rides in the hills of Annadel with horses, Bishop, Hannah, and Dolly-but just for fun.\n\nPatricia Peters Eliot\n\nPat Eliot is receiving an Equus Award for her dedication to protection of open space, while promoting responsible equestrian access.\n\nPat Eliot's earliest equestrian memory is as a three year old, looking between long white ears of her mule as she rode in the Sierra. She received her first horse at the age of twelve. As a youth, she spent summers with her horse at Jack London Guest Ranch in Glen Ellen as part of a housekeeping crew, and was paid $50 plus her horse's keep for a summer's work.\n\nAfter her marriage to diplomat Ted Eliot, she lived in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East where she had many international riding adventures. Upon moving to Sonoma in l987, Pat became active in land conservation and stewardship. She helped form the Sonoma Mountain Preservation Group to protect a parcel on the southeastern flank of the mountain, a magnificent redwood, oak, and maple forest. This land is now protected by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District (OSD) and slated to become accessible to the public by trail from Jack London State Historic Park (SHP). Pat also helped Jack London SHP acquire 600 acres of the Sonoma Developmental Center, set for vineyard development. Pat is a board member of LandPaths, a county organization that provides responsible public access to many of OSD's 72,000 acres. Pat is a longstanding member of the State Parks Mounted Assistance Unit (MAU) and the Eldridge Posse. Pat says protecting lands for the public \"doesn't just happen. Collaboration, cooperation, communication, compromise, and public involvement can move mountains.\"\n\nPat and Ted live in a house they built on Sonoma Mountain. Pat has ridden her horse, D2, all over California, but especially loves to explore the eastern slope of Sonoma Mountain.\n\nDanny Earl Horn\n\nDan Horn has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions to trail riding in Sonoma County. Dan was born in Oakdale, California, and raised in Humboldt County. He first remembers riding a horse at age seven. Dan's first equine pal was a mule named Flapjack, with whom he shared many adventures.\n\nDan moved to Sonoma County in 1975. Dan has made many contributions to the trail community through his membership in Back Country Horsemen of California (BCHC). He currently serves as their education officer. Since joining BCHC in the 1990s, Dan has cut and maintained trails, built bridges, installed water troughs, hitching posts, and manure bunkers, and designed camp sites. He has obtained grant funding to upgrade facilities and purchase equipment. Dan's contributions can be seen at the county and state parks, and especially at Lake Sonoma. As one nominator put it, \"If you have ridden on the trail in Sonoma County, you have benefited from Dan Horn's generosity.\" His experience and knowledge of back country travel is extensive. Dan has earned the title of Master Educator in \"Leave No Trace (LNT)\" from the National Outdoor Leadership School. He is also a \"Wilderness Rider\" with BCHC. The Wilderness Rider designation results from a collaboration between BCHC, NFS, NPS and the BLM, and is awarded to individuals who demonstrate extensive knowledge and skill with back country stock use. In 2008, Dan was named \"Wilderness Rider of the Year,\" a statewide award given to a single rider by BCHC for his or her outstanding contribution to back country riding.\n\nDan currently lives in Santa Rosa, and has four children. He is a Vietnam veteran. Dan is a contractor when he is not on the trail with one of his three horses (Cisco, Bill, and Rebel).\n\nMichael Hanna Muir\n\nMichael Muir is receiving an Equus Award for his dedication to promoting horsemanship among physically challenged individuals.\n\nMichael Muir, international horsemanship champion, began as a teenager on Fulton Road in Santa Rosa. Michael received his first broodmare when he was twelve, and soon acquired another. Both mares had fillies in tow, and fillies on the way. \"With six females, I was well on my way to being a horse breeding son of a gun!\" His first stable was a roof-less barn at a feedlot in Dixon, owned by the local banker. Michael rode his bike every day to care for his growing herd. He had already found his life's work.\n\nMichael has worked with Appaloosa show horses and bred race horses. His horses have earned National Grand Championships in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. What makes this extraordinary record unique is that Michael has lived with multiple sclerosis since the age of fifteen. When the course of his disease prevented him from riding, he turned to driving, and was introduced to the world of draft horses. Michael began crossing some descendants of his original Appaloosas with Percherons and developed his eye-catching Stonewall Sporthorses. Michael and an international team of equestrians with disabilities completed a remarkable 3,000 mile Horsedrawn Journey across America in 2001, with his unique Warmbloods. They drove wheelchair accessible carriages from the Mission in San Diego to the White House. His experiences with the Horsedrawn Journey across America led Michael to found Access Adventure, a program that enriches the lives of people with disabilities.\n\nMichael's journey has come full circle. In 2009, Access Adventure will begin offering programs in outdoor recreation, environmental education, and open space access, using wheelchair accessible carriages to residents with disabilities and underserved youth in Sonoma County.\n\nSue Matthiessen Reinecke\n\nSue Reinecke has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for her outstanding contribution to dressage in Sonoma County.\n\nSue's first riding memory is as a four year old sitting on a neighbor's placid plow horse. She grew up riding in Carmel, Woodside, and Pebble Beach. She rode her first dressage horse in the Round Barn at Mt Weske in Windsor.\n\nSue moved to Sonoma County in 1970. She met her husband Tom in Healdsburg and subsequently moved to his family ranch, Renaissance Farm on Milk Barn Road. Sue's presence transformed the rustic former dairy from a few stalls and a \"piece of sand\" for riding, to a boarding barn with a first-class arena. The facility now attracts dressage clinicians from all over the world. Nonetheless, Renaissance Farm remains a relaxed, working farm with 200 acres of oak and wildflower-covered pasture for Sue's beloved cows and a few lucky horses. One nominator wrote, \"When local equestrians think of dressage, or of a horse-and human-friendly stable, Sue's cheerful face is the first that comes to mind.\" Through the California Dressage Society (CDS), Sue has volunteered promoting dressage, encouraging local riders, and fostering Sonoma's own \"Dressage in the Wine Country.\"† In the 1980s, collaborating with 4-H and the Sonoma CDS Chapter, Sue sponsored a riding program called \"Horsepower\" for people with special needs, such as autism and paraplegia. Sue has worked with world-class dressage trainers, including Darren Taplin, Lilo Fore, and Shelley Siegel. She has ridden at FEI (Federation Equestre Internationale) Grand Prix level, currently at Prix St George, and has won the US Dressage Federation Bronze and Silver medals, and the FEI Master's Challenge.\n\nSue and Tom currently live at Renaissance Farm. She owns two Hanoverian geldings, 19-year-old Lester and 20-year-old Raj. She continues to love and support dressage.\n\nMaria Emilia Silva\n\nMaria Silva receives an Equus Award for her outstanding work with Quarter Horses, and her dedication to advancing the disciplines of reining and western pleasure in Sonoma County.\n\nMaria Silva was born in San Francisco. Although she comes from a family of musicians, she rode her first horse at 11/2 years old. As a child, she rode in Golden Gate Park. At the age of six, she entered her first show at Albert's field in San Rafael, and had to ride her horse fourteen miles to get there.\n\nMaria moved to Sonoma County in 1972, when she purchased the Lone Pine Ranch in Sebastopol. Maria has spent her life training and showing horses. Her students and horses have shown and won at local, national, and international competitions. Some of Maria's well-known students include Doreen Bobo and Debbie Dee, who both won year-end awards with the Pacific Coast Hunter Jumper Stock Horse Association. Steve Garretson, also a student of Maria's, held the title of Reserve Champion in the Stock Seat Medal Class of the American Horse Show Association. Maria has worked with many other accomplished students, including Lyle Smith and Jan Brandt. As one nominator put it, \"Maria has probably forgotten more than most of us ever knew about Quarter Horses.\" Docs Drifter, well-known son of Doc Bar, stood at Maria's ranch. Maria continues to broker fine Quarter Horses to buyers in the United States and abroad. In addition to her outstanding work in Sonoma County, she has trained western show horses in Denmark. Her horses were shown throughout Denmark and Germany in the 1980s.\n\nMaria Silva currently lives in Petaluma. She's not riding anymore (doctor's orders!), but she continues to give private riding instruction in reining to a lucky few Sonoma County riders.\n\nCoin’s Spirit of Mered\n\nCoin's Spirit of Mered - First Annual Hall of Fame Horse\n\nThe Sonoma County Horse Council has chosen Mered as the first equine member of the Equus Hall of Fame because of his outstanding talent and work with special children.\n\nMered was born and raised in Sonoma County. He is a Tennessee Walking Horse belonging to the Giant Steps Therapeutic Equestrian Center. Mered was bred specifically for work with disabled children, and began training at an early age. His disposition and intelligence were so impressive that his career helping children began when he was only three years old. Mered has been a hero ever since.\n\nMered is now ten years old and is the backbone of the Giant Steps Program. He shows the poise, steadiness, and positive attitude that one would expect from an older, more experienced horse. Robert Pope, Executive Director of Giant Steps shared, \"Mered is the smartest horse I have ever seen...Since he is so good at his job, he can hardly wait to show new volunteers just what to do.\" Although Mered works with riders of any age, he is especially good with children. Mered's first rider was a child named DJ, with cerebral palsy.\n\nDJ's parents were told that DJ would never walk, or even feel his legs. They brought him to Giant Steps not quite knowing what to expect. From the moment DJ and Mered met, it was clear they had a special bond. Mered became DJ's new best friend. After a few months of therapeutic riding, DJ was walking, and after six months, DJ's mom received a phone call from his teacher complaining that DJ was running too much in the classroom. DJ's mom laughs as she reports that her gleeful giggle wasn't the reaction her son's teacher had expected.\n\nThe professionals at Giant Steps have many more stories about Mered. One day he was carrying a small child when a deer bounded into the arena, causing alarm among the therapists. Mered just stopped and stood absolutely still until the deer bounded back out. He moved again when the command was given. Mered gaited for a ninety-four year old stroke survivor who wanted to ride a Tennessee Walker one last time. The weakened rider had difficulty with the leg commands, but Mered safely and gently carried her around the arena, compensating for her mistakes. Mered has touched children and adults with severe anxiety, autism, and developmental delays. Mered is eager for each day, taking his job very seriously, and enjoying all of his riders.\n\nIn his free time, Mered enjoys kids, carrots, and walking on the beach. He loves to hang around with his best friend Shiloh, an older horse with whom he bonded as a youngster. In the pasture he is playful and energetic, kicking up his heels and stirring up the herd. Mered has no plans to retire; he will likely continue his magical work until he's twenty-five or so. That means he'll help thousands more children before he retires to a life of leisure with the clover and the dandelions.\n\nAA-Allusion\n\nAA-Allusion (aka ìLuî) is named to the Equus Hall of Fame for his outstanding endurance achievements and his dedication to service in Sonoma County.\n\nLu began his life in Sonoma County at what was formerly West Coast Arabians in southwest Santa Rosa. He is currently twenty-three years old. His owner, Marci Cook, teaches kindergarten at Mattie Washburn Elementary School in Windsor. Marci found Lu almost twenty years ago when he was advertised in the Healdsburg Tribune. He was green and living unused in a backyard in Sebastopol. The ad said simply, ìArab gelding. 5 years. $500.î The ad reflects Luís personality to a ìT.î\n\nLu is a no nonsense, no frills horse. On the outside, Lu is not a typical flashy, showy Arab. He is simply a happy, dedicated horse. But he is truly an Arab on the inside: beautiful, spirited, and energetic. He loves having a job and applies himself with fierce dedication. Marci, a horsewoman with decades of experience, says she has never trusted a horse so much to do what he is asked to do. A few years ago, Lu suffered a ìcareer-endingî injury to his right front leg. After a two year recovery period, Lu announced that he was returning to the trail. He rebounded as strong as ever, and has completed several endurance rides since. To date, Lu has an estimated 10,000 miles on the trail.\n\nLu is an endurance champ, with over 6,000 miles in competition. He has completed dozens of fifty-mile rides locally and statewide, including the Wild West 50-Miler and the Cooley Ranch Ride. Lu has also completed several one hundred-mile rides, including the Swanson Pacific and the Virginia City 100. Two of Luís favorite multi-day rides are the 250-Mile Pony Express Ride and the 205-Mile Death Valley Ride. Perhaps Luís finest endurance achievements are his Tevis Cup completions. The Tevis Cup is a grueling one hundred mile race through the Sierras from Truckee to Auburn. The race has a 50% completion rate, and endurance riders view it as an achievement to simply cross the finish line within the twenty-four hour time limit. Marci and Lu have attempted and completed the Tevis Cup four times, with a 100% finish rate, and each time stronger than the last.\n\nLu believes in community service. He has twenty years of trail maintenance work with the endurance community, over 1000 miles with the Mounted Assistance Unit for the state parks, and over 500 miles with the Mounted Assistance Unit for the regional parks. He has mentored many novice Mounted Unit horses over the years, and he loves the public and being an ambassador in the parks. Lu also loves children. Annually, for more than ten years, Lu has traveled to Mattie Washburn Elementary School and taught the kindergarteners that ìHî is for horse.\n\nOne special story describes Luís personality well. During the Desert Gold 50-Miler, Marci and Lu met another rider whose goal was to complete this fifty-mile race. The horse and rider had a spill eleven miles from the finish, and the rider broke her collar bone. She desperately wanted to finish the race. The injured rider sadly insisted she was done, and that her horse wouldnít ìpony.î Marci and Lu knew otherwise. Lu ponied this horse and rider to near the finish, where the injured rider took over and was able to complete the ride on her own. Marci beams when she shares this special story about Lu.\n\nLu currently lives in Healdsburg with his pasture mates, Lexi and Hank. He also shares his home with a six hundred pound pig, three dogs, several assorted birds (including an emu named EBoo), and other barnyard friends. In his free time he enjoys kicking up his heels, priming the youngster, Hank, for his future as an endurance horse, and relaxing in the sun.\n\nHenry Trione - A Special Tribute\n\nThe Sonoma County Horse Council would like to offer a special tribute to Henry Trione for his decades of dedication promoting the presence and image of horses in Sonoma County. In particular, the SCHC would like to acknowledge and offer gratitude for Henry’s role in the creation and preservation of Annadel State Park.\n\nHenry came to Sonoma County in 1948. His name and accomplishments are well known in equestrian circles locally, nation-ally, and internationally. Locally, Henry was one of the Wild Oak Saddle Club founders. He is largely credited with bringing Polo to northern California. Trione represented the US amateur team internationally, and was inducted into Florida’s Polo Hall of Fame in 2008. Trione has been active in the Thoroughbred industry. He was an original Trailblazer and helped start the Trailblazer Foundation.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Henry was pivotal in the creation of Annadel State Park. “Every time I ride in that park, I give a silent ‘thank you' to Henry for his pivotal role in the establishment of Annadel”, says one nominator. In 1971, Trione pulled together a consortium of private and state foundation funds to acquire land threatened by development to create Annadel State Park.\n\nHenry was a founding member of the California State Parks Foundation, and a creator of the Annadel Visitor’s Center Foundation. In 2008, Henry was named an honorary State Park Ranger by the California State Rangers Association. Most recently, as Annadel was under threat of closure due to state budget cuts, Trione acted publicly and privately to ensure preservation of the park.\n\nHenry has two sons, Victor and Mark. He is a WWII veteran. He lives in Santa Rosa, and tries to stay out of the limelight. If you want to offer a ‘thank you’, you might catch a glimpse of him at the Wild Oak Saddle Club, or maybe on the trail.\n\nCarol Barnes\n\nCarol Barnes has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for her forty years of quiet, dedicated service to the equestrians and equestrian organizations of Sonoma County.\n\nCarol’s first horse, named Old Paint, was a Montana Mustang that her Dad brought back in an open-topped wooden trailer. According to Carol, my dad worked on sheep ranches so we always had horses. I grew up on a horse and cant remember when I didn’t ride.\n\nCarol was born in Santa Rosa and has lived here most of her life. Carol has a long but quiet history of service. According to one nominator, Carol is an understated, unassuming woman who always steps up to the plate when needed.\n\nCarol joined the Sonoma County Driving and Riding Club (SCDRC) in 1968. In the last forty years, she has served several terms as secretary, vice president, and president. In 1990, SCDRC granted Carol and husband, Dan, honorary lifetime memberships for their years of contributions. Carol joined the Sonoma County Trails Council during its formative years. She has served as secretary and as president. Carolís board positions demonstrate her most visible commitments to the equestrian community, but Carol usually works quietly, behind the scenes.\n\nTo this day, Carol is still active in public service. Four years ago, she joined the Mounted Assistance Units for both the regional and state parks. She has completed hundreds of patrol hours to date.\n\nJohn Ryan\n\nJohn Ryan is receiving an Equus Award for his collaboration with equestrian groups and tireless political advocacy for equestrian access to open space in Sonoma County.\n\nJohn does not ride or own horses. He does recall riding a horse as a small child in a corral at a family reunion in Morgan, Utah. It was a great experience, he recalls, and made me realize the importance of the horse and rider relationship.\n\nJohn was born and raised in Sonoma County. He reports that he practically grew up in Annadel and Spring Lake Parks. John left briefly to earn his degree in Economics at Cal Poly, then came right back home. He has been the Volunteer/Intern Coordinator for Sonoma County Regional Parks for ten years. One of his first projects was to collaborate with Backcountry Horsemen on installation of hitching posts and manure bunkers at Spring Lake Park.\n\nSince then, John has spearheaded many of the equestrian facility improvements in our parks, including installation of water troughs, hitching posts, manure bunkers, and picnic tables, and improvements in parking areas. One of Johns largest achievements has been his role in the development of the Regional Parks Mounted Assistance Unit, which extends the eyes and ears of the understaffed park rangers. John has also lent his time and support to the State Parks Mounted Assistance Unit. According to John, I have always been impressed by the equestrian community in Sonoma County. Everyone I have come across is willing to help out by donating their time, energy, or money to make the parks a better place. Instead of saying The parks should do this or that, equestrians say How can we help the parks John has also strongly advocated for equestrian access to new properties such as Tolay and Taylor Mountain Regional Parks.\n\nJohn lives with his wife, Maureen, in Santa Rosa in a house they just bought this year. He walks to work, which delights him. He loves spending his free time outdoors, especially hiking, cycling, swimming, and playing soccer.\n\nGwen Stockebrand\n\nGwen Stockebrand is named to the Equus Hall of Fame in recognition of her contribution to advancing the discipline of Dressage.\n\nGwen started riding at three years of age. She remembers learning an important lesson at age seven. She was leading her horse Ginger in order to introduce her to the hot wire and got too close. According to Gwen, The horse went flying, the lead rope went flying, the horse took off, and I learned about electricity.\n\nGwen Stockebrand is well-known locally, nationally, and internationally in the world of Dressage. She has trained numerous horses to Grand Prix and has represented the United States in international competitions including the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan American Games. At age twenty-three she was one of the youngest riders chosen to represent the US Equestrian Team on her Morgan/Tennessee Walker gelding, Bao. Gwen and Bao enjoyed much success nationally and internationally, and they were named National and International Champions. Gwen also received national acclaim on her Dutch Warmblood gelding, Monseigneur, including National Grand Prix Champion, Grand Prix Freestyle Champion, and Grand Prix Champion Horse of the Year, among other honors.\n\nOver the past thirty years Gwen has made numerous contributions to Sonoma County Dressage. Gwen was one of the original founders of the California Dressage Societyís Dressage in the Wine Country. She has been active in training horses and riders, judging, and organizing events. Gwenís students have been successful competitors at local, state, and national levels. One nominator wrote, ìGwen is a brilliant and beautifully gifted rider, as well as a generous and patient instructor. She is an ambassador for all horses and horse lovers in the art of Dressage.\n\nGwen currently owns and lives at Flying Changes in Santa Rosa. She continues to offer Dressage training all over northern California and Arizona. She owns and houses several retired horses, but her current focus is a six year old Hanoverian named Drambuie.\n\nVeda Rose Pope\n\nVeda Rose Pope is receiving an Equus Award for her pioneering work training mules and donkeys, and for her special leather craft.\n\nVeda Rose started riding at age nine on her grandparents donkey. She would ride up and down the railroad tracks, and feel like she was in her own little world. I was just riding the rails! Veda Rose Pope first came to Sonoma County in 1960, after she was married at Novato Air Force Base. At age eighteen, she opened Carters Farm, where she trained and boarded horses. (She reports she also trained some children there.)\n\nShe started mule breeding and training more than twenty years ago and has trained mules for Dressage, Jumping, Trail, Roping, Pleasure, and Driving. Her specialty is general ranch work. ìJust about anything youíd wanna do off an equine, Iíve trained a mule to do, including coon jumping,î says Veda Rose. Veda has shown at Bishop Mule Days for the last twenty years. She is particularly proud of Apples Peaches and Cream who was Top Ten in the California Regional Open Shows as a three year old, and All-Around Reserve World Champion at Bishop at the age of twenty-one. Bonita Bars was 1994 All-Around New Mexico State Champion. She still breeds and trains a few special mules. She refers to her ex-Jack donkey, Sunny, as her ìCadillacî ride.\n\nVeda began her leather craft for her mules because horse tack ìjust didnít fit right.î She then branched into boots and clothing, with the help of her husband, RC Pope. Chances are youíve seen some of Vedaís fancy saddles and ornate, custom boots around the county. Veda sews, patches, fits, and paints each piece. Such individuals as Tommie Lee Jones, Michael Martin Murphyís manager, and several winery owners boast Vedaís boots.\n\nThese days you can find Veda caring for RC, or making boots, or riding her mules. She has three daughters with whom she is very close. She currently owns Sunny, and four mulesóGracie, Jim Dandy, Charlotte, and Bartholemule.\n\nBetty Menefee\n\nBetty Menefee is named to the Equus Hall of Fame for more than fifty years of service as a teacher and leader for the Sonoma County equestrian community.\n\nBetty’s first memory of horses was as a youngster when her mother would bring her out to greet the gray draft horse hauling the Rags, Bottles, & Sacks wagon. She was terrified. The next summer she took a pack trip during summer camp in the Sierras, and never stopped riding after that!\n\nBetty moved to Sonoma County in 1954, and settled in Windsor. She bought two horses, and not only introduced her six children to riding, but also any neighborhood kid who wanted to climb on a horse. According to her children, they never made plans until they checked the date against Mom’s calendar. Betty founded the first 4H Light Horse Club in Sonoma County. She recalls she had the only trailer for miles, and crammed in as many horses as she could to get to a show. We took the back seat out of the station wagon and put the pony in there.\n\nIn 1957 she joined the Sonoma County Driving and Riding Club (SCDRC), serving as treasurer, vice-president, and president. During her fifty-plus years in the SCDRC Betty mentored young riders, showed horses, and competed in the Colorguard. Betty has also served as president and executive secretary of Region 1 California State Horsemanís Association (CSHA).\n\nBetty was an early supporter of equestrian trail expansion in Sonoma County. She made numerous trips to Sacramento, paving the way for organizations such as the Heritage Trail Foundation. Betty competed in NATRC, and later became an NATRC judge. She actively encouraged new riders and taught horsemanship. Betty has completed the Tevis Cup.\n\nBetty, now eighty-seven years young, says Boy, I had a lot of energy back then! She currently lives in a retirement apartment and spends her evenings playing bridge and keeping her kids busy chasing her around.\n\nMichael Rosenberg\n\nMichael Alan Rosenberg has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for his dedicated practice as a farrier in Sonoma County, and for his outstanding leadership of Petaluma Riding and Driving Club (PRDC).\n\nMike became involved with horses as an adult. One of his first memories involves a beach ride on his first horse, Cody. Cody was new to carrying saddlebags, and as Mike attempted to move him into the surf, the horse spun and the saddlebags smacked against his hindquarters. Cody started bucking and dumped Mike on the sand in front of his friends. He says he has improved since then.\n\nMike was born and raised in Santa Rosa. After becoming involved with horses, he chose to train as a farrier. Mike shoes all disciplines but views Reining as his specialty. Mike is well-known for his skilled and gentle handling of horses. One long-time shoer said, ìNow thereís a horseman. Heís just a naturalÖHe takes to them, and they love him.î While humble about his achievements, Mike is dedicated to continued growth as farrier, and he has helped many horses return to, and maintain, soundness.\n\nMike has been a dedicated president of PRDC. He has improved the clubís organization, economics, and professionalism. Under Mikeís leadership, the club has become more family friendly and welcoming to beginners, and has become a home for practice and performance of priceless and vanishing western skills such as Roping, Cutting, and Team Penning.\n\nMike, himself, has competed and won in many of these disciplines, including winning the 2000 Redwood Empire Quarter Horse Association High Point Saddle in Team Penning on his horse, Fritter. He has also won many High Point Buckles on his Quarter Horse mare, Calinda, who until recently carried his six year old daughter, Marissa, around the barrels.\n\nMike and his family now live in Santa Rosa. They have five horses, four dogs, and one cat. In his free time, he likes to trail ride with his wife, Christine.\n\nRobert C. Adams\n\nRobert Adams has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for over thirty-five years of dedicated leadership in the equine industry. Robert was born on a farm in Akron, Ohio. At the age of ten, he learned how to drive a team of horses for haying and picking up sap for the sugar mill on the property. After high school and during a tour of duty in the Air Force he was part of a goodwill touring rodeo team that visited Europe. He rode broncs and bulls for several years in the program.\n\nAfter returning home, Robert focused on education and work. In 1977 he purchased a two year old stallion named Sugar Daddy Two, which began his adulthood love of horses. The success of this stallion resulted in several memberships, including the American Quarter Horse Association, the National Reining Cow Horse Association, and the National Cutting Horse Association. Here in Sonoma County, Robert was president of the Western Cow Horse Association (WCHA) for five years. Under Robert, the organization grew and enthusiasm reached a new high. The WCHA experienced an increase in the type and breadth of program. Bob went on to become president of Redwood Empire Cutting Horse Association, with a board of directors that were responsive, dedicated, and enthusiastic. The association continues to be a premier participant in the Cutting horse industry in Sonoma County and on the Pacific Coast.\n\nBob served three terms as president of the California State Horsemanís Association (CSHA). He has held several state-level positions including northern area vice president, chairman of the Long Range Planning Committee and several others. CSHA has eighteen regions and thousands of members. As president, Robert became one of the principal architects for the corporate restructuring of the organization, updating and changing the structure for a transition to a 501c3. With the dedicated assistance of CSHA staff, members and board of directors, the transition was completed successfully.\n\nAlong the way, Bob and his wife Nancy continue their interest and participation in the Cutting horse industry. They live in Forestville, California. They have three children, five grandchildren, one dog named Halle and thirteen horses.\n\nMidnight: A little Black and a lot of Pony\n\nMidnight has been chosen as the 2011 Hall of Fame Horse in recognition of his commitment to making the days and the dreams of young, aspiring equestrians come true. Though small in stature, Midnight is mighty in his ability to elicit a smile from any child who knows him. Midnight spends his days at the Howarth Park pony corral. A cross between a Shetland and a Welsh, Midnight is a little black and a lot of pony. His age is a bit of a mystery but heís probably gaining on his second decade in this world. And in the last decade his popularity and purpose have become increasingly apparent as his appeal to the young masses continues to rise. Midnight is the favorite four-legged friend at Howarth Park, and his future looks bright, lit with the smiles of kids coming to pay their respects to their best pony friend. But that wasnít always the case.\n\nWhen Linda Aldrich, owner of The Pony Express, a non-profit organization that advocates on behalf of both horses and youth in need, first met the Mighty M, he wasnít quite the mane man he is today. Living as an outcast in a field of goats, Midnight had long since lost his trust in humans. It used to take an entire team of two-legged horse folks to catch him, and once caught, his survival instinct kicked in hard. Midnight had but one goal: to get away, or get you to go away. Afraid of everything, Midnight was decidedly not going to get along or go along with anything human. Bucking and bolting his way in and out of most situations made this little guy a big force to be reckoned with.\n\nUp at Howarth Park, Midnight was literally beside himself most of those early days. Regardless of the fact that Midnight was not ready to participate in the pony ride operation, Linda felt it was helpful for him to be a part and a party to the daily routine. He soon learned it was a safe place, and Midnight realized that he could put his survival mode of operation into the pastÖbig step for a fearful little pony.\n\nSoon Midnight embraced his new life. Once impossible to catch, Midnight was now equally as impossible to not catch. While the other ponies that faithfully serve the young park patrons look forward to days off, Midnight looks forward only to days on. Midnight impatiently waits to get out the gate and into the trailer to go to work. Midnight soon became the mane man at the Howarth Park pony corral, with his very own herd of kids requesting him by name. With a kind nudge or a nod of his head Midnight acknowledges each young equine enthusiast who calls him by name. One child nominator wrote, ìI love Midnight. He loves everybody who pets him.î The parents who nominated Midnight uniformly commented on the confidence, engagement, and growth that interaction with Midnight has created in their children.\n\nNow, over a decade later, Midnight can be found at Howarth Park Pony Corral every day it is open (February through October). He waits patiently along the fence for the next passionate little person to call his name. Never one to turn down a carrot or an apple, Midnight is treated to well-earned treats by his little charges who charge gleefully in his direction. From offering simple pony rides, to teaching the highlights of horsemanship, Midnight dedicates himself to his youthful fans with devotion. A little black, and a lot of pony, has finally come home. And as they say in story books, he is living happily ever after.\n\nPamela Anne Berg\n\nPamela Berg has been inducted into the Equus Hall of Fame for her twenty years of dedication to helping horses in need in Sonoma County. Pam can’t remember a life without horses. She grew up doing all the crazy things kids do and miraculously avoided injury: jumping bareback without reins, jumping problem horses, and barrel racing. She attempted the Hunter/Jumper show circuit in her teens, but realized she really wasn’t competitive. Pam decided early to work with horses for her own pleasure and accomplishments, with their wellbeing in mind. Pam will tell you, “They taught me so much!”\n\nIn her adulthood she continued her love for horses by schooling, breeding, training, and a enjoying a long career as a steward in racing. It was there that she recognized the need for a retirement and rehabilitation foundation for injured and needy horses, and also the need to teach people the skills to work with horses in a safe and humane manner. Pam saw too many horses needlessly euthanized for injury or sent off to slaughter. In 1995, Pam founded Glen Ellen Vocational Academy (GEVA, inc), a nonprofit retirement and rehabilitation foundation for horses. Since then, GEVA, inc has rehabbed, helped place, or simply offered safe haven for thousands of horses. GEVA, inc houses about thirty horses at a time, usually injured Thoroughbreds, but does not discriminate against any horse in need. GEVA, inc also tries to place horses they cannot accommodate. GEVA, inc has no employees and is dependent on the dedication of volunteers and donors. GEVA, inc welcomes both for the welfare of the horses we all love so dearly.\n\nPam has many qualifications indispensible to the equine industry. The Jockey Club has certified her as a horse identifier. The California Horse Racing Board has designated Pamela a trainer and a steward. She has received the national Dogwood Dominion Award and the Sonoma County Ursula Liarcos Award for her dedication to horses in need. She is a nationally recognized expert witness and equine consultant, all of which she does to benefit GEVA, inc and the horses. Pamela currently lives in Glen Ellen.\n\nL. Lawrence Braun\n\nLarry Braun has been inducted into the Equus Hall of Fame for his promotion and preservation of the Peruvian Paso breed. Larry was born in Indiana, and began riding horses at a very young age. As a teen, Larry assisted children on pony rides at a local amusement park and was given riding privileges after work. Larry also rode a neighbor’s small stallion who he credits with teaching him how to stay in the saddle, as this stallion would try everything to get Larry off his back. For a time, Larry considered becoming a jockey but this idea passed as he grew. Larry’s education and law practice left him little time for horses until after he and his wife Rossana relocated to wine country in 1987.\n\nIt was here that his childhood passion for horses was rekindled. Larry discovered the Peruvian Paso at the State Fair, and he and Rossana purchased two fillies, and joined the Wine Country Peruvian Paso Horse Club (WCPPHC). In 1997, they moved to their ranch in Petaluma and expanded their Peruvian Paso horse family to five. Larry competes on his horses, most recently at the US National Show in September in Burbank.\n\nLarry’s passion for the Peruvian Paso has also driven him to participate in many parades and exhibitions, including Equine Extravaganza’s and Ag Days in Sonoma County, as well as musical performances on horseback. Larry retired from the practice of law in 2000, and in 2006 began professionally instructing and coaching adults and children to ride the Peruvian Paso.\n\nLarry has served several terms as president of the WCPPHC. Under his energetic leadership, the WCPPHC has become one of the largest, most active and best known Peruvian Paso clubs. He has been an important force behind the WCPPHC’s participation at the Western States Horse Expo in Sacramento since 2001. In March of 2010, Larry organized a Peruvian Paso Festival held at his ranch, drawing 120 Club members and guests, including the Counsel General of Peru, his family, and staff.\n\nLarry and Rossana currently live on their Petaluma ranch, Terra LarRossa, with their five Peruvian Pasos and one barn cat.\n\nAnn Gillis, DVM\n\nAnn Gillis has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for twenty years of dedicated equine veterinary service in Sonoma County. Ann first remembers riding at summer camp at age eight. After that she stole any ride she could until age twenty-two when she got Snip, a Quarter Horse. She trail rode and worked cows on Snip, and has owned horses ever since.\n\nAnn was born in Oakland and trained at UC Davis. She was a Regents Scholar and a National Dean’s List honoree, and also received the George Hart Scholarship, and the Merck Manual Achievement Award. Ann has run a nutrition lab at the University of Idaho, and a mammalian physiology lab at UC Davis. In her day-to-day practice Dr Gillis specializes in Equine Health, priding herself on providing outstanding ìgeneral equine care. Ann consults for the California Veterinary Medical Board, and sits on the Large Animal Practitioner Advisory Board for UC Davis. She is currently being considered for the Human-Animal Bond Committee of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nAnn has been practicing in Sonoma County for twenty years. Her strengths include communication, honesty, and experience. One nominator wrote, When my horses are sick, I am scared; they can’t talk to me. I relax when Ann shows up. She speaks for my horses. Despite her experience she is not arrogant, but maintains humility and an open mind. Ann is confident with most barn calls, but also doesn’t hesitate to call for second opinion or send horses to tertiary care centers. She has closely networked relationships with specialists at UC Davis, and local equine vets. Ann’s favorite visits are pre-purchase exams because they require a sharp eye, analytical skills, and fairness to the horse. They are also challenging in people management and diplomacy. Ann took 24/7-call for many years and now shares her call with another local vet, Dr Michelle Beko.\n\nAnn enjoys trail riding (both Western and English), and she has experience in cow work. She currently lives in West Petaluma with her partner of twenty-four years, and numerous animals including three dogs, twenty-two cats, three miniature donkeys, one full-size donkey, one miniature steer, four goats, and six horses.\n\nStuart Alan Greenberg\n\nStuart Greenberg has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for his thirty years of humble and dedicated service as a classical farrier, and as teacher and mentor to hundreds of equestrians in Sonoma County. Stuart was born in Louisville Kentucky. As a child, Stuart remembers starting to ride at Mrs Brown’s farm, where he would take lessons with his brother. “She hollered at us a lot, I remember” says Stuart. After that Stuart took the opportunity to ride any friends horses he could, usually bareback. Stuart reports that he has never had much formal training, and doesn’t ride Western or English, but rather just focuses on communication with horses.\n\nStuart studied psychology at the University of Kentucky, until he moved to Steamboat Springs, Colorado. There he met his mentor, Dave Lewis, a journeyman and classical farrier, who hailed from a long family line of blacksmiths. He studied with Lewis for a number of years. Stuart received recognition in several iron-working competitions while working in Colorado.\n\nStuart moved to Occidental in 1983. In 1988 he began teaching Farrier Science at the Santa Rosa Junior College. Over the last twenty three years he has taught owners, veterinarians, and aspiring farriers. He has consistently received the highest evaluations for his class. Stuart’s farrier technique is a dying art. He forges all his own shoes, making each set at home before he leaves for his shoeing appointments. His practice has evolved into shoeing horses that need special care and rehabilitation. Stuart views helping the horse as his primary focus, whether it’s a little girl’s pony with founder, or a retired horse needing comfort during its senior years.\n\nStuart loves horses, but he doesn’t own any. He will ride on occasion when invited by friends. He does love to ride his Harley. He says he likes to spend his free time doing something that is not so close to his daily work. When not shoeing horses, Stuart is also a blacksmith. He makes custom fireplace tools and irons, and small decorative pieces. Stuart lives in Glen Ellen.\n\nJoDean Nicolette\n\nJoDean Nicolette has been named to the Equus Hall of Fame for her extensive volunteer service supporting equestrians and equestrian organizations of Sonoma County. JoDean began riding as an adult. “I started to ride horses at age thirty-nine, she shrugs, just as I started to develop fear, and a sense of my own mortality. JoDean’s first horse was a three year old Paint horse named Jimmie (Jimmie-James to his friends). She still has Jimmie, and has continued to add to her herd.\n\nJoDean has lived in Santa Rosa for ten years, and has been involved in the Sonoma County equestrian community for about half that time. According to her nominations JoDean ‘is a driving force behind equestrian interests in our county.’ One nominator wrote, ‘I challenge you to find a person who has done more for hor"
