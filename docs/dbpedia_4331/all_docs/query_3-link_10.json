        "text": "I am one of the daughters of Richard Fuchs, and on behalf of our entire family I want to thank all the amazing Patriot Guardsmen who came and stood by our family, and our Dad’s casket, in 18-degree weather last Wednesday! I cannot express how beautiful and meaningful your dedication was. It meant the world to our family. Your group was standing at each side of the entry doors at McGilley’s Funeral Home when our family pulled up 30 minutes early to set up tables for our Dad’s funeral. They stood at the front doors as people started coming to the visitation and an hour later, they still stood as people were finishing filing in for the service. Then they stood by 2 hours later as our Dad’s casket was carried to the hearse and gave him a final salute. We had no idea that you would stay with us after your (frigid!) motorcycle escort to the cemetery, where your group stood in a line ahead of us as we started our walk to the gravesite. We felt so supported and felt the honor that was given to our Dad, although he had served his Country as a Navy pilot in World War II (over 75 years ago)! As I looked behind us right before the taps played and the gun salute, I was surprised to see the Patriot Guard had taken up position in a line behind our family tent, and they stayed there throughout the service; and until the last person left the cemetery, all in below freezing temperature and strong winds. Standing with us as we came & went gave us a comfort, strength and a support we didn’t even know we needed. And the solemness, respect and honor it showed for our father was a true ministry to our hearts. It also brought a lot of tears, but they were thankful ones. We will never forget how you made us feel that day. It helped us more than you know, on a truly hard day. God bless you all – you are an amazing group!\n\nI’m the grandson of a Navy veteran who passed away in September. Your group had a couple of riders come out and my grandma wants to say thank you.\n\nThese are her words…\n\n“Thank you so much for coming to show your thanks for 20 years my husband David gave in service to our country. He loved being a part of this service as a Sea Bee and served 2 tours in Vietnam. Thanks again for the service you provided for service men and women.” – Johnnie Oswald\n\nI would also like to say thank you, myself. It was really cool pulling up at the funeral home to the flags put out by your members. The funeral was in Eupora, MS, but I live in Greenwood. I work with Tater, who rides with your group. I didn’t know this until after the funeral and he told me to reach you on your website. Thanks again for what you do.\n\nI’m sorry this has taken so long but my head is still in a muddle.. My family and I would like to thank you for the dignity and protection you extended to my precious Paul as we escorted his cremains on this last ride to his Celebration of Life. He would have been so very honored, and humbled, by your respectful participation in the final part of this journey we call life. Paul and I have always held the Patriot Guard in our highest esteem and now even more so. Thank you for making this most difficult time a little easier. Please keep doing what you are doing … showing respect to our fallen heroes and protecting them and their families. You are a blessing and much comfort to many. I pray that God will continue to bless you as you bless others\n\nMissy Lindblom and Family\n\nHello,\n\nThe Patriot Guard recently participated in a mission to accompany my father Charles from the Big Bear Mortuary to the Riverside National Cemetery. It was a long ride and all the riders did an outstanding job accompanying my father. In addition, you also had additional members at the cemetery who stood in formation with flags. All of this really made this sad day much better for us and all of our father’s family members and friends. We don’t think your organization could ever know the true impact you make on family members when you honor their loved ones with what you do. What you do really does help the loved ones of our deceased veterans and first responders.\n\nWe also want to give a special shout out to Beth who helped organize the mission and to Craig who was the ride Captain. Without their leadership and support, the day of our father’s services would have been much more difficult. We also wanted to thank all the other riders and those who stood in formation at the cemetery as well. Your organization truly did honor our father!\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Grano (son) and Krista Grano (daughter)\n\nPatriot Guard,\n\nWords can not express the gratitude that my family and I feel, for what you are doing for my father. As I recently joined the US Army, I know the the honor your organization is bestowing for my father is something that he would have loved. I know that besides his pride as a father, the thing he was more proud of was having been an Infantry Man, a Paratrooper, and a White Devil with 2/504th PIR, 1st BDE, 82nd Airborne Division. As I imagine most or all of you are prior service, I want to thank you also for your service and sacrifices for our country. I will make sure to honor my father’s service and your service and will continue this tradition of service, honor and duty.\n\nI’m looking forward in shaking each and one of your hands on Friday. God bless you and your families and God bless America!\n\nTo those who participated to honor my brother, Alex G. Marsha’, January 8, 2022, his family humbly thanks you. On that blustery and very cold morning, sitting across from his final resting place, I looked up to see 2 friendly, yet somber faces holding flags to honor our hero, my brother. In front, beside and behind us were volunteers holding flags with silent support. What a tribute! If you are reading this, thank you kindly for participating and for standing guard and honoring our fallen brother. By family we are siblings, but the military family he had was very near and dear to him. He also participated as you have to support our fallen military men and women. There isn’t a day that has passed that I do not think of him. Please know for anyone who donated, we do not have this information but we are truly grateful for your support of this fantastic non-profit organization. Our heroes fall in different ways, but they all serve with tenacity, grit and an everlasting love for their country. God bless you all and please let’s continue the good work to uphold our heroes and the family and friends who remain.\n\nMy family and I wish to express our sincere gratitude to The Patriot Guard Riders of Georgia for The Honor Mission provided for our beloved Robert L. Conley.\n\nBob was a loving, honorable and respected man. He was husband to my mom, Hazel, father to Debbie and Vickie, stepfather to me and my four siblings, and a grandfather to many. He was very dedicated to those that he loved, including The U.S. Army.\n\nWords cannot express what this Honor Mission meant to us. David Shreckengost, Doug Brawner, David Barton, Joe Thibodeaux, Bobby Wiggins and Steve the Tail Gunner – you men are undoubtedly devoted to honoring those that have served our country. These amazing Patriots provided a flag line along the church driveway and at the entrance of the church, standing respectfully as our guests filed in, enduring the frigid temperatures of that crisp, cold day. They escorted us to the cemetery, safeguarding the family vehicle that transported Bob’s ashes to their final resting place. They lined the funeral tent with American flags and stood quietly, with empathy, showing nothing but honor and respect for our hero. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We are truly grateful for your presence and what The Patriot Guard Riders stand for!\n\nLorinda Barker\n\nPerry, GA\n\nSending much gratitude and a big heartfelt THANK YOU! to Papa Milt and the PGR’s of SW Washington that came to honor our Dad, Douglas McClelland, Saturday, May 7th at Church of the Good Shepard in Vancouver, WA. A rainy day to ride and then a service that got off to a rocky start (organist didn’t show, technical problems with the video for live streaming on YouTube), but the PGR’s were all there well ahead of the service time, placed flags around the church (beautifully done), connected with the Marine Corp Soldiers and coordinated the ceremony of the presentation of the Flag. The whole thing went so smoothly and respectfully and none of the PGR’s batted an eye when they had to stand in the rain and then patiently wait in the church for a long time as things with the service got figured out. A big shout out to Papa Milt who brought the Flag to Mom’s house the week before the service to give to Mom and to honor and thank Dad for his service. I can’t say enough how meaningful and professionally done this whole experience with you was for us. On behalf of my Dad, my Mom and all of our family, we are so thankful for your service and the time and energy you all took from your family and lives to be there to honor my Dad. Thank you again, Carol Jean, Suzi, Patsy, Mike and Margaret.\n\nOn behalf of the Trevino family, I would like to extend a heartfelt “Thank You!” to the entire Wyoming Patriot Guard; especially the SE Wyoming riders that were there for my Dad’s (SK1 Joe Trevino, USN(Ret)) services of April 12th in Cheyenne.\n\nIn true Wyoming fashion, the weather was not ideal for any outside events, but the Guards were there, without fail, in solemn solidarity for my Dad. With extremely high winds, riding was not a safe option that day, but they were not deterred from being present. It meant the world that you all would take time from your day to help us honor and remember him.\n\nOurs is a military family and we know all too well that humble acts such as the one you all displayed that day truely represent “service with honor”. It did not go unnoticed. Again, from my entire family, thank you so much!\n\nSincerely,\n\nBen Trevino,\n\nAMCS, USN(Ret)\n\nOn February 8th, your organization sent representatives to attend my dad’s funeral. You rode with us in his procession to the church, provided my mother with a challenge coin, and took the time to shake our hands and share your condolences. We did not have much of an opportunity to speak with you following the ceremony, but we wanted to express how grateful we were to have you in attendance. I have had the pleasure of working with other members of the Patriot Guard through volunteer events, and I have always been impressed with your volunteers and the time and respect they give to complete strangers. I was honored that you came, and my family will not forget your support.\n\nI wanted to mail a physical thank-you note, but was unable to find an address. I hope that this electronic message will suffice. Thank you again for your time and for honoring my dad. Your presence did not go unnoticed.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJordan LaMay\n\nTo Nigel, John and the rest of the Patriot Guard,\n\nFirst my family and I would like to thank Nigel and John for organizing the Patriot Guard to come and stand up at my husband, Joe DeMarco’s, funeral. That was such a great honor for Joe. We were trying to find the right words to express our gratitude and appreciation not only for Joe’s funeral but for the countless veterans you stand up for, it is truly remarkable. Joe really enjoyed standing and riding with all of you. He was very proud to be a part of such an amazing group. He went on as many missions as he could. I can still hear him say, “don’t make any plans I’m going on a mission.” He would check weekly to see which missions he was able to attend.\n\nThank you for bringing a bit of light to such a hard day.\n\nGod bless you all,\n\nThe DeMarcos\n\nLaura, Andrea, Diana, Sabrina, Tiffany, Alexis\n\nI would like to thank you for the wonderful escort that you had given to the 400 soldiers that left out of Chicago headed to Peoria in which you gave them an escort all the way. My son in law was on that bus. He sent videos to his pregnant wife which is a veteran herself knowing that you all made sure he had a safe journey and a great escort to Peoria eased our minds. It is so hard writing this knowing that he will soon be traveling overseas to a war zone. But knowing there is people like all of you out there who gave him the best day by the wonderful escort is all we need to know this will be ok and he will come home safely. So from the bottom of my heart, my daughters and my grand daughters thank you so much. You all have done great work. Not only with this escort but back in 2006 my son lost a very close friend in Iraq and you all were there.\n\nOn behalf of my family and my deceased husband, I want to thank the Patriots Guard riders for such a special escort and honor guard ceremony at the gravesite of my husband at the Georgia Veteran’s Cemetery. The respect and honor shown to him was beyond description and your service of a motorcycle escort from the funeral home to the gravesite was so touching. He would have been so thankful for what you did for him\n\nout of respect for his service to our country. Your men and women stood guard at the door of the funeral home while the service took place and then they escorted us to the veteran’s cemetery. The whole process took the better part of their day and their services were so appreciated. Thank you and may your organization forever carry on this service for future servicemen and women.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLynda Mathews and family\n\nDear Patriot Guard Riders of Tallahassee, FL,\n\nIt is with respect and gratitude I write you today on behalf of all my family, the family of my daddy – Robert Don Holt.\n\nWe had not previously been privileged to attend a funeral at the Tallahassee National Cemetery. What a glorious surprise on Monday 11/18/2019 to arrive to the unexpected flag processional and flanked Committal Shelter by the men and women of the Patriot Guard Riders! My what your color guard added to our last moments all together in memory of “Poppa Holt”, in reverence to God and in honor of this great country – the United States of America . THANK YOU.\n\nAs Don grew older his body grew frail but his “patriotic bone” only grew stronger. His sentiments for this Nation under God are precious. It’s one of the many gifts I realize God afforded me in the midst of the turmoil of Daddy’s passing that his date of death landed on Veterans Day! I would love for him to have gotten to observe his own funeral. Everything about it would have made him even prouder of our military, government and country!\n\nThank you for everything. The plaque is a beautiful expression and it makes for a handsome display coupled with the American flag presented to Momma.\n\nMay the good Lord reward you for the kindness you have shown our family and so many other U.S. Veterans.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmily (Holt) Brown\n\n12/18/2019\n\nI want to thank Beth, our mission coordinator, Billy Morgan, our Ride Captain, and the Patriot Guard Riders from Apple Valley, Ridgecrest, and Tehachapi, California for honoring my brother-in-law at his escort and interment in Bakersfield National Cemetery. I have ridden many missions with the PGR and all are accomplished with great respect and love for the families involved. In this instance, the Caraway family simply could not stop talking about the PGR, their love for Country, the respect demonstrated at the interment, their professionalism and the outpouring of love they provided to our entire family. I am confident my brother in law was looking down from Heaven and would want all to know he is most proud of the riders, the sacrifice they made in some very hot weather, the honor provided to him, and the love and compassion demonstrated to my sister and family. May God Bless all of you and watch over you on every mission. You are doing God’s work on every mission. Semper Fi PGR!!!!\n\nFor Mike Albers\n\nDear Mike,\n\nMy family and I would like to thank you for your escort to Jefferson Barracks yesterday. And thanks for the gold medallion And also thanks for the Patriot Guard Riders. riding with respect booklet. I have read the booklet and it is great. I especially enjoyed reading “It is the Veteran.” I think my dad would have liked that too.\n\nI was privileged to call Jim Bernthal my dad. He and my mom were married over 70years. And they passed away within a month of each other.\n\nMy dad knew all of his children, Carol, Jean Jeff and Nancy and me well. He understood we were all different and yet did his best to treat us all in an equal way. In many ways he was the captain of our ship and he was a great husband and father.\n\nI’ve also visited the website and enjoyed the poems especially one which described the stars and sea at night.\n\nMy dad would have loved the military part of his funeral. He was proud to be in the Navy.\n\nThanks some more, Mike.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMike Bernthal\n\nI have been informed that the Patriot Guard will be escorting my fiance, Jeremiah Johnson, from the airport to the funeral home on 15 July, 2020, and possibly at the funeral as well. I am also military stationed overseas, same base as Jeremiah was. I cannot thank you enough for doing this for his family, myself, and my daughter (whom he considered his own). I will be PCS’ing to northern California, Beale AFB at the end of this year, and I hope during my time on leave, visiting his grave and his parents, I get the chance to shake one of your members hands. As much as I wish I could be there in person, be able to protect the love of my life as he goes to his burial, I am amazed at the support from so many people. Thank you. Thank you for protecting his family and his body. I will forever be grateful.\n\n-Ashley Danley-Johnson\n\nI big Thank You to the Patriot Guard Riders for honoring my Daddy at his funeral Please let Captain Charles Bullock know. My Dad would have been pleased with the services at his funeral your organization provided. It was awesome to see all the flags lining the church sidewalk and along the road at the cemetery as you honored him. Thank you for the US Army bracelets provided to me. I wear it every day. My Dad was very humble, but proud of his service in WWII. He use to not say much about his WWII experience, but fortunately he opened up to me in his last few years and I treasure all stories he shared with me. My Dad was my best friend, role model, Hero, confidante, and everything to me. God Bless all the Veterans and may His Loving Arms be with each Veteran that continues in service to our great country they all fought for. My Dad was a true WWII Hero and I will continue his legacy of what he taught me. Captain Bullock is welcomed to call me. I would happily like to talk with him.\n\nTHANK YOU,\n\nTony Strickland\n\nHello,\n\nI wanted to write a huge thank you to the men with the Patriot Guard Riders who took a significant chunk of time out of their day to attend my Dad’s service on September 2nd. In the chaos after my Dad’s sudden passing, I never even considered organizing an escort from the funeral home to the cemetery. On the way to the cemetery that day while we were following the Riders, I remember thinking “Wow, this is incredible. WHAT would we have done without these guys?!”\n\nI speak on behalf of my entire family when I say that we were blown away at the kindness, organization and precision of all of these men that day. My Dad would have been SO pleased if he could have seen it. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for honoring my Dad this way and thank you for your service to our country.\n\nMegan Davila\n\nI would like to express my sincerest thank you to the members of The Patriot Guard who rode with, stood by and honored my brother James “Randy” Mayes in Augusta Ga on Feb 13th, 2021. My brother served his country with honor in the USMC and it was so important to us that his funeral recognized his service. The guard members were unbelievably kind, when my niece forgot her coat, one member retrieved a blanket from his truck and covered her with it. The flag folding and presenting to my nephew left us in tears but happy at the same time. I know they will treasure that flag forever. I had no idea that The Patriot Guard did these things and I will now be a life long supporter of their cause. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you did, it will not be forgotten. Monique Salamacha and the family of James Mayes.\n\nI would like to thank Mr. L. E. Harrison and all the riders who came and stood the flag line for my father, Donald W. Amato Sr. in Columbia SC on November 21, 2020. My father was an Army Paratrooper who served during the Korean Conflict. His most proud moments were serving his country so it was a fitting tribute to his service to have the PGR there. As a motorcycle rider myself, I understand what this means to families and also the bikers who give their time selflessly to honor these heroes. My family and I are so grateful to these men and women who give of themselves and their time to participate. Words are not enough to tell you how proud my Dad would be to know they were there for him and we are as well. My father, even in his illness and his last days, would have fought to defend this country all over again if given a chance. God Bless all of the Patriot Guard Riders.\n\nThank you so much for honoring my Dad’s memory at the celebration of his life on August 22nd in Fayetteville. For most of his later life, he felt like no one remembered the sacrifices made by those, like him, who served in Korea. He was a combat medic and did not talk much about his experiences but his wish was to have military honors at his funeral. With the COVID-19 crisis, we were concerned that we would not be able to honor his last wish. We were not aware that you offered this service for older veterans and it was only at the suggestion of John Lancaster, that we put in our request. That your members took the time to come and stand out in the heat and humidity to honor him and his service, meant more to us than we could ever put into words. Thank you so much for all you do to honor our country’s veterans.\n\nOn behalf of the Howard family, I wanted to thank you for your escort provided in June 11, 2020 to honor my father Rodger Howard. As a member of the patriot guard I’ve been on about 30 missions over the last 3 years but it was certainly a different experience witnessing what you guys do from the other side of the fence! My wife was so impressed with your dedication and professionalism. She was brought to tears by your pre ride prayer in the church. My dad was always in awe when I’d tell him about escort missions, even to the point that he joined the PGR himself and I was blessed to attend a mission by his side. As he declined in health he was not about to make missions an longer but he still loved to hear about the missions. We felt so blessed by the turnout that day. If I recall correctly, we had 18 bikes plus FS in 97° heat. You guys are amazing and we are thankful to have been blessed with your escort. Thank you so very much for honoring my father!\n\nDon Howard\n\nPGR ST LOUIS\n\nMike,\n\nThis is Gary Randall. The son of William Randall. We met yesterday at my father’s funeral. I cannot begin to tell you how much you and the Patriot Guard Riders mean to me and my family. Your presence at my Dads funeral was outstanding. The way you honor my Mother as she walked into the funeral home was beyond words. Then escorting us out to the gravesite and standing there in the hot sun with your men, was truly one of the greatest honors I have ever witnessed. When the funeral home told us yesterday morning that they had not heard from the US Air Force Honor Guard, we were crushed. We could not believe that a man who served his county for 27 years and fought in 2 wars was not going to be honored in the way he should have been, my mother and our family were devastated. Then to get a phone call from the funeral home telling us that you and the Patriot Guard Riders were going to do my dad’s honors, our burden was lifted. I can’t tell you how relieved our family was. Mike, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you and your team. My family and I will be forever grateful for what you did. My Dad was honored and we say THANK YOU and May GOD Bless the Patriot Guard Riders.\n\nMike, please pass this on to each and every hero that was out there yesterday honoring my Father and our family.\n\nAgain, thank you so much\n\nGary Randall\n\nOn February 19th, 2021 we laid my father, Bernard “Benny” Mathis Alva to rest with the help of some very special people…It was truly an honorable display of respect for my Dad, a 22 year retired purple heart veteran who also served 3 tours in the Vietnam war.\n\nI wanted to thank all of the special people from the American Legion Riders Chapter 20, American Legion Riders Chapter 26, American Legion Riders Chapter 221, American Legion Post 711, Bob Meyers and the Patriot Guard Riders and the American Legion Post 20, the honor guards and a special thank you to Mike Smith for his leadership and coordination of the event and his playing of Taps.\n\nWith Mike Smith’s leadership and coordination, The American Legion Riders took my Dad, Benny, on his last ride through the scenic towns of Strathmore, Lindsay and Rocky Hill Dr. in Exeter California and we ended the ride at the Lindsay-Strathmore Cemetery. This is where the Chaplin, Honor Guards and other American Legion members took over and conducted the service, the flag folding ceremony, the gun salute and the playing of Taps. It was truly a beautiful sight to see and would make anyone who saw the ceremony be proud to be an American, especially a veteran.\n\nI know our Dad appreciated it. Thank you all so very much,\n\nFrank\n\nWe would like to thank you so much for your services today at my Grandfather’s funeral. My Grandfather served in the Navy and it was a huge part of his life. I do not know the names of the riders that led our procession today, but I can’t tell you how much we appreciate what they did. The flags flying from the motorcycles made us feel so proud of the life and service of my Grandfather. I did not know about the PGR service until my uncle told us of it, I am so glad he did. Thank you so much for what you do, it means more than you can ever know. We will be leaving a donation for your organization to show our gratitude.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nKaren Hollar (Granddaughter)\n\nKatie Bettencourt (Daughter)\n\nI tried my best to express my sincerest gratitude for to the PGR during their Tennessee Mission to big ole Fayette County, TN as they paid their respects to my Granddaddy Algie Mabone; who served in World War II, in the 92nd Infantry Division also known as the Buffalo Soldiers.\n\nThroughout the course of 2 days everyone was SO kind, not only to the Mabone family but also to ALL of the extended family that came to share in the services for Granddaddy! I heard them sharing stories with each other, inviting the children who were there to hold the flags in honor and not once complaining about the sun that beamed throughout the day.\n\nThank you for making sure everything went smoothly!\n\nI truly thank EACH OF YOU from the bottom of my humble heart not only for your service to the Mabone family but for your service and sacrifice for for our country!\n\nKatia\n\nI just wanted to let the group know that it was an honor to see y’all be there for my Dad, David Jaramillo. Some were already waiting at the funeral home and I was able to speak to a few of them and they gave me so much comfort knowing they were bringing my Father home to God. As sad as my mother and I were,I will never forget seeing people on the street pull over and watch as my fathers casket draped in his American flag and his brothers riding beside him made me feel…it was his last ride. Even as we pulled into the church, the grassy knoll had big flags along the sides going toward the church and then they were all there-waiting for him to go inside the church- saluting him. I was already proud of him but giving him this proper send off will be ingrained in my memory forever. Thank y’all from the bottom of my heart. And God Bless y’all.\n\nElizabeth Jaramillo-Aguirre and Mercedita S. Jaramillo\n\nMy dad, Demax Dewees, age 91 was laid to rest yesterday. We invited the PGR to attend just two days before, and didn’t think they’d be able to attend on such short notice. We were wrong. They started showing up outside the chapel just before the service. When we exited the chapel, a flag line was waiting for my dad outside. My family was overwhelmed by the love we were shown by these men and women, VOLUNTEERS- who had been complete strangers to us. The number of guards actually outnumbered the funeral attendees.The only way I can describe the experience is to say “taken care of”. The moment they arrived, they sort of took over, in the best possible way. From organizing the drive to the cemetery, receiving us there, and the honor and respect they showed for my dad- truly overwhelming. The PGRs mission is to honor our country’s veterans, and they did so, beautifully. But they did so much more than that. Years from now, when I think back to the day we buried my dad, I won’t remember the sadness. I will remember the love shown to my family, and respect they showed for my dad, my hero. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Patriot Guard Riders.\n\nDriving west on a Thursday evening could have been slow, so I drove the backroads the entire way from Shakopee to St Michael tonight. It was a beautiful evening for a drive through the country. In the small town of Fletcher, I saw a group of Patriot Guard Riders on their Harleys as they approached the four-way stop sign ? from my right. I motioned all of them through as they approached turning left, while giving them waves and thumbs up. Then I heard one fella say loudly, “SHE knows!” Honestly, I recognized a couple of the riders from my husband‘s (Harlan Johnson) funeral!! Then I started to cry! Happy tears! It was a great day! Thanks for making it special by crossing my path today – and for being at my husband’s funeral on 6/7/14. I hope you all feel huge appreciation for being there for the soldier and their family. I know Harlan was very proud of his 33 years of service and your utmost respect for him was so very special. Now I get emotional when I hear about or see the Riders, as I know another soldier, widow and family is going to experience your support and warm presence!! ????\n\nI was moved to see the efforts of those who rode with me for the escort to Riverside this past Friday, 10 May. As I may have mentioned, I’ve been honored to ride more than a few missions with the PGR since I joined in 2007, but this one was special as the Hero being escorted was my mentor as a young man.Ray (T-Bone), Greywolf, and all who showed up (we rode with 7 and a trailing cage) were considerate and thoughtful in word and deed. The family and I feel truly blessed to have had such professionalism shine in what looked to be a very wet and cloudy ride!Yes, it did sprinkle a bit on the ride from Hemet, but I’d refer you to GreyWolf for the blessing he shared at the staging before we left to escort the family of our Hero…All in all, it was was a memorable day, made even better with Old Glory leading the way.Again, many thanks for your part!Dallas\n\nI cannot thank everyone enough for their service in this mission honoring a long time friend and shipmate. When I contacted PGR I wasn’t sure if there was time enough to make this happen. THEN, on a cold and snowy day, the dedicated group showed up, honored Beth and those who attended her funeral by standing guard both at the funeral home, during the ride to Arlington, and then at Arlington itself. Everyone who attended was both touched and impressed by the care and professionalism of the PGR. I have a picture which I’d like to send…but not sure how to do that. I’m thinking via email to the Captain of the PGR for Virginia? Please advise.PGR will ALWAYS have my utmost respect–everyone who attended could not agree more. Her brother was so touched by their service during this mission. Thank you ALL for YOUR service in this vital way for those who have left us. May your path be blessed and protected…forever.\n\nThere are bad dreams, there are strange dreams and then there are nightmares. I found myself in my own worst nightmare and I could barely breathe. Everything was wrong. My mind wouldn’t work right. My world was in agony and roaring flames. Nothing made sense. The very thing I was most afraid of was happening and I could do nothing to stop it. Time wasn’t moving in a linear way for me and if you tell me I wasn’t just standing there screaming my lungs out -I’d be surprised. I could not handle that nightmare- but then there you were. Like a rock. Your presence at my brothers funeral will forever be the strength and dignity that kept me human that day. I will always be in your debt. I will never, ever forget what you did for my brother. And for me. Thank you! You have my loyalty. if you ever need it. It’s yours.\n\nLast night was a night that will NEVER be forgotten. What a joyous and heartwarming occasion it was to see that so many fellow Americans would give up their Saturday night to hold an American flag at an airport terminal, while cheering, simply to honor and welcome back home an American soldier from the combat zone (whom they had never met and did not personally know). What a tremendous American tribute and honor. It was one of the most touching moments I have experienced in my 75 short years living on God’s created earth.\n\nI cannot express in words, my gratitude to Kansas City, Mo. area Ride Captain Jim Williams for tirelessly putting this Welcome Home Mission together, with such short notice and jumping through all the hoops required for a group to gather together these days. As the grandfather of the honored soldier (who is so very thankful to have him safely back home) I am incredibly humbled, proud and appreciative to be associated with such an outstanding, patriotic group of like minded people who will go to any lengths to show respect and honor to our American veterans and first responders. THANK YOU PGR.\n\nThough a very sad day seeing a young man giving his life for our Freedom coming home, the Guard’s role in the procession was very uplifting and made us all and helped show our pride of this Great Country. There seemed to be at least 1,000 plus riders from various chapters that rode in it – and I know it impressed us and Jared’s family!\n\nAlso about a year ago I unfortunately came very close to my end and was coming through an emergency operation when I was visited by a St Louis Mo. Guard member who came to see me, Rick Moceri. He is my wife’s cousin and she was very worried and needed help and comfort, and though Ricky did not really know me he rode a fair distance to visit with us. My Wife had to leave for a work shift and Ricky stayed with me and we talked and prayed together. He helped guide me to a better view and gain strength in my life.\n\nSo I can say the Patriate Guard has made a positive impact not only on myself but countless others!\n\nGod Bless You All, and Thank You from the bottom of my Heart,\n\nRich\n\nMy husband, Grant Strahle, passed on November 19, 2019. It had been eighteen years since he retired from the Savannah Police Department and forty years since his retirement from the U.S. Army. It was difficult to decide on the type of final service for him. The service was small for the same reasons as stated above. The service though small was very impressive, the patriot guard providing the escort and the police department blocking off all street ramps it was truly a sight to see. Also with the patriot guard people were getting out of their cars and saluting or at least standing at attention.The Army provided the twenty one gun salute with the Chaplain officiating at the grave side. I know my husband would have been really touched by the showing of this respect.\n\nI would like to thank the patriot guard for their service during my husband’s funeral and being there for me and our family.\n\nWith Respect, Yvonne Strahle\n\nSaturday May 4th we said farewell to my uncle, Staff Sgt Tommy McBride 97, Army Air Corp, WWII. We were greatly blessed to have the PGR stand for Tommy. These kind members were also his pall bearers as I thought it more appropriate to have those who really understand. I do this instead of funeral home staff. The turnout of PGR members that day was amazing. The Guards presence from his arrival at church, escort to cemetery, pall bearers and how on each side they stood in solemn respect. Uncle Tommy would’ve hated the fuss – he always thought someone else was more deserving than he – he would’ve absolutely loved the PGR being with us that day. As a PGR member, I’d never been on the family side. It’s always a privilege to stand for those who gave so much for so many. Thank you all for helping to give Thomas J McBride a very appropriate Send off. Roger & Out “MAC”\n\nThis message is way overdue as my brother MSG Tony J Trapp passed away many years ago. I recently came across the pictures taken at his funeral and saw the Patriot Guard standing to honor him the way you all do and was moved to tears again at the sight of it. What you do means so much to the family members left behind and there are no words to describe my gratitude. Somehow “thank you” simply does not seem sufficient. My brother Tony served 20 years in the Air Force. It was the only job he ever wanted in his whole life. He would have served many more had he not had to be medically retired due to health problems. He passed away unexpectedly a year after his retirement. Seeing you all there honoring him with such dignity when you never even met him is amazing. He would have loved it and I know he was looking down from heaven with a huge smile and maybe a tear in his eye. The Patriot Guard is a blessing and I love you all.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichelle Begley,\n\nProud military wife & sister\n\nThank you so much to the PGR who stood for my friend today. To Rich Vernon, Ride Captain, a very special thank you for putting this together on such short notice. It is always so touching to see the PGR especially knowing that this is truly a mission of the heart. Tim was one of the most patriotic Americans that I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing and was so honored/proud to have served his country. He would have had a smile a mile wide to have seen each of you standing there today.\n\nOn behalf of his family, our sincere appreciation for being there today and for all that you do.\n\nRide safe.\n\nJudy Edwards\n\nFormer President of FL Blue Star Moms\n\nChapter 1 (no longer an active chapter)\n\nIt has only been a few hours since the service but I cannot express enough how much it meant to me to have you guys there at my grandpa’s funeral. Several people commented about how thoughtful and respectful it was to have you guys there and I truly from the bottom of my heart want to thank each and every one of you. I wish I could send a letter to all of those involved. But once again thank you, it meant the world to me. I know my grandpa was smiling down while he was watching ❤️ And thank you to each of you that have fought and served for our country, I am so thankful for our freedom! God bless!\n\nBob, Craft, James,Leonard, Roland, Sam, Mr.Gale,\n\nWords cannot begin to express the range of emotions felt at the sight of the Patriot Guard Riders, first at the funeral home then the cemetery. The kind and sincere words at the service,the beautiful honor these heroes showed our father,grandfather,great-grandfather. In this world today veterans are not always give the respect they deserve so to have these wonderful people give our family their time, respect and dedication is beyond what we ever expected. May God bless and keep you and yours forever in his heart. We are so honored and proud to have you with us at this very difficult time. I know my father was smiling on us all seeing that his service to our country was acknowledged and appreciated. From the bottom of our hearts -THANK YOU\n\nToday in Lenoir NC Patriot Gaurd Riders escorted my fathers remains and our family through town into our family cemetery on Bryant road also known as Bryant Hollar. It warmed my heart. They worked with my eldest brother to arrange everything. His 9 children, many grandchildren, brother, sister, nieces , nephews, and a slew of family are great full. We are warmed, and full of respect and love for what you do . Dad passed July 4th 2020 and with covid plus having a huge family could not do the funeral until now without restrictions. Today I let my first real tears fall for I’m the 7th child but made a promise to her soldier father I would see my siblings through before I grieve. I now feel I can begin my grieving and let go. And his wish for a motorcycle escort came true. So thank you…. Thank you those words will not express enough my gratitude.\n\nThunder\n\nIt hardly seems that an entire month has passed since we welcomed our fallen hero, Ulis C. Steely home from Pearl Harbor where he was killed in action aboard the Oklahoma in the bombing on that horrific day; December 7, 1941. There are not enough words for myself and my husband, Dean, Ulis’s grandson to express our gratitude to the Patriot Guard Riders.\n\nWhen Dean and I arrived at Lexington Airport Gate 5 to be led onto the tarmac we could not believe our eyes. The sight of over one hundred bikes and cars lined up waiting for the plane carrying Ulis home was breathtaking. We were both in tears as we rounded the corner and saw the rows of people waiting to welcome Ulis home.\n\nAs we got out, we met family members from Corbin for the very first time. There were no strangers in the crowd. Everyone was there for the same reason, and every single soul welcomed us with a handshake or a warm embrace. We were all family.\n\nRiders paid Ulis an unbelievable honor with their escort home from Lexington Airport. Their members posted guard 24/7 watching guard over Ulis overnight while he rested in the Hart Funeral Home awaiting his funeral the following day. The morning of the services, we were led by a full escort with Amazing Grace playing from the rider just behind the hearse as Ulis made his way up the approached to the Church on the Hill. Flags lined the entire length of the long driveway as we made our way along the drive and into the church where his services were held. Again, as we were led to the cemetery, we rounded the corner, and were met with a sea of red, white and blue flags flying in Ulis’s honor. The time and thought that was given into placing each of those flags with care was not over-looked by the grateful family as we pulled up just behind the hearse and watched as the Navy unloaded the titanium hearse out of the rear of the car.\n\nThank you to the Patriot Guard Riders of Southeast Kentucky, we are forever in your debt. The honor and distinction the men and women displayed as they paid their respects for our grandfather renewed our faith in mankind.\n\nGary Sweeny out-did himself as the Ride Captain for this mission, and we want to personally thank BT Barnett and his friends who stood watch over Ulis all night long before the funeral, and personally placed all those beautiful flags at the church and the cemetery. We cannot begin to tell each and every one of you who made this such a hero’s welcome home how much the contribution of your time and honor meant to us. We met friends we will cherish the rest of our lives. Thank you to each and every one of you. You all know who you are.\n\nDear Patriot Guard,\n\nI want to thank all of you for your service to America and to our Veterans.\n\nMy 95 year old proud American father was buried on January 21, 2020 at Bethel Presbyterian Church in Cornelius, NC. It was a cold and sunny day. ( a great day for a bird hunt!)\n\nThe evening before you set large American flags around the parking lot. A stunning sight for everyone who passed the church.\n\nEarly, before most folks arrived for the service, your men and women were in position at the church entrance. It was a glorious morning for a goodbye to a brave Air Force Vet who flew 32 missions over Germany in a B-24 and flew fuel to Patton in Africa.\n\nAfter the service, the Patriot Guard followed the bagpiper … and led us all to the visitation at the back of the church. Anyone who was there will never forget.\n\nOur family thanks you for your support.\n\nAlways,\n\nCoco McConnell Killian\n\nAll I can say is, WOW! My mom passed away in December. We buried her on Jan 23rd. The weather was less than desirable. My brother and I were given permission by Joint Base Lewis-McChord to personally drive our mom from Seattle, WA to Warrenton, OR. We had several scheduled stops along the way to “pick-up” friends and family who wanted to join our rolling escort. We picked up the PGR’s along our route. Those riders took wind and rain to the face at 65mph for just about two hours. They gave no grief about their ride. They gave nothing but love and a lot of wet hugs! After our wet ride they stood graveside in our very small graveyard and held flags while military representatives conducted my mothers burial. Then, like that, they were on their chariots of glory and rode off into the sunset before anyone (myself or my brother) had a chance to give one last “Thank You.” Amazing. Amazing. Amazing! Nothing but love and respect from them that I want to reciprocate and emulate! Thank you, Southwest Washington Chapter and to you, Chuck for organizing everything on your end!"
