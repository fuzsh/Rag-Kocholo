        "text": "A Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association member since 1985, Skelton won his first Ellensburg title in 1990, partnering with Jake Milton to win the three-head average here with a 20.6-second aggregate.\n\n“I think that was the only time we roped together all year,” Skelton said by phone in mid-August. “I think I had $28,000 won after I won y’alls rodeo. Man, that wouldn’t be much now,” he laughed about how much world standings have changed over the years. “Winning Ellensburg secured my first NFR.”\n\nIndeed, it did. Skelton first trip to the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas foreshadowed things to come – much bigger things to come. It was the first of 22 career qualifications to the biggest rodeo of the year and the first of 17 straight years making it to the NFR.\n\nWhile Skelton roped with a handful of partners early in his career, he teamed up with three-time world champion Tee Woolman for a few years in the early and mid-1990s, earning a handful of NFR qualifications together. However, with Woolman easing his travel schedule Skelton connected with Williams in what turned out to be a duo that may never be matched. It was clear from the get-go they were always going to be in the mix at ever rodeo town.\n\n“Everything started off good,” Skelton remembered. “Every morning when Speedy and I woke up and got out of the trailers, all we thought of was winning championships. When you’re at that level, your partner wants to do good just like you do. They have their goals. Everyone had good horses, they put in the time and effort.”\n\nThey won it all in 1997, again in 1998. 1999? Yep, that was their gold buckle again. Eight straight years – 1997 through 2004 – the team roping gold buckle was theirs.\n\n“Eight years, good horses, the right goals, and we had some luck too,” Skelton said. “The ball bounced our way several times. “There were several years where we could’ve gotten beat, but everything just worked out.” One could easily argue they created their luck with focus, practice and good horsepower though.\n\nSkelton and Williams had the fast time at the Ellensburg Rodeo in 1996 (5.6 seconds) as well as 1999 (5.3 seconds). In 2003, they teamed up to win the average with a 17.5 on three runs. The team won plenty in go-round and average checks in the years they didn’t win it all here.\n\nFans and fellow ropers immediately recognized the dominance and the catchy phrase “If you want to get ‘Rich’ you have to have ‘Speed’” caught on early in the partnership.\n\n“I guess that was right,” he said. “It was for us.”\n\nThe duo roped together through the 2005 season and was a factor in the world race until Clay Tryan and Patrick Smith finished as champions.\n\nSkelton kept roping full-time for many years. He partnered with 26-time world champion Trevor Brazile, also an Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame inductee, going to the NFR in 2006 together. He made the finals in 2009 (with David Key) and 2010 (with Travis Tryan), before going three years in a row with Nick Sartain from 2013 through 2015.\n\nIn fact, in 2013 Sartain and Skelton had the fast time at Ellensburg with a 4.7-second steer.\n\nDespite Skelton’s primary event being team roping, he is an accomplished steer roper as well. Skelton won Ellensburg’s two-round average in 1996 with a 24.4-second aggregate. He made the National Finals Steer Roping in 2007. His steer roping earnings kept him in the All-Around standings for much of the middle of his career, placing fourth in the All-Around in 2000 and in the top 15 for eight years overall.\n\n“I wanted to do something on my own,” Skelton said of the decision to steer rope. “I practiced with Tee and Trevor plenty.”\n\nThe career netted Skelton a few bucks short of $3 million in career earnings.\n\nAll that success showed that Skelton placed a premium on quality horses. His horse Chili Dog earned PRCA/AQHA Horse of the Year honors four times in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2001. Later, Roany got the same nod in 2004 and 2005. Another horse, Z, was third in the 2006 voting. Skelton also said while his horse Gambler never received awards, “you could calf rope, team rope, trip steers on him. He’s a good one.”\n\nNow Skelton–the ProRodeo Hall of Fame inductee in 2018–focuses on roping clinics and helping his wife Rhonda and his daughter Rainey on the rodeo road. Both ladies barrel race and 19-year-old Rainey is No. 1 in this year’s Women’s Professional Rodeo Association’s rookie standings.\n\nThe clinics and barrel racing keep the guy busy to say the least.\n\n“I’ve accomplished everything I’ve wanted to in roping,” he said, including wins at Ellensburg. “Ellensburg is a great town,” he said. “We went to a lot of rodeos, and we actually called that area home (during the northwest run of rodeos). When the rodeo is on, everyone in town is there and knows about the rodeo. When you get to Ellensburg it shuts down and its only focus rodeo. It’s very cool.”\n\nA rookie in 1994, Ohl visited Ellensburg throughout his career and won his first average buckle here during Labor Day weekend in 1996. While it was foreshadowing more buckles to come in Ellensburg and beyond, it wasn’t as though he was new to the scene when it came to victories. Ohl was winning right from the start of his professional career, earning the PRCA’s rookie of the year honors in 1994 on his way to the first of 20 National Finals Rodeo qualifications.\n\n“I was just doing what I love and picking up checks,” he told NFR Extra during an October 2021 podcast.\n\nOhl, who turns 50 next month, fought to keep himself within reach of a gold buckle each year and fans can’t look at his career without looking at parallel careers of other ropers during his time. In 1997, it was once again Ohl and fellow calf roper Fred Whitfield (an eight-time world champion himself) battling for the standings lead throughout the year, where it came down to the last day before Ohl was crowned with his first world title, winning the calf roping championship by $5,031 over Whitfield.\n\n“It’s not like I remember it happening like it happened yesterday, but the very first one, will always mean the most,” Ohl told NFR Extra. “All of the blood, sweat, and tears, not knowing if you’ll ever win one. And to get that first one is just so rewarding.\n\n“All of them buckles have that special story, but that first gold buckle is so rewarding. So much blood on your hands from practicing so much, so many miles to get to that next rodeo. To finally get it was unreal.”\n\nPart of what propelled Ohl to the world title was the money he won in Ellensburg. Ohl won the 1997 All-Around here by earning $5,081 between calf roping and steer roping (picking up the two-head win in that event as well).\n\nThe following year, Ohl quieted any thoughts that he would be a one-time champ by storming through the year on his way to his second calf roping world title in as many years. And while he didn’t win the world title in 1999, he dominated Ellensburg, winning the All-Around saddle as well as the calf roping average buckle here.\n\nSome fans and ropers alike may attribute a run or two that defines Ohl’s grit. It might come down to two runs, both ran at the National Finals Rodeo. Ohl ran a 6.5-second calf in the 2003 Finals, a record that he still shares with Trevor Brazile and Shad Mayfield. However, one can’t discount his run during the ninth round of the NFR two years prior, where he barely made the 25-second whistle to count as a qualified time. Ohl missed the calf on his first loop and barely caught the calf on his second try, but while dismounting he planted his feet wrong and immediately blew out his knee. However, with the calf roping and All-Around buckles still in play, Ohl literally dragged himself to the calf to finish his run before collapsing in the arena dirt.\n\n“I can remember that night like it was yesterday,” he said. “I was dragging behind that calf, struggling to get on my feet just to get it tied so I could stay in the average. (A destroyed knee) wasn’t going to be the reason why I lost, because I couldn’t compete on one leg.”\n\nOhl won both the PRCA’s All-Around and calf roping buckles that year.\n\nHe would win two more calf roping world titles in 2003 and 2006 and then proved to everyone he was still a force to be reckoned with when he won the Ellensburg calf roping one more time in 2015, some 16 years after his previous title here.\n\nOhl has won everywhere, winning multiple titles at huge rodeos like the Cheyenne Frontier Days, Reno, Guymon, Okla., and Dodge City, Kansas. But nowhere has he won as many big titles as he’s won with the six here in Ellensburg.\n\nThe Texan has won 52 National Finals go-rounds in the 20 years he competed at the NFR, and is second to only Brazile in career earnings, winning more than $3.5 million in the PRCA circuit, which includes $1.4 million in NFR earnings.\n\n“It’s been one roller coaster ride.”\n\nBoth Ohl and the Ellensburg Rodeo were inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nWhile Cody has rightfully earned so much attention for his success, his horsepower also deserves much credit. And his horses have helped others to success. Shane Hanchey a 13-time NFR qualifier and a 2013 world champion, needed Ohl’s help, and specifically the help of Ohl’s horse, Pearl, right here in Ellensburg. With less than a month to go before the end of the regular season, Hanchey hadn’t wrapped up his trip to the National Finals and then had to deal with hurt horses from his own trailer. Heading into the short round in the final day of the Ellensburg Rodeo, Hanchey needed help.\n\n“2013 was a historical year for me as many know,” Hanchey said of his year he won the gold buckle in calf roping. “But what most people don’t know is if it wasn’t for Cody Ohl letting me on Pearl at the Ellensburg Rodeo, none of it may have happened. Winning Ellensburg has always been a lifelong dream and to do it on a horse of that caliber was truly monumental. Cody Ohl saved my 2013 season.”\n\nWhile Ohl has retired from professional roping, he still looks back fondly on his career as well as his relationship with the fans.\n\n“Not only did I love to win, but I loved to entertain. The fans… I loved to interact with them. When they played my song when I rode up into the box, the crowd, I could feel their energy all through my body.”\n\nHe would leave it all on the arena dirt.\n\n“They knew I was coming,” he said of both the fans and his fellow ropers. “There was gonna be greatness or was gonna be dust.”\n\nAnderson family historian Linda Anderson Dozier writes, “Like many of the early‑day Ellensburg Rodeo volunteers, Clarence Anderson and his wife, Hazel, spent a great deal of their life promoting the Rodeo and, in turn, the Kittitas Valley of eastern Washington. Their children and grandchildren have stayed close to the Rodeo and in a variety of ways made their own contributions to the Rodeo’s success, and the local economy.”\n\nDozier recounts that Clarence Anderson, born in Ridgeway, Iowa in 1898, came to Ellensburg on the train when he was 10. His mother’s brothers ‑ the Johnsons ‑ were early pioneer businessmen in Easton and his uncle Al Johnson built a towering home (later known as the Highway Grille) at 8th and Main for Clarence’s grandmother. While Clarence’s brothers eventually homesteaded and farmed in the Badger Pocket, Clarence built a dairy and horse farm just south of the train depot in Ellensburg. Friends often called him “Sunnybrook” as that was the name of his farm on Anderson Road, just north of where the sprawling Anderson Hay headquarters sit.\n\nHazel Anderson was born on a Methow Valley ranch in 1900. She was the daughter of pioneer Mason Thurlow, who staked his claim in the beautiful Methow after a wagon train trip from Texas and brief residence in the Kittitas Valley (which he reportedly thought was unhealthy after his first wife and several others died). In the late 1920s, Hazel worked as secretary to the president of Ellensburg Normal School, now Central Washington University, and it was there through friends that she met the school’s riding instructor, Clarence Anderson.\n\nClarence raised both light and draft horses. In 1923, he used his draft horses to help clear the grounds that are now home to the Ellensburg Rodeo. A true “horse trader” (by all accounts other than his own ‑ he did not like the term), Clarence was responsible for many from west of the mountains making their first visits to Ellensburg to look at and buy his horses. Most often, these customers would also want feed for their new purchases. Clarence’s help in finding that feed led to the start of Sunnybrook Farm Hay Company, which is now known worldwide as Anderson Hay and Grain Company. Today, the company that Clarence started contributes greatly to the Valley economy each year and is in the third generation of family leadership with Clarence and Hazel’s grandson, Mark Anderson, at the helm.\n\nClarence was a founding member of the Ellensburg Rodeo Posse and was first elected to the Ellensburg Rodeo Board in 1949, a directorship he held for the next 20 years. Always involved in the Rodeo’s activities, Clarence and Hazel also opened their home to many of the visitors, contestants and celebrities who came to Ellensburg for the Rodeo. Hazel did most of the cooking while Clarence invited the people—including Slim Pickens, Monty Montana and many more. Clarence served three terms (1954‑56) as President of the Rodeo Board and remained an active Board member and committee chair until his retirement from the Board in 1969.\n\nThe Anderson’s son, Ron, moved Anderson Hay and Grain (and Valley agriculture) into international markets, developing strong ties with Japan, Korea, Taiwan and other nations. He led trade missions to Asia for Pacific Northwest agricultural interests and headed the National Hay Association.\n\nSon Jerry Anderson ‑ a Gold Card member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA)—made his name in rodeo from inside the arena ‑ first, as a calf roper and bulldogger and later a team roper. In college in 1954, Jerry helped rope and bulldog his much-respected Cal Poly (San Luis Obispo) rodeo team place into second in the nation. After turning professional, he competed in rodeos across the west, wining day money and titles. He won the Puyallup Fair and Rodeo calf-roping twice and placed in both calf-roping and bulldogging in the Pendleton Roundup (in a recent interview Jerry joked that in 1954 he held the Ellensburg Rodeo arena record in bulldogging “for about five minutes” until another cowboy beat his time!). Jerry won Ellensburg Rodeo calf roping go-rounds and the Kittitas County Wild Cow Milking buckles in 1961 and 1975. He has worked the calf chutes at Ellensburg for over 45 years.\n\nMost of all, Jerry is known as someone who has always been ready to guide those who are just starting out in the Rodeo arena. He founded Ropers’ Supply on the old Vantage Highway and served as the PRCA’s spokesman and field man for years. For the past 19 years, Jerry has also played a prominent role in the Valley’s real estate market, specializing in farm and ranch sales. He has been responsible for helping bring a new generation of residents and volunteers to the Rodeo effort.\n\nJerry’s wife, Janis, has been the “roping” Grandma in the nationally famous “Ellensburg Rodeo Grandmas” since the group’s selection by Washington Mutual Bank in the early Nineties. The “Rodeo Grandmas” have put Ellensburg front‑and‑center of more national television programs than any other single story.\n\nClarence’s first‑born son, Ralph Richard, recalls riding in some of the earliest Rodeo parades, and the problems that arose when the horses were all ready for the parade and rolled in the manure pile before they headed to town! Richard left the Valley to find his life’s work in selling packing and shipping containers to the fruit and fishing industries.\n\nClarence and Hazel’s daughter, Linda, was queen of the Ellensburg Rodeo in 1959 and after a brief stint at the Yakima Daily Republic, she moved to Southern California for a career in public relations and corporate communications.\n\nContinuing the family’s support of the Ellensburg Rodeo, Ron and his wife Robin, as well as Grandson Mark Anderson and his wife Carrie, and daughter Linda and her husband Tom Dozier, are all members of the Rodeo’s Gold Buckle Club. Jerry is a past member of the Rodeo Hall of Fame Board of Directors. Richard and his wife are annual visitors to the Rodeo as are many other family members.\n\nIt has been eighty years since Clarence Anderson first drove his draft horse team into town to help build the Ellensburg Rodeo grounds. Since that time, Anderson family members have participated in nearly all of the myriad chores necessary to conduct and maintain the rodeo. The Anderson family will be inducted into the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame’s “Pioneer Rodeo Family” category.\n\nNote: This article is based on the research and writing of Linda Anderson Dozier.\n\nTim Bernard and Leo Moomaw are both Inductees to the Omak Stampede Hall of Fame in tribute their role as 1934 founders of that rodeo. In their final contracting year, the Ellensburg Rodeo Board gave each man an engraved watch expressing gratitude for their contributions to the Labor Day weekend rodeo. Leo Moomaw and Tim Bernard were north central Washington stock contractors. Leo Moomaw, one of seven children, was born to Sam and Ellen Moomaw in Addy, WA in 1894. Although he suffered polio as a youngster, his love for horses helped him overcome any ill effects as he rode to gather the wild horses that roamed the area near what is now Chief Joseph Dam above Bridgeport. That was the start of his rodeoing career as a bronc rider, roper and later a stock contractor. In 1915 a group in Davenport decided to have a rodeo and they contacted Leo to furnish horses. He and some buddies gathered from the hills and drove the wild stock to the site. That started him in the rodeo contracting business.After a stint in the U.S. Army during WWI he resumed his rodeo business with Don Condon and they were in demand whenever cowboys needed bucking stock. Most often the rodeo string was driven to the shows from the ranch near Monse. Meanwhile a cattleman-bank loan officer moved into the Okanogan Valley having trailed a herd of cattle from northern Oregon across the Columbia River to his newly acquired ranch near Loomis.Tim Bernard, born in Chinook, Mont., in 1897, moved with his family to the Prosser area where he attended high school. He worked summers on ranches in Montana, attended the University of Washington and became a loan officer in a Spokane bank. But ranching was in his blood and he was bit by the rodeo bug having had successes as a roper. Before long a partnership formed between the savvy horseman Moomaw and the cattleman-businessman Bernard. “A handshake formed their bond of trust,” daughter Peggy Moomaw Nelson writes in her book in progress, “The Buckin Horse Man,” a biography of Leo’s storied career.\n\nMoomaw’s broncs and steers and a trained crew under his guidance provided quality rodeo and Bernard’s business and sales acumen sustained the partnership from 1933 through WWII.They shared a vision that would bring rodeo into small towns and large cities where crowds would be drawn to see top quality stock and the best cowboy and cowgirl competitors. Tim headed out to sell their idea and Leo prepared the stock to travel, which became even more difficult in 1937 by adding Brahma bulls and Mexican bulldogging steers. (It was an $1,145 investment at the time, Moomaw’s son Wade recalls.) The company was among the first to bring Brahmas to Northwest rodeos. It wasn’t long until the Moomaw-Bernard reputation grew and rodeos across the region, including Canada sought their services. By 1940 they were into Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas as well as Calgary’s Stampede and Cheyenne’s ‘Grandaddy of them All’ Frontier Days. Their partnership also was a key to the start of the Omak Stampede. In 1933 with two other men, they staged the rodeo with portable fences at the Omak athletic field. It was not a financial success and Moomaw-Bernard had to dig into their pockets to bail out that first event which now is known world-wide. Moomaw-Bernard Contracting Co. (MBC) became known for its rodeo efficiency even before bucking chutes were used. They caught and tied the stock in the order they would be used, facilitating saddling which sped up the shows. And competitors knew the prize money would be paid fairly and that MBC stock would give them a good opportunity to be at the pay window. The partnership had many great bucking horses and bulls, but its most famous was Badger Mountain.\n\nLeo’s talent for recognizing bucking stock paid off in 1932. He had heard about a 6-year-old bald faced bay at the Williams Brothers ranch in Douglas County. Neither of the brothers could ride the horse nor break him to plow. Leo took him to the Waterville rodeo grounds for a trial. He got a young cowboy, Henry Michel, to get on the big horse. Michel had just won the Pendleton Roundup bronc riding and with it the Northwest championship. After just four jumps out of the chute, Michel was thrown and carried back to the chutes to recover. Satisfied with what he saw, Leo traded one of his broncs for the horse that would be known for the next 25 years as Badger Mountain. In his first three years in the arena, the big bay bucked off every rider who tried him. Over the years, the horse perfected peculiarities in bucking style that “laid low the aristocracy of rodeo cowboydom,” Moomaw-Nelson writes in her book. Badger Mountain was selected National Bronc of the Year three times and was rated with Midnight and Five Minutes to Midnight as the three greatest broncs of the decade prior to WWII. His rearing, slashing, shaking style had cowboys and fans talking and publications including Time magazine writing about his prowess. As for his Ellensburg Rodeo visits, Badger Mountain threw many a rider but gave championship rides in both the ’39 and’40 rodeos. He was retired in 1950 to Bernard’s ranch and in 1954 was buried on a high knoll near Tonasket. The partnership sold their bucking stock to Ring Brothers of Wilbur, WA in 1946. But in 1953 Leo returned to rodeo to partner with Joe Kelsey and they provided stock to Ellensburg (1953-58) and many other rodeos in the greater Pacific Northwest until he retired in 1960.\n\nThe late Cliff Kaynor, who was an Ellensburg Rodeo director and past president, often said Leo Moomaw and Tim Bernard were men of their word and helped Ellensburg Rodeo through some difficult times. The Colville reservation stockman ranched until his death in 1969. Bernard continued ranching and later moved to Moses Lake where he had a livestock auction business. He died in 1979. Both men have been inducted into the Omak Stampede Hall of Fame.Many rodeo men acknowledge the Moomaw-Bernard stock contracting partnership had a significant influence on the sport of rodeo, especially in the Pacific Northwest and for generations of cowboys past, present and future.\n\nKatherine’s story began much earlier, in the ranching and rodeo country of northeastern Oregon. In the early years of the Great Depression, Conrad Wyss (1903-1984), a Swiss immigrant, married Jetta Bennett (1914-1991), whose family’s roots lay in the American South. The couple began a dairy farm in Reith, Oregon, near Pendleton. Katherine was born in 1936; she had a brother and sister. “Dad delivered Grade A raw milk door-to-door in Pendleton in a panel truck,” Katherine remembers. Conrad also raised oats and alfalfa, and the Wyss family kept riding horses and a team of work horses. Katherine began to ride bareback as a very small child, “as soon as I could shinnie up the horse’s leg!”\n\nAs a child, Katherine attended elementary school in Reith. She later took the bus to Pendleton Junior High and Pendleton High School, where she was a cheerleader. She also swam competitively and joined the “Mustangers” riding club. She fondly remembers Mustangers “playday” competitions, complete with precision drills, track racing, pole bending, “musical chairs,” and “egg races.” Barrel racing, the event in which Bach would one day leave her mark, was still a Southwestern (mainly Texas) competition that had not yet migrated north.\n\nAround the age of 13, Katherine began her formal involvement with the Pendleton Roundup, playing the role of the “captive girl” kidnapped by Indians in the Happy Canyon Night Pageant. She soon rode in the Happy Canyon “quadrille” (a square dance with eight mounted cowboys and cowgirls) and competed in the Roundup’s daily relay races.\n\nIn 1954, she was selected Roundup Princess and in 1955 served in the coveted role of Queen of the Pendleton Roundup. Both years she simultaneously competed in relay racing while performing her royal court duties. “Nowadays, the Pendleton princesses and queen don’t compete in rodeo events while serving on the court,” she notes.\n\nKatherine married Ellensburg calf roper and businessman Jerry Anderson in 1957 and moved to the Kittitas Valley, her home for the next three decades. It was around this time that the barrel racing event, which had come north from Texas, found its way into Northwest rodeo venues. Bach took up the contest mounted on an extraordinary grey quarter horse named Foxy Coke (1956-1984).\n\nFoxy Coke was a race horse she acquired from Virgil Studebaker of Enumclaw; J.B. McMeans was one of Foxy Coke’s trainers. “He was one in a million,” Katherine notes, though she also has much praise for Whiskers and Too-Too, horses she rode from 1981-2001. “Katherine trained many very nice barrel horses,” states cowgirl and former Ellensburg Rodeo Queen Gena McNeil. “I think the highest compliment would be to say that her horses loved her.”\n\nThe decade of the mid-60s through the mid-70s was Katherine’s and Foxy’s heyday, as they won scores of Pacific Northwest Barrel-racing titles. Katherine joined the Washington Barrel Racing Association in 1960 and the Girls Rodeo Association (now WPRA) in 1974. She and Foxy Coke won championships in Ellensburg, Omak, Othello (six times), Yakima (“Yakima was one of Foxy Coke’s favorite rodeos,” she recalls), Joseph, Prineville, Bremerton, Mt. Vernon, Kennewick, Eugene, Yakima, and other rodeos. She was the Washington Barrel Racing Association champion in 1965 and WBRA Finals Champion in ‘66, ’70, ’71, and ’73. In 1974, her first year on the Columbia River Circuit of the PRCA, Katherine was Rookie Barrel Racer of the Year.\n\n“Katherine was, and still is, a real inspiration to many of us,” states Gena McNeil. “She is a horsewoman of the highest caliber and willing to teach those who are committed to learning. She is ever the lady, always composed. I am proud to say she is my friend and is very deserving of this induction.”\n\nKatherine Bach helped pioneer in Northwest barrel racing; she was longtime Secretary of the Washington Barrel Racing Association, and regional representative of the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association. She played a pivotal role in the movement to establish barrel racing as a featured PRCA event. Yet she is quick to give most of the credit to other women she worked alongside. “I was a competitor, not a politician,” she remembers.\n\nEllensburg Rodeo historian and ERHOF inductee John Ludtka remembers Katherine as a “stately horsewoman who dominated Northwest barrel racing as it became more and more accepted by rodeo producers. Her remarkable success made locals proud, and thus made it easier for the Ellensburg Rodeo Board to move barrel racing from a night show slot to a featured event in the daily Ellensburg Rodeo performance.” Ludtka adds, “Of course, Katherine won the premier 1962 competition.”\n\nIn addition to her many rodeo activities, Katherine, with Jerry, raised a son, Curtis Anderson, and worked for the Ellensburg School District from 1971-1979. Katherine later married Courtney Bach (father of PRCA champion heeler Allen Bach) in 1979 and continued to compete in PRCA barrel racing venues. In 1987, Courtney Bach succumbed to cancer; Curtis had died unexpectedly in 1985.\n\nKatherine Bach left the Kittitas Valley for Hermiston, Oregon, in 1987. She continued to race competitively until 2001 when, sixty-five years-old, she retired. “I quit barrel racing three times before I really quit,” she jokes.\n\nToday, Katherine Bach keeps a Pendleton mailing address but leads a roving lifestyle in her truck and camper, following the sun, visiting and working with family and old rodeo friends across the North American West. “I’m sort of a gypsy,” she jokes. She pulls a horse trailer and rides daily. “I always have my horse Boomer. I live a really simple life.”\n\nWhen she learned of her induction into ERHOF, Katherine responded with typical modesty: “I’m astounded,” she said. In fact, Katherine Wyss Anderson Bach possesses an astounding record of barrel racing success that ranks her as one of the Kittitas Valley’s greatest cowgirls.\n\nIn their final contracting year, the Ellensburg Rodeo Board gave each man an engraved watch expressing gratitude for their contributions to the Labor Day weekend rodeo.

But in 1953 Leo returned to rodeo to partner with Joe Kelsey and they provided stock to Ellensburg (1953-58) and many other rodeos in the greater Pacific Northwest until he retired in 1960.\n\nThe late Cliff Kaynor, who was an Ellensburg Rodeo director and past president, often said Leo Moomaw and Tim Bernard were men of their word and helped Ellensburg Rodeo through some difficult times. The Colville reservation stockman ranched until his death in 1969. Bernard continued ranching and later moved to Moses Lake where he had a livestock auction business. He died in 1979. Both men have been inducted into the Omak Stampede Hall of Fame.Many rodeo men acknowledge the Moomaw-Bernard stock contracting partnership had a significant influence on the sport of rodeo, especially in the Pacific Northwest and for generations of cowboys past, present and future.\n\nBut Kendra Santos in Team Roping Journal interviewed Barnes and Cooper about their record, and Cooper said, “That record’s stood for a long time, but it’s really an easy record. It could be broken by 10 seconds. Average 5.9 on 10 runs is nothing. . . I don’t think you can be 3 every time. But you can be 4 every time.” The record has stood for 24 years and counting, but Cooper’s confidence and awareness of what others on the circuit are capable of show just how deeply competitive they are.\n\nBarnes was born April 4, 1959, in Huntsville, Texas. After joining the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) in 1980, he qualified for the NFR his rookie season, heading for Allen Bach. He then partnered with Leo Camarillo, before joining forces with Clay Cooper. Barnes was a Dodge National Circuit Finals champion in 1987, 1989 and 1995. He was also the Turquoise Circuit team roping champion in 1985, 1989, 1992, 1994 and 1995.At the Ellensburg Rodeo, Barnes has won the championship buckle three times: in 1982 with Allen Bach, in 1985 with Cooper, and in 2005 with Kory Koontz. Barnes said, “It has been my dream since I was a little kid to be a world champion. All I ever wanted was to be a champion and wear a world buckle.” At this point, he has enough buckles to outfit every pair of pants in his closet.\n\nA tally of their victories, though, only tells half the rodeo story. Roping is a fundamentally dangerous sport. At the Wrangler National Rodeo in 2005, Barnes had the end of his right thumb torn off, from the knuckle forward. In November of 2015, his horse fell and then stepped on his head. He broke his ankle and suffered a traumatic head injury. He was hospitalized and had to withdraw from the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo that year. In an interview he said, “Cutting my thumb off at the National Finals last December gave me a whole new perspective on roping and life. There’s no telling how many people lose thumbs and fingers in this sport every year. . . I felt bad for those people. But now I have so much sympathy for every single person, because I know all about the pain and suffering they’ve gone through. And the physical part is just the start. You go through a lot of head games when this happens to you. . . . The more people come forward with their stories, the more I realize that I don’t have it half as bad as some of these people I’m meeting.”\n\nAfter his thumb healed, he said, “I can’t feel my rope as much now because so much of my thumb is numb. . .I can’t really feel it when I’m feeding my rope. My rope hasn’t gotten away from me, and everything’s probably pretty much the same. . . my thumb. . .feels kind of like your face feels on Novocain after you’ve been to the dentist. You know it’s there, but you can’t really feel it or control it as well.”\n\nClay O’Brien Cooper, though, has been blessed. He’s been injury-free throughout a long and illustrious career. Hewas the Turquoise Circuit All-Around champion in 1985-87, 1991 and 1993 and the circuit’s team roping champion in 1983-84. He was the Dodge National Circuit Finals Rodeo team roping winner in 1987, 1989 and 1995. He was inducted into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in 1997. He has won at Ellensburg three times, with Barnes in 1985, with Chad Masters in 2012, and was the All-Around Champion in 1992. He has been a champion at over 42 rodeos and has earned nearly 4 million dollars.\n\nHe said, “Since I was a kid, I always wanted to rope for a living. The best thing is being able to make a living for me and my family doing what I always wanted.” Clay O’Brien Cooper was born in Ray, Arizona in 1961, but grew up in California on a ranch in the San Fernando Valley. His stepfather, Gene O’Brien, worked as a wrangler on western movies and television shows like Gunsmokeand Bonanza. Clay started roping when he was five years old and joined a junior roping team. When he was eleven, he had a role playing Hardy Fimps in a John Wayne movie, fittingly called The Cowboys(1972); he had roles in Gunsmoke,Little House on the Prairie,The Apple Dumpling Gang, Marcus Welby, M.D, Cahill U.S. Marshal,and One Little Indian. But it was to horses, roping steers, the arena, and competing with fellow cowboys that he was most drawn to.\n\nSantos wrote that “Jake Barnes and Clay O’Brien Cooper teamed up for a pretty grand total of 14 gold buckles, each winning seven world team roping titles during their reign as one of rodeo’s all-time great Dream Teams. Jake and Clay have 56 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo appearances between them at 27 and 29, respectively, along with a long laundry list of records.” Although no longer a team, they are still out there winning rodeos with other partners, making the laundry list longer.\n\nHONOREES 1923-1945\n\nSchaller Bennett, Frank Bryant, Lou Richards and Lee Scott\n\nInducted in 2003\n\nWhen asked why he became involved in so many Ellensburg Rodeo volunteer activities, Ellensburg businessman Lee Scott used to say, “Well, someone has to chop the wood.” Schaller Bennett, Frank Bryant, Lou Richards, and Lee Scott were all “wood choppers” and they have earned recognition as ERHOF “Honorees.”\n\nSchaller Bennett was a respected Kittitas Valley “oldtime cowboy,” rodeo competitor, and rodeo volunteer. Born into a Issaquah logging family, Bennett came to love horses while driving logging teams above Lake Sammamish. Schaller craved the “cowboy life,” and in 1925 he and wife Lula moved to the Kittitas Valley to live out that dream. They ranched on the Umptanum and Parke Creeks, building a small herd of their own. Every summer Schaller ran his cattle alongside other herds on federal land near Lion’s Rock, and the Bennetts made a tradition of summering at their Lion’s Rock cow camp.\n\nSchaller Bennett’s rodeo career began in Issaquah bronc riding competitions. He captured the Kittitas County Bronc Riding Championship an unmatched two times, in 1927 and 1931. Schaller rodeoed throughout the Northwest in the 1920s and 1930s but was seriously injured while bulldogging in the 1938 Ellensburg Rodeo. Although retired from rodeo, Schaller kept ranching through the death of Lula in 1948 and his second wife Mary in 1974. By the time of his death in 1983, Schaller Bennett had befriended and tutored scores of young Kittitas Valley cowboys who looked to him as a role model. Schaller Bennett was one of “last of the old-time cowboys.”\n\nFrank Bryant pioneered the crucial alliance between the Yakima Indians and the Ellensburg Rodeo from 1923 through 1940s. Bryant was a local game warden, credited with introducing Chinese “ringneck” pheasant and Yellowstone elk to the valley. Bryant lived near Liberty and spoke “Chinook Jargon” a language invented by 19th century white and Indian Northwesterners to facilitate communication. In 1923, the founding rodeo board asked Bryant to coordinate Yakima Indian participation in the first Ellensburg Rodeo. 150 Indians attended, and by 1937 Frank Bryant could report over 100 teepees in the encampment and Indians representing over 20 tribes. “It is by far the largest gathering since the rodeo’s start,” he noted. Bryant was still on board when the rodeo resumed after a two-year World War II hiatus in 1945. He met with Yakima leaders in White Swan, securing promises of 100 mounted Indian participants in full regalia for the ’45 rodeo.\n\nToday, the Ellensburg Rodeo is well known in part for its Indian participants. The Indians’ encampment, open to visitors, and their participation in the opening ceremony, traditional dancing, parade, and rodeo flat races and other competitive events, are essential to the Ellensburg Rodeo tradition. Frank Bryant, working in conjunction with the Yakima Indian people, shares much of the credit for the establishment and nurturing of those traditions.\n\nLou Richards was one of the “founding fathers” of the 1923 Ellensburg Rodeo. He worked as a Rodeo Board Director and Arena Director for over two decades during the rodeo’s formative years. Richards, a local cattleman, was there in the beginning when community members began to plan the first Ellensburg Rodeo. Under County Extension Agent Leonard Davis, Richards served as “straw boss” of hundreds of volunteers who formed the work crews that built the Kittitas County Fair and Rodeo grounds in the summer of 1923. Richards and his men built an exhibit hall and a grandstand with seating for 5000, plus fences, corrals, and a race track.\n\nElected to the first 1923 Ellensburg Rodeo Board, Richards in 1930 took the all-important post of Arena Director coordinating the arena action and keeping the show moving. He served until 1946. It was Richards who helped to plan and coordinate the array of fast-moving and entertaining rodeo events, races, and contract acts that characterize the Ellensburg Rodeo to this day. In 1937, Richards led the Ellensburg Rodeo across the “picket line” of the Cowboy Turtles’ (precursor to today’s Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association), when the professional cowboys went out on strike. In ’38, he agreed to some of the Turtles’ demands and welcomed them, noting “It’s like a homecoming to see all the boys back.” Lou Richards served as Arena Director until 1946, leaving one of the longest and most distinguished service records in the history of the Ellensburg Rodeo.\n\nLee Scott (1891-1983) was an energetic and respected local businessman who became a tireless worker for the Ellensburg Rodeo. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1891, Lee and wife Anne moved to Ellensburg in 1912 to buy and operate what would become Model Laundry and Cleaners. A tireless promoter and booster, Lee Scott joined the Ellensburg Rodeo Board in 1927 and served through 1935; he remained active in the rodeo the rest of his life.\n\nAmong Lee Scott’s many rodeo chores was the coordination of downtown businessmen and service organizations in support and marketing of the rodeo. For example, Scott helped begin the practice of businessmen dressing in western clothes and selling and wearing “rodeo pins” each rodeo season; to “enforce” this practice, Lee formed a “Sheriff’s Posse” akin to the “Kangaroo Court” and “Chamber Cowboys” of the modern era. Lee Scott also organized the annual rodeo dance. Lee Scott’s son Chuck served on the Rodeo Board from 1968-1982 (President ’72-’73) and granddaughter Kelly Scott Mills was 1969 Ellensburg Rodeo Queen.\n\nLee Scott “chopped a lot of wood” in support of the Ellensburg Rodeo. Indeed, Scott and his contemporaries Schaller Bennett, Frank Bryant, and Lou Richards helped build the volunteer tradition upon which the rodeo was, and still is, solidly based.\n\nHONOREES 1923-1945\n\nSchaller Bennett, Frank Bryant, Lou Richards and Lee Scott\n\nInducted in 2003\n\nWhen asked why he became involved in so many Ellensburg Rodeo volunteer activities, Ellensburg businessman Lee Scott used to say, “Well, someone has to chop the wood.” Schaller Bennett, Frank Bryant, Lou Richards, and Lee Scott were all “wood choppers” and they have earned recognition as ERHOF “Honorees.”\n\nSchaller Bennett was a respected Kittitas Valley “oldtime cowboy,” rodeo competitor, and rodeo volunteer.

Indeed, Scott and his contemporaries Schaller Bennett, Frank Bryant, and Lou Richards helped build the volunteer tradition upon which the rodeo was, and still is, solidly based.\n\nHarrel suggested the bank use Kittitas Valley ranch women for the commercial, and his sister Jan assisted the McCann Erickson Advertising Agency when they arrived in Ellensburg in 1993 to interview twenty grandmothers. After much deliberation, and two separate casting calls, they chose Anderson, Golladay, Hunt, and Plass. Weidenbach, Plass’s daughter, who traveled with ladies from the beginning, became a Rodeo Grandma five years later after Golladay’s passing.\n\nAt the heart of the filmed Washington Mutual commercial was the fun-loving notion of older women (the four were aged from 52 to 82) riding the range and “Keeping the Northwest safe for truth, justice, and FREE CHECKING”! The bank dubbed the Ellensburg quartet the “Rodeo Grandmas.” Astride their horses and decked out in full western attire, the Rodeo Grandmas defended the traditions of the Old West, keeping “bad bankers” on the run and making sure the “good guys and gals” won the day. The commercial first aired on January 17, 1994, and Northwesterners immediately liked it and talked about it. The commercial caught fire.\n\nIn later years, the “Rodeo Grandmas” filmed two follow-up commercials for Washington Mutual. The second was filmed in Kittitas County in Caribou Canyon near the Colockum and the other in Los Angelos, CA. Meanwhile, after the first commercial and with an Associated Press story written by Aviva L. Brant in the Yakima Bureau and a photo by Molly Morrow that went out on the wire on April 17, 1994, the Grandmas’ phones were ringing, and they were invited to make what turned out to be scores of personal appearances. Accompanied by their friend, manager and photographer Molly Morrow, they became celebrities, known for their western lifestyle and skills at riding horses, performing roping tricks, yodeling, storytelling, and working with and roping cattle.\n\nMuch of the success of Washington Mutual’s campaign was due to choosing four women who were authentic cowgirls. Janis Capezzoli Anderson was born and grew up in a ranching family in Standish, California. She and sister Joanne helped their parents with ranch chores–working and branding cattle and also herding sheep and doing agricultural work. “My dad didn’t have any sons and so my sister and I became the boys of the family,” Janis told journalist Hanoch McCarty. “My dad called me ‘Toughie’ and he taught me how to ride. Horses have always been in my blood.”\n\nJanis Capezzoli married Jerry Anderson (also a roper and ERHOF inductee) and her daughters Mary Minor and Lori Fishburn attended school here and married local men. Janis has three grandsons, one granddaughter and one great grandson. In years past, Janis and Jerry assisted her daughter and son-in-law Mary and Brent Minor in working their ranch, and her grandchildren include NFR multi-finalist team ropers Brady and Riley Minor. A team roper herself, Anderson has competed and won prize money at roping jackpots, including a second place at Cave Creek, Arizona. “Rodeo is very dear to me and I have wonderful memories of riding in the Grand Entry with the Rodeo Grandmas,” she recalls. “I rode with a great sense of honor and pride.”\n\nPeggy Minor Hunt came to Ellensburg from the small town of Thoeny, Montana with her family at the age of four, and grew up on her parents’ ranch on Wilson Creek, ranching, riding horses, and roping. Peggy (previously inducted to ERHOF as a member of the Minor Family) was a 1947 Ellensburg Rodeo Princess. She married Gerald Hunt, and together they worked rodeos in the US and Canada when they were not ranching. Peggy and Gerald Hunt raised four children: Wayne Hunt, Kenneth Hunt, Sheri Hunt Wippel, and Kristine Hunt Olson, whose children made Peg a “Rodeo Grandma.”\n\nWhen she was a young woman, Peg bought a trick riding saddle from famed trick roper Monte Montana (also an ERHOF inductee), and with her horse, Pepper, was in business as a professional trick rider and roper. Peg Hunt’s trick riding included the Hippodrome Stand and the dangerous Cossack Drag (also called the “Death Drag”) which involves hooking one’s right foot in the stirrup and laying out over the left side of the horse with one’s head almost to the ground. To trick riding, she also added trick roping and would perform the “flat loop, Wedding Ring, Texas Skip and jump through” which involved standing on a horse, twirling a rope, and jumping through the loop. There is a picture in the Ellensburg Public Library’s archives showing her spinning four loops at once: one with each arm, one from her raised right foot, and one from her teeth. It was Peg’s ranch and rodeo background and her rope skills that lassoed her position as a Rodeo Grandma in 1993.\n\n“The sky is my ceiling and the ground is my carpet,” cowgirl Judy Golladay once reflected. She was born Judy Hastings in Everett, Wa and grew up on her grandparents’ western Washington farm. Judy first learned to ride as a child on a borrowed donkey, and she bought her first horse with money she earned picking strawberries. Soon she was racing barrels and pole-bending with western Washington riding clubs and in playdays.\n\nIn 1968, Judy moved east to Colockum Springs Ranch, in the northeast corner of the Kittitas Valley. She bred and raised horses and trained cattle dogs (later a crowd favorite at the Grandmas’ appearances). In 1979, she married Max Golladay, a former Kittitas County Commissioner. Judy and Max had a foster daughter, Peggy Mead of Lake Stevens and two grandchildren.\n\nJudy had been hiring out as a cowhand, riding for the famed Schnebly Bar Balloon Ranch (also ERHOF inductees) and other area ranchers. She could be seen moving cattle with her three well trained cow dogs, Tar, Quil and Jude. She formed the Sage Scrappers, her crew of veteran lady cowhands who worked and rounded up cattle Peg Hunt said Judy “just loved to ride up there on the high range. She said she was near God up there.” And former Ellensburg Rodeo Board\n\nmember Brad Fitterer noted Judy was “a really talented horsewoman who understood cattle and always had a smile for people.”\n\nJudy Golladay died of breast cancer on August 16, 1998 at age 57. She fought the disease to end, evoking the spirit of a saying she loved—“Get western and don’t weaken.” Her wish was to beat the disease and then help and give inspiration to others who were suffering from the same affliction. The 1998 Labor Day performance of the Ellensburg Rodeo was dedicated to the Rodeo Grandmas.\n\nAt 82 in 1994, Lorraine Plass was the oldest of Rodeo Grandmas and became their story teller. A native Nebraskan and Coloradan, Plass had a long history of riding, roping, and chasing down cows. She met her husband George at the Denver National Western Stock Show in 1928, and they had two daughters, Betty Swisher and Chloe Weidenbach. Daughter Chloe became a talented roper and Queen of the Adams County, Colorado Rodeo. Chloe married rancher Eldon Weidenbach and settled in the Kittitas Valley in 1972. Chloe and Eldon had four children, Gwen Green, Wade Weidenbach, Barbara Sheldon and Chris Weidenbach along with 11 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. Lorraine and George joined them in the Kittitas Valley in 1975 and helped out on their 800 acre ranch. At the time the Rodeo Grandmas gained popularity, Lorraine had nine grandchildren and nineteen great-grandchildren.\n\nThe Grandmas’ manager and photographer Molly Morrow said that Plass was “funnier than Heck,” and Lorraine herself said that at the Grandmas’ performances, “Judy takes her cow dogs, Peggy puts on her rope tricks, Janis ropes, and I just open by big mouth.” This was her way of saying that one of her skills was yodeling. In her green fringed-leather jacket, plaid shirt and red neckerchief, faded jeans, and a felt “flat top” weathered cowboy hat, she looked like the grandma lovers of the West wish they had.\n\nAs noted, the Rodeo Grandmas of Ellensburg, Washington, enjoyed popularity that spanned far beyond their Washington Mutual Bank commercials. For nearly a decade, they traveled across the Pacific Northwest and United States. They were special guests at the grand opening of the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. The Rodeo Grandmas appeared at conferences on aging with Senator Orrin Hatch and his wife Elaine, fundraisers, fairs, rodeos, festivals, parades, schools, commercial promotions, retirement homes, and hospitals on behalf of the bank as well as their individual group. They appeared in the Ellensburg Rodeo. Accompanied by Molly Morrow, the Grandmas were also featured on radio broadcasts and regional and national television programs, including the “CBS News This Morning,” “Entertainment Tonight,” the “Rosie O‘Donnell Show” and NBC’s “Today” show. They produced a line of “Rodeo Grandma” merchandise and even wrote a cookbook.\n\nA funny thing happened to the Rodeo Grandmas of Ellensburg, Washington, on Interstate 90 in the mid-1990s. Journalist Hanoch McCarty recounts the story of how the Grandmas, who had become media personalities after filming a series of popular Washington Mutual Bank commercials, were driving home from SeaTac Airport after a bank appearance in Salt Lake City, Utah. The ladies, with their manager Molly Morrow driving the van, encountered a huge traffic jam that formed a bumper-to-bumper standstill near Snoqualmie Pass.\n\nThe Grandmas were sitting patiently in the van when they heard a tap at the window. “Are you the Rodeo Grandmas?,” a driver who had gotten out of an adjacent car asked them. They answered yes. “IT’S THE RODEO GRANDMAS!,” the woman then yelled out to the surrounding cars. “IT’S REALLY THEM!” Instantly, folks left their vehicles and gathered around the Grandmas’ van, chatting and wishing them well. The traffic jam had turned into a freeway autograph party.\n\nAs noted, the great popularity of their 1994 Washington Mutual commercial set the Rodeo Grandmas’ phones ringing with dozens of requests for personal appearances. Inexperienced in their new role as media stars, the Grandmas–Lorraine Plass, Peggy Minor Hunt, Janis Anderson, Judy Golladay, and Chloe Weidenbach, asked their friend Molly Morrow, a local business woman and award-winning rodeo photographer, to act as their manager.\n\nThe ladies formed an LLC, filed their own Washington State brand (Rocking RG), and secured their Rodeo Grandma Trademark. Tacoma-based attorney (and Kittitas Valley rancher) Bill Viert’s guidance and counsel was invaluable to the troupe. Tracy O’Day from the O’Day Group in Seattle was their first publicist, and in later years Lois Rogers from Washington Mutual Bank arranged bank appearances, media interviews, commercials and travel. Dorothy Wilhelm, a Northwest celebrity speaker and television and radio host, became a great friend, interviewer, and on-stage working partner.\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, the Rodeo Grandmas became national celebrities. They appeared at regional festivals, parades, schools, commercial promotions, hospitals, and in the Ellensburg Rodeo, and were known for their western lifestyle and skills at riding horses, performing roping tricks, yodeling, storytelling, and working with and roping cattle. “We’re having a ball. We’re having a blast with this,” Judy Golladay told one writer. “When (folks) recognize us, they start grinning and grinning and grinning (and) pretty soon they’re chuckling. They really enjoyed watching us on that commercial.”\n\nThe Grandmas appeared on regional and national radio broadcasts and television programs, including the “CBS News This Morning,” “Entertainment Tonight,” the “Rosie O‘Donnell Show” and NBC’s “Today” show. One of their most widely-read interviews was with journalist Hanoch McCarty, author of Chicken Soup for Grandparent’s Soul. And the Rodeo Grandmas developed a line of merchandise–neckerchiefs, lariats, t-shirts, and tote bags–that they sold at their appearances. They even wrote a cookbook titled Good Lookin’ Cookin With the Rodeo Grandmas.\n\nThe Rodeo Grandmas’ performances varied in length and components, depending on the audience and the venue. Indoors, Molly Morrow would begin by showing short film clips of the bank commercials and television interviews, and then introduce the Grandmas. The women talked with the audience about their cowgirl lives and answered questions. Each possessed skills that became part of the performance. Peg was a trick roper, while Janis and Judy expertly lassoed a “roping dummy” astride “Handsome Jack”, a life-sized paint horse with a calf on a track they brought with them. Lorraine turned out to be a real entertainer, regaling the audiences with western tales and teaching them how to yodel.\n\nAppearing in an arena, the women demonstrated their horsemanship, while Peg performed her rope trick repertoire and the Grandmas roped real cattle. In one performance of the Ellensburg Rodeo, Janis’ team-roping “rodeo grandsons”–pre-teens Brady and Riley Minor–became part of the show. Judy’s crowd-pleasers were her cow dogs Tar, Quill, and Jude. Judy would show the audience how the dogs would work off hand and voice signals to simulate hunting up cattle.\n\nJudy Golladay’s 1998 death (at age 57) from cancer was met with extreme sadness and she was mourned throughout cattle country. At the time, local businessman and rodeo board member Brad Fitterer noted that Galloway and the Grandmas “have come to represent not only Washington Mutual but also the Ellensburg Rodeo and Kittitas County.” Judy’s empty saddle was eventually filled by Lorraine’s daughter Chloe Weidenbach. A seasoned cowgirl in her own right, Chloe was already a member of the grandma entourage, accompanying her mother and wrangling the Rodeo Grandmas’ horses and stock. Chloe’s role in the performances featured her horsemanship and roping skills. “I’ve learned to put my heart into what I’m doing,” she later reflected.\n\nMolly Morrow has many wonderful memories of the Grandmas’ road trips and television appearances. They were good improvisers, and on the Rosie O’Donnell Show Grandma Judy coaxed the host into trying her hand at lassoing the mechanical calf on a track while seated on their life-size stationary horse “Handsome Jack.” “And when she (O’Donnell) actually roped the thing,” Morrow laughs, “the live television audience went absolutely crazy with cheers and applause!”\n\nMorrow says that, around 2004, the Grandmas began to reduce the number of their appearances and return to their daily lives. Lorraine Plass passed away at 94 on October 20, 2006, and Peggy Minor Hunt passed away at 86 on May 25, 2014, leaving Janis Anderson and Chloe Weidenbach as the remaining Rodeo Grandmas of Ellensburg, Washington. Both will be present at the induction banquet with their families and those of Judy, Peg, and Lorraine.\n\nLooking back on the decade when they were in the public eye, we can ask what it was about the Rodeo Grandmas that so captured the public’s imagination? Peg Minor Hunt probably hit the nail on the head when she said in 1998, “Something about being a grandma and being up on a horse seems to be the attraction.” Hall of Fame board member Joe Powell agrees: “Although in Ellensburg it’s pretty common to see grandmas riding and roping, that image of active grandmas on the ranch struck a chord with viewers, and the grandmas were instantly famous.”\n\nAnd while fusing mythic “wild west” images with those of venerable elders, the Rodeo Grandmas also became role models and spokespersons for their generation of senior citizens. Janis Anderson and Chloe Weidenbach spoke often of the extra energy and feeling that horses added to their lives, and Lorraine said that the Grandmas’ horseback riding “builds your muscles, expands your chest, makes you breathe more deeply…it’s a good clean life.” Peg Minor Hunt told a reporter, “You have to have something to get up for in the morning. When you sit in the rocking chair, you don’t get anywhere.”\n\n“I think I was born to be a Rodeo Grandma,” Peg continued. “Everything in my life seemed to be aimed in this direction. I knew that something special was going to happen in my life, and look, here it is!”"
