It is somewhat a subjective exercise in defining exclusively, \"character actor\", as opposed to leading actor, therefore, what might appear as glaring omissions, e.g., Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn, Walter Huston, P.S. Hoffman,  Robert Duvall, Kevin Kline, James Mason, Edward Norton, Kevin Bacon, and many others known for outstanding supporting roles, may be categorized as predominantly lead actors and therefore missing from the list. But it's just for fun anyway.  (I've included a memorable role or two for each). Expanded to 240 great actors as of 2016.  Enjoy!",

        "text": "Jack Warden was born John Warden Lebzelter, Jr. on September 18, 1920 in Newark, New Jersey, to Laura M. (Costello) and John Warden Lebzelter. His father was of German and Irish descent, and his mother was of Irish ancestry. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, at the age of seventeen, young Jack Lebzelter was expelled from Louisville's DuPont Manual High School for repeatedly fighting. Good with his fists, he turned professional, boxing as a welterweight under the name \"Johnny Costello\", adopting his mother's maiden name. The purses were poor, so he soon left the ring and worked as a bouncer at a night club. He also worked as a lifeguard before signing up with the U.S. Navy in 1938. He served in China with the Yangtze River Patrol for the best part of his three-year hitch before joining the Merchant Marine in 1941.\n\nThough the Merchant Marine paid better than the Navy, Warden was dissatisfied with his life aboard ship on the long convoy runs and quit in 1942 in order to enlist in the U.S. Army. He became a paratrooper with the elite 101st Airborne Division, and missed the June 1944 invasion of Normandy due to a leg badly broken by landing on a fence during a nighttime practice jump shortly before D-Day. Many of his comrades lost their lives during the Normandy invasion, but the future Jack Warden was spared that ordeal. Recuperating from his injuries, he read a play by Clifford Odets given to him by a fellow soldier who was an actor in civilian life. He was so moved by the play, he decided to become an actor after the war. After recovering from his badly shattered leg, Warden saw action at the Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany's last major offensive. He was demobilized with the rank of sergeant and decided to pursue an acting career on the G.I. Bill. He moved to New York City to attend acting school, then joined the company of Theatre '47 in Dallas in 1947 as a professional actor, taking his middle name as his surname. This repertory company, run by Margo Jones, became famous in the 1940s and '50s for producing Tennessee Williams's plays. The experience gave him a valuable grounding in both classic and contemporary drama, and he shuttled between Texas and New York for five years as he was in demand as an actor. Warden made his television debut in 1948, though he continued to perform on stage (he appeared in a stage production in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (1966)). After several years in small, local productions, he made both his Broadway debut in the 1952 Broadway revival of Odets' \"Golden Boy\" and, three years later, originated the role of \"Marco\" in the original Broadway production of Miller's \"A View From the Bridge\". On film, he and fellow World War II veteran, Lee Marvin (Marine Corps, South Pacific), made their debut in You're in the Navy Now (1951) (a.k.a. \"U.S.S. Teakettle\"), uncredited, along with fellow vet Charles Bronson, then billed as \"Charles Buchinsky\".\n\nWith his athletic physique, he was routinely cast in bit parts as soldiers (including the sympathetic barracks-mate of Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra in the Oscar-winning Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He played the coach on TV's Mister Peepers (1952) with Wally Cox.\n\nAside from Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953) (The Best Picture Oscar winner for 1953), other famous roles in the 1950s included Juror #7 (a disinterested salesman who wants a quick conviction to get the trial over with) in Die zwölf Geschworenen (1957) - a film that proved to be his career breakthrough - the bigoted foreman in Ein Mann besiegt die Angst (1957) and one of the submariners commended by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster in the World War II drama, U 23 - Tödliche Tiefen (1958). In 1959, Warden capped off the decade with a memorable appearance in Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959) episode, The Lonely (1959), in the series premier year of 1959. As \"James Corry\", Warden created a sensitive portrayal of a convicted felon marooned on an asteroid, sentenced to serve a lifetime sentence, who falls in love with a robot. It was a character quite different from his role as Juror #7.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 70s, his most memorable work was on television, playing a detective in Asphaltdschungel (1961), The Wackiest Ship in the Army (1965) and Heiße Spuren (1967). He opened up the decade of the 1970s by winning an Emmy Award playing football coach \"George Halas\" in Freunde bis in den Tod (1971), the highly-rated and acclaimed TV movie based on Gale Sayers's memoir, \"I Am Third\". He appeared again as a detective in the TV series, Jigsaw John (1976), in the mid-1970s, Die Bären sind los (1979) and appeared in a pilot for a planned revival of Das blonde Gespenst (1937) in 1979.\n\nHis collaboration with Warren Beatty in two 1970s films brought him to the summit of his career as he displayed a flair for comedy in both Shampoo (1975) and Der Himmel soll warten (1978). As the faintly sinister businessman \"Lester\" and as the perpetually befuddled football trainer \"Max Corkle\", Warden received Academy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actor. Other memorable roles in the period were as the metro news editor of the \"Washington Post\" in Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976), the German doctor in Tod auf dem Nil (1978), the senile, gun-toting judge in ... und Gerechtigkeit für alle (1979), the President of the United States in Willkommen, Mr. Chance (1979), the twin car salesmen in Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980) and Paul Newman's law partner in The Verdict - Die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit (1982).\n\nThis was the peak of Warden's career, as he entered his early sixties. He single-handedly made Andrew Bergman's Der ausgeflippte Professor (1981) watchable, but after that film, the quality of his roles declined. He made a third stab at TV, again appearing as a detective in Die Fälle des Harry Fox (1984) in the mid-1980s. He played the shifty convenience store owner \"Big Ben\" in So ein Satansbraten (1990) and its two sequels, a role unworthy of his talent, but he shone again as the Broadway high-roller \"Julian Marx\" in Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994). After appearing in Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998), Warden's last film was Helden aus der zweiten Reihe (2000) in 2000. He then lived in retirement in New York City with his girlfriend, Marucha Hinds. He was married to French stage actress Wanda Ottoni, best known for her role as the object of Joe Besser's desire in The Three Stooges short, Fifi Blows Her Top (1958). She gave up her career after her marriage. They had one son, Christopher, but had been separated for many years.\n\nCraggy-faced, dependable star character actor Van Heflin never quite made the Hollywood \"A\" list, but made up for what he lacked in appearance with hard work, charisma and solid acting performances. He was born Emmett Evan Heflin in Oklahoma in December 1908, the son of Fanny Bleecker (Shippey) and Emmett Evan Heflin, a dental surgeon. When his parents separated his brother and sister stayed with his mother, while he was farmed out to his grandmother in California. He was never quite settled and his restless spirit led him to ship out on a tramp steamer after graduating from school. After a year at sea he studied for a law degree at the University of Oklahoma, but after two years he decided he had enough and went back to sailing the Pacific. When he returned he decided to try his hand at acting and enrolled at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. His first foray into theatre was the comedy \"Mister Moneypenny\" (1928) (credited as \"Evan Heflin\"). It was indifferently received and Van went back to sea, this time for three years. In 1934 he returned to the stage in the plays \"The Bride of Torozko\" and \"The Night Remembers\", both outright disasters.\n\nHis big break came in 1936, when he landed a good leading role as a radical leftist at odds with the established elite in the S.N. Behrman comedy of manners, \"End of Summer\" at the Guild Theatre. Critic Brooks Atkinson, praising the play and the actors, commended the \"sparkling dialogue\" and \"fluent and sunny performance\" (New York Times, February 18 1936). Katharine Hepburn, who saw him on stage, then persuaded Van to take a swing at film acting and finagled a role for him alongside her in the Pandro S. Berman production Ein aufsässiges Mädchen (1936). Van spent a year at RKO in forgettable films, with roles ranging from a reverend in The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1937) to a top-billed part as a burnt-out quarterback in Saturday's Heroes (1937). By 1939 Van was back on stage, rather more successfully, in \"The Philadelphia Story\" at the Shubert Theatre. The hit play, which also starred Vera Allen, Shirley Booth and Joseph Cotten, ran for 417 performances, closing in March 1940. That same year he appeared for Warner Brothers in the entertaining but historically inaccurate western Land der Gottlosen (1940), Bosley Crowther describing his performance, above other cast members, as containing \"the sharpest punch\" (New York Times, December 21 1940).\n\nOn the strength of these performances, Van was signed to a contract at MGM, where he remained for eight years (1941-49). His tenure was interrupted only by two years of wartime service as a combat photographer with the U.S. 9th Air Force, First Motion Picture Unit, which produced training and morale-boosting short films. Back at MGM, his third assignment at the studio, Der Tote lebt (1941), had proved an excellent showcase for his acting skills. He played Jeff Hartnett, right-hand man of the titular crime figure (Robert Taylor), a complex, sardonic character, at once loyal soldier yet abjectly self-loathing. For his role as the heavy-drinking, Shakespeare-quoting mobster with a conscience, Van got the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor in 1942. He was immediately cast in the leading role as a forensically-minded detective in Der Gentleman-Killer (1942), a film which marked the debut of Fred Zinnemann as a feature director. This was in turn followed by another B-movie whodunit, Grand Central Murder (1942).\n\nThe prestigious--but not always accurate--historical drama Tennessee Johnson (1942) saw Van playing Andrew Johnson, the 17th US president. While the film was a critical success, it did less well at the box office. The New York Times commented on the \"sincerity and strength\" of his performance, adding \"Mr. Heflin, in a full-bodied, carefully delineated portrait of a passionate man, gives decisive proof that his talents have thus far been haphazardly used\" (January 13, 1943). In between wartime service and two musicals, Bühne frei für Lily Mars (1943) and the Jerome Kern biopic Bis die Wolken vorüberzieh'n (1946), Van appeared in the excellent film noir Die seltsame Liebe der Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck (as the inevitable femme fatale) and Kirk Douglas (as an alcoholic district attorney). As the sympathetic gambler Sam who returns to his home town, ostensibly to expose the dirty secrets of the main protagonists, Van had more on-screen time than his illustrious co-stars and some good lines to boot. Van put his tough-guy screen persona to good use in enacting Raymond Chandler's wisecracking gumshoe Philip Marlowe on NBC radio from June 1947, with 19 real-life Los Angeles detectives among the live audience.\n\nDuring the next few years the versatile Heflin dealt capably with a wide variety of assignments. He appeared as a jilted lover in the expensively-produced costume drama Taifun (1947); he was Athos, one of Die drei Musketiere (1948) and an ex-GI on the trail of a psychopathic prison camp informer in Fred Zinnemann's Akt der Gewalt (1948); poignant as the unloved Monsieur Bovary in Madame Bovary (1949); an ex-cop in love with a high-flying socialite in the melodrama Verlorenes Spiel (1949); and a cop whose affair with a married woman leads to a plot to kill her husband in Dem Satan singt man keine Lieder (1951).\n\nThe 1950s saw Van's progression from leading man to star character actor. Having left MGM in 1949, he was signed in this capacity to several short-term contracts by Universal (1951-54), 20th Century Fox (1954), Columbia (1957-59) and Paramount (1959-60). Apart from the big-business drama Morgen trifft es dich (1956), he is best remembered in this decade for his portrayal of western characters with integrity and singularity of purpose: as the struggling homesteader at the mercy of a ruthless cattle baron who befriends Mein großer Freund Shane (1953); the desperate, single-minded rancher trying to get a captured outlaw on the Zähl bis drei und bete (1957); and the tough, uncompromisingly stern father forced to kill his errant son in Duell im Morgengrauen (1958).\n\nWith the possible exception of his sympathetic German captain of a World War II surface raider in the offbeat international co-production Unter zehn Flaggen (1960) (aka \"Under Ten Flags\"), Heflin had few roles of note in the 1960s. He appeared in the calamitous flop Die größte Geschichte aller Zeiten (1965) and the equally disastrous San Fernando (1966) remake. One of his last performances was as the deranged bomber in Airport (1970). His final curtain call on stage was as Robert Sloane in \"A Case of Libel\" (1963-64) on Broadway.\n\nUnlike many of his peers, Van shunned the limelight and was never a part of the Hollywood glamour set. A well-liked, introspective and talented performer, he died of a heart attack in July 1971, aged just 62."
