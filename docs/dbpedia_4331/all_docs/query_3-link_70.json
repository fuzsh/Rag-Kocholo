        "text": "Manchester United were well beaten today by Brighton and once again the club is back in crisis mode. One thing I have learned in my leadership journey is that while having the right people in place is essential, without the right structure what you‚Äôll end up with are very good people hampered from doing their work by a structure that is unhelpful. I have also come to learn that there is a gap between being wealthy and having common sense. No organisation reflects both of these lessons than the club I support; Manchester United. That the club has serially underachieved and underperformed since Sir Alex walked out of the door is no longer news. That the club has staggered from one manager to another has been widely circulated. That the club remains one of the few clubs in Europe that seems never to be able to sell players that are surplus to requirement is another story for another day. This season however the club has managed to take incompetence and bad leadership to a whole new level. I have said to people that one day a whole Leadership Development program may be successfully developed as around Manchester United‚Äôs leadership failure. Last season United went through the whole Ronaldo saga and while many took that as the sign of the wind of change blowing through the club, no one was anticipating the poor on the field performance ans the charade off it that has created this cloud around the club. It all started when the Glazers decided to announce their intension to explore various ownership structures including an outright sale yet almost a year down the line that process has become so shrouded in mystery that no one can tell whether it‚Äôs progressing or it‚Äôs been canned. Then the whole Greenwood saga was so badly mismanaged that if not for the seriousness of the underlying issue it would have been laughable. Now the club is embroiled in how to manage an expensive player who has failed to reach the expectations of the club and fans and the other who hasn‚Äôt set the league alight given his price tag but now battling to save his career given the serious allegations of assault made against him. How can a club that the current owners believe is worth north of US$5bn cannot seem to get majority of its operational and strategic decisions right? #manchesterunited #premierleague #mufc #football #uefachampionsleague #soccer #footballfans #fifa #leadershiplessons #leadership #decisionmaking https://lnkd.in/eueHhyk8\n\nHow do you react when something goes wrong, or you suffer a big defeat? It can be easy to blame, get angry, despondent, retreating into your shell. But the really strong people tackle adversity heads on. They learn from what went wrong. They use the experience to strengthen the bonds of the team, improve processes and preparation for next time. To come back stronger. Watching Gloucester Rugby suffer a 90-0, 14 try defeat to Northampton Saints on Saturday was interesting. No shouting, no blame. They continued to apply themselves but they were simply outclassed. At the end of the game rather than disappearing straight off into the changing room they formed the traditional tunnel to applaud the opposition off the pitch (pretty much a mandatory event in rugby anyway) and then walked around the pitch thanking their fans and speaking to them. Knowing rugby players as I do, they'll learn from this and come back stronger. Whereas if we look to football there are numerous examples of teams giving up when they face adversity. Manchester United at the moment for example. The players are paid so much that they don't really care. They'll get another contract with another team. The manager will get the sack. What do you do in business when you suffer from a major disappointment?\n\nIn 2019, at the Leeds Rhinos, we were terrible We were losing game after game with a great squad. We were so busy fearing what we 'needed to be' and the expectations put on us, we didn't click... We were so worried about the outcome that we forgot to 'play'. We didn't 'play' rugby; we carried out rugby. We closed down creativity. We closed down spontaneity. We were acting and protecting, instead of allowing and connecting. I felt this intuition to get everyone together and lead meetings on who we were. The sessions reaffirmed the importance of the Three C's in my mind. We set a new context, created connection (to self and teammates), freed ourselves up, and allowed authentic choice. And so, a team of tough, tough men, blokes that can deal with incredible amounts of pain, who are mentally tougher than most, found that that wasn't enough. They were aching for connection. To be seen and heard and to have their internal drivers match with what was on the walls. After an 8-game losing streak and three meetings pushing through the fear off the field and dialling in on brotherhood, playing one of the form teams in the competition, we went to their patch, defended our line fully, not conceding one point and won by 10 points. We celebrated the win for sure, and not long after that, we had silverware again. BUT, We celebrated self and team actualization, which we had revelled in ever since those meetings where vulnerability, acceptance and connection were through the roof. I don't care if you're a rugby player, a soldier, a nurse, CEO, or a teacher; You're a human being. Safety and belonging put us in that place of innate well-being and performance. They don't have to be separate. And sorry to disappoint you, but you don't find it out there; you find it right here and now. You can find more details about the talks I deliver on my website: Stevieward.co.uk\n\n#thoughtleadership - Is best always... BEST? Often we see in team sports the better players in their position rise to the top and represent their club 1st teams. ü§î Are the best club players... the best National team players? We have seen in Englands mens #rugby #rugbyunion #football that this isn't always the case! Pundits (often former players) and fans alike have a great understanding of their chosen sport.. yet to hear managers profess they are pleased with at best lacklustre performances understandably grates and generates reaction. Q - At what point does management need to step back and recognise lacking performances are an issue. ‚Ä¢ Its great to win competition group stages yet we need to also recognise easier groups and favourable pathways... and manage expectations. The same parallels exist in business. You can only relay visions and expectations... then it's up to everyone to play their part in achieving the desired outcomes. #besafe #ceos #leadership #business #strategy #riskmanagement #journalism #europeanunion #europeanparliament #personaldevelopment #UN #NATO European Leadership European Commission Skynewsuk.com The Guardian ITV Studios ITV #travel #health #nhs #tourism #hospitality #aviation https://lnkd.in/euEsBGNm\n\nGuess what I spotted at Dunedin airport? The Black Jersey What does this Jersey mean? It depends who you ask I imagine To teams that play the All Blacks they probably know that they‚Äôre going to be in for a battle To NZ rugby players it‚Äôs what most aspire to become, to put that black jersey on or perhaps to create a legacy or to honour that legacy of all the greats that played before them and leave it in a better place once they have moved on. The one thing that everyone can learn from is the standards that the All Blacks set is a continual drive for excellence and that winning is everything. In an age where participation is rewarded without the pressure to get a result, have we become to soft and accepting of ‚Äú AVERAGE or PARTICIPATION MEDALS?‚Äù You either create a focus on winning or a focus on participation. Which one do you prefer? Is the focus on winning to outdated? Be great to get your comments. Do you agree? #sales #salestraining #salestrainer\n\nOur president, Marc Guerrero, met yesterday with one of the most experienced football #executives at the top of European football, the new appointed Manchester United's CEO, Omar Berrada. There is an undeniable fascination with professional #football clubs the world over. But whilst the star players, head coaches and owners typically dominate the headlines, one of the most important figures in any club is undoubtedly its #CEO. What made CEOs successful in the past is no longer enough. The #context in which they operate has become fundamentally more #complex and traditional approaches to leadership are now insufficient. In the past, sporting success led to business success. That relationship is being reversed. In this #changing and increasingly stressful #environment, CEOs must bring to bear a unique blend of skills, experiences, and perspectives, as well as a knowledge of how to leverage the support of the board of directors, to help them run their football club.\n\nThe exact moment when it dawned on me that being a Presenter wasn‚Äôt really my cup of tea‚Ä¶ Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of interviewing football legend Ian Holloway, I came to a realisation that I preferred operating behind the camera rather than in front of it. ‚≠êÔ∏è Sometimes you‚Äôve got to discover what you don‚Äôt want before you know what you do want. You live and learn. Here are my five key takeaways from the man who took both Blackpool Football Club and Crystal Palace Football Club up from the Championship to the Premier League‚Ä¶ 1. Failure can be a stepping stone to success but only if lessons are learned 2. Wake up every morning and be thankful for what you have 3. Never fall into the trap of living / working within the limitations of others‚Äô expectations (Four Four Two üëÄ) 4. Building a team around a set of shared values and goals is a prerequisite of success 5. Always keep the receipts and ensure your expenses sheet is updated regularly üòâ #CumulativeAdvantage #PositiveMindset #CompetitiveEdge #TeamBuilding #Gratitude"
