        "text": "Some 87 yearlings and a single two-year-old filly have been catalogued for the 2021 CTHS BC Yearling and Mixed Sale in, what appears on paper at least, to be among the most solid collections of pedigrees offered for some time.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of yearlings (77) scheduled to come under the hammer at Thunderbird Show Park on September 14 are products of British Columbia breeding programs, with 21 of the 77 the progeny of Stakes-producing mares.\n\nThe solid selection of BC-bred yearlings comes at a perfect time, with incentive schemes now in place that will reward buyers of locally bred yearlings with eye-catching purse-money bonuses of up to 50% between 2022 and 2024.\n\nFeatured among the many catalogue highlights, are siblings to both recent juvenile CTHS Stakes winners - U DID IT (Teide) and MOUNT ASGARD (Sky Mesa) - as well as half-brothers and sisters to the likes of Horses of the Year, HERBIE D (Hip 52) and INFINITE PATIENCE (Hip 83), former Champion juveniles LORD ROSBERG (Hip 71), WISE MARKET (Hip 62) and European Grade 3 winner, GIFTORM (Hip 66).\n\nFirst crop sires COUNTERFORCE (Smart Strike) and RALIS (Square Eddie) are well represented, with significant drafts of ten and eight, respectively.\n\nAmong the Counterforce offering is a half-sister to former Horse of the Year HERBIE D (Orchid’s Devil), leading juvenile STANZ IN COMMAND (Second in Command) and Stakes winners such as MORNING BLURS (Second in Command) and ASSETS INCLUDED (Rosberg).\n\nThe Ralis draft, meanwhile, is headed by a half-brother to impressive recent CTHS Stakes winner MOUNT ASGARD (Sky Mesa) and also includes: a half-brother to Stakes winner RATHER BEAUTIFUL (Malibu Moon); a first foal out of a half-sister to Horse of the Year SNUGGLES (Rosberg) and a colt from a notable European family that includes the likes of Grade 1 performer, SAKHEE.\n\nAs might be expected, there are also solid offerings from the region’s hottest young sires right now in BAKKEN and LENT.\n\nBarely a raceday passes at Hastings these days without a victorious son or daughter of BAKKEN (Distorted Humor) standing in the winner’s circle, while the equally impressive LENT (Pulpit) is riding the crest of a wave - with Washington Oaks heroine BAYAKOA’S IMAGE carrying her sire’s flag high.\n\nBoth Bakken and Lent have quickly established themselves among the leading dirt sires based in Canada. Indeed, Bakken’s 21 winners to date this season place him firmly in joint-second position on the relevant sires’ list, while Lent’s nine winners have him safely inside the top ten, nationally. Interestingly, the average earnings per runner figure are $11,000+ for both stallions.\n\nThe remarkable Infinite Patience apart, Bakken’s highlights include a filly out of former CTHS Stakes heroine NOTIS HER, the first foal (a colt) out of the useful Rosberg mare, OMI, a half-sister to Stakes performer BETATHANABOYFRIEND (Mass Market) and a full-sister to CTHS Stakes winner, DAD’S LEGACY.\n\nAmong the Lent offering are half-sisters to Jack Diamond Futurity winner POWER CORRUPT, Stakes performer HAIDA (Cause to Believe), multiple Stakes winner ANSTRUM (Rosberg) and, of course, a half-brother to U DID IT (Teide), winner of this season’s CTHS Sales Stakes for juvenile fillies.\n\nOld hands, such as the redoubtable SECOND IN COMMAND (Silver Deputy), are in no way eclipsed by these young whippersnappers, however. The veteran stud has a five-strong draft that includes a half-brother (Hip 34) to last season’s CTHS Sales Stakes victress, MI REYNA (Bakken) and a full-brother (Hip 69) to the highly impressive ASYOUBELIEVE, runaway winner of the recent Canadian Juvenile Stakes at Century Mile.\n\nThere are also small, but quality offerings from two stallions at opposite ends of their careers in BC. SUNGOLD (A. P. Indy) has been a constant presence in the winner’s circle for many years and the two yearling fillies by him include Hip 71, a half-sister to former Champion LORD ROSBERG (Rosberg) and CTHS Stakes winner, IRISH LYRIC (Stephanotis).\n\nThe up-and-coming VALUE PLUS (Unbridled’s Song), meanwhile, has three catalogued, including a half-sister (Hip 14) to multiple Hastings Stakes winner, WILO KAT (Katahaula County) and Hip 36, a half-brother to CTHS Stakes winner and Manitoba Derby runner-up, CALL IT A WRAP (Finality).\n\nFamiliar Names\n\nThe sale also sees a handful of BC-bred yearlings by sires based outside our beautiful Province and they look likely to be busy come preview day on September 13: Proven sire MACLEAN’S MUSIC (Distorted Humor) has a half-sister (Hip 37) to last season’s Sadie Diamond Stakes third, KANDY KATIE (Twirling Candy); RELOAD (Hard Spun), last season’s leading freshman in Canada, has a half-brother (Hip 4) to Black Type performer, LORD OF THE NORTH (Numaany); Established sire CROSS TRAFFIC (Unbridled’s Song) has a gelding in the sale from the Grade 1 family of Dancing Forever and Dance Smartly, while familiar names such as PALACE (City Zip), ANIMAL KINGDOM (Leroidesanimaux), MUCHO MACHO MAN (Macho Uno), GORMLEY (Malibu Moon), OLD FORESTER (Forestry), PAYNTER (Awesome Again) and WICKED STRONG are all represented.\n\nHip 30, a filly by Stronach Stables’ former Champion Canadian sophomore and first season sire SHAMAN GHOST (Ghostzapper), is also likely to prove popular. She’s a BC-bred half-sister to Champion BC three-year-old, HUNTERS APPEAL (Successful Appeal).\n\nThe dozen or so pinhooked yearlings in the sale include an interesting selection offered by North American Thoroughbred Horse Company (NATHC). Included in a strong looking draft are Hip 7, a LAOBAN filly out of the Stakes-placed Tiznow mare, PASS PARTOUT. Hip 33, meanwhile, is a colt by Wood Memorial winner WICKED STRONG (Hard Spun) and he’s a half-brother to Grade 1 winner, MISCHEVIOUS ALEX (Into Mischief).\n\nAmong the leading consignors numerically again this year will be Jamie Demetrick as agent for nine catalogued yearlings, including the above mentioned Shaman Ghost filly, as well as fillies by KEEN ICE (Hip 6) and HONOR CODE (Hip 80) who were both secured previously in Kentucky.\n\nThere is also another bumper consignment from Klimes Farm who, either as agent or as direct consignor, have around a dozen yearlings catalogued, including Hip 79, a colt by KLIMT (Quality Road) from the family of Kentucky Oaks winner SUMMERLY.\n\nAll these hips and more represent terrific opportunities for prospective owners to recruit winning pedigrees from far and wide, while still benefitting from the lucrative “Bred in BC” bonuses available in 2022 and beyond.\n\n[ENDS]"
