His wife was: Genevieve Caroline Braun\n\nClick here for The Iceman of the Saddle a detailed view of George's live from Champions by Setback Athletes Who Overcame Physical Handicaps byDAVID K.BOYNICK\n\nClick: The Death of George Woolf, 1946\n\nFor information on his wife: Genevieve\n\nRace Horse Jockey. Nicknamed \"Iceman\" because of his steady nerves and flawless sense of timing, he was born on a ranch in Alberta, Canada. He received his start competing in races at bush tracks and across the border at Montana fairs while a teenager. He suffered from diabetes and had to regulate his diet and exercise which limited his number of mounts. He rode some of the finest horses of his era but considered Seabiscuit the best of all. In the 1938 Hollywood Gold Cup, he brought Seabiscuit from 14 lengths back to win the race. He was the nation's leading stakes-winning jockey from 1942 to 1944. Tragedy struck in the late afternoon during the fourth race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946. George Woolf, aboard \"Please Me,\" was rounding the club house turn when fans saw him slip from the saddle probably unconscious, a symptom of dieting and diabetes, pitching the famed jockey head first into the ground before a stunned crowd. He was taken to St. Luke's Hospital in Pasadena with a brain concussion, and died the next morning. He was enshrined in the Thoroughbred Racing Hall Of Fame in 1955 and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1976. His greatest honor was the establishment in 1985 of the \"George Woolf Jockey Award\" which by a jockey vote nationwide determines the best rider of the year and is racing's most prestigious accolade. His death led to the introduction of the Caliente Safety Helmet that is now mandatory riding equipment. In a church service attended by 1,500 people, Gene Autry added to the sadness with his singing of the western song \"Empty Saddles in the Old Corral.\" (bio by: Donald Greyfield (inactive))\n\nThe Iceman's Watering Hole\n\nGeorge Woolf's Derby, near Santa Anita, was the great jockey's personal haunt. It may still be\n\nThe Iceman Cometh, or at least hisghost does, on nights when The Derby restaurant in Arcadia, Calif., is filled with patrons rehashing the day's card at nearby Santa Anita Park. Some believe The Derby is haunted by the spirit of George Woolf, a jockey known as the Iceman for the way he sat chillily on a horse until the very last moments of a race.\n\nWoolf bought the little restaurant on Huntington Drive in 1938, renamed it in honor of the Kentucky Derby and festooned its walls with racing memorabilia, much of it pertaining to the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs. The Derby has been popular with Santa Anita regulars for almost 60 years; it will be packed nightly in the weeks before the 10th annual Breeders' Cup, which will be held at the racetrack on Saturday, Nov. 6.\n\nThe restaurant's current owner, Chip Sturniolo, 42, is among those who are convinced his establishment is haunted. \"I swear George Woolf's ghost lives here,\" he says. \" Woolf lived above the restaurant, you know. Sometimes, looking through old scrapbooks or walking around, you can almost feel him there with you.\"\n\nPerhaps the ghost likes to admire the Calumet Farm silks the 36-year-old Woolf was wearing on Jan. 3, 1946, the day he suffered fatal injuries when Please Me threw him at Santa Anita. Possibly he inspects the saddle Woolf was given in 1932 by Billie Elliot, the jockey of Phar Lap, the great New Zealand champion whose career—and mysterious death—was the subject of a 1983 movie. Or maybe he looks wistfully at the photos of Kentucky Derby winners. Could the gentle breeze that works its way through the restaurant be a ghostly sigh over the fact that Woolf never won the Derby in nine tries from 1932 to 1945?\n\nTo this day Santa Anita honors Woolf's memory by presenting an annual award in his name to a jockey who exemplifies the talent, honesty and sportsmanship that made the Iceman among the most respected riders of his day.\n\nSo selective that he would seldom accept more than 200 mounts a year, Woolf rode such champions as Seabiscuit, Whirlaway, Kayak II, Pavot, By Jimminy and Challedon. He twice led the nation in stakes victories, in 1942 (23) and '44 (14). His triumphs included the 1936 Preakness (Bold Venture), the 1938 Hollywood Gold Cup (Seabiscuit) and the 1942 Jockey Club Gold Cup (Whirlaway).\n\nHis best Kentucky Derby finishes, though, were a couple of seconds—on Staretor, who finished eight lengths behind Whirlaway in 1941, and Broadcloth, runner-up by 4 lengths to Pensive in 1944. As time passed and Woolf continued to come up short in the Derby, he told friends, \"I guess I jinxed myself when I named my place The Derby. Maybe I'll have to settle for a Derby in Arcadia instead of one in Louisville.\" Indeed, he won the 1945 Santa Anita Derby—a major Kentucky Derby prep—aboard Bymeabond but got off that colt to ride Sea Swallow in Louisville. Alas, Sea Swallow finished seventh, just behind Bymeabond and 18 lengths behind the victorious Hoop, Jr.\n\nIn 1952, Sturniolo's parents, known around Santa Anita as Slugger and Murph, bought The Derby from Woolf's widow, Genevieve, who also let them have the scrapbooks she had kept of her late husband's exploits. In addition she gave them such treasures as the silks Woolf was wearing when he was killed, some of the whips he used in his greatest races, and Phar Lap's saddle. All these are on display in the restaurant's trophy cases, along with such items as the whip the great jockey Earl Sande used in four Kentucky Derby rides in the '20s, a huge panoramic photo of Derby Day in '38, Woolf's bronzed golf shoes and photos of every Derby winner since Aristides in 1875.\n\nOn certain nights, when the restaurant is overcrowded, Sturniolo will allow special racetrack guests to dine in the upstairs rooms where Woolf once lived. Many of those diners probably know little about the Iceman. But they might be intrigued to learn that both times Woolf finished second in the Derby, the race he wanted most to win, he was beaten by a horse from Calumet, the farm whose silks he was wearing during the fatal accident.\n\nAnybody feel a chill?\n\nCurrent pictures of the Derby:\n\nGeorge Monroe Woolf (May 31, 1910 – January 4, 1946) was a Canadian-born thoroughbred race horse jockey and the namesake of the annual jockey's award given by the United States Jockeys' Guild.\n\nBorn on a ranch in Cardston, Alberta, his mother had been a trick rider in a circus and his father rode in rodeos. As such, Woolf was taught to ride horses as a child and as a teenager he rode in horse races and competed in rodeo events in Alberta and Montana. He began racing thoroughbreds professionally in 1928 in Vancouver, British Columbia before going to Tijuana, Mexico and then to Arcadia, California where he would make his permanent home.\n\nUsing Santa Anita Park as his home base, George Woolf became one of the premier jockeys of his era known by fellow jockeys and fans as \"The Iceman.\" He earned the nickname not just because of his renowned patience in waiting for the right time to have his horse make a move, but also because of his totally calm attitude even before major races when he would often take a nap while other jockeys nervously paced about.\n\nWhile he was establishing himself as one of America's leading jockeys, he was diagnosed with what is now known as type 1 diabetes. Only a few years earlier, before the discovery of insulin, such a diagnosis would have been a death sentence. Because of his condition, and the nature of diabetes management in the 1930s and 1940s, Woolf had to regulate his weight so as never to be in a position where he would be forced into rapid dieting.\n\nHis racing success allowed him to accept only a few mounts each week and for years that kept him in the best possible physical condition. Despite his limited number of races and the fact that he had a relatively short career, George Woolf won ninety-seven major stakes races around the United States including the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes, the American Derby and the Belmont Futurity Stakes three years running. He made history in 1935 when he rode Azucar to victory in the first $100,000 horse race, the Santa Anita Handicap, defeating such greats as Equipoise and Twenty Grand. Woolf finished second twice at the Kentucky Derby and won the 1936 Preakness Stakes. He is also remembered for his tactical performance in the famous 1938 match race when he rode Seabiscuit to victory over the heavily favored U.S. Triple Crown champion War Admiral in the Pimlico Special.\n\nDuring the running of the fourth race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946, George Woolf fell from his horse as he rounded the clubhouse turn. Suffering from a concussion, he was taken to hospital where he died the following day. Both the jockeys in the race and the track stewards reported that they had not witnessed any incident that would have caused such a fall and it is generally believed his diabetic condition may have resulted in him suffering a dizzy spell or fainting.\n\nThe shocking death at the age 35 of one of the country's best and most respected jockeys, and a favorite of fans, led to the creation of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. During his career (1928-1946) Woolf had 3,784 mounts, 721 wins (19.1%), 589 seconds and 468 thirds. Following its creation, George Woolf was an inaugural inductee into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955 and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1956. He was voted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1976.\n\nWhen asked which was the best racehorse he'd ever ridden, Woolf answered immediately, \"Seabiscuit.\"\n\nA bronze statue of George Woolf was erected in his honor in the European-style paddock at Santa Anita Park. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nIn the 2003 film, Seabiscuit, Woolf was portrayed by Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens. Stevens had won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996.\n\nFrom another source:\n\nRace Horse Jockey.
