        "text": "FERNDALE — The Humboldt County Fair wanted horse racing to kick off with a bang.\n\nEnter Russell Baze.\n\nThe Hall of Fame and North America’s all-time winningest thoroughbred jockey Russell Baze will help the fair blast out of the starting gate when the famed rider makes a special guest appearance August 14 when the 117th Ferndale race meet opens.\n\nBaze, who recently reached the 12,000 win plateau at the Alameda County Fair in Pleasanton, will be the featured guest during a pre-race seminar August 14, conducted by track announcer Frank Mirahmadi.\n\nTentative plans call for Mirahmadi to conduct a question-answer session with Baze starting around noon on the east side of the grandstand on the Fair’s opening day. Baze will then autograph pictures of the Hall of Fame jockey, along with signing any racing memorabilla that fans bring.\n\nPost time for the first race on opening day is set for 2:07 p.m.\n\n”This will be my first visit to Ferndale, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing the track and meeting the fans,” said Baze. “I have heard so many great things about the Fair, the area and the people.”\n\nThe 55-year-old Baze, who was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga, New York, in 1999, and voted the recipient of the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award by his peers in 2002, has produced a list of riding statistics that are staggering.\n\nAccording to The Jockey Club Information Systems, Baze has won with 24 percent of his North America-record 50,538 career mounts, finishing in the money (1st-2nd-or 3rd) with 56 percent of the horses he has ridden. Baze’s races have totaled 343,354 furlongs, which equals 42,919 miles or well more that 1-1/2 times around the world. And total time elapsed for those races is 1,144 hours, which equals nearly 48 days.\n\nThe native of Vancouver, British Columbia has led U.S. thoroughbred horse racing in victories twelve times, and was honored with a special Eclipse Award in 1995 for being the first jockey to win 400 or more races for four straight years.\n\nIn fact, he has won at least 400 races in 11 of the past 13 years, while dominating the Northern California circuit. Nicknamed “Rusell The Muscle” for his strong stretch finishes, has captured 36 riding titles at Bay Meadows and 27 crowns at Golden Gate Fields.\n\nOn his Hall of Fame career Baze said: “I’m still pretty fit. I”ve got a lot of miles under me. I don’t think my physical skills have diminished any at all. Well, I think I’ve got a couple of years left in me, anyway. Right now, I’m having a blast and have no intention of quitting. I figure in 2016 I’ll have 40 years in, and so, that might be enough. But I will cross that bridge when I get there.”\n\nBaze, who rode his first winner October 28, 1974, at Yakima Meadows in Washington, became North America’s winningest lifetime jockey on December 1, 2006, at Bay Meadows when he surpassed the previous record of 9,530 victories held by the great Laffit Pincay, Jr.\n\nBaze has captured the prestigious Isaac Murphy Award – presented to the North American thoroughbred jockey with the highest win percentage (minimum 500 mounts) – every year since its inception in 1995, except for 2005, when he finished second.\n\nHe has partnered with California trainer and fellow Hall of Famer Jerry Hollendorfer, the third-winningest thoroughbred conditioner in history, to produce 2,522 victories.\n\nThe son of former jockey and trainer Joe Baze, Russell currently lives in Woodside, California, with his wife Tami. They have three daughters and one son.\n\nAmong his best know mounts have been: the brilliant sprinter Lost in the Fog, Kentucky Oaks heroine Lite Light, Event of the Year, Hawkster, Devil’s Orchic, Itsallgreektome, Breeder’s Cup runner-up Soviet Problem, and Bold Chieftain.\n\nCurrently, Baze is second nationally in wins this year with 189 victories–one behind Joel Rosario. He will attempt to move into the lead this Friday when the State Fair meet opens at Sacramento, followed by the Sonoma County Fair meet in Santa Rosa (July 26-August 11).\n\nThe Humboldt County Fair meet will again have eight days of racing on tap starting August 14, through August 25."
