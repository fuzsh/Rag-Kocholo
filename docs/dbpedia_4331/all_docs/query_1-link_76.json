        "text": "Equestrian Canada\n\nTen-time Canadian Olympian Ian Millar of Perth, ON, was recognized as the inaugural recipient of the International Award during the Show Jumping Hall of Fame’s Induction Gala held on Sunday, March 5, in Wellington, FL.\n\n“While induction into the Hall of Fame is for Americans who have had a significant impact on the sport, we wanted to recognize some of the great international riders who also impact show jumping in this country,” said Show Jumping Hall of Fame Chairman, Peter Doubleday. “With that in mind, we initiated our new International Award and we felt that there was no more worthy candidate to be the initial recipient than ‘Captain Canada,’ Ian Millar.”\n\nMillar is the most decorated equestrian in Canadian show jumping history. A two-time World Cup Final champion having won back-to-back titles, he has competed in 10 Olympic Games, more than any athlete in any sport. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986, named Ontario’s Athlete of the Year in 1989, and holds an honourary doctorate from the University of Guelph. Millar was inducted into the Jump Canada Hall of Fame in 2012 and, together with long-time partner, Big Ben, was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nAlso inducted at this year’s Show Jumping Hall of Fame Induction Gala, held at the Wanderers Club, were award-winning rider, trainer, and course designer, Anthony D’Ambrosio, and internationally respected official and clinician, Linda Allen.\n\nPhoto: Ian Millar (right) is presented with theInterntaional Award by Peter Doubleday.
