        "text": "The CTHS Alberta is pleased to announce that Mr. Curtis Stock will be the recipient of the 2023 Ken Cohoe Lifetime Achievement Award at the Night of Champions. The Ken Cohoe Lifetime Achievement Award is to reward lifelong personal involvement and contribution for the love of the Thoroughbred.\n\nCurtis has been a dedicated supporter of the racing industry in Alberta for over four decades and has provided extensive coverage of local and international Thoroughbred racing for the enjoyment of owners, breeders, trainers and fans. His outstanding writing talents have earned him numerous Sovereign Awards for feature writing and newspaper stories. Curtis was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2017 in the Communicator’s category.\n\nThis award winning journalist grew up in Calgary and developed a love of Thoroughbred racing during his high school days, when his school was a short walk to Stampede Park to watch workouts. In the mid-1970s, Curtis accepted a position in the publicity Ontario Jockey Club Publicity department alongside Canadian Hall of Fame member Bruce Walker. He later returned to Alberta for a role with Northlands managing publicity and marketing, with a subsequent appointment leading to over three decades of race reporting coverage with the Edmonton Journal and two with the Daily Racing Form.\n\nMost recently, horse racing fans have been able to enjoy a biography authored by Curtis titled ‘The Turcottes,’ telling the story of the Turcotte brothers who were all North American jockeys.\n\nThe Ken Cohoe Lifetime Achievement Award is given in memory of Mr. Ken Cohoe of Cremona, Alberta; a keen owner, trainer and breeder of Thoroughbreds. The award was established by Mrs. Gina Cohoe. Mrs. Cohoe was also the artist of the bronze trophy named “A Dream Come True” which is presented at Night of Champions. The bronze was in honor of her husband’s achievements as a breeder.\n\nOne of his greatest successes came in 1984-85 with the exploits of the exceptionally talented filly “A Star Angel”, who had been foaled and raised at the Cohoe’s farm. The first recipient of the award was Mrs. Penny Ridge. The presenter was Patricia Cohoe, daughter of Gina and Ken Cohoe."
