I am excited as the big Race Day is finally here at the Merritt Speedway! I’ve wrangled him and my uncle to come with me as all of us are first-timers to the track. Yes, here is to growing tourism in Merritt BC!\n\nRace Day in the Nicola Valley\n\nI loved everything about this day, from the delicious smell of the concession to the children jumping up as the races began. However, watching the crowd, I spied lucky fans scoring the top-row seats. Everyone cheered loudly as their favorites pulled across the finish line.\n\nAttractions in Merritt\n\nAlthough moving here a year ago, I haven’t yet experienced the must-see attractions that my new community has to offer. For example, racing, fishing, camping, hiking, sledding, and exploring the many lakes and hills surrounding us. It’s an absolutely beautiful community, and I’m excited to check it all out!\n\nNostalgia at First Glance\n\nWe pull up and make our way to a thin white building that conveniently says “Ticket Booth” along the side. It is set next to a long row of old wooden blue bleachers. The nostalgia is present as the fresh outdoor air and scenic view bring back memories of country fairs and rodeos of my youth. Above all a great way to spend a day!\n\nCash-Friendly Car Racing in Merritt BC\n\nWe walk up to the ticket counter, meanwhile, the announcer’s voice booms as he shares commentary on the racers, “Fire up your engines, we’re ready for some racing in Merritt BC!” The cashier waves us over, “We take cash only,” she says helpfully. I file that away under Useful Information, as I don’t want to miss out on tickets, memorabilia, and concession snacks. You really will want to put Nicola Valley racing on your activities list.\n\nA Seniors Discount\n\n“Are you a senior?” she asks my uncle, “It depends,” he answers with a grin. “Are you over 55?” she says with a chuckle. Dad’s laugh is the answer as he rags on his younger brother, “Guess who’s a senior now!” It’s always a good time with these two, never a dull moment!\n\nKid Friendly Place\n\nThe cashier takes our cash, “That will be $10 each per senior and $15 for one adult.” However, note that kids 10 and under are free, definitely playing the “cool auntie” card next time the little ones are in town. For those of you looking for fun things to do in the city, it truly is a fun and affordable way to spend an afternoon.\n\nRetro Water Tanker when Racing in Merritt BC\n\nStamped and on our way, I move closer to get a good look at the giant white tanker truck with an exposed engine to laps around the track. Firstly, I notice the sheer size of the tires. Secondly, the rate it travels is at a rocking speed. The track is thoroughly doused with water before the announcer calls the cars to the track to begin grooming it for Merritt Speedway racing.\n\nHear the Car Engines Roar\n\nYou can hear the roar of the engines. As a result, the whole place is beginning to sound like a Ferrari convention. It certainly is a great sound, the rumble sits low in your chest. Subsequently, you can picture yourself strapping into your car and getting ready for your first race!\n\nA Birdseye View\n\nI hunker down on the far bleachers with a side view of the racers coming out of the pit and navigating their first corner. Likewise, the smoke starts radiating from cars still being worked on. We still have 15 minutes until the first race begins. But most importantly, the drivers are ensuring their race cars are safe for a day at the track.\n\nAnnouncing the Starting Line\n\nThe announcer’s voice booms across the field ushering in the starting Line-Up and greeting the fans. Meanwhile, I scan the crowd for those who have arrived early to take in BC’s Fastest Dirt Track. The Merritt Speedway. Moreover, it is not to be missed!\n\nThe Final Lap when Racing in Merritt BC\n\nIn conclusion, the dust settles as the final racing invitational completes its last rounds. Likewise, we raise a salute to the fans, sponsors, and drivers, as the trophies are handed out and the victory lap is taken. A successful season all in all, and happy fans look forward to the new year in anticipation.\n\nRacing into Fall\n\nSubsequently, with the end of the Racing Season, it’s time to get geared up for Fall. For instance, Pumpkin carving, Apple bobbing, Costume hunting, Cider sipping, and Eggnog delighting are just a few of the treats we have in store for you. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll feel you’ve fallen in love with Merritt just a little bit more!\n\nRacing in Merritt BC\n\nNicola Valley racing at Merritt Speedway\n\n4 Season Getaway\n\nTravel and Tourism Guides\n\n“Experience Community Program” is a small and rural community authentic content marketing program.

It is pretty much guaranteed that Lisa will certainly draw some attention and without a doubt capture the audience where ever and when ever she performs this song.\n\nIt is said that Lisa has put out one of the most soulful recordings of her career. Lisa’s career has certainly been a journey and an adventure for her. She credits her life and career to the music as her motivator.\n\nIn Lisa’s own words she says:\n\n“I love what I do. Every note I sing, whether in studio or on stage, is true. It hasn’t always been an easy road. There has been many curves, bumps and detours. But really, it is the love of the music that motivates each step I take in the business. It keeps me moving forward.” Lisa Brokop\n\nIs It Me And You – Lisa Brokop – Country Music Singer & Songwriter on The Journey to The Merritt Murals\n\nIs It Me And You – Lisa Brokop – Country Music Singer & Songwriter is featured on the walls of the Merritt BC Murals. Born June 6, 1973 in Surrey, British Columbia, Lisa made her presence known in the entertainment world by the age of seven. It was then she started performing with her mother, who was a seasoned accordion player.\n\nAt age twelve, Lisa started sitting in on jam sessions with various country music bands throughout Vancouver, BC. By age fifteen she joined a touring band and was off to the races. It was obvious she was destined to be featured on the walls of our Merritt BC Murals located in the Nicola Valley in the community of Merritt BC Canada.\n\nSweet 16 And Beyond For Lisa Brokop\n\n1990 at seventeen, Lisa released her debut single, “Daddy Sing To Me”. The song reached the top ten on The Canadian Country RPM Charts. In addition, “My Love”, her debut album, followed in June of 1991.\n\nAfter graduation Lisa moved to Nashville, Tennessee to further her country music career. While performing at local clubs, Brokop caught the attention of The Nashville Network. The network began to play the video for Brokop’s single “Time To Come Back Home”. As a result they had Lisa make a guest appearance on The Ralph Emery Show. This appearance and a thirty minute showcase resulted in Lisa Brokop getting a record deal with Patriot Records.\n\nIs It Me And You – Singing and Acting in Harmony Cats\n\nBefore Brokop began recording her second album, she starred in the 1994 film Harmony Cats, where she played a country singer who leaves home in search of a big break in Nashville. Lisa Brokop contributed to the movie’s soundtrack and her cover of Tammy Wynette’s 1968 number one hit “Stand By Your Man” was issued as a single.\n\nBack On And Off The Winding Road Of Recording\n\nLisa Brokop’s second album released the single “Give Me A Ring Sometime”, in June 1994. The single made the top 20 in Canada, but unfortunately it only reached No. 52 on the US Billboard Chart. Nevertheless, her first major label album. “Every Little Girl’s Dream”, was released in September of 1994.\n\nIn the meantime ‘Give Me A Ring Sometime’ was charting. However, many Canadian radio stations refused to play Lisa’s music because the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunication ruled that ‘Give Me A Ring Sometime’ did not have enough Canadian Content in the song. Nevertheless, Brokop’s album went on to produce two more top 40 singles in Canada with ‘Take That’ and ‘One Of Those Nights’.\n\n1995 And Lots Of Change\n\nBy 1995, the album was certified Gold by the CRIA, for sales peaking 50,000 copies. Included in 1995 was a nomination for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Also in 1995, Patriot Records closed its doors and Brokop transferred to Capital Nashville.\n\nLisa released her third album ‘Lisa Brokop’ the following year. The album did not do so well. As a result none of the album singles reached the top 40 in Canada or The United States. The failure of the album ended her relationship with Capital Nashville.\n\nConsequently she decided to take some time off and focus on song writing. As a result, some country music stars took notice and started recording tracks she penned, including Reba McEntire, Terri Clark, and Pam Tillis.\n\nChange Brings Opportunity\n\nBrokop signed with the Nashville division of Columbia Records, in 1998, where she released the single ‘How Do I Let Go’. The song reached the top 20 of The Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart and received a nomination for “Socan Song of the Year” at the 1998 Canadian Country Music Awards Show.\n\nIn July of 1998, Lisa released in Canada the album, ‘When You Get To Be You’. It produced five more singles, including ‘What’s Not To Love’ that peaked at No 21. And, soon later, ‘Better Off Broken’ peaked at No. 8 becoming Brokop’s highest charting single on The Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart in 1999. The album was not released in the US and as a result Lisa Brokop left Columbia Records at the end of 1999.\n\nUndeniable Change\n\nIn 2000, Brokop ventured on her own and launched Cosmo Records. It was under this label she released her fifth album, ‘Undeniable’. Lisa Brokop received in 2001 two Canadian Country Music Association awards for Independent Song of The Year for ‘Something Undeniable’ as well as independent Female Artist of The Year.\n\nThe album’s third single, ‘I’d Like To See You Try’, won Brokop Independent Song of The Year as well as Independent Female Artist of the Year in 2002, from The Canadian Country Music Association. 2003 saw her receive another Independent Female Artist of The Year award.\n\nCountry Music In The Merritt Mountains\n\nLisa’s hand print was taken in July 1995 at The Merritt Mountain Music Festival (now the Rockin River Music Festival). Followed soon after by the unveiling of the hand print in Merritt, BC.\n\nAgain Lisa returned back to Merritt BC on Sunday, July 8, 2001 for her performance at The Merritt Mountain Music Festival. Followed, soon later, by the 10th Anniversary of The Merritt Mountain Music Festival in 2002. Then again she returned to Merritt at the launch of the Walk of Stars in 2003. Lisa was the main attraction for the gala which was a huge success.\n\nMerritt BC Murals Downtown Walking Tour\n\nBecause of her desire, talent, passion, perseverance, and dedication to her music Lisa has definitely earned her place on the Merritt BC Murals. Lisa’s mural is located on the side of the Home Hardware building. There was a special ceremony for Lisa to unveil, and sign her Mural in 2006.\n\nHer mural rests on the side of the Home Hardware building located at 1701 Voght Street. Her hand print is located at 2076 Coutlee Avenue.\n\nThe Merritt Mural Project was created in 2005. The Merritt BC Murals were part of a successful program called, the “Merritt Youth Mural Project”. A project designed for working with local young artists and “ youth at risk”. Merritt Murals were painted by muralist Michelle Loughery.\n\nBack On The Road And Going Strong\n\nBrokop’s seventh album ‘Beautiful Tragedy’, was released in August of 2008. As a result, it featured a top 20 hit ‘Break It’.\n\nIn 2013, Lisa returned to commercial country radio and had success with songs ‘Let It Burn’ and ‘Love Me If You Can’ both of which were produced by fellow Canadian superstar Carolyn Dawn Johnson.\n\nLisa put together the new musical venture, ‘Lisa Brokop: The Patsy Cline Project’ where Lisa pays homage to one of country music’s greatest ladies. The project features some of Cline’s classic hits like ‘Sweet Dreams’ and ‘Walkin after Midnight’ as well as some of her own material written specifically for the project.\n\n“I’ve come full circle with this project,” Brokop says. “When I first started singing, I would sing some of Patsy’s songs because I didn’t have any of my own. They are still among some of my favorites today and I am so excited to have the opportunity to honor this amazing lady and the incredible music she gave us!” Lisa Brokop\n\nIs It Me And You – Lisa Brokop\n\nIs it Me And You or is it just just me or is just you that thinks this new song will be the start of a new chapter in Lisa Brokop’s life and career.

During his six decades as a professional singer-songwriter, he achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, as well as his distinctive voice.\n\nJones was frequently referred to as the greatest country voice in the history of country music. He had the ability to immerses himself completely into the lyrics, and convey many emotions while drawing in the listener, letting them feel the emotions like they were living them. He could make you cry with a single note or a simple phrasing.\n\n“It’s never been for love of money. I thank God for it because it makes me a living. But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.” (George Jones)\n\nGeorge Jones and Some Hard Times\n\nGeorge Jones Born on Sept 12, 1931 in a log cabin, on an oil patch settlement in a remote Texas region known as the Big Thicket and was raised in Saratoga Texas.\n\nJones was the eighth child of George Washington Jones, a pipe fitter and shipyard worker who played guitar and harmonica. Clara Jones his mother a church pianist, played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays.\n\nThe sounds of gospel and country music dominated the modest household — and the abusive rages of George’s father, who turned to alcohol to drown his pain when his sister died from a fever.\n\n“We were our Daddy’s loved ones when he was sober, his prisoners when he was drunk,” the singer wrote in his 1996 autobiography, “I Lived to Tell the Tale.”\n\nFirst Step To A Journey\n\nBorn in to poverty he became one of the most financially successful country music artists ever. George got his first guitar from his father at the age of nine. He learned to play it at church.\n\nFrom poverty beginnings and playing on street corners to Nudie Suits and sold out shows. George never ceased to amaze those listening.\n\nAt 11-years-old, Jones started making money as a guitar player and singer in front of a local church.\n\nThe influence of Hank Williams’ songs, heartache as well as joy, and the honky-tonk songs of Ernest Tubb became a major source of inspiration for George.\n\nHank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, heavily influenced George in his formative years. Jones quickly adopted the twisting and turning of syllables, words and phrases, of Lefty Frizzell.\n\nSecond Step To The On Going Journey\n\nAfter his divorce to Dorothy Bonvillion whom he had a daughter with. George did a stint in the United states Marine Corp from 1951 – 1953. He was inactive 1954 – 1956 and officially discharged in 1956.\n\nDuring his Military service he was stationed in in San Jose California. He was able to satisfy his passion by singing and performing in all the local bars.\n\nDiscovered by “Pappy Daily”, co-owner of Starday Records Jones signed with the label in 1953. A partnership that lasted for years, Daily also became Jones producer and manager.\n\nJones first single “No Money In This Deal” released in 1954 received no attention. Three more singles released that year failed to gain any notice.\n\nShirley Ann Corley became George’s second wife in 1954, with whom he had two sons. The marriage endured ups and downs until it fell apart for good in 1968.\n\nGeorge Jones – The Voice Of An Angel\n\n“George Jones was an imperfect man with a perfect voice. He lived like a devil and sang like an angel.” (Ian Crouch New Yorker)\n\n“Why Baby Why” hit the charts in 1955. This was the beginning of Jones positioning himself as one of the most influential singers in country music history. He would become the master of romantic disillusionment that would become his artistic signature.\n\nJones was on the road to success. Daily secured him a spot on “The Louisiana Hayride”, where he was co-billed with “Elvis Presley” and “Johnny Cash”.\n\nHe would never leave the top of the country charts, even though his personal life and professional life would suffer continual turmoil.\n\nAfter joining The Grand Ole Opry in 1956. He would produce a number of hits in the next decade, including “White Lightning,” “She Thinks I Still Care,” and “The Race Is On.”\n\nGeorge released “White Lightening” in May of 1959. It would be his first number-1 single of his career. Staying at number-one for five weeks the song remained on the charts closing out the decade.\n\nTravels Of The Singing Angel Continue\n\nA part of Jones career that is often overlooked is his success as a songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote many of his biggest hits. Jones most favourite song writing collaborator was his childhood friend “Darrell Edwards.”\n\nFamed artists recorded songs written or co -written with George Jones. “Window Up Above” was a smash hit for Mickey Gilley.\n\n“Seasons of My Heart” written by Jones and Darrell Edwards (a hit for Johnny Cash, and recorded by Willie Nelson as well as Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\n“You Gotta Be My Baby” and “Don’t Stop The Music” on his own and co-wrote “Color of the Blues” ( by Loretta Lynn and Elvis Costello), “Tender Years” and “Tall, Tall Trees” (co-written with Roger Miller). (Wikipedia)\n\nJones signed with United Artists in 1962 and scored one of the biggest hits of his career, “She Thinks I Still Care”. His voice had grown deeper during this period and carved the singing style that became uniquely his own.\n\nGeorge cut an album of duets with Melba Montgomery, including the hit “We Must Have Been Out Of Our Minds”. Jones was also well on his way to gaining a reputation as a notorious hell-raiser. (Wikipedia)\n\nOn tour Jones was always backed by the ‘Jones Boys’. Johnny Paycheck was the ‘Jones Boys’ bass player in the 1960’s before going on to his own stardom in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1964, Pappy Daily secured a new contract with Musicor records. For the rest of the 1960s, Jones would score only one number one (1967’s “Walk Through This World With Me”) but he practically owned the country music charts throughout the decade. A number of significant hits include “Love Bug”, 1964’s “The Race Is On”, as well as the 1969 duet album with Gene Pitney.\n\nNearing The End of The 60’s Decade\n\nJones’ binge drinking and use of amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 and he had to be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking.\n\nJones would go to extreme lengths for a drink. The most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley.\n\nJones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. He later described his thoughts in his memoir:\n\n“There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine and under a seat, a key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did.” (George Jones)\n\nJones closed out the 1960’s decade with solo efforts as well as collaborations receiving enthusiastic responses. He married Tammy Wynette and was ready for the next decade and what a decade it would be.\n\nGeorge And Tammy The Reigning King And Queen of Country\n\nJones wrote: “I felt rage fly all over me. I jumped from my chair, put my hands under the dinner table, and flipped it over. Dishes, utensils, and glasses flew in all directions. (Auto Biography)\n\nJones and Wynette met because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths sometimes crossed. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows at the time. The three became friends.\n\nJones went to their house for supper and while she was fixing the meal Wynette and Chapel got into a heated exchange with Chapel calling his wife “a son of a bitch”. See quote.\n\n“After the table flip, Don and Tammy’s eyes got about as big as the flying dinner plates.” Jones professed his love for Wynette on the spot and the couple were married in February, 1969.\n\nNearing The End With Musicor\n\nAt about the same time George and Tammy married. George was unhappy with the sound of his Musicor records and tensions were building between Jones and producer Pappy Daily. Jones blamed Daily for his sound and left Musicor. He had to fulfill his contract with Musicor before they would let him sever all ties.\n\nIn the middle of 1971 Jones severed all ties with Musicor and Daily. He signed away all his rights to the Musicor recordings and signed with Epic in October 1971. Billy Sherrill at Epic Records became Jones producer.\n\nJones and Wynette became known as “Mr. & Mrs. Country Music” in the early 1970s, scoring several big hits.\n\nKicking Off A Successful Career At Epic\n\nSherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are rumored as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound. A smooth mix of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. A far cry from George’s honky tonk roots.\n\nBilly Sherrill was known for his string-laden productions and his precise, aggressive approach in the studio. Under his direction, musicians were there to obey his orders and that included singers. Jones was accustomed to the relaxed style of Dally, the complete opposite of Sherrill. As a result, they got off to a shaky start. The pair soon developed a fruitful working relationship. Sherrill turned Jones into a full-fledged balladeer.\n\nIn Sherrill, Jones found the producer capable of creating the weepy arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded…He summoned for Jones the sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974’s The Grand Tour and 1976’s Alone Again sound better than happiness could possibly feel.\n\nUnlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists. Jones’ voice, with its frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything.\n\nThe success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most longest-lasting association.\n\nJones and Wynette’s Turbulent Years\n\nIn October 1970, shortly after the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was committed to The Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida. He was kept there to detoxify for 10 days before being released with a prescription for Librium.\n\nJones managed longer stretches of sobriety with Wynette than he had enjoyed in years. However, as the decade wore on the erratic behavior worsened.\n\nOne time I woke up at one o’clock in the morning to find George gone: “I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He’d driven that mower right down a main highway… He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she’d come after me.”\n\nPrior to his relationship with Tammy. Over the years, George earned his drinking and drugging reputation by living his songs. His personal life continued to spin out of control. His previous reputation as “No show Jones”, or showing up drunk would once again be his reputation until he quit drinking for good in 1999.\n\nJones and Wynette’s marriage started out with promise. They had great success with a number of their duets reaching the top ten. They both continued to do well on their own with Jones releasing several top charting singles. Tammy gave birth to their daughter at this time and by all appearances, all seemed to be well.\n\nHowever behind the scenes George continued his battle with drugs and alcohol. The marriage was in trouble and would end once and for all on March 21, 1975.\n\nLate 70’s Dark Times For Jones\n\nIn the late seventies, Jones spiraled out of control, falling apart both physically and mentally. A manager named Shug Baggot introduced him to cocaine before a show because he was too tired to perform.\n\nDespite the severe abuse George continued to make interesting music. He began flirting with Rock and Roll, covering Chuck Berry’s “Maybellene” with Johnny Paycheck as well as recording a duet with James Taylor.\n\nBy February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car. He weighed under a hundred pounds. It took him more than two years to complete My Very Special Guests, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support.\n\nIn June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on Ralph Emery’s syndicated radio program and at one point Jennings cracked, “It’s lonely at the top.” A laughing Jones replied, “It’s lonely at the bottom, too! It’s real, real lonely, Waylon.”\n\nDespite his unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at Willie Nelson’s Fourth of July Picnic in Gonzales, Texas in front of 80,000 younger, country-rock oriented fans. A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival but went on anyway. He wound up stealing the show. The Houston Post wrote, “He was the undisputed star of this year’s Willie Nelson picnic…one of the greatest.”\n\nJones began missing more shows than he made, including a highly publicized date at the Bottom Line club in New York City. When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the New York Times called him “the finest, most riveting singer in country music.”\n\nThe 80’s Comeback And Life Turnaround\n\nIt’s no secret that Jones had a long history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, as well as broken marriages that were punctuated by episodes of violence. After an enormous run of early success, by the late ’70s he was virtually washed up, having earned the nickname “No Show Jones” for his penchant of simply not showing up for planned performances.\n\nIn 1980, a 3-minute song changed his life. His long time producer, Billy Sherrill, recommended he record “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” a ballad by Curly Putnam and Bobby Braddock.\n\nThe song took more than a year to record, partly because Jones couldn’t master the melody, which he confused with Kris Kristofferson’s “Help Me Make it Through the Night,” and partly because he was too drunk to recite a brief, spoken interlude (“She came to see him one last time/And we all wondered if she would/And it kept running through my mind/This time he’s over her for good.”)\n\nThe last words Jones said about “He Stopped Loving Her Today” was “Nobody’ll buy that morbid son of a bitch”.\n\nAlthough he had disliked “He Stopped Loving Her Today” when it was first offered to him, Jones ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flailing career. Stating that “a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song”.\n\nLove Conquers\n\nHis life changed after he met Nancy Sepulveda in 1981. After they married in 1983, the straight-laced Nancy Sepulvado Jones righted his messy finances, helped him address his drinking, kept his drug dealers at bay, and helped revive his ailing music career.\n\n“I saw a lot of good in a man who was being totally destroyed.”\n\nI’d heard the horror stories,” Nancy Jones disclosed to PEOPLE, “but I’m of the opinion you don’t believe it ’til you see it. I ended up seeing plenty of it, but we just clicked. I saw a lot of good in a man who was being totally destroyed.”\n\n“They say love can change the world,” the country legend continued. “I’m here to testify that it changed one man.\n\nThanks to Nancy’s love and guidance, George enjoyed career success once more with duets “Hallelujah, I Love You So” with Brenda Lee and “Size Seven Round (Made of Gold)” with Lacy J Dalton. As a solo recording artist, he enjoyed multiple popular singles from his 1985 album Who’s Gonna Fill Their Shoes and his last solo Top 10 country hit came with 1989’s “I’m a One Woman Man.”\n\nDespite George’s career rebound, his still wrestled with his personal demons. “George was the sweetest man you could meet. But when George would drink, there was a devil that jumped inside of him,” Nancy admitted.\n\nRidding The Demon\n\nIn 1999, an impaired George Jones ran his SUV into a bridge near his home, suffering a lacerated liver and a severely bruised lung. After spending 13 days trapped in the hospital, he made a lasting deal with God.\n\n“He said, ‘God if you let me get over this, I’ll never touch a cigarette or liquor again,’” Nancy reminisced. “I was warm all over. This time he meant it.”\n\nThat experience shook him enough to remain sober until his death from hypoxic respiratory failure on April 26, 2013. George and Nancy Jones celebrated 30 years of marriage before his passing at age 81.\n\n“God put me with him to help him get the devil out of him,” his widow concluded. “God put me there to do a job and I did it.”\n\nQuotes about George Jones:\n\n“When you look at all formats of music, George Jones is the most unique stylist, bar none” – B.B. King\n\n“He is a true icon of country music. George Jones is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies. He is a true American folk-hero and we all love him.”\n\n–Burt Reynolds\n\n“If we could all sing like we wanted to, we’d all sing like George Jones.” –Waylon Jennings\n\n“Most people’s voices are a gift from God. With George Jones, I think it started out as a gift from God and then they built a body around it because anybody who has ever wanted to sing country music wants to sound like George Jones” – Garth Brooks\n\n“I bask in the glow of having worked (read played) with George Jones. Gram Parsons must be smiling.” – Keith Richards\n\nJones Love of Traditional Country Music\n\n“I sing top songs that fit the hardworking, everyday loving person. That’s what country music is about,” Jones said in a 1991 AP interview. “My fans and real true country music fans know I’m not a phony. I just sing it the way it is and put feeling in it if I can and try to live the song.” (George Jones)\n\nJones tirelessly defended the integrity of country music, telling Billboard in 2006. Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. “Everybody knows he’s a great singer,” Alan Jackson stated in 1995, “but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station…even though he’s a legend!”\n\nSumming Up The Life Of George Glenn Jones A Country Music Legend\n\nBattling his personal demons along the way, Jones amassed an impressive musical legacy that earned him a 2012 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, among many other honors. He died in 2013, at the age of 81.\n\nJones recorded over 900 songs, and charted more than any other music artist, almost exclusively on the country charts; Jones never charted a hit in the general top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 or any equivalent all-genre chart. As a solo artist, Jones had just three hits make the Billboard Hot 100, the highest-charted of which, “White Lightning”, peaked at number 73. A duet with Gene Pitney also made number 99 for one week. On the country charts, Jones (either solo or as part of duet) placed nearly 150 songs on the charts, including thirteen number 1 country hits.\n\nThere is no doubt that GEORGE JONES helped set the standard for modern country music. It is impossible to overstate his impact as one of the architects of the country music sound.\n\nGeorge Jones Merritt Mountain Music Festival 1993\n\nThousands of country music fans were subjected to stormy, rainy conditions on the first and last day of the First Annual Merritt Mountain Music Festival in Merritt, BC.\n\nLegendary country singer George Jones wrapped up the Merritt Mountain Music Festival on Sunday night, July 11, 1993, in front of thousands of die hard country fans who managed to stick it out through the rain.\n\nThe legend didn’t disappoint.
