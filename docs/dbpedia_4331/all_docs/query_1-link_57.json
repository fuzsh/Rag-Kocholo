        "text": "Odies Fame, a national horse of the year who was purchased in London, was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame Wednesday night.\n\nThe hall marked its 40th anniversary at a gala at the Mississauga Convention Centre.\n\nThe filly pacer who set a world record and also claimed racing honours in the United States, was co-owned by Stratford-area trainer Buddy Wellwood and Norm Amos, a St. Marys veterinarian.\n\nBoth men have passed away.\n\nAccepting the honour of behalf of Odies Fame connections was Wellwood’s wife Linda.\n\n“I know Bud and Norm, Doc as we called him, would be very proud and honoured to receive this on behalf of Odies Fame,” she said.\n\nWellwood told CTV News that many memories came flooding back to her with Odie's induction and it has been an emotional time for the family since the annoucement that the mare would be going into the hall.\n\nAlso inducted was the late Bruce Johnston of Aylmer, in the communicator category.\n\nJohnston purchased The Canadian Sportsman in 1958. He became a watchdog for the sport and penned a popular column, Short Turns as his alter ego, Lance Loser.\n\nHis son Ian accepted the honour of Johnston’s behalf.\n\nHe said his father loved what he did and brought humour to the job. “He ended up writing a lot of funny columns.”\n\nJohnston had a law practice and used his skills in lobbying efforts for racing.\n\nAnother inductee Wednesday was the late John Ferguson Sr., an NHLer who won five Stanley Cups and also had a passion for horse racing.\n\nFerguson’s best horse was Hardie Hanover, Canada’s three-year-old pacing filly of the year in 1994, a winner of the Fan Hanover and Breeders Crown and over $718,000 in purse money.\n\n“Horse racing was in his blood,” said his son John Ferguson Jr., who accepted his father’s honour.\n\nHe said his father, a founding member of the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame, would be celebrating somewhere with a cigar and bubbly.\n\nThe Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame has grown to 450 members."
