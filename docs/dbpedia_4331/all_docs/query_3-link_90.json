        "text": "Mickey acquired a love of flying at a very young age. He earned his private pilot's license at age sixteen and embarked on a forty year aviation career at age twenty. He worked his way up the corporate aviation ranks in single engine Piper's and Cessna's, twin engine aircraft such as the Piper Navajo, Beechcraft King Air, Douglas DC-3, and the Rockwell Commander and Turbo Commander.\n\nIn the late 1970's he graduated to jet aircraft. He flew the Rockwell Jet Commander, Israeli Aircraft Industries Westwind, Gruman (later Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation) Gulfstream I, II, III, and IV, and the Boeing 757.\n\nMickey retired in 2001 as the Director of Aviation for Freeport McMoran, Inc. in New Orleans. He was happiest sitting in the left seat at Flight Level 310. He travelled the globe and had a great time doing it. He was a flight instructor, flew air ambulance, landed on grass strips, lost an engine on a DC-3 over the Gulf of Mexico, and met an unforgettable cast of characters."
