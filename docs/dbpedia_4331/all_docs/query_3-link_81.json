        "text": "The Detroit Tigers are preparing to honour another of their own, following his induction into baseball's pantheon.\n\nThe number 10, worn by former manager Jim Leyland, will be retired by the Tigers on Saturday, in a ceremony before Detroit's game against the Kansas City Royals.\n\nLeyland will not be the first manager to have his number on Comerica Park's outfield wall. Sparky Anderson's number 11 is retired. Hughie Jennings and Mickey Cochrane have their names listed among honoured Tigers.\n\nThe gruff, chain-smoking Leyland managed the Tigers from 2006 until his retirement in 2013. During that time, he won three straight American League Central Division titles and two American League pennants. He only managed one losing season in Detroit.\n\nBorn in Perrysburg, Ohio, Leyland played minor league baseball within the Tigers organization, mainly as a catcher. He stayed on as a coach and manager in the Tigers farm system before joining the Chicago White Sox's staff in 1982.\n\nLeyland became the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1986, slowly turning around a team that had been a doormat for years, winning three straight National League East titles in 1990, 1991, and 1992, and twice being named the NL Manager of the Year. He became famous for a viral clip that showed him giving an unhappy Barry Bonds a stern, profane lecture during Pirates' training camp.\n\nThe then-Florida Marlins were Leyland's next stop, in 1997, where he won his only World Series championship. He left the team after the 1998 season when ownership dismantled the team and began a complete rebuild.\n\nHe managed the 1999 season with the Colorado Rockies, when they finished last in their division. Leyland then spent the next five seasons working for the St. Louis Cardinals as a scout before he joined the Tigers for the 2006 season.\n\nFor the 2017 World Baseball Classic, Leyland was lured out of retirement to manage the U.S. team, winning the title. This made Leyland the only manager to win both a WBC and World Series championship.\n\nLeyland won a third Manager of the Year Award with the Tigers in 2006.\n\nHe was part of the 2004 class of honorees in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York."
