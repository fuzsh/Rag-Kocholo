        "text": "Confessions of a Mechanical Bank Collector\n\nThe Edwin Mosler Mechanical Bank Sale\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  August, 1982\n\nWhen I was first approached to write an article on the dubious distinction of being first in line for the June 2nd sale of the Edwin H. Mosley collection of mechanical banks at the Statler Hilton, my first thoughts were to deny the entire experience. However, after some contemplation, I couldn't resist relating the tale of a man obsessed in his desire to own a bank belonging to one of the most prestigious collectors of all time  the late Edwin Mosler.\n\nThe fact that Ed had taken great pleasure in the ownership of one of my favorite mechanicals gave impetus to my desire to acquire it. The purchase of this treasure involved the planning of how far in advance of the sale must one begin standing in line. A month? Two weeks? A day? After all, the ad announcing the bank sale did state \"choice of banks would be handled on a first come-first served basis.\"\n\nI began wondering if anyone else was already standing in line. The sale was, after all, only six weeks away. I immediately took a discreet stroll up to the sixth floor of the Statler Hilton. Whew! No one standing in front of Suite 600A, the office housing the Mosley collection. I still had time to station a human body in front of the Mosler suite to insure my number one position in line. I found this desperate soul on an unemployment line in Brooklyn, and coincidentally he was in the number one position there. This individual was perfect  a recent graduate from college in need of a job and possessing unquestioning patience. After introductions and discussion of mechanical banks, I was convinced that my search need not continue. I had found \"Ira.\"\n\nOn Friday, May 28, at noon. both Ira and I met in front of Suite 600A. What luck. Only five days before the sale and still no one had arrived. Ira didn't know what to make of the situation, but he didn't object since I had given him his first payment in advance; however, I did catch him eyeing me suspiciously for the next few days.\n\nI proceeded to rent a room on the sixth floor, not more than twenty feet from the infamous Suite 600A, where I slept the next five nights as Ira stood vigil  a beer in one hand and a book in the other.\n\nSaturday approaches: I'm still number one, and Ira is second. We discuss the uneasy feeling that, perhaps, we are wasting our time and have arrived too far in advance. As doubt creeps in, Ira glibly reassures me that\" the early bird catches the worm,\" and asks for his next day's pay.\n\nSecure in the knowledge that my new found friend will hold the numbers one and two spots in line. I remain free to spend my nights dreaming of that \"one great bank\"  the reason I am willing to \"vacation\" at the Statler. The alarm rings; seven hours have passed, and it is time for me to take over for Ira. He informs me that overnight, he had made friends with all of the security guards. In fact, he has convinced them, as well as the hotel guests of the sixth floor, that he is, indeed, one of the security guards!\n\nAs day four approaches. I notice that my protégé is getting caught up in the passions of bank collecting. He actually begins to think he's there to add banks to his collection. Ira rambles on about owning the Mikado, the Bread Winners, the Shoot the Chute. Too bad the Freedmans has already been sold off. With some trepidation, I must burst his bubble. Ira is informed of the prices of the banks of his fantasy. A momentary depression follows, but he immediately bounces back when I tell that we're having his favorite for dinner this evening  Chinese food.\n\nDay five: another standee shows up. Sent by a Mr. S.S. from Chicago, this person stakes out the number three spot in line. Soon afterwards, Mr. I.A.M., another Chicagoan appears on the scene. He is a bit disappointed at the realization that others are ahead of him, but graciously accepts the number four position on the line. It is somewhat reassuring to see other people waiting, proving that there are other obsessed persons in this world of bank collecting.\n\nBefore long, who should appear but the famous toy dealer, Mr. F.W. from Baltimore, Maryland. A look of frustration and dissatisfaction appears upon his face as he sees that there are four people ahead of him. It is difficult for someone as determined as F.W. to realize that others are possessed with equal determination.\n\nAs additional people began arriving, I realized that my first bank choice was also the first choice of 90% of the other collectors. Within three hours, the hallway in front of 600A becomes crowded with people. Suddenly, security guards and the manager of the Statler are upon us. We are told to disperse or \"be removed bodily.\" In an attempt to retain our positions in line, the standees already there form a numbered list as more people show up for the sale, they are assigned a place on that list. Mr. I.A.M. from Chicago graciously allows his room to serve as the registration center and Ira is called upon to register the new arrivals.\n\nThe day of the sale approaches; there is electricity in the warm, stuffy hotel air. People are frantically offering both Ira and myself large sums of money for our places in line. I stand firm, but will Ira submit? No way! Ira can't wait to enter that forbidden room housing 600 of Edwin Moslers mechanical banks. He will actually see and touch many of those elusive objects we so passionately pursue.\n\nThe moment we have all been waiting for arrives  10 a.m., Wednesday, June 2nd. Lines are formed once again outside of Suite 600A according to the numbers on our unofficial list. At that time we are offered official numbered tags that are to be used as admission places for the sale, which will begin at 1 p.m. sharp. As I am handed the small yellow tag with the number \"ONE\" written on it, I may now be assured of that one prized bank which I've been waiting in line for all of these days. Ira is handed the number two tag, Mr. S.S. the number three, Mr. I.A.M. number four. Mr. F.W. number five, and so on, and so on....\n\nAt last, 1 p.m.  \"Sale Time.\" The doors of 600A are flung open and the line of people enter in an orderly fashion (after having been advised if they should become disorderly, they'll be ejected on their butts). As I enter Ed's office the same room in which I've spent so many memorable hours engaged in friendly bank conversation with Ed  a sadness passes over me. Ed's banks, which had meant so much to him, are in evidence, but Ed is no longer here to enjoy them. The outward appearance of the office remains unchanged, but it now lacks the warmth and friendliness imparted by its former occupant. It is with difficulty that I glance at his chair as I pass the large walnut desk. Reluctantly I proceeded to remove my number one bank from its place on the shelf, as well as thirty-seven others for various collector friends.\n\nAfter payment is made, my friend Ira bids me farewell. I am thanked for this unbelievable experience and for the new world which has been opened to him.\n\nAs I leave Suite 600A for the last time, carrying many of the great Mosler rarities, I notice another collector friend has been eyeing me enviously. Not being able to resist the impulse. I stop and ask him whether he thought it was a crazy idea to endure the tedium of waiting just for that number one tag. The collector looks at me, shakes his head, and replies, \"Yeah, crazy like a fox.\"\n\nThe Girl Skipping Rope Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  December, 1982\n\nThis article will deal with \"The Girl Skipping Rope.\" which I believe to be possibly one of the most esthetically pleasing mechanical penny banks ever manufactured. Other mechanical banks may have as their subject matter unsavory depictions of ethnic and racial groups, clowns, animals and bizarre creatures represented oftentimes in peculiar situations, beings having their heads battered, whacked and cracked, and grotesque greedy gargoyles gobbling coins. However, in the Girl Skipping Rope, we see a young beauty who possesses the most delicate of facial and bodily proportions  a bank that truly reflects the innocence and naivety of childhood.\n\nWind up this mechanical bank, deposit a penny and the little girl will skip rope just for your entertainment. Her head gracefully turns from left to right and. as her legs swing back and forth the braided golden rope she holds in her hands passes over her head and under her feet.\n\nPatent papers (figure 2) attest to the fact that the bank was patented on May 20. 1890 by James H. Bowen of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and assigned U.S. Pat, No. 428,450. (An interesting observation was the fact that the patent papers depict a Negro girl rather than a Caucasian.) The Girl Skipping Rope was manufactured by the Stevens Company, an iron foundry, located in Cromwell, Connecticut. Incidentally, an early Stevens' catalog identified this mechanical as \"The Jumping Rope Bank.\"\n\nIt can be said that much of the rarity of this bank is attributed to the difficulty the Stevens Company had in casting the delicate open floral designs of the external casing that houses the bank's gears, spring and fly wheel. Because of the complexity of the casting process, few banks were successfully produced unflawed, and this was reflected in its high price to consumers (approximately four times that of other mechanical banks produced and sold in those years).\n\nAs to the colors which the bank was painted, variations were limited to the girl's dress. On some, the colors are combinations of red, blue, white and beige; others are found painted in pale yellow, cream, white and light blue, while still others dress the little girl in pastel green, cream, white and pale yellow. Her cap may be either red or light blue, with both variations sporting a gold star design. Her tights are always beige-colored, and the high button shoes are light brown and black. The girl's delicate face and hands are always a natural pink flesh color and her hair is blond.\n\nAt the end of the cap there appears an eyelet. Originally, this supported a multi-colored thread tassel. The example of this bank pictured in Figure I shows a tiny antique bell attached to the eyelet. This was apparently a replacement for the tassel by the original owner. Because of the historical charm which I feel it lends to the bank. I chose to leave the bell intact.\n\nThe cage for the fly wheel, which is to the left side of the girl, is red and yellow with blue trim, while the major housing has sides that are red and green. A gray squirrel huddles just under the winder key. The base of the bank is green with gold trim and the support bar that holds the girl is blue.\n\nLast, but by no means least, the braided jump rope is gold. It is interesting to note that the rope was made from iron in some examples of the bank and of brass in others. Cast iron is brittle and resulted in numerous breakages. Thus, in order to alleviate the problem, the less fragile metal, brass, was incorporated into its design.\n\nThe Girl Skipping Rope came with a detachable nickel plated crank-like winding key. To find a bank with the original key is a rare feat in itself.\n\nThis particular mechanical bank, to my knowledge, has never been reproduced. However, if some unscrupulous person should take it upon himself to bless us with several of his private castings. I have included a base diagram identifying the bank's size and proportions (Figure 3). Unless cast from an original pattern, the dimensions of the Girl Skipping Rope will be approximately 1/8 inch smaller than the original bank. This is due to the shrinkage of the molten cast iron after it cools.\n\nThe value of a good, all-original Girl Skipping Rope bank has increased over 300% in the past few years  quite an investment when one considers today's economy.\n\nIn conclusion, I caution purchasers of any antique mechanical banks to be wary of reproductions and recasts, as they persistently haunt many unsuspecting dealers and collectors.\n\nThe Acrobats Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  January, 1983\n\nThe Acrobats Bank, in my opinion, is unrivaled in capturing the excitement, thrills, and wonderment of the Big Top. Examples of other mechanical banks which represent circus gymnastic performers and balancing acts are the Clown on Globe, Boy on Trapeze, and the Tin on Bar. But these only portray solitary Figures and do not even approach the precision of movement and action of the Acrobats bank.\n\nIn order to operate the bank, first place a coin in the slot to the right of the clown figure standing on the raised platform. Then press the lever behind the acrobat's heels, and this agile gymnast will execute a perfect hand stand on the bar above his head. Simultaneously, the tips of his toes will sharply kick a spur on the clown's chest, provoking a somersault that causes the clown's head to strike a lever which is responsible for the deposition of the coin. Quite a complex action!\n\nThe Acrobats bank was patented on April 3, 1883, by Edward L. Morris of Boston, Massachusetts, and assigned U.S. Patent Number 275,068. It was interesting to note that the patent designates the coin slot be located between the clown's legs. However, the bank was manufactured with the coin slot on the outside, adjacent to his right leg (fig. 1).\n\nThe Acrobats bank is fastened together entirely with rivets and riveted tabs; no screws are used. Thus, it is quite easy to tell whether any repairs have been made or a part has been replaced. One part, in particular, which usually shows up broken, is the hands of the gymnast. It is an extremely delicate casting and, because of the bank's strong spring, usually fails when placed tinder great stress and shock.\n\nThe Acrobats was produced in two color schemes. However, variations in color are limited to parts of the bank other than the figures themselves. On all banks, the clown has pink skin, black eyes and eyebrows, and red mouth. His shirt is blue with a yellow collar. He sports red knickers, white stockings and shiny black shoes. Perched upon his head is a bright red and orange hat. The acrobat wears a white leotard top and tights, and these are outlined in dark blue. His trunks and boots are red and he has a wide, black belt. His face and hands are pink, while his hair, eyebrows, eyes and suave, handlebar moustache are black. The color variations are: one type has a dark blue base, tan support posts and a blue top with yellow stripes. The raised platform is red with a tan sawtooth design at the lower half.\n\nThe banks also vary mechanically. Some have a small raised stop just behind the left heel of the clown. The purpose was to prevent the heel of the figure from accidentally hitting the lever and depositing the coin prematurely.\n\nThe Acrobats bank has been reproduced and, because of this fact, I have included a base diagram indicating its exact size (fig. 2). A reproduction will measure approximately 1/8 inch smaller along the base than the original bank. This is due to the shrinkage of the molten iron after it cools.\n\nThe Acrobats is extremely difficult to locate in all-original, unbroken condition, and is to be considered quite rare when found with superb paint.\n\nIn conclusion, I once again caution purchasers of antique mechanical banks to be wary of reproductions. Knowledge and awareness of their existence are probably the collectors greatest assets in avoiding frustrating and costly purchasing errors.\n\nThe Zig Zag Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  February, 1983\n\nCountless collectors have spent numerous hours speculating about it: few have actually known about it; five have seen it: only one owns it. And now  presented to the mechanical bank collecting public  we have the legendary Zig Zag mechanical bank.\n\nHere we see a bank of such fragile construction and delicacy of casting that it is truly a wonder one, has survived the ravages of time, let alone children. To my knowledge, this is the only example of the Zig Zag in existence.\n\nThe bank is operated by placing a coin in a slot atop of St. Nicholas' hat (Fig 1). The coin then rolls, by its own volition, first to the left, and then to the right, down a zig zag track behind the decorative front plate. This action takes place in full view of the depositor. As soon as the coin drops past the last zig, or zag, as the case may be, it hits a lever which releases a lid, and up pops a Jack in the box (Fig 2). Quite a pleasant reward from Father Christmas to little children who exhibit the admirable quality of thrift.\n\nThe Zig Zag bank was patented October 22, 1889, by Moses Newman and George Henry Bennett of New York, and assigned Patent Number 413,204. An interesting note about the patent papers (Fig. 3) is that the face of St. Nicholas does not appear to be a part of the original design. It was, perhaps, an afterthought of the manufacturer  a seasonal improvement to possibly enhance sales as an item for Christmas.\n\nThe colors of the Zig Zag bank are as follows: St Nicholas, as the classic jolly Christmas spirit of the 1800s, sports a gray cap with a blue brim and a red tassel. His face is a pink flesh color with red cheeks and a rosy, bulbous nose. His hair, eyebrows, moustache and heard are white. The internal zig zag track and stars, that can be seen through the front plate, are white, orange and light blue.\n\nThe front plate and the container that houses the Jack in the box, as well as the back and bottom of the bank, are all painted a glossy, royal blue enamel. The words \"Zig Zag Bank\" are stenciled in gold letters on the front of the box. The words \"Pat'd Oct, 22nd 1889\" appear, in raised gold letters, on the cast iron front of the bank just above the lid of the box. Jack has a cloth cap and body with red, blue, yellow and white floral designs. His face is gesso-covered, finely molded papier-mâché and is painted white with black eyes, rosy red cheeks, red lips, and white teeth outlined in red. There is a jingle bell inside Jack's body so that, whenever he is activated, his jump is joined with the sounds of jingling. This, coupled with the face of St. Nicholas, adds much to the magic and ambiance of Christmas.\n\nThe entire bank is fastened together with bent pins and a type of flat head rivet. These unique details, coupled with the Zig Zag's finely detailed casting and glossy, blue enamel paint, lead me to believe that the bank might have been manufactured by the Keyser and Rex Company of Philadelphia.\n\nThe dimensions of the bank are 12-1/4 inches high by 4 inches wide.\n\nThe Zig Zag bank now resides in the fine collection of the prominent mechanical bank collector, Mr. Al Davidson of Long Island. I am most pleased to have been instrumental in its acquisition, which came about two weeks prior to this Christmas of 1982.\n\nYes, Al, there really is a Santa Claus!\n\nThe Two Frogs Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  March, 1983\n\nFrogs, and toads, have been the subjects of many mechanical banks and are, therefore, no strangers to the world of the mechanical bank collector. Among the many fine representations of this subject matter are \"Professor Pug Frog's Great Bicycle Feat,\" \"Chief Big Moon, \"Frog on Rock,\" \"Toad on Stump,\" \"Frog on Round Base,\" \"Snake and Frog in Pond,\" \"Frog on Arched Track, \" \"Goat, Frog and Old Man,\" and \"Initiating First Degree.\"\n\nThe topic for this month's article will be the \"Two Frogs\" bank, which, in my opinion, is not just one of a family of mechanical banks, but the most artistic and unique of the group. This mechanical not only displays more than one frog but also possesses an almost bronze-like, nature study quality in both design and decoration.\n\nUnfortunately, the feeding habits of frogs are not accurately depicted, as evidenced by the operation of the bank. Place a coin on the front legs of the small frog, and press the lever behind the large frog: the baby frogs flipper then kicks the coin into \"mama's\" gaping mouth. Because of a poorly designed casting, this flipper has not fared too well under constant and harsh usage, and has become the bank's \"weak spot.\" Most often, the \"Two Frogs\" bank is found sans flipper or with one that has been repaired.\n\nJames H. Bowen was the inventor of the bank, and was granted Patent Number 262,361 on August 8. 1882 (Fig. 1). In researching the history of the \"Two Frogs\", I discovered two interesting facts regarding the aforementioned patent papers. The first is that the specific patent number represents and protects four totally different mechanical banks designed by James Bowen, three of which are completely unrelated to the subject of frogs. Those three are \"Reclining Chinaman,\" \"Paddy and the Pig\", and \"Elephant and Three Clowns.\"\n\nThe second fact is that the drawings show an internal gear-activated device that, as Bowen stated, \"is supposed to produce sounds or tones in imitation of the croaking of frogs.\" Unfortunately, this device was never actually incorporated into the mechanism, although it certainly would have been a most charming addition to this fine bank.\n\nThe \"Two Frogs\" has a design variation which pertains to a coin baffle in the large frog's throat. The purpose of the baffle was to prevent deposited coins from being shaken out of the bank through the mouth. Some banks incorporate this baffle device while others do not.\n\nThe \"Two Frogs\" paint scheme is extremely attractive and quite realistic. The large frog is a light yellow-green, overpainted with a transparent brown japanned glaze. She has a red mouth and brown glass eyes with black pupils. The baby frog is dark green with a red mouth and black glass eyes rimmed in yellow. Both mom and baby have a lemon-yellow underbelly, and both recline on a light colored aqua blue base with dark aqua blue pond grass designs.\n\nThe base plate is embossed with the words, \"Eng Pat July 28. 1882, U.S. Pat Aug. 8. 1882\", and is made to accept the round Stephens type of coin trap.\n\nIn view of the fact that the \"Two Frogs\" bank has been reproduced, I am including a base diagram (Fig. 2) indicating the size of an original bank. A reproduction will measure approximately one-eighth of an inch smaller along the base than the original.\n\nThe \"Two Frogs\" is extremely difficult to acquire in all-original, unbroken condition because of the aforementioned fragile flipper. Thus, a word of caution: be wary of \"Two Frogs\" banks bearing false flippers.\n\nThe Reclining Chinaman Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  April, 1983\n\nHistorically, minority groups in this country have borne the brunt of hostility and ridicule. During the mid-to-late-1800s, the United States underwent a dramatic growth change due to immigration. A new racial element entered the American scene with the arrival of persons of Oriental background. Their presence posed serious problems for 19th century America. Although economic factors were important considerations, the major problems were difficulty in assimilation and the attitudes which prevail towards minorities. This article will deal with a creation of those times, the \"Reclining Chinaman\", a mechanical bank which is representative of the prejudice and stereotyping that was directed specifically against the Chinese people.\n\nThe bank portrays the Chinese as having a \"sardonic\" smile, a penchant for gambling, shrewdness in money matters, using logs instead of chairs or beds, and living with, and using rodents for sustenance. Unlike banks such as the\" Girl Skipping Rope\" which offers esthetic value in its grace and beauty, the\" Reclining Chinaman's\" value lies in its historical and anti-racial theme.\n\nThe smiling\" Chinaman\" holds his concealed poker cards in his right hand, while left hand is extended. His gestures tempt one to see his bet in order to be shown the cards. A penny is placed in the pocket of his tunic, and the lever at the far end of the log is pressed. At that moment his left hand moves towards his mouth as if to cover a victorious snicker. The \"Chinaman\" then displays his hand of four aces. Simultaneously, the money is deposited into the bank. At this point, I must offer a word of caution. The arms and hands are the \"weak spots\" due to their delicate casting, sharp action and precarious position. When a \"Reclining Chinaman\" bank is found, the chances are great that either one or both of the arms and/or hands will be broken.\n\nThe \"Reclining Chinaman\" bank was invented by James H. Bowen of Philadelphia and was granted Patent number 262,361 on August 8, 1882. While researching this particular patent, an interesting fact emerged. The same patent papers that protect the \"Reclining Chinaman\" also apply to the \"Two Frogs\", \"Paddy and the Pig\", and the \"Elephant and Three Clowns\" mechanical banks. However, the patent papers make no reference to any figure other than the \"Two Frogs\" shown in its drawings (Fig. 1).\n\nThe \"Reclining Chinaman\" was produced with two color variations but these pertain mainly to the clothing of the \"Chinaman\" and the drape upon which he leans. All other parts of the bank are painted in a standardized color scheme. The base and log area reddish brown; the two ends of the log are pale orange. The rodent under the subject's leg is gray with black eyes. The \"Chinaman's\" face, hands and arms are a natural pink flesh color. He has black hair, queue and eyebrows. His eyes are painted white with black pupils, and his lips are red. The cards in his right hand have reddish brown backs, while the other side has a white ground with a red heart painted on one card, a black club on the second, a black spade on the third, and a red diamond on the fourth card.\n\nThe color variations previously mentioned are as follows: on some banks the drape which the \"Chinaman\" rests upon is dark purple with a yellow fringe; on others, it's painted light blue with a yellow fringe. On the banks with the purple drape, the \"Chinaman's\" tunic is dark blue with yellow piping, collar and buttons. He has pale yellow pants, white socks and black shoes with white soles. On the banks which have the light blue drape, the \"Chinaman\" dons a dark purple tunic with yellow piping, collar and buttons. He wears light blue pants, white socks and black shoes with white soles.\n\nThe base of the bank accepts the round Stephens coin trap, indicating it was manufactured by the Stephens Foundry of Cromwell, Connecticut. The words \"ENG. PAT. JULY 1882. U.S. PAT. AUG 8, 1882\" are embossed into the base plate.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the\" Reclining Chinaman\" bank has never been reproduced commercially. Nevertheless, I am including a base diagram (Fig. 2) to better acquaint you with its size and scale.\n\nOn a final note  the \"Reclining Chinaman\" is a bank of extraordinarily fine casting and design. Combined with its odd subject matter and historical significance it has not only become one of my favorites, but one which most serious mechanical bank collectors take great pride in owning.\n\nThe Elephant and Three Clowns\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  May, 1983\n\nThe Elephant and Three Clowns is a tiny gem of a bank encompassing all of the charm and excitement of the circus. Although it is one of the smallest of the mechanicals, its size does not detract from its desirability.\n\nThe bank is one of a large family, portraying that most amusing and entertaining denizen of the Big Top: the beloved clown. Other mechanicals in this group are: Acrobats; Bill-E-Grin; Circus; Clown and Dog; Clown Bust; Clown on Bar; Clown on Globe; Hoopla; Humpty Dumpty; Jolly Joe; Clown and Harlequin; Professor Pug Frog; Punch and Judy; Trick Dog; and the Zig-Zag Bank.\n\nThe Elephant and Three Clowns was patented on July 28, 1882, by James H. Bowen of Philadelphia PA, and was assigned U.S. Pat. 262,361. It was manufactured by the Stephens Foundry of Cromwell, Connecticut. Of interest is the fact that the same patent papers that protect the Two Frogs Bank, the reclining Chinaman, and Paddy and the Pig, also protect the Elephant and Three Clowns. And, further, these patent papers illustrate only the Two Frogs Bank and its internal mechanism (see Fig. 1). It is these patented levers, pivots, and springs which are responsible for the fascinating actions of both the Two Frogs Bank and the Elephant and Three Clowns.\n\nThe operation of the Elephant and Three Clowns is most interesting and worthy of special mention. First, a coin is placed between the two gold rings under the elephant's head, and then the legs of the clown who is balancing the ball are pulled back. The top clown pivots at the waist; simultaneously, the elephant's trunk sways to the right, depositing the coin into the bank.\n\nThe Elephant and Three Clowns bank is extremely delicate and quite intricate in design. It is for these reasons that, when one does show up, many times parts are either broken or missing. One cannot truly appreciate the full charm or beauty of this bank until it is seen with most, or all, of its original paint. Thus, when one is found in perfect condition with superb paint, it commands a premium price.\n\nThe Elephant and Three Clowns does not have any design variations that I am aware of, but it was decorated in several COLOR variations. These variations pertain only to the tub on which the elephant stands and the blanket; the remainder of the bank, including its figures, remain constant in its color scheme.\n\nThe elephant is gray; he has a red mouth, white tusks, white eyes with black pupils and the tip of his trunk is red. The clown riding on his back has a red, yellow, and blue cap, red shorts a red shirt which displays a blue star, and he sports black shoes. His face is pink with brown decorative markings and he has black eyes with a red mouth.\n\nThe figure holding the gold rings has a blue tunic with a red sash. He has black hair, eyes, and moustache. The figure balancing the gold ball also has a blue tunic with a red belt; his eyes and hair are black and he has a red mouth.\n\nThe tub was painted either in tan with gold trim and a red top, or, blue with gold trim and a red top. The elephant's blanket is painted either red, or blue, with yellow fringe.\n\nThe base plate is embossed with the words: \"U.S. Pat, Aug. 8,1882, Eng. Pat July 28, 1882\", and is made to accept the round Stephens' type coin trap.\n\nI have not seen or heard of any reproductions of the Elephant and Three Clowns bank; nevertheless, since the possibility may exist I am including a base diagram (Fig. 2).\n\nJust a final word about paint variations: sometimes a bank that is authentic and all original will show up deviating from its traditional color scheme. This might reflect either the foundry artist's mood, expressions of individuality, or a special presentations bank (i.e., specific banks designed and hand-painted by the great mechanical bank designer, Charles A. Bailey). One can distinguish authentic old paint either by age crazing, patina, or general appearance. If there is any doubt as to paint or authenticity, an authority should be consulted before making a costly error.\n\nThe Peg Leg Beggar Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  June, 1983\n\nWhen it was advertised in the Summer edition of Ehrichs Fashion Quarterly of 1880, it sold for only fifty cents apiece, and was called \"The Beggar Bank.\" Today, mechanical bank collectors refer to it as the \"Peg Leg Beggar,\" and a fine specimen may sell for more than twenty-five hundred times the original price.\n\nThe Peg Leg Beggar is one of those banks which, due to its simple casting and vague background has made it susceptible to an over-abundance of unauthorized reproductions.\n\nSome forty-odd years ago, two brothers who were living in the Philadelphia, PA, area took it upon themselves to honor the collecting community with several recasts of the Peg Leg Beggar bank and its related counterpart, the Circus Ticket Collector bank (subject of a subsequent article). These reproductive castings were not of exceptional quality, by most standards; however, many a defrauded collector will testify to the fact that, for the past forty years, these banks did, and still do, elude detection. I do caution the collector to be wary when purchasing either of these banks. An understanding of the casting process and a feeling for paint quality are mandatory in discerning the originals from the recasts.\n\nA few things to look for when determining the Peg Leg Beggar's authenticity include: 1. the smooth quality of the cast iron, both inside and out; 2. how well the two sections of the castings fit (there should be no wide gaps between halves); 3. the front coat buttons should be well-defined (Fig. 1) (in the reproductions, these buttons are practically non-existent); 4. the head should be a two-piece casting, not solid; and 5. the paint should have a smooth patina.\n\nThe original Peg Leg Beggar bank was painted in two color variations. The face and hands maybe either black or a pale pink color. Both variations have white eyes with black pupils, black hair, and a red mouth.\n\nThe bodies also may be painted differently. One is painted an overall copper color with a white shirt and red V-shaped tie. His hat, shoe, peg leg, and buttons are black. The other color variation shows the body to be an overall brown, japanning-type finish with a white shirt and red V-shaped tie. His hat shoe, peg leg, and buttons are also black.\n\nThe bank is operated by placing a coin into the slot in the hat. This tips a balance lever connected to the Beggar's head, which then nods in acknowledgement of your generous gift.\n\nFor many years any background information in regard to the manufacturer of the Peg Leg Beggar had been sadly lacking. Then, several years ago, correspondence surfaced that exposed a legal confrontation between the Judd Manufacturing Company of Wallingford, Connecticut, and the Stephens Foundry of Cromwell, Connecticut The Stephens Company contended that the Peg Leg Beggar bank infringed upon their patent of the Tammany Bank (Fig. 2). The Judd Manufacturing Company acquiesced and ceased production of both their Beggar bank and the Circus Ticket Collector bank (the factor contributing to their rarity today).\n\nFor some unknown reason, the Judd Manufacturing Company never patented any of their banks, and. if it had not been for the above-mentioned correspondence, the manufacturer of both the Beggar bank and the Circus Ticket Collector might still be unknown.\n\nOther banks manufactured by the Judd Company are: Circus Ticket Collector, Boy and Bulldog: Bucking Mule; Butting Goat; Bulldog; Standing; Bear with Paws Around Tree Stump; Dog on Turntable; Snap-It; Gem; Mosque; and the very rare Giant bank.\n\nBecause of their simplicity, many of the Judd banks have fallen easy prey to recasting. And, as stated previously, one must exercise caution in the purchase of these mechanical banks.\n\nI have included a base diagram (Fig. 3) to facilitate recognition of an original Peg Leg Beggar. The recast version is approximately one-sixteenth of an inch smaller, length and width.\n\nIn conclusion, the odd subject matter of this bank, as well as its enigmatic background, contribute to the Peg Leg Beggar's charisma.\n\nThe Circus Ticket Collector Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  July, 1983\n\nFor the first sixty years of its existence, the Circus Ticket Collector bank was referred to as the \"Money Barrel Bank.\" It was advertised as such in the 1870's edition of Ehrichs Fashion Quarterly (a New York City-based mail order firm). However, the name \"Money Barrel Bank\" became obsolete; why and when this happened still remains a mystery. The first recorded usage of the name \"Circus Ticket Collector\" appeared in Ina Hayward Bellows' book, Old Mechanical Banks published in 1940.\n\nBoth Ina Bellows, and twelve years later, in 1952, pioneer collector John D. Meyers, in his book Mechanical Penny Banks, make reference to a variation specifically pertaining to the face of the Circus Ticket Collector. The variation was that the man was bearded. Other than these references, I have never seen nor heard of a bearded variety. (If readers of this article have seen a bank so described. I would appreciate your advising me of it.) My contention is that quite possibly the white paint flaking off the cheeks, chin, and upper lip of the face exposed the black underpaint, thus giving the illusion of the beard.\n\nThe fragility of the facial paint was due to the fact that, instead of a primer, a hard glossy black paint was used as an undercoat, causing an adhesion problem with the white paint that was applied over it This problem resulted in extensive flaking of the face (Fig. 1). There are other mechanical banks which share in the same faulty use of glossy black underpaint. They are: \"Hold the Fort,\" (Eight Sided Building), and \"John Bull's Moneybox,\" (of English manufacture). These banks, including the Circus Ticket Collector, are extremely difficult to locate in fine paint condition, and, if found, do command a premium price.\n\nThe Circus Ticket Collector was produced in two color variations that applied only to the body of the man and his money barrel. His face is consistent in its color scheme, in that the hair, eyebrows, and eyes are black; the face is an off-white, and the mouth is red (all painted over the glossy black undercoat).\n\nThe color variations are: on one, the man's body and the barrel are painted a copper-bronze color. He sports a white shirt with a red V-shaped necktie. His coat buttons and shoes, as well as the barrel hoops, are black. The second variation has the man's body and the barrel painted with a brown japanning. He wears a yellow-ochre shirt with a white collar. His coat buttons and shoes are black. The barrel hoops on this variation are red.\n\nThe bank is operated by placing a coin into the slot atop the barrel. This tips a balance lever connected to the Ticket Collector's head, which then nods in acknowledgement of your contribution.\n\nFor many years, background information regarding the manufacture of the Circus Ticket Collector had been sadly lacking. Then, several years ago, correspondence surfaced that exposed a legal confrontation between the Judd Manufacturing Company of Wallingford, Connecticut, and the Stevens Foundry of Cromwell, Connecticut. The Stevens Foundry contended that the Peg Leg Beggar Bank along with the Money Barrel Bank, infringed upon the patent of their Tammany Bank (Fig. 2). The Judd Company acquiesced and ceased production of both their Beggar Bank and the Money Barrel Bank (the factor contributing to their rarity today).\n\nUnfortunately, the Circus Ticket Collectors simple design led to the creation of numerous unauthorized reproductions, This fact is all the more understandable when considering that the bank originally sold for fifty cents apiece, and today, a fine, original specimen may be purchased for a price that reflects over a three thousand percent increase.\n\nAs I have cautioned in previous articles, one should be wary when purchasing any mechanical bank. A thorough understanding of the iron casting process, and a sensitive feeling for paint quality and patina are mandatory in discerning an original from a recast.\n\nA few things to look for when determining the authenticity of an original Circus Ticket Collector Bank include: (1) the smooth quality of the cast iron, both inside and out: (2) how well the two sections of the castings fit (there should be no wide gaps between halves); (3) the front coat buttons must be well-defined (Fig. 3); (4) the man's head should be a two-piece casting; and (5) the paint should have a smooth patina.\n\nBecause of the numerous recasts in circulation today, I am including a base diagram (Fig. 4) to facilitate identification of an original Circus Ticket Collector. A recast will be approximately one-sixteenth of an inch smaller in length than the original.\n\nI must conclude with the paradoxical statement that the Circus Ticket Collectors charisma lies in its lack of historical significance, lack of intriguing subject matter, lack of color, its small size, and finally, its unimposing presence.\n\nLittle Jocko Musical Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  August, 1983\n\nThe colorful figure of the organ grinder accompanied by his monkey was commonplace on the streets of New York City during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Providing entertainment to the people was his objective  and so he did  particularly to the youngsters. His lilting ethnic melodies, so reminiscent of his native land, beckoned to the children to gather pennies from their mothers to feed the tiny paw of Jocko, the organ grinder's greedy monkey.\n\nThe popularity of this comical duo became, not by mere coincidence alone, the subject matter of many a toy savings bank. During the 1880's, the Ives, Blakeslee and Williams Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut, produced various organ banks. Some portrayed monkeys; others, cats and dogs; and still others, children.\n\nIn 1882, the Kyser and Rex Company of Frankford, Pennsylvania, also manufactured an organ bank, but this one featured an organ grinder and dancing bear.\n\nIn the early 1900's, the Hubley Mfg. Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, produced still another organ grinder and monkey bank.\n\nAnd then some time around the year 1912, the Strauss Company of New York City produced the \"Little Jocko Musical Bank\" a mechanical bank that is regarded by many collectors to be the most desirable organ bank ever manufactured (and the subject of this article).\n\nThis bank and the \"Thrifty Tom\" were the only two mechanical banks known to be produced by the Strauss Mfg. Company. Unfortunately, to this date, no patent papers have been located for the Little Jocko, thus depriving the collector of valuable background information regarding this fine mechanical.\n\nThe Strauss Company not only manufactured mechanical and tin registering banks, but many sheet metal toys of the period, as well as various other metal products.\n\nMuch of the charm of the Jocko Musical lies not only in its subject matter, colorful appearance, and fascinating action, but also in the primitive plink plank, plunk of its musical mechanism.\n\nPrinted on each side of the bank is the ditty:\n\n\"Drop a penny in the cup\n\nThen turn the crank around\n\nYou will see the monkey dance\n\nAnd hear the music sound.\"\n\nwhich fully describes the Little Jocko's action.\n\nFirst a coin is inserted into the coin slot within the monkey's cup (Fig. 1). The crank is then turned, causing the monkey to rotate clockwise, as a nondescript plink plank, plunk tune emanates from within the bank Only one tune is played for a single coin. Otherwise, the crank rotates freely, causing no further action or music to take place.\n\nThe Little Jocko is considered quite a rare bank and, upon close examination, one will gain insight into just why this is so. The crank is extremely delicate and prone to breakage, as is the small tin cup atop the bank The little monkey, made from soft lead, is removable and easily lost or dropped and broken.\n\nAlso, a key is required to open the bank for removal of its coins. If the key was lost, one can just imagine a child feverishly applying a screwdriver or sharp object trying to break open the lock in order to gain access to the pennies stored within.\n\nLastly, Jocko's one-dollar price tag (Fig. 2), quite high for those years, might have proven quite prohibitive and may have limited sales to a fortunate few. All of these factors contribute to the bank's scarcity today.\n\nThe colors and design of the Little Jocko are most attractive. The organ is red-orange. The name, \"Little Jocko Musical Bank,\" is gold, as is the frame around the scene of Venice on the front of the bank. The two harp designs and the scrollwork decorations on the front, top, sides, and back of the bank are also gold.\n\nThe scene of Venice is executed in delicate pastel shades of white, blue, pink and brown. The tin cup is gold with a white stripe circumscribing its base.\n\nThe monkey's face, hands, feet and tail are cocoa brown. His cap and pants are painted bright transparent blue, and he sports a bright transparent red shirt.\n\nI am not alone in my feelings that much of the charm of this bank lies in the graphics depicted on its backside (Fig. 3). Here we see a caricature of a pipe organ, with the pipes depicting comical human faces. Their colors are bright yellow with red tones. All of the facial features are drawn in dark blue. The entire organ is outlined in gold.\n\nBecause of the Jocko Musical's complicated mechanism and the fact that it is manufactured largely from lithographed tin, the chances of its being reproduced are extremely remote. But that does not preclude the possibility of a recast lead monkey or a recreated tin cup or crank. Therefore, these parts should be closely scrutinized before contemplating purchase of this bank. Fig. 4 is a base diagram to better help you determine the bank's size and scale.\n\nIn conclusion, the rarity of the \"Little Jocko Musical Bank\" not only lies in the scarcity of its examples, but in the fact that most of those that do exist have either replaced monkeys, cups, or inoperable musical mechanisms. And, finding a fine one, complete and in perfect working condition, offers a monumental challenge to the collector. CORRECTION: (from October, 1984) In the August, 1983 issue of Antique Toy World, the \"Little Jocko Musical Bank\" article erroneously stated that: \"the Ives Blakeslee and Williams Company manufactured the Organ Bank with Monkey, Cat and Dog and the Organ Bank with Monkey, Boy and Girl.\"\n\nThe manufacturer should have correctly been listed as the Kyser and Rex Company of Frankford, Pennsylvania. My sincerest apologies to both Louis and Alfred C.\n\nThe Chimpanzee Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  September, 1983\n\nMonkeys have been the subject of many a mechanical bank. However, only one mechanical represents a member of the family of Great Apes that bank being the \"Chimpanzee\" (Other members of this family, but never depicted in a mechanical bank, include the Gorilla and the Orangutan, with the Gibbon sometimes included in the group.)\n\nOn September 21, 1880, Louis Kyser and Alfred C. Rex of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were granted Patent Number 232,511 for their design of the Chimpanzee Bank. As evident by the patent drawings (Fig. 1), the bank, as it was eventually manufactured, follows those drawings quite faithfully. Of importance and interest is the fact that not only did Kyser and Rex design and patent the Chimpanzee bank, but they also manufactured it.\n\nThe action of this mechanical is both amusing and quite realistic. The Chimpanzee, representing an accountant with his ledger, sits behind a desk pen poised and ready to enter the deposited coin into his record book. In order to make a deposit, the slide in front of the ledger is pushed back exposing the coin slot, thus allowing a coin to be placed into the bank. Simultaneously, the Chimpanzees head tilts forward, his left arm lowers, and the pen touches the ledger as if to record the deposit; a bell chimes once from within the bank.\n\nThe deposited coins are removed by way of a small square locking coin trap underneath the bank.\n\nClose examination of the Chimpanzee bank will reveal that great care and attention has been given to fine detail. This was the case with most banks manufactured by Kyser and Rex. Examples of other mechanical banks manufactured by these gentlemen are: Bowling Alley, Butting Buffalo, Confectionery, Dog Tray, Hindu. Lion and Two Monkeys, Mammy and Baby, Mikado, Motor Bank, Organ and Monkey, Organ and Monkey with Boy and Girl, Organ and Monkey with Cat and Dog, Organ Grinder and Dancing Bear, Tiny Organ and Monkey, Uncle Tom, and possibly, the Zig Zag Bank (see A. T. W., January, 1983).\n\nThe Chimpanzee is not considered a rare bank; however, it is quite difficult to acquire one that is complete and in fine condition. When a Chimpanzee bank is found, it is very likely that either the roof will be cracked, the finial missing, the head and/or the arm of the Chimpanzee broken or missing, the base plate missing, and, most often, the paint will be in extremely poor condition. Find one complete, working, and in fine paint condition, and you have a true rarity . . . a mechanical well worth the premium price you most likely will have to pay for it.\n\nAn interesting fact pertaining to the construction of this bank is that no screws were used as fasteners. The entire bank is secured with either rivets or bent-over iron lugs.\n\nThe Chimpanzee bank does come painted in several color variations. The colors of the bank pictured in this article are: a red building, light green finial, base, window frames and archway over the chimpanzee. The chimpanzee's head and paws are brown; his mouth is red; his jacket is red with yellow piping; his eyes, shirt and ledger book are white. The edges of the ledger book, as well as the word \"Chimpanzee,\" the tin window inserts, and various other decorations are finished in gold. The desk is bright blue and the inside of his cupola is lilac.\n\nOther paint variations of this bank reverse the red and green color combinations, and the Chimpanzee's jacket may be either red, green, blue, or yellow. Also, still another basic color variation of this bank utilizes predominantly red and blue, rather than red and green.\n\nBecause of Kyser and Rex's penchant for unusual color schemes, I would caution against the hasty declaration that a Chimpanzee bank may be a misrepresentation if it fails to conform to any of the aforementioned color schemes. The possibility of still another color combination cannot be ruled out. As I have emphasized in other articles, if you are uncertain as to the authenticity of a bank, an expert in this field should be consulted.\n\nThe Chimpanzee bank has been reproduced, and, therefore, I am including a base diagram showing its exact dimensions. A reproduced bank will be approximately one-eighth inch smaller than indicated (Fig. 2).\n\nThe Chimpanzee has several design variations of which I am aware, but these do not add or detract from its value. Two relate to the tin inserts behind the lower arched windows: in one, the tin covers the windows fully, and in the other, the tin provides only partial concealment, with the arches exposed. Also, in one variation, the Chimpanzee's shoulders are quite wide and give the appearance of a triangular shape, while the other portrays the Chimpanzee with narrow shoulders.\n\nIn closing, I feel the \"Chimpanzee\" is an extremely well-designed bank and makes an attractive addition to the Monkey and Great Ape group. Also, the collector who possesses a fine example of one should consider himself quite fortunate.\n\nThe Billy Goat Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  October, 1983\n\nThis article will be devoted to a mechanical bank which is considered to be quite rare, although underrated and undervalued. The \"Billy Goat\" bank is small in size, monochromatic, and lacks exciting action - factors which have contributed to its underestimation. However, I am of the opinion that this tiny bank is one to be appreciated, and especially for its simplicity and graceful design.\n\nThe Billy Goat's simple, graceful proportions and delicate floral designs pay tribute to the most prestigious of all mechanical bank designers - Charles A. Bailey. This innovative gentleman, who, as assignor to Charles B. Frisbie (both of Cromwell, Connecticut), patented the Billy Goat bank on July 26. 1910. tinder U.S. Patent number 965,842.\n\nAs evidence by the patent papers, the Billy Goat bank appears to have faithfully followed the patent drawing (Fig. 1). The bank was manufactured by the J. and E. Stephens Foundry of Cromwell. Connecticut.\n\nCharles A. Bailey started his practice as a portrait bust designer and sculptor during the late 19th century. He them embarked upon pattern and toy design. His first patented mechanical bank was the\" Baby Elephant Opens at X O'Clock,\" which was produced in a lead alloy material. This was one of Bailey's favorite media since it allowed for the casting of minute and delicate detail into his toys and mechanical banks. Several of his earlier banks were executed in this same lead alloy. However, the material proved too fragile for mass production, and subsequently, all of his later banks were manufactured out of the more durable metal - cast iron.\n\nCharles A. Bailey produced over thirty mechanical banks during his lifetime, thus giving him the unique distinction of being the most prolific mechanical bank designer of all time.\n\nBesides the Billy Goat, some of the other mechanical banks which incorporate the Bailey trademark of gracefully executed floral designs include: The Darkey and Watermelon; Milking Cow: Lion Hunter; Boy Scout Camp; Perfection Registering; Bad Accident; Hen and Chick; Boy Robbing Bird's Nest; and Chute the 'Chute.\n\nThe operation of the Billy Goat bank is simple but effective. A coin is placed into the slot (Fig. 2) and the wire lever (Fig.3) is pulled toward the depositor. The goat then pivots up and over, striking the coin with his forehead, simultaneously depositing the coin into the bank The coins are removed by way of a round Stephens-type coin trap in the underside of the base.\n\nSimplicity also dominates the coloration of the Billy Goat bank: the base is painted silver with a raised red flower on each side. The goat is black with a large white marking on each of his sides: his eyes are white with black pupils.\n\nThere are two casting variations of which I am aware: neither of these add to nor detract from the bank's value. In one, the name \"BILLY GOAT BANK\" is incised into one of its sides. In the other variation, no incised name is in evidence.\n\nIn reference to the variation with the incised name, it is interesting to note that the letter \"N\" which appears in the word \"bank\" is reversed (Fig. 4), and one is reminded of the mistake a child is likely to make when first learning to print the alphabet. It has not been determined why this \"error\" had never been corrected at the foundry.\n\nAs previously stated, the Billy Goat bank is quite rare, and I can only venture a guess as to the reasons for this. Coupled with its small, lackluster appearance, and the decline of mechanical bank popularity that occurred during a period of economic instability, few were purchased. And, most probably, of those that were purchased, many may have been broken, owing to the bank's delicate casting, and ultimately discarded.\n\nThe scarcity in number and the rarity of the Billy Goat becomes evident when one discovers that many of the banks residing on collectors' shelves appear to be reproductions. The reasons for reproducing the Billy Goat are, as mentioned previously, the simplicity of casting and the great monetary value placed upon an original specimen. It is unfortunate that, several years ago, an unscrupulous individual reproduced a number of Billy Goat banks and sold them to unsuspecting collectors. These banks are still in circulation today.\n\nSome of the things one should be aware of in order to distinguish between an authentic Billy Goat and a recast are: the overall paint quality should be smooth and have that unmistakable aged patina. The entire bank should be underpainted with a creamy tan color that will show through under any worn spots, including the underside base plate. The quality of the iron should be very smooth, both inside and out: the designs, detail, and lettering should be sharp and clear.\n\nAll parts of the bank including the pull wire, are made of iron and these should respond to it magnet. And. finally, both halves of the bank are riveted together. No screws or other fasteners were used in the manufacture of the Billy Goat bank.\n\nI am including it base diagram to further help determine the size and authenticity of a Billy Goat bank (Fig. 5). The recast will appear approximately 1/16\" shorter from end to end.\n\nIn conclusion, it becomes apparent that one should be especially wary and exercise extreme caution when contemplating purchase of this particular bank.\n\nThe Confectionery Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  November, 1983\n\nThe subject of this month's article is quite a unique mechanical bank Not only does it have the distinction of being American-made, and constructed from cast iron, but, upon the deposition of a coin, vends an actual object  a small flat round confectionery: hence, the name \"Confectionery Bank\"\n\nOn June 14, 1981, Rudolph M. Hunter of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was granted Patent number 243,048 for his design and invention of the Confectionery bank (Figure A). The bank, as it was eventually manufactured by the Kyser and Rex Company of Philadelphia, follows those drawings quite faithfully.\n\nThe operation of this mechanical is not only interesting, but very rewarding to the depositor. A stack of small, flat round candies is inserted into a compartment at the back of the bank (see Figures 3 and 4 of the patent drawings). A coin is placed into the slot on the counter top. The plunger on the front of the bank is then pressed. Simultaneously, the girl holding the tray pivots left a small door marked \"LOZENGE\" opens, a bell rings, and the confectionery is deposited into her tray. The girl returns to her original position (Figure B) with her sweet reward.\n\nThe deposited coins are removed by way of a locking coin trap underneath the base of the bank.\n\nThe detail and coloration of the Confectionery bank are extremely attractive, as is the case with most mechanical banks manufactured by Kyser and Rex (i.e.. the Bowling Alley; Butting Buffalo; Lion and Monkeys: Mammy and Baby; Mikado; Organ Grinder and Dancing Bear; and others).\n\nI am not aware of any design variations in the Confectionery bank, but there are several color variations. One has the curved front panel painted in shades of dark and light green. trimmed in gold. The molding at the base and the counter top rim is red. The counter top itself is yellow with brown wood graining. The back panel is gray with gold lettering, and the top finial is red with the words, \"Confectionery Bank\" in gold. The little girl has a yellow dress with a red bow and red buttons. Her face is pink with blue eyes, a red mouth, brown eyebrows, and brown hair. The tray she is holding is painted gold.\n\nAnother color variation has the curved front panel painted red and blue with gold trim. The flat back section is yellow with red lettering. The little girl has a red dress with a yellow bow and buttons. Her face also is pink with a red mouth, blue eyes, brown eyebrows and brown hair. And her tray is also painted gold.\n\nThere have been several theories expressed as to what types of candies were originally intended for use in the Confectionery bank. One of the earliest speculations was that the goods were either gum or foil-wrapped chocolates. However, I feel certain that these would have proven too messy or sticky for usage in such an intricate mechanical bank Another suggestion was that perhaps candy wafers were utilized. Mr. Bill Norman, a most knowledgeable and advanced bank collector, did some research into this matter and uncovered some very interesting information. It is quite possible, according to Mr. Norman, that NECCO candy wafers were originally intended for use in the Confectionery bank. Not only do these small, flat, round candy wafers fit perfectly into the compartment in the back of the bank but they also fit the small round tray carried by the little girl.\n\n\"NECCO\" (New England Confectionery Company) was a candy manufacturer that operated during the same period of time that the Confectionery bank was produced. And both companies existed in the same general northeast part of the country. In addition, early (1880) literature bears out the fact that NECCO candies were referred to as \"LOZENGES,\" the very word which appears upon the Confectionery bank's small door that dispenses the candies into the little girl's tray.\n\nThe price of the Confectionery bank in the 1880's was a modest seventy-five cents apiece, or eight dollars fifty-five cents per dozen. Included in this article is a reprint of an advertisement that ran in the 1886 edition of the Montgomery Ward Catalog (Figure C).\n\nSome of the \"weak spots\" or fragile areas to be wary of when contemplating the purchase of the Confectionery bank are: the figure of the girl, the small door marked \"LOZENGE\" where the candies are ejected into the tray, and the tray are either missing or replaced. The locking coin trap in the base or the square door in the back of the bank that conceals the candies (see Figure 4 of the patent drawings) is missing. And, finally, the small flower on top of the finial might be broken off Quite possibly, these fragilities, as well as other factors, have led to the rarity of the Confectionery bank.\n\nIt is interesting to note that on the curved front section of this mechanical is a raised circle circumscribing the words \"PAT JUNE 1881.\" This date facilitated locating the patent papers shown in this article.\n\nI am not aware if any reproductions of the Confectionery bank exist Nevertheless, I am including a base diagram to show an original's configuration and scale (Figure D).\n\nTo conclude, the Confectionery is highly prized and a favorite amongst most collectors. This is easily understood especially when one has had the opportunity to view, hold, and perhaps operate this delightful mechanical.\n\nCorrection: (from September, 1985) In the article entitled \"The Confectionary Bank,\" which appeared in the November 1983 issue of Antique Toy World, it was erroneously stated: \"the Kyser and Rex Company of Philadelphia\"; it should have read; \"the Kyser and Rex Company of Frankford.\"\n\nThe Jolly Nigger Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  December, 1983\n\nThe year 1619 is infamous as the (date of the arrival of the first slave ships in Jamestown, Virginia. Accompanying the shame and degradation of human bondage was the introduction to American society of anti-black art literature, music, and various objects, including children's playthings.\n\nThe world of mechanical penny banks was not to be left unaffected by these hostile and irrational racist attitudes. Examples may be cited of banks which portray black persons hitting their heads, falling, having their teeth yanked, mouths slammed, eating, kicking, and stealing watermelons and chickens, as well as involvement in a plethora of other humiliating situations.\n\n Which leads us to the subject of this article: a mechanical penny bank with its humiliating stamp boldly emblazoned on its back  \"THE JOLLY NIGGER BANK\"\n\nOn March 14, 1882, both Charles G. Shepard and Peter Adams, Jr., of Buffalo, New York were granted Patent Number 255,090 for their invention of the Jolly Nigger bank. This bank was eventually manufactured by the Shepard Hardware Company of Buffalo, New York and later, when the Shepard Company ceased production, by the J. and E. Stevens Company of Cromwell. Connecticut. As evidenced by the patent drawings, the final production bank follows the patent papers faithfully (Figure 1).\n\nThe operation of the Jolly Nigger bank is quite simple. A coin is placed in the right hand; the lever in his back is pressed down. Simultaneously, his eyes roll up, his tongue recedes, and his right arm raises the coin, whereby it is flipped into his gaping mouth and deposited within the bank.\n\nThe bank which was produced by the Shepard Company allows for coin removal by unscrewing the entire base plate. In the Stevens variation, the coins are removed by opening the small round Stevens-type coin trap in the base. Both Shepard's and Stevens' castings of the head, arm, and body are identical. The only major casting differences are in the base plates.\n\nWith the exceptions of some color variations which will be discussed later in this article, both Shepard and Stevens painted their Jolly Nigger banks exactly the same colors: the man's face, hair, and hand are black; his lips, nostrils, jacket, tongue, and spaces between his teeth are red. He has a black tie and buttons. His eyes are white with brown irises outlined in black and the pupils are black. The base plate of the Shepard bank is japanned with a brown lacquer and has the words, \"MADE BY SHEPARD HARDWARE CO. BUFFALO N.Y. Pat'd in Canada Mar. 22, 1883.\" The Stevens' base plate is painted with a creamy whitewash and has the following words printed in raised lettering \"Manufactured by the J and E Stevens Co. Cromwell Conn. U.S.A.\"\n\nThe paint variations that show up occasionally, particularly in the Shepard Jolly Nigger, have, in some, the coat painted a bright ultra-marine blue, and in others, the face and hand painted in cocoa brown rather than black. Many collectors (myself included) feel both of these variations are extremely attractive.\n\nThe Jolly Nigger bank gained great popularity during the period of its manufacture This possibly was due in part to its reasonable price of sixty cents apiece (see Figure 2, Montgomery Ward and Co. ad. circa 1889), the bank's sturdy construction, and, perhaps, because of its racist subject matter. This mechanical's anti-black theme has transcended the boundaries of our own country, and Jolly Nigger-type banks have been manufactured in England, France, Germany, Spain, South America, the Near East, and Canada. Some other names they are known by are: Jolly Nigger High Hat, Little Hi-Hat, Little Moe Little Joe, Sambo, Greedy Nigger Boy, Darky Bust, African Native  and the list goes on.\n\nI would venture to say this particular design was the most popular and imitated of any mechanical bank ever produced. I am not aware if any reproductions of the Jolly Nigger bank exist; nevertheless, Figure 3, a base diagram, shows its scale.\n\nMany collectors, including myself, find little, if any, charm or endearing qualities in the Jolly Nigger bank other than its historical significance. Rather, it reflects a period in our history of which I am certain this country is not particularly proud.\n\nThe Mamma Katzenjammer Bank\n\n(a unique paint variation)\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  January, 1984\n\nMama, the Captain, Hans, Fritz, and the Inspector were the cast of characters of a popular turn-of-the-century comic strip called \"The Katzenjammer Kids.\" \"Katzenjammer,\" a word in German slang meaning \"hangover,\" was exactly what the mischievous Hans and Fritz gave to their doting mama.\n\nThe Katzenjammer Kids cartoon strip was created by Rudolph Dirks* (Figure 2) and appeared under his pen and authorship from 1897 until 1912, in a newspaper entitled the New York Journal. Then, when Dirks tried to take a year's vacation during the time the strip was enjoying its heyday, the Journal terminated the artist's employment Dirks still retained the rights to draw his characters, which he did, under the title, \"The Captain and the Kids,\" for another newspaper, the World. Meanwhile, the Journal retained the name, \"Katzenjammer Kids\" and commissioned another artist, Harold Knerr, to recreate Dirks' comic strip for them. These two comic strips ran simultaneously for more than thirty years.\n\nMama, one of the strip's leading characters, was the inspiration for the creation of a mechanical banks which is the subject of this month's article. The Mama Katzenjammer bank depicts this perplexed character desperately trying to separate her bickering sons, Hans and Fritz (Figure 1)  and the action of the bank punctuates her frustration. A coin is deposited into a slot in her back. This causes her large eyes to roll upwards in despair. As the coin falls into the bank, her eyes return to their normal position. The coins are removed by way of a large round Stevens'-type coin trap.\n\nThe Kenton Hardware Company of Kenton, Ohio, manufactured this nostalgic piece of whimsy some time between 1890 and 1920. Although it was the only mechanical bank that they ever produced, Kenton was one of the most prolific iron toy manufacturers of the period. They, and other toy companies, created several other toys and banks utilizing the Katzenjammer characters. There is a bell toy that depicts a spread-eagle Captain with Hans and Fritz riding upon his back. Another bell toy shows Hans and Fritz on a see-saw. And still another has Mama spanking both Hans and Fritz. Finally, there are two small roly-poly-type tin still banks of European manufacture, one of Mama, the other of the Captain.\n\nThe Mama Katzenjammer mechanical bank is one of limited action, but its subject matter and colorful appearance more than make up for that deficiency.\n\nThe bank pictured in this article is unique by not being painted in the conventional manner, and because of this, has the distinction of being considered a rarity. One should take note that antique cast iron mechanical banks were hand painted by workers, who, for the most part, maintained a high degree of creativity and artistry. This creativity occasionally resulted in banks which expressed individuality by deviating from the normal color scheme, and, thus, many have become coveted prizes for the collector.\n\nThe coloration of a Mama Katzenjammer bank usually has Mama wearing a high necked ultramarine blue dress with black shoes. She has black hair. Her teeth are large and white. Fritz, the fellow on her right, has a yellow shirt with a white collar, red trousers, white socks, and black shoes. He has blonde hair. Hans, to Mama's left, sports a red shirt, with a white collar and a large black bow tie with white polka dots. He has yellow trousers, white socks, and black shoes. His hair is black. All three figures have pink skin, dark pink mouths, and blue eyes (portraying a strong family resemblance).\n\nThe Mama Katzenjammer bank pictured in this article is painted in almost the same colors as the one previously described, except for the omission and change of several articles of clothing. Fritz is naked, except for his brown shoes; and Hans is not wearing pants. Mama's gown is low-cut and trimmed in white lace.\n\nThe two halves of Mama are secured by a large single rivet passing through the front and back of her waist.\n\nAn original Katzenjammer bank is quite rare, and its scarcity becomes even more evident when one discovers how few original examples exist. For fear of being redundant, I must once again caution the collector of mechanical banks, and especially this particular one, to be extremely wary when contemplating a purchase. One of the keys in discerning an original from a fake is paint quality and vividness. An original Mama Katzenjammer's colors are extremely bright and pure. The recasts were painted in dull hues, to have the banks appear old and dirty.\n\nI am also including a base diagram of an original bank (Figure 3). A recast will be approximately 3/32 of an inch smaller than the size indicated.\n\nKnowledge, awareness, and detection of reproductions are the collector's greatest assets in ultimately avoiding frustrating and costly errors.\n\n*Figure 2 shows a caricature of the Captain, Mama, the Inspector, Hans, Fritz, and Rudolph Dirks, drawn by Dirks himself.\n\nNote: (from March, 1984) It has been brought to my attention that the article concerning the \"Mamma Katzenjammer\" mechanical bank (Jan. 1984 issue of Antique Toy World) incorrectly stated that the Kenton Hardware Company manufactured only this particular mechanical bank. The fact is that Kenton also produced the \"Standing Bear\" (slot in chest) mechanical bank.\n\nHalls Excelsior\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  February, 1984\n\nDecember 21, 1869 may possibly be the most significant date in the history of the mechanical penny bank. It was on that date that John Hall, of Watertown, Massachusetts, was granted Patent number 98,055 for his invention of the \"Halls Excelsior Bank\"  the earliest patented, commercially manufactured, cast iron mechanical bank known.\n\nThe patent papers (Fig. 1) bear evidence to the fact that the final production bank follows those drawings quite faithfully. The only deviations are: 1) the head of the mustached man became the head of a monkey, and, 2) the pull wire was attached to the monkey and cupola internally rather than externally.\n\nDuring his lifetime John Hall patented many mechanical penny banks, but only four are known to have been manufactured. They are: the Halls Excelsior Bank, the Race Course Bank, the Tammany Bank, and the Liliput Bank. These were all produced by the J. and E. Stevens Foundry of Cromwell, Connecticut.\n\nEach and every mechanical bank designed by John Hall has one unmistakable characteristic ... a series of weights and counterbalances that perform their action only upon the utilization and weight of a coin. In order to activate the Halls Excelsior Bank, the small glass knob on the front of the bank is pulled. This is connected to an internal wire which lifts the cupola, the wooden monkey, and the desk to the position shown in the photograph (Fig. 2). As the monkey is brought into position, his head swings left to right several times. A coin is then placed upon the desk, the weight of which causes the cupola to close and the coin, desk and monkey drop out of sight. To remove the coins, the bank must first be disassembled by unscrewing a long screw that connects the roof of the bank to its base.\n\nThe Halls Excelsior Bank comes in several color combinations. The one portrayed in this article has white walls, green front steps, a green cupola, a red roof, red lettering, and a red brick base. The windows are outlined in blue, as is the spiral design on the sides. The two x's on each side of the word \"HALLS\" are also blue. The wooden monkey has a pink face with black hair, eyes, eyebrows and nose. He sports a dark blue jacket and a white shirt with tiny blue buttons. His wooden desk is red. There is a small paper label affixed behind his head that reads, \"CASHIER.\"\n\nSome other color variations of the Halls Excelsior Bank include tan walls with a blue roof, yellow walls with a maroon roof, maroon walls with a tan roof, etc. The window trim and decorations also vary accordingly, and the monkey may, at times, be attired in a red jacket.\n\nAs discussed in previous articles, patina and paint crazing should help the buyer of this or any antique mechanical bank discern an original from a repaint.\n\nAside from any paint color variations, there are only two casting variations of which I am aware. One has the patent date, Dec. 21, 1869, stenciled on the roof, and the other has this date actually cast into the roof.\n\nSome years ago, rumor had it that several original metal heads were found for the figure behind the desk, but these proved to be of modem manufacture. Until proven otherwise, the only authentic figures should be carved totally out of wood.\n\nI am not aware of any reproductions of the Halls Excelsior Bank: nevertheless, I am including a base diagram (Fig. 3) to indicate size and scale.\n\nThe Halls Excelsior Bank is not considered rare because so many were produced over such a long period of time. But when one discovers how few exist in superb paint condition, with a completely original monkey, desk and cashier's label  only then does this historical bank's true rarity and value become evident.\n\nThe Paddy and the Pig Bank\n\n(The Shamrock Bank)\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  March, 1984\n\nThe old Irish saying, \"As Irish as Paddy's Pig,\" could not be closer to the truth when describing this month's featured mechanical bank. First manufactured and sold in the 1880's by the J. and E. Stevens Company of Cromwell, Connecticut, under the name, \"Shamrock Bank,\" it was affectionately and more appropriately renamed \"Paddy and the Pig\" by mechanical bank devotees.\n\nJames H. Bowen of Philadelphia, PA invented the Paddy and the Pig bank and was granted Patent number 262,361 on August 8, 1882. Attesting to this fact, and inscribed into the base plate, is the following information: \"Eng. Pat. July 28,1882. U. S Pat. Aug. 8, 1882.\" Of particular interest is the fact that this same patent which protects the Paddy and Pig bank also protects the Two Frogs bank, the Reclining Chinaman bank, and the Elephant and Three Clowns bank. In addition, these patent drawings protect only the internal mechanism, and not the subject matter. (See Fig. 1)\n\nThe Paddy and the Pig bank reflects a great deal of the same prejudicial attitudes shared by many toys and banks manufactured in the 19th century. The theme of this particular mechanical was centered upon the newly immigrated Irish people fleeing the famine and oppression of their homeland. The Paddy and the Pig bank portrays just about every conceivable stereotype ever concocted about the Irish: a man with the features and proportions of a leprechaun, who is adorned with shamrocks and a clay pipe. He sits with a jug of whiskey jutting from his pocket; his legs straddle a bespeckled pig who kicks pennies from its snout into Paddy's mouth.\n\nIn order to operate the bank, a penny is placed upon the pig's flat nose. The lever in Paddy's back is depressed. Simultaneously, the pig's left leg kicks the coin towards Paddy's mouth, which then opens, extending a long pink tongue. Paddy's eyes roll upward in delight as the coin is deposited within the bank. These coins are removed by way of a round coin trap underneath the base.\n\nBecause of the action the pig's left leg performs, as described above, this fine mechanical is often discovered in a condition where that leg is either broken or missing.\n\nI am not aware of any casting variations of the Paddy and Pig bank. However, there are three color variations which pertain solely to Paddy's coat. It could either be dark blue, dark brown, or dark green. All other parts of the bank are painted in a somewhat standardized color scheme: the base upon which Paddy sits is bright green; he has a light tan tote bag knotted around a brown shillelagh. A little brown jug juts from his back pocket. His jacket has a black collar and his sleeve buttons are gold. His tie is brown and yellow and the handkerchief in his lapel is tan with red polka dots. His knickers are yellow with black buttons and his knee socks are red. Paddy's shoes are black with gold buckles. His grey hat is adorned with a black band, a green shamrock and a white clay pipe. His face and hands are a pink flesh color, and his hair and eyebrows are black. His eyes are brown with black pupils. He has pink lips, a pink tongue, and his teeth are white. The pig is white with black spots. Its mouth is pink, as are the insides of his ears. Its hoof is tan and the tip of its nose is gold; the rope around its legs is tan.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Paddy and Pig bank has been reproduced, I am including a base diagram (Fig 2) indicating the size of an original bank. A reproduction will measure approximately one-eighth of an inch shorter along the base than an original.\n\nPaddy and the Pig is not considered rare, but its colorful, attractive appearance and complicated life-like action, coupled with its unusual subject matter, make it an extremely popular and highly sought-after mechanical bank.\n\nFinally, a cautionary note: because of the fragile nature and sharp action of the pig's leg, many Paddy banks are found with this part recast. You are correct in assuming that this greatly reduces its value to the serious collector.\n\nNote: It has been brought to my attention that the article concerning the \"Mamma Katzenjammer\" mechanical bank (Jan. 1984 issue of Antique Toy World) incorrectly stated that the Kenton Hardware Company manufactured only this particular mechanical bank. The fact is that Kenton also produced the \"Standing Bear\" (slot in chest) mechanical bank.\n\nThe Speaking Dog Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  April, 1984\n\nImagine, if you will, a bank that doesn't humiliate the poor, doesn't ridicule the underprivileged, doesn't advocate violence, isn't anti-racial, and isn't political  a bank that does nothing more than evoke feelings of nostalgia and a sense of what it might have been like to be a child of \"the good old days.\"\n\nSuch is the subject of this month's article: the beautifully proportioned, delicately painted, \"Speaking Dog\" mechanical bank.\n\nOn October 20, 1885, both Charles G. Shepard and Peter Adams, Jr., of Buffalo, New York, were granted Patent number 328,723 for their design and invention of the Speaking Dog. As evidenced by the patent papers (Fig. 1), the final production bank follows these designs quite faithfully.\n\nThe Shepard Hardware Company of Buffalo, New York started manufacturing the Speaking Dog bank around 1885. Then in 1892, when they discontinued their line of mechanical banks, the J. and E. Stevens Company, of Cromwell, Connecticut, took over production.\n\nThe workings of the Speaking Dog bank are quite complex and intricate, and because of this, a feeling of realism is achieved. A coin is placed upon the girl's round tray. As the lever next to her dog is depressed, the girl's right arm moves back and the tray tilts forward, depositing the coin into the bank. Simultaneously, the chute underneath the tray opens to accept the coin as the dog's jaw moves (hence, the name \"Speaking Dog Bank\") and its tail wags in contentment.\n\nThe only difference between the bank produced by the Shepard Company and the bank produced by the J. and E. Stevens Company is the means by which the deposited coins are removed. The Shepard bank has a square key-locking coin trap in its base, while the Steven's bank utilizes a round coin trap that is opened without a key.\n\nImpressed into the base plates of both banks is the following: \"Pat July 14, 1855 and Oct. 20, 1885.\" (This information aided in the location of the patent papers shown in Fig. 1.)\n\nOther than the coin traps, there are no casting variations of the Speaking Dog bank; however, there is a major color variation. More commonly, the little girl wears a red dress, but occasionally a bank is located that has the dress painted ultramarine blue. Although this is an attractive variant, it does not add to the ultimate rarity or value of the bank.\n\nThe bank pictured in this article (Fig. 2) was manufactured by the J. and E. Stevens Company and the following is its color scheme: the base is reddish-brown with yellow striping. The words, \"Speaking Dog Bank,\" as well as a fancy flourish on the back of the bank, the dog's collar, the fringe on the girl's dress, and the buttons on her shoes, are gold. The top of the bank is light gray. The little girl's face and hands are a natural pink flesh color; her lips are red, and her eyes are blue with black pupils and eyebrows. She has long, wavy blond hair, and sports a red dress with a large white collar and a purple sash around its waist. The bow around her collar is light blue as is the ribbon on her yellow hat. Her stockings are also light blue. The round tray is black, as is the operating lever and the little girl's high button shoes. The dog is mocha brown with white ears and paws. Its eyes are brown with black pupils and it has a red mouth with white teeth.\n\nDue to its colorful appearance, charming subject matter and intriguing action, the Speaking Dog bank gained great popularity during the period of its manufacture.\n\nAn advertisement that appeared in the 1889 edition of the Montgomery Ward and Co. catalog listed the price of the Speaking Dog bank as a mere 80 cents apiece (Fig. 3)  quite a bargain by today's standards.\n\nI have not seen nor heard of any reproductions of this bank; nevertheless, since the possibility may exist, I am including a base diagram (Fig. 4) which will indicate an original's size and scale.\n\nIn conclusion, the Speaking Dog is a bank which seems to have endured the ravages of time. For even today, just as when it was first manufactured over one hundred years ago, it still charms, beguiles and entertains young children. Only today, the children are those who lie within all of us.\n\nThe Tammany Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  May, 1984\n\nThis month's topic of discussion is a mechanical bank that represents a most controversial and colorful episode in American history. Tammany Hall, the popular name of the Democratic Party's executive committee of New York County, was infamous during the nineteenth century for its widespread corruption.\n\nAs early as 1807, Tammany officials were involved in scandals which resulted in their removal from office. Government mismanagement was rampant, especially when \"Boss\" William M. Tweed, in 1868, completely dominated the Hall. Tweed's corrupt behavior, which single-handedly cost New York City more than $200,000,000, landed him in prison, where he eventually died. His legacy was to link the words, \"Tweed\" and \"Tammany\" with graft and corruption.\n\nOn December 23, 1873, John Hall, of Watertown, Massachusetts, was granted Patent number 145,734 for his design and invention of the \"Little Fat Man Bank\" (Fig. 1), which he later renamed the \"Tammany Bank.\" The bank, as eventually manufactured by the J. and E. Stevens Foundry, of Cromwell, Connecticut, bore little resemblance to John Hall's original patent drawings, other than the fact that the subject was a portly man seated in a chair.\n\nOn June 8, 1875, Russel Frisbie, of Cromwell, Connecticut, assignor to the J. and E. Stevens Co. was granted patent number 164,083 for his invention and redesign of Hall's \"Little Fat Man\" bank (Fig. 2). Frisbie utilized springs and levers in his bank to perform the action, unlike the weights and counterbalances used by John Hall. (Incidentally, a most interesting fact about the Tammany bank, as well as all mechanical banks invented by John Hall, is that they only perform their action upon the utilization and weight of a single coin.)\n\nThe Frisbie mechanical bank was never produced. Yet, it did bear an uncanny resemblance to Hall's already manufactured Tammany bank.\n\nOn October 9,1877, John Hall was granted a RE-ISSUE for his patent, under number 7,904. These drawings most closely resemble the actual Tammany production bank (Fig. 3). Moreover, it is within these patent papers that Hall, for the first time, actually makes reference to the name, \"The Tammany Bank.\" As to the reason why he did this, I can only offer speculation. Perhaps Boss Tweed's unsavory reputation would have provided an added spark of interest in his \"Little Fat Man Bank.\"\n\nThe Tammany bank has undergone several casting variations that seem to follow the same evolutionary pattern as the previously described sets of patent papers. One variation has only a \"half scallop shell\" design cast into the sides of the chair, while another has the \"half scallop shell\" design and the words, \"Hall's Pat'd.\" And yet a third has the \"half scallop shell\" design and the words, \"Tammany Bank\" cast into it. There are also three distinctly different cast base plates. One utilizes the round Stevens'-type coin trap for its coin removal; the second utilizes a sliding coin trap; and the third has a rectangular perforated coin trap.\n\nBesides the above casting variations, there are several color differences. The Tammany Bank pictured in this article has pink, flesh-colored face and hands, black hair, eyebrows and moustache, a white shirt with a blue bow tie, a yellow vest with black buttons, and gray pants with black shoes. He also sports a brown jacket. His chair is light green with red trim. Cast into the back rim of the chair are the words, \"Pat'd Dec. 28, 1873.\"\n\nIn other color variations, the little man's jacket could be painted black and his pants, brown. The chair could be either white or tan with orange trim. Please take note that finding a Tammany bank in still another color combination should not preclude its authenticity.\n\nAs to the action of the bank under discussion, an early J. and E. Stevens Co. advertising flyer (Fig. 4) described it quite succinctly: \"Put a coin in his hand and see how promptly he pockets it and how politely he bows his thanks.\"\n\nSeveral years ago, a fellow bank collector offered an interesting interpretation of the \"Tammany bank's action: 'Assuming the bank was, in fact, an effigy of the infamous Boss Tweed, the coin placed into his hand might be likened to a bribe and the polite nod of his head, a confirmation of a corrupt deed granted.' \"\n\nThe Tammany bank gained great popularity during the period of its manufacture, thus providing the impetus for almost unlimited production. The overabundance of supply in the marketplace resulted in it becoming one of the most common mechanicals. Nevertheless, this has not had any affect on its popularity or desirability with today's bank collectors.\n\nBecause the Tammany bank has been reproduced, I am including a base diagram showing its exact dimensions (Fig. 5). A reproduction will be approximately one-eighth of an inch smaller than indicated.\n\nThe Sportsman Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  June, 1984\n\nAvid collectors, as well as the aspiring novice, are acquainted with a category of mechanical banks known as the \"shooting banks.\" This is a group that consists of such familiar names as \"Teddy and the Bear,\" \"Lion Hunter,\" and \"Indian Shooting the Bear.\" Each one portrays a hunter shooting pennies into, or at, the figure of an animal, but never killing it. This month's article, appropriately named the \"Sportsman Bank\" is totally unique to this fine group of mechanical banks in that it vividly portrays the actual downing of the target.\n\nOn June 14, 1892, Edwin I. Pyle of Bridgeport, Connecticut, was granted Patent number 476,895 for his invention of a toy which depicts a hunter shooting a bird from the air. As evidenced by the patent drawings (Fig. 1), the bank, as it was eventually manufactured, follows these designs quite faithfully, with the exception that it was designed to be a toy and not a mechanical bank. In fact, nowhere in these patent papers are the words \"bank\" or \"toy savings device\" mentioned. It appears likely that Edwin Pyle presented his patented toy to the J. and E. Stevens Company, of Cromwell, Connecticut, who felt it would be more saleable as a mechanical bank. Bearing that speculation out is the fact that it was manufactured and sold as a bank under the name, the \"Sportsman Bank.\"\n\nThe action of the Sportsman Bank is extremely realistic: a coin is placed into the slot on top of the base; the catapult spring is then pushed down and set. The pigeon, with its string attached to the bank, is cradled into the catapult (Fig. 2). The gun's hammer is cocked and a paper cup is inserted into the chamber. The lever next to the hunter's right foot is then pressed. Simultaneously, the pigeon springs into the air and hunter turns, as if aiming his rifle. The hammer falls, firing the cap; the bird, reaching the end of its string, is pulled back, and plummets to the ground. The illusion, of course, is that it has been hit by the Sportsman's bullet. The penny is automatically deposited within the bank. These coins are removed by way of a round Stevens' coin trap underneath the base.\n\nAlthough I, personally, find the action, as described, and subject matter fascinating, it does seem, in my opinion, an unusual and perhaps inappropriate toy for a young child.\n\nThe casting of the Sportsman Bank deserves special mention; the figure of the hunter is completely devoid of any of the finely cast details for which Stevens' banks are so well known. Under close examination one will find no seams, collars, cuffs, lapels, or buttons cast into the jacket. Instead, they are painted on. This seems to lend a naive simplicity and primitive feeling to the bank.\n\nThe Sportsman Bank has no casting variation, but there are several color variations. These pertain to the hunter, the base, and the pigeon.\n\nThe bank pictured in this article has a yellow base with a red border and a red flourish on one side. The top is green and the lever is red. The catapult is yellow with red trim. The fowler wears a black-brimmed tan hat, which has a red band along its bottom. His jacket is also tan with red trim around the bottom and front. The sleeves, collar, and pockets are also trimmed in red. His pants are red and his shoes are black. His face and hands are a pink flesh color and he has black hair, eyes, and eyebrows. The pigeon is blue.\n\nOther color schemes include a gold pigeon; the Sportsman's jacket could be red with yellow trim, and his pants could be tan. The base can also be painted red with a yellow border and flourish.\n\nInscribed into the top of the catapult are the words, \"Pat'd. June 14, 1892\"  information which facilitated location of the patent drawings shown in this article.\n\nThe Sportsman Bank is quite rare and this is further substantiated by the fact that few completely original specimens exist in collections. Most often, when one of these banks is found, either the man has been broken off, his gun barrel is missing, or, most often, the pigeon is recast or missing altogether. I would venture a guess that the Sportsman Bank's extreme fragility, combined with its unsuitable subject matter for children, might account for its scarcity. (The bank pictured in this article boasts having two original pigeons; the one in the catapult is painted blue and the other gold.)\n\nSeveral years ago, bank collectors began referring to the Sportsman Bank as the \"Fowler Bank.\" This is the name by which it is referred to at present, and one which is certainly more descriptive for this fine mechanical.\n\nThe Sportsman has never been reproduced. However, I am including a base diagram to show an original's configuration and scale (Fig. 3).\n\nCorrection: (from August, 1984) Re: June 1984 issue of Antique Toy World, \"The Sportsman Mechanical Bank.\" Figure 3, illustrating the base diagram, was placed upside down. It should read \"9 inches\" and not 6 inches.\n\nThe Humpty Dumpty Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  July, 1984\n\nOn January 29, 1884, Charles G. Shepard and Peter Adams, Jr., of Buffalo, New York, walked into the Patent Office and filed an application for a \"new and original design for a toy savings bank.\" On June 17, 1884 they were issued patent number 15,085  and thus was born what many believe to be the most attractive of bust banks: The \"Humpty Dumpty Bank.\"\n\nThis patent number protected only the external design of the Humpty Dumpty Bank and not the internal mechanism. Those internal parts are covered by patent number 255,090, also issued to Charles G. Shepard and Peter Adams, Jr. nearly two years earlier, on March 14, 1882 (Fig. 1). These patent papers do not illustrate the configuration of the \"Humpty Dumpty Bank,\" but rather the \"Jolly Nigger Bank.\" (Both the \"Humpty Dumpty Bank\" and the \"Jolly Nigger Bank\" were manufactured by the Shepard Hardware Co. of Buffalo, New York.)\n\nPerhaps the following explanation will shed light upon the reason why a bank in the form of a clown was named after the egg-shaped character of Mother Goose fame. On March 10, 1868, George L. Fox, a pantomime artist, produced the \"Humpty Dumpty Circus\"  a pantomime show which played to New York City audiences. Fox, the director and star of the \"Humpty Dumpty Circus,\" was the only performer with enough box-office power to keep the art of pantomime alive, especially with the growing popularity of the fresher and more appealing burlesque. He was acclaimed as one of the most gifted performers of the 19th century. The show brought Fox the supreme success of his career  outdrawing and outplaying anything ever presented, shattering all previous box office records.\n\nThe \"Humpty Dumpty Circus\" ran in New York until approximately 1873, when Fox was suddenly institutionalized and died some months after that.\n\nAfter comparing features and decorations in the lithographs of G.L. Fox (Fig. 2) with those of the \"Humpty Dumpty Mechanical Bank\" (Fig. 3), one should have little doubt that the bank is a representation of this most talented and obscure pantomimist of the 19th century.\n\nThe operation of the \"Humpty Dumpty Bank\" is quite simple. A coin is placed in its right hand, and the lever in the back is pressed down. Simultaneously, his eyes roll up, his tongue recedes, and his right arm raises the coin, whereby it is flipped into his awaiting mouth and deposited within the bank. Coin removal is achieved by unscrewing the base plate.\n\nCast into the back of the bank in raised letters are the words, \"THE HUMPTY DUMPTY BANK.\" The base plate also contains the information: \"BUFFALO N.Y.  U.S.A. PAT'D IN U.S. MCH. 14.'82 AND JUNE 17.'84 PAT'D IN CANADA MCH. 27. '83 RD IN ENGLAND NO. 8827.\"\n\nThe following is its color scheme: The clown's face is white; his hat is red, as are the decorations on his face; his lips are brown, and his tongue is red. The collar is brown, white, yellow and blue. The jacket is red, yellow, white, and blue, and the buttons are brown with white centers. His hand is flesh colored (yellowish-pink) and the base plate is a brown Japan finish.\n\nThere are no color or casting variations.\n\nAs with all banks manufactured by the Shepard Hardware Co., the paint proved quite fragile. This was caused by the omission of a primer before the paint was applied to the cast iron. When one does see a \"Humpty Dumpty Bank,\" more often than not, it is in extremely poor condition. A fine one commands a premium price.\n\nThe \"Humpty Dumpty Bank\" has been reproduced; therefore, I am including a base diagram (Fig. 4) to show its exact size. A reproduction will be approximately one-eighth of an inch smaller along the base.\n\nFigure 5 shows an attractive trade card for this fine mechanical, describing the bank as \"highly finished in brilliant colors presenting an unusually attractive appearance.\" It is this sentiment which has made the \"Humpty Dumpty Bank\" one of the most enduring and endearing mechanical banks to collectors.\n\nThe Mason Bank\n\nby Sy Schreckinger  ANTIQUE TOY WORLD Magazine  August, 1984\n\nHistorically, toys savings banks served as devices which enabled young children to learn the lessons of thrift. With the advent of the mechanical toy savings bank, a most entertaining and unique method of achieving that goal was provided.\n\nSome mechanical banks were designed to teach the virtues of thrift through analogy. An example of one of these, and the subject of this month's article, is the \"Mason Bank.\" A mason and his hod-carrying helper build a brick wall one brick at a time, just as the child depositor builds his savings one penny at a time. This dramatization of the mason and hod-carrier is executed quite realistically.\n\nThe \"Mason Bank\" is unique in that it is the only mechanical savings bank which has, as its central theme, workmen engaged in a construction trade.\n\nOn February 8, 1887, Charles G. Shepard and Peter Adams, of Buffalo, New York, were granted Patent number 17,103 for their \"design\" of the \"Mason Bank.\" This patent protects only the design of the bank and not the internal mechanism. As evidenced by the drawing and patent descriptions, the final production bank follows these quite faithfully (Fig. 1).\n\nThe Shepard Hardware Company, of Buffalo, New York, ultimately produced the \"Mason Bank,\" including it in their \"Excelsior Series.\" Other members of this distinguished \"Excelsior\" group of Shepard mechanicals include: the \"Picture Gallery Bank\" and the \"Trick Dog Bank.\"\n\nAs with most Shepard Hardware banks, the paint is usually in extremely poor condition. This is due to the fact that Shepard never used an undercoat primer before they painted their banks. Thus, with any degree of mishandling or adverse atmospheric conditions, the paint would simply flake off the bank. When one of the Shepard banks is found in unusually good paint condition, it is often accomp"
