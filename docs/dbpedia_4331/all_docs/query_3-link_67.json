        "text": "Paul Manuel Garcia was born July 1, 1946, the ninth son of Jesse Garcia and Manuela de la Cruz Felan Garcia in Malakoff, Texas. He died peacefully at home on August 5, 2024 surrounded by his wife, eight children, and longtime friend and “personal physician”, Walt Boyter.\n\nFrom a young age, Paul enjoyed the outdoors and sports. His time on the baseball field playing little league earned him the nickname “Rusty” by his older brother, Jess, due to the red clay and Paul’s resistance to a bath. During his time at Malakoff High School, Paul excelled in academics, sports, and friendships. He was the Malakoff High School halfback Sophomore year and quarterback Junior and Senior year, he was also a Class Officer for three years, Class Favorite, a Sweetheart Escort, and Mr. Malakoff High.\n\nThe loss of his mother at the age of nine and his father’s need for work being satisfied by Texaco’s oil refineries in Port Arthur, Texas created a void that was patchwork filled by his brothers who helped to raise him, each staying at home until it was time to go to college or join the military. When the numbers dwindled to just he and his brother, Eddie, Paul and Eddie moved in with the Surls family. Mr. Joe took Paul under his wing and set out to teach him how to work with his hands, putting him to work alongside his other sons. It was there that Paul learned how to build just about anything he set his mind to make. It was also the season that solidified Paul’s natural drive, work ethic, and desire to “fix” things. Paul would later share that one of his proudest moments occurred when Mr. Joe was introducing his children to someone who was visiting their home and included him as “one of my boys.” After high school, Paul attended Stephen F. Austin University where he continued to excel in academics and friendships. Most notably, he met Clark Greene and his wonderful family who became lifelong friends and cared for Paul as one of their own.\n\nFollowing his undergraduate, Paul applied and was accepted to Baylor Dental School in Dallas, Texas. Paul worked his way through dental school working carpentry and construction jobs. His creative side really shone when he and a friend were walking past the Neiman Marcus storefront window in downtown Dallas and a puzzle ring caught his eye. He came back to the window later with a pencil and paper to sketch the design out and proceeded to make the ring out of gold melted down from “prior dental work”.\n\nUpon graduation of dental school, Paul’s brother, Jess, continued his role as advisor and pointed Paul towards the military. Paul joined at the rank of Captain and listed all the most exotic locations the world has to offer. The Army had better ideas and sent him to Ft. Benning in Columbus, Georgia. It was there that Paul continued to excel at work and friendships, joining Edgewood Baptist Church, and after his time in the army was done, setting up his practice in Columbus, Georgia. It was in Columbus, in 1984, that he met his future wife, Beth, with whom he would share the next almost four decades of life and build a family. Beth vividly remembers knowing that Paul was the man she was meant to spend her life with when she first heard Paul pray at the Valley Rescue Mission when Paul was invited to speak at an event.\n\nPaul and Beth created a rich and full life together, falling into rituals that even life with eight children couldn’t alter. Every Friday evening, Paul and Beth took the evening for themselves; going to dinner and a movie or even dinner and Home Depot; the location or event mattering much less the time spent together. Flowers on the kitchen counter were so common, that Beth would sometimes miss the fact that Paul had brought home fresh ones to replace what he had brought home the week before. Even after the nest became empty, Paul and Beth continued their Friday night date night, frequenting Mark’s City Grill to have their “usual.” In the weeks leading up to Paul’s decline, he made sure that he saved up his energy to be able to go on more dates with his “honey”.\n\nPaul quickly created community in each chapter of life, and Columbus was no different. Through Bible studies, church, and professional development, his core group of friends, including but not limited to Marlon Murrell, Mike Helms, and Alan Binns began to eat lunch together every Tuesday at Country’s BBQ. This group grew and morphed into a Friday golf team that also included Jack Rogers, Keith Myers, and Ed Partain. Fridays were a favorite among his children who took turns having a “day with Daddy” that included doughnuts, Wendy’s, and snacks and driving the golf cart at Bull Creek. Paul’s loyalty and faithfulness in friendship have been a constant throughout his life, always being the one to reach out, to offer a place to stay, or a meal together. In his later years, he still met with Dr. Murrell for Tuesday lunch at Country’s BBQ, spent many a Georgia game with Jay Davis by his side, and rarely missed a lunchtime workout with Tony Link. His family reaped the benefits of this wealth of friendship which has cast a wide net of love and affection that spans the country, which coined the phrase “I’ve got a guy for that…”. His children are particularly grateful for his friendship with Don Duntsch, who shares their dad’s love for people, community and the Lord and has endlessly poured into the Garcia family for 40 years.\n\nHowever, of all of Paul’s accomplishments, both personal and professional, the defining moment of Paul’s life occurred when he was 25 and he came to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. In 1971, Paul began a lifelong pursuit of the Lord and his faith was the cornerstone of his life thereafter. He never passed up an opportunity to share the gospel, spent his days in constant conversation with God, and strove to “hide God’s word in his heart.” Psalm 1 aptly describes the core of who Paul was; “…delighting in the law of the Lord, meditating on his law day and night…a tree planted by streams of water…yielding its fruit in season, whose leaf does not wither…whatever he does prospers.”\n\nPaul was a lifetime member of both the American Dental Association and the Georgia Dental Association, and earned his Master of the Academy of General Dentistry - which only 4% of dentists achieve.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, step-mother; Theresa Manuela Solis Garcia, his “father of the heart”; Joe W. Surls, and his brothers; two at birth, Rudolfo, James, Jesse, Benjamin, and Edward.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife of 38 years, Elizabeth Ann Yarbrough Garcia, 8 children; Theresa Garcia Robertson (Randy) of Cataula, Georgia, Caroline Garcia Osborne (Oakie) of Brevard, North Carolina, Sarah Ann Garcia of Columbus, Georgia, Mary Lou Garcia Cantrell (Duncan) of Huntsville, Alabama, Jesse Garcia (Joanna) of West Palm Beach, Florida, Joe Garcia of Denver, Colorado, Katie Garcia of Columbus, Georgia, and Ben Garcia of Columbus, Georgia, 9 grandchildren; Sally and Andee Robertson, Skye, Nathan Oakley “Cinco” V, and John Paul “Jack” Osborne, and Eleanore, Charlie, and Theodore Surls “Teddy”, and soon-to-be-born Baby Cantrell, his brother and sister-in-law; Frank and Nancy Garcia of Kirbyville, Texas, sister-in -law Peggy Garcia of Goshen, Indiana, sister-in-law Deloras Garcia of Houston, Texas, family of the heart; Jo Ann Price Surls of Malakoff, Texas, James Surls (Charmaine Locke) of Aurora, Colorado, Larry Surls (Mickey), Melissa Surls, and Stephen Surls- all of Malakoff, Texas, loyal and faithful confidant and friend, Pam Keys (Mookie) of Columbus, Georgia, and a host of nieces and nephews, in-laws, and friends.\n\nFlowers will be accepted, those so desiring may make contributions in Paul’s memory to Edgewood Baptist Church, Samaritan Ministries, and Ligoner Ministries."
