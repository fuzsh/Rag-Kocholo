        "text": "Micah Lemuel Garrison, aged 46, of Green Pond, SC, passed away on August 2, 2024. Born on September 12, 1977, in West Columbia, SC, he was the beloved son of Thomas \"Mickey\" Garrison and Marlene Hall Garrison. Micah's life was marked by his towering presence and gentle demeanor, earning him the affectionate nickname \"gentle giant\" among those who knew him best. He was giant by nature and gentle by choice.\n\nA student of Brookland-Cayce High School and graduate of Airport High School, Micah furthered his education at the Culinary Institute of Charleston of Trident Technical College. His passion for the culinary arts began at an early age, starting his career at Gooney Birds Bar and Grill while still in high school. He was proud to say that he had worked his way up from the bottom and truly understood every position within the restaurant industry. His culinary journey took him to Charleston, SC, where he honed his skills and eventually became an executive chef and Director of Food and Beverage at Middleton Place Plantation. There, he was instrumental in promoting sustainable seafood initiatives and was recognized for his contributions to Charleston's culinary scene. Micah's career included pivotal roles at renowned restaurants such as Cypress, 82 Queen, Magnolia's, and High Cotton.\n\nBeyond his professional life, Micah was an avid sports fanatic. When not wearing his chef coat, he would often be seen wearing clothing from the Clemson Tigers, NY Yankees, Buffalo Bills, or NASCAR. His hobbies included mushroom foraging, a skill he mastered after receiving a state approved certification. Through his company, Palmetto Mushrooms, LLC, he supplied unique local mushrooms to fellow chefs, enhancing the culinary landscape of Charleston.\n\nMicah is survived by his parents, Mickey and Marlene Garrison; sister, Melissa Garrison; brother, Matthew Garrison (Angela); nephew, Drew (Sophia) Garrison; niece, Abbi (Parker) Whittle; nephew, Zach Garrison; and great-niece, Ivy Garrison.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his grandparents, Bunk and Jessie Garrison, and Ralph and Marjorie Hall.\n\nVisitation will be held on Tuesday, August 6, from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm at Barr-Price Funeral Home in Lexington, SC. Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday, August 7, at 2:00 pm at Trinity Baptist Church Cayce, with burial to follow at Southland Memorial Gardens.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the South Carolina Aquarium, an organization close to Micah's heart. The Garrison family extends their gratitude to the Hall Management Group and Chef Matthew Niessner for their unwavering support during Micah's illness.\n\nOnline register at Barr-Price.com"
