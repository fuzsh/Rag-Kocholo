        "text": "Born in Lindsay, Ontario, Ruth Abernethy began a creative profession from high school. First working as Assistant Carpenter at the Kawartha Summer Theatre in Lindsay, she later attended Malaspina College in Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nRuth turned 21 as the Head of Props at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre and created props in theatres across Canada for 20 years. She was Head of Props at Shaw Festival, built special items for the National Ballet of Canada, and spent 15 seasons with the Stratford Festival Theatre.\n\nIn 1996, Ruth exhibited her first sculpture collection in Waterloo. Her first work in bronze was Raising the Tent (1997). This complex design, located on the grounds of the Stratford Festival Theatre, depicts the raising of the poles of the original performance tent.\n\nOver the last 22 years, Ruth has completed dozens of commissioned works, primarily in bronze and, occasionally, in stainless steel. These works are found in public spaces and private collections in Waterloo Region, across Canada, and beyond.\n\nIn 2018, Ruth was awarded an Honorary Degree from Wilfrid Laurier University.\n\nRuth’s installations assume a place in the landscape and engender a sense of pride among members of the community. They spark curiosity. They seek to inspire, entertain, educate, and inform. They invite viewer interaction and participation, and they always tell a story. Ruth’s work will be her legacy.\n\nCarl Ahrens was born in Winfield, near Elora, Ontario. He moved to Berlin, Ontario where he attended school until his father's death in 1875. He later lived in Winnipeg and travelled extensively in the American and Canadian west.\n\nReturning to Berlin, Ahrens worked as a dyer in a button factory, where he began his mastery of colour. In his early twenties he began to paint from his Toronto studio. His first exhibition was at the Ontario Society of Artists in 1889. In 1891 he was elected associate painter of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He later studied painting and sculpture in New York. From 1900 to 1902, Ahrens lived in New York State where he helped to start the Roycroft pottery.\n\nIn 1922, after a sojourn of several years in the U.S., Ahrens and his family moved back to Toronto, and soon after settled in a farmhouse near Galt, Ontario, which Carl named \"Big Trees.\" Here he painted and taught, often entertaining Homer Watson, a lifelong friend. A childhood bout of tuberculosis in the hip left him an invalid in his later years, although he continued to paint until his death in 1936 at the age of 73.\n\nRay Alviano was born in 1934 in Guelph. He got his start in the newspaper business in 1956 at the Guelph Mercury, working as a general reporter/photographer. In 1959, Alviano was hired by the K-W Record for a position in its sports department. His career at The Record spanned 33 years. From 1968 to 1978 Alviano held the sports editor's position. He was a member of the Ontario Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association, serving two terms as president in the early 1970s.\n\nAlviano's efforts did not go unnoticed as many local, provincial and national athletic organizations honoured him for his work. In 1981 he was inducted into the Ontario Five-Pin Bowling Association Hall of Fame.\n\nAlviano took on the job of managing the K-W Civitan junior women's softball team in 1983 and that year they won both the provincial and national championships. It would be the start of more successful runs, as the Civitan won provincial and national honours in 1987, 1989 and 1990.\n\nAlviano was the founding president of Kitchener Fastball Promotions founded in 1994. The mandate of the group is to bring provincial, national and international softball (fastball) events to Kitchener. Alviano's volunteerism was also significant with Kitchener Minor hockey, Kitchener Minor Girls Softball and Kitchener Minor Baseball.\n\nHe was a member of the organizing committee for five Canadian junior baseball championships from 1995 to 2000. He volunteered for the 1997 World Women's Hockey Championship and 4 Nations Cup in 2002, both held in Kitchener.\n\nAlviano was also the media vice-chair for the 2008 Memorial Cup Junior Hockey Championship held at the Kitchener Auditorium.\n\nAmanda Overland Anatol, from Kitchener, came onto the national short track speed skating scene in the late 1990s and won her first major international medal in 2003 - silver in the 3000m relay at the World Championships in Sweden.\n\nDuring the 2004-2005 season Overland experienced success as an individual, winning silver in the 1000m at World Cup USA and bronze in the 1500m at World Cup Slovakia.\n\nIn 2005 Overland was named Speed Skating Canada's Short Track Athlete of the Year, and she was ranked first in Canada in her sport. The same year, she was named KW Athlete of the Year.\n\nIn advance of the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, Overland qualified for the 1000m, 1500m and 3000m relay races. She placed fifth in both of her individual events. In the team relay Overland and her teammates won an Olympic silver medal.\n\nIn 2007, she was a member of the 3000m Canadian relay team that won a bronze medal at the World Championships in Milan. During her career, Overland competed in five world championships.\n\nThe Cambridge Speed Skating Club has raised six banners at the Hespeler Arena to honour their internationally acclaimed athletes, including Overland.\n\nRaffi Armenian was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1942 and immigrated to Canada in 1969.\n\nArmenian was the Artistic Director of the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony from 1971 to 1993. He transformed a community orchestra into a world-class professional symphony. In 1974, its professional core, the Canadian Chamber Ensemble, was formed by Armenian and it became recognized as one of the premier ensembles in North America with tours that took it all over the world.\n\nRecognizing the need for a performance space that would complement the professional orchestra, Armenian was instrumental in the building of the Centre in the Square in Kitchener, one of Canada's finest performance halls where opera, choral, ballet, theatre and other groups perform.\n\nArmenian's work has been recognized with countless honours including an Emmy Award Nomination for a television opera starring Maureen Forrester. He is a Member of the Order of Canada and has honorary doctorates from the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University.\n\nIn 1999 he became Director of Orchestral Studies at the University of Toronto. He has also held several other professorships in Canada and Europe.\n\nJohn Ashley was born in Galt and lived in Preston until Grade 12. John played minor hockey in Preston and later he played for the Toronto Marlboros and the Guelph Biltmores. Ashley signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1950, and in the ensuing three years, played for their Pittsburgh farm team in the AHL. Ashley sought and gained reinstatement as an amateur in 1954. He then played three years with Stratford in Senior A hockey.\n\nAshley became interested in officiating in 1957. By 1959 he signed a contract to officiate in the NHL. Ashley spent eighteen years in the NHL - thirteen as a referee and five as a scout and councillor to referees.\n\nAshley refereed 1075 games. Of this, 622 were regular NHL games and fifty-eight were NHL play-off games. In the last eight of his thirteen on-ice seasons, Ashley was rated the NHL's number one referee. Ashley's overall record in Stanley Cup play-offs was one of high quality performance, under sustained pressure, over a period of ten years.\n\nOn September 15, 1981, Ashley was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nDon Awrey was born in Kitchener. At the age of sixteen he was a member of the Waterloo Siskins team which won the Ontario Hockey Association Championship in 1959-60. He played Junior A for the Niagara Falls Flyers from 1961 to 1964, a team which reached the Canadian finals in his last year.\n\nAwrey signed with the Boston Bruins when he was twenty and played on two Stanley Cup winning teams. He was chosen to play for Team Canada against the Russians in 1972.\n\nAwrey was named a member of the Western All Stars while playing for the St. Louis Blues in 1973-74. He was playing for the Montreal Canadiens in 1975 when they won the Stanley Cup. He also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers and Colorado Rockies. Awrey ran a hockey school in the off-season.\n\nAwrey retired from the NHL in 1979, having played nearly 1,000 games.\n\nJohn Bain was born in Galt and began his baseball career with the Galt Pickards Juveniles (Ontario Champions in 1937) and later with the OBAA Senior Welland Nationals of the Niagara District League before World War II. He joined the RCAF in 1942, where he served for four years, including service in England and continental Europe.\n\nAfter the War, Bain returned to play with Galt in 1946 and Kitchener from 1947 to 1950. In 1946, he led the Intercounty League in runs scored (29); in 1947, he led the League in stolen bases (21) and runs scored (31); in 1948, he led the League in triples (7) and number of hits (52). His batting average was consistently in the 333 to 350 range over his years in baseball. In 1948, he was voted Most Valuable Player in the Intercounty League by team managers and coaches.\n\nBain earned his BA at McMaster University, a teacher's certificate from the Hamilton Normal School and a BEd from the University of Toronto. He holds an Elementary School Inspector's Certificate.

While walking in the field in the spring, he noticed standing alone one plant obviously unusually vigorous, that had withstood the adverse weather. He saved the plant and in a few years produced enough grain to seed his own farm and sell a quantity to a neighbour. The Ontario Agricultural College purchased some of the wheat, and on testing it in their plots discovered that it far out yielded all other varieties. They gave it the name \"Dawson's Golden Chaff.\" This variety is, in 1972, still being used in test plots at Guelph to improve new varieties of wheat.\n\nCoach and educator, Marty Deacon has had an extensive career locally, nationally, and internationally.

After operating for one week with many breakdowns, he returned the truck to the dealer. With another contract offer and the encouragement of his wife, Viola, he picked up the truck and set out with new determination. A year later Erb bought the second truck and several years later began hauling eggs from farms to chain stores in Toronto.\n\nIn 1965 Erb purchased his first refrigerated truck to haul frozen turkeys for a processing plant. In 1970 Erb was successful in the purchase and transfer of a Public Commercial Vehicle license authorizing the transportation of food products requiring temperature control.
