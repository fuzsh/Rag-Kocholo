She coached SMS from 1972-82, compiling a record of 227-111, but her greatest accomplishment came in 1974. That year her team went 19-4 and won the national championship of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, defeating Massachusetts, Luther, Eastern Illinois, Wayne State, and Northern Coloradoin Omaha, Nebraska to claim the Women’s College World Series of Softball title.\n\nThat team was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

Since his prep playing days at Willard High School, he has been a significant figure as a coach, an official, and a participant. After graduation from Southwest Missouri State University and a two year stint of military service, Larry embarked upon a career of coaching basketball, with stops at Weaubleau, Clever, and Buffalo, winning a state title for the Bison in 1965. But he is known best for his 21 years of service at Greenwood Laboratory School, where his teams finished as state runner-ups twice. After 28 years of coaching, he retired in 1990 with a record of 545-242.\n\nDuring his time at Greenwood, Larry assumed the duties as director of the Blue & Gold Tournament. His 21 years are more than anyone else’s tenure in that capacity. He brought the Blue & Gold through a heyday of moving from McDonald Arena into Hammons Student Center, and saw crowds grow and interest rise with his leadership.\n\nLarry’s talents were not just limited to coaching basketball. For many years, he was recognized as a top-level high school and college official, working hundreds of area games. He was also a central figure in softball, pitching and coaching for the framed Barnes Store teams of the 1960s.

From go-karts to street stocks, modifieds, and ultimately limited rides on the NASCAR circuit, the Ropers of Fair Grove have raced them all successfully.\n\nBrothers Dale and Dean brought the glimmer of the speedway spotlight to the family first. Dean began racing in the late 1950s, and Dale wasn’t far behind. The tandem tore their way through nearly every track in the area, state, and region. While Dale’s success came mostly close to home, with ventures into USAC and ARCA racing, younger brother Dean took the Roger name further, also racing and winning on those same circuits and eventually racing on the big stage of NASCAR, three times competing in the Daytona 500.\n\nThe Roper saga continued years later with Dean’s son Tony. He too rose through the ranks of the small circuits, but took the name to an even higher level, racing and winning on the Craftsmen Truck series as well as the Busch series.\n\nWhile racing carries great rewards, they come at a greater expense. In 2000, Tony was killed in an accident on the Craftsman circuit in Texas, and one year later Dean suffered a fatal heart attack while behind the wheel in an ARCA race in Illinois. As late as 2008 and many seasons after retiring, Dale returned to race selected tracks in the Ozarks, extending the tradition of the Racing Ropers even further.\n\nDrury Basketball Player\n\nOne of the all time greatest basketball players in Drury University's history, Jerry was the centerpiece of a glorious era of Panther basketball from 1975-1979.

Upon earning his masters degree at Midwestern State University in Texas, he began teaching and coaching in the Kansas City area. His last position was at Park Hill High School.
