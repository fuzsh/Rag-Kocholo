        "text": "Seth Rogers Brooks, St. Lawrence 1922 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number 01\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 16, 1984\n\nWhen the Oxford Cup was established as recognition for living Betas of Achievement, there was simply no question that the first to be so recognized would be.\n\nDr. Seth R. Brooks. “Beta’s living legend,” he also ranked as one of the foremost spokesmen for the entire American fraternity system.\n\nHe was executive officer of Beta Theta Pi as General Secretary 1950-60, a decade when the Administrative Secretaries reporting to him from the Oxford office were Ralph Fey and Fred Brower. He was the Fraternity’s President for two terms, 1960-66.\n\nSince 1951, each issue of The Beta Theta Pi magazine had carried an essay by Dr. Brooks under the heading “Inter Fratres.” These had been reprinted often in the magazines of other Greek societies. Many of these essays and some of his sermons and other addresses had been assembled in a 1967 volume, In Beta’s Broad Domain, published by the Fraternity.\n\nHe had been a perennially exciting speaker at Beta Conventions for many years, as recently as the previous August, attending his 50th Convention. This was more than any other living Beta had attended. Four of these had been at Miami, the Centenary in 1939, and other anniversary Conventions in 1954, 1964 and 1979.\n\nAt the 1979 Convention, a new dimension had been added to the Beta student aid program with the establishment of the Seth R. Brooks and Corinne H. Brooks Scholarship Fund. In contrast to other scholarships offering assistance to Beta undergraduates or Beta graduate students, this fund provides for sons or daughters of Betas, wherever they might attend college; membership in Beta Theta Pi is not a requisite. The first donor to this new fund was the outgoing president of the Fraternity, Dr. James G. Martin, former Davidson College chemistry professor, later a Congressman and Governor of North Carolina.\n\nDr. Brooks’ achievements had not been limited to Beta Theta Pi or any other aspect of collegiate life. One of his “Inter Fratres” essays titled “Freedom Within” had gained him a Freedoms Foundation Award in 1967. His alma mater, St. Lawrence University, which had awarded him an honorary degree in 1936, named him in 1979 recipient of its Sol Feinstone Award for “significant contributions to advance the freedom of man to pursue his individual religious beliefs.” He also had received the 1966 National Interfraternity Conference Gold Medal Award and the 1969 Lambda Chi Alpha Interfraternity Service Award.\n\nRecollections and Reflections of Seth R. Brooks and Corinne H. Brooks, prepared as an oral history edited by William Lloyd Fox, St. Lawrence ’75, was published by the board of trustees of his church in 1977.\n\nDr. Brooks was born in New York City in 1901. He was graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1922, began preaching in churches near Canton before finishing theology school, and received St. Lawrence’s Bachelor of Divinity in 1924. He attended his first Beta Convention as a sophomore in 1919, served the Fraternity as a district chief and as alumni affairs commissioner for much of the next 20 years and went to Washington from a pastorate at Malden, Mass.\n\nHe was a member of the budget committee of the District of Columbia Community Chest 1942-45, member of the General Commission of the Army and Navy Chaplains 1940-46, chairman of the Committee on Religious Life in Washington longer than any other person, president of the 500-member Washington Ministerial Union 1954-55 and first minister to be a member of Planned Parenthood. When Congress established an Alcoholism Clinic for the District of Columbia in 1946, he was named on its first advisory board. He participated in the 1960 White House Conference on Children and Youth.\n\nSeth passed away at age 86 on October 7, 1987. He would have protested any description of that passing as “unexpected,” for he had lived like a man ready for anything. The rest of us would never have been prepared to lose him.\n\nWritten by: Robert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJoseph Percival Allen IV, DePauw ’59\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 02\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 16, 1984\n\nMost men gladly would accept even one of the traits which set Astronaut Joe Allen virtually in a class by himself. Modest as he is, there is one trait he proudly will acknowledge: he alone has had the honor of standing with Seth Brooks as a recipient of the first Oxford Cups, August 16, 1984, at the 145th General Convention at Lake of the Ozarks.\n\nOthers are unique, or nearly so. One gives him special pride because it is shared by his brother, Dr. David T. Allen, DePauw ’61, physician, president of the Kentucky Center for Health Education. Each was an excellent varsity wrestler in college who made Phi Beta Kappa and showed leadership.\n\nAdd to that their membership in a four-generation DePauw Beta family: their grandfather, Joseph P. Allen, Jr. 1897; a great-uncle, Dr. Percy Hypes Swahlen 1899; their father, J. P. (Perk) Allen III ’30; themselves, of course, and Timothy J. Allen ’92, Kentucky artist, son of David.\n\nFor good measure, Joe was vice president of the Delta chapter and the 1956 Beta General Convention floor manager.\n\nConsider these along with Joe’s Fulbright Fellowship in Germany, his fluency in German, his Yale doctorate in nuclear physics, his extraordinary fluency in delighting an audience with a thorough yet casual discussion of the role of space travel in today’s world and tomorrow.\n\nFurthermore, realize that as Washington-based president and CEO of Space Industries International, he has the exciting responsibility for coordinating that company’s effort to assist commercial business in taking advantage of space, partly through the development of an Industrial Space Facility. He has been called “an astronaut-turned-executive who is a chief salesman for building and launching the ISF.”\n\nJoe Allen was an instructor and research associate in the nuclear physics laboratory of the University of Washington on a post-doctoral fellowship when he was selected for the astronaut program in 1967. He served in a wide variety of positions for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration over the next four years. He achieved fame as the capsule communicator in Mission Control who talked directly to the astronauts during the Apollo 15 moon mission in 1971. He knew their problems, shared their hopes and spoke their language.\n\nBy the time he made his first space flight in 1982 as a member of the crew of Columbia, he had been designated and trained as one of the first of a new breed of astronauts called “mission specialists.” As a physicist, he was the fifth scientist to fly in space. The mission was the first commercial flight, with Joe given the assignment of launching one of the two communication satellites put into orbit.\n\nThere was one disappointment for him. He had been scheduled to be one of the first astronauts to walk in space since 1975, but faulty space suits nullified that.\n\nHe did get to go space-walking, to rescue a communications satellite, in two Discovery flights in Nov. 1984. These went into the records as “first satellite retrieval and repair,” thrilling millions of tense TV viewers. Furthermore, this was a scant three months after the Beta Convention when he received the Oxford Cup.\n\nIn 1984 and 1986, with Russell Martin, author of Cowboy: The Enduring Myth of the Wild West, Joe Allen produced successive editions of Exploring Space: An Astronaut’s Odyssey. This is a magnificent volume which in itself would have rated an Oxford Cup if earlier exploits had not already made that absolute. Some remarkable photographs by Allen and his crewmates have made this memorable. An autographed copy of the first edition is in the John Reily Knox Memorial Library.\n\n“For more than two decades, the essential work of space travel focused on the technological refinement of the vehicles and support systems that could take us to space and back again, and on the study of the human response to those journeys,” says Allen in Exploring Space.\n\n“Still in that era of experimentation, the first four missions of the shuttle orbiter Columbia were test flights designed to gauge the Space Transportation System’s capabilities. The flight of STS-5 launched on November 11, 1982, marked a fundamental shift in the goals of manned space flight from exploration to operation — from testing the means of getting into space to using the resources found there.\n\n“When the crew members of the fifth shuttle mission — Vance Brand, Bob Overmyer, Bill Lenoir and Joe Allen, who dubbed themselves the Ace Moving Company: Fast and Courteous Service — deployed two communications satellites that had been carried to space in the orbiter’s cargo bay, they initiated a new era in which the business of space flight became business itself. Today each shuttle mission is devoted to a wide variety of operations — from satellite deployment and repair to manufacturing pharmaceutical compounds that are difficult to create on earth.\n\nA recent survey indicates that more than 80 companies worldwide are interested in using the shuttle for a total of more than 200 commercial and experimental projects. By 1990 a fleet of five or more orbiters may be flying 20 missions a year to fulfill this need.\n\n“The astronauts aboard each shuttle mission are no longer simply space explorers but, rather, a collection of skilled space workers — men and women whose jobs are to maneuver the craft in space, to unload new satellites being delivered to orbit, to pick up and repair or bring home satellites that have developed problems, to work outside the cabin in life-supporting pressure suits or to perform experiments in a large laboratory carried aloft by the orbiter. The pilot-astronauts of the first decades of space flight have been joined by engineers, scientists and technicians — known as mission and payload specialists — charged simply with getting the jobs done, with carrying out the crucial and often creative work of space.”\n\nWritten by: Robert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJohn Sherman Cooper, Centre 1922, Yale 1922 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number 03\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 15, 1985\n\nAthlete, Senator, Ambassador and diplomat, John Cooper received his Oxford Cup from his longtime friend in Congressional circles, John J. Rhodes, Kansas State ’38, then President of the Fraternity, at the 146th General Convention.\n\nThe Beta magazine’s account describes the recipient as “the dynamic, personable Kentuckian (who) was one of the best-known men in government and made the type of impact that will keep people talking of him for decades to come.”\n\nCooper spent only his freshman year at Centre. However, that saw him earn a varsity football letter among first- and second-year students who would gain notoriety in the 1921 season with a 6-0 victory over Harvard. Moreover, it brought initiation into Beta Theta Pi with a chapter roll number between two teammates who would become famous on that team: Bo McMillin and Ben Cregar. Cooper, however, transferred to Yale, where he switched to basketball and twice captained that team and was voted most popular and most likely to succeed.\n\nAfter attending Harvard law school, he began law practice, spent a term in the state legislature and eight years as a county judge, ran for the Republican nomination for governor and in 1942 enlisted as an Army private. In Patton’s 3rd Army in Europe, he advanced to captain, won a Bronze Star and was a military government officer in Bavaria after V-E Day. Then, while still in Germany, he won the election to a circuit judgeship in Kentucky. He was elected Senator from Kentucky in 1946 and was later elected to fill two other unexpired Senate terms.\n\nNamed a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, he became a representative of the United States in forming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Next, he was Ambassador-at-large to the NATO Conference on mutual defense. By 1950, Newsweek had called him “the ablest Republican in the Senate: and Time in a cover story praised his national and international leadership. He was named Ambassador to India and Nepal in 1955.\n\nHe returned to serve in the Senate until 1960. Then he was sent to Russia on a secret assignment to talk with Kremlin leaders; his conclusions became factors in President John F. Kennedy’s foreign policy. In 1965 he was named advisor to the United States Delegation to the Treaty Signing Conference in Manila, establishing the Asian Development Bank. In 1969 the Cooper-Church bill was said to have brought the Vietnam conflict into more precise focus and aided our military withdrawal from Vietnam. After a long time with the Washington law firm of Covington and Burling, he was named in 1974 by President Gerald Ford to be the first U.S. Ambassador to East Germany.\n\nn recognition of his work on behalf of rural electrification in Kentucky as a Senator, the East Kentucky RECC has been named the John Sherman Cooper Power Plant. He died February 21, 1991, in Washington, D.C.\n\nWritten by: Robert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJohn Napier Wyndan Turner, British Columbia ’49\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 04\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on February 3, 1986\n\nJohn N. Turner would seem to have been marked as a winner even from boyhood. He has been a national champion athlete, a Rhodes Scholar, a member of a major law firm, Prime Minister of Canada and distinguished public speaker.\n\nThe fourth person to receive Beta’s Oxford Cup, he was the first Canadian so honored, as the guest of honor at the annual formal dinner of the Southern Ontario Beta Alumni Assn., gathered on May 24, 1986, at the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, to pay tribute to the 50th anniversary of the British Columbia chapter’s charter.\n\nIt was considered fitting that he be honored guest and speaker on this occasion. He also had spoken at the 1981 Toronto banquet celebrating the 75th anniversary of the installation of Canada’s first Beta chapter at the University of Toronto.\n\nElected to the Canadian Parliament four times, he was Leader of the Opposition at the time. He succeeded Pierre Trudeau as Prime Minister in 1984 when Trudeau decided to retire. Both were Liberals. He called a general election within the time required under those circumstances and was defeated by Brian Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative.\n\nTurner was born in Richmond, Surrey, England, so he returned to his native country when he was appointed to a Rhodes Scholarship. He was the second member of Gamma Omicron to be elected a Rhodes Scholar within four years. He did additional graduate study at the Sorbonne in Paris while abroad. On his return, he became a partner in the prestigious law firm of McMillan, Binch. He became highly visible in the 1960s and 1970s and held office as Register General, Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, Solicitor General, Minister of Justice, Attorney General and Minister of Finance. For three years, he was the first chairman of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund.\n\nKnown as Chick Turner through boyhood, he starred in football and hockey at St. Patrick’s College, Ottawa, and was on its hockey team, which reached the quarterfinal playoffs for the Memorial Cup three straight years.\n\nHe won four Canadian championship gold medals competing in track: the Canadian junior 100- and 220-yard sprints at Edmonton and the senior 220 at the 1947 Caledonian Games at Calgary. Also, he equaled the Northern Division Pacific Coast Conference record of 9.7 seconds for the 100. He ran on the winning Canadian mile relay team and had been on the university’s swim team.\n\nIn his final year at UBC, he was on Student Council and Big Block Club as an outstanding sprinter. He was a sports writer and editor on Ubyssey, the student paper.\n\nHe represented his chapter at the 108th Beta Convention in 1947. He was remembered as an excellent social chairman and a participant in six sports as Beta won the intramural championship two consecutive years.\n\nFormer president of the Junior Bar of Canada, he also is a member of the English Bar. He has been “called to the bar” of Quebec, Ontario, Barbados, the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Trinidad and British Columbia.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nArch Alfred Moore, Jr., West Virginia ’48 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 05\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 8, 1986\n\nGovernor of West Virginia 1969-77 and 1984-88, Arch Moore is the only chief executive of his state to have held office for three terms.\n\nHe was 1971 chairman of the National Governors’ Conference, 1976 national chairman of the Republican Governors’ Conference, 1972 president of the council of State Governments, and 1974-76 president of the Education Commission of the United States. He co-chaired the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\nHis three years as a vice president and trustee of Beta Theta Pi, 1986-89, capped an undergraduate career. He was president of the Beta Psi chapter and president of his University’s Council of Fraternity Presidents; wrote its student body constitution and founded Mountaineer Day.\n\nHis bachelor’s degree from the University of West Virginia was in political science. He received his law degree from the same institution in 1951 as president of his law school class and immediately began law practice in his hometown, Moundsville, Va. He was elected to a two-year term in the West Virginia legislature two years later. He represented his state in the First Congressional District of West Virginia for six consecutive terms beginning in 1957 at age 33.\n\nHe was one of six governors invited to visit the People’s Republic of China in May 1974 as special representatives of the United States. A year later, he was one of eight governors who visited the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to improve communications between Soviet and U.S. leaders. On that trip, as a Special Representative for President Gerald Ford, he opened the Bicentennial Exposition of the World of Franklin and Jefferson in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nA member of the Republican National Committee from 1963, he has been a delegate to four Republican National Conventions and a platform speaker at two of them.\n\nAn Army infantryman in World War II, he was seriously wounded in action in Ger- many in 1944. He was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, a Combat Infantryman’s Badge and three battle stars on his European Campaign Ribbon.\n\nGovernor Moore was born April 16, 1923, at Moundsville, son of Arch A. and Genevieve Jones Moore. He attended Moundsville public schools and Lafayette College before entering the University. He maintains a permanent residence in Glen Dale, W. Va. He married Shelley Riley on August 11, 1949. They are parents of Arch A. Moore III, West Virginia ’73; Shelley Wellons Moore Capito and Lucy St. Clair Moore Durbin. They have six grandchildren.\n\nHe is past vice president of the West Virginia Bar Assn., past chairman of Mohawk District Boy Scouts of America, and a member of Rotary and the Board of Stewards of Simpson Methodist Church in Moundsville; Phi Delta Phi international legal fraternity and other civic, social and fraternal organizations.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nStephen Davison Bechtel, Sr., California 1923 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 06\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on April 28, 1987\n\nA name with worldwide recognition in engineering and construction was added to the Beta Oxford Cup roster with the presentation to Stephen D. Bechtel, Sr., California ’23, by President John J. Rhodes, Kansas State ’38, on April 28, 1987, before some 100 Bay Area alumni at the San Francisco Olympic Club.\n\nDuring the 40 years he was president, CEO and chairman of Bechtel Group, it expanded into seven operating companies. It experienced a tremendous expansion in the scope of projects and geographically. In the 1930s, it built the Hoover Dam and the seven-mile San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. In World War II, it modified hundreds of aircraft, built 500 ships and a pipeline through the sub-Arctic and was a joint venturer with the Pacific Naval Air Base Contractors in expanding airports and marine terminals in 28 Pacific islands. Since then, Bechtel Corp. has grown continually, both alone and in joint ventures.\n\nIts international projects have included pipelines, terminals and oil refineries in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, the South Pacific and Canada. Comparatively recent undertakings have included the building of Jubail, an entirely new industrial city for 275,000 people in Saudi Arabia; a synthetic fuel project in New Zealand convert- ing natural gas to gasoline; a 286-mile pipeline across the Andes in Colombia; two international airports in Saudi Arabia and a power plant in Egypt; decontamination of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor; the Deepwater Cogeneration project in Texas and the 3,810 megawatts Palo Verde nuclear generating station in Arizona.\n\nBechtel Group, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, had three Betas at the helm. Stephen D. Bechtel, Sr., California ’23, son of Founder Warren A. Bechtel; top executive responsibilities are in the hands of Chairman Stephen D. Bechtel, Jr., Colorado ’47, and President Alden P. Yates, Stanford ’51. Other Beta Bechtels include the late Kenneth K. Bechtel, California ’22, and the late Warren A. Bechtel, Jr., California ’23, Steven’s brothers.\n\nBechtel began as a modest construction company in 1898. While still in his teens, Stephen served in France with the 20th Engineers of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. After graduation, he joined the family business and was made vice president in 1925, president after his father’s death in 1935, chairman in 1960 and senior director upon retirement in 1965.\n\nThe firm is one of the largest of all privately-owned corporate groups. President Ronald Reagan chose two Bechtel men for his cabinet: George Schultz as Secretary of State and Caspar Weinberger as Secretary of Defense.\n\nStephen Bechtel was placed in Fortune’s Hall of Fame for Business Leadership. The American Society of Civil Engineers included him in its Top Ten Construction Men of the Past Half-Century, and the American Academy of Achievement named him for its Golden Plate Award. He died March 14, 1989, in his hometown, Oakland, California. He was 88.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nDr. Yu-Chuen James Yen, Yale 1918 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 07\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 19, 1987\n\nRespected worldwide as a leading humanitarian and educator, Dr. Yu-Chuen James Yen received the Oxford Cup at Beta’s 148th General Convention at the Grove Park Inn, Asheville, N.C., on August 20, 1987. He had become known for having set in motion forces that made possible the education of more than 60 million Chinese, bringing functional literacy to the common person for the first time.\n\nAsked by the National War Work Council of the YMCA to go to France upon graduation from Yale to assist with the thousands of coolies in the Chinese Labor Corps recruited by the Allies in World War I, he began his literacy aid which turned out to be a “crusade” affecting millions.\n\nJimmy Yen founded the Chinese Mass Education Movement in 1923. He worked with the government to bring about primary health care to the villages and started an unprecedented program of “village scholars.” This program brought the most modern agriculture and animal husbandry techniques to the hinterlands by educating a chosen few and then educating the masses.\n\nTo carry this work to the world, he founded the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction in 1960. His unique practical training assisted the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Philippines.\n\nPresident Reagan in 1987 awarded him the Eisenhower Medallion of People to People International, recognizing his efforts toward world peace. A distinguished body of scholars and scientists, asked to pick “the ten greatest revolutionaries of our time” to receive Copernican Citations in 1943, marking the 400th anniversary of the death of Copernicus, listed him along with Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, Orville Wright, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison. A 1987 Presidential End Hunger Award for lifetime achievement cited him for “developing and disseminating a sustained, integrated program to overcome the root causes of hunger and poverty in the Third World.\n\nHe was imaginative and aggressive in tapping some of his Beta contacts for help in his crusade. Among these were Stanley S. Kresge, Michigan ’24; Charles P. Taft, Yale ’18, and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Whitman ’20. He told the Convention audience how such men helped him draft IRR by-laws, raised funds for IRR and served on its board at his request.\n\nJimmy Yen died of pneumonia in New York City on January 17, 1990, at age 96.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJohn Robert Wooden, Purdue ’32 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 09\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on November 17, 1987\n\nThere will surely never be another match, the All-Everything-of-Every-Year UCLA Coach John Wooden. He seems universally accepted as the most respected man in basketball history.\n\nHis Oxford Cup was presented at a Greater Los Angeles Beta Alumni gathering on November 17, 1987, at the Bel-Air Country Club. It had been on Betas’ agenda for a long time, but Coach had been too busy, too much in demand, too friendly to put off people to whom he felt committed, to take time out for kudos.\n\nJohn Wooden had announced his retirement from active basketball coaching in 1975 after 27 years with UCLA. His 40-year record of 905 wins and 203 losses is considered the winningest record in basketball history.\n\nIt is a record that brackets ten NCAA championships in his last 12 seasons, 38 straight NCAA tournament victories, an all-time NCAA consecutive-win streak of 88 in a row over four seasons, and 16 conference championships. All this was part of his years at UCLA. It came like this: the last 15 games of 1970-71, all 30 games in 1971-72, all 30 in 1972-73, and 13 games of 1973-74 before the spell was broken. Spell? Wasn’t he known as the Wizard of Westwood?\n\nHe remains the only person inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. At Purdue, he was a three-year All-American, captain of the 1932 national championship team, 1932 Helms Foundation player of the year and a Helms All-Time All-American selection.\n\nThe National Association of Basketball Writers named him Coach of the Year six times. Sporting News named him “Man of the Year” in 1970. Sports Illustrated called him “Sportsman of the Year” for 1973.\n\nHe was named California Father of the Year in 1964 and again in 1975. He received the Whitney Young Award of the Urban League in 1973, was the first recipient of the annual Velvet Covered Brick Award of the Layman’s Leadership Institute in 1974 and was the first recipient of the annual Dr. Naismith Peach Basket Award in 1974. He received the Bellarmine College medal of excellence in 1987.\n\nHe published two books: Practical Modern Basketball (1966) and They Call Me Coach (1972). He regularly contributes to professional journals and maintains a heavy schedule of clinics, workshops and inspirational talks. They all stress teamwork, discipline, conditioning, fundamentals, respect and self-respect.\n\nWooden was born in Martinsville, Ind., on October 14, 1910.\n\nFollowing graduation from Purdue, he was teacher and coach of all sports at Dayton (Ky.) High School. Two years later, he moved to South Bend (Ind.) Central to teach English and coach basketball, baseball and tennis. With a wartime break as a Navy lieutenant 1943-46, he became athletic director and basketball-baseball coach at Indiana State Teachers College, now Indiana State University. In his two years there, before moving on to UCLA, he completed a master’s degree.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nCarl Adolph Kroch, Cornell ’35\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 10\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on February 29, 1988\n\nVersatile as his achievements and eclectic in his tastes, Carl Kroch is a long way from being just the bookseller on whose acumen his fame is based.\n\nOne of this nation’s foremost dealers in fine books, he could have earned an Oxford Cup merely as a host to booklovers, and the booklovers you will find in his stores will have come from all over the world. With bookstores named Kroch’s or Kroch’s & Brentano’s since Cornell graduation, from a Lake Shore Drive address and a Wabash location in Chicago, he also manages interests as a partner in the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Team, as president of the Booksellers Catalogue Service, Inc., and as a member of the boards of directors of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the Illinois Humane Society, Western-Southern Life Insurance Company and the USO. He is a presidential councilor of Cornell.\n\nBorn in Chicago on June 21, 1914, he joined Kroch’s Bookstores, Inc., founded by his father, in 1935 and became its president in 1949. He added presidency of Brentano’s Bookstores, Inc., in 1950 and from 1954 until 1986 was president and a director of the combined Kroch’s & Brentano’s, inc., Chicago. He then was chairman and CEO 1986-93 and became chairman emeritus in 1994. Along the way, the establishment grew from a fine store in Chicago’s Loop to sumptuous branches across the United States.\n\nWilliam Harrison Fetridge, Northwestern ’29, in an article in the Fall 1980 issue of The Beta Theta Pi, termed it a company with 18 stores and more to come. The store at 29 South Wabash was called the world’s largest bookstore, stocking 90,000 titles. It had been three stores when he assumed responsibility for expansion in 1935. It was listed for 30 outlets by 1987, a year after he committed one million dollars to endow the position of University Librarian at Cornell. Furthermore, in 1992, Cornell opened the Carl A. Kroch Library in honor of its benefactor. The three-story, 97,000 square-foot repository has room for 1.3 million volumes.\n\nBrother Kroch had turned down a buyout offer because of the reshuffling and layoffs he felt would befall his loyal staff. To prevent takeovers, he and his wife Jeanette, who owned all of the Kroch’s and Brentano’s stock, sold half of it to a stock plan owned by the employees. The other half was scheduled to be sold to the plan over five years. He remained as chairman and trustee of the stock fund but relinquished day-to-day control to a long-time associate, William J. McCar- thy. Also, in 1986, he was recognized as “The Hero of the Book” by The Center for the Book in the Library of Congress, the first bookseller so honored. Previous honorees included Ray Eames, Richard Rodgers, Margaret Mead, Archibald MacLeish, Charles A. Lindbergh and Alfred A. Knopf.\n\nHe is the author of American Booksellers and Publishers: A Personal Perspective published 1981. In World War II, he became a Naval Reserve lieutenant as an engineering officer aboard the destroyer Osterhaus for 23 months in the South Pacific. His memberships include the American Booksellers Association, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, the Better Business Bureau of Chicago and the Wine and Food Society.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJohn Josiah Robinette, Toronto ’26 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 11\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 3, 1988\n\nGeneral acknowledgment that John J. Robinette has been Canada’s premier legal authority may be the reason a rigid rule was broken, or at least significantly bent, when his Oxford Cup was presented at the 149th General Convention at Toronto’s Inn on the Park, August 4, 1988.\n\nFrom the inauguration of this award, there was a policy that the Cup can be presented only if the recipient is present to receive it. The Cup has been taken to some site other than a General Convention a few times. Some dignitaries other than Beta’s President have been authorized to make the presentation for various reasons. But acceptance by proxy? Never! Well, so far, only this once.\n\nJ.J. had agreed to be present to receive the Cup. On the evening of the banquet, his daughter Dale was there in his place reporting that much as it disappointed him, he was too ill to attend. She regretted this, too, for she agreed that he met the spirit of the award, having won much acclaim, that he had received other awards of prestige and that he was considered Canada’s best-known lawyer. Too, this was Canadian ground, and this famed Canadian barrister seemed to be the logical guest of honor, only the third Canadian selected out of seven. So the law was circumvented for the sake of homage to the law.\n\nBorn in 1906 and raised in Toronto, J.J. entered the University of Toronto and was initiated into the Theta Zeta chapter the same year. He was selected as the Gold Medalist in political science on graduation in 1926. On to Osgoode Hall Law School, and at graduation in 1929, he was recognized with the Chancellor Van Koughnet Scholarship. He remained at Osgoode and was a full professor of law until 1932. Nevertheless, he determined to build a law career second to none.\n\nHe argued so many cases before the Canadian Supreme Court that on retirement, he was presented a set of printed case reports of the cases he had argued. Six large volumes! He was appointed King’s Counsel in 1944, elected Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1946, and 1958 appointed treasurer of the same Society, the highest office in the legal profession in Ontario.\n\nHonorary degrees were conferred by Queens University and the Universities of Western Ontario, British Columbia and Toronto. In 1973 he received the Companion of the Order of Canada medal from the Governor-General. He founded the Advocate’s Society and was its first president. He represented Canada in one of the nation’s most important constitutional decisions: approving the repatriation of the Constitution from the Parliament of Great Britain. Moreover, he continued as a loyal and enthusiastic Beta.\n\nWhen the Beta Board of Trustees notified him that he had been selected to receive the Oxford Cup, he had replied quickly in thanks. He was looking forward to receiving it before such an international gathering of Betas. Thus, no matter what constitutional rulings in those six fat volumes might have applied in the matter of a proxy, in this case, his daughter came to express his regrets and to speak eloquently on his life and work.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nDonald Shelton Dawson, Missouri ’32 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 12\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on April 1, 1989\n\nA prominent and popular Washington figure for five decades, General Donald S. Dawson received the Oxford Cup April 1, 1989, at a Beta reception at Tysons, Virginia, in connection with the installation of the new George Mason chapter. Making the presentation on behalf of the Board of Trustees was General Treasurer Bruce M. Lloyd, Brown ’69, Pennsylvania ’77.\n\nBest known as an administrative personnel aid to President Harry S. Truman, the former Air Force general has headed a Bethesda law firm bearing his name and former president of the University of Missouri Alumni Association. He has also been identified prominently with many veterans’ activities and social organizations, notably the Washington Army and Navy Club, established in 1891 and recently refurbished.\n\nA track star and senior honor society president at Missouri, Dawson went to George Washington University Law School, got his Juris Doctor degree in 1938, and served as assistant to Federal Loan Administrator Jesse H. Jones for the next five years. He then entered the Army. He has been the first Officer Candidate School graduate to become a general. He served in each war theatre in World War II, eventually retiring as a major general with decorations including the Distinguished Service Medal. He became director of security and law enforcement for the U.S. Air Force and later national president of the Reserve Officers Association.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1953, he was Special Executive Assistant to President Truman, responsible for all Presidential appointments and in charge of all management personnel activities of the Executive Branch. Eventually, he became director of the Harry S. Truman Library Institute. The University of Missouri conferred its Faculty-Alumni Award upon him, plus an honorary degree. He had delivered a commencement address for the University.\n\nIn addition to being chairman of the board of trustees of the Reserve Officers Association and current president of the Army and Navy Club, Dawson is longtime executive vice president and chairman of the Washington P. T. Barnum tent of the Saints and Sinners Club.\n\nHe was president of the distinguished Washington Army and Navy Club following its four-year renovation, with rededication by President Ronald Reagan. Dawson is listed as the 77th president of the Military Town Club, founded in 1885 as the University Service Club but reincorporated under its present name in 1891. The clubhouse was initially dedicated in 1891 by President Benjamin Harrison, then re-dedicated by President William Howard Taft in 1912 when it moved across the street to its Farragut Square location. Rededication in 1989 by President Reagan thus was at least its third dedication ceremony.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nRichard Green Lugar, Denison ’54 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 13\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 8, 1989\n\nUndoubtedly one of the foremost figures in American public life, Dick Lugar, also stands as the epitome of a man who early saw his role and began preparing for leadership. Consequently, as a United States Senator since 1977, he has been a world leader in international relations and an articulate spokesman for new ideas, with clear-cut concepts of what makes government work. He has been marked for achievement from boyhood with an unerring sense of where the power lies, frequently with a quiet and gentlemanly feel for being that power himself.\n\nAlmost by formula, he became an Eagle Scout, was first in the Class of 1950, voted the year’s Outstanding Male Graduate at Indianapolis Shortridge High School, first in the Class of 1954 at Denison University and a Rhodes Scholar in Pembroke College of Oxford University receiving its master’s degree with honors.\n\nEach entry in the record virtually demands being recorded with “of course.” So when he moved on to Navy Reserve service after Oxford, of course, he drew assignment as intelligence briefing officer, and of course, that was on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke. Furthermore, of course, he became a member of the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners 1964-67, Mayor of Indianapolis 1968-75, with a revolutionary new city-county form of government as a result, and then a visiting professorship in political science at the University of Indianapolis while he got ducks in a row to run for the Senate.\n\nIt should be noted that Dick also was Denison’s student body co-president. He married the other co-president, Charlene Smeltzer, two years after graduation, and they have four sons: Mark, Robert, John and David.\n\nFew were surprised by his announcement in 1995 that he was starting a bid for the 1996 Republican nomination for President and that he had some fresh ideas for a platform. Nor was it really news that some Washington Betas unveiled Betas for Lugar, complete with campaign buttons. When he had come out with a book in 1988, it had been Letters to the Next President.\n\nHe has been chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, member of the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry, Banking and Housing & Urban Affairs Committee and chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nHe was President of the National League of Cities, 1970-71; delegate and resolutions committee member at the 1968 National Republican Convention; keynote speaker, 1972; delegate and speaker, 1980; and a member of the Institute for International Studies, a Trustee of Denison University and the University of Indianapolis, and on the Boards of the National Endowment for Democracy, the American Running and Fitness Association and Youth for Understanding.\n\nHe has been the main speaker at several Beta events and shared a panel discussion of career selection at the Sesquicentennial Convention.\n\nDick’s undergraduate memberships included Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Blue Key, Pi Delta Epsilon and Pi Sigma Alpha. He is a Methodist and a Rotarian.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nGlen Arthur Holden, Oregon ’51 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 14\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on February 29, 1988\n\nHailed for achievements ranging from managing a $6 billion insurance group to a U.S. Ambassadorship, Glen Holden came from Jamaica to receive his Oxford Cup at the 1990 General Convention at Palm Desert, Calif.\n\nAside from business and government roles, he was cited for having headed his chapter’s house corporation, been chairman of a successful renovation fund drive and been a generous supporter of the General Fraternity. As an undergraduate, he was chapter president and Convention delegate.\n\nIn November 1992, he was among five men honored for outstanding service to Jamaica at the 11th annual Charity Gala of American Friends of Jamaica at New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel. These awards were presented by an earlier Oxford Cup recipient, Maj. Gen. Donald S. Dawson, USAF (Ret.), Missouri ’30.\n\nGlen was founder, chairman and CEO of The Holden Group, a Los Angeles insurance company complex with more than six billion in life insurance. He was named Ambassador to Jamaica in 1989 by President George Bush.\n\nHolden started a career in insurance from graduation. Starting as an agent, he soon had his own general life insurance agency spreading to three states. In 1964 the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, known as VALIC, brought him to Washington to be its marketing director. Becoming VALIC’s president in a short time, he has been credited with being the pioneer who led many major life companies into variable annuities and other equity products to meet the competition of other financial markets. He sold VALIC and in 1973 formed Security First Group with headquarters in Los Angeles.\n\nPioneering the sale of insurance products through significant stock brokerage firms, he issued the first “interest sensitive” life insurance producers in the country. The business expanded under The Holden Group, and by 1990 it encompassed 11 separate financial companies. Its two wholly-owned life insurance companies had more than 4,000 government contracts across the country and provided similar services to public employees in many states.\n\nAn Oregon native raised on a ranch near Portland developed a love for horses, earned spending money caring for them, and developed a strong enthusiasm for polo. He won the prestigious Pacific Coast Open and competed in the semi-finals of the U.S. Open. A long-time trustee of the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club, he helped restore its financial condition by guaranteeing its debts.\n\nHe was governor of the U.S. Polo Assn. And a member of Palm Beach Polo and Country Club. He has been on the boards of London Life Insurance and Trilon Corp. of Canada, Los Angeles Council of Boy Scouts, California Chamber of Commerce, California Museum Foundation, Music Center of Los Angeles County, Hugh O’Brien Youth Foundation, University of Oregon Foundation and a regent of Pepperdine College. He is past chairman of American Humanics.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJamie Lloyd Whitten, Mississippi ’33 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 15\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on October 17, 1991\n\nThe term “career public servant” is the most appropriate label for the Honorable Jamie L. Whitten, who served a record 53 years in the United States House of Representatives. In the latter years of his tenure, he was known as “the Dean of the House.”\n\nOne obituary characterized him as having exerted “quiet but powerful control over the nation’s purse strings.” At one time, Betas had key appropriations positions in both Chambers: Whitten as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was responsible for every funding bill that came out of the House, and Senator Mark Hatfield, Willamette ’43, was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nWhen Whitten obtained his law degree from the University of Mississippi, he was admitted to the state bar with the highest average in 1932.\n\nHe was a 20-year-old public school principal when he was first elected to public office as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1931, at age 21. He next was elected district attorney at 23 and continued in that office for three terms until elected to Congress in 1941. He continuously represented the First Mississippi District from the 77th through the 103rd Congresses. He was chairman of the appropriations committee’s subcommittee for agricultural affairs except for the last term in that series.\n\nBorn in Cascilla, Mississippi, on April 18, 1910, he maintained a home in Charleston, Mississippi, through those years. He authored a book, That We May Live, written after sponsoring an official investigation into chemicals and chemical pesticides. He retired in 1994, having served under 11 Presidents.\n\nA Mason and a Democrat also hold membership in Phi Alpha Delta, unique in that it is the only law fraternity whose roots were nurtured in a legal controversy. That fraternity names each of its chapters after some distinguished legal figure. Its University of Mississippi chapter, established in his junior year, was named for a Beta Supreme Court Justice, Joseph Rucker Lamar, Bethany 1877 and Washington and Lee 1878. Lamar had been General Secretary of Beta Theta Pi as a student in 1877-78.\n\nWhitten was one of the members of an honorary cabinet chosen for the Beta Sesquicentennial Campaign in 1989.\n\nHe died September 9, 1995, in Jackson, Mississippi, at age 85 from chronic cardiac and renal disease complications.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nSamuel Moore Walton, Missouri ’40 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 16\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on January 1, 1991\n\nThe man whom Fortune magazine headlined as “America’s Master Merchandiser,” Sam Walton, rarely procrastinated and seldom was even behind schedule. However, he was about seven years late in receiving his Oxford Cup.\n\nWhen the Beta Board of Trustees introduced this way of recognizing Betas who had risen to the very pinnacle of their profession, one of the first selected was Sam Walton, who had created the Wal-Mart chain and with it emerged to be hailed by The Wall Street Journal as “one of the most influential retailers of this century.” They scheduled a presentation for the 1985 Beta Convention. Some Wal-Mart emergencies interfered.\n\nRepeatedly, a new presentation date would be scheduled and postponed. Eventually, the board delegated Past President Burton W. Folsom, Nebraska ’49, to deliver the award whenever and wherever Walton would stand still long enough to receive it, and to heck with a ceremony.\n\nUltimately a presentation was scheduled for October 7, 1991, at the Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Again something came up. Beta magazine Editor John R. McClung, Jr., described the outcome in the Winter 1992 issue: “The ceremony, therefore, turned out to be a breakfast and presentation at the local Day’s Inn. Complete with apologies for the roadblocks thrown in the way, Brother Walton gave assurances he was truly flattered… and said the Oxford Cup would be prominently displayed in his office. His only regrets were that the award could not have been made in the presence of Betas from all chapters who could hear his expression of pride.”\n\nThe article noted: “When Sam Walton entered Missouri and pledged Beta in the mid-1930s, he was not much, if any, different than most of his other classmates, lucky to be there in those depression times. Growing up, he (was) the youngest Eagle Scout in Missouri at the time and later, quarterback of the state champion high school football team… You could add student council president and being a pretty fair tennis player.”\n\nAfter graduation, he took a job as a management trainee for J. C. Penny Co. at $85 a month. In 1945, he opened a Ben Franklin store in Newport, Ark, with borrowed money. His brother Bud soon afterward opened another in Versailles, Mo. They increased the number to nine, then opened the first Wal-Mart in 1962. Before 1970, they owned 30 stores under the two names. In greater detail than space allows here, the extraordinary story of the growth of the Wal-Mart chain is told in his book, Sam Walton: Made in America, written by John Huey.\n\nA count in 1992 placed the total at 1,735 Wal-Marts and 212 Sam’s Wholesale Club warehouses. Sales for 1991 totaled almost $44 billion. Stock first issued in 1970 had split nine times. Brother Walton was the nation’s largest retailer.\n\nNevertheless, a combination of hairy-cell leukemia and bone marrow cancer became too much for him. He died at 74 in Little Rock on April 5, 1992.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJohn Ernest Dolibois, Miami ’42 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 17\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 8, 1992\n\nIt is an oversimplification to say simply that John E. Dolibois, Miami ’42, was Miami University’s alumni leader for 34 years and officially its vice president for development and alumni affairs for 14 when he retired to accept President Ronald Reagan’s appointment for four years as Ambassador to Luxembourg. It was the first time any naturalized American had been named ambassador to his native country.\n\nThe Miami University European Study Center in Luxembourg, which he helped make possible in the 1960s, now bears his name.\n\nIn the Beta magazine’s account of the 1939 Beta Theta Pi Centenary in Oxford, you find a picture of three young flagbearers leading a procession up Miami’s Slant Walk. Carrying the American flag in the middle is John Dolibois, one of eight Miami pledges initiated at this Centenary. Later, he was chapter president, and, as\n\nan alumnus, he was chapter counselor and faculty advisor, district chief 1951-57, Convention secretary in 1955 and Scholarship Commissioner 1960-61. He has been a principal speaker at several Beta Conventions and was the director of the Sesquicentenary in 1989.\n\nHis experiences as a U.S. Army intelligence officer interrogating high Nazi officers for war crimes trials evident at the end of World War II make a fascinating story, much of which is captured in his recent book, Pattern of Circles.\n\nJohn is a Phi Beta Kappa and holds Luxembourg’s Grand Cross of the Grand Ducal Order of the Crown of Oak. Miami University conferred its honorary degree Doctor of Public Service on him in 1984. A formal recognition of long and continuous service to the alumni program, formerly known as the Alumni Award, has been re-named the John E. Dolibois Award.\n\nJohn and Winnie Dolibois, Miami classmates who married in their senior year before he left for war service, have three sons: Robert J. Dolibois, Miami ’69, is vice president of the National Association of Life Underwriters in Washington, D.C. Dr. John M. Dolibois, Miami ’66, is an orthopedic surgeon in the Oxford-Hamilton area. Special computer facilities at the John Dolibois Study Center in Luxembourg were created with funds contributed in memory of Brian Dolibois, the youngest son. He was a business executive and a talented musician.\n\nJohn’s 50 years in Boy Scouting include being vice president of the Dan Beard Council in Cincinnati and recipient of the Silver Beaver and Distinguished Eagle Scout awards.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nHarold Swanson Hook, Missouri ’53 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 18\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 8, 1992\n\nThere was little doubt that Harold S. Hook, Missouri ’53, had a well-defined Beta path to follow. He was preceded in the Fraternity by his older brothers: Ralph C. Hook, Jr., Missouri ’47; Oliver F. Hook, Missouri ’48; and James E. Hook, Missouri ’52.\n\nRalph is a prolific author who has been Dean and Marketing Department chairman of the University of Hawaii School of Business and Hawaii Beta of the Year. Oliver is vice president of Kidder Peabody Company. Jim is president of the Hook Brothers Co. and co-owner and executive vice president of Dunlap Mfg. Co.\n\nAll that was left for Harold was to put together one of the world’s largest corporations in insurance and finance, American General Corporation. He also created Main Event Management, a management training system utilizing Model-Netics, and served two years as president of the three-million member Boy Scouts of America.\n\nHarold’s Beta service included alumni secretary, new member educator, president and 1952 Convention delegate for the Zeta Phi chapter. He was chief of District XX, 1960- 61; Convention president, 1968; trustee and vice president, 1969-72, and currently serves on the Beta Foundation Board of Directors.\n\nHe and his wife, the former Joanne Hunt, a Missouri Pi Beta Phi, live in Houston, Texas. They have two Beta sons: Thomas W. Hook, Miami ’81, and Randall T. Hook, Westminster ’83, and a daughter, Karen.\n\nHarold, who earned a master’s degree in accounting from Missouri and did postgraduate work in a Ph.D. program at New York University, started on the business administration faculty at Missouri. However, at 30, he had become the insurance industry’s youngest president. At 31, he became president of four successively large insurance organizations. In 1978, he became chairman and CEO of American General, one of the nation’s largest consumer finance service organizations, with $36 billion in assets and more than 18,000 employees.\n\nScouting honored him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout, Silver Beaver and Silver Antelope awards. He received honorary degrees from Missouri and Westminster College. He was 1969 Delta Sigma Pi business fraternity’s Man of the Year; 1984 Texas Business Executive of the Year by Texas A&M College of Business, and 1984 Houston Businessman of the Year by Stanford Business School.\n\nOn active duty with the Navy, 1954-57, he achieved the rank of Lt.Commander. Later, he was a founder-member of the Naval War College Foundation.\n\nDirector of several corporations, he also is a trustee of Baylor College of Medicine, on the Council of Overseers of Rice University’s Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Administration, and on the boards of Texas Research League, Houston Society for the Performing Arts, the Texas Medical Center and the Greater Houston Partnership.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nJohn Jacob Rhodes, Kansas State ’38 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 19\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 4, 1993\n\nThe Honorable John J. Rhodes, Kansas State ’38, is no stranger to alumni and undergraduates alike in Beta Theta Pi. His life has reflected all we portray in our magazine and public discussion under the banner “Worthy of the Highest.” Indeed, he personifies that concept.\n\nA native of Council Grove, Kansas, he was president and Convention delegate from his chapter, later serving as vice president and then president of the General Fraternity.\n\nA graduate of Harvard Law School, John retired from active military service after World War II as a Lt. Colonel and from the reserves as a full colonel.\n\nThe first Republican Congressman ever elected by Arizona in 1952, he served for 30 years. In all, he served 15 consecutive terms, the most extended House of Representatives’ tenure in Arizona’s history.\n\nWhen Gerald Ford became Vice President in 1973, John succeeded him as House Minority Leader, a post he held for ten years. He chaired the Republican Platform Committee in 1972 and was the party’s Permanent Convention Chairman in 1976 and again in 1980.\n\nPrior to his election to the top Republican Leadership post, he served as chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee for nine years. He is a former member of the Committees on Appropriations, Rules, Education and Labor, and Interior and Insular Affairs. He was permanent chairman of the Republican NationalConventions in 1976 and 1980 and served as chairman of the 1972 convention’s Platform Committee.\n\nJohn is the author of The Futile System, a book about how the legislative process suffered during nearly 40 years of one-party control. His most recent book is I was there, which traces his 30 years in Congress.\n\nPresiding over one of Beta’s liveliest periods in modern history, 1984-87, John was a working president, visiting virtually every Beta chapter, taking part in installations and anniversaries. He later chaired Beta’s Sesquicentennial Fund Campaign and headed the committee which drafted the Beta 2000 goals.\n\nOn May 24, 1942, he married Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Harvey. They have four children and nine grandchildren. Still active in his so-called retirement, he and Betty divide their time between homes in Mesa, Arizona and Washington, D.C., where John continues an active law practice with Hunton & Williams.\n\nThe couple made a lasting gift to the new Foundation and Administrative Office with their endowment of the Beta Fireside Room, which features their portraits.\n\nErv Johnson, Idaho ’53, Editor\n\nBurton W. Folsom, Nebraska ’49 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 20\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 4, 1994\n\nFew men have given their time and resources to Beta Theta Pi as constantly and consistently as Burt Folsom. A Beta for more than 50 years, he was chapter counselor to Alpha Tau, Nebraska chapter, 1958-62; district chief for Iowa and Nebraska, 1962-64; General Treasurer, 1964-67; General Secretary, 1967-71; Alumni Affairs Commissioner, 1975-77; Fund Trustee, 1984-87, and President of the Fraternity, 1987-90.\n\nEven before, he was a crucial person in Lincoln Beta alumni activities and recently was a founder of the Austin (Texas) Beta Club. Between his Beta Board terms and again since the completion of his term as President, he has attended Conventions and addressed Beta gatherings.\n\nBorn March 21, 1925, in Lincoln, Nebr., Burt grew up in that city. On January 13, 1943, as a 17-year-old freshman headed for military service, he became #671 on the role of Alpha Tau. He was the seventh Beta in a Nebraska Folsom line, totaling 11. First was an uncle, then Burt’s father and brothers. The string includes Burt’s son, Thomas L. Folsom, Westminster ’74, plus four cousins and a great-nephew. Burt was initiated with his father’s 1914 badge, and he quickly bestowed in turn upon a fetching Nebraska Alpha Phi, Margaret Reese.\n\nBy May, he had been inducted into the Army. Over the next three years, he earned the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in the European Theater with the 1st Infantry Division. Returning to college and Margaret, he found the Beta chapter closed; he now confesses that Margaret got more of his attention than the inactive Alpha Tau, and she married him in 1946.\n\nBy completing his Bachelor’s degree in 1949, there was the beginning of a family. Back in uniform, 1950-51, the Army had him in its 36th Combat Engineer Group at Camp McCoy, Wisc. There was also a Master’s degree at Indiana University in 1963, as he began his Beta roles as chapter counselor and district chief.\n\nBurt and Margaret’s family includes Burton W. Folsom, Sally Folsom Pavalis, and Thomas L. Folsom, Westminster ’74. They remained in Lincoln until a 1981 merger of Nebraska Central Building & Loan Assn., of which Burt had become CEO. He also was President, Executive Club of Lincoln; chairman, Employee Division, United Way, and President, Country Club of Lincoln. In Westminster Presbyterian Church, he was chairman, Board of Deacons, and Clerk of Session, President and chairman, Westminster Foundation. He is a trustee of the University of Nebraska Foundation. He was a director of Nebraska Savings and Loan League.\n\nIn 1982, the Folsoms moved to Lakeway, Texas, where he was President of the Homeowners Assn., editor of Homeowners News, trustee/treasurer of Lakeway Church, a director of Lakeway Recreation Assn. and the local bank, President of Lakewood Town & Gown, and former Lakeway City Councilman. He claims that he finally caught up with Margaret with three holes-in-one.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nGupton A. Vogt, Westminster ’31 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 21\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on October 29, 1994\n\nThere is only one Gup! That nickname for Gupton A. Vogt, Westminster ’31, has been as distinctive as his long Beta service and leadership record. Initiated into Alpha Delta chapter by Francis W. Shepardson, February 25, 1928 dedication day of a new chapter house, that ceremony may have inspired Gup’s long Beta career and the presidency of the Fraternity.\n\nGup and his wife Grace underwrote the Finance Section of the new building. Moreover, the 1988 Vogt gift of oil portraits of the Beta Founders, of ever honored memory. This collection, by Robert Cloyd, Lexington, Ken., depicts the founders of college-age as Cloyd perceived them after researching portraits from later stages in their lives.\n\nBorn in St. Louis, August 6, 1910, Gup received a Bachelor of Arts from Westminster College in 1931 and an MBA from Harvard in 1933. He spent four years with Brown Shoe Co., then five years with Hess & Culbertson Jewelry Co. World War II meant five years in the Navy, emerging a Lt. Commander.\n\nHe married Grace Schotten of St. Louis, an alumna of Bennett College in Mill Brook, New York, in 1942. After the War, Gup and a partner formed a sales promotion company dealing in premiums, service awards, business gifts and American flags in 1950. By the 1960s, it had become the country’s largest distributor of U.S. flags and a significant gift importer to the wholesale jewelry trade. He also acquired Ad/ Sell Co., a mail advertising and printing company.\n\nGup has been involved in the Beta Alumni Clubs of St. Louis, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He was president of the St. Louis Beta Club, 1947-48, and was its 1967 Honor Guest. A singing cup competition among district chapters at St. Louis Club’s annual dinner bears his name, and when its Armstrong Community Leadership Award was retired in 1982, he assumed its sponsorship.\n\nWith Frank B. Whitbeck, Westminster ’69, and Thane J. Olsby, Westminster ’58, he led Alpha Delta’s 1968 centennial, attracting a record turnout. He edited all chapter publications with chapter contributions, raised funds for a new house wing and renovation and prepared a 1985 chapter directory. He has served on the house corporation board since 1970.\n\nHe was elected Beta’s vice president at the 148th General Convention. At the end of his term, he was elected president at the 151st General Convention, accepting office two days before his 80th birthday.\n\nGup was president of Westminster College Alumni Assn., 1964-66, served on the College Board of Trustees since 1966, chairman 1975-81, and led its successful $6-million fund drive in 1982.

Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nH. Lauren Lewis, South Dakota ’37 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 22\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on October 29, 1994\n\nStrong threads of leadership and legacy are woven into this Beta’s story. His full name on the role of Gamma Alpha is Harry Lauren Lewis; it may have been a long time since he used all of that. Furthermore, you may have found him listed in three classes: initiated as a member of the class of 1937, he was recorded as ’39 on the chapter roster in the Beta magazine for each of the remaining three years. However, we find that he received his Bachelor of Science in 1939. You could do that in South Dakota in the Thirties… if you were brilliant. Anyway, he was #277 on the chapter roll all the way and still is.\n\nHe still is also responsive to call. Chapter treasurer in his junior year, he was in charge of the construction of a new chapter house at Vermillion in 1969. He served the Fraternity as chief of District XXV, 1969-73. As a resident of Laquinta, California, he welcomed the 151st General Convention at Palm Desert to California in the role of Temporary President, his second time as Temporary President, and shortly afterward, he agreed to accept the chairmanship of the Beta Foundation Fund Drive for 1990-91 and to give that critical campaign his full attention immediately.\n\nThree of his sons were initiated as Betas while undergraduates and his fourth son have only recently been initiated. When Lauren relinquished the district chief assignment, he was succeeded for two years by John W. Forney, DePauw ’65. Nevertheless, for 1975-79, there was a new chief: Lauren’s son David L. Lewis, South Dakota ’72, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The others are James T. Lewis, South Dakota ’65, chapter counselor for Gamma Alpha, and Paul Jay Lewis, South Dakota/ Washington University ’73, LaQuinta bank president. Allen Lewis was given honorary activation in 1995. Another recent addition is his grandson Thomas Lewis, South Dakota ’87.\n\nLauren was born in Sioux Falls on July 21, 1915. He practiced law in Washington, D.C., for several years. In 1951, he organized Midwest Coast Transport, Inc. and became its chairman. In 1964, he purchased All-America Transport, Inc., becoming its president. These two companies employed more than 3,000 persons when he sold them and entered the banking business in California and South Dakota.\n\nLauren has been a member of the Board of Regents for South Dakota. He is past president of Associated Motor Carriers, Inc., of South Dakota and president of the Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nHe is chairman of the Dakota Dome of the University of South Dakota, past president of its Foundation, and a Law School Foundation board member. In 1979, he was honored with an L.L.D. (Honorary) by the University of South Dakota.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nMichael Jack Schmidt, Ohio ’71\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 23\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on January 19, 1995\n\nIn more than 2,000 games, spanning 18 years with the Philadelphia Phillies, Michael Jack Schmidt, Ohio ’71, helped lead the team to five division titles, two National League pennants and two World Series. He also claimed individual honors as Most Valuable Player three times, including MVP for the 1980 World Series; he won 10 Gold Gloves and led the league in home runs eight times.\n\nElected to the All-Star team 12 times, he finished his career ranked seventh on the all-time home run list and held 14 major league records, 24 Phillies career records and 11 Phillies season records. He was “1980s Player of the Decade” and was enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995, his first year of eligibility.\n\nMike broadcast games on PRISM after retirement, bringing insight and humor to a behind-the-scenes look at the game. He is a partner and patron of the famous Mike Schmidt’s, a sports Philadelphia cafe whose motif highlights his Phillies career, and “Mike Schmidt’s Philadelphia Hoagies,” bringing the best in “fun food” to the Philadelphia area. Among his endorsements: Nike, Rawlings, Tri-State Chevron- let, Middle Atlantic Milk Marketing, Campbell’s Soup, Lee Jeans, 7-up and Benjamin Moore Paints. Mike assisted in developing and maintaining an ongoing relationship with Gold Bear Sports Management. This organization provides financial management services, advertising endorsements and business opportunities to professional athletes.\n\nMike places the highest priority on his devotion to family, evidenced by his 20-year marriage to Donna and his affection for his children Jessica and Jonathan.\n\nHis willingness to contribute to the community forged new programs for the United Way through corporate contributions for each home run he hit. He carried his program across the country, recruiting athletes in each significant league to set up similar programs, raising more than $1 million locally and $2 million nationwide. He also serves on the Boards of the Major League Baseball Alumni Association, Philadelphia Sports Congress, Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic, and the Ohio University Board of Trustees. He gives time and expertise to the U.S. Baseball Federation as a hitting instructor for Team USA and the U.S. Olympics Team.\n\nIn addition, Mike established the Mike Schmidt Foundation, which provides contributions to various charities. He gives time to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and ALS through his involvement with Phillies Wives Charity. In July 1992, he introduced The Mike Schmidt Pro-Celebrity Challenge, a golf tournament to benefit the Pennsylvania Special Olympics. This event broke new ground in the ever-expanding ways that Mike has found to keep children and the children’s charities at the forefront of his life.\n\nMichael Jack Schmidt: yesterday’s idol, today’s example, tomorrow’s legend.\n\nErv Johnson, Idaho ’53, Editor\n\nJames Grubbs Martin, Davidson ’57\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 24\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 3, 1995\n\nLeadership has marked the career of Jim Martin at every turn, and the turns have been conspicuously often and varied. Formal designation as Dr. James Grubbs Martin, though entirely proper, would seem pretentious. It is not how he is best known. He has been Jim Martin as chemist and environmentalist, county commissioner, six-term Congressman 1972-84, president of Beta Theta Pi, Governor of North Carolina 1985-93 and in various other notable capacities.\n\nIdentification by the starchier label has been on the cover of his Ph.D. thesis, Stereochemistry of the DielsAlder Reaction, published in Chemical Reviews in 1961; on the titles of his four patents in the chemistry of butyl rubber vulcanization; on American Chemical Society’s list of Charles Lathrop Parsons awardees for outstanding public service by an American chemist and occasionally in the concert programs of the Charlotte Symphony, in which he has played the tuba.\n\nHe was initiated as #745 on the role of Phi Alpha, the Davidson chapter of Beta Theta Pi, on March 13, 1954. As a faculty member, he was chapter counselor and faculty advisory, 1960-64; chief of District IX, 1963-67; and Convention Secretary in 1965. As a Beta vice president, 1966-69, he helped develop a system of colonization and write a ritual for the installation of new chapters.\n\nIn 1993, he stepped from the Governorship of North Carolina to chairmanship of the Research Development Board of the Carolinas Medical Center at Charlotte, N.C. He is on the University of North Carolina Board of Governors, a trustee of Wake Forest University, chairman of Global Transpark Foundation, Inc., and member of the North Carolina Assn. for Biomedical Research. He also is a board member of Blue Cross Blue Shield, Carolina Freight Corp., Duke Power Co., Entropy, Inc., J. A. Jones, Meadowbrook Healthcare Services and Reprogenesis.\n\nBorn in Savannah, Ga., December 11, 1935, he received his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Davidson in 1957. Receiving a doctor’s degree in chemistry from Princeton in 1960, he taught chemistry at Davidson for the next 12 years. As a Davidson faculty member, he also was a Mecklenburg County Commissioner, 1966-72, and president of North Carolina Assn. of County Commissioners 1970-71.\n\nIn six terms as Congressman from the Sixth District, 1972-84, he was on the House Ways and Means Committee, chairman of the House Republican Research Committee, an opponent of a unilateral freeze on nuclear weapons and a Capitol Hill authority on food additives, environment, health and toxic waste legislation.\n\nWhen elected to his first term as Governor in 1984, he was North Carolina’s 66th governor since statehood, the second Republican elected Governor this century, and the first Republican Governor elected to two consecutive terms.\n\nJim and the former Dorothy Ann McAulay are parents of James, Jr., Emily and Benson Martin. A former Presbyterian deacon, Jim is a 33rd degree Mason, a Shri- ner and a member of the Chowder and Marching Society, with credentials as a choir member, composer and sailor.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nLee B. Thompson, Sr., Oklahoma ’25 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 25\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 5, 1995\n\nLee and his twin brother, Ralph Gordon Thompson, were born at Miami, Indian Territory, on March 2, 1902, just 13 years after the Oklahoma Territory was opened for settlement and five years before it gained statehood. In the Beta chapter, founded almost simultaneously with statehood, Lee and Ralph became Numbers 227 and 226, respectively, on the chapter roll. Furthermore, at 92, Lee was still driving 30 miles each spring from Oklahoma City to the campus to present the year’s Outstanding New Member Award.\n\nFrom this and other evidence of loyalty, there was little surprise that Lee made the single most significant gift to building the new Beta Foundation and Administrative Office in Oxford.\n\nHis Beta service included chapter secretary, treasurer and vice president. A Convention delegate in 1925, he was elected a Convention vice president. He was a district chief 1935-42 and president of the 1942 Convention. He was elected vice president and trustee of Beta Theta Pi in 1945. He died on July 22, 1994. His identical twin, Ralph, had died on March 3, 1934.\n\nLee Thompson was student body president at the University of Oklahoma, which gave him its Gold Letzeiser Medal as an outstanding senior man for leadership and scholarship plus its Brown Derby Award as the student who contributed the most to the University at the most significant personal sacrifice. After graduation from the University’s College of Law, he began a law career in Oklahoma City and in 1928 married Elaine Bizzell, daughter of University of Oklahoma President William B. Bizzell. They became parents of Lee B. Thompson, Jr., Oklahoma ’54, Enid Okla., a former district chief, Beta vice president and trustee 1976-79; Carolyn Elaine (Mrs. Don T.) Zachritz and Judge Ralph G. Thompson, Oklahoma ’56, and grandparents of Lee B. Thompson III, Oklahoma ’84. Other Beta relatives also have included another brother, the late Wayman J. Thompson, Oklahoma ’27, and a nephew, William Bizzell, Tulane ’49.\n\nAt the University of Oklahoma, he was the first sophomore in its Reserve Officers Training Corps to earn a second lieutenant’s commission. By 1940, he was a captain, then advancing to major in three months. He attended Command and General Staff School and was promoted to full colonel in 1943.\n\nLee was a special justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1967-68. Over the years, he was secretary, general counsel and director of the Mustang Oil Company, deacon and life elder of the First Christian Church of Oklahoma City, a Rotary Paul Harris Fellow and a 33rd degree Mason.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Dean’s Council of the University of Oklahoma College of Law and 1971 recipient of the University’s Distinguished Service Citation, past president of the University’s Memorial Student Union and 1982 recipient of its Greek Alumnus of the Year Award. He also was recognized in 1982 as Phi Beta Kappa of the Year.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nFranklin David Murphy, Kansas ’36 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 26\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on September 24, 1995\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Mo., in 1916, Franklin David Murphy, Kansas ’36, was president of the Alpha Nu chapter in his senior year. He went to Germany on an exchange fellowship at the University of Gottingen for one year. He returned to attend the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, where he received his M.D. in 1941. In World War II, he was a captain in the Army Medical Corps, returning to Kansas City in 1946 to become a practicing cardiologist.\n\nIn 1948, he was appointed Dean of the University of Kansas Medical School at 32. The following year he was named “One of Ten Outstanding Young Men” by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. Three years later, he was appointed Chancellor of the University of Kansas.\n\nHis administration at Kansas was happy but short. Six years later, he became Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles. He improved the UCLA campus beyond measure, planting it with unusual trees, adding 40 new buildings, seeing the student body grow from 20,000 to 30,000 and raising the University to“major scholarly distinction in worldwide terms.”\n\nIn 1968, he became Chairman and CEO of the Los Angeles Times Mirror Group. He oversaw the company’s growth and expansion into new fields. He was a founder of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art at its current site, a trustee of the J. Paul Getty Trust, a trustee of the Ahmanson Foundation, a trustee of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation for more than 40 years, a director of Ford Motor Company and a director of The Bank of America.\n\nHe was chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and on countless other boards, educational, medical and otherwise, where, according to the London England Independent, “his common sense, creative genius and unerring eye for the right person for the job were valued.”\n\nUpon his death at age 78 in Los Angeles on June 16, 1994, he left surviving his beloved wife Judith Harris Murphy, one son and three daughters. Obituaries in the great newspapers of America from Los Angeles to New York praised Murphy as one of the nation’s most distinguished leaders. Nicholas Barker in the London Independent may have said it best:\n\n“Murphy received honors and decorations at home and abroad, among them no less than 17 honorary doctorates… This catalog of distinction, however, gives us no idea of the vitality and individuality of his character… Life to him, with him, was always full of color. His door was open to anyone with a new idea, a hopeful enterprise. He would listen, utter a few warm words, make a short telephone call, and ’lo, the job was done. He was a wonderful talker, as well as a good listener, and no one who heard him will forget the liveliness, the pungent phrases of his conversation. He was not a big man, but he seemed to fill any room with his expressive features and the warmth and magnetism of his personality.”\n\nLyman Field, Kansas ’36\n\nWilliam H. (Bert) Bates, Missouri ’49\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 27\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on January 25, 1996\n\nLeadership in his profession and community, as well as unselfish devotion to his fraternity and alma mater, have characterized four decades of an outstanding career of W. H. (Bert) Bates, Missouri ’49.\n\nBert served as chairman of the Kansas City law firm of Lathrop & Norquist (now Lathrop & Gage) and was formerly chair of its Managing Partner Committee. The former general counsel of the Midwest Gas Users Association and the Chamber of Commerce for a Greater Kansas City, he is a panelist of the Center of Public Resources, Inc., a certified arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association and a former president of the Kansas City Bar Assn. Foundation.\n\nInduction into the Zeta Phi Chapter Wall of Fame in 1994 has followed such recognition as the 1984 Distinguished Non-Alumni Award of the School of Law of the University of Missouri-Columbia; the 1984 Man of the Year Award of the Kansas City Beta Alumni Chapter; and the University of Missouri’s 1990 Distinguished Alumnus Award, both its Presidential Citation and its Geyer Award for Service Public Education in 1991 and its 1992 Distinguished Friend Award.\n\nFormer chairman of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, he was 1985 recipient of its Brotherhood Award, the YMCA’s 1986 Distinguished Service Award and 1988 honoree of Kansas City Tomorrow Celebration of Leadership.\n\nA veteran of World War II Army service, he was initiated as No 981 on the role of the Zeta Phi chapter as the first man in his class on March 13, 1948, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was chapter vice president and attended the 1948 Beta Convention at Mackinac.\n\nAt the University of Michigan School of Law, where he received a Juris Doctor’s degree in 1952, he was the senior editor of the Law Review. After law school, he was a special assistant attorney general of Missouri, followed by five years as secretary and attorney for the Board of Police Commissioners of Kansas City.\n\nHe is past president of the Missouri Bar and a former member of the House of Delegates of the American Bar Assn. He received the Justice Charles Evans Whit- taker Award for Outstanding Service from the Lawyers Assn. of Kansas City and the President’s Citation Pro Bono Award of the Missouri Bar. He has been Missourichairman of Fellows of the American Bar Foundation and an officer and liaison to the executive committee, Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Assn.\n\nPast president of the University of Missouri System Board of Curators, he is a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Kansas City, the Midwest Research Institute. He is chairman of the Trustees of Central United Methodist Church, Kansas City, a Missouri Academy of Squires member, and former chairman of The Hawthorn Foundation’s Board. He also served as chairman of the Missouri State Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, whose Board he served for nearly three decades.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nEdward Maurice Brown, Miami ’31 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 28\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on October 19, 1996\n\nVersatility and dedication, which have characterized Ed Brown’s entire career, also have been factors that brought him back to Oxford for energetic and generous retirement years. These have been years in which he and his wife, the former Anne Amos, Miami and Delta Delta Delta 1932, made significant gifts to the University as well as the Entrance Gates at the Beta Administrative Office.\n\nAs a Miami freshman, he quietly accepted leadership in Alpha’s struggle to regain effectiveness. In February 1928, he became Alpha rush chairman, social chairman, chapter president and 1930 General Convention delegate.\n\nEd earned the academic distinction. Graduating from Harvard Law School on a Rutherford B. Hayes Scholarship, he performed conspicuously in a major law firm, served Beta locally as a district chief and internationally as General Secretary and Vice President/Trustee, helping draft an entirely new administrative pattern for Beta, which included both the creation of a first Administrative Office and the selection of Ralph N. Fey, Miami ’40, as the man to set it up.\n\nIn 1947, he left law practice to become assistant to Marvin Pierce, Miami 1916, president of the McCall Corp., publisher of McCall’s, Redbook and Blue Book, and printer of Reader’s Digest, Newsweek and other magazines. Brown became vice president and assistant secretary of McCall in 1949, vice president and secretary in 1951 and a director in 1953.\n\nIn 1958, Brown joined Sperry Gyroscope Co., initially as treasurer. He became vice president and treasurer in 1958, vice president for administration 1960-65, and vice president of the Sperry Group, 1965-68, with responsibility for five Sperry Components Divisions in Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida and was a director of Gyro’s French and Ottawa companies. He also has been assistant treasurer of Sperry Rand since 1958. He became group executive of Teledyne, Inc., 1968-80, and in 1971 was elected chairman of the board of Teledyne Canada, Ltd. He retired in 1981.\n\nFor more than 25 years, he was a director on the National Center for Disability Services board on Long Island, New York. He served two elective terms, 1961- 65, as a trustee of the Village of Pelham Manor, N.Y, for which he was cited “for a long list of his accomplishments during his administration.”\n\nWhen Miami’s School of Business Administration inaugurated its Business Advisory Council in 1969, he was named one of the first business executives. In 1972 Miami conferred its honorary degree Doctor of Laws upon him.\n\nThe Browns moved to Oxford in 1979. Family visitors to their home in Shadowy Hills include two sons, Edward Dustin Brown and Ernest Amos Brown, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nDr. Edward Bunker Taylor, Auburn/Davidson ’42 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 29\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on November 19, 1996\n\nHonored by members of the Delta Zeta chapter (Auburn) as “our founder, advisor and most active brother,” Ed Taylor also enjoys the distinction of holding the same roll number in two chapters. A native of Southport, S.C., in Beta’s 100th year, he was initiated No 452 on the Davidson roll.\n\nOn November 18, 1958, several Auburn students were invited to Brother Taylor’s home to hear Dr. Seth R. Brooks, St. Lawrence ’22, on his first visit to Auburn. This led to the formation of The Beta Pi Club, later to become the Beta Pi colony. Approval of a charter was at the 1964 Convention, and installation of the Delta Zeta chapter with 41 charter members was on November 19, 1964. Many triumphs of this group have been credited to Founder Taylor’s leadership as chapter counselor, faculty advisor and president of the house corporation. On January 11, 1985, as numbers 448 through 451 were initiated, the ritual was interrupted to insert Dr. Taylor as No 452, then resumed for numbers 453 through 457.\n\nAuburn, a perennially outstanding chapter and winner of a Sisson award every year since the award’s introduction, has named the newly completed chapter hall- pavilion addition in his honor. At the 1997 General Convention in Washington, DC, Delta Zeta became one of the first two chapters to qualify for the distinguished John Reily Knox award signifying the most outstanding chapters in the entire Fraternity.\n\nA graduate in history and later textile management, he received a master of arts degree in vocational guidance from Columbia and a Ph.D. from Nebraska in adult education. He was Auburn’s advisor to fraternities and student affairs for 25 years after being an assistant professor of textiles 1957-63 and assistant director of engineering extension 1963-66.\n\nEd and the former Helen Bryson married in 1950 and have two daughters, Dr. Betsy Nance and Nancy Lloyd, a teacher. Both live in Richmond, Va. A Methodist Sunday School teacher and coordinator of lay speaking for his area since 1970, Ed has held numerous denominational leadership positions.\n\nHe is a retired Army Reserve colonel. His three years of World War II Army Air Corps active duty included Okinawa and Japan. He holds the Distinguished Service Medal, Award of Meritorious Service Medal and three battle stars. He received the honorary Golden Eagle Award of the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame in 1990, was president of the Faculty Club of Auburn University in 1970 and was a member of the Governor’s Commission on Physical Fitness.\n\nBrother Taylor has been a member and officer in many professional, honorary, college and civic organizations. Having served as State Director for Alabama in the American Association of Retired Persons for five years, he is currently the State Training Coordinator for AARP in Alabama.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nDr. Hugh Edward Stephenson, Jr., Missouri ’43 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 30\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on August 8, 1997\n\nHugh Stephenson has built Beta Theta Pi and its Zeta Phi chapter a legacy of dedication, devotion and sensitivity. Many say his practice of these attributes has been daily. A distinguished cardiothoracic surgeon developer of the first resuscitation unit, also known as the defibrillator, he is credited with leadership to establish a four-year medical school at the University of Missouri, Columbia. Significant in this fight was his persistent lobbying of state legislators; his performance at the 1951 hearing to establish Columbia, rather than Kansas City, as the site of Missouri’s first state-funded medical school.\n\nHe was Beta Theta Pi General Fraternity president, 1978-81, after serving as vice president 1973-76. He had been a district chief 1967-73. Along the way, he also had been chapter counselor, a house corporation board member, chairman of the fund-raising campaign for a new chapter house and currently serves as faculty advisor. A significant addition to the Zeta Phi chapter house has been named the Hugh E. Stephenson, Jr. Annex.\n\nHugh Stephenson became a member of the faculty of the University of Missouri School of Medicine at Columbia in 1953. He received a professorship in surgery in 1956 and was chairman of the department of surgery 1956-60.\n\nIn 1956 he also was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in the Nation. This also was a period for which he was appointed a Markle Scholar in Academic Medicine. In 1962 he visited all of the medical schools in the United Kingdom as a Surgical Traveler of the James IV Associates of Surgery.\n\nHe was then chief of the Missouri school’s division of general surgery 1976-87 and chief of staff 1982-94. He was named John Growdon Distinguished Professor emeritus in 1987. He was named interim dean in 1988-89, associate dean 1989-92 and distinguished professor of surgery emeritus in 1993. He is past president of the Missouri State Surgical Society.\n\nWinning the four-year designation for the medical school resulted in an open-heart program. It made Missouri’s hospital one of only 20 facilities in the entire country where surgical heart procedures were taking place. Partly as a result of this, Hugh Stephenson is author of Immediate Care of the Acutely Ill and Injured, its second edition in 1974; Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation, its fourth edition in 1975 and, currently, Aesculpapius was a Tiger, an occasionally light-hearted reminded of how the medical school came to be. Alongside these in the John Reily Knox Library at Oxford is Kicks That Count, 1981, a 270-page volume on the finer points of placekicking a football.\n\nHe has an SMU Beta son Ted, also known as Hugh Edward III; a daughter, a one-time professional tennis player, and their mother Sally Dickinson Stephenson, who has logged some 25 Beta Conventions herself.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nStephen Davidson Bechtel, Jr., Purdue/Colorado ’47 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 31\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on October 20, 1997\n\nStephen D. Bechtel, Jr., Colorado ’47, joins his father, eminent builder and financier, as the first father-son pair to hold this honor. The father, Stephen D. Bechtel, California ’23, received his Cup on April 28, 1987.\n\nThe son was accorded the same honor at age 72 as Chairman Emeritus of Bechtel Group, Inc., engineers and constructors. He is Chairman Emeritus of The Fremont Group and Sequoia Ventures, Inc., separate affiliated companies that manage and operate in marketable securities, natural resources and other selected investments.\n\nBorn May 10, 1925, in Oakland, Calif., he was initiated into Beta Theta Pi on November 21, 1943, as No 748 on the role of Colorado chapter. Completing his B.S. degree in civil engineering at Purdue in 1946 following World War II Marine Corps service, he married Elizabeth Hogan on June 5, 1946. They have three daughters, two sons and 16 grandchildren. He received his master’s in business administration from Stanford University Graduate School of Business in 1948.\n\nHonored by Colorado, Purdue, Stanford, many learned societies and four Presidents of the United States, he has been asked for advice in national and international projects ranging from urban housing and pollution control to major conferences on productivity and wage standards.\n\nAn Honorary Fellow of the U.K.’s Institution of Chemical Engineers and a Foreign Member of its Royal Academy of Engineering, he also is an Officer of the French Legion of Honor and a Director and Life Member of the American Society of the French Legion of Honor. In 1994, he received the Distinguished Achievement Medal of the American Society of the French Legion of Honor.\n\nSome of these honors are diverse. In 1979 the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) cited “his skill, enterprise and foresight in managing one of the world’s largest civil engineering projects: the Jubail Industrial Complex in Saudi Arabia.” This was followed by the 1980 Herbert Hoover Medal, the 1982 Chairman’s Award from the American Association of Engineering Societies, and the ASCE 1985 Washington Award. That same year, seven national engineering societies awarded him the 1985 Washington Award for “his skillful, foresighted and efficient leadership in construction engineering.”\n\nIn 1991 President Bush awarded him the National Medal of Technology, the high- est American honor bestowed for technical achievement, in recognition of outstanding leadership in the engineering profession and for developing and applying ad- advanced management techniques to world-class industrial projects.\n\nWith it all, his interests and hobbies include golf, tennis, bird shooting, fly-fishing, cross-country skiing, hiking, horseback riding, photography, dog training and field trials.\n\nRobert T. Howard, DePauw ’37, Historian\n\nMark Odom Hatfield, Willamette ’43 (Deceased)\n\nOxford Cup Roll Number: 32\n\nAwarded the Oxford Cup on April 30, 1998\n\nIn service to the Fraternity and the broader community, few have been more distinguished than Mark Hatfield. Nevertheless, as U.S. Senator from Oregon in 1985, having been a chapter founder, president of both the petitioning local and the chapter, a Navy combat officer, a Beta district chief, a State Representative, State Senator, Secretary of State, and Governor, he could say, “One of the truly great experiences of my life was to be a part of the Kappa Gamma Rho team from Willamette University to carry the petition for a charter to the 116th Convention.”\n\nIt is said that Hatfield has never lost an election. Retired to private life at age 74 after five terms in the U.S. Senate, he maintains an office in Portland, Ore. He serves as a guest lecturer at Willamette, George Fox and Portland State Universities.
