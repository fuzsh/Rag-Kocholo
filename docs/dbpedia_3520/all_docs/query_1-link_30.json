        "text": "From her stirring poetry to her timeless wisdom on love, loss, and creativity, beloved poet and feminist Adrienne Rich (May 16, 1929–March 27, 2012) endures as one of the most celebrated poets of the twentieth century, a remarkable woman of equal parts literary flair and political might. In a monumental manifestation of both, when Rich was awarded prestigious National Medal of Arts in 1997 — the highest honor bestowed upon an individual artist on behalf of the people of the United States — she famously became the first (and still only) person to decline the honor in a protest against the monopoly of power and the government’s proposed plan to end funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nBut Rich was also a masterful writer of prose at the intersection of the philosophical, the political, and the deeply personal. In her essay titled “Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying,” originally read at the Hartwick Women Writers’ Workshop in June of 1975 and eventually included in the altogether fantastic anthology On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose 1966-1978 (public library), Rich adds to history’s finest definitions of love with eloquence that resonates with particularly poignant beauty in these days of historic change for the freedom and dignity of love:\n\nAn honorable human relationship — that is, one in which two people have the right to use the word “love” — is a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other.\n\nIt is important to do this because it breaks down human self-delusion and isolation.\n\nIt is important to do this because in doing so we do justice to our own complexity.\n\nIt is important to do this because we can count on so few people to go that hard way with us.\n\nHow beautifully this lends itself to paraphrasing Rich’s memorable words from two decades later — “I don’t think we can separate art from overall human dignity and hope” — to “I don’t think we can separate love from overall human dignity and hope.”\n\nOn Lies, Secrets, and Silence is indispensable in its entirety. Complement it with Rich on what “truth” really means and her spectacular convocation address on claiming your education.\n\ndonating = loving\n\nEvery month, I spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars keeping The Marginalian going. For seventeen years, it has remained free and ad-free and alive thanks to patronage from readers. I have no staff, no interns, not even an assistant — a thoroughly one-woman labor of love that is also my life and my livelihood. If this labor makes your own life more livable in any way, please consider aiding its sustenance with a one-time or loyal donation. Your support makes all the difference.\n\nMonthly donation\n\n♥ $3 / month\n\n♥ $5 / month\n\n♥ $7 / month\n\n♥ $10 / month\n\n♥ $25 / month\n\nSTART NOW\n\nOne-time donation\n\nYou can also become a spontaneous supporter with a one-time donation in any amount:\n\nGIVE NOW\n\nBITCOIN DONATION\n\nPartial to Bitcoin?
