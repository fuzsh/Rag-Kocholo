        "text": "NEW YORK — Bernard Spitz, 83, retired president of the Henry Hanger Co., died Sunday at his home in Los Angeles.\n\nThe cause of death was cancer, according to his daughter, Nancy Battan, who serves as a vice president at the hanger manufacturer.\n\nSpitz’ father, Henry, formed the company here in 1929, producing the first unbreakable hangers that came with a guarantee in writing to its customers. Still in operation, the firm services the garment industry, retailers and hotels throughout the country.\n\nSpitz started working for the company in sales at the age of 16. When his father passed away in 1965, he and a late brother, Herbert, ran the business.\n\nIn addition to his daughter, Nancy, Spitz is survived by a son, Henry, president of the firm, and three other daughters: Astrid Metsos, who is vice president of the company; Janet Leavitt, and Norma Flaten.\n\nA memorial service will be held Friday at 1 p.m. at Mount Ararat in Farmingdale, N.Y."
