        "text": "The appreciation of a dog breed is probably most clearly shown in how art takes care of it and what sympathy the notabilities of this world show it. The German Spitz is definitely one of the breeds that have been immortalized in art since ancient times and that have found the favor of famous personalities. An image on a wine jug from Athens (400 BC) shows a young man with his Spitz. It can also be found on an Attic grave relief as well as on a mosaic panel in Pompeii or as a terracotta model from ancient Athens. In the Middle Ages it was found at the courts of emperors and kings as well as at the castles of princes and nobles.\n\nThe Tsarina Catherine the Great and her Spitz\n\nYou can do a lot of nonsense with him, as the Russian Empress Catherine II knew when she had a joke with her husband Peter III. performed. At that time, the Emperor of all the Russians had just suppressed an uprising among his nobility in the bud. One of his best friends took part and was sentenced to death as a result.\n\nWho can describe the tsar's astonishment when his favorite Spitz, Lisette, came into the room to present her master in Maul with a petition from the death row prisoner? Since Lisette gave her a nice paw, the tsar was appeased and the false friend kept his life. As soon as this was confirmed, Katharina confessed to her husband that she had trained the clever dog to do this trick. Unfortunately, the tsar didn't find it funny at all, but was annoyed at having fallen for such a cheap prank.\n\nLisette fell out of favor and another Spitz named Henry became the Tsar's favorite because he believed that Henry was a good judge of character. But far from it: Henry was a friendly, open-minded Spitz, a so-called \"everyone's friend\" and this time too, his favorite Spitz was used to manipulate the tsar. So Henry was brought together with a supplicant whom he was supposed to woo. Since this acquaintance was made with a hot sausage, it goes without saying that Henry would later become extremely fond of this gift.\n\nThe people sitting there took this statement very seriously because they believed that the doctor from Wittenberg was fundamentally speaking against animals in heaven. In reality, this word was just a friendly reminder to Belferlein to take some precautions. Luther enjoyed talking to his Spitz in detail, as many dog lovers still do today. And don't worry: dogs also go to heaven - at least according to Luther's opinion:\n\n\"I believe that also the Belferlein\n\nand all doggies go to heaven\n\nand every creature has an immortal soul.\"\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nwas one of the greatest and most brilliant composers in the world, and caused a stir at the age of six with his piano playing and his own compositions. Through strict discipline and tireless work, Mozart developed his gifted talent to full artistic maturity. In his free time he devoted himself to his Spitz “Bimperl”. Mozart's Spitz howled loudly during his compositions.\n\nMozart firmly believed that his beloved Spitz would take a keen interest in family life. Mozart asked about Bimperl in many of his letters during his travels. Only when his wife wrote to him that the Spitz had howled miserably while playing various pieces of his master's music did he receive the instruction in the letter: \"If Spitz howls so much again when you play my compositions on the spinet, give him a few good slaps in the face. But for God's sake, don't let him suffer anyway.\"\n\nBimperl got older and older. His master loved him more and more every year. One day he surprised his wife and dog with a composition dedicated to Bimperl. It began:\n\n“You certainly cannot be disloyal.\n\nOh no, oh no, my Spitz!\"\n\nUnfortunately, this song remained unfinished.\n\nNaturalist Newton\n\nThe great researcher, who wrote almost all of his works in the presence of his cat and his Spitz, Diamond, suffered greatly from the dog that liked to eat paper. As soon as his master had left, Diamond began to chew up the manuscripts until not a readable scrap remained. It was far from the case that the naturalist was beating his dog: \"There are two options\" he said in such cases, \"either you acted as your nature dictated, or you are an instrument of higher powers and the work was inadequate. I will begin again.\"\n\nThe poet Jean Paul\n\nThe poet also took his Spitz, who does not seem to have had a special name, very seriously. Now and then he received invitations to meet this or that person, whereupon the poet immediately asked whether his dog had also been invited. If it was clear from the answer that they wanted to do without the dog, the poet didn't come either. However, things became serious when Duke George of Saxe-Meiningen came up with the idea of introducing a general dog ban in the fall of 1802. According to this order, no four-legged friend was allowed to pass through the city gate because there were too many poachers doing nonsense in the area on the royal hunt.\n\nJean Paul sat down and wrote a touching petition for his Spitz, which has the following curious wording: \"Unfortunately, due to some bad poachers, we have all been placed under city arrest. Since we have little sense, I can't write anything up. Therefore, my master made the trouble to make a petition that I can follow him when he goes to Welkershausen or Grimmenthal. I can provide certificates from my principal that I know as little about hunting as he does, and I am always the closest person behind my master's stick. Since you have often had the grace to pet me when you were with him, I hope that I would be allowed to do so in the future to get in front of the city gate.\"\n\nThis begging Spitz, who was bitten and killed by a rampaging dog, wasn't lying. A Spitz knows no more about hunting than a poet. He is almost the only dog that refuses to chase after rabbits, rabbits, and even cats. For him, master and house are completely sufficient for his well-being, and it is said to have happened in many areas that hunting tenants made Spitzes available to the surrounding farms if the farmers undertook to get rid of the existing poaching dogs. A Spitz that stays not at home is not a real Spitz. He is the good housefather among the many dog breeds. But we know that overly well-behaved housefathers occasionally get on your nerves when they want to talk into everything and anything. If a good Fox Terrier gnaws through his leather leash in a very short space of time when he senses a desirable adventure in the distance, for a good Spitz a single word is enough, and he will sit in the same place you assigned him for hours. So it is also the conservative, contemplative citizens who love their kind in Spitz."
