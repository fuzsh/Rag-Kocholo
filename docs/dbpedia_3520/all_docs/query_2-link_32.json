        "text": "Our firm’s founder, Harold T. Spitznagel, gave shape to spaces where people lived, learned, worshiped, worked, played, and healed.\n\n“Spitz” dedicated himself to understanding his clients and their needs. He was a consummate marketer who knew all the businessmen in town, had the ear of decision-makers in government, and counted plenty of friends on college campuses. Together, they created some of the most enduring designs in South Dakota and the surrounding states.\n\nSpitznagel’s designs evolved from streamline modern to a distinctly individual, no-frills style. He recognized the need to integrate form and function, bringing full-time engineers and interior designers into his practice in the early 1950s. Spitz drew inspiration from fine art, scientific pursuits, and cultural discoveries during his numerous international travels. He found equal spark in his relationships with colleagues and clients. A full 90-years later, The Spitznagel Partners — TSP, Inc. — holds to his principle: “Design it like you own it.”\n\nHere, we offer a partial listing of Spitznagel’s personal work as well as the projects designed under his leadership. He retired in June 1972 — 42 years to the month after opening his practice. Spitz died in 1975 and in 2006 was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame.\n\nJune 9, 1930: Spitz establishes his practice in Sioux Falls, as Harold Spitznagel, Architect. His first job is remodeling the front of a bakery, and he takes his fee in the form of baked goods.\n\n1931: E.C. Main residence in Riverview Heights neighborhood, Sioux Falls.\n\n1932: Swimming pool for John Morrell Foster, owner of the meatpacking plant.\n\n1932-34: John Morrell Foster residence, a two-story home.\n\n1932: Wayne Donahue residence, Sioux Falls.\n\n1937: Completes Custer State Park Museum, constructed with federal funds and CCC (Civilian Conservations Corps) labor as part of the New Deal recovery efforts.

Schneider residence, Sioux Falls.\n\n1936-1937: Spitznagel and partner John Schoening design Sylvan Lake Lodge, a departure from the usual “peeled logs” rustic style. Nevertheless, the structure blends into its forested surroundings. Local stone exterior with singled siding laid in a zigzag pattern. Interior knotty pine, leather furniture, and open trusses in the main lounge with its plank floors and historical references through the use of Native American motifs. Relief sculpture by Palmer Eide. The commission helps establish Spitznagel as a prominent professional.\n\n1936: Ruth and B. Harietta Bach residence, Sioux Falls.\n\n1936: George Rice residence, Flandreau.\n\n1936: Lyle Olson residence, Sioux Falls.\n\n1936: Dr. C.P.

A curving staircase and the novelty of fluorescent light fixtures add to the building’s character.\n\n1939: Irving School completed at 11th Street and Spring Avenue, Sioux Falls. The two-story building discarded the neoclassical-revival theme prominent in institutional designs and instead used a patterned tan brick, large windows for natural light in classrooms, and streamlined moderne touches (use of glass block framing doorways, sleek stairways molded in terrazzo).
