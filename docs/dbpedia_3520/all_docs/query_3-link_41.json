        "text": "Generally when an author has a singular style, it can make adapting their work a bit difficult. One such author is Dr. Seuss – although the cartoon adaptations are very good, the live action ones, not so. The same goes for Roald Dahl – his grotesque worldview doesn’t always translate very well on the screen, either leading to something too scary or too ridiculous. Saying that his adult short fiction has managed to escape this problem – Hitchcock did a good job , the stories adaptations had evolved into a nine season television and even Tarantino managed to squiggle a story in Four Rooms.\n\nWhich leads us to another director who has an equally distinctive style: Wes Anderson. Although not his first time adapting Dahl – he directed a version of Fantastic Mr. Fox , a film I have grown to appreciate over the years, he does seem to be the right person for the job. The thing is that I have found his last two films disappointing so I was wondering if he would offer anything new. Before we get into that, a brief description of the stories.\n\nThe Stories\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is one of the more well known ones as it was packaged as part of a six story anthology for 12/13 year old, thus when one moved on from the children’s books the could start exploring the adult fiction. It piece features a greedy millionaire who discovers the art of looking with his eyes closed and then uses this talent for other means. It’s a strong story and features a book within a book within a book within a book technique which Dahl pulls off very well.\n\nThe Swan, also included in the Henry Sugar collection is about a boy who is physically bullied by two older boy, a gruelling story about inner strength and determination. This could probably one of the best ones he’s written due to the tense atmosphere which builds up.\n\nThe Ratcatcher – This one is from Someone Like You and forms part of the Claude’s Dog pentalogy. It involves the titular character who knows his subjects a little too well, climaxing in one of Dahl’s more gross endings.\n\nPoison is a tense satire taking place in India with a person who thinks he’s got a snake on his belly. Although Dahl was known as a racist, this story does prove that Dahl hated colonisation as well.\n\nThe Films\n\nAs I said I’ve become disappointed with Wes Anderson’s films lately. To a certain extent he’s becoming a parody of himself and seems to be afraid of trying anything new. Or, at least we get glimpses, one such example is the meta sub sub plot in Asteroid City, where the whole film is played out like a theatre production. Personally if the there were more meta elements like that I would have applauded Wes Anderson’s attempts at challenging himself.\n\nThankfully these four short films do deviate mostly from the Anderson formula. For starters the WHOLE story is narrated by various characters – I mean actually standing there and telling the story verbatim while action is happening in the background. It works. Not only that it’s oddly captivating.\n\nThe theatre production element is in full as well from the basic background scenery changes to the minimal special effects – In The Swan a train is approaching so the main protagonist holds up a piece of paper with a train sketch on it accompanied by locomotive whistles. Granted there are some elaborate moments, especially in Henry Sugar but the majority has a minimal approach.\n\nOnce again Anderson’s fascination with stop motion crops up, seen mostly in The Ratcatcher and then the usual traits crop up; the shifting camera, pastel colors and the near choreographed movements. usually I would get bored but since things are being shaken up a bit , I appreciated the trademarks.\n\nThe question is whether this newfound minimalism dilute the wickedness found in Dahl’s adult stories? the answer is no. Anderson manages to keep the unease that one gets when reading Dahl – The Swan will make one emote, The ratcatcher is disturbing, Henry Sugar is still engaging and poison ranks up the tension strongly. Dahl and Anderson are a very strong match and these short films do rank as the better adaptations.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nI’ll definitely for for the stories as they have a bit more bite but the these four stories are good primer for both Dahl and Anderson."
