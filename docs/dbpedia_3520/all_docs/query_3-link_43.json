        "text": "“Protecting the information that customers have entrusted organisations with is one of the key challenges faced by many industries and needs to addressed by well trained, well informed and qualified professionals that have a deep understanding of the issues. The independent Journal of Data Protection & Privacy is a fantastic source of the most up to date thinking and best practise and should be a ‘must read’ for DP professionals….”\n\n“Journal of Brand Strategy combines the latest information from leading academic thinkers together with best practice insights and expertise from branding professionals. Each article is quality controlled with a disciplined peer-review process to insure the Journal’s brand remains professional, credible and relevant. I look forward to each new edition.”\n\n\"Brand strategy and innovation is a dynamic and growing practice of great variety. There is a huge demand for a consolidating publication that brings together the very best from the field. Journal of Brand Strategy is the most essential read today.\"\n\n\"In the age of information overload, it is refreshing to have a publication whose primary purpose is to serve and educate its readership. A publication that is governed by the people in the industry is always the most compelling and the quality of experience leveraged and information gathered is immediately evident. This journal serves as an industry standard for excellence in reporting on the many facets of our profession, as well as showing where it is going.\"\n\n\"As an Editorial Board member for Corporate Real Estate Journal, I have first-hand knowledge of the rigour and standards applied to the selection and review of content ... clear evidence how the Journal is able to provide such industry leading access into the views of our profession.\"\n\n“Business school professors need to ‘get real’ more often. Publishing work “…read only by a limited number of scholars…[with] often…little to no value to practicing mangers and leaders” won’t maintain our status and pay (J. Byrne in Poets & Quants, 2014). The Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions is an antidote we need.”"
