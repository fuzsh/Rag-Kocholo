It's a short black pastoral, probably made for the church crowd with it's explicit religious messaging. I've seen Muse in some bit parts before, but he's quite the commanding presence at the centre of this short. Sure it's focused on his misery, but he's got the face for desperate praying and a hell of a voice. There's some nice shot composition at the first too, but it's still very brief and very small scale."
