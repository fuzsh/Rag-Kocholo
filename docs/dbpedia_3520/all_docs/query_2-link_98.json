The question on everyone’s mind: Did its late owner, Jeanne Augier, leave her $500 million fortune to an alleged scammer?\n\nWhere French cities are concerned, Nice has always been the redheaded stepchild. Originally part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, it joined France in 1860, and it has never dropped its Italian side: the accent, the jewelry, the perma-tan, all the way down to the boyfriend who’s probably in the Mob."
