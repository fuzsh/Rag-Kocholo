        "text": "Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement’s earliest “sit-ins” to protest and challenge the system of segregation, the group came up with the idea of staging a protest “wade-in,” in which Black swimmers would wade into the waters of a segregated white beach to “test the waters” of the law.\n\nAs law-abiding citizens, they alerted the county sheriff to their intent. If they were arrested, the case would be seen as a challenge to existing segregations laws. Either they’d win their rights or the resulting news reports would draw important attention to their cause.\n\nOn the day of the wade-in, May 9, 1945, attorney Thomas carried a bag of cash for bail in case of arrests. The group had no idea if they’d be met by repressive law enforcement or the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThankfully, there was no violence, but the wade-in, at all-white Baker’s Haulover Beach, showed county leaders that Black citizens were not going to settle for business as usual. There were no legal repercussions; instead, county authorities called for a meeting with the wade-in organizers. Less than three months later, on August 1, 1945, the county opened Virginia Key Beach as a segregated park “for the exclusive use of Negroes.” The new beach featured amenities including a bathhouse, concession stand, and amusement rides. It became a hub for Black South Florida’s social, cultural, and political life.\n\nIn the summer of 1964 in St. Augustine, a hotel manager poured muriatic acid cleaning fluid into a pool where white and Black activists were gathered to protest desegregation.\n\nTragically, the dangerous ocean currents in that area cost several lives. And county leaders established a waste dump and sewage treatment plant nearby on the island.\n\nBy 1982 the County transferred the park to the City of Miami, which closed it, citing high operating expenses. But Virginia Key Beach never lost its place in the heart of the Black community.\n\nWhen word came in 1999 that the City of Miami planned to lease the site to private developers to build an exclusive upscale campground resort, they rallied and resisted it. Today, its history and future are determinedly protected by the Virginia Key Beach Park Trust. The area once considered undesirable by some is now poised to address the existential problems of our time, including climate change and sea level rise, as an indoor/outdoor historical and environmental museum.\n\nThose early wade-ins became a frequent tool of protest in the 1950s and early ’60s. Miami’s Crandon Park was successfully, if unofficially, desegregated in 1959, after a wade-in by members of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE).\n\nThe “colored beach” in Dania, established in the early ’50s, still had no promised access road by the summer of 1961. So businesswoman and then-president of the local chapter of the NAACP Eula Johnson and physician Von D. Mizell organized a series of wade-ins on whites-only Fort Lauderdale Beach.\n\nThe group included students from Fort Lauderdale’s historically Black Dillard High School and visiting college students. They were met by opponents, including axe-wielding Ku Klux Klan members, though no violence ensued. The city of Fort Lauderdale lost a lawsuit filed against the NAACP to stop the wade-ins, and by 1962, the county’s beaches were desegregated by law, if not, in practice.\n\nBeach-goers assembled for a group portrait by the bath house at Butler Beach — Anastasia Island.\n\nIn 1945, shortly after a wade-in protest at a whites-only beach, county leaders opened Virginia Key Beach for the exclusive use of Blacks.\n\nAnd in 2016, in tribute to the fearless and groundbreaking struggle they waged for equality, that “colored” beach was renamed the Dr. Von D. Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, St. Augustine was a national flash point in the struggle against segregation. Local civil rights activists, such as dentist Robert Hayling — who had been beaten and kidnapped by the Ku Klux Klan — were joined by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., C.T. Vivian, and other national leaders. The temperature rose as the summer unfolded with a series of marches, restaurant sit-ins, and wade-ins.\n\nOne such event — captured in horrifying photographs — took place on June 18, 1964 at the waterfront’s Monson Motor Lodge. A week before, Martin Luther King Jr. had been denied service by the lodge’s owner, James Brock, when he sought to order lunch in the Monson’s dining room. King was arrested for trespass and jailed.\n\nThe following week, six bathing-suit clad young people, four Black, and two white, entered the Monson’s pool. When the swimmers refused to get out, Brock emptied a jug of muriatic acid cleaning fluid into the water. An off-duty police officer jumped in to pull the swimmers out, beating them in the process. All this was captured by assembled news photographers, and these brutal images made their way onto newspaper pages around the world.\n\nRosier family at American Beach — Amelia Island.

Our friend Bobby Henry, whose family has published the Black-focused Westside Gazette Newspaper in Fort Lauderdale since 1971, recalls how challenging it was to access the swimming pool on the “white” side of town.\n\n”I remember once when I was coaching Little League swimming and we swam against a white team, the coaches exhibited so much prejudice to our team that we were almost kicked out of the pool,” he recalls. “But our team went on to win and one of our swimmers broke the record Mark Spitz held at that time. So I’d have to say segregation taught us to put forth the best effort we could and be proud of who we are, of our community and our families. I think we appreciated things more than others who were privileged, because we had to work so much harder for everything.”\n\nRosier family at American Beach — Amelia Island. Courtesy of Florida archives.\n\nAmerican Beach’s family legacy\n\nIn 2003, my husband and I gained an appreciation for the importance of American Beach in Northeast Florida through a direct descendant of its founder, Abraham Lincoln Lewis. Frank had barely settled into his position as Southeastern Regional Director of The Wilderness Society in Atlanta when MaVynee Betsch invited us to visit her on her ancestral American Beach, on Amelia Island, north of Jacksonville. The position of a Black man in the leadership of a national conservation organization was novel enough to attract her attention.\n\nBetsch was heir to the history and a bearer of the legacy of this paradise for Black Americans established in 1935, the year of her birth. She grew up in Jacksonville with her sister, anthropologist Johnnetta Betsch Cole, former president of Spelman College and director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African Art, and brother, John Betsch, a noted jazz drummer. She told us how her great grandfather, one of the founders and later president of the Afro American Life Insurance Company and a prominent Jacksonville business and civic leader, built upon his company’s success to create what would become American Beach.\n\nSaid to be Florida’s first Black millionaire, Lewis first acquired 33 acres including beachfront, and finally, with 216 acres, created a haven where Black people could enjoy themselves free from harassment and prosecution. Having modeled success as an entrepreneur, he invited affluent executives in the company to buy into American Beach.\n\nFor decades, the American Beach resort, with affordable commercial lodging supplementing the accommodations Black residents offered in their homes, entertainment venues and water sports, drew Black Americans from across the country. Icons, including Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Louis and James Brown, frolicked alongside Black people of lesser means, all enjoying respite from the press of racism. A.L. Lewis described it as “recreation and relaxation without humiliation.”\n\nSwimming class at the Robinson Trueblood swimming pool in the Frenchtown subdivision of Tallahassee. Courtesy of Florida Archives.\n\nThe demand for its amenities fell off after integration. But walking down main street with the elegant, 6-foot tall MaVynee Betsch, who’d trained at the Oberlin Conservatory and wowed Europe as an operatic mezzo-soprano for more than 10 years, was like stepping back in time. She had come back to American Beach to care for her declining grandfather and stayed on after she learned that encroaching development was threatening to absorb the community. With the help of the A.L. Lewis Historical Society, she strove to protect it. In 2001, she succeeded in getting American Beach listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nBetsch, a striking presence on the beach with her long dreadlocks, introduced us to the huge sand dune across the street she called “NaNa,” where she’d played as a child. She spoke glowingly about the spiritual connection she felt when she watched lightning dancing on the dune.\n\nFor years, she worked to persuade the National Park Service to acquire the dune and protect it as part of the nearby Timucuan Ecological and Historical Preserve and Kingsley Plantation, a unit of the park system.\n\nNearby Kingsley Plantation had been home to Betsch’s great- great- great grandparents, Zepheniah and Anna Kingsley, the young West African woman Zephaniah purchased as a slave and subsequently married. In 2004, a year before her death, Betsch finally persuaded the Amelia Island Plantation, which had bought up much of the land around American Beach, to transfer the dune to the park service. The American Beach Museum, Betsch’s dream, was founded in 2014. Today it conveys the history of the area as a bridge between its past and future.\n\nAmerican Beach was but one example of Black entrepreneurship. On Florida’s west coast, a group of Black businessmen established the beachfront community of Money Bayou Beach in Port St. Joe, Gulf County, in 1951. The beach attracted revelers from as far as Tuskegee, Alabama, and Cairo, Georgia, and offered opportunities for entrepreneurs who provided bus shuttles and other amenities for the beachgoers. It thrived through the 1960s, until integration provided other alternatives.\n\nThe greatest irony of segregated waters in Florida might be best illustrated by the story we learned of the Jones family, who owned islands in Biscayne Bay, beginning with Porgy Key, purchased in 1897 for $300. Lafayette “Parson” Jones and his Bahamian wife, Mozelle, moved to the island with their young son, King Arthur Jones, with another, Sir Lancelot Jones, on the way. This Black family eventually owned Porgy and Rhodes Keys and half of another island. They coaxed a living from the limestone rock, growing pineapples and key limes. They also salvaged shipwrecks in the area.\n\nSir Lancelot and his brother continued to live on the island after the death of their father. Sir Lancelot became a favorite bonefishing guide for prominent white members of the Coco Lobo Club across the channel, including President Warren Harding, and scions of the Honeywell and Goodyear families.\n\nAfter his brother died in 1966, Sir Lancelot resisted the blandishments of developers who wanted to buy his island as part of a plan to create another Miami Beach. Instead, he sold to the National Park Service in 1970, with the promise the land would be preserved. It is now part of Biscayne National Park, one of the largest marine parks in the National Park System.\n\nMaVynee Betsch in 1985, looking out over American Beach from the\n\nvantage point of the dunes she worked to protect.\n\nToday, the legacy of Florida’s segregated Black beaches might best be summarized by Peri Frances, descendant of A.L. Lewis and niece to MaVynee Betsch, who offers tours of American Beach and programs promoting its history."
