        "text": "I've now seen two films named Geronimo this year, and by the time you add Zero Dark Thirty's \"Geronimo\" Codeword for when Seal Team Six killed Bin Laden, that had both Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama creaming themselves, I've had a busy time with the former Apache Chief lately. This one stars Chuck Connors, an actor whose range is about the same as a paper aeroplane, although to be fair I wouldn't have said that to his face.
