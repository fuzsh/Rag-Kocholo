        "text": "Adele and her husband Rich Paul are going strong (like, planning to have kids together strong!), so clearly, the time has come to go through every! single! detail! of their relationship to get you up to speed. Let’s jump in.\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nDuring one of her Weekends With Adele residency shows in Las Vegas, Adele shouts out Rich Paul's daughter, Reonna Simone Paul, who has just graduated from Clark Atlanta University.\n\n“It is my stepdaughter’s graduation this weekend,” she is heard saying in a fan-captured video. “Her name is Reonna. So I love you, darling. Congratulations.”\n\nAdele also takes a moment to gush at the fact that Reonna is the first member of her family to graduate from college and says Rich is in Atlanta celebrating with her. “And obviously I’m here with you—wouldn’t be anywhere else—but I love you, baby. I love you!”\n\nWe're not crying, you are!\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nUpdate from Adele and Rich! A source tells People that the “relationship is solid,” adding that “they help each other and are good partners” and that Adele “loves being with him.”\n\nLove to hear it!\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nThe celebs enjoy a courtside date night at Los Angeles’s Crypto.com Arena and watch the NBA playoffs between the Lakers and the Nuggets.\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nIn her latest cover story for The Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Entertainment issue, Adele opens up about her relationship with Rich. First things first: She says he always hears her music when he’s traveling. “Every time Richard travels, the airplanes always play my music, and we can’t work out if it’s because they know that we are together or if it’s just what they do,” she dishes.\n\nShe also gets emotional while speaking about Rich’s memoir, Lucky Me: A Memoir of Changing the Odds and how it recounts memories of his late mother.\n\n“Rich and I have always known everything about each other since the day we got together. It was very emotional reading about his mum, because obviously she’s not with us, so I’ve never met her,” the Grammy winner shares through tears. “And she’s such a big part of Richard and the kids and the kids’ mum’s life and stuff like that. But I knew all about it. I’m getting a bit emotional. It was hard for him to write that.”\n\nNovember 18, 2023\n\nWell, well, well, rumor has it (heh) that these two are married! While attending her close friend Alan Carr’s Los Angeles comedy show, the singer reportedly reveals the marriage news in a spontaneous mid-show moment, per two audience members who end up spilling all the 🍵 to DeuxMoi.\n\n“I was at Alan Carr’s comedy show in L.A. tonight and Adele was in the audience. Alan asked the crowd if anyone got married recently and Adele shouted ‘I did,’” one insider writes.\n\nMeanwhile, a second showgoer notes, “When [Carr] asked if anyone got married recently, [Adele] yelled ‘I did.’ Super cute all around and was super sweet but dipped right before it ended.” “Adele was sitting right behind me with a friend having the best time. Her security only came in to bring her snacks. She didn’t care if people knew she was there. She was heckling [Carr]—they’re best friends,” they add.\n\nBrb, currently going through an entire box of Kleenex with all these tears!\n\nOctober 5, 2023\n\nUpdate! Adele and Rich aren’t married—they’re just into calling each other “husband” and “wife.” As a source puts it to Us Weekly, “They aren’t married, but they do call each other ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ and have been for a while now.” Actually, Rich started calling Adele his wife about two months into dating and “Adele loved the security [of it] and how much he adores her.”\n\nAs for when they do tie the knot, “Marriage is really just a ceremony at this point. They [already] live and act as husband and wife.”\n\nSeptember 24, 2023\n\nHot on the heels of calling Rich her husband, Adele refers to herself as his “wife” while telling fans she doesn’t understand American football despite Rich loving it.\n\n“Why does the whistle always get blown? Why is it four yards? Why are there inches? Why does it stop when it gets fucking exciting?” she asked, adding that she’s “not the greatest wife, really, when it comes to football—even though my partner absolutely loves it.”\n\nSeptember 17, 2023\n\nAdele casually calls Rich her “husband” while chatting with fans, leading to inevitable speculation that they got married without telling any of us.\n\nAugust 26, 2023\n\nAdele reveals she wants to have a baby “soon” and let fans in on her baby name list!\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nAdele says she plans on being with Rich for the rest of her life. Awwww!\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\nAdele crashes Rich’s stream and it’s hilarious and amazing:\n\nDecember 17, 2022\n\nRich Paul celebrates his 41st birthday in the absolute most iconic way possible: at the Adele show in Las Vegas. Naturally, she takes a few moments during her concert at Caesars Palace to sing “Happy Birthday” to him!!!\n\n“I love you more than life itself—we wish you happy birthday,” Adele says from the stage. Tear ducts = activated.\n\nAugust 15, 2022\n\nIn her stunning (!!) cover story for ELLE’s September issue, the singer ever-so-briefly discusses her relationship with her boyfriend. “I’ve never been in love like this. I’m obsessed with him,” she gushes. Then, when asked by the publication if she would ever want to remarry, she says, “Yes, absolutely.” Oh, and “I definitely want more kids...I’m a homemaker and I’m a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music. But right now, all I got in my brain is [my upcoming Las Vegas residency]. I wanna f*cking nail it.”\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nDuring an interview with E! News, Rich hints at the possibility of expanding his family and discusses having “more kids” and being “an older dad.” He muses, “As a young dad, growing a business, it was pretty tough...But now looking as an older dad and my kids being much older, and obviously, if I was to have more kids...I’m looking forward to being a different dad, a more patient dad.” S’cute!\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nAfter just about a year of dating, Adele posts a series of pics showing herself and Rich looking v loved-up along with the caption, “Time flies.”\n\nOh, and that mansion in the first pic? Apparently, Adele and Rich bought it...to live in...together. Per Just Jared, the massive 21,000-square-foot Beverly Park home was previously owned by Sylvester Stallone and sold to Adele and Rich for $58 million. Casual.\n\nFurther evidence that things are going v well: Right around the same time, an anonymous tipster submits a blind item that’s most definitely about Adele and Rich to IG gossip guru @DeuxMoi, saying that the two are “endgame.” According to the source, “He put a ring on it.” Okay!!\n\nMay 5, 2022\n\nAfter a few quiet months with zero sightings of the couple, Adele turns 34...but she doesn’t appear to celebrate with Rich. Instead, the agent spends the night in Miami, per Page Six, where he’s spotted hanging out with LeBron James at the American Express Presents Carbone Beach dinner party. Hmm....\n\nBut just a few days later, Rich seems to make it up to Adele by taking her on a belated birthday getaway to Napa Valley. “Adele is still seeing Rich,” a source tells People. “They are both very busy though. She is working on her residency and Rich is busy with his clients. They see each other when they can.”\n\nFebruary 20, 2022\n\nAdele and Rich once again sit courtside at an NBA All-Star game in Ohio and look wildly in love. Oh, and fans note that Adele is wearing what definitely looks to be a simple gold wedding band instead of that big diamond.\n\nFebruary 11, 2022\n\nAdele visits The Graham Norton Show and says that her rescheduled Vegas show is definitely happening this year because she wants to have a baby next year. Um??? She adds, “I have plans next year. Imagine if I have to cancel because I am having a baby!”\n\nShe also addresses speculation that she and Rich are engaged, saying, “As if I would ever tell anyone if I was or wasn’t.” V coy, Adele.\n\nFebruary 8, 2022\n\nIn a surprising twist, Adele shows up to the 2022 Brit Awards casually wearing what looks like a massive engagement ring. Just peep that Lorraine Schwartz pear-shape sparkler!\n\nFebruary 1, 2022\n\nAdele decides to shut down those rumors of relationship troubles with a post on IG. Alongside a cute pic of herself, she writes, “Hiya, so I’m really happy to say that I am performing at the Brits next week!! Anddddd I’ll also be popping in to see Graham for a chat on the couch while I’m in town too! I’m looking forward to it! Oh, and Rich sends his love.” Case closed.\n\nThe next day, a source for Us Weekly says Rich and Adele are “still solid” and “committed” to their relationship despite the tension brought on by the residency drama, noting that Rich has been “very patient and supportive” of his GF.\n\nJanuary 25, 2022\n\nSpeculation mounts that Adele canceled her Las Vegas residency due to drama with Rich. By which we mean that a source tells Page Six, “Adele’s been crying and couldn’t get through a single full rehearsal for the past month. Just constantly on the phone with Rich…loudly shouting and sobbing.” Yikes.\n\nOh, and another source says, “She and Rich had been fighting, and their relationship was volatile before she canceled her dates. Adele is very emotional and dramatic. He’s an NBA guy who has to go on the road—they are very different—and they hit a rough patch.”\n\nJanuary 7, 2022\n\nAnother night, another NBA courtside date, with Adele and Rich looking cute as ever and laughing together throughout the game.\n\nDecember 10, 2021\n\nAdele supports Rich’s New Balance sneaker collab by posting several pics of herself rocking a pair of Rich Paul 550s to her IG Story. Love to see a supportive GF.\n\nNot long after, they are spotted at an NFL game, even holding hands at one point.\n\nNovember 11, 2021\n\nDuring an interview with Rolling Stone, Adele says that she and Rich first met years ago at a mutual friend’s birthday party while they were both dancing to Drake. She also reveals that she reconnected with Rich one week after her estranged father passed away in May 2021.\n\nThree days later, Adele’s concert special, Adele One Night Only, airs on CBS, which includes a sit-down interview between Adele and Oprah Winfrey. During the interview, she says that her relationship with Rich is the first time that she’s loved herself enough to be really able to love someone else. “It’s just timing,” she explains. “But it’d be interesting to see what my reaction is like in general to anything that hurts me now that I feel so secure in myself, and I’m talking outside of romance as well.”\n\nOctober 13, 2021\n\nA source tells Us Weekly that Adele and Rich “complement each other perfectly” and “are in a fantastic place” in their relationship. “They’re very committed at this point and it’s hard to imagine they won’t be together for an extremely long time,” the source says, adding, “She really feels like she hit the jackpot.”\n\nLess than a week later, Adele and Rich are spotted courtside at another NBA game, this time between the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers in L.A. Go sports!\n\nOctober 7, 2021\n\nAdele opens up about Rich to Vogue, saying he’s “just so f*cking funny” and that “he was always there” but she “just didn’t see him” as a romantic prospect until recently. “I don’t feel anxious or nervous or frazzled,” she adds. “It’s quite the opposite. It’s wild....I’m a 33-year-old divorced mother of a son, who’s actually in charge. The last thing I need is someone who doesn’t know where they’re at or what they want. I know what I want. And I really know what I don’t want.”\n\nSeptember 19, 2021\n\nAdele and Rich go Instagram official (!!!!) on the last slide of this IG photo dump from NBA star Anthony Davis’s wedding to Marlen P, so it seems like their relationship is legit:\n\nA few days later, a source tells E! News that Adele is “very much in love with Rich” and that things are getting “more serious” between them. “They have both met each other’s kids but have been keeping it low-key around them,” the insider explains. “They both stay at each other’s places in L.A. and are pretty much inseparable. She feels really comfortable around him and is in a good headspace right now. She is all about having fun and being in good company and Rich definitely provides that.”\n\nAugust 4, 2021\n\nA source tells Us Weekly that Adele and Rich have actually been together “for months,” adding, “They have traveled with each other between Los Angeles and New York. He’s very shy and keeps a low profile when they go out, whereas Adele is super sociable.”\n\nAccording to the source, the two run in the same social circle, so it’s been easy to keep things on the lowdown. As they explain, “The people they hang out with know them both personally already, so they don’t have to introduce each other, which is probably why nobody picked up on their relationship sooner.” Makes sense!\n\nJuly 17, 2021\n\nAdele and Rich are spotted together for the first time at a Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns NBA game in Phoenix. Ofc, it isn’t long before dating rumors start circulating.\n\nAmusingly, the news comes from an ESPN host named Brian Windhorst, who accidentally blows up their spot on his podcast the next day, musing, “Rich Paul, [LeBron James’s] agent, brings his girlfriend to the game sitting next to LeBron. His girlfriend is Adele. Rich Paul is at the game with Adele. This is the first time they’ve come out in public together, so this will be all over the tabloids, especially in England tomorrow.” Lol, oops.\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nIn a , Rich teases that he’s been “hanging out” with a “major pop star” lately, although he doesn’t name names. He’s also quick to add, “I’m not dating, I’m single. Put that in the story.”\n\nOctober 8, 2020"
