What turns up is a social worker, who falls in love with Murray and a bit in love with Nick. As the child welfare people try to force Murray to become a conventional man (as the price they demand for allowing him to keep Nick), the nephew, who until now has gloried in his Uncle's iconoclastic approach to life, tries to play mediator. But when he succeeds, he is alarmed by the uncle's willingness to cave in to society in order to save the relationship.",

        "text": "Shots of New York scenery illustrate the simplicity and breezy expression that individualism is often more present in a city than elsewhere. Within that city, there are thousands of clowns, seeming crazy to the outer world and those who don’t comprehend the concept of urban life. Everyone is part of a circus, performs their own separate acts and becomes part of a community in the sense that, togetherness can be perceived differently than simply being socially inclined. No matter how theatrical, awkward, unnatural or overly humorous certain moments are, this is a beautiful showcase of the witty and hip quirks that cement 1960s independent cinema as its own wacky character.\n\nThis feels like a fairy tale for adults. There is such a great paradigm shift in our two main leads that give the story a solid narrative tension but it does flood a lot of other character arcs that interject with some smart dialogue treatment that poke holes in our main characters demeanor and not that this movie is about a loss it really feels about a grounding of what you want to hold on to. This clearly based on a play and the acting is very sharp with moments of conversation that feels so candid that rips you to shreds and is laughable at times with it's obscurity.\n\nGod bless Irving R Feldmen's holiday.\n\nMaking sarcastic jokes, browsing flea markets, and avoiding the job search whenever possible - 1965 Jason Robards is a 2023 icon.\n\nA Thousand Clowns has familiar elements, pieces that would be right at home in any other Oscar nominee of the period - a huge central performance, a theatrical origin, and a few moments where the sentiment crosses over into hammy territory. But watching it, the film also seems strikingly modern and countercultural, and not just because it's about a main character that deliberately seeks to challenge the everyday status quo at each turn - there's a creative use of montage that ridicules consumerism in a way a stage version could not, and the fluid cinematography captures New York in…\n\nIs there anything worse than forced whimsy? I've never seen the play on which this was based -- and likely never will since nobody stages this anymore -- but can state unequivocally that the movie doesn't work. There's not much of a story here, although that can usually be forgiven if the cast clicks or the production has a sense of fun. Negative on both those fronts too.\n\nA lazy but creative soul (Jason Robards) is visited by social workers for the city (New York) who inform him that he'll lose custody of his nephew if he doesn't get a job, which requires conforming with the world so there's a bit of an internal struggle, but of course he gives…\n\nWell… My simple, child reaction of what you did is that you are not funny. Funnier than you is even Stuart Schlossman, who is my friend, and is 11, and puts walnuts in his mouth and makes noises. What's *not* funny is to call us names. And what is mostly not funny is how sad you are, and I'd feel sorry for you -- if it wasn't for how dull you are. And those are the worst-tasting potato chips I've ever tasted. And that's my opinion from the blue, blue sky.\n\n\"Nick, in a moment you're going to see a horrible thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"People going to work.\"\n\nJason Robards is incredible in this. And with wonderful little pearls of wisdom (\"That's the most you can expect from life: a very good apology for all the things you won't get\"), I got strong senses of Auntie Mame from this play-turned-movie about a child being raised by a relative in NYC who shuns all the conventions of society, much to the chagrin of a child welfare worker.\n\nUnlike that movie, I was still into this when it shifted into a romance. The sequence where Robards tries to change his ways for the better loses a little of that levity, but this was still kind of a blast for the most part. I kind of want that apartment they live in.\n\nWas deeply worried this was another 'hip weirdo teaches the normies a lesson in having fun' movie, but instead it's a tortured thinker who can't come to grips to having to conform in order to save his small family.\n\nThere's one scene where Robards has to bust out a guitar to help distract his 'son' from the ugly truth that really struck home now that I'm a parent-- that need to protect them with distraction.\n\nA very 60s art movie in a lot of ways, but it still works.\n\nThis was my mom's pick for movie night because she remembers Robards answering the phone, \"Is this good news or money?\" and hanging up if it wasn't. Even though it's an Oscar winner (for the worst performance in the movie IMO), it seems to have disappeared! Luckily it exists illegally for free on youtube, so we were able to enjoy it without spending $80 to buy one of the three DVDs that exist on Amazon.\n\nIf nothing else, it's amusing that this movie accidentally names its characters the same names as iconic characters or stars them. This is the youngest William Daniels (Mr. Feeney!) performance I've seen and his voice is unmistakeably his, though I wouldn't have thought he had…"
