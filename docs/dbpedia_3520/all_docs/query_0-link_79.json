        "text": "Abstract\n\nLeveraging AI for synthesizing the deluge of biomedical knowledge has great potential for pharmacological discovery with applications including developing new therapeutics for untreated diseases and repurposing drugs as emergent pandemic treatments. Creating knowledge graph representations of interacting drugs, diseases, genes, and proteins enables discovery via embedding-based ML approaches and link prediction. Previously, it has been shown that these predictive methods are susceptible to biases from network structure, namely that they are driven not by discovering nuanced biological understanding of mechanisms, but based on high-degree hub nodes. In this work, we study the confounding effect of network topology on biological relation semantics by creating an experimental pipeline of knowledge graph semantic and topological perturbations. We show that the drop in drug repurposing performance from ablating meaningful semantics increases by 21% and 38% when mitigating topological bias in two networks. We demonstrate that new methods for representing knowledge and inferring new knowledge must be developed for making use of biomedical semantics for pharmacological innovation, and we suggest fruitful avenues for their development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13326-024-00308-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 38693563\n\nAbstract\n\nThe rapid expansion of protein sequence and structure databases has resulted in a significant number of proteins with ambiguous or unknown function. While advances in machine learning techniques hold great potential to fill this annotation gap, current methods for function prediction are unable to associate global function reliably to the specific residues responsible for that function. We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pre-trained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to identify enriched functions with residue-level explainability. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score > 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome-predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families-we predict several novel bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.10.13.562298\n\nView details for PubMedID 37905033\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10614799\n\nAbstract\n\nInferring knowledge from known relationships between drugs, proteins, genes, and diseases has great potential for clinical impact, such as predicting which existing drugs could be repurposed to treat rare diseases. Incorporating key biological context such as cell type or tissue of action into representations of extracted biomedical knowledge is essential for principled pharmacological discovery. Existing global, literature-derived knowledge graphs of interactions between drugs, proteins, genes, and diseases lack this essential information. In this study, we frame the task of associating biological context with protein-protein interactions extracted from text as a classification task using syntactic, semantic, and novel meta-discourse features. We introduce the Insider corpora, which are automatically generated PubMed-scale corpora for training classifiers for the context association task. These corpora are created by searching for precise syntactic cues of cell type and tissue relevancy to extracted regulatory relations. We report F1 scores of 0.955 and 0.862 for identifying relevant cell types and tissues, respectively, for our identified relations. By classifying with this framework, we demonstrate that the problem of context association can be addressed using intuitive, interpretable features. We demonstrate the potential of this approach to enrich text-derived knowledge bases with biological detail by incorporating cell type context into a protein-protein network for dengue fever.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104474\n\nView details for PubMedID 37572825\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose: The genetic architecture of corneal dysfunction remains poorly understood. Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between corneal structural features and anthropometric measures. We used global and local genetic similarity analysis to identify genomic features that may underlie structural corneal dysfunction.Methods: We assembled genome-wide association study summary statistics for corneal features (central corneal thickness, corneal hysteresis [CH], corneal resistance factor [CRF], and the 3 mm index of keratometry) and anthropometric traits (body mass index, weight, and height) in Europeans. We calculated global genetic correlations (rg) between traits using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and local genetic covariance using rho-HESS, which partitions the genome and performs regression with LD regions. Finally, we identified genes located within regions of significant genetic covariance and analyzed patterns of tissue expression and pathway enrichment.Results: Global LD score regression revealed significant negative correlations between height and both CH (rg = -0.12; P = 2.0 * 10-7) and CRF (rg = -0.11; P = 6.9 * 10-7). Local analysis revealed 68 genomic regions exhibiting significant local genetic covariance between CRF and height, containing 2874 unique genes. Pathway analysis of genes in regions with significant local rg revealed enrichment among signaling pathways with known keratoconus associations, including cadherin and Wnt signaling, as well as enrichment of genes modulated by copper and zinc ions.Conclusions: Corneal biophysical parameters and height share a common genomic architecture, which may facilitate identification of disease-associated genes and therapies for corneal ectasias.Translational Relevance: Local genetic covariance analysis enables the identification of associated genes and therapeutic targets for corneal ectatic disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/tvst.12.8.8\n\nView details for PubMedID 37561511\n\nAbstract\n\nTo develop an automated deep learning system for detecting the presence and location of disc hemorrhages in optic disc photographs.Development and testing of a deep learning algorithm.Optic disc photos (597 images with at least one disc hemorrhage and 1,075 images without any disc hemorrhage from 1,562 eyes) from five institutions were classified by expert graders based on the presence or absence of disc hemorrhage. The images were split into training (n=1,340), validation (n=167), and test (n=165) datasets. Two state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms based on either object-level detection or image-level classification were trained on the dataset. These models were compared to one another and against two independent glaucoma specialists. We evaluated model performance by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). AUCs were compared with the Hanley-McNeil method.The object detection model achieved an AUC of 0.936 (95% CI: 0.857-0.964) across all held-out images (n=165 photos) which was significantly superior to the image classification model (AUC; 0.845 (95% CI: 0.740-0.912; p=0.006). At an operating point selected for high specificity, the model achieved a specificity of 94.3% and a sensitivity of 70.0%, which was statistically indistinguishable from an expert clinician (p=0.7). At an operating point selected for high sensitivity, the model achieves a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 73.3%.An autonomous object detection model is superior to an image classification model for detecting disc hemorrhages and performed comparably to 2 clinicians.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajo.2023.07.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 37490992\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Spironolactone has been proposed as a potential modulator of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. We aimed to measure the effect of spironolactone use on the risk of adverse outcomes following COVID-19 hospitalization.Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 outcomes for patients with or without exposure to spironolactone, using population-scale claims data from the Komodo Healthcare Map. We identified all patients with a hospital admission for COVID-19 in the study window, defining treatment status based on spironolactone prescription orders. The primary outcomes were progression to respiratory ventilation or mortality during the hospitalization. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated following either 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) or multivariable regression. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant.Findings: Among 898,303 eligible patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, 16,324 patients (1.8%) had a spironolactone prescription prior to hospitalization. 59,937 patients (6.7%) met the ventilation endpoint, and 26,515 patients (3.0%) met the mortality endpoint. Spironolactone use was associated with a significant reduction in odds of both ventilation (OR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.75-0.88; p < 0.001) and mortality (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78-0.99; p = 0.033) in the PSM analysis, supported by the regression analysis. Spironolactone use was associated with significantly reduced odds of ventilation for all age groups, men, women, and non-obese patients, with the greatest protective effects in younger patients, men, and non-obese patients.Interpretation: Spironolactone use was associated with a protective effect against ventilation and mortality following COVID-19 infection, amounting to up to 64% of the protective effect of vaccination against ventilation and consistent with an androgen-dependent mechanism. The findings warrant initiation of large-scale randomized controlled trials to establish a potential therapeutic role for spironolactone in COVID-19 patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.02.28.23286515\n\nView details for PubMedID 36909470\n\nAbstract\n\nDrug abuse is a serious problem in the United States, with over 90,000 drug overdose deaths nationally in 2020. A key step in combating drug abuse is detecting, monitoring, and characterizing its trends over time and location, also known as pharmacovigilance. While federal reporting systems accomplish this to a degree, they often have high latency and incomplete coverage. Social-media-based pharmacovigilance has zero latency, is easily accessible and unfiltered, and benefits from drug users being willing to share their experiences online pseudo-anonymously. However, unlike highly structured official data sources, social media text is rife with misspellings and slang, making automated analysis difficult. Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large autoregressive language model specialized for few-shot learning that was trained on text from the entire internet. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to generate slang and common misspellings of terms for drugs of abuse. We repeatedly queried GPT-3 for synonyms of drugs of abuse and filtered the generated terms using automated Google searches and cross-references to known drug names. When generated terms for alprazolam were manually labeled, we found that our method produced 269 synonyms for alprazolam, 221 of which were new discoveries not included in an existing drug lexicon for social media. We repeated this process for 98 drugs of abuse, of which 22 are widely-discussed drugs of abuse, building a lexicon of colloquial drug synonyms that can be used for pharmacovigilance on social media.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/biom13020387\n\nView details for PubMedID 36830756\n\nAbstract\n\nExisting annotation paradigms rely on controlled vocabularies, where each data instance is classified into one term from a predefined set of controlled vocabularies. This paradigm restricts the analysis to concepts that are known and well-characterized. Here, we present the novel multilingual translation method BioTranslator to address this problem. BioTranslator takes a user-written textual description of a new concept and then translates this description to a non-text biological data instance. The key idea of BioTranslator is to develop a multilingual translation framework, where multiple modalities of biological data are all translated to text. We demonstrate how BioTranslator enables the identification of novel cell types using only a textual description and how BioTranslator can be further generalized to protein function prediction and drug target identification. Our tool frees scientists from limiting their analyses within predefined controlled vocabularies, enabling them to interact with biological data using free text.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-36476-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 36759510\n\nAbstract\n\nThe case-control study is a widely used method for investigating the genetic landscape of binary traits. However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts. Our pipeline of genome-wide association studies with disease liabilities can be applied to other biobanks with rich phenotype and genotype data.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.01.18.23284383\n\nView details for PubMedID 36712099\n\nAbstract\n\nPharmacogenetics, the study of how interindividual genetic differences affect drug response, does not explain all observed heritable variance in drug response. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation may account for some of the unexplained variances. Epigenetic mechanisms modulate gene expression and can be suitable drug targets and can impact the action of nonepigenetic drugs. Pharmacoepigenetics is the field that studies the relationship between epigenetic variability and drug response. Much of this research focuses on compounds targeting epigenetic mechanisms, called epigenetic drugs, which are used to treat cancers, immune disorders, and other diseases. Several studies also suggest an epigenetic role in classical drug response; however, we know little about this area. The amount of information correlating epigenetic biomarkers to molecular datasets has recently expanded due to technological advances, and novel computational approaches have emerged to better identify and predict epigenetic interactions. We propose that the relationship between epigenetics and classical drug response may be examined using data already available by (1) finding regions of epigenetic variance, (2) pinpointing key epigenetic biomarkers within these regions, and (3) mapping these biomarkers to a drug-response phenotype. This approach expands on existing knowledge to generate putative pharmacoepigenetic relationships, which can be tested experimentally. Epigenetic modifications are involved in disease and drug response. Therefore, understanding how epigenetic drivers impact the response to classical drugs is important for improving drug design and administration to better treat disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1017/pcm.2023.6\n\nView details for PubMedID 37560024\n\nAbstract\n\nThe identification and characterization of the structural sites which contribute to protein function are crucial for understanding biological mechanisms, evaluating disease risk, and developing targeted therapies. However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the Prosite database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites. These methods demonstrate that COLLAPSE is computationally efficient, tunable, and interpretable, providing a general-purpose platform for computational protein analysis.

We describe a method for phenotype recognition that imputes phenotype codes for all UK Biobank participants.POPDx (Population-based Objective Phenotyping by Deep Extrapolation) is a bilinear machine learning framework for simultaneously estimating the probabilities of 1538 phenotype codes. We extracted phenotypic and health-related information of 392 246 individuals from the UK Biobank for POPDx development and evaluation. A total of 12 803 ICD-10 diagnosis codes of the patients were converted to 1538 phecodes as gold standard labels. The POPDx framework was evaluated and compared to other available methods on automated multiphenotype recognition.POPDx can predict phenotypes that are rare or even unobserved in training. We demonstrate substantial improvement of automated multiphenotype recognition across 22 disease categories, and its application in identifying key epidemiological features associated with each phenotype.POPDx helps provide well-defined cohorts for downstream studies. It is a general-purpose method that can be applied to other biobanks with diverse but incomplete data.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocac226\n\nView details for PubMedID 36469791\n\nAbstract\n\nGenetic variants in SLC22A5, encoding the membrane carnitine transporter OCTN2, cause the rare metabolic disorder Carnitine Transporter Deficiency (CTD). CTD is potentially lethal but actionable if detected early, with confirmatory diagnosis involving sequencing of SLC22A5. Interpretation of missense variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) is a major challenge. In this study, we sought to characterize the largest set to date (n = 150) of OCTN2 variants identified in diverse ancestral populations, with the goals of furthering our understanding of the mechanisms leading to OCTN2 loss-of-function (LOF) and creating a protein-specific variant effect prediction model for OCTN2 function. Uptake assays with 14C-carnitine revealed that 105 variants (70%) significantly reduced transport of carnitine compared to wild-type OCTN2, and 37 variants (25%) severely reduced function to less than 20%. All ancestral populations harbored LOF variants; 62% of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged variants impaired OCTN2 localization to the plasma membrane of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, and subcellular localization significantly associated with function, revealing a major LOF mechanism of interest for CTD. With these data, we trained a model to classify variants as functional (>20% function) or LOF (<20% function). Our model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods as evaluated by multiple performance metrics, with mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.895 ± 0.025. In summary, in this study we generated a rich dataset of OCTN2 variant function and localization, revealed important disease-causing mechanisms, and improved upon machine learning-based prediction of OCTN2 variant function to aid in variant interpretation in the diagnosis and treatment of CTD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2210247119\n\nView details for PubMedID 36343260\n\nAbstract\n\nThe pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases is a coordinated process involving metabolic dysfunctions and immune response-usually modulated by the production of cytokines and associated inflammatory molecules. In this work, we seek to understand how genes involved in pathogenesis which are often not associated with the immune system in an obvious way communicate with the immune system. We have embedded a network of human protein-protein interactions (PPI) from the STRING database with 14,707 human genes using feature learning that captures high confidence edges. We have found that our predicted Association Scores derived from the features extracted from STRING's high confidence edges are useful for predicting novel connections between genes, thus enabling the construction of a full map of predicted associations for all possible pairs between 14,707 human genes. In particular, we analyzed the pattern of associations for 126 cytokines and found that the six patterns of cytokine interaction with human genes are consistent with their functional classifications. To define the disease-specific roles of cytokines we have collected gene sets for 11,944 diseases from DisGeNET. We used these gene sets to predict disease-specific gene associations with cytokines by calculating the normalized average Association Scores between disease-associated gene sets and the 126 cytokines; this creates a unique profile of inflammatory genes (both known and predicted) for each disease. We validated our predicted cytokine associations by comparing them to known associations for 171 diseases. The predicted cytokine profiles correlate (p-value<0.0003) with the known ones in 95 diseases. We further characterized the profiles of each disease by calculating an \"Inflammation Score\" that summarizes different modes of immune responses. Finally, by analyzing subnetworks formed between disease-specific pathogenesis genes, hormones, receptors, and cytokines, we identified the key genes responsible for interactions between pathogenesis and inflammatory responses. These genes and the corresponding cytokines used by different immune disorders suggest unique targets for drug discovery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009497\n\nView details for PubMedID 35404985\n\nAbstract\n\nThe three-dimensional structures of proteins are crucial for understanding their molecular mechanisms and interactions. Machine learning algorithms that are able to learn accurate representations of protein structures are therefore poised to play a key role in protein engineering and drug development. The accuracy of such models in deployment is directly influenced by training data quality. The use of different experimental methods for protein structure determination may introduce bias into the training data. In this work, we evaluate the magnitude of this effect across three distinct tasks: estimation of model accuracy, protein sequence design, and catalytic residue prediction. Most protein structures are derived from X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM); we trained each model on datasets consisting of either all three structure types or of only X-ray data. We Find that across these tasks, models consistently perform worse on test sets derived from NMR and cryo-EM than they do on test sets of structures derived from X-ray crystallography, but that the difference can be mitigated when NMR and cryo-EM structures are included in the training set. Importantly, we show that including all three types of structures in the training set does not degrade test performance on X-ray structures, and in some cases even increases it. Finally, we examine the relationship between model performance and the biophysical properties of each method, and recommend that the biochemistry of the task of interest should be considered when composing training sets.\n\nView details for PubMedID 34890132\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affect the health of hundreds of thousands of individuals annually in the United States, with associated costs of hundreds of billions of dollars. The monitoring and analysis of the severity of ADRs is limited by the current qualitative and categorical systems of severity classification. Previous efforts have generated quantitative estimates for a subset of ADRs but were limited in scope because of the time and costs associated with the efforts.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to increase the number of ADRs for which there are quantitative severity estimates while improving the quality of these severity estimates.METHODS: We present a semisupervised approach that estimates ADR severity by using social media word embeddings to construct a lexical network of ADRs and perform label propagation. We used this method to estimate the severity of 28,113 ADRs, representing 12,198 unique ADR concepts from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.RESULTS: Our Severity of Adverse Events Derived from Reddit (SAEDR) scores have good correlations with real-world outcomes. The SAEDR scores had Spearman correlations of 0.595, 0.633, and -0.748 for death, serious outcome, and no outcome, respectively, with ADR case outcomes in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. We investigated different methods for defining initial seed term sets and evaluated their impact on the severity estimates. We analyzed severity distributions for ADRs based on their appearance in boxed warning drug label sections, as well as for ADRs with sex-specific associations. We found that ADRs discovered in the postmarketing period had significantly greater severity than those discovered during the clinical trial (P<.001). We created quantitative drug-risk profile (DRIP) scores for 968 drugs that had a Spearman correlation of 0.377 with drugs ranked by the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System cases resulting in death, where the given drug was the primary suspect.CONCLUSIONS: Our SAEDR and DRIP scores are well correlated with the real-world outcomes of the entities they represent and have demonstrated utility in pharmacovigilance research. We make the SAEDR scores for 12,198 ADRs and the DRIP scores for 968 drugs publicly available to enable more quantitative analysis of pharmacovigilance data.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2196/27714\n\nView details for PubMedID 34673524\n\nAbstract\n\nSingle cell technologies are rapidly generating large amounts of data that enables us to understand biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, joint analysis of datasets generated by independent labs remains challenging due to a lack of consistent terminology to describe cell types. Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types that are part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. A key advantage of OnClass is its capability to classify cells into cell types not present in the training data because it uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships. Furthermore, OnClass can be used to identify marker genes for all the cell ontology categories, regardless of whether the cell types are present or absent in the training data, suggesting that OnClass goes beyond a simple annotation tool for single cell datasets, being the first algorithm capable to identify marker genes specific to all terms of the Cell Ontology and offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-021-25725-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 34548483\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Defining clinical phenotypes provides opportunities for new diagnostics and may provide insights into early intervention and disease prevention. There is increasing evidence that patient-derived health data may contain information that complements traditional methods of clinical phenotyping. The utility of these data for defining meaningful phenotypic groups is of great interest because social media and online resources make it possible to query large cohorts of patients with health conditions.METHODS: We evaluated the degree to which patient-reported categorical data is useful for discovering subclinical phenotypes and evaluated its utility for discovering new measures of disease severity, treatment response and genetic architecture. Specifically, we examined the responses of 1961 patients with inflammatory bowel disease to questionnaires in search of sub-phenotypes. We applied machine learning methods to identify novel subtypes of Crohn's disease and studied their associations with drug responses.RESULTS: Using the patients' self-reported information, we identified two subpopulations of Crohn's disease; these subpopulations differ in disease severity, associations with smoking, and genetic transmission patterns. We also identified distinct features of drug response for the two Crohn's disease subtypes. These subtypes show a trend towards differential genotype signatures.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patient-defined data can have unplanned utility for defining disease subtypes and may be useful for guiding treatment approaches.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12876-021-01740-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 33836648\n\nAbstract\n\nGenome sequencing is enabling precision medicine-tailoring treatment to the unique constellation of variants in an individual's genome. The impact of recurrent pathogenic variants is often understood, however there is a long tail of rare genetic variants that are uncharacterized. The problem of uncharacterized rare variation is especially acute when it occurs in genes of known clinical importance with functionally consequential variants and associated mechanisms. Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in these genes are discovered at a rate that outpaces current ability to classify them with databases of previous cases, experimental evaluation, and computational predictors. Clinicians are thus left without guidance about the significance of variants that may have actionable consequences. Computational prediction of the impact of rare genetic variation is increasingly becoming an important capability. In this paper, we review the technical and ethical challenges of interpreting the function of rare variants in two settings: inborn errors of metabolism in newborns and pharmacogenomics. We propose a framework for a genomic learning healthcare system with an initial focus on early-onset treatable disease in newborns and actionable pharmacogenomics. We argue that (1) a genomic learning healthcare system must allow for continuous collection and assessment of rare variants, (2) emerging machine learning methods will enable algorithms to predict the clinical impact of rare variants on protein function, and (3) ethical considerations must inform the construction and deployment of all rare-variation triage strategies, particularly with respect to health disparities arising from unbalanced ancestry representation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.03.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 33798442\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Women are at more than 1.5-fold higher risk for clinically relevant adverse drug events. While this higher prevalence is partially due to gender-related effects, biological sex differences likely also impact drug response. Publicly available gene expression databases provide a unique opportunity for examining drug response at a cellular level. However, missingness and heterogeneity of metadata prevent large-scale identification of drug exposure studies and limit assessments of sex bias. To address this, we trained organism-specific models to infer sample sex from gene expression data, and used entity normalization to map metadata cell line and drug mentions to existing ontologies. Using this method, we inferred sex labels for 450,371 human and 245,107 mouse microarray and RNA-seq samples from refine.bio.RESULTS: Overall, we find slight female bias (52.1%) in human samples and (62.5%) male bias in mouse samples; this corresponds to a majority of mixed sex studies in humans and single sex studies in mice, split between female-only and male-only (25.8% vs. 18.9% in human and 21.6% vs. 31.1% in mouse, respectively). In drug studies, we find limited evidence for sex-sampling bias overall; however, specific categories of drugs, including human cancer and mouse nervous system drugs, are enriched in female-only and male-only studies, respectively. We leverage our expression-based sex labels to further examine the complexity of cell line sex and assess the frequency of metadata sex label misannotations (2-5%).CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate limited overall sex bias, while highlighting high bias in specific subfields and underscoring the importance of including sex labels to better understand the underlying biology. We make our inferred and normalized labels, along with flags for misannotated samples, publicly available to catalyze the routine use of sex as a study variable in future analyses.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12859-021-04070-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 33784977\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Understanding the relationships between genes, drugs, and disease states is at the core of pharmacogenomics. Two leading approaches for identifying these relationships in medical literature are: human expert led manual curation efforts, and modern data mining based automated approaches. The former generates small amounts of high-quality data, and the later offers large volumes of mixed quality data. The algorithmically extracted relationships are often accompanied by supporting evidence, such as, confidence scores, source articles, and surrounding contexts (excerpts) from the articles, that can used as data quality indicators. Tools that can leverage these quality indicators to help the user gain access to larger and high-quality data are needed.APPROACH: We introduce GeneDive, a web application for pharmacogenomics researchers and precision medicine practitioners that makes gene, disease, and drug interactions data easily accessible and usable. GeneDive is designed to meet three key objectives: (1) provide functionality to manage information-overload problem and facilitate easy assimilation of supporting evidence, (2) support longitudinal and exploratory research investigations, and (3) offer integration of user-provided interactions data without requiring data sharing.RESULTS: GeneDive offers multiple search modalities, visualizations, and other features that guide the user efficiently to the information of their interest. To facilitate exploratory research, GeneDive makes the supporting evidence and context for each interaction readily available and allows the data quality threshold to be controlled by the user as per their risk tolerance level. The interactive search-visualization loop enables relationship discoveries between diseases, genes, and drugs that might not be explicitly described in literature but are emergent from the source medical corpus and deductive reasoning. The ability to utilize user's data either in combination with the GeneDive native datasets or in isolation promotes richer data-driven exploration and discovery. These functionalities along with GeneDive's applicability for precision medicine, bringing the knowledge contained in biomedical literature to bear on particular clinical situations and improving patient care, are illustrated through detailed use cases.CONCLUSION: GeneDive is a comprehensive, broad-use biological interactions browser. The GeneDive application and information about its underlying system architecture are available at http://www.genedive.net. GeneDive Docker image is also available for download at this URL, allowing users to (1) import their own interaction data securely and privately; and (2) generate and test hypotheses across their own and other datasets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103732\n\nView details for PubMedID 33737208\n\nAbstract\n\nFor many prevalent complex diseases, treatment regimens are frequently ineffective. For example, despite multiple available immunomodulators and immunosuppressants, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains difficult to treat. Heterogeneity in the disease across patients makes it challenging to select the optimal treatment regimens, and some patients do not respond to any of the existing treatment choices. Drug repurposing strategies for IBD have had limited clinical success and have not typically offered individualized patient-level treatment recommendations. In this work, we present NetPTP, a Network-based Personalized Treatment Prediction framework which models measured drug effects from gene expression data and applies them to patient samples to generate personalized ranked treatment lists. To accomplish this, we combine publicly available network, drug target, and drug effect data to generate treatment rankings using patient data. These ranked lists can then be used to prioritize existing treatments and discover new therapies for individual patients. We demonstrate how NetPTP captures and models drug effects, and we apply our framework to individual IBD samples to provide novel insights into IBD treatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008631\n\nView details for PubMedID 33544718\n\nAbstract\n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major concern for patients, clinicians, and regulatory agencies. The discovery of serious ADRs leading to substantial morbidity and mortality has resulted in mandatory Phase IV clinical trials, black box warnings, and withdrawal of drugs from the market. Real World Data, data collected during routine clinical care, is being adopted by innovators, regulators, payors, and providers to inform decision making throughout the product life cycle. We outline several different approaches to modern pharmacovigilance, including spontaneous reporting databases, electronic health record monitoring and research frameworks, social media surveillance, and the use of digital devices. Some of these platforms are well established while others are still emerging, or experimental. We highlight both the potential opportunity, as well as the existing challenges within these pharmacovigilance systems that have already begun to impact the drug development process, as well as the landscape of postmarket drug safety monitoring. Further research and investment into different and complementary pharmacovigilance systems is needed to ensure the continued safety of pharmacotherapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cpt.2172\n\nView details for PubMedID 33492663\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge to the biomedical research community at the intersection of great uncertainty due to the novelty of the virus and extremely high stakes due to the large global death count. The global quarantine shut-downs complicated scientific matters because many laboratories were closed down unless they were actively doing COVID-19 related research, making repurposing of activities difficult for many biomedical researchers. Biomedical informaticians, who have been primarily able to continue their research through remote work and video conferencing, have been able to maintain normal activities. In addition to continuing ongoing studies, there has been great grass roots interest in helping in the fight against COVID-19. In this commentary, we describe several projects that arose from this desire to help, and the lessons that the authors learned along the way. We then offer some insights into how these lessons might be applied to make scientific progress be more efficient in future crisis scenarios.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103673\n\nView details for PubMedID 33486067\n\nAbstract\n\nPharmacogenetics studies how genetic variation leads to variability in drug response. Guidelines for selecting the right drug and right dose for patients based on their genetics are clinically effective, but are widely unused. For some drugs, the normal clinical decision making process may lead to the optimal dose of a drug that minimizes side effects and maximizes effectiveness. Without measurements of genotype, physicians and patients may adjust dosage in a manner that reflects the underlying genetics. The emergence of genetic data linked to longitudinal clinical data in large biobanks offers an opportunity to confirm known pharmacogenetic interactions as well as discover novel associations by investigating outcomes from normal clinical practice. Here we use the UK Biobank to search for pharmacogenetic interactions among 200 drugs and 9 genes among 200,000 participants. We identify associations between pharmacogene phenotypes and drug maintenance dose as well as differential drug response phenotypes. We find support for several known drug-gene associations as well as novel pharmacogenetic interactions.\n\nView details for PubMedID 33691016\n\nAbstract\n\nPharmacogenetics (PGx) studies the influence of genetic variation on drug response. Clinically actionable associations inform guidelines created by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), but the broad impact of genetic variation on entire populations is not well-understood. We analyzed PGx allele and phenotype frequencies for 487,409 participants in the U.K. Biobank, the largest PGx study to date. For fourteen CPIC pharmacogenes known to influence human drug response, we find that 99.5% of individuals may have an atypical response to at least one drug; on average they may have an atypical response to 10.3 drugs. Nearly 24% of participants have been prescribed a drug for which they are predicted to have an atypical response. Non-European populations carry a greater frequency of variants that are predicted to be functionally deleterious; many of these are not captured by current PGx allele definitions. Strategies for detecting and interpreting rare variation will be critical for enabling broad application of pharmacogenetics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cpt.2122\n\nView details for PubMedID 33237584\n\nAbstract\n\nCytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a highly polymorphic gene whose protein product metabolizes more than 20% of clinically used drugs. Genetic variations in CYP2D6 are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making CYP2D6 one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to CYP2D6 haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of CYP2D6 haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts CYP2D6 haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in in vitro functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008399\n\nView details for PubMedID 33137098\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To assess usability and usefulness of a machine learning-based order recommender system applied to simulated clinical cases.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 43 physicians entered orders for 5 simulated clinical cases using a clinical order entry interface with or without access to a previously developed automated order recommender system. Cases were randomly allocated to the recommender system in a 3:2 ratio. A panel of clinicians scored whether the orders placed were clinically appropriate. Our primary outcome included the difference in clinical appropriateness scores. Secondary outcomes included total number of orders, case time, and survey responses.RESULTS: Clinical appropriateness scores per order were comparable for cases randomized to the order recommender system (mean difference -0.11 order per score, 95% CI: [-0.41, 0.20]). Physicians using the recommender placed more orders (median 16 vs 15 orders, incidence rate ratio 1.09, 95%CI: [1.01-1.17]). Case times were comparable with the recommender system. Order suggestions generated from the recommender system were more likely to match physician needs than standard manual search options. Physicians used recommender suggestions in 98% of available cases. Approximately 95% of participants agreed the system would be useful for their workflows.DISCUSSION: User testing with a simulated electronic medical record interface can assess the value of machine learning and clinical decision support tools for clinician usability and acceptance before live deployments.CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can use and accept machine learned clinical order recommendations integrated into an electronic order entry interface in a simulated setting. The clinical appropriateness of orders entered was comparable even when supported by automated recommendations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocaa190\n\nView details for PubMedID 33106874\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough tremendous effort has been put into cell-type annotation, identification of previously uncharacterized cell types in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41592-020-00979-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 33077966\n\nAbstract\n\nPharmacogenomics is a key area of precision medicine which is already being implemented in some health systems and may help guide clinicians towards effective therapies for individual patients. Over the last two decades, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) has built a unique repository of pharmacogenomic knowledge, including annotations of clinical guideline and regulator-approved drug labels in addition to evidence-based drug pathways and annotations of the scientific literature. All of this knowledge is freely accessible on the PharmGKB website. In the first of a series of PharmGKB tutorials, we introduce the PharmGKB COVID-19 portal and, using examples of drugs found in the portal, demonstrate some of the main features of PharmGKB. This paper is intended as a resource to help users become quickly acquainted with the wealth of information stored in PharmGKB.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cpt.2067\n\nView details for PubMedID 32978778\n\nAbstract\n\nSex differences have been shown in laboratory biomarkers; however, the extent to which this is due to genetics is unknown. In this study, we infer sex-specific genetic parameters (heritability and genetic correlation) across 33 quantitative biomarker traits in 181,064 females and 156,135 males from the UK Biobank study. We apply a Bayesian Mixture Model, Sex Effects Mixture Model(SEMM), to Genome-wide Association Study summary statistics in order to (1) estimate the contributions of sex to the genetic variance of these biomarkers and (2) identify variants whose statistical association with these traits is sex-specific. We find that the genetics of most biomarker traits are shared between males and females, with the notable exception of testosterone, where we identify 119 female and 445 male-specific variants. These include protein-altering variants in steroid hormone production genes (POR, UGT2B7). Using the sex-specific variants as genetic instruments for Mendelian randomization, we find evidence for causal links between testosterone levels and height, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and type 2 diabetes. We also show that sex-specific polygenic risk score models for testosterone outperform a combined model. Overall, these results demonstrate that while sex has a limited role in the genetics of most biomarker traits, sex plays an important role in testosterone genetics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41431-020-00712-w\n\nView details for PubMedID 32873964\n\nAbstract\n\nThe most rapid path to discovering treatment options for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is to find existing medications that are active against the virus. We have focused on identifying repurposing candidates for the transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2), which is critical for entry of coronaviruses into cells. Using known 3D structures of close homologs, we created seven homology models. We also identified a set of serine protease inhibitor drugs, generated several conformations of each, and docked them into our models. We used three known chemical (non-drug) inhibitors and one validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 in MERS as benchmark compounds and found six compounds with predicted high binding affinity in the range of the known inhibitors. We also showed that a previously published weak inhibitor, Camostat, had a significantly lower binding score than our six compounds. All six compounds are anticoagulants with significant and potentially dangerous clinical effects and side effects. Nonetheless, if these compounds significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, they could represent a potentially useful clinical tool.\n\nView details for DOI 10.26434/chemrxiv.12009582\n\nView details for PubMedID 32511288\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7263764\n\nAbstract\n\nNon-small cell lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and histopathological evaluation plays the primary role in its diagnosis. However, the morphological patterns associated with the molecular subtypes have not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we developed a quantitative histopathology analytic framework to identify the types and gene expression subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer objectively.We processed whole-slide histopathology images of lung adenocarcinoma (n = 427) and lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (n = 457) in the Cancer Genome Atlas. We built convolutional neural networks to classify histopathology images, evaluated their performance by the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs), and validated the results in an independent cohort (n = 125).To establish neural networks for quantitative image analyses, we first built convolutional neural network models to identify tumor regions from adjacent dense benign tissues (AUCs > 0.935) and recapitulated expert pathologists' diagnosis (AUCs > 0.877), with the results validated in an independent cohort (AUCs = 0.726-0.864). We further demonstrated that quantitative histopathology morphology features identified the major transcriptomic subtypes of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (P < .01).Our study is the first to classify the transcriptomic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer using fully automated machine learning methods. Our approach does not rely on prior pathology knowledge and can discover novel clinically relevant histopathology patterns objectively. The developed procedure is generalizable to other tumor types or diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocz230\n\nView details for PubMedID 32364237\n\nAbstract\n\nThe global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a surge in research exploring all aspects of the virus and its effects on human health. The overwhelming rate of publications means that human researchers are unable to keep abreast of the research. To ameliorate this, we present the CoronaCentral resource which uses machine learning to process the research literature on SARS-CoV-2 along with articles on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We break the literature down into useful categories and enable analysis of the contents, pace, and emphasis of research during the crisis. These categories cover therapeutics, forecasting as well as growing areas such as \"Long Covid\" and studies of inequality and misinformation. Using this data, we compare topics that appear in original research articles compared to commentaries and other article types. Finally, using Altmetric data, we identify the topics that have gained the most media attention. This resource, available at https://coronacentral.ai , is updated multiple times per day and provides an easy-to-navigate system to find papers in different categories, focussing on different aspects of the virus along with currently trending articles.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2020.12.21.423860\n\nView details for PubMedID 33398279\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7781314\n\nAbstract\n\nNamed entity recognition tools are used to identify mentions of biomedical entities in free text and are essential components of high-quality information retrieval and extraction systems. Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity \"type 1 diabetes\" in the phrase \"type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\" This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE's existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.5808/GI.2020.18.2.e15\n\nView details for PubMedID 32634869\n\nAbstract\n\nAntiplatelet response to clopidogrel shows wide variation, and poor response is correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles play an important role in this response, but account for only a small proportion of variability in response to clopidogrel. An aim of the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC) is to identify other genetic determinants of clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical response. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA from 2,750 European ancestry individuals, using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced platelet reactivity and major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events as outcome parameters. GWAS for platelet reactivity revealed a strong signal for CYP2C19*2 (p-value=1.67e-33). After correction for CYP2C19*2 no other SNP reached genome-wide significance. GWAS for a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (5.0% event rate) or a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (4.7% event rate) showed no significant results, although in coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention, and acute coronary syndrome subgroups, mutations in SCOS5P1, CDC42BPA and CTRAC1 showed genome-wide significance (lowest p-values: 1.07e-09, 4.53e-08 and 2.60e-10, respectively). CYP2C19*2 is the strongest genetic determinant of on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity. We identified three novel associations in clinical outcome subgroups, suggestive for each of these outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cpt.1911\n\nView details for PubMedID 32472697\n\nAbstract\n\nEnzymatic and chemical reactions are key for understanding biological processes in cells. Curated databases of chemical reactions exist but these databases struggle to keep up with the exponential growth of the biomedical literature. Conventional text mining pipelines provide tools to automatically extract entities and relationships from the scientific literature, and partially replace expert curation, but such machine learning frameworks often require a large amount of labeled training data and thus lack scalability for both larger document corpora and new relationship types.We developed an application of Snorkel, a weakly supervised learning framework, for extracting chemical reaction relationships from biomedical literature abstracts. For this work, we defined a chemical reaction relationship as the transformation of chemical A to chemical B. We built and evaluated our system on small annotated sets of chemical reaction relationships from two corpora: curated bacteria-related abstracts from the MetaCyc database (MetaCyc_Corpus) and a more general set of abstracts annotated with MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) term Bacteria (Bacteria_Corpus; a superset of MetaCyc_Corpus). For the MetaCyc_Corpus, we obtained 84% precision and 41% recall (55% F1 score). Extending to the more general Bacteria_Corpus decreased precision to 62% with only a four-point drop in recall to 37% (46% F1 score). Overall, the Bacteria_Corpus contained two orders of magnitude more candidate chemical reaction relationships (nine million candidates vs 68,0000 candidates) and had a larger class imbalance (2.5% positives vs 5% positives) as compared to the MetaCyc_Corpus. In total, we extracted 6871 chemical reaction relationships from nine million candidates in the Bacteria_Corpus.With this work, we built a database of chemical reaction relationships from almost 900,000 scientific abstracts without a large training set of labeled annotations. Further, we showed the generalizability of our initial application built on MetaCyc documents enriched with chemical reactions to a general set of articles related to bacteria.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12859-020-03542-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 32460703\n\nAbstract\n\nAsians as a group comprise of over 60% the world's population. There is an incredible amount of diversity in Asian and admixed populations that has not been studied in a pharmacogenetic context. The known pharmacogenetic differences in Asians subgroups generally represent previously known variants that are present at much lower or higher frequencies in Asians compared to other populations. This review aims to summarize the main drugs and known genes that appear to have differences in their pharmacogenetic properties in certain Asian populations. Evidence based guidelines and summary statistics from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) were analyzed for ethnic differences in outcomes. Implicated drugs included commonly prescribed drugs such as warfarin, clopidogrel, carbamazepine, and allopurinol. The majority of these associations are due to Asians more commonly being CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and carriers of the HLA-B*15:02 allele. The relative risk increase seen ranged between genes and drugs but could be over 100x more likely in Asians such as the 172x increase in risk of SJS and TEN with carbamazepine use amongst HLA-B*15:02 carriers. The effects ranged from relatively benign reactions such as reduced drug efficacy to severe cutaneous skin reactions. These reactions are severe and prevalent enough to warrant pharmacogenetic testing and appropriate changes in dosing and medication choice for at risk populations. Further studies should be done on Asian cohorts to more fully understand pharmacogenetic variants in these populations to understand how such differences may influence drug response.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/cts.12771\n\nView details for PubMedID 32100936\n\nAbstract\n\nMillions of Americans are affected by rare diseases, many of which have poor survival rates. However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31797619\n\nAbstract\n\nPrecision medicine tailors treatment to individuals personal data including differences in their genome. The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) provides highly curated information on the effect of genetic variation on drug response and side effects for a wide range of drugs. PharmGKB's scientific curators triage, review and annotate a large number of papers each year but the task is challenging. We present the PGxMine resource, a text-mined resource of pharmacogenomic associations from all accessible published literature to assist in the curation of PharmGKB. We developed a supervised machine learning pipeline to extract associations between a variant (DNA and protein changes, star alleles and dbSNP identifiers) and a chemical. PGxMine covers 452 chemicals and 2,426 variants and contains 19,930 mentions of pharmacogenomic associations across 7,170 papers. An evaluation by PharmGKB curators found that 57 of the top 100 associations not found in PharmGKB led to 83 curatable papers and a further 24 associations would likely lead to curatable papers through citations.

Extensive evidence implicates genetic factors and signaling disruption in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Changes in transcription often underlie this molecular pathway dysregulation; individual patient transcriptional data can improve the efficacy of diagnosis and treatment. Recent large-scale genomic studies have uncovered shared genetic modules across multiple psychiatric disorders - providing an opportunity for an integrated multi-disease approach for diagnosis. Moreover, network-based models informed by gene expression can represent pathological biological mechanisms and suggest new genes for diagnosis and treatment. Here, we use patient gene expression data from multiple studies to classify psychiatric diseases, integrate knowledge from expert-curated databases and publicly available experimental data to create augmented disease-specific gene sets, and use these to recommend disease-relevant drugs. From Gene Expression Omnibus, we extract expression data from 145 cases of schizophrenia, 82 cases of bipolar disorder, 190 cases of major depressive disorder, and 307 shared controls. We use pathway-based approaches to predict psychiatric disease diagnosis with a random forest model (78% accuracy) and derive important features to augment available drug and disease signatures. Using protein-protein-interaction networks and embedding-based methods, we build a pipeline to prioritize treatments for psychiatric diseases that achieves a 3.4-fold improvement over a background model. Thus, we demonstrate that gene-expression-derived pathway features can diagnose psychiatric diseases and that molecular insights derived from this classification task can inform treatment prioritization for psychiatric diseases.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31797637\n\nAbstract\n\nSocial media has been identified as a promising potential source of information for pharmacovigilance. The adoption of social media data has been hindered by the massive and noisy nature of the data. Initial attempts to use social media data have relied on exact text matches to drugs of interest, and therefore suffer from the gap between formal drug lexicons and the informal nature of social media. The Reddit comment archive represents an ideal corpus for bridging this gap. We trained a word embedding model, RedMed, to facilitate the identification and retrieval of health entities from Reddit data. We compare the performance of our model trained on a consumer-generated corpus against publicly available models trained on expert-generated corpora. Our automated classification pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.88 and a specificity of > 0.9 across four different term classes. Of all drug mentions, an average of 79% (±0.5%) were exact matches to a generic or trademark drug name, 14% (±0.5%) were misspellings, 6.4% (±0.3%) were synonyms, and 0.13% (±0.05%) were pill marks. We find that our system captures an additional 20% of mentions; these would have been missed by approaches that rely solely on exact string matches. We provide a lexicon of misspellings and synonyms for 2,978 drugs and a word embedding model trained on a health-oriented subset of Reddit.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103307\n\nView details for PubMedID 31627020\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and there is rising interest to determine if AF severity or burden can further risk stratify these patients, particularly for near-term events. Using continuous remote monitoring data from cardiac implantable electronic devices, we sought to evaluate if machine learned signatures of AF burden could provide prognostic information on near-term risk of stroke when compared to conventional risk scores.METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified Veterans Health Administration serviced patients with cardiac implantable electronic device remote monitoring data and at least one day of device-registered AF. The first 30 days of remote monitoring in nonstroke controls were compared against the past 30 days of remote monitoring before stroke in cases. We trained 3 types of models on our data: (1) convolutional neural networks, (2) random forest, and (3) L1 regularized logistic regression (LASSO). We calculated the CHA2DS2-VASc score for each patient and compared its performance against machine learned indices based on AF burden in separate test cohorts. Finally, we investigated the effect of combining our AF burden models with CHA2DS2-VASc. We identified 3114 nonstroke controls and 71 stroke cases, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Random forest performed the best in the test data set (area under the curve [AUC]=0.662) and convolutional neural network in the validation dataset (AUC=0.702), whereas CHA2DS2-VASc had an AUC of 0.5 or less in both data sets. Combining CHA2DS2-VASc with random forest and convolutional neural network yielded a validation AUC of 0.696 and test AUC of 0.634, yielding the highest average AUC on nontraining data.CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study found that machine learning and ensemble methods that incorporate daily AF burden signature provided incremental prognostic value for risk stratification beyond CHA2DS2-VASc for near-term risk of stroke.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005595\n\nView details for PubMedID 31610712\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: Clopidogrel is prescribed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events. While investigations have identified genetic determinants of inter-individual variability in on-treatment platelet inhibition (e.g. CYP2C19*2), evidence that these variants have clinical utility to predict major adverse cardiovascular events remains controversial.METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the impact of 31 candidate gene polymorphisms on ADP-stimulated platelet reactivity in 3,391 clopidogrel-treated coronary artery disease patients of the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC). The influence of these polymorphisms on cardiovascular events (CVE) was tested in 2,134 ICPC patients (N=129 events) in whom clinical event data were available. Several variants were associated with on-treatment ADP-stimulated platelet reactivity (CYP2C19*2, P=8.8x10-54; CES1 G143E, P=1.3x10-16; CYP2C19*17, P=9.5x10-10; CYP2B6 1294+53C>T, P=3.0x10-4; CYP2B6 516G>T, P=1.0x10-3; CYP2C9*2, P=1.2x10-3; and CYP2C9*3, P=1.5x10-3). While no individual variant was associated with CVEs, generation of a pharmacogenomic polygenic response score (PgxRS) revealed that patients who carried a greater number of alleles that associated with increased on-treatment platelet reactivity were more likely to experience CVEs (beta=0.17, SE 0.06, P=0.01) and cardiovascular-related death (beta=0.43, SE 0.16, P=0.007). Patients who carried 8 or more risk alleles were significantly more likely to experience CVEs (OR=1.78, 95%CI 1.14-2.76, P=0.01) and cardiovascular death (OR=4.39, 95%CI 1.35-14.27, P=0.01) compared to patients who carried 6 or fewer of these alleles.CONCLUSION: Several polymorphisms impact clopidogrel response and PgxRS is a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Additional investigations that identify novel determinants of clopidogrel response and validating polygenic models may facilitate future precision medicine strategies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvz045\n\nView details for PubMedID 31504375\n\nAbstract\n\nGenetics play a key role in venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk, however established risk factors in European populations do not translate to individuals of African descent due to differences in allele frequencies between populations. As part of the fifth iteration of the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation, participants were asked to predict VTE status in exome data from African American subjects. Participants were provided with 103 unlabeled exomes from patients treated with warfarin for non-VTE causes or VTE and asked to predict which disease each subject had been treated for. Given the lack of training data, many participants opted to use unsupervised machine learning methods, clustering the exomes by variation in genes known to be associated with VTE. The best performing method using only VTE related genes achieved an AUC of 0.65. Here we discuss the range of methods used in the prediction of VTE from sequence data and explore some of the difficulties of conducting a challenge with known confounders. Additionally, we show that an existing genetic risk score for VTE that was developed in European subjects works well in African Americans. This article is protected by copyright.

Data-driven methods hold promise for systematically deriving rules underlying the relationship between protein structure and function. However, the choice of protein structural representation is critical. Pre-defined biochemical features emphasize certain aspects of protein properties while ignoring others, and therefore may fail to capture critical information in complex protein sites.RESULTS: In this paper, we present a general framework that applies 3D convolutional neural networks (3DCNNs) to structure-based protein functional site detection. The framework can extract task-dependent features automatically from the raw atom distributions. We benchmarked our method against other methods and demonstrate better or comparable performance for site detection. Our deep 3DCNNs achieved an average recall of 0.955 at a precision threshold of 0.99 on PROSITE families, detected 98.89 and 92.88% of nitric oxide synthase and TRYPSIN-like enzyme sites in Catalytic Site Atlas, and showed good performance on challenging cases where sequence motifs are absent but a function is known to exist. Finally, we inspected the individual contributions of each atom to the classification decisions and show that our models successfully recapitulate known 3D features within protein functional sites.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The 3DCNN models described in this paper are available at https://simtk.org/projects/fscnn.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31051039\n\nAbstract\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, treatment response during an initial therapeutic trial is often poor and is difficult to predict. Heterogeneity of response to SSRIs in depressed patients is partly driven by co-occurring somatic disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and obesity. CAD and obesity may also be associated with metabolic side effects of SSRIs. In this study, we assessed the association of CAD and obesity with treatment response to SSRIs in patients with MDD using a polygenic score (PGS) approach. Additionally, we performed cross-trait meta-analyses to pinpoint genetic variants underpinnings the relationship of CAD and obesity with SSRIs treatment response. First, PGSs were calculated at different p value thresholds (PT) for obesity and CAD. Next, binary logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association of the PGSs to SSRIs treatment response in a discovery sample (ISPC, N=865), and in a replication cohort (STAR*D, N=1,878). Finally, a cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis was performed by combining summary statistics. We show that the PGSs for CAD and obesity were inversely associated with SSRIs treatment response. At the most significant thresholds, the PGS for CAD and body mass index accounted 1.3%, and 0.8% of the observed variability in treatment response to SSRIs, respectively. In the cross-trait meta-analyses, we identified (1) 14 genetic loci (including NEGR1, CADM2, PMAIP1, PARK2) that are associated with both obesity and SSRIs treatment response; (2) five genetic loci (LINC01412, PHACTR1, CDKN2B, ATXN2, KCNE2) with effects on CAD and SSRIs treatment response. Our findings implicate that the genetic variants of CAD and obesity are linked to SSRIs treatment response in MDD. A better SSRIs treatment response might be achieved through a stratified allocation of treatment for MDD patients with a genetic risk for obesity or CAD.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30610379\n\nAbstract\n\nElectronic communication is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, as evidenced by its widespread and rapidly growing use. In medicine however, it remains a novel approach to reach out to patients. Yet, they have the potential for further improving current health care. Electronic platforms could support therapy adherence and communication between physicians and patients. The power of social media as well as other electronic devices can improve adherence as evidenced by the development of the app bant. Additionally, systemic analysis of social media content by Screenome can identify health events not always captured by regular health care. By better identifying these health care events we can improve our current health care system as we will be able to better tailor to the patients' needs. All these techniques are a valuable component of modern health care and will help us into the future of increasingly digital health care. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of the present study was to undertake a meta-analysis at individual patients' level to capture the possible effect of ethnicity, gene-gene interaction or other drugs on the association and to verify if inclusion of CYP4F2*3 variant into dosing algorithms improves the prediction of mean coumarin dose. We asked the authors of our previous meta-analysis (30 articles) and of 38 new articles retrieved by a systematic review to send us individual patients' data. The final collection consists 15,754 patients split into a derivation and validation cohort. The CYP4F2*3 polymorphism was consistently associated with an increase in mean coumarin dose (+9% (95%CI 7-10%), with a higher effect in females, in patients taking acenocoumarol and in Whites. The inclusion of the CYP4F2*3 in dosing algorithms slightly improved the prediction of stable coumarin dose. New pharmacogenetic equations potentially useful for clinical practice were derived.

Current population grouping methods to communicate these patterns are insufficient as they are inconsistent and fail to reflect the global distribution of genetic variability. To facilitate and standardize the reporting of variability in pharmacogenetic allele frequencies, we present seven geographically-defined groups: American, Central/South Asian, East Asian, European, Near Eastern, Oceanian, and Sub-Saharan African, and two admixed groups: African American/Afro-Caribbean and Latino. These nine groups are defined by global autosomal genetic structure and based on data from large-scale sequencing initiatives. We recognize that broadly grouping global populations is an oversimplification of human diversity and does not capture complex social and cultural identity. However, these groups meet a key need in pharmacogenetics research by enabling consistent communication of the scale of variability in global allele frequencies and are now used by PharmGKB.

An incomplete understanding of how drugs exert their effects hinders regulatory and pharmaceutical industry projections of a drug's benefits and risks. Signaling pathways mediate drug response and while many signaling molecules have been characterized for their contribution to disease or their role in drug side effects, our knowledge of these pathways is incomplete. To better understand all signaling molecules involved in drug response and the phenotype associations of these molecules, we created a novel method, PathFX, a non-commercial entity, to identify these pathways and drug-related phenotypes. We benchmarked PathFX by identifying drugs' marketed disease indications and reported a sensitivity of 41%, a 2.7-fold improvement over similar approaches. We then used PathFX to strengthen signals for drug-adverse event pairs occurring in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and also identified opportunities for drug repurposing for new diseases based on interaction paths that associated a marketed drug to that disease. By discovering molecular interaction pathways, PathFX improved our understanding of drug associations to safety and efficacy phenotypes. The algorithm may provide a new means to improve regulatory and therapeutic development decisions.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30532240\n\nAbstract\n\nFor almost two decades, pioglitazone has been prescribed primarily to prevent and treat insulin resistance in some type 2 diabetic patients. In this review, we trace the path to discovery of pioglitazone as a thiazolidinedione compound, the glitazone tracks through the regulatory agencies, the trek to molecular agonism in the nucleus and the binding of pioglitazone to the nuclear receptor PPAR gamma. Given the rise in consumption of pioglitazone in T2D patients worldwide and the increased number of clinical trials currently testing alternate medical uses for this drug, there is also merit to some reflection on the reported adverse effects. Going forward, it is imperative to continue investigations into the mechanisms of actions of pioglitazone, the potential of glitazone drugs to contribute to unmet needs in complex diseases associated with the dynamics of adaptive homeostasis, and also the routes to minimizing adverse effects in every-day patients throughout the world.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fphar.2018.01093\n\nView details for PubMedID 30337873\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6180177\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Analyzing the human transcriptome is crucial in advancing precision medicine, and the plethora of over half a million human microarray samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has enabled us to better characterize biological processes at the molecular level. However, transcriptomic analysis is challenging because the data is inherently noisy and high-dimensional. Gene set analysis is currently widely used to alleviate the issue of high dimensionality, but the user-defined choice of gene sets can introduce biasness in results. In this paper, we advocate the use of a fixed set of transcriptomic modules for such analysis. We apply independent component analysis to the large collection of microarray data in GEO in order to discover reproducible transcriptomic modules that can be used as features for machine learning. We evaluate the usability of these modules across six studies, and demonstrate (1) their usage as features for sample classification, and also their robustness in dealing with small training sets, (2) their regularization of data when clustering samples and (3) the biological relevancy of differentially expressed features.RESULTS: We identified 139 reproducible transcriptomic modules, which we term fundamental components (FCs). In studies with less than 50 samples, FC-space classification model outperformed their gene-space counterparts, with higher sensitivity (p<0.01). The models also had higher accuracy and negative predictive value (p<0.01) for small data sets (less than 30 samples). Additionally, we observed a reduction in batch effects when data is clustered in the FC-space. Finally, we found that differentially expressed FCs mapped to GO terms that were also identified via traditional gene-based approaches.CONCLUSIONS: The 139 FCs provide biologically-relevant summarization of transcriptomic data, and their performance in low sample settings suggest that they should be employed in such studies in order to harness the data efficiently.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30223787\n\nAbstract\n\nMotivation: Kinases play a significant role in diverse disease signaling pathways and understanding kinase inhibitor selectivity, the tendency of drugs to bind to off-targets, remains a top priority for kinase inhibitor design and clinical safety assessment. Traditional approaches for kinase selectivity analysis using biochemical activity and binding assays are useful but can be costly and are often limited by the kinases that are available. On the other hand, current computational kinase selectivity prediction methods are computational intensive and can rarely achieve sufficient accuracy for large-scale kinome wide inhibitor selectivity profiling.Results: Here, we present a KinomeFEATURE database for kinase binding site similarity search by comparing protein microenvironments characterized using diverse physiochemical descriptors. Initial selectivity prediction of 15 known kinase inhibitors achieved an>90% accuracy and demonstrated improved performance in comparison to commonly used kinase inhibitor selectivity prediction methods. Additional kinase ATP binding site similarity assessment (120 binding sites) identified 55 kinases with significant promiscuity and revealed unexpected inhibitor cross-activities between PKR and FGFR2 kinases. Kinome-wide selectivity profiling of 11 kinase drug candidates predicted novel as well as experimentally validated off-targets and suggested structural mechanisms of kinase cross-activities. Our study demonstrated potential utilities of our approach for large-scale kinase inhibitor selectivity profiling that could contribute to kinase drug development and safety assessment.Availability: The KinomeFEATURE database are available at https://simtk.org/projects/kdb.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29985971\n\nAbstract\n\nThe P2Y12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel is widely used in patients with acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ischemic stroke. Platelet inhibition by clopidogrel shows wide interpatient variability, and high on-treatment platelet reactivity is a risk factor for atherothrombotic events, particularly in high-risk populations. CYP2C19 polymorphism plays an important role in this variability, but heritability estimates suggest that additional genetic variants remain unidentified. The aim of the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC) is to identify genetic determinants of clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical response.Based on the data published on www.clinicaltrials.gov, clopidogrel intervention studies containing genetic and platelet function data were identified for participation. Lead investigators were invited to share DNA samples, platelet function test results, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular outcomes to perform candidate gene and genome-wide studies.In total, 17 study sites from 13 countries participate in the ICPC, contributing individual patient data from 8,829 patients. Available adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelet function tests included vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay, light transmittance aggregometry, and the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. A proof-of-principle analysis based on genotype data provided by each group showed a strong and consistent association between CYP2C19*2 and platelet reactivity (P value=5.1 × 10-40).The ICPC aims to identify new loci influencing clopidogrel efficacy by using state-of-the-art genetic approaches in a large cohort of clopidogrel-treated patients to better understand the genetic basis of on-treatment response variability.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29653637\n\nAbstract\n\nGene-based supervised machine learning classification models have been widely used to differentiate disease states, predict disease progression and determine effective treatment options. However, many of these classifiers are sensitive to noise and frequently do not replicate in external validation sets. For complex, heterogeneous diseases, these classifiers are further limited by being unable to capture varying combinations of genes that lead to the same phenotype. Pathway-based classification can overcome these challenges by using robust, aggregate features to represent biological mechanisms. In this work, we developed a novel pathway-based approach, PRObabilistic Pathway Score, which uses genes to calculate individualized pathway scores for classification. Unlike previous individualized pathway-based classification methods that use gene sets, we incorporate gene interactions using probabilistic graphical models to more accurately represent the underlying biology and achieve better performance. We apply our method to differentiate two similar complex diseases, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are the two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using five IBD datasets, we compare our method against four gene-based and four alternative pathway-based classifiers in distinguishing CD from UC. We demonstrate superior classification performance and provide biological insight into the top pathways separating CD from UC.PROPS is available as a R package, which can be downloaded at http://simtk.org/home/props or on Bioconductor.rbaltman@stanford.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29048458\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5860179\n\nAbstract\n\nStudies reported a strong genetic correlation between the Big Five personality traits and major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, personality traits are thought to be associated with response to antidepressants treatment that might partly be mediated by genetic factors. In this study, we examined whether polygenic scores (PGSs) derived from the Big Five personality traits predict treatment response and remission in patients with MDD who were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on these traits to identify genetic variants underpinning the cross-trait polygenic association. The PGS analysis was performed using data from two cohorts: the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS, n = 529) and the International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC, n = 865). The cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses were conducted by combining GWAS summary statistics on SSRIs treatment outcome and on the personality traits. The results showed that the PGS for openness and neuroticism were associated with SSRIs treatment outcomes at p < 0.05 across PT thresholds in both cohorts. A significant association was also found between the PGS for conscientiousness and SSRIs treatment response in the PGRN-AMPS sample. In the cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses, we identified eight loci associated with (a) SSRIs response and conscientiousness near YEATS4 gene and (b) SSRI remission and neuroticism eight loci near PRAG1, MSRA, XKR6, ELAVL2, PLXNC1, PLEKHM1, and BRUNOL4 genes. An assessment of a polygenic load for personality traits may assist in conjunction with clinical data to predict whether MDD patients might respond favorably to SSRIs.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29559929\n\nAbstract\n\nOur goal is to answer the question: compared with experimental structures, how useful are predicted models for functional annotation? We assessed the functional utility of predicted models by comparing the performances of a suite of methods for functional characterization on the predictions and the experimental structures. We identified 28 sites in 25 protein targets to perform functional assessment. These 28 sites included nine sites with known ligand binding (holo-sites), nine sites that are expected or suggested by experimental authors for small molecule binding (apo-sites), and Ten sites containing important motifs, loops, or key residues with important disease-associated mutations. We evaluated the utility of the predictions by comparing their microenvironments to the experimental structures. Overall structural quality correlates with functional utility. However, the best-ranked predictions (global) may not have the best functional quality (local). Our assessment provides an ability to discriminate between predictions with high structural quality. When assessing ligand-binding sites, most prediction methods have higher performance on apo-sites than holo-sites. Some servers show consistently high performance for certain types of functional sites. Finally, many functional sites are associated with protein-protein interaction. We also analyzed biologically relevant features from the protein assemblies of two targets where the active site spanned the protein-protein interface. For the assembly targets, we find that the features in the models are mainly determined by the choice of template.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28975675\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5820171\n\nAbstract\n\nDrug discovery and development is commonly schematized as a \"pipeline,\" and, although appreciated by drug developers to be a useful oversimplification, this cartology may perpetuate inaccurate notions of straightforwardness and is of minimal utility for process engineering to improve efficiency.

Determining the risk factors associated with reversals in LST goals can improve patient and provider appreciation for the natural history and epidemiology of critical care and inform decision making around the (continued) use of LSTs.This is a single institution retrospective cohort study of patients receiving life sustaining treatment in an academic tertiary hospital from 2009 to 2013. Deidentified patient electronic medical record data was collected via the clinical data warehouse to study the outcomes of treatment limiting Comfort Care and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. Extended multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the association of patient and clinical factors with subsequent treatment limiting orders.10,157 patients received life-sustaining treatment while initially Full Code (allowing all resuscitative measures). Of these, 770 (8.0%) transitioned to Comfort Care (with discontinuation of any life-sustaining treatments) while 1,669 (16%) patients received new DNR orders that reflect preferences to limit further life-sustaining treatment options. Patients who were older (Hazard Ratio(HR) 1.37 [95% CI 1.28-1.47] per decade), with cerebrovascular disease (HR 2.18 [95% CI 1.69-2.81]), treated by the Medical ICU (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.49-2.49]) and Hematology-Oncology (HR 1.87 [95% CI 1.27-2.74]) services, receiving vasoactive infusions (HR 1.76 [95% CI 1.28, 2.43]) or continuous renal replacement (HR 1.83 [95% CI 1.34, 2.48]) were more likely to transition to Comfort Care. Any new DNR orders were more likely for patients who were older (HR 1.43 [95% CI 1.38-1.48] per decade), female (HR 1.30 [95% CI 1.17-1.44]), with cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.25-1.67]) or metastatic solid cancers (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.48-2.49]), or treated by Medical ICU (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.42-1.86]), Hematology-Oncology (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.33-1.98]) and Cardiac Care Unit-Heart Failure (HR 1.41 [95% CI 1.15-1.72]).Decisions to reverse or limit treatment goals occurs after more than 1 in 13 trials of LST, and is associated with older female patients, receiving non-ventilator forms of LST, cerebrovascular disease, and treatment by certain medical specialty services.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29489814\n\nAbstract\n\nMotivation: The biomedical community's collective understanding of how chemicals, genes, and phenotypes interact is distributed across the text of over 24 million research articles. These interactions offer insights into the mechanisms behind higher order biochemical phenomena, such as drug-drug interactions and variations in drug response across individuals. To assist their curation at scale, we must understand what relationship types are possible and map unstructured natural language descriptions onto these structured classes.Methods: We used NCBI's PubTator annotations to identify instances of chemical, gene and disease names in Medline abstracts and applied the Stanford dependency parser to find connecting dependency paths between pairs of entities in single sentences. We combined a published ensemble biclustering algorithm (EBC) with hierarchical clustering to group the dependency paths into semantically-related categories, which we annotated with labels, or \"themes\" (\"inhibition\" and \"activation\", for example). We evaluated our theme assignments against six human-curated databases: DrugBank, Reactome, SIDER, the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), OMIM, and PharmGKB.Results: Clustering revealed 10 broad themes for chemical-gene relationships, 7 for chemical-disease, 10 for gene-disease and 9 for gene"
