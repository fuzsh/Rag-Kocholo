        "text": "Three years after going public as a couple, Adele and Rich Paul are not just going strong, but engaged to be married.\n\nThe singer and the NBA agent first met at a mutual friend’s birthday party, Adele revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone. By the summer of 2021, they had embarked on a serious romance.\n\nPaul was the first—and only—personAdele dated after her divorce from Simon Konecki—with whom the singer spent more than six years (and who inspired her 2021 heartbreak album 30)—and while the two have kept their relationship largely private, glimpses from public outings and candid interviews suggest it is the kind of romance that is made to last.\n\nBelow, see all the major highlights from their relationship.\n\nAugust 9, 2024: Adele confirms their engagement.\n\nThe superstar confirms her engagement to Paul at a concert in Germany.\n\nResponding to a fan’s sign that reads, “Will you marry me?” Adele says, “I can’t marry you, because I’m already getting married.” She then holds up her left hand to flash her engagement ring.\n\nJuly 26, 2024: Adele sparks engagement rumors again.\n\nEngagement rumors swirl once again, after Adele is seen wearing a massive diamond on the ring finger of her left hand, as show in photos published by People. It’s unclear if the ring is the same Lorraine Schwartz piece she wore to the 2022 BRIT Awards—which sparked major engagement rumors then, too.\n\nJuly 20, 2024: Adele and Rich go to a women’s basketball game.\n\nAdele and Paul are back to being the most stylish couple sitting courtside. This time, they attend a women’s basketball game in London between Team USA and South Sudan.\n\nThe singer wears a firehouse-red jacket with black trousers and shiny black slingback pumps. Paul opts for a black cap, a baggy black jacket, light gray jeans, and polished black leather dress shoes.\n\nMay 17, 2024: Adele sends love to Rich’s daughter.\n\nDuring her Friday show as part of her Weekends With Adele residency in Las Vegas, the singer shouts out Paul’s daughter, Reonna Simone Paul, who has just graduated college.\n\n“It is my stepdaughter’s graduation this weekend,” Adele is heard saying in a . “Her name is Reonna. So I love you, darling. Congratulations.”\n\nAdele notes that Reonna is the first member of her family to graduate from college—specifically, Clark Atlanta University—and says Paul is in Atlanta celebrating with his daughter. “And obviously I’m here with you—wouldn’t be anywhere else—but I love you, baby. I love you!” she adds.\n\nThe couple sit courtside at Los Angeles’s Crypto.com Arena to watch the NBA playoffs between the Lakers and the Nuggets.\n\nFor the occasion, Adele looks classy in a bead-embellished black blazer, a white T-shirt, black pants, and white pumps. Paul wears a collared denim jacket, a black T-shirt, black leather pants, black sneakers, and a black and white baseball cap.\n\nDecember 7, 2023: Adele opens up about getting emotional while reading Rich’s memoir.\n\nIn a conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Adele reveals her emotional reaction to reading certain parts of Paul’s memoir, Lucky Me: A Memoir of Changing the Odds, released in October.\n\n“Rich and I have always known everything about each other since the day we got together,” she says. “It was very emotional reading about his mum, because obviously she’s not with us, so I’ve never met her. And she’s such a big part of Rich and the kids and the kids’ mum’s life and stuff like that. But I knew all about it. I’m getting a bit emotional. [Starts crying.] It was hard for him to write that.”\n\nShe also mentions something mysterious Paul has experienced.\n\n“Every time Rich travels, the airplanes always play my music,” she says. “We can’t work out if it’s because they know that we are together, or if it’s just what they do.”\n\nOctober 9, 2023: Rich responds to those marriage rumors.\n\nAfter Adele refers to Paul as her “husband” and to herself as his “wife,” the sports agent provides some context. Talking to Gayle King in an appearance on CBS Mornings, he says the relationship has “been great,” adding, “I think she would agree that we definitely helped each other.”\n\n“We’re in a good space. Happy,” he continues. “She’s superb. We’ve been great for each other.”\n\nHe still, however, does not clarify whether he and the singer are married, but simply notes that he’s “not the type of person” to put his personal life out in the open.\n\nSeptember 2023: Adele sparks marriage speculation.\n\nDuring weekend 27 of her Las Vegas residency, the singer has an interesting conversation with a fan, in which she refers to Paul as her husband.\n\nIt all happens when a female fan asks Adele to marry her. “You can’t marry me—I’m straight, my love. And my husband’s here tonight, he’s here,” Adele tells the fan.\n\n“Can you try?” the fan then asks. “No, I don’t want to try, I’m with Rich. You’re crazy! Leave me alone,” Adele replies jokingly.\n\nThe moment is captured by an onlooker on TikTok:\n\nDays later, the singer sparks marriage speculation again when she calls herself a “wife.”\n\nDuring her Weekends With Adele residency at the Colosseum in Las Vegas on September 23, Adele jokes that she’s not the best partner to the sports agent, as she doesn’t particularly understand or love football. She says, “[I’m] not the greatest wife, really, when it comes to football—even though my partner absolutely loves it.”\n\nAugust 2023: Adele reveals she wants to have more kids.\n\nIn captured during one of her Las Vegas concerts, Adele told a pregnant fan, “I really want to be a mum again soon, so I’ve actually been writing a list [of baby names].”\n\nShe continued, “Every time I see a name that I like, I write it down on my phone.”\n\nThe fan asked Adele to help her decide between two baby names: Parker or Spencer. “Well, I can’t say Parker because Rich likes that name,” the singer responded. “I’ll say Spencer. I like Spencer.”\n\nDecember 2022: Adele sings happy birthday to her boyfriend.\n\nAdele paused her show during one of her Las Vegas concerts to serenade Paul for his birthday. In a sweet video captured by a fan, she says, “I love you more than life itself. We wish you a happy birthday.” Adele and the stadium full of fans then launch into a dramatic rendition of the classic happy birthday song.\n\nAugust 2022: Adele talks marriage and family.\n\nAdele—who shares nine-year-old son Angelo Adkins with ex-husband Konecki—shares her hopeful plans to remarry and have more kids following her split from Konecki, presumably this time around with Paul.\n\nIn a new cover interview with Elle, the singer affirms her deep love and appreciation for her boyfriend and says that she’s “absolutely” hoping to marry again soon and expand her family. “I’m a homemaker and I’m a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music,” she tells the magazine. And of her romance with Paul, she adds, “I’ve never been in love like this. I’m obsessed with him.”\n\nThe singer also specifies that she and Paul have not actually tied the knot yet. “I’m not married. I’m not married!” she says. ”I’m just in loooove! I’m happy as I’ll ever be.”\n\n“I definitely would like a couple more kids. It would be wonderful if we can,” the singer also reveals, in an appearance on BBC podcast Desert Island Discs back in July. “If not, I’ve got Angelo. I just want to be happy.”\n\nJune 2022: Rich hints at having more kids.\n\nParenting seems to be on the radar for both parties. In an exclusive interview with E! News, the agent talks fatherhood and reflects on what he plans to do differently as a parent. “If I was to have more kids, I’m looking forward to being a different dad,” Paul tells the outlet, adding that he vows to be a “more patient dad” if he gets the chance to be.\n\nMay 2022: Adele commemorates their first anniversary.\n\nOn May 11, the singer commemorates her first year of romance with Paul in a carousel post on Instagram featuring a romantic series of photos of the two looking affectionate. “Time flies,” she writes in the caption.\n\nThe photos also seem to confirm that the two have at some point taken the big step to purchase a home together—as shown by the post’s cover photo of the two holding up keys in front of their new mansion in Beverly Hills.\n\nNovember 2021: Adele gushes over their romance.\n\nIn a new CBS special, Adele reveals that her relationship with Paul has been the first in which she has loved herself enough to also fully love her partner. “It’d be interesting to see what my reaction is like in general to anything that hurts me now that I feel so secure in myself, and I’m talking outside of romance as well,” she says.\n\n”He’s just hilarious. Oh, he’s so funny, he’s hilarious, yeah. And very smart. You know, he’s very, very smart,” she also says. ”It’s quite incredible watching him do what he does.”\n\nEarlier this month, paparazzi photos also reveal the singer and the sports agent heading home from a filming session for Adele’s TV special, An Audience With Adele—an appearance that also marks her first performance in four years.\n\nOctober 2021: Adele gets candid about their bond.\n\nAdele opens up about her healthy, loving relationship with Paul in a cover interview—explaining how her 33 years of living and recent divorce have helped her see that this is what she truly wants. “I don’t feel anxious or nervous or frazzled,” she says. “It’s quite the opposite. It’s wild. … I’m a 33-year-old divorced mother of a son, who’s actually in charge. The last thing I need is someone who doesn't know where they’re at, or what they want. I know what I want. And I really know what I don’t want.”\n\nThe singer adds, “I just love being around him. I just love it.”\n\nSeptember 2021: Adele debuts Rich on social media.\n\nAdele goes official with Paul on Instagram with a sweet, affectionate shot of the two inside a photo booth at Paul’s client Anthony Davis’s wedding.\n\n“They were so nice,” a family member of the bride tells Us Weekly of the two at ceremony. “[Paul] was at the table the whole time, and he let her just do whatever she wanted. … She was dancing with everybody. They would hug at the table. They’re a nice couple.”\n\nJuly 2021: They make their public debut, and sources confirm they’ve been dating for months.\n\nThe pair go unintentionally public with their romance in Phoenix, where the two are captured getting cuddly courtside during a game between the Phoenix Suns and the Milwaukee Bucks at the NBA Finals.\n\nInsiders at Us Weekly and People then confirm that the two have been dating officially for several months, traveling coast to coast between New York and Los Angeles to make things work.\n\nFollowing their appearance, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst explicitly refers to Adele as Paul's girlfriend on The Lowe Post, adding, “This is the first time that they’ve come out in public together.”\n\nMay 2021: Rich reveals that they’re hanging out.\n\nIn a profile for , the NBA sports agent first reveals that he’s seeing a “major pop star” whom we now know to be Adele—because “Why not?” he adds. However, Paul makes it a point to clarify that the two are not yet officially dating at this time. “I’m not dating, I’m single,” he says. “Put that in the story.”"
