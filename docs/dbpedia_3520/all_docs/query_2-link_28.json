        "text": "In a career spanning more than 25 years, Joe Henry has left an indelible and unique imprint on American popular music. As a songwriter and artist, Henry is celebrated for his exploration of the human experience. A hyper-literate storyteller, by turns dark, devastating, and hopeful, he draws an author’s eye for the overlooked detail across a broad swath of American musical styles — rock, jazz and blues — rendering genre modifiers useless.\n\nHenry has collaborated with many notable American artists on his own body of work, from T Bone Burnett, Daniel Lanois, and Van Dyke Parks on one side of the spectrum, to Don Cherry, Ornette Coleman, Brad Mehldau, and Bill Frisell on the other. A three-time-Grammy-winning producer, Henry has made records for Bonnie Raitt, Hugh Laurie, Lisa Hannigan, Elvis Costello, Rhiannon Giddens and Solomon Burke among many others.\n\nAdditionally, Henry has taken his musical talents to film and television. He has scored music for the films Jesus’ Son, Knocked Up, and Motherhood, as well as produced tracks for the film I’m Not There. His song “Stars” was featured in the closing credits in the fourth season of HBO’s Six Feet Under.\n\nIn 2013, Algonquin Press published, “Furious Cool: Richard Pryor and the World that Made Him,” a book co-written by Joe and his brother Dave Henry.\n\nIn 2016, Henry teamed up with Billy Bragg on the collaborative album Shine A Light: Field Recordings From The Great American Railroad. The pair were subsequently nominated as “Duo/Group of the Year” by the Americana Music Association.\n\nAmerican Songwriter called his 2017 release Thrum “Audacious and auspicious…akin to Van Morrison at his most impressionistic.”\n\nHenry released his 15th solo album The Gospel According To Water on November 15th 2019 :\n\n“These are simple, wise and sonically gorgeous songs.”—Rosanne Cash“\n\nHere is the voice of a friend and brother who had been away too long. There is enough anger, enough misery in the world. Too many tears, fires and trampled flowers, so make room in your life for some beauty like this.”—Elvis Costello“.\n\nIn every track, there is gentleness and strength. His music is poetry.”-Gloria Steinem\n\nIncluded in Barack Obama’s Favorite Music of 2019+ New York Times Best Songs of 2019\n\nHenry’s 16th solo album “All The Eye Can See” will be released January 27th 2023. Henry is joined by more than 20 musicians, among them his trusted long-time musical companions and friends – his son Levon Henry on saxophone & clarinet, David Piltch on bass, Patrick Warren on piano & keys and John Smith on acoustic guitar.\n\nIt is an intimate album, highly emotional, amazingly quiet and beautiful, and relaxed, with simple yet skillful tunes, touching lyrics featuring 12 new and unforgettable songs, framed by an instrumental prelude and prologue."
