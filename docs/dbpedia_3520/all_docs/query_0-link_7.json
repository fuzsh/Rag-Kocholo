When Don's fiancée, Trixie Lane, warns Nancy away from Don, Nancy becomes more interested in him and agrees to date him. After eight weeks, however, Don loses interest in Nancy and her roommate, Buddy, advises her to seek love in someone more reliable, like Nancy's boss, insurance agent Dave Walton. Nancy accepts Dave's invitation to play tennis, and later makes an evening date with him. When Don appears unexpectedly that same evening, however, Nancy agrees to go for a drive with him, then misses her date with Dave when Don's car breaks down. After his car is repaired, Don takes her to meet his mother, and Mrs. Blair assumes that Nancy is a relation of the \"Chicago Tiltons,\" a wealthy family of lawyers. Nancy maintains the pretense, although she is uncomfortable with the lie. Later that evening, Dave accepts Nancy's apology for standing him up and promises to ask her out again. Nancy reveals her true heritage to Buddy when she tells her that her parents were separated before she was born, and that she could not be affiliated with the Chicago Tiltons or else her mother would have told her before she died. The next day, Don and Nancy become engaged, and a typist's stolen purse is found on Nancy's desk a short time later. Although she is blamed for the theft, Don stands up for her and the incident passes. Don accuses Trixie of setting Nancy up, but she refuses to confess. When Don later admits that he is attracted to Nancy for her wealthy relations and that he intends to marry her, Trixie vows to prevent the marriage. Mrs. Blair then calls Nancy to let her know that her relations have returned from Europe. Nancy is frightened by the complications of her imposture and takes a bus back to her hometown. Don takes her off the bus, however, and spends the day with her, until Trixie finds them just as Don is getting drunk. After Don returns to the city, he makes Nancy promise over the telephone not to tell anyone he was with her that Sunday. Shortly thereafter, Nancy is arrested for a robbery at Blair, Benn and Co. Dave bails her out of jail and promises his help. When police question Nancy and Don about their whereabouts on the Sunday the office was robbed, Don lies. After Nancy finally admits she was with Don, the police discover that the guard was in collusion with his brother-in-law, who robbed the office. Both men are then arrested. Finally, John Tilton of the Chicago Tiltons shows up and tells Nancy that he is her father, but Nancy says she is not a Tilton anymore as she married Dave that morning. Trixie then leaves happily with Don.\n\nLess"
