        "text": "This week's My School takes us to Bishop Grimes where the football team is making sure that after a hiatus in 2010, they're back on the field in 2011.\n\nHere's our news coverage from Monday:\n\nEAST SYRACUSE -- It was news that devastated all of the players, in 2010, Bishop Grimes had to cancel its football season because it didnt have enough players. It was the first time since the 1960's that the Catholic school from East Syracuse wasn't able to field a team.\n\nThe seniors-to-be for next year are making sure that never happens again.\n\nHere and now in the middle of January, the Cobras were hard at work working out, preparing for season that potentially would be eight months away. It's that determination however that will make sure there is a season for Bishop Grimes in 2011. The team currently has 24 kids working out, that's roughly the number needed to field a team. Current members are also recruiting other students to play, and Coach Jeff Smith tells us there's more members of the team that just have to re-join team activities.\n\nAll in all, the Bishop Grimes football team is showing its true colors. Sure, they were dealt a really tough blow not having a season in 2010. But look at their reaction. They didn't just roll over and take the news lying down, they fought the news, and all signs are pointing to a return to action in 2011."
