        "text": "Dominik Greco, 2024 Kicker. As a senior kicker, I have unfortunately just realized my talents and I am willing to work as hard as possible to get to my best possible form. I am extremely coachable, as I believe that there is always more room for improvement. Currently, my longest field goal off of the ground without pads is 50 yards. Off a one-inch tee, I have kicked 52 with full pads. I believe that consistency is the key to success. Please feel free to check out my Hudl and Twitter accounts, as I have uploaded film and videos of my training. Thank you."
