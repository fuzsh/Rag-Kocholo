        "text": "I am 5'11 165 pounds and run an unofficial 4.4. My most important accomplishments in my life so far has been, graduating from Bishop Grimes Jr/Sr High in 2010. That was a good year for me academically and athletically. The most important accomplishment athletically for me was breaking the school's record for most receiving yards in a season in which I had 1430. This was a big accomplishment because it got me second on the all-time list in NYS for receiving yards in a season. What I can bring to the table for a football program is my character and my work ethic. I strive to be the best and want my teammates to want to strive based off what they see me doing to better myself and the team as a whole. I work hard on and off the field in the weight room and just as hard in the classroom. It has always been my dream to play football on the D1 level like its every football players dream but I’m just trying to get a free education and continue my football career. I am open to any school no geographic stipulations but I would like to go to a larger University. My family does need financial help we are unable to pay for college and are seeking scholarship offers from any level. I am currently taking sports management and will graduate with my associate’s degree in May 2012. My goals are to come in and earn my spot on the field and play right away and contribute like I know I can on the field and in the classroom."
