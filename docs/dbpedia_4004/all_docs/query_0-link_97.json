Jerry was predeceased by his parents, Theodore (Ted) and Ellen (Hitchcock) Davis, his brothers, James (Marjory) and John (Melia) Davis, sisters Anna Mae (Gerald) Hughes, Janet (Gene) Marsh, Mary Jane (Arnold) Miller, Sharon Davis, and brother-in-law Edward (Skip) O’Meara. Jerry is survived by his loving wife, Irene (Snider), daughter Adrienne (David) Sampson, two grandsons, Keen and Gus Sampson (Portland, OR), his sister, Eileen O’Meara (Henrietta, NY), sister-in-law Kathleen (Terry) Pawson, and brother-in-law Charles (Susan) Snider (Portland, OR). Jerry also leaves behind several nieces, nephews, cousins, and dear friends.\n\nJerry was raised in West Barre, NY and a graduate of Albion High School. Post-graduation he served in the U.S. Army, spending some time stationed in Germany. Upon discharge, Jerry began his career working for Stirling Homex in Avon, NY. After relocating to Portland, Oregon, Jerry met his future wife, Irene. Together they moved to Clearwater Beach, Florida and eventually back to her native Oregon, and settled in Portland. There, Jerry worked in the purchasing department for J&F Industries until his early retirement. Once retired, Jerry and Irene split time between their homes in Oregon and Arizona. While the Arizona climate allowed Jerry the opportunity to spend more time on the golf course, you could also find him reading, doing a daily crossword and playing cribbage with anyone who would play. Jerry and Irene also enjoyed traveling around the world. They regularly visited Mexico, and traveled to Ireland, Netherlands, France, Italy and even ventured on photo safari to South Africa. Though world-traveling was fun, Jerry’s heart and greatest joys came from being with his family. He spoke of his grandsons whenever he could, always happy to share their latest accomplishments. If he were to read this about himself, he would want to change the subject by saying, “How ’bout them Yankees?” Jerry will be missed by all who knew and loved him. We will cherish our memories until we meet again.\n\n“One day we will remember how lucky we were to have known their love, with wonder, not grief.” –unknown\n\nALBION – Justin R.
