        "text": "Originally Posted by ckhthankgod\n\nThere is plenty of this in clay and in the Northern suburbs in general. if you just go down Main Street/Brewerton Road(aka Route 11) in the village of North Syracuse, you have several Italian restaurants just along the road/street in or barely outside of the village(Basil Leaf, Utica Pizza Company, Nestico's, Twin Trees III, Grotto, Gino and Joe's Pizza, Sorrento's, Gino's Original Cheese Steaks, Pies Guys, Toss 'n' Fire Wood-Fired Pizza, etc.). There's also Vince's Gourmet Imports and Mario's Bakery in that area as well.\n\nThen, along Route 57 in the Liverpool SD portion of Clay, you have Canale's(original is in Oswego), Avicolli's, Nick and Angelo's, Antonio's Liverpool Pizzeria, Twin Trees 57 and Cam's Pizzeria near Route 31. Santangelo's is a popular Italian restaurant in the Liverpool area(in the town of Salina though) nearby, with a few places in the village of Liverpool as well.\n\nYou also can go into the Northside of the city where there are several more Italian restaurants/spots as well in Little Italy(Attilio's, Asti, Francesca's, Biscotti Bakery, etc.) or Angotti's, Dominick's, Casa Di Copani, Gianni's Bronx Style Pizza(I don't think it is Italian owned, but is good), Pappy's Ice Cream and Tony's(owned by the Albanese family) on Burnet Avenue. There's also Peppino's, NY Roast/Little Mac's Pizzeria and Change of Pace Sport's Bar(I believe owned by Jason Grilli's dad) on Grant Boulevard.\n\nIn Lyncourt, a CDP in the town of Salina and a community with one of the highest Italian percentages in the country, you have Lyncourt Bakery and the Italian American Athletic Club. Nearby Eastwood in the NE corner of the city, has an Original Italian Pizza(a local chain) and a few other places on James Street.\n\nSolvay, a blue collar, working/middle class suburb just west of Syracuse, also has a few places and it is home to the Tyrol Club, which is a region of Italy(and Germany) where many of the Italians in that community come from. It also has one of the highest Italian percentages for a municipality/community in the country.\n\nSo, you have plenty to chose from in the immediate area and there are others that I left out.\n\nOriginally Posted by ckhthankgod\n\nI know this thread is about Clay, but I just wanted to show a side of Solvay that isn't usually thought of and it is the Piercefield area in the southern portion of the village(was mentioned in the Hidden Gems thread). Here are some street views of that area: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0528...7i13312!8i6656\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0525...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0518...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0539...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0514...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nThis little area south of West Genesee Street is also in the village: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0458...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0457...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nAnother part of the village in its western end: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0568...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0585...6!9m2!1b1!2i40\n\nSo, in spite of its reputation of being blue collar, there are some nice, solid parts of the village as well.\n\nIn terms of Lyncourt, there are some nice, solid streets south of Court Street/west of Teall Avenue like this one: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0826...7i13312!8i6656\n\nOr here: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0816...7i13312!8i6656\n\nAlso, Lyncourt, which has its own K-8th grade school district, has its students attend Solvay High for public school or some may send their children to a Catholic school like Bishop Grimes Jr./Sr. High in the nearby East Syracuse area.
