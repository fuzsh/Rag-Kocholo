        "text": "If I could ZERO stars for SAFETY and ADMINISTRATION I would. They allow teachers who have past criminal histories to work here and when inappropriate behavior between a teacher and a student unfolds they run! No support for the family or student. Complete denial.\n\nBoth of our children graduated from Bishop Grimes. It was a very rewarding experience for both! The smaller class size, the genuine commitment of the administration and teachers, the course offerings and the importance of their faith development were of primary importance to us! Bishop Grimes more than provided on all counts! That is why we are overjoyed that now our grandchildren have had the same opportunity to attend BG! Our granddaughter graduated in June and is now a freshman in college studying Elementary Education. Because of her preparedness, she received numerous scholarship offers from various colleges! Our grandson is a junior at Grimes and thriving in academics, sports and music! Bishop Grimes continues to serve God and families in the finest ideals! Go Cobras!"
