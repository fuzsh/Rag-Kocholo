        "text": "We’ve got class. Our public schools consistently rank high in national listings. And, the area is rich in colleges and universities, including Syracuse University, Hamilton College, Le Moyne College, Onondaga Community College, State University of New York at Oswego., and State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry.\n\nA community is only as strong as its education system\n\nAfter all, today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders. You don’t have to go far to find many of the best colleges and universities in the nation and award-winning elementary and secondary schools; in fact, you have an abundance of choices.\n\nWhen you do your research, you’ll find high test scores at every grade level, teachers with advanced degrees, and programs not common in many other states. You’ll see the arts taught and performed at a high level. You’ll see that Advanced Placement classes are common in CNY high schools. You’ll see partnerships with local college, like Syracuse University’s SUPA program giving students college rigor and college credit. Outside of school, you’ll see support for library systems, for science and art, and for extracurricular activities throughout the region. You’ll find businesses and universities that welcome all kinds of partnerships with schools to give students real-world experiences in diverse fields.\n\nIn New York, children go to the public schools in the district where they live. Cities like Syracuse have a number of charter school options. In addition, the region has a wide range of private and parochial schools. At Syracuse’s Corcoran High School, students can earn a prestigious International Baccalaureate diploma. Any child in Syracuse’s public schools has the chance for tuition-free college in the Say Yes to Education program. In East Syracuse-Minoa, you’ll see innovative programs, especially in STEM fields, starting in the youngest grades. The region is rich in competitions from rockets to engineering, math to the arts, from Model U.N. to performing arts, marching bands, and athletics.\n\nFamilies also have the option of private schools. Manlius Pebble Hill School is the only independent pre-k-12 school in Central New York. There are several religious schools including Bishop Ludden, Bishop Grimes, Christian Brothers Academy, Immaculate Heart Central, Notre Dame, and Mynderse Academy.\n\n“A lot of people we’ve met have come from other places and are very happy with the school system.”\n\nWhen Pamela Puri and her husband moved to CNY from Boston, they wondered about school quality. They were moving their three children, grades 4 and younger, from a system considered one of the best in the country. Pamela did her research, confirmed results with real estate agents, and was pleased with what she found – CNY schools surpassed the system her family left.\n\nPamela’s advice? “I think everyone should do their research,” she said. “I researched and researched. I would not make a decision on someone just saying schools are great.” Now, she loves her children’s school. It’s a large district, but she said teachers are attentive, giving it a small-school feel. The resources are expansive. “A lot of people we’ve met have come from other places and are very happy with the school system,” she said.\n\nAdirondack SD\n\nAdirondack Central School District is a public school district located in Boonville, NY.
