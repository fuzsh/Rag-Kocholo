        "text": "In 2021, several regions around the world experienced devastating wildfire seasons. We have all read harrowing stories about the human misery and damage to property caused by intense and prolonged wildfires. Throughout the year, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service* (CAMS) has been keeping a close eye on global wildfires and their emissions. Using satellite observations of active fires, CAMS estimates the amount of pollutants they emit in near-real-time and predicts the impact on global atmospheric composition and air quality, providing data that allow decision-makers to take informed mitigating action. Let’s take a look at what the data revealed.\n\nFire animation 2021 - until 30 November\n\nAnimation of global fire activity from 01/01/2021 to 30/11/2021 showing daily fire radiative power in watts per square metre.

To put this figure into some perspective – total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel in the EU in 2020 amounted to 2600 megatonnes, in other words - wildfires this year generated 148% more than total EU fossil fuel emissions in 2020.\n\nHighest estimated emissions ever\n\nThis year’s wildfire activity in some regions around the world was at a much larger scale than previously seen in the CAMS dataset, according to ECMWF Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Senior Scientist and wildfire expert Mark Parrington. “As the year draws to a close, we have seen extensive regions experience intense and prolonged wildfire activity. Drier and hotter regional conditions under a changing climate have increased the risk of flammability and fire risk of vegetation,” he said, adding that this had led to some extremely large and fast-developing fires that persisted for a long period of time.\n\nConsequently, several regions around the globe saw some of their highest estimated emissions in 2021, based on the CAMS 19-year Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) dataset, going back to 2003. The summer of 2021 in particular experienced a number of extreme wildfires which led to the highest estimated emissions for some of the months in the CAMS GFAS dataset. Not only were extensive parts affected throughout the summer, but their persistence and intensity were remarkable. This included vast expanses in Siberia, North America, the eastern and central Mediterranean, and North Africa.\n\nJuly showed a high level of estimated emissions in the GFAS dataset, with 343 megatonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere. More than half of these emissions were due to fires in North America and Siberia, two of the worst affected areas. This followed intense and persistent fire activity in western Siberia and Canada in April, which coincided with anomalously high surface temperatures in these regions. The situation in August was even worse, with monthly total estimated emissions even higher - an estimated 378 megatonnes of carbon was released into the atmosphere globally, according to the GFAS data.\n\nSiberia\n\nA huge number of wildfires raged across areas of western Siberia, around Omsk and Tyumen, resulting in daily emissions at well above the mean of previous years in the dataset for 2003-2021. Eastern territories were not as active early in the season and this difference was clearly reflected in the surface temperature anomalies for the regions. Things changed in the summer however, and wildfires in the Sakha Republic in north-eastern Siberia set the highest summer-time total in the CAMS GFAS dataset from June to August, at more than double previous years.\n\nDaily fire intensity measured as Fire Radiative Power (FRP), which uses remotely sensed data to estimate the quantity of biomass burned, reached significantly above average levels from June right through to early September. Other regions in eastern Russia, including parts of the Arctic Circle, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Irkutsk Oblast, also experienced fires, but much less than in 2020 and 2019.\n\nNorth America\n\nWildfires burned across western parts of North America for a significant period from the end of June to late August. The worst affected areas included several provinces in Canada, as well as California and the states in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Among the fires was also the largest recorded fire in Californian state history, dubbed the Dixie Fire after the road in which it started. The Dixie Fire managed to burn through almost a million acres, before it was finally 100% contained in October.\n\nIn all, these fires released estimated total carbon emissions of approximately 83 megatonnes into the atmosphere. The high intensity and persistence of the wildfire emissions could be seen in CAMS global forecasts as a large plume of smoke crossed the North Atlantic and, mixing with wildfires from Siberia, reached western parts of the British Isles and northwest Europe in late August before travelling across large parts of Europe.\n\nThe Mediterranean\n\nMany countries around the eastern and central Mediterranean suffered several days of high intensity wildfires in July and August, leading to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (known as PM2.5) and degraded air quality. The particularly dry and hot conditions throughout the summer months provided the ideal environment for intense and long-lasting wildfires.\n\nTurkey was the worst hit in July, with CAMS GFAS data showing daily fire intensity at very high levels which were well above average for the region. Other countries also affected by the devastating wildfires included Greece, Italy, Albania, North Macedonia, Algeria and Tunisia.\n\nLeft: CAMS Daily Total Fire Radiative Power for Turkey (left) compared to the 2003-2020 mean (grey).

The haze and smoke pollution caused by this activity was clearly apparent in visible satellite imagery during October and November 2021 and has also been reflected in very high values of fine particulate matter and aerosol optical depth in the CAMS global forecasts throughout the region. This contributed to degraded air quality throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, extending from Pakistan to Bangladesh, where significant air pollution was observed, affecting millions of people.\n\nThe majority of the fires were in the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. Punjab, in particular, experienced a high number of fires and emissions - the CAMS GFAS estimated emissions for September-November were highest in 2021 for the dataset. Pakistan also experienced several days of above average fire radiative power during this period. The accumulation of air pollution and haze across the Indo-Gangetic Plain during this period was due to a combination of factors – emissions caused by agricultural activity, colder temperatures and the topography (in the image below you can see how the line of the Himalayas acts as a barrier, keeping emissions and particulate matter in place).\n\nInformed mitigating actions\n\nHigh temperatures, severe lightning, strong winds and other extreme weather events that create ideal conditions for wildfires are becoming increasingly common due to the effects of climate change. In these conditions, it is critically important for decision-makers to have access to current, accurate information on atmospheric conditions, such as that produced by CAMS, so they can take the necessary steps to protect people from the effects of degraded air quality and smoke pollution.\n\n“It is clear from 2021 that climate change is providing the ideal environments for wildfires, which can also be exacerbated by local weather conditions. As the fire season gets underway in the southern hemisphere, we will be keeping a close watch on developments. Our five-day forecasts allow decision-makers, organisations and individuals to take mitigating action in advance of any pollution incidents,” Parrington said.\n\nFind out more about fire monitoring in the CAMS Wildfire Q&As: https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/qa-wildfires\n\n*CAMS is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission."
