During fall of 2020 runways, taxiways and navigation, lighting and meteorological systems were completed and now the 5000 m2 terminal building and other administration and service buildings are ready. The inauguration of Tobolsk Airport will without doubt increase the tourist and investment attractiveness of the city, benefit the regional businesses, and improve the quality of life of the population of both city and region.\n\nConsidering the world trend of aviation traffic increase, the terminal design includes the possibility for further extension. The current layout is designed to handle 1.3 mill. passengers per year. So even though it is a small airport, it ensures great opportunities for future city development. It will also close a demand gap as the closest airport before Tobolsk Airport is more than 250 km away.\n\nApplication"
