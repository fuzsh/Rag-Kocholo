Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Tyumen is increasing during June, rising from 1% to 6% over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on July 18, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 8% of the time, while on September 17, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Tyumen is decreasing during June, decreasing from 9.9 miles per hour to 8.8 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on April 3, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.5 miles per hour, while on August 5, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.3 miles per hour.\n\nThe wind direction in Tyumen during June is predominantly out of the west from June 1 to June 21 and the north from June 21 to June 30.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Tyumen typically lasts for 4.5 months (140 days), from around May 10 to around September 27, rarely starting before April 22 or after May 30, and rarely ending before September 10 or after October 14.\n\nThe month of June in Tyumen is very likely fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season gradually increasing from 93% to 100% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in June in Tyumen\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Tyumen are increasing during June, increasing by 402Â°F, from 272Â°F to 673Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Tyumen is essentially constant during June, remaining within 0.1 kWh of 6.2 kWh throughout.\n\nThe highest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during June is 6.4 kWh on June 21.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Tyumen are 57.152 deg latitude, 65.527 deg longitude, and 262 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Tyumen contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 200 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 250 feet. Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (256 feet). Within 50 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (387 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Tyumen is covered by artificial surfaces (98%), within 10 miles by trees (35%) and grassland (33%), and within 50 miles by trees (63%) and grassland (24%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Tyumen, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere is only a single weather station, Roshchino International Airport, in our network suitable to be used as a proxy for the historical temperature and dew point records of Tyumen.\n\nAt a distance of 13 kilometers from Tyumen, closer than our threshold of 150 kilometers, this station is deemed sufficiently nearby to be relied upon as our primary source for temperature and dew point records.\n\nThe station records are corrected for the elevation difference between the station and Tyumen according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nPlease note that the station records themselves may additionally have been back-filled using other nearby stations or the MERRA-2 reanalysis.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
