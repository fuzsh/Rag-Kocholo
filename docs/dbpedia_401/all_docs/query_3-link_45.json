        "text": "Russian officials continued to order the evacuation of areas in Siberia and parts of the south as massive floods sparked by heavy rains and a rapid snowmelt show few signs of letting up.\n\nWith thousands already forced from their homes, officials in the Tyumen region of western Siberia and Kurgan in the south near the border with Kazakhstan on April 16 ordered more to leave their homes as the Ishim and Tobol rivers continue to swell.\n\n\"Pack your valuables. Leave now for a safe place, to relatives or to a temporary accommodation center,\" said Aleksander Moor, governor of the Tyumen region, adding that those who didn't abide by the \"urgent\" evacuation notice could be fined.\n\nQasym-Zhomart Toqaev on April 16 arrived in Petropavl, a city of some 20,000 people near the Ishim River where the local governor said more than 10,000 people had been evacuated as parts of the city remained under water.\n\n\"We are going through tough times. This is a disaster of a national scale,\" Toqaev told residents. \"I think the next 10 days will be critical, but we are already taking measures to rebuild the country and deal with the aftermath of this disaster.\"\n\nDozens of people whose houses were flooded in Petropavl gathered on April 16 at the city's Department of Employment and Social Programs. They said that they came to submit documents for the one-time allowance promised by the government and compensation for water losses.\n\nOne person standing in line at the agency told RFE/RL that people started gathering at 8 a.m. local time.\n\nToqaev’s office said that in order to free up money for disaster relief he had ordered the cabinet to cut all nonessential budget spending and cancel some events, including an international conference in the capital.\n\nIn Russia's Kurgan region straddling the Tobol River near the border with Kazakhstan, the region's governor, Vadim Shumkov, warned of a \"colossal\" amount of water heading toward the city of Kurgan, which has already experienced power cuts and evacuations.\n\nShmukov said the Tobol River that runs through the region could see water levels rise to 11 meters, double the level where it breaks its banks in some places along its course.\n\nMore than 125,000 people have been evacuated from areas hit by massive floods in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan in recent weeks.\n\nFollowing massive snowfalls in winter, unusually warm weather triggered the sudden melting of snow that in turn lead to the rapid swelling of rivers in what specialists say may be an effect of global climate change.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:26 0:00\n\nIn northern Kazakhstan, where more than 111,000 people have been evacuated from flood-threatened areas since the start of this month, some residents have started to return to badly damaged houses.\n\nThe first to be affected by the massive floods was the city of Orsk, followed by Orenburg, both on the Ural. Now floods have reached the Kemerovo and Tomsk regions in western Siberia.\n\nIn the Kemerovo region, the Mrassu River overflowed its banks.\n\nNikolai Patrushev, director of Russia’s Security Council, said \"huge material damage could have been minimized\" if regional authorities had paid more attention to forecasting the water levels and responding more effectively.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nJailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other women inmates in Tehran's Evin prison were injured earlier this week in clashes that erupted after a spate of executions, Mohammadi’s family says.\n\nMohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, said Mohammadi suffered breathing problems and severe chest pain after being punched in the chest and was transferred to the prison's clinic.\n\nRahmani, who spoke by phone to RFE/RL from Paris, said several women came under attack by guards during the clashes on August 6. Mohammadi was hit in her chest, and her arm was bruised, he said.\n\nThe injured women were later taken to the prison clinic for treatment and were returned to their ward.\n\nRahmani said the news agency of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps claimed the clash was a riot, but he said it should be made clear that it was a protest in which the women in Evin prison chanted in the prison yard against the death penalty.\n\nHe added that he and the rest of Mohammadi’s family were worried about her health especially because she was hit in the chest. Mohammadi had surgery for blocked arteries in 2022.\n\nRahmani added that Mohammadi, who is renowned as a staunch advocate for the Women, Life, Freedom movement, cannot contact her sister in Iran and she hasn’t been allowed to contact her children for 2 1/2 years. She also has had no contact with her lawyer.\n\n\"These restrictions make all of us worried about her situation in that ward where other women are also facing difficult conditions,\" Rahmani told RFE/RL.\n\nBefore Rahmani spoke with RFE/RL, Mohammadi's family issued a statement about the clash on August 8. It said several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten.\n\nIt said the women in Evin prison had been actively protesting against executions in Iran, and following the execution of Reza Rasaei, several prisoners gathered in the prison yard to voice their dissent, chanting slogans against the death penalty.\n\nOne woman suffered a nervous breakdown and passed out and another prisoner also fainted from the emotional strain, the statement said, adding that Mohammadi and several other prisoners protested against the locked doors that were preventing the critically ill inmates from being taken to the prison clinic.\n\nIranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place on August 6 but blamed Mohammadi for a \"provocation\" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.\n\nTwo prisoners \"had heart palpitations due to the stress,\" but medical examinations determined that their general condition \"is favorable,\" Iran's prison administration said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison for the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for \"spreading propaganda\" against the Islamic republic.\n\nThe executions that took place this week drew outrage from rights groups. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said 29 people were executed at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on August 7 alone.\n\nRasaei, 34, was the 10th man executed by Iran in connection with the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests that erupted after the death of a woman in police custody. The Iranian judiciary said Rasaei was executed on August 6.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe Qonaev City Court in Kazakhstan's southeast said on August 9 that businessman Muratkhan Toqmadi, who was sentenced in 2018 to a lengthy prison term for his alleged involvement in the killing of a banker, has been granted early release.\n\nKazakh media reports quoted sources on August 9 as saying that Toqmadi was expected to be released on August 10 -- the day a court decision made in late July will come into force.\n\nThe announcement came almost 2 1/2 years after Toqmadi called on President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev to review his case after he retracted his testimony against Mukhtar Ablyazov, a fugitive outspoken critic of Kazakhstan's government and former banker.\n\nIn a letter made public in March 2022, Toqmadi said he confessed to the killing of Erzhan Tatishev on a hunting trip in 2004 and falsely testified in 2018 that he killed Tatishev at the behest of Ablyazov because he was tortured and faced psychological pressure imposed on him by the National Security Committee.\n\nTatishev at the time was the head of TuranAlem bank, which was later renamed BTA. After Tatishev's death, which was ruled an accident at the time, Ablyazov became the bank's chief. He has been living abroad since 2009.\n\nIt remains unclear if Toqmadi was granted an early release because he had served a significant part of his term and used his right to apply for early release or because his case was revised.\n\nToqmadi’s letter to Toqaev came after deadly unrest in January that resulted in the removal of former Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev and his clan from the political scene.\n\nIn February 2018, Toqmadi, who was initially sentenced in 2017 to three years in prison for extortion and illegal firearms possession, entered a guilty plea at the murder trial, which ended with him being sentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison.\n\nIn November that year, Ablyazov was tried in absentia, convicted of murder based on Toqmadi's testimony, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn a separate trial in absentia that ended in 2017, Ablyazov was convicted of embezzlement, abuse of office, and organizing a criminal group and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nAblyazov has denied all the charges, saying they are politically motivated.\n\nWith reporting by KazTAG, Tengrinews, and Aq Zhaiyq\n\nThe United States and Britain unveiled new sanctions against Belarus on August 9 to mark the fourth anniversary of the country's disputed presidential election that returned authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka to power.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 19 people and 14 companies involved in supporting Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine by producing resources used by the military, shipping goods to Russia, evading sanctions, and generating revenue for Belarusian oligarchs in Lukashenka’s inner circle.\n\nIt also took aim at Lukashenka’s “luxury airliner,” a Boeing-767-300 owned by the Belarusian government that the Treasury Department said he uses “professionally and for his personal leisure.”\n\nPaval Latushka, head of the People's Anti-Crisis Directorate, said the sanctions meant the plane is barred from maintenance by authorized Boeing service providers, and this will create problems if it tries to land at airports outside Belarus.\n\nBradley Smith, the Treasury Department’s acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement that the sanctions were in response to the regime's \"blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts -- along with its continued support for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe U.S. designations followed fresh sanctions announced earlier on August 9 by Britain against four individuals and three businesses \"in response to human rights violations and ongoing facilitation of Russia's illegal invasion in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office noted that it issued the sanctions on the anniversary of \"the deeply flawed 2020 presidential elections in Belarus.\" It also noted that the action was taken in coordination with international partners and took the total number of sanctions imposed by Britain against Belarus to more than 200.\n\nAll four people sanctioned by Britain are present or former commanding officers of Belarusian prisons. The businesses sanctioned are involved in the country's defense and military sector.\n\nThe European Union targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week, and Canada on August 9 also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said that since the 2020 election, Lukashenka’s actions “have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus’s citizens and sovereignty.”\n\nIt said the regime continues to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations, the department said.\n\nAmong the 14 entities designated by the U.S. is Laboratory of Additive Technologies, which the department said provides Russia with components for satellite communications systems and optical equipment.\n\nThree other entities -- AlYurTekh, Diskoms, MOT, Grosver Grup, and Tochnaya Mekhanika -- were hit with sanctions for supporting what Washington said was a sanctions-evasion network supported by Peleng JSC, one of Russia’s most important industrial partners. Peleng was designated by for U.S. sanctions in December 2021.\n\nAmong the other entities are Aviakompania Rada and UE RubiStar, which the Treasury Department said are two private Belarusian cargo airline companies that have provided support to Russian defense activities, including transporting Wagner Group personnel to and from Africa.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any U.S.-based assets owned or controlled by the individuals and organizations. They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds, goods, and services to them.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, the Treasury Department said.\n\nRussia declared what it described as a \"federal-level\" emergency on August 9 in the Kursk region, the site of a four-day incursion by Ukrainian forces. The announcement came hours after a Ukrainian military strike on an airfield there.\n\nIn response to the incursion, the Russian Defense Ministry said on August 9 that it was transferring extra forces to the region, including Grad multiple-launch rocket systems, artillery, and tanks, Interfax reported.\n\nState-run media reported on troops and armor being redeployed to Kursk, including video of Russian military on the move, much of it reposted on social media.\n\nThe cross-border action in Russia's Kursk region has been described as the biggest attack on Russian soil since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his country's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nWATCH: Scenes of destruction in Russia's Kursk region continue to be shared online following a surprise cross-border incursion. Residents of the region shared videos that appear to show dead Russian soldiers among destroyed military vehicles scattered along a local road.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:22 0:00\n\nMuch remains unclear, including the number of Ukrainian soldiers taking part, although the Russian military has claimed it involves some 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armored vehicles and tanks.\n\nSince the start of the incursion on August 6, Ukrainian troops have seized control of about 600 square kilometers of territory, and more than two dozen settlements, according to local officials, pro-war bloggers, and open-source intelligence reports.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:43 0:00\n\nUkrainian officials have not officially confirmed the operation, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his evening address on August 8 that Russia needed to \"feel\" the consequences of its invasion.\n\n\"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,\" Zelenskiy said, without directly referring to the offensive.\n\nUkrainian soldiers appeared in a video late on August 9 showing a Ukrainian flag against the backdrop of a Gazprom facility in Sudzha, a town just over the border in the Kursk region. In the video, which was posted on Ukrainian media, one of the soldiers says that Sudzha and the Gazprom facility is controlled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"The news is as follows. The city is controlled by the armed forces of Ukraine. The strategic object of Gazprom in Sudzha is controlled by the 99th Mechanized Battalion,\" the fighters say in the video, which could not be immediately verified.\n\nSudzha Mayor Vitaly Slashchev denied the claim in a comment to TASS but said an evacuation of the city was under way.\n\nA Ukrainian member of parliament who spoke with RFE/RL on August 9 said the Ukrainian military was \"advancing and making an impression on the enemy\" and inflicting damage on Russian forces in the Kursk region.\n\n\"And the most important thing is that they are advancing quite professionally,\" lawmaker Roman Kostenko said, adding that they had managed to surprise the enemy at a place where the Russian forces were the weakest.\n\nEarlier on August 9 the Ukrainian military said it had hit the airfield in Russia's southern Lipetsk region overnight, damaging guided-bomb stockpiles.\n\n\"Several sources of ignition were recorded, a large fire broke out and multiple detonations were observed,\" Kyiv's military said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nIt said Russian Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft were based at the airfield.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nRussian media, including TASS, reported a fire at the military airfield in the Lipetsk region, which is west of the Kursk region, the site of the ongoing incursion. The reports gave no cause for the blaze.\n\nThose reports came hours after regional Governor Igor Artamonov said on social media that Lipetsk had hit by a massive drone attack. He later added that a local power installation had been damaged and six people had been wounded.\n\nArtamonov first urged residents to ignore calls on social media to evacuate, saying they were being “spread by the enemy in order to sow panic.” Hours later, he said a state of emergency had been declared in the Lipetsk district and that four outlying settlements of Lipetsk city had been ordered to evacuate.\n\nSatellite images made available to RFE/RL by Planet Labs show the consequences of Ukrainian strikes on the Lipetsk airfield. The unverified images show completely destroyed buildings and evidence of a large fire. Two craters -- possibly the result of missile or drone strikes -- are also visible.\n\nThe head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has urged Ukraine and Russia to show restraint in the fighting in the Kursk region, site of one of Russia's largest nuclear power stations.\n\n\"At this juncture, I would like to appeal to all sides to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences,\" Grossi said in a statement.\n\nRussia's diplomatic mission in Vienna, quoted by Russian news agencies, said it had told the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) that fragments had been found at the station, possibly from downed missiles, but there was no evidence of any direct attack on the facility.\n\nElsewhere, unconfirmed reports spoke of a Russian column having been destroyed in the Kursk region with many casualties. Video circulating on social media showed what appeared to be many burned-out military transport vehicles on the side of a road in or near the town of Rylsk.\n\nTwo ethnic Armenians in Kursk who spoke with RFE/RL's Armenian Service by phone said the Russian authorities had banned large gatherings and mass events in the region through August 11.\n\n\"It can be said that we are at war now,\" said one of the men, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHe said Ukrainian troops had captured two towns that are 60 to 70 kilometers away from the city of Kursk in addition to the Gazprom facility.\n\n\"The main fighting now is around the towns of Sudzha, Lgov, and Korenevo. People have been evacuated from these areas. We are inside Kursk. And there is always a risk of missile attacks here. This is how we live.\"\n\nHe said that there had been no evacuation from the city of Kursk yet, but noted that air-raid alerts were frequent, entertainment venues were closed, and public transportation had been disrupted by missile and drone strikes.\n\n\"Warplanes, missiles are flying overhead. Air-raid alerts are issued every half-hour. But we are kind of used to it, given what has been going on for the past year or two. No one takes cover because every half-hour missiles or drones strike,\" he added.\n\nSeparately, the governor of the Russian-held city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's occupied Crimea Peninsula, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Telegram that Russian forces destroyed three drones and three drone boats near the city.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said a total of 75 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over Russia overnight, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, most of them over the Belgorod and Lipetsk regions.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nBAKU -- The chairman of the opposition Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan (AXCP), Ali Karimli, said on August 9 that a criminal case had been filed against him on charges of slander and insult, which he called \"a falsification\" by the authorities.\n\nKarimli added that he was summoned to a Baku court, which will hold a preliminary hearing in the case on August 13.\n\nHe said later that the case was based on a lawsuit filed by Aydin Aliyev, who was expelled from the AXCP in 2019, but had his membership restored by a court decision.\n\nKarimli told journalists that he expected that the authorities will try to trump up some charges against him amid an ongoing crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"Twelve members of the AXCP are currently serving prison terms. Following our party's last congress (in June 2023), the authorities have intensified pressure against our party.... The same person [Aydin Aliyev] filed another lawsuit earlier that may lead to the AXCP's being shut down. And now, the same plaintiff targets me, filing a lawsuit against me,\" Karimli said.\n\nKarimli has been under pressure from authorities for decades. In 1994 he had to fight a charge of illegally possessing explosives. Since 2006 he has been unable to travel internationally, as the authorities have refused to issue him a passport.\n\nAlso on August 9, political analyst Sahin Cafarli said he was officially banned from leaving the country over his links to the Toplum TV channel.\n\nIn March, nine staff members at Toplum TV and its affiliated Democratic Initiatives Institute were charged with smuggling foreign currency. Seven of them were arrested and two were placed under police supervision.\n\nCafarli, who used to work as a presenter at Toplum TV, has been summoned for police questioning several times since the arrests.\n\nAll nine suspects reject the charges, while human rights groups have recognized them as political prisoners and demanded that the authorities release them immediately and drop all charges.\n\nAzerbaijani officials have insisted that there are no political prisoners in the tightly controlled country.\n\nThe president of the oil-rich South Caucasus state, Ilham Aliyev, has ruled with an iron fist since 2003 after taking over from his father, Heydar, who was president for a decade.\n\nVeteran Russian human rights defender Oleg Orlov said he hasn’t adjusted to freedom yet after being released last week from a Russian jail in the largest prisoner exchange between Russia and Western countries since the Cold War ended.\n\nOrlov, one of Russia’s most experienced and respected human rights activists, told RFE/RL that he’s done interview after interview since his release on August 1 and arrival in Germany and has had no time for reflection.\n\n“I haven't felt like anywhere yet. Neither in emigration completely, nor in freedom,” he said. “I have spent all day talking, talking, talking, [but] of course just walking down the street is happiness.”\n\nOrlov was one of 16 people released in the historic exchange that also saw eight Russians returned to their homeland. He spoke with RFE/RL from Berlin, where he is now living in exile and getting used to a life that is completely different from anything he thought it would be.\n\nWhen he imagined his freedom, it was always somewhere in Russia, where he pictured himself visiting a lake or another favorite place in nature, picking mushrooms, or lying down at his dacha and looking at the sky.\n\n“That was my idea of freedom,” he said, still imaging that he will someday go to the lakes of Karelia, a region in northwestern Russia, where he will sit and watch the sunset.\n\nHe said that he and fellow inmate Aleksei Malerevsky, whom he identified as a political prisoner, had several conversations in the prison cell they shared about the prospect of a prisoner exchange. They knew about calls for a prisoner swap but were dubious it would ever happen.\n\n“Yes, that's why, of course, no one really believed in the exchange,” said Orlov, who was convicted in February of repeatedly discrediting the Russian military and sentenced to 30 months in prison, a ruling that was upheld in July.\n\nHe recounted his refusal to sign a petition requesting a pardon from Russian President Vladimir Putin that was presented to him shortly before his release, saying this was “internally traumatic” for him because he believed that by refusing to sign he closed the door definitively on ever being released.\n\nHe explained that when the prison official asked if he was sure he wouldn’t sign the pardon request, he said he was, and he believed this meant he would have to serve out his entire sentence.\n\nAsked what he missed while in prison, he said there was a “great lack of movement” and it was colorless except for gray and brown. He added that the food could be “so tasteless, monotonous, and sometimes, apparently, prepared with bad oil, that it caused an upset stomach.”\n\nHe said he had good relations with fellow inmates and considered that lucky. They were “very different people,” but he was able to find a common language with them and it was always possible to talk about something or play board games.\n\nWhile cruel and rude treatment occurred often, this was not deliberate cruelty aimed at the prisoners, he said. It was a traditional “practiced cruelty dictated by the system itself.”\n\nThe system is not aimed at humane treatment, much less correction, he said. It is a correctional system, but “there is no correction there.”\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, says her late husband should have been among those released from Russian jails and prisons last week in a major prisoner swap between Moscow and the West.\n\nIn a video statement released on YouTube on August 8, Navalnaya said she and Navalny's associates had said shortly after Navalny's death that a prisoner swap involving her husband was in the final stages before he died in a remote Arctic prison in February.\n\n\"My husband, Aleksei Navalny, should also have been aboard the plane that first flew in to Ankara and then to Cologne. We said about that half a year ago, right after he was murdered in the correctional colony in Kharp. It was he who was supposed to be exchanged for FSB killer [Vadim] Krasikov, who was serving a life term in Germany,\" Navalnaya said.\n\n\"Just a thought that Navalny could be out free seemed terrifying for [President Vladimir] Putin, and that is why he killed him,\" Navalnaya said, adding that, nevertheless, she was very happy to see many wrongfully imprisoned people released last week.\n\n\"It's been a long time since I felt such relief and happiness, but at the same time I felt bitter,\" Navalnaya said.\n\nShe mentioned that many other Putin critics remain in Russian prisons, including Aleksei Gorinov; Daniel Kholodny; Navalny lawyers Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin, Antonina Favorskaya, and Aleksei Liptser; sociologist Boris Kagarlitsky; co-chairman of the Golos (Voice) movement Grigory Melkonyants; and other political prisoners.\n\nOn August 1, 16 people were released from prisons in Russia and Belarus, including three U.S. citizens -- Alsu Kurmasheva, Evan Gershkovich, and Paul Whelan -- in exchange for eight Russians, including Krasikov.\n\nKrasikov was convicted in Germany in 2021 and sentenced to life in prison for killing a former Chechen separatist in a Berlin park two years earlier.\n\nIn March, shortly after securing a new six-year term, Putin said he agreed to swap Navalny on the condition that he not return to Russia."
