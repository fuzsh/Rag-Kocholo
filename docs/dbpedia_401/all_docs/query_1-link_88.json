        "text": "Generalization of available materials from 1990 to 2005 including literature and survey data, as well as information on commercial and recreational catches, made it possible to characterize the current composition of the ichthyofauna of Avacha Bay (Tokranov and Sheiko, 2015). According to these data, one species of Cyclostomi and 76 species of fishes from 23 families have been recorded in the waters of Avacha Bay. The Prussian carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) is absent in this list.\n\nThe Prussian carp is characterized by remarkable ecological plasticity, making it easily adapt to new habitat conditions and actively expand its range. The appearance of the Prussian carp in new water areas is often a consequence of artificial introduction and subsequent naturalization due to the high adaptive properties and plasticity of the species.\n\nPrussian carp is not a native species to the ichthyofauna of Kamchatka. The most detailed history of its introduction is presented in the works of Tokranov (2002, 2021). It was first introduced into flowing lakes in the Kamchatka River basin in late June 1930 from the Sedanka River near the city of Vladivostok. A small portion of the carps from among those brought for introduction into the Kamchatka River was released into lakes located in the vicinity of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. In September–October 1954, the Prussian carp naturalized in the Kamchatka River basin was introduced into lakes and basins of other rivers of the peninsula (Kurenkov, 1954; Bugaev and Vronsky, 2005; Bugaev et al., 2006; Bugaev, 2007).\n\nIn 1976, the Prussian carp was introduced into the lakes of Bering Island. At present, the species is found in the Kamchatka River from its mouth to the Malaya Klyukvennaya River (640 km from the mouth of the Kamchatka River), and is absent in the lakes upstream. The main stocks of the Prussian carp are concentrated in lakes of the Ust-Kamchatka district at a distance of 94 and 150 km from the mouth of the Kamchatka River (Kamakskaya and Kovanskaya lake systems) and the lower reaches of its left-bank tributary, the Yelovka River (Kandeyskaya lake system) (Bugaev and Vronsky, 2005). In the Kamchatka River basin, the Prussian carp fishing is of local importance and is carried out using both cast seines and trap nets (Bugaev, 2007).\n\nIn the water bodies of the southeastern coast of Kamchatka, there are significantly fewer Prussian carps (Tokranov, 2021). One of their most famous habitats in the southeastern Kamchatka is Lake Kultuchnoye, located within the city limits of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and connected to Avacha Bay by a channel. In addition to the few individual fish introduced in 1930, the Prussian carp was introduced into the lake by the staff of the Kamchatka branch of the All-Russian Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography on personal initiative. In 2002, I.S. Kurenkov, S.V. Shubkin, and N.P. Loshniv released into Lake Kultuchnoye a total of 37 sexually mature carps of 24–25 cm length that had been caught in Ushkovsky Lake (Vvedenskaya et al., 2013). Despite the fact that the number of Prussian carps released into the lake was small, the species naturalized in the reservoir. For example, on September 15 2010, juvenile Prussian carps in Lake Kultuchnoye were observed in seine catches in the eastern and western sections of the lake (Vvedenskaya, 2017). In the eastern section, approximately a hundred Prussian carps of 1.4–3.9 cm length and weighing 0.060–1.005 g were caught in one casting of the net. In the western section of the lake, the vegetation did not form such thickets as in the eastern section, and juvenile Prussian carps were encountered only rarely. No seine fishing was conducted in the northern section due to high water, and no Prussian carps were found in the catches in the southern section. In the marsh adjacent to the lake, 120 juvenile Prussian carps were caught in two net castings, and their size and weight indices did not differ from those of individuals from the lake (Vvedenskaya et al., 2013; Vvedenskaya, 2017). In addition, there is information on the distribution of Prussian carp in the Paratunka River basin, which flows into Avacha Bay (Tokranov, 2002).\n\nIt is known that Prussian carp from the Kamchatka River enter the desalinated waters of the Kamchatka Bay, as evidenced by their occurrence in June-July in the catches of set nets located more than 10 km from the mouth of the Kamchatka River (Bugaev, 2007). The Prussian carps have not been observed in the Avacha Bay to date.\n\nThe captured specimen has a short deep body covered with golden-colored scales, which is atypical for the Pussian silver carp but occurs occasionally (Veselov, 1977). The body shape is angular. The back is flattened from the sides, dark greenish with a golden tint. The sides are golden-colored. Abdomen silvery-colored (Fig. 1).\n\nDorsal fin long, scales large. Eyes relatively large and round. Mouth terminal, without barbels. The last unbranched rays of the dorsal and anal fins robust, with serrations along the posterior edge. Serrations coarse and few in number. Scales large and rough.\n\nTotal body length of the specimen 125 mm, standard length 97 mm, body weight 28.4 g. The results of measurements and calculation of meristic characters of the caught specimen in comparison with the available data of the literature are given in the table.\n\nThe values of morphometric characters of the Avacha Bay specimen are mostly similar to those of the Prussian carp from the Ural and Siberian water bodies (Yankova, 2006; Zinoviev et al., 2011). The specimen from Avacha Bay slightly differs from individuals from the Kama region by greater relative head width (17.9 vs. 9.5–14.9% SL) and smaller relative snout length (5.3 vs. 6.8–13.4% SL).\n\nIt is known that the values of morphometric characters of the Prussian carp can vary significantly depending on the habitat conditions, which is an indicator of the instability of the latter (Shargina and Sidorova, 2011). Based on the similarity of most of the measured values of morphometric characters, it can be assumed that the habitat conditions of Prussian carp in the Avacha Bay basin and the Kama River basin did not differ significantly.\n\nQuantitative values of meristic characters are within the limits indicated in the literature (Veselov, 1977), which is an additional confirmation of the correct species identification.\n\nThe Fulton’s condition factor is rather high, 2.6. For comparison, the average values of this coefficient for fishes of the carp family are 1.5–1.7 (Flyorova et al., 2019). For the Prussian carp from the Kama region reservoirs, it is known that the average values of Fulton’s condition factor vary within 2.6–3.7 for both males and females (Zinoviev et al., 2011).\n\nThe caught individual is a female with gonads of stage II maturity. No ecto- or endoparasites were found. Age 2+. The intestine is poorly filled with food consisting of plant fibers.\n\nThe Prussian carp caught in Avacha Bay probably came there from Lake Kultuchnoye, as the site of its capture is only 5 km away from the channel connecting the lake to the bay (Fig. 2). It is currently unclear at what age the Prussian carp entered Avacha Bay and how long it lived there.\n\nAnother way of the Prussian carp entering Avacha Bay cannot be excluded. It could have entered there from the Paratunka River basin. However, this option is less likely, as the mouth of the Paratunka River is located on the opposite side of Avacha Bay from the place of capture, and in this case the Prussian carp would have to either overcome its central section, which is the most salty and deep-water section, or travel a very long way along the shoreline of the bay.\n\nIt is known that in the Kamchatka Gulf, Prussian carps are often found in the coastal water area (Bugaev, 2007). It can be assumed that this species also appears in Avacha Bay. In the Kamchatka Bay, crucian carp are caught in fixed seines. In contrast to Kamchatka Bay, there is no large-scale commercial fishing in Avacha Bay. Only a small number of anadromous fish species are caught during short-term periods to support the traditional way of life and economic activities of clan communities of indigenous and small-numbered peoples (https://www.fishnet.ru/news/promysel_i_pererabotka/v-kamchatskom-krae-ustanovili-sroki-nachala-promyshlennogo-vylova-tihookeanskih-lososey/). This is probably the reason why crucian carp have not been found in Avacha Bay in the past or the data on their capture have not been published. It appears that the only example of crucian carp in Avacha Bay was found only because this individual got trapped between large rocks, then delayed in the coastal area, and got isolated in a tidal pool.\n\nExperts have recognized that the introduction of Prussian carp into Kamchatka’s rivers is an example of successful naturalization (Tokranov 2002). The high plasticity of this species allowed it to disperse widely in the water bodies of Kamchatka and penetrate into coastal brackish and even saline waters. The capture of Prussian carp in Avacha Bay allows us to add a new species to the list of ichthyofauna of this water body."
