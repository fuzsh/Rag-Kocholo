        "text": "Newsflash, Reading, 26/05/2021\n\nThe Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service is tracking wildfires around the northern hemisphere at the start of the boreal forest fire season. While wildfire activity in eastern Siberia was below average, the heavily affected regions in western Siberia raise concerns among scientists at this early stage of the season.\n\nScientists from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) are keeping a watchful eye on Siberia as first fires in the area mark the start of the boreal fire season. The regions around Omsk and Tyumen in western Siberia have been particularly affected since mid-April, while other intense fires broke out in central Canada in mid-May. CAMS, implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission, consistently monitors the intensity and emissions from fires across the world.\n\nCAMS data show that for the period from 1 April to 24 May the number of fires and daily total estimated emissions for Omsk and Tyumen in western Siberia have been well above the mean of the previous years in the dataset (2003-2020). The total estimated emissions for this period for 2021 are the second highest for Tyumen after 2008 and third highest for Omsk, after 2008 and 2014. In contrast, the estimated emissions of fires in Russia’s eastern territories like Amur Oblast and neighbouring regions in the Far Eastern Federal District have not been as active during April to May as in other years.\n\nThis pattern in observed fire activity reflects the pattern in high and low surface temperature anomalies for April across these regions: fire activity was higher in regions with positive surface temperature anomalies and lower in regions where surface temperature anomalies have been generally neutral or negative.\n\nAlso, large wildfires started burning in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada, in mid-May, producing thick smoke plumes. CAMS scientists report that the fires show a daily fire radiative power (FRP) well above the mean of 2003-2020, emitting an estimated 0.88 megatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. Smoke plumes from those fires have been transported for hundreds of miles over the Atlantic.\n\nThe boreal fire season typically lasts from May to October with peak activity between July and August. Previous years have shown a specific increase and intensity of fire activity in the Artic Circle, particularly in Asian Russia. CAMS fire monitoring data clearly shows a large rise in the number of fires in 2019 and 2020 compared to the rest of the dataset which goes back to 2003, leading to a new record of annual total of estimated CO2 emissions in 2020 in the Arctic Circle: 244 megatonnes, compared to 181 megatonnes in 2019.\n\nWhile in some forests and vegetated areas fire is an essential component which can enrich the soil, clear dead vegetation and propagate seeds, fires in the Arctic are a cause for concern, as burning peat soils are releasing carbon which has been locked in the ground for thousands of years. Many of the 2020 fires were smouldering in peat soils but also in or around permafrost with a high ice content.\n\nThe large-scale and long duration fires between June and August of 2020 reflected the very dry and warm conditions across Arctic Siberia through the summer. The Monthly Climate Bulletin from CAMS partner service, the Copernicus Climate Change Service, showed for April 2021 negative soil moisture and positive surface temperatures over northern Siberia, which may give an early indication of favourable conditions for fires this year. Anomalies in May and other variables, such as snow cover and when it will recede, will be critical in determining this, and the C3S Monthly Climate Bulletin for May will help giving a clearer idea of what we may expect this summer.\n\nMark Parrington, Senior Scientist and wildfire expert at the ECMWF Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service comments: “It is still early to estimate the impact and the extent of this year’s boreal fire season and wildfires in the Arctic and sub-arctic region. While it isn't uncommon to see some wildfires during spring in high latitudes, it is difficult to predict what we may expect during the summer. We will closely monitor the area to see if we will get another record season again. Data from our Global Fire Assimilation System show that typically, fires in the Arctic Circle occur in July and August. We will continue to monitor fire activity in that region and worldwide, as well as fire intensity and the resulting smoke they emit.”\n\nCAMS is monitoring global fires and estimates the emissions they cause with its Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), using instruments on satellites and in-situ data. The estimated emissions are combined with the ECMWF weather forecast system, which models the transport and chemistry of atmospheric pollutants, to predict how the global air quality will be affected up to five days ahead.\n\nYou can find more information on last year’s fire season here: https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/wildfires-americas-and-tropical-africa-2020-compared-previous-years\n\nThe CAMS Global Fire Monitoring Page can be accessed here: https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/fire-monitoring\n\nFind out more about fire monitoring in the CAMS Wildfire Q&As: https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/qa-wildfires\n\n--\n\nFor requests concerning satellite imagery, please contact: media@esa.int"
