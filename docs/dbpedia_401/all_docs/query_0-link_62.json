I have my free time, and I spend it doing these things sometimes\n\nSome people have free time, and spend it going out to the pubs getting drunk with their friends, I have free time too, and I spend it doing these things (not always, but yesterday I did that).\n\nOfficials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, burning of crop waste in farmers' fields, and the 20th October[3] start-up of Harbin's coal-powered district heating system.[4] Harbin lies in the north of China where winter temperatures can drop to −40 °C (−40 °F), necessitating a six-month heating season.[5]\n\nAir pollution in Chinese cities is of increasing concern to China's leadership.[6] Particulates in the air can adversely affect human health and also have impacts on climate and precipitation. Pollution from the burning of coal has reduced life expectancies by 5.5 years in the north of China, as a result of heart and lung diseases.[7] According to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, 7 of 10 most air polluted cities in the world are located in China, including Taiyuan, Beijing, Urumqi, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Jinan and Shijiazhuang.[8] As air pollution in China is at an all-time high, several northern cities are among one of the most polluted cities and has one of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China's airpocalypse has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country's several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by \"Global voices China\" in February 2013, China's 10 most polluted cities on the blacklist includes major Chinese cities like Beijing, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, and 6 other prefectural cities all in Hebei Province.[9] These cities are all situated in traditional geographic subdivision of North China."
