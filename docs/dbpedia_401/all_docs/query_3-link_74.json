        "text": "Samarkand International Airport (SKD) has emerged as the second fastest-growing airport in Europe and Central Asia over the past five years. This achievement marks a vital milestone for the airport and highlights its rapid recovery and expansion post-Covid. The airport has recently recorded its 22nd consecutive monthly increase in passenger numbers.\n\nUnprecedented Growth\n\nData from the European airport industry organization ACI Europe reveals that SKD's passenger volume has surged by 191.6% since 2019, the last pre-pandemic year. This growth rate is the second highest among all airports measured by ACI Europe, which represents over 500 airports in 55 countries. The average growth rate across ACI Europe's airports from 2019 to 2024 was 9%, making SKD's performance particularly noteworthy.\n\nIn July 2024, SKD registered its 22nd consecutive month of growth since October 2022. The airport handled 121,157 passengers in July, up from 80,539 in July 2023. The first half of 2024 saw a record 647,085 passengers, a 47% increase from the previous year, with 207,421 additional passengers utilizing the airport's new facilities. This impressive growth contrasts with the wider European region's average growth of 5.8% in the same period.\n\nDriving Factors Behind the Growth\n\nDmitry Martynenko, Commercial Director of Air Marakanda, attributes this growth to several factors. The demand for both domestic and international travel from Samarkand and its surrounding areas, coupled with an increase in overseas carriers bringing visitors to the city, has driven passenger numbers up.\n\n\"Air Marakanda will continue to grow the route network and passenger numbers at Samarkand International Airport over the summer and for the remainder of 2024,\" Martynenko stated.\n\nThe company is committed to expanding its route network and passenger base, driven by airlines increasing capacity and opening new city connections with Samarkand.\n\nThe Uzbek government's positive open-skies policies and the allure of Samarkand's rich historical heritage have also played a crucial role. The city, home to UNESCO World Heritage-listed ancient architecture and modern investments like the Silk Road Samarkand tourist center, continues to attract international visitors. Martynenko emphasized the importance of these factors, noting that tourism is becoming a significant revenue driver for the local economy.\n\nAchievements and Future Prospects\n\nAir Marakanda, the management company of SKD, has seen passenger numbers double annually over the past two years. In 2023, the airport surpassed the one million passenger mark for the first time, with 1,010,938 passengers, a 104.9% increase from 2022. This trend shows no signs of slowing.\n\nSKD's remarkable growth places it second only to Tirana in Albania among medium-sized airports since 2019, according to ACI Europe. Tirana's passenger volumes increased by 239.3%, while Babimost in Poland led the small airport category with a 176.4% growth. Among major airports, Istanbul saw an 18.1% increase, Athens led the mega airports with 24.5% more passengers, and Sochi was the fastest-growing large airport with a 90.8% rise.\n\nExpanding Route Network\n\nSamarkand International Airport is classified as a medium-sized airport, handling between one and ten million annual passengers. It is now ranked among the top 10 regional airport leaders in Central Asia by the World Airport Awards (SKYTRAX). The launch of Air Samarkand, the first carrier based at the airport, has further boosted passenger numbers. The airline began scheduled services to Istanbul in March and recently commenced twice-weekly return flights to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, catering to religious pilgrims. Air Samarkand also operates flights to Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt and Nha Trang in Vietnam, using Airbus A321neo and A330-300 aircraft.\n\nAdditional international traffic has been driven by routes to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Istanbul, Moscow, and St. Petersburg, which collectively brought 612,963 passengers, a 56% increase from 2023. Since the start of 2024, SKD's route network has expanded to include 24 domestic and international destinations, with new additions like Turkistan, Tyumen, Irkutsk, Nizhny Novgorod, and Xi'an.\n\nAbout Air Marakanda\n\nAir Marakanda is the operator of Samarkand International Airport's new state-of-the-art terminal, which opened in 2022. This project was the first public-private partnership in Uzbekistan's aviation industry. The new terminal has been ranked among the top 10 regional leaders in Central Asia by the World Airport Awards for two consecutive years. In 2023, SKD ranked third in passenger traffic growth within its category according to ACI Europe.\n\nEstablished in 2020, Air Marakanda specializes in airport operations, passenger and baggage services, cargo and mail handling, aircraft maintenance, and commercial services. The company prioritizes international aviation safety standards, environmental protection, infrastructure modernization, and enhancing passenger satisfaction."
