        "text": "City on the map\n\nTyumen is a city in the Russian Federation, located in the southern part of Western Siberia, on both banks of the Tura River - the left tributary of the Tobol.\n\nWhy is it profitable to buy an apartment in Tyumen in a new build?\n\nModern Tyumen is a large industrial center, the oil and gas capital of the country, one of the richest cities in Russia. Oil production and the production of petroleum products are of significant importance for the city's budget; the production of machinery and electrical equipment, finished metal products, electronic and optical equipment also play an important role.\n\nThe climate is continental with cold winters. The average summer temperature in July is +18.8¬∞C, the maximum is up to +37.5¬∞C. The amount of precipitation is low.\n\nTyumen has two airports (one of them is international) and a railway station. There is a bus route network for transport services in the city.\n\nScientific institutions are concentrated in the city: the Institute of the Cryosphere of the Earth, the Institute for the Problems of the Development of the North. A system of scientific organizations has been created that works directly for the needs of the oil and gas industry. Tens of thousands of students study at fifteen universities.\n\nReal estate in Tyumen in the new builds is expensive in value, experts predict a rise in prices in the future for the following reasons:\n\nrise in prices for building materials (prices for rolled metal products increased the most - by forty-eight percent),\n\nthe introduction of escrow accounts (during the transition of developers to a new format of construction and sales through escrow accounts, the volume of housing being built decreased, consumers faced a shortage of proposals on the new construction market),\n\nlack of personnel (according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, one and a half million migrants who worked at construction sites did not return to Russia).\n\nNevertheless, real estate remains the most reliable way to save money and an effective investment. The decrease in interest rates on deposits, the fear of a collapse of the ruble are forcing Russian buyers to actively invest in new builds for sale. The decrease in mortgage interest rates also increased the demand for residential complexes in Tyumen.\n\nThe sale of apartments from developers is carried out, as a rule, in black frame condition. The standard quality is confirmed by customer reviews. New homes for salein Tyumen from the developers are made using modern technologies. It is still possible to buy an apartment in the residential complex here at a reasonable price by the standards of the Russian primary real estate market.\n\nThe lowest price per square meter of an apartment in a new home completed in black frame condition (according to information from the GEOLN.COM search engine) is 610 USD.\n\nAcquisition of an apartment in Tyumen from a developer by foreign citizens\n\nNo decisions, draft laws regarding the establishment of special conditions for the acquisition of housing by investors from abroad in the new development have not yet been adopted. Foreigners can buy an apartment from a developer in Tyumen without restrictions.\n\nInteresting places to visit\n\nEmbankment;\n\nFountain Seasons;\n\nJapanese garden Willow-park;\n\nAlexander's country garden;\n\nZoo;\n\nThe Kolokolnikov estate museum;\n\nHouse-museum of Grigory Rasputin;\n\nMuseum of retro cars;\n\nHoly Trinity Monastery (17th century).\n\nPurchasing an apartment in a new building in Tyumen is an investment project that makes it possible to receive a stable income from renting out the housing in one of the richest cities in the country. Experts, however, pay attention to the growing risks of a deterioration in the state of the country's economy as a whole and political polarization. Meanwhile buyers from Russia, investors from neighboring countries are showing a desire to purchase primary housing here."
