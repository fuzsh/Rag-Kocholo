        "text": "Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom depicted in culture\n\nCultural depictions of prime ministers of the United Kingdom have become commonplace since the term's first use in 1905.[1][2] However, they have been applied to prime ministers who were in office before the first use of the term.

The origin and meaning of the song are disputed. One theory is that it references the peerages-for-cash scandal.[6][7]\n\nA feature film, The Life Story of David Lloyd George, was made in 1918 by Ideal Films, suppressed, rediscovered in 1994, and first shown in 1996.[8] Norman Page played the role of Lloyd George.\n\nIn the film British Agent (1934), Lloyd George is portrayed by George C.

He is even said to have recommended family patriarch, Richard Bellamy, to be offered a peerage.\n\nHis name is referenced by Julian and Sandy in Round the Horne, in a sketch called \"Bona Law\".\n\nRebecca West's novel Sunflower features a portrait of Bonar Law as the statesman Hurrell.[11]\n\nArnold Bennett's novel Lord Raingo features Bonar Law as the chancellor of the exchequer Hasper Clews.\n\nLord Dunsany gently satirised the quiet way in which government decisions are made which affect many (but with little input from the many) in his short story The Pearly Beach. It begins \"We couldn't remember, any of us at the Club, who it was that first invented the twopenny stamp on cheques. There were eight or nine of us there, and not one of us could put a name to him. Of course, a lot of us knew, but we'd all forgotten it. And that started us talking of the tricks memory plays...\" The name they were groping for was that of Bonar Law.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1981 TV series The Life and Times of David Lloyd George Bonar Law appears in two episodes and is played by Fulton Mackay.[citation needed]\n\nBaldwin has been portrayed in the following film and television productions:\n\nThe Forsyte Saga (1967), played by Ralph Michael\n\nThe Woman I Love (1972), played by Robert Douglas\n\nThe Gathering Storm (1974), played by Thorley Walters\n\nDays of Hope (1975), played by Brian Hayes\n\nEdward & Mrs Simpson (1978), played by David Waller\n\nThe Life and Times of David Lloyd George (1981), played by Paul Curran\n\nWinston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), played by Peter Barkworth\n\nReilly, Ace of Spies (1983), played by Donald Morley\n\nThe Woman He Loved (1988), played by David Waller\n\nYou Rang, M'Lord?

Begin, of course, with England. 'First,' he wrote, 'Bereshith, as it were: Ramsay MacDonald can die.' By the time he went through resulting party alignments and possible permutations of cabinet posts, Ramsay MacDonald had died.\"\n\nChamberlain has been portrayed in the following films and television productions:\n\nE. G. Miller in Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nRobin Bailey in The Gathering Storm (1974)\n\nEdward Jewesbury in Churchill and the Generals (1979)\n\nEric Porter in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981)\n\nMichael Aldridge in Countdown to War (1989)\n\nRichard Clarke in The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990)\n\nPatrick Cargill in Heil Honey I'm Home!

Hogan's science-fiction novel The Proteus Operation.\n\nIn Harry Turtledove's novel, The Big Switch, Eden appears as a member of a group of disgruntled MPs who are gathered together by Ronald Cartland after Britain allies with Germany in mid-1940.\n\nIn Harry Turtledove's Worldwar series of alternate history science-fiction novels, Eden first appears as the representative of the United Kingdom at the peace talks with the alien Race in Cairo. As it does not have nuclear weapons at that point in the story, the United Kingdom is not fully recognised by the Race, but is also too powerful for them to fully discount. Eden attempts to secure full recognition of the United Kingdom by the Race, but fails. Atvar, the Race's commander, notes that Eden is highly competent but attempting to negotiate from a position of weakness. In the succeeding series, Colonization, Eden is prime minister in 1962, leading a government which cultivates close relations with the German Reich. When Germany and the Race go to war, Eden refuses to lend British military assistance to the Reich, though formally supports German efforts against the Race.\n\nEden is mentioned in a song by The Kinks, \"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\", from the album Arthur (1969).\n\nEden appears as a character in the play Never So Good (2008)—portrayed as a hysterical, pill-addicted wreck, spying on members of his own Cabinet by ordering government chauffeurs to report on their comings and goings. He is shown being overwhelmed by the chaos of the Suez Crisis and eventually forced out of office by his Conservative Party colleagues, at the urging of the American government.\n\nEden appears in Peter Morgan's stage play The Audience (2013); in the premiere, he was played by Michael Elwyn).[17] In the 2015 West End revival version, featuring Kristin Scott Thomas as the Queen, Eden is portrayed by Scottish actor David Robb. His scene in the play is a prediction of Eden's audience with the Queen the day before the invasion of Anglo-French forces in Egypt. The conversation that takes place features Eden attempting to feed selected information to the Queen rather than the whole facts about the Suez crisis and the Queen's reaction to the proposed invasion. In the play's 2015 rewrite, the Queen makes reference to Tony Blair, seen in a flashback, and his proposal to send troops to Iraq, likening it to the conversation she'd had with Eden 50 years previously about Suez.\n\nAs Secretary of State for War in 1940, Eden authorised the setting-up of the Local Defence Volunteers (soon renamed the Home Guard). In the film of the TV sitcom Dad's Army, the (fictional) Walmington-on-Sea platoon is formed in response to Eden's radio broadcast. Platoon second-in-command Sergeant Wilson is flattered when his resemblance to Eden is remarked upon.\n\nEden is portrayed by Jeremy Northam in the Netflix television series The Crown.[18][better source needed]\n\nEden is portrayed by Anthony Calf in the BBC television series Upstairs Downstairs (2010 edition).\n\nThe first season of the UK TV series The Hour revolves around the Suez Crisis and the effect of journalism and censorship on the public's perception of Eden and his government, as a metaphor for modern Western military involvement in the Middle East.\n\nIn the Ian Curteis television play Suez 1956 (1979), Michael Gough portrayed Eden.[19]\n\nIn the 1978 television series Edward & Mrs Simpson he was portrayed by Hugh Fraser\n\nEden is portrayed by Samuel West in Darkest Hour (2017).[20]\n\nBeyond the Fringe (1960–1966)\n\nDuring his premiership in the early 1960s Macmillan was savagely satirised for his alleged decrepitude by the comedian Peter Cook in the stage revue Beyond the Fringe.[21] 'Even when insulted to his face attending the show,' a biographer notes, 'Macmillan felt it was better to be mocked than ignored.'[22] One of the sketches was revived by Cook for television.\n\nSuez 1956 (1979)\n\nRichard Vernon stars as Macmillan, with Michael Gough as Eden, in a three-hour-and-ten-minute BBC television play by Ian Curteis.[19]\n\nWinston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981)\n\nMacmillan appears as a supporting character, played by Ian Collier, in the miniseries produced by Southern Television for ITV.\n\nA Letter of Resignation (1997–98)\n\nSet in 1963 during the Profumo scandal, Hugh Whitemore's play A Letter of Resignation, first staged at the Comedy Theatre in October 1997, dramatises the occasion when Macmillan, staying with friends in Scotland, received a political bombshell, the letter of resignation from Profumo, his war minister. Edward Fox portrayed Macmillan with uncanny accuracy, but the play also explores the involvement of MI5 and the troubled relationship between Macmillan and his wife (played by Clare Higgins) who had made no secret of her adultery with the wayward Tory MP, Robert Boothby. The play was directed by Christopher Morahan.\n\nEden's Empire (2006)\n\nMacmillan was played by Kevin Quarmby in Gemma Fairlie's production of James Graham's play Eden's Empire at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 2006.\n\nNever So Good (2008)\n\nNever So Good is a four-act play by Howard Brenton, a portrait of Macmillan against a backdrop of fading Empire, two world wars, the Suez crisis, adultery and Tory politics at the Ritz. Brenton paints the portrait of a brilliant, witty but complex man, tragically out of kilter with his times, an Old Etonian who eventually loses his way in a world of shifting values. The play premiered at the National Theatre in March 2008, directed by Howard Davies with Jeremy Irons as Macmillan.\n\nThe Crown (2016)\n\nMacmillan is portrayed by Anton Lesser in the Netflix series The Crown.[23]\n\nPennyworth (2019)\n\nMacmillan is portrayed by Richard Clothier in the Epix series Pennyworth.\n\nNolly (2023)\n\nMacmillan is portrayed by Nicholas Gecks in the ITVX miniseries Nolly, dramatising the life of Noele Gordon.[24]\n\nThe Night They Tried to Kidnap the Prime Minister (2009), played by Tim McInnerny – a BBC Radio 4 drama based on a real-life kidnapping attempt in 1964.[25]\n\nThe Crown (2016), played by David Annen.\n\nThe Lavender List (2006), played by Kenneth Cranham – a BBC Four fictionalised account by Francis Wheen of the Wilson Government of 1974–1976, with Gina McKee as Marcia Williams and Celia Imrie as Wilson's wife. The play concentrated on Wilson and Williams' relationship and her conflict with the Downing Street Press Secretary Joe Haines.\n\nThe Plot Against Harold Wilson (2006), played by James Bolam – aired on BBC Two on 16 March 2006. The drama detailed previously unseen evidence that rogue elements of MI5 and the British military plotted to take down the Labour Government, believing Wilson to be a Soviet spy.\n\nLongford (2006), played by Robert Pugh – Channel 4 drama on the life of Lord Longford. In one scene, Wilson was seen dismissing Longford from his cabinet in 1968, in part because of the adverse publicity the latter was receiving for his public campaign supporting Myra Hindley, then incarcerated for her involvement in the Moors Murders.\n\nIn series 3 of The Crown, Harold Wilson is portrayed by Jason Watkins.[26]\n\nIn Stonehouse, a dramatisation of the career of John Stonehouse, Wilson is portrayed by Kevin McNally.[27]\n\nThe Boat That Rocked (2009), played by Stephen Moore (character not actually addressed or credited by name, only as 'Prime Minister')\n\nMade in Dagenham (2010), played by John Sessions\n\nA Viking in the Asterix story Asterix and the Great Crossing (1975) is named Haraldwilssen in the English translation, because the translators felt his physical features resembled Wilson.\n\nThe Audience (stage play, 2013, played in the premiere production by Richard McCabe)[28]\n\nIn The Alteration by Kingsley Amis, set in an parallel universe dominated by the Papacy, Pope John XXIV is depicted as a Machiavellian Yorkshireman (a thinly-veiled portrayal of Wilson) who controls the population of Europe through Malthusian means including the use of bacteriological warfare and war with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHe is briefly referenced in the Beatles song \"Taxman\", together with his political opponent Edward Heath.\n\nSunday (2002), played by Corin Redgrave\n\nThe Long Walk to Finchley (2008), played by Samuel West\n\nMargaret (2009), played by Nigel Le Vaillant\n\nThe Iron Lady (2011), played by John Sessions\n\nThe Crown (2016), played by Michael Maloney\n\nThe Audience (stage play, 2013, played in the premiere production by David Peart)[28]"
