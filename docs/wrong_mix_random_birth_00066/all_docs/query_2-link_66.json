        "text": "Solution\n\nVerified by Toppr\n\nThe correct option is A 1916\n\nDavid Lloyd George was a British Liberal Statesman who served as the Prime Minister of England between 1916 and 1022. Hence, Option A is correct. The rest of the years fall within his tenure, not the date of taking of office, hence incorrect."
