        "text": "Welsh actor Philip Madoc has died after a short illness, his agent says.\n\nThe 77-year-old had a long career on stage and screen, playing the title role in the BBC drama The Life and Times of David Lloyd George.\n\nHis agent Michael Hallett said he died on Monday morning in hospital in Hertfordshire surrounded by his family.\n\nBorn in Merthyr Tydfil, he appeared in many classic television shows including Dad's Army, Doctor Who, Porridge and the detective series A Mind to Kill.\n\nHis extensive radio work included the title role in the BBC Radio 3 adaptation of King Lear and more recently he starred in S4C's new series The Cockle Farmer.\n\nHe was also widely remembered for his part as a German U-Boat commander in the classic \"Don't tell him, Pike\" scene from the popular television sitcom Dad's Army.\n\nMr Hallett said: \"He will be greatly missed by all.\"\n\nHe added that Madoc had had a short illness since January.\n\nHis children, son Rhys and daughter Lowri, and his grandchildren were with him along with other members of his family when he died.\n\nBBC - Wales Arts Welsh actor Philip Madoc dies aged 77\n\nIn a statement the actor's family said: \"He will be greatly missed by his son, daughter and grandchildren.\n\n\"Although he suffered from cancer, he was very well looked after by the staff at Michael Sobell Hospice in Northwood, for which the family are very grateful.\n\n\"He died peacefully in his sleep, at 9am this morning.\"\n\n\"I saw him on a regular basis and we had the family in common and a love of the business.\n\n\"I've got some wonderful, wonderful memories of Philip. He was such a talented actor and had that wonderful voice.\"\n\nRhodri Talfan Davies, director of BBC Cymru Wales, paid tribute to Madoc as \"one of the foremost actors of his generation\".\n\nMr Davies described Madoc as \"a man of phenomenal talent who will be remembered by millions for his performance in the title role of The Life and Times of David Lloyd George\".\n\n\"He leaves a rich legacy of work - in both drama and comedy - and will be much missed,\" he said.\n\nMerthyr Tydfil and Rhymney AM Huw Lewis tweeted: \"Sad news about Merthyr's Philip Madoc who passed away today. A truly gifted actor who entertained the nation. He will be sorely missed.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru Leader, Ieuan Wyn Jones, described Madoc as \"a committed friend of Wales\".\n\n\"Whenever I met him, he was always extremely enthusiastic about Wales' potential as a nation,\" he said.\n\nElaine Morgan, who wrote the screenplay for The Life and Times of David Lloyd George, paid tribute to him as \"immensely versatile\" with \"a wonderful voice\".\n\n\"When he found out there was going to be a series about David Lloyd-George he was hell-bent on getting the part,\" said Ms Morgan.\n\n\"He was successful, of course, and did a great job of it.\n\n\"He was just so professional. I think other people liked acting with him because he never tried to shine at the expense of those around him.\"\n\n\"He was always bemused at being remembered for the \"don't tell him, Pike\" scene from Dad's Army.\n\n\"He used to say there were hundreds of episodes of Dad's Army and he couldn't work out why people focused on that one.\""
