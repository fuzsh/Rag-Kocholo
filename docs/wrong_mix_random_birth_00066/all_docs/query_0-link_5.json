        "text": "One of our most popular shows ever, Disney’s The Little Mermaid returns to the Muny stage for the third time. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken’s beloved tale centers on young Ariel, who yearns to venture beyond her underwater home and go where the people are, up on land. The enchanting musical includes tunes from Disney’s 1989 animated film, such as “Under the Sea,” “Kiss the Girl” and “Poor Unfortunate Souls.” Theatregoers of all ages will want to be part of this world.\n\nDisney’s beloved tale centers on young Ariel, who yearns to venture beyond her underwater home in pursuit of Prince Eric — up on land, where the people are. She underestimates the danger of bargaining with her Aunt Ursula, a villainous sea witch, to trade her beautiful singing voice for a pair of legs. All’s well that ends well as Ariel eventually wins the heart of her prince and restores things with her father, King Triton, in the fathoms below. A colorful cast of characters and crustaceans punctuate Ariel’s quest for love.\n\nRatings and age restrictions are not issued for The Muny’s professionally licensed shows, but we offer the following notes regarding content that may have a bearing on patron comfort.\n\nLanguage • The words damn and hell each are used once.\n\nSexual Innuendo • None.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol • A tobacco pipe is used as a comedic prop.\n\nViolence • Ursula engages in G-rated violence in one scene.\n\nMature Content • None.\n\nSpecial Effects • Include fog effects."
