        "text": "Oren Kessler reveals the secret 1937 testimony given by David Lloyd George to the Palestine Royal Commission. Lloyd George had been prime minister during the 1917 Balfour Declaration, and had remained an unswerving Zionist ever since. He was one of nearly 60 witnesses whom the panel heard in private, and whose testimonies have been kept secret for eight decades. His appears here for the first time; it depicts a boisterous, at times embittered septuagenarian defending the Balfour Declaration on grounds of wartime strategy, and the need to appeal to worldwide Jewry, ‘a dangerous people to quarrel with,’ and ‘a very subtle race.’ Lloyd George was at once ‘Judeophobe and philo-Semite, militarist and appeaser, Zionist champion and Hitler enthusiast’ argues Kessler, author of Fire Before Dawn: The First Palestinian Revolt and the Struggle for the Holy Land, forthcoming from Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nThis was an hour-long invited public lecture -- a collaboration between the Stadt Bamberg, the University of Bamberg and the voluntary organisations 'Europa in Bamberg' and the 'Deutsch-Englischer Club Bamberg' -- which was delivered at the Volkshochschule Bamberg on 23 June 2023. You can find the video here: https://europa-in-bamberg.de/shadows-of-empire-how-not-to-remember-britains-tricky-past/ . In the past few years, and particularly since the ‚Black Lives Matter‘ protests of 2020, there have been ever louder calls for Britain to face up to the legacy of its imperial and colonial past. An Oxford statue of Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902) – both a brutal imperialist and a willing philanthropist – became a particularly controversial focal point in this debate. Should it stand? Should it fall? Should it be curated in a museum? Destroyed? Pushed into a dark corner and forgotten about? And what do our answers say about both our relationship with the past, and our values in the present and future? In this talk, Dr Robert Craig wants to think about these questions through his own experience as both a literary and cultural theorist and a native Brit. He will ask what the British can learn from Germany’s difficult (and ongoing) process of „Vergangenheitsbeschäftigung“ – and how Europe in general can come to terms with national histories that have often been far from glorious. Dr. Robert Craig is a Lecturer in English, American, and German Literary and Cultural Studies at the University of Bamberg. He’s edited a book on the interplay of literature and science around 1900 and written a monograph, which was published in 2021, about the groundbreaking German modernist author, Alfred Döblin. He’s also published articles on various aspects of modern literature, philosophy, and cultural theory. He sits on the board of ‚Europa in Bamberg‘; and he has appeared on German Radio and TV as a commentator on British cultural affairs — specifically in relation to the monarchy and its changing significance in contemporary Britain.\n\nWith Dr. Nick Webber, BCU. Harry Patch (1898-2009) was the last surviving soldier to have fought in the trenches of the Western Front, entering the media spotlight in 1998 when approached to contribute to the BBC documentary Veterans. Media coverage of Patch and the cultivation of his totemic status was particularly prodigious in anticipating and marking his death, producing a range of reflections on its historical, social and cultural significance. Focused on the British popular press, this article examines media coverage of the last decade of Patch’s life. It considers the way in which the Great War is memorialised in the space of public history of the media in terms of the personalisation and sentimentalisation of Patch, exploring how he serves as a synecdoche for the millions of others who fought, embodies ideas of generational and social change, and how the iconography of the Great War’s contemporaneous representation works in the space of its memorialisation. http://mwc.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/04/1750635214557988.abstract Video abstract: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR4uDnoXJ69lFTn_OKAW-yA/videos\n\nThis introduction to the Michael Howard Special Issue offers a short background tohis life, contextualises the themes found across the contributions to this issue, and then provides a more detailed analysis of Howard and his two ‘careers’ as a Captain and a Professor. Howard’s life as a soldier is too often compartmentalised from his work as a historian; this introduction examines where and how Howard’s military experiences shaped his later intellectual interests, academic career, and historiographical ideas. It then moves on to look at Howard’s landmark lecture and article ‘The Use andAbuse of Military History’, the influences on his methodology, and two prominent lectures he gave at Oxford as Regius Professor of History. The picture that emerges of Howard is one of a life dedicated to understanding the past and nurturing through good faith the generations that would follow him."
