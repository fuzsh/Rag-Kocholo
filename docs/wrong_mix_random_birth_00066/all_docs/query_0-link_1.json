        "text": "American dramatist\n\nSydney Rosenfeld (1855–1931)[1] was an American playwright who wrote numerous plays, and adapted many foreign plays. Close to fifty of his creations played on Broadway.\n\nSome of his better known plays (though none achieved long-lasting popularity) included A House of Cards, The King's Carnival, The Lady, or the Tiger?, The Vanderbilt Cup, The Aero Club, The Senator, Mlle. Mischief, The Mocking Bird, A Man of Ideas, The 20th Century Girl, Jumping Jupiter, and The Optimist.[2][3]\n\nRosenfeld was born to a Jewish family[4] in Richmond, Virginia in 1855, and came to New York during the American Civil War. He began producing plays in 1874, starting with a burlesque of Rose Michel called Rosemy Shell.[2][5][6] He began writing boy's stories at age 15. He served as the first editor of the English edition of Puck magazine as well as writing for The Sun and the New York World, but left journalism by age 19.[2][7][8]\n\nAccording to The Chronology of American Literature (2004), Rosenfeld was a \"prolific adapter of foreign plays, often accused of plagiarism, who had nearly fifty plays reach Broadway during his career.\"[9] In 1890, the New York Times stated that Rosenfeld's \"habit is to try to dash off an epoch making comedy between breakfast and luncheon,\" though despite \"all his evident carelessness, his lack of application, and his frequently misplaced confidence in his own powers, (he) possesses a gift of originality which Belasco and De Mille either lack altogether or rigorously suppress.\"[10]\n\nGerald Bordman's American Music Theatre: A Chronicle describes Rosenfeld as \"long a colorful, controversial figure on the American theatrical scene\"; \"he enjoyed some fame with a few hits and considerably more notoriety with his frequently gadfly behavior.\" By the mid 1910s, his knack of striking some hits ran dry, though he continued to mount plays until 1923. At the time of his death in 1931, since Rosenfeld had been inactive for a number of years, his \"importance to an earlier theatrical world was not universally appreciated.\"[11] He died with meager wealth; his estate was only reported to be worth $100.[12]\n\nRosemy Shell (1874) (a burlesque of Rose Michel)\n\nDr. Clyde (1878) (adaptation of Doctor Klaus by Adolph L'Arronge)\n\nFlorinel (1879; dates vary in sources)\n\nThe Storm Child (1880) (for actress Minnie Maddern Fiske)\n\nThe Sea Cadet (1880) (translation of Richard Genée and Friedrich Zell work Der Seekadet)(played June 7–12, 1880 at the Fifth Avenue Theatre)\n\nNanon (1885) (translation of Richard Genée and Friedrich Zell work)\n\nThe Black Hussar (1885) (adaptation of Carl Millöcker operetta Der Feldprediger)[13]\n\nThe Gypsy Baron (1886) (translation of German operetta by Johann Strauss II)[14]\n\nThe Bridal Trap (1886) (translation of Edmond Audran's Serment d'mour)\n\nA Possible Case (1888)[15]\n\nThe Lady, or the Tiger?
