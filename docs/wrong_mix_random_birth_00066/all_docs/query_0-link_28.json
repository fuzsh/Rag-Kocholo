        "text": "“And now, Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up…”\n\nMusical theatre and international recording superstar Sarah Brightman leads a lavish new production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical masterpiece.\n\nSunset Boulevard weaves a magnificent tale of faded glory and unfulfilled ambition. Having been discarded by Hollywood with the advent of “talkies”, legendary silent movie star Norma Desmond is tortured by her longing for a return to the big screen. When she meets struggling Hollywood screenwriter Joe Gillis in a dramatic chance encounter, their subsequent passionate and volatile relationship leads to an unforeseen and tragic conclusion.\n\nNorma Desmond is one of musical theatre’s greatest roles and it requires a true legend to fill her shoes. Sarah Brightman is the iconic artist who originated the role of Christine in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Phantom of the Opera both in the West End and on Broadway. Since then, she has become the world’s best-selling soprano, topping the charts across the world.\n\nThis historic theatre event marks her first theatrical role in almost three decades.\n\nJoining Sarah Brightman is Tim Draxl as Joe Gillis, Robert Grubb as Max Von Mayerling, Ashleigh Rubenach as Betty Schaefer, and Silvie Paladino in the role of Norma Desmond at certain performances.\n\nThis brand-new production features stunning sets and costumes, evoking the glamorous Golden Age of Hollywood. The thrillingly atmospheric score features the hits ‘With One Look’, ‘The Perfect Year’, and the anthemic ‘As If We Never Said Goodbye’.\n\nSunset Boulevard is the musical theatre event of the year. Don’t miss this strictly limited season at Sydney Opera House from August 2024."
