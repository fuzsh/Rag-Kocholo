        "text": "A contination of: When the Challenger Becomes the Challenged: Sinn Féin vs the Irish Parliamentary Party in the East Tyrone By-Election of April 1918\n\nOn the Retreat?\n\nBy mid-1918, the struggle for hegemony within Irish Nationalism had reached a stalemate of sorts. Sinn Féin had looked unstoppable the year before, winning all of the four by-elections, only to be halted in its tracks when the Irish Parliamentary Party [IPP] pulled off a trio of wins in South Armagh, Waterford City and East Tyrone. Regarding the last in April 1918, “this is the third seat gained by the Nationalists [the IPP], which is in favour of an understanding with England,” read the Tyrone Courier, quoting from the French Echo de Paris. “These successes seem to indicate that the popularity of the Sinn Fein party is on the wane.”[1]\n\nWas it? While Sinn Féin officially deplored any such defeatist suggestions, some amongst its ranks, such as Kevin O’Shiel, were inwardly fretting at what the recent flurry of losses could mean for the future of:\n\n…the new evangel and it began to be thought that there might be something after all in what the Nationalist and English press were telling their readers, that the tide was definitely turning against the new movement and the new men with an ever increasing momentum, that the danger of rule by the “wild men” and the “gunmen” was passing away; the people were returning to political sanity, the hectic emotional fever, engendered by the post-Easter Rising executions, having spent itself.[2]\n\nAnd all this over an election Sinn Féin should never have risked in the first place, in James McGuill’s opinion. At South Armagh, back in February 1918, he had overseen the party’s array of campaign cars as Director of Transport. Despite his efforts, Sinn Féin suffered its first setback, and since East Tyrone did not seem any more promising a prospect, McGuill intended to remain in Dundalk until a personal request from Michael Collins changed his mind. Arriving in Dungannon, McGuill found the situation to be even worse than he feared. Instead of motorcars, Sinn Féin often had to make do with ponies and traps for travelling around the constituency or as platforms from which to address the crowds; waiting, at one particularly awkward point, for the IPP speakers to be finished with the sole wagonette in town before theirs could use it.\n\nMcGuill was able to compensate somewhat with the theft of a few IPP-owned vehicles, and then tricking some Irish Party supporters into donating petrol for them. Such electoral lowballing was not enough to ward off the result McGuill had feared from the start, the implications of which he, like O’Shiel, found troubling:\n\nThis defeat in East Tyrone was rather serious from the Sinn Féin point of view coming so soon after the defeat in South Armagh. It was felt by some that the British would interpret those defeats as a weakening of the hold that Sinn Féin had on Irish public opinion.\n\nCompounding the pressure was how the British Government was finally starting to take notice of the growing threat in its Irish backyard. Collins’ arrest for a seditious speech on St Patrick’s Day in Derry was enough for the Irish Volunteers GHQ to make an exception to its usual prohibition against recognising Crown courts and allow him to accept the offer of bail and twelve months of good behaviour rather than serve a prison term. With the threat of conscription for Ireland looming on the horizon, Collins was considered too critical a figure, and at too critical a time, to be lost to a jail cell.\n\n“The British Authorities did not then appreciate the importance of the man they so lightly let out of their hands!” McGuill wrote, amused at this narrow dodge.\n\nMcGuill himself was a busy man, meeting fellow officers in the Dundalk Volunteers to discuss plans for an opening move against the enemy establishment. As Adjutant, McGuill had taken notes on the police and British military barracks in the area. These were forwarded for approval to Dublin but the reply from GHQ expressed more interest in a raid being carried out on Ballyedmond Castle, Co. Down. This was considered doable by the Dundalk officers at a meeting on the 16th May 1918; after it ended, just before midnight, McGuill was on his way home to bed when another man caught up with him to warn that the other officers had just been arrested by British soldiers.\n\nSo alerted, McGuill was able to avoid the troops sent for him. Over a hundred others from across the country, however, could not, detained as they were and then deported to English prisons for their alleged conspiring with Germany, the so-called ‘German Plot’.[3]\n\n‘A Restless and Unsatisfactory Condition’\n\nIt was, as far as Sir Joseph Byrne, the Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), was concerned, a measure long overdue, with results that were instantly appreciable. “The Sinn Feiners see that they were mistaken in their belief that the Government was afraid of them, and already an improvement is noticeable in their demeanour,” Byrne wrote to Dublin Castle in his monthly report for May 1918. “The revolutionists have become far less aggressive and defiant and the speeches at Sinn Fein meetings more cautious in their language than heretofore.”\n\nHowever, Byrne did not delude himself into thinking that the change was anything deeper than surface-level:\n\nThey are still bitterly disloyal, and hostile to any form of British rule, and the new leaders when they are identified will have to be closely watched.\n\nMeanwhile, “moderate Nationalists are reported to be pleased though afraid to say so openly.”\n\nModeration was currently a rare thing to find in Ireland: “Although outwardly peaceful from the point of view of prosperity and freedom from ordinary crime, the provinces remained during the Month of May in a restless and unsatisfactory condition.” This was despite there being much to commend: profits for farmers and tradesmen were good, as were wages, which was perhaps why industrial strikes had been few. Even tenant and landlord relations – that age-old apple of discord in Ireland – seemed amicable. Instead, “the restless condition of the country at present is due to political rather than agrarian causes, and is attributable mainly to fear of Conscription” which had finally come to pass, via the Military Service Act, to Ireland in April:\n\nThe general consternation…has been somewhat allayed by the Lord Lieutenant’s appeal for voluntary recruits, which many regard as an indication that the measure will not be proceeded with, and there was a large falling off in the number of anti-conscription meetings.\n\nNonetheless, “there is…no reason to assume any abatement of the spirit of opposition,” Byrne warned. As proof, Sinn Féin, despite the setback of the ‘German Plot’ arrests, appeared more vigorous than ever, gaining 43 more clubs by the end of May, to a total of 1,293 in Ireland. Its female auxiliary group, Cumann na mBan, had meanwhile jumped from 35 clubs to 80. As for the other group of interest:\n\nThe Irish Volunteer Force is managed so secretly that it is difficult to ascertain authentic particulars as to the details of the organization, but it may be assumed that most of the members of Sinn Fein Clubs of military age belong to it.\n\nWhatever its internal workings, publicly the Volunteers were on a downturn to judge from their number of drills and training sessions: 340 recorded in May, compared to the 507 the month before. The Inspector-General attributed this to the harsher, less lenient measures of the Government, with soldiers cooperating with the RIC in the dispersal of illegal gatherings and the arrests of offenders. “It is expected that the matter will shortly be well in hand,” Byrne wrote. Another encouraging sign was the increase in recruits for the Army and Navy: 1,079 during the four weeks before the 15th May, 364 more than the four weeks preceding.\n\nThe message Byrne delivered to his superiors was thus a mixed one. Militarily, Ireland did not seem to be in any danger; given the deficiency in arms owned by the Irish Volunteers, an uprising, like the one that occurred two years before in Dublin, was unlikely. Politically, on the other hand, was quite a different picture, the country now fixed in a tumultuous state, and it was all thanks to Conscription.[4]\n\nThe Conscription Crisis\n\nFrom the start, the Power-That-Be in Britain had been warned.\n\n“I must tell you that the enforcement of conscription in Ireland is an impossibility,” John Redmond wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, in November 1915. In the event of such a move, “the Irish [Parliamentary] Party will be forced to oppose it as vigorously as possible at every stage.” Asquith’s successor was told the same thing, though David Lloyd George hinted at an offer of Home Rule in return for Conscription in December 1916. Not even the dangling of his life’s goal before him was enough to shift the IPP Chairman – “I told him we could never agree to conscription as a condition of Home Rule and that under any circumstances conscription was impossible in Ireland,” Redmond recorded in the minutes of their meeting – and instead it was the new Prime Minister who stepped aside, turning instead to a different topic.[5]\n\nT.P. O’Connor found Lloyd George in a less emollient mood a month later as they dined together in London. Conscription once again found itself in the conversation and, when the Irish Member of Parliament (MP) repeated Redmond’s line of it being an impossibility, the other man pointed out that the English people, who were already sending their sons to the war, would be less than sympathetic to Ireland’s refusal. O’Connor argued that conscription would mean a hundred deaths in its enforcement alone, to be met with the retort that England would not care if the deaths amounted to ten thousand. And this was from a Prime Minster otherwise sympathetic to the Irish situation.[6]\n\nNonetheless, Ireland remained un-conscripted; nonetheless, the possibility alone was corrosive to the IPP’s support. The by-election of South Longford in May 1917, four months after O’Connor’s uncomfortable exchange with Lloyd George, was not the first Sinn Féin victory of the year but it confirmed just how far the tide of public opinion had turned against the party that had, for a generation, been the voice of national aspiration.\n\nIf in politics you are only as good as your current crisis, then this was one the IPP found itself unable to get away from. “The conscription menace is emphasised in every verse of doggerel, and fathers are warned that if the Sinn Fein candidate is not returned, every young man will be taken for the Army,” reported the Irish Times. “This threat seems to be having its desired effect” – as was proven to be the case on polling day. “Today a new chapter is opened with South Longford gone over to Sinn Féin,” went the same newspaper on the 11th May. “How many seats could Mr Redmond count with entire confidence upon retaining similar attacks?”[7]\n\nBy the end of 1917, with all four of that year’s by-elections lost, the answer appeared to be ‘not many – at best.’ For all of Redmond’s defiance to British Prime Ministers on the subject, the fact was that, on this most crucial of topics, the Irish people evidently trusted the newcomer party more than the established one. His previous plea to the Chief Secretary of Ireland in December 1915, that “conscription gives a certain reality to the [revolutionary] movement [emphasis in text]” and that “were it to be killed dead, the movement would die down,” had gone unheeded.[8]\n\nWhether it could have been as simple as that is debatable. After all, the Irish Times had listed other reasons behind Sinn Féin’s success, in South Longford and elsewhere: Home Rule’s delay, the unwelcome possibility of Partition and the sheer energy Sinn Féin displayed were all combining to “make very difficult the position of the Nationalist Party [IPP] in the next few weeks” and further. But there was no denying that, come April 1918, all other considerations had been eclipsed by that of Conscription – enough to bring bitter enemies to the same table, literally, at the Mansion House, Dublin, on the 18th.[9]\n\n‘A Veritable Miracle’\n\nThere, representatives of the two major parties met for the first time: John Dillon and Joe Devlin from the IPP, Éamon de Valera and Arthur Griffith for Sinn Féin, along with three Labour men and two other Nationalist MPs. After an anti-Conscription pledge was drawn up, in which the assembled men and their respective factions swore to “resist Conscription by the most effective means at our disposal”, a deputation was immediately sent to where the Catholic bishops of Ireland had been gathering on unrelated matters in Maynooth. The Princes of the Church were more than happy to lend their ecclesiastical support to the political cause, issuing a manifesto of their own later that night, declaring resistance against Conscription to be “consonant with the law of God.” Three days later, on the 21st, meetings in almost every village and parish in Ireland were held for people to sign their names en masse to the Mansion House pledge.\n\nThe country had never been more in lockstep. If every cloud has a silver lining, then Conscription’s, or the fear of it, was how it performed “a veritable miracle in Nationalist Ireland,” so O’Shiel described with rhetorical flourish, “pulling together at one stroke all its discordant elements and binding them in one strong, and what proved, irrestible [sic] union against the grave threat.” Darrell Figgis, another Sinn Féin activist, struck a similarly heady note in his own reminiscences – “I am sure there never has been such concord in Ireland. Enemies forgot their enmities and hastened to be first in friendship” – while Tim Healy, MP and one of the Mansion House Conference attendees, rejoiced in a letter to his brother about how “there was nothing in [Daniel] O’Connell’s time to compare with Irish unanimity against Conscription.”[10]\n\nFor all these high-minded words, the lines between the parties involved could be papered over at most, but never erased. When the idea of an anti-Conscription summit had initially been mooted at Dublin Corporation, the Labour attendees believed that this was an attempt to ‘get the jump’ on Sinn Féin, considering how everyone else in the room were IPP partisans, and would only agree to the motion if Sinn Féin was also involved. Whether Sinn Féin would want to, however, was another question.\n\n“There appeared to be some considerable doubt as to whether they would or not,” wrote William O’Brien, one of the Labour men in question, “but finally they did. They feared they mightn’t favour the idea of working with the Irish Party.”[11]\n\nActually, many in Sinn Féin did not. When the Sinn Féin offices received the invitation to the Mansion House from Laurence O’Neill, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the innovator of the idea, “shrewd were the glances cast at it, and long the discussions of its worth,” described Figgis (as one of Sinn Féin’s senior administrators, he would have been in a position to know). De Valera and Griffith, to which the letter had been addressed, were in favour of accepting “but it took the united effort of these two men to carry the proposal with the Executive Committee,” the concern being that Sinn Féin’s sense of self as the Irish government-in-waiting would be diluted by standing next to its hated rival.\n\nDe Valera even tried resorting to the suggestion that he and Griffith attend the Mansion House “as individuals, binding Sinn Fein in no way by their action,” an early display of the Long Fellow’s gift for creative ambiguity. Not that this impressed Figgis – “the suggestion was like a mathematical formula for which no practical correlative can be found – looking very real on paper, but equating with nothing real on fact” – even as he was supportive of de Valera’s stance, and cynical of the motives of the naysayers: “No doubt some of these considerations were moved by the desire for separate possession and power. Impure motives move obscurely in the sincerest of folk…Those impure motives moved more in some than in others” (as this text was published in 1927, its author may have had the bitterness over the Civil War more in mind).[12]\n\nJohn Dillon, meanwhile, had tried talking himself out of the invite after receiving his own, believing that the ideal place to argue Ireland’s case remained in the debating-hall of Westminster – which would just happen to play into his party’s strengths, still possessing as it did the majority of Irish parliamentary seats. The suggestion from de Valera and Griffith to the Lord Mayor that the conference go ahead without Dillon was what probably pushed the IPP Chairman – Dillon had replaced the late John Redmond, who had died the previous month, in March – into accepting, lest his party be left out in the cold.\n\n“As I had summoned the conference,” O’Neill later explained, “I was in the chair and it took all the ingenuity I possessed to make a favourable start.” The national unanimity O’Shiel, Figgis and Healy took for granted had, in fact, been far from inevitable. Dillon, O’Neill observed in the Mansion House, was “solemn, and no doubt realised that the power of his party was diminishing, and that by attending the conference he was playing into the hands of Sinn Fein.”[13]\n\nOf course, the IPP’s prestige had been declining for quite some time already; in attending, Dillon had had little choice when his prevarication failed. Plenty in Sinn Féin, likewise, felt pushed into acting against their party’s best interests. Nonetheless, “wise or unwise, the wish of the people left no alternative,” as Figgis baldly put it.[14]\n\nA Hollow Alliance\n\nThe RIC Inspector-General probably had his finger best on the political pulse. While the current furore over Conscription was enough to drive the two hitherto hostile factions, if not quite into each other’s arms, then at least to each other’s side, “the hollowness of the alliance is apparent in the refusal of either side to withdraw from the Election contest in East Cavan,” Byrne reported to Dublin Castle.[15]\n\nFor, almost unnoticed beneath the clamour, the MP for the aforementioned area, Samuel Young, had died on the 18th April, the same day as the Mansion House Conference. Having reached the venerable age of ninety-six years, Young had been the Methuselah, not just of the Irish Party but of the House of Commons as its oldest MP, a career defined more by its longevity than anything in particular – much like Young himself.\n\n“Although he cannot be described as a great man,” the Freeman’s Journal admitted, “his life was a remarkable one,” the course of which had beheld:\n\n…Five sovereigns on the British throne; he saw Belfast [his city of birth] grow from an thirty thousand people into a city of three hundred thousand; he saw the origin and growth of half a dozen movements in Ireland; he saw the happening of gigantic events in Europe and America; he saw the passing of legislation that transformed the face of this country and turned the Irish people from serfs into free men.\n\nYoung’s own contribution to history had been slight: a few public utterances in Westminster, two of the most notable being in regard to Home Rule, which, at least, was fitting enough, given his “deep convictions that Ireland under Home Rule would become a great, happy and contented country, and a strength to the Empire of which she forms a part…Ireland wants more of his kind” – so concluded the Freeman’s Journal in a heartfelt obituary.[16]\n\nWhether Ireland felt the same was another matter, and what it wanted was about to be put to the test. Given the length of his public service, it would be seem somewhat perverse, if not outright cruel, that Young’s death would be regulated to practically a footnote in the other newspapers; nothing in his life, like the Thane of Cawdor, became him like the leaving of it. After twenty-six years of the same representative (Young having been continuously elected since 1892), East Cavan was due to decide on a new one, a contest which, for many, could not have come at a worst time: Nationalist Ireland looked set to tear itself apart all over again.\n\nNo less an illustrious figure than the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr William Wash, confessed himself alarmed in a letter to O’Neill, on the 24th April, at what he was reading in the papers about the prospect of yet another divisive by-election between the IPP and Sinn Féin. “If there is not perfect agreement on this point we are in for a hopeless situation,” warned His Eminence. “Can nothing be done? If nothing can be done to secure real unanimity, thousands who were heart and soul with the movement will have no option but to drop out.”[17]\n\nIt was a danger Edward Brady, the Justice of the Peace from Clones and the Chairman of the Urban District Council, also felt keenly in a letter of his own, published in the media on the 27th April:\n\nI earnestly appeal to the good sense and patriotism of the electors to see that in view of the present grave menace which overhangs our country, East Clare shall not endanger the national unity which now, thank God, exists. If a candidate acceptable to all Nationalists is not available better leave the vacancy untilled until the present danger is past.[18]\n\nSome hope of that. On the same day that Brady’s plaintive plea was printed, the Nationality announced to the country that “Mr Arthur Griffith was unanimously selected at a Convention of Sinn Féin and the clergy of East Cavan on Sunday as candidate for the representation of that constituency” – as the newspaper in question was edited by none other than the candidate himself, this might as well have been an official press release from Sinn Féin. Unity or no unity, the gauntlet had just been thrown.[19]\n\nFait Accompli\n\nGiven its aggressive attitude towards elections from the start, it was not surprising that Sinn Féin would refuse to be leashed when another such opportunity presented itself. “As the vacancies occur the same thing will happen everywhere throughout the country,” declared Peadar Clancy in a letter to his brother after the victory in South-Longford in May 1917, “until we have wiped out the Redmondites who had betrayed Ireland.” If to Clancy the democratic process was a weapon, then, for Griffith, it was simply good strategy. “There is no sort of propaganda and no way of educating the public to be compared with a contested election,” he told Eoin MacNeill when the latter was querying their expensive costs.[20]\n\nNonetheless, on this occasion, Griffith had every intention of staying out of this latest contest; that is, if we go by Figgis’ recounting of events. Backroom machinations were thus necessary to push the Sinn Féin founder, and currently one of its two vice-presidents, into the arena, even if it was against his will. Figgis, as the official in charge of the party administration, knew that the Sinn Féin branch in East Cavan had plumped for Griffith. Procedure was then for the name of the candidate to be placed before the Central Executive for approval.\n\nBut Figgis was also aware of the talks to put forward a neutral choice for East Cavan, which, he decided, would not do at all. Before boarding a train to Cashel, Co. Tipperary, Figgis sent a telegram to the party headquarters in Dublin, telling them to announce Griffith as Sinn Féin’s man for East Cavan. They were to do so in two days’ time, on Monday – notably, the Central Executive was due to meet the next day, on the Sunday, which Figgis was skipping in favour of Cashel – and a fact Figgis neglected to mention in his telegram, instead presenting Griffith’s selection as if it was already official policy.\n\nThis lie of omission worked like a charm. By the time Figgis returned from Co. Tipperary on the Monday, the news was already in the press. Neither Griffith nor de Valera were thrilled with this development when Figgis met them in the party offices later that day, with Griffith going so far as to suggest that a statement be issued, pulling back from his nomination by clarifying that the Central Executive had not yet had the chance to consider it.\n\nTo this, Figgis, in a masterpiece of obfuscation:\n\n…answered that this could be done, but it had to be remembered that the next day [Tuesday – 23rd April] was the day of the National Strike against Conscription – when no papers would be published and when the entire nation would stand idle…No announcement could therefore be made before Wednesday. By that time the news would be belated, and the candidature of Arthur Griffith would have been confirmed by the relentless action of forty-eight hours.\n\n“I suppose we will have to go through with it now,” Griffith replied after mulling over this latest twist, “and perhaps it is just as well” – at least, that was the general gist of what he said, as far as Figgis remembered.[21]\n\nIt’s a good story; perhaps a little too good – a biographer noted Figgis’ “tendency to exaggerate his own role” in his memoirs. In truth, Sinn Féin had everything to win by plunging ahead and little to gain by playacting at cooperation. Still, even afterwards, some gestures were attempted: at Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon, de Valera and John Dillon shared a platform in early May, speaking together against Conscription, followed by a similar event in Derry, this one attended by Figgis and Joe Devlin, the MP for West Belfast.\n\n“Neither meeting was exactly a success,” wrote Figgis, “and they were not repeated.”[22]\n\nFundamental Differences\n\nOf other types of meetings, there were aplenty; too many in Liam de Róiste’s view. “In Cavan the situation in some respects was comical,” the Cork-based Sinn Féin official wrote at the time in his diary, “there were what we may term Sinn Féin meetings, Party meetings, combined meetings, ‘neutral’ meetings, election meetings, anti-conscription meetings.” Similarly absurd was the IPP’s pretensions: “They shout unity, unity, unity, with no real understanding of what unity means except we know unity to them means following in every particular the leadings of Dillon, Devlin and a few others.”\n\nBecause, besides Conscription, what common ground could the two parties share?\n\nTake Cavan as example. Griffith stands for the Sovereign Independence of Ireland, for the right of the Irish Nation to control its own destinies in every [underlined in text] sphere, for the repudiation of England’s right to rule, denial of the English Parliament by not going there, the presentation of Ireland’s claim to independence before the Peace Conference.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nHis opponent evidently stands for Home Rule of some kind, which denies the other things, for bargaining with the English Government, for friendship between Ireland and England in English terms, for gaining to Westminster, and denial of the presentation of Ireland’s claim at the Peace Conference. In Griffith the claim of Ireland is a nation’s claim: to his opponent “the Irish question” is one of domestic politics within the United Kingdom.\n\nAs such, “there can be no unity on such fundamental differences. It could be achieved only by one side or the other abandoning their fundamental principles” – which clearly was not going to happen.[23]\n\nFor the other side, not just its principles was at stake but its very existence. “If the Sinn Feiners win Cavan, they will carry everything,” wrote T.M. Healy to his brother in early May. Though long estranged from the IPP, Healy still prided himself on keeping his ear to the ground, predicting that, while “in Cavan both candidates expect to win…I think the odds are on the Sinn Feiner” – after all, “nearly all the priests are on Griffith’s side.” The only honourable course left for his former colleagues would be to do nothing: “Dillon’s Party had a great chance of reviving their influence by standing aside in the Cavan election and letting Griffith be returned unopposed.”[24]\n\nThe IPP clearly shared the same doubts about its chances of winning; however, simply conceding the field to its threatened replacement was a surrender too far. No sooner had the Irish Party selected its own candidate, John F. O’Hanlon, at the Bailieborough Town Hall in late April, then the man of the hour tried negotiating his own retreat: if Griffith was to withdraw and allow the Lord Mayor of Dublin, renowned as an honest broker, to run instead, then he too would remove himself. The all-too-brief unity of before could be restored. O’Hanlon gave Sinn Féin three day to accept this, otherwise he would, without another moment’s delay, be treading on the tail of Griffith’s coat.[25]\n\nO’Hanlon’s emollient gesture and defiant words could barely mask his party’s sense of vulnerability. Whether Sinn Féin gave his offer a second’s thought is unlikely; O’Neill, in any case, had decided to stay above the fray lest he risk his reputation as a peacemaker and a ‘friend to all’. “Many of the Party people are calling for a ‘neutral’ man – as if there is any man a neutral in Irish politics,” de Róiste noted scornfully.[26]\n\nDragging It Out\n\nFrom the start, the difference in behaviour between the two sides was marked. “Up to the time of writing [1st May] the Nationalist Party nominee (Mr O’Hanlon) has not yet started his campaign,” wrote the Irish Times correspondent in Cootehill. Save Sinn Féin, which was campaigning hard, “there is really nothing to lead one to believe that a keenly-contested election is about to be fought in East Cavan.” It took almost two weeks before the same newspaper could report that “it is now nearly certain that a contest will take place in East Cavan,” with a number of flags fluttering from houses – tricolours for Sinn Féin, the gold harp against green for the IPP – as if to signify that the contest was now finally on.\n\n“Canvassing is being carried on by both parties, each of which expresses itself confident of success,” read the Irish Times on the 11th May. “Everything is quiet for so far, and it is hoped that this state of affairs will continue.” Earlier, it had noted how “from the demeanour of the electors one can only gather that all would be grateful if a contest could be averted.”[27]\n\nFiggis experienced this voter fatigue first-hand, attributing it to “a horror in Ireland of political divisions” dating back to the Parnell Split. ‘Factionist’ was the most common insult and accusation thrown Sinn Féin’s way at the start of its East Cavan campaign, and while its activists were unlikely to care, the electorate did, at least on this occasion, to judge from what Figgis was seeing:\n\nIn places where a few weeks before an election meeting would have brought forth a great hosting and resolute enthusiasm, now but a few came, and these few were silent and perturbed. They would have come in throngs to an anti-conscription meeting, but to a political meeting they would not.\n\nSimply put: “The people did not want to hear of rival policies.”[28]\n\nAnother complication was the delay of the writ by the Irish Parliamentary Party, presumably in the “hope that some chance would avert from them a blow that could not help but be…of fatal consequence.” It was not until the 7th June, weeks after Young’s death and the announcement of his two potential successors, that the Irish Times could announce the issuing of the writ, which “has had the effect of reviving interest in the East Cavan election” – as if the event was otherwise in danger of being forgotten.[29]\n\n“This made the election an extremely long drawn-out and protracted one,” Kevin O’Shiel wrote with a sigh.[30]\n\n‘The German Plot’\n\nProcrastinating did the IPP no favours in the end, in O’Shiel’s opinion; to the contrary, it left the field of battle wide open for Sinn Féin workers like him to work the constituency, “giving us plenty of time to found new clubs, perfect our machinery and spread the new gospel by personal contact, meetings and the circulation of leaflets and pamphlets.” O’Shiel’s role was that of election supervisor for Ballyjamesduff, and there he remained for the better part of six weeks, performing work, as his title would indicate, “of a general supervisory character, co-ordinating and directing the work of the voluntary helpers in the area.”[31]\n\nIn contrast to Figgis’ memories of finding gloomy crowds and apathetic voters, O’Shiel’s own were such that, even years later, when putting them to paper, he seemed unsure as to whether future generations would quite believe him:\n\nIt is hard now to given an impression in words of those monster demonstrations that were such a feature of Sinn Féin in those early days of its career. They were enormous. It looked as though the entire population of neighbouring counties, men, women and children, had poured into the town for the day…The enthusiasm and fervour were intense, the very atmosphere appeared to be charged with exhilaration and high emotion. I have never experienced anything like it since, nor never shall.[32]\n\nBut it was never just about an election, nor merely a contest to see who would sit in a particular parliamentary seat. The bigger picture intruded in on the night of the 17th May, when O’Shiel was woken in his lodgings at Ballyjamesduff. Told that the hotel was surrounded by British soldiers and Crown policemen, O’Shiel hurriedly dressed and went downstairs to where the local RIC sergeant was parleying with the proprietor in the hall.\n\nO’Shiel was safe. The Sinn Féiner the authorities wanted, one of many accused of complicity in the ‘German Plot’, was John O’Mahoney. The Dubliner (and future TD) was stirred from his bed in turn and appraised of the situation, which he took in good humour, the whole business being conducted in a civilised manner by everyone. Over in Dublin, the Sinn Féin headquarters had already been warned of the incoming sweep and were debating the proper course of action. Should they escape? Or resist? A third option was finally agreed on: they would accept their arrests, with an eye on the rest of the country, which was bound to be startled into indignation on Sinn Féin’s behalf.\n\n“Moreover, the effect of such arrests on the East Cavan election would be to raise the issue there beyond all doubt,” wrote Figgis. With that settled, the Sinn Féin leaders were left to await their arrests in their own way. Figgis decided to return home, and even had time to have his wife pack his bag and prepare a meal. He was settling down to eat when the sound of footsteps on the stairs outside alerted him to the police detectives who had, as forewarned, come to take him away for his latest spell in an English prison.[33]\n\nPlaying the Long Game?\n\nSinn Féin could not have planned the whole thing better itself. “How foolish and myopic they were!” recalled O’Shiel. “Far from doing us harm, the arrests increased the ardour of our workers and brought us many more converts” – not to mention sympathy for the absent candidate, as Griffith had been among those detained.[34]\n\nJohn Dillon was all too aware of the advantage the British Government had just handed his rival. “Between their conscription policy and this coup they have put Sinn Fein on top in Ireland for the moment,” he wrote to C.P. Scott on the 21st May, four days after the mass arrests. Which is not to say the IPP Chairman was giving up the struggle but it did make his efforts at resuscitating his party’s ailing fortunes all the harder.\n\n“To sum up my view of the situation in Ireland,” Dillon wrote in another letter, this one to T.P. O’Connor, on the 17th June, as East Cavan finally neared its climax:\n\nWe must look forward to six months at least of military rule and severe coercion. Whether it will be possible for us under such a regime, and with the extended franchise, to hold such a number of seats as would make it possible to carry on the party is doubtful. But it is quite conceivable that in six months, if the government do not commit some fresh atrocity, Ireland may have sobered down so much that we shall emerge from [the general] election with say 40 seats.\n\n“That would do very well,” he concluded with a curious mix of fatalism and optimism. Notably, Dillon was not envisioning an Ireland dominated by Sinn Féin – a failure of imagination that says much about why the Home Rule cause came up short – instead, the villain of his narrative was the British Government, specifically its Prime Minister, who Dillon saw as “playing a very deep game, a game which necessitates the encouragement of S.F. up to a point sufficient to kill the parliamentary party.” Compared to the “immense skill and superb audacity” of Lloyd George, Sinn Féin was little more than a pawn, “being utterly devoid of political sagacity, and overwhelmed with poetic fervour and wild, unregulated enthusiasm.” As such, it was playing “right into the hands of L.G. [Lloyd George]” as part of the Prime Minister’s quest to provoke a confrontation in Ireland and justify the application of armed force.\n\nDillon kept this sort of conspiracy theory to himself and his correspondence circle. Publicly, instead, he kept the focus on the policy differences between his party and the other, returning to three general themes in his speeches to hammer at the opposition:\n\nThe Sinn Féin policy of an independent, sovereign republic could only lead to a war with Britain that would be inevitably and bloodily lost.\n\nSuch a policy, combined as it would be with a total abstention from Westminster, would be “a policy of lunatics.”\n\nAlso, not only would this policy mean the end of the unity achieved at the Mansion House Conference, it was alienating opinion in America just when Ireland needed it to secure its rights at the post-war Peace Conference.\n\nAll the same, Dillon knew his struggle remained an uphill one, with one factor after another conspiring to stop the IPP from going anywhere. If not for Conscription fears and now the ‘German Plot’ arrests, “we had S.F. absolutely beaten,” he told O’Connor.[35]\n\nA Close Contest?\n\nIn that, the IPP Chairman and O’Shiel the Sinn Féin activist were in agreement, if on little else:\n\nFor the first two weeks there was great doubt as to the result of the election. In my view, had the election occurred within that period, Griffith might well have been beaten. And, most certainly, had there been no threat of Conscription and no arrests, he would have been beaten.[36]\n\nCavan was, after all, a Northern county, and O’Shiel knew from his Tyrone background how conservative and hard to uproot from past loyalties such areas could be: South Armagh and East Tyrone were proof of that. “The majority of the Ulster Catholics were still untouched by the national movement, which had taken such a grip on the rest of Ireland,” commented another Sinn Féin official, Piaras Béaslaí, on that point in time.[37]\n\nThat there were 57 Sinn Féin clubs in Cavan, with 3,573 members, was a sign that the party was making inroads, but against that – as estimated by the RIC report for May 1918 – were the clubs and membership numbers of the United Irish League (42 and 5,962 respectively) and the Ancient Order of Hibernians (45 and 3,254), two grassroots organisations long affiliated with the IPP. Even when accounting for a probable shared membership between the pair, there were still grounds for thinking that (1) the Irish Party could win, as it had three times already that year, (2) either way, the result would be a close one.[38]\n\n“It is believed that the election will be closely contested, and that the majority will be small,” read the Irish Times on the 7th June:\n\nBoth sides express themselves confident of success. The Sinn Féin supporters assert that their man will win by an overwhelming majority, and, on the other hand, the Nationalists say that Mr. O’Hanlon will head the poll with a majority of from 500 to 600.[39]\n\nBy the 21st, the day after polling, “the general opinion…was that Mr Griffith had won by a couple of hundred votes.”[40]\n\nIreland’s Answer\n\nSuch reports were enough to soothe Liam de Róiste’s nerves a little, though he remained “somewhat impatient and a little nervous” as he recorded in his diary. So much hinged on East Cavan: if Sinn Féin won, the British state would be sent reeling; if not, then the cell doors on the imprisoned men were staying shut, probably for a very long time.[41]\n\nNot that would be the end of things, if a gratifying exchange de Róiste had heard about was anything to go by. A priest at the same convent school in Kinsale, Co. Cork, de Róiste taught at was testing his pupils’ knowledge of Irish history. All had heard of the Battle of Clontarf, one of the few occasions Ireland could claim to have won. Similarly, everyone in the class knew who Éamon de Valera was when the padre asked about him.\n\nThey were not so certain when he followed up with which battle de Valera fought, but one small girl proved equal to the task:\n\nGirl: The Battle of Dublin, Father.\n\nPriest: When was it fought?\n\nGirl: Easter 1916, Father.\n\nPriest: And who won?\n\nGirl: It isn’t over yet, Father.\n\nPriest: What! Is de Valera fighting yet?\n\nGirl: Yes, Father.\n\nPriest: Where is he fighting?\n\nGirl: In jail, Father![42]\n\nDe Róiste was taking tea after his classes at the convent school when, at 6.40 pm, news of East Cavan reached him. Instead of the slim majority some had been predicting for Sinn Féin, Griffith, as it turned out, had won by 1,214 votes, his 3,785 to O’Hanlon’s 2,581. Yet another IPP stronghold had been stormed and in the supposedly impregnable North to boot. “That is better by a great deal than expected, better than the most optimistic estimate,” de Róiste wrote triumphantly. “There is Ireland’s answer to Lloyd George and his Plot. There is Ireland’s answer to ‘the Party’.”[43]\n\n“Arthur Griffith, Sinn Fein leader and deportee, was elected M.P. for East Cavan by a majority of 1,200 votes over the Nationalist [IPP] candidate,” went the RIC summary for the month. Despite the magnitude of the result, and its long-term implications, the Inspector General was primarily concerned about the immediate aftermath, mentioning that there were “some disturbances here and there, but on the whole it caused less excitement than previous Sinn Fein victories.” Likewise, the County Inspector report offered little comment, save that “all excitement has since died down.”[44]\n\nBut, of course, the excitement was only just beginning.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Tyrone Courier, 12/04/1918\n\n[2] O’Shiel, Kevin (BMH / WS 1770, Part 6), p. 9\n\n[3] McGuill, James (BMH / WS 353), p. 46-9, 52-3\n\n[4] Police reports from Dublin Castle records (National Library of Ireland – NLI), POS 8546\n\n[5] Meleady, Dermot (ed.)

However, piecing together the scraps of information which people in the neighbourhood and people in touch with the prison staff are able to provide, it is possible to reconstruct a story of the sensational occurrence.\n\n(Sunday Independent, 15th May 1921)\n\nA Rescue Launched\n\nThe Irish Republican Army (IRA) now had possession of the coveted transport. John McCaffrey and four other Volunteers climbed on board the armoured car and drove down the North Circular Road to pick up Joe Leonard and Emmet Dalton. As seasoned combatants, the pair would be spearheading the rescue of Seán Mac Eoin under the guise of British officers who had come to Mountjoy to transfer the prisoner. It was a daring performance, one which both men were suited for in their own separate ways, as Leonard described.\n\nOther than the khaki uniforms they wore and the military vehicle bringing them:\n\nEmmet, having served as an officer in the British Army knew how to serve a prisoner removal order to the authorities, and I had served six months in Mountjoy Prison and had stood-to for the escape of twenty prisoners over the wall [in March 1919], and so knew the prison fairly well, and besides Emmet’s second uniform fitted me to perfection.\n\nIf Mac Eoin was in the Governor’s office as intended, then his liberators would be spared having to search for him. The final touch to the script was the IRA party who would present themselves at the prison entrance as soon as the metal-plated motor was inside with the intent of bamboozling the sentries into reopening.\n\nDalton waved some official-looking papers at the iron gates, which yawned opened to receive them, closing behind with a clang. Two more gates parted in succession before the car, whose driver manoeuvred in a wide turn once across the inside yard until it was facing back to where it came. With a small advance, the car was ‘carelessly’ blocking the inner two gates from closing, leaving only the front one shut.\n\nIf onlookers thought this unusual or suspicious, they made no protest as two men in British uniforms strode over to the Governor’s office in a perfect imitation of Important People With Important Things To Do. All was proceeding like clockwork…until, instead of Governor Charles Munro alone at his desk, Leonard and Dalton found him with seven of his aides and the door closing behind them. Was this a trap? Had they been rumbled?\n\nExcept Munro was polite enough:\n\n…receiving us very nicely until he mentioned that he must ring up the Castle for confirmation of the order to remove McKeon [alternative spelling]. I sprang up for the telephone and smashed it while Dalton held the staff at bay and then began tying the staff up with the hope of securing the master keys, when a cannonade of shots met our ears.\n\nSomething had definitely gone wrong. With nothing left to be done, Leonard and Dalton beat a hasty retreat from the office to the outside steps of the jail…and into bedlam.[1]\n\nA Rescue Aborted\n\nThe other five men had been waiting with the car, expecting Leonard and Dalton to return with Mac Eoin between them, and for the second team outside to help distract the sentries on the wicket gate next to the main one.\n\n“However, things did not work out according to plan,” recalled John McCaffrey:\n\n…because the next thing I observed (having at this stage put my head outside the turret) was one of our two men producing revolvers and holding up the warders at the main gate.\n\nSeeing this commotion, a British soldier called on the visitors to halt. At the same time, he raised his rifle and fired, narrowly missing Tom Keogh, one of the other IRA men who had been standing beside the vehicle:\n\nAs he was getting ready to fire again Tom Keogh very slowly and deliberately pulled out his revolver and shot the sentry. He immediately stepped over, picked up the sentry’s rifle which had fallen to the ground and threw it on to the back of the car. He then climbed into the car.\n\nMore gunshots were coming down from a prison lookout post. Caffrey struggled to return fire with the machine-gun mounted on the top of the armoured car but could not raise it sufficiently high. It was then that Leonard and Dalton reappeared and not a moment too soon; even without Mac Eoin, it was time to go – that is, if they could manage even that.[2]\n\nWith more Tommies bearing on them, Leonard picked up the rifle from the downed soldier and:\n\n…ordered the British military back, and on their refusal to obey, knelt down and threatened to fire on them – they seeing an officer kneeling in the firing position, broke and retired to their quarters, but the Police advanced from another position.\n\nLeonard and Dalton leapt on board their ride and roared at the driver to step on it. The car drove through the front entrance, now ajar thanks to the team outside who were supposed to rush the gates as a diversion – and had done so perhaps a little too well, for the guards had drawn their guns and opened fire, wounding one assailant, attracting the attention of the rest of the prison, and forcing Leonard and Dalton to withdraw from the Governor’s office.[3]\n\nLeaving No Stone Unturned\n\nAll things considered, it was miraculous that the IRA team escaped at all – but Mac Eoin remained under lock and key. He had arranged for an interview in the Governor’s chamber, where his rescuers were to find him, but a relief force of Auxiliaries had come earlier that morning. Procedure dictated that the inmates be confined to their cells for the newcomers to inspect for identification purposes. Mac Eoin’s protests about his impending interview were to no avail, and it was left for him to ruminate on another missed chance and for others to ask what that had been all about.[4]\n\n“The object of this exploit, it is believed,” read the Irish Times, “was to release an important political prisoner.”[5]\n\nEven after that failure, with the trial date drawing near, Michael Collins did not lose hope of an armed intervention, all the while preparing the legal defence – which, under the circumstances, would be very much a last-ditch effort. In this, he was assisted by Michael Noyk, a long-time legal advisor for the revolutionary movement. Charles Wyse-Powers would defend Mac Eoin in court, as per Noyk’s recommendation, but, when he took ill, Noyk arranged for Charles Bewley to take up the duty instead.[6]\n\nThe Mullingar IRA Brigade, meanwhile, was granted a chance to redeem itself. Mac Eoin’s arrest at Mullingar Railway Station could have been avoided if the local Volunteers had intervened as ordered – but there was no point crying over a lost opportunity when another presented itself. Since Mac Eoin’s prosecution hinged on witnesses, the simple solution was to kill them before they could step foot inside the courtroom.\n\nThe various Auxiliaries, Black-and-Tan and other policemen from the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) who had seen Mac Eoin in action, and earmarked to testify to that effect, were to pass through the Mullingar area to Dublin, so the tip-off went. Armed with an assortment of rifles, shotguns and revolvers, around fifty or sixty men from the Brigade mustered at Griffinstown, near Kinnegad, hiding behind the roadside fence or in some nearby ruins.\n\nThat the turnout was as large as it was by Westmeath standards, and overseen by their Brigade O/C, showed that the Mullingar IRA was at last taking things seriously – until undone by their habitual incompetence when the mine laid on the route detonated prematurely, blowing a massive hole in the road as well as their chances, for surely the incoming convoy had heard. The would-be ambushers hastily withdrew, closing yet another window of opportunity for Mac Eoin – not that they need have bothered, for the information the Brigade had received was wrong, and the witnesses were coming by a different way, through Meath, by-passing Mullingar altogether.[7]\n\nInsurgents elsewhere were feeling the strain. In Mac Eoin’s home county of Longford, “from the time Seán was arrested we did not seem to have the same ‘luck’ in our operations and the enemies [sic] morale had gone up,” recalled his brother, James. “They had become increasingly bold now, and were putting the pressure on very severely since they had got Seán behind the ‘bars’.” The loss of its commander had left the Longford Flying Column floundering, with no one able or willing to fill his shoes.[8]\n\nWith a few weeks left to go, and options rapidly running out, Collins showed Noyk a plan of Dublin City Hall, where the court-martial was to take place, and asked if he could use his access to Mac Eoin, as part of his legal counsel, to smuggle in guns for him. When the time came, an armed Mac Eoin would be assisted in breaking out by Dublin IRA men posted at hand.\n\nWhile he understood how important rescuing his friend was to Collins, Noyk had to point out that the likely security on the day – from armed guards in the court to machine-gun posts on the roofs outside – made escape a slim possibility. Always willing to temper emotion with logic, Collins conceded on that and dropped the idea. When Noyk saw Mac Eoin brought to the dock on the 14th June 1921, cuffed and flanked by burly policemen who stayed by his side throughout the proceedings, he knew he had made the right call in dissuading any further breakout efforts.[9]\n\n‘Feloniously, Wilfully and of Malice Aforethought’\n\nThe charge sheet was duly read out to the assembled court:\n\nThe Accused, John Joseph McKeon…a civilian, is charged with committing a crime within the meaning of Regulation 67 of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations, that is to say, murder, in that he…on 7th January 1921, feloniously, wilfully and of malice aforethought did kill and murder District Inspector [DI] Thomas McGrath.\n\nWhen asked how he pleaded, Mac Eoin’s response went beyond a simple ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, as he made clear to refute the claim that he was a mere civilian:\n\nAs a soldier of the Irish Republican Army, I have committed no break either of national law or international law. I admit no offence and I plead not guilty.[10]\n\nThe case for the prosecution relied on two points of evidence: RIC witnesses who placed Mac Eoin at the scene of the crime and as its perpetrator, and his alleged confession when arrested in Mullingar. The first of the former, Sergeant Ryan, had been stationed in Ballinalee, Co Longford, at the time, and whose duties included accompanying DI McGrath and four other uniformed colleagues as they approached a lone house in the countryside on the 7th January 1921.\n\nAs guided by the Counsel for the Prosecution, Ryan described how he was walking directly behind McGrath as the DI led the way:\n\nQ: What happened?\n\nA: When the Officer [McGrath] turned to step into the doorway, this man, John McKeon, flashed and shot him down in the gutter. He put out his hand like that [witness gestures] and shot him down. I had a full view of him.\n\nQ: You saw the accused come to the doorway and present his revolver or automatic pistol and fire a shot?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: About how far away would you be from the accused when he fired?\n\nA: I would be about three feet from him,\n\nQ: With the District Inspector between you and this man?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Have you ever seen this man before? I do not want you to tell us anything about where you saw him.\n\nA: Yes, I had.\n\nQ: Did you know this man by sight?\n\nA: Yes, I knew the man well by sight.\n\nQ: Is that the man, the accused there, who fired the shot?\n\nA: Yes, that is the man.\n\nQ: Have you any doubt about it?\n\nA: No, no doubt at all.\n\nQ: He fired one shot, you say, at the Inspector?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Was that all?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What happened to the Inspector?\n\nA: He fell down dead in the gutter in my opinion; he never moved. He fell down on his face.[11]\n\nA Dying Confession?\n\nThe second buttress in the prosecution’s case was the confession, as related by another police witness who had been present in Mullingar on the 2nd March:\n\nQ: Tell us what happened after he was recaptured?\n\nA: He was then taken into the Police Station and he asked for a priest and a doctor.\n\nQ: Where was he wounded?\n\nA: He was wounded in the breast.\n\nQ: By a rifle shot?\n\nA: By a rifle shot. He was taken in to the Police Station and he asked for a priest and a doctor, and they were brought and attended to him immediately.\n\nQ: Did the doctor attend to him?\n\nA: Yes, the doctor attended to him.\n\nQ: Did he dress the wounds?\n\nA: Yes, he dressed the wounds.\n\nQ: Did the priest see him?\n\nA: He did. He then made the following statement to me and to all the other police who were present, but I took it down as I was the sergeant.\n\nQ: He made a voluntary statement to you, then?\n\nA: Yes, after the priest and the doctor had gone. Of course, he was apparently in a dying condition at the time.\n\nQ: While the priest and the doctor were there, nothing happened?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: It was not until after they had left that he made a statement?\n\nA: That is so.\n\nQ: Was he in bed?\n\nA: No, he was sitting on a form near the window. He was then apparently in a dying condition.\n\nQ: Tell us a little more about that.\n\nA: He was very pale.\n\nQ: Did he speak distinctly?\n\nA: He spoke distinctly but in a weak voice.\n\nQ: When the priest and the doctor had gone, did he say anything to you or to anybody who was there?\n\nA: He said: “I shot DI McGrath.”[12]\n\n‘Trust in God…’\n\nA cynic might wonder why a man, dying or otherwise, would admit to a hanging offence in earshot of his mortal enemies and only after other witnesses had left. In any case, Mac Eoin and his legal allies had no delusions as to the odds of acquittal. While a capable lawyer, Bewley was hamstrung by how, as Noyk observed:\n\nThere was very little to defend in one sense. The only possible defence was that the night was dark and as there was a lot of indiscriminate shooting by the RIC themselves, one of their bullets might have hit Inspector McGrath who was in charge of the party.\n\nHowever, when a prejudiced courtmartial, as in all the other cases, was functioning there was no possibility of that defence being successful though Mr Bewley made the most of what he could in that direction.[13]\n\nMac Eoin likewise acknowledged that Bewley did his best, even in what the former called a “queer, one-sided trial.” After all, the only witnesses Bewley could call to counteract the official version of McGrath’s death were Mac Eoin’s IRA comrades, who were hardly likely to enter a British court of law unless in chains. Though Bewley succeeded in pointing out discrepancies in the witness testimonies, “it was all talk, talk, talk, talk, and with one obvious result,” that being the inevitable pronouncement of death.\n\nAll that was left for Mac Eoin to do was go down fighting – one way or another.\n\nThe prosecution rested its case. Papers were shuffled and a few whispered words exchanged about the chamber. Bewley asked permission for his client to address the court, as well as the courtesy of his handcuffs being removed. Both requests were granted and Mac Eoin, after rubbing the stiffness out of his wrists as best he could, discreetly took out of his pocket one of the two slips of card, torn from a cigarette packet.\n\nOn each was written a different phrase. If Mac Eoin had been fatalistic upon his arrest – “I know I am for a firing-squad, anyway,” he was reported to have said – now he resorted to a gambler’s toss of the coin. Should the card he drew be the one that read ‘Trust in God, go ahead and do your best!’, then he would seize the revolver off the policeman beside him, firing in one hand while using the other arm to hold his captive as a human-shield.\n\nAll the while, Mac Eoin would somehow endeavour to reach the window, through which he would leap to freedom…that is, if he could avoid a broken leg from the thirty feet drop. And make it past the loops of barbed-wire across the outside steps. And not get cut down by a bullet at any point in the process. He would at least have the assistance of Collins’ rescue team, armed and ready in the Royal Exchange Hotel on Parliament Street, opposite Dublin City Hall – contrary to what Noyk believed, Collins was keeping that option open – but Mac Eoin did not rate his odds of success very highly at all.[14]\n\nHe might have had a better chance than he thought. Almost three decades later, Mac Eoin made the acquaintance of Noël Browne as part of the Inter-Party Government of 1948-1951. To Browne, his fellow Cabinet Minister was a “gentle peaceful man”, his warrior days long behind him – until Mac Eoin gave a practical demonstration on how to disarm someone by pinning Browne’s hand behind his back. Despite the twenty-two years’ difference between them, the younger Browne was helpless to break out.[15]\n\nIn any case, Mac Eoin drew the card with the words ‘Trust in God, have patience and wait!’ That was fate’s signal that he should accept things for the moment and stay put.[16]\n\n‘…Have Patience and Wait’\n\nBut, if he would have to endure proceedings stoically, then there was no reason to do so passively. “The closing stage of the trial before Court Martial in Dublin yesterday of John Joseph McKeon of Ballinalee,” reported the Evening Herald on the 15th June 1921, “was marked by a remarkable speech by the accused from the dock.” The first draft had been smuggled out beforehand by Noyk and handed to Collins, who made some slight amendments before Noyk passed it back to his client on the morning of the trial. Otherwise, the words Mac Eoin delivered were his own.[17]\n\n“Officers and gentlemen of the court-martial,” he began:\n\nWhen you opened this court-martial this morning, I told you I was an officer of the Irish Republican Army and that, as such, claimed treatment as an officer. But, gentlemen, you are here to try me, not as an officer, but as a murderer. Why? Just because I took up arms in defence of my native land? The defence of one’s native land has ever been a privilege to the people of all nations.\n\nAs such, as a soldier, he had always abided by the rules of war, including fair treatment of all prisoners he had taken, some of whom would testify to the truth of that. In contrast had been the treatment meted out to him in Mullingar, when his captors had beaten him with rifle-butts.\n\nI have no reason to disparage them in any way or to say anything that is not true, but they did that. I will not say that they did it according to their orders and I will not say that they did it without orders…I was called a murderer in the Day Room of the Barracks. Anyone can understand easily that when I went into the Day Room there was a hubbub – “McKeon the murderer is in.” Yes, but I say: “McKeon the man was in.”\n\nWhen Mac Eoin had found himself cornered by Crown forces in a cottage in Ballinalee on the 7th January 1921, five months ago, his intent had not been to kill DI McGrath, at least not specifically. Since there were two elderly ladies with him inside, Mac Eoin had had no wish to stand his ground and bring the war to them; instead, he charged out to meet his foes head-on, regardless of the numbers arrayed against him:\n\nFire was opened by both sides simultaneously. After the first exchange, I noticed that the officer [McGrath] had fallen and that his men were running away down the road. But I wish to emphasis that I fired at enemy forces, not at any particular individual.\n\nMcGrath, he explained, “had simply fallen in the fight” as a casualty of combat. It was an explanation, not an excuse. He was no murderer, as the people of Longford and his comrades-in-arms well knew, and he praised both, the former group for their confidence in him, and the latter for gallantry and loyalty, even in the face of overwhelming odds. As for his audience:\n\nFrom you, I crave no mercy and no favour. I am an officer of the Irish Army and I merely claim the same right at your hands as you would have receive at mine had the fortunes of war reversed the positions. If you do not give me that right, and if you execute me instead, then there is one request that I make. It is that you give my dead body to my relatives so that my remains may be laid to rest amongst my own people.\n\nAt this, the speech came to its end. Back went on the handcuffs, and it was left to Bewley to step back in for the rest of his dogged defence.[18]\n\nClonfin Recollections\n\nStrictly speaking, what Bewley introduced next was not evidence of his client’s innocence; if anything, they confirmed his military activities against Crown rule in Ireland – not that Mac Eoin had denied them. Bewley admitted as such, explaining that the witnesses he now called were as character references for the accused. It was an unorthodox approach, and even more so because the witnesses in question had been on the receiving end of the Clonfin Ambush, which Mac Eoin had led as the IRA Longford Flying Column commander, on the 2nd February 1921.[19]\n\nAnd yet, as men like Cadet Smith took the stand, it was apparent that there was some truth to Mac Eoin’s claim to have followed battlefield decorum:\n\nBewley: Were you in the first or second lorry at the time of this ambush?\n\nSmith: In the second.\n\nBewley: You saw the first lorry blown up in front of you?\n\nSmith: I saw the mine go up.\n\nBewley: And then your lorry was stopped?\n\nSmith: Yes.\n\nBewley: Was fire then opened upon you?\n\nSmith: Yes.\n\nBewley: After putting up a fight for some considerable time, I understand you surrendered?\n\nSmith: Yes.\n\nBewley: Before you surrendered, did you hear him call on you to surrender or anything of that sort?\n\nSmith: Several people called on us to surrender.\n\nBewley: There was no ill-treatment of any of you after the surrender?\n\nSmith: No.\n\nBewley: After the surrender and you had been disarmed, did you speak to McKeon?\n\nSmith: I spoke to McKeon. First of all, he shook hands with me and told me we had put up a good fight. After that, he left me and I went up to him again after a time and asked if I could go and get some water for some of our men who were wounded. He gave me permission to go and said he would send one of his men with us and I went with another cadet and got the water.\n\nBewley: Did you see any attempts at violence at any of your party?\n\nSmith: We saw one of the men on the other side of the road hit Cadet Maddock across the face and also make a statement that he wanted to shoot us but McKeon stopped him.\n\nBewley: After a while, did you see McKeon doing anything for any of your wounded?\n\nSmith: He attempted to help DI Taylor to bandage his wounds but he did not have time because the police arrived.\n\nBewley: He left because your reinforcements were coming up?\n\nSmith: That is correct.\n\nBewley: Do you know whether he made any arrangements about your taking one of your lorries to go away in?\n\nSmith: Yes, he said that we could have one of our lorries to take the dead and wounded away in and also that he would send a doctor along to us.\n\nThe next witness, Cadet T.J. Wilford, corroborated Smith’s testimony, as part of which he recounted an exchange between the defendant and another of the Auxiliaries at Clonfin that day, called Keeble:\n\nI heard [Keeble] say “Now you have killed three or four of our fellows and wounded several of them, are you going to take our lives as well?”, and McKeon said “No, I am going to let you go, and get your wounded away as best you can.\n\nPerhaps it was just as well that the Mullingar Volunteers had failed to kill the witnesses. All that was left was the summing up of the respective counsels, though there was a brief diversion into theology when the Judge Advocate brought up how Mac Eoin had supposedly uttered an act of contrition into the ear of the fallen McGrath:\n\nJudge: You will probably think that [from] the evidence that the District Inspector was dead before he could have done that is true. However, it may be what is a little difficult to understand is why this whispered act of contrition was necessary if the accused was engaged in an act of legitimate warfare as is alleged in this case.\n\nBewley: The act of contrition has a rather different signification.\n\nJudge: I may be wrong. I am not a member of the Roman Catholic Church and I entirely withdraw it.\n\nBewley: If I might state it to the Court very shortly, an act of contrition is a sentiment of contrition for all the sins of his past life which a dying man would naturally wish to express personally, and if the dying man appears to be so weak that he would not be able to express it, any Catholic would consider it his duty to repeat the act of contrition into his ear, and if the District Inspector assented to it, it would be the same as if he himself had expressed it.\n\nJudge: You mean the accused is in this case saying something to the District Inspector which he thinks the District Inspector would himself have liked to express?\n\nBewley: Yes.\n\nJudge: I entirely withdraw what I said.[20]\n\n‘The Big Four’\n\nNot withdrawn was the inevitable penalty for murder, as DI McGrath’s death remained as per British law, and Mac Eoin was duly sentenced to death. The day after, he was transferred to the condemned row in Mountjoy. Seeing Arthur Griffith, Michael Staines and Eamonn Duggan in the exercise-grounds outside his window, he threw out to them the paper notification of his sentence, folded up in a match-box, for them to retrieve.[21]\n\nWith word getting around of his impending fate, Mac Eoin could enjoy at least a certain celebrity as a member of the ‘Big Four’, whose cells adjoined each other’s. One half of the quartet, Mac Eoin and John Donnelly, were under sentence of death, while the other pair, Frank Carty and Christie Carberry, had had the distinction of lengthy jail terms bestowed on them.\n\nDonnelly’s trial had been two days before Mac Eoin’s for his part in an ambush on Brunswick Street, Dublin, during which he received four bullets and required two operations to survive. While in the prison yard together, Mac Eoin confided in Donnelly the latest scheme to get them out; when one had failed, another was grown, like the heads of the legendary Hydra. This time it was by the IRA engineers, tasked by an unabating Collins with tunnelling along the canal side of Mountjoy and into the yard. Complications arose, however, thwarting escape yet again, and though Mac Eoin assured Donnelly that other plans were in the Collins pipeline, the sand in the hourglass for both of the condemned was fast running down.\n\nWith nothing else to do, Mac Eoin:\n\n…told me on exercise that one of the Chief Wardens, Mr Breslin, had smuggled in two revolvers, one for Mac Eoin and one for me, and on the morning that we were to be executed, we were to die fighting sooner than be hanged. We were just getting transferred to the condemned cells when the Truce [of 11th July 1921] came in.[22]\n\nEven with hostilities at a halt, Mac Eoin was not out of the fire quite yet. As a prequel to the peace talks in London, it was decreed that all elected representatives of Dáil Éireann who were under lock and key – totalling thirty-five TDs, scattered about in institutions like Mountjoy, Dundalk, Shrewsbury and Dartmoor Prisons, Ballykinlar and Curragh Camps, and Spike Island – be released in time to attend a Dáil session on the 16th August 1921.\n\nNot that anything in Ireland was ever quite so simple, for, in a pronouncement from Dublin Castle on the 6th August:\n\nHis Majesty’s Government have decided that one member, J.J. McKeon, who has been convicted of murder, cannot be released.\n\nWhat with all the ambushes, assassinations and gunplay dominating the headlines and history books, it is easy to forget that the War of Independence was as much a political as military one. Mac Eoin was TD for the Longford-Westmeath seat, a standing he had probably not given much thought to – the 16th August was to be the first opening of the Dáil in a long, long while – but which reared up as one of utmost importance now.\n\nIn response to the caveat:\n\nIt was officially stated last night [7th August 1921] on behalf of Dáil Éireann that there can be no meeting of Dáil Éireann until Commandant J.J. McKeon is released. It was added that the refusal to release him appears to indicate a desire on the part of the English Government to terminate the truce.\n\nFurther pronounced was how, unless Mac Eoin was freed within the next forty-eight hours, the Truce would indeed be considered null and void. Just when Mac Eoin, and Ireland as a whole, had been granted a respite, circumstances were conspiring to steal even that. With no Truce, the war would be resumed, and Mac Eoin’s sentence carried out, barring one of Collins’ attempts at playing Scarlet Pimpernel finally succeeding in the eleventh hour.[23]\n\nWit and Wisdom\n\nMac Eoin’s fate had already been of intense interest to figures on both sides of the Anglo-Irish divide, such as Frank Heming, Assistant Secretary to the Chief Secretary of Ireland’s office. According to a conversation with Mac Eoin in the Irish Embassy in London, in the very different time of 1938, Heming had already saved Mac Eoin’s before, in June 1921, when he was first scheduled to be hanged.\n\nRecognising the spanner that Mac Eoin’s death would throw in the burgeoning peace talks, Heming went so far as to enter 10 Downing Street unannounced, to the back-garden, where David Lloyd George was trying to relax with his grandchild. More politics was the last thing a peevish Prime Minister wanted to spend his rare break discussing, but Heming persisted, so he recounted to Mac Eoin:\n\nMr Heming told me he was explaining in detail what he considered would be the reactions to my execution when at this point the grandchild caught the Prime Minister’s hand and said, “Granddaddy! Come and play!”, to which he replied, “I cannot play now. I have to decide whether a man will live or die”, and that the child replied, “Let him live, Granddaddy! And come on and play!”; then Lloyd George turned to him, Heming, and said, “There is your answer! Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings comes the decision.”[24]\n\nThat is, if Lloyd George really allowed young children to decide state policy. A more hard-nosed analysis was provided by General Nevil Macready, commander of the British Army in Ireland, however little he liked the posting, loathing as he did the country and its convoluted ways. To him, the insurgency of the past three years had been nothing more than “an orgy of murder”, with culpability firmly on rebel shoulders.\n\nNonetheless, Macready kept himself objective when Alfred Cope, Assistant Under-Secretary for Ireland, came to seek his views on the Irish threats to refuse any further peace overtures should Mac Eoin not be freed. Why Mac Eoin should have been singled out in the first place, Macready did not know, putting it down to “some inscrutable reason” – one could imagine his eyes rolling to the heavens as he wrote this in his memoirs – of his civilian overseers in Westminster. In any case, he told Cope he would not protest Mac Eoin’s release, seeing it as a political rather than military responsibility. He repeated this answer when asked again, this time officially by his government.\n\nPrivately, Macready rather liked Mac Eoin, in so much as he liked anything Irish, having chatted with him a few times while the latter was recuperating in the King George V Military Hospital from the bullet-wound received in Mullingar. Mac Eoin was one of the few IRA men Macready had met possessive of a sense of humour, a distinction he shared with Collins. Hibernian humour was a subject on which Macready had much to say. “Although the Irish as a race are devoid of humour,” he advised, “it is essential to the peace of mind of anyone who has dealings with them.”\n\nThe exception to the rule, Mac Eoin “struck me as a more cheery individual than most of his fellows,” who tended to be of a “fanatical, bitter cast of countenance,” as Macready found them.[25]\n\nMac Eoin’s wit was on display during a visit in Mountjoy by Canon Markey, a priest from back home in Longford. To the padre’s blasé assurances that everything would be alright, Mac Eoin retorted that he had never known of anyone dropped with a rope around their neck and being the better for it. But Canon Markey was a man of boundless faith, and repeated to the Doubting Thomas before him that Mac Eoin would indeed be fine.[26]\n\nThe Final Lap\n\nAnd he was.\n\nFinally released as demanded and advised, Mac Eoin was awarded a hero’s welcome in his native Longford, the first time he had been back since his fateful departure for Dublin in February 1921, six months ago. Over a hundred people were present on the 11th August 1921, at his reception in St Mel’s College, Longford town. More crowds waited at Ballinalee as Mac Eoin drove there the following day to his home, accompanied by his mother and sister in the car, passing bonfires that lit up the morning darkness.\n\nYet more multitudes pressed to watch as he travelled next to Bunlahy, Granard, Clonfin and then back to Ballinalee, in what “can only be described as a triumphal march,” according to the Irish Independent, during which Mac Eoin was often obliged:\n\n…to descend from his motor to return the hearty welcome given him. Old women knelt down on bended knees as if in reverence to the great hero, whilst old men and children approached him with tear-dimmed eyes.[27]\n\nSimilarly appreciative were his fellow TDs and comrades-in-arms at the opening of Dáil Éireann in the Mansion House, Dublin, on the 16th August 1921. When his turn came to stand and take the oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic, it prompted a burst of applause. In his début as a political figure, Mac Eoin looked different to what many had been expecting of the famed guerrilla warrior but, then, so did many others, such as a boyish Collins and a delicate-seeming Richard Mulcahy.[28]\n\nAll three had previously attended another, more low-key meeting, one for the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. A long-time initiate in the secret fraternity, Mac Eoin was now elevated to its ruling council, as part of which he was directed by Collins, its president, to propose the election of Éamon de Valera for another presidency, that of the Irish Republic, at a parliamentary session on the 26th August 1921. Though the ironic hindsight – given the schism between Mac Eoin and de Valera to come, centred around the issue of a very different type of oath of allegiance – would border on ridiculous, it was a great honour for Mac Eoin, and Collins clearly had big plans for the man on whose behalf he had spent so much time and effort.[29]\n\nBut it was not all business between the pair. As Mac Eoin told Brian Farrell in an interview for Radio Telefis Éireann, many years later, on the 24th August 1962:\n\nFarrell: [Collins] had the reputation in his play hours of being a very boisterous man. Did you ever have any contact with this apart from your initial contact?\n\nMac Eoin: Only once, the day I was released. When I met him at Vaughan’s Hotel he jumped from the top of the steps outside the hotel down on top of me and flattened me on Parnell Square. That was the affectionate way he had of greeting me.\n\nFarrell: This sort of big boisterousness.\n\nMac Eoin: Yes, it was a loveable way.[30]\n\nTo be continued in: Shadows and Substance: Seán Mac Eoin and the Slide into Civil War, 1922\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Leonard, Joe (BMH / WS 547), pp. 16-9\n\n[2] Caffrey, John Anthony (BMH / WS 569), p. 9\n\n[3] Leonard, p. 19\n\n[4] Mac Eoin, Seán (BMH / WS 1716, Part II), pp. 205-6\n\n[5] Irish Times, 16/05/1921\n\n[6] Noyk, Michael (BMH / WS 707), p. 82\n\n[7] Flynn, Bartholomew (BMH / WS 1552), pp. 10-1\n\n[8] McKeon, James (BMH / WS 436), p. 21\n\n[9] Noyk, pp. 85-6\n\n[10] Mac Eoin, Part I, p. 34\n\n[11] Ibid, pp. 42-3\n\n[12] Ibid, pp. 67-8\n\n[13] Noyk, p. 85\n\n[14] Mac Eoin, Part II, pp. 208-11\n\n[15] Browne, Noël.

Charters of liberty! The Allies! The Empire! The Huns!”\n\nAs if to demonstrate, Redmond grew even more agitated in front of Milroy, yelling out: “Disgruntled cranks! Factionists! German gold!” and words to that effect.\n\nThis behaviour worsened as the warden tried calming him, and Milroy rang the bell on his desk for assistance. It was then that the ‘governor’ woke up from his daydream, his role-reversing fantasy of himself in the position of authority, with his political opponents humbled before him, and not, as he really was, a prisoner in Mountjoy.[1]\n\nAt least Milroy – a “well-known Sinn Feiner”, according to a contemporary newspaper report – could take solace in that he was nearing the end of his three-month sentence, from June to September 1915, for “having used language likely to discourage recruiting for His Majesty’s Army” in a public speech. He did not record his time behind bars, spent in the company of like-minded prisoners such as Seán Mac Diarmada and Liam Mellows, until two years later, in 1917, by which time the country was in a very different state, indeed.[2]\n\nNationalist Ireland had turned on itself, like Ouroboros with its tail in its mouth, one end consuming the other. It was now no longer necessary to imagine the degradation of Redmond, on whose shoulders the hopes of Irish self-rule had once rested. The mere sight of him as he left Trinity College, Dublin, in mid-1917, incited boos from the small crowd outside the front gate.\n\nThe jeers grew louder, as the hecklers followed Redmond up Westmoreland Street, prompting some civic-minded passers-by to form a protective ring around the beleaguered politician. Even so, it was only after he hurried inside the first building to hand for refuge that the danger could be said to have passed.\n\n“I am quite sure that if any of the mob had offered physical violence to Redmond,” remembered one witness, “I would have joined in.” To sixteen-year-old Todd Andrews and many others in Sinn Féin, Redmond was “the epitome of politicians in general, and all politicians were regarded as low, dirty and treacherous.”[3]\n\nDivine Law\n\nIt was not for want of trying on Redmond’s part. On the 7th March 1917, he and rest of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tried to break the impasse over Home Rule, its long-cherished project, when T.P. O’Connor, as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Scotland, introduced a motion in the House of Commons, calling on that august assembly “without further delay to confer upon Ireland the free institutions long promised.”[4]\n\nDavid Lloyd George declined. Or rather, the Prime Minister declared that Home Rule was there for the parts of Ireland which wanted it. But, in regards to the remainder, those who were Irishmen in name while being, as he put it, “as alien in blood, in religious faith, in traditions, in outlook from the rest of Ireland as the inhabitants of Fife and Aberdeen” – no, Home Rule was not something he would force on them.\n\nThese ‘alien’ exceptions were the Unionists, who had shifted from opposing Home Rule in its entirety to demanding that various counties be given the option of remaining outside the jurisdiction of any new Dublin parliament, answerable only to the one at Westminster, just as before. As these Unionists were concentrated largely in Ulster, such allowances would amount in practice to the exclusion of those six counties in the north-east corner of the island.\n\nPerfect from the Ulster Unionists’ point of view but political suicide for Redmond should this Partition happen on his watch. Unfortunately for the Irish Party, such passions were beyond the ability of Englishmen to relate to.\n\n“We often cut up counties in England without engaging in civil war,” Harold Spender, a pro-Home Rule journalist, wrote to Redmond on the 29th March 1917. “There is no divine law against moving a county landmark.”[5]\n\nDivine law or not, that even a sympathetic individual like Spender could be so obtuse did not bode well for the IPP’s chances of rallying enough support to halt Partition. Yet all its MPs could do was try their best.\n\n(Not) Answering the Irish Question\n\nWhen T.P. O’Connor dined with Lloyd George on the 22nd January 1917, his lobbying made little headway. To O’Connor’s dismay, the Prime Minister appeared to have spared Home Rule little thought beforehand, being content with Partition as the only credible solution. He was more interested in the possibility of conscription for Ireland in order to solve the need for manpower on the Western Front, a policy which O’Connor was keen to stress as a debacle in the making.\n\nWhile Lloyd George continuously reassured O’Connor, over the course of their meal together, of his desire to remain on tight terms with his Irish allies, his actions were to fall short of his words, especially if they risked offending the Ulster Unionist presence in Parliament.[6]\n\nNot that Redmond could afford to give up. “I hope you will read this as it is from a friend,” wrote his brother, William, to the Prime Minister, on the 4th March 1917, three days before their showdown in Westminster. The MP for East Clare began with an attempt to rekindle warm memories: “When you entered the House I was then an old member. We fought many battles on the same side.”\n\nAs the letter went on, a slight edge of pleading crept in:\n\nI do not want anything from you but this – to settle the Irish question – you are strong enough. Give the Ulster men proportional and full representation and they cannot complain.\n\nWilliam Redmond ended with a stark warning: “If there is no settlement there will be nothing but disaster all round for all.”[7]\n\n“There is nothing I would like better to be the instrument for settling the Irish question,” Lloyd George wrote back two days later, on the 6th March. After all, as he pointed out: “I was elected to the House purely as a Home Rule candidate…and I have voted steadily for Home Rule ever since.”\n\nWhich was true enough. But he clearly did not feel the same urgency as William Redmond, nor thought the matter as simple to solve as the other man seemed to: “But you know just as well as I do what the difficulty is in settling the Irish question, and if any man can show me a way out of that I should indeed be happy.”[8]\n\nIn other words: my hands are tied, so too bad.\n\nMiracles and the Lack of\n\nAppropriately enough, after his efforts in private had been exhausted, it was William Redmond who publicly made the case before Parliament for immediate and unconditional Home Rule. He looked every bit his fifty-five years, much of which had been spent in the service of his country.\n\n“Major Redmond’s hair is white now, and he has lost much of his boyish air,” wrote one observer. “The war has deeply lined his face, and his eyes are more deeply set than in his political swashbuckling days.”[9]\n\nDressed in khaki, as befitting his rank of major in the British Army, he had stood to second T.P. O’Connor’s motion on the 7th March. To Stephen Gwynn, the MP for Galway City, “that debate will always be remembered by those who heard it for one speech” and that was William Redmond’s.[10]\n\nAt a length of half an hour, his piece was a relatively short one by the standards of the chamber. In place of the quantity of words, however, William Redmond made up for in quality. Dark and bitter mistakes had been made in the past, and not all on one side, he conceded, but there was no point in brooding on the past.\n\nInstead, he appealed directly to Edward Carson to meet with his Nationalist opposites – for the sake of the future and for the Irishmen who were, even now, fighting and dying together in the same trenches – so they could come to some arrangement on the basis of self-government for their shared island.\n\nIf safeguards were what the Ulster Unionists wanted, then Redmond promised to go to any lengths necessary to reassure them, even if that included – he suggested tantalisingly – the acceptance of a Prime Minister from Ulster to head the first Irish Government.[11]\n\nWhile there were other speeches that day, William Redmond’s was the one that counted as far as many were concerned. O’Connor could hear the heavy breathing of his fellow MPs seated around him, while others who watched from the gallery – so he was told afterwards – were so overcome with emotion that they wept and sobbed unabashedly.[12]\n\nGwynn was similarly awed. “It was a speech, in short, that made one believe in impossibilities,” as he put it, “but in Parliament no miracles happen.”[13]\n\nWhen it was clear to the chamber that Lloyd George was no closer than before in supporting an all-Ireland settlement, with Ulster included, John Redmond rose to deliver the piece de resistance of the day. The Prime Minister, he declared, had brought Ireland face to face with revolution. From now on, the country would have to be governed with an unsheathed sword and, as such, it was pointless to continue the debate.\n\nAnd, with that, reported the Irish Times:\n\nThe Nationalists cheered to the echo as their leader left his seat and stalked majestically down the gangway, and along the floor of the House. They followed him, shouting and jeering as they went, while members looked on with serious faces.[14]\n\nIf nothing else, the Irish Party still knew how to make an exit. Not that it made any real difference.\n\nWhen O’Connor and Joe Devlin, the MP for West Belfast, met Lloyd George later in the month, on the 28th March, time had done nothing to change the Prime Minister’s mind. “LG says that the Orangemen still insist on the 6 counties and was hopeless of getting them to move from that position,” O’Connor reported to John Redmond. “We told him he ought to deny them; he says he could not.”[15]\n\nDespite the uphill struggle they faced, O’Connor still kept the faith. “If [Lloyd George] persists in his whole 6-county proposal,” he told Redmond on the 1st April 1917, “he will fail ignominiously for we can tear such a proposal to tatters in the House of Commons.”[16]\n\nPerhaps, but Ireland was no longer waiting to give its representatives that chance.\n\n‘A More Reasonable Outlook’\n\nWilliam Redmond’s celebrated performance in Parliament turned out to be his swansong. “We deeply regret to learn that Major William H.K. Redmond, MP, of the Royal Irish Regiment,” reported the Irish Times on the 11th June 1917, three months later, “was killed in action on the 7th inst. in the brilliant and successful attack on the Ridge of Messines.”[17]\n\nThe uniform William Redmond had worn while in the House of Commons had been no pose. Nor was his plea for reconciliation between Nationalist and Unionist Ireland anything less than sincere. That Irish soldiers from the two traditions could fight together in the same trenches was proof enough, to him, that a better, happier future was possible together.\n\nTrue, differences remained – William Redmond was not so naïve as to think otherwise. “The soldier in France who was a home ruler at home probably remains so,” he admitted, writing publicly in May 1917. “The Ulster soldier who disapproved of home rule probably does so still”:\n\nBut the meeting of men of diverse opinions in the field has undoubtedly created an atmosphere of friendliness which must make it easier to adjust differences and which should induce a more reasonable outlook upon things at home.[18]\n\nWhen William Redmond returned to his regiment in France, in time for the push towards a German strongpoint near Messines, his main fear was that he would be held back from the Front on account of his age.\n\n“He felt absolutely miserable at the prospect of being kept behind,” remembered an army chaplain for the Royal Irish Fusiliers. “He had used every influence with General [William Bernard] Hickie to get over the top with the men”:\n\nHe spoke in the most feeling manner of what awaited the poor fellows, and longed to share their sufferings and their fate.\n\nIn that regard, he was to have his wish. When permission was given for him to join the firing-line, he informed a fellow Irish officer “with real delight and boyishness in his voice”, to the other man’s wonder: “I have never seen anyone so pleased as he was.”[19]\n\n‘Tired Out’\n\nFor his older brother, it was a particularly wounding blow. “The loss of him meant to John Redmond a loss of personal efficiency,” wrote Gwynn. “Sorrow gave a strong grip to depression on a brooding mind which had always a proneness to melancholy.” For William had been more than a sibling to John, but a counsellor too, and perhaps the sole one:\n\nHe had who temperamentally shared his own point of view. Willie Redmond was the only man who could break through his brother’s constitutional reserve and could force him into discussion. In the months that were to come such a man was badly needed.[20]\n\nJohn Redmond’s melancholia-prone mind had already been brooding for quite some time. “Redmond is very depressed,” wrote T.P. O’Connor to John Dillon, on the 18th May 1916. “He seems to be tired out and sick of the whole position and has again and again referred to the possibility of his retiring from politics.”[21]\n\nDillon, for his part, did not bother so much with sympathy. “It is touch and go whether we can save the movement and keep the Party in existence,” the MP for East Mayo admitted to O’Connor on the 19th August 1916. “A great deal depends on the extent to which the Chairman realises the position and on what his intentions as to the future are.” That “on these points I am to a large extent in the dark” did not bode well for saving their life’s work.[22]\n\nA month later, on the 26th September 1916, Dillon was even more frank to O’Connor: “Enthusiasm and trust in Redmond and the Party is dead [underlined in original text] so far as the mass of the people is concerned.”\n\nA speech Redmond made in Waterford, in October 1916, promising a tougher line in the future, gave the Constitutional cause fresh drive, as even the habitually glum Dillon agreed. To him, the speech was “all that could be desired, and it will do an incalculable amount of good. It has already had an immense effect on the country.”\n\nThere would no further negotiations with the British Government, Redmond had declared, only a demand for the release of those interned since the Easter Rising, a call for General Maxwell – his work long done in suppressing sedition – to be withdrawn from the country, and a firm resistance to any possibility of conscription in Ireland.\n\nAfter months of political deadlock, with their elected representatives appearing no more than hostages to fate, this bold new stance, in Dillon’s opinion, “took the country by surprise, and produced a great wave of reaction in favour of his leadership and of the Party. If that attitude is resolutely adhered to the country will come all right.”[23]\n\nDead Cat Bounce\n\nIf, if, if…\n\nThe great wave of reaction had receded by the start of 1917, leaving the Party as stranded as a beached whale. A by-election drubbing in North Roscommon in February – the first of the wins to Sinn Féin that year – was enough to plunge Redmond into a crisis of faith.\n\nIn a letter intended for the Party followers, Redmond acknowledged the fork on the road to which they had come. If North Roscommon was an abnormality, “a freak election, due to…momentary passion” over how the winner, Count Plunkett, had had a son executed after the Rising, then that was all well and good. But, on the other hand, should the result represent “a change of principle of policy on the part of a considerable mass of the Irish people,” then the entire future of the Constitutional cause, the raison d’être of the Irish Parliamentary Party, had just been questioned…and found wanting.\n\nIf so, then Redmond was prepared to give way graciously: “Let the Irish people replace us, by all means, by other and, I hope, better men if they so choose.”[24]\n\nTha"
