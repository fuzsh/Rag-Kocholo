Since then, Bugs’ zany antics in hundreds of cartoon favorites have made him a legend throughout the world.\n\nThis cool, collected, carrot-chomping rabbit is the unequivocal superstar of the Looney Tunes family. With never a “hare” out of place he always manages to outsmart his adversaries, whoever they may be. He’s a real American icon who has graced the TV and cinema screens the world over.\n\nBugs Bunny’s cartoons have twice been nominated for Academy Awards, and his Knighty Knight Bugs won a coveted Oscar. Bugs has starred in four films in addition to his hundreds of animated shorts and 21 prime time television specials.\n\nBugs Bunny celebrated his 80th birthday on July 27, 2020 . . . exactly 80 years from the premiere of A Wild Hare on July 27, 1940.\n\nGEORGE DAUGHERTY\n\nConductor George Daugherty is one of the classical music world's most diverse artists. In addition to his 40-year conducting career which has included appearances with the world's leading orchestras, ballet companies, opera houses, and concert artists, Daugherty is also an Emmy Award-winning / five-time Emmy nominated creator whose professional profile includes major credits as a director, writer, and producer for television, film, innovative and unique concerts, and the live theater.\n\nHe made his debut with The Philadelphia Orchestra in 2000, and has since conducted the orchestra numerous times at both Verizon Hall at Kimmel Center, and at Mann Music Center, most recently in January 2022, in programs of both film music and classical repertoire.

He has been on the conducting staffs of American Ballet Theatre, the Bavarian State Opera Ballet, La Scala Ballet, and Teatro Regio di Torino Ballet, was music director of The Louisville Ballet, Ballet Chicago, Chicago City Ballet, Alabama Ballet, and Eglevsky Ballet, and has guest conducted for scores of international companies. In 2016 Daugherty was appointed Music Director of the famed and iconic Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, with whom he made his debut conducting at The Kennedy Center Opera House in March, 2017, with the Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra. From 2012 to 2015, he was Music Director of Ballet San Jose, where he conducted nearly 50 performances per season for the company, with Symphony Silicon Valley in the orchestra pit. In summer 2013, he made his debut conducting The Russian National Orchestra at the internationally acclaimed Napa Valley Festival del Sol, presiding over the reconstruction of a long-lost Fokine ballet with music by Rachmaninoff, plus an international ballet gala. He has conducted numerous versions of every full-length ballet, as well as scores of works by countless major choreographers ranging from George Balanchine to Sir Frederick Ashton.\n\nAs a director, writer, and producer of music-based television programs, Daugherty has created several major productions for the ABC Television Network project, including a primetime animation-and-live action production of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, which he created, co-wrote, conducted, and directed, and for which he won a Prime Time Emmy Award as producer (in collaboration with producing partner David Ka Lik Wong), as well as numerous other major awards (including an additional Emmy nomination as conductor and music director.) He (and David Ka Lik Wong) also collaborated with The Joy Luck Club author Amy Tan on a television series adaptation of her celebrated children's book Sagwa, The Chinese Siamese Cat. The Emmy Award-winning 80-episode series debuted on PBS in the fall of 2001 as a daily-animated children's television series, produced in cooperation with Sesame Workshop, PBS Kids, and CineGroupe. Daugherty executive produced, and also wrote a large number of the animated tales.\n\nDaugherty also received an Emmy nomination for Rhythm & Jam, his ABC television network specials which taught the basics of music to a teenage audience, which he created and produced with Mr. Wong.\n\nIn 1998, Daugherty received the biannual Indiana Governor's Arts Award from the state of his birth, in recognition for his artistic contributions not only in Indiana, but also throughout the rest of the country.

This award was especially meaningful to Daugherty, since his great-great-great-grandfather was the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Daugherty was recently honored to be appointed to the Board of Directors of The Nevada School of The Arts.\n\nIn 1990, Daugherty created, directed, and conducted the hit Broadway musical Bugs Bunny On Broadway, a live-orchestra-and-film stage production which sold-out its extended run at New York's Gershwin Theatre on Broadway, and has since played to critical acclaim and sold-out houses all over the world. The Bugs Bunny symphonic concert tradition continued when Daugherty and producing partner David Ka Lik Wong launched a new version, Bugs Bunny At The Symphony, in 2010, with double World Premieres at the Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Symphony, and the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The next version of the concert, Bugs Bunny at the Symphony II, also created by Daugherty and Wong, premiered in 2013 with world premieres at the Hollywood Bowl/Los Angeles Philharmonic and National Symphony at Wolf Trap.
