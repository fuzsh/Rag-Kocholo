        "text": "Weâve all heard of famous families like the Kardashians and the Beckhams. But some family connections are less immediately obvious.\n\nFor instance, did you know that footballers Frank Lampard and Jamie Redknapp are cousins? Sandra Redknapp is Jamieâs mother and Frankâs aunt, and the two boys often played football together growing up.\n\nBBC Bitesize takes a look at three intriguing family connections that you might not be aware of.\n\nLord Byron and Ada Lovelace\n\nWhat do an infamous Romantic poet and the worldâs first computer programmer have in common? Why, theyâre father and daughter!\n\nAda King, Countess of Lovelace was Lord Byronâs only legitimate daughter, from his short-lived marriage to Annabella Byron (nÃ©e Milbanke). Within weeks of her birth in 1815, Byron left the family and moved overseas, never to return again.\n\nAnnabella heavily encouraged Ada to study subjects like mathematics and science, unusual for a woman at that time, because she didnât want Ada to follow the path of her father into poetry. Ada excelled in these subjects and at the age of 17, was introduced to the mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage.\n\nHe was working on a prototype of a computer, known as the Analytical Engine, which Ada studied in detail. In her notes she explained how the machine could use codes to work and repeat a series of instructions, which has since been described as an early computer program.\n\nIn recognition of her achievements, the second Tuesday of October is known as Ada Lovelace Day, dedicated to celebrating the work of women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). When the U.S. Department of Defense developed a new computer language in the 1980s, they called it Ada.\n\nOnce described as âmad, bad and dangerous to knowâ, Lord Byron had a scandalous private life but was also one of the leading figures of the Romantic poetry movement. Having fled England in 1816, he lived in Italy for many years, where he spent time with fellow literary greats Percy Shelley and his wife, Mary Shelley.\n\nIn July 1823, Byron signed up to fight in the Greek War of Independence but he died from a fever on 19 April 1824 and his body was returned to his ancestral home in England. Despite their distant relationship, Ada requested that she be buried next to her father upon her death.\n\nDame Angela Lansbury and George Lansbury\n\nA legend of stage and screen, Dame Angela Lansbury famously played detective Jessica Fletcher in the hit US TV show Murder, She Wrote. Born in 1925, she was thrice nominated for an Oscar and won several Tony awards, as well as starring in Disney classics Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Beauty and the Beast.\n\nBut within her family tree, there are a number of influential political figures, and not just in the UK. For starters, her grandfather George Lansbury was Leader of the Labour Party between 1932 and 1935.\n\nPrior to leading the Labour party, Mr Lansbury was elected mayor of Poplar, London, promising to introduce a Â£4 minimum weekly wage for municipal workers, including women. This put him at odds with the central government and he was eventually jailed for several weeks in 1921, along with other councillors, following the Poplar rates rebellion. They had refused to pass on a portion of the money the council raised from taxing residents to the central government, arguing that they wanted the money spent on local services.\n\nDame Angela Lansbury was also related to the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, Penny Mordaunt. Angela Lansbury was the cousin of Ms Mordauntâs grandmother. In 2022, Ms Mordaunt took on the role of Leader of the House of Commons.\n\nFormer Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull has also revealed that he is related to Angela Lansbury. In a social media post showing a photo of them backstage at the Theatre Royal Sydney, he referred to her as his cousin and later called her âAunty Angelaâ."
