        "text": "‘Anyone can rat, but it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to re-rat.’\n\n- Winston Churchill on changing parties (twice)\n\nAs the son of a Conservative grandee, naturally, Churchill grew up seeing himself in the realm of the Conservative Party. He greatly respected the Conservative Prime Minister of his youth, Lord Salisbury. After a failed attempt in 1899, he was elected as the Conservative MP of Oldham in 1900 at the age of 25.\n\nChurchill in 1904\n\nChurchill did later say he may have considered standing as a Liberal, but as a strong supporter of the Boer War and a Unionist, he may not have been welcomed into the Party. He saw himself primarily as an advocate One-Nation Conservatism/Tory Democracy.\n\nChurchill made his maiden speech within a week of taking his seat in Parliament. As the subject of the day was the Boer War, Churchill, having recently served as a war correspondent and a lieutenant in South Africa, became an authoritative voice on the war, arguing for more humane treatment of the Boers, whom he had come to respect.\n\nMuch of the Party’s leadership, like Lord Salisbury and Joseph Chamberlain, were friends and admirers of Churchill’s father, Lord Randolph Churchill, who served as Indian Secretary, Chancellor and Leader of the Commons. Thus, he was welcomed with open arms by the Conservative Party leadership.\n\nHowever, Churchill soon gained a reputation as an independently-minded MP and became one of the leaders of The Hooligans, a small faction of the Conservative Party, who were unhappy with the premiership of Arthur Balfour (1902 – 1905). Churchill politically was certainly less right-wing than the Party’s leadership. As an MP in Manchester, he had seen firsthand the deprivation of inner-city slums, which gave him vague notions of wanting to help ‘the common man’ that he did not see reflected by the government. He often found himself on the same page as the Liberals in his criticism of his own Party. He was also slightly resentful that despite being seen as a rising star in the Party and being popular with the media, he was not given a position in government.\n\nThere is a great description at the time of Churchill by Beatrice Webb (a senior figure in The Fabian Society, a left-wing think-tank), which gives us a critical but insightful view of Churchill in his mid-20s:\n\n‘Restless, almost intolerably so, without capacity for sustained or unexcited labour, egotistical, bumptious, shallow-minded and reactionary, but with a certain personal magnetism, great pluck and some originality, not of intellect, but of character….Talked exclusively about himself.…No notion of scientific research…..But his pluck, courage, resourcefulness and great tradition may carry him far’.\n\nThe distance between himself and his Party was most vividly demonstrated by the debate regarding Imperial trade. Joseph Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary (1895 – 1903), had begun to advocate in favour of imposing mutual tariffs within the Empire, a system known as ‘Imperial Preference’, which he believed would have kept Britain ahead of its rivals, the USA and Germany as an economic and industrial power. To Chamberlain, this would form the basis of an economic union between Britain and the Empire, which would become a political union and thus give birth to the ‘Federation of the Empire’, as he called it, with an Imperial Parliament representing the nations of the Empire.\n\nWhile dining with Chamberlain, Churchill was told, ‘Why don’t you take up some cause really worth fighting for, such as protection of our markets against world competition, and a closer economic union with the Colonies?’\n\nChurchill took it upon himself to study British trade, boasting that he ‘learnt economics in eight weeks’. He ultimately decided that he would oppose Chamberlain and thus became the chief Conservative opponent of Imperial Preference.\n\nIn the Commons, Chamberlain dared Churchill to attempt to make the case for Free Trade in Birmingham, which was Chamberlain’s home city where he was worshiped. Churchill accepted the challenge and his speech attracted a group of 40,000 protesters.\n\nThe issue bitterly divided the Conservative Party, and Chamberlain soon resigned as Colonial Secretary. However, Churchill’s criticism continued and was now aimed at the prime minister, Arthur Balfour, who, in order to maintain the unity of the Party, remained ambivalent on the issue. However, he would only tolerate so much from Churchill. Michael Sheldon describes the scene of a debate in the Commons regarding British trade in March 1904:\n\nChurchill rose from the bench behind [Arthur] Balfour. The prime minister could easily guess what was coming – more pointed criticisms from a man who was supposed to be one of his followers. In the words of an excited parliamentary commentator, ‘A nasty look came into [Balfour’s] face which transfigured it in the same way that the claws do a cat’s paw.’ At that instant the prime minister apparently decided that he had put up with enough from Winston. With uncharacteristic haste, he strode out of the chamber and didn’t come back. One by one the other ministers of the Crown got up and followed their chief as did most of the backbenchers.\n\nYoung Titan, The Making of Winston Churchill\n\nAs Balfour’s leadership was increasingly seen as failing, and with Churchill’s bridges burnt at the top of the party, making advancement unlikely, he defected to the Liberal Party, who had, like Winston, been pro-free trade and often supported his criticisms of the Conservative leadership.\n\nChurchill quickly made friends with Henry Asquith and David Lloyd-George, both future leaders of the party. As the Liberals came into power in 1905, the following year, he was appointed as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and became a member of Asquith’s cabinet at the age of 33 as President of the Board of Trade in 1908, where he became one of the founders of the Welfare State. He quickly became an adherent of ‘New Liberalism’ and continued his rise through the ranks of Asquith’s government, becoming Home Secretary in 1910 and First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911.\n\nChurchill (Under-Secretary to the Colonies) and Lloyd George (President of the Board of Trade) in 1907\n\nWhen the Conservative Party were invited to form a coalition government with the Liberals in 1915, in the wake of Churchill’s Gallipoli disaster, their leader Bonar Law demanded Churchill be removed from the cabinet. Asquith compromised and made Churchill Chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster, which led him to leave the cabinet altogether and return to the army as a Lieutenant-Colonel in Flanders.\n\nAfter the fall of the Liberal-Conservative coalition in 1922, Churchill lost his parliamentary seat in Dundee and failed to regain a seat the following year. As Asquith gave his support to the minority Labour government in 1923 and the Liberals became increasingly unpopular, Churchill left the Party, the following year he unsuccessfully stood as an Independent at a 1924 Westminster by-election.\n\nHe made an important speech at a Conservative Club in Liverpool in May 1924, which is often seen as his springboard his return to the Conservatives, in which he called for the Liberals to unite behind the leadership of the Conservative Party rather than the Labour Party, in order to fight socialism together.\n\n‘We should make common causes, that we should stand together, and, laying aside every impediment, that we should fight shoulder to shoulder in the endeavour by every means in our power to secure the defeat of Socialism’.\n\nIn turn, he encouraged the Conservatives to adopt a more ‘progressive platform of public policy’ in order to accommodate the Liberals.\n\nIn the build-up to the 1924 General Election, Churchill was asked by Stanley Baldwin, the Leader of the Conservative Party, to stand as the Conservative candidate for Epping; he agreed but formally stood as a Constitutionalist (a label used by those who campaigned for a Con-Lib coalition).\n\nUpon being elected as MP for Epping, Churchill formally rejoined the Conservative Party and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by Baldwin, now the new prime minister.\n\nChurchill wasn’t alone in making this transition, Lord Kennet, Freddie Guest, Godfrey Collins and Viscount Greenwood all similarly made the transition from Liberal to Conservative in the 1920s.\n\nChurchill and Baldwin in the 1920s\n\nWhile Churchill had experience working on the economy as President of the Board of Trade, his Chancellorship is broadly seen as unsuccessful. He made some gains, such as lowering the pension age and providing further support for the mining industry, but his decision to return to the gold standard was considered a fatal error.\n\nWith the defeat of Baldwin at the 1929 election, Churchill would be ousted from office and would remain isolated from the party’s leadership for the next decade, returning to the role he played in his mid-20s as an independently minded critic of the Conservative leadership and a part-time writer. Churchill would not return to cabinet until 1939, when Baldwin’s successor Neville Chamberlain appointed him First Lord of the Admiralty."
