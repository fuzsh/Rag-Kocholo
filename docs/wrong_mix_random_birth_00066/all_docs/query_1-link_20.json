        "text": "DAVID Lloyd George is said to be one of the 20th century’s most famous radicals.\n\nHe was also the first and only Welshman to hold the office of Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1890 he was elected Liberal MP for Caernarvon, aged 27.\n\nDuring his career he was promoted to Chancellor and went on to introduce state pensions for the first time and declare a war on poverty.\n\nDuring the war, he worked as Minister for Munitions, organising and inspiring the war effort.\n\nAfter forming a government in December 1916, George was hailed the man who had won the war, and in 1918 the coalition won a huge majority.\n\nIn 1944 he was made Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, and died the following year aged 82.\n\nHe is buried on the banks of the River Dwyfor."
