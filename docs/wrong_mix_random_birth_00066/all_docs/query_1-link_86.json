        "text": "1) Did Smithy say yes?\n\nLet's kick off with the biggie, shall we? It's been the question on everyone's lips for the last five years - did Smithy accept or reject Nessa's marriage proposal? After Smithy introduced his new girlfriend Sonia to his friends and family at Christmas, the characters - and audience - could tell she wasn't \"The One\", but nothing could have prepared us for the cliffhanger at the end of the episode, with Nessa asking Smithy to marry her. The pair ended up in bed together earlier in the episode, and it seemed as though it wasn't the only time it had happened between the end of season three in 2010 and the Christmas Special in 2019! But does that mean the pair would plan to tie the knot? Surely we'll get an answer either way this Christmas...\n\n2) What happened to Dave Coaches?\n\nDave Coaches didn't appear in the 2019 Christmas Special - and it makes sense, too, given that Nessa jilted him at the altar in the series three finale following Smithy's outburst. It would be a bit odd to see him return, given that Nessa was his connection to the main characters, but given it's the last ever episode, we're sure that Ruth Jones and James Corden could find a way to wiggle him back in. For old times' sake.\n\n3) Are Pete and Dawn still together?\n\nOne of British telly's most volatile relationships, Pete and Dawn Sutcliffe were on-again-off-again pretty much the whole way through the original series AND the last Christmas Special in 2019. Who can forget their iconic vow renewal ceremony with Pete's extravagant ring?! As integral supporting characters to the show, we'd be VERY surprised if Pete and Dawn didn't make an appearance... But will they still be together?\n\n4) Is Neil the baby still called... Neil the baby?\n\nNessa and Smithy's son was still being referred to as Neil \"the baby\" in the 2019 Christmas Special, with Smithy's girlfriend Sonia even questioning the moniker, but will his friends and family STILL call him Neil \"the baby\" in the upcoming Christmas Special? The character was born in the series finale of season two, which aired in December 2008, and would make him now around 16-years-old - so it remains to be seen if he's kept hold of the nickname or whether it's been dropped as he entered his teenage years...\n\n5) Do they still live on Barry Island?\n\nThe Shipman family moved a few times over the course of the series, eventually settling on Barry Island around Stacey's family. But are they still there? Or could they be planning a move back to Gavin's hometown of Essex? Their moves have caused total uproar in the previous series, so it wouldn't be a surprise if that storyline crops up once more in the last ever episode!\n\n6) Is Smithy's curry order the same?\n\nCan you get it all correct? Ready... Go! Chicken bhuna, lamb bhuna, prawn bhuna, mushroom rice, bag of chips, keema naan and nine poppadoms! But does Smithy still stick to the same order when he has a takeaway these days? And will we even find out during the Christmas Special, or will Mick be roasting up his world-famous Christmas turkey instead?\n\n7) WHAT happened on the fishing trip?\n\nIt's unlikely we'll actually find out what happened on the fishing trip between Uncle Bryn West and his nephew Jason West - creators and writers Ruth Jones and James Corden have even said themselves that they don't know what happened! It's a funny long-running joke throughout the series, and we've been given snippets of the situation that occurred between the pair... But nothing has ever fit together or made any sense whatsoever! We guess the real question is... Do we even WANT to know what happened on the fishing trip?\n\nJames Corden as Neil 'Smithy' Smith: Then\n\nJames was already a household name by the time he appeared on our screens as Smithy. Having worked with Ruth Jones on Fat Friends from 2000 to 2005, the pair got their heads together to create the show. James had additionally originated the role of Timms in the original London production of The History Boys in 2004, and also appeared in 2006 film Starter For 10 alongside James McAvoy.\n\nRuth Jones: Now\n\nPost-Barry life was pretty major for Ruth - landing her own seasonal chat show and appearing in plenty of drama series including Torchwood, Marple and Hattie. She also co-created Stella, additionally starring as the titular character which ran for six series. Ruth was appointed an MBE in 2014 for services to entertainment, and even launched a successful career as an author - penning three fiction novels: Never Greener, Us Three and Love Untold.\n\nJoanna Page as Stacey Shipman (née West): Then\n\nJoanna had already featured in a major TV drama AND an iconic movie by the time she took on the role of Barry's princess, Stacey - namely the BBC adaptation of David Copperfield which launched the career of Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe, as well as Christmas staple, Love Actually. Remember? She's the, er, stunt double who falls for her co-star, played by Martin Freeman.\n\nJoanna Page: Now\n\nAs well as appearances on a fair few panel shows as herself, Joanna also gave a pretty memorable performance as Queen Elizabeth I in Doctor Who's 50th anniversary episode, plus a few other small roles on various TV shows. She notably took on the character of Pig on the second series of The Masked Dancer, but was the second famous face to be booted off the series. She joined the Loose Women panel as a regular in 2023, and also starred in TV film Men Up which followed the story of a real-life clinical trial for Viagra in the 90s.\n\nMathew Horne as Gavin Shipman: Then\n\nMathew started his career as a comedian, performing as a comedy duo under Mat and Mackinnon with a friend from university. The pair took to the stage at the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe, where Catherine Tate was in the crowd and offered him a spot on her show, The Catherine Tate Show. Playing the role of Jamie, he's returned to the character a few times over the years - most recently in the 2022 film The Nan Movie. He also starred in British TV series Teachers and an episode of Doc Martin, before hitting it big as the loveable Gavin Shipman.\n\nMathew Horne: Now\n\nMathew understandably shot to fame after the first series of Gav and Stace, most notably as a sort of double act with James Corden. The pair hosted a fair few TV shows - including the actual BRIT Awards, co-hosting with Kylie Minogue (!) - as well as their own sketch show, and not-hugely-successful film Lesbian Vampire Killers. He also starred as eccentric headteacher Shaquille Fraser in Bad Education and had various roles on Drunk History.\n\nAlison Steadman as Pam Shipman: Then\n\nAlison was already a hugely established actress by the time she appeared in Gavin and Stacey! Having started out her career in theatre performances, she later had roles in loads of films including Shirley Valentine and was a well known TV star too - having been in The Singing Detective, Kavanagh QC plus her memorable turn as Mrs. Bennett in the 1997 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Of course, she also appeared in Fat Friends alongside her Gav and Stace co-stars Ruth Jones and James Corden - and was even awarded an OBE in 2000.\n\nLarry Lamb as Mick Shipman: Then\n\nLarry didn't immediately launch a career in acting once he hit adulthood. He initially worked as a lorry driver's assistant before working in the oil industry across Libya and Canada. While in Nova Scotia, he caught an interest in amateur acting and performed at a festival. On his return to the UK, he scored a role in the BBC's soap Triangle, having smaller parts in the likes of Lovejoy, A Touch of Frost, Taggart, Casualty, Midsomer Murders and The Bill - plus a fair amount of theatre work.\n\nLarry Lamb: Now\n\nDuring his original tenure on Gav and Stace, Larry simultaneously landed another major role on British telly - Evil Archie Mitchell on EastEnders. Worlds away from the loveable and affable father of Gavin, Archie was a wrong'un on so many levels, but he finally got his comeuppance. Larry also starred in 2017 film The Hatton Garden Job as ringleader Brian Reader, reunited with Alison Steadman on Love and Marriage, joined the cast of New Tricks and played Dennis in 2023 series The Inheritance alongside Gaynor Faye and Samantha Bond.\n\nRob Brydon as Uncle Bryn West: Then\n\nRob was another familiar face by the time Gavin and Stacey aired in 2007. Starting out his career in radio, he had a small but important role as the Traffic Warden in Guy Ritchie's breakout film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He then co-created and co-starred in Human Remains alongside future Gav and Stace colleague Julia Davis - with Ruth Jones also in the cast. He then performed as taxi driver Keith Barret in Marion and Geoff, joined the QI panel, had a role in Little Britain and also performed in the BBC adaptation of Oliver Twist alongside Timothy Spall, Edward Fox, Tom Hardy, Sophie Okonedo and Sarah Lancashire among many other famous faces.\n\nMelanie Walters as Gwen West: Then\n\nMelanie had been a working actor since the 80s, starring in the likes of The District Nurse, We are Seven, Telltale and A Mind to Kill, plus small parts on Coronation Street, The Bill, Casualty and Holby City, but it was her turn as Stacey's omelette-loving mum that really cemented her as a well-know face in British telly.\n\nMelanie Walters: Now\n\nSince her original role as Gwen, Melanie has appeared in the likes of Hollyoaks as Bonnie Bevan, Being Human as vampire Emma, Gav and Stace co-star Ruth Jones' series Stella, Doc Martin and Father Brown - as well as films such as Submarine and Resistance. Melanie even had a go at panto, starring as the Fairy Godmother in a performance of Cinderella in 2014 in Newport.\n\nSteffan Rhodri: Now\n\nSince Dave's heart was broken by Ness, he had a small part in blockbuster Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, playing a wizard whose likeness was temporarily stolen by main character Ron Weasley. He's also been in Father Brown, A Touch of Cloth, Cucumber, Three Girls, A Very English Scandal, House of the Dragon and Men Up, to name but a few.\n\nJulia Davis as Dawn Sutcliffe: Then\n\nJulia started out in a comedy double-act, later expanding to a troupe which also featured future Gavin and Stacey co-stars Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon. She wrote an all-female radio comedy sketch entitled Five Squeezy Pieces in 1998, which led to roles in British telly like Big Train and I'm Alan Partridge. She reunited with Rob Brydon to co-create and co-star in Human Remains, before having a small but memorable role in Love Actually as Nancy the wedding caterer. She teamed up with Ruth once again when the latter was cast in Nighty Night, also written by and starring Julia.\n\nJulia Davis: Now\n\nPost-Dawn, Julia was in a TV film adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion, as well as an episode of Black Mirror. She performed in the Hollywood film Phantom Thread alongside Daniel Day-Lewis, as well as Fighting with My Family, Sing 2 and Run Rabbit Run. She also co-created and co-starred in Hunderby, Camping and Sally4Ever, as well as small roles in Stath Lets Flats, A Very British Scandal and The Outlaws.\n\nAdrian Scarborough as Pete Sutcliffe: Then\n\nAdrian started his career off with a stint in The Bill, also voicing Mr. Benjamin Bunny in the beloved TV adaptation of Beatrix Potter's The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. Appearing on the big screen almost immediately, he starred in The Madness of King George as well as Gosford Park, Dirty Pretty Things, The History Boys (alongside future Gav and Stace co-star James Corden) and Notes on a Scandal. On the telly, he was in Coogan's Run, Let Them Eat Cake, Heartbeat, Midsomer Murders and New Tricks, among others.\n\nAdrian Scarborough: Now\n\nSince his turn as Peter Sutcliffe (NOT the Yorkshire Ripper), Adrian has seriously been building up his acting CV. He's had roles in films such as The Kings Speech, Les Misérables, Christopher Robin, 1917 and Artemis Fowl, plus telly stints in Psychoville, Upstairs Downstairs, Doctor Who, Plebs, Death in Paradise, Miranda, Father Brown, Call the Midwife, Stella, Little Women, A Very English Scandal, Killing Eve, The Accident, Sanditon and Inside No. 9 among others!\n\nSheridan Smith as Ruth 'Rudi' Smith: Then\n\nHaving performed through childhood, Sheridan had already appeared in classic British telly series prior to joining the Gavin and Stacey cast. She had a small but significant role in The Royle Family as Emma, son Antony's girlfriend. She then got her breakthrough starring as Janet in Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, before appearing in two episodes of Fat Friends alongside future Gav and Stace co-stars James Corden, Ruth Jones and Alison Steadman. She was also in Love Soup, Grownups and Lark Rise to Candleford.\n\nSheridan Smith: Now\n\nSheridan has been a regular face on TV following on from her role as Rudi, as well as plenty of theatre shows too. We've seen her on Benidorm, Jonathan Creek, The Widower, portraying Cilla Black in Cilla, Cleaning Up, Four Lives, No Return and The Castaways. She's also set to star in upcoming crime drama I Fought The Law. On the stage, she's performed in Into the Woods, Little Shop of Horrors, Legally Blonde, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Funny Girl, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Shirley Valentine. She's even released two albums as a solo singer - 'Sheridan' (2017) and 'A Northern Soul' (2018).\n\nRobert Wilfort as Jason West: Then\n\nStacey's brother Jason is played by Robert Wilfort, who had already appeared in a handful of TV series and films by the time of his casting in the show in 2007. He had roles in Murder Most Horrid, The Blonde Bombshell, Holby City, The Bill, Coronation Street and Pulling on the small screen, as well as All or Nothing, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, The Libertine and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."
