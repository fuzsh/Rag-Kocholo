        "text": "Gareth Jones left Cambridge University in 1929, having gained a First-Class Honours in French, Russian and German to join Mr. David Lloyd George, former Prime Minister to Great Britain (1916-1922). He commenced his new employment as a Foreign Affairs Advisor on January 1st, 1930.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1933, Gareth visited the Soviet Union on three occasions and after each, he wrote articles for a number of newspapers regarding conditions he observed resulting from Stalin's Five-Year Plan.\n\nOn the first occasion in 1930, Gareth reported back to Lloyd George at his country retreat in Churt, Surrey . There he met Lord Lothian, a former wartime secretary to Lloyd George (and later the British Ambassador to the U.S. ), who recommended that Gareth should publish his articles in The Times.\n\nHis second independent visit to ' Russia ' in 1931 (as the USSR was widely known at the time in the West) occurred after being head-hunted for his Soviet expertise by the leading American public relations expert, Dr Ivy Lee. It was at Lee's request that Gareth accompanied a young Jack Heinz II (heir to the food manufacturing empire) to Russia and Ukraine , whereby sleeping on the 'bug-infested floors' of Soviet peasantry, they personally experienced the onset of starvation in Ukraine . Heinz took Gareth's copious diary notes and in early 1932 anonymously published (though containing a foreword under Gareth's name) a damning appraisal of 'starving' peasant life in the USSR . Due to the Great Depression, Gareth's one year contract with Lee was terminated and he returned from New York in mid-1932 to rejoin David Lloyd George's employ.\n\nIn October 1932, there were increasing rumours within informed London circles and other circumstantial evidence which Gareth had gleamed from recently acquired copies of Izvestia of an on-going famine. As a result he wrote two newspaper articles in a series entitled \"Will there be soup?\" to highlight the forthcoming winter crisis, before arranging his affairs so as to observe it for himself at his earliest opportunity in the following March..\n\nEarly in 1933, Gareth made an extensive tour of Europe . In February one month after Adolf Hitler had been made Chancellor of Germany (and just 3 days before the burning of the Reichstag), Gareth was afforded the 'privilege' to become the first foreign journalist to fly with the newly elected dictator to a rally in Frankfurt-am-Main.\n\nThe following month in early March 1933, after an 'off-limits' walking tour of the Soviet Ukraine, Gareth, a young man of just 27 years, exposed to the world the terrible famine-genocide that had befallen the Soviet Union and gave reasons for this tragic state of events. It was in the same week that Malcolm Muggeridge had three unsigned famine articles in the Manchester Guardian published, though at the time, due to the more reported Jewish problems in Germany , they went almost unnoticed. Gareth's story however, broke world-wide with much credence (by virtue of his position with Lloyd George) from a Berlin press interview on the 29th March 1933, and was published in the USA as 'exclusives' on the same day by Pulitzer prize winners; H. R Knickerbocker (1931) and Edgar Adsel Mowrer (1933)..\n\nEven though Gareth revealed the truth, he was publicly denounced as a liar by several Moscow resident Western journalists, including The New York Times' and incumbent 1932 Pulitzer Prize Winner, Walter Duranty. In 1937, Eugene Lyons, a Moscow based correspondent, who repudiated Gareth four years earlier, was apologetic for his actions in his book Assignment in Utopia:\n\n\"Throwing down Jones was as unpleasant a chore as fell to any of us in years of juggling facts to please dictatorial regimesbut throw him down we did, unanimously and in almost identical formulas of equivocation. Poor Gareth Jones must have been the most surprised human being alive when the facts he so painstakingly garnered from our mouths were snowed under by our denials.\"\n\nUndaunted, in a published letter to the New York Times, Gareth reasserted his observations of famine and also stingingly rebutted Duranty describing Moscow-based foreign correspondents as being \"masters of euphemism\".\n\nThis was to be Gareth's final visit to the USSR , no doubt personally countenanced by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Maxim Litvinov, with whom he had a private audience just before leaving Moscow . It is now known that Gareth's diary notes of the meeting note the single word \"prevarication\" to simply comment upon Litvinov's flat denial of a famine actually raging in the villages.\n\nThe consequences of Gareth's unilateral actions, were evinced in 1934, in a letter to a friend of his where Gareth wrote:\n\nAlas! You will be very amused to hear that the inoffensive little 'Joneski' has achieved the dignity of being a marked man on the black list of the O.G.P.U. and is barred from entering the Soviet Union . I hear that there is a long list of crimes which I have committed under my name in the secret police file in Moscow and funnily enough espionage is said to be among them As a matter of fact Litvinoff sent a special cable from Moscow to the Soviet Embassy in London to tell them to make the strongest of complaints to Mr. Lloyd George about me.\n\nFollowing a forced year in the political reporting wilderness; having been virtually ostracised by all his former political and newspaper contacts within the British 'Establishment', including his former employer Lloyd George, Gareth found a job as a local reporter for the Cardiff Western Mail, covering stories about rural Welsh arts & crafts.\n\nFortune often favours the brave and in June 1934 during the course of his local Welsh reporting, Gareth interviewed Randolph Hearst, the world's leading press baron, who happened to own a castle outside Cardiff called St. Donat's, which he used as his British base. Hearst was in the process of removing his support for the Bolsheviks in his fears that F.D. Roosevelt's 'New Deal' was too left wing and knowing of Gareth's previous Soviet reporting, wanted to meet him again so as to spearhead Hearst's then forthcoming anti-Red campaign of 1935.\n\nIn December 1934, Gareth travelled across the USA and delivered a key note speech at The Institute of World Affairs in which it would not have gone unnoticed in Moscow that he he accused them of;  The exile of five million Kulaks was one of the most brutal crimes in European history.' On the New Years Day, 1935, Gareth met Randolph Hearst for lunch on the terraces of his palatial estate of St. Simeon in California, Gareth was personally commissioned to repeat his 1933 famine observations in three very heart-rending and most vitriolic anti-Stalin articles for the Hearst stable of US papers - in which he also correctly recognised that Kirov's recent murder in the USSR was probably committed by Communists themselves and as a result, a new wave of Stalinist terror ensued, now known as the beginning of the Stalinist Purges.\n\nInstead of again trying to publicly deride Gareth's articles, a month later, and conveniently for the Soviets, whether by accident or more probably by design, Hearst was 'furnished' with a series of fraudulent articles and bogus famine photo claiming an on-going Ukrainian famine in 1934, by one 'Thomas Walker,' a then unknown, convicted-conman who had absconded from Colorado prison. Walker, whose real name was Robert Green, was easily exposed as a complete charlatan by Louis Fischer (armed with evidence that Green had only spent 5 days in the USSR in 1934, and therefore could not visited Ukraine - information readily supplied to him by the Soviet authorities). Without ever-mentioning Gareth's name, Fischer was thus able to destroy the credibility of all of Hearst's reporting of any Soviet famine.\n\nGareth would have been completely unaware of Fischer's 13th March 1935 letter (entitled 'Hearst's Russian 'Famine'') in the US weekly, The Nation exposing Thomas Walker's fake reporting, otherwise one would have expected him to contribute to the debate in the US, especially as he had spearheaded Hearst's first series of anti-Soviet articles in 1935 . The precise timing of Fischer's article coincided with the exact start of a period when Gareth became effectively incommunicado whilst 'back-packing' around South East Asia in Search of News. Prior to this journey and whilst residing in Japan , Gareth had been provided with free accommodation by a fellow journalist Günter Stein, who himself had just arrived in Tokyo from London . However, unbeknown to Gareth, Stein was actually an alleged Soviet spy, loosely but not exclusively associated with the famous Richard Sorge spy ring. One might perhaps wonder whether Stein not only reported Gareth's immediate itinerary to his spy masters in Moscow, but if it possibly resulted in the 'go-ahead' for Fischer's 4th March dated letter to be 'safely 'published (just two days after Gareth left Stein's apartment on 11th March)?\n\nWhat is not up for conjecture is that Gareth's Far Eastern movements were being closely monitored by the Soviets. Within five months, he had been kidnapped by 'Japanese-controlled' Chinese bandits and two weeks afterwards was suspiciously murdered in Inner Mongolia . His last mode of transport and from which he was kidnapped was 'kindly' provided gratis by a German company called Wostwag - now known to have been a trading front of the OGPU / NKVD... [He was kidnapped along with the German journalist, Dr. Herbert Mueller, who had invited him on the trip to Inner Mongolia . Mueller was 'unusually' released, unharmed after two days in captivity - British Intelligence records at the Public Records Office now reveal that they had a secret dossier on Mueller for 34 years citing him as; a known Communist, a representative of the Third International (Comintern) in China, at one time lived in the Soviet Consulate in Hankow, under the alias of 'Gordon' and also ran a covert Soviet courier business within China.]\n\nWith his murder under mysterious circumstances, Gareth Jones had effectively been silenced; the only reliable independent witness to arguably Stalin's greatest atrocity had been conveniently liquidated and both the Holodomor and Gareth's truthful reporting were effectively airbrushed out of history for more than half a century. [Though one man however did not forget Gareth, and this man was George Orwell, who clearly alluded to Gareth in his own famine chapter in 'Animal Farm' CLICK HERE for details.]\n\nIn November 2009, Gareth's old alma mater of Trinity College Cambridge eventually recognised the true historical importance of Gareth's journalist diary notes of his observation of famine conditions in Ukraine in 1933, when they prestigiously exhibited his pocket diaries at the Wren Library and side-by-side with fellow alumni, Sir Isaac Newton's personally annotated copy of his fundamental 'laws of motion' masterpiece, 'Principia'. 180 newspapers worldwide covered the story (bar the New York Times!), finally vindicating that Gareth's pen was indeed mightier than the Soviet sword...

It portrays Gareth's first-hand observations of the great food shortages caused by the policy of Collectivisation. From an historical point of view, even in 1931, there are seven references in this book to the word 'starve' or starving'.\n\nClick on the right for either the PDF Version (356kb) or here for whole books as an HTML Version (512kb). - Alternatively in individual and smaller 100kb HTML file click HERE\n\n[Click on the above picture for a 421kb picture, which evidences Gareth's own September 1931 diary entries (twenty-ninth day) which can then be directly cross-referenced to Jack Heinz II's 'Experiences in Russia in 1931 - A Diary'. On this page one can read first-hand evidence of an impending famine: \"It is terrible in the Kolhoz, he whispered. They took my cows and my horse. We are starving. Look what they give us - nothing! nothing! How can we live with nothing in our dvor? And we cant say anything or theyll send us away as they did the others. All are weeping in the villages today, little brother.]\n\n3) In September / October 1932, Gareth was Fully Aware of a Soviet Famine.\n\nOn September 14th, 1932, Gareth wrote to his former employer, Ivy Lee; \"The harvest is a failure and there will probably be great starvation for millions this winter. There is at the present moment a famine in the Ukraine.\" [CLICK HERE to see an image & full transcription of this letter]\n\nIn October 1932, there were increasing rumours within informed London circles and other circumstantial evidence which Gareth had gleamed from recent Soviet Press of an impending famine crisis about to befall the Soviet Union. This news prompted Gareth to return to the Soviet Union, at his earliest opportunity in Spring 1933 at the end of his spell of employment with Lloyd George.\n\nGareth had several conversations on the famine, with some of the most knowledgeable sources in London at the time, including Prof. Jules Menken (London School of Economics) who: \"dreaded this winter, when he thought millions would die of hunger\" (from a letter to Gareth's parents; 13th October 1932). (*CLICK HERE* for a relevant exert from Siriol Colley's Biography of Gareth. \"More Than a Grain of Truth\" )\n\nDuring the previous August in 1931, Gareth and Jack Heinz II, had already seen first-hand 'starving-peasants' and listened to their tales of malnutrition and the failures of Collectivisation (See Jack Heinz's 'Diary' above for evidence). Gareth decided to incorporate these diary observations along with recently received reports from Izvestia into two newspaper articles, in an attempt to publicise his fears of an inevitable famine.\n\nThis series of articles was entitled: \"Will There be Soup?\" and were published by The Western Mail, Cardiff, Wales, on the 15th & 17th October 1932:\n\nRussia Dreads the Coming Winter. 15 October 1932.\n\nRussia Famished Under the Five-Year Plan. 17 October 1932.\n\nIn comparison, Walter Duranty wrote an article entitled: \"The Crisis in the Socialisation of Agriculture\" from: Moscow, on November 24, 1932, in which he admitted that the: \"...Five-Year Plan, has run against an unexpected obstacle the great and growing food shortage in town and country alike.\" But within the same article also stated: \" There is no famine or actual starvation, nor is there likely to be.\"\n\n4) Gareths final visit to the Soviet Union in March 1933, exposing the Holodomor (Soviet Ukrainian Famine-Genocide).\n\nExcerpt revealing Famine Conditions from Gareth's Diary for 21st March 1933\n\nClick on the above picture for more legible detail & transcript..\n\nThe following articles, all stem from Gareth's Berlin Press Conference on 29th March, exposing his discovery of widespread famine within the Soviet Union...\n\nNew York Evening Post.

He resigned after editorial constraints imposed by Goebbels, and in 1938 was ludicrously cited in evidence of defendant, Chernov, in the third Bukharin Soviet Show Trial as being a German Spy master orchestrating sabotage of Soviet grain in the 1930s. He emigrated to the USA and unfortunately as a direct result of these allegations was interned after Pearl Harbor.

[This French article covers the Soviet financial situation according to Gareth's previous reports.]\n\n5) Gareths final three & extremely vitriolic anti-Stalinist 1935 articles - personally commissioned and syndicated across the USA by William Randolph Hearst.\n\nBefore meeting Hearst on New Year's Day 1935 at his palatial Californian ranch of St Simeon at which Gareth was a house guest, Gareth was invited to be the prestigious guest speaker at the 12th annual meeting of the Institute of World Affairs on the 15th December 1934. Here, he blamed the 5-Year plan of Collectivisation as 'a harbinger of famine' and that 'exile of five million Kulaks was one of the most brutal crimes in European history.' CLICK HERE to read a newspaper report of his conference address.\n\nBelow are transcripts of Gareth's January 1935 articles for Hearst:\n\n**** Russias Starvation- What Lies Behind Wave of Official Murders, That Followed the Assignation of Kirov, Grim Hunger of Peasants Witnessed By Former Foreign Adviser To Lloyd George - New York American / Los Angeles Examiner - 12 January 1935.\n\n**** THERE IS NO BREAD - Gareth Jones Hears Cry of Hunger All Over Ukraine, Once Russias Sea of Grain - And Then a Second Phrase Occurs: We Are Swollen, Victims of Famine Complain. Sunday American / Los Angeles Examiner 13th January 1935. N.B. In this article Gareth uses the phrase 'Man-made famine'...\n\n**** REDS LET PEASANTS STARVE -Famine Found Even in Large City in Ukraine. New York American / Los Angeles Examiner - 14 January 1935.\n\nN.B. In the second article Gareth becomes probably the first journalist to coin the now much used phrase \"man-made famine\" (though an American sub-editor, used the term 'famine man-made' in one of his 1933 articles.\n\nThese damning and heart-rending articles were never challenged or countered by the Soviets; unusually their Stalinist apologists like Walter Duranty and Louis Fischer remained silent and not even the 'Friends of the Soviet Union' penned a letter of complaint.\n\nInstead within a month of Gareth's articles, a bogus correspondent \"Thomas Walker\", who turned out to be an escaped convict, whose 'real 'name was Robert Green had conned Hearst to run a series of five articles chronicling his alleged foray into Ukraine in 1934, where he had even been been able to take photos of the 'on-going' famine. These articles were shown up to be a complete fraud by Louis Fischer of 'The Nation', who was conveniently supplied by the Soviet authorities with his exact USSR entry and exit dates (which 'proved' Walker had no the time to have visited Ukraine) plus the fact Fischer 'knew' the providence of 'Walker's' supposed photo's were clearly fake (for example, scenes depicted in the articles were from both winter and summer and could not have been taken on a single visit).\n\nIn a swoop, Fischer was able to cast a slur upon all Hearst's and the conservative press' reporting of all Soviet famines, past and present and without every mentioning Gareth by name cast aspersions on his honest reporting... Within seven months Gareth had been kidnapped by bandits in China - the vehicle he was kidnapped from belonged to the NKVD - the only reliable witness to the Holodomor had been liquidated and effectively silenced, and like the famine itself disappeared into obscurity...-\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION TO GARETH'S FAMINE EXPOSURE ARTICLES\n\nThe articles and letters below, provide further information relating to Gareth's exposure of the 1933 famine, including independent confirmation of Gareth's reporting, correspondence to Lloyd George, and to Gareth from Malcolm Muggeridge, Muggeridge's three well-known March reports, plus his January 13th 1933 article, an October Manchester Guardian article by William Henry Chamberlin (retracting their own earlier famine reports), a 1988 US Congress Commission report on the Famine discussing the role of journalists, Eugene Lyons' chapter from 'Assignment in Moscow' on the famine, and a 1958 Ukrainian Review commemorating the 25th anniversary of the famine.\n\nIn 2005, I have added Duranty's Pulitzer prize winning 1931 articles, speeches from the Donetsk James Mace Memorial Panel, two discussions on Orwell and the famine and finally, Otto Schiller's three unsigned August 1933 Daily Telegraph articles.\n\nThe Manchester Guardian.

The main news at the time on the same inside pages were, for example: \"Terror in Germany - Examples of Nazi Brutality\" (3/7 of a single page) and also reporting of the forth-coming Metropolitan-Vickers 'show trial', plus Japan's formal exit from the League of Nations. Muggeridge's articles commanded just a single column (of 7 per page ) over two pages on all three days of publication.]\n\nThe Manchester Guardian. March 2nd, May 8th & 9th, 1933.
