        "text": "The role played by David Lloyd George in the creation of the Royal Air Force has been celebrated at his home town in Gwynedd.\n\nThe event at the Lloyd George Museum in Llanystumdwy marks 100 years since the then-prime minister created the first independent air force in 1918.\n\nThere was a flypast of RAF aircraft and exhibitions, while a memorial book and garden were also opened.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said he deserved to be recognised.\n\nThe Caernarvon Boroughs MP, who went on to become the only Welsh prime minister and led the country through the latter part of World War One, was one of the first British politicians to take air power seriously.\n\nAs early as 1909, he warned Britain was in danger of being left behind by the new technology, but it was later in 1917 that he saw air power as a way to end slaughter in the trenches.\n\nLloyd George's grandson, David Lloyd Carey-Evans, said it was \"very pleasing\" his grandfather's role was being celebrated.\n\n\"The Army had been insistent that the new air corps be under its command but my grandfather felt very strongly that this was not the way forward for such a dynamic new strike force and was determined that it should be independent and be allowed to develop itself rather than be directed by the army,\" he added.\n\nAir Officer Wales, Air Commodore Adrian Williams, said he hoped the opening of the RAF Centenary Memorial Garden at the site - and its donation of records relating to Lloyd George's role in creating the RAF - would be a \"great legacy for the museum and ensure that people in the years ahead know this important story\".\n\nNew Wales Office minister Stuart Andrew MP said the RAF was recognised as one of the greatest military forces in the world and the year of centenary planned events ahead would celebrate its strong links with Wales."
