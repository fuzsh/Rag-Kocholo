        "text": "One was a Fascist, and the other was a Liberal. Unsurprisingly, it led to radically different opinions on the future of England. In early 1933, Sir Oswald Mosley, who had recently founded the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in October, 1932, and Miss Megan Lloyd George, a Liberal MP, were given the opportunity to go on BBC radio head-to-head and debate the question of whether the country needed fascism.\n\nBy 1933, many households in Britain had purchased or had access to early ‘wireless’ radio sets and could enjoy a combination of music, live concerts, cultural and ‘educational’ coverage, dramas and news bulletins from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).\n\nAlthough very cautious in its coverage of politics, the state-funded corporation was still keen to convey its independence and allow a degree of political debate and discussion as part of its services to the nation, as long as it was ‘balanced’ debate. Many of these debates and discussions were also reproduced in the BBC’s printed journal The Listener.\n\nIn early 1933, much of the general public were very familiar with the creed of liberalism and the official Liberal Party, one of the two oldest parties in the country. There was less familiarity with the new creed of Fascism, which many people still saw as a ‘foreign’ and rather exotic creed, not appropriate for the traditional constituional patterns and stability of a liberal parliamentary democracy. BBC executives were keen to enable a range of voices and opinions to be heard on their radio services, and saw Sir Oswald Mosley as somebody who was articulate and a good debater. Fascism, although a new arrival on the political scene in Britain, was still viewed as just another ‘ideology’ which could sit alongside the more established ideologies on offer to electors. Moreover, Fascism had not yet gained the controversial and violent reputation it would assume in this country within just months of the broadcast.\n\nFor the BBC, it made perfect sense to have two strong personalities debating a big issue of the day in an atmosphere of polite studio reasonableness.\n\nThe Duelling Duo\n\nMosley (1896-1980), of course, had started his political career as a Conservative, then became an Independent, had briefly flirted with the Liberals, and then had sensationally joined the Labour Party. Seen as a rising young star in British politics in the 1920s, Mosley could count David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, among others, as friends and saw himself as very much on the Left – a ‘Keynesian’ and advocate of public spending schemes to cushion the inevitable ‘slumps’ of capitalism.\n\nMosley had served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Labour Government of 1929-31, with special responsibility for trying to cure unemployment. He had high hopes that he would be able to persuade the Cabinet that the way to address the Slump was to have an ambitious programme of public works and State intervention.\n\nBut, in 1931, Mosley – disillusioned with what he saw as the orthodox caution and lack of ambition on the part of Labour, had resigned and formed his own short-lived ‘New Party’. When this failed, Mosley had moved right and embraced Fascism.\n\nMiss Megan Lloyd George (1902-1966), later Lady Lloyd George, was the youngest child of David Lloyd George and was the first female Member of Parilament for a Welsh constituency, having won Anglesey for the Liberals in 1929.\n\nShe also served as the Deputy Leader of the Liberals and later, in 1955, defected to the Labour Party. Like her father, she had a love of debate and was admired for her rhetorical skills and devotion to political campaigning. In fact, just as her father had clear charisma and a notably loyal personal following, Megan Lloyd George also seemed able to win people over through the sheer power of her personality and ability to score points in the heat of the moment. Ironically, this was also something she had in common with Sir Oswald Mosley, who was also well-known, and indeed notorious, for his ability to make barn-storming speeches and to stir up the passions and devotion of his supporters.\n\nFascism or Liberalism?\n\nIn the BBC broadcast, which took place on 15th March, 1933, the question given to the two strong-minded politicians was ‘Does England need Fascism?’, and it was soon evident that this was a topic that was bound to lead to very divergent views and opinions from the pair.\n\nMosley (pictured), making his case for Fascism, emphasised that, in his estimation, Fascism was ‘the new creed of the twentieth century’, something that could, he claimed, break the ‘trade depression’ and ‘old trade cycle’ associated with ‘the old parties’. Ramping up the dramatic tone of his contribution in characteristic fashion, in Mosley’s reading of things ‘an epoch of civilisation’ had come to an end and ‘we are witnessing the birthpangs of a new civilisation’. The BUF leader argued that ‘action – and drastic action – is necessary’, action before it was too late.\n\nFascism, he said, was ‘a new subject’ to British audiences, but was needed because of ‘the crisis which is inevitable in the modern age’. Fascism he claimed, was the ‘only salvation’ and had ‘saved other nations from disaster’. He continued: ‘Please do not think on that account that we are trying to import something foreign to Britain. We have developed a Fascism which is British, and is suited to the British character’. Fascism, he told the BBC’s listeners, was ‘a national creed which finds a practical expression in each country in turn’. Fascism came to each country, he claimed, ‘as the hour of crisis approaches’. It was the ‘universal creed’ of the twentieth century, which could now be found in ‘all great countries’.\n\nSeeking to reassure the BBC’s audience, Mosley added: ‘But we Fascists in Britain are determined to build in our own country the greatest and most constructive Fascist movement in the world’. It would not lead to dictatorship. He argued: ‘We ardently desire to achieve all our aims peacefully, by legal and constitutional means’. To this end, Parliament, with the ‘consent of the nation’, would be transformed ‘to effective purposes’, with a General Powers Bill giving a Fascist Government ‘the power to act’. In answer to claims that this would be the end of liberty, Mosley alleged that this would, in fact, be the ‘beginning of liberty’. Real liberty was, in his estimation, ‘economic liberty’ – a steady job, a decent house, unmolested private happiness, and so on. In his view, ‘you cannot have real liberty until you get rid of the nineteenth century humbug which is now called liberty’.\n\nAfter going into further detail about fascism’s economic proposals, Mosley ended his contribution to the radio debate by claiming that the creation of a Fascist ‘Corporate State’ in the country would lead to the ending of class barriers, and the energies of every citizen would be devoted to ‘the service of the British nation’, raising it to its ‘highest destiny – the Greater Britain of Fascism’.\n\nThe case against Fascism was then given by Megan Lloyd George (pictured). In contrast to Mosley’s rather ‘idealistic’ tone, she appeared to adopt a more down-to-earth approach.\n\nShe said that she was hearing for the first time of British Fascism from its leader and, like many listeners, was expecting to hear about ‘a constructive policy to meet the needs of the hour’. But, she noted, while Mosley had recommended Fascism as it had saved other nations from the post-War crisis, yet, ‘in same breath almost’, he had argued that it was not the Fascism that he would have us have in Britain: ‘What is it then? There is the Fascism of Mussolini who has in practice done away with representative institutions’. Was it to be this, or perhaps the Fascism of Hitler, who had silenced all free speech and all legitimate opposition?\n\nWarming to her theme, Megan Lloyd George emphasised that, in her view, Fascism was ‘essentially autocratic – an autocracy of one man or a junta‘. She said that, despite Mosley’s assurances, she found it difficult to see where his creed differed from the methods which other countries had adopted in times of emergency. Then, turning to the economic context, Megan Lloyd George went into considerable and quite damning detail on Mosley’s economic policy and his proposals for a ‘Corporate State’. She doubted that putting up economic barriers and high Protection would lead to the return of prosperity, and argued that all this would lead to ‘unprecedented budgetary troubles’.\n\nAll in all, Megan Lloyd George said she was afraid that there were ‘many rungs’ missing from Mosley’s ‘Fascist ladder’ and his creed had ‘no practical well thought-out policy of action’ to meet the urgent and pressing needs of the nation. Backed up by some persuasive use of figures and examples, Megan Lloyd George certainly gave BBC listeners some clear food for thought, and had probably left the audience with the impression that her points were very ‘practical’, in contrast to Mosley’s use of rather flowery and overblown language.\n\nMoreover, although it is difficult to know precisely how listeners responded to what they heard being argued by the two speakers during the broadcast, one suspects that Megan Lloyd George’s points about the ‘essentially autocratic’ nature of Fascism, and her evident doubts over how Mosley’s ‘British’ version would differ to that of Mussolini and Hitler, would have made for uncomfortable but persuasive listening for many in the BBC’s audience.\n\nDespite the fact that Mosley had already commenced very public displays of BUF marching and the holding of corner-street meetings and delivery of speeches, along with some early mass rallies, and had also contributed some statements to newspapers, he had not really been able to yet reach out to many people via non-Fascist media. The BBC debate was, therefore, undoubtedly seen by the BUF leader as a good and invaluable opportunity to make such a ‘break-through’ and get his message across to a much wider public audience.\n\nWhile Mosley hoped that further radio opportunities would come via the BBC, his hopes were dashed. Although he had gained the support of the Rothermere newspaper empire by 1934, coverage by BBC radio effectively came to end after all the controversy and deep unease that had followed the BUF’s infamous Olympia meeting of June, 1934 (which had seen public shock at the violence which had broken out at the rally). In fact, the evidence suggests that the BBC imposed an unofficial boycott on any further appearances by Mosley on the Corporation’s radio service during the 1930s.\n\nDr. Steven Woodbridge is a Lecturer in History and Politics\n\n(Images: Wikimedia Commons)"
