        "text": "An exhibition charting the life of one of Britainâs most celebrated prime ministers has opened at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. Lloyd George: The Wizard, the Goat and the Man Who Won the War runs until May next year.\n\nLloyd George, known as the Welsh Wizard, became prime minister in December 1916 at the height of World War One and is the only Welshman to have risen to the role.\n\nThe national library said the exhibition of diaries, letters, films and personal effects offered a diverse mixture of news from the political world, interlaced with personal and family information.\n\nThere will also be a chance to see footage from the National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales, including Lloyd George's visit to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in the summer of 1936."
