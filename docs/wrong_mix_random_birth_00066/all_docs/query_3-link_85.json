        "text": "The legitimacy of the honours system has again come into question, with David Cameron’s leaked resignation honours list apparently handing gongs to political friends, donors and leading supporters of the remain campaign.\n\nBut splutters of outrage over resignation honours lists, whether over allegations of cronyism or cash for honours, have a history almost as long and blotchy as the system itself.\n\nIn the 20th century, resignation honours lists were often seen as a way of paying back the wealthy for political favours, also known as “cash for peerages”. There were also regular controversies over New Year honours lists, such as when William Waldorf Astor – a US-born property and newspaper tycoon who was one of the richest men in the world and had given lavishly to British charities – became Lord Astor in 1916 and Viscount Astor the following year.\n\nThe shadows over the system have caused some to shudder away from honours. In 2010, Gordon Brown evaded a formal resignation list in the wake of the police investigation over some of the honours distributed by his predecessor, Tony Blair. Instead, the retiring Labour leader advised on a dissolution honours list. However, Keith Hill, who was standing down after 18 years in parliament and service in a variety of government roles, including junior minister and whip, firmly turned down a knighthood. He told his local paper, the Streatham Guardian: “My fundamental reason is that I have never had the least desire to have a title. I don’t want to be discourteous, but I find the whole idea a little embarrassing and too much for me.”\n\nIn 1922, David Lloyd George resigned on the day his Conservative partners in coalition voted against the arrangement. His political career had been illustrious, including serving as prime minister during the first world war, but a major scandal broke over his resignation honours list. The allegation was that he was raising funds for his party through a political fixer, Maundy Gregory, by operating a price list for peerages, ranging from £10,000 (more than £400,000 today) for a knighthood up to £40,000 for a baronetcy. The whisky millionaire Jimmy Buchanan is said to have heard rumours that more people were promised titles – and paid the money – than ever received them. He avoided any political backsliding by writing a hefty cheque – dated 2 January, the day after the list was to be announced – to “The Lloyd George political fund” and signing with his preferred title. He duly became Baron Woolavington, for being a “generous supporter of many public and charitable objects”.\n\nThe Lloyd George affair led to the passing of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act in 1925. Even so, Gregory continued to dangle the prospect of ennoblement before the gullible wealthy. He was sued by one disappointed family in 1930, and in 1933 became the only person convicted under the act so far.\n\nIn 1976, Harold Wilson’s resignation honours list was known as the “lavender list” due to a claim by the journalist and former Labour press secretary Joe Haines that it was drafted on lavender notepaper by the head of Wilson’s office, Marcia Williams (Williams and Wilson both denied this). Haines claimed to have turned down honours himself because he did not want to appear on the list. Those who did feature on it included the industrialist Joseph Kagan, who invented Gannex, a waterproof raincoat fabric that was frequently worn by Wilson and adopted by other world leaders, but was relentlessly pilloried by cartoonists. He gained a knighthood in Wilson’s first resignation list in 1970, became a life peer in 1976 – and then, as Lord Kagan, was jailed for 10 months in 1980 for misappropriating company funds. He taught many of his fellow prisoners how to play chess, and was known for his impeccable stitching in the prison workshop.\n\nTony Blair was exceptional in triggering a row well over a year before his resignation as Labour leader and prime minister. In March 2006, one of the most bitter cash-for-honours rows erupted when four of Blair’s nominations for peerages – all people who had made substantial loans to the Labour party before the 2005 general election – were rejected by the House of Lords appointments commission. Subsequently, the police interviewed 136 people, including Blair himself three times – making him the first serving prime minister to be questioned (although not under caution) as part of a criminal investigation. There were several arrests, including of Labour’s chief fundraiser, Lord Levy, who was nicknamed “Lord Cashpoint” by the tabloids. The police eventually handed a 216-page report, with 6,300 supporting documents, to the Crown Prosecution Service – which announced four months later that it had insufficient evidence to charge anyone.\n\nThe current row over Cameron’s resignation honours list is not the first in which the former prime minister has been accused of rewarding cronies. Lynton Crosby, the controversial political strategist credited with engineering the Conservative election victory in 2015, was rewarded with a knighthood in the 2015 New Year honours list. And Cameron’s barber, Raffaele Claudio Carbosiero, received an MBE in 2014 for “services to hairdressing”. Asked why he thought he had received the gong, Carbosiero said: “I’ve been in situations where people have talked about things and I’ve not blinked an eyelid. I don’t blab and I’m respected for it.”"
