        "text": "Patrick Dempsey‘s turning in scrubs for a uniform. The actor, best known for his role on “Grey’s Anatomy” has joined the cast of “Dexter: Original Sin” as a series regular. He is set to portray Aaron Spencer, the Captain of the Miami Metro Homicide who has a decades-long relationship with Christian Slater’s Harry Morgan.\n\nThe “Dexter” prequel, which began production in Miami earlier this month, also stars Patrick Gibson as Dexter Morgan, Molly Brown as Debra Morgan, James Martinez as Angel Batista, Christina Milian as Maria LaGuerta, Alex Shimizu as Vince Masuka and Reno Wilson as Bobby Watt. (David Zayas, Lauren Vélez, and C. S. Lee starred as Batista, LaGuerta, and Masuka, respectively, in the original series, while Watt is a new character.)\n\nSet in 1991, 15 years before the events of “Dexter,” the series follows Dexter as he “transitions from student to avenging serial killer,” per the official logline. “When his bloodthirsty urges can’t be ignored any longer, Dexter must learn to channel his inner darkness. With the guidance of his father, Harry (Slater), he adopts a Code designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to be eliminated from society without getting on law enforcements’ radar. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department.”\n\n“Original Sin” is produced by Showtime Studios and Counterpart Studios.\n\n“Patrick Dempsey is a beloved actor who is internationally known for the iconic characters he has played and his performances,” says Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy. “We are thrilled to have him join our all-star cast of Dexter: Original Sin, the highly anticipated origin story of the franchise.”\n\nClyde Phillips, original showrunner and executive producer, serves as showrunner and executive producer. Additional executive producers include Scott Reynolds, Michael C. Hall (who portrayed “Dexter” in the original), Mary Leah Sutton, Tony Hernandez and Lilly Burns. Robert Lloyd Lewis is producing and Michael Lehmann serves as directing executive producer.\n\nThe original series aired from 2006 to 2013. In 2021, Showtime aired “Dexter: New Blood,” which picked up 10 years after the events of the original finale."
