        "text": "Anthony has been thrilling audiences from the moment he arrived on the theatrical scene and has successfully inhabited a diversity of roles in opera and musical theatre, his versatility gaining him an honoured place on the international stage.\n\nFrom his debut with the Australian Opera in Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1980, he has left an indelible stamp on the industry both at home and abroad. Anthony’s lengthy stage credits include the London National Theatre production of Guys and Dolls, making his music theatre debut with the role of Sky Masterson in 1986, creating the role of Enjolras in the Australian production of Les Misérables (1988), and the title role of the Phantom in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Phantom of the Opera (1990 and 2007-2008). In 1995 he enjoyed a joyous season in Lucy Simon’s The Secret Garden as Archie Craven, and collaborated with her again in 2010, creating the role of Dr Yuri Zhivago in the Australian premiere production of Doctor Zhivago: The Musical. Other highlights include Australian tours of Annie (2000 and 2012), seasons with Opera Australia and a critically acclaimed performance as Tevye in Fiddler On The Roof in 2016.\n\nAnthony made his Broadway debut in 2013, portraying the iconic role of Oliver “Daddy” Warbucks in the 35th Anniversary production of Annie, directed by James Lapine. His performance won him several Broadway nominations (Drama Desk, Drama League, People’s Choice), and in 2015 he was invited to return to the US to perform the dual roles of Miguel De Cervantes/ Don Quixote in The Shakespeare Theatre Company of Washington production of Man of La Mancha. This portrayal won him the prestigious Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical. The same year he replaced Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) in the Broadway production of Finding Neverland, playing the roles of Charles Frohman/ Captain Hook.\n\nAnthony made his Carnegie Hall debut in 2013 but is no stranger to the concert platform, performing around Australia with our Symphony Orchestras. His studio recordings have spanned more than 20 years and include solo albums, cast recordings and live performances in concert and with Opera Australia. His love of “flawed anti-heroes” continued with his portrayal of Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. His performance was hailed by critics and was a welcome addition to his theatrical canon.\n\nAnthony has been honoured by the nation receiving the title of Living National Treasure, and his outstanding achievements acknowledged with his investiture as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his services to the performing arts. He is married to Amanda and divides his time and career between Australia’s capital cities and New York.\n\nZoë is thrilled to be returning to the musical theatre stage after many years in television and film projects which have made her one of Australia’s most loved actresses.\n\nZoë is perhaps best known for her role as Mel Rafter in the original cast of Packed To The Rafters (Seven Network), which garnered her a nomination for a TV Week Silver Logie for Most Popular Actress following her character’s shock death that left Australian audiences heartbroken.

Her other feature credits include Shane Abbess’ The Osiris Child: Science Fiction Volume One, Drive Hard starring John Cusack, Fatal Honeymoon with Harvey Keitel, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nA graduate of The Victorian College of the Arts (Bachelor of Dance), earlier in her career Zoë performed in several seasons for Opera Australia and toured nationally in musicals such as Grease – The Arena Spectacular, Footloose, We Will Rock You, Oh! What A Night and Eurobeat. Most recently Zoë played Mme Dindon in La Cage Aux Folles starring alongside Paul Capsis and Michael Cormick.\n\nZoë feels honoured to be playing the iconic Velma Kelly in Chicago, a role which has not only been played by some of musical theatre’s biggest stars around the world, but has always been at the top of Zoë’s wish-list of characters she would love to play.\n\nSince graduating from WAAPA in 2006, Lucy has cemented her reputation as one of Australia’s musical theatre leading ladies performing in a huge range of roles over the last 17 years.\n\nMost recently she appeared as Winifred Banks in the critically acclaimed Cameron Mackintosh/Michael Cassel Group/Disney revival of Mary Poppins.

Her album featuring arrangements and musical direction by Daniel Edmonds is available across all streaming platforms.\n\nLucy is over the moon to be starring as Roxie in Chicago, a true bucket list moment.\n\nPeter Rowsthorn is a well-loved Australian comedy icon and character actor.
