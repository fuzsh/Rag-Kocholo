        "text": "On 14 August 2000, Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam dissolved the National Assembly without explanation and called elections, four months before the end of its five-year term. After a month of campaigning free of violence, some 780,000 voters went to the polls on 11 September 2000 to choose from among 535 candidates representing 43 parties for the 62 seats at stake in Parliament (out of a total of 70 seats).\n\nDespite the large number of parties fielding candidates, pre-elections surveys predicted a vote that would ultimately be a showdown between the two main coalitions: the Labour Party (PTr)-led coalition government of Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam and an opposition alliance of the Militant Mauritian Movement (MMM), led by former Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth and the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), led by Paul Berenger, a former finance minister. Both coalitions promised, during the electoral campaign, to create 70,000 jobs and fight corruption.\n\nResults showed that the MMM and its partner, the MSM, had won 54 seats to only six for the Labour-dominated alliance. The other two seats on offshore Rodrigues Island were taken by a local party, the Organization of the People of Rodrigues (OPR).\n\nObservers of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) were for the first time present during the election and declared the poll free and fair.\n\nThe new Government, headed by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the aristocratic Hindu who has already been Prime Minister for 13 years at various times, took office on 17 September 2000."
