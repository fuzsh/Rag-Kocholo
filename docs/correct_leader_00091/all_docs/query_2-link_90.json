        "text": "PORT LUIS, June 14 -- Mauritian President Anerood Jugnauth reiterated here Thursday that his country would continue to firmly adhere to the one-China policy.\n\nMeeting a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Liu Hongcai, vice minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, Jugnauth also hoped that China would realize the peaceful reunification of the country at an early date.\n\nThe one-China policy is a basic principle that was clearly stated in the joint communique establishing diplomatic relations between the Indian Ocean island country and China in April 1972, he said.\n\nIn the past 35 years, the traditional friendly relations between Mauritius and China have been growing steadily, marked by the frequent exchanges of high-level visits, and increased economic and trade cooperation, the president added.\n\nMauritian Prime Minister Dr Navinchandra Ramgoolam also reaffirmed the one-China policy during a meeting on Thursday with Liu, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit.\n\nMauritius has always stood by the one-China policy ever since it decided to establish diplomatic ties with China in 1972, when it was under pressure from certain Western countries, said Navinchandra,who is also leader of the Mauritian Labor Party.\n\nAs good friends and partners, Navinchandra said, Mauritius and China have always supported each other in international affairs and called for peaceful resolutions to regional conflicts and disputes between countries.\n\nLiu expressed his appreciation for Mauritius's firm stand on the Taiwan question.\n\nEnditem"
