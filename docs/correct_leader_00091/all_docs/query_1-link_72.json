The island of Rodrigues, an integral part of Mauritius, is located about 560 km (350 mi) off its northeastern coast. The two islands of Agalega lie 1,122 km (697 mi) to then of Mauritius; also to then is the St. Brandon Group (Cargados Carajos Shoals). Mauritius has a total area of about 2,040 sq km (7788 sq mi), of which the island of Mauritius occupies 1,860 sq km (720 sq mi); the island of Rodrigues, 110 sq km (42.5 sq mi); and the other offshore islands, 71 sq km (27 sq mi). Comparatively, the area occupied by Mauritius is slightly less than 10.5 times the size of Washington, DC. Mauritius extends 61 km (38 mi) n–s and 47 km (29 mi) e–w, and has a coastline of 177 km (110 mi).\n\nThe nation also claims Diego Garcia, a British dependency about 1,900 km (1,200 mi) ne, and a French possession, Tromelin Island, about 555 km (345 mi) nw. The OAU has supported Mauritius's claim to Diego Garcia.\n\nThe capital city of Mauritius, Port Louis, is located on the island's northwest coast.\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nMauritius is mostly of volcanic formation and is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. A coastal plain rises sharply to a plateau 275 to 580 m (900–1,900 ft) high. Piton de la Rivière Noire, the highest peak, reaches 828 m (2,717 ft). The longest river is the Grand River South East, which stretches from the center of the country to the central eastern border with a distance of 40 km (29 mi).\n\nCLIMATE\n\nThe subtropical maritime climate is humid, with prevailing southeast winds. The temperature ranges from 18° to 30°c (64–86°f) at sea level, and from 13° to 26°c (55–79°f) at an elevation of 460 m (1,500 ft); the warmest season lasts from October to April, the coolest from June to September. From October to March, southeast trade winds bring heavy rains to the central plateau and windward slopes, which have a yearly average rainfall of over 500 cm (200 in). On the coast, rainfall averages about 100 cm (40 in) annually. Daily showers occur from April to September and occasional tropical cyclones between December and April.\n\nFLORA AND FAUNA\n\nMauritius originally was covered by dense rain forest, which included heath and mossy forest at higher elevations and coastal palm savanna. Present vegetation consists chiefly of species brought by the settlers. Mauritius is the home of two indigenous snakes, the Boleyria multicarinata and Casarea dussumieri; also indigenous to Mauritius was the now extinct dodo bird, one of many exotic animal species that thrived in isolation from predators, including man. European settlers introduced dogs, cats, rats, monkeys, wild pigs, sambur deer, and mongoose.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nThe main environmental problems facing Mauritius are water pollution, soil erosion, and preservation of its wildlife. The sources of water pollution are sewage and agricultural chemicals. The erosion of the soil occurs through deforestation.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing, Lands, and the Environment has principal responsibility in environmental matters. As of 2003, about 7.8% of the nation's total land area is protected. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the number of threatened species included 3 types of mammals, 13 species of birds, 5 types of reptiles, 7 species of fish, 27 types of mollusks, 5 species of other invertebrates, and 87 species of plants. Endangered species on the island of Mauritius include the pink pigeon, Round Island boa and keel-scaled boa, green sea turtle, and Mauritius varieties of kestrel, parakeet, and fody. Endangered species on Rodrigues include distinctive varieties of brush warbler, fody, flying fox, and day gecko. Extinct species include the Mauritian duck, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the red rail, Rodrigues little owl, and the giant day gecko.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nThe population of Mauritius in 2005 was estimated by the United Nations (UN) at 1,243,000, which placed it at number 149 in population among the 193 nations of the world. In 2005, approximately 7% of the population was over 65 years of age, with another 25% of the population under 15 years of age. There were 99 males for every 100 females in the country. According to the UN, the annual population rate of change for 2005–2010 was expected to be 0.9%, a rate the government viewed as satisfactory. The projected population for the year 2025 was 1,426,000. The population density was 609 per sq km (1,578 per sq mi).\n\nThe UN estimated that 42% of the population lived in urban areas in 2005, and that urban areas were growing at an annual rate of 1.48%. The capital city, Port Louis, had a population of 143,000 in that year. Other cities and their estimated populations were Beau Bassin/Rose Hill, 106,987; Vacoas/Phoenix, 103,564; Curepipe, 81,600; and Quatre-Bornes.\n\nMIGRATION\n\nA small number of Mauritians emigrate each year, principally to Australia, Europe, and Canada. In 2000 the number of migrants living in Mauritius was 8,000. The net migration rate was an estimated -0.41 per 1,000 population in 2005. The government views the migration levels as satisfactory.\n\nETHNIC GROUPS\n\nThe largest group on Mauritius—about 68% of the population—is Indo-Mauritian, consisting of immigrants from India and their descendants. About 27% of the islanders are Creole (mixed European and African), 3% Sino-Mauritian, and 2% Franco-Mauritian.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nEnglish and French are the official languages; however, Creole, derived from French, is the most widely spoken (by 80.5% of the population). Bojpoori is the second most common language, spoken by about 12% of the population. Only 3.4% of the population speak French. Only a small minority speak English as a first language. On Rodrigues, virtually the entire population speaks Creole. Hindi, Urdu, and Hakka are also used in some groups.\n\nRELIGIONS\n\nAccording to a 2000 census, Hindus constituted about 50% of the total population. Christians made up about 32%, with a vast majority (about 85% of all Christians) affiliated with the Roman Catholic church. Other Christian denominations include Adventist, Assemblies of God, Christian Tamil, Church of England, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Evangelical, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Most Christians live in the southern portion of the country while the north tends to be predominantly Hindu. About 16% of the population were Muslims, with a majority being Sunni. There are a small number of Buddhists.\n\nThroughout the country, there is a strong correlation between religious affiliation and ethnicity. Those of Indian descent are primarily Hindu or Muslim. Those of Chinese descent are often nominally Buddhists, but practicing Catholics, since they often admit their children to Catholic schools. Creoles and Europeans are primarily Catholic.\n\nThough there is no state religion, a parliamentary decree allows that certain religions represented before independence (Roman Catholicism, the Church of England, Presbyterianism, Seventh-Day Adventist, Hinduism and Islam) are entitled to annual payments from the government. Other religions are registered by the Registrar of Associations in order to attain legal, tax-exempt status. Though there has been some social and political tension between the Hindu majority and the Christian, Muslim, and Creole minorities, there are few reports of violence or blatant discrimination. Certain Hindu, Tamil, Christian, and Muslim holidays are recognized as national holidays. The Ministry of Arts and Culture has a responsibility to promote interreligious and intercultural relations within the country.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nMauritius had an estimated 2,254 km (1,402 mi) of roads in 2003, of which all were paved, and included 75 km (47 mi) of expressways. As of 2003, there were 39,412 commercial vehicles and 101,436 private passenger cars. In 2005, the country had eight merchant ships in service of 1,000 GRT or more for a combined capacity of 22,946 GRT. In 1999 the Port Louis harbor completed a major expansion and modernization. Also in 2004 there were six airports, only two of which had paved runways as of 2005. Air Mauritius provides about four flights weekly to Rodrigues from the main airport at Plaisance, as well as, over 40 weekly international flights. In early 2001 Air Mauritius concluded an alliance with Delta Airlines. Other major airlines serving Mauritius are Air France, British Airways, Air India, Air Zimbabwe, Lufthansa (Condor), Singapore Airlines and South African Airways. In 2003, about 1.035 million passengers were carried on scheduled domestic and international flights.\n\nHISTORY\n\nLong uninhabited, Mauritius was probably visited by Arab and Malay seamen and later by Portuguese and other European voyagers. However, significant contact did not take place until the Dutch, under Admiral Wybrandt van Warwijck, arrived in 1598. They named the island after their stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. Settlers arrived in 1638; their settlements were abandoned in 1710, however, and the French took possession in 1715, sending settlers from Réunion in 1721. The island was governed by the French East India Company until 1767, and by the French government for the next 43 years, except for a brief period of independence during the French Revolution. During the Napoleonic wars, French-held Mauritius became a major threat to British shipping in the Indian Ocean, and Britain occupied it in 1810.\n\nUnder British rule, Mauritius became a sugar-producing island. The French community secured major control of the cane fields and sugar refineries; lacking any appreciable British settlement, the island remained French in culture. Abolition of slavery in the British Empire caused an acute labor problem as the former slaves, African in origin, left the sugar fields to go into other occupations. To offset this loss, the United Kingdom, from 1835, allowed the planters to import indentured laborers from India. The system continued until 1907, with 450,000 Indians migrating to Mauritius.\n\nThe constitution of 1831 provided for a Council of Government, in which representation was largely by Europeans, although a few Creoles won nomination. The constitution of 1886 provided for a council of 27 members, including 10 elected members. The electorate was limited by property qualifications, which denied the population of Indian descent elective representation until 1926. The constitution of 1947 abolished property qualifications and extended the franchise to both sexes. Since 1948, the Indian population has dominated the elective seats. As a result of a constitutional conference held in London in September 1965, Mauritius was granted full internal self-government.\n\nMauritius became independent on 12 March 1968 and one month later became a member of the UN. Disturbances at the time of independence between Muslims and Creoles forced declaration of a state of emergency, at which time UK troops from Singapore aided in restoring order. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, chief minister in the colonial government, became the first prime minister after independence. Ramgoolam's Mauritius Labor Party (MLP) held power alone, or in coalition with others, until June 1982 when an alliance of the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) and the Mauritian Socialist Party (PSM) captured all 60 directly elected seats on the island of Mauritius. This coalition, known as the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) formed a government. MMM leader Aneerood Jugnauth became prime minister. In March 1983, however, 11 of the 19 ministers resigned, all MMM members, and new elections were called. The voting, in August of that year, produced a clear mandate for a new coalition forged by Jugnauth. The MMM-dominated coalition won another clear-cut victory in August 1987 Legislative Assembly elections.\n\nJugnauth's coalition received a mandate again in the September 1991 general elections, winning 59 of 62 directly elected seats. As promised, the MSM/MMM alliance amended the constitution, making Mauritius a republic within the Commonwealth. Since 12 March 1992, Queen Elizabeth II has been replaced by a Mauritian chief of state.\n\nIn 1993, there was trouble in the coalition when a prominent minister in the MMM met officials of the Social Democrats (PMSD). The minister was fired by Jugnauth, but the other MMM members stayed in the coalition. At times, it appeared that the ruling coalition would fray, but they managed to negotiate terms of conciliation and stood united for the 20 December 1995 elections when they took 65% of the vote, or 60 of 62 elected seats. Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam became prime minister. Cassam Uteem and Angidi Veeriah Chettiar were later elected president and vice president.\n\nTrouble in the coalition resurfaced in June 1997 when Ramgoolam fired MMM's leader, Paul Bérenger, who was vice-premier and minister of Foreign Affairs. Seven cabinet ministers belonging to MMM resigned in protest and, together with other elected MMM candidates, joined the parliamentary opposition group. This precipitated a second cabinet reshuffle since Ramgoolam took power in 1995. This left the labor party in power with only small parties aligned with it. Bérenger's place was now occupied by the vice president of the Labor Party, Kailash Purryag.\n\nThis unbalanced configuration provoked fears of a repeat of the ethnic clashes that had rocked Mauritius in 1968; however, ethnic violence did not materialize. After three days of rioting in the capital (Port Louis) and other parts of the country in February 1999, the country gradually returned to normal. Clashes between Rastafarians and police were triggered by the death in police custody of a popular reggae singer, Kaya. Three protesters were killed, a policeman died of heart failure, and over 100 were wounded in the clashes.\n\nAlthough the country had suffered corruption scandals under the previous administration of Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, Mauritius has largely avoided the corruption scourge characterizing much of Africa. After winning the September 2000 elections, the coalition government under Jugnauth and Bérenger stated that its priorities were to boost local and foreign investor confidence, and to re-launch the economy.\n\nMauritius is one of a few sub-Saharan African countries to attain the rank of middle-income status and rule by constitutional process—the country has had only three prime ministers since independence. In February 2002, two presidents—in their mostly ceremonial role—resigned in the space of a week objecting to antiterror legislation prompted by the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center. An interim president, Supreme Court Chief Justice Arianga Pillay, signed the bill into law, which was twice passed by the parliament owing to strong support from Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth. The constitution requires the president either to sign the bill into law or leave office.\n\nA ruling by the WTO following complaints of unfair trade practices lodged by Australia, Thailand, and Brazil caused Mauritius to lose its preferential access to US and European markets during 2005–07. Mauritius has enjoyed duty-free entry and trade quotas for its top two exports of sugar and textiles into the European and American markets since the 1970s. Under the Sugar Protocol, Mauritius enjoyed an annual fixed quota of over 500,000 metric tons at prices just under two-thirds of the world market price. Textiles were guaranteed duty-free entry into European Markets under the Lomé Convention with the EU, and a series of Multi-Fibre Agreements (MTA) renewed in 1977 and three other times since (the first MTA came to an end in 2005) restricted imports of low-cost textiles into Mauritius. This preferential access had attracted many investors into Mauritius.\n\nProposals by the EU reduced sugar prices in the EU by 37.5% during 2005–07. Removal of special trade status also exposes Mauritius to stiff competition from low-cost textile producers, notably China. The impending change in trade status resulted in tens of thousands of jobs lost in 2003/04 and more expected to follow in the export-processing zone (EPZ). With the comparative advantage about to evaporate, many investors were relocating to other low-cost countries. As one of the measures to revive the economy, Pravind Jugnauth, deputy prime minister and minister of finance and economic development, announced in April 2005 that Mauritius would become a duty-free island within four years, in order to attract tourists and trade and give Mauritians easier access to quality products at affordable prices. Still, economic woes precipitated by loss of preferential trade status, in particular growing unemployment, had political implications.\n\nAnalysts believe growing unemployment and a worsening economy helped to narrowly squeeze the opposition MLP-led Alliance Sociale into power in parliamentary elections that were held 3 July 2005. This alliance included five other parties: the Mauritian Party of Xavier-Luc Duval (Parti Mauricien Xavier-Luc Duval, PMXD), PMSD, The Greens (Les Verts), the Republican Movement (Mouvement Républicai, MR) and the Mauritian Militant Socialist Movement (Mouvement Militant Socialist Mauricien, MMSM). It beat the outgoing coalition composed of MSM and MMM. The Alliance Sociale coalition won 48.8% of the vote and 38 of the 62 elected seats compared to 42.6% of the vote and 22 seats won by the MSM/MMM/PMSD coalition. The turnout was 81.5%. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, the MLP leader, replaced Bérenger as the prime minister and formed a new government.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nThe Mauritian government is parliamentary, with executive power vested under the constitution in a ceremonial president and an executive prime minister, who is leader of the majority party in parliament. The president and vice president are elected by the National Assembly, to serve five-year terms. The prime minister heads a Council of Ministers, which is responsible to a unicameral Legislative Assembly. Of its maximum 70 members, 62 are elected by universal suffrage (age 18), and as many as 8 \"best losers\" are chosen from runners-up by the Electoral Supervisory Commission by a formula designed to give at least minimal representation to all ethnic groups and underrepresented parties.\n\nIn elections held 25 February 2002, Karl Offmann was elected president and Raouf Bundhun vice president. Parliamentary elections were held 11 September 2000. In September 2003 the two-time premier, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, kept his coalition and campaign promise to hand over the premiership in mid-term to the MMM leader, and stepped down, and his deputy, Paul Raymond Bérenger, became prime minister. On 7 October 2003 Sir Anerood Jugnauth was sworn in as president of the republic, after Karl Offmann stepped down a year-and-a-half after assuming power. Raouf Bundhun remained vice president. Presidential elections are scheduled for 2007. Bérenger, the first Catholic, Franco-Mauritian head of government, did not stay in power for long either. Parliamentary elections held on 3 July 2005 returned Navin Chandra Ramgoolam to office as prime minister.\n\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\n\nThe Mauritius Labor Party (MLP), headed by Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, received support during 35 continuous years in office (1947–82) from the Hindu and Creole communities and some Muslims; often sharing power in those years was the Muslim Committee of Action (MCA). The Mauritian Social Democratic Party (Parti Mauricien Social-Démocratique, PMSD) has long represented the Franco-Mauritian and Creole landowning class.\n\nA new political party, the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM), was formed in 1970. Its leaders were imprisoned in 1971 after the MMM called for a general strike to protest legislation banning strikes in industries controlled by MMM affiliates. The party leadership was later freed, and in the 1976 elections the MMM won more seats than the MLP, although not enough to achieve power. In the 1982 elections, the MMM captured 42 seats in parliament and joined the Mauritian Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste Mauricien, PSM) in a ruling coalition under Aneerood Jugnauth; unlike the MMM, which had strong Creole representation, the PSM was primarily Hindu.\n\nJugnauth's government fell apart in the early months of 1983, in the course of a power struggle within the MMM that led to the prime minister's expulsion from his own party. Jugnauth then formed the Mauritian Socialist Movement (Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien, MSM), which, in alliance with the MLP, captured 37 of 62 directly elected seats in the August balloting. The MMM won 19 seats, the PMSD 4, and a Rodrigues-based party, the Organisation du Peuple Rodriguais (OPR), 2. In August 1987 elections, the MSM, in alliance with the MLP and PMSD, won 39 of 62 directly elected seats; a three-party coalition including the MMM won 21 seats; and the OPR won 2 seats.\n\nThe legislative elections of 15 September 1991 resulted in the MSM/MMM alliance getting 59 seats (53% of the vote) and the MLP/PMSD alliance three seats (38%). By October 1993, however, the MMM had divided into two factions: one remained in the government and the other, headed by former Foreign Minister Paul Bérenger, took opposition seats in parliament.\n\nLegislative elections held in December 1995 saw a newly solidified MMM/MLP coalition win 60 seats (35 for MLP and 25 for MMM) of the 62 elected seats. The Rodrigues Movement had two seats; two seats were given to the OPR; one to the Gaetan Duval Party; and one to Hizbullah. The MMM/MLP coalition fell apart in June 1997 with the firing of Bérenger from the vice-premiership, leaving the MLP in power with small parties aligned with it.\n\nFollowing the reconfiguration of an opposition alliance comprising Anerood Jugnauth's Militant Socialist Movement and Paul Bérenger's Mauritian Militant Movement, the coalition successfully swept the 11 September 2000 elections, winning 52.3% of the vote, and holding the MLP/PMSD to 36.9%, and the OPR to 10.8%. The breakdown of seats was 54 for the MSM/MMM, 6 for the MLP/PMSD, and 2 for the OPR. Sir Anerood Jugnauth stepped down as he had promised and handed the premiership over to Paul Bérenger on 30 September 2003. Bérenger was to lose it in the 2005 elections.\n\nIn parliamentary elections held on 3 July 2005, the opposition Alliance Sociale led by the MLP, and also incorporating the PMXD, PMSD, The Greens, MR and MMSM, narrowly won the elections, garnering 48.8% of the vote and winning 38 of the 62 contested seats. The Alliance Social ousted Alliance MSM/MMM which won 42.6% of the vote and 22 parliamentary seats. The two remaining seats for Rodrigues were won by OPR, which took only 0.8% of the vote. According to the constitution, President Anerood Jugnauth allocated an additional eight seats to ethnic groups, bringing total representation to 42 Alliance Sociale, 24 MSM/MMM, and 4 OPR.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nThere are nine administrative districts and three dependencies, of which the Island of Rodrigues is one. The other dependencies are Agalega Islands and Carajos Shoals. The lowest level of local government is the village council, composed of elected as well as nominated members; above the village councils are three district councils. Commissions govern the major towns. There are also three dependencies.\n\nMunicipal council elections were held on 2 October 2005 followed by village council elections on 11 December 2005. The Alliance Sociale won all the wards in all the five municipalities, except in one of the four wards of the Town of Beau Bassin-Rose Hill, where Alliance MSM/MMM won three of the seven council positions.\n\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe statutes are based mainly on old French codes and on more recent laws with English precedents. The Supreme Court has a chief justice and six other judges who also serve on the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court of Civil Appeal, the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, and 10 district courts. Final appeal can be made to the UK Privy Council.\n\nThe president, in consultation with the prime minister, nominates the chief justice, and then with the advice of the chief justice also appoints the associate judges. The president nominates other judges on the advice of the Judicial and Legal Service Commissions.\n\nThe legal system provides fair public trials for criminal defendants. Defendants have the right to counsel, including court-appointed counsel in case of indigency.\n\nMauritius has had a good record of freedom of the press and rule of law, except for isolated incidents. These include a rough economic period and unrest in the 1970s when the government attempted to impose some restrictions, particularly on newspapers opposed to its policies, and arbitrary arrests became more frequent, but fierce opposition led to the abolition of the laws. There were also local and international concerns over government plans to put in place \"sanctions\" against private radio stations which had angered the government over coverage of an explosion in the northern city of Grand-Baie in August 2004.\n\nARMED FORCES\n\nAll defense and security duties are carried out by a 2,000 personnel paramilitary police force. The forces within this structure were an estimated 500-member Coast Guard and an estimated 1,500member Special Mobile Force. There was also an air wing with two utility helicopters. The defense budget for 2005 was $21.4 million.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\nMauritius joined the United Nations on 24 April 1968 and belongs to ECA and several nonregional specialized agencies, such as the FAO, IAEA, the World Bank, UNESCO, UNIDO, and the WHO. The nation participates in the WTO, the African Development Bank, COMESA, Commonwealth of Nations, G-77, the ACP Group, Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and African Union. In 1984, Mauritius joined Madagascar and Seychelles in establishing the Indian Ocean Commission; the Comoros and France (as the representative of Réunion) joined in 1985. Mauritius also is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). The country is part of the Nonaligned Movement.\n\nIn environmental cooperation, Mauritius is part of the Basel Convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, Ramsar, CITES, the Kyoto Protocol, the Montréal Protocol, MARPOL, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the UN Conventions on the Law of the Sea, Climate Change, and Desertification.\n\nECONOMY\n\nThe Mauritius economy, diverse and conservatively managed, is based on export-oriented manufacturing (mainly clothing), sugar, and tourism. Most of production is done by private enterprise, with the government largely limiting its role to providing institutional facilities and incentives for production. More than 250 garment factories were operating in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) of Mauritius in 2002, and more than 500 companies operate in the EPZ overall. As of 2005, services accounted for 64% of GDP, industry for 29.9%, and agriculture for 6.1%.\n\nThe economy grew at an impressive average rate of 6% in the early 1980s. However, economic growth started to decline in 1988 as the economy experienced some of the problems associated with success, including labor shortages, rising inflation, and capacity constraints. In the early 1990s, the economy showed signs of a modest recovery, with solid real growth and low unemployment. Between 1988 and 1998, the economy was estimated to have grown at an annual rate of approximately 5.3%, which is approximately where it stood in 2001. The GDP growth rate was estimated at 3.8% in 2005.\n\nImportant to Mauritius's industrial development is the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in which imported goods and raw materials are processed for export. EPZ products include textiles and clothing (80%), electrical components, and diamonds. Manufacturing in the EPZ provided nearly 45% of export earnings in 2002. Legislation gives investors in EPZ enterprises tax relief, duty exemption on most imports, unlimited repatriation of capital and profits, and cut-rate electricity. However, some of the country's larger manufacturing industries were moving their labor-intensive production to Madagascar. Preferential access to markets in Europe and the United States has been threatened by WTO regulations that do away with textile, clothes, and sugar quotas.\n\nSugarcane covers approximately 45% of the island's land area, and 90% of cultivated land. Sugarcane accounts for 25% of export earnings. Adverse weather conditions reduced the importance of sugarcane to the Mauritian economy in the late 1990s, but exports of cane brought in almost 8% of the GDP. To further enhance its competitive advantage, in 1992 the government passed legislation for the creation of a commercial free port in Port Louis. The free port provides warehousing as well as facilities for processing foods and materials for reexport to destinations around the world. The financial services sector of the economy is expanding, as is the tourism sector. Mauritius is increasing its trade with India and South Africa, largely through more than 9,000 offshore entities.\n\nINCOME\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports that in 2005 Mauritius's gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at $16.4 billion. The CIA defines GDP as the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year and computed on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than value as measured on the basis of the rate of exchange based on current dollars. The per capita GDP was estimated at $13,300. The annual growth rate of GDP was estimated at 3.8%. The average inflation rate in 2005 was 5.6%. It was estimated that agriculture accounted for 6.1% of GDP, industry 29.9%, and services 64%.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2003 remittances from citizens working abroad totaled $215 million or about $176 per capita and accounted for approximately 4.1% of GDP.\n\nThe World Bank reports that in 2003 household consumption in Mauritius totaled $3.23 billion or about $2,644 per capita based on a GDP of $5.2 billion, measured in current dollars rather than PPP. Household consumption includes expenditures of individuals, households, and nongovernmental organizations on goods and services, excluding purchases of dwellings. It was estimated that for the period 1990 to 2003 household consumption grew at an average annual rate of 4.7%. In 2001 it was estimated that approximately 21% of household consumption was spent on food, 13% on fuel, 3% on health care, and 13% on education. It was estimated that in 2001 about 10% of the population had incomes below the poverty line.\n\nLABOR\n\nMauritius's labor force in 2005 was estimated at 570,000 workers. As of 2003, about 53.6% were employed in the services sector, 37.1% by industry and 9.4% by agriculture. The estimated unemployment rate in 2005 was 10.5%.\n\nUnions have the legal right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively, and the trade union movement is active. There were over 335 labor unions in 2001, with 111,231 members, representing about 22% of the workforce. Workers are granted the right to strike, but this is severely curtailed by a mandatory cooling-off period and compulsory binding arbitration. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited and an arbitration tribunal handles complaints of such discrimination. Although the law protects collective bargaining, there are not enough safeguards in place to protect employees from discriminatory actions by employers.\n\nThe minimum working age is 15, with restrictions for those under age 18. However, child labor and exploitation is still practiced and penalties for infractions are minimal. Minimum wages are set by the government, and cost-of-living allowances are mandatory. The minimum wage ranged from $3.53 to $12.30 per week in 2002, but due to a labor shortage and contract negotiations, actual wages are about double this figure. The standard legal workweek is 45 hours.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nSugarcane is the major crop. In 2004, 5.28 million tons of cane were produced. Sugarcane occupies 34% of Mauritius's total land area and 68% of its cultivated land. It is an estate economy, with 21 large estates accounting for about 30% of the land cultivated, and 14,822 employees in 2004. Small operations account for 40% of the land cultivated and are grouped into cooperatives. In 2004, processing of sugar accounted for 16% of agricultural exports. Agriculture accounted for 6% of GDP and 19% of exports in 2004. Sugar's importance has diminished in recent years as manufacturing and tourism have grown.\n\nTea production in Mauritius has been on the decline, disadvantaged by production cost increases, labor shortages, and low world prices. The area under tea cultivation declined from 2,905 hectares (7,178 acres) in 1990 to 674 in 2004. Tobacco production was 357 tons in 2004, and now provides the raw material for most locally produced cigarettes. In recent years, horticultural products have been successfully grown for export, including flowers (mainly anthuriums), tropical fruits, and vegetables.\n\nOther crops and 2004 yields were (in thousands of tons): tea, 8.7; potatoes, 11.2; tomatoes, 14.4; bananas, 12; cucumbers, 6.9; and cabbage, 6.5. Almost any crop can be grown on Mauritius, but the shortage of land means almost all cereals must be imported, including rice, the staple food. Potatoes and other vegetables are grown in the sugar fields between rows of cane.\n\nANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nIn 2005, Mauritius had 93,000 goats, 28,000 head of cattle, 11,500 pigs, and 9.8 million chickens. That year, 4,000 tons of cow milk, 30,500 tons of meat, and 5,200 tons of hen eggs were produced.\n\nFISHING\n\nThe total catch in 2003 was 11,169 tons, a decline from 21,157 tons in 1993. In 2003, about 16% of the catch consisted of snapper. Exports of fish products were valued at nearly $75.1 million in 2003.\n\nFORESTRY\n\nAbout 8% of the total land area of Mauritius is classified as forest. Roundwood removals were an estimated 13,550 cu m (478,300 cu ft) in 2004, half of it burned as fuel. Sawn wood production was about 3,000 cu m (106,000 cu ft) in 2004.\n\nMINING\n\nThere were few mineral resources in Mauritius. In 2004, Mauritius produced 89,400 metric tons of fertilizers, an estimated 7,700 metric tons of marine salt, and 65,000 metric tons of semi-manufactured steel. Historically, mineral output consisted of the local production and use of basalt construction stone, coral sand, lime from coral, and solar-evaporated sea salt. Concerns have been raised about the impact of coral sand mining on coastal lagoons. Polymetallic nodules occurred on the ocean floor, northeast of Tromelin Island, containing iron, manganese, and cobalt. However, these minerals were abundant on land. The near-term outlook for the exploitation of minerals other than construction materials was negligible.\n\nENERGY AND POWER\n\nMauritius, as of 1 January 2005 had no proven reserves of crude oil, natural gas, coal or petroleum refining capacity. As a result it is totally dependent upon imports to meet its fossil fuel needs.\n\nIn 2004, imports and consumption of refined petroleum products averaged 27,000 barrels per day. In 2003 demand for coal came to 320,000 short tons.\n\nAs of 1 January 2003, installed electric power generating capacity totaled 0.655 million kW, of which 91.6% of capacity was dedicated to conventional thermal fuel sources in 2002, and the remainder to hydropower. Electric power production totaled 1.94 billion kWh and consumption 1.81 billion kWh. A significant portion of all primary energy consumed comes from bagasse, or sugarcane waste.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nSince 1986, Export Processing Zone (EPZ) export earnings have led those of the sugar sector. Investors are primarily from Mauritius itself and Hong Kong. The textile industry was the leading sector in the EPZ, with more than 90% of the EPZ's goods being produced for the United States and Europe; with the change in Mauritius's trade status taking effect in 2005, export earnings were under severe pressure. Other important products include chemicals, electronics, nonelectrical machinery, transportation equipment, precision engineering, skilled crafts, toys, nails, razor blades, and tires. Industry accounted for 29.9% of GDP in 2005. Mauritius is also emerging as a major business and financial center.\n\nManufacturing centers on the processing of agricultural products, sugarcane in particular. Of the 20 large sugar-producing estates 17 have their own factory. Normal production varies between 600,000 to 700,000 metric tons, but adverse weather during the late 1990s reduced these figures. Molasses and rum are among the sugar by-products produced in Mauritius. Local tobacco is made into cigarettes, and factories are maintained to process tea. Other small industries produce goods for local consumption, such as beer and soft drinks, shoes, metal products, and paints.\n\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn 1997, (the latest year for which data is available) there were 201 scientists and engineers and 126 technicians per million people that were engaged in research and development (R&D), R&D expenditures that year totaled $27.659 million or 0.29% of GDP. Of that amount, government sources accounted for 94.7%, with foreign sources accounting for the remaining 5.3%. High technology exports in 2002 totaled $29 million, or 2% of the country's manufactured exports.\n\nThe Mauritius Institute in Port Louis, founded in 1880, is a research center for the study of local fauna and flora. The Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute, founded in 1953, is located at Réduit. The University of Mauritius, founded in 1965 at Réduit, has schools of agriculture, engineering, and science. In 1987–97, science and engineering students accounted for 14% of college and university enrollments. The Regional Sugarcane Training Center for Africa, located in Réduit, is sponsored by the United Nations Development Program. The Port Louis Museum maintains collections of fauna, flora and geology of Mauritius and other islands of the Mascarene region.\n\nDOMESTIC TRADE\n\nPort Louis is the commercial center and the chief port. A wide variety of goods are distributed through the standard channels of importers, wholesalers, retailers, and supermarkets. Franchising, mainly in restaurants, has become more popular in the past few years. The nation's first McDonald's opened in 2001.\n\nThe government maintains price and markup controls on a number of consumer goods, including rice, onions, iron and steel bars, edible oils, certain appliances, pharmaceuticals, sporting goods, timber, and many others. A 1998 Consumer Protection Act extends government pricing controls to several other basic commodities, such as cheese, butter, canned and frozen meats, and sugar. There is a 15% VAT tax.\n\nThe Mauritius Freeport, a customs duty-free zone in the port and airport, turned the country into a major regional distribution, transshipment, and marketing center. This zone provides facilities for warehousing, transshipment operations and minor processing, simple assembly, and repackaging.\n\nBusiness hours are from 9 am to 4 pm, Monday–Friday, and 9 am to 12 pm on Saturday. Banks are open from 9:30 am to 2:30 pm, Monday–Friday, and 9:30 to 11:30 am on Saturday. Shops operate from 9:30 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday, and from 9 am to 12 pm on Saturday. Most business is conducted in English and French.\n\nCountryExportsImportsBalanceWorld1,862.12,389.5-527.4United Kingdom574.378.0496.3France-Monaco396.3286.0110.3United States325.362.5262.8Madagascar116.950.466.5Italy-San Marino-Holy See68.575.6-7.1Germany55.777.6-21.9Belgium34.133.90.2Netherlands30.724.06.7South Africa28.2288.7-260.5Spain23.639.8-16.2(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nFOREIGN TRADE\n\nExport revenues from the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in the early 2000s amounted to 75% of total exports; and over $1.2 billion in receipts. Over half of Mauritius's exports are comprised of clothes and textiles, while the majority of the remainder belongs to the sugar trade. With the change in trade status and new pricing structures for the EU going into effect, Mauritius's exports were likely to suffer. In 2004, Mauritius's principal export partners were: the United Kingdom (33.1%), France (20.4%), the United States (14.8%), Madagascar (5.1%), and Italy (4.1%). The principal import partners in 2004 were: South Africa (11.3%), China (9.4%), India (9.3%), France (9.2%), Bahrain (5.3%), and Japan (4.1%).\n\nBALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\nMauritius imports more than it exports, but the difference is taken care of by revenues from tourism and other services. In 2005, the value of Mauritius's exports was estimated at $1.949 billion, and imports were estimated at $2.507 billion. The current-account balance was estimated at $151 million in 2005. Mauritius had $1.605 billion in foreign exchange reserves and gold in 2005. The country held an external debt burden of $2.958 billion.\n\nBANKING AND SECURITIES\n\nThe Bank of Mauritius is the central bank. The Development Bank of Mauritius was established in March 1964 to provide loans for agricultural and industrial enterprises. There were 10 commercial banks operating in the country in 2002. Three were locally owned, including The Mauritius Commercial Bank Limited and the Sate Bank of Mauritius Limited, both of which dominated the market. The government-controlled Development Bank of Mauritius Limited provides loans to industry. The other seven banks are offshore, offering attractive tax rates, especially to US investment in India. Foreign exchange reserves at the Bank of Mauritius stood at $840 million in 1997, and were expected to reach $875 million by mid-1998. Total commercial bank assets were estimated at $3.4 billion.\n\nThe government made it clear early in the first quarter of 1997 that the Bank of Mauritius would intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to stabilize the value of the rupee. Interventions by the central bank helped the rupee to rebound after its decline against most foreign currencies, during the first nine months of 1996. In 1997, the Mauritian rupee was freely convertible.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund reports that in 2001, currency and demand deposits—an aggregate commonly known as M1—were equal to $530.5 million. In that same year, M2—an aggregate equal to M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market mutual funds—was $3.6 billion. The money market rate, the rate at which financial institutions lend to one another in the short term, was 7.25%.\n\nA market for securities or shares was not new to Mauritius when the Stock Exchange of Mauritius (SEMDEX) opened in 1989. Shares of companies had been traded in Mauritius in a market environment since the nineteenth century. The main difference between the market organized by Chambre de Courtiers de l'île Maurice and the market in its present form is the legal framework within which dealings in shares must now take place, and the regular meetings for share dealing. The stock market was opened to foreigners in 1994. In 2001, the market had 40 listed companies, and a capitalization that grew from $55 million in 1989 to $1.8 billion in 1997, but then had declined to $1.1 billion by 2001. As of 2004, a total of 41 companies were listed on the SEMDEX, with a total capitalization of $2.379 billion. In 2004, the SEMDEX rose 29.3% from the previous year to 710.8.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nThere are at least 20 insurance companies operating in Mauritius. In 2003, the value of all direct insurance premiums written totaled\n\nCurrent Account121.7 Balance on goods-277.7 Imports2,216.7 Exports1,939.0 Balance on services373.7 Balance on income-30.1 Current transfers55.8Capital Account-0.9Financial Account89.7 Direct investment abroad6.0 Direct investment in Mauritius62.6 Portfolio investment assets-27.1 Portfolio investment liabilities8.9 Financial derivatives… Other investment assets-22.8 Other investment liabilities62.0Net Errors and Omissions11.8Reserves and Related Items-222.4(…) data not available or not significant.\n\n$241 million, of which life insurance premiums accounted for $146 million. As of that same year, Mauritius's top nonlife insurer was Swan, with gross written nonlife premiums of $20.7 million. The country's leading life insurer in 2003 was BAI, which had gross written life insurance premiums of $47.7 million.\n\nPUBLIC FINANCE\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to 1981, the ratio of fiscal deficit to GDP increased from under 10% to 14%, due to deficit public spending. During the 1980s, an export-oriented economy caused the fiscal deficit to decline to 3% of GDP by 1989, and to 2% by 1991. In 1997, the deficit reached 4.6%, but the government announced measures that aimed at reducing the figure to 3.6% of GDP. The government's plan did not work; by fiscal year 2001/2002, the deficit had climbed to 6.3%. The new goal is to bring the deficit down to 3% of GDP by fiscal year 2005/2006.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) estimated that in 2005 Mauritius's central government took in revenues of approximately $1.3 billion and had expenditures of $1.7 billion. Revenues minus expenditures totaled approximately -$393 million. Public debt in 2005 amounted to 26.2% of GDP. Total external debt was $2.958 billion.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that in 2003, the most recent year for which it had data, central government revenues were r32,919 million and expenditures were r37,972 million. The value of revenues in US dollars was us$1,180 and expenditures us$1,304, based on a market exchange rate for 2003 of us$1 = r27.901 as reported by the IMF. Government outlays by function were as follows: general public services, 24.5%; defense, 0.8%; public order and safety, 7.6%; economic affairs, 11.9%; environmental protection, 4.2%; housing and community amenities, 4.5%; health, 8.4%; recreation, culture, and religion, 2.2%; education, 15.8%; and social protection, 20.1%.\n\nRevenue and Grants32,919100.0% Tax revenue26,12179.3% Social contributions1,2563.8% Grants3631.1% Other revenue5,18015.7%Expenditures37,972100.0% General public services9,30324.5% Defense2990.8% Public order and safety2,8977.6% Economic affairs4,51811.9% Environmental protection1,6024.2% Housing and community amenities1,7234.5% Health3,1778.4% Recreational, culture, and religion8352.2% Education5,99715.8% Social protection7,62120.1%(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nTAXATION\n\nAs of 30 June 2005, Mauritius had a corporate income tax rate of 25%. However, companies that are awarded Tax Incentive Certificates by the government are eligible for a reduced tax rate of 15%. Effective 1 July 1998, offshore companies incorporated on or after this date were required to pay tax at a rate of 15%. In addition, mutual funds, unit trusts, and certain other types of companies pay a reduced rate of 15%. Companies granted a Global Business License are taxed at 15% and are eligible for other tax reductions and exemptions. Mauritius has double-taxation prevention treaties with about 30 countries. Generally, capital gains are not subject to an income tax. However, capital gains resulting from the disposal of land can be subjected to a separate tax. Land development taxes can also be assessed. Dividends are tax exempt.\n\nThe progressive scale for individual income tax, ranging from 5–30%, has been replaced by a simpler split schedule of two rates on taxable income: 15% on taxable income to 25,000 Rupees (about $860), and 25% on the rest. Social Security taxes are also assessed.\n\nA general sales tax (GST) averaging 5% was imposed in 1983. As of 7 September 1998, the GST was replaced by a value-added tax (VAT) with a standard rate of 10%. On 1 July 2001, the standard rate was raised to 12%, and then, as of 7 January 2002, to 15%, where it remained as of 2005. The VAT applies to all goods and services except those specifically exempted. The exempt list includes basic foodstuffs, basic services (medical, hospital and dental), basic utilities (water and electricity), and all exported goods and service.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES\n\nMauritius maintains a list of preferred trading partners to which it gives preferential tariff rates. Taxes on imports from the preferred list are levied at 0–80%. Imports of goods from other countries, at the 55% rate or higher, are subject to an additional 10% duty. A value-added tax (VAT) of 15% is levied on all imports. Vehicles, petroleum, alcohol, cigarettes, and furniture are subject to special excise duties of up to 360%.\n\nMost imports require a license and state enterprises control the import of rice, wheat, flour, petroleum, cement, tea, tobacco, and sugar. There are few export controls, except the need for licenses to export sugar, tea, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, textiles, pharmaceuticals, gold, live animals, coral, and shells.\n\nMauritius is a member of the South African Development Community (SADC), whose objective is creation of a free trade area by 2005. The country is also a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which gives preferential rates of duty between member states.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT\n\nThe government offers a variety of investment incentives, including, for industries in the Export Processing Zone, a corporate tax exemption of at least 10 years; an exemption from import duties on capital goods and most raw materials; free repatriation of profits, dividends, and invested capital; and a waiver of income taxes on dividends for 10 years. All foreign investment must obtain approval from the prime minister's office, except in the offshore business center and the stock exchange. Businesses in Freeport receive exemption from company tax and tax on dividends, preferential rates for storage, halved port handling charges, and exemption from import duty and sales tax on finished goods and machinery. Foremost among foreign investors are those from Hong Kong, followed by French, South African, German, and Indian interests.\n\nForeign ownership of services such as accounting, law, medicine, computer services, international marketing, and management consulting was limited to 30% in 1997. Ownership of investments serving the domestic market was limited to 49%. In December 2000, the Investment Promotion Act was passed, designed to streamline the investment process.\n\nTotal foreign direct investment (FDI) was $33 million in 1996. (However, because foreign investors have not been registering with the Central Bank since the abolition of exchange controls in 1994, it is generally cautioned that official statistics underestimate the amount of foreign investment in the country. Not included is the increasingly important offshore financial sector.) In 1997, FDI inflow rose to $56 million, mainly due to investments from South Africa in the banking sector. FDI inflow fell to $12.7 million in 1998, but increased to $55 million in 1999, most investments coming from South Africa. In 2000, FDI inflow reached almost $260 million, mostly due to France Telecom's purchase of a 40% share of Mauritius Telecom as part of their strategic alliance. Most investments in Mauritius's Export Processing Zone (EPZ) have been in low-skilled manufacturing enterprises in textiles, garments, toys, and leather goods.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, some leading sectors for investment included: information and communications technology; telecommunications and broadcasting equipment and services; environment and water; pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and supplies; tourism; and financial services.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nFrance has backed training for labor, a stock exchange (which opened under the Stock Exchange Act of 1988), and irrigation projects. The EU is supporting efforts at diversifying agriculture. The Mauritius plan to become an international financial center advanced as liberalized currency rules were put into effect in 1986. In 1995, Mauritius became the 12th member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Mauritius intended to invest up to $1.5 billion in infrastructure development projects from 1997 to 2007.\n\nThe government is putting effort into information and communications technologies, in an effort to diversify the economy away from its reliance upon sugar, textiles and apparel, and tourism. The government developed a five-year Sugar Sector Strategic Plan for 2001–05, to restructure the sugar industry, including reducing the labor force and the number of sugar mills in operation. The country's export processing zone firms have sizeable investments in Madagascar's export processing zone, and have been affected by political upheavals there. Nonetheless, growth in Mauritius was strong in the mid-2000s, and social conditions were improving. A rising unemployment rate is a concern, however (the unemployment rate was estimated at 10.5% in 2005). The government has passed anti-money laundering and antiterrorism legislation. With GDP growth rates averaging 5–6% in the mid-2000s, Mauritius's economic success was reflected in more equitable income distribution, reduced infant mortality rates, increased life expectancy, and greatly-improved infrastructure.\n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nMauritius has a universal system of pensions that supplements an earnings-related pension system. The universal pension covers all residents, and is financed entirely from government sources. The universal pension pays a fixed sum according to the age of the pensioner. Employee pension benefits are determined by the number of years worked. A program of family allowances assists needy families with more than three children. Employment-related sickness and maternity benefits are provided, as well as worker's compensation and unemployment benefits, rent assistance, and a funeral grant.\n\nThe constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender. Although women do not face significant legal discrimination, most remain limited to traditional subordinate roles in the household and in the workplace. Domestic violence is pervasive and is often related to drug and alcohol abuse. The government is strengthening laws to protect women, although most stay with abusive spouses for financial and cultural reasons. The government is committed to promoting the rights of children.\n\nEthnic tensions exist between majority Hindus and minority Muslims. Human rights are generally respected, but there are reports of the mistreatment of prisoners and suspects.\n\nHEALTH\n\nAs of 2004, there were an estimated 85 physicians, 232 nurses, and 13 dentists per 100,000 people. In the same year total health care expenditure was estimated at 3.4% of GDP. In 2000, 100% of the population of Mauritius had access to safe water and 100% had adequate sanitation.\n\nThe average life expectancy in Mauritius in 2005 was 72.38 years and the infant mortality rate was 15.03 per 1,000 live births. As of 2002, the crude birth rate and overall mortality rate were estimated at 16.34 and 6.8 per 1,000 people respectively. The maternal mortality rate was 50 per 100,000 live births. As of 2000, 75% of married women (ages 15 to 49) were using contraception.\n\nAccording to World Health Organization reports, 5.3% of children 3–6 years of age were anemic. Immunization rates for children up to one year old were: diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 89%, and measles, 85%. The island of Mauritius has a high prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes. Physical inactivity and glucose intolerance through obesity are suggested culprits.\n\nThe high rates of coronary heart disease seen in Asian Indians, African-origin Creoles, and Chinese in this rapidly developing country may point to future problems in this region. Most deaths are cardiovascular-disease related.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS prevalence was 0.10 per 100 adults in 2003. As of 2004, there were approximately 700 people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. There were an estimated 100 deaths from AIDS in 2003.\n\nHOUSING\n\nThere are three basic types of houses: wattle and daub construction with thatched roofs; galvanized sheet-iron structures; and houses constructed of wood. In 2000, There were 297,671 housing units nationwide. Of these, about 65% were detached houses, 24.5% were semidetached homes or blocks of flats. About 99% of all dwellings were privately owned. Most households have three to five people. About 83.7% of all dwellings have indoor piped water, 99% have electricity, 87.8% have an indoor kitchen, and 74.8% have an indoor bathroom.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nEducation is free up to college level and is compulsory for six years. The educational system is based largely in the British school system. Primary school covers six years of study. This is followed by seven years of secondary studies (five years lower and two years upper). The academic year runs from August to May.\n\nIn 2001, about 87% of children between the ages of four and five were enrolled in some type of preschool program. Primary school enrollment in 2003 was estimated at about 97% of age-eligible students. The same year, secondary school enrollment was about 74% of age-eligible students. It is estimated that nearly all students complete their primary education. The student-to-teacher ratio for primary school was at about 25:1 in 2003; the ratio for secondary school was about 20:1. In 2000, private schools accounted for about 23.9% of primary school enrollment and 72.7% of secondary enrollment.\n\nPostsecondary institutions include the University of Mauritius; the University of Technology, Mauritius; the Mauritius College of the Air; the Mauritius Institute of Education; and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute. There are several polytechnical schools and about 30 private organizations that offer tertiary-level programs of study. Many university students study in Europe, India, Australia, and the United States. In 2003, about 15% of the tertiary age population were enrolled in some type of higher education program. The adult literacy rate for 2004 was estimated at about 84.3%, with 88.2% for men and 80.5% for women.\n\nAs of 2003, public expenditure on education was estimated at 4.7% of GDP, or 12.1% of total government expenditures.\n\nLIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS\n\nLibraries include the Mauritius Institute Public Library (75,000 volumes), the Mauritius Archives (36,000), the University of Mauritius Library (100,000), and the Port Louis City Library (110,000). The National Library, located at Port Louis and opened in 2000, has a collection of 230,000 items. The Sugar Industry Research Institute Library maintains a unique collection of 29,870 volumes on all aspects of sugarcane cultivation and manufacture. The Mahatma Gandhi Institute in Moka operates a library as well.\n\nThe Mauritius Museums Council operates the Natural History Museums (1880) in Port Louis and in Mahébourg (1950). The Folk Museum of Indian Migration is in Moka at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute. Port Louis is also home to a historical museum and a natural history museum.\n\nMEDIA\n\nAll parts of the island are linked by telegraph, telephone, and postal services. In 2003, there were an estimated 285 mainline telephones for every 1,000 people; about 13,500 people were on a waiting list for telephone service installation. Also in 2003, there were approximately 267 mobile phones in use for every 1,000 people.\n\nThe state-owned Mauritius Broadcasting Corp. provides radio and television service in French, English, Hindi, and Chinese. In 2001, the government established the Independent Broadcast Authority, which is intended to formulate regulations for private broadcast licenses. The members of the group are primarily representatives of government ministries and the chair is appointed by the prime minister. In 2004, there were three independent, privately owned radio stations in operation. There were no private television stations. In 2003, there were an estimated 379 radios and 299 television sets for every 1,000 people. The same year, there were 116.5 personal computers for every 1,000 people and 123 of every 1,000 people had access to the Internet. There were 19 secure Internet servers in the country in 2004.\n\nThere are over a dozen privately owned newspapers across the country. Leading daily newspapers (with 2002 circulations) include L'Express (35,000), Le Mauricien (35,000), The New Nation (15,000), and The Sun (unavailable), each published in Port Louis in both French and English. There are three major Chinese language newspapers.\n\nFree speech and press are constitutionally provided and said to be respected by the government.\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nThere are various commercial and scholarly organizations of the Western type, including the Mauritius Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Indian Traders' Association; the Mauritius Employers' Federation; The Mauritius Cooperative Agricultural Federation (which had 209 member societies in 1993); and the Mauritius Cooperative Union.\n\nNational youth organizations include the Young Socialists, the Mauritius Scout Association, the Mauritius Student Association for the United Nations, the Mauritius Union of Students' Councils, the Mauritius World Federalist Youth, the Mauritius Young Communist League, Junior Chamber, the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs, and YMCA/YWCA. Several sports associations are active, including those representing such sports as tae kwon do, squash, tennis, yachting, and badminton. The International Council of Hindu Youth also has a base in Mauritius.\n\nThe Institute for Consumer Protection, founded in 1983, serves as both a consumer protection agency and as an agency for the promotion of maternal and infant health. International organizations with active chapters in the country include Amnesty International, Caritas, and the Red Cross. The multinational Indian Ocean Commission, founded in 1982, is based in Mauritius.\n\nTOURISM, TRAVEL, AND RECREATION\n\nThe government has made efforts to promote upscale tourism and attract visitors from more countries. In addition to the nation's beaches, lagoons, and other scenic sites, tourist attractions include the colonial architecture of Port Louis, an extinct volcano in Curepipe, the fishing port and naval museum at Mahebourg, and the Botanical Gardens at Pamplemousses. Football (soccer) is the national sport. Badminton, volleyball, basketball, tennis, and water sports are also popular. Many of the hotels also have golf facilities.\n\nIn 2003, about 702,000 tourists visited Mauritius, of whom 28% came from France. That year there were 9,647 hotel rooms with 19,727 beds and a 63% occupancy rate. Tourist expenditure receipts totaled $946 million.\n\nVisitors must have a valid passport, onward/return ticket, hotel confirmation, and sufficient funds for the stay. All travelers are required to carry a visa except nationals from the United States and most European countries.\n\nIn 2005, the US Department of State estimated the cost of staying in Mauritius at $216.\n\nFAMOUS MAURITIANS\n\nSir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (1900–85), the first leader of independent Mauritius, was prime minister from 1968 to 1982, when Anerood Jugnauth (b.1930) succeeded him. Jugnauth served as prime minister from 1982–95, and then again from 2000–03, when he was named president. Navinchandra Ramgoolam (b.1947), was prime minister from 1995–2000, and then again beginning in 2005.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nDependencies are the Agalega Islands and the St. Brandon Group.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAllen, Richard B.

It has a total area of 1,860 square kilometers (781 square miles), and a coastline of 177 kilometers (110 miles). The Republic of Mauritius also includes the barely populated Agalega Islands and the Cargados Carajos Shoals, as well as Rodrigues (population 35,000). The capital, Port Louis, is situated on the west coast of the island, and has a population of approximately 136,000.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nThe population of Mauritius was estimated to be 1,179,368 in July 2000, with a population growth rate at 0.89 percent. The population is relatively young, with 26 percent of the population under 14 years of age, 68 percent between 15 and 64, and just 6 percent over the age of 65. The life expectancy for the population is 70.98.\n\nMauritian society is a heterogeneous one. The 2 main population groups are the ethnic Indians, who make up 68 percent of the population, and the Creoles, mixed race descendants of African slaves and colonial settlers, who comprise 27 percent. Other groups include Chinese (3 percent) and white Franco-Mauritians (2 percent). The ethnic Indians are further divided into Hindus and Muslims, with the Hindus being the majority. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of the island tend to view themselves as Mauritians first and foremost.\n\nGiven that Mauritius has such a small land surface, population growth and immigration are discouraged by the government. Population density is already very high, with 571 people per square kilometer (1,479 per square mile), compared with an average of 45 per square kilometer (117 per square mile) for the world as a whole.\n\nOVERVIEW OF ECONOMY\n\nFrom the 17th century, the Mauritian economy depended almost exclusively on sugar. Slaves were imported from Africa to work on the sugar plantations. After the abolition of slavery in the 19th century, plantations came to rely more on indentured Indian labor, whose ancestors today form the largest portion of the islands' population.\n\nBy the 1960s, Mauritius was still a monocultural economy (dependent on a single crop), and had to import many goods for local consumption. Unemployment was high, which created social tensions. In the mid-1960s, the Mauritian government began to follow a 2-pronged strategy of import substitution and export-oriented development.\n\nImport substitution was promoted through the use of high tariff barriers to protect local industry from overseas competition. To encourage the production of goods for export, Export Processing Zones (EPZs) were established in 1971, following the successful Taiwanese model. The principle behind EPZs was to import semi-finished goods duty -free, to complete the manufacturing process in the EPZs, and then to re-export these goods. Clothing and textiles were the main manufactures produced by the EPZ sector.\n\nThe EPZ sector grew rapidly since its inception and attracted large amounts of foreign investment. This allowed for the rapid industrialization of the country. Nowadays, only 25 percent of export earnings come from sugar, while 40 percent are derived from manufacturing. Over the past twenty years, the economy has consistently achieved high rates of growth, resulting in a quadrupling of GDP per capita between 1970 and 1997. According to the World Bank, the economy of Mauritius has sustained a growth rate of about 5.5 percent since independence in 1968, and the country is currently classified among middle-income earners.\n\nBesides manufacturing and sugar, the nation's other important economic sectors are tourism and financial services. With its white sands, coral reefs, and subtropical climate, Mauritius is an island paradise for tourists. Visitors come mainly from Europe and from South Africa.The hospitable nature of the Mauritian people also contributes to the island's attraction.\n\nThe island of Rodrigues has not seen the same level of development as Mauritius has—which is perhaps not so surprising when one considers that the 2 islands are 600 kilometers (373 miles) apart. Subsistence agriculture is the main economic activity on Rodrigues, with the principal crop being maize instead of sugarcane.\n\nBy the late 1990s in Mauritius, only about 5 percent of the population was living below the poverty line. However, challenges such as tariff reductions, rising wages, and limited growth prospects for the almost-saturated tourism industry have contributed to an increase in unemployment on the island, which in mid-2000 stood at 8 percent. This is rather disturbing for a country that had had full employment only a few years before.\n\nA major factor which should not be overlooked in Mauritius's success is the political climate, which is characterized by stability and ethnic tolerance. Ordinary Mauritians have also demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has resulted in a highly productive labor force .\n\nThe debt levels both in terms of GDP and exports are manageable, hence Mauritius is not considered a highly indebted country. In June 1999, external debt was around 30 percent of GDP. There is a healthy balance between local and foreign debt positions, with local debt comprising over 80 percent of total public debt and the residual being foreign.\n\nWith respect to donor assistance, the World Bank notes that, due to the country's access to capital markets, official development assistance has declined considerably since 1990 and has become increasingly selective. Although donor assistance is important to supplement private capital flows, Mauritius is not dependent on foreign aid.\n\nPOLITICS, GOVERNMENT, AND TAXATION\n\nMauritius earned its independence from Britain in 1968, which had controlled the islands since 1810, and the Mauritians have continued to follow the British model of government. Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster model, with elections being held once every 5 years. There is a 66-seat National Assembly, 62 of whose members are elected by direct popular vote, while 4 are appointed to represent minority interest. The National Assembly elects the president, who in turn selects the prime minister.\n\nAlthough Mauritius is in general a peaceful society, its politics are somewhat capricious. In spite of the small size of the country, there are a fair number of political parties. Most governments over the past twenty years have been coalitions, comprising 2 or more political parties. The major political parties are the Militant Movement of Mauritius (MMM), the Mauritian Social Democrat Party (PMSD), the Mauritian Labor Party (MLP), and the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). Voting is based to a certain extent along ethnic lines. Although there are few significant differences among the major parties, the MMM tends to be more socialist in outlook and is favored especially by the Creoles, while the MLP's support-base is mainly Indian.\n\nThe elections in September 2000 resulted in a victory for an alliance of Anerood Jugnauth's Militant Socialist Movement and Paul Bérenger's Militant Movement of Mauritius. The alliance ousted Navin Ramgoolam's Mauritian Labor Party, which had gained power in 1995. Jugnauth, in power from 1982-1995, presided over the country's transformation from dependence on sugar to a modern, diversified economy. The MSM/MMM alliance has promised to tackle corruption and mismanagement of public finances (said to be the downfall of the Labor Party), but otherwise will continue with broadly similar policies to those implemented. The voter participation rate in the 2000 elections was high, with over 80 percent of registered voters turning up at the polls.\n\nTaxation in Mauritius is relatively low, with tax revenue comprising only 17.7 percent of GDP in 1998. The highest income tax rate for individuals is 25 percent (recently reduced from 30 percent), while the corporate rate is 15 percent for manufacturing companies. Special tax incentives are available to certain kinds of companies, notably those classified as \"offshore businesses\" and those locating in the Export Processing Zone.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE, POWER, AND COMMUNICATIONS\n\nInfrastructure in Mauritius is well-developed. Roads are maintained in very good condition, with 1,834 kilometers (1,139 miles) out of a total of 1,910 kilometers (1,186 miles) of roads being paved. As of the year 2000, the road system is sufficient to hold the country's traffic volume. Less than one-tenth of the population own cars. Meanwhile, several road projects have been planned such as the extension of the roadway from Nouvelle France to Plaine Magnien, the implementation of the South Eastern Highway Project, and the construction of bypasses in areas such as Flacqs, Goodlands, and Triolet. There are no railways in Mauritius. Public transport by bus is reliable and efficient, however.\n\nThe harbor of Port Louis was provided with extra capacity in the late 1990s and has been repositioned to handle high traffic and goods volume. The country operates an efficient freeport, which handles about R9 billion worth of trade per year. In volume terms, this is estimated at around 13,000 tons. Mauritius aims to become a major transshipment center, given its location between Africa, Asia, and Australia.\n\nThere are currently 5 airports, with 2 of them having paved runways. The main airlines flying to and from Mauritius are Air Mauritius (the national carrier), British Airways, Air France, and South African Airways.\n\nThe country has a modernized telecommunications infrastructure. This will be further upgraded with the forging of a partnership with French Telecom. The latter took up a 40 percent (R6.6 billion) shareholding in the local Mauritius Telecoms in the year 2000. This public-private partnership is the first step towards a full liberalization of the industry, in accordance with standards set out by the WTO reform plan of the sector by 2004.\n\nInternet access is reasonably widespread. At present the country has only 6 Internet providers, and over 534 Internet hosts. Countrywide, Internet use is available to about 40,000 people.\n\nMauritius is a net importer of oil and petroleum. These imports are in refined form and come through the State Trading Corporation. Despite its lack of natural resources, Mauritius is adequately provided for in terms of electricity. About 25 percent of its electricity is derived\n\nCommunicationsCountryNewspapersRadiosTV Sets aCable subscribers aMobile Phones aFax Machines aPersonal Computers aInternet Hosts bInternet Users b199619971998199819981998199819991999Mauritius75368226N/A5324.587.14.5655United States2152,146847244.325678.4458.61,508.7774,100South Africa32317125N/A563.547.433.361,820Zimbabwe199330N/A4N/A9.01.1920aData are from International Telecommunication Union, World Telecommunication Development Report 1999 and are per 1,000 people.bData are from the Internet Software Consortium (http://www.isc.org) and are per 10,000 people.SOURCE: World Bank. World Development Indicators 2000.\n\nfrom hydro-electricity schemes, and the rest from a combination of diesel-powered thermal stations and burning bagasse (sugarcane residue). For its energy, the country is dependent on supplies afforded by the government parastatal called the Central Electricity Board. Electricity production in the late 1990s stood at 34 million kilowatt-hours.\n\nThe government is currently looking for substitutive methods of generating energy using woody bio-mass, ethanol from sugarcane, and solar, wind, and sea wave power. Elsewhere efforts are in progress in the development of a renewable fuel plant near Port Louis. Commercial energy is derived from electricity (10.5 percent), coal (5.4 percent) and oil-derived products (84.1 percent).\n\nECONOMIC SECTORS\n\nThe importance of agriculture in the Mauritian economy has been declining over the past 3 decades. Agriculture made up 16 percent of GDP in 1970, declining to 12 percent in 1980, and finally to 9 percent in 1998. This reflects the decreasing dependence of Mauritius on sugar. Furthermore, the share of the labor force in agriculture is much smaller now than it was twenty years ago—29 percent of males and 30 percent of females worked in the sector in 1980, while only 15 percent of males and 13 percent of females did so in 1998. The industry is plagued by excess labor demand. According to reports by the Mauritius Cooperative Agricultural Federation, the reasons are that young unemployed people are not eager to work in the fields, and the population is aging.\n\nIndustry comprised 33 percent of GDP in 1998, up from 26 percent in 1980. More significantly, 25 percent of GDP came from manufacturing in 1998, compared with 15 percent in 1980. Much of this growth can be attributed to the expansion of the Export Processing Zone sector. The percentage of the male labor force working in industry has increased significantly, from 19 percent (1980) to 39 percent (1992-97). The increase has not been so large for females, however—40 percent in 1980 to 43 percent over the period 1992-97. This may in part reflect a diversification away from the textile industry, which tends to employ more females, towards more hightech industries such as information technology.\n\nServices made up 62 percent of GDP in 1980, but declined to 58 percent in 1998. The proportion of men working in the service sector has not changed much—46 percent in 1992-97, down from 47 percent in 1980. More females are now working in the service sector, however— 45 percent in 1992-97, compared with 31 percent in 1980.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nSUGAR.\n\nSugarcane is still the dominant crop, extending over 90 percent of the cultivated land surface of the country. Twenty-five percent of export earnings come from sugar cane. Per annum sugar production amounts to approximately 630,000 tons. Due to a bad drought, this figure shrunk to 580,000 tons in 1999. As a result the agricultural sector as a whole registered a growth rate of minus 25 percent during this year. The government stepped in to help assist sugar farmers badly hit by low harvest in 1999. It provided a grant of R5,000 per hectare to farmers who experienced losses due to drought and paid a premium for sugar purchase. Mauritius is prone to recurrent cyclonic weather, which can impact the sugarcane crop, and consequently economic growth.\n\nOther sources of export revenue in the agricultural sector include tea, coffee, and tobacco. Tea production and exports decreased dramatically over the period 1995-2000, however. The production of onions, potatoes, maize, poultry, cattle, fish, pulses, bananas, and venison occurs on a small scale, largely for local consumption. Government is also supporting the development of biotechnology and hydroponics.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nMauritius's so-called \"economic miracle\" is largely due to the growth of the manufacturing sector since the inception of the EPZs. The EPZs attracted significant investment from abroad as foreign companies looked for cheaper locations for production. The reduction in unemployment experienced by Mauritius over the last 20 years can generally be attributed to the rapid growth of the EPZs.\n\nThe EPZs offer duty-free imports, lower tax rates, subsidized rates on electricity and other utilities, access to credit, favorable transport costs, and institutional support facilities.\n\nClothing and textiles still form the mainstay of Mauritian industry and dominate the EPZ sector. Mauritian clothing and textiles are competitive, both in terms of price and quality, in foreign markets such as Europe, United States, Japan, Australia, South Africa, and Scandinavian countries.\n\nGrowth in the EPZ sector has been slowing since the early 1990s, however, in terms of employment, new investment, and the number of enterprises operating in the sector. Most of the capital in the EPZs is now locally-owned, reflecting declining foreign interest. This is partly due to the fact that wages have risen as a result of full employment, and this in turn has pushed up production costs. Many Mauritian clothing and textile companies are re-locating to cheaper production locations, notably to the nearby island of Madagascar, with which it shares a common language (French) and, to some extent, culture. The focus is also shifting towards high fashion garments as competition in the global market becomes stiffer.\n\nThe Mauritian government is also trying to promote a shift towards more high-tech industries, such as electronics, software development, and light engineering. As of the late 1990s, however, Mauritius had not been able to attract the level of foreign investment into these sectors that it had been hoping for. Other industries in Mauritius include food processing (mostly sugar milling), chemicals, metal products, transport equipment, and non-electrical machinery.\n\nSERVICES\n\nTOURISM.\n\nTourism is a big foreign exchange earner for Mauritius, which has marketed itself as an \"exclusive\" destination. About 5 percent of GDP is derived from the tourism sector, and revenues currently amount to US$100 million per annum. Most visitors come from Europe— 66 percent of the market—with France and the UK providing 175,400 and 58,700 tourists, respectively. Africa's market share is 27 percent, with tourists coming mainly from South Africa and Reunion Island. About 17,111 people are employed in the tourism sector, 65 percent of these in the hotel industry. There are signs that growth in this sector is slowing: in 1999 the sector grew by just 6 percent, compared to double-digit figures prior to that.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES.\n\nOver the past few years, the financial services sector has really stepped up its role in the economy, partly due to government support of the industry. To stimulate the development of the financial sector, the government provides tax incentives for financial institutions under the Pioneer Financial Services Scheme. To date, the industry has grown by over 62 percent, and comprises 13 percent of GDP. The aim is to develop the sector as a major financial center of international repute. Currently there are eleven offshore banks , which offer merchant banking, insurance, fund management, and securities services. Non-residents are the main customers of this sector, often U.S. companies with investments in India. A tax treaty between Mauritius and India creates tax advantages to companies with investments in India that channel their funds through Mauritius.\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.\n\nIn early 2001, the government set out its National Information Technology Strategy Plan of establishing the information technology sector as a free trade zone with \"digital parks.\" These parks will consist mainly of sophisticated telecommunications and IT infrastructure as well as enabling hassle-free access to the Internet. According to this plan, it is estimated that IT-penetration will increase to 50 percent and increase PC home ownership to 40 percent by 2005. The government still has to unveil its proposed package of financial incentives that will be offered in this regard.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\nBeing a small island economy with few natural resources, trade is extremely important for Mauritius. Trade comprised 80 percent of GDP in 1970, increasing to 130 percent in 1998.\n\nMauritius's main export markets are the European Union (notably the United Kingdom, France, and Germany)\n\nTrade (expressed in billions of US$): MauritiusExportsImports1975.298.3301980.431.6091985.436.52319901.1941.61819951.5381.97619981.7342.183SOURCE: International Monetary Fund. International Financial Statistics Yearbook 1999.\n\nand the United States. Its imports come mainly from South Africa, India, the European Union, and China.\n\nTRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\nUp to the year 2000, Mauritius's major exports, sugar and textiles, have benefitted substantially from preferential trade agreements under which exports from Mauritius face lower duties than those goods from other countries. Most of Mauritius's sugar is now exported to the European Union (EU) under the Sugar Protocol of the Lomé Convention, which allows the country an export quota of 300,000 metric tons, at a price which is generally quite a lot higher than that paid on the world market. Mauritian textiles have also benefitted from preferential access to EU markets, and from the Multi-Fibre Agreement.\n\nHowever, the Lomé Convention expired in 2000, and the EU has decided to level access to its markets for developing countries, which will erode the preferential treatment received by former EU colonies such as Mauritius. The annual quota assigned to the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries will now be reduced and it is expected that the price received for sugar exports will also fall. This move is expected to hit Mauritius hard, as it is among the top 3 sugar exporters to the EU.\n\nThe Multi-Fibre Agreement is being phased out and will come to an end in 2005. The agreement works on a bilateral quota system designed both to protect clothing and textile manufacturers in developed countries and facilitate market access for developing countries. The impact on Mauritius will depend on whether the developed countries continue to try to protect their textile industries. In any event, the termination of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) is expected to result in intensified global competition in the clothing and textiles industries. As mentioned above, Mauritian clothing and textile companies are already moving to cheaper production locations in order to enhance their competitiveness. The U.S.'s Africa Growth and Opportunities Act is expected to benefit the Mauritian clothing and textile industry, and may mitigate the impact of the phasing out of the MFA.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mauritius followed a policy of import substitution, which involved protecting certain domestic industries from outside competition by keeping tariffs at high levels. This policy reduced the country's reliance on outside imports. However, following the global trend, Mauritius began to open up its markets for imports in the 1980s. Mauritius is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and is therefore committed to certain WTO agreements, designed to promote free trade among nations. Mauritius is a member of the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Indian Ocean Commission.\n\nMONEY\n\nThe country's central bank is the Bank of Mauritius, while the commercial banking system is dominated by 2 banks, the Mauritius Commercial Bank and the State Bank of Mauritius. There are a number of other, smaller, banks in operation, however. There is an extensive ATM network across the island, and ATM-sharing mechanisms are now in place. Progress has also been made with regard to developing a better, electronically-based, national payment system.\n\nThe Mauritian Rupee has decreased in the value relative to the U.S. dollar, with the decline being fairly marked over the period 1996-98, where it depreciated by an average of 10.5 percent per year. There have been no dramatic devaluations or currency crises in the history of the country, however. Inflation , too, has remained at manageable levels, averaging 7.6 percent between 1990 and 1999.\n\nThere are no exchange controls in Mauritius, which means that both foreigners and locals can take an unlimited amount of money out of the country if they wish to do so.\n\nThe Stock Exchange of Mauritius (SEM) has been in operation since 1989. Its market capitalization is currently around US$1,643 million, with 48 listed companies. There are a further 80 companies listed on the \"overthe-counter\"\n\nExchange rates: MauritiusMauritian rupees per US$1Jan 200127.900200026.250199925.186199822.993199721.057199617.948SOURCE: CIA World Factbook 2001 [ONLINE].\n\nGDP per Capita (US$)Country19751980198519901998Mauritius1,5311,8022,1512,9554,034United States19,36421,52923,20025,36329,683South Africa4,5744,6204,2294,1133,918ComorosN/A499544516403SOURCE: United Nations.

The trading activity taking place has increased substantially over the years, although it is still low by international standards.\n\nPOVERTY AND WEALTH\n\nAll Mauritians have benefitted from the country's prolonged economic growth, particularly from the significant reduction in unemployment. A 1992 national survey found that 10.6 percent of the population was living below the poverty line. World Bank estimates put the poverty rate in 1999 at about 5 percent, however. These figures are difficult to compare across countries, since different countries have different definitions of poverty. Primary school enrolment is now close to 100 percent, up from 79 percent in 1980. Education and health care are free, and all Mauritians have access to safe water and sanitation. Life expectancy has also increased from 66 years in 1980 to 71 in 1998. According to the CIA World Factbook, life expectancy is now 75 years for females and 67 years for males.\n\nHowever, poverty and wealth are still delineated to some extent along racial lines. Descendants of the French plantation owners still control a major portion of the economy, in spite of the fact that they only comprise 2 percent of the population. The Creoles, on the other hand, are the ethnic group which faces the greatest hardships. The recent increase in unemployment may rekindle the racial tensions which seemed to disappear during Mauritius's prosperous years.\n\nWORKING CONDITIONS\n\nTrade unions are permitted in Mauritius and trade union membership stood at 106,000 in 1995, representing about 29 percent of wage and salary earners. Trade union activity has decreased as the population has become wealthier and unemployment has declined. Over the period 1990-1995, there were between 4 and 9 strikes annually.\n\nThe steady rise in unemployment between 1996 and 1999 signifies that much still has to be done to improve the skills profile of the workforce. As of 2000, the demand for skilled workers outstripped the supply, especially in fields such as marketing, management, accounting, and computing.\n\nWomen make up about 27 percent workforce, a relatively low proportion by international standards, although female labor force participation has increased since 1980. Women earn on average about half of what their male counterparts earn. The state provides welfare payments for the unemployed, and there is a social aid scheme for poor families. There is also a national pension scheme.\n\nCOUNTRY HISTORY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\n1510. Portuguese visit Mauritius, then an uninhabited island.\n\n1598. Dutch settle on the island, introducing sugar cane.\n\n1710. Dutch leave the island for the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.\n\n1715. French occupy the island. The building of the harbor of Port Louis, which then becomes the capital, takes place.\n\nHousehold Consumption in PPP TermsCountryAll foodClothing and footwearFuel and power aHealth care bEducation bTransport & CommunicationsOtherMauritius218133131032United States139946851South AfricaN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AComorosN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AData represent percentage of consumption in PPP terms.aExcludes energy used for transport.bIncludes government and private expenditures.SOURCE: World Bank. World Development Indicators 2000.\n\n1810. British conquer the island.\n\n1814. Mauritius formally ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris. However, most of the French settlers remain on the island and are allowed to keep their customs, religions, and laws. The French plantation aristocracy retain their economic prominence and few British people come to the colony.\n\n1835. Britain abolishes slavery (slaves had mainly come from Madagascar, Senegal, and Mozambique), amid much resistance from French plantation owners. This leads to importation of about 500,000 Indian indentured laborers to work in the sugar cane fields. The rapid development of infrastructure takes place and the British begin to provide free primary education.\n\n1860s. The sugar economy begins to decline, due to increased sugar production in other countries and resultant lower prices. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 shifts trade routes away from the Indian Ocean.\n\n1917. Indenture system formally ends.\n\n1959. First elections under universal suffrage are held.\n\n1968. Mauritius achieves independence. The country adopts a constitution based on British parliamentary system. A few weeks before independence, violence between Creoles and Muslims leaves 25 people dead and hundreds injured.\n\n1970. Enactment of the Export Processing Zones Act.\n\n1971. The Militant Movement of Mauritius (MMM) calls a number of debilitating strikes. A coalition government led by the Mauritius Labor Party (MLP; headed by Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam) promulgates the Public Order Act which bans many forms of political activity. A state of emergency lasts until 1976.\n\n1982. MMM-led government gains power in elections, with Anerood Jugnauth as Prime Minister and Paul Bérenger as Finance Minister.\n\n1983. Ruling coalition breaks up and new elections are held. Jugnauth's new party, the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), joins with the MLP and the Mauritian Social Democrat Party to win the election comfortably.\n\n1991. A coalition between the MSM and MMM wins the elections.\n\n1992. The constitution is amended to make Mauritius a republic with the British Commonwealth.\n\n2000. Anerood Jugnauth is reelected president as head of a coalition between the MSM and MMM.\n\nFUTURE TRENDS\n\nThe World Bank notes that Mauritius faces several challenges in the near future due to rising unemployment and increasing external competition for export markets. These are: to improve the economic growth rate through higher productivity, to raise skill levels through better education, to encourage investment in new industries, and to reform the civil service. Reform of the education system in particular is a priority, since an increasing number of young people are entering the job market without the requisite qualifications. At the same time, the government is focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises as a strategy for promoting economic growth and unemployment.\n\nThe recent setback in economic growth has spurred an internal campaign against poverty on the island, resulting in the establishment of the Mauritius Trust Fund. The Trust will use its US$1.5 million budget to fund over 270 projects across the island and also in the neighboring Rodrigues Island. These projects are directed at infrastructure, education, social cohesion through social and cultural programs, as well as coordination of different programs of action. Also, the combined efforts of the Mauritian Women and Family Welfare Ministry are spreading a message to women to end poverty through education.\n\nFor business, however, the mood is optimistic. It is estimated that close to 53 percent of the population expects the volume of production and services to increase in the year 2001, according to local surveys.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nMauritius has no territories or colonies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBusinessmap.
