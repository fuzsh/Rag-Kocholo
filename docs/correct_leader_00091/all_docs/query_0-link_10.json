        "text": "On February 2, 2016 local time, Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth of Mauritius met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the prime ministerial office in Port Louis.\n\nAnerood Jugnauth expressed that Mauritius-China relations have always kept a strong development momentum. Mauritius thanks China for its long-term and vigorous support for its economic and social development, which successfully transformed Mauritius from a single-product economy to a diversified economy. Mauritius is now committed to realizing its vision toward 2030 and hopes to continuously obtain China's help in the process. Mauritius will carry out cooperation with China in maritime economy and encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest in Mauritius and welcomes more Chinese tourists to travel in Mauritius. Mauritius will play a bridging role between Africa and Asia and serve as a gateway for China to enter the African continent.\n\nWang Yi said that China and Mauritius have enjoyed mutual respect and equal treatment for years and their relations are maintaining a development momentum. Both sides should blueprint bilateral relations from a broader perspective and add more strategic connotation to their cooperation in line with the changes of international situation, especially the trend of globalization. Both sides can expand their cooperation westward to the African continent and explore ways to turn Mauritius into a gateway for Chinese enterprises to enter Africa, a platform to offer financial services and a base to offer personnel training by taking advantage of the ten China-Africa cooperation plans put forward by President Xi Jinping at the FOCAC Johannesburg Summit. Both sides can also expand their cooperation eastward to Asia, deepen their cooperation in maritime economy, tourism and aviation, and explore ways to extend the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to Mauritius, so as to open up a new prospect for bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation."
