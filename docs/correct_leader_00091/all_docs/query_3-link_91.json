It will also enable us to share our experience and to reinforce our various linkages across the world wherever we are,â€™â€™ he says.\n\nAnd itâ€™s not just a bonding experience for PIOs. India and Mauritius share a similar multicultural background and an event like PBD will help the two nations to learn from each other. Says Jugnauth: â€œAs India, Mauritius is an open society where religious and cultural tolerance is enshrined in our respective Constitutions. We encourage all communities to practise their religious beliefs in complete freedom.â€�\n\nWhile Jugnauth has never really considered applying for a PIO card from the Indian government, he feels that the rich religious and cultural legacy bestowed to him by his forefathers has given him and others in Mauritius the same deep cultural values that are there in India. â€œRegarding my roots, I come from a traditional Mauritian family of Indian Origin,â€™â€™ he says. And he even looks forward to Mauritius becoming the venue of PBD sometime in future. â€œAn event of such a magnitude provides the right platform for exchange of ideas, defines better commonalities of purpose, facilitates interaction and sets the scene for closer cooperation between peoples of Indian origin. It is also an important step towards building international links between nations which have a large number of PIOs,â€™â€™ he says.\n\nMinister of foreign affairs of Mauritius A. K. Gayan, also feels that meetings like PBD should be held on a regular basis in different countries.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nNew slabs announced in new income tax regime\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nExplained: the hullaballoo around Karnataka’s 14-hour workday move\n\nCan Aadhaar 2.0 sow the seeds of economic prosperity for kisans and kiranas?\n\nA concrete reason why Adani is fighting Birla in this key sector\n\nCan IndiGo repeat its record INR3k crore profit?
