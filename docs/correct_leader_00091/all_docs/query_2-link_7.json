        "text": "The President of the Republic of Seychelles, Mr Danny Faure, met with the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, in the margins of the Francophone summit currently being held in Madagascar.\n\nThey reaffirmed the close relationship that the two countries share and have agreed to enhance these relations in the future.\n\nThey focused on the strengthening of economic ties so as to bring long term prospects and development for the two countries and their peoples.\n\nIn this context Sir Anerood invited President Faure to participate in the Economic Forum to be held in Mauritius on the 27th March 2017 under the aegis of the African Union.\n\nAnother point of importance which they raised during the meeting relates to the issue of substance abuse which is currently affecting both countries. Mauritius has agreed to share its expertise and experience with Seychelles and help support the country’s rehabilitation programmes.\n\nBoth leaders also reviewed the cooperation in the health sector with particular emphasis on the recruitment of Mauritian doctors for Seychelles.\n\nMauritius has sought the support of Seychelles in their efforts to reclaim the sovereignty of Chagos from the United Kingdom. President Faure has pledged Seychelles’ support to their just cause.\n\nSir Anerood has invited President Faure for an official visit to Mauritius next year at a mutually agreed date."
