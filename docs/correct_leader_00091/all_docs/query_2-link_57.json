Though he writes easily in both French and English, Virahsawmy is most renowned for his efforts to popularize the use of Creole.

The dance can be traced back to the 18th century, when it was performed by slaves.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 20, 2024, 1:59 AM ET (CBC)\n\nSask. swimmer ready to represent home country of Mauritius in Paris\n\nJuly 19, 2024, 11:31 PM ET (CBC)\n\nU of R swimmer hopes to make a splash for Mauritius at 2024 Olympics\n\nJuly 18, 2024, 4:55 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nIndia’s first overseas Jan Aushadi Kendra inaugurated in Mauritius\n\nJuly 16, 2024, 12:21 PM ET (The Indian Express)\n\nJaishankar: India’s ties with Mauritius have blossomed into robust partnership\n\nJuly 16, 2024, 1:21 AM ET (The Indian Express)\n\nJaishankar reaffirms India’s continued support to Mauritius in its quest for progress\n\nRepresentational and abstract painting flourish, and there are art galleries in the major towns. The major national cultural institutions are the Palace Theatre in Rose Hill, the Port Louis Theatre, the Mauritius Institute, which includes a natural history museum and a historical museum, and the Mauritius Archives. There are both public and institutional libraries.\n\nAlso of cultural interest is Aapravasi Ghat, in Port Louis, and Le Morne Cultural Landscape, located on a peninsula on the southwest side of the island; both have been designated UNESCO World Heritage sites. Aapravasi Ghat was used as an immigration depot from 1849–1923 for indentured labourers arriving from India. Le Morne Cultural Landscape, comprising Le Morne Mountain and most of its foothills, was a place of refuge during the 18th and early 19th centuries for many escaped slaves, known as maroons. Another area of cultural significance is Grand Bassin Lake, where Hindus bring offerings during the Maha Shivaratree festival.\n\nSports and recreation\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Country Quiz\n\nThere is a very active sporting culture in Mauritius. Football (soccer), introduced by the British, claims the greatest number of participants and fans. At the highest level there is a national team that competes in the African Cup of Nations tournament. Locally, fans follow the teams in a football league that has been around for decades. The small Franco-Mauritian community avidly supports a highly organized and rather ritualized season of deer hunting. Mauritians from all communities make winter horse racing one of the most popular and highly attended sporting activities of the year. Individual Mauritians have competed at the highest international levels in both bridge and backgammon.\n\nSince its independence, Mauritius has actively participated in both regional and international sporting events. The Indian Ocean Island Games have been hosted in Mauritius, as have international tournaments for boxing, judo, and women’s volleyball. Mauritius made its Olympic debut at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\nAreas of recreational interest include Black River Gorges National Park, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Gardens, Trou aux Cerfs (an extinct volcano that is now heavily forested), and the island’s numerous beaches and casinos.\n\nMedia and publishing\n\nThe Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation transmits foreign radio and television broadcasts and also locally produced radio and television programs. Daily news service is provided in French, English, and Creole; additional programming takes place in a variety of other languages. School broadcasting constitutes an important part of the service. Most Mauritian households also receive French television programs from the French-governed island of Réunion. The press operates freely, and there are numerous daily and weekly publications in English, French, Chinese, and other languages.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history and colonial administration\n\nMauritius was long uninhabited, though it was probably known to Arab seafarers from the 10th century or earlier. It was visited by the Portuguese in the early 16th century, but they did not settle the island. The Dutch took possession of it from 1598 to 1710, called it Mauritius for the stadhouder (governor) Maurice of Nassau, and attempted to settle the island in 1638–58 and again in 1664–1710; abandoning their attempts, they left it to pirates. In 1721 the French East India Company occupied Mauritius, which was renamed Île de France. Settlement proceeded slowly over the next 40 years. In 1767 the French crown took over the island’s administration from the French East India Company. The French authorities brought African slaves to the island and established sugar planting as the main industry, and the colony prospered.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, when England and France were at war, privateers based on Île de France were a continual threat to British and Indian merchant vessels. In 1810 the British captured the island, and, upon restoration of peace in 1814, British sovereignty was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris. The name Mauritius was reinstated, but, in circumstances quite unique for a British colony, the customs, laws, and language remained French.\n\nPressure generated by the British abolitionist movement ended slavery there in 1835, and slaves were replaced by indentured labourers from India. The country’s modern-day Indo-Pakistani population stems from this program of replacing slavery with indentured servitude (deemed Britain’s “Great Experiment”); by the time it ended in the 1920s, almost a half million indentured labourers had come from India to work on the sugar plantations.\n\nMauritius prospered in the 1850s, but competition from beet sugar caused a decline. The malaria epidemic of 1866–68 drove shipping away from Port Louis, which further declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During World War I, when sugar prices rose, the economy prospered, but the Great Depression of the 1930s changed the situation drastically, culminating in labour unrest in 1937. World War II did not improve the Mauritian economy, and after 1945 economic reforms were introduced. Political and administrative reforms were also initiated, which led to independence.\n\nIn 1965 Britain transferred one of Mauritius’s outlying territories, the Chagos Archipelago (including the Diego Garcia atoll), to a newly created administrative unit, the British Indian Ocean Territory. In the following years the inhabitants of Chagos were resettled, most of them moving to Mauritius, and a joint British-U.S. military facility was constructed on Diego Garcia."
