We are extremely privileged and honoured to host Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a global icon,\" Premier Jugnauth said at a joint press briefing here. He said Prime Minister Modi's 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas' motto applies to Mauritius as well. \"I cherished the idea of transforming Mauritius into a cyber island. I had mentioned it to Mr Vajpayee. Response was immediate,\" added Premier Jugnauth. Prime Minister Modi today offered a concessional line of credit of 500 million U.S. dollars for civil infrastructure projects for the country. He said that he and his Mauritian counterpart considered the security cooperation between the two countries as a cornerstone of their strategic partnership. Prime Minister Modi, who arrived in Port Louis after the conclusion of his trip to Seychelles, had earlier called on Mauritius President Rajkeswur Purryag. He is on a two-day visit to the island nation and will be the Chief Guest at the Independence Day celebrations in the nation on March 12. He will also address the National Assembly of the country.
