I don't think they fully realise what they are doing.\" Angola signed the 1997 Ottawa convention banning landmines and on 25 July this year the Angolan parliament approved ratification of the Mine Ban Treaty, with 147 votes in favour, one against and one abstention.\n\nIn its Landmine Monitor Report 2000, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) which is made up various international organisations, including HRW and Norwegian People's AID (NPA) one of the largest humanitarian de-mining groups in Angola, said that both Angolan government troops and the UNITA rebel movement had continued to use anti-personnel mines.\n\nAn IRIN focus report on Angola's continued use of landmines can be found at: http://www.reliefweb.int/IRIN/sa/countrystories/angola/20000914.phtml\n\nANGOLA: New meningitis outbreak\n\nAt least one person has died and 10 others have become infected with meningitis following an outbreak of the disease among displaced people in the western province of Benguela, the UN office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has reported. In a situation report covering the period 21-27 October, OCHA said the outbreak had been reported among people arriving from a town called Yambala, 10 km south of Cubal. \"Due to insecurity, Yambala is inaccessible to humanitarian actors. Monitoring and vaccination programmes targeting the Yambala population in Cubal are on ongoing,\" it said. The report gave no further details other than say the outbreak was being monitored by health authorities.\n\nANGOLA: Press freedom fears\n\nFreedom of expression in Angola looks set to be squeezed even further under a draft press law which has been described as \"dictatorial\", \"contradictory\" and \"regressive\" by the independent local media. Many journalists are in uproar over the proposed law which was thrown open for debate six weeks ago. They have the support of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) which is appealing to the Angolan government to withdraw it.\n\n\"If passed, this law will make it practically impossible for journalists in Angola to cover any matter relating to the country's political life without risking incarceration,\" said CPJ executive director, Ann Cooper.\n\nAn IRIN focus report on the press freedom fears can be found at: http://www.reliefweb.int/IRIN/sa/countrystories/angola/20000911.phtml\n\nANGOLA: Cross border raid into Namibia\n\nA group of armed bandits, some of them wearing uniforms of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) this week launched a pre-dawn raid across the Angolan border into Namibia and raided three local homesteads. News reports said that no-one was injured in the raid which occurred at the border town of Shankara, some 90 km east of the Kavango regional capital, Rundu. \"There were around 10 bandits and three were in FAA uniforms,\" said one of the villagers. \"They cleaned out the houses by taking food, clothing and bedding.\"\n\nZIMBABWE: MDC offices damaged in grenade explosion\n\nThe main opposition party in Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said this week that it was \"shocked and dismayed\" that a hand-grenade had been hurled at its headquarters in the capital, Harare, late on Monday night. No-one was hurt in the explosion, it said. \"While we wait for police investigations all fingers point at ZANU-PF,\" said MDC spokesman Learnmore Jongwe said referring to President Robert Mugabe's ruling party. \"The MDC is a political party competing for political power and has rivals in the political arena.\"\n\nZIMBABWE: Police search opposition headquarters\n\nMeanwhile, police carrying warrants to search for weapons on Thursday raided the headquarters and other branch offices of the MDC the party said in a statement. \"In a bizarre response to Monday night's attack on the MDC's Fife Avenue headquarters, the police this morning raided the party's three Harare offices,\" the statement said.\n\nPolice and members of the CID arrived at the MDC offices in Fife Avenue, Eastgate and St Martins with warrants authorising them to search for 'arms of war - grenades, pistols, rifles, tearbombs'.\" The MDC said no weapons of any type had been found, and it accused police of exceeding the terms of their warrants by attempting to seize party documents.\n\nZIMBABWE: IMF demands economic and political reforms\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week said that President Robert Mugabe's government would have to implement \"orderly and transparent\" economic and political reforms before it could resume financial support programmes.\n\nPaulo Neuhaus, the IMF Assistant Director of the African Department, said in a statement after a three-week mission to assess the economy that only \"clear progress over the next few months\" could lay the groundwork for \"subsequent resumption of programme discussions with the IMF staff\".\n\nZIMBABWE: No loans for farmers\n\nHalf of Zimbabwe's 4,500 commercial farmers will not qualify for bank loans to buy crops or for development this season because their farms have been targeted for seizure by the government, reports said this week. The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) said a total of 2,102 farms have been listed by the government for compulsory acquisition, prompting local banks to demand letters of assurance of tenure from the government on those farmers whose properties have been earmarked for resettlement. The government, said CFU, had not provided these letters of assurance, forcing the farmers to scale down production levels while others were shutting down completely.\n\nZIMBABWE: Bumper cotton crop predicted\n\nMeanwhile, Zimbabwe will this season earn US $130 million from its sale of 350,000 mt of cotton because of the significant improvement in the prices of the crop on the world market. The cotton prices in the world market has improved from December levels of US 44 cents per pound to the current US 61 cents per pound, which has reportedly encouraged local growers to come forward with their crop. About 80 percent of Zimbabwe's cotton, the second biggest earner of foreign currency after tobacco, is produced by communal farmers. Commercial farmers account for the remaining 20 percent.\n\nZIMBABWE: Food riots warnings\n\nZimbabwe was likely to experience a repeat of the violent 1997 food riots if the government continued to turn a blind eye to economic problems affecting the country, Munyaradzi Gwisai, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Member of Parliament for Highfield, said this week. Gwisai said that the strikes would be worse than the 1997 food riots because workers could not continue to suffer in silence. Gwisai said the labour laws in the country were biased against workers and needed to be revised. \"The labour question can no longer be wished away. If it is not resolved, then it will be resolved on the shop floor and on the streets of our country and this time, in a manner that will make the December 1997 stay away and the January 1998 bread riots look like tea-party picnics,\" Gwisai said.\n\nZAMBIA: New refugee influx\n\nUNHCR told IRIN this week that it was checking reports that an estimated 600 Angolan refugees had entered Zambia in the past week from Angola's eastern Moxico province where Angolan government forces have been conducting a military offensive against UNITA rebels. A report in 'The Times of Zambia' said the refugees entered Zambia through the northwestern border town of Zambezi. \"We have more Angolans who have just entered the country to seek asylum in the past one week. More are expected to arrive in the coming days,\" Willie Manjomba, the Zambezi district commissioner said.\n\nMAURITIUS: Opposition sweeps to landslide victory\n\nAn opposition alliance in Mauritius was swept to power in a landslide general election victory this week. Announcing the final results , Electoral Commissioner Irsam Rahman said the alliance of the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien (MSM) and Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) had won 54 of the 62 seats in parliament. Hours after outgoing Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam accepted defeat, the alliance announced that MSM leader Sir Anerood Jugnauth would assume the premiership for the next three years and then hand over to his MMM partner, Paul Berenger. Ramgoolam's Labour Party-led coalition won six seats, and a tiny party from neighbouring Rodriques island won two seats. Rahman said turnout had averaged 80 percent of the island's 779,431 registered voters.\n\nIn a victory speech carried by the daily, 'L'Express', Sir Aenrood, who has previously served as prime minister, said: \"In the new team, there will be no question of the allowing decisions on important issues to linger longer than six months. We have demonstrated that we are worthy of your confidence.\" He said one of his first priorities would be to encourage more foreign investment in Mauritius. He told another daily, 'Le Mauricien': \"This victory will enable the MSM-MMM to keep our electoral promises on a new government programme. This large victory will also enable us to guarantee the political stability of this country for the next five years.\"\n\nSOUTH AFRICA: Premier escapes blast\n\nThe premier of South Africa's Western Cape province, Gerald Morkel this week narrowly escaped serious injury when a bomb exploded outside a centre in Cape Town shortly after his arrival to address a political meeting. The bomb - the ninth this year in the city hosting the country's parliament - injured seven people, including a young girl, three women, a policeman and two other men. Morkel's spokesman, Chris Koole, told IRIN that the premier had just walked into Samaj centre when the bomb went off. \"The bomb damaged the premier's car and the police escort vehicle behind it, as well as other cars near the scene,\" Koole said.\n\nThe latest explosion came a day after parliament debated the continuing bombing spree and four days after a magistrate - who was presiding over urban terror cases - was killed outside his house. On Friday, another bomb went off outside a cafe in the Observatory suburb of the city, but caused no injuries. The Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete in parliament blamed the movement PAGAD for the bombs, saying: \"They use Islam as a front for their cowardly activities, bringing the name of a great religion into disrepute. They are terrorists, pure and simple.\"\n\nNAMIBIA: Suspected UNITA detainees held\n\nThe Namibian government this week lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding 82 people detained in Dorbabis, about 100 km southeast of the capital, Windhoek, saying they were self-confessed bandits of Angola's rebel UNITA movement. The Permanent Secretary of the Home Affairs Ministry, Niilo Taapopi, told journalists that after investigations, the group was found to pose a security threat to Namibia. \"During joint operations by the security forces in the southeast Kavango region, 82 UNITA soldiers and collaborators were apprehended and are now detained under the Immigration Control Act for being suspected illegal immigrants,\" Taapopi said. Taapopi stressed that the detention of the suspects at Dorbabis denied them the right to appear before a court of law within 48 hours.\n\nNAMIBIA: Angolan refugees want to return home\n\nSome 13,000 Angolan refugees in Namibia's northeastern Kavango region have formally asked the Angolan consulate in the northern border town of Rundu to take them home. The Angolan representative in the region, Joao Pempela was quoted in reports as saying this week that about 15,000 Angolans in the region were all willing to go home. He added that 13,000 of them had lodged formal petitions.\n\nCOMOROS: Anti-separatists allegedly tortured\n\nAt least 24 opponents of the separatist administration on the island of Anjouan have been tortured, with eight among them sustaining serious injuries, local human rights groups charged this week. According to an AFP dispatch which was not independently confirmed, most of the detainees belong to the GIRMA movement opposed to the secession of Anjouan, one of three Comoro Islands in the troubled Indian Ocean archipelago. Quoting sources which requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, it said the 24 had been rounded up between 28-31 August after four days of clashes between opponents and supporters of Anjouan's separatist leader, Said Abeid Abderemane.\n\nMOZAMBIQUE: Locusts, wild animals threaten harvests\n\nSwarms of locusts are devastating crops in Mozambique's southern province of Inhambane, as it struggles to recover from floods earlier this year, agricultural authorities said this week. Antonio Limbau, head of the local agricultural department, said teams had been deployed with large quantities of pesticides to eliminate locusts that had invaded about 160,000 hectares of land. Limbau described the situation as \"critical\" and said that the locusts were destroying cassava, a staple in Mozambique. \"Now we are involved in a fight to eliminate them. So far we have sent large quantities of pesticides and our team there seems to be getting the situation under control,\" he said.\n\nSWAZILAND: Newspaper to be reopened\n\nThe government of Swaziland said it would allow a daily newspaper it closed in February to reopen again next month. The closure of the state-owned 'Swazi Observer' followed the refusal of the editorial staff to disclose its sources of confidential correspondence between the Swaziland and South African police on drug trafficking investigations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) is to ask the United Nations and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) to intervene against perceived repression of the media. According to reports MISA took this resolution after a five-day conference in Swaziland, seen as one of the main offenders.\n\n[NOTE TO SUBSCRIBERS: IRIN recently launched a new service for Afghanistan and Central Asia.
