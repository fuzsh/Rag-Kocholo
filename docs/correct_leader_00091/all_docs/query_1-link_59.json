        "text": "July 14, 2021\n\nUpdated by Jared Watkins\n\nWho is the first female President in Africa? How many female Presidents has Africa had so far? This is one of many unknown great stories of African women. In fact, the narrative we hear often is negative, portraying African woman’s struggle and never the triumph.\n\nThis profile of African Women Heads of State aims at telling the other side of their story and most importantly inspiring today and tomorrow’s generations of African woman to be greater than those who came before then. These are African Women Heads of State as of July 2021.\n\nSamia Suluhu Hassan, President of Tanzania (March 2021 – Present)\n\nSamia Suluhu Hassan is the first acting female President of Tanzania and joins the ranks of Sahle-work Zewde as the only other current female President on the continent. She was sworn into office on March 19, 2019 after the sudden passing of the former Tanzanian President, John Magufuli. Prior to being selected as Magufuli’s running mate, Hassan was an avid journalist and activist in Tanzania.\n\nThese African women Heads of State stand on the shoulders of many female giants, known and unknown, remembered and forgotten, who came before them. These include for example, but not limited to the Dahomey Amazons of Benin, an all-female military regiment on whose shoulders stand many women serving in armed services and law enforcement.\n\nThe contribution of women to what Africa is today is unquestionable. However, the recovery from the disruptive and brutal colonization and slave trade has been very slow. Partially, African leaders mostly male who mismanaged, abused and continue to abuse their power since the end of colonization equally share the blame for disempowering African women whose contribution is unequivocally needed to build a more prosperous, just and peaceful Africa.\n\n2019 “List of Female African Presidents” by Written by Adwoa Ohemeng, edited by Ntama Bahati found here: https://afjn.org/list-of-female-african-presidents/"
