        "text": "Mauritius President named veteran politician Sir Anerood Jugnauth as Prime Minister, after the 84-year-old won a landslide taking nearly three-quarters of the seats in Parliament.\n\nMr. Jugnauth, a former President and Prime Minister, was handed his letter of appointment at a meeting at State House, a statement from the office of President Kailash Purryag said.\n\nMr. Jugnauth’s centre-right Alliance Lepep swept 47 out of 62 seats in the Indian Ocean nation’s Parliament, after voters on Wednesday rejected the ruling party’s bid to boost presidential powers.\n\nThe coalition of the outgoing ruling Labour Party and the former opposition Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) of ex-Prime Minister Paul Berenger took just 13 seats.\n\nTwo other lawmakers from local parties on the small island of Rodrigues, some 560 kilometres to the east, usually support the government.\n\nDebate over constitutional reform — notably over a divisive proposal to strengthen presidential powers — made Wednesday’s poll one of the most crucial since the islands gained independence from Britain in 1968.\n\nMr. Jugnauth, previously PM between 1982 and 1995 and again between 2000 and 2003, has promised he will boost the economy.\n\nMauritius is one of the richest countries in Africa, a middle-income country of some 1.3 million people, with a per capita GDP of just over $9,000.\n\nThe country has had only four prime ministers in its history."
