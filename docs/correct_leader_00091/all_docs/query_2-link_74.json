        "text": "I would like to wrap up this month on a healthy note of celebration for the gender that has birthed, raised, and nurtured most if not ALL of us: Women!!\n\nThis year, I wanted to celebrate equity by revising this article, which was done with the help of Adwoa Ohemeng and Ntama Bahati. Imagine a gender-equal world. A world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination. A world that's diverse, equitable, and inclusive. A world where difference is valued and celebrated. Together, we can forge women's equality. Collectively, we can all #EmbraceEquity.\n\nCelebrate women's achievements. Raising awareness about discrimination. Take action to drive gender parity.\n\nSince 1911, IWD has belonged to everyone, everywhere. Inclusion means all IWD action is valid. Collective action and shared ownership of driving gender parity are what make International Women's Day impactful.\n\nSo make International Women's Day your day and do what you can to truly make a positive difference for women.\n\n#LetsCreateAfrica #iwd2023.\n\nToday, I celebrate Female Heads of State in Africa\n\nCan anyone name the continent's first female head of state? How many African countries have had female heads of the state thus far? This is just one of the many amazing stories of unsung African women. The story we are told about African women is almost always a tragic one, focused on their hardships rather than their successes.\n\nThis profile of African women in political leadership positions tries to show the other side of their lives and, more importantly, to encourage modern and future generations of African women to do better than their foremothers.\n\nWomen can bring about significant change. Women leaders are at the forefront of the global effort to recover from the epidemic and usher in a more equitable future for all people. More African women presidents would send a message to young girls and boys that they can achieve anything they set their minds to. African countries with female heads of state are listed below.\n\n(Please feel free to add to the list if I might have missed anyone.)\n\nTanzania's current leader, President Samia Suluhu Hassan, took office in April of 2021.\n\nHassan became president on March 19, 2021, after the death of her predecessor, President John Pombe Joseph Magufuli.\n\nHassan has been a member of Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), for a long time. She got her start in politics when she was elected to the Zanzibar House of Representatives and made a minister. In 2005, she was reelected and given another ministerial portfolio. She was the only female minister of significant rank, and her male coworkers \"looked down on\" her because of her gender. She ran for a seat in the National Assembly in the Makunduchi constituency in 2010 and easily won with an overwhelming 80 per cent of the vote. President Jakaya Kikwete put her in charge of Union Affairs as Minister of State for Union Affairs. The Constituent Assembly, responsible for writing a new constitution for the country, elected her vice chairperson in 2014. While working as a clerk for the Ministry of Planning and Development in 1986, she attended classes for an advanced diploma in public administration at what is now Mzumbe University. She studied for her master's degree in economics at the University of Manchester between 1992 and 1994. In 2015, she got her Master of Science in Community Economic Development through a partnership between the Open University of Tanzania and Southern New Hampshire University.\n\nDogb√© Tomegah has been Togo's prime minister since September 2020.\n\nTogo's new prime minister is named Victoire Sid√©m√©ho Dzidudu Dogb√© Tomegah (since September 28, 2020). She breaks ground as the position's first female holder. Prime Minister Dogb√© Tomegah is a seasoned politician who commands a lot of respect. She had been employed at the United Nations Development Program before that year (2008). Dogb√© Tom√©gah was the President's Cabinet Director in 2008. As Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister, she was in charge of the new Togolian base's development here. In 2010, after President Faure Gnassingb√© was re-elected, Gilbert Houngbo gave Tomegah Dogb√© the job of Minister of Grassroots Development, Youth Craft, and Youth Employment. This was during Houngbo's second term as president. Throughout Kwesi Ahoomey-first Zunu's administration in 2012 and 2013 and his second administration in 2013 and 2015, she continued to serve as a minister. Komi S√©lom Klassou succeeded Ahoomey-Zunu as prime minister on June 5, 2015, following the country's presidential election in April 2015. On June 28, 2015, when Klaassou appointed his cabinet, Tomegah Dogb√© continued to serve as Minister of Basic Development, Crafts, Youth, and Youth Employment.\n\nSince July 2020, Rose Christiane Ossouka Raponda has served as Prime Minister of Gabon.\n\nFirst female head of government in Gabon, Christiane Ossouka Raponda (16 July 2020). Raponda, the current prime minister, was born in Libreville in 1964. Her academic background is in economics. At the Gabonese Institute of Economics and Finance, she studied economics and public finance and graduated with a degree. She has devoted her life to serving Gabon. Raponda has held positions at the Housing Bank of Gabon and the Gabonese Ministry of the Economy. From February 2012 until January 2014, she was the Minister of the Budget. After that, on January 26, 2014, she was elected mayor of Libreville, Gabon's capital, as a representative of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party. She held the role from 2016 until 2019, making her the first woman to do so since 1956. In addition, she took the helm of the African branch of the United Cities and Local Governments. The contribution of Raponda to the stability of Africa cannot be overstated. From February 2019 to July 2020, she was the Defense Minister of her country.\n\nSaara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has been the prime minister of Namibia since March 21st, 2015.\n\nUpon her return to Namibia, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila got a job in the Office of the President as a desk officer under President Sam Nujoma. In 1995, at the age of 27, she was promoted to the position of minister and made Director General of the National Planning Commission. She assumed her current position as Minister of Finance in 2003. She was awarded the Most Brilliant Order of the Sun, Second Class, on Heroes Day in 2014. On March 21, 2015, she was sworn in alongside President Hage Geingob as the fourth Prime Minister of Namibia. In this role, she is the first woman to serve.\n\nBurundi's Interim President Slyvie Kiningi (February ‚Äì October 1993)\n\nSlyvie Kiningi made history as the continent's first female head of state. From February 10, 1993, to October 7, 1994, she served as the Prime Minister of Burundi. After President Melchior Ndadaye and six of his colleagues were murdered on October 27, 1993, she took over as interim leader of the country until February 5, 1994. Upon his passing, Kiningi assembled a cabinet of 15 ministers to lead the country. This would make her the continent's first female head of state.\n\nActing President of South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Cassaburi (September 2005)\n\nWhen both the President and Vice President of South Africa were out of the country for four days in September 2005, Ivy Matsepe-Cassaburi stepped in as acting President. She received a government appointment on September 25, 2008, to serve as the country's temporary head of state for 14 hours. President Thabo Mbeki resigned during this time, and Kgalema Motlanthe took his place.\n\nLiberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf ( January 2006 ‚Äì January 2018)\n\nAfter winning the presidency in 2005 and again in 2011, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf made history as Africa's first democratically elected leader. She had previously challenged and lost to Charles Taylor for the presidency in 1997. The Economic Community of West African States also elected her as its chair in June 2016.\n\nGabon's Temporary President, Rose Francine Rogombe (June 2009 ‚Äì October 2009)\n\nAfter Omar Bongo, President of Gabon, passed away in June 2009, Rose Francine Rogombe served as interim president until October 2009. Since she was the current Senate President at the time, she was the first person in line to succeed in the presidency.\n\nActing President of Mauritius Agnes Monique Ohsan Bellepeau (March ‚Äì July 2012 and May ‚Äì June 2015)\n\nThe acting President of Mauritius from March 31, 2012, till July 21, 2012, was Agnes Monique Ohsan Bellepeau. During this time, former Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth resigned and new President Kailash Purryag was sworn in. From May 29, 2015, until the inauguration of new President Ameenah Gurib on June 5, 2015, she again acted as President after Purryag's departure.\n\nPresident of Malawi Joyce Hilda Banda (April 2012 ‚Äì May 2014)\n\nAfter Bingu wa Mutharika's untimely passing on April 7, 2012, Joyce Hilda Banda took over as President of Malawi until her term ended on May 31, 2014. She served as president for the fourth time. She made history as the first female Vice President of her country (May 2009 to April 2012). Forbes magazine ranked President Banda as the most powerful African woman and the 40th most influential woman in the world in 2014.\n\nActing President of the Central African Republic Catherine Samba (January 2014 ‚Äì March 2016)\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the Central African Republic's Interim President Catherine Samba Panza served in such a role. When rebel leader Michael Djotodia resigned, she took over as interim president. She previously served as mayor of Bangui, the country's capital, from 2013 to 2014.\n\nPresident of Mauritius Ameenah Gurib-Fakim (June 2015 ‚Äì March 2018)\n\nFrom 2015 until 2018, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim served as the first female president of Mauritius. As President Kailash Purryag resigned in 2014, she was chosen as a replacement candidate. The National Assembly unanimously confirmed her as president.\n\nEthiopia's President, Sahle-Work Zewde ( October 2018 ‚Äì Present)\n\nAmong Africa's 54 presidents, Sahle-Work Zewde is the continent's first and only female leader. On October 25, 2018, she took her oath of office after winning with unanimous support in the National Legislative Assembly. She previously served as the United Nations Secretary-General's Representative to the African Union and the Head of the United Nations Office to the African Union before being elected president.\n\nThese African female heads of state can see further because they are built on the shoulders of many women leaders who came before them, both famous and obscure. The Dahomey Amazons of Benin are just one example of the many women who are making strides in male-dominated fields like the armed forces and law enforcement.\n\nThere is no denying the importance of women in shaping modern-day Africa. But it has taken a long time to recover from the devastating effects of colonization and the slave trade. Disempowering African women, whose participation is unquestionably needed to build a more wealthy, just, and peaceful Africa, is in part the fault of African leaders, most of whom are men, who have mishandled, abused, and continue to abuse their power since the end of colonization."
