        "text": "Mauritius is a stable and prosperous Indian Ocean archipelago.\n\nOnce dependent on sugar exports, the island has built up a strong outsourcing and financial services sector, as well as an important tourism industry, and now boasts one of Africa's highest per capita incomes.\n\nMauritius claims sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, in a dispute with Britain that saw hundreds of islanders deported to make way for a US military base on the island of Diego Garcia in the 1960s.\n\nThe Chagos archipelago, 1,280km to the north-east, were administered as part of Mauritius from the 18th Century onwards. In 1965, three years before Mauritian independence, the UK separated the islands, along with Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches from the Seychelles, to form the British Indian Ocean Territory - the latter were returned to Seychelles in 1976 on its independence.\n\nRead more country profiles, external - Profiles by BBC Monitoring, external\n\nPravind Kumar Jugnauth succeeded his father, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, as prime minister in January 2017, he subsequently won the November 2019 general election.\n\nUntil he stepped down, Sir Anerood had been the longest-serving prime minister since Mauritius gained independence from Britain in 1968.\n\nMr Jugnauth is leader of the Militant Socialist Movement party.\n\n10th Century - Malay, African and Arab sailors visit island but do not settle.\n\n1510 - Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas visits the island and names it CirnÃ© but the Portuguese do not establish a permanent settlement.\n\n1598 - Dutch claim the uninhabited island and rename it after their head of state, Maurice, Prince of Orange and Count of Nassau.\n\n1664-1710 - Dutch withdraw after repeated attempts at colonisation. By this time the dodo - a unique bird found only on Mauritius - has become extinct.\n\n1710-1810 - French take possession, establishing a sugar industry based on slave labour.\n\n1796 - Settlers break away from French control when the government in Paris attempts to abolish slavery.\n\n1810 - British forces land in Mauritius after defeating French forces.\n\n1814 - Mauritius, Seychelles and Rodrigues ceded to Britain under Treaty of Paris.\n\n1834 - British abolish slavery.\n\n1835 - Indentured labour system introduced. In subsequent decades hundreds of thousands of workers arrive from India.\n\n1966 - Britain expels some 2,000 residents of the Chagos archipelago, many to Mauritius, and leases islands to the US for 50 years. US builds a military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.\n\n1968 - Independence declared.\n\n1992 - Mauritius becomes a republic."
