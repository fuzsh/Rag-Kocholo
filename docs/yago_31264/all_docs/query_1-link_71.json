        "text": "The Balearic Islands of Mallorca (Majorca), Minorca (Menorca), Formentera, and Eivissa (Ibiza) sit approximately 50 to 190 kilometers off the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The archipelago’s importance to Aragonese and broader Iberian trade, culture, language, and history makes it important for understanding the Crown’s expansion into the Mediterranean during and after the reign of Jaume I “the Conqueror” (r. 1213–1276). Until the mid-thirteenth century, the Balearic Islands were controlled by the Almohad Caliphate based in northwestern Africa. At its height the Almohad Caliphate controlled territory in North Africa, the Balearic Islands, and the Southern Iberian Peninsula on the borders of Castile-Leon and Aragon. Prior to Almohad rule, the island was controlled by the Umayyad Caliphate in the early eighth century before it later joined the Emirate of Cordoba in the latter half of the eighth century. From the thirteenth to mid-fourteenth centuries, the Kingdom of Mallorca (Regnum Mallorcae) was established as a cadet dynasty of the House of Barcelona in the Crown of Aragon. The Mallorcan kingdom was initially controlled by the king of Aragon until Jaume I of Aragon’s son, Jaume II (r. 1276–1286, 1295–1311), became the island kingdom’s first ruler that was not also simultaneously the king of Aragon. Between Jaume II’s reign and the end of the Kingdom’s independence in 1349, Mallorca functioned as an important trading post and political ally of the Crown of Aragon. Its role in broader Mediterranean politics, the history of slavery, and the conflicts between Aragon and Genoa made the island chain important for the power dynamic between the Iberian Peninsula and the broader Mediterranean region.\n\nFrom the 13th century on, some ports of the Crown of Aragon established close commercial relations with Egypt, Syrie and 'Romania', links that underwent different phases of development as well as experiencing difficulties. Nevertheless, the oriental trade played an increasing role in the economy of the Crown of Aragon. It especially promoted the development of cloth making and exports. This enable the traditional historiographic thesis of an economic decline of the Crown of Aragon, and especially Catalonia, at the end of the Middle Ages, to be criticised. In the opposite direction, its merchants imported large volumes of spices, which generated huge profits. After a long period of competition between the main ports of the Crown of Aragon, a repartition of the areas of commercialisation was progressivly organised. The kings encouraged this change while also maintaining good diplomatic relations with the eastern monarchs, to promote trade. However, in some phases, one can also observe that the monarchs' goals were very distinct from those of their merchants.\n\nThe following study aims to present the Catalan-Aragonese presence in the Eastern Mediterranean during the 13th and 14th centuries, based on the work of Ramón Muntaner. Initially, some details regarding the above source will be stated, and also it will be mentioned briefly the course of the Crown of Aragon up to the end of the Wars of the Vespers on the eve of the 14th century. The main object of the study is the accomplishments of the Catalan Company in the East and Greece, as they are narrated in the aforementioned source, while we will attempt to approach psychologically the main characters, with the valuable aid of contemporary bibliography. What is more, apart from the territorial expansion, the present study will talk about the mercantile expansion of the Crown of Aragon to the eastern Mediterranean. Finally, there will be examined the bilateral relations and perceptions between the Byzantines and the Catalans, we will look for any cultural remnants that the Catalan-Aragonese presence left in Romania, while there will be pointed out some ascertainments regarding the primary source that was used in the present essay.\n\nFor nearly two decades, various articles have reflected on the progressive renewal of political history in the historiography of the Christian kingdoms of Iberia in the late medieval era. Considerable advances have been made, thanks to the dedication of a number of researchers who have taken stock of some of the principal elements of this transformation. Indeed, this evolution has brought renewed attention to the political dimensions of historical analysis, turning the tide of a transformation that had been in motion since the decades of the mid-twentieth century."
