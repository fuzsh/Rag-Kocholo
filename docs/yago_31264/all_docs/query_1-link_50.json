        "text": "In September 1554, Queen Mary stopped menstruating, she gained weight, and was nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the entirety of her court, including her physicians, believed she was pregnant. Parliament passed an Act making Infante Felipe, Regent in the event of Mary’s death in childbirth.\n\nIn the last week of April 1555, Princess Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Infante Felipe may have planned to marry Princess Elizabeth in the event of Mary’s death in childbirth, but in a letter to his brother-in-law Archduke Maximilian of Austria, Infante Felipe expressed uncertainty as to whether Mary was pregnant.\n\nThanksgiving services in the diocese of London were held at the end of April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe. Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant. Susan Clarencieux revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, Antoine de Noailles.\n\nMary continued to exhibit signs of pregnancy until July 1555, when her abdomen receded. Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to “end in wind rather than anything else”. It was most likely a false pregnancy, perhaps induced by Mary’s overwhelming desire to have a child.\n\nIn August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered “God’s punishment” for her having “tolerated heretics” in her realm, Infante Felipe left England to command his armies against France in Flanders. Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. Michieli was touched by the Queen’s grief; he wrote she was “extraordinarily in love” with her husband and disconsolate at his departure.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth remained at court until October, apparently restored to favour. In the absence of any children, Infante Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after his sister-in-law was Queen Mary I of Scotland who was betrothed to the Prince François, the Dauphin of France.\n\nInfante Felipe persuaded his wife that Princess Elizabeth should marry his cousin Prince Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Princess Elizabeth refused to agree and parliamentary consent was unlikely.\n\nWith no fanfare, on January 16, 1556, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (King Carlos I of Spain) abdicated and gave Spain and the Spanish Empire in the Americas to Infante Felipe who became King Felipe II of Spain. Queen Mary also became Queen Consort of Spain.\n\nOn June 27, 1506, the Treaty of Villafáfila was signed between King Fernando II of Aragon and his son-in-law, Archduke Philipp of Austria, with Philipp being proclaimed as King Felipe I of Castile by the Cortes of Valladolid.\n\nYet on the same day King Fernando II drew up secret documents repudiating all the agreements on the grounds of coercion, claiming that he would never otherwise have signed treaties that did ‘such enormous damage to the said most serene Queen, my daughter, and me’.\n\nKing Fernando II actually had no legal position in Castile, with the cortes of Toro recognizing Queen Joanna and her children as heirs. King Fernando II, having left his options for the future open, left Castile and departed for Aragon.\n\nKing Felipe I died that same year he became King on September 25th after being King of Castile for a mere three months. King Felipe I had died suddenly at Burgos, apparently of typhoid fever, although a poisoning (assassination) was widely spoken of at the time, and is what his wife believed to be the cause of Felipe’s death. His wife supposedly refused to allow his body to be buried or part from it for a while.\n\nAfter King Felipe’s untimely death, Castile was in crisis. Queen Joanna was allegedly mentally unstable as previously mentioned, and Queen Joanna’s and King Felipe’s son, Archduke Charles of Austria (Infante Carlos of Spain), the future Emperor Charles V, was only six years old.\n\nFrancisco Jiménez de Cisneros, Archbishop Cisneros was made President of the Council of Regency of the Kingdom of Castile (1506-1508). With Queen Joanna still in confinement from 1509, her father King Fernando II-V took over as the President of the Council of Regency of the Kingdom of Castile (1508–1516).\n\nThe widowed Fernando II made an alliance with France in July 1505 and married Germaine of Foix, cementing the alliance with France.\n\nShe was the granddaughter of his half-sister Queen Eleanor of Navarre and niece of King Louis XII of France. Had Fernando II’s son with Germaine, Infante Juan, Prince of Girona, born on May 3, 1509, survived, “the crown of Aragon would inevitably been separated from Castile” and his grandson Archduke Charles would have been denied the crown of Aragon. But the infante Juan died within hours of his birth and was buried in the convent of Saint Paul in Valladolid, Kingdom of Castile and Leon.\n\nWhen King Fernando II of Aragon died on January 23, 1516, his daughter Joanna inherited the Crown of Aragon, and his grandson Archduke Charles became Governor General (Regent). Nevertheless, the Flemish wished that Archduke Charles assume the royal title, and this was supported by his paternal grandfather, the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and by Pope Leo X.\n\nConsequently, after Fernando II’s funeral on March 14, 1516, Archduke Charles was proclaimed King Carlos I of Castile and of Aragon jointly with his mother. Finally, the Castilian Regent, Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros accepted the fait accompli, and the Castilian and Aragonese Cortes paid homage to him as King Carlos I of Aragon jointly with his mother.\n\nKing Carlos, was to inherit not only the Spanish lands of his maternal grandparents, but the Austrian and Burgundian lands of his paternal family, which would make his heirs the most powerful rulers on the continent and, with the discoveries and conquests in the Americas and elsewhere, of the first truly global empire.\n\nAs the husband of Queen Isabella I of Castile, King Fernando II of Aragon had also been King Fernando V of Castile Jure uxoris from 1475 to 1504.\n\nHe reigned jointly with Queen Isabella over a dynastically unified Spain; together they are known as the Catholic Monarchs. King Fernando II -V of Aragon and Castile is considered the de facto first king of Spain, and was described as such during his reign, even though, legally, Castile and Aragon remained two separate kingdoms and we’re ruled in personal union.\n\nFrederik I (October 7, 1471 – April 10, 1533) was King of Denmark and Norway. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark and Norway, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation.\n\nAs King of Norway, Frederik is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as King of Norway. Therefore, he was styled King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway.\n\nFrederik’s reign began the enduring tradition of calling Kings of Denmark alternatively by the names Christian and Frederick, which has continued up to the reign of the current monarch, Margrethe II.\n\nFrederik was the younger son of the first Danish king of the House of Oldenburg, King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1426–81) and of Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430–95), a Hohenzollern Princess and the daughter of Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg became a Scandinavian Queen by marriage under the Kalmar Union. She was Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden from her marriage to King Christopher III of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 1445 until King Christopher III died in 1448.\n\nQueen Dorothea was given a proposal from King Casimir IV of Poland and Albrecht VI, Archduke of Austria, but she chose to remain in Denmark and marry the newly elected king, Christian I of Denmark.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark and Dorothea of Brandenburg had three children:\n\n1. Johann, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Christina of Saxony.\n\n2. Margaret. She married King James III of Scotland\n\n3. Friedrich I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden\n\nThe dynasty King Christian founded, the House of Oldenburg, remains on the throne of Denmark through the collateral branch, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (also known as Glücksburg). This royal house was on the throne of Norway until 1818, returning there again from 1905, and also on the throne of Sweden during Christian’s reign there and those of his son and grandson, but also 1751–1818.\n\nSoon after the death of his father, the underage Frederik was elected co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in 1482, the other co-duke being his elder brother, King Johann of Denmark. In 1490 at Frederik’s majority, both duchies were divided between the brothers.\n\nIn 1500, he had convinced his brother King Johann to conquer Dithmarschen. A great army was called from not only the duchies, but with additions from all of the Kalmar Union for which his brother briefly was king. In addition, numerous German mercenaries took part. The expedition failed miserably, however, in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, where one-third of all knights of Schleswig and Holstein lost their lives.\n\nReign\n\nWhen his brother, King Johann, died, a group of Jutish nobles had offered Frederik the throne as early as 1513, but he had declined, rightly believing that the majority of the Danish nobility would be loyal to his nephew King Christian II.\n\nIn 1523, King Christian II was forced by disloyal nobles to abdicate as King of Denmark and Norway, and Frederik took the throne of Denmark in 1523 and was elected King of Norway in 1524.\n\nIt is not certain that Frederik ever learned to speak Danish. After becoming king, he continued spending most of his time at Gottorp, a castle and estate in the city of Schleswig.\n\nIn 1524 and 1525, King Frederik had to suppress revolts among the peasants in Agder, Jutland and Scania who demanded the restoration of King Christian II. The high point of the rebellion came in 1525 when Søren Norby, the governor (statholder) of Gotland, invaded Blekinge in an attempt to restore Christian II to power.\n\nHe raised 8000 men who besieged Kärnan (Helsingborgs slott), a castle in Helsingborg. Frederick’s general, Johann Rantzau, moved his army to Scania and defeated the peasants soundly in April and May 1525.\n\nKing Frederik played a central role in the spread of Lutheran teaching throughout Denmark. In his coronation charter, he was made the solemn protector (værner) of Roman Catholicism in Denmark. In that role, he asserted his right to select bishops for the Roman Catholic dioceses in the country.\n\nKing Christian II had been intolerant of Protestant teaching, but King Frederik took a more opportunist approach. For example, he ordered that Lutherans and Roman Catholics share the same churches and encouraged the first publication of the Bible in the Danish language. In 1526, when Lutheran Reformer Hans Tausen was threatened with arrest and trial for heresy, King Frederik appointed him his personal chaplain to give him immunity.\n\nStarting in 1527, King Frederik authorized the closure of Franciscan houses and monasteries in 28 Danish cities. He used the popular anti-establishment feelings that ran against some persons of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and nobility of Denmark as well as keen propaganda to decrease the power of bishops and Roman Catholic nobles.\n\nDuring his reign, King Frederik was skillful enough to prevent all-out warfare between Protestants and Roman Catholics. In 1532, he succeeded in capturing King Christian II who had tried to invade Norway, and to make himself king of the country.\n\nKing Frederik died on April 10, 1533 in Gottorp, at the age of 61, and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. Upon Frederik’s death, tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants rose to a fever pitch which would result in the Count’s Feud (Grevens Fejde).\n\nKing Frederik I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden was succeeded by King Christian III of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Archduchess Isabella of Austria (18 July 1501 – 19 January 1526), also known as Elizabeth, the daughter of Archduke Philipp of Austria, Duke of Burgundy (also King Felipe I of Castile) and his wife Queen Joanna of Castile and the sister of Emperor Charles V. She ruled Denmark as regent in 1520.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nIn 1500 Prince Frederick of Denmark was betrothed to Princess Anna of Brandenburg (1487–1514), the daughter of Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg and Margaret of Thuringia, the daughter of William III, Landgrave of Thuringia and Archduchess Anne of Austria, Duchess of Luxembourg suo jure. Archduchess Anne of Austria, was the eldest daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/King of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the sole descendant of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBecause they were second cousins (Frederik’s mother Dorothea of Brandenburg was the cousin of Anna’s father, Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg) their marriage required a Papal dispensation by Pope Alexander VI.\n\nIn addition, the marriage was not held until April 10, 1502 due to Princess Anna’s youth. In 1500 the year of their betrothal Princess Anna was 13 and Prince Frederik was 29. Two years later Princess Anna was 15 and Prince Frederik was 31 respectively.\n\nThe marriage, held in Stendal, was a double one: on the same day, Anna’s brother Joachim and Frederick’s niece Elisabeth were married.\n\nThe couple had two children:\n\n1. Christian III, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1503 – 1559)\n\n2. Dorothea of Denmark (1504 – 1547), married Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke of Prussia. Prior to her marriage to Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach a marriage was suggested to the English claimant to the throne, Richard de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, who was supported by King François I of France, but without success.\n\nFrederick’s wife Anna died on May 5, 1514, aged 26 years old.\n\nFour years later on October 9, 1518 at Kiel, the 47 year-old Prince Frederik married Sophie of Pomerania (20 years old; 1498–1568), a daughter of Bogislaw “the Great”, Duke of Pomerania and the Polish princess, Anna Jagiellon, the fifth daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nSophie and Frederick had six children:\n\n1. Johann II of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (1521 – 1580)\n\n2. Elizabeth of Denmark (14 October 1524 – 15 October 1586), married:\n\na) Duke Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nb) Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\n3. Adolph of Denmark, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1526 – 1586)\n\n4. Anna of Denmark (1527 – 1535)\n\n5. Dorothea of Denmark (1528 – 1575), married to Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch.\n\n6. Frederik of Denmark (1532 – 1556), Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and Bishop of Schleswig.\n\nMaximilian I (April 17, 1573 – September 27, 1651), occasionally called the Great, a member of the House of Wittelsbach, ruled as Duke of Bavaria from 1597. His reign was marked by the Thirty Years’ War during which he obtained the title of Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire at the 1623 Diet of Regensburg.\n\nBackground\n\nMaximilian I was born in Munich, the eldest son of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine, the second child and eldest daughter of François I, Duke of Lorraine and Christina of Denmark, the youngest surviving daughter of King Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden his wife Archduchess Isabella of Austria, the third child of Archduke Philipp Austria, Duke of Burgundy (King Felipe I of Castile) and Queen Joanna of Castile.\n\nMaximilian’s father, Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria was the son of Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria and Archduchess Anna of Austria, the third of fifteen children of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I (1503–1564) from his marriage with the Jagiellonian Princess Anna of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia (1503–1547).\n\nHe was educated by the Jesuits, and began to take part in the government in 1591. In 1595 he married his cousin, Elisabeth Renata of Lorraine, daughter of Duke Charles III of Lorraine, and his wife Claude of Valois, a French Princess, the second daughter of King Henri II of France and Catherine de’ Medici.\n\nMaximilian became Duke of Bavaria upon his father’s abdication in 1597. After his abdication, the former Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria retired into a monastery where he spent the remainder of his life in contemplation and prayer. He died in 1626 at the Old Schleissheim Palace and was buried at St. Michael’s Church, Munich.\n\nAs the ablest prince of his age Maximilian sought to prevent the Holy Roman Empire from becoming the battleground of Europe, and although a rigid adherent of the Catholic faith, he was not always subservient to the church. Weak in health and feeble in frame, Maximilian had high ambitions both for himself and his duchy, and was tenacious and resourceful in prosecuting his designs.\n\nHaving refused to become a candidate for the imperial throne in 1619, Maximilian was faced with the complications arising from the outbreak of war in Bohemia. After some delay he made a treaty with Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in October 1619, and in return for large concessions placed the forces of the Catholic League at the emperor’s service.\n\nAnxious to curtail the area of the struggle, he made a treaty of neutrality with the Protestant Union, and occupied Upper Austria as security for the expenses of the campaign. On November 8, 1620 his troops under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly defeated the forces of his Wittlesbach relative, Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatine of the Rhine and King of Bohemia at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague. Subsequently Emperor Ferdinand II released Upper Austria as a pawn for Maximilian until 1628.\n\nIn spite of the arrangement with the Union, Tilly then devastated the Rhenish Palatinate, and in February 1623 Maximilian was formally invested with the electoral dignity and became the Prince-Elector of Bavaria, the attendant office of imperial steward, which had been enjoyed since 1356 by the Counts Palatine of the Rhine.\n\nAfter receiving the Upper Palatinate and restoring Upper Austria to Emperor Ferdinand II, Maximilian became leader of the party which sought to bring about Albrecht von Wallenstein’s dismissal from the imperial service.\n\nAt the Diet of Regensburg (1630) Emperor Ferdinand II was compelled to assent to this demand, but the sequel was disastrous both for Bavaria and its ruler. Attempting to remain neutral during the war, Maximilian signed the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau (1631) with the King Louis XIII of France and Navarre, but this proved worthless.\n\nEarly in 1632 King Gustaf II Adolphus of Sweden marched into the duchy and occupied Munich, and Maximilian could only obtain the assistance of the Imperial troops by placing himself under the orders of Wallenstein, now restored to the command of the emperor’s forces.\n\nThe ravages of the Swedes and their French allies induced the elector to enter into negotiations for peace with the Swedes and Cardinal Richelieu of France. He also wooed the Protestants by proposing modifications to the Edict of Restitution of 1629, but these efforts were abortive.\n\nHis first marriage to Elisabeth Renata of Lorraine was childless. A few months after the death of Elisabeth Renata, the 62-year-old Prince-Elector Maximilian married, on July 15, 1635 in Vienna, his 25-year-old niece Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1610-1665), the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and Maximillian’s sister, Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574-1616).\n\nThe main motivation for this swift remarriage was not so much political grounds as the hope of producing a prince to inherit. In contrast to the Prince-Elector’s first wife, Maria Anna was very interested in politics and well instructed about developments.\n\nShe was not bound to the Habsburgs, but rather completely advocated the Bavarian standpoint. Additionally, she conducted lively exchanges of opinion with high officials of the Munich court and took part in meetings of the cabinet.\n\nThe Duke died at Ingolstadt on September 27, 1651. He is buried in St. Michael’s Church, Munich. In 1839 a statue was erected to his memory at Munich by King Ludwig I of Bavaria.\n\nBy his second wife he left two sons, Ferdinand Maria, who succeeded him as Prince-Elector of Bavaria. He modernized the army and introduced Bavaria’s first government code. Besides encouraging agriculture and industry, he also improved building and restoration works on churches and monasteries since the damage caused during the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nand\n\nHis second son, Prince Maximilian Philipp was Duke of Bavaria-Leuchtenberg from 1650 until his death, and regent of Bavaria from 1679 to 1680 during the minority of his nephew Maximilian II, Prince-Elector of Bavaria.\n\nLouis XIII (September 27, 1601 – May 14, 1643) was King of France from 1610 until his death in 1643 and King of Navarre (as Louis II) from 1610 to 1620, when the crown of Navarre was merged with the French crown.\n\nShortly before his ninth birthday, Louis became King of France and Navarre after his father King Henri IV was assassinated. His mother, Marie de’ Medici, acted as regent during his minority.\n\nMismanagement of the kingdom and ceaseless political intrigues by Marie and her Italian favourites led the young king to take power in 1617 by exiling his mother and executing her followers, including Concino Concini, the most influential Italian at the French court.\n\nLouis XIII, taciturn and suspicious, relied heavily on his chief ministers, first Charles d’Albert, duc de Luynes and then Cardinal Richelieu, to govern the Kingdom of France. The King and the Cardinal are remembered for establishing the Académie française, and ending the revolt of the French nobility.\n\nThey systematically destroyed the castles of defiant lords, and denounced the use of private violence (dueling, carrying weapons, and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu had established “the royal monopoly of force” as the ruling doctrine. The king’s reign was also marked by the struggles against the Huguenots and Habsburg Spain.\n\nEarly life, 1601–1610\n\nBorn at the Palace of Fontainebleau, Louis XIII was the eldest child of King Henri IV of France and Navarre and his second wife Marie de’ Medici, the sixth daughter of Francesco I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Archduchess Joanna of Austria.\n\nMarie de’ Medici was a descendant of Lorenzo the Elder –a branch of the Medici family sometimes referred to as the ‘cadet’ branch– through his daughter Lucrezia de’ Medici, and was also a Habsburg through her mother, Archduchess Joanna of Austria, the youngest of 15 children, the youngest daughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nMarie de’ Medici’s paternal grandparents were Queen Joanna of Castile Archduke Philipp of Austria , reigning Duke of Burgundy and as Felipe I, was King of Castile. Her maternal grandparents were King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia and Anna of Foix-Candale.\n\nAs son of the king, he was a Fils de France (“son of France”), and as the eldest son, Dauphin of France. His father, King Henri IV, was the first French king of the House of Bourbon, having succeeded his second cousin, King Henri III (1574–1589), in application of Salic law.\n\nKing Louis XIII’s paternal grandparents were Antoine de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme, and Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre. His maternal grandparents, as mentioned above, were Francesco I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Archduchess Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nKing Louis XIII of France and Navarre ascended the throne in 1610 upon the assassination of his father, and his mother Marie de’ Medici acted as his Regent. Although Louis XIII came of age at thirteen (1614), his mother did not give up her position as Regent until 1617, when he was 16.\n\nMarie maintained most of her husband’s ministers, with the exception of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was unpopular in the country. She mainly relied on Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, Noël Brûlart de Sillery, and Pierre Jeannin for political advice. Marie pursued a moderate policy, confirming the Edict of Nantes.\n\nShe was not, however, able to prevent rebellion by nobles such as Prince Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (1588–1646), second in line to the throne after Marie’s second surviving son Gaston, Duke of Orléans.\n\nCondé squabbled with Marie in 1614, and briefly raised an army, but he found little support in the country, and Marie was able to raise her own army. Nevertheless, Marie agreed to call an Estates General assembly to address Condé’s grievances.\n\nThe assembly of this Estates General was delayed until Louis XIII formally came of age on his thirteenth birthday. Although his coming-of-age formally ended Marie’s Regency, she remained the de facto ruler of France. The Estates General accomplished little, spending its time discussing the relationship of France to the Papacy and the venality of offices, but reaching no resolutions.\n\nFrench nobles launched a rebellion on July 2, 1620, but their forces were easily routed by royal forces at the Battle of Ponts-de-Cé on 7 August 1620. The next year Louis XIII was formally reconciled with his mother.\n\nOn November 24, 1615, Louis XIII married Anne of Austria, the eldest daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and his wife (and first cousin once removed) Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria and thus the paternal granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I.\n\nAnne of Austria held the titles of Infanta of Spain and of Portugal (since her father was king of Portugal as well as Spain) and Archduchess of Austria. Despite her Spanish birth, she was referred to as Anne of Austria because the rulers of Spain belonged to the senior branch of the House of Austria, known later as the House of Habsburg, a designation relatively uncommon before the 19th century.\n\nThis marriage followed a tradition of cementing military and political alliances between the Catholic powers of France and Spain with royal marriages. The tradition went back to the marriage of King Louis VII of the Franks and Infanta Constance of Castile, a daughter of King Alfonso VII of León and Berengaria of Barcelona\n\nThe marriage was only briefly happy, and the King’s duties often kept them apart. After 23 years of marriage and four stillbirths, Anne finally gave birth to a son on September 5, 1638, the future Louis XIV.\n\nMany people regarded this birth as a miracle and, in show of gratitude to God for the long-awaited birth of an heir, his parents named him Louis-Dieudonné (“God-given”). As another sign of gratitude, according to several interpretations, seven months before his birth, France was dedicated by Louis XIII to the Virgin Mary, who, many believed, had interceded for the perceived miracle.\n\nBut the text of the dedication does not mention the royal pregnancy and birth as one of its reasons, and Louis XIII himself is said to have expressed his scepticism with regard to the miracle after his son’s birth.\n\nIn gratitude for having successfully given birth, the queen founded the Benedictine abbey of the Val-de-Grâce, for which Louis XIV laid the cornerstone of its church, an early masterpiece of French Baroque architecture.\n\nLouis XIII was unwell during the winter of 1642–1643. He managed a few hunting trips to Versailles, but by the middle of February was mostly bedridden. From contemporary descriptions, modern historians have surmised that he suffered from extrapulmonary tuberculosis. On April 13, his chief physician informed him that his illness would be fatal. He died in Paris on May 14, 1643, the 33rd anniversary of his father’s death.\n\nHis five year-old son succeeded him as King Louis XIV of France and Navarre with his mother, Queen Anne acting as Regent.\n\nOn Sunday 26 March 1854, around 4:00 p.m, Charles left the Riserva Palace to take a walk on the streets of Parma, as he used to do every afternoon. He was accompanied only by an aide-de-camp, Count Bacinetti. During his walk, he saw his wife, Duchess Louise, who was sitting in a carriage, listening to an open-air concert in a square of Parma. They waved to each other politely.\n\nAt 5:45 the Duke was returning to his palace; while he was passing by the Church of Santa Lucia, he stopped for a moment to ask about the identity of a pretty girl whom he had just seen in an upper window across the street. He was making the inquiry and saluting two soldiers, who walked by him, when he was attacked from behind by two men who were trailing him.\n\nOne of them knocked the Duke violently and stabbed him deep in the stomach with a triangular blade. Everything happened so fast that Charles initially did not realize what had just transpired and seconds later gasping he said, “My God, I’m done for. They have stabbed me”. In the confusion, the two assailants escaped running in opposite directions and mixing with the crowd.\n\nThe wounded Duke fell on the ground in a pool of blood with the blade still in his stomach. He was lifted up, and held by his arms and legs. He was carried back to the palace. He made no complaints as his doctors treated his wound, which was deep. He asked if they thought his life was in danger.\n\nThey lied assuring him that it was not and he passed out. In moments of lucidity, the Duke, realizing the seriousness of his condition repeated: “I am preparing myself for a long journey”. The Duke received the last rites and was able to see his wife and their children for a last time. After atrocious suffering, which he endured bravely, he died the following evening, March 27 at 5:30 p.m. He was thirty-one years old.\n\nCharles’s body was buried in the Cappella della Macchia near Viareggio. His heart was placed in an urn in the crypt of the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata in Parma.\n\nWhen her husband was murdered Louise Marie Thèrésa served as regent for their young son, the new duke, Robert I. Like the other rulers of the Central Italian states, she and her son were ousted during the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, and they retired to Austrian protection in Venice.\n\nVarious schemes following the war, either for her and her son’s restoration in Parma, or territorial swaps which might leave them ruling over Tuscany, Modena, or the Romagna, came to nothing, as the whole of central Italy was annexed by Piedmont in March 1860. Louise Marie Thèrésa lived out the remainder of her life in exile.\n\nDeath\n\nLouise died on February 1, 1864, aged 44, in the Palazzo Giustinian in Venice. She was buried in her grandfather Charles X’s crypt at the Franciscan monastery Kostanjevica in Görz, Austria (now Nova Gorica, Slovenia).\n\nOther members of the French Royal Family buried there include her brother Henri, Count of Chambord, her aunt Marie Thérèse of France, and her uncle Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême.\n\nLouise Marie Thèrésa had been described at that time as a pretty blonde, fair complexioned with golden hair and blue eyes, but not very tall. She was reserved, cold, insensitive and lacked charm.\n\nHer son, Robert I, Duke of Parma, (July 9, 1848 – November 16, 1907): married his cousin Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies on April 5, 1869. She was the daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and his wife, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, the eldest daughter of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Luisa of Spain. Her maternal grandparents were Friedrich Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg and his wife Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg.\n\nRobert I, Duke of Parma, and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies had twelve children.\n\nDuke Robert remarried Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal on October 1884, daughter of the deposed King Miguel I of Portugal and his wife, Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Maria Antonia was his second cousin once removed, as her paternal grandmother (Charlotte of Spain) and Robert’s paternal great-grandmother (Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain) were siblings, both being children of Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma.\n\nDuke Robert and Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal also had twelve children.\n\nPrincess Zita of Bourbon-Parma was the seventeenth child of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his second wife, Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, and thus a granddaughter of Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa d’Artois, Duchess of Parma.\n\nPrincess Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911. Charles became heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary in 1914 after the assassination of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the elderly emperor’s death.\n\nLouise Marie Thérèse d’Artois (September 21, 1819 – February 1, 1864) was a duchess and later a regent of Parma. She served as regent of Parma during the minority of her son from 1854 until 1859.\n\nBorn on September 21, 1819 in the Élysée Palace, in Paris, she was the first surviving child of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry and his young wife Carolina of Naples and Sicily, later Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\nCharles Ferdinand d’Artois, Duke of Berry (January 24, 1778 – February 14, 1820) was the third child and younger son of King Charles X of France and Navarre, (whom he predeceased) by his wife Maria Theresa of Savoy, daughter of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and his wife Infanta Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Felipe V of Spain and his second wife Elisabeth Farnese. She was the mother of the last three mainline Kings of Sardinia\n\nCaroline of Naples and Sicily, later Bourbon-Two Sicilies, was born at Caserta Palace in Naples. She was the eldest child of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies and his first wife, Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, the tenth child and third daughter of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of King Carlos III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nCaroline of Naples and Sicily’s parents were double first cousins.\n\nAt the time of her birth, Louise Marie Thérèse d’Artois’ great-uncle Louis XVIII, was the reigning king of France and Navarre, but he was childless and already in declining health. Louise’s grandfather, the King’s brother, Prince Charles Philippe de Bourbon, Count d’Artois (Charles X) was the heir to the French crown.\n\nCharles Philippe de Bourbon, Count d’Artois only had two sons. The eldest, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême had no children of his own from his marriage to Madame Royale, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de Bourbon, the eldest child of King Louis XVI and Archduchess Marie Antoinette of Austria. Therefore, the continuity of the dynasty rested solely on the youngest son, Charles-Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, Louise’s father.\n\nKnown from her birth as Mademoiselle d’Artois, Louise did not have the chance to get to know her father. She was only five months old when the Duke of Berry was assassinated while leaving the old opera of Paris by Louis Pierre Louvel, a Bonapartist whose goal was the “extinction of the house of Bourbon”.\n\nLouise was then the only child of the main branch of the royal dynasty of Bourbon descendants of Louis XV. The lack of male heirs raised the prospect of the throne passing to the Duke of Orléans and his heirs, which horrified the more conservative ultras.\n\nParliament debated the abolition of the Salic law, which excluded females from the succession and was long held inviolable. However, the widowed Duchess of Berry was found to be pregnant and on September 29, 1820 gave birth to a son, Louise’s only sibling, the miracle boy Henri d’Artois (1820-1883). He received then the title of Duke of Bordeaux, but would later adopt the title Count of Chambord.\n\nLouise would remember her great-uncle King Louis XVIII as an invalid who could not move from his chair. He suffered from gangrene and died in 1824, five days before Louise’s fifth birthday. During the reign of King Charles X, as a granddaughter of the French king, Louise had the title petite-fille de France ( granddaughter of France ).\n\nHer grandfather’s reign (1824-1830) ended abruptly as his unpopular policies launched the July Revolution. On August 2, 1830, King Charles X and his son the Dauphin Prince Louis Antoine de Bourbon abdicated their rights to the throne. Though technically Prince Louis Antoine was King Louis XIX for about 30 minutes until he decided to abdicate his rights to the throne.\n\nAlthough King Charles X had intended that his grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux, would take the throne as King Henri V, the politicians who composed the provisional government instead placed on the throne a distant cousin, Louis Philippe of the cadet House of Orléans -a descendant of Louis XIV’s only brother, Prince Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, who agreed to rule as a constitutional monarch.\n\nThis period became known as the July Monarchy. Supporters of the exiled senior line of the Bourbon dynasty became known as Legitimists. On August 16, 1830, the royal family went into exile in England.\n\nArchduchess Mary of Austria (September 15, 1505 – October 18, 1558), also known as Mary of Hungary, was Queen of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia as the wife of King Louis II of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, and was later governor of the Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nArchduchess Mary of Austria was the fifth child of King Felipe I of Castile and Queen Joanna of Castile. King Felipe was born a member of the House of Habsburg as Archduke Philipp of Austria the son of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife Mary, Duchess of Burgundy. Archduke Philipp succeeded his mother as reigning Duke of Burgundy.\n\nArchduchess Mary’s mother, Queen Joanna of Castile, was the daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon. Infanta Joanna was married by arrangement to the Austrian Archduke Philipp the Handsome on October 20, 1496.\n\nFollowing the deaths of her elder brother Infante Juan of Castile, elder sister Infanta Isabella, and nephew Infante Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal, between 1497 and 1500, Infanta Joanna became the heir presumptive to the crowns of Castile and Aragon. When her mother died in 1504, she became Queen Regnant of Castile.\n\nHer father, King Fernando II of Aragon, proclaimed himself governor and administrator of Castile. King Fernando II of Aragon was also King of Castile from 1475 to 1504 (as King Fernando V). He reigned jointly with Isabella over a dynastically unified Spain; together they are known as the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nKing Fernando II-V of Castile and Aragon is considered the de facto first king of Spain, and was described as such during his reign, even though, legally, Castile and Aragon remained two separate kingdoms until they were formally united by the Nueva Planta decrees issued between 1707 and 1716.\n\nQueen Joanna’s siblings were Infanta Isabella, Queen of Portugal; husband of King Manuel I of Portugal, Infante Juan, Prince of Asturias; Infanta Maria, Queen of Portugal; the second wife of King Manuel I of Portugal,and Infanta Catherine, Queen of England and Lady of Ireland; first wife of King Henry VIII of England and Ireland.\n\nArchduchess Mary’s birth was very difficult; the Queen’s life was in danger and it took her a month to recover. On September 20, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her paternal grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, who had died in 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nOn March 17, 1506, Emperor Maximilian I promised to marry her to Prince Louis of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia the first son of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and his third wife, Anne of Foix-Candale.\n\nAt the same time, the two monarchs decided that Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (future Emperor Ferdinand I) a brother of Archduchess Mary would marry Vladislaus’ daughter Princess Anne as stipulated by the First Congress of Vienna in 1515. At the time Archduke Ferdinand was a governor on behalf of his brother Emperor Charles V.\n\nAfter King Vladislaus II’s death in 1516, the minor King Louis II ascended to the throne of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. King Louis II was adopted by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in 1515. When Maximilian I died in 1519, Louis’s cousin Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, became his legal guardian.\n\nAlso in 1515 Archduchess Mary married King Louis II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. Their marriage was happy but short and childless. Upon her husband’s death following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Queen Mary governed Hungary as regent in the name of the new king, her brother, Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria.\n\nAs Louis II’s brother-in-law Louis II, Ferdinand inherited and ruled as King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia (1526–1564). These Kingdoms formed a major part of the Habsburgs hereditary lands outside of the Holy Roman Empire and along with the Archduchy of Austria would form the Austrian Empire in 1804.\n\nFollowing the death of their aunt, Archduchess Margaret in 1530, Mary was asked by her eldest brother, Emperor Charles V, to assume the governance of the Netherlands. Archduchess Margaret was the second child and only daughter of Hoy Roman Emperor Maximilian and Duchess Mary of Burgundy.\n\nMargaret was named after her step-grandmother, Margaret of York, (1446 – 1503) was by marriage Duchess of Burgundy as the third wife of Charles the Bold. She was a daughter of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the sister of two kings of England, Edward IV and Richard III.\n\nEmperor Charles V also asked Queen Mary to take over the guardianship over his nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark, daughter’s of King Christian II of Denmark and Norway and Archduchess Isabella of Austria, sister of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.\n\nIn 1532, Francesco II Sforza, Duke of Milan, proposed a marriage with Princess Christina of Denmark and Norway, who was then 11 years old. Charles agreed to the marriage and allowed its immediate consummation. Mary determinedly opposed this decision, explaining to Emperor Charles that Christina was too young for consummation of the marriage.\n\nEmperor Charles ignored her, but she nevertheless managed to delay the marriage. She first told the Milanese envoy that her niece was ill and then took her to another part of the Netherlands for “serious affairs”. Christina was finally married on September 28, 1532, but Mary managed to postpone her departure until March 11, 1533.\n\nPrincess Christina and Francesco had no children. Francesco II Sforza died in October 1535, leaving her widowed when she was thirteen. On July 10, 1541, Christina married François, Duke of Lorraine in Brussels. François had been betrothed to Anne of Cleves, who became the fourth wife of Henry VIII of England.\n\nAs governor of the Netherlands, Mary faced riots and a difficult relationship with the Emperor. Throughout her tenure she continuously attempted to ensure peace between the Emperor and the King François I of France.\n\nAlthough she never enjoyed governing and asked for permission to resign several times, the Queen succeeded in creating a unity between the provinces, as well as in securing for them a measure of independence from both France and the Holy Roman Empire. After her final resignation, the very frail Queen moved to Castile, where she died.\n\nArchduchess Maria Anna of Austria (September 7, 1683 – August 14, 1754) was Queen of Portugal as the wife of King João V of Portugal. She served as the regent of Portugal from 1742 until 1750 during the illness of her husband. She was born an Archduchess of Austria.\n\nBorn Maria Anna Josepha Antonia Regina, she was the eleventh child and seventh daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor (1640–1705) by his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg (1655–1720), the oldest of 17 children born from Philipp Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and Duke of Jülich-Berg and his second wife, Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nOn her father’s side her grandparents were Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and his first wife, Magdalene of Bavaria. On her mother’s side, her grandparents were Georg II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Sophia Eleonore of Saxony.\n\nTwo of her brothers, Archduke Joseph and Archduke Charles later became emperors, Joseph I and Charles VI (the last male Habsburg). Through Emperor Charles VI she was an aunt of Empress Maria Theresa, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and Archduchess of Austria and the only woman to ever rule the Habsburg dominions in her own right.\n\nDuring his life, King Pedro II had worked a long time to secure Infante João a marriage with an Austrian archduchess in order to guarantee Portugal’s alliance with the Habsburgs. King Pedro II died in his sleep on December 9, 1706 and Infante João succeeded as King João V of Portugal.\n\nKing JoãoV continued these negotiations and finally succeeded in negotiating a deal. On 27 June 1707, Fernão Teles da Silva, Count of Vilar Maior, signed a marriage contract with Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I that made official a match between King João V and the emperor’s sister, the Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. The contract also set the archduchess’s dowry at 100,000 crowns, a vast sum for the day.\n\nThe armada that Portugal sent to escort Maria Anna from the Low Countries to Lisbon arrived in the Tagus river estuary on October 26, 1708. On October 27, 1708, Archduchess Maria Anna married King João V of Portugal (1689–1750) to seal the alliance between the two countries against France and Spain during the War of Spanish Succession\n\nThe flagship, in which Archduchess Maria Anna travelled, berthed at the docks of the private garden of Ribeira Palace, where Infante João and a party of the kingdom’s richest and most powerful nobles met the new queen for the first time. The marriage celebrations lasted until December 27; they were sumptuous and very costly.\n\nBy late 1710, João and Maria Anna had not produced an heir to the throne. It had been two years since the couple had been married, and the court was starting to question the future of the House of Braganza. In early 1711, the King met with Franciscan Cardinal Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde, High Inquisitor of the Portuguese Inquisition, who told him that if he promised God to build a Franciscan convent in Mafra, God would deliver his long desired heir.\n\nAccordingly, King João promised such a convent if Maria Anna became pregnant before the end of 1711. King João’s wish would come true later that year when Maria Anna gave birth to a daughter, Infanta Maria Barbara, on December 4, 1711.\n\nJoão and Maria Anna had a successful marriage, but lived largely separate lives. Maria Anna devoted herself to preserving the decorum of the royal court and her own religious interests, while João concerned himself with whatever pleased him at the moment.\n\nKing João kept many mistresses throughout his royal career, including Filipa de Noronha, Paula de Odivelas, Luísa Inês Antónia Machado Monteiro, Madalena Máxima de Miranda, Inácia Rosa de Távora, and Luísa Clara de Portugal.\n\nAs Queen, Maria Anna reformed the court and its customs to follow the traditions and customs of the traditional Queens of Portugal. Her greatest influence on the court and Portuguese nobility as a whole was the increase of segregation between men and women, as well as between servants and masters. Like João, Maria Anna had an exuberant taste, best shown in her famous parties: she would invite the nobility from all over the country and hold a magnificent festival, often lasting several days.\n\nRegency\n\nIn 1742 Maria Anna became regent after her husband had suffered a stroke and became partially paralyzed. When João V died on July 31, 1750, their eldest son José I of Portugal inherited the throne.\n\nShe died in the Palace of Belém on August 14, 1754. After her death, she was buried in Lisbon, but her heart was brought to Vienna and buried there in the imperial crypt.\n\nIssue\n\nMaria Anna and King João V had six children with her husband, four of whom survived infancy.\n\n1. Infanta Barbara of Portugal (1711 – 1758), became Queen of Spain as the wife of Fernando VI of Spain (1713–1759).\n\n2. Infante Pedro of Portugal (1712 – 1714), Prince of Brazil, died in infancy.\n\n3. José I, King of Portugal (1714 – 1777), married Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain (1718–1781).\n\n4. Infante Carlos of Portugal (1716 – 1736), died before his parents.\n\n5. Pedro III, King of Portugal (1717 – 1786), married his niece Maria I, Queen (regnant) of Portugal (1734–1816).\n\n6. Infante Alexandre of Portugal (1723 – 1728), died young.\n\nLouis XIV (September 5, 1638 – September 1, 1715), also known as Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi Soleil), was King of France and Navarre from 1643 until his death in 1715. His verified reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any sovereign. King Louis XIV of France and Navarre was emblematic of the Age of Absolutism in Europe.\n\nLouis XIV was born on September 5, 1638 in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, to King Louis XIII of France and Navarre and Infanta Anne of Austria the eldest daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and his wife Archduchess Margaret of Austria, herself the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria and thus the paternal granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I.\n\nAnne of Austria held the titles of Infanta of Spain and of Portugal (since her father was king of Portugal as well as Spain) and Archduchess of Austria. Despite her Spanish birth, she was referred to as Anne of Austria because the rulers of Spain belonged to the senior branch of the House of Austria, known later as the House of Habsburg, a designation relatively uncommon before the 19th century.\n\nWhy Anne remains the only Infanta of Spain known historically as being “of Austria” in modern usage, while other Spanish Infantas of the House of Habsburg are known as being “of Spain” is unknown. For example, King Louis XIV’s first wife, Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain, was known as Maria Theresa of Austria prior to her marriage to the King.\n\nThe future King Louis XIV was named Louis Dieudonné (Louis the God-given) and bore the traditional title of French heirs apparent: Dauphin. At the time of his birth, his parents had been married for 23 years. His mother had experienced four stillbirths between 1619 and 1631. Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God.\n\nQueen Anne had a series of miscarriages which disenchanted the king and served to chill their relations. On March 14, 1622, while playing with her ladies, Anne fell on a staircase and suffered her second stillbirth. Louis blamed her for the incident and was angry with Marie de Rohan, now the Dowager Duchess of Luynes, for having encouraged the queen in what was seen as negligence. Henceforth, the king had less tolerance for the influence that the duchess had over Anne, and the situation deteriorated after the death of her husband Luynes in December 1621.\n\nIn 1635, France declared war on Spain, placing Queen Anne in an untenable position. Her secret correspondence with her brother King Felipe IV of Spain was not the only communication she had with the Spanish. She also corresponded with the Spanish ambassador Mirabel and the governor of the Spanish Netherlands. .\n\nOn August 11, 1637, Anne came under so much suspicion that Cardinal Richelieu issued an investigation. Her courier La Porte as well as the abbess of Anne’s favorite convent Val-de-Grâce (where Anne had written many of her secret letters) were questioned and admitted to having participated in channeling the queen’s secret correspondence.\n\nAnne initially swore on the Holy Sacrament that she had participated in no illegal correspondence, but finally admitted her guilt on August 15. On August 17, Queen Anne was forced to sign covenants regarding her correspondence, which was henceforth open to inspection; she was further banned from visiting convents without permission and was never to be left alone but was always to be in the presence of one of her ladies-in-waiting.\n\nDespite a climate of distrust, the Queen became pregnant once more, a circumstance that contemporary gossip attributed to a single stormy night that prevented King Louis XIII from travelling to Saint-Maur and obliged him to spend the night with Queen Anne. Louis XIV was born on September 5, 1638, an event that secured the Bourbon line. At this time, Anne was 37. The official newspaper Gazette de France called the birth “a marvel when it was least expected”.\n\nThe birth of a living son failed to re-establish confidence between the royal couple. However, she conceived again fifteen months later. At Saint-Germain-en-Laye on September 21, 1640, Anne gave birth to her second son, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, who later founded the modern House of Orléans. Both of her children were placed under the supervision of the royal governess Françoise de Lansac, who was disliked by Anne and loyal to the king and the cardinal.\n\nLouis XIV’s relationship with his mother was uncommonly affectionate for the time. Contemporaries and eyewitnesses claimed that the Queen would spend all her time with Louis. Both were greatly interested in food and theatre, and it is highly likely that Louis developed these interests through his close relationship with his mother."
