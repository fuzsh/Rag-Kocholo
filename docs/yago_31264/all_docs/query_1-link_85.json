Su padre, que acabaría repudiando a la reina, sólo llegó a concebirlo mediante engaño de algunos nobles y eclesiásticos que temían por la falta de un sucesor, y la colaboración de María, haciendo creer a Pedro que se acostaba con una de sus amantes. Estas circunstancias produjeron el rechazo de Pedro II hacia el pequeño Jaime, a quien no conoció sino a los dos años de su nacimiento. A esa edad, el rey hizo un pacto matrimonial para entregar a su hijo Jaime a la tutela de Simón, Señor de Montfort, para casarlo con la hija de éste, Amicia, para lo cual el niño iba a ser recluido en el castillo de Carcasona hasta los 18 años.\n\nA la muerte de su padre, durante la cruzada albigense, en la batalla de Muret (1213), Simón de Montfort se resistió a entregar a Jaime a los aragoneses hasta después de un año de reclamaciones y sólo por mandato del papa Inocencio III. Durante su minoría de edad, estuvo bajo la tutela de los caballeros templarios en el castillo de Monzón, habiendo sido encomendado a Guillém de Mont-Rodon, junto con su primo de la misma edad, el Conde de Provenza Ramón Berenguer V. Mientras, actuaba como regente del reino el conde Sancho Raimúndez, hijo de Petronila de Aragón y Ramón Berenguer IV y tío abuelo de Jaime. Heredó el señorío de Montpellier a la muerte de su madre (1213).\n\nHuérfano de padre y madre, tenía unos 6 años cuando fue jurado en las Cortes de Lérida de 1214. En septiembre de 1218 se celebraron por primera vez en Lérida unas Cortes generales de aragoneses y catalanes, en las cuales fue declarado mayor de edad.\n\nEn febrero de 1221 se desposó con Leonor de Castilla, hermana de Doña Berenguela y tía de Fernando III de Castilla. Anulado su primer casamiento por razón de parentesco, contrajo segundo matrimonio con la princesa Violante (8 de septiembre de 1235), hija de Andrés II, rey de Hungría. Por el testamento de su primo Nuño Sánchez, heredó los condados de Rosellón y Cerdaña y el vizcondado de Fenolledas en Francia (1241).\n\nDe su primera mujer, Leonor, tuvo a don Alfonso (1229-1260). Se casó con Constanza de Moncada.\n\nDe la segunda, Violante de Hungría, tuvo a:\n\nDon Pedro (futuro Pedro III el Grande), que le sucedió en los reinos de Aragón, Valencia y en los condados catalanes.\n\nDon Jaime (futuro Jaime II de Mallorca), que heredó el reino de Mallorca, que comprendía las islas Baleares —Mallorca, Menorca (todavía bajo el poder de un soberano musulmán aunque tributaria desde 1231), Ibiza y Formentera—, los condados del Rosellón y la Cerdaña y los territorios que el Conquistador conservaba en Occitania (el señorío de Montpellier, el vizcondado de Carlades, en Auvernia, y la baronía de Omelades, contigua a Montpellier).\n\nDon Fernando (1245-1250), que murió niño.\n\nDon Sancho (1250-1275), arcediano de Belchite, abad de Valladolid y arzobispo de Toledo, falleció prisionero de los moros granadinos.\n\nDoña Violante de Aragón (1236-1301), mujer de Alfonso X el Sabio.\n\nDoña Constanza (1239-1269), esposa del infante castellano Don Manuel, hermano de Alfonso X el Sabio.\n\nDoña Sancha, que se hizo monja y murió en Jerusalén.\n\nDoña María (1248-1267), religiosa también.\n\nDoña Isabel (1247-1271), esposa de Felipe III el Atrevido, hijo de San Luis de Francia.\n\nJames I the Conqueror (Catalan: Jaume el Conqueridor, Aragonese: Chaime lo Conqueridor, Spanish: Jaime el Conquistador, Occitan: Jacme; 2 February 1208 – 27 July 1276) was the King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier from 1213 to 1276. His long reign saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon on all sides: into Valencia to the south, Languedoc to the north, and the Balearic Islands to the east. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the Principality of Catalonia from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia.\n\nAs a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the Spanish kings. James compiled the Libre del Consulat de Mar,[1] which governed maritime trade and helped establish Catalan supremacy in the western Mediterranean. He made Catalan the official language of his domains[2] and sponsored Catalan literature, even a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the Llibre dels fets.\n\nJames was born at Montpellier as the only child of Peter II and Mary, heiress of William VIII of Montpellier and Eudokia Komnene. As a child, James was a pawn in the power politics of Provence, where his father was engaged in struggles with the Cathar heretics of Albi on one side and the Albigensian Crusaders led by Simon IV de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who were trying to exterminate them on the other. Peter endeavoured to placate the northern crusaders by arranging a marriage between his son James and Simon's daughter. He entrusted the boy to be educated in Montfort's care in 1211, but was soon forced to take up arms against him, dying at the Battle of Muret on 12 September 1213. Montfort would willingly have used James as a means of extending his own power had not the Aragonese and Catalans appealed to Pope Innocent III, who insisted that Montfort surrender him. James was handed over, at Carcassonne, in May or June 1214, to the papal legate Peter of Benevento.\n\nJames was then sent to Monzón, where he was entrusted to the care of William of Montredon, the head of the Knights Templar in Spain and Provence; the regency meanwhile fell to his great uncle Sancho, Count of Roussillon, and his son, the king's cousin, Nuño. The kingdom was given over to confusion until, in 1217, the Templars and some of the more loyal nobles brought the young king to Zaragoza.[3]\n\nIn 1221, he was married to Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England. The next six years of his reign were full of rebellions on the part of the nobles. By the Peace of Alcalá of 31 March 1227, the nobles and the king came to terms.[4]\n\nJames first married, in 1221, Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England. Though he later had the marriage annulled, his one son by her was declared legitimate:\n\nAlfonso (1229–1260), married Constance of Montcada, Countess of Bigorre In 1235,\n\nJames remarried to Yolanda, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary by his second wife Yolande de Courtenay. She bore him numerous children:\n\nYolanda, also known as Violant, (1236–1301), married Alfonso X of Castile Constance (1239–1269), married Juan Manuel, Lord of Villena, son of Ferdinand III Peter (1240–1285), successor in Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia James (1243–1311), successor in Balearics and Languedoc Ferdinand (1245–1250) Sancha (1246–1251) Isabella (1247–1271), married Philip III of France Mary (1248–1267), nun Sancho, Archbishop of Toledo (1250–1279) Eleanor (born 1251, died young)\n\nJames married thirdly Teresa Gil de Vidaure, but only by a private document, and left her when she developed leprosy.\n\nJames (c.1255–1285), lord of Xèrica Peter (1259–1318), lord of Ayerbe\n\nJames also had several lovers, both during and after his marriages, and a few bore him illegitimate sons.\n\nBy Blanca d'Antillón:\n\nFerran Sanchis (or Fernando Sánchez; 1240–1275), baron of Castro By Berenguela Fernández:\n\nPedro Fernández, baron of Híjar By Elvira Sarroca:\n\nJaume Sarroca (born 1248), Archbishop of Huesca\n\nJaime I, Rey de Aragón ▼1 M, #106799, b. 1205, d. 25 July 1276 Last Edited=5 May 2009\n\nJaime I, Rey de Aragón was born in 1205. ▼1 He was the son of Pedro II, Rey de Aragón and Marie de Montpelier. ▼2 He married, firstly, Eleanor de Castilla, daughter of Alfonso VIII, Rey de Castilla and Eleanor Plantagenet, in 1221. ▼2 He and Eleanor de Castilla were divorced in 1229. ▼1 He married, secondly, Yolante Arpád, daughter of Andreas II Arpád, King of Hungary and Yolande de Courtney, on 8 September 1235.

He made Catalan the official language of his domains[2] and sponsored Catalan literature, even a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the Llibre dels fets.\n\nEarly life and reign until majority\n\nJames was born at Montpellier as the only son of Peter II and Mary, heiress of William VIII of Montpellier and Eudokia Komnene. As a child, James was a pawn in the power politics of Provence, where his father was engaged in struggles helping the Cathar heretics of Albi against the Albigensian Crusaders led by Simon IV de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who were trying to exterminate them. Peter endeavoured to placate the northern crusaders by arranging a marriage between his son James and Simon's daughter. He entrusted the boy to be educated in Montfort's care in 1211, but was soon forced to take up arms against him, dying at the Battle of Muret on 12 September 1213. Montfort would willingly have used James as a means of extending his own power had not the Aragonese and Catalans appealed to Pope Innocent III, who insisted that Montfort surrender him. James was handed over, at Carcassonne, in May or June 1214, to the papal legate Peter of Benevento. James was then sent to Monzón, where he was entrusted to the care of William of Montredon, the head of the Knights Templar in Spain and Provence; the regency meanwhile fell to his great uncle Sancho, Count of Roussillon, and his son, the king's cousin, Nuño. The kingdom was given over to confusion until, in 1217, the Templars and some of the more loyal nobles brought the young king to Zaragoza.[3] In 1221, he was married to Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England. The next six years of his reign were full of rebellions on the part of the nobles. By the Peace of Alcalá of 31 March 1227, the nobles and the king came to terms.[4] [edit]Acquisition of Urgell\n\nIn 1228, James faced the sternest opposition from a vassal yet. Guerau de Cabrera had occupied the County of Urgell in opposition to Aurembiax, the heiress of Ermengol VIII, who had died without sons in 1208. While Aurembiax' mother, Elvira, had made herself a protegée of James' father, on her death (1220), Guerao had occupied the county and displaced Aurembiax, claiming that a woman could not inherit. James intervened on behalf of Aurembiax, whom he owed protection. He bought Guerau off and allowed Aurembiax to reclaim her territory, which she did at Lleida, probably also becoming one of James' earliest mistresses.[5] She surrendered Lleida to James and agreed to hold Urgell in fief from him. On her death in 1231, James exchanged the Balearic Islands for Urgell with her widower, Peter of Portugal.\n\nRelations with France and Navarre\n\nFrom 1230 to 1232, James negotiated with Sancho VII of Navarre, who desired his help against his nephew and closest living male relative, Theobald IV of Champagne. James and Sancho negotiated a treaty whereby James would inherit Navarre on the old Sancho's death, but when this did occur, the Navarrese nobless instead elevated Theobald to the throne (1234), and James disputed it. Pope Gregory IX was required to intervene.[6] In the end, James accepted Theobald's succession. James endeavoured to form a state straddling the Pyrenees, to counterbalance the power of France north of the Loire. As with the much earlier Visigothic attempt, this policy was victim to physical, cultural, and political obstacles. As in the case of Navarre, he was too wise to launch into perilous adventures. By the Treaty of Corbeil, signed in May 1258, he frankly withdrew from conflict with Louis IX of France and was content with the recognition of his position, and the surrender of antiquated and illusory French claims to the overlordship of Catalonia. [edit]Reconquista\n\nAfter his false start at uniting Aragon with the Kingdom of Navarre through a scheme of mutual adoption, James turned to the south and the Mediterranean Sea, where he conquered the Balearic Islands (Majorca 1229; Minorca 1232; Ibiza 1235) and where Valencia capitulated 28 September 1238. During his remaining two decades after Corbeil, James warred with the Moors in Murcia, on behalf of his son-in-law Alfonso X of Castile. On 26 March 1244, the two monarchs signed the Treaty of Almizra to determine the zones of their expansion into Andalusia so as to prevent squabbling between them. Specifically, it defined the borders of the newly-created Kingdom of Valencia. James signed it on that date, but Alfonso did not affirm it until much later. According to the treaty, all lands south of a line from Biar to Villajoyosa through Busot were reserved for Castile. [edit]Crusade of 1269\n\nThe \"khan of Tartary\" (actually the Ilkhan) Abaqa corresponded with James in early 1267, inviting him to join forces with the Mongols and go on Crusade.[7] James sent an ambassador to Abaqa in the person of Jayme Alaric de Perpignan, who returned with a Mongol embassy in 1269.[8] Pope Clement IV tried to dissuade James from Crusading, regarding his moral character as sub-par, and Alfonso X did the same. Nonetheless, James, who was then campaigning in Murcia, made peace with Mohammed I ibn Nasr, the Sultan of Granada, and set about collecting funds for a Crusade. After organising the government for his absence and assembling a fleet at Barcelona in September 1269, he was ready to sail east. The troubadour Olivier lo Templier composed a song praising the voyage and hoping for its success. A storm, however, drove him off course and he landed at Aigues-Mortes. According the the continuator of William of Tyre, he returned via Montpellier por l'amor de sa dame Berenguiere (\"for the love his lady Berengaria\") and abandoned any further effort at a Crusade. I James' bastard sons Pedro Fernández and Fernán Sánchez, who had been given command of part of the fleet, did continue on their way to Acre, where they arrived in December. They found that Baibars, the Mameluke sultan of Egypt, had broken his truce with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and was making a demonstration of his military power in front of Acre. During the demonstration, Egyptian troops hidden in the bushes ambushed a returning Frankish force which had been in Galilee. James' sons, initially eager for a fight, changed their minds after this spectacle and returned home via Sicily, where Fernán Sánchez was knighted by Charles of Anjou.\n\nPatronage of art, learning, and literature\n\nJames built and consecrated the Cathedral of Lleida, which was constructed in a style transitional between Romanesque and Gothic with little influence from Moorish styles.[9] James was a patron of the University of Montpellier, which owed much of its development to his impetus.[10] He also founded a studium at Valencia in 1245 and received privileges for it from Pope Innocent IV, but it did not develop as splendidly.[11] In 1263, James presided over a debate in Barcelona between the Jewish rabbi Nahmanides and Pablo Christiani, a prominent converso. James was the first great sponsor and patron of vernacular Catalan literature. Indeed, he may himself be called \"the first of the Catalan prose writers.\"[12] James wrote or dictated at various stages a chronicle of his own life, Llibre dels fets in Catalan, which is the first self-chronicle of a Christian king. As well as a fine example of autobiography the \"Book of Deeds\" expresses concepts of the power and purpose of monarchy; examples of loyalty and treachery in the feudal order; the growth of national sentiment based on homeland, language, and culture; and medieval military tactics. James also wrote the Libre de la Saviesa or \"Book of Wisdom.\" The book contains proverbs from various authors going back as far as King Solomon and as close to his own time, such as Albert the Great. It even contains maxims from the medieval Arab philosophers and from the Apophthegmata Philosophorum of Honein ben Ishak, which was probably translated at Barcelona during his reign. A Hebrew translator by the name of Jehuda was employed at James's court during this period.[13] Though James was himself a prose writer and sponsored mostly prose works, he had an appreciation of verse.[14] In consequence of the Albigensian Crusade, many troubadours were forced to flee southern France and many found refuge in Aragon and Catalonia. Notwithstanding his early patronage of poetry, by the influence of his confessor Ramon de Penyafort, James brought the Inquisition into his realm in 1233 to prevent any vernacular translation of the Bible.[15]\n\nSuccession\n\nThe favour James showed his illegitimate offspring led to protest from the nobles, and to conflicts between his sons legitimate and illegitimate. When one of the latter, Fernán Sánchez, who had behaved with gross ingratitude and treason to his father, was slain by the legitimate son Peter, the old king recorded his grim satisfaction. At the close of his life, James divided his states between his sons by Yolanda of Hungary: the aforementioned Peter received the Hispanic possessions on the mainland and James, the Kingdom of Majorca (including the Balearic Islands and the counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya) and the Lordship of Montpellier. The division inevitably produced fratricidal conflicts. In 1276, the king fell very ill at Alzira and resigned his crown, intending to retire to the monastery of Poblet, but he died at Valencia on 27 July.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nJames first married, in 1221, Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England. Though he later had the marriage annulled, his one son by her was declared legitimate: Alfonso (1229–1260), married Constance of Montcada, Countess of Bigorre In 1235, James remarried to Yolanda, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary by his second wife Yolande de Courtenay. She bore him numerous children: Yolanda, also known as Violant, (1236–1301), married Alfonso X of Castile Constance (1239–1269), married Juan Manuel, Lord of Villena, son of Ferdinand III Peter (1240–1285), successor in Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia James (1243–1311), successor in Balearics and Languedoc Ferdinand (1245–1250) Sancha (1246–1251) Isabella (1247–1271), married Philip III of France Mary (1248–1267), nun Sancho, Archbishop of Toledo (1250–1279) Eleanor (born 1251, died young) James married thirdly Teresa Gil de Vidaure, but only by a private document, and left her when she developed leprosy. James (c.1255–1285), lord of Xèrica Peter (1259–1318), lord of Ayerbe James also had several lovers, both during and after his marriages, and a few bore him illegitimate sons.

His long reign saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon on all sides: into Valencia to the south, Languedoc to the north, and the Balearic Islands to the east. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown.

By the Treaty of Corbeil, signed in May 1258, he frankly withdrew from conflict with Louis IX of France and was content with the recognition of his position, and the surrender of antiquated and illusory French claims to the overlordship of Catalonia.\n\n[edit] Reconquista\n\nMap of the conquest of Majorca, 1229After his false start at uniting Aragon with the Kingdom of Navarre through a scheme of mutual adoption, James turned to the south and the Mediterranean Sea, where he conquered Majorca on 10 September in 1229 and the rest of the Balearic Islands; Minorca 1232; Ibiza 1235) and where Valencia capitulated 28 September 1238.\n\nDuring his remaining two decades after Corbeil, James warred with the Moors in Murcia, on behalf of his son-in-law Alfonso X of Castile. On 26 March 1244, the two monarchs signed the Treaty of Almizra to determine the zones of their expansion into Andalusia so as to prevent squabbling between them. Specifically, it defined the borders of the newly-created Kingdom of Valencia. James signed it on that date, but Alfonso did not affirm it until much later. According to the treaty, all lands south of a line from Biar to Villajoyosa through Busot were reserved for Castile.\n\n[edit] Crusade of 1269\n\nValencian coin with the inscription Iacobus rex Valencie (James, king of Valencia)The \"khan of Tartary\" (actually the Ilkhan) Abaqa corresponded with James in early 1267, inviting him to join forces with the Mongols and go on Crusade.[6] James sent an ambassador to Abaqa in the person of Jayme Alaric de Perpignan, who returned with a Mongol embassy in 1269.[7] Pope Clement IV tried to dissuade James from Crusading, regarding his moral character as sub-par, and Alfonso X did the same. Nonetheless, James, who was then campaigning in Murcia, made peace with Mohammed I ibn Nasr, the Sultan of Granada, and set about collecting funds for a Crusade. After organising the government for his absence and assembling a fleet at Barcelona in September 1269, he was ready to sail east. The troubadour Olivier lo Templier composed a song praising the voyage and hoping for its success. A storm, however, drove him off course and he landed at Aigues-Mortes. According to the continuator of William of Tyre, he returned via Montpellier por l'amor de sa dame Berenguiere (\"for the love his lady Berengaria\") and abandoned any further effort at a Crusade. I\n\nJames's bastard sons Pedro Fernández and Fernán Sánchez, who had been given command of part of the fleet, did continue on their way to Acre, where they arrived in December. They found that Baibars, the Mameluke sultan of Egypt, had broken his truce with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and was making a demonstration of his military power in front of Acre. During the demonstration, Egyptian troops hidden in the bushes ambushed a returning Frankish force which had been in Galilee. James's sons, initially eager for a fight, changed their minds after this spectacle and returned home via Sicily, where Fernán Sánchez was knighted by Charles of Anjou.\n\n[edit] Patronage of art, learning, and literature Aragonese and Valencian Royalty House of Barcelona\n\nAlfonso II Children include\n\nPeter (future Peter II of Aragon)\n\nAlfonso II, Count of Provence Peter II Children include\n\nJames (future James I of Aragon, Valencia and Majorca) James I\n\nPeter (future Peter III of Aragon and I of Valencia and Sicily)\n\nJames II of Majorca\n\nViolant, Queen of Castile\n\nConstance, Infanta of Castile\n\nIsabella, Queen of France Peter III (I of Valencia and Sicily) Children include\n\nAlfonso (future Alfonso III of Aragon and I of Valencia)\n\nJames (future James I of Sicily and II of Aragon and Valencia)\n\nFrederick II of Sicily\n\nElizabeth, Queen of Portugal\n\nYolanda, Duchess of Calabria Alfonso III (I of Valencia) James II (I of Sicily) Children include\n\nAlfonso (future Alfonso IV of Aragon and II of Valencia) Alfonso IV (II of Valencia) Children include\n\nPeter (future Peter IV of Aragon and II of Valencia) Peter IV (II of Valencia) Children include\n\nJohn (future John I of Aragon and Valencia)\n\nMartin (future Martin II of Sicily and I of Aragon and Valencia)\n\nEleanor, Queen of Castile Grandchildren include\n\nFerdinand (future Ferdinand I of Aragon, Valencia and Sicily) John I\n\nYolande, Queen of France Martin I (II of Sicily)\n\nJames built and consecrated the Cathedral of Lleida, which was constructed in a style transitional between Romanesque and Gothic with little influence from Moorish styles.[2]\n\nFirst page of the Libre dels feyts, from a MS of 1325James was a patron of the University of Montpellier, which owed much of its development to his impetus.[8] He also founded a studium at Valencia in 1245 and received privileges for it from Pope Innocent IV, but it did not develop as splendidly.[2] In 1263, James presided over a debate in Barcelona between the Jewish rabbi Nahmanides and Pablo Christiani, a prominent converso.\n\nJames was the first great sponsor and patron of vernacular Catalan literature.

His long reign saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon to the south and into and across the Mediterranean as far as Naples: into Valencia to the south and the Balearic Islands, Sicily and the Kingdom of Naples to the east [the Aragonese Crown had been forced to renounce its claims to territories north of the Pyrenees, except for James's patrimony of Montpellier, by the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215]. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia.\n\nAs a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the Spanish kings. James compiled the Llibre del Consulat de Mar,] which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragonese supremacy in the western Mediterranean. He was an important figure in the development of Catalan, sponsoring Catalan literature and writing a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the Llibre dels feyts, and made Catalan the official language on his domains.\n\nJames was born at Montpellier as the only son of Peter II and Mary, heiress of William VIII of Montpellier and Eudokia Komnene. As a child, James was a pawn in the power politics of Provence, where his father was engaged in struggles helping the Cathar heretics of Albi against the Albigensian Crusaders led by Simon IV de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who were trying to exterminate them. Peter endeavoured to placate the northern crusaders by arranging a marriage between his son James and Simon's daughter. He entrusted the boy to be educated in Montfort's care in 1211, but was soon forced to take up arms against him, dying at the Battle of Muret on 12 September 1213. Montfort would willingly have used James as a means of extending his own power had not the Aragonese and Catalans appealed to Pope Innocent III, who insisted that Montfort surrender him. James was handed over, at Carcassonne, in May or June 1214, to the papal legate Peter of Benevento.\n\nJames was then sent to Monzón, where he was entrusted to the care of William of Montredon, the head of the Knights Templar in Spain and Provence; the regency meanwhile fell to his great uncle Sancho, Count of Roussillon, and his son, the king's cousin, Nuño. The kingdom was given over to confusion until, in 1217, the Templars and some of the more loyal nobles brought the young king to Zaragoza.\n\nIn 1221, he was married to Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England. The next six years of his reign were full of rebellions on the part of the nobles. By the Peace of Alcalá of 31 March 1227, the nobles and the king came to terms.\n\nAcquisition of Urgell In 1228, James faced the sternest opposition from a vassal yet. Guerau IV de Cabrera had occupied the County of Urgell in opposition to Aurembiax, the heiress of Ermengol VIII, who had died without sons in 1208. While Aurembiax' mother, Elvira, had made herself a protegée of James's father, on her death (1220), Guerao had occupied the county and displaced Aurembiax, claiming that a woman could not inherit.\n\nJames intervened on behalf of Aurembiax, whom he owed protection. He bought Guerau off and allowed Aurembiax to reclaim her territory, which she did at Lleida, probably also becoming one of James's earliest mistresses. She surrendered Lleida to James and agreed to hold Urgell in fief from him. On her death in 1231, James exchanged the Balearic Islands for Urgell with her widower, Peter of Portugal.\n\nRelations with France and Navarre From 1230 to 1232, James negotiated with Sancho VII of Navarre, who desired his help against his nephew and closest living male relative, Theobald IV of Champagne. James and Sancho negotiated a treaty whereby James would inherit Navarre on the old Sancho's death, but when this did occur, the Navarrese nobless instead elevated Theobald to the throne (1234), and James disputed it. Pope Gregory IX was required to intervene. In the end, James accepted Theobald's succession.\n\nJames endeavoured to form a state straddling the Pyrenees, to counterbalance the power of France north of the Loire. As with the much earlier Visigothic attempt, this policy was victim to physical, cultural, and political obstacles. As in the case of Navarre, he was too wise to launch into perilous adventures. By the Treaty of Corbeil, signed in May 1258, he frankly withdrew from conflict with Louis IX of France and was content with the recognition of his position, and the surrender of antiquated and illusory French claims to the overlordship of Catalonia.\n\nMarriages and children James first married, in 1221, Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England.

[edit] Reconquest\n\nAfter his false start at uniting Aragon with the Kingdom of Navarre through a scheme of mutual adoption, James turned to the south and the Mediterranean Sea, where he conquered Majorca on 10 September in 1229 and the rest of the Balearic Islands; Minorca 1232; Ibiza 1235) and where Valencia capitulated 28 September 1238. Chroniclers say he used gunpowder in the siege of Museros castle.\n\nDuring his remaining two decades after Corbeil, James warred with the Moors in Murcia, on behalf of his son-in-law Alfonso X of Castile. On 26 March 1244, the two monarchs signed the Treaty of Almizra to determine the zones of their expansion into Andalusia so as to prevent squabbling between them.

[edit] Patronage of art, learning, and literature\n\nJames built and consecrated the Cathedral of Lleida, which was constructed in a style transitional between Romanesque and Gothic with little influence from Moorish styles.[8]\n\nJames was a patron of the University of Montpellier, which owed much of its development to his impetus.[9] He also founded a studium at Valencia in 1245 and received privileges for it from Pope Innocent IV, but it did not develop as splendidly.[10] In 1263, James presided over a debate in Barcelona between the Jewish rabbi Nahmanides and Pablo Christiani, a prominent converso.\n\nJames was the first great sponsor and patron of vernacular Catalan literature.

Always the home de fembres (“lady’s man”), he eloped with the wife of one of his vassals in his final years and was excommunicated for his efforts by Pope Gregory X.

His long reign saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon on all sides: into Valencia to the south, Languedoc to the north, and the Balearic Islands to the east. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia. James first married, in 1221, Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Leonora of England. Though he later had the marriage annulled, his one son by her was declared legitimate:\n\nAlfonso (1229–1260), married Constance of Montcada, Countess of Bigorre In 1235, James remarried to Yolanda, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary by his second wife Yolande de Courtenay. She bore him numerous children:\n\nYolanda, also known as Violant, (1236–1301), married Alfonso X of Castile Constance (1239–1269), married Juan Manuel, Lord of Villena, son of Ferdinand III Peter (1240–1285), successor in Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia James (1243–1311), successor in Balearics and Languedoc Ferdinand (1245–1250) Sancha (1246–1251) Isabella (1247–1271), married Philip III of France Mary (1248–1267), nun Sancho, Archbishop of Toledo (1250–1279) Eleanor (born 1251, died young) James married thirdly Teresa Gil de Vidaure, but only by a private document, and left her when she developed leprosy.\n\nJames (c.1255–1285), lord of Xèrica Peter (1259–1318), lord of Ayerbe The children in the third marriage were recognised in his last Will as being in the line of Successon to the Throne, should the senior lines fale.\n\nJames also had several lovers, both during and after his marriages, and a few bore him illegitimate sons.\n\nBy Blanca d'Antillón:\n\nFerran Sanchis (or Fernando Sánchez; 1240–1275), baron of Castro By Berenguela Fernández:\n\nPedro Fernández, baron of Híjar By Elvira Sarroca:\n\nJaume Sarroca (born 1248), Archbishop of Huesca\n\nJames I the Conqueror, Lord of Montpellier, Crown of Aragon, Legislator, Organiser. James compiled the Libre del Consulat de Mar, which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragones supermacy in he Western Mediterranean. He developed the Catalan, sponsering Catalan literature and writing a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his on reign: The Libre dels Fets. He built and consecrated the Cathedral of Lleida. He was a patron of the University of Montpellier. He founded a studium at Valencia and received privileges for it from Pope Innocent IV. He wrote an autobiography of \"Bookd of Deeds\". he wrote Libre de la Saviesa or Boof of Wisdom. James prevented any vernaculor translation of the Bible in 1233.\n\nJames I the Conqueror[1] (2 February 1208 – 27 July 1276) was the King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier from 1213 to 1276. His long reign saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon to the south and into and across the Mediterranean as far as Naples: into Valencia to the south and the Balearic Islands, Sicily and the Kingdom of Naples to the east [the Aragonese Crown had been forced to renounce its claims to territories north of the Pyrenees, except for James's patrimony of Montpellier, by the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215]. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia.\n\nAs a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the Spanish kings. James compiled the Llibre del Consulat de Mar,[2] which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragonese supremacy in the western Mediterranean. He was an important figure in the development of Catalan, sponsoring Catalan literature and writing a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the Llibre dels feyts, and made Catalan the official language on his domains.[2]\n\nJames owed his name to his mother's strange whim of placing 12 lighted candles, name for the 12 Apostles, around his cradle & determining that the last to burn out should be his patron. He was described as 'tall, muscular, dignified & never knew a day of illness'.\n\nKing of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier\n\nJaime I, Rey de Aragón was born in 1205.1 He married, firstly, Eleanor de Castilla, daughter of Alfonso VIII, Rey de Castilla and Eleanor Plantagenet, in 1221.2 He and Eleanor de Castilla were divorced in 1229.1 He married, secondly, Yolante Arpád, daughter of Andreas II Arpád, King of Hungary and Yolande de Courtney, on 8 September 1235. He married, thirdly, Theresa Vidaure after 1251.2 He died on 25 July 1276.\n\nJaime I, Rey de Aragón also went by the nick-name of Jaime 'the Conqueror' (?).3 He was the son of Pedro II, Rey de Aragón and Marie de Montpellier.2 He succeeded to the title of Rey Jaime I de Aragón in 1213.2 Child of Jaime I, Rey de Aragón and Theresa Vidaure\n\nJaime Fernandez de Aragon, Baron de Jerica+4\n\nChild of Jaime I, Rey de Aragón and Eleanor de Castilla\n\nAlfonso de Aragón, Infante de Aragón2 b. c 1200, d. 1260\n\nChildren of Jaime I, Rey de Aragón and Yolante Arpád\n\nYolante de Aragón+5 d. 1300\n\nPedro de Ayerve5\n\nSancho de Aragón5 d. 1275\n\nConstanza de Aragón+6 d. c 1269\n\nPedro III, Rey de Aragón+5 b. 1236, d. 1285\n\nIsabel de Aragón+5 b. 1243, d. 28 Jan 1271\n\nJaime I, Rey de Majorca+5 b. 1243, d. 1311\n\nCitations\n\n[S11] Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Family: A Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 62.
