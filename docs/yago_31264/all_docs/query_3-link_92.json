        "text": "Everyone Cares About My Bad Reputation\n\nAlys of France is either a lady whose reputation was defamed, or someone who showed incredibly poor judgement. Either way, she was definitely an unlucky princess. Once blessed with a future filled with promise and the potential to be crowned Queen of England, she ended up in a scandal that was gossiped about throughout the courts of Europe.\n\nBorn on October 4, 1160 to Louis VII, King of France, and his second wife, Constance of Castile, Alys was an immediate disappointment. She was a girl. To make matters worse, Constance died after giving birth to Alys.\n\nIn 1152 Louis VII had agreed to an annulment from his vivacious first wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, because after fourteen years of marriage, she had only produced two daughters. Louis was in desperate need of a male heir. Two years after his annulment, in 1154, he married Constance of Castile.\n\nAfter Louis had been married for four years to Constance, with only the birth of another daughter to show for it, the cunning Henry II, King of England, began to suspect that Louis would never have his longed-for male heir. If so, then the throne of France would vacant, and the next ruler of France would probably be someone who married one of Louis’ daughters. Henry began negotiations with France for a marriage between one of his sons and Louis’ one-year-old daughter, Marguerite of France.\n\nTwo years later Constance gave birth to Alys, the second daughter after six years of marriage, with no sons. Although Louis was reported to have been devastated by the death of his wife in childbirth, he felt as if he had no time to waste. He began his search for a new bride. In the meantime, he continued to work on a betrothal agreement with Henry II for the marriage of his third daughter Marguerite to Henry’s oldest son.\n\nLouis’ two oldest daughters that he had with Eleanor of Aquitaine were already engaged. He had arranged their betrothals to the two sons of Thibaut II, Count of Champagne, although only one of those marriages would take place. Louis’ two oldest daughters, Marie and Alix, were unacceptable as potential mates for Henry’s brood of sons since they were half-sisters to Henry’s children.\n\nEight weeks after her annulment from Louis in 1152, Eleanor married Henry. At the time of their wedding, he was Duke of Anjou and ten years younger than she was, but he had a strong claim to the throne of England. She was Duchess of the rich province of Aquitaine. After several hard-fought battles, Henry was able to claim his kingdom. On December 19, 1154, Henry and Eleanor were crowned king and queen of England.\n\nLouis was bitter over Henry’s marriage to Eleanor, especially since as Duke of Anjou, Henry was obligated to swear fealty to Louis, not sneak off and marry his discarded wife. Even more annoying, after giving him nothing except two daughters during their lengthy marriage, Eleanor had produced a son the year after her marriage to Henry. Their first son, William, died as an infant, but the couple continued to have children. By the end of 1158, Eleanor had given Henry three healthy sons and a daughter.\n\nOn November 2, 1160, a mere month after the birth of Louis’ fourth daughter Alys and the death of Constance, his queen, Louis agreed to the betrothal of his three-year-old daughter Marguerite to Henry’s five-year-old son. The boy, who was referred to as Henry the Young King when he got older and had been crowned, was expected to be King of England one day. Marguerite’s dowry was the Vexin, a county in the northwestern part of France.\n\nLouis’ oldest daughter, Marie, had been sent to Champagne after her betrothal in 1153. It was common for royal child brides to be sent to their new country after a betrothal was arranged so that they could be raised there and learn the language and the customs. Marie was married to Henry I, Count of Champagne, in 1159.\n\nMarguerite was eventually sent to the court of Henry II. She married Henry II’s oldest son on August 27, 1172 at Winchester Cathedral. The young couple were crowned as king and queen in 1172. Henry II continued to reign and controlled all the power in the realm, but it was understood that his oldest son would eventually inherit his kingdom.\n\nHowever, only a year after their marriage, Henry the Young King revolted against his father. His father gave his son only limited funds. Having been crowned as king, Henry the Young King wanted a realm of his own to rule, not the promise of a kingdom in the future. The revolt lasted from 1173 to 1174, fueled by encouragement from Eleanor of Aquitaine. After Eleanor was imprisoned, Henry the Young King was reconciled with his father.\n\nMarguerite of France had proven to be a disappointment as a bride. After five years of marriage, she finally became pregnant. She endured a difficult delivery to give birth prematurely to her only child, a boy named William. He died three days after he was born. She was in Paris when she gave birth, not England or any of the counties in France that were controlled by her father-in-law.\n\nShe never became pregnant again. Henry II began to plan for the annulment of his son’s marriage since it was obvious that she would never produce an heir to the throne of England. His son was now in the same position as Louis VII of France had been with his first two queens, only the situation was even worse since Marguerite wasn’t even producing daughters.\n\nLouis had found that his fortunes changed, although he certainly waited long enough to achieve his fervently desired goal. He had remarried only five weeks after the death of Constance of Castile. He married Adele of Champagne, the twenty-year-old sister of his oldest daughter’s husband. Louis was forty-years-old when they were married. Louis’ new marriage was childless for the first five years, but in 1165 Adele gave birth to a son who would eventually be Phillip II, King of France. Adele and Louis had only one more child, born six years later, another daughter, but the birth of Phillip II changed everything in the politics between England and France.\n\nHenry II arranged for the betrothal of his second son, Richard, to Alys in 1169 when she was only nine-years-old. Like her sister Marguerite, she was sent to Henry’s court to be raised there. While she was a teenager, rumors began to spread throughout Europe claiming that Henry II had seduced Alys.\n\nThe contemporary accounts differ as to whether Henry really had an affair with the girl who was intended as the bride of his second son. Girls from noble and royal families were married as young as twelve, although the marriage was usually not consummated until the bride was fourteen. It was expected that a girl would be a virgin when she got married.\n\nAlthough it was the era of courtly love where knights swore devotion to a noble lady, that love was expected to platonic. Among royalty and nobility, arranged marriages were used to create and cement alliances between countries and families. Men wanted a woman whose virtue would ensure that her children were fathered only by him since the purpose of marriage was not a love match, but to perpetuate his bloodline and produce male heirs to inherit his lands.\n\nThis was especially significant in a royal marriage. It was believed that God had ordained who would become king which is why it was significant that the heir to a kingdom be the legitimate offspring of the previous anointed king. A king was believed to have healing powers for such diseases as scrofula, cramps, and epilepsy. This ability did not come to him from being king, but through his bloodline which God had selected as sacred.\n\nAs a virgin princess, Alys would have been desirable to another royal groom seeking a bride even if the match with Richard fell through since it would have allowed the new groom to form an alliance with France. However, if Alys had actually been seduced by Henry II, then she was no longer desirable as a royal bride. The allegation not only damaged her reputation and lowered her value considerably as a potential bride, but the aspersion on her character and her alleged lack of morality caused embarrassment to her father, Louis VII of France.\n\nThe claim that he had seduced Alys not only damaged her reputation, but caused Henry II to be seen throughout the courts of Europe as a king who could not be trusted to fulfill his promises. The claim that he had seduced his son’s intended bride was shocking. Some of the accounts that claimed she had become his mistress have been shown to be highly based against Henry II. However, Henry’s own past behavior fueled the gossip. Henry II was known to have had several affairs.\n\nHenry openly confessed to his affair with Rosamund Clifford in 1174. Rosamund died at Godstow Abbey in 1176 before she was thirty-years-old. It was claimed that Rosamund had been the love of his life. If so, he didn’t waste a lot of time in celibacy after their affair ended.\n\nHe also had an affair with his ward, Ida de Tosney, who gave birth in 1176 to his illegitimate child, William Longspee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury. His seduction of Ida was seen as significant when evaluating if the allegations about Alys were true because as his ward, Ida of Tosney had been under his protection.\n\nWhen Henry tired of her, Ida de Tosney was discreetly married off to Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk. To sweeten the deal, Henry II returned three manors to Roger Bigod that he had confiscated after the death of Roger’s father. The couple had five sons and three, possibly four, daughters. Their marriage must have been reasonably happy.\n\nIn 1177, when Alys would have been seventeen, Cardinal Peter of Saint Chrysogonus insisted that Henry II allow Alys to marry Richard or the Catholic Church would place his French lands under interdict. This would have prevented any public celebration of sacred rites in those areas including weddings, burials, or church services. Rumors swirled around the courts of Europe that Alys had given birth to Henry’s child. There was also gossip that Henry intended on annulling his marriage to Eleanor and marrying Alys. Eleanor had remained locked up since her assistance in her sons’ rebellion against their father. When Louis VII died in 1180, the marriage between Alys and Richard had still not taken place.\n\nAfter the death of Henry the Young King in 1183, Phillip II of France demanded the return of Marguerite’s dowry since there had been no children from the marriage as per their betrothal agreement. Despite Marguerite being infertile, Bela III of Hungary offered to marry her. Henry finally agreed to relinquish her dowry. Marguerite was given a substantial pension in exchange for giving up the Vexin and Gisors to Phillip II.\n\nAlys remained in Henry II’s court, still no closer to becoming a royal bride than she had when she came there as a nine-year-old child. Richard banded together with Phillip II of France in 1189 to wage war against Henry II. At Ballans their combined forces defeated Henry’s army on July 4, 1189. Two days later Henry died at Chinon. Richard was King of England and ruler of his father’s French territories.\n\nPhillip II and Richard planned to go on the Third Crusade together, but they only reached Sicily before tension began to show between the two men. Phillip insisted that Richard marry Alys, but Richard refused on the grounds that she had been his father’s mistress, threatening to bring forth witnesses to testify to her affair with Henry. The two kings finally agreed to end Richard’s betrothal to Alys.\n\nOn May 12, 1191 Richard married Berengaria of Navarre, a match that had been promoted by his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who had been let out of captivity as soon as Henry II had died. Richard continued on his Crusade. However, on his return, he was captured near Vienna by Leopold of Austria. Leopold accused Richard of murdering his cousin, Conrad of Montferrat. Richard had also insulted Leopold by casting down Leopold’s standard from the walls of Acre.\n\nLeopold handed Richard over to Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, on March 28, 1193. Richard was imprisoned in Trifels Castle in Annweiler, Germany. Henry VI was in need of money for his army, and ransoming Richard seemed like a practical way to raise it. Crusaders were supposed to be exempt from this sort of insult because they had been on a sacred quest to free the Holy Land. Pope Celestine III excommunicated both Leopold of Austria and Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, for their actions. However, Richard remained a prisoner.\n\nHenry VI demanded 100,000 pounds of silver, which was approximately two to three times the annual amount that the English crown raised. Eleanor of Aquitaine raised the money by taxing laymen and clergy for a fourth of the value of their property. She also confiscated gold and silver treasures from the churches, as well as enacting land taxes and taxes on knights.\n\nIn a gesture that demonstrated the complex, dysfunctional relationships among Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine’s brood of children, Richard’s youngest brother John banded with Phillip II, King of France, to offer Henry VI 80,000 marks if he would hold Richard until September 29, 1194. Henry VI declined the offer. Richard’s ransom was paid and he was released on February 4, 1194. When Phillip heard the news, he sent a message to his ally John, saying, “Look to yourself, the Devil is loose.”\n\nAfter Richard returned, he waged war on Phillip II again in 1194. Phillip had joined with John to fight against Richard. However, Richard reconciled with John and named him as his heir since he and Berengaria had no children.\n\nRichard and Berengaria actually spent very little time together. After he went on Crusade, she returned to his French territories. When he was released from captivity, he returned to England, focused on regaining territory that he had lost. She remained in Beaufort-en-Vallee in France. The couple were reunited after Richard returned to France.\n\nThere have been some historians who have speculated that Alys became Henry II’s mistress because she knew that Richard was a homosexual. They point to Richard’s childless marriage as evidence of this. However, there were contemporary accounts that Richard had affairs with women. Those same accounts verify that he had one illegitimate child and may have been a rapist.\n\nDespite the gossip about Alys in the royal courts of Europe, it is possible that she simply did not appeal to Richard or that he did not find her dowry enough to tempt him into marrying her. He selected Berengaria as a bride after he met her at a tournament in Navarre. She was a choice that was encouraged by his mother. He hoped by marrying Berengaria that he could acquire Navarre.\n\nPhillip had proposed Alys as a bride for John, but Eleanor put a halt to that suggestion. It cannot be assumed that Eleanor objected to the match on the grounds that Alys had been Henry’s mistress. After all, Alys was now thirty-four-years-old in an era where many women did not live much past forty. Alys’ mother had produced only two children. Alys’ sister Marguerite had failed to have any living children despite being married to two husbands. Since Richard’s marriage had proven to be childless, leading to the increasingly likelihood that John would inherit the throne of England as well as his French territories, Eleanor probably felt that a bride who came from a fertile family would be a better match for John.\n\nPhillip II gave Alys the title of Countess of Vexin to make her more appealing to prospective bridegrooms. In 1195 she was married to William IV Talvas, Count of Ponthieu. She was eighteen years older than her new husband. Phillip had assumed that the couple would be childless. He hoped that when they had no heirs, he would be able to gain control over Ponthieu which was strategically important to him.\n\nHowever, Alys surprised him by giving birth to a daughter, Marie of Ponthieu, four years later. Alys lived until 1220. Her husband died the following year. Their daughter married Simon of Dammartin. She inherited Ponthieu and the Vexin. The Vexin would not return into the hands of an English king until November 1, 1254 when it was part of the dowry of another princess, the great-granddaughter of Alys of France. The Vexin was the dowry of Eleanor of Castile when she married Edward III, King of England.\n\nThe story of the dysfunctional family of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine was turned into the Academy Award winning movie The Lion in Winter in 1968. Although the date of the Christmas Court in the movie is wrong, (it was 1182 in Caen, not 1183 in Chinon), the personalities of the characters were portrayed accurately, as well as the conflicts among the family members. The alleged affair between Henry II and Alys is part of the plot, as is the alleged homosexuality of Richard I. Although those elements of the plot are not proven as historical fact, the movie was a fascinating portrayal of Henry, Eleanor, and their three sons, and the dispute over who will marry Alys.\n\nPhoto is of Chinon Castle.
