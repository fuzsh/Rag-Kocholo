        "text": "Today's destination wedding is all about the laid back Mediterranean vibes of Sicily, true love and laughter. Eleanor & Joe planned a classic and simple wedding with close family and friends at an intimate venue in Sicily. The day was full of love, with many happy tears, a lot of laughter, delicate styling and pretty peonies throughout. Fotografo Professionale captured every moment that the couple and guests shared. Let's take a look...\n\nEleanor and Joe first met in 2011 through close friends and they let nature take its course. Eleanor explains how it all started...\"He was one of my friend’s roommates and we always had fun talking, singing, and laughing together. Eventually, when the timing was right, we got together in March 2012 after we had been friendly for a few months. Once we started dating we instantly fell for each other and became best friends. It didn’t take long to realise that we both found each other incredibly funny, smart, and fun. We have a love and respect for one another that is unparalleled.\"\n\nJoe proposed in one of the most romantic cities in the world. Eleanor remembers...\"Joe and I love to travel and one of our favorite cities, and the first place we ever traveled to, is Paris. We were in Paris over the winter holidays with another couple we are close with. One night, we left to meet our friends at their apartment to have a drink before going to dinner at our favorite restaurant - Au Passage. Thanks to my terrible sense of direction, I did not think about the fact that we weren’t walking the right way. Joe took me on a walk past all of the places we had discovered together in the beautiful city lights. He brought me to a park we love and then got down on one knee. You can take it from there.\"\n\nDreaming of marrying in Sicily Eleanor and Joe began to feel disheartened when their venue hunt wasn't as easy as they thought it would be. Eleanor explains the mixed emotions...\"Joe and I went to Sicily in hopes that we would find the perfect place to get married. We both thought that the first place would be “the one.” However, it simply wasn’t. The second place we went was beautiful but it was only big enough for 30 people; we knew we had to invite over 100. The third place we went to was Villa La Limonaia. It looked beautiful online, but neither of us originally thought it would be the place for the wedding, but when you know you know. As soon as we arrived on the property, we both loved it. Before we had a tour, before we met the lovely woman working there - who also ended up introducing us to our amazing wedding planners - we had a feeling. It felt right and we both knew it at the same time. It was unique, beautiful, and elegant without feeling smug or pretentious. It was perfect for us and we knew it the second we set foot there.\"\n\nThe day was filled with special moments and personal touches. Eleanor gives us a little insight...\"There were little things that did it. Joe wore his grandfather’s watch that his father gave him. I wore my great grandmother’s sapphire cocktail ring from the 1920's as my something old (and something blue.) My engagement ring was created with a diamond from my grandfather’s mason badge. My hairclip was my something borrowed - from one of my best friends, Becca. She wore it at her wedding, and Joe and I love her and her husband very much both individually and as a couple.\"\n\nSharing the same wishes, Eleanor and Joe focused on...\"Showing our friends and family the things that we loved about Sicily. The food and wine were probably the most important to us, and we chose a caterer that blew us - and our guests - away. We also wanted to share the dinner all together, which is why we seated everyone at one long table. We made sure that the table was beautifully decorated without making it difficult to speak to or see each other across the table.\"\n\nEleanor shares a moment she will never forget...\"During the dinner, as with many weddings, the most important speeches were given. All of the speeches were touching, but one of Joe's Italian cousins chose to speak - with Joe’s father as a translator. I won’t soon forget anything from our wedding, but I will never forget this. It brought together family from across the world, and I loved it.\"\n\nFor their honeymoon Eleanor and Joe remained in Italy. Eleanor gushes...\"We stayed in Sicily the week before the wedding (and the day after to recover) but then we went to mainland Italy via Ferry with a rental car. We drove through Italy and got to visit several amazing places including the Amalfi Coast (stayed in a small, beautiful, and non-touristy town Cetara), Florence, and Rome. We loved Cetara and Florence.\"\n\nA warm congratulations to you both and thanks so much for sharing your wedding day with us all. A big thank you also goes to Fotografo Professionale for sharing their work with us.
