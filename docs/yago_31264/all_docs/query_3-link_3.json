        "text": "Eleanor I (3 June 1527 - 26 June 1584), often latinised as Alienora de Sicilia, was Queen of Sicily from 1555 to 1584 and Archduchess of Further Austria as the spouse of Ferdinand II. She was a cousin to Constance V of Genovia, as they are both the grandchildren of Richard V of Genovia. At the request of Elora IV of Genovia, her grandniece and a great ally of the Papacy, Eleanor was proclaimed a Servant of God after her death in 1584, proclaimed Venerable in 1590 and Beatified in 1600 for her pious and religious nature and upbringing.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nEleanor was born as the second-born daughter of Frederick IV of Sicily, the son of Charlotte I of Sicily and Richard V of Genovia and his first wife, Sophia of France, the daughter of Louis XII of France and his third wife Elizabeth of York. Eleanor was the only child born when Frederick and Sophia were infuriated with each other. Upon birth, Eleanor had one elder sister Beatrice of Sicily, who was at the time of Eleanor's birth Princess of Catania.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nIn 1540, Eleanor was offered to Ferdinand of Austria, the son of Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, as Charles V had wanted one of his wife's nieces to be wed to Ferdinand, however Ferdinand instead married her sister Beatrice of Sicily.\n\nIn 1552, Beatrice died. Charles V still wanted a marriage alliance with Sicily, and he approached Frederick IV of Sicily and offered a marriage between Ferdinand and Eleanor yet again. Frederick instead offered one of his younger daughters from his second marriage, he first offered Constance of Sicily and then Anna of Sicily, however both offers were turned down, with Charles strictly wanting a marriage between Ferdinand and Eleanor. Even though he was reluctant, Frederick allowed permission for Ferdinand to be wed to Eleanor, and this was done in Catania on 4 May 1554, and upon Ferdinand's accession as Archduke of Further Austria, Eleanor became Archduchess of Further Austria. Their first daughter Alice of Sicily was born on 9 February 1560, their second Blanche of Tyrol was born on 5 May 1561 and their third Maria of Austria was born on 16 June 1584. It was 10 days after the birth of Maria that Eleanor died. Due to the conditions of the marriage contract, Ferdinand and Eleanor's eldest child would be styled 'of Sicily' and any other children they had would be styled 'of Tyrol'.\n\nAccession[]"
