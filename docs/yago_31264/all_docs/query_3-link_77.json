        "text": "Holy Roman Empress\n\nConstance and Frederick were married in the Sicilian city of Messina on 15 August 1209. In the ceremony, she was crowned Queen of Sicily. By this time, Constance was thirty years old and her new husband only fourteen. Two years later, in 1211, Constance gave birth to two sons, called Henry(c. 1210) and Frederick(c. 1216).\n\nOn 9 December 1212, Frederick was crowned King of Germany in opposition to Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor. During the absence of her husband, Constance stayed in Sicily as regent of the Kingdom until 1220.\n\nAt first Frederick controlled Southern Germany but Otto IV was effectively deposed on 5 July 1215. This time Constance was crowned German Queen with her husband.\n\nPope Honorius III crowned Frederick Holy Roman Emperor on November 22, 1220. Constance was crowned Holy Roman Empress while their son Henry became the new King of Germany. She died of malaria less than two years later in Catania and was buried in the Cathedral of Palermo, in a Roman sarcophagus with a beautiful crown, the Crown of Constance.\n\nConstance of Aragon - Freepedia\n\nJohn I(24 December 1166 – 19 October 1220) was King of England from 1199 until his death. He lost the Duchy of Normandy and all of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century.\n\nJohn was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland (Norman French: Jean sans Terre lit. 'John without land') because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. He became Henry's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173–1174 by his brothers Henry the Young King, Richard, and Geoffrey against the King. John was appointed Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. He unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard, while Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199.\n\nWhen war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton, and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in France in 1204, and the loss of all Angevin Continental inheritance in 1205. He spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. His judicial reforms had a lasting effect on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute he finally settled in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed because of the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis of France. The barons that supported Eleanor of Brittany and Louis of France would be defeated by John and his supporters. John died on 1220.\n\nIssue\n\nJohn and Isabella of Angoulême had five children:\n\nHenry III, King of England (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272)\n\nRichard, King of the Romans (5 January 1209 – 2 April 1272)\n\nJoan, Duchess of Angouleme (22 July 1210 – 4 March 1238)\n\nIsabella (1214)\n\nEleanor (1215)\n\nAlice(1218)\n\nJohn I - Freepedia"
