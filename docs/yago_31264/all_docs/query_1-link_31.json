        "text": "The Crown Union of the Kingdoms of Aragon, Catalonia, Liguria, Majorca, Sardinia, Valencia, and County of Malta, more commonly referred to as the Crown of Aragon or simply as Aragon, is a composite monarchy under the rule of the King of Aragon. The Crown of Aragon is a thalassocracy controlling the easternmost third of the Iberian peninsula and the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Corsica, Liguria and Malta. It also controls parts of Greece. Since 1459 Aragon has been an autonomous constituent of the United Crown.\n\nConstituents[]\n\nThe Crown of Aragon is in effect a confederation of separate monarchies under the rule of a single monarch, with the exception of Malta, which is when an heir apparent is in waiting to the throne is governed by the Crown Prince. This was the case from 1412 to 1416, for example, when Crown Prince Alfonso was invested as Count of Malta. However, since Eleanor I's accession to the throne of Aragon after the death of Alfonso V in 1451, the title has been transferred back to the Crown.\n\nKingdom of Aragon - Capital: Zaragoza\n\nKingdom of Catalonia - Capital: Barcelona\n\nKingdom of Valencia - Capital: Valencia City\n\nCounty of Malta - Capital: Nueva Barcelona\n\nKingdom of Majorca - Capital: Palma\n\nKingdom of Sardinia - Capital: Cagliari\n\nKingdom of Liguria - Capital: Genoa\n\nDuchy of Athens - Capital: Athens\n\nFormer possessions[]\n\nKingdom of Argelia - Capital: Argelia City - Lost in 1418 to the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nKingdom of Sicily - Capital: Palermo - Lost in 1464 to Italy as a result of the Iberio-Italian-French War of 1464. Has since become a core territory of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nRoyal family[]\n\nThe current ruling family of Aragon is the Castilian House of Trastamara. The line of succession as of 1487 is as follows:\n\nHM Ferdinand II of Great Iberia (born 1459) - Currently ruling monarch of Great Iberia. Eldest son of Eleanor of Aragon and Sancho of Castile. Ascended to the throne after the death of Sancho and the abdication of Eleanor.\n\nHRH Prince Alfonso of Great Iberia (born 1469) - First brother of Ferdinand II.\n\nHRH Prince Henry of Great Iberia (born 1469) - Twin brother of Prince Alfonso; de jure the second brother of Ferdinand I\n\nHRH Princess Arianne of Great Iberia (born 1462) - Sister of Ferdinand II.\n\nHM Isabella, Queen of the Hellenes (born 1429) - Third daughter of Alfonso V and Catherine of Castile. Sister of Eleanor I. Married to King Jacob I Crispo of the Hellenes.\n\nHRH Prince Peter of Aragon, etc. (born 1424) - Son of Prince Henry of Aragon and Princess Joanne of Valois-Orléans. Cousin of Eleanor I.\n\nHM Jacob I, King of the Hellenes, Prince of Naxos (born 1436) - Son of Princess Eleanor and Duke John II Crispo of Naxos. Cousin of Eleanor I. Married to Princess Isabella of Aragon.\n\nMilitary[]\n\nThe Aragonese military is of modest size in comparison to other contemporaries, but is large enough to effectively defend the Crown Union from both internal and external threats, and to advance Aragonese interests abroad. Aragon focuses more of its resources on its navy, the Royal Armada, which is growing to become one of the largest in the region.\n\nArmy[]\n\nWhile Aragon does not have a standing army, it does possess the resources required to quickly and efficiently raise and train one for any purpose. The current Aragonese Army is focused on defending Aragon from foreign incursions, particularly from Africa in the south and Genoa in the north, and on assisting the Crusade in Greece and Turkey. As of 1424, the whole land force of the Aragonese armed forces is about 80,000 strong.\n\nRoyal Armada[]\n\nThe pride of Aragon's military, the Royal Armada is a grand fleet of 360 ships. All are equipped with state-of-the-art cannons, which Aragon claims to be proof of the country's technological prowess. The design of the caravels, which are the heart of the entire navy, are a closely guarded secret, and crews are ordered to destroy their ships rather than surrender them to the enemy if need be, and the government spends a lot of time and money on continually improving ship designs to stay ahead of any enemies and rivals. The Royal Armada is currently led by Admiral Juan-Carlos Fernandez.\n\nList of monarchs[]\n\n# Name\n\n(Born – Died) Portrait Reign Succession right Titles Years Dynasty 1 Ramiro I\n\n(1007 – 1063) 1035 – 1063\n\n28 years Jiménez Son of Sancho III of Navarre King of Aragon 2 Sancho Ramírez\n\n(1042 – 1094) 1063 – 1094\n\n31 years Son of Ramiro I King of Aragon and Navarre 3 Peter I\n\n(1068 – 1104) 1094 – 1104\n\n20 years Son of Sancho Ramírez 4 Alfonso I\n\n\"The Battler\"\n\n(1073 – 1134) 1104 – 1134\n\n30 years Brother of Peter I 5 Ramiro II\n\n\"The Monk\"\n\n(1086 – 1157) 1134 – 1157\n\n23 years Brother of Alfonso I King of Aragon 6 Petronilla\n\n(1136 – 1174) 1137 – 1164\n\n27 years Daughter of Ramiro II Queen of Aragon 7 Alfonso II\n\n(1157 – 1196) 1164 – 1196\n\n32 years Barcelona Son of Petronilla King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona 8 Peter II\n\n(1178 – 1213) 1196 – 1213\n\n(17 years) Son of Alfonso II 9 James I\n\n(1208 – 1276) 1213 – 1276\n\n63 years Son of Peter II 10 Peter III\n\n(1240 – 1285) 1276 – 1285\n\n9 years Son of James I 11 Alfonso III\n\n(1265 – 1291) 1285 – 1291\n\n6 years Son of Peter III 12 James II\n\n(1267 – 1327) 1291 – 1327\n\n36 years Brother of Alfonso III 13 Alfonso IV\n\n(1299 – 1336) 1327 – 1336\n\n9 years Son of James II King of Aragon and Valencia and Count of Barcelona 14 Peter IV\n\n(1319 – 1387) 1336 – 1387\n\n51 years Son of Alfonso IV King of Aragon, Majorca and Valencia and Count of Barcelona 15 John I\n\n(1350 – 1396) 1387 – 1396\n\n9 years Son of Peter IV 16 Martin\n\n(1356 – 1400) 1396 – 1400\n\n4 years Brother of John I King of Aragon, Majorca, Valencia and Sicily and Count of Barcelona 17 Ferdinand\n\n\"The Just\"\n\n(1380 – 1416) 1400 – 1416\n\n16 years Trastámara Nephew of Martin King of Aragon, Majorca, Valencia, Sicily, Sardinia and Argelia, Count of Barcelona 18 Alfonso V\n\n\"The Faithful\"\n\n(1396 – 1451) 1416 - 1451\n\n35 years\n\nRegents: Prince John\n\n1419 - 1421 Son of Ferdinand I King of Aragon, Majorca, Valencia, Sicily and Sardinia, Count of Barcelona, Defender of the Faith 19 Eleanor\n\n\"The Great\"\n\n(born 1427) 1451 - 1487\n\n36 years Daughter of Alfonso V Queen of Aragon, Castile, Catalonia, Gibraltar, Granada, Leon, Liguria, Majorca, Navarre, Sardinia, and Valencia, Defender of the Faith 20 Ferdinand II\n\n(born 1459) 1487 - present\n\n11 years Son of Eleanor King of Aragon, Cape Verde, Castile, Catalonia, Gibraltar, Granada, Leon, Liguria, Majorca, Morocco, Navarre, Portugal and the Algarves, Sardinia and Valencia, Duke of Athens, Lord of Madeira and of Madrid, Defender of the Faith\n\nForeign relations[]\n\nVarious descriptions apply to the diplomatic relations Aragon has to the countries around it. At this time, Aragon has very few formal alliances with other countries, although it does share friendly relations with a number of European countries.\n\nAllies[]\n\nCastile: Castile, Aragon's western neighbour and one of the other two countries on the Iberian peninsula, is a close partner of Aragon. The current dynasty governing Aragon is a branch of Castile's House of Trastamara, and thus Aragon's King Alfonso V is the first cousin of Castile's King Henry IV. An alliance between the two was formally created in 1407 under the Treaty of Barcelona. Aragon and Castile are currently in the process of integrating into a single nation known as Great Iberia.\n\nEngland: An unofficial alliance was established between Aragon and England in 1415 when Aragon initiated an invasion of Navarre. This alliance was reaffirmed fifty years later when England contributed to an effort to defeat France, which resulted in the liberation of an occupied Aragon.\n\nBurgundy\n\nPortugal: Portugal has been a constituent of the United Crown of Great Iberia since 1462. As a result, although the governments of Portugal and Aragon have historically been at odds with each other, the two are automatically allies.\n\nTrading partners[]\n\nGreece: Aragon and Greece have had positive relations since Princess Eleanor the Elder of Aragon (the sister of Alfonso V) married John II Crispo, the then-Duke of Naxos. Since then, Naxos has had close ties with Aragon, and after the unification of Greece, the Duke's son, Prince Jacob Crispo, became the Grand Duke of Thessaloniki, and later King of the Hellenes.\n\nPapal States: Although there was some animosity from the Holy See towards Aragon as the Antipope was Aragonese, this swiftly came to an end after the arrest of the Antipope in 1403. Diplomatic relations between Barcelona and Rome have since been restored and are improving; King Ferdinand I declared Aragon's full support for the Catholic establishment in the Vatican. In 1477, the Holy See opened its ports to Iberian merchants, allowing them to bypass the stifling Sicilian Channel under the domination of the Compact of Valletta. This has considerably improved relations between Iberia and the Vataican.\n\nOther friendly relations[]\n\nAustria: Austria fought alongside Aragonese forces to subdue Italy in the War of the Grand Mediterranean Coalition.\n\nThe Two Sicilies: Current occupant of the former Aragonese Crown Kingdom of Sicily. Fought alongside Aragonese forces to subdue Italy in the War of the Grand Mediterranean Coalition.\n\nNeutral[]\n\nMilan: Aragon and Milan for the most part have been rivals, and had been especially over the throne of Naples. However, this conflict was ended when Italy successfully placed one of their own on the throne. Milan nevertheless always sought more than just Naples, and invaded the Aragonese Crown Kingdoms of Sicily and Sardinia, and the County of Malta. Occupation of the two islands by Italy continued until 1483, when Naples declared its independence as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Iberia joined the war a year later in support of Naples, invading and successfully retaking Sardinia, Malta, Liguria and Corsica. The war on Italy continued until 1487, when the Treaty of Genoa dissolved Italy and stripped it of its power.\n\nTense relations[]\n\nAbbasid Caliphate: The Abbasid Caliphate, current ruler of what was the Kingdom of Argelia, is as an Islamic country a rival of Aragon. However, with the extended peace that has allowed both countries to develop since the Abbasid conquest of Argelia, relations have been slowly normalising.\n\nFrance: Aragon and France became enemies in 1415 when Aragon declared war and invaded Navarre. However, the swift withdrawal of forces from Navarre ended the war, and both Aragon and France agreed to a status quo ante bellum; relations were thereafter normalised. Relations improved considerably thanks partly to a royal marriage between Prince Henry of Aragon and Princess Joanne Valois-Orléans of France, and continued to do so throughout the next 50 years. However, such efforts proved futile, as in 1463 France invaded Aragon itself following the latter's union with Castile, as it felt threatened by Castile's unification with a \"former enemy of France.\" This completely destroyed diplomatic relations, which have been very tense since.\n\nEnemies[]"
