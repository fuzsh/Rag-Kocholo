        "text": "March 24, 2015\n\nJoanna of Sicily and England had a complicated life with high and low periods interspersed through it. I knew about her life as well as others in her family, my favorite one of all time. I believe that she made a difference to her time and place and was not merely \"a reed in the wind\".\n\nA poignant ending to her life at a relatively young age, nonetheless left me with a feeling that she had accomplished a lot of what she had hoped to. Recommended for the fine historical research as well as a gentle but compelling narrative.\n\nAugust 5, 2015\n\nInteresting subject matter [nice to have a story about a Queen that's lesser known in spite of her very much written about family members] and lots of history included, but the writing is not great.\n\nThe dialogue is too modern and feels very artificial; often the history included feels recited, rather than woven into the story. One thing that really irritated me was the way the author had characters of lower status addressing the royalty - waiting women and servants addressed the kings and queens by their title and first name, rather than using the less personal addresses like \"Your Grace\" or \"Your Highness.\" That felt really off. The characters are mostly written in a very one dimensional way. It's just not up to par in the quality of the writing.\n\nThere are also some grammatical issues, one of which is on the \"Mistakes that drive me nuts\" short list: Using \"insure\" when it should be \"ensure.\" That error is so frequently mentioned in lists of common mistakes that it really ought not to be found in a published work like this.\n\nOverall, it was just so-so for me. I finished it, in spite of not enjoying it all that much, because I wanted to see how the author would complete Joanna's story.\n\nMay 16, 2020\n\nGood\n\nIt was a good read but I did find that I skimmed through some parts. Mainly the sections on the churches as they were much to descriptive for me. Good characters and dialogue and I enjoyed learning about the relationship between William and Joanna.\n\nNovember 27, 2016\n\nAn imaginative evocation of the life of the daughter of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine who married the King of Sicily and was one of the company that traveled with the the Third Crusade. According to the author she researched the book by traveling to Spain, France, England, Cyprus, Sicily. She would have been better off spending the time in the library since the research is very shallow and contains little detail to evoke the time period of the story.\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nThe Unknown Princess\n\nThis was an interesting, heartfelt read as we follow Princess Joanna on her life journey as Queen of Sicily, to Countess of Toulouse, to nun. Joanna's mother is a well known and popular Queen. There are so many books about Eleanor of Aquitaine. I enjoyed reading about her daughter and getting a glimpse of the Plantegent family dynamic.\n\nJanuary 29, 2022\n\nPlantagenant\n\nAs I read this book after several years of reading about this family, I wasn't to sure of what was fact or fiction. A totally different read of what I had read before and a much more believable read.\n\nI wondered as I read what this authors own spiritual journey might have been. Not knowing how true this story is.\n\nGood book!Well written! Thank you!\n\nMarch 11, 2020\n\nAlthough the book was written according to a historical event in my opinion it came down to descriptions of architecture and wardrobe. There is no deeper connection between the characters. Too sweet and without much drama even though those times were pretty dramatic.But it can be read.\n\nJune 11, 2015\n\nI enjoyed the book. I found it to be historically true. For long years, I have been very interested in the Plantaganets and their reign, all the way down to my most favorite, Richard III. There was only one problem I had with this book. Dear, sweet, Joanna took an age to die! I kept expecting that I would turn the page to finally read The End, but no, Joanna took one more breath and lived on. Page after dreadfully-sick-Joanna page, she lived on. The woman had lived a terribly, mostly unloved life, the author should have condensed her dying to a peaceful few paragraphs telling the reader how she spent her dying last weeks instead of taking us through each day. Joanna's wonderful mother, the indomitable Queen Eleanor, if l,u\n\nfeatures in the book as do Joanna's two famous brothers, kings Richard the Lionheart and poor misunderstood John. All in all, the book is a great one to read. I highly recommend it, along with the author's other two about Queens in the same period. Great reading!!\n\nApril 10, 2015\n\nVery engaging book\n\nI enjoyed reading about the historical figures, some that I knew by name, most not. Ms. Bard made them come to life throughout the story. I also enjoyed the thorough descriptions of the various abbies, palaces and towns."
