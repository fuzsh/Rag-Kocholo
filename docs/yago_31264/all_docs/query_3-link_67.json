        "text": "You will find her in the fourth room of the Regional Gallery of Sicily, located in Palermo’s imposing 15th century Palazzo Abatellis: a ‘gentlewoman said to be Eleanor of Aragon’, beautiful, refined and serene.\n\nThe work is small, no more than 50cm or so high, and made of white marble. Its purity and perfection is striking. There is a stillness and quiet dignity about the face –a delicacy and ‘completeness’ about the work. Perhaps that, in itself, should have been enough, and in a way it was. But Palazzo Abatellis is a favourite place; I visit quite often and the more I saw this work, the more I wanted to know about it; about the sculptor, Francesco Laurana, and about Eleanor herself.\n\nSo I set about doing some investigation. I didn’t find all I was looking for, but at least I know a little more than I did before – and the exercise has been an interesting one.\n\nEleanor’s image, or, more precisely, that of Francesco Laurana, has become something of an icon of Palermo. Reproductions appear regularly on book covers and travel brochures, and, in 2005, when Palermo’s waterfront area was being beautified after almost sixty years of neglect and abuse, Eleanor’s profile was even reproduced in the colourful little ceramic bollards that line the grassy areas. It has taken me some time to see the likeness, but finally I think I’ve done it. (See the image below).\n\nGiven that the image has become so popular, it was surprisingly difficult to get behind it.\n\nIt was easy enough to find information about Francesco Laurana (1430 – 1502), who is a well-known sculptor of the period, famous, in particular, for his marble busts of women. He was born in Dalmatia and spent time working in France and various parts of Italy, including some time working in Sicily. The bust of Eleanor of Aragon seems generally to be regarded as one of his finest works.\n\nIdentifying Eleanor of Aragon proved more difficult. Because Sicily was ruled by the powerful ‘Spanish’ state of Aragon in the 14th and 15th centuries, I assumed that Eleanor would be part of the ruling family and easy to identify. Not at all! I found numerous ‘Eleanors’ of Aragon; several had connections to Sicily, but none seemed to be the Eleanor of Aragon I was looking for. Then I discovered that some scholars have concluded that the sculpture is not, in fact, a representation of Eleanor of Aragon at all, but, rather, of a Neapolitan princess.\n\nI seemed to be going round in circles, getting nowhere, when I came upon what seems to me, at this stage at least, to be the most likely story: the bust represents an Eleanor of Aragon who was the granddaughter of the King of Sicily, King Frederick of Aragon.\n\nAlthough this Eleanor of Aragon had died in 1405, i.e. long before Laurana’s bust was created, the work was commissioned by a powerful Sicilian called Carlo Luna who regarded Eleanor as an illustrious ancestor because she had been married to Luna’s ancestor, the Count of Caltabellottante. The sculpture was originally placed on her tomb at the Abbey of S. Maria del Bosco di Calatamauro, in the south of Sicily, where it remained until the end of the 19th century when it was transferred to the Museo Nazionale of Palermo.\n\nAccording to this explanation, the idealised and formal nature of the sculpture is partly explained by the fact that the subject was long deceased.\n\nThis is the most likely explanation I have found so far, and it will do for the moment. Still, I’m not totally convinced and will keep investigating. In the end, though, I don’t really care. However this little sculpture came about, and whoever its subject, I will continue to visit it from time to time to experience and admire its haunting beauty."
