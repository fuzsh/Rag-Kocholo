        "text": "Rediscovering the life of an outstanding sovereign who played a fundamental role in the political life of the 14th century, something that made her one of the Crown of Aragon's only lieutenants.\n\nBiography of an alliance\n\nTo speak of Eleanor of Sicily is to speak of an independent and outstanding woman. She was ambitious, authoritarian and an inveterate traveller. Also known as Eleonor the Grand, her merits were such that she became an essential and unreplaceable advisor to her husband, Pere III, the Ceremonious, and she had her own palace, something quite unusual at the time, located in the heart of the old centre of Barcelona on the corner of Carrer dels Templars and Carrer d'Ataulf.\n\nBorn in 1325 to the distinguished court of Sicily, Eleanor was the second daughter of Elizabeth of Carinthia and Peter ll of Sicily's six children. Halfway through the 14th century, after being widowed for a second time, Pere III, the Ceremonious, asked for her hand in marriage and she saw the occasion as an opportunity to escape from her native land and her own family and, despite the fact that some opposed the alliance with the Crown of Aragon, they were married in Valencia in 1349. Three years later an even more important event took place when, under the watchful eyes of the nobility of the day, a nobility that wanted to see in this union an end to the disputes between the Sicilian Catalans (supporters of the king) and his pro-Angevin opponents (supporters of the House of Anjou), the queen consort was crowned by her husband. Eleanor and Pere had four children: John l of Aragon (the Hunter), Martin l of Aragon (the Humane), Alfonso of Aragon (died young) and Eleanor of Aragon and Sicily.\n\nRoyal Tomb (Cactus Media)\n\nCoat of arms of Peter III the Ceremonious at the Royal Gate of the Monastery of Poblet (Oliver-Bonjoch, Wikimedia Commons)\n\nAn exceptional coronation\n\nEleanor is one of only five queens to be crowned during the many years of the Crown of Aragon. A symbolic act of finality, legitimacy and propaganda with a very clear ordinances. In Eleanor's case these were preceded by the quotation of a very illuminating text that helps understand the space commanded by women within the political realm of Catalonia during the middle ages.\n\nIt is a quotation taken from the Book of Genesis, and it is a metaphor that explains the way this coronation was to be understood. Without this preliminary explanation the coronation would not have been considered legitimate by a society that did not permit women to wield the power of the Crown. The biblical reference is to the idea, widely accepted by everyone at that time, that woman was created by God to accompany man in his solitude and, on account of this, was created from Adam's rib, given that only through man was it possible to create the first woman, Eve.\n\nThe Crown of Aragon had a distinctive feature with respect to other kingdoms, such as the kingdom of Castile, in that it prohibited queens from governing with equal powers as men, since the power of queens was intrinsically linked to that of their husbands. Nevertheless, there was considerable room for manoeuvre with respect to the relationship established between the king and the queen. When the king had full confidence in his queen and together they constituted an insoluble unit, the queen had access to the lieutenantship, which is to say that she could exercise maximum authority during the absence of the king, and Eleanor of Sicily was one of the few queens to attain this position.\n\nView of Zaragoza from the river, the city where he was crowned (Carabo_Spain, Pixabay)\n\nLieutenantship: a loophole in royal legislation\n\nThis position was created by Jaume I to satisfy his need for someone to ensure that his sons were in charge of everything while he was out of the kingdom. The role of the person occupying this institutional position was therefore to stand in for him when he wasn't there, to represent him and to defend his interests. Who better then, than the queen for such a role? Anyone else could represent a real danger for the stability of the kingdom since it potentially opened the way for plots to usurp royal power. But with his wife in charge, as long as there was a good relationship between them both, the king had no reason to worry and could leave the kingdom with peace of mind, knowing that the lieutenant queen would use these delegated powers responsibly.\n\nHis peace of mind would also have been helped by the favourable position the Crown of Aragon found itself in and, when the king left, he was in a position to create networks of influence and demonstrate the kingdom's commitment to culture through patronage. Furthermore, if queens were foreign they contributed to improving foreign relations since they created or reinforced alliances, a very valuable diplomatic function.\n\nEleanor of Sicily was a very worthy lieutenant queen. She was able to implement her own policies and even make controversial decisions such as initiating the process that would lead to the beheading of the royal advisor Bernat de Cabrera in 1364, who had been accused of being the instigator of the war with Castile. Eleanor also had a leading role in political relations between the kingdoms of Sicily and Sardinia, as well as in the creation of the Duchy of Girona in 1351, when the counties of Besalú, Girona, Empúries and Osona were merged, leading shortly afterwards to the title of Prince of Girona.\n\nTomb of Eleanor of Sicily (Cactus Media)\n\nLesser Royal Palace of Barcelona (Wikimedia Commons)"
