        "text": "Elizabeth of Carinthia (around 1300 -around 1352) was born to Otto III of Carinthia and Euphemia of Silesia-Liegntiz. Nothing is known about her life prior her marriage to Peter II of Trinacria, which took place in Messina on April 23rd 1323. Peter had been made co-regent of his father Frederick II (III) the year before. On February 1324 in Messina Elizabeth gave birth to a male heir, Frederick. Unluckily, the baby boy died a few months later. Followed five daughters (Constance, Eleanor Queen of Aragon, Beatrice Countess Palatine of the Rhine, Euphemia, Violante). On February 4th 1338 in Catania Elizabeth gave birth once more to a male heir, Louis. The stability of the reign seemed to be assured after the birth of two more sons in 1340 and 1341: John (who would die in 1353) and Frederick. Their last surviving child would be another girl, Blanche, born in 1342 and who will later become Countess of Ampurias. On June 25th 1337 Elisabeth’s father-in.law, Frederick II, died. Peter II was a weak and easily manipulated man. His wife tried to influence him to grant stability and peace to the reign. With the help of her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Naples, she made various attempt to reconcile or at least mediate between the two feuding Houses of Aragon and Anjou. The two women are were closer to the Latin faction (which tended to be more tolerant towards the French family and former ruler) as opposed to the Catalan one. Eleanor supported the Chiaramonte family, while Elisabeth was close to the brothers Matteo and Damiano Palizzi. Elizabeth and Eleanor’s efforts were undoed the moment Peter reconciliated with his brother John and Blasco I Alagona, baron of Salemi, exponents of the Catalan faction. All the Queen could do was to intercede with her husband to help her proteges. Thanks to her help, the Palizzi were able to leave Sicily in 1340 and save their life. On August 15th 1342 Peter II died in Calascibetta (modern-day province of Enna). Elizabeth was left out the government of the Kingdom, while Peter’s brother John acted as Regent for his young nephew. The now widow Queen demanded and obtained for her five years old son Louis to be crowned King of Trinacria. This way she managed to contain her brother-in-law’s power. In 1347 the Black Death arrived in Sicily and spread through the island and then all over Europe. It is unsure how many victims it made, what’s sure is that among them there was the Regent John, who died on April 7th 1348 in Randazzo (modern-day province of Catania) . Elizabeth was now free to act as Regent for her now ten years old son. Now that her brother-in-law was dead, the Queen Mother aimed to support the Latin faction represented by the Chiaramonte and Palizzi families. For this reason, Matteo Palizzi was called back from his exile and was nominated Vicar of the Kingdom. She also managed to snatch young Louis from Blasco Alagona’s control and incited the people of Messina to revolt against him. In July 1348 Elizabeth moved to Montalbano Elicona (modern-day province of Messina) where she could easily meet with Matteo Palizzi. Her last public act was to call the Parliament in Lentini (modern-day province of Siracusa) in 1349 with the purpose to gather a coalition against Alagona. After that, everything becomes unclear. She might have died of plague as late as 1352. She was buried in St. Francis Church, Messina.\n\nConstance of Sicily (1324-1355) was firstborn of Peter II of Trinacria and his wife Elizabeth of Carinthia. She was also Abbess of the Franciscan Nunnery of St. Clare, Messina. After her mother’s death in 1352, Constance became regent of Sicily in the name of her brother, Louis. During her regency she had to face political struggles between the two factions as well as the desolation caused by the plague. Black Death claimed more royal victims when even Constance and the King got infected. Louis died on October 16th 1355, and his sister followed him less than a week later. Constance died on October 22 or 23nd."
