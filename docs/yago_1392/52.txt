Praying with Anger (1992) was the directorial debut of M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan directed, produced, wrote and starred in the film, which was about a young Indian American's return to India. To date, the film has been shown primarily at film festivals and never received a wide release for mainstream distribution. It has gradually developed a cult following as a work exploring the clash of Western values with those of the Indian subcontinent.
