        "text": "Perhaps the most surprising thing about Knock at the Cabin, M. Night Shyamalan’s apocalyptic, assuredly twisty thriller which is out today, is just how much press the director is doing for the film. For a good stretch of the Noughties, the director’s name was a punchline. Or a warning that the movie would have been better left as a trailer. The problem was not being a bad director (there are many of those), but that he had set such a high bar with his break-out film, The Sixth Sense. The films that followed were very much not The Sixth Sense. Shyamalan’s name brought shivers to anyone with a fear of setting very high expectations and then failing to deliver.\n\nIn 2023, Shyamalan’s name is a selling point again. How many directors appear on talk shows? The renaissance is partly down to an uptick in quality (somewhere around 2015’s The Visit), a revision of those earlier films (maybe, The Village isn’t so terrible after all), and the revelation that Shyamalan’s most valuable asset is a point of view. It’s no surprise that people have flocked to his films – either out of love or scorn – as Netflix reaches saturation point. You may not always like the twists, you may think the premises are dumb, but at least you can tell you’re watching a Shyamalan film. Here’s our ranking of the movies he has directed, apart from his very first, 1992’s Praying with Anger, which never had a wide release.\n\n13. The Last Airbender (2010)\n\nShyamalan’s remake of a beloved animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, in which an “Avatar” must unite warring kingdoms, is correctly reviled for many reasons: its goofy special effects, its white-washed casting, and its infidelity to the gentle, big-hearted source material. The definitive low point in Shyamalan’s career.\n\n12. After Earth (2013)\n\nIn this apocalyptic sci-fi, Will Smith and son Jaden crash to Earth a thousand years after humans have evacuated the planet. Very tediously, they then have to work out a route home to their space colony. The plot is as convoluted as it is uninspiring. And Will Smith, like Shyamalan, was in a career slump at the time. This film helped neither of them.\n\n11. Lady in the Water (2006)\n\nShyamalan certainly has a taste for setting: Lady in the Water’s apartment complex surroundings provides the fantasy, about a mystical being making contact from another world, the intriguing feel of an urban legend. Unfortunately, whatever the film is trying to say is both overwrought and dull, and the director’s extended appearance in the film evoked Icarus, rather than a capable craftsman.\n\n10. Split (2016)\n\nIn Split, James McAvoy plays 23 characters. As Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with dissociative identity disorder, he must control those dangerous personalities. Things, inevitably, go awry. He ends up kidnapping three girls (one of them is Anya Taylor-Joy, another is Haley Lu Richardson) in an underground lair. Psychological warfare ensues. Though McAvoy’s performance is undeniable, the film’s exploitation is never challenged, resulting in a mean-spirited and unpleasant viewing experience.\n\n9. Glass (2019)\n\nShyamalan’s effort to build on his own mythology – merging characters from Unbreakable and Split – resulted in a mixed affair. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson return from Unbreakable, while James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy reunite after Split. The imaginative premise, Willis and McAvoy must convince others of their powers, is let down by a messy storyline and a cast who never seem to know quite what to go for.\n\n8. The Happening (2008)\n\nA mysterious attack causes people to kill themselves; a husband and wife (played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) have to find a way to survive. The film, as with most of Shyamalan’s in this period, was mauled by critics and audiences alike. But there are things to like: Shyamalan’s gift for suspense, some truly chilling images, and most of all, the film has a very earnest, dopey heart.\n\n7. Wide Awake (1998)\n\nBefore The Sixth Sense launched him into household name territory, Shyamalan would try his hand at a coming-of-age comedy drama. Wide Awake follows ten-year-old Joshua (Joseph Cross) as he deals with the loss of his grandfather at a Catholic boys’ school (where Rosie O’Donnell is a nun). The film is sweet enough for a watch, with hallmarks which would make the director’s name. Shyamalan’s ability to convey a child’s point of view – the confusion and questioning – is charming, and the late-act reveal is less groan inducing than other entries on this list. In 1998, it probably seemed very novel.\n\n6. The Visit (2015)\n\nWe reach the comeback section of this ranking. Shyamalan funded this film by borrowing $5 million against his own home. His gamble paid off: it eventually grossed over $98 million against that budget.\n\nIt’s a sign that Shyamalan is most successful when he skews simple. In this found-footage film, two children are sent to live with their grandparents for a week. It’s all going swimmingly – with regular interludes from mum Kathryn Hahn – until the grandma and grandpa start acting out. The reveal, when it comes, is simple enough to be chilling, and even when the action spins out towards the end, as it must, the film is far more clear-sighted than others.\n\n5. Old (2021)\n\nA very beautiful holidaying couple, played by Vicky Krieps and Gael Garcia Bernal, and their children stumble upon a beach which appears to age you in hours. That it plays out against family dynamics, with children watching their parents grow up (and vice versa) only heightens the emotional intensity. The explanation, ultimately, is very stupid, but the surrounding characters are a delight here, in particular Rufus Sewell’s narcissistic surgeon. If you head into this film with appropriate expectations, they will be pleasantly surpassed.\n\n4. The Village (2004)\n\nIn 19thcentury Pennsylvania, villagers live in fear of the monsters that roam the surrounding woods. What happens when those terrors cross boundaries? It’s the stuff of classic fairy tales, and Shyamalan’s evocation of a claustrophobic, terrified society is timeless. It’s Shyamalan’s most adeptly cast film, too, with Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrien Brody playing off one another’s paranoia. That twist – perhaps the director’s second most famous flourish – was divisive, but it really works in context of the film’s mediation on grief and identity.\n\n3. Unbreakable (2000)\n\nIn this drizzly thriller, David Dunn (regular Shyamalan collaborator Bruce Willis) survives a train crash unscathed, which leads him down an intriguing path: is he actually a superhero? The late Nineties setting appeals, as does the cast: Samuel L. Jackson is an unhinged comic book nerd, while Robin Wright plays a despairing wife. A pleasingly rainy, understated entry into the superhero canon (and much better than the sequels, which arrived decades later).\n\n2. Signs (2002)\n\nSigns works because Shyamalan knows to balance horror with heart. In the Mel Gibson-fronted thriller, one rural Pennsylvania family becomes the centre of extra-terrestrial drama when crop circles appear in their fields. Gibson runs about like a sorrowful action man (naturally, he has a dead wife) trying to support his children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and brother (Joaquin Phoenix). Is the threat real? What, or who, do we choose to believe? This atmospheric number is also evidence of Shyamalan’s visual flair.\n\n1. The Sixth Sense (1999)\n\nThe Sixth Sense’s twist looms so large that it’s easy to forget that there’s a tightly-written, sweet story underneath it all. Child psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis) is treating Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled kid who can see ghosts. The performances – from Osment, Willis and Toni Collette – are lived-in and charming, and the film’s structure is as tight as a Henry James ghost story. Like the best supernatural tales, it is both creepy and cosy.\n\nIt it often entirely possible that a film is more enjoyable once you know the twist, and The Sixth Sense makes a good case for it. It was rewarded with six Oscar nominations, including a Best Director nod, which set Shyamalan up for a lifetime of promise or delusion – delete per your preference."
