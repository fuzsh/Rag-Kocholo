        "text": "Famed movie director M. Night Shyamalan’s career has had its ups and downs. Known for his unpredictable plot twists, he’s managed to maintain a Hollywood presence, even though his films have seen varied reactions. With the recent release of his 16th film, ‘Trap’, it’s a good time to investigate his movie archives. Let’s unravel both the gems and the misfires of Shyamalan’s film history.\n\nThe Setbacks\n\n1. ‘The Last Airbender’ (2010): Often marked as Shyamalan’s downfall, this film left viewers shaking their heads in disappointment. In an attempt to adapt a beloved series, the result was unimpressive visuals and below-average acting.\n\n2. ‘After Earth’ (2013): This film wasn’t quite a reflection of Shyamalan’s usual creativity; it felt more like a gig for the director than a passion project. Will Smith took most of the blame, courtesy of a weak narrative.\n\n3. ‘Wide Awake’ (1998): This film didn’t meet expectations. Pitched as a comedy, it failed to hit the humor sweet spot and was deemed overly sentimental and tiring.\n\n4. ‘The Happening’ (2008): Despite holding promise, the film could not leave a lasting impact. Amateurs in casting and a storyline drowned in too much explanation managed to spoil a potentially thrilling tale.\n\nSlightly Disappointing Outings\n\n5. ‘Lady in the Water’ (2006): This film combined creativity and confusion, leaving viewers perplexed about Shyamalan’s objectives.\n\n6. ‘Praying with Anger’ (1992): Shyamalan’s first film certainly showed potential. Still, it lacked compelling acting and striking visuals.\n\n7. ‘Glass’ (2019): This much-anticipated sequel to ‘Unbreakable’ fell short due to perplexing writing and an unclear plot structure.\n\nSecond Wind Successes\n\n8. ‘Trap’ (2024): Despite a captivating narrative, the film’s unnecessarily lengthy third act upset the viewers. However, Josh Hartnett’s worthy performance shone brightly.\n\n9. ‘Old’ (2021): Despite internet memes about the plot, ‘Old’ managed to captivate viewers with its deep portrayal of humanity and corporate greed.\n\n10. ‘Knock at the Cabin’ (2023): This film from last year demonstrated Shyamalan’s imaginative prowess and ability to create nail-biting thrillers filled with emotional moments.\n\n11. ‘Split’ (2016): A return to Shyamalan’s glory days, ‘Split’ was a success, thanks to James McAvoy’s outstanding acting and despite some sketchy science.\n\nNoteworthy Triumphs\n\n12. ‘The Visit’ (2015): The film cleverly combined ‘found footage’ to spark fear, giving viewers a fresh taste of Shyamalan’s talent.\n\n13. ‘The Village’ (2004): With an amazing cast and stunning visuals, this film proved that Shyamalan is a truly engaging storyteller.\n\n14. ‘Signs’ (2002): Combining elements of horror with deep philosophy, ‘Signs’ remains one of Shyamalan’s most heartfelt films.\n\nCrowning Achievements\n\n15. ‘The Sixth Sense’ (1999): As Shyamalan’s breakthrough film, it bagged high praise for exceptional writing, impressive direction, and memorable performances.\n\n16. ‘Unbreakable’ (2000): This film still tops the list, showcasing Shyamalan’s cinematic genius and confirming his position among Hollywood’s most inventive story-tellers.\n\nAs we peek into the future, ‘Trap’ promises another thrill ride from the master of plot twists. Like we’ve seen with Shyamalan, expect the unexpected when it comes to his career path. Stay tuned for more fascinating news from the entertainment realm as we follow this intriguing journey.\n\nFor more details, visit Project Casting Blog on https://www.projectcasting.com/blog/news/unraveling-m-night-shyamalans-movie-rankings-amid-trap-release/"
