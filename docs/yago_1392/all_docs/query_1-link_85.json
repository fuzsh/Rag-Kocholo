        "text": "The horror roots grow deep in the Shyamalan family as M. Night's daughter, Ishana Shyamalan makes her directorial debut this summer with The Watchers, and we have our first trailer.\n\nYoung artist Mina finds herself stranded in an expansive, untouched forest in western Ireland. Upon finding shelter, she unknowingly becomes trapped alongside three strangers who are watched and stalked by mysterious creatures each night. Mina is desperate for answers about who are the Watchers.\n\nMuch like her father's taste for less is more, the teaser gives you a whisp of a concept but still withholds the main threat for now. Night has worked with her father on his Apple TV+ series, Servant as a co-producer, writer, and director. She also worked as a second unit director on his film, Old.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by A. M. Shine, the film stars Dakota Fanning, Georgina Campbell, Oliver Finnegan, and Olwen Fouéré. Filming took place last summer and is scheduled to be theatrically released on June 14."
