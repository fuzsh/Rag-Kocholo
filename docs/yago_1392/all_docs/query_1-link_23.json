        "text": "M. Night Shyamalan has become one of the most successful directors in Hollywood during the 21st century. However, people from Philadelphia actually know him best for his roots in the area and his insistence on filming his movies locally.\n\nRenowned Director M. Night Shyamalan\n\nShyamalan emigrated to the United States from India at a young age, and he grew up in the Lower Merion area of the Main Line. He attended Waldron Mercy in Merion Station in grade school and Episcopal Academy in high school.\n\nHis background in the Philadelphia area has shaped his career in the movie industry in a unique way.\n\nHit movies like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable helped him hit the scene. Their easily recognizable locations in Philadelphia endeared him locally as a national celebrity who leans into connections in his de facto hometown.\n\nChances are you’ve met at least one or two people with stories about how you can see their friends as a background extra in an M. Night Shyamalan film. You might’ve seen him at the Wells Fargo Center for a 76ers game. Shyamalan also hosts Shyamaween every October in Fishtown to raise money for his charity foundation.\n\nThe M. Night Shyamalan Twist\n\nSome of the most ironic and creatively original plot twists you’ll ever see take place in M. Night Shyamalan movies.\n\nThe stunning ending of The Sixth Sense established the twist as his personal calling card.\n\nAnother memorable and clever twist in The Village used the idea of the stream of consciousness to brilliantly trick the viewer into a specific perception.\n\nThe unique style has translated especially well in Shyamalan’s horror movies, and the Philadelphia area has flawlessly provided the right locations for the eerie settings that add to the suspense."
