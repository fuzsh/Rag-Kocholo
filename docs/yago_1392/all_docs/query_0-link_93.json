        "text": "This book is the first comprehensive presentation of M. Night Shyamalan's oeuvre, from his early work, “Praying with Anger” to his last film, “Knock at the Cabin”. In some chapters, the reflective essays focus primarily on the production history of the films and the description of their main plot; while in other parts, the director's biography is echoed as well.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the book is not an analysis and not even critical at all, but it is rather an objective, entertaining and interesting piece of writing in which, of course, after a short introduction, the history of each film along with the central storyline (without too much spoiler), the main characters together with the actors who perform them are presented. In the individual chapters, some data, pictures and compelling information about each work are introduced about which the majority of viewers and fans may not have heard before. With the help of this book it is my unconcealed intention to draw people’s attention to Mr. Shyamalan’s previous works and to arose their interest in his future films as well.\n\nThe book also attempts to meet the expected professional requirements as it includes references, indications of the used source materials, and is written in a sophisticated tone of voice, however, its language is perfectly intelligible to contemporary readers.\n\nThis is a truly entertaining e-book containing illustrations. As for the genre, this book is close to a biography, however, it mainly focuses on the director's works. So the book summarizes the famous film director's work so far and presents the films he has directed in chronological order. In addition to providing an insight into the production background of the films, each chapter describes its story and main plot as well as its main roles and the stars, captivating behind-the-scenes stories and rumours related to each work.\n\nIn the book, I also introduce the makers of each film, the producers and the production companies, the editor, the cinematographer, the composer, and I share a lot of useful data, information and critical reviews with the reader. I attempted to write a book which not only tends to be informative, but also entertains, makes people feel like watching the movies, no matter whether they are Mr. Shyamalan's very early works or his lately directed films."
