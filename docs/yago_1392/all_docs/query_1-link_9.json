He spent his first six weeks in Puducherry, and then was raised in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia.\n\nShyamalan made his first film, the semi-autobiographical drama Praying with Anger, while still an NYU student, using money borrowed from family and friends. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. He wrote and directed his second movie, Wide Awake, in 1995, though it was not released until 1998.\n\nHis most well-received films include the supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense (1999), the superhero thriller Unbreakable (2000), the science fiction thriller Signs (2002) and the period-piece thriller The Village (2004). For The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nShyamalan also released the found footage horror film The Visit (2015) and the psychological thriller Split (2016). His latest film is the superhero thriller Glass (2019), which is the third and final chapter of his Unbreakable film series."
