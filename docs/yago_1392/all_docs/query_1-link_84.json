        "text": "In cutting the trailer to his new film Trap, M. Night Shyamalan set one of his own – he gave away what appears to be a titanic spoiler.\n\nHere’s a doting dad (Josh Hartnett) taking his tween daughter to a Taylor Swift-style pop concert. It’s not really his scene but he loves his little girl, and he’s happy because she’s happy. So, there they are, among tens of thousands of screaming fans, as the lights come down and the Swift-a-like comes on. It’s a moving portrayal of the sort of lengths good dads will go for their daughters.\n\nOnly, hold on, dad needs the loo. So off he pops, leaving her in their seats. In the foyer, he notices a suspiciously heightened police presence – armed cops on the doors and in the stairwells. Then a hotdog seller tells him the whole thing’s a huge-scale sting operation to snare a serial killer called “The Butcher”.\n\nBut wait… here’s the twist: we've already met The Butcher. Can you guess who he is?\n\nWe can of course assume that – given who’s behind the wheel here – a twist so early is clearly just foreplay, a whistle-wetter, a slap and tickle of a revelation. This is an M. Night Shyamalan movie and we paid for a proper climax.\n\nBut there’s something else about the story. It’s based, albeit loosely, on a real-life police operation from the 1980s. And let it be said, as police stings go, you'll struggle to find a more remarkable one anywhere in history.\n\nA good F.I.S.T. of it\n\nIt was 1985, and America's streets were awash with more on-the-run criminals than a Batman movie. There were convicted rapists who’d skipped bail, muggers, robbers, arsonists, fraudsters, drug dealers and more. Many, many thousands of them. They’d all escaped justice and were lying low in getaway bliss.\n\nTrouble was, the law’s arm just wasn’t long enough to scoop them all up at once. So the U.S. Marshal Department came up with a plan. They called it the Fugitive Investigative Strike Team. F.I.S.T. for short. And, between 1981 and 1986, they made a pretty good F.I.S.T. of it.\n\nJosh Hartnett in ’Trap’\n\nIn New York City, officers invented a courier service, the \"Brooklyn Bridge Delivery Service,\" to lure criminals with the promise of a “valuable” package that needed picking up. In Buffalo, they devised a scheme notifying fugitives of substantial lottery winnings, ranging from $250 to $10,000. In Hartford, Connecticut, younger felons were targeted with the promise of a VIP experience at a Boy George concert, complete with dinner and limousine service.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two things all criminals who get caught have in common: greed and stupidity. So, when they showed up to collect their “prizes”, officers swooped.\n\nAcross nine major operations, F.I.S.T. captured more than 15,000 fugitives in a range of ever-more creative stings, from California to New York to the Caribbean.\n\nThe most famous, and by far the most audacious, was Operation Flagship.\n\nOperation Flagship: The Build Up\n\nIt was the winter of 1985. Across Washington D.C., some 3,000 fugitives were going about their stolen lives as free men and women. But like many criminals, they each had one weakness: an insatiable desire for material gain.\n\nBack at F.I.S.T. HQ, a plan had been incubating, and was ready to hatch. Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Tobias P. Roche, who had led the Boy George hoodwink in Connecticut a year earlier, had noticed a recent groundswell in support for the Washington Redskins football team. They were having a barnstorming season and were in with a shout at making the playoffs. They just had to win a few more games.\n\nOne of those games was at home against the Cincinnati Bengals. It was a sellout; tickets were rarer than salad on a hotdog.\n\n\"When I first came to Washington, I realised talking to people how hard it was to get tickets to Redskins games,\" Roche told the Washington Post in 1985. “[And] this was a pivotal game for the Redskins, so that was a little luck for us.\"\n\nThe plan was simple. They would write to the last-known address of every fugitive on the list – all 3,000 of them – offering them the chance to win: 1) complimentary tickets to the Redskins-Cincinnati game, 2) a chance to win 1986 season tickets, and 3) entry into a raffle to win a trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nMeanwhile, they came up with a fake company called Flagship International Sports Television to offer the prizes, to be given out at a “winners’ Sunday brunch” held at the D.C. Convention Center by the stadium.\n\nBy now, U.S. marshals were starting to have fun. The invitation letters they sent out were signed by \"I. Michael Detnaw\" -- \"wanted\" spelled backwards. When the fugitives called the hotline to confirm their attendance, an operator would redirect them to Flagship's business manager “Mr Cran” – “narc” spelled backwards. When they were put on hold, I Fought the Law played in the background.\n\nNot just Any Given Sunday...\n\nWhen gameday arrived, on Sunday 15 December, the team got there early – 5.30am – to set up. They had pulled together a squad of 166 marshals and police officers to play a host of roles, from hotdog sellers to cleaners, mascots to cheerleaders. One officer dressed up as a chicken. Others held bunches of balloons, while some played tourists with camcorders. Everyone was armed.\n\nAfter six weeks of training and three dry runs, they were ready.\n\nBy 8am their marks began to arrive. Female officers dressed as cheerleaders did a welcome dance. They hugged and put their arms round them – really just a well-rehearsed excuse to frisk them for weapons. Two guns were confiscated. To make the scene even more believable, some officers sang Redskin chants and wore merch from the team shop.\n\n\"You have to make the situation believable,\" said Roche, \"and put people in the psychological frame of mind to be at ease.\"\n\nThey handed out \"Hello, my name is . . .\" name tags to arriving guests before escorting them to a party room on the second floor. \"Some were ecstatic,\" Roche added. \"Some were reserved. They were looking forward to the game. Some were dressed up in Redskins outfits.\"\n\nThen, when all the gullible attendees were in their seats, Louie McKinney, chief of enforcement operations for the U.S. Marshals, took to the stage in top hat and tails to welcome them... then arrest them. A few seconds into his speech, he uttered the codeword “surprise” and 25 heavily-armed SWAT officers burst in and surrounded the fugitives.\n\nIn the end, the sting led to the capture of 101 fugitives in what became one of the largest and most successful mass arrests in U.S. history.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the result was \"15 warrants for assault, five for robbery, six for burglary, four for escape, 19 for bond default or bail violation, 18 for narcotics violations, 59 for probation or parole violation and 41 for a variety of charges from rape to arson to forgery.\"\n\nSilence of the Lambs at a Taylor Swift gig?\n\nShyamalan told Empire how he sold the idea to backers: \"what if Silence of the Lambs happened at a Taylor Swift concert?\"\n\nHe said the concept came from two distinct places in his heart: his own childhood, and his own child. His daughter is, of course, the hip hop star Saleka who plays the Swift-modelled popstar Lady Raven in the movie.\n\n\"There were many stages to the movie’s incarnation, and the last part of that incarnation was after Saleka and I talked about what we wanted to make the format, all that stuff,\" he told Dexerto. “After I was thinking, ‘Hey, this could be a killer that’s in there,’ this notion came to me of, I remember as a kid, this event that happened in the 80s where the police and the FBI created a sting operation at a public event.”\n\nHe added: “The tone of that absurdity – that you were dancing with them [the cheerleaders] and then your life was over on that day – stuck with me as really strange and wonderful. And so we kind of took that language.”\n\n'Trap' is in cinemas on 9 August"
