        "text": "\"30,000 Pop Star Fans. 300 Cops. 1 Serial Killer. No Escape.\" Hell yes this is going to be awesome!! WB has debuted the second official trailer for the next M. Night Shyamalan movie titled Trap, arriving in theaters in August in just another month. The first trailer dropped back in April, but this looks even better now. He's going to mess with the whole concert! Ha. Josh Hartnett stars as a father who takes his daughter to a pop star concert (inspired by Taylor Swift or Lady Gaga). However, while there they discover that the concert is all a setup to catch a serial killer. But who is the killer? He is. Yep... But that can't be the only big spoiler?! I also have a feeling Shyamalan has worked in a few other big twists that we don't know about yet... The cast includes Ariel Donoghue, Saleka Shyamalan performing as Lady Raven, Hayley Mills, and Allison Pill. With cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (of Call Me by Your Name) and a score by Herdĭs Stefănsdŏttir. I so cannot wait to see this! It's going to be wicked good, with tons of clever twists and traps and sneaky things happening. Anyone else reminded of JCVD's classic Sudden Death watching this trailer?\n\nHere's the second trailer (+ new poster) for M. Night Shyamalan's film Trap, direct from WB's YouTube:\n\nYou rewatch the initial official trailer for Shyamalan's Trap movie right here, to view the first look again."
