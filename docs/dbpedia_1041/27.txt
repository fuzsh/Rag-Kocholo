4 Mar â€“ Japanese actress Natsuna Watanabe recently announced the birth of her first child.

On 1 March, the "Gantz" star posted a photo of her baby's tiny feet on Instagram, writing, "The other day, I gave birth to a healthy baby girl. It didn't seem real to me until she was born, and I was in partial doubt when I saw her moving in my stomach. But then she was born, and I was like, ah, she's there!"

Natsuna added that childbirth felt like a dream to her, and that even though there was pain, there was joy too.

"I want to cherish every second of every day from now on," she added.

It was back in January last year that Natsuna announced that she has married her non-celebrity boyfriend.

She announced her pregnancy in September via her agency last year as she entered her second trimester.
