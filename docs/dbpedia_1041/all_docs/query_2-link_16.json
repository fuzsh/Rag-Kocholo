        "text": "Real Footage in film\n\nConsidering it’s been ages since I’ve watched any hard hitting dramas or tear-jerking kid’s movies, it’s probably fair to say films haven’t really moved me emotionally lately. Whenever I get time off with my girlfriend, we’re usually jumping on top of a good thriller with a sizable plot to make sense of or we’re simply keeping up with our back log of TV shows to troll through.\n\nThe last time I remember being really shaken up by a film was watching Bowling For Columbine, and not just the first time I watched it, but each subsequent time I’ve watched it from beginning to end. It might sound like it’s getting to the point where I should be asking myself why I’m doing this, but it’s very much the kind of film that I feel comfortable to let my guard down and connect with something that seems to have an inherent intellectual and emotional value to the viewing audience. Yes, it takes a rational, thought-provoking documentary from Michael Moore for me to have a proper emotional fragility in watching a movie now-days. Just last week, I was watching one of the film deconstructions by CineFix on Youtube and realised it’s really pretty backwards – all movies should have to opportunity to break us down, that’s why they take 2 or more hours of the day to get through.\n\nI think the reason Moore breaks through to me each time though is this use of a strong symbolic language that’s at work on several occasions in Bowling for Columbine. It’s probably quite normal for documentary films to use real life footage from either news reports or historical archives to drive home a point, but Moore adds nuances in the use of sound and subtitles to ensure you can only see tragedy in these emotionally charged montages. Louis Armstrong sings What a Wonderful World as we watch and read the subititles detailing the lead up of government involvement in Afghanistan that result in the attacks on the World Trade Centre in 2001.\n\nThe song becomes a question of IS IT A Wonderful World that we’ve contributed to in ignorance of foreign policy and swallowing up liberal government trust at the voting ballot. Moore replies to the argument that American’s are innately violent because of a violent past of the Wild West and Civil wars by asking us to explain Germany’s flip around from Nazi dictatorship and Britain’s reversal of it’s previous global domination in montages plastered with actual footage of executions and violent ideologies saluting authority and military might. With respect to which ever side of the fence you fall on, Moore’s directed a beautiful argument between pro-gun lobbyists and the various victims of mass-shootings around the US to hold mass-media, federal government and fear accountable for the consumer-driven world American youth grow up in. Hence, I think he’s justified in using the footage of the second plane hitting the tower.\n\nAs is the nature of my posts here, I wonder now how I would feel if the film turned out to be crap. I’m pretty much the perfect advocate for film-maker’s experimentation in the pursuit of originality and a hard hitting end product, but I think I, like most of us, consider how other people feel about using this (such as footage) that relate to their loss and grief when I’m watching a film that uses that footage, and this is why using such footage has a risk. One of the most effective ways to shatter, not break but shatter, the audience’s connection from behind the fourth wall is to show footage that reminds the audience how fake the film is in comparison to the actual footage. This is why most films released now don’t use all the actual footage that is out there. The 2 films I saw on IMDB recently that triggered the writing of this article both have the potential to use footage that directly capture the events that they are essentially based around.\n\nNeither of these films were released in Australia at the time of this article being published, so it will be interesting to see if directors Peter Burg and Palbo Larraín decide to mirror the initial impact these events had unfolding on television. I don’t doubt they’ll pull plenty of us into the theater though; given the scope of these stories, we often feel a sense of duty to watch them. Nobody is going to know the full story and hence there’s a desire to get closer to individuals directly affected by these national tragedies. That familiar saying of `I can’t imagine what they’re going through’ comes to mind a our default setting for discussing these events with other people, and a film attempts to fill this gap. The film also makes a lot of money for an international conglomerate, CBS Films and Jackie Productions (II). Deep Water Horizon, American Sniper, The Big Short, this list goes on of these films that aren’t documentaries but are kind of dramatic re-imaginings of what went down on separate occasions.\n\nAt the end of the day, my bias towards documentaries is pretty clear, so in taking a leaf out of Moore’s book, maybe it’s safer for me to ask you how you feel about all this rather than plaster a conclusion right across the top. Do fictional films have the right to use actual footage, or can they get away with simply `alluding’ to it? Can the documentary format substitute the new wave of dramatic re-imagining every time?\n\nFeel free to let me know by replying and happy watching…..\n\n-thespecturmperspective."
