It was published by Shueisha in Bessatsu Margaret from 2005 to 2017 and collected in 30 tankōbon volumes.

A third season of the anime series began streaming worldwide on Netflix in August 2024.[11]\n\nPlot\n\nThe story takes place in Hokkaido. 15-year-old high school freshman Sawako Kuronuma—dubbed Sadako by her classmates for her resemblance to the character from The Ring—has always been feared and misunderstood because of her appearance. Rumors around school report that she can see ghosts and curse people. However, despite her ominous appearance, she is actually a sweet and unassuming girl who only longs to be helpful. She has been shunned for so long that the idea of making friends has become foreign to her. When a popular boy, Kazehaya, begins talking with her, everything changes. She finds herself in a new world, making new friends and talking to different people, and she can't thank Kazehaya enough for giving her these opportunities. Slowly, but surely, a sweet love blossoms between the two as they overcome circumstances and obstacles standing in their way.\n\nCharacters\n\nSawako Kuronuma (黒沼 爽子, Kuronuma Sawako)\n\nVoiced by: Mamiko Noto (Japanese); Xanthe Huynh[12] (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Mikako Tabe (film), Sara Minami (TV series)[13]\n\nSawako, the main protagonist, is a high school girl in search of friendship, but her resemblance to the horror film character Sadako Yamamura made this difficult. Her unhealthy levels of modesty and ineffective communication skills has prevented her from correcting misconceptions. As a result, she was tragically ostracized by everyone she met, and has forgotten how to understand others and express herself. Despite these obstacles, she remains a pure, positive, and caring person who works hard in everything she does.\n\nOn the day of the entrance ceremony at Kitahoro High School, Sawako meets Shōta under cherry blossoms by chance and helps him find his way. Due to his friendly and broad-minded nature, he is the first person she is able to smile genuinely and get through as herself. Her world begins to change as she learns to communicate her feelings and form closer friendships with fellow human beings, especially Chizuru Yoshida and Ayane Yano, for the first time.\n\nShe is rather petite - a characteristic inherited from her father, who is only 160 cm tall (however, by the end of the series, she is taller than him) - but is surprisingly fast, to the point some people believe she has teleportation powers. She takes everything people say so very seriously and tends to over-analyze situations. When she is deep in thought, her dark appearance terrifies her peers. With her pacifist nature and protectiveness nature, she sacrifices herself for others, when she avoided Ayane, Chizuru, and even Shōta, to protect their reputations. Though on top of academics, Sawako is oblivious and socially awkward, often scolded by Shōta and Chizuru for putting herself down and avoiding others.\n\nSawako is forever grateful to Shōta for giving her the opportunities to make friends and initially idolizes him. Thanks to her rival Ume Kurumizawa and Ryu Sanada explaining what the feelings of romantic love are, she realizes she is actually in love with him. Working through various misunderstandings, she eventually finds the courage to confess to him during the school festival during her second year, and they finally become a couple. Later in the same year when Shōta acts distant towards her for months due to his own insecurities, Sawako openly questions their relationship and cries and yells at him for neglecting her. This snaps him back to his senses, and they get their relationship back on track.\n\nDuring her third and final year, Sawako begins to ponder for the first time what she wants to do in the future. With the help of her homeroom teacher Pin Arai, Sawako discovers her wish to pursue her innate ability of teaching, particularly in Japanese Language (the reason is because it is her worst subject, but challenges her to improve her communication skills). Ultimately, she decides to leave her hometown and attend a Sapporo Educational University along with Ume, who becomes her best friend. By the end of high school, Sawako finally is able to clear up the misconceptions of her as \"Sadako\" by her class, graduating with a positive note. Bidding Ayane and Chizuru heartfelt farewell, and retaining a strong long-distance relationship with Shōta, she receives a ring from him on her 18th birthday and a letter the day she leaves with promises for the future.\n\nSome time later, Sawako returns to her hometown after graduating from university, and reunites with and hugs Shōta at the place where they first met.\n\nShōta Kazehaya (風早 翔太, Kazehaya Shōta)\n\nVoiced by: Daisuke Namikawa (Japanese); Khoi Dao[12] (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Haruma Miura (film), Ouji Suzuka (TV series)[13]\n\nShōta is Sawako's friendly classmate, and initially her idol. His popularity is so widespread regardless of gender because of his refreshing exterior. However, Shōta himself does not believe he is refreshing. With a serious, honest personality and his father's inherited stubbornness and temper, Shōta follows his own inflexible ideals and does not mindlessly follow the crowd. Though he treats everyone equally and without any bias, this is because he keeps a certain distance between himself and others, excluding those who he regards as familiar and trustworthy. In Sawako's case, he regarded her existence as special to him from the beginning.\n\nShōta's family owns a sportswear store, and his father is a baseball coach. He has known his best friend Ryu Sanada and Chizuru Yoshida since elementary school. Ever since he was a young boy, Shōta was on his father's baseball league team, and played along with Ryu on the middle school baseball team. However, due to his strained relationship with his father, and his mother's failing health, Shōta quit playing baseball in High School \"before he could hate it\", a decision that disappointed his homeroom teacher Pin, and angered his father. Thus, he does not belong to any club in high school, though still attends Pin's morning practices.\n\nWhen he sees Sawako smile on the day of the entrance ceremony, Shōta immediately feels a need to get to know her better. Willing to look past false rumors about her, Kazehaya is able to see who Sawako truly is, and feels a deep admiration for her strength, optimism and kindness. Early on he recognizes these are feelings of romantic love, though is unaware she feels the same way. Despite her gratefulness towards him, Shōta is unassuming about the impact he has on her, believing Sawako is able to stand up and make everything possible with her own willpower, regardless of the circumstances, the very thing he had always wanted to be able to do.\n\nDuring his second year, Shōta begins to feel depressed when Sawako does not give him chocolates on Valentine's Day, unaware she had been too nervous to give him any. Attempting to work through the misunderstandings plaguing them, he eventually confesses to her during the school festival, promising to always take care of her. After, she confesses her own feelings, and they become a couple. Later, Shōta begins to avoid Sawako for many months because of his own fear of not being the refreshing persona he believes Sawako is in love with, unconsciously causing a rift in their relationship. It is only after Sawako deems him a liar for ignoring her, does he realizes not facing his fear was his mistake, and they get their relationship back on track.\n\nShōta's relationship with his father throughout the series is sour, as he believes Shōta is irresponsible and dependent on others. As a result, Shōta is constantly trying to prove to his father he can be independent. Although initially deciding to succeed his family's store, Shōta thinks again about what he wants to do, and decides to return to baseball as a sports trainer and inherit the store at the same time. He ends up taking the entrance examination of the department of sports science at a local university. With the final full confidence, he is able to make his own decisions, and he makes amends with his father.\n\nSome time later, Shōta returns to the place where he first met Sawako after graduating from university, and reunites with and hugs Sawako at the place where they first met.\n\nAyane Yano (矢野 あやね, Yano Ayane)\n\nVoiced by: Miyuki Sawashiro (Japanese); Erica Mendez[12] (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Natsuna Watanabe (film), Rinka Kumada (TV series)[13]\n\nAyane is a close friend of Sawako's and part of Kitahoro's advanced school program. She is fashionable and noted to look mature for her age. An intelligent tactician, Ayane is easily able to decipher people's intentions and use them to her advantage. On the other hand, she gives just enough information to leave enemies and friends alike wondering and thus, force them forward. Generally, Ayane is strong-willed and caring, but also calculating and cold.\n\nFrom a young age, Ayane was cautious academically and socially, easily giving up and never striving beyond her abilities. Retaining an aloof demeanor, she was a social recluse who hated being around others. Though once the captain and setter of her middle school volleyball team, after a sticky incident where she was shunned by her team, she quit before the last tournament and moved to a different high school (Kitahoro).\n\nDuring freshman year, she makes her first true friends, Chizuru Yoshida and Sawako Kuronuma. Admittedly, they are the only people she has ever extended a hand to outside her immediate family, for they were the first to inspire her with their sincerity and courage. Fiercely loyal to them, she often takes up the role of an elder sister who supports and advises them. However, even with them, Ayane does not confide her own worries or intimate details, preferring to not make them worry about her.\n\nThough appearing to be a self-assured individual, Ayane is actually quite shy. She suffers from an aversion to taking risks and striving towards her dreams like her friends. For this reason, she envies them and has severe lack of self-esteem, thinking of herself as a cruel coward. However, Pin affirms she is nice, surprising her.\n\nDuring her second year, a schoolmate named Mogi confesses to her, and she agrees to date him, but their relationship instantly falls apart when she realizes he was just using her. Despite her many romances, Ayane has never actually fallen in love. Kento Miura comforts and forms a crush on her, and though Ayane is not in love with him, she is moved by his sincerity and agrees to date him.\n\nThroughout her senior year, Ayane struggles with what she wants to do when she graduates, and it is ultimately Pin who drives and encourages her, personally believing in her potential to become tremendously successful. As they spend more time together and he sheds his usual rambunctious image to seriously advise Ayane, she realizes he saw through her from the beginning. Ayane begins to admire him as a teacher and an individual, cherishing every piece of advice and encouragement he had ever given her.\n\nAyane's longtime dream has been to get into a prestigious university in Tokyo and eventually go overseas, but Kento expresses his disapproval and wishes for her to attend a university in Sapporo with him. Though Kento is the first boyfriend who truly cared for her, Ayane is unable to fall in love with him in the long run. Eventually Ayane realizes she will never get anywhere if she doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. No longer wishing to take the easy path, she decides she wants to challenge herself by pursuing her dream, and breaks up with Kento on mutual terms, though they remain good friends.\n\nWhile studying for the university exams, Ayane finally realizes she is in love for the first time, with none other than Pin. Due to their nearly 10-year age gap and roles as teacher and student, she does not expect him to return her feelings, or ever see him again after graduating. Still, thanks to Sawako and Chizuru's encouragement, she summons the courage to confess her feelings and passing university result to him on Valentine's Day. As expected, he rejects her confession as \"10 years too early\", but praises her as a kind person. Applauding not only her academic efforts, but her growth as a person, Pin lets Ayane know he believes in her future and encourages her to have more self-confidence. Tearfully smiling, Ayane thanks Pin for everything he has done for her and aspires to become an amazing adult who doesn't shame him in 10 years.\n\nOn the day she leaves for Tokyo, she meets Sawako and Chizuru for the last time at the train station and exchanges heartfelt farewells with them, thanking them for always supporting her and vowing to remember them anytime she felt like giving up and do her best. By the finale, Ayane is shown to have gained self-confidence, beaming when a few of her university classmates compliment her as \"kind\".\n\nChizuru Yoshida (吉田 千鶴, Yoshida Chizuru)\n\nVoiced by: Yuko Sanpei (Japanese); Morgan Berry[12] (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Misako Renbutsu (film), Riho Nakamura (TV series)[13]\n\nChizuru is another close friend of Sawako and Ayane and in Kitahoro's basic school program. Her nickname is \"Chizu\". Out of the 4 heroines, she is the tallest and most athletic, boasting a streak of 99 victories wrestling guys in middle school. Though not very feminine, she likes wearing miniskirts and sports shorts to accent her legs. Because of her tomboyish appearance, she has often been mistaken for a former Yankee since childhood.\n\nHer personality is fearless and hot-blooded, with a strong sense of duty and justice. Unlike Sawako and Ayane, Chizuru is extremely loud, brash, and talkative, always ready to speak her mind. She is cheerful with a large amount of fortitude enabling her to show courage in the face of adversity. Despite her intimidating nature, Chizuru has an unexpected sentimental side, often crying out of fear, frustration, anger, humiliation, or even comical effect. Not one of the brightest students, a running gag throughout the series and she is constantly having classes during school breaks to make up her failed academic assignments. Additionally, she is often oblivious to her surroundings and insensitive to the feelings of others.\n\nChizuru is also a big fan of ramen, as shown when she wrote she would like to study it in her career questionnaire, and Ayane once joked about Chizuru was ramen in a previous life. Her favorite ramen shop is \"Tetsuryuken\", run by her childhood friend and neighbor Ryu Sanada's father, and she eventually ends up working there.\n\nBefore high school, her only friends were boys, particularly Ryu Sanada and Shōta Kazehaya, who she went to the same middle school with. From a young age, she was in love with Ryu's older brother Tōru Sanada, although he had only ever seen her as a little sister. All the while, Chizuru was clueless to Ryu's own romantic affections for her, only seeing him as a little brother.\n\nAs their parents are close, Chizuru's relationship with Ryu goes back to the time they were toddlers. While they were in 3rd grade, Ryu's mother Tetsuko Sanada tragically died in a car accident and Tōru had to leave Ryu and his father for college in Sapporo. Chizuru comforted Ryu and vowed to be by his side forever as his sister. It would be upon this promise their relationship akin to siblings would be founded until Ryu confessed his romantic feelings to the horrified 17-year-old Chizuru.\n\nAt the freshman entrance ceremony, Chizuru first meets Ayane Yano, and later on in the year Sawako Kuronuma. Although her relationship with the two starts off rocky, after understanding both, she takes a strong liking to them. The two become close friends to Chizuru to the point where she threatens Kurumizawa Ume to \"say whatever you want about me, but don't talk about them like you know them!\"\n\nNear the end of the year, Tōru returns from Sapporo with a new fiancée named Haruka Katayama. Chizuru goes through her first heartbreak. This leads to her having a conflict with Ryu on his birthday, who wanted her to realize her love was futile from the beginning. However, after Chizuru and Ryu are able to resolve their differences on the issue, their friendship is strengthened.\n\nBut during her second year, Chizuru suddenly finds the nature of her relationship with Ryu tested. While on a school trip to Okinawa, she hears from Joe Sōichi Ryu rejected a girl because he is in love with another girl. Chizuru begins to feel jealous Ryu never told her who he liked, and starts questioning his trustworthiness. When the girl who was rejected confronts Chizuru and tells her to stay away from Ryu if they are not in a romantic relationship, Chizuru becomes furious and yells at her to mind her own business. This fight leaves Chizuru visibly shaken and feeling anger and awkwardness towards Ryu.\n\nDuring the trip, Ryu finally confronts her about his romantic feelings. Chizuru is horrified and rejects him on the spot. From this moment on, she finds herself unable to see Ryu as her brother, and can only see him as a distant stranger. Both aware they can no longer go back to the way they were in the past, they end their long and treasured friendship. The anguished Chizuru finally breaks down in tears when the class returns to Hokkaido, wondering if their friendship was only built out of Ryu's feelings and never existed from the beginning.\n\nThroughout the year, Chizuru does not interact with Ryu, but shows uncomfortable emotional outbursts whenever he is mentioned. When Christmas arrives, both Chizuru and Ryu attend their class party and talk to each other again after a long while. Chizuru awkwardly gives him a baseball wristband as a present. Ryu gives her a pink rose, something he says reminds him of her. Chizuru is left confused over her feelings for Ryu.\n\nDuring senior year, Chizuru starts thinking about what she wants to do in the future and decides to work part-time at Tetsuryuken. Unexpectedly, Ryu reveals to her on Valentine’s Day he plans to leave their town to pursue his dream of playing baseball at a Sapporo university. The two become even more distant. Deeply saddened, Chizuru realizes she has begun to see Ryu as a man and does not want him out of her life.\n\nOn her 18th birthday, Ryu thanks Chizuru for always supporting him from childhood, and promises her he will succeed in baseball. At this, Chizuru bursts into tears and asks him not to go, confessing her realized romantic feelings for Ryu. As they sort out the issue together as a couple, Chizuru begins to understand her bond with Ryu will never die no matter where he goes. Eventually, she finds the strength to support his dreams again.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Chizuru bids Sawako and Ayane heartfelt farewell. She decides to work full-time at Tetsuryuken, and she and Ryu make a promise to marry and run it together after he returns from university one day.\n\nRyu Sanada (真田 龍, Sanada Ryū)\n\nVoiced by: Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese); Ray Chase[12] (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Haru Aoyama (film), Kaito Sakurai (TV series)[13]\n\nRyu is also member of Sawako's group of friends. He is the son of the ramen shop owner of Chizuru Yoshida's favourite ramen shop. He is quiet most of the time and rarely talks, but still can communicate well with Sawako, as they both don't talk much anyway. Ryu and Kazehaya became friends when they were on the baseball team during middle school. He later confirms his love when he confesses that he likes Chizuru to Sawako. While his love is one-sided, he is very patient with Chizuru realizing that Chizuru probably won't like him in a romantic sense, at least not right away. He's more than willing to comfort Chizuru if she's depressed, though he would rather have her mad at him as he knows Chizuru can vent out her emotions better. Ryu also seems to like animals a lot; when Shōta was going to walk \"Maru\", his adopted puppy, home with Sawako, Chizuru pulled Ryu away telling him he's going to walk with Ayane and her instead. While being pulled away from Shōta's puppy, he cried out for it. A running gag in the series is that he has a very hard time remembering a person's name (with the exception of Kazehaya and Chizuru as he's known them for a long time, and after some time later Sawako and Ayane). In chapter 43, he casually tells Chizuru that he loves her and she is totally shocked. However, in chapter 59, he truly confesses his love for her, but she replies saying, \"I have never looked at you in that way\". In response, he smiles and says, \"I know\". After graduating from high school, he attends a university in Sapporo to play baseball and made a promise with Chizuru to marry and run Tetsuryuken together after returning from university one day.\n\nKazuichi \"Pin\" Arai (荒井 一市, Arai Kazuichi)\n\nVoiced by: Yūki Ono (Japanese); Keith Silverstein (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Arata (film), Shohei Miura (TV series)[13]\n\nArai is the temporary homeroom teacher for Sawako's class, taking over when the previous homeroom teacher became sick during the summer holidays while Sawako was helping him. Sawako, being formal, always refers to him as \"Arai-sensei\", while almost everyone else refers to him by his nickname, \"Pin\". Pin is a great fan of baseball as well as the school baseball team's coach. He used to be part of Kazehaya's father's league team, so he has known Shōta since when he was young. A loud and eccentric man prone to believing the silliest things, Pin apparently enjoys interrupting people. He nicknames the puppy that Sawako and Kazehaya find by the river \"Pedro Martínez\" after the legendary baseball pitcher, which Sawako suggests be shortened to \"Maru\". A running gag through the series, despite being a teacher he is prone to actions that are more suited to a teenager, such as eagerly running to the bathroom when he heard about a fight yet became depressed when Sawako and her friends were making up rather than fighting. He and Ayane tend to run into each other a lot, often bickering loudly as they walk away, though on rare occasions he will give her advice (though it comically ends in his ruining the moment to praise himself). He also has a false impression that Sawako is an exorcist. But for how he acts, Arai is rather insightful and is very helpful when it comes to his students, especially when he was suggesting career paths for Sawako, Ayane and Chizuru that best suit their talents and abilities. Pin also has a habit of believing girls in Sawako's year fancy him and often turns them down when they speak to him, stating that he's just too old for them.\n\nUme \"Kurumi\" Kurumizawa (胡桃沢 梅, Kurumisawa Ume)\n\nVoiced by: Aya Hirano (Japanese); Kayli Mills (English)\n\nPortrayed by: Mirei Kiritani\n\nA girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her, she has had a huge crush on Kazehaya since their first year of middle school; as a result, she understands his personality well, despite the fact they were never close friends. From when she was first seen, for many chapters she was known only as \"Kurumi\", which Sawako mistook to be her given name. She dislikes her given name, Ume, because it sounds old-fashioned and prefers to be called her nickname, \"Kurumi\". Kurumi is extremely jealous of Sawako, which led her to spread fake rumors of Sawako's only friends at the time, Yoshida and Yano, using Sawako's name. Kurumi does not attend the same class as Sawako or Kazehaya. During the next series of events it comes out that the middle school \"Kazehaya is Everyone's\" alliance had been Kurumi's idea, in order to preserve her own chances with Kazehaya. She eventually confesses her love to Kazehaya, but receives an expected rejection. Because she is always surprised with Sawako's naiveté, Kurumi, in her own words, \"You just don't get it, do you?! Sawako-chan, when I'm talking to you ... I get irritated and say what I really mean...\", and regards her as a rival for Kazehaya's affection. Following Kazehaya's rejection, she becomes colder to her classmates, but is able to finally express her feelings and personality. When Sawako hesitates on expressing her feelings, Kurumi tells Sawako that Sawako is not worthy of being a rival, but changes her mind after hearing that Sawako and Shōta have become a couple. She even defends Sawako against some other jealous girls, and got angry at Miura Kento for saying unnecessary things to Sawako that had caused a rift between Sawako and Shōta. Despite Kurumi's harsh personality, she is deep down, a stubborn, clear minded young woman who had stooped to unfair tricks to win a person's heart but has since learned better.\n\nKento Miura (三浦 健人, Miura Kento)\n\nVoiced by: Mamoru Miyano (Japanese); Landon McDonald (English)\n\nPlayed by: Jin Suzuki (TV Series)\n\nA student who sits next to Sawako at the beginning of their second year. Miura considers himself fairly popular among the girls, but he immediately expresses an interest in Sawako that Kazehaya becomes a little jealous. Miura assumes Kazehaya likes Sawako because he feels sorry for her, and tries to persuade Kazehaya to not be as involved in Sawako's life. His interference with Sawako and Kazehaya's developing relationship irritates Ayane. He expresses gratitude over the fact that the two began dating before he fell in love with her. In recent chapters, however, it hints that Kento may be developing a sort of attraction for Ayane and has helped her through some difficult times. He tends to help girls with broken relationships, as he continues to grow feelings for Ayane, he seeks advice from Sawako and Kazehaya. It is from Kazehaya that Kento finds out that Ayane has been slapped by one of her ex-boyfriends.\n\nTomoko \"Tomo\" Endo (遠藤 朋子, Endō Tomoko) and Eriko \"Ekko\" Hirano (平野 依里子, Hirano Eriko)\n\nVoiced by: Miho Miyagawa (Tomo), Mayuki Makiguchi (Ekko) (Japanese); Madeline Dorroh (Tomo),[12] Jackie Lastra (Ekko) (English)\n\nEndou and Hirano are classmates of Sawako, and also members of her study group. After Sawako begins to open up, Endou and Hirano become some of her first friends and try to find ways to encourage her to be less formal around them. They both become close friends of Sawako, who shows her appreciation of their friendship by making them Christmas gifts in addition to those she makes for her parents, Ayane, Chizuru, and Kazehaya.\n\nSoichi \"Joe\" Jonouchi (城ノ内 宗一, Jōnouchi Sōichi)\n\nVoiced by: Masahiro Yamanaka (Japanese); Caleb Yen[12] (English)\n\nOne of Sawako's classmates, easily swayed by other people. He generally appears in the background. Jounouchi is very attached to Kazehaya, which usually results in him unwittingly interrupting conversations between Sawako and Kazehaya. At one point, he is rejected after confessing to a girl he liked and is comforted by Kazehaya. After hearing about how Yano broke up with her boyfriend, he sets his attention on her though she is not interested in him. It appears Joe is a character used for comedic value, often blundering with simple tasks or interrupting serious moments. He does not seem to take hints nor does he often realize his mistakes when they are pointed out.\n\nToru Sanada (真田 徹, Sanada Tōru)\n\nVoiced by: Wataru Hatano (Japanese); Nazeeh Tarsha (English), Atsuhiro Inukai (TV series)[13]\n\nTōru is Ryu's older brother by eight years and Chizuru's crush since she was young. Although he is Ryu's brother and they resemble one another, their personalities are nearly opposite. Tōru resembles Kazehaya personality-wise and looks extremely refreshing, except much more mature. He lives three hours away from his parents' house but much to Chizuru's surprise, on his visit with the family he introduced his fiancee. He cares about Ryu and Chizuru a lot, and eventually tells Chizuru he loves her like a little sister. He calls Chizuru by the nickname \"Chii\" because a person has to smile when saying it, and he wanted to cheer her up.\n\nYoshiyuki \"Zen\" Arai (荒井 善行, Arai Yoshiyuki)\n\nVoiced by: Takuma Suzuki (Japanese); Brian Beacock[12] (English)\n\nThe original home room teacher of Sawako's class. He and Pin have the same surname, but are not related. To distinguish between the two teachers Yoshiyuki Arai is nicknamed \"Zen\", which is an alternate reading of the kanji for \"Yoshi\". He seems to be afraid of Sawako and the rumors surrounding her as \"Sadako\". Early in the series, he falls ill and has to take a leave of absence from school; because of that, students often believe that Sawako has cursed him. Arai is newly-wed and eventually retires from teaching in order to help his wife's family business (a sake brewery), resulting in Pin taking over his class permanently.\n\nShino (詩乃)\n\nVoiced by: Kanae Oki (Japanese); Cristina Valenzuela (English)\n\nThe only link to Sawako's past, Shino was her elementary school classmate and the only person who Sawako can openly speak to as the series begins. According to Shiina, Shino was an unnamed character in the manga, but was named by the staff for the anime. In Kindergarten, Shino thought Sawako looked angry, and accidentally called her \"Sadako\". becoming the catalyst of the many rumors surrounding her. Because of this, Shino feels guilty and personally responsible for Sawako’s problems, and her appearances often consist of her worrying over Sawako and occasionally checking up on whether she is fitting into high school. Shino is in a different class and regrets that she doesn't get to see Sawako very much. She is a cipher, appearing only occasionally as a catalyst for Sawako's interactions with other people. When Sawako finishes her university examinations, Shino checks up on her one more time with an apology and congratulates her on becoming more cheerful and sociable.\n\nChigusa Takahashi (高橋 千草, Takahashi Chigusa)\n\nVoiced by: Yurin (Japanese); Lily Ki (English)\n\nA classmate of Sawako, Takahashi sits behind Sawako after the seating arrangements change for the third term of first year. She enjoys teasing Sawako and Ayane remarks that Takahashi is eccentric.\n\nAccording to Shiina, she was just Takahashi-san in the manga, but has the given name Chigusa in the anime show and from volume 10 onwards.\n\nYagi (八木)\n\nA classmate of Sawako who sits next to her after the seating arrangements change during the third term of first year. He often consults her on supposedly spiritual or occult concerns.\n\nMogi Motoki (茂木)\n\nMogi is a new character introduced in the recent chapters of the manga. He is a boy from Class 2-B. In Chapter 54, he asks Ayane to date him, to which she immediately agrees. Ayane breaks up with him in Chapter 59.\n\nMedia\n\nManga\n\nWritten and illustrated by Karuho Shiina, Kimi ni Todoke was first published as a one-shot in Shueisha's shōjo manga magazine Bessatsu Margaret on August 11, 2005,[14] and planned to be compiled in her previous work, Crazy For You.
