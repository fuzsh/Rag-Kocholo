        "text": "Hello readers!\n\nThis is one of the few weekends of 2015 which have rolled by that I feel that there’s a great selection of films on offer. A mix of indie and big budget flicks and anime. Not too much of one or the other and there’s plenty that was fun and interesting to watch. I’d be interested in watching all of these films.\n\nI think that part of my positivity is the fact that I saw some rather excellent films since I last posted a trailer post. Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends (epic movie!), Fatal Frame, The Young Victoria (that one was harmless), Synodoche New York (you’re in the scene not filming it), and The Tale of The Princess Kaguya. I have been listening to nothing but Japanese shoegaze music again.\n\nWhat’s released in Japan this weekend?\n\nKyoukai no Kanata – I’ll Be Here – Future Chapter\n\nJapanese Title: 劇場版 境界の彼方 I’LL BE HERE未来篇\n\nRomaji: Kyokai no Kanata – I’ll Be Here – Mirai-hen\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 45 mins.\n\nDirector: Taichi Ishidate\n\nWriter: Jukki Hanada (Screenplay), Nagomu Torii (Original Light Novel),\n\nStarring: Risa Taneda (Mirai Kuriyama), Kenn (Akihito Kanbara), Minori Chihara (Mitsuki Nase), Tatsuhisa Suzuki (Hiroomi Nase), Yuri Yamaoka (Ai Shindo),\n\nI’ve got less and less time for Kyoto Animation the more I see of their work. Beautiful as it is, stories and characters don’t keep my interest (slice-of-life tales about cute girls tend to tire me out these days and I don’t want to see lesbian bears ever again) and yet despite the fact Kyoukai no Kanata was a narrative mess I still liked it and there were a few tears after the finale of the TV anime back in 2013. I really liked the characters… Well, Mirai Kuriyama. So I want to see more of her.\n\nThis is the second film based on Kyoukai no Kanata. The first film, Kako-hen, was released in March and retold the events of the television series while this film will work, set one year after the television series.\n\nThe director of the movie is Taichi Ishidate, director of the TV anime as well as director on episodes of K-ON! and Hyouka, an anime I really liked. The screenplay comes from writer Jukki Hanada who has two great works on his filmography in Steins;Gate and Nichijou. Miku Kadowaki, character designer, has worked on many Kyoto Animation titles like Free! Eternal Summer, Hyouka, Nichijou, and Tamako Market. The seiyuu remain the same with KENN reprising his role as Akihito, and Risa Taneda coming back as Mirai.\n\nThe story of the movie is a retelling of the TV anime which is about two students with supernatural powers. The first we encounter is Akihito Kanbara (KENN) who is half demon (yomu) and invulnerable to wounds. When he sees Mirai Kuriyama (Risa Taneda) on the school roof and about to attempt what looks like suicide he intervenes. The two get to know each other and Akihito discovers that Mirai is from a cursed line of warriors who are able to manipulate blood. Despite her distaste for him (fuyukai desu), the two grow closer and as this happens, dark forces move in to try and take advantage of Akihito.\n\nWebsite\n\nParasyte Part 2 / Parasyte: The Final Act\n\nJapanese Title: 寄生獣 完結編\n\nRomaji: Kiseiju Kanketsu Hen\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 117 mins.\n\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\n\nWriter: Ryota Kosawa (Screenplay), Hitoshi Iwaaki (Original Manga),\n\nStarring: Shota Sometani (Shinichi Izumi), Ai Hashimoto (Satomi Murano), Sadao Abe (Migi), Eri Fukatsu (Ryoko Tamiya), Masahiro Higashide (Hideo Shimada), Nao Omori (Kuramori), Pierre Taki (Miki), Hirofumi Arai (Uragami), Tadanobu Asano (Goto), Kimiko Yo (Nobuko Izumi), Jun Kunimura (Detective Hirama),\n\nPeople who follow me on Twitter will know I’m a big fan of the Parasyte TV anime which I think was perfectly executed. This is the second of two live-action films and I am seriously wondering how they can measure up to the manga or TV anime considering they have limited running-time. Anyway, these films and anime adapt Hitoshi Iwaaki’s original manga serialized in Kodansha’s Afternoon magazine from 1990-1995. The 10-volume series (later reprinted in an eight-volume version) has more than 11 million copies in print.\n\nThe film stars Shōta Sometani (live-action xxxHOLiC, Himizu, Soredake/That’s It) who plays the lead role of Shinichi Izumi. He is joined by Eri Fukatsu (Villain) who plays Ryōko Tamiya, Shinichi’s former-teacher who is a Parasite take, and Ai Hashimoto (The Kirishima Thing, live-action version of Another) plays Satomi Murano, Shinichi’s classmate and girlfriend. Jun Kunimura as detective Hirama strikes me as great casting as do the enemy parasites but the voice of Migi sounds off after watching the anime – Aya Hirano was perfect.\n\nThe story takes place in a world where alien beings called Parasites come to Earth and start taking over humans by entering in through their noses and ears and attaching themselves to their brains. One alien called Migi is only able to take over high school student Shinichi Izumi’s right arm, and is unable to control Shinichi completely. Migi and Shinichi learn to co-exist, and the two battle other Parasites who see humans only as food. The second part of the film sees Shinichi an Migi try to figure out how to beat a group of Parasites who have control of the mayor of their city and are creating a network of feeding spot. Ryoko Tamiya also makes a re-appearance but is she still going to be a threat to Shinichi?\n\nWebsite\n\nRyuzo And The Seven Henchmen\n\nJapanese: 龍三と七人の子分たち\n\nRomaji: Ryuzo to Shinichinin no Kobuntachi\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 111 mins.\n\nDirector: Takeshi Kitano\n\nWriter: Takeshi Kitano (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Tatsuya Fuji, Masaomi Kondo, Akira Nakao, Ken Yasuda, Hisako Manda, Takeshi Kitano, Toru Shinagawa,\n\nWarner Bros. Japan strike again to help make Takeshi Kitano’s latest film about old yakuza gangsters cleaning up the crime world. When I first read about it, looked like another “I’m too old for this,” action comedies put out by ageing actors. Now that I have seen the full trailer it looks amusing. The film stars a lot of actors who have played yakuza and tough guy roles Tatsuya Fuji (he has been in the Stray Cat Rock series, Bright Future). Reading through the filmographies of some of these guys is fascinating because you find een more classic ‘60s and ‘70s action films like Quick-Draw Okatsu (1969).\n\nAnyway, here’s the trailer for Kitano’s film:\n\nRyuzo (Tatsuya Fuji) and his seven former henchmen are all retired yakuza in their 70s who live quiet lives as regular old men (so this is what happens when a yakuza doesn’t die…). One day, Ryuzo becomes the victim of a phishing scam and is outraged. He calls his seven men together to reform their society.\n\nWebsite\n\nAsleep\n\nJapanese: 白河夜船\n\nRomaji: Shirakawa yofune\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 91 mins.\n\nDirector: Shingo Wakagi\n\nWriter: Shingo Wakagi, Kai Suzumoto (Screenplay), Banana Yoshimoto (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Sakura Ando, Arata Iura, Mitsuki Tanimura, Guama, Maki Izawa, Aya Takekou, Yoshiaki Takahashi,\n\nI am a fan of Banana Yoshimoto’s writing and I am a fan of Sakura Ando. It therefore stands to reason that I want to see a film based on Banana Yoshimoto’s novel of the same name (published in 1989) and see Sakura Ando (the highlight of Love Exposure, tragic in Shokuzai, and delightful in For Love’s Sake) in the lead role. There’s also Arata (Ping Pong, After Life) and Mitsuki Tanimura (Arcana, The Snow White Murder Case).\n\nTerako (Ando) sleeps a lot. She only wakes when she gets a call from her married middle-aged lover, Iwanaga (Arata), a controlling man. She wants to break it off and her life is made even more confused because she is mourning the suicide of her close friend Shiori (Tanimura), whose unusual occupation was sleeping with strangers – no sex just a comforting presence for when they wake – for pay. Every day she falls into a deep sleep, Iwanaga calling her, unsure over whether she wants to continue. Is she depressed?\n\nWebsite\n\nChateau de la Reine\n\nJapanese: 王妃の館\n\nRomaji: Ouhi no Yakata\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 123 mins.\n\nDirector: Hajime Hashimoto\n\nWriter: Junichiro Taniguchi, Kei Kunii (Screenplay), Jiro Asada (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Yutaka Mizutani, Rena Tanaka, Kazue Fukiishi, Hiroyuki Onoue, Munetaka Aoki, Yumi Adachi, Renji Ishibashi,\n\nThe hotel Chateau de la Reine in Paris is considered the finest hotel in the city with over 300 years of history. A travel agency, which is teetering on bankruptcy comes up with a plan to offer suite rooms at the Chateau de la Reine for night and day periods. The plan appears perfect, but the tourists who made reservations have unusual requests and attitudes…\n\nWebsite\n\nUmi yama aida Ise jinguu no mori kara hibiku messeji\n\nJapanese: うみやまあひだ 伊勢神宮の森から響くメッセージ\n\nRomaji: Umi yama aida Ise jinguu no mori kara hibiku messeji\n\nRelease Date: April 24th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 79 mins.\n\nDirector: Masaaki Miyazawa,\n\nWriter: Junichiro Taniguchi, Kei Kunii (Screenplay), Jiro Asada (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Shinnyo Kawai (Shinto Priest of Ise Grand Shrine), Kengo Kuma (world-acclaimed Architect; models and drawings of his major works is permanent collection at MOMA), Mitsuo Ogawa (Master of Carpenter), Takeshi Kitano (world-acclaimed Filmmaker; “Fireworks”, “Zatoichi”, “Sonatine”), Katsuhiko Kurata (Forest Manager of Ise), Soju Ikeda (Kiso timber company Owner), Genmyo Ono (Chief Abbot of Horyuji Temple; Horyuji is the World Heritage, one of the oldest wooden buildings in the world), Masaru Tanaka (Professor Emeritus in Kyoto University), Tsutomu Ohashi (Neuroscientist and Music Composer of the movie “AKIRA”), Shigeatsu Hatakeyama (Oyster Fisherman; chosen by the United Nations as one of the winners of the Forest Heroes Awards), Akira Miyawaki (Ecologist; contributed to forest regeneration by planting over 40 million native trees around the world), Yoshihiro Narisawa (Chef; won the Sustainability Award at the World’s 50 Best Restaurants)\n\nThank the movie Gods that more and more Japanese films have English-language pages because that allows me to copy and paste the information about these Japanese documentaries about very Japanese subjects.\n\nMasaaki Miyazawa, one of the most prestigeous photographers in Japan, has been taking photos of shrines and temples for more than 10 years and has found the Japanese identity through this experience. He encountered Shikinen Sengu at Ise Jingu, the most sacred ceremony that is held once every 20 years for over a thousand years. He then decided to take a journey all over Japan to direct this film. He went into some deep mountains, sacred forests, and beautiful coasts. He talked with a oyster fisherman, a scientist, a master of carpenter, an architect, a filmmaker and some others. This documentary is about Mr. Miyazawa’s beautiful journey to seek the memory of people who has lived together with nature in the mountains and the oceans.\n\n<DIRECTOR STATEMENT>\n\n“The deity makes an equal treatment for everyone and everything”. It is my starting point of the journey when I heard this comment from a Shinto priest at Ise Grand Shrine. I have found that my country has two thousand years of history where people have lived together with forest through cyclic regeneration. This documentary is a compilation of my ten-year journey of seeking the deep root of our culture.\n\nWebsite\n\nCaesium and the Girl\n\nJapanese: セシウムと少女\n\nRomaji: Seshiumu to Shoujo\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 109 mins.\n\nDirector: Ryo Saitani\n\nWriter: Ryo Saitani (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yusuke Kawazu, Hatsuo Yamaya, Nankin, Takao Iida, Kaira Shirahase, Masato Nagamori, Keiji Yamasaki, Miho Kaneno.\n\nAccording to Eiga.com, the director of this film runs the Laputa cinema in Asagaya which is inspired by Hayao Miyazaki’s film, Laputa Castle in the Sky. If it’s this cinema then he has a sweet job. Anyway, this is a fantasy about a girl named Mimi who gets struck by lightening and involved with some mythical figures while looking for a myna bird.\n\nWebsite\n\nShishuu Tsugu no hi Itan\n\nJapanese: 死臭 つぐのひ異譚\n\nRomaji: Shishuu Tsugu no hi Itan\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 67 mins.\n\nDirector: Masakazu Kikuchi\n\nWriter: Allen Sumiyoshi (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Nozomi Maeda, Towa Hasegawa, Yusuke Konno, Emi Yoshida,\n\nOh look, a movie adaptation of another low-budget video game. This one is based on A Stench of Death and is so low-budget it doesn’t show up on IMDB or Asian Wiki. A lot of the actors and the director do and they have worked on churning out horror titles. I’m not keeping count but that makes three low-budget horror games. Ao Oni, Death Forest, and now this. There’s a Reddit forum discussing this game.\n\nAnyway, back to the film… Nozomi Maeda takes the lead as a girl who lives in a quiet residential area where a girl went missing some time before. While walking towards a phone box, the phone starts ringing and she gingerly takes the handset and hears the voice of a woman but it sounds like she is in the middle of a storm. Then her voice is cut off and strange stuff starts happening…\n\nWebsite\n\nWalking with My Mother\n\nJapanese: 抱擁\n\nRomaji: Houyou\n\nRelease Date: April 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 93 mins.\n\nDirector: Katsumi Sakaguchi\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: Suchie Sakaguchi, Mariko Miyazono, Satoshi Sakaguchi, Katsumi Sakaguchi,\n\nThis one got its international premiere at last year’s Tokyo International Film Festival and it looks like emotionally powerful stuff. Here’s the info on the film from the festival webpage:\n\nHow do you live after losing your loved ones? Suchie (78) is distraught after losing her daughter and then her husband. Countless tranquilizers were given to calm her. Her son, Director Katsumi Sakaguchi, turns to his camera to understand her more. When Mariko arrives for the funeral and sees her sister’s despair, she decides to take her back to their hometown for the first time in 38 years. Here, Mariko devotes her life to her sister. Her son reveals four painful years of her distress and conflict through the camera. Grief always comes after the sadness of losing those closest to us. What rescued her from it?\n\nWebsite\n\nBroken\n\nRelease Date: April 10th, 2014\n\nRunning Time: 122 mins.\n\nDirector: Lee Jung-Ho\n\nWriter: Lee Jung-Ho (Screenplay), Keigo Higashino (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Jung Jae-Young, Lee Sung-Min, Seo Jun-Young, Lee Soo-Bin, Choi Sang-Wook,\n\nThe film starts with the sort of beautiful imagery that is all sorts of intriguing. A frost-covered man in a fur-lined coat kneels in a snowy forest, a bloodied mobile phone providing the only splash of colour in the white wilderness while there is complete silence on the soundtrack. The few shaky close-ups reveal he has the look of someone with shellshock. His eyes stare unevenly into the distance as he shivers, his mental equilibrium clearly wrecked by some trauma. Fade to black, the title, Broken.\n\nWe get taken back in time to the beginning of the story. The man we first met is a single-father named Sang-Hyun (Jeong Jae-young) with a teenage daughter named Soo-Jin. He works late at his job in a textile factory but dotes on her, making sure to stay in contact even if it is mostly by phone. We see one of those nights when he works overtime and is unable to meet her after she finishes school. She walks home alone on a rain-swept street, a car, a black Prince sedan, menacingly pulling up behind her.\n\nWhen Sang-Hyun gets home there’s no one there. It’s every parent’s worst nightmare but all he can do is wait for some sign from her. He gets a call from his daughter’s mobile but it’s not her making the call it’s the police. They found Soo-Jin in an abandoned building frequented by hoodlums. She has been raped and murdered. The police need him to identify the body.\n\nThe police are quick to move and gather evidence but the world weary attitude of many of the detectives threatens to slow the case. They aren’t going to fumble the investigation but their slowness may allow the criminals to escape.\n\nSang-Hyun, with nothing but the agony of waiting for the police to do their work replays his most recent memories of his daughter before he gets a message from someone with a connection to the case who wants to manipulate events. The message tips Sang-Hyun off as to who the criminals in his daughter’s disappearance and death might be and so he sets off on a path of revenge…\n\nFrom here on out the story takes a more conventional line as it plies familiar revenge-thriller territory in a linear fashion both chronologically and in terms of plot. What we get can be found in numerous other Korean films from the rape-revenge and relentless chase narrative to the archetypal jaded and rookie detectives but Broken is different perhaps because of its origins. The film is based on the 2003 novel called Samayou Yaiba by the excellent writer Keigo Higashino. I must admit I have not read it but it must be good because this is the second adaptation. The first time it was adapted was for the Japanese film named Hovering Blade. Perhaps its literary source is what makes Broken different and unique from the myriad of other titles where macho men march around massacring bad guys and seeking revenge like The Berlin File (2013) and The Man From Nowhere (2010) which often fly off into the heights of melodrama. Broken has a deep level of substance and characterisation and fascinating moral dilemmas which feel like something from a novel.\n\nDespite the revenge-thriller aspects, the tone of the film is pitched somewhere between I Saw the Devil (2010) and Poetry (2010) because of its subject matter and because it features scenes of action and physical violence but in a real world context so that the more horrific aspects are counter-weighted by a probing moral examination of the scenario and society, all delivered through beautifully shot scenes ad strong lead performance. Don’t expect audacious action.\n\nJust like in the film Blue Ruin (2013) what we are witnessing is an ordinary man (although far more handsome and capable to help with the action elements and hooking an audience) setting out to accomplish revenge and barely making it. We are under no illusions that Sang-Hyun’s search for vengeance is a dark and destructive one that he takes no pleasure in. The film’s locations and sets are downbeat and dour, detailing the bleakness of the enterprise. Sang-Hyun is clearly a broken man pursuing revenge because he harbours anger and shame over his failure to care for Soo-Jin but he has no real idea on how he will get that revenge. It is most evident in the clumsy way that he gathers clues about the criminals, mostly by coincidence, and heads out into the icy wilderness with the wrong clothes, a suit and a pair of shoes he wears to the factory. As the film progresses he is increasingly battered, bruised, and bloodied as he bludgeons and beats his way to the criminals, Sang-Hyun is always on the edge of failure as he scrambles around. He’s in way over his head. Seeing a desperate man flailing for vengeance takes some of the sensationalism away from some pretty hair-raising scenes (like a leap from a window and a chase in a ski-resort) so the film doesn’t launch itself into the melodramatic stratosphere.\n\nThe film doesn’t dress up what he does. He is clumsily killing cruel and callous criminals who are mere teens or parasitic adults. It is evident we are meant to sympathise with him but his actions are still troubling not least because we see the effects of violence on victims and how it breaks people.\n\nThis places a lot of the focus on lead-actor Jung Jae-Young who I am familiar with him from lighter fare like The Quiet Family (1998), Guns and Talks (2001), and Our Sunhi (2013). Here he provides a riveting performance mostly through the way his face shows the blasted emotions that churn him up inside as he pushes on relentlessly through guilt and physical hardship to get some justice. Whether it is seeing him wide-eyed with terror or blankness as he struggles with dangerous situations or the more showy reams of saliva dripping from a mouth hanging agape at the violence he has been pushed to commit, you will sympathise. Although he gets thrilling action scenes he is more effective in the quieter emotional moments like when he discovers his daughter’s body and all he can do is smooth her hand. The look of desolation he has on his face as he struggles to cope with her death is affecting. The best scene he is involved in is not the loud action ones or dramatic confrontations but a hallucinatory vision he has in that forest where we first met him. His visions of his daughter has him confessing his guilt and anger and fear. It is a humanising and beautiful scene.\n\nIt isn’t just the main character who is broken. There are wider themes about changes in society, the hardening and callousness of the younger generation constantly brought up with constant news reports and police discussions about youth crime. The legal system in Korea is put in trial by the film in scenes where detectives and forensic experts constantly converse over how much time the suspects will get. It becomes increasingly clear that the criminals, teenage boys, may only get a few years because they are minors, which sits uneasily with everybody involved in the case. The film paints a pessimistic picture of Korean society as cops try to avoid a media disaster and public backlash, parents refuse to condemn sons who committed crimes, and there is a general fear of young people who are shown to be desensitised to the pain and suffering they cause others. With no quick remedy to solve these social problems, well, society as a whole seems broken. As awful as this sounds the film is strikingly beautiful. Most Korean film are good-looking but this film has some of the most visually memorable scenes I have seen in a while, the aforementioned opening and hallucination that is worth watching the entire film for.\n\nFor a film to stand-out in a well-worn genre like revenge it must conjure up feeling like this in the audience which is what makes Broken worth watching.\n\n4/5\n\nSeventh Code\n\nJapanese Title: Seventh Code\n\nRomaji:Sebunsu Kodo\n\nRelease Date: January 11th, 2014\n\nRunning Time: 60 mins.\n\nDirector: Kiyoshi Kurosawa\n\nWriter: Kiyoshi Kurosawa\n\nStarring: Atsuko Maeda, Ryohei Suzuki, Hiroshi Yamamoto, Aissy\n\nWebsite\n\n2013 was the year for Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s return to mainstream big-budget filmmaking. He released two films, both star-packed with idols. The first was the big-budget sci-fi film Real, a title that was subject to critically and commercially middling responses. I found it a dull trudge through a slight story with one-note characters played by Takeru Sato and Haruka Ayase. The better received of the two movies, and definitely the most interesting viewing experience, was his latest film Seventh Code which won two awards at the Rome Film Festival for Best director and technical contribution for Koichi Takahashi, the editor. Kurosawa was reportedly very surprised to get them. After watching Seventh Code I can see why.\n\nThe true nature of this little thriller is that it is essentially a 60 minute promo (including a music video at the end!) for Atsuko Maeda, a former leader of the J-pop supergroup AKB48, to display her acting. Maeda has picked all sorts of roles that go against the cute idol image she had built with AKB48 by working with a myriad of auteurs on titles that break the idol image. She has been directed by the likes of Hideo Nakata in the J-horror film The Complex, and two dramedies The Drudgery Train and Tamako in Moratorium, both directed by Nobuhiro Yamashita. With Kiyoshi Kurosawa Maeda has met the director whose style can annihilate her cute idol past. I say this because Kurosawa is famed for being a horror auteur with some pretty bone-chilling titles in his filmography and also credited with directing the least sexiest pink film ever (according to Wikipedia it is called College Girl: Shameful Seminar and that film was reworked into the 1985 non-pink film The Excitement of the Do-Re-Mi-Fa Girl). For the first twenty-minutes of Seventh Code this intriguing film looks set to change our perceptions of the girl as Maeda gets swallowed up in Kurosawa’s style and love of a mystery!\n\nMaeda plays a girl named Akiko who has travelled to the Russian port city of Vladivostok to track down a man named Matsunaga (Suzuki), the man she seems convinced is the love of her life based on a brief meeting in Tokyo a month earlier. With no clear idea of where he might be coincidence strikes when he exits a particular green car on his way to a meeting. When Akiko stops Matsunaga he is confused at first then takes her to a restaurant where he claims not to remember her, tells her not to trust anyone in a foreign country and suddenly leaves.\n\nWhen Akiko tries to find Matsunaga again she is attacked by Russian mafia thugs, kidnapped, and thrown into a wasteland with no money except a few coins. She refuses to give up tracing Matsunaga and coincidence strikes again as she stumbles upon a restaurant run by a Japanese man named Saito (Yamamoto) and his Chinese girlfriend (Aissy). From there she begins tracing Matsunaga but will she be able to contest with the dangerous men around him…\n\nAkiko is at first an odd character. With her incessant need to meet mysterious man Matsunaga the film takes on a psychological thriller element as we wonder just why Akiko is blindly following him regardless of the danger, handsome and suave though he is. Is she a tremendous bubblehead and is he worth the risks? Is this the case of love really making people mad? What sort of emotional baggage is she carrying? She’s practically reciting his name like a mantra to get her through her days spent in a horrid Russian city where everyone is a stranger and offers some sort of threat. The film takes all sorts of twists and turns and as it progresses and viewers are teased that there is more to Akiko than just blind love like in the way she gets herself back to the city from the wasteland, her language skills, and the way she is relentless in her task. For the first thirty to forty-minutes there are random and crazy events which may confuse viewers as Akiko discovers secrets in her search but soon things begin to make sense and the story contracts into something more familiar and conventional. To say anything more will be to ruin twists as Maeda steps away from her cute schoolgirl idol image and matures a bit by running through the Kurosawan aesthetics as a character with more than just a pretty smile.\n\nKurosawa, famed for his horror movies which make everywhere in Japan look scary (even the countryside), manages to turn Russia into a decaying corpse. The post Soviet city of Vladivostock is a miserable place filled with a warren of streets which are all a dingy, the walls covered in agit-prop posters, twisted graffiti, and chipped paint and the wan sunlight serves only to illuminate the trash strewn along the cobblestones and cast stark shadows across corridors which characters have to brave to get what they want. Even in foreign countries Kurosawa insists on taking his leads to derelict buildings rusting away and overgrown with weeds and populated by people harbouring secret malignant intentions. Outside the city is not much better as mist covers much of the land. The only places of safety are the little café Akiko works in, a pokey and dingy affair with much despair in the air, and the one place of actual comfort is the ramshackle apartment she shares with Aissy, paint peeling from the walls, dust covering every surface except the bed. Meanwhile the mysterious Matsunaga’s apartment, while sumptuously put together with ornate and stylish furniture in a few rooms, is mostly a cavernous building missing much in the way of comfortable friendly colours but having plenty of billowing curtains which take on menacing phantasmic forms.\n\nAll of the characters, as is typical for a Kurosawa film, seem to hold some sort of self-doubt or angst. Two particularly good scenes that mix characters and locations are Maeda’s chase of Matsunaga’s car up a foggy hill and the following sequence when she gets back to the restaurant at night and Aissy is sat at a table obsessively putting sugar into containers and running through her thoughts about her future while a cat stalks around in the shadows in the background.\n\nAmidst all of this madness Maeda, our main character and the star of this promo, strikes a positive note as our little leading lady. Her role could have made a lesser actor stumble by playing things in too artificial a way because the narrative is a rather oblique one (if ultimately slight) but she commits to the role with gusto, speaking Russian with what appears to be ease, running, leaping, and searching for her goal with a strange determination mixed with indecision that hooks audience interest. I don’t think she is a brilliant actress yet. Her performance in The Complex was pretty awful but I feel that was partly down to Hideo Nakata’s direction. With this role and others previously mentioned, she proves there is substance to her. Here’s Atsuko Meada as an adorable AKB48 girl\n\nShe seems more mature, harder, and less innocent in films I have watched her in. Rather fittingly, we get a reminder of her past as an idol as she performs in a music video at the end of the film and how much she has progressed as an actress:\n\nIf she plays to her strengths like in Tamako in Moratorium and continues to work with interesting auteurs she will continue to grow.\n\nI’m eager to see her in Kabukicho Love Hotel.\n\nI can imagine that people with no interest in J-pop idols or Japanese films will think this a slight film and ultimately pointless but I think this is a fun little thriller and at only sixty minutes it isn’t too big a commitment\n\n3.5/5\n\nMy top five Kiyoshi Kurosawa films are:\n\nCure: The Power of Suggestion\n\nTokyo Sonata\n\nLicence to Live\n\nPulse\n\nSakebi\n\nCheck out my biography and filmography of my favourite director!\n\nCannes is THE film festival that everyone (even people with no interest in films) knows because of all the gossip about movie stars and the fashion stuff that newspapers report on instead of serious film business like who licenses what for distribution. For people more interested in films, we get to speculate about which directors and what films will be programmed by the selection committee. Well speculate no more! The announcements have been made… and I only care about the Japanese films that have been selected. Let’s go!\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival (68th Festival de Cannes) takes place in the middle of May and we now know the names of quite a few of the films that will be screened at the festival which will run from Thursday, May 13th– 24th.\n\nThere are no real shockers as far as I can see since there is a familiar line-up of directors, festival favourites who keep getting invited back to Cannes like Nanni Moretti, Apichatpong Weerasethakul and plenty of French auteurs like Jacques Audiard. The one big change from previous years is the higher number of female directors and that’s probably down to the criticism the festival committee got last year about the paucity of female talent getting their work shown. The opening night film is Emmanuelle Bercot’s Standing Tall (La Tete Haute), the first time that a film directed by a woman has opened Cannes (which is mind-boggling considering the high number of female directors in France and their high quality of work).\n\nAs far as the Japanese contingent goes we get familiar names like director Naomi Kawase and Hirokazu Koreeda as this preview will show. The usual suspects…\n\nThe question this festival raised for me is where are the newer directors? Shuichi Okita, Yuya Ishii? Is nobody really interested in them? Do they not make films festivals want to screen? Are their films too nice, gentle, polite, and amusing and relaxing to make the headlines that more dramatic and experimental films do? Maybe, maybe not. What I have noticed is that the real show-stoppers from the newer generation of Japanese directors seem to come from female directors who fearlessly tackle all sorts of social issues and tough relationships.\n\nAll of the interesting titles that get picked up are directed by a new generation of women! Hear that Cannes selection committee? Two birds, one stone. Women. Japanese. Japanese women. Screen films by directors like Lisa Takeba!\n\nAnyway, what are the Japanese films getting screened at Cannes?\n\nOur Little Sister (International Title) / Umimachi Diary\n\nJapanese: 海街 Diary\n\nRomaji: Umimachi Diary\n\nRelease Date: June 13th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 126 mins.\n\nDirector: Hirokazu Koreeda\n\nWriter: Shin Adachi (Screenplay), Akimi Yoshida (Original Manga)\n\nStarring: Haruka Ayase, Masami Nagasawa, Kaho, Suzu Hirose, Shinobu Otake, Shinichi Tsutsumi, Ryo Kase, Jun Fubuki, Ryohei Suzuki, Oshiro Maeda, Lily Franky, Kirin Kiki\n\nOur Little Sister is the English-language title for Umimachi Diary which is based on an award-winning josei manga series created by Akimi Yoshida and published in 2006. The ever-popular Hirokazu Koreeda is bringing this live-action adaptation of the manga Umimachi Diary. Many film-critics and fans know his work even if they don’t know that much about Japanese cinema. If I were to be cynical I would say it is because he is the only contemporary director closest in style to Yasujiro Ozu. The truth is that his films with Kiseki, and Like Father, Like Son proving very popular with international audiences (Kiseki, especially). Koreeda has won an award at Cannes with his film\n\nSo yeah, Hirokazu Koreeda is a regular at Cannes with four films getting presented there and he won the Jury award for Like Father, Like Son. He brings back a lot of collaborators from previous films like Lily Franky (Judge!) and Jun Fubuki (Like Father, Like Son), Kirin Kiki, Oshiro Maeda (the cuter younger brother in Kiseki), and Haruka Ayase (Real). It looks like a solid drama and it’s in the main competition category.\n\n29-year-old Sachi Kouda (Ayase), 22-year-old Yoshino Kouda (Nagasawa), and 19-year-old Chika Kouda (Kaho) live in a house once owned by their grandmother in Kamakura. Their parents are divorced, their father having left them fifteen years ago. When they learn of their father’s death they decide to attend his funeral where they meet their 14-year-old sister Suzu Asano (Hirose) who has nobody to care for her. Sachi invites her to join them in Kamakura.\n\nWebsite\n\nJourney to the Shore\n\nJapanese: 岸辺の旅\n\nRomaji: Kishibe no Tabe\n\nRelease Date: July 25th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 128 mins.\n\nDirector: Kiyoshi Kurosawa\n\nWriter: Shin Adachi (Screenplay), Kazumi Yumoto (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Tadanobu Asano, Eri Fukatsu\n\nThe second film is Journey to the Shore, directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. I’m a big fan of his work. I have seen 12 out of 17 of his features and 3 of his 13 straight to DVD features (I wrote a biography about the chap). After the critical success of Tokyo Sonata and years as a teacher at Tokyo University of the Arts he has moved from being a horror auteur creating scary and intelligent movies like Pulse and Cure to respectable mainstream titles. His last two projects were Real and Seventh Code. The first was a pretty dull psychological adventure that wasted some great actors while the second was a quirky adventure/promo for the idol Atsuko Maeda. He has considerable form with Cannes considering four of his films have been presented there and Tokyo Sonata won the Jury Prize in the Un Certain Regard category in 2008.\n\nKurosawa is adapting the 2010 novel Kishibe no Tabi by Kazumi Yumoto and to bring to life the characters he has two actors who should be familiar to Japanese film fans. Taking the male lead is Tadanobu Asano, star of Vital, Ichi the Killer, and Gohatto. More recently he has picked up awards for acting in the film, Watashi no Otoko. Eri Fukatsu is a great actor who will be a little less well-known but a star turn in the crime drama Villain put her on the radar. She has also cropped up in fun Koki Mitani comedies like The Magic Hour and Ghost of a Chance. Journey to the Shore plays in the Un Certain Regard category.\n\nNo trailer.\n\nMizuki’s (Fukatsu) husband Yusuke (Asano) disappeared for three years. Then one day, he comes back and asks Mizuki to go on a journey with him visiting all of the places he went to and all of the people he met while he was travelling. Mizuki begins to understand why Yusuke went on his journey.\n\nWebsite\n\nYakuza Apocalypse: The Great War of the Underworld\n\nJapanese: 極道大戦争\n\nRomaji: Goku dou dai sensou\n\nRelease Date: June 20th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 125 mins.\n\nDirector: Takashi Miike\n\nWriter: Yoshitaka Yamaguchi (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Hayato Ichihara, Riko Narumi, Lily Franky, Reiko Takashima, Kiyohio Shibukawa, Sho Aoyagi, Mio Yuki, Pierre Taki, Denden, Yayan Ruhian, Yuki Sakurai,\n\nThe third film is Yakuza Apocalypse: The Great War of the Underworld, and it is part of the Director’s Fortnight which is a section for directors who have already competed at Cannes to get their film screened. It has already generated considerable buzz amongst Asian film fans. Well, those of us who grew up watching Japanese cinema during the ‘90s and delighted in Miike’s weird titles like Gozu, The Happiness of the Katakuri’s, and Visitor Q, because it looks like it is a return to form! After years producing big-budget titles like 13 Assassins and Ninja Kids!!! he is fulfilling a promise and returning to his roots making wacky and action-packed films. Here’s the quote from Twitch:\n\n“Take a hike, boring Japanese productions! Against everyone’s wishes, I’m going back to my roots on this one, and plan to go on a real rampage with Yakuza Apocalypse… I hope my cast and crew, and even myself make it out alive.”\n\nThat’s what I like to read, a filmmaker willing to die in order to make something awesome, and judging by the trailer he is as good as his word. Miike has been to Cannes three times so far with Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai, For Love’s Sake, and Shield of Straw, this looks like his best offering so far.\n\nAkira (Ichihara) is inspired the by fearsome reputation of the so-called “invincible” yakuza boss Genyo Kamiura (Franky) to become a yakuza himself. What he finds is not what he expected. His fellow gangsters don’t play by old-school rules of loyalty and honour. Even worse, they treat him like a fool and his sensitive skin means he cannot tattoos. Things change when Akira gets caught up in an assassination attempt on Genyo…\n\nWebsite\n\nSweet Red Bean Paste\n\nJapanese: 極道大戦争\n\nRomaji: An\n\nRelease Date: May 30th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 113 mins.\n\nDirector: Naomi Kawase,\n\nWriter: Naomi Kawase (Screenplay), Tetsuya Akikawa (Original Novel),\n\nStarring: Masatoshi Nagase, Kirin Kiki, Kyara Uchida, Etsuko Ichihara, Miki Mizuno, Taiga, Wakato Kanematsu, Miyoko Asada.\n\nI can claim to have a good understanding of all of the directors I have written about so far because I have seen a lot of their work but Naomi Kawase is a complete unknown to me but she has achieved a lot in her career, more than many of her male contemporaries in the Japanese film industry.\n\nShe has been to Cannes five times. In 1997, her first visit, she won the Caméra d’or for her feature Moe No Suzaku and since then she has been a regular guest. In 2007, her film The Mourning Forest won the Grand Prix at that year’s Cannes film festival.\n\nAfter getting released from prison Sentarou (Nagase) worked hard to become the manager of a dorayaki bakery store. An older woman, Tokue (Kiki), is hired to work at the store, making the sweet red bean paste that fills the dorayaki. Her sweet red beans become popular and the store flourishes, but a rumour spreads that Tokue once had leprosy.\n\nWebsite\n\nCannes Classics\n\nThe Cannes Classics section was established in 2004 and this is the section of the festival where rediscovered and restored classic films are screened. The big title her is Battles Without Honor and Humanity and this marks the first time that a Toei production has screened in the programme and will probably be the first festival in a long tour.\n\nBattles Without Honor and Humanity\n\nJapanese Title: 仁義なき戦い\n\nRomaji: Jingi Naki Tatakai\n\nRelease Date: January 13th, 1973 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 99 mins.\n\nDirector: Kinji Fukasaku\n\nWriter: Kazuo Kasahara (Screenplay), Koichi Iiboshi (Original Newspaper Reports),\n\nStarring: Bunta Sugawara, Hiroki Matsukata, Kunie Tanaka, Eiko Nakamura, Tsunehiko Watase, Goro Ibuki,\n\nKinji Fukasaku is famous for two films. A younger generation will know him from Battle Royale, cinephiles and an older generation will say it is Battles Without Honor and Humanity, a bleak crime story shot in a documentary style. It’s pretty famous for signalling the end of traditional yakuza films by having gritty violence, hypocrisy, betrayal, and assassinations instead of chivalry and heroic bloodshed like older films in the genre. It’s because it is based a screenplay which adapted a series of newspaper articles by journalist Koichi Iiboshi and his work was based on a manuscript originally written by real-life yakuza Kozo Mino who gave away lots of secrets from his world.\n\nBattles Without Honor and Humanity became part of an award winning series and the prestigious Kinema Junpo magazine named it fifth on a list of the Top 10 Japanese Films of All Time in 2009. According to the Cannes film festival website, the film has been “restored from 4K 35mm print original negative into 2K digital by TOEI LABO TECH.” Find out more from Wikipedia to discover the fascinating history of the film.\n\nIt is 1946 and in the teeming open-air black markets of post-war, bombed-out Hiroshima, a young ex-soldier and street thug named Shozo Hirono (Sugawara) and his friends find themselves in a new war between different yakuza factions. After joining boss Yamamori, Shozo is drawn into a feud with his sworn brother’s family, the Dois.\n\nZangiku Monogatari (The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum)\n\nJapanese Title: 残菊物語\n\nRomaji: Zangiku Monogatari\n\nRelease Date: October 13th, 1939 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 143 mins.\n\nDirector: Kenji Mizoguchi\n\nWriter: Yoshikata Yoda, Matsutaro Kawaguchi (Screenplay), Shofu Muramatsu (Original Novel),\n\nStarring: Shotaro Hanayagi, Kokichi Takada, Gonjuro Kawarazaki,Yoko Umemura, Tokusaburo Arashi, Kakuko Mori,\n\nKenji Mizoguchi, the genius behind Ugetsu Monogatari and Sansho Dayu (two of the greatest films I have ever seen), helped popularise Japanese films in the west. This is one of his works from the middle of his career and the info on Wikipedia makes it sound like a real treat for cinephiles. That Tony Rayns called it “the peak of Mizoguchi’s art,” makes this sound really impressive to me since Ugetsu Monogatari had an extremely profound effect on me as a teen since it cemented my love of cinema and want to learn more about it. It’s available in the UK as part of a box-set courtesy of Artificial Eye!\n\nNo trailer, alas. Image from this page.\n\nKikunosuke (Hanayagi), the adopted son of a famous kabuki actor (Kawarazaki) and is being groomed to follow in his theatrical footsteps. It all goes wrong when he falls in love with Otoku (Mori), his stepbrother’s wet nurse, and is forced to cut ties with the kabuki troupe and make his own career with only Otoku willing to help.\n\nRan\n\nJapanese Title: 乱\n\nRomaji: Ran\n\nRelease Date: May 31st, 1985 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 162 mins.\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nWriter: Akira Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni, Masato Ide (Screenplay), William Shakespeare (Original Play “King Lear”),\n\nStarring: Tatsuya Nakadai, Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu, Daisuke Ryu, Mieko Harada, Yoshiko Miyazaki, Hisashi Igawa,\n\nAdding to the sense that the newer generation of directors can’t get a look in with festivals, we have golden age directors alongside Koreeda and Miike! Anyway, Ran, I must admit I have seen a lot of Kurosawa’s films but I have not watched Ran… It gets lots and lots of praise from many critics. Kurosawa has adapted Shakespeare plays into movies set in Japan before (most famously with Macbeth which is used in Throne of Blood) and this looks like an epic take on King Lear. People can now see it on the beach at Cannes.\n\nAccording to the Cannes website, the original negative was “scanned in 4K and restored frame by frame in 4k by Éclair. Image and sound restoration under STUDIOCANAL supervision with Kadokawa (Japanese co-producer). Color grading approved by Mr. Ueda (cinematographer), Akira Kurosawa’s close associate on the film.”\n\nLord Hidetora Ichimonji (Nakadai) has reached the age of 70 and wants to divide his domain amongst his three sons with Taro (Terao), the eldest, ruling with his other sons’ Jiro (Nezu) and Saburo (Ryu) given different castles but they don’t like the way that power has been divided and start plotting against each other…\n\nSo yeah, that’s a great line-up of Japanese films whatever the complaints about the lack of youth and women! Newer Japanese filmmakers seem to have a more receptive arena in places like Rotterdam, Berlin, and Vancouver as well as Nippon Connection, Sitges and Locarno which is why I cover the first three. I’ll try and keep you posted about reviews of some of the features in a follow-up post!\n\nHappy weekend, everyone!\n\nThe 2015 Cannes Film Festival is going to commence next week and I posted about the Japanese contingent that would be in France. I’m looking forward to seeing the coverage they will get and seeing if they live up to expectations. I’ll post about them when the festival ends. I also posted a review of the Atsuko Maeda x Kiyoshi Kurosawa film Seventh Code (2013). I hope to get a couple of more reviews completed before the end of the month and I’m thinking of taking time off work to do that.\n\nWhat’s released in Japanese cinemas this weekend?\n\nPoison Berry in My Brain\n\nJapanese: 脳内ポイズンベリー\n\nRomaji: Nounai Poison Berry\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 121 mins.\n\nDirector: Yuichi Sato\n\nWriter: Tomoko Aizawa (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yoko Maki, Yuki Furukawa, Hidetoshi Nishijima, Ryunosuke Kamiki, Yo Yoshida, Hiyori Sakurada, Kazuyuki Asano, Songha,\n\nI like the concept of this one because it allows people with massively different personalities to fight with each other for control of the brain of one character or work together. Comedy will surely ensue when you have genki girls and boys played by Ryunosuke Kamiki and Hiyori Sakurada matching wits with a miserable looking prim and proper types in the shape of Hidetoshi Nishijima (License to Live) and Yo Yoshida. The person who has them in their head is played by Yoko Maki, a lady who put in star turns in The Ravine of Goodbye, and Like Father, Like Son two 2013 films to steal the show.\n\nIchiko (Maki) is a thirty-year-old unemployed woman who meets the much younger Ryoichi (Furukawa) at a bar. She totally falls for him but love may not run so smoothly since Ichiko has 5 different characters in her brain and they work together to operate her actions. The ostensible leader is middle-aged Yoshida (Nishijima), who oversees the stern pessimist ikeda (Yoshida), the younger and more optimistic Ishibashi (Kamiki), and Hatoko (Sakurada), a girl who lives in the moment, and the rather calmer and more experienced Kishi (Asano) who thinks about the past.\n\nWebsite\n\nMiss Hokusai\n\nJapanese Title: 百日紅 ～Miss HOKUSAI～\n\nRomaji: Sarusuberi～Miss HOKUSAI～\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: N/A\n\nDirector: Keiichi Hara\n\nWriter: Miho Maruo (Screenplay), Hinako Sugiura (Original Creator),\n\nStarring: Anne Watanabe (O-Ei), Yutaka Matsushige (Tetsuzo/Katsushika Hokusai), Shion Shimizu (O-Nao), Kumiko Aso (Sayogoromo), Kengo Kora (Utagawa Kuninao), Gaku Hamada (Zenjiro/Keisai Eisen), Jun Miho (Koto), Michitaka Tsutsui (Katsugoro/Totoya Hokkei), Danshun Tatekawa (Manjido),\n\nI have written about this film quite a bit so I’ll link through to this post which has a lot of details on the staff, cast, and the origins of the project. Suffice it to say that I am excited about this important story coming to light especially with the direction of Keiichi Hara who showed his skill with the film Colorful, a title that made me cry due to my attachment to the story and characters.\n\nProduction I.G describes the story of Miss Hokusai:\n\nThe time: 1814.\n\nThe place: Edo, now known as Tokyo. One of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.\n\nA much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\n\nThird of Tetsuzo’s four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father’s talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. “We’re father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.”\n\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\n\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai’s daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.\n\nWebsite\n\nZutaboro\n\nJapanese: ズタボロ\n\nRomaji: Zutaboro\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 110 mins.\n\nDirector: Hajime Hashimoto\n\nWriter: Izumi Takahashi (Screenplay), Gettsu Itaya (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Tasuku Nagase, Fumika Shimizu, Atsushi Arai, Takuya Ishida, Arata Horii Eiki Narita,\n\nOh no… Izumi Takahashi is writing this. His films are boring. Vanished and The Devil’s Path are soporific. I did not get along with them and felt that the narratives tended towards cramming so much in they become muddled. This projects looks utterly derivative of those battling yankee movies like Crows Zero and Gachiban. This is the sequel to a film released a few years ago…\n\nKoichi (Nagase), Yakko (Arai) and Kyamu graduate from the same middle school and attend high school. Instead of studying, the guys join a motorcycle gang and get into fights. It is far from fun and games for the boys because Yakko becomes the victim of bullying in the gang and it shatters his confidence. Koichi is angered and joins the yakuza to avenge his friend much to his mother’s horror.\n\nWebsite\n\nGeki x Cine Aonoran\n\nJapanese: ゲキ×シネ「蒼の乱」\n\nRomaji: Geki x Cine Aonoran\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 168 mins.\n\nDirector: Hidenori Inoue\n\nWriter: Kazuki Nakashima (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yuki Amami, Kenichi Matsuyama, Taichi Saotome, Zen Kajihara, Miharu Morina, Shoko Takada, Jun Hashimoto, Makoto Awane, Mikijiro Hira\n\nYuki Amami (Black Angel 2, Ponyo) and Kenichi Matsuyama (Detroit Metal City, Norwegian Wood, Shindo) takes parts in an epic Chinese civil war drama where the two play a married couple fighting for the rights of heavily taxed peasants, Matsuyama being a cool samurai from Japan (I think).\n\nWebsite\n\n17 Short Lived\n\nJapanese: 7才の別れ\n\nRomaji: 7 sai no Wakare\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 110 mins.\n\nDirector: Takao Saiki\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: Michiko Miyagi (storyteller), Norie Ishida (singer/song writer), Yui Kakazu (girl in flashback), Aya Nanbu (dancer) Tomishiro High School Girls,\n\nThere’s a lot of anger over the way US forces in Japan are based in Okinawa and a lot of resentment over the way Tokyo treats the island. That’s partly because during the way, military generals in Tokyo gave the order for civilians to commit suicide instead of surrendering to US forces and many did. Okinawa became a battleground and the natives of the island were caught between US forces and Tokyo. This documentary gives us an insight into some of the tragic tales that went on.\n\nMichiko Miyagi is a survivor from the chaos of the battle of Okinawa and she about her life-changing experiences after 44 years of silence brought on because she thought she would be arrested by the Japanese government if she did. She was one of many high school girls drafted into a nursing army of sorts. This student corps was given basic training and sent onto the battlefield as nurses where nearly two hundred died. It was all hushed up by the Japanese government but Michiko never forgot and now she is speaking out about it.\n\nWebsite\n\nMake Room\n\nJapanese: メイクルム\n\nRomaji: Meikurumu\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 86 mins.\n\nDirector: Kei Morikawa\n\nWriter: Kei Morikawa (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Aki Morita, Beni Itoh, Riri Kuribayashi, Nanami Kawakami, Mariko Sumiyoshi,\n\nThis indie title was the big winner of Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival’s Grand Prix earlier this year and it has travelled to the Udine Far East Film Festival:\n\nDirector Kei Morikawa draws from his experiences as a former adult-video director for this comedy which stars some AV actresses. It looks like a similar deal to Be My Baby in the sense that it’s effectively a stage play with a limited set and lots of talking.\n\nThe comedy revolves around a porn shoot and the antics that happen in the make-up room.\n\nWebsite\n\nAugust in Tokyo\n\nJapanese: 愛の小さな歴史\n\nRomaji: Ai no Chisana Rekishi\n\nRelease Date: May 09th, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 81 mins.\n\nDirector: Ryutaro Nakagawa\n\nWriter: Ryutaro Nakagawa (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Eriko Nakamura, Takashi Okito, Asaka Nakamura, Sosuke Ikematsu, Ken Mitsuishi, Manami Takahashi, Ayaka Ikezawa Yuriko Mishina,\n\nThe title translates as A Small History of Love, which is enigmatic. Director Ryutaro Nakagawa is a relative unknown but making waves with films like Plastic Love Story featuring in film festivals. I have seen that film and it is very beautiful and full of raw emotions. I’ll have to get around to reviewing it. This new film of his stars hot new actor Sosuke Ikematsu (How Selfish I Am!), Eriko Nakamura (Love’s Whirlpool) and the ever dependable Ken Mitsuishi (Noriko’s Dinner Table, Rent-a-Cat). It looks really dramatic.\n\nIn a corner of Tokyo, a man named Natsuo lives as a yakuza and a woman named Natsuki works part-time. Although they rarely think about their families, they attempt to reunite with them. Brother and sister, father and daughter; the distance between them begins to shrink, but… This film portrays the dynamics of people trying to co-exist in nature and in the city. Even though two individuals may be insignificant in the context of a large society, one life meets another and they move forward. This is a movie about their small footsteps.\n\nWebsite\n\nIt seems that reviews of films containing Fumi Nikaido grow to mammoth proportions and this is another long one for a film released in June of last year. I’ve done my best to avoid spoilers and barely mention what happens in the second half of the film. Read on if you care or dare because this film is about some taboo subject-matter.\n\nMy Man\n\nJapanese Title:私の男\n\nRomaji: Watashi no Otoko\n\nRunning Time: 128 mins\n\nRelease Date: June 14th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nDirector: Kazuyoshi Kumakiri\n\nWriter: Takashi Ujita (Screenplay), Kazuki Sakuraba (Novel)\n\nStarring: Fumi Nikaido, Tadanobu Asano, Aoba Kawai, Kengo Kora, Tatsuya Fuji, Taiga, Itsuki Sagara,\n\n“Parents. They f*ck you up.” – Philip Larkin\n\nThat quote seems apt for Watashi no Otoko, a beautiful but dark film that is sure to challenge all viewers. It starts off with a disaster, one that strips a girl of her family, and gets darker as she gets a new family. If I make a reference to the novel/film Lolita you will know the territory. A spirit of corruption hovers over the characters in the film, one that takes the bonds of family and poisons them with the perversion of incest and director Kazuyoshi Kumakiri makes no bones about being somewhat explicit while exploring the effects of an incestuous love affair on the characters.\n\nEvents start with a flashback to the past. An earthquake and tsunami has struck Okushiri Island just off Hokkaido and through one survivor we get a child’s disorientating and terrifying perspective of the disaster. A 10-year-old girl named Hana has escaped death but both of her parents have perished. She ends up in a disaster centre, a thin waif in white pyjamas wandering alone down dark dank corridors and through rooms at night before she strikes out for home with just a bottle of water. All about her corpses lie on the ground. Then she is discovered at her house by a rescue worker lighting the night with a candle, a handsome strong-looking 26-year-old man named Jungo Kusarino (Asano), a cook for the coastguard. He takes her hand in his and gently asks her questions before declaring, “You’re mine now.” When asked by another rescue worker what he is doing with Hana he states, “I found one. My daughter.”\n\nThe audience’s alarm bells are surely ringing over this situation and fellow disaster workers are equally suspicious. People around Jungo question him, how can he just take this girl he has “rescued” as his daughter? It turns out he is a distant relative and in the middle of a disaster a few words from a friend facilitates a deal with local authorities allowing Jungo to adopt Hana. “I’ll be her father. I want to have a family, too,” he states. One man with knowledge of Jungo’s background, Oshio (Fuji) a town elder says, “You aren’t good enough to have a family.” As tantalising as that little line of dialogue is for the audience, a quick glance from Jungo silences him especially with Hana around. “I’ve said too much,” Oshio smiles before backing down.\n\nJungo gets his way and both he and Hana board a car and ride off into the night, Jungo’s hand holds hers tightly, the camera focussing on his fingers caressing hers, and his words are all we hear as the darkness envelops the screen, “From today I’m all yours.”\n\nThe story resumes in the future, in a snowbound port town in Hokkaido. It is a serene place, cold and pristine, where the community clings together tightly and everybody knows each other. Hana has grown up. She is a beautiful middle school girl (Nikaido) bursting with laughter and brimming with happiness, popular with those around her. Jungo is in a relationship with Komachi (Kawai), a clerk at a local bank who is also the granddaughter of Oshio. Many expect Jungo and Komachi to marry which would help Hana gain a stable family life again since he is at sea a lot with the coastguard and she is alone but there is something strange about Jungo and Hana’s relationship and Komachi begins to scent something is amiss.\n\nIt starts with Jungo’s distance. She has to make every effort to visit him when he returns to shore, not vice versa. Komachi finds his lovemaking mostly passionless on his part, Asano looking positively bored and lumpen, his mind elsewhere during explicit steamy sex scenes with the sultry and sexy Kawai who bravely displays much of her beautiful and lithe body. There are major social slights like gifts Komachi thought Jungo bought for her on long trips actually being intended for Hana. And we come to the girl raised by Jungo…\n\nThat happy smiling girl exhibits strange behaviour when it comes to Jungo. Komachi, jealous about the gift, finds Hana out playing with her friends and their conversation turns to Jungo which is where things get slightly weird as Hana shows the same observations, care and knowledge of her man that a housewife would. What starts out as a friendly conversation about playing with friends, “Mai nichi tanoshii/毎日たのしい？” turns confrontational as Hana probes Komachi’s feelings for Jungo. The audience will get a shock as they hear Hana lecture Komachi about who Jungo needs as a life partner (a blood relative) and in a few words and with her sweet smile she reveals her possessiveness. This doesn’t go unnoticed by an already jealous Komachi and an increasingly worried Oshio.\n\nAs Komachi begins to get a better understanding of what lies behind the “family” unit that Hana and Jungo have established, the childishness of Hana’s behaviour becomes tainted with fears over the danger the girl might be in. Characters witness the way that Hana and Jungo always separate themselves from others and remain close together as seen in the party that Oshio throws for many in town. There is the way Hana is constantly caressing Jungo and the way he gives in and fondly returns her touches, and the fixation with fingers that was established in the opening of the film takes on more erotic tones.\n\nIt is clear that they have grown interdependent upon each other and love each other but is it going too far? The film teases us.\n\nThe very slow rhythm of the film builds through naturalistic direction which shows characters going about their daily lives and allows a highly textured portrait of the relationship between Hana and Jungo that gets increasingly darker. We see the way the world slowly begin to admit to the strangeness that it was always suspicious of, ever so slowly, to ensure that audiences are dragged over the coals of expectations over what will happen next.\n\nThen the film takes a step into pure darkness after teasing us for so long with whether Hana is a victim of Jungo’s upbrining and whether the two will take things into taboo territory. The couple finally give in fully to their mutual desire for each other in what I consider to be one of the most disturbing sex scenes I have witnessed. We knew it was coming but the sight of it is still off-putting and those with weak stomachs may turn off at this point. Jungo is soon caressing and gripping Hana’s body, the girl returning his passion knowing full well what she is doing to him and herself and framing it as one of sacrifice for the both of them in the grip of loneliness. It is sickening but the director hooks the audience back in by shooting the scene in a stylised and surreal way. The lovers are covered in a rain of blood symbolic of their passion and suggesting darker narrative turns and to remind us that we have spent the last hour watching a psychological drama.\n\nAlthough disturbing it is not exploitative or sleazy. Kumakiri’s direction and scriptwriter Takashi Ujita’s writing has, up until this point, weaved interesting details about these two characters and teased the audience with what drives them and it is the trauma of the disaster that Hana survived (she has terrifying flashbacks to the fateful night when her real father rescued her and her new father Jungo took her in) and an unfathomable loneliness that the two feel and the love, no matter how awful, that they give each other that makes their relationship work. This idea of isolation is emphasised by the landscapes they inhabit and the shot composition. Hana often anxiously waits alone for Jungo’s return from his duty on a coastguard ship. In their snowbound town they are sometimes the only dash of colour in the snowy scenes, the rest of the world blank, devoid of people.\n\nFrom this point the film descends into a melancholy tale of inertia, lonely desperation and self-destructive desire as the illicit relationship is threatened with exposure and the characters finally come up against the limits of their bond in a society where their ‘love’ is forbidden. A trip to Tokyo reveals just how far the two are willing to defend their connection and how they cannot give each other up.\n\nDirector Kazuyoshi’s script and the brilliantly subtle and nuanced performance from lead actor Fumi Nikaido delicately balance things for a lot of the movie ensuring that an observant audience pick up on a lot of details and atmosphere. The director exhibits a lot of control and focus in showing the characters psychodrama, the camera lingering on Hana and Jungo as they cast longing gazes or think things over and interact with other and this leads me to praise what really makes the film work which is Nikaido and Asano’s performance.\n\nI am convinced that Fumi Nikaido is on her way to becoming the best actress in Japan (if not already there). I can think of few who match her commitment to roles where she can tell the audience some of the most complex things with the change of a facial expression and the way she holds herself. She handles Hana perfectly so we are never sure how much of a victim she is, how much of a dependency she has for Jungo and whether it was been fostered by him and if she has set out to do the same thing to him. Hana’s actions could be mistaken for teenage whimsy but there is always a layer of fierce passion underneath them that is unsettling. Nikaido is brilliant at conveying the confusion and damage from her past and the desire for her present that lie within her core.\n\nFumi Nikaido effortlessly creates a murky picture of the character so we can never be too sure what to make of her as she details the transition from perky school girl devoted to the closed-off world she has with Jungo, a man she loves, to the damaged and distant young woman at the end. Nikaido has the skill to disappear into characters and the look she gives at the end of the film will remain long with the viewer as they try and work out how to read this rotten relationship.\n\nAsano was also incredible, making his character a complex, if a little too opaque man rather than a monster. Initially trim and well-built, he undergoes something of a physical transformation after relocating to Tokyo, putting on more weight and coming across as seedier. Despite his transgressions I felt some sympathy for him in his confused emotional state and desires. He is a violent and vile man who battled with his own demons and loneliness and failed, his own confusion over the role of lover and father stingingly made clear in the end when he says “I just want to be a father,” after a drunken encounter with a man interested in Hana near the end of the film.\n\nAoba Kawai also deserves special mention as Komachi, a woman unable to come to terms with what she is uncovering about Hana and Jungo hopeful but suspicious and gradually increasingly devastated and sickened with each turn of the story, mirroring the audience.\n\nThat the film never became too disgusting to watch is down to the strong performances and interesting script but despite these fine performances the only downside to the film is that by being too opaque about character motivations thwarts audience understanding of Jungo and his motivations. I would have liked more of an understanding of what drives Jungo and felt the second half of the film could have done with more time to explored him but the relationship between Jungo and Hana and the girl’s transformation makes for a strong engine regardless and I guess that getting a straight answer to those questions would be difficult just like in real life.\n\n4/5\n\nI wasn’t the only one convinced about the brilliance of the acting because Fumi Nikaido and Tadanobu Asano both picked up awards at different film festivals!\n\nNippon Connection launches next month and the programme has been released. It looks incredible.\n\nThis is the 15th Nippon Connection festival and it takes place from June 02nd to 07th, 2015 in Frankfurt, Germany. This is the first year that I will write about this festival.\n\nIt is a chance to get a deep and varied insight into Japanese cinema with everything from classics to contemporary titles, anime and live-action, a healthy dose of the latest films not yet released in Japan and many from the ‘80s. There are more than 100 short and feature films, and a retrospective of the works of director Shinji Somai. There are also stars in attendance with the super actors Tadanobu Asano and Sakura Ando and the director Ryuichi Hiroki at the festival. Tadanobu Asano will receive the first Nippon Honor Award and he will perform a live soundtrack concert together with the band Stereo Total.\n\nIf you check the festival site you will see many great films on offer at the festival but placing so many trailers into one post would be a bit much so I will highlight what I think are the best out of each category, the notable titles and the ones that will be rarer for Europeans/Westerners to catch outside of the festival. Of course you can ignore all this advice and just click on the links to be taken to the film’s page on the festival website where more coherent text, a trailer, and images are located. Without further ado here’s the highlights and all of the rest of the films that will screen at this year’s Nippon Connection:\n\nNippon Cinema\n\nThere are a lot contemporary titles in here and it gives a great indication of the strength of films on the more mainstream front with films from familiar favourites such as Takashi Miike, Shinya Tsukamoto, SABU, Nobuhiro Yamashita, and Ryuichi Nakamura getting screened. This section allows the audience will once again be able to bestow the Nippon Cinema Award upon their favourite film with a cash prize going to the winner.\n\nFrom my perspective the main thing about this category is making the most of seeing what will look great on the big screen, the presence of actors/directors at a screening, and seeing films that probably won’t see on DVD (or online) any time soon. There are plenty of titles that will probably disappear once they leave the festival circuit so this is an opportune chance. The two exceptions to that rule are The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi which is a fun film and there will be a breakfast buffet(!!) and The World of Kanako (getting a release in the west courtesy of Third Window Films) which was a breath taking when I saw it in a cinema. That still leaves plenty of other films to choose from so here would be my selections:\n\nFIRES ON THE PLAIN, 野火, Nobi (2014 ) Dir: Shinya Tsukamoto\n\nThe film Fires on the Plain follows a demoralised Japanese army in the Philippines. We see how bad things are for the Japanese troops through the desperate struggle of a conscript named Tamura (Shinya Tsukamoto) who is sick with TB and forced into the field by a commander who cannot waste resources on a dying man. Tamura doesn’t want to give up so easily and clings to life but it is a struggle that will lead him down a dark path that hint at some of the atrocities carried out by soldiers…\n\nFires on the Plain is based upon the 1951 Yomiuri Prize-winning novel of the same name and that was then adapted into a film in 1959 by Kon Ichikawa. It took Tsukamoto 20 years to bring his adaptation of the film to the screen and from what I have read, it’s tough, brutal, troubling, and realistic and, thanks to Tsukamoto’s vision, it puts you right in the heart of war. This is an anti-war film so it has to be brutal… and that trailer. It looks. Wow! I think this will be an intense journey. His visual imagination has been incredible in past films such as Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Tokyo Fist so seeing Fires on the Plain on the big screen will be quite the experience if you have the stomach for death and destruction.\n\nKABUKICHO LOVE HOTEL, さよなら歌舞伎町, Sayonara Kabukicho (2014) Dir: Ryuichi Hiroki\n\nRyuichi Hiroki has two films at the festival, this and Her Granddaughter. As far as I am concerned this one has the superior\n\ncast and the more interesting story with its set-up plunging us into the disparate lives of people connected to a love hotel over the course of 24 hours in Tokyo’s Kabukicho. Ryuichi Hiroki is a master at maneouveing multiplie narratives in modern tales as I discovered in Kimi no Tomodachi so I believe in the promise of drama and dry comedy from performances by great actors!\n\nShota Sometani, Jun Murakami, Tomorowo Taguchi are the male actors and between the three of them they have amassed an impressive set of performances with great directors. I am excited by the presence of former idol girls such as Atsuko Maeda and Miwako Wagatsuma who are going beyond the typical idol girl confines of popcorn flicks and frothy romances and challenging themselves, working on interesting projects with notable directors.\n\nThere’s a good chance this will be at other festivals but will Ryuichi Hiroki be at that festival? Will you be able to ask him questions about films like Vibrator or his pink films?\n\nSEVEN WEEKS 野のなななのかNo no nanananoka (2014) Dir: Nobuhiko Obayashi\n\nThe story kicks off with the funeral of doctor Mitsuo Suzuki which brings his family back to snowy Sapporo. From there, a family story unfolds that dates back to the Second World War.\n\nNobuhiko Obayashi is a legend and he’s still cranking out films even though he has reached his 70s. People in the west know him for House and (maybe) School in the Crosshairs but little else. In effect, based on these two films, he has the reputation of having a crazy visual style and making films that are fun to watch. I think it would be fascinating to see what he makes now.\n\nI remember having trouble translating the story for a trailer post and didn’t expect it to travel to the west but it has and it looks like a rare opportunity to catch a genuine indie film from a venerable talent. Some film critics based in Japan have sung the praises of this film. Don Brown at the Asahi Shimbun, “Numerous domestic dramas are made in Japan every year with little ambition other than capturing the mundaneness of everyday life. But the jaded viewer will be shocked by Obayashi’s sprawling family saga and its distinctive stylized approach that diverges into various thematic tangents.”\n\nA rare gem then!\n\n100 YEN LOVE, 百円の恋Hyakuen no koi, (2014), Dir: Masaharu Take\n\nKazuko (Sakura Ando) is a hikikomori who lives at her parents’ home but that situation changes when her younger sister divorces and moves back with her child. Kazuko and her sister’s relationship is pretty rocky and the two fight which makes Kazuko move out and find a place of her own. While working at a 100 Yen shop she keeps encountering a middle-aged boxer (Hirofumi Arai) who practices at a local boxing gym. She is attracted to him and the two start a relationship which will fuel the continuing change in her life.\n\nThis film has Sakura Ando in the lead role as a hikikomori who uses boxing to turn her life around. I would watch her in anything. Alongside Fumi Nikaido, she is one of Japan’s best young actors and Sakura Ando will be at the festival!. It has gotten great reviews as seen in Variety and Japan Times and it offers a positive story.\n\nThese are my top choices for this section. Here’s the list of films in full:\n\n100 YEN LOVE, THE BLIND SWORDSMAN: ZATOICHI, BLINDLY IN LOVE, CHASUKE’S JOURNEY, A COURTESAN WITH FLOWERED SKIN, FIRES ON THE PLAIN,\n\nHER GRANDDAUGHTER, KABUKICHO LOVE HOTEL, KUMIKO, THE TREASURE HUNTER, LA LA LA AT ROCK BOTTOM My Man (My Review) OUR FAMILY, OVER YOUR DEAD BODY, PALE MOON PARASYTE: PART 1 PARASYTE: PART 2 THE ROUND TABLE SEVEN WEEKS SILENT COLOR SILENT VOICE\n\nSOLOMON’S PERJURY 1: SUSPICION SOLOMON’S PERJURY 2: JUDGMENT\n\nUZUMASA LIMELIGHT The World of Kanako (My Review), THE VOICE OF WATER\n\nNippon Visions\n\nThe indie side of Japanese cinema is located in this section and again there are many choices from a wide range of styles and genres with many directors here to introduce their works.\n\nThere are a variety of documentaries that focus on normal people in tough circumstances such as -1287 which focusses on a woman dying from cancer and Walking with my Mother which tells the story of an elderly woman (the mother of the director) dealing with the death of her husband and daughter and finding comfort in her sister who comes to her rescue. There are quite a few Fukushima documentaries that chart the aftermath of the disaster on people such as farmers in Going Against the Grain in Fukushima and children in Little Voices from Fukushima and a series of short films by Hikaru Suzuki. On the more positive side of things is The Cockpit about a group of musicians making a hip-hop track, and A Little Girl’s Dream which charts one girl’s journey from student to vet.\n\nIn recent years there have been collaborations between Japanese and Korean film production companies and universities and the two shorts Kim / Brakemode, the first a serious drama about a boxer forced to retire and forced to face debts, and Brakemode, a comedy about Japanese an Korean employees of car manufacturers working to save their prototype car after it is stolen.\n\nThere are short films from Tama Art University graduates and experimental films from Japanese/half-Japanese who have left the country and are based elsewhere in the world. Other shorts aim for the more comedic end of the scale in HELLO ZOMBIE / USE THE EYEBALLS!.\n\nI get a sense of real variety with this part of the programme because of the two and benshi performances and a pink film in the form of Treasure Ship: Latitudes of Lust\n\nI am excited to see a number of titles from the indie world and\n\nHere are my selections:\n\nHold Your Breath Like a Lover息を殺してIki o koroshite (2014) Dir: Kohei Igarashi\n\nHere’s the description of the story from the film’s page: December 30, 2017: A handful of workers spends the night in a seemingly abandoned factory, playing video games, battling out love conflicts and aimlessly walking through gloomy offices and corridors. In between, a dog gets lost and ghosts of the dead return. A dark view on a future pre-apocalyptic Japan, presented in ambiguous images exerting a unique pull.\n\nI first saw this trailer at the end of last year and tweeted it to friends after seeing an interview with the director on Midnight Eye. I have watched the trailer so many times and even had it on my phone at one point. It’s beautiful and mysterious and there’s so little known about it which makes this an exciting title to venture into blindly.\n\nObon Brothersお盆の弟Obon no ototo (2015) Dir: Akira Osaki\n\nKiyohiko Shibukawa, Ken Mitsuishi, Makiko Watanabe, Yoji Tanaka, Koki Okada, Erika Yanagita, Yumi Goto, Aoba Kawai, Miyoko Inagawa,\n\nTakeshi is a struggling film director, with a fractious home life. That’s an understatement, actually, since he has been kicked out of his house by his wife and forced to move in with his ill brother. Can Takeshi turn his life around and save his marriage?\n\nThis is another film I tweeted about after the trailer was released\n\nand it’s simple why: great cast with a story and style of filming that will get the most out of them. The trailer reminds of lovely and strange And the Mud Ship Sails Away what with the meandering, talk-heavy action shot in black and white. This film stars some great actors like the cool Kiyohiko Shibukawa, the exceptional Makiko Watanabe, and the super solid Ken Mitsuishi. There is also Aoba Kawai and Yumi Goto, two names I have gotten used to over the past year after seeing the give great performances in different films. The director and writer are in town so ask plenty of questions.\n\nSharing (2014) Dir: Makoto Shinozaki\n\nEiko (Kinuo) is a psychology teacher in a university. She lost her husband in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and this pushes her to research cases of individuals who claim to have had precognitive dreams about the disaster. One of her students, Kaoru (Asuka), is a member of the drama club, and is writing a stage a play about the disaster. The two become so engaged in their projects that it pushes friends and colleagues away from them as they become more extreme in their work and lost site of reality…\n\nThere are a number of films with backing from Office Kitano at this festival and I like the look of Sharing which was at last year’s Vancouver International Film Festival. The director is a graduate of Rikkyo University where he now teaches psychology, and has collaborated with Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Ingredients for intrigue!\n\nThere are a set of interesting looking dramas headed by 0.5MM, Chigasaki Story, Dual City, and Sceneries of New Beginnings. Out of those 0.5MM has to be the one to watch because that stars Sakura Ando!\n\n-1287 0.5MM CHIGASAKI STORY THE COCKPIT DUAL CITY\n\nGOING AGAINST THE GRAIN IN FUKUSHIMA\n\nHELLO ZOMBIE / USE THE EYEBALLS! HELLO, SUPERNOVA HIKARU SUZUKI SPECIAL HOLD YOUR BREATH LIKE A LOVER IN & OUT OF JAPAN VOL. 2\n\nJAPAN MEETS KOREA: KIM / BRAKEMODE\n\nA LITTLE GIRL’S DREAM LITTLE VOICES FROM FUKUSHIMA\n\nNO SILENCE, PLEASE! ICHIRO KATAOKA PRESENTS: OROCHI\n\nNO SILENCE, PLEASE! ICHIRO KATAOKA PRESENTS: THE POLICE OFFICER\n\nOBON BROTHERS SCENERIES OF NEW BEGINNINGS SHARING TAMA ART UNIVERSITY SPECIAL TREASURE SHIP: LATITUDES OF LUST WALKING WITH MY MOTHER\n\nNippon Animation\n\nThere is a variety of anime on show and I would say that people with kids who want to attend the festival see The Tale of The Princess Kaguya, a stunningly beautiful and intelligent film that mixes artistic skill of a highly talented director and animators to convey a story deep in Japanese culture, heartfelt tale that can appeal to adults and children who will find something to laugh at and relate to. It has already had a theatrical and home video release in Germany so you can skip it if money is an issue since we’re going after titles you may not ever see again. This being the case you can drop Appleseed Alpha because that’s already available in the West plus it’s a CG Shinji Aramaki film which in my experience means that it is guaranteed to be of less importance than some of the other titles on the programme. Another one you might want to miss is Psycho-Pass: The Movie which has great reviews but it’s only worth watching if you are familiar with the television anime. If you can get yourself up to speed with the gloriously brilliant first season and awful second season and you like your dystopian sci-fi tales this might be for you.\n\nHere’s what I would pick:\n\nShinsengumi 新選組 Shinsengumi (2000) Dir: Kon Ichikawa\n\nI had no idea that the great director Kon Ichikawa directed an anime. Not only that it’s about the Shinsengumi, the shogun’s samurai special forces, in effect. It looks pretty awesome and the festival webpage describes it as a “long-forgotten animation masterpiece… never before been screened outside of Japan.” This is why you go to film festivals. Gems like this.\n\nI would also try out some of the shorts, student films, and indie anime. This is for people who want to go beyond the glossy anime that regularly gets streamed/sold in the West and we can see what independent talents outside of the studio system and across Japan are doing. There are films created by using stop motion, hand drawn, and CG animation and it comes from a diverse array such as the Tokyo University of the Arts and indie titles from all sorts of people and studio.\n\nEverything Visible – Japanese Indie Animated Shorts is an interesting selection and not just because of the diverse works but because Dr. Catherine Munroe Hotes has programmed this section and she will be present for the films and will talk about her selections. I talked to her about programming shorts for a festival, interested in seeing how people reacted to them since they are harder to sell than features (in my mind, at least) and she kindly responded:\n\nCatherine: “The audience in Frankfurt really loves experimental / alternative fare. I am from Canada so I was amazed at first to find sold out crowds for experimental works. For this programme I chose films that had some buzz at festivals in Japan and overseas… They are not for everyone’s taste – it’s for people who want something different – I think of them as being visual poetry. I grew up watching a lot of NFB [National Film Board of Canada] animation from a young age so when I came across indie animation in Tokyo in 2006 I understood a bit. Some films I don’t get at all after a first screening and I need to watch them more than once before I understand what the artist is trying.”\n\nMe: “You actively look for artists to screen and I assume artists contact you as well.”\n\nCatherine: “I wanted to have filmmakers from all over Japan / different animation schools. “There are also people in the programme that NC regulars ask me about a lot. Like: whatever Like: whatever happened to Kato Kunio after he won the Oscar. I went to Hiroshima last year. If you check my post from last August (I think the screening was called Japan’s Animation Today) you can see who had works at that festival. I saw a work by Osamu Sakai at Wissembourg in Dec & wanted him…. I also check to see who won at various other festivals like Japan Media Arts Festival. Iwasaki is a young artist whose film won a top prize at HAFF this year so I checked him out on Vimeo & had him send me his latest work. Oh – in addition to JMAF I look at the Image Forum Festival line up every year – their curator Takashi Sawa finds amazing new works\n\nI should also mention that our animation guest Yuichi Ito (here’s his profile) is a wonderful stop motion animator. My kids loved his short short series Knyacki on the NHK when we lived in Tokyo. His visit has been made possible through the Yokohama- Frankfurt sister city organisation. It’s not on the main animation program but he’s giving a stop motion workshop for kids on the Saturday”\n\nThanks go out to Dr Catherine Munroe Hotes. I highly recommend checking out her website Nishikataeiga for all sorts of fascinating posts on Japanese animation and live-action films as well as adventures in Japan and elsewhere. For more on the films at the festival head to each of the web pages I linked to so you can see videos of some of the works.\n\nNippon Retro\n\nThis section is all about Shinji Somai and he’s pretty important in Japanese cinema but pretty much unknown in the west. His style of very long takes and letting actors do their work (Regardless of genre) and his ability to capture the most acute emotions social drama allowing stories to develop naturally has had a massive influence on other directors (Including my favourite Kiyoshi Kurosawa).\n\nI remember that the 2012 Edinburgh Film Festival had an incredible Shinji Somai retrospective (I wish I wrote about that one but didn’t focus on festivals back then). Here’s festival director Chris Fujiwara (just after he took over the festival) talking about Shinji Somai.\n\nI’ll admit that I have only watched the drama Moving and idol action title Sailor Suit and Machine Gun (and they are very good) so instead of reading my rambling notes the best thing to do is to check each film’s webpage on the festival site and make a choice. Better yet, watch the above video and listen to Chris Fujiwara who recommends Typhoon Club, Moving, The Friends, PP Rider, and Love Hotel. I will say that certain films have actors it would be fascinating to watch earlier in their career like Kaza-Hana (Tadanobu Asano, Kyoko Koizumi), Dreamy Fifteen (Shingo Tsurumi). Other films in this retrospective include Stepchildren and The Catch.\n\nThere will be film introductions and a lecture “Shinji SOMAI and the Long Take” by Aaron Gerow (Professor of Film Studies and East Asian Languages and Literatures at Yale University).\n\nWhat makes Nippon Connection impressive is that none of this stuff is happening in isolation like in other festivals, there are film screenings and connected to many of them are workshops and talks aimed at illuminating Japanese and cinema culture.\n\nNippon Kids\n\nIt’s great to see a section for children that will get them interested in film/Japanese culture and thinking about things outside of their normal lives. There’s all sorts of things like kamishibai, kendo, drawing and makeup sessions and voice acting workshops as well as a Japanese language course taught via manga and anime. There’s also The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\n\nNippon Culture\n\nThere are talks and workshops galore in Nippon Culture with an animation workshop run by Yuichi Ito, the chap who made the animated film Harbor Tale. There’s the obligatory food and art sections and an aikido workshop for people interested in martial arts and Tadanobu Asano is going to be performing with his band Stereo Total. Want to try your hand at Benshi and give voice and sound to silent movies? That’s become popular recently and there’s a workshop for that. The film talks are many and cover the famous Sakura Ando and Tadanobu Asano and indie directors, festival programmers and film lecturers and reviewers.\n\nYou’ll be glad to read that this is the end of the post. I now know why I have avoided writing about this festival for so long! There’s so much on offer and I find it hard to edit myself!! Make no mistake, this is a line-up of films to die for but then I love Japanese films so I am biased. I hope you guys have fun watching some of these films!\n\nHappy weekend, everyone! Here’s something to cheer you up:\n\nThe Cannes film festival is winding down now and I have begun collecting reviews of the Japanese films that screened for a post that acts as a follow up to the festival preview. The reviews for the Fukusaku, Koreeda, and Kurosawa films have been great. In between watching reading about Cannes I watched lots of television and films like Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa and Margin Call, the first four episodes of Cold War thriller The Game and the magical fantasy series Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. I watched plenty of anime like Kekkai Sensen and Ore Monogatari!! As well as starting City Hunter and Record of Lodoss War.\n\nOnly one post this week and that’s the films at Nippon Connection 2015. The reason it’s the only post this week is so the festival gets as much coverage as possible and it is one that is worth keeping up so randoms drawn to the site can see what is an interesting programme of films and events.\n\nThere are a lot of films at the festival I would like to see but I don’t have the money. I checked hotel prices and made a sad face :(\n\nI’ll be watching plenty of films at home instead. For Japanese people and people in Japan who want to go to a cinema, the films released this weekend are:\n\nBefore the Leaves Fall\n\nJapanese: ゆずり葉の頃\n\nRomaji: Yuzuriha no Koro\n\nRelease Date: May 23rd, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 102 mins.\n\nDirector: Mineko Okamoto\n\nWriter: Mineko Okamoto (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Kaoru Yachigusa, Tatsuya Nakadai, Ittoku Kishibe, Toru Kazama, Keiko Takeshita, Naomasa Musaka, Kyusaka Shimada, Hirotaro Honda,\n\nAn elderly lady named Michiko (Yachigusa) visits the studio of an artist she is convinced she inspired to paint a famous portrait.\n\nWebsite\n\nBuzz\n\nJapanese: 騒音\n\nRomaji: Souon\n\nRelease Date: May 23rd, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 103 mins.\n\nDirector: Tsutomu Sekine\n\nWriter: Norio Tatekawa (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yoichi Nukumizu, Toshifumi Muramatsu, Kazuko Iio, Jonio Iwai, Toshiya Sakai, You, Mari Sekine, Udo Suzuki, Keiko Toda, Makita Sports,\n\nA small town comes under attack by strange creatures called undergrounders.

The book has two main parts: “side A” set in Shizuoka when the characters played in the movie by Shota Matsuda and Atsuo Meada meet and strike up a romance. Then there is “side B,” which is set in Tokyo with chapters named after song titles which are representative of what happens in each of them.\n\nSounds intriguing but how will it play out on the big screen?\n\nIt’s directed by Yukihiko Tsutsumi (2LDK) who can do tricksy narratives with shifts in perspective. It stars Shota Matsuda and Atsuko Maeda (Seventh Code).\n\nIt is some time in the late 1980’s in Shizuoka and the character we are following is a college student named Suzuki or Takkun to his friends (Matsuda) who is attempting to find a job. He goes on a blind date and meets Mayu (Maeda), a dental hygienist, and the two hit it off and begin dating. Takkun is forced to move after he gets a job in Tokyo and heads off to the capital leaving Mayu behind. Madness…. Their long distance relationship may collapse as another woman named Miyako (Kimura) enters the picture… Oh no, romance broken… but then something is said and the film becomes a mystery in the final five minutes as a twist is revealed!!!\n\nWebsite\n\nYarukkya Knight\n\nJapanese: やるっきゃ騎士（ナイト）\n\nRomaji: Yarukkya Kishi (Naito)\n\nRelease Date: May 23rd, 2015\n\nRunning Time: 75 mins.\n\nDirector: Katsutoshi Hirabayashi\n\nWriter: Lion Hitoshizuku, Katsutoshi Hirabayashi (Screenplay), Nonki Miyasu (Original Manga),\n\nStarring: Tomoya Nakamura, Nina Endo, Reiya Masaki, Elisa Yanagi, Alexander Otsuka,\n\nWell, we nearly got half way through the year before we got one of these perv films set in a school with a dumb male lead.\n\nGousuke (Nakamura) is a school boy with “erotic powers” who loves reading hentai but he gets the shock of his life when he transfers into a new school and meets Shizuka (Endo), the president of the government club who imposes strict rules on the male students against perverted behaviour and this includes a ban on erections.

Well if you haven’t SPOILERS… but the book is about a poor orphan boy named Nello who lives in rural Belgium. He dreams of becoming a painter like his idol Reubens. He saves what little money he can scrape together and practices hard and… well, it ends badly… It is a big title in Japan and was adapted into an anime in 1975 thanks to the famous Nippon Animation’s World Masterpiece Theater which is where Studio Ghibli founders Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata got their start. Well this film is based on that book… Sort of. We start at the very last moment of the story as orphanboy Nello and his dog Patrash lay dying. Their bodies are lifted up by angels and if the original story is followed they should be going to Heaven but in this film they decide to take revenge on humanity! Nello and Patrasche now orchestrate a shadowy organization bent on destroying things, and only a dim-witted boy named Bakabon and his family and friends can stop them and save the world. Cue antics from Bakabon’s lunatic father as he gets into stupid situations to stop Nello and Patrash.\n\nWebsite\n\nNew Initial D the Movie Legend 2: Tousou\n\nJapanese: 新劇場版 頭文字D Legend2 –闘走–\n\nRomaji: Shin Gekijouban Initial D Legend 1 – Tousou –\n\nRelease Date: May 23rd, 2014\n\nRunning Time: 60 mins.\n\nChief Director: Masamitsu Hidaka, Director: Tomohito Naka\n\nWriter: Mayori Sekijima (Screenplay), Shuuichi Shigeno (Original Manga)\n\nStarring: Mamoru Miyano (Takuma Fujiwara), Yuichi Nakamura (Keisuke Takahashi), Daisuke Ono (Ryosuke Takahashi), Maaya Uchida (Natsuki Mogi), Hiroaki Shiraishi (Bunta Fujiwara), Minoru Shiraishi (Itsuki Takeuchi),\n\nThis is the second in a trilogy of films that retell the original Initial D story.\n\nHigh school student Takumi Fujiwara works at a gas station during the day and as a delivery boy for his father’s tofu shop during the night.
