The measured half-life for 2Î½2Î² decay as well as the T 1/2 limits for different modes of neutrinoless 2Î² decay of 116 Cd are reported\n\n[Growth of codoped CdWO4 crystals by Bridgman method and their optical spectra].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYu, Can; Xia, Hai-Ping; Wang, Dong-Jie; Chen, Hong-Bing\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe CdWO4 crystals with good quality in the size of Phi25 mm x 120 mm, doped with Co in 0.5% molar fraction in the raw composition, were grown by the Bridgman method by taking -70 degrees C x cm(-1) of solid-liquid interface and -0.50 mm x h(-1) growth rate. The crystal presents transparence and deep blue. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the crystals. Three absorption peaks at 518, 564 and 655 nm respectively, which are attributed to the overlapping of 4 T1 (4F) --> 4A2 (4F) and 4 T1 (4F) --> 4 T1 (4P) of Co2+ octahedrons, and a wide band centered at 1 863 nm, which is attributed to 4Ti (4F) --> 4 T2 (4F), was observed. The absorption results indicated that the Co ions presented +2 valence in crystal and located within the distorted oxygen octahedrons. The crystal-field parameter D(q) and the Racah parameter B were estimated to be 990 and 726.3 cm(-1) respectively based on the absorption spectra. A fluorescence emission at 778 nm (4T1 (4P) --> 4 T1 (4F)) for codoped CdWO4 crystals was observed under excitation by 520 nm light. It can be deduced from the changes in absorption and emission intensity of different parts of crystal that the concentration of Co2+ ion in crystal increased along growing direction and the effective distribution coefficient of Co2+ ion in CdWO4 crystal is less than 1.\n\nNd-doped Lu3Al5O12 single-crystal scintillator for X-ray imaging\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSugiyama, Makoto; Fujimoto, Yutaka; Yanagida, Takayuki; Totsuka, Daisuke; Chani, Valery; Yokota, Yuui; Yoshikawa, Akira\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe optical and scintillation properties of Nd-doped Lu 3 Al 5 O 12 (Nd:LuAG) crystals grown by the Czochralski (Cz) method were examined under X-ray excitation. Their applicability for X-ray imaging was also inspected. The radioluminescence spectrum induced by X-rays showed a broad host emission and sharp Nd 3+ 4fâ4f emission peaks in the UV to visible wavelengths. The light output current of the Nd:LuAG was 85% of that of a standard CdWO 4 X-ray scintillator. The afterglow value measured 20 ms after X-ray irradiation was 1.5%. An X-ray radiographic image was successfully obtained using the Nd:LuAG scintillator coupled with the charge coupled device (CCD) photodetector. -- Highlights: âº The Nd:LuAG single crystal was produced to perform X-ray imaging test. âº The sample exhibited the 85% light output current of the standard CdWO 4 . âº The afterglow intensity of the sample was very high compared with the CdWO 4 . âº The X-ray radiographic image was obtained from the Nd:LuAG single crystal\n\nCrystal scintillators for use in check-light source for thermoluminescent systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNagpal, J. S.; Sabharwal, S. C.; Chougaonkar, M. P.; Godbole, S. V.\n\n1999-08-01\n\nBeta ( 63Ni, Emax 0.063 MeV) excited radioluminescence of indigenously grown crystal scintillators CsI(Tl), Bi 4Ge 3O 12 and CdWO 4 has been studied for its use in check-light source needed for thermoluminescence systems. Temperature coefficient of the light output over 298-323 K and the beta-induced TL of the scintillators over 298-553 K are reported.\n\nCdWO4 polymorphs: Selective preparation, electronic structures, and photocatalytic activities\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYan, Tingjiang; Li, Liping; Tong, Wenming; Zheng, Jing; Wang, Yunjian; Li, Guangshe\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis work explored the selective synthesis of polymorphs of CdWO 4 in either tetragonal or monoclinic phase by optimizing the experimental parameters. Systematic characterization indicated that both polymorphs possessed similar spherical morphologies but different structural building blocks. Electronic structures calculations for both polymorphs demonstrated the same constructions of conduction band or valence band, while the conduction band widths of both polymorphs were quite different. Both CdWO 4 polymorphs exhibited good photocatalytic activity for degradation of methyl orange under UV light irradiation. When comparing to some other well-known tungstate oxide materials, the photocatalytic activity was found to follow such a consequence, monoclinic CdWO 4 â¼monoclinic ZnWO 4 >tetragonal CdWO 4 >tetragonal CaWO 4 . The specific photocatalytic activity of monoclinic CdWO 4 was even higher than that of commercial TiO 2 photocatalyst (Degussa P25). The increased activity from the tetragonal CdWO 4 to the monoclinic was consistent with the trend of the decreased symmetry, and this could be explained in terms of the geometric structures and electronic structures for both polymorphs. -- Graphical abstract: Monoclinic CdWO 4 exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity than the tetragonal form owing to the lower symmetry, more distorted geometric structure, and the dispersive band configuration. Display Omitted Research highlights: â Polymorphs of CdWO 4 in either tetragonal or monoclinic phase were selectively synthesized. â Both polymorphs possessed similar spherical morphologies, while the relevant structural building blocks were different. â Photocatalytic activities of CdWO 4 polymorphs depended strongly on the symmetry, geometric structure, as well as band configuration.\n\nHydrothermal synthesis of CdWO 4 nanorods and their ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nCdWO4 nanorods with wolframite structure were synthesized in the presence of the surfactant SDBS by a hydrothermal method, and characterized by a variety of techniques.

Modifications of PWO technology were made to improve the uniformity of the crystal properties. A model of the scintillation mechanism for PWO was developed and served to guide the improvement. The complex spectroscopic analysis of the crystal after improvement is presented, as well as the new crystal properties achieved.

C, and the morphology of the nanocrystals can be controlled by adjusting such reaction conditions as the calcined time and the weight ratio of the salt to the CdWO 4 precursor. The resultant sample is a pure phase of CdWO 4 without any other impurities\n\nScintillators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCusano, D.A.; Holub, F.F.; Prochazka, S.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nScintillator bodies comprising phosphor materials and having high optical translucency with low light absorption, and methods of making the scintillator bodies, are described. Fabrication methods include (a) a hot-pressing process, (b) cold-pressing followed by sintering, (c) controlled cooling from a melt, and (d) hot-forging. The scintillator bodies that result are easily machined to desired shapes and sizes. Suitable phosphors include BaFCl:Eu, LaOBr:Tb, CsI:Tl, CaWO 4 and CdWO 4 .

The CdWO_4 powder was synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method in the laboratory. X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy proved that the CdWO_4 powder was successfully prepared. Moreover, photoluminescence analysis showed that adding polymer does not change the emission peak of CdWO_4. Also, the responses of all samples were measured using an \"2\"4\"1Am alpha source with 1860 Bq activity. Results showed that the sample having thickness of 177 mg/cm\"2 has the best counting efficiency (over 2Ï geometry) among the others. The efficiency measurement was further evaluated using a \"2\"3\"0Th source whose activity is 190.7 Bq. It revealed that the counting efficiency of this sample for both \"2\"4\"1Am and \"2\"3\"0Th was nearly equal.\n\nScintillation properties of pure and Ca-doped ZnWO4 crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDanevich, F.A.; Shkulkova, O.G.; Henry, S.; Kraus, H.; McGowan, R.; Mikhailik, V.B.; Telfer, J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFollowing the investigations of the structure and scintillation properties of Ca-doped zinc tungstate powder [phys. stat. sol. (a) 204, 730 (2007)] a single-crystal of ZnWO 4 -Ca (0.5 mol%) was grown and characterised. The relative light output, energy resolution and decay characteristics were measured for pure and Ca-doped ZnWO 4 scintillators. An increase in the light yield of â40% compared with the undoped crystal, and an energy resolution 9.6% ( 137 Cs) were obtained for Ca-doped ZnWO 4 . The observed improvement is attributed to the reduction of self-absorption (bleaching) of the crystal. The cause of bleaching as well as the possible contribution of scattering is discussed.

KGaA, Weinheim) (orig.)\n\nLuminescence and scintillation properties of Ce-doped Cs2ZnCl4 crystals\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSugawara, K.; Koshimizu, M.; Yanagida, T.; Fujimoto, Y.; Haruki, R.; Nishikido, F.; Kishimoto, S.; Asai, K.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nIn this study, we have synthesized scintillation materials based on Ce-doped Cs2ZnCl4 crystals. The light yield was enhanced by up to 20% by doping Cs2ZnCl4 with Ce3+ ions. In the scintillation time profiles, fast components exhibited decay time constants on the order of nanoseconds, which was ascribed to Auger-free luminescence (AFL). The light yield of the AFL component decreased at 10 mol% Ce3+ concentration, which is mainly attributed to the reabsorption of AFL photons inside the crystals by Ce3+ ions, as seen in the scintillation spectra. Long components had decay time constants of approximately 30 ns. In addition, at 10 mol% Ce3+ concentration, a prominent band appeared at approximately 500 nm in the scintillation spectrum, which was not observed in the photoluminescence spectra. The long components in the scintillation time profiles and the 500 nm band in the scintillation spectra were tentatively attributed to self-trapped excitons perturbed by Ce3+ ions.\n\nCrystal Growth and Scintillation Properties of Eu2+ doped Cs4CaI6 and Cs4SrI6\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStand, L.; Zhuravleva, M.; Chakoumakos, B.; Johnson, J.; Loyd, M.; Wu, Y.; Koschan, M.; Melcher, C. L.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this work we present the crystal growth and scintillation properties of two new ternarymetal halide scintillators activated with divalent europium, Cs4CaI6 and Cs4SrI6. Single crystals of each compound were grown in evacuated quartz ampoules via the vertical Bridgman technique using a two-zone transparent furnace. Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments showed that both crystals have a trigonal (R-3c) structure, with a density of 3.99 g/cm3 and 4.03 g/cm3. The radioluminescence and photoluminescence measurements showed typical luminescence properties due to the 5d-4f radiative transitions in Eu2+. At this early stage of development Cs4SrI6:Eu and Cs4CaI6:Eu have shown very promising scintillation properties, with light yields and energy resolutions of 62,300 ph/MeV and 3.3%, and 51,800 photons/MeV and 3.6% at 662 keV, respectively.\n\nLaser micromachining of cadmium tungstate scintillator for high energy X-ray imaging\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRichards, Sion Andreas\n\nPulsed laser ablation has been investigated as a method for the creation of thick segmented scintillator arrays for high-energy X-ray radiography. Thick scintillators are needed to improve the X-ray absorption at high energies, while segmentation is required for spatial resolution. Monte-Carlo simulations predicted that reflections at the inter-segment walls were the greatest source of loss of scintillation photons. As a result of this, fine pitched arrays would be inefficient as the number of reflections would be significantly higher than in large pitch arrays. Nanosecond and femtosecond pulsed laser ablation was investigated as a method to segment cadmium tungstate (CdWO_4). The effect of laser parameters on the ablation mechanisms, laser induced material changes and debris produced were investigated using optical and electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for both types of lasers. It was determined that nanosecond ablation was unsuitable due to the large amount of cracking and a heat affected zone created during the ablation process. Femtosecond pulsed laser ablation was found to induce less damage. The optimised laser parameters for a 1028 nm laser was found to be a pulse energy of 54 Î¼J corresponding to a fluence of 5.3 J cm. -2 a pulse duration of 190 fs, a repetition rate of 78.3 kHz and a laser scan speed of 707 mm s. -1 achieving a normalised pulse overlap of 0.8. A serpentine scan pattern was found to minimise damage caused by anisotropic thermal expansion. Femtosecond pulsed ablation was also found to create a layer of tungsten and cadmium sub-oxides on the surface of the crystals. The CdWO_4 could be cleaned by immersing the CdWO_4 in ammonium hydroxide at 45Â°C for 15 minutes. However, XPS indicated that the ammonium hydroxide formed a thin layer of CdCO_3 and Cd(OH)_2 on the surface. Prototype arrays were shown to be able to resolve features as small as 0.5 mm using keV energy X-rays.

This paper discusses the effects of radiation damage in scintillating crystals, and concludes that the predominant radiation damage effect in crystal scintillators is the radiation induced absorption, or color center formation, not the loss of the scintillation light yield. The importance of maintaining crystal's light response uniformity and the feasibility to build a precision crystal calorimeter under radiation are elaborated. The mechanism of the radiation damage in scintillating crystals is also discussed. While the damage in alkali halides is found to be caused by the oxygen or hydroxyl contamination, it is the structure defects, such as oxygen vacancies, cause damage in oxides. Material analysis methods used to reach these conclusions are presented in details.\n\nOptical and scintillating properties of Ce:Li(Y,Lu)F4 single crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYokota, Yuui; Kurosawa, Shunsuke; Chani, Valery; Kamada, Kei; Yoshikawa, Akira\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe have investigated the optical and scintillating properties of Lu co-doped Ce:LiYF 4 single crystals with various Lu content. In the transmittance and absorption spectra, the absorption peaks at 243Â nm get systematically red shifted in contrast to the peaks at 197 and 200Â nm which get blue shifted with the increase in Lu content. At the same time, emission peaks at 306Â nm and 200Â nm under 295Â nm excitation also get red shifted. The decay time of Ce:Li(Y,Lu)F 4 crystals under 295Â nm excitation is found to be faster than that of Ce:LiYF 4 and Ce:LiLuF 4 crystals. The alpha-peak positions in the pulse-height spectra and decay times of crystals under alpha-ray irradiation are found to vary with the Lu content. - Highlights: â¢ Optical and scintillation properties of Ce:Li(Y 1-x Lu x )F 4 crystals were inspected. â¢ Increase of Lu content resulted change of the position of four absorption peaks. â¢ Admixing of Y and Lu decreased the light yield and increased the decay time. â¢ The Ce:LiLuF 4 crystal indicated the largest light yield in the pulse-height spectra. â¢ Li[(Y 0.8 Lu 0.2 ) 0.98 Ce 0.02 ]F 4 indicated larger light yield than Ce:LiYF 4 crystal\n\nNew scintillating media based on liquid crystals for particle detectors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBarnik, M.I.; Yudin, S.G.; Vasil'chenko, V.G.; Golovkin, S.V.; Medvedkov, A.M.; Solovjev, A.S.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe study results of optical, photoluminiscent and scintillation properties of a liquid crystal 4-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl are presented.

The report is a bibliographical study based on papers published mainly these last five years. The main subject is preceded by a general introduction in which the principal characteristics of a scintillator gamma-ray spectrometer are discussed. The properties of some scintillator materials (NaI(T1), CsI(T1), CsI(Na), BGO, GSO(Ce) and CdWO 4 ) are then briefly presented. In this section, a special emphasis has been given to BGO as this material has recently received much attention and is now well documented. Finally, the results obtained by measuring the intensity of the light generated in the crystal with three types of solid-state photodetectors (Si photodiodes, HgI 2 photodetectors and avalanche Si photodiodes) are summarized\n\nPortable scintillation gamma-spectrometer for field measurement of radioactivity in extensive objects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBesshejko, O.A.; Vishnevskij, I.N.; Denisenko, R.V.; Malyuk, I.A.; Petrosyan, Eh.E.; Karpenko, S.A.; Prijmak, V.N.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe portable scintillated gamma-spectrometer for field measurement of radioactivity in the volume objects was designed.

In this case the value of the efficiency needed for specific activity calculation in close approximation depends only from crystal geometry and density of measuring object and may be set as the device parameter without efficiency calibration procedure during the operation.

The scintillation decay kinetics can be expressed as the sum of two exponential decay components. The fast decay component had a decay time constant of 1.8 ns, and its relative intensity was 95%. The total light output was 630 photons/MeV, and a subnanosecond timing resolution of 0.66 ns was obtained. The detection efficiency of 67.4 keV X-rays was 80% for a detector equipped with a 2.2-mm-thick Cs 2 ZnCl 4 crystal. Thus, excellent timing resolution and high detection efficiency were achieved simultaneously.

However, using the already pulled crystals as the starting charge for the subsequent growth, colorless crystals can be grown. The crystals exhibiting excellent transmission characteristics have been grown employing a low temperature gradient, a moderate rotation rate of 15 rpm and a pull speed of 1 mm/h. The colored crystals show some radiation damage on gamma irradiation, while the colorless ones remain unaffected even for irradiation doses as high as 10 Mrad. Both the types of crystals show the presence of weak thermoluminescence (TL) emission when high irradiation doses (similar 10 Mrad) are given. Only one TL glow peak is obtained in both the cases but the peak temperatures are different. The emission centers responsible for the TL emission are found to be the ones which give rise to the scintillation emission in the crystal.

Some of generated lights by interaction between x-ray photons and scintillator are collected at the photo-sensor and others are absorbed in scintillator or escape out of detector. In order to make the high performance image detector, detector should be able to gather the generated lights as much as possible. To minimize the loss of generated lights, thickness of scintillator is to be chosen appropriately. Therefore, the quality of the image detector using the pixelated scintillator is determined by scintillator size, reflectance of scintillator surface, electric noise, etc. In this study, we carried out a study the correlation between the number of collected light and the change of thickness of scintillator using Monte Carlo method. As shown in results, the optimal thickness of a scintillator should be properly selected depending on the incident x-ray energy. In case of without reflector, the scintillator thickness range for x-ray detection is thinner than other cases (with reflector). In the case of a scintillator with reflector, number of collected light and the optima thickness of a scintillator is higher and thicker than scintillator without reflector.\n\nQuality inspection of anisotropic scintillating lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystals through measurement of interferometric fringe pattern parameters\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCocozzella, N.; Lebeau, M.; Majni, G.; Paone, N.; Rinaldi, D.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nScintillating crystals are widely used as detectors in radiographic systems, computerized axial tomography devices and in calorimeters employed in high-energy physics. This paper results from a project motivated by the development of the CMS calorimeter at CERN, which will make use of a large number of scintillating crystals. In order to prevent crystals from breaking because of internal residual stress, a quality control system based on optic inspection of interference fringe patterns was developed.

Currently BGO (Bi{sub 4}Ge{sub 3}O{sub 12}) is widely used for this purpose because of its high stopping power, the non hygroscopy and its ruggedness, which is favorable in space applications. Cerium doped LSO (Lu{sub 2}SiO{sub 5}) offers the same benefits with higher light output capabilites and a shorter decay time. In this work a cerium doped LSO scintillation crystal coupled with a photo diode is investigated. The light yield and resolution studies for two different radioactive sources, {sup 207}Bi and {sup 60}Co, are presented. To increase the light collection and consequently the energy resolution, scintillation crystals are wrapped in highly reflective material. The increase in light collection depending on the amount of layers for the LSO crystal along with investigations of quenching effects with alpha particles and the background spectrum, which arises from radioactive cerium isotopes, are also included in this work.\n\nOptimization of light collection from crystal scintillators for cryogenic experiments\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMokina, V.M.; Danevich, F.A.; Kobychev, V.V.; Kraus, H.; Mikhailik, V.B.; Nagornaya, L.L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCryogenic scintillation bolometers are a promising technique to search for dark matter and neutrinoless double decay.

Observed scintillations occurring in an unirradiated single crystal of this potent oncogen as the temperature is lowered from 300 to 90 K are shown. It was found that these scintillations occur upon heating or cooling and do not diminish in activity as the number of heating and cooling cycles increase. It was found that a short duration u.v. exposure would terminate the scintillation activity and various attempts (such as annealing and pressure changes) to rejuvenate them were unsuccessful. With these observations in mind speculation is made concerning the mechanisms associated with the production of purine N-oxide derivatives.

Consequently, scintillation of CdF{sub 2} is possibly emission at color centers or exciton related one. - Highlights: â¢ CdF{sub 2} crystal scinitillator was synthesized. â¢ Emission wavelengths of CdF{sub 2} appeared around 350 and 420 nm. â¢ Scintillation decay time of CdF{sub 2} was quite fast, 1.75 ns. â¢ Excitation bands were investigated by using Synchrotron facility, UVSOR.\n\nNew scintillating crystals for PET scanners\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLecoq, P\n\n2002-01-01\n\nSystematic R&D on basic mechanism in inorganic scintillators, initiated by the Crystal Clear Collaboration at CERN 10 years ago, has contributed not to a small amount, to the development of new materials for a new generation of medical imaging devices with increased resolution and sensitivity. The first important requirement for a scintillator to be used in medical imaging devices is the stopping power for the given energy range of X and gamma rays to be considered, and more precisely the conversion efficiency. A high light yield is also mandatory to improve the energy resolution, which is essentially limited by the photostatistics and the electronic noise at these energies. A short scintillation decay time allows to reduce the dead time and therefore to increase the limiting counting rate. When all these requirements are fulfilled the sensitivity and image contrast are increased for a given patient dose, or the dose can be reduced.

In these crystals, a plane cleavage was observed along the growth direction. The crystals had an 80% transparency, and no absorption bands were detected in the 190-900 nm wavelength range. The 241Am 5.5 MeV Î±-ray-excited radioluminescence spectrum of CaB2O4 demonstrated a broad intrinsic luminescence peak at 300-400 nm, which originated from the lattice defects or an exciton-based emission. According to the pulse height spectrum, when irradiated by neutrons from a 252Cf source, the scintillation light yielded approximately 3200 photons per neutron (ph/n).\n\nOptimization of the scintillation parameters of the lead tungstate crystals for their application in high precision electromagnetic calorimetry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDrobychev, G.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIn the frame of this dissertation work scintillation properties of the lead tungstate crystals PWO) and possibilities of their use were studied foreseeing their application for electromagnetic calorimetry in extreme radiation environment conditions of new colliders.

The luminescence in SrMoO{sub 4} is quenched at room temperature, but below T<200 K the crystal exhibits a broad emission band with a maximum at a wavelength of 520 nm. The emission is attributed to the radiative decay of self-trapped excitons and defects acting as traps for the exactions at low temperatures. Such complex character of radiative decay is reflected in the kinetics which contains several components plus a contribution from delayed recombination at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of scintillation light output of SrMoO{sub 4} was studied. Comparing with a reference ZnWO{sub 4} crystal measured under the same experimental conditions it was found that the light output of SrMoO{sub 4} is 15Â±5%. It is suggested, therefore, that there is scope for optimisation of strontium molybdate for application as scintillator in cryogenic rare event searches.\n\nOptical and scintillation properties of bulk ZnO crystal\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYanagida, Takayuki [Kyushu Institute of Technology, 2-4 Hibikino, Wakamatsu, Kitakyushu 808-0196 (Japan); Fujimoto, Yutaka; Kurosawa, Shunsuke [Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577 (Japan); Yamanoi, Kohei; Sarukura, Nobuhiko [Institute of Laser Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871 (Japan); Kano, Masataka; Wakamiya, Akira [Daishinku Corporation, 1389 Shinzaike, Hiraoka-cho, Kakogawa, Hyogo 675-0194 (Japan)\n\n2012-12-15\n\nSingle crystal bulk ZnO scintillator grown by the hydrothermal method was tested on its scintillation performances.

One of the main goals of the CLYMENE is a realization of a Li2MoO4 crystal growth line to be complementary to the one recently developed by LUMINEU in view of a mass production capacity for CUPID, a next-generation tonne-scale bolometric experiment to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. In the present paper we report the investigation of performance and radiopurity of 158-g and 13.5-g scintillating bolometers based on a first large-mass (230 g) Li2MoO4 crystal scintillator developed within the CLYMENE project. In particular, a good energy resolution (2-7 keV FWHM in the energy range of 0.2-5 MeV), one of the highest light yield (0.97 keV/MeV) amongst Li2MoO4 scintillating bolometers, an efficient alpha particles discrimination (10 Ï) and potentially low internal radioactive contamination (below 0.2-0.3 mBq/kg of U/Th, but 1.4 mBq/kg of 210Po) demonstrate prospects of the CLYMENE in the development of high quality and radiopure Li2MoO4 scintillators for CUPID.\n\nLiCaAlF sub 6 :Ce crystal: a new scintillator\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGektin, A V; Neicheva, S; Gavrilyuk, V; Bensalah, A; Fukuda, T; Shimamura, K\n\n2002-01-01\n\nScintillation properties of LiCaAlF sub 6 :Ce crystal, well known as the effective UV laser material, is reported. Ce sup 3 sup + emission at 286-305 nm with a single exponential decay time of 35 ns provides a scintillation pulse. Radiation damage in pure and Ce-doped crystals is studied. In contrast to the majority of fluoride crystals, cerium is responsible for the ultradeep traps formation revealing thermostimulated luminescence. Overlapping of color center absorption and Ce sup 3 sup + ion emission bands limits the scintillation efficiency of LiCaAlF sub 6 :Ce at high radiation doses.\n\nScintillation characteristics of Tm3+ in Ca3(BO3)2 crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFujimoto, Yutaka; Yanagida, Takayuki; Yokota, Yuui; Kawaguchi, Noriaki; Fukuda, Kentaro; Totsuka, Daisuke; Watanabe, Kenichi; Yamazaki, Atsushi; Yoshikawa, Akira\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBasic optical properties and radiation responses of undoped, Tm 3+ 1.0% and 2.0% activated Ca 3 (BO 3 ) 2 (CBO) crystalline scintillator prepared by the micro-pulling down (Î¼-PD) method are reported.

The vertical Bridgman growth technique is still considered as very popular method that enables production of relatively large and commercially attractive crystals. On the other hand, the micro-pulling-down method is preferable when fabrication of small samples, sufficient for preliminary characterization of their optical and/or scintillation performance, is required. Moreover, bulk crystal growth is also available using the micro-pulling-down furnace. The examples of growths of various halide crystals by industrially friendly melt growth techniques including Czochralski and edge-defined film-fed growth methods are also discussed. Finally, traveling molten zone growth that in some degree corresponds to horizontal zone melting is briefly overviewed.\n\nResponse of CsI:Pb Scintillator Crystal to Neutron Radiation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCosta Pereira, Maria da ConceiÃ§Ã£o; Filho, Tufic Madi; Berretta, JosÃ© Roberto; NÃ¡huel CÃ¡rdenas, JosÃ© PatrÃ­cio; Iglesias Rodrigues, Antonio Carlos\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe helium-3 world crisis requires a development of new methods of neutron detection to replace commonly used 3He proportional counters. In the past decades, great effort was made to developed efficient and fast scintillators to detect radiation. The inorganic scintillator may be an alternative. Inorganic scintillators with much higher density should be selected for optimal neutron detection efficiency taking into consideration the relevant reactions leading to light emission. These detectors should, then, be carefully characterized both experimentally and by means of advanced simulation code. Ideally, the detector should have the capability to separate neutron and gamma induced events either by amplitude or through pulse shape differences. As neutron sources also generate gamma radiation, which can interfere with the measurement, it is necessary that the detector be able to discriminate the presence of such radiation. Considerable progress has been achieved to develop new inorganic scintillators, in particular increasing the light output and decreasing the decay time by optimized doping. Crystals may be found to suit neutron detection. In this report, we will present the results of the study of lead doped cesium iodide crystals (CsI:Pb) grown in our laboratory, using the vertical Bridgman technique. The concentration of the lead doping element (Pb) was studied in the range 5x10-4 M to 10-2 M . The crystals grown were subjected to annealing (heat treatment). In this procedure, vacuum of 10-6 mbar and continuous temperature of 350Â°C, for 24 hours, were employed. In response to neutron radiation, an AmBe source with energy range of 1 MeV to 12 MeV was used. The activity of the AmBe source was 1Ci Am. The fluency was 2.6 x 106 neutrons/second. The operating voltage of the photomultiplier tube was 1700 V; the accumulation time in the counting process was 600 s and 1800 s. The scintillator crystals used were cut with dimensions of 20 mm diameter and 10 mm height.\n\nScintillation quenching in BGO crystal of the Solar Orbiter HET\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGrunau, J.; Kulkarni, Shrinivasrao; Martin, C.; Boettcher, Stephan; Seimetz, L.; Schuster, B.; Kulemzin, A.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, Robert F. [IEAP, Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet zu Kiel (Germany)\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThe High-Energy Telescope (HET) on ESA's Solar Orbiter mission will measure electrons from 300 keV up to about 30 MeV, protons from 10 to 100 MeV and heavy ions from approximately 20 to 200 MeV/nuc. These measurement capabilities are reached by a combination of solid-state tracking detectors and a scintillator calorimeter. This setup can perform particle identification via the dE/dx vs total E technique. The scintillator approach provides a good resolution over the complete energy range but the total energy deposition has to be corrected for the scintillation quenching. The quenching lowers light output depending on the type and energy of the incident particle. We measured the crystal response for different heavy ions and energies and compared them to simulated values. Simulations were carried out using the GEANT4 toolkit provided by CERN. From comparison of simulated and measured data we were able to calculate quenching factors for the BGO crystals for ions up to iron. The results are of great interest for later data analysis with the HET telescope.\n\nTesting the radiation hardness of lead tungstate scintillating crystals\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nShao, M; Li Chuan; Chen, H; Xu, Z Z; Wang, Z M\n\n2000-01-01\n\nLarge Hadron Collider operation will produce a high radiation background.

In the photoluminescence spectra, two emission bands are observed at 383 and 434 nm. The 434 nm emission band for Rb 2 HfCl 6 may be attributed to [HfCl 6 ] 2- complex ion or [ZrCl 6 ] 2- impurity, since the Rb 2 HfCl 6 contained Zr as impurity at 0.62 mol %. The radioluminescence band is observed at 420 nm and can be attributed to the same origin as the photoluminescence band at 434 nm. The scintillation decay-time constants were 0.84 and 5.4 Î¼s.

Therefore, they are suitable to be used for high-energy nuclear data measurements under high-background circumstances. Although a good electron-ion separation with a pulse shape analysis technique is essential, scintillation pulse shapes have not been observed with electron beams of a wide energy range. A single-electron beam technique has been developed at Kyoto University Free Electron Laser (KUFEL), and electron beams of 4-38â MeV are available. During the experiments, single electron beams bombarded a PWO crystal. By using oscilloscope we observed scintillation pulses of a PWO crystal coupled with a photomultiplier tube. Measured spectra were compared with the simulation code of EGS5 to analyze scattering effects. As the result, the pulse amplitudes show good linearity and the pulse shapes are almost constant in the observed energy range.\n\nLuminescence and scintillation properties of YAG:Ce single crystal and optical ceramics\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMihÃ³kovÃ¡, E; MareÅ¡, J A; BeitlerovÃ¡, A; Vedda, A; Nejezchleb, K; BlaÅ¾ek, K; DâAmbrosio, C\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe use various techniques to study optical and scintillation properties of Ce-doped yttrium aluminum garnet, Y3Al5O12 (YAG:Ce), in the form of a high-quality industrial single crystal. This was compared to optical ceramics prepared from YAG:Ce nanopowders. We present experimental data in the areas of optical absorption, radioluminescence, scintillation decay, photoelectron yield, thermally stimulated luminescence and radiation-induced absorption. The results point to an interesting featureâthe absence of antisite (YAl, i.e. Y at the Al site) defects in optical ceramics. The scintillation decay of the ceramics is faster than that of the single crystal, but its photoelectron yield (measured with 1 Î¼s integration time) is about 30â40% lower. Apart from the photoelectron yield value the YAG:Ce optical ceramic is fully comparable to a high quality industrial YAG:Ce single crystal and can become a competitive scintillator material.\n\nPerformance study of Philips digital silicon photomultiplier coupled to scintillating crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLiu, Z.; Pizzichemi, M.; Paganoni, M.; Auffray, E.; Lecoq, P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSilicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and scintillators are often arranged in the shape of arrays in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) systems. Digital SiPMs provide signal readout in single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) level. From the photon count rate measurement of each SPAD cell of digital SiPM, we found that the output scintillating photons distribute in an area larger than the scintillator physical coupling area. Taking advantage of the possibility to enable/disable individual cells of the digital SiPM, a group of Lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals with different dimensions coupled to a digital SiPM was used to study the influence of using different SiPM active area on the number of photons detected, energy resolution and coincidence time resolution (CTR). For the same crystal coupled to the digital SiPM, the larger the active area of digital SiPM, the higher the number of photons detected. The larger active area of the digital SiPM also results in a better energy resolution after saturation correction. The best energy resolution full width half maximum (FWHM) obtained for the 2Ã2Ã5mm 3 , 2Ã2Ã10 mm 3 , 2Ã2Ã15mm 3 , 2Ã2Ã20mm 3 LYSO crystals was 10.7%, 11.6%, 12.1%, 12.5%, respectively. For crystals with different cross sections coupled to the digital SiPM, we found that the larger the cross section of coupling area, the more photons were detected and thus a better energy resolution was obtained. The CTR of crystals fully wrapped with Teflon or without wrapping was measured by positioning two identical crystals facing each other. A larger area of digital SiPM improves the CTR and the CTR reaches the plateau when the active area is larger than 2.2Ã2.2mm 2 with both two configurations of wrapping. The best CTR value for the 2Ã2Ã5mm 3 , 2Ã2Ã10mm 3 , 2Ã2Ã15mm 3 , 2Ã2Ã20mm 3 LYSO crystals was 128.9 ps, 148.4 ps, 171.6 ps, 177.9 ps, respectively.

Such materials are used in a diverse range of applications; From high energy particle physics experiments, X-ray security, to nuclear cameras or positron emission tomography. Future high-energy physics (HEP) experiments as well as next generation medical imaging applications are more and more pushing towards better scintillation characteristics. One of the problems in heavy scintillating materials is related to their high index of refraction. As a consequence, most of the scintillation light produced in the bulk material is trapped inside the crystal due to total internal reflection. The same problem also occurs with light emitting diodes (LEDs) and has for a long time been considered as a limiting factor for their overall efficiency. Recent developments in the area of nanophotonics were showing now that those limitations can be overcome by introducing a photonic crystal (PhC) slab at the outcoupling surface of the substrate.

A rough measurement of the emission wavelength of CsI(Tl) is also reported.\n\nOptimization of the scintillation parameters of the lead tungstate crystals for their application in high precision electromagnetic calorimetry; Optimisation des parametres de scintillation des cristaux de tungstate de plomb pour leur application dans la calorimetrie electromagnetique de haute precision\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDrobychev, G\n\n2000-04-12\n\nIn the frame of this dissertation work scintillation properties of the lead tungstate crystals (PWO) and possibilities of their use were studied foreseeing their application for electromagnetic calorimetry in extreme radiation environment conditions of new colliders. The results of this work can be summarized in the following way. 1. A model of the scintillations origin in the lead tungstate crystals which includes processes influencing on the crystals radiation hardness and presence of slow components in scintillations was developed. 2. An analysis of the influences of the PWO scintillation properties changes on the parameters of the electromagnetic calorimeter was done. 3. Methods of the light collection from the large scintillation elements of complex shape made of the birefringent scintillation crystal with high refraction index and low light yield in case of signal registration by a photodetector with sensitive surface small in compare with the output face of scintillator were Studied. 4. Physical principles of the methodology of the scintillation crystals certification during their mass production foreseeing their installation into a calorimeter electromagnetic were developed. Correlations between the results of measurements of the PWO crystals parameters by different methods were found.

Such a radiation dosimeter model was developed by attaching a small piece of CWO (CdWO 4 ) scintillator to a low attenuation plastic optical fiber. CWO was chosen since the higher atomic numbers of Cd and W would render the size of the scintillator smaller. The size of the scintillator was 4.7x4.7x10 mm 3 . The scintillator was optically glued to the plastic optical fiber of 3 mm diameter and 10 m length. A current-type PMT was optically coupled to the other end of the fiber to convert the lights generated in the scintillator into current signals. The dosimeter model was tested with two 60 Co standard sources of 0.5 mCi and 1 mCi to measure the PMT current as a function of the source-to-detector distance. It was then tested in a 60 Co irradiation chamber with an activity of about 6600 Ci. MCNPX simulations were performed for the source and detector arrangements to calculate the deposited energy in the CWO scintillator. The profiles of the measured current change are compared with those of the calculated energy deposition change. While there is some deviation between the measured and calculated profiles obtained with the lower-activity standard sources, the measured profile accurately coincides with the calculated one obtained in the higher-activity irradiation chamber. This study suggests that the fiber-optic scintillation dosimeter, operated in current mode, can be used to remotely measure radiation doses in high-intensity gamma fields\n\nGrowth and scintillation properties of BaMgF4\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYanagida, Takayuki; Kawaguchi, Noriaki; Fujimoto, Yutaka; Sugiyama, Makoto; Furuya, Yuki; Kamada, Kei; Yokota, Yuui; Yoshikawa, Akira; Chani, Valery\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBy using the micro-pulling down (Î¼-PD) method, the barium magnesium fluoride (BaMgF 4 ) single crystalline scintillator was produced. The crystal was cut and mirror polished to the physical dimensions of 1x2x10 mm 3 for examination of scintillation properties. BaMgF 4 demonstrated â¼70% transmittance in wavelength range above 170 nm, and strong emission peaking around 205 nm was observed under X-ray excitation. The absolute light yield of BaMgF 4 was 1300Â±100 ph/MeV, and the decay time profile showed two components as 0.57Â±0.01 (70%) and 2.2Â±0.31 (30%) ns at room temperature.\n\nCrystal growth and characterization of calcium metaborate scintillators\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nFujimoto, Y.; Yanagida, T.; Kawaguchi, N.; Fukuda, K.; Totsuka, D.; Watanabe, K.; Yamazaki, A.; Chani, V.; Nikl, Martin; Yoshikawa, A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 703, MAR (2013), s. 7-10 ISSN 0168-9002 Institutional support: RVO:68378271 Keywords : Czochralski method * single crystal * scintillator * calcium metaborate * luminescence Subject RIV: BM - Solid Matter Physics ; Magnetism Impact factor: 1.316, year: 2013\n\nFurther understanding of PbWO4 Scintillator characteristics and their optimisation. LUMEN activity in 1998\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBaccaro, Stefania; Borgia, Bruno; Cecilia, Angelica; Dafinei, Ioan; Diemoz, Marcella; Fabeni, P; Festinesi, Armando; Longo, Egidio; Martini, M; Meinardi, F; MihokovÃ¡, E; Montecchi, Marco; Nikl, M; Pazzi, G P; Rosa, J; Sulc, Miroslav\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe aim of LUMEN collaboration was the investigation on single crystals of PbWO4 ( PWO): the results performed up to now provide the evidence of the possibility to optimise the optical properties of an intrinsic scintillator such as PWO. The control of essential requirements in the crystal preparation ( raw material purity, growing methods and post-growth annealing) as well as the introduction of selected dopants at suitable concentrations ( particularly trivalent and pentavalent ions) were found to be very successful in lowering the concentration of point defects in the lattice which strongly affect scintillation properties and radiation hardness. The systematic investigation effort to better understand the scintillation characteristics and to improve the quality of PWO crystals is due to their use for the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter.\n\nCrystal growth and scintillation properties of Ce-doped sodium calcium lutetium complex fluoride\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nWakahara, S.; Furuya, Y.; Yanagida, T.; Yokota, Y.; Pejchal, Jan; Sugiyama, M.; Kawaguchi, N.; Totsuka, D.; Yoshikawa, A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 34, Ä. 4 (2012), s. 729-732 ISSN 0925-3467 Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z10100521 Keywords : scintillator * micro-pulling-down method * single crystal * gamma-ray stopping power Subject RIV: BM - Solid Matter Physics ; Magnetism Impact factor: 1.918, year: 2012\n\nDual-readout calorimetry with scintillating crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPinci, D\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe dual-readout approach, which allows an event-by-event measurement of the electromagnetic shower fraction, was originally demonstrated with the DREAM sampling calorimeter. This approach can be extended to homogeneous detectors like crystals if Cherenkov and scintillation light can be separated. In this paper we present several methods we developed for distinguishing the two components in PWO and BGO based calorimeters and the results obtained.\n\nA new hybrid photomultiplier tube as detector for scintillating crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDe Notaristefani, F.; Vittori, F.; Puertolas, D.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIn this work, we have attentively studied the performance of a new hybrid photomultiplier tube (HPMT) as detector for photons from scintillating crystals. The HPMT is equipped with a YAP window in order to improve light collection and increase measured light response from scintillating crystals. Several measurements have been performed on BGO, LSO, CsI(Tl) and NaI(Tl) planar crystals having three different surface treatments as well as on YAP : Ce and CsI(Tl) matrices. Such crystals have been coupled to two HPMTs, one equipped with a YAP window (Y-HPMT) and the other with a conventional quartz window (Q-HPMT). Measurements on crystals coupled to the Y-HPMT have shown a consistent improvement of the light response, thanks to the presence of the YAP window. Indeed, the light response measured with the Y-HPMT was on average equal to 1.5, 2.1 and 2.6 times that obtained with the Q-HPMT for planar crystals with white painted (diffusive), fine ground and polished rear surfaces, respectively. With regards to crystal matrices, we measured a light response increase of about 1.2 times\n\nDetector construction for a scintillation camera\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAshe, J.B.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nAn improved transducer construction for a scintillation camera in which a light conducting element is equipped with a layer of moisture impervious material is described. A scintillation crystal is thereafter positioned in optical communication with the moisture impervious layer and the remaining surfaces of the scintillation crystal are encompassed by a moisture shield. Affixing the moisture impervious layer to the light conducting element prior to attachment of the scintillation crystal reduces the requirement for mechanical strength in the moisture impervious layer and thereby allows a layer of reduced thickness to be utilized. Preferably, photodetectors are also positioned in optical communication with the light conducting element prior to positioning the scintillation crystal in contact with the impervious layer. 13 claims, 4 figures\n\nScintillation characteristics of nonstoichiometric phases formed in MF sub 2 -GdF sub 3 -CeF sub 3 systems Part III.

As the Ce concentration increased, the Ce sup 3 sup + emission at 345 nm increased to a level comparable with the Gd sup 3 sup + emission at 310 nm. Both emissions, however, were slow with the decay constant in the order of ms. The radiation hardness, which was roughly 10 sup 4 rad, tends to degrade as the wavelength decreases and/or the Ce concentration increases. Both spontaneous recovery and UV annealing of the radiation damages were significant. The intensity of the gamma-ray excited luminescence, integrated over time, was as large as 50% of that in BaF sub 2 (12% of that in CdWO sub 4). When the Ce concentration is nil or only small, the yellow-green luminescence for UV excitation was as intense as in CdWO...\n\nGrowth and scintillation properties of BaMgF{sub 4}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYanagida, Takayuki, E-mail: t_yanagi@tagen.tohoku.ac.j [Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577 (Japan); Kawaguchi, Noriaki [Tokuyama Corporation, Shibuya 3-chome, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-8383 (Japan); Fujimoto, Yutaka; Sugiyama, Makoto; Furuya, Yuki; Kamada, Kei; Yokota, Yuui [Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577 (Japan); Yoshikawa, Akira [Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577 (Japan); New Industry Creation Hatchery Center (NICHe), Tohoku University, 6-6-10 Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8579 (Japan); Chani, Valery [Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8577 (Japan)\n\n2010-09-21\n\nBy using the micro-pulling down ({mu}-PD) method, th"
