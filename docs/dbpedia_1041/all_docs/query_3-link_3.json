The fundamental physics understood today is explained, and common scintillators and scintillation detectors are introduced. The properties explained here are light yield, energy non-proportionality, emission wavelength, energy resolution, decay time, effective atomic number and timing resolution. For further understanding, the emission mechanisms of scintillator materials are also introduced. Furthermore, unresolved problems in scintillation phenomenon are considered, and my recent interpretations are discussed. These topics include positive hysteresis, the co-doping of non-luminescent ions, the introduction of an aimed impurity phase, the excitation density effect and the complementary relationship between scintillators and storage phosphors.

Proton imaging, which includes proton radiography and proton computed tomography (pCT), is a useful verification tool. We have developed a pCT detection system that uses a thick bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) scintillator and a CCD camera. The current method is based on a previous detection system that used a plastic scintillator, and implements improved image processing techniques. In the new system, the scintillation light intensity is integrated along the proton beam path by the BGO scintillator, and acquired as a two-dimensional distribution with the CCD camera. The range of a penetrating proton is derived from the integrated light intensity using a light-to-range conversion table, and a pCT image can be reconstructed. The proton range in the BGO scintillator is shorter than in the plastic scintillator, so errors due to extended proton ranges can be reduced. To demonstrate the feasibility of the pCT system, an experiment was performed using a 70 MeV proton beam created by the AVF930 cyclotron at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. The accuracy of the light-to-range conversion table, which is susceptible to errors due to its spatial dependence, was investigated, and the errors in the acquired pixel values were less than 0.5âmm. Images of various materials were acquired, and the pixel-value errors were within 3.1%, which represents an improvement over previous results. We also obtained a pCT image of an edible chicken piece, the first of its kind for a biological material, and internal structures approximately one millimeter in size were clearly observed. This pCT imaging system is fast and simple, and based on these findings, we anticipate that we can acquire 200 MeV pCT images using the BGO scintillator system.\n\nImproved proton CT imaging using a bismuth germanium oxide scintillator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTanaka, Sodai; Nishio, Teiji; Tsuneda, Masato; Matsushita, Keiichiro; Kabuki, Shigeto; Uesaka, Mitsuru\n\n2018-02-01\n\nRange uncertainty is among the most formidable challenges associated with the treatment planning of proton therapy.

Using the two step method, the polymer pellets are mixed with silicone oil, and the mixture is then tumble mixed with the dopants necessary to yield the proper response from the scintillator material. The mixture is then placed in a compounder and compounded in an inert gas atmosphere. The resultant scintillator material is then extruded and pelletized or formed. When only a single step is employed, the polymer pellets and dopants are metered into an inline-coloring extruding system. The mixture is then processed under a inert gas atmosphere, usually argon or nitrogen, to form plastic scintillator material in the form of either scintillator pellets, for subsequent processing, or as material in the direct formation of the final scintillator shape or form.\n\nScintillation properties of selected oxide monocrystals activated with Ce and Pr\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWojtowicz, Andrzej J.; Drozdowski, Winicjusz; Wisniewski, Dariusz; Lefaucheur, Jean-Luc; Galazka, Zbigniew; Gou, Zhenhui; Lukasiewicz, Tadeusz; Kisielewski, Jaroslaw\n\n2006-01-01\n\nIn the last 10-15 years there has been a significant effort toward development of new, more efficient and faster materials for detection of ionizing radiation. A growing demand for better scintillator crystals for detection of 511 keV gamma particles has been due mostly to recent advances in modern imaging systems employing positron emitting radionuclides for medical diagnostics in neurology, oncology and cardiology. While older imaging systems were almost exclusively based on BGO and NaI:Tl crystals the new systems, e.g., ECAT Accel, developed by Siemens/CTI, are based on recently discovered and developed LSO (Lu 2SiO 5:Ce, Ce-activated lutetium oxyorthosilicate) crystals. Interestingly, despite very good properties of LSO, there still is a strong drive toward development of new scintillator crystals that would show even better performance and characteristics. In this presentation we shall review spectroscopic and scintillator characterization of new complex oxide crystals, namely LSO, LYSO, YAG, LuAP (LuAlO 3, lutetium aluminate perovskite) and LuYAP activated with Ce and Pr. The LSO:Ce crystals have been grown by CTI Inc (USA), LYSO:Ce, LuAP:Ce and LuYAP:Ce crystals have been grown by Photonic Materials Ltd., Scotland (PML is the only company providing large LuAP:Ce crystals on a commercial scale), while YAG:Pr and LuAP:Pr crystals have been grown by Institute of Electronic Materials Technology (Poland). All these crystals have been characterized at Institute of Physics, N. Copernicus University (Poland). We will review and compare results of measurements of radioluminescence, VUV spectroscopy, scintillation light yields, scintillation time profiles and low temperature thermoluminescence performed on these crystals. We will demonstrate that all experiments clearly indicate that there is a significant room for improvement of LuAP, LuYAP and YAG. While both Ce-activated LSO and LYSO perform very well, we also note that LuYAP:Ce, LuAP:Ce and YAG:Pr offer some\n\nWater-equivalent fiber radiation dosimeter with two scintillating materials\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQin, Zhuang; Hu, Yaosheng; Ma, Yu; Lin, Wei; Luo, Xianping; Zhao, Wenhui; Sun, Weimin; Zhang, Daxin; Chen, Ziyin; Wang, Boran; Lewis, Elfed\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAn inorganic scintillating material plastic optical fiber (POF) dosimeter for measuring ionizing radiation during radiotherapy applications is reported. It is necessary that an ideal dosimeter exhibits many desirable qualities, including water equivalence, energy independence, reproducibility, dose linearity. There has been much recent research concerning inorganic dosimeters. However, little reference has been made to date of the depth-dose characteristics of dosimeter materials. In the case of inorganic scintillating materials, they are predominantly non water-equivalent, with their effective atomic weight (Zeff) being typically much greater than that of water. This has been a barrier in preventing inorganic scintillating material dosimeter from being used in actual clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a parallel-paired fiber light guide structure to solve this problem. Two different inorganic scintillating materials are embedded separately in the parallel-paired fiber. It is shown that the information of water depth and absorbed dose at the point of measurement can be extracted by utilizing their different depth-dose properties.

The ideal scintillator for gamma ray detection must have exceptional performance in terms of stopping power, luminosity, proportionality, speed, and cost. Recently, trivalent lanthanide dopants such as Ce and Eu have received greater attention for fast and bright scintillators as the optical 5d to 4f transition is relatively fast. However, crystal growth and production costs remain challenging for these new materials so there is still a need for new higher performing scintillators that meet the needs of the different application areas. First principles calculations can provide a useful insight into the chemical and electronic properties of such materials and hence can aid in the search for better new scintillators. In the past there has been little first-principles work done on scintillator materials in part because it means modeling f electrons in lanthanides as well as complex excited state and scattering processes. In this talk I will give an overview of the scintillation process and show how first-principles calculations can be applied to such systems to gain a better understanding of the physics involved. I will also present work on a high-throughput first principles approach to select new scintillator materials for fabrication as well as present more detailed calculations to study trapping process etc. that can limit their brightness. This work in collaboration with experimental groups has lead to the discovery of some new bright scintillators.

First-principles based approaches can provide vital information about the structural, electrical, optical and defect properties that will help develop new materials. In addition to the predictive power of modern density functional methods, these techniques can be used to establish trends in properties that may lead to identifying new materials with optimum properties. We will discuss the properties of materials that are of current interest both in the field of scintillators and room temperature semiconductor detectors. In case of semiconductors, binary compounds such as TlBr, InI, CdTe and recently developed ternary chalcohalide Tl6SeI4 will be discussed. Tl6SeI4 mixes a halide (TlI) with a chalcogenide (Tl2Se), which results in an intermediate band gap (1.86 eV) between that of TlI (2.75 eV) and Tl2Se (0.6 eV). For scintillators, we will discuss the case of the elpasolite compounds whose rich chemical compositions should enable the fine-tuning of the band gap and band edges to achieve high light yield and fast scintillation response.\n\nCharacterizing and simulation the scintillation properties of zinc oxide nanowires in AAO membrane for medical imaging applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEsfandi, F.; Saramad, S.; Rezaei Shahmirzadi, M.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIn this work, a new method is proposed for extracting some X-ray detection properties of ZnO nanowires electrodeposited on Anodized Aluminum Oxide (AAO) nanoporous template. The results show that the detection efficiency for 12Î¼m thickness of zinc oxide nano scintillator at an energy of 9.8 keV, near the K-edge of ZnO (9.65 keV), is 24%. The X-rays that interact with AAO can also generate electrons that reach the nano scintillator. The scintillation events of these electrons are seen as a low energy tail in the spectrum. In addition, it is found that all the X-rays that are absorbed in 300 nm thickness of the gold layer on the top of the zinc oxide nanowires can participate in the scintillation process with an efficiency of 6%. Hence, the scintillation detection efficiency of the whole detector for 9.8 keV X-ray energy is 30%. The simulation results from Geant4 and the experimental detected photons per MeV energy deposition are also used to extract the light yield of the zinc oxide nano scintillator. The results show that the light yield of the zinc oxide nanowires deposited by the electrochemical method is approximately the same as for single crystal zinc oxide scintillator (9000). Much better spatial resolution of this nano scintillator in comparison to the bulk ones is an advantage which candidates this nano scintillator for medical imaging applications.\n\nOn the Relationship Between Scintillation Anisotropy and Crystal Structure in Pure Crystalline Organic Scintillator Materials\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchuster, Patricia; Feng, Patrick; Brubaker, Erik\n\nWe report the scintillation anisotropy effect for proton recoil events has been investigated in five pure organic crystalline materials: anthracene, trans-stilbene, p-terphenyl, bibenzyl, and diphenylacetylene. These measurements include characterization of the scintillation response for one hemisphere of proton recoil directions in each crystal. In addition to standard measurements of the total light output and pulse shape at each angle, the prompt and delayed light anisotropies are analyzed, allowing for investigation of the singlet and triplet molecular excitation behaviors independently. This work provides new quantitative and qualitative observations that make progress toward understanding the physical mechanisms behind the scintillation anisotropy. ThesemoreÂ Â» measurements show that the relationship between the prompt and delayed light anisotropies is correlated with crystal structure, as it changes between the pi-stacked crystal structure materials (anthracene and p-terphenyl) and the herringbone crystal structure materials (stilbene, bibenzyl, and diphenylacetylene). The observations are consistent with a model in which there are preferred directions of kinetic processes for the molecular excitations. Finally, these processes and the impact of their directional dependencies on the scintillation anisotropy are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nOn the Relationship Between Scintillation Anisotropy and Crystal Structure in Pure Crystalline Organic Scintillator Materials\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSchuster, Patricia; Feng, Patrick; Brubaker, Erik\n\n2018-05-03\n\nWe report the scintillation anisotropy effect for proton recoil events has been investigated in five pure organic crystalline materials: anthracene, trans-stilbene, p-terphenyl, bibenzyl, and diphenylacetylene.

Layers of the composite material are alternated with layers of transparent plastic scintillator material serving as light guides. The resulting detection medium - designated as ZEBRA - serves as both an active neutron converter and a detection scintillator which is designed to detect both neutrons and gamma-quanta. The composite layers of the ZEBRA detector consist of small heavy-oxide scintillators in the form of granules of crystalline BGO, GSO, ZWO, PWO and other materials. We have produced and tested the ZEBRA detector of sizes 100x100x41 mm and greater, and determined that they have very high efficiency of fast neutron detection (up to 49% or greater), comparable to that which can be achieved by large sized heavy-oxide single crystals of about Ã40x80 cm3 volume. We have also studied the sensitivity variation to fast neutron detection by using different types of multilayer ZEBRA detectors of 100 cm2 surface area and 41 mm thickness (with a detector weight of about 1 kg) and found it to be comparable to the sensitivity of a 3He-detector representing a total cross-section of about 2000 cm2 (with a weight of detector, including its plastic moderator, of about 120 kg). The measured count rate in response to a fast neutron source of 252Cf at 2 m for the ZEBRA-GSO detector of size 100x100x41 mm3 was 2.84 cps/ng, and this count rate can be doubled by increasing the detector height (and area) up to 200x100 mm2. In summary, the ZEBRA detectors represent a new type of high efficiency and low cost solid-state neutron detector that can be used for stationary neutron/gamma portals. They may represent an interesting alternative to expensive, bulky gas counters based on 3He or 10B neutron\n\nPreparation of New Scintillation Imaging Material Composed of Scintillator-Silica Fine Powders and its Imaging of Tritium.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyoshi, Hirokazu; Hiroura, Mitsunori; Tsujimoto, Kazunori; Irikura, Namiko; Otani, Tamaki; Shinohara, Yasuo\n\n2017-05-01\n\nA new scintillation imaging material [scintillator-silica fine powder (FP)] was prepared using silica FPs and scintillator-encapsulating silica nanoparticles (NPs) (scintillator-silica NPs). The wt% values of scintillator-silica NPs on the scintillator-silica FPs were 38, 43, 36 and 44%. Scintillation images of 3H, 63Ni, 35S, 33P, 204Tl, 89Sr and 32P dropped on the scintillator-silica FPs were obtained at about 37 kBq per 0.1-10 Âµl with a charge-coupled device (CCD) imager for a 5 min exposure. In particular, high-intensity CCD images of 35S were selectively obtained using the 2.25, 4.77 and 10 Âµm silica FPs with scintillator-silica NPs owing to the residual S of dimethyl sulfoxide in the preparation. Scintillation images of 3H at 1670Â Â±Â 9 Bq/0.5 Âµl and 347Â Â±Â 6 Bq/0.5 Âµl dropped in a 2 mm hole on the scintillator-silica FPs (6.78 and 10 Âµm) were also obtained using the CCD imager for a 2 h exposure.

We apply a detailed microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo model of the creation and subsequent thermalization of hot electrons produced by gamma irradiation of six important scintillating crystals to determine the spatial extent of the cloud of excitations produced by gamma rays and the time required for the cloud to thermalize with the host lattice. The main ingredients of themoreÂ Â» model are ensembles of microscopic track structures produced upon gamma excitation (including the energy distribution of the excited carriers), numerical estimates of electron-phonon scattering rates, and a calculated particle dispersion to relate the speed and energy of excited carriers. All these ingredients are based on first-principles density functional theory calculations of the electronic and phonon band structures of the materials. The details of the Monte Carlo model are presented along with the results for thermalization time and distance distributions. Here, these results are discussed in light of previous work. It is found that among the studied materials, calculated thermalization distances are positively correlated with measured nonproportionality. In the important class of halide scintillators, the particle dispersion is found to be more influential than the largest phonon energy in determining the thermalization distance.Â«Â less\n\nMonte Carlo simulation of electron thermalization in scintillator materials: Implications for scintillator nonproportionality\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPrange, Micah P.; Xie, YuLong; Campbell, Luke W.\n\n2017-12-21\n\nThe lack of reliable quantitative estimates of the length and time scales associated with hot electron thermalization after a gamma-ray induced energy cascade obscures the interplay of various microscopic processes controlling scintillator performance and hampers the search for improved detector materials.

Recently halide scintillator materials, such as Ce doped lanthanum bromide has been proved to be very important material for the same purpose. These materials are highly hygroscopic; a search for high light yield non-hygroscopic materials was highly desirable to advance the scintillator technology. In this paper, we are reporting the crystal growth of novel scintillator materials, cesium cerium bromide (Cs2CeBr5) and potassium cerium bromide (K2CeBr5). Crystals were successfully grown from the melt using the vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger technique, in a comparison with the high performance LaBr3 or LaCl3 crystals, cerium based alkali halides crystals, (Cs2CeBr5) and (K2CeBr5) have similar scintillation properties, while being much less hygroscopic. Furthermore, cesium based compounds will not suffer from the self-activity present in potassium and lanthanum compounds. However the Cs2CeBr5 crystals did not grow properly probably due to non-congruent melting or to some phase transition during cooling.

The evolution of the scintillator yield with ion fluence has been carried out for all the scintillators to estimate radiation damage. Finally, measurements of the decay time of these materials using a system of pulsed beam accelerated particles have been done. Among the screens under study, the TG-Green is the best suited material, in terms of absolute efficiency, temporal response and degradation with ion dose, for fast-ion loss detectors in fusion devices.\n\nDetection of gamma-neutron radiation by solid-state scintillation detectors. Detection of gamma-neutron radiation by novel solid-state scintillation detectors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRyzhikov, V.; Grinyov, B.; Piven, L.\n\nIt is known that solid-state scintillators can be used for detection of both gamma radiation and neutron flux. In the past, neutron detection efficiencies of such solid-state scintillators did not exceed 5-7%. At the same time it is known that the detection efficiency of the gamma-neutron radiation characteristic of nuclear fissionable materials is by an order of magnitude higher than the efficiency of detection of neutron fluxes alone. Thus, an important objective is the creation of detection systems that are both highly efficient in gamma-neutron detection and also capable of exhibiting high gamma suppression for use in the role ofmoreÂ Â» detection of neutron radiation. In this work, we present the results of our experimental and theoretical studies on the detection efficiency of fast neutrons from a {sup 239}Pu-Be source by the heavy oxide scintillators BGO, GSO, CWO and ZWO, as well as ZnSe(Te, O). The most probable mechanism of fast neutron interaction with nuclei of heavy oxide scintillators is the inelastic scattering (n, n'Î³) reaction. In our work, fast neutron detection efficiencies were determined by the method of internal counting of gamma-quanta that emerge in the scintillator from (n, n''Î³) reactions on scintillator nuclei with the resulting gamma energies of â¼20-300 keV. The measured efficiency of neutron detection for the scintillation crystals we considered was â¼40-50 %. The present work included a detailed analysis of detection efficiency as a function of detector and area of the working surface, as well as a search for new ways to create larger-sized detectors of lower cost. As a result of our studies, we have found an unusual dependence of fast neutron detection efficiency upon thickness of the oxide scintillators. An explanation for this anomaly may involve the competition of two factors that accompany inelastic scattering on the heavy atomic nuclei.

Dalla; Cinausero, M.; Maggioni, G.; Quaranta, A.; Collazuol, G.; Bermudez, J.\n\nNeutron detectors are extensively used at many nuclear research facilities across Europe. Their application range covers many topics in basic and applied nuclear research: in nuclear structure and reaction dynamics (reaction reconstruction and decay studies); in nuclear astrophysics (neutron emission probabilities); in nuclear technology (nuclear data measurements and in-core/off-core monitors); in nuclear medicine (radiation monitors, dosimeters); in materials science (neutron imaging techniques); in homeland security applications (fissile materials investigation and cargo inspection). Liquid scintillators, widely used at present, have however some drawbacks given by toxicity, flammability, volatility and sensitivity to oxygen that limit their duration and quality. Even plastic scintillators are not satisfactory because they have low radiation hardness and low thermal stability. Moreover organic solvents may affect their optical properties due to crazing. In order to overcome these problems, phenyl-polysiloxane based scintillators have been recently developed at Legnaro National Laboratory. This new solution showed very good chemical and thermal stability and high radiation hardness. The results on the different samples performance will be presented, paying special attention to a characterization comparison between synthesized phenyl containing polysiloxane resins where a Pt catalyst has been used and a scintillating material obtained by condensation reaction, where tin based compounds are used as catalysts. Different structural arrangements as a result of different substituents on the main chain have been investigated by High Resolution X-Ray Diffraction, while the effect of improved optical transmittance on the scintillation yield has been elucidated by a combination of excitation/fluorescence measurements and scintillation yield under exposure to alpha and Î³-rays.\n\nDoped Lanthanum Hafnates as Scintillating Materials for High-Energy Photon Detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWahid, Kareem; Pokhrel, Madhab; Mao, Yuanbing\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of nanocrystalline complex oxide scintillators for use in X-ray and gamma-ray detection.

The stability of the scintillator constituents was determined through fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as an multivariate analysis tool. By exposing the scintillator liquid to a well-known photon flux at 365 nm and by measuring the decay rate of the fluorescence shifters and the formation rate of their photochemical degradation products, we can place an upper limit on the acceptable photon flux as 1.38 Â± 0.09 Ã 10 -11 photon mol L -1 . Similarly, the oxidative stability of the scintillator liquid was determined by exposure to air at several elevated temperatures. Through measurement of the corresponding activation energy it was determined that the average oxygen concentration would have to be kept below 4.3-7.1 ppb w (headspace partial pressure below 24 ppm v ). On the other hand, the thermal stability of the scintillator cocktail in the absence of light and oxygen was remarkable and poses no concern to the SNO+ experiment.\n\nOptical transmission radiation damage and recovery stimulation of DSB: Ce3+ inorganic scintillation material\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBorisevich, A.; Dormenev, V.; Korjik, M.; Kozlov, D.; Mechinsky, V.; Novotny, R. W.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nRecently, a new scintillation material DSB: Ce3+ was announced. It can be produced in a form of glass or nano-structured glass ceramics with application of standard glass production technology with successive thermal annealing. When doped with Ce3+, material can be applied as scintillator. Light yield of scintillation is near 100 phe/MeV. Un-doped material has a wide optical window from 4.5eV and can be applied to detect Cherenkov light. Temperature dependence of the light yield LY(T) is 0.05% which is 40 times less than in case of PWO. It can be used for detectors tolerant to a temperature variation between -20Â° to +20Â°C. Several samples with dimensions of 15x15x7 mm3 have been tested for damage effects on the optical transmission under irradiation with Î³-quanta. It was found that the induced absorption in the scintillation range depends on the doping concentration and varies in range of 0.5-7 m-1. Spontaneous recovery of induced absorption has fast initial component. Up to 25% of the damaged transmission is recuperated in 6 hours. Afterwards it remains practically constant if the samples are kept in the dark. However, induced absorption is reduced by a factor of 2 by annealing at 50Â°C and completely removed in a short time when annealing at 100Â°C. A significant acceleration of the induced absorption recovery is observed by illumination with visible and IR light. This effect is observed for the first time in a Ce-doped scintillation material. It indicates, that radiation induced absorption in DSB: Ce scintillation material can be retained at the acceptable level by stimulation with light in a strong irradiation environment of collider experiments.\n\nComposite solid-state scintillators for neutron detection\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDai, Sheng; Im, Hee-Jung; Pawel, Michelle D.\n\n2006-09-12\n\nApplicant's present invention is a composite scintillator for neutron detection comprising a matrix material fabricated from an inorganic sol-gel precursor solution homogeneously doped with a liquid scintillating material and a neutron absorbing material.

Since the first notice in 1895 by Roentgen of the production of light by X-rays on a barium platinocyanide screen, and Thomas Edison's work over the following 2 years resulting in the discovery of calcium tungstate as a superior fluoroscopy screen, much research and experimentation have been undertaken to discover and elucidate the properties of new scintillators. Scintillators with high density and high atomic number are prized for the detection of gamma rays above 1 MeV; lower atomic number, lower-density materials find use for detecting beta particles and heavy charged particles; hydrogenous scintillators find use in fast-neutron detection; and boron-, lithium-, and gadolinium-containing scintillators are used for slow-neutron detection. This chapter provides the practitioner with an overview of the general characteristics of scintillators, including the variation of probability of interaction with density and atomic number, the characteristics of the light pulse, a list and characteristics of commonly available scintillators and their approximate cost, and recommendations regarding the choice of material for a few specific applications.

Patrick; Simmons, Blake A.\n\n2011-07-26\n\nWe describe the preparation and characterization of two zinc hybrid luminescent structures based on the flexible and emissive linker molecule, trans-(4-R,4'-R') stilbene, where R and R' are mono- or poly-coordinating groups, which retain their luminescence within these solid materials. For example, reaction of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid and zinc nitrate in the solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) yielded a dense 2-D network featuring zinc in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination environments connected by trans-stilbene links. Similar reaction in diethylformamide (DEF) at higher temperatures resulted in a porous, 3-D framework structure consisting of two interpenetrating cubic lattices, each featuring basic to zinc carboxylate vertices joined by trans-stilbene, analogous to the isoreticular MOF (IRMOF) series. We demonstrate that the optical properties of both embodiments correlate directly with the local ligand environments observed in the crystal structures. We further demonstrate that these materials produce high luminescent response to proton radiation and high radiation tolerance relative to prior scintillators. These features can be used to create sophisticated scintillating detection sensors.\n\nExtruded plastic scintillator including inorganic powders\n\nDOEpatents\n\nBross, Alan D.; Mellott, Kerry L.; Pla-Dalmau, Anna\n\n2006-06-27\n\nA method for producing a plastic scintillator is disclosed.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in organic scintillators due to exciting discoveries related to neutron discrimination and gamma-ray spectroscopy, which represent capabilities previously thought not possible in these materials. I will discuss our development of crystalline and polymer-based scintillators for these applications. Structure-property relationships related to intermolecular interactions and host-guest electronic exchange will be discussed in the context of energy-transfer pathways relevant to scintillation. An emphasis will be placed on the rational design of these materials, as guided by first principles and DFT calculations. Two related topics will be discussed: 1) Incorporation of organometallic triplet-harvesting additives to plastic scintillator matrices to confer a 'two-state' (singlet and triplet) luminescence signature to different types of ionizing radiation. This approach relies upon energetic and spatial overlap between the donor and acceptor excited states for efficient electronic exchange. Key considerations also include synthetic modification of the luminescence spectra and kinetics, as well as the addition of secondary additives to increase the recombination efficiency. 2) Design of organotin-containing plastic scintillators as a route towards gamma-ray spectroscopy. Organometallic compounds were selected on the basis of distance-dependent quenching relationships, phase compatibility with the polymer matrix, and the gamma-ray cross sections. This approach is guided by molecular modeling and radiation transport modeling to achieve the highest possible detection sensitivity luminescence intensity.\n\nHigh-symmetry organic scintillator systems\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFeng, Patrick L.\n\n2018-02-06\n\nAn ionizing radiation detector or scintillator system includes a scintillating material comprising an organic crystalline compound selected to generate photons in response to the passage of ionizing radiation.

These advantages include increased data rates and reduced operating power and system weight. One serious limiting factor in a lasercom system is Optical turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. This turbulence breaks up the laser beam used to transmit the information into multiple segments that interfere with each other when the beam is focused onto the receiver. This interference pattern at the receiver changes with time causing fluctuations in the received optical intensity (scintillation). Scintillation leads to intermittent losses of the signal and an overall reduction in the lasercom system's performance. Since scintillation is a coherent effect, reducing the spatial and temporal coherence of the laser beam will reduce the scintillation. Transmitting a laser beam through certain materials is thought to reduce its coherence. Materials that were tested included: sapphire, BK7 glass, fused silica and others. The spatial and temporal coherence of the laser beam was determined by examining the interference patterns (fringes) it formed when interacting with various interferometers and etalons.\n\nHighly Soluble p-Terphenyl and Fluorene Derivatives as Efficient Dopants in Plastic Scintillators for Sensitive Nuclear Material Detection.\n\nPubMed\n\nYemam, Henok A; Mahl, Adam; Tinkham, Jonathan S; Koubek, Joshua T; Greife, Uwe; Sellinger, Alan\n\n2017-07-03\n\nPlastic scintillators are commonly used as first-line detectors for special nuclear materials. Current state-of-the-art plastic scintillators based on poly(vinyltoluene) (PVT) matrices containing high loadings (>15.0â wtâ%) of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) offer neutron signal discrimination in gamma radiation background (termed pulse shape discrimination, PSD), however, they suffer from poor mechanical properties. In this work, a series of p-terphenyl and fluorene derivatives were synthesized and tested as dopants in PVT based plastic scintillators as possible alternatives to PPO to address the mechanical property issue and to study the PSD mechanism. The derivatives were synthesized from low cost starting materials in high yields using simple chemistry. The photophysical and thermal properties were investigated for their influence on radiation sensitivity/detection performance, and mechanical stability. A direct correlation was found between the melting point of the dopants and the subsequent mechanical properties of the PVT based plastic scintillators. For example, select fluorene derivatives used as dopants produced scintillator samples with mechanical properties exceeding those of the commercial PPO-based scintillators while producing acceptable PSD capabilities. The physical properties of the synthesized dopants were also investigated to examine their effect on the final scintillator samples. Planar derivatives of fluorene were found to be highly soluble in PVT matrices with little to no aggregation induced effects. Â© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, when it comes to tissue-equivalent dose measurements, a plastic scintillator such as polyvinyl toluene (PVT) is a more appropriate material than an inorganic scintillator because of the mass energy absorption coefficient. To verify the difference in the absorbed doses for each scintillator, absorbed doses from the energy spectrum and the calculated absorbed dose were compared. From the results, the absorbed dose of the plastic scintillator was almost the same as that of the tissue for the overall photon energy. However, in the case of CsI, it was similar to that of the tissue only for a photon energy from 500 to 4000 keV. Thus, the values and tendency of the mass energy absorption coefficient of the PVT are much more similar to those of human tissue than those of the CsI. Â© The Author 2015.

Plastic scintillators provide an affordable approach to large volume detectors, yet their performance for high-energy gamma radiation is severely limited by the small radiation stopping power inherent to their low atomic number. Although some sensitization attempts with organometallics were made in the 1950s to 1960s, the concomitant decrease in light yield has limited the usefulness of these sensitized detectors. Recently, with new knowledge gained during the rapid development of organic optoelectronics and nanotechnology, there has been a revived interest in the field of heavy element sensitized plastic scintillators. Here, the recent efforts on sensitized plastic scintillators are summarized. Basic scintillator physics is first reviewed. The discussion then focuses on two major thrusts in the field: sensitization with: (1) organometallics and (2) oxide and fluoride nanoparticles. The design rationales and major results are examined in detail, with existing limitations and possible future pathways discussed. Special attention is paid to the underlying energy deposition and transfer processes, as these determine the key performance metrics such as light yield and radioluminescence decay lifetime.

P.; Eriksson, L.\n\nScintillation materials that lack intrinsic luminescence centers must be doped with optically active ions in order to provide luminescent centers that radiatively de-excite as the final step of the scintillation process. Codoping, on the other hand, can be defined as the incorporation of additional specific impurity species usually for the purpose of modifying the scintillation properties, mechanical properties, or the crystal growth behavior. In recent years codoping has become an increasingly popular approach for engineering scintillators with optimal performance for targeted applications. This report reviews several successful examples and its effect on specific properties.\n\nUpconverting nanoparticles for optimizing scintillator based detection systems\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKross, Brian; McKisson, John E; McKisson, John; Weisenberger, Andrew; Xi, Wenze; Zom, Carl\n\n2013-09-17\n\nAn upconverting device for a scintillation detection system is provided.

Even though they are amenable to cutting-edge theoretical spectroscopy techniques, surprisingly many fundamental properties of scintillator materials are still unknown or not well explored. In this work, we use first-principles approaches to thoroughly study the optical properties of four scintillator materials: NaI, LaBr 3, BaI 2, and SrI 2. By solving the BetheâSalpeter equation for the optical polarization function we study the influence ofmoreÂ Â» excitonic effects on dielectric and electron-energy loss functions. This work sheds light into fundamental optical properties of these four scintillator materials and lays the ground-work for future work that is geared toward accurate modeling and computational materials design of advanced radiation detectors with unprecedented energy resolution.Â«Â less\n\nDivalent europium doped and un-doped calcium iodide scintillators: Scintillator characterization and single crystal growth\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBoatner, L. A.; Ramey, J. O.; Kolopus, J. A.\n\n2015-02-21\n\nInitially, the alkaline-earth scintillator, CaI 2:Eu 2+, was discovered around 1964 by Hofstadter, Odell, and Schmidt. Serious practical problems quickly arose, however, that were associated with the growth of large monolithic single crystals of this material due to its lamellar, mica-like structure. As a result of its theoretically higher light yield, CaI 2:Eu 2+ has the potential to exceed the excellent scintillation performance of SrI 2:Eu 2+. In fact, theoretical predictions for the light yield of CaI2:Eu 2+ scintillators suggested that an energy resolution approaching 2% at 662 keV could be achievable. Like the early SrI 2:Eu 2+ scintillator, themoreÂ Â» performance of CaI 2:Eu 2+ scintillators has traditionally suffered due, at least in part, to outdated materials synthesis, component stoichiometry/purity, and single-crystal-growth techniques. Based on our recent work on SrI 2:Eu 2+ scintillators in single-crystal form, we have developed new techniques that are applied here to CaI 2:Eu 2+ and pure CaI 2 with the goal of growing large un-cracked crystals and, potentially, realizing the theoretically predicted performance of the CaI 2:Eu 2+ form of this material. Calcium iodide does not adhere to modern glassy carbon Bridgman crucibles - so there should be no differential thermal-contraction-induced crystal/crucible stresses on cooling that would result in crystal cracking of the lamellar structure of CaI 2. Here we apply glassy carbon crucible Bridgman growth, high-purity growth-charge compounds, our molten salt processing/filtration technique, and extended vacuum-melt-pumping methods to the growth of both CaI 2:Eu 2+ and un-doped CaI 2. Moreover, large scintillating single crystals were obtained, and detailed characterization studies of the scintillation properties of CaI 2:Eu 2+ and pure CaI 2 single crystals are presented that include studies of the effects of plastic deformation of the crystals on the scintillator performance.Â«Â less\n\nBinderless composite scintillator for neutron detection\n\nDOEpatents\n\nHodges, Jason P [Knoxville, TN; Crow, Jr; Lowell, M [Oak Ridge, TN; Cooper, Ronald G [Oak Ridge, TN\n\n2009-03-10\n\nComposite scintillator material consisting of a binderless sintered mixture of a Lithium (Li) compound containing .sup.6Li as the neutron converter and Y.sub.2SiO.sub.5:Ce as the scintillation phosphor, and the use of this material as a method for neutron detection.

In general, most oxide materials, such as BGO and LSO:Ce, are thought to have an intrinsic proportional response that is nearly constant between samples and independent of growth conditions. Since light yield nonproportionality is responsible for degrading the achievable energy resolution of all known scintillators, it is important to understand what contributes to the behavior. In this study, in an attempt to understand if the phenomenon can be affected bymoreÂ Â» growth parameters or by other means, seven samples of YAP:Ce were collected from various sources, and eight samples were grown inhouse using the Czochralski method. Based on optical and scintillation measurement as well as direct measurement of the cerium concentration, it was determined that the light yield proportionality in YAlO3:Ce is strongly related to the cerium concentration. Samples that were found to have a higher relative cerium concentration displayed a more proportional light yield response. In addition, it was determined that samples with a higher cerium concentration also exhibit a faster decay time and an enhanced energy resolution when compared to samples with less cerium. Finally, it was also determined that growth in a reducing atmosphere can effectively suppress a parasitic optical absorption band.Â«Â less\n\nCorrelation of Non-proportionality and Scintillation Properties with Cerium Concentration in YAlO 3:Ce\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDonnald, Samuel B.; Williams, Richard; Melcher, Charles L.\n\nCerium doped YAlO3 (YAP:Ce) is an interesting oxide scintillator in that it exhibits a wider range of light yield non-proportionality on a sample-to-sample basis than most other well-known oxide scintillators.

The same material supplied by other manufacturer (CIEMAT) has been used to compare the yields for both samples. We will refer to these screens as TGa and TGb for the corresponding to Sarnoff Co. and CIEMAT, respectively. The P46 is a rare earth oxide Y3Al5O12 (YAG) doped with Ce by 0.15% CeO2, manufactured by Proxitronic GmbH, Germany. The luminescence emission consists in a broad peak, centered at 550 nm with a stated decay time constant of 70 ns. [11]. The P46 has been widely applied to fusion plasma diagnostic and in particular to fast-ion loss detection on several devices such as TFTR and NSTX [12,13]. Finally, the P56 scintillator is a Eu doped Y2O3 powder substrate, Y2O3:Eu3+, manufactured by AST Corporation, England. Although this material has a high efficiency, its light emission has a long decay time of 2 ms [14], making the P56 unsuitable to follow the frequency of the MHD fluctuations.The samples were deposited using different processes directly by the manufacturers on 2 mm thick stainless steel plates. It is important to remind that reflections on the substrate may contribute to a luminescence enhancement of the thin scintillator screens. Therefore, the screens under study here as well as the experimental set-up were designed to mimic the real operation of a fast-ion loss detector.\n\nOptical Design Considerations for Efficient Light Collection from Liquid Scintillation Counters\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBernacki, Bruce E.; Douglas, Matthew; Erchinger, Jennifer L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLiquid scintillation counters measure charged particle-emitting radioactive isotopes and are used for environmental studies, nuclear chemistry, and life science. Alpha and beta emissions arising from the material under study interact with the scintillation cocktail to produce light. The prototypical liquid scintillation counter employs low-level photon-counting detectors to measure the arrival of the scintillation light produced as a result of the dissolved material under study interacting with the scintillation cocktail. For reliable operation the counting instrument must convey the scintillation light to the detectors efficiently and predictably. Current best practices employ the use of two or more detectors for coincidence processingmoreÂ Â» to discriminate true scintillation events from background events due to instrumental effects such as photomultiplier tube dark rates, tube flashing, or other light emission not generated in the scintillation cocktail vial. In low background liquid scintillation counters additional attention is paid to shielding the scintillation cocktail from naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) present in the laboratory and within the instruments construction materials. Low background design is generally at odds with optimal light collection. This study presents the evolution of a light collection design for liquid scintillation counting in a low background shield. The basic approach to achieve both good light collection and a low background measurement is described. The baseline signals arising from the scintillation vial are modeled and methods to efficiently collect scintillation light are presented as part of the development of a customized low-background, high sensitivity liquid scintillation counting system.Â«Â less\n\nNovel scintillating material 2-(4-styrylphenyl)benzoxazole for the fully digital and MRI compatible J-PET tomograph based on plastic scintillators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDulski, Kamil; NiedÅºwiecki, Szymon; Alfs, Dominika; BiaÅas, Piotr; Curceanu, Catalina; CzerwiÅski, Eryk; Danel, Andrzej; Gajos, Aleksander; GÅowacz, Bartosz; Gorgol, Marek; Hiesmayr, Beatrix; JasiÅska, BoÅ¼ena; Kacprzak, Krzysztof; KamiÅska, Daria; KapÅon, Åukasz; Kochanowski, Andrzej; Korcyl, Grzegorz; Kowalski, PaweÅ; Kozik, Tomasz; KrzemieÅ, Wojciech; Kubicz, Ewelina; Kucharek, Mateusz; Mohammed, Muhsin; Pawlik-NiedÅºwiecka, Monika; PaÅka, Marek; RaczyÅski, Lech; Rudy, Zbigniew; Rundel, Oleksandr; Sharma, Neha G.; Silarski, MichaÅ; Uchacz, Tomasz; WiÅlicki, Wojciech; ZgardziÅska, BoÅ¼ena; ZieliÅski, Marcin; Moskal, PaweÅ\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA novel plastic scintillator is developed for the application in the digital positron emission tomography (PET).

Patrick\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe present work addresses the need for solid-state, fast neutron discriminating scintillators that possess higher light yields and faster decay kinetics than existing organic scintillators. These respective attributes are of critical importance for improving the gamma-rejection capabilities and increasing the neutron discrimination performance under high-rate conditions. Two key applications that will benefit from these improvements include large-volume passive detection scenarios as well as active interrogation search for special nuclear materials. Molecular design principles were employed throughout this work, resulting in synthetically tailored materials that possess the targeted scintillation properties.\n\nNeutron crosstalk between liquid scintillators\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVerbeke, J.

Using a spontaneous fission source, this method can be utilized to quickly characterize an array of liquid scintillators in terms of crosstalk. The point model theory due to Feynman is corrected to account for these multiple scatterings. Using spectral information measured by the liquid scintillators, fractions of multiple scattering can be estimated, and mass reconstruction of fissile materials under investigation can be improved. Monte Carlo simulations of mono-energetic neutron sources were performed to estimate neutron crosstalk. A californium source in an array of liquid scintillators wasmoreÂ Â» modeled to illustrate the improvement of the mass reconstruction.Â«Â less\n\nDivalent fluoride doped cerium fluoride scintillator\n\nDOEpatents\n\nAnderson, David F.; Sparrow, Robert W.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe use of divalent fluoride dopants in scintillator materials comprising cerium fluoride is disclosed. The preferred divalent fluoride dopants are calcium fluoride, strontium fluoride, and barium fluoride. The preferred amount of divalent fluoride dopant is less than about two percent by weight of the total scintillator. Cerium fluoride scintillator crystals grown with the addition of a divalent fluoride have exhibited better transmissions and higher light outputs than crystals grown without the addition of such dopants. These scintillators are useful in radiation detection and monitoring applications, and are particularly well suited for high-rate applications such as positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nMagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for the collection and direct measurement of adsorbed alpha-emitting radionuclides from environmental waters by liquid scintillation analysis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nO'Hara, Matthew J.; Addleman, R. Shane\n\nRadioactive contamination in the environment, be it from accidental or intentional release, can create an urgent need to assess water and food supplies, the environment, and monitor human health. Alpha-emitting radionuclides represent the most ionizing, and therefore the most damaging, form of radiation when internalized. Additionally, because of its ease of energy attenuation in solids or liquids, alpha emissions cannot be reliably monitored using non-destructive means. In the event of such an emergency, rapid and efficient methods will be needed to screen scores of samples (food, water, and human excreta) within a short time window. Unfortunately, the assay of alpha-emittingmoreÂ Â» radionuclides using traditional radioanalytical methods is typically labor intensive and time consuming. The creation of analytical counting sources typically requires a series of chemical treatment steps to achieve well performing counting sources. In an effort to devise radioanalytical methods that are fast, require little labor, and minimize the use of toxic or corrosive agents, researchers at PNNL have evaluated magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles as extracting agents for alpha-emitting radionuclides from chemically unmodified aqueous systems. It is demonstrated that bare magnetic nanoparticles exhibit high affinity for representative Î±-emitting radionuclides (241Am and 210Po) from representative aqueous matrices: river and ground water. Furthermore, use of the magnetic properties of these materials to concentrate the sorbed analyte from the bulk aqueous solution has been demonstrated. The nanoparticle concentrate can be either directly dispensed into scintillation cocktail, or first dissolved and then added to scintillation cocktail as a solution for alpha emission assay by liquid scintillation analysis. Despite the extreme quench caused by the metal oxide suspensions, the authors have demonstrated that quench correction features available on modern liquid scintillation analyzers\n\nCalculations and measurements of the scintillator-to-water stopping power ratio of liquid scintillators for use in proton radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nIngram, W Scott; Robertson, Daniel; Beddar, Sam\n\n2015-03-11\n\nLiquid scintillators are a promising detector for high-resolution three-dimensional proton therapy dosimetry. Because the scintillator comprises both the active volume of the detector and the phantom material, an ideal scintillator will exhibit water equivalence in its radiological properties. One of the most fundamental of these is the scintillator's stopping power. The objective of this study was to compare calculations and measurements of scintillator-to-water stopping power ratios to evaluate the suitability of the liquid scintillators BC-531 and OptiPhase HiSafe 3 for proton dosimetry. We also measured the relative scintillation output of the two scintillators. Both calculations and measurements show that the linear stopping power of OptiPhase is significantly closer to water than that of BC-531. BC-531 has a somewhat higher scintillation output. OptiPhase can be mixed with water at high concentrations, which further improves its scintillator-to-water stopping power ratio. However, this causes the solution to become cloudy, which has a negative impact on the scintillation output and spatial resolution of the detector. OptiPhase is preferred over BC-531 for proton dosimetry because its density and scintillator-to-water stopping power ratio are more water equivalent.\n\nHigh-efficiency organic glass scintillators\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFeng, Patrick L.; Carlson, Joseph S.\n\nA new family of neutron/gamma discriminating scintillators is disclosed that comprises stable organic glasses that may be melt-cast into transparent monoliths. These materials have been shown to provide light yields greater than solution-grown trans-stilbene crystals and efficient PSD capabilities when combined with 0.01 to 0.05% by weight of the total composition of a wavelength-shifting fluorophore. Photoluminescence measurements reveal fluorescence quantum yields that are 2 to 5 times greater than conventional plastic or liquid scintillator matrices, which accounts for the superior light yield of these glasses. The unique combination of high scintillation light-yields, efficient neutron/gamma PSD, and straightforward scale-up via melt-castingmoreÂ Â» distinguishes the developed organic glasses from existing scintillators.Â«Â less\n\nSegmented scintillation antineutrino detector\n\nDOEpatents\n\nReyna, David\n\n2017-05-09\n\nThe various technologies presented herein relate to incorporating a wavelength-shifting material in a scintillator to facilitate absorption of a first electromagnetic particle (e.g., a first photon) having a first wavelength and subsequent generation and emission of a second electromagnetic particle (e.g., a second photon) having a second wavelength. The second electromagnetic particle can be emitted isotropically, with a high probability that the direction of emission of the second electromagnetic particle is disparate to the direction of travel of the first electromagnetic particle (and according angle of incidence). Isotropic emission of the second electromagnetic particle enables the second electromagnetic particle to be retained in the scintillator owing to internal reflection. Accordingly, longer length scintillators can be constructed, and accordingly, the scintillator array has a greater area (and volume) over which to detect electromagnetic particles (e.g., antineutrinos) being emitted from a nuclear reaction.\n\nNew Developments in Scintillators for Security Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGlodo, Jarek; Wang, Yimin; Shawgo, Ryan; Brecher, Charles; Hawrami, Rastgo H.; Tower, Joshua; Shah, Kanai S.\n\nRadiation is an important part of security space: It is detected either passively in search of special nuclear materials or actively to monitor or interrogate objects of interest. Systems relying on radiation require adequate detectors. The most common radiation detectors are based on scintillating materials that convert hard (gamma, x-ray or neutron) radiation into visible light registered by a photodetector. The last decade has seen development of new materials driven by various security applications. This included the search for He-3 replacement technologies, which resulted in development of neutron sensing scintillators such as Ce-doped Cs2LiYCl6 (CLYC) or more recently Cs2LiLa(Br,Cl)6 (CLLBC). Since they are also good gamma-ray scintillators, they have also penetrated the detection market for passive dual-mode (gamma and neutron) detection systems, replacing scintillators such as NaI(Tl) or CsI(Tl) and competing with LaBr3(Ce). High-energy Non-Intrusive Inspection is another area where active research is being pursued in order to replace existing scintillator choices such as CdWO4, which is commonly used in simple radiography, and PbWO4, which is being studied for spectroscopic alternatives to radiography. For radiography, in particular, new ceramic scintillators such as Ce-doped GLuGAG (garnet) are considered, and for spectroscopy, Yb doped Lu2O3. In this paper we provide a short overview of these technologies.\n\nScintillator handbook with emphasis on cesium iodide\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTidd, J. L.; Dabbs, J.

This conversion effectively caps the defective area of the tantalum pentoxide dielectric and prevents short-circuit failures. Typically, this type of breakdown has no immediate catastrophic consequences and is often considered as nuisance rather than a failure. Scintillation breakdowns likely do not affect failures of parts under surge current conditions, and so-called \"proofing\" of tantalum chip capacitors, which is a controllable exposure of the part after soldering to voltages slightly higher than the operating voltage to verify that possible scintillations are self-healed, has been shown to improve the quality of the parts. However, no in-depth studies of the effect of scintillations on reliability of tantalum capacitors have been performed so far. KEMET is using scintillation breakdown testing as a tool for assessing process improvements and to compare quality of different manufacturing lots. Nevertheless, the relationship between failures and scintillation breakdowns is not clear, and this test is not considered as suitable for lot acceptance testing. In this work, scintillation breakdowns in different military-graded and commercial tantalum capacitors were characterized and related to the rated voltages and to life test failures. A model for assessment of times to failure, based on distributions of breakdown voltages, and accelerating factors of life testing are discussed.\n\nFiber optic thermal/fast neutron and gamma ray scintillation detector\n\nDOEpatents\n\nNeal, John S.; Mihalczo, John T\n\n2007-10-30\n\nA system for detecting fissile and fissionable material originating external to the system includes: a .sup.6Li loaded glass fiber scintillator for detecting thermal neutrons, x-rays and gamma rays; a fast scintillator for detecting fast neutrons, x-rays and gamma rays, the fast scintillator conjoined with the glass fiber scintillator such that the fast scintillator moderates fast neutrons prior to their detection as thermal neutrons by the glass fiber scintillator; and a coincidence detection system for processing the time distributions of arriving signals from the scintillators.\n\nLarge volume flow-through scintillating detector\n\nDOEpatents\n\nGritzo, Russ E.; Fowler, Malcolm M.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA large volume flow through radiation detector for use in large air flow situations such as incinerator stacks or building air systems comprises a plurality of flat plates made of a scintillating material arranged parallel to the air flow.
