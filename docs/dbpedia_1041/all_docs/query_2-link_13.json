        "text": "Millennium (1989)\n\nThis is the first of the films in which characters about to die are sucked from their impending doom and thrust into a surreal reality, or surreality™. As you can see from the poster above, this one involves a plane. Well, two planes. And they’re about to crash into each other. But all the passengers are already dead. Because they were see the first sentence. It’s not the greatest film in the world, but if you enjoy Cheryl Ladd and Kris Kristofferson looking like this…\n\nFreejack (1992)\n\nThe second film featuring a surreality™ doesn’t give away as much in the poster, other than its odd cast. You might think the flick has to do something with virtual reality, which is strictly The Lawnmower Man’s territory (no it’s not), when in fact it deals with a man (Emilio Estevez) being pulled into the future before his race car crashes. The reason why? Sir Anthony Hopkins wants his body. Seriously. Estevez escapes and becomes a Freejack (aha!), and is chased by Mick Jagger looking like this:\n\nGantz (2011)"
