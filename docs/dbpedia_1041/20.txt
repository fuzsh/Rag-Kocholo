New Information on Upcoming Korean Monster Movie Author: Kim Song-ho Source: CJ Entertainment The Korean film company and distributor CJ Entertainment and production company JK Film recently revealed the advance teaser poster for their upcoming 3D creature feature SECTOR 7 (7??, Chil gwangu). The revised design overall is basically the same as the promotional artwork distributed at the American Film Market in Santa Monica, CA back in November, but has been somewhat modified with a different color tone and added elements (mainly the smoke and the flying birds in the sky). It also shows the new English title logo for the film. Along with the new artwork, CJ and JK announced that they have pre-sold the picture to four international markets during AFM. The foreign distributors who have acquired rights to SECTOR 7 are TF1 Group of France, M Pictures Entertainment Public Company Ltd. from Thailand,

Author: Elliot Gay Official Site: sentoshojo.jp (Japan), Sushi Typhoon (US) Special Thanks to Marc Walkow and Norman England MUTANT GIRL SQUAD (Sento Shojo: Chi no Tekkamen Densetsu, 2010) might be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. One could attempt to describe it as a Japanese X-MEN though I have the feeling that might be missing the point entirely. It’s a film that cannot be put into any one category if only because its tone jumps around so frequently it is impossible to place. Don’t get me wrong, there is an entertaining story in here. Just understand that in my opinion it isn’t nearly as accessible as its predecessor ALIEN VS NINJA. Trying to summarize MUTANT GIRL SQUAD is akin to being asked how to take a hamster for a walk; you think you can do it but you’re not entirely

Author: Elliot Gay Official Site: The Sushi Typhoon Special Thanks to Marc Walkow Let me preface this review by stating that I love films and filmmakers who do a lot with very little. In this day and age it’s hard to find big budget films that go beyond the pretty explosions and mega stars to make something that is legitimately fun and/or shows the audience something they haven’t seen before. Maybe that’s why I have a soft spot for low budget Japanese films that seem to do anything and everything despite whether it makes sense or not. Sushi Typhoon’s first release, ALIEN VS NINJA, fits that bill perfectly. No doubt the film was made on what amounts to about 1/100th of the budget of a big budget American film. However, this doesn’t stop director and writer Seiji Chiba from getting crazy and using

Author: Elliot Gay Official Site: Sushi Typhoon Special Thanks to Marc Walkow and Emiko Kawai A SciFi JAPAN EXCLUSIVE During the 2009 American Film Market, Japan’s oldest film studio Nikkatsu Corporation announced their new genre film label the Sushi Typhoon, which would produce and internationally release "extreme movies" by such controversial and acclaimed filmmakers as Takashi Miike (ICHI THE KILLER, AUDITION), Sion Sono (LOVE EXPOSURE), and Yoshihiro Nishimura (TOKYO GORE POLICE, VAMPIRE GIRL VS FRANKENSTEIN GIRL). The first two Sushi Typhoon titles— the action gore comedy film ALIEN VS. NINJA and the splatter action comedy MUTANT GIRLS SQUAD— have already played the film festival circuit in the United States and Canada and are now slated for release on North American DVD and Blu-ray by FUNimation Entertainment in early 2011.

Latest News on Upcoming 3D Korean Monster Movie Author: Kim Song-ho Source: CJ Entertainment The Korean 3D creature film SECTOR 7 (7??, Chil gwanggu) is now in the post-production stage. The movie, which began production on June 16 and wrapped on September 29, is about a group of workers on an oil prospecting platform (called the `Eclipse`) being terrorized by a hostile undersea creature. It is one of the most anticipated genre pictures in Korea since it was one of the first domestic 3D films announced by a major production company and features a list of prominent cast and crew members. SECTOR 7 is produced by Youn Je-kyun, who directed the disaster hit HAEUNDAE (released in the US as TIDAL WAVE) through Youn`s company JK Film and CJ Entertainment.

Among the top 10 films in Japan in 2010 as of August, the leading four were grand scale 3D American productions with AVATAR winning the war of these foreign invaders. Domestic box office receipts in the first six months of this year, according to The Motion Pictures Producers Association of Japan, improved by over 1.5%. Theaters in Japan saw such a positive turnaround in the increase of audience numbers— despite the greater price in tickets for these films— that the new 3D movie technology made headline news across the

After much success at personal appearances in Hawaii, San Francisco and at San Diego Comic Con in years past, Mr. Ban met his enthusiastic Los Angeles fans August 14 and 15 during Little Tokyo`s Nisei Week celebration. Originally broadcast in Japan 1972, KIKAIDA (Jinzoningen Kikaida or ANDROID KIKAIDER) became a hit on Hawaiian television in 1974. Mr. Ban portrayed Jiro, the guitar-playing, motorcycle- riding hero who transformed into the android Kikaida. Mr. Ban soon started making wildly-received personal appearances in our 50th state.

Author: Kyle Byrd Source: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Official Site: predators-movie.com SPOILER WARNING: This article contains plot details for a new movie. John McTiernan’s 1987 film PREDATOR was an original, fun film that blended the action, horror and sci-fi genres seamlessly and has gone on to be one of the most beloved (and quotable) genre films of the 1980s. Since then, Fox has been trying to figure out where to take the series next. What we’ve gotten since has been a below par sequel (PREDATOR 2) and two abominable ALIEN VS PREDATOR movies. With the backlash triggered by the AVP films, Fox has decided to take the ALIEN and PREDATOR franchises in other directions. With Ridley Scott working on two ALIEN prequels, Robert Rodriguez decided it was a good time to get a PREDATOR sequel off the ground. Produced by Rodriguez and

Sci-Fi Movie Trilogy Ends on a Strong Note Author: Elliot Gay Official Movie Site: 20thboysfilms.com (US), 20th Boys (Japanese) SPOILER WARNING: This article contains plot details for a new movie. For those of you who would rather avoid any and all spoilers concerning the third film in the 20TH CENTURY BOYS series, let me state here and now: if you at all enjoyed the first two movies you will enjoy the third and final film just as much as-- if not more than-- the previous. Director Yukihiko Tsutsumi provides a satisfying and all-encompassing finale to a trilogy that had a great deal of sub-plots and loose ends to tie up.

The film is a Freudian biological nightmare revolving around Clive and Elsa (played by Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley), a romantically involved pair of scientists who have helped revolutionize genetic engineering by splicing together the DNA of different animals to create new hybrid creatures. When they try to experiment with human DNA, the company that funds their research won’t let them due to their fear of public outcry. Knowing that doing so could lead to breakthroughs in science and medicine, Clive and Elsa decide to conduct the experiments anyway. The result is Dren, a creature made up of human DNA, as well as the DNA of various animals. Dren appears and acts more human as she ages at an unusually fast

A Look at the International Model and Toy Show Held in Tokyo on January 10, 2010 Author: Ed Godziszewski Official Site: Super Festival In years past, it used to be a big deal to attend toy shows such as Super Festival— each show yielded not only its share of exclusive items, but they were a expeditious way to accomplish a good deal of shopping all in one place. Rather than spending time and train fare scurrying about Tokyo, Super Festival offered one-stop shopping where you could find not only most every current item, but also a nice selection of vintage (and sometimes otherwise unheard of) items. Due to a change in my business trip schedule, it had been almost 6 years since the last time I attended Super Festival, so attending this most recent incarnation this past January 10 impressed upon me just how much times
