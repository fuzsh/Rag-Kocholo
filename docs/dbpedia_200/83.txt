Ars Bellum is a low complexity game that allows players to recreate a wide range of battles throughout Antiquity. The game emphasizes playability without sacrificing historical flavor (order of battle, commanders, units with special abilities).

The core rules take up a mere 5 pages of the 16-page booklet which is replete with illustrations, examples of play, and scenario information. Ars Bellum is an ideal introductory wargame for those newer to the hobby, but can also satisfy more seasoned players in search of a lighter gaming experience.

The game is articulated around a fluctuating initiative system, and a variety of parameters such as leader quality, unique unit skills and specific scenario conditions. Each scenario is fought on a small format map (17" x 22" or 11" x 17") and can be completed in one or two hours, depending on the size of the battle. Units represent bodies of 500-2000 men, depending on the type of unit and the scenario played. In addition to their combat strength (including ranged fire when relevant), many units feature special capabilities that reflect their specific behavior in battle and/or use of particular equipment.

The present volume offers no less than twelve battles, featuring Romans, Gauls, Hellens, Carthaginians, including their generals.
