        "text": "The article provides a reconsideration of the movements of the army under the direction of the Spartan Pausanias before the last phase of the battle of Plataiai in 479 BC – the crucial moment of the Persian Wars, when Persian land forces in Greece were defeated and after the battle fled away from Greece. The author suggests that both literary sources and the topography of the Kithairon region provide a better understanding of the movement of Pausanias’ army. The strategic importance of Erythrai has been overlooked: the Kastron peak (656 m.) was vital for Pausanias to make an accurate reconnaissance of the landscape before the battle came to a final phase.\n\nDemetrius Poliorcetes spent seven years of his turbulent life as the king of Macedonia and the ruler of a large part of Greece. Two sources by the same author, Plutarh of Chaeronea (the biography of Poliorcestes himself and that of his protégé and nemesis, Pyrrhus of Epirus), credit the king with extensive military preparations that allegedly resulted in the creation of one of the largest military and naval forces in the Ancient history. Supposedly, in the final years of his reign, Poliorcetes commanded power that dwarfed that of Philip II and rivaled the strength of Alexander the Great. Strangely, when the actual conflict finally began, these forces suddenly disappear from the narrative. Modern historians, although generally highly skeptical of military and population figures asserted by ancient authors, showed surprising tendency to believe Plutarch’s claims and to build wider theories around them. Thus, the grand army Poliorcetes allegedly built was heavily used as an argument in the debate surrounding the effects of Alexander’s conquest on Macedonia proper, and the demography of Macedonia in the 3rd century BC. Few scholars made attempts to question these figures, in spite of strong reasons to do so, and in spite of the fact that several ancient sources – including Plutarch’s biographies themselves! – do supply information that directly contradicts these claims. In this paper I claim that the whole story of Poliorcetes’ exceptional military preparations for the alleged reconquest of his father’s Asian Empire, as well as the very size of the supposed army, should be rejected as false, as is already the case with many such episodes in writings of Plutarch.\n\nMy paper explores a significant but neglected inconsistency in Plutarch’s presentation of Sparta’s military characteristics within his Parallel Lives of the Spartan lawgiver Lykourgos and the early Roman king, Numa. The inconsistency in question involves a striking divergence between how Plutarch presents Spartan society and its military characteristics in the Life of Lykourgos and how he presents them in the Synkrisis comparing Lykourgos’ work with that of Numa. In the Life he presents Sparta’s military features as no more than a subsidiary aspect of the Lykourgan politeia. In contrast, in the Synkrisis he presents the Lykourgan politeia as significantly martial in character. This divergence has been insufficiently appreciated in previous scholarship, despite the long-recognised tendency of Plutarch’s synkriseis to problematise perspectives adopted in the preceding Lives. In my paper, Sections 1 and 2 examine the details of Plutarch’s divergent portrayals of Spartan society and its military characteristics, looking first at the Life of Lykourgos, then at the Synkrisis. Section 3 discusses the reasons for this divergence and how we should assess it in terms of Plutarch’s literary methods, his sources, his intellectual agenda, and historical perceptions of the character of classical Sparta."
