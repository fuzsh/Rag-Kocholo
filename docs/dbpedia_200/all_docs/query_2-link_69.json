        "text": "CR 13/MR 6\n\nLawful Neutral Gargantuan Aberration\n\nPathfinder Bestiary 4, pg. 13\n\nOnce the sacred guard in service of the Goddess Hera herself, Argus’ watchfulness and rigid sense of duty was ‘rewarded’ when Hermes killed him on order from Zeus. It’s all one big drama in Olympus! On Golarion, the story is a bit different; Punished for their hand in the Titans’ attempt to usurp the gods, the Argus are giants transformed into hundred-eyed sentries that tirelessly watch over all the sacred spaces of the world. To their credit, they take their new jobs very seriously, and haven’t attempted rebellion since.\n\nAn Argus is an impossibly vigilant sentry that cannot be blinded, their hundred eyes seeing more or less through everything, and I’m being serious here. Their “Senses” section alone has more abilities than some creatures’ entire statblocks. Just... Just LOOK at this: All-Around Vision (obviously), 60ft Darkvision AND See In Darkness just in case, Mistsight in case someone tries to be cute, True Sight if someone tries to be real cute, Detect Scrying and Arcane Sight in case someone tries cheating, and topping all of this off? Limitless Vision, an ability unique to the Argus that removes range penalties from Perception checks. When combined with Mythic Alertness (which allows them to expend a charge of Mythic power to automatically roll a 20 on a Perception check) they can see what each of your party members look like while you’re still dots on the horizon, or read a book from over your shoulder from the next city over if they need to... And they do need to. Guard duty is boring, and Argus are noted to actually enjoy company, inviting travelers to sit next to a nice, toasty fire, perhaps even set dinner out for the wanderers if the sentry notices someone heading towards them. Among all the punished giants, the Argus are the most polite, allowing visitors to sit alongside them to rest and refresh, especially if said visitors can tell the giants stories or sing them songs, both things they greatly enjoy.\n\nThe Argus crave beauty, comfort, and company, something I find adorable. However, should you insult them or attempt to sneak past them, you’ll quickly find that Argus DO take their jobs (and their appearance) very seriously. While cordial adventurers are at least offered a chance to turn back, those who insult the giant’s appearance or try and fight past them end up on the end of the creature’s claw-claw-bite. The bite of an Argus deals 2d8+14 damage, but for once the bite isn’t the most dangerous attack! No, the lengthy, lethal claws of the Argus deal 3d6+14 damage to anyone they hit and threaten to grab and grapple any victim they strike. If both claws strike the same target in the same round, the victim is raked for an additional 3d6+21 damage, meaning a full attack hitting can deal 3d8+9d6+63 damage.\n\nAnd it gets worse! Because being raked by an Argus or getting pinned while it’s grappling can lead it to automatically using a Dirty Trick to Eye Gouge its victim, potentially permanently blinding its victim by putting out their eyes. Ouch! And if they’re not taking away your eyes, they’re exploiting them with their Fascinating Gaze, an attack they can invoke that can potentially fascinate everyone within 40ft of them for 5d6 rounds. Creatures with 4 or less Hit Dice are instead dazed, too, which is handy for when the Argus is guarding a herd and doesn’t want its charges stampeding off at the first sign of trouble. While fascination is broken the instant the Argus attacks its target, it’s a good way to keep a team from attacking it all at once... and a great way to give itself some breathing room to request peace, or--if peace isn’t an option--set up its at-will True Strike to make its next blow count. There’s no limit to how often it can use Fascinating Gaze either, by the way.\n\nFighting one of these sentinels is rough, and it doesn’t get any easier because the Argus will always see you coming. Whether by use of its at-will Arcane Eye or Clairvoyance/Clairaudience, Agrus’ (Argi?) monitor not only their wards, but the surrounding countryside as well, creating a creepy surveillance state in which these giants monitor everything for any possible threat to its post. To live in the shadow of one of these sentinels is to always know you’re being watched. Even if you somehow, somehow manage to find a way past its infinite vision (possibly by exploiting its weakness to fascination or sleep effects, which it has from the myths!), the sentry’s Absolute Readiness means it can never be caught flat-footed or surprised. It’s much easier to just save everyone time and confront the giant head on, because doing anything else is just embarrassing yourself."
