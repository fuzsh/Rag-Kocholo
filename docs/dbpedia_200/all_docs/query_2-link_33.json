        "text": "Obviously a lot about Alexander was romanticized, but one thing I've always heard, my entire life, is that Alexander inspired confidence by fighting alongside his men.\n\nI don't find that itself hard to believe, but I often hear things like him \"being the first one up the ladder or over the wall\".\n\nThis is where I grow skeptical, because I know that antiquity-era battles had pretty high body counts, and I have doubts about Alexander running headlong into army after army and somehow surviving.\n\nSo I ask you, what do we know about Alexander's actual participation in the battles during his campaign?"
