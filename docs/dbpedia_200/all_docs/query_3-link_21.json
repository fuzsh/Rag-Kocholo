        "text": "25. Thucydides on the formation of the Delian League,\n\ncirca 477 BC\n\nThucydides (Greek, ÎÎ¿Ï ÎºÏ Î´Î¯Î´Î·Ï, Thoukydides; circa 460-395 BC), Greek historian and author from Alimos (ÎÎ»Î¹Î¼Î¿Ï), a coastal district of Athens. He also owned an estate including gold mines at Scapte Hyle (Î£ÎºÎ±ÏÏá½´ á½Î»Î·, a forest that may be dug; also referred to as Scaptensula, foss wood), near Neapolis (today Kavala), on the coast opposite the island of Thasos.\n\nSee:\n\nThucydides, The Peloponnesian War, Book 4, chapter 105, section 1. At Perseus Digital Library.\n\nPlutarch, Lives: Cimon, Chapter 4. At Perseus Digital Library.\n\nIt was at Scapte Hyle that Thucydides spent his last years, following his banishment from Athens, and completed his work History of the Peloponnesian War (ÎÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î± ÏÎ¿Ï Î ÎµÎ»Î¿ÏÎ¿Î½Î½Î·ÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ¿Ï Î Î¿Î»Î­Î¼Î¿Ï ), an account of the war between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century BC. Although quite different in style and approach to Herodotus' Histories, it continues historically from where Herodotus left off, at the end of the Greek-Persian wars. In turn, the Athenian soldier and historian Xenophon (see below) continued the story in his own way.\n\n\"The Athenians, having thus succeeded to the supremacy by the voluntary act of the allies through their hatred of Pausanias [the Spartan general], fixed which cities were to contribute money against the barbarian, which ships; their professed object being to retaliate for their sufferings by ravaging the King's country.\n\nNow was the time that the office of 'Treasurers for Hellas' was first instituted by the Athenians. These officers received the tribute, as the money contributed was called. The tribute was first fixed at four hundred and sixty talents. The common treasury was at Delos, and the congresses were held in the temple. Their supremacy commenced with independent allies who acted on the resolutions of a common congress.\"\n\nThucydides, The History of the Peloponnesian War, Book 1, chapter 4. Translated by Richard Crawley (1840-1893), 1874. At Project Gutenberg.\n\nThis and all other quotes from Thucydides below are from the translation by Richard Crawley (1840-1893), at Project Gutenberg.\n\nThe entire work is on a single web page and is also available in other formats.\n\n26. Stageira and the Chalcidian League\n\nNot much is known about the exact form, constitution or membership of the Chalcidian League (Greek, ÎÎ¿Î¹Î½ÏÎ½ Ïá¿¶Î½ Î§Î±Î»ÎºÎ¹Î´Î­ÏÎ½, Koinon of the Chalcideans), and the Greek word koinon is variously interpreted as commonwealth, league or federation. Olynthos was certainly at its head, offered \"joint citizenship and common laws\" to members (Xenophon, Hellenica, Book 5, chapter 2, sections 11-19, see below), and issued a common coinage showing a lyre, the symbol of Apollo. The league was alternately allied with and opposed by Sparta and Macedonia, and was eventually broken up by Philip II of Macedon in 348 BC (see History part 6).\n\nIt is thought that Stageira was a member of the Chalcidian League, which would also help explain why it appears to have ceased minting its own coins:\n\n\"In any case other evidence shows that Stageiros was a member of the Chalcidian League at the time of its destruction by Philip. Thus its coinage can be assigned only to the first quarter of the fourth century.\"\n\n\"The destruction of Stageiros is mentioned by Plut. Alex., 7, and we know from other sources that it was a member of the Chalcidian League, Strabo, VII, 331, frg. 35; Dion Chrys., XLVII, 9.\"\n\nAllen Brown West, The history of the Chalcidic League, pages 122 and 133. University of Wisconsin, 1919.\n\nAlthough West claimed that there is evidence that Stageira was a member of the Chalcidian League, the only two sources he cited are far from convincing. The name Chalcidian League is an invention of modern historians; ancient writers referred to the alliance as \"Chalcidice\", \"the Chalcidians (of Thrace)\" or simply to \"the Olynthians\", as Olynthos was the leading city, without naming the member cities, thus lumping the territories of the Halkidiki peninsula together.\n\nBoth the geographer Strabo (Î£ÏÏÎ¬Î²ÏÎ½, 64/63 BC â circa 24 AD) and the orator Dio Chrysostom (ÎÎ¯ÏÎ½ Î§ÏÏ ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Î¼Î¿Ï, circa 40-120 AD) lived over 300 years after the demise of the League. Strabo states merely that Stageira \"belongs to the Chalcidians\". Dio Chrysostom claimed \"Stageira was a village in the territory of Olynthus\", but this is hardly evidence that it joined the League, at least not before the Peace of Nikias of 421 BC. It may have been forced to join the league some time before 383 BC (see note 30 on Xenophon below).\n\nStrabo, The Geography, Book 7, fragments, 1a - 60, edited by H. L. Jones. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass.; William Heinemann Ltd, London. 1924. At Perseus Digital Library.\n\nDio Chrysostom, Discourses, 7, section 9. Translated by J. W. Cohoon and H. Lamar Crosby. Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, 1946. At Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius: Into the Roman World, University of Chicago.\n\nAs for the lack of evidence of coins minted by Stageira at the end of the Classical period, there seems to be no evidence either that it used Olynthian coinage. During the time of the Delian League it may have used Athenian coinage following its imposition by decree in the 420s BC:\n\n\"The secretary of the [Athenian] council shall for the future add the following to the councilâs oath:\n\n'If anyone mints silver coinage in the cities, and does not use Athenian coinage, weights and measures but uses foreign coinage, measures and weights, I shall punish and penalise him in accordance with the earlier decree proposed by Clearchus.'\"\n\nR. Meiggs, and D. M. Lewis, A selection of Greek historical inscriptions to the end of the fifth century BC, 45, section 12. Oxford University Press, 1988.\n\n27. Thucydides on Brasidas and the Halkidiki revolt, 424 BC\n\n\"Such were the words of Brasidas. The Acanthians, after much had been said on both sides of the question, gave their votes in secret, and the majority, influenced by the seductive arguments of Brasidas and by fear for their fruit, decided to revolt from Athens; not however admitting the army until they had taken his personal security for the oaths sworn by his government before they sent him out, assuring the independence of the allies whom he might bring over. Not long after, Stagirus, a colony of the Andrians, followed their example and revolted. Such were the events of this summer.\"\n\nThucydides, Book 4, chapter 14.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, Brasidas was also honoured by the citizens of Akanthos.\n\n\"The treasury of the Acanthians at Delphi bears this inscription: 'Brasidas and the Acanthians, with spoil from the Athenians.'â For this reason many think that the marble figure standing within the edifice, by the door, is a statue of Brasidas. But it really represents Lysander...\"\n\n\"Out of the spoils, Lysander set up at Delphi bronze statues of himself and each of his admirals, as well as golden stars of the Dioscuri, which disappeared before the battle of Leuctra [an omen of the Spartans defeat in the battle, 371 BC]. And in the treasury of Brasidas and the Acanthiansâ there was stored a trireme two cubits long [90 cm], made of gold and ivory, which Cyrus sent Lysander as a prize for his victory.\"\n\nPlutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Lysander, chapters 1 and 18. At Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius website.\n\nAccording to a passage in the Varia Historia (Various History) of the Roman writer Aelian, the Athenian philosopher Socrates (Î£ÏÎºÏá¾°ÌÏÎ·Ï, circa 470-399 BC) fought at Amphipolis and Potidaia.\n\n\"But Socrates would not meddle with the Athenian State, because the Democracy of the Athenians did at that time more resemble a Tyrannical and Monarchick Government. Neither would he joyn in sentencing the ten Commanders to death, nor partake of the injustices committed by the thirty Tyrants. But when occasion called him forth, he was a Souldier. He fought at Delium, and at Amphipolis and Potidea.\"\n\nClaudius Aelianus, His Various History, Book 3, chapter 17. Translated by Thomas Stanley. Thomas Dring, London, 1665. At James Eason's website, University of Chicago.\n\n28. Thucydides on Cleon's siege of Stageira,\n\n422 BC\n\n\"Cleon, whom we left on his voyage from Torone to Amphipolis, made Eion his base, and after an unsuccessful assault upon the Andrian colony of Stagirus, took Galepsus, a colony of Thasos, by storm.\"\n\nThucydides, Book 5, chapter 15.\n\n29. Thucydides on the Peace of Nikias, 421 BC\n\n\"This arranged, the Lacedaemonians summoned their allies, and all voting for peace except the Boeotians, Corinthians, Eleans, and Megarians, who did not approve of these proceedings, they concluded the treaty and made peace, each of the contracting parties swearing to the following articles:\n\nThe Athenians and Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty, and swore to it, city by city, as follows:\"\n\n. . .\n\n\"5. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back Amphipolis to the Athenians. Nevertheless, in the case of cities given up by the Lacedaemonians to the Athenians, the inhabitants shall be allowed to go where they please and to take their property with them: and the cities shall be independent, paying only the tribute of Aristides. And it shall not be lawful for the Athenians or their allies to carry on war against them after the treaty has been concluded, so long as the tribute is paid. The cities referred to are Argilus, Stagirus, Acanthus, Scolus, Olynthus, and Spartolus. These cities shall be neutral, allies neither of the Lacedaemonians nor of the Athenians: but if the cities consent, it shall be lawful for the Athenians to make them their allies, provided always that the cities wish it. The Mecybernaeans, Sanaeans, and Singaeans shall inhabit their own cities, as also the Olynthians and Acanthians: but the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back Panactum to the Athenians.\"\n\nThucydides, Book 5, chapter 15."
