I was two thirds done making my list last year when I fell asleep and when I awoke all my work was gone. Soooooo, I abandoned it and never shared a list last year.\n\nTo make up for it, you get two, maybe, this year.\n\nI'll give you all the best of the beast that I am and share my top ten Maco Shield Coins\n\nI may share my next top ten in order of favorites, but you wouldn't ask a papa to rank his children would you!?!\n\nAnd MSCs are just that to me. So, you'll see they are ranked oldest that we can tell to new(ish)est\n\nA no brainer really. Strong strike, even if a bit off, fun patina and of course there fact that it has the club and bowcase clearly connects it to the also really available Macedonian Herakles obverse coins with the same iconography on their reverse:\n\nAlexander III 'the Great'\n\n336-323 BC Ae.

Ex: Ares numismatics\n\nYeah, that is a three quarters looking at you Herakles. It is VERY hard to get this type and be able to tell what is on thre shield boss (center of shield) if you haven't seen it before:\n\nMacedonian Kingdom. Anonymous issues.\n\nCa. 323-310 B.C. AE half unit (17 mm, 3.93 g, 1 h). Uncertain mint in Western Asia Minor.

Rare Variety.\n\nFormer Savoca\n\nNear perfect Gorgon, black as the night on a moonless night with just a few speckles of earth. I blush thinking how cheap this went\n\nhttps://www.cointalk.com/threads/my...-three-latest-deliveries.366022/#post-4835413\n\nAntigonos I Monophthalmos\n\nAs king, 306/5-301 BC.
