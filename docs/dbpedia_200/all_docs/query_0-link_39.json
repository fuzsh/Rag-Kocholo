        "text": "Citation preview\n\nMAKED ONIA m . b . h at zo p o u l o s (with the collaboration of Paschalis Paschidis)\n\nI. The Region The name of the region is Μακεδονα, -η (Hdt. 5.17.1; Thuc. 1.58.1; Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 1.B9). It is derived from the ethnic Μακεδ)ν (Hdt. 5.18.2; Thuc. 1.57.2; IG i³ 89.26), in the Thessalian dialect Μακετον (SEG 27 202.10); the feminine form is normally Μακ/τα (IG ii² 9258 (C3)). As Makedonia is simply the land of the Makedones, its extent followed Makedonian expansion. By the time of Alexander’s accession, it ranged from the foothills of the Pierian mountains to the whole region between Mt. Pindos and the Strymon valley, and between the Peneios and roughly the present Greek frontier. To the south Makedonia bordered on Thessaly. Its southernmost cities were, from east to west, Herakleion and Balla in Pieria,Aiane in Elemia,Aiginion in Tymphaia. To the west it bordered on Epeiros, and its westernmost city was Argos Orestikon in Orestis. To the north-west it bordered on Illyria, and its north-westernmost city was Herakleia in Lynkos. To the north of Makedonia lay Paionia (including Pelagonia). The northernmost Makedonian cities, from west to east, were Styberra in Derriopos, Idomene in Parorbelia, and Herakleia in Sintike. To the east Makedonia bordered on Thrace and, until the annexation of the plain of Philippoi in late Hellenistic times, its easternmost cities, from north to south, were Serrhai in Odomantike, the Bisaltic Pentapolis, and Amphipolis in Edonis. In Roman times, Makedonia reached the Nestos valley in the east and encompassed Pelagonia and Paionia as far north as Mt. Golesni˘ca. The Makedonian expansion was a gradual process, but the strongest impetus both to conquest and to colonisation was given by Philip II (360–336), who also systematically divided Makedonia into self-governing cities, each with its civic territory, and into administrative districts (see Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 167–260). For practical reasons, the “greater Makedonia” of the reign of Philip II and his Temenid and Antigonid successors has been subdivided into (a) a western part comprising the Old Kingdom, cradle of\n\nthe Makedonian power, and Upper Makedonia—that is to say all Makedonian territories west of the Axios—and (b) an eastern part consisting of the new territories between the Axios and the plain of Philippoi, which were incorporated into Makedonia proper by Philip II and his successors. The former areas had been almost entirely settled by Makedonians (who had subjected and mostly driven out or exterminated the indigenous populations), at least since the end of the Archaic period, whereas the latter were colonised in later times, and their former inhabitants had in most cases been permitted to remain in their old homes. Both of these parts, however, were integrated into a uniﬁed state, the citizens of which shared the same politeia and formed τν . . . χ)ραν τν Μακεδ#νων (SEG 12 374.6), Makedonia proper, as opposed to the external possessions of the Makedonian kings south of the Peneios, Mt. Olympos and the Kambounian mountains, west of Mt. Pindos and Lake Lychnitis, north of the present Greek frontier and east of the Strymon valley. The “greater Makedonia” created by Philip II was subdivided into four administrative districts called ethne in our sources: from west to east, Upper Makedonia (between Mt. Pindos and Mt. Bermion), Bottia (between Mt. Bermion and the Axios), Amphaxitis (between the Axios and modern Mt. Bertiskos) and Paroreia and Parastrymonia, also known as the First Meris (between Mt. Bertiskos and the plain of Philippoi). Within these large administrative districts subsisted older regional names, often derived from the ethnika of their actual or former inhabitants: Elemia, Orestis, Tymphaia-Parauaia, Lynkos, Derriopos in Upper Makedonia; Pieria, Bottia (or Emathia), Almopia in the administrative district of Bottia; Mygdonia, Krestonia, Parorbelia, Bottike, Chalkidike, Anthemous, Krousis in Amphaxitis; Sintike, Odomantike, Bisaltia, Edonis, Pieris in the First Meris. Eordaia, although geographically part of Upper Makedonia, was considered from the political point of view as being part of Bottia since it had always belonged to the Temenid kingdom.\n\nmakedonia The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally for the ﬁrst time in the C5l treaty between Perdikkas II and Athens (IG i³ 89.26) and internally in the C4l list of priests of Asklepios from Kalindoia (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 62.6) and in the dedication of Kassandros from Dion, also C4l (ibid. no. 23). For the oldest individual and external use, see, perhaps, IG i³ 422.i.79–80 (414/13) (a slave) and SEG 34 355.4–6 (365). As expected, we ﬁnd no individual and internal use, since for a Makedonian within Makedonia the ethnic Μακεδ)ν would normally be superﬂuous. The region Makedonia is described by the term χ)ρα -η (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 1.A6 (C4e, restored) and 58.6 (243). If not from C5l (Thuc. 2.99.6, implicitly), from C4f onwards the term θνος is used for the people (Ps.-Skylax 66). Makedonia attracted the interest of city-state writers and developed an indigenous literary tradition only from the reign of Philip II onwards, when it became the dominant power in Greek politics. For this reason, evidence about Makedonian cities is relatively late, although by then urban settlements already had a long history in the area. Thus, many cities attested for the ﬁrst time in the Hellenistic period most probably existed in the previous period too. Since the rules set down for the present project stipulate that only cities attested as such in the Archaic and Classical periods should be included in the Inventory, cities ﬁrst appearing in Hellenistic times have been separated from the rest and are listed below along with other doubtful cases. On the other hand, toponyms which have been erroneously regarded as denoting cities by ancient authors or modern scholars have been entirely omitted; the same applies to settlements (mostly villages) ﬁrst attested in Roman times, or which are mere lexicographical entries without indication of their— even approximate—location and/or date, although many of them, as their dialectal forms show, surely existed in earlier periods. A special problem arises from urban settlements in Upper Makedonia, particularly Aiane in Elemia, Bokeria in Eordaia, and Herakleia in Lynkos, which are sometimes actually described, expressis verbis, as poleis. From the administrative point of view, however, the equivalent of the Lower Makedonian poleis was not the urban settlement but each of the Upper Makedonian ethne such as the Orestai or the Elemiotai, comprising both cities and villages. After some hesitation, I have decided to include Aiane, for which there is enough evidence to allow it to qualify as a polis type C, but to exclude Bokeria and Herakleia from the Inventory itself and instead to list them with the other non-polis settlements.\n\n795\n\nFinally, I have decided not to consider unidentiﬁed ancient settlements. Makedonia is a vast country which has not been surveyed methodically. We know of many trapezai, which are a certain sign of a settlement in historical times. However, the absence of systematic investigation does not allow us to date these settlements precisely, even less to determine their status. A random inclusion of such cases would only contribute to creating an inexact image of the settlement pattern without enhancing our understanding of the polis phenomenon in Makedonia. In Makedonia west of the Axios I have counted forty-two settlements attested either in Archaic and Classical or in Hellenistic times but which can most probably be dated to earlier periods: Agassai, Aiane, Aigeai, Aiginion in Pieria, Aiginion in Tymphaia, Alebaia, Alkomena, Allante, Aloros, Argos Orestikon, Arnisa, Balla, Beroia, Bokeria, Bryanion, Dion, Edessa, Euia, Europos, Gaimeion, Galadrai, Genderrhos, Gortynia, Greia, Herakleia Lynkou, Herakleion, Ichnai, Keletron, Kyrrhos, Leibethra, Marinia, Methone, Mieza, Nea[---], Pella, Petra, Phylakai, Pimpleia, Pydna, Skydra, Styberra and Tyrissa. Of these, ﬁve almost certainly (Gaimeion, Genderrhos, Greia, Nea[---] and Pimpleia) and one most probably (Arnisa) did not enjoy polis status. Of the remaining thirty-six, only seventeen (those in italics) can be positively dated to the preHellenistic period and qualify certainly (type A), probably (type B), or possibly (type C) as poleis and are described in the Inventory below. Two (Bokeria and Herakleia) were, probably, the principal town in a whole region. The remaining seventeen settlements, which are ﬁrst attested in the Hellenistic period, along with the six villages mentioned above, are listed here in alphabetical order. The principal towns in Eordaia (Bokeria) and Lynkos (Herakleia) have been given a somewhat fuller treatment than the others.\n\n1. Pre-Hellenistic Settlements not Attested as Poleis *Agassai (Agassae, ?κεσα?) Livy 44.7.5, 45.27.1 (urbs); Steph. Byz. 59.3 (π#λις); ethnikon: ?κεσα5ος or ?κεστης? (Steph.

Barr. 50, H. *Aiginion (Aeginium) Livy 44.46.3 (oppidum) and 45.27.1–3 (urbs); Plin. HN 4.33; unidentiﬁed location, somewhere in Pieria (Papazoglou (1988) 119–20). Barr. 50, R.\n\n796\n\nhatzopoulos and paschidis\n\nAiginion (Α2γνιον) Livy 32.15.4, 36.13.6; Strabo 7.7.9; Gonnoi no. 35B.6 (δ8µος (C2m)); cf. IG ix.2 324 (π#λις), 329 (π#λις (c.ad 200, when it was no longer part of Makedonia, but belonged to Thessaly)). Capital of Tymphaia-Parauaia. Gonnoi pp. 35–36. Barr. 54, H.

At Bu˘cin near Bela Cerkva in Derriopos. Papazoglou (1988) 302–3; Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 85–87, 411–16). Alkomena was apparently one of the urban centres of Derriopos, which as a whole constituted a political entity (cf. SEG 46 807: .ν ∆ερρι#πω . . . βουλευτριον). Barr. 49, HR. Argos Orestikon (Xργος ’Ορεστικ#ν) Strabo 7.7.8 (π#λις); App. Syr. 63; Steph. Byz. 113.1 (π#λις); ethnikon: ?ργεστα5ος (Livy 27.33.1 (Argestaeum campum)).

Possibly at Palaiogratsianon in Pieria (Papazoglou (1988) 120–22; Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 109–10 and (2003)). Undated and unlocated in Barr. 50. Bokeria (Βοκερα) EAM 109 (C4/C3, stadium stone); ethnikon: Βοκ/ρριος (AG 9.149; Papazoglou (1988) 164–66 and J. and L. Robert, BE (1971) no. 392 mistakenly write Βοκκ/ριος) or Βοκερρα5ος (Bocerraeus, in an unpublished boundary stone of the Roman period; cf. BE (1997) 364). At Pharangi in Eordaia (cf. Petsas (1966–67) 351, no. 245; Mackay (1976)); probable remnants of a circuit wall (Hammond and Hatzopoulos (1982) 143). Bokeria was the principal urban centre of the ethnos of the Eordaioi, who as a whole constituted a political unit equivalent to the poleis of coastal Makedonia (cf. the βουλ ’Εορ[δαων] of the Roman period in SEG 48 800). Barr. 50, HR. Bryanion (Βρυνιον) Livy 31.39.5; Strabo 7.7.9 (π#λις). Unidentiﬁed location in Derriopos (Papazoglou (1988) 303). Barr. 49 (Grai˘ste?), CHR.

At Polymylos in Elemia or Eordaia (I.Beroia 41 with comm.; Karamitrou-Mentesidi and Vatali (1997)). Barr. 50 (Euboia at Sevastiana?), L. Gaimeion (Γαµειον) SEG 24 524.B21, 35 (C3). Unidentiﬁed location, probably in Bottia (Papazoglou (1988) 150). Not in Barr. Galadrai (Γαλδρα, Γαλδραι) Lycoph. Alex. 1444; Polyb. book 13, apud Steph.

Unidentiﬁed location near Kyrrhos in Bottia, possibly at Mandalon (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 112). Barr. 50 tentatively puts it at Mylotopos (following Papazoglou (1988) 154) but indicates no date. Gortynia (Γορτυνα) Thuc. 2.100.3; Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36 (π#λις); Plin. HN 4.34; Strabo 7 fr. 4 (π#λις); Steph. Byz. 212.1. Perhaps located at Vardarski Rid, near Gevgelija, where recent excavations have revealed several building phases of a walled settlement; most important are the C6–C5e and the C5m–C4 phases, the latter with remains of a monumental public building (Mitrevski (1996)). Papazoglou (1988) 181–82. Barr. 50, CHRL. Greia (Γρια) EAM 87 (181–180). Kome of Eordaia or Elemia (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 96–102). Undated in Barr. 50.

Near Bitola in Lynkestis. Not Herakleia alone, but the ethnos of the Lynkestai as a whole constituted a political unit equivalent to the poleis of Lower Makedonia. For the evidence from the Roman period, see Papazoglou (1988) 259–68, Mikul˘ci˘c (1974) 199–202, Gounaropoulou and Hatzopoulos (1985) 14–22 and IG x.2.2 pp. 29–74. Barr. 49, CHRL. *Keletron (Celetrum) Livy 31.40.1 (r199) (oppidum). At Kastoria in Orestis (Papazoglou (1988) 238). Barr. 49, HRL. *Marinia (Μαρινια5ος) SEG 24 524 (C3). At Marina in Bottia (Petsas (1961) 49–55). Not in Barr. Nea[---] (Νεα[---]) SEG 24 524 (C3). Unknown location in Bottia, probably a kome of Mieza. Not in Barr.\n\nmakedonia *Petra (Petra) Livy 39.26.1, 44.32.9, 45.41.4. At modern Petra in Pieria. (Papazoglou (1988) 116–17). Barr. 50, HRL. Phylakai (Φυλακα) Ptol. Geog. 3.12.37 (cf. 17: π#λις); ethnikon: Φυλακα5ος (I.Beroia 140 (C3/C2)), Phylacaeus (Plin. HN 4.34). Possibly at Moschopotamos, in Pieria (Papazoglou (1988) 120; Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 109–10). Undated and unlocated in Barr. 50. Pimpleia (Πµπλεια) Callim. Hymn 4.7; Posidippus 118; Strabo 7 frf. 17 and 18 (κ)µη of Dion). Possibly at Ag. Paraskevi near Litochoron, in Pieria (Schmidt (1950); Papazoglou (1988) 112). Barr. 50, HR. Skydra (Σκδρα) Theagenes (FGrHist 774) fr. 13 apud Steph. Byz. 578.8 (π#λις); Plin. HN 4.34 (civitas); Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36 (cf. 17: π#λις); SEG 24 530 (third century ad); ethnikon: Σκυδρα5ος (SEG 24 524 (C3)). At Arseni in Bottia (Petsas (1961) 44–48). Barr. 50 (Loutrokhoroi?), HR. Styberra (Στβερρα) Polyb. 28.8.8; Strabo 7.7.9 (π#λις); Livy 31.39.4; IG x.2.2 323–28, 330 (π#λις) (all from the Imperial period); ethnikon: Στυβερρα5ος (IGBulg v 5003 (C2/C1)). At Cˇepigovo in Derriopos (Papazoglou (1988) 298–302). Barr. 49, HRL. Tyrissa (Τρισσα) Plin. HN 4.34 (Tyrissaei); Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36 (cf. 17: π#λις). Most probably at Pentaplanos in Pieria. If the ﬁve tagoi recorded in a C2e deed of sale found at Asvestario, 6 km to the north of Pentaplanos (SEG 47 999) are the supreme magistrates of Tyrissa and not of Pella, Tyrissa was a polis in the Hellenistic period (Papazoglou (1988) 158–59; P. Chrysostomou (1997); BE (1999) 349). Not in Barr. Of the twenty-ﬁve settlements listed above, three (Alebaia, Genderrhos, Pimpleia) are described expressis verbis in our sources as komai. In any case, all settlements in Upper Makedonia (including Eordaia), even when these are called poleis, did not enjoy the full prerogatives of the cities of Lower Makedonia, for these were reserved for the territorial units called ethne in our sources, which included both cities and villages, called politeiai in our sources of the Roman period. Examples of other such Upper Makedonian settlements are Aiginion in Tymphaia, Alkomena, Bryanion and Styberra in Derriopos, Argos Orestikon and Keletron in Orestis, Euia and Greia in Elemia or Eordaia. Of the remaining nine, Agassai and Aiginion are called urbes in Hellenistic times, and Tyrissa seems to have had its own magistrates in the same period. They most probably had inherited this status from the previous period. The same is true of Balla,\n\n797\n\nmentioned by the C3 writer Theagenes referring to an event that probably took place in the reign of Philip II. Galadrai is mentioned by Lykophron in the early Hellenistic period. Its presence in the work of Polybios guarantees that it was not a mythological invention. Its existence in Classical times is possible and even probable. We should have even fewer doubts concerning Marinia and Skydra, the ethnika of which ﬁgure in a C3 register of sales. Phylakai, too, the ethnikon of which appears in an Early Hellenistic agonistic catalogue, was most probably a city in the previous period. Such favourable indications are lacking in the case of Gaimeion and Nea[---], probably a small place, and also of Petra, the site of which can hardly “contain more than thirty little houses” (Heuzey (1860) 147). To conclude, at least eight more poleis (Agassai, Aiginion, Balla, Galadrai, Marinia, Skydra, Phylakai and Tyrissa) should probably be added to the seventeen listed in the following Inventory.\n\nII. The Poleis 528. Aiane (Aianaios?) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.10, long. 21.50. Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Α2αν, ! (EAM 47; Steph. Byz. 37.7; later spelt ’Εαν (EAM 15)); possibly Aeane in Livy 43.21.5 (Megas (1976)). The city-ethnic Α2ανα5ος is given by Steph. Byz. 37.9. Aiane is called a polis in the political sense in EAM 15, which dates from the second century ad. The ethnic is attested only by Steph. Byz., but there is no reason to doubt its authenticity. Although Aiane, as the recent excavations at Megale Rachi have shown, was the capital of the kings of Elemia from Archaic times, it is not mentioned in the surviving historical works with the possible exception of Livy 43.21.5 in connection with the ﬁrst military operations of the Third Makedonian War (Megas (1976)). The three monumental buildings discovered on the top and on the slopes of the acropolis, one of which is certainly a portico belonging to an agora complex, as well as the urban planning of the residential area, show that Aiane had the external aspect of a polis from C6l, to which the oldest of these buildings belong (Karamitrou-Mentesidi (1993), (1994), (1996a) 16–32, (1996b) 25–29). The power of the Elemiote kings, which in the C4e equalled that of the Temenids of Lower Makedonia, goes a long way to explain the early promotion of their residence to a full-blown city comparable to Aigeai. After the annexation of Upper\n\n798\n\nhatzopoulos and paschidis\n\nMakedonia to the Temenid kingdom and its reorganisation by Philip II, Aiane remained the capital of Elemia, although from the administrative point of view not Aiane alone but the whole of Elemia with its other towns and villages constituted a political unit equal to the poleis of Lower Makedonia (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. 89–91). At Aiane probably were struck the bronze coins of King Derdas in the C4e. Types: obv. galloping horseman, or youthful Apollo, or youthful Herakles; rev. club and spearhead, or galloping horseman; legend: ∆ΕΡ∆Α, ∆ΕΡ∆ΑΙΟΝ (Liampi (1998)). 529. Aigeai (Aigaios) Map 50. Lat. 40.30, long. 22.15. Size of territory: 2. Type: A. The toponym is Α2γεα, αH (IG iv 617.15) or Α2γ/αι (Diod. 16.92.1) or Α2γα5αι (Diyllos (FGrHist 73) fr. 1) or Α2γαια (Diod. 19.52.5; I.Leukopetra 103) or Α2γα (Diod. 16.3.5) or Α2γεια (Theophr. fr. 5.27; Syll.³ 269L) or Α2γαα (Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36). The city-ethnic is Α2γα5ος (Plut. Pyrrh. 26.11; IG xii.8 206.12 (C1l)), later spelled ’Εγ/ος (I.Leukopetra 73 (ad 229)). Aigeai is called a polis in the urban sense by Euphorion fr. 33, van Groningen (rC7) and Plut. Pyrrh. 26.11 (r274). A combined description of the urban and political aspects of the community is found in the phrase >στυ κτζε π#ληος (where asty is Aigeai and the polis is the Makedonian state), referring to the foundation of Aigeai in C7 and attested in a Delphic oracle of c.500 (Diod. 7.16; for the date see Hatzopoulos (1996b) 464–65). The epithet µηλοβ#τειρα shows that the toponym was used for the territory as well as for the urban centre (Steph. Byz. 39.1; cf. Just. 7.1.10). The political sense is implicit in the designation of Makedonians as belonging to the citizen body of Aigeai (cf. Syll.³ 269L and I.Magnesia 10.11–12: Α2σχρων ?µ[]ντα Μακε[δVν .ξ] Α2γε+ν (C3); for the date, see Gauthier, Prakt (1984) 98). The earliest attestation of the individual use of the city-ethnic occurs in IG xii.8 206.12 (C1l), but in Plut. Alex. 41.9 a C4 Makedonian citizen is called Ε(ρλοχος Α2γα5ος. The territory of Aigeai bordered on that of Beroia to the west and Aloros to the east. The marshes of the mouth of the Haliakmon formed its northern limit, and the heights of the Pierians its southern one. Thus it extended over c.12.5 km from the gorges of the Haliakmon to the river-bed of the Krasopoulis, and over c.5 km of arable territory between the mountain and the marshes (62.5 km²). The territory of Aigeai comprised several minor settlements, of which only one has been identiﬁed: Blaganoi (Hatzopoulos (1987a), (1990) 59–60). Although situated on the right bank of the Haliakmon, Aigeai did not belong to Pieria, but, just like\n\nAloros, to Bottia (Diod. 7.16) or Emathia (Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36), as this region was called in later times (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 239–47, (1996a)). According to its foundation legend, Aigeai was originally a Phrygian (Brygian) city called Edessa, and the name Aigeai was ﬁrst given to it by its Greek Makedonian conquerors (Euphorion fr. 33, van Groningen; Just. 7.1.10 (rC7)). From then on it was the Temenid capital, and it remained a part-time royal residence even after the transfer of the usual residence to Pella under King Amyntas III (Hatzopoulos (1987b)); in particular, it retained its character of royal cemetery at least until the end of the Temenid dynasty. Citizens of Aigeai are known to have been proxenoi of several cities: Delphi (no. 177) (Syll.³ 269L (c.300 or 272)), Histiaia (no. 372) (IG xii.9 1187.30 (c.266)) and Magnesia on the Maiandros (no. 852), where the recipient also received citizenship (I.Magnesia 10 (C3)). Aigeai does not appear in the list of the theorodokoi of Nemea (in 323), but its name can be safely restored on the Argive list of contributors (IG iv 617.15 (c.300)), which could be a reference to theoroi (cf. Perlman (2000) 74). Its main deities were Zeus (Arr. Anab. 1.11.1) and Herakles Patroos (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 30). Eukleia (SaatsoglouPaliadeli (1987), (1992)) and the Mother of the Gods (Drougou (1996)) were also popular. Excavations at Vergina-Palatitsia, begun by L. Heuzey in the middle of the nineteenth century and continued since by C. Romaios, and by M. Andronicos and his students, have unearthed, besides the extensive cemetery (Kottaridi (2002)), two palaces, a theatre, an agora, several sanctuaries and other facilities. The great palace (104.5 ⫻ 88.5 m), built around a peristyle court, with porticoes on the north and east sides, an extended balcony beyond the north portico and a monumental gate on the east side, belongs to the C4s, but the smaller one, to the west, seems to be earlier and may be the very structure decorated by Zeuxis in C5l (Andronicos (1984) 38–46; Ginouvès (1993) 84–88; Saatsoglou-Paliadeli (2001)). The C4s theatre (TGR ii. 317) lay immediately to the north of the palace. Stone benches rose only to the second row (Drougou (1997)). The theatre is mentioned by Diodorus in his account of the murder of Philip in 336 (Diod. 16.92.5ff). The agora of the city lay to the north of the theatre; it comprised the C4m temple dedicated to Eukleia (Saatsoglou-Paliadeli (1996)). To the northeast of the palace a sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods was discovered, the earliest building phase of which belongs to C4l (Drougou (1996)).\n\nmakedonia On the acropolis, south of the palace, which dominated the city, no major public buildings have been found (Phaklaris (1996) 70–74). The C4l circuit wall roughly forms a triangle, with its apex to the south on the acropolis and its base on a line joining the two streams on either side of the acropolis hill probably to the south of the Rhomaios tomb. It is a pseudo-isodomic structure of local stone with towers at irregular intervals. Monumental gates opened from the acropolis to the south, towards Pieria, to the north towards the city, and west of the theatre towards Upper Makedonia (Andronicos et al. (1983) 42–45, (1987) 146–48; Phaklaris (1996) 69–70). According to legend, Aigeai was founded by the Temenid Perdikkas or Karanos or Archelaos, alone or with an army of Argive colonists in the C7m or C8e (Hammond and Grifﬁth (1979) 3–14). 530. Alebaia Map 50. Unlocated (but see Hatzopoulos (2003) for a possible identiﬁcation with Bravas). Type: A (rC7). The toponym is Λεβαη, ! (Hdt. 8.137.1) ?λ(α)ιβα5οι (sc. τ#ποι) (I.Leukopetra 12.4 (ad 171/2)), ?λεβα (κ)µη: I.Leukopetra 106.14 (ad 253/4)). The cityethnic is unattested but was presumably ?λεβα5ος (I.Leukopetra 12.4). Alebaia is called a polis, in the urban sense, exclusively in Hdt. 8.137.1, in the mythical context of the foundation of the Makedonian state by the Temenids. It is not clear whether Herodotos is considering (A)lebaia to be a polis in his own time or only in the C7, when the legend he narrates is dated. It is clear, however, that by the Roman period (A)lebaia was not an independent polis but a kome of Elemia, and it is probable that even earlier not (A)lebaia alone but the whole ethnos of the Elemiotai constituted a political unit equivalent to the poleis of Lower Makedonia. 531. Allante (Allantaios) Map 50. Lat. 40.45, long. 22.35. (Allante was most probably situated at Nea Chalkedon (Gounaropoulou and Hatzopoulos (1985) 56–61). Military action during the First World War and the construction of a modern settlement after 1922 have destroyed practically all ancient remains.) Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is ?ταλντη, ! (Thuc. 2.100.3) or ?λλντειον, τ# (Theopomp. fr. 33; BCH 45 (1921) 17 iii.64 (230–220)) or ?λντη (SEG 36 331B.21) or ?λλντη (Steph. Byz. 76.1). The city-ethnic is [?ταλα]- vel [?λλα]-ντα5ος (IG iv 617.17 (C4l); ?λλαντα5ος SEG 35 753.12 (c.ad 198)); Steph. Byz. 76.3 suggests ?λλντιος; Pliny’s Allantenses (HN 4.35) is not helpful. The only classiﬁcation in literary sources of Allante as a polis is in Steph. Byz. 76.1. The only epigraphic attestation of a π#λις ?λλανταων is on a c.ad 198 milestone from\n\n799\n\nAllante (SEG 35 753.12), where the term polis is used in the political sense. Allante is called a chorion in Thuc. 2.100.3. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested both internally (SEG 35 753.12) and externally (IG iv 617.17). The territory of Allante bordered on that of Pella to the north-west, Ichnai to the north and Herakleia to the east, across the Axios; to the south it reached the ancient shoreline. Allante was probably a C5e Makedonian foundation designed to cut off the then Paionian city of Ichnai from the sea (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 111). Allantaian theorodokoi were appointed to host theoroi from Nemea (SEG 36 331.B.21 (331/30–313)). If the ethnic is correctly restored in IG iv 617.17, Allante is recorded on the Argive list of contributors of C4l, which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi (cf. Perlman (2000) 74). 532. Aloros (Alorites) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.35, long. 22.30. Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Xλωρος, ! (Ps.Skylax 66; Strabo 7 fr. 20), and the city-ethnic ?λωρτης (Diod. 15.71.1). Aloros is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 66 (C4m). The individual use of the ethnic is attested externally in Diod. 15.71.1 (r368) and Arr. Ind. 18.6 (r320s). The territory of Aloros bordered on that of Aigeai to the west and Methone to the south, while to the north it must have been delimited by the marshes of Lake Loudiake. Traces of a circuit wall of poros blocks c.1 km long have been spotted (Hatzopoulos (1987b) 38). Excavations begun in 1988 (Apostolou (1998)) have revealed a C4 two-room building, probably a temple, with an adjoining Archaic structure, probably an altar (Apostolou (1991)). 533. Beroia (Beroiaios) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.30; long. 22.10. Size of territory: 4. Type: A. The toponym is Β/ροια, ! (Thuc. 1.61.4), later spelled Β/ρροια (App. Syr. 57 and late Roman sources). The city-ethnic is Βεροια5ος (unpublished C4s inscription from the Perrhaibian tripolis; Polyb. 28.8.2); Βεροι˜εος in I.Leukopetra 31.5; Βαιροια5ος in I.Leukopetra 84.4–5 or Βεροιες (Polyb. 27.8.6); Βερωα5ος (IG iv².1 96.22) is probably a mistake. Beroia is ﬁrst attested as a polis in the political sense in a C4l dedication (I.Beroia 29 ⫽Hatzopoulos (1996b) no. 73) and is called a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skymnos 626 (C2). The term chorion is used by Thuc. 1.61.4, and the term polisma by App. Syr. 57. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an honoriﬁc inscription (I.Beroia 59 (C1)). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a consecration from the sanctuary of Leukopetra (I.Leukopetra 31.5 (ad 192/3)) and externally in an unpublished dedication from\n\n800\n\nhatzopoulos and paschidis\n\nthe Perrhaibian Tripolis (cf. Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 156, n. 15 (C4s)) and in a C3f Epidaurian list of theorodokoi (IG iv².1 96.22). The territory of Beroia bordered on that of Mieza to the north, Pella to the north-east, Aigeai to the south-east and on the regions of Eordaia to the north-west and Elemia to the south-west. Among the secondary settlements of the original territory of Beroia, we know the names of Kyneoi, Auranton, Kannonea and Droga (Hatzopoulos (1990)). The constitution of Beroia, like the constitution of all the cities of Makedonia, had a pronounced aristocratic character. Not only slaves, but also freedmen, their sons, male prostitutes and craftsmen were excluded from civic life (Gauthier and Hatzopoulos (1993) 78–87), and full enfranchisement probably was subject to a minimum census in landed property (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 209 n. 1). The chief executive ofﬁcial was the epistates (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 73), who—at least later—was assisted by a board of magistrates who may have been called tagoi (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 156). The patron deity of Beroia was Herakles Kynagidas, who was revered as the ancestor of the royal family—not only of the Temenids, but also later of the Antigonids (Edson (1934) 226–32; Allamani-Souri (1993b); Hatzopoulos (1994a) 102–11). The cult of Asklepios was also important (Voutiras (1993) 257), and his priest was eponymous, as in all Makedonian cities (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 152–54). His cult was, at least later, associated with those of Apollo and Hygieia (I.Beroia 16 (C3s)). The cult of Dionysos was an ancient one (cf. the epistylion of the theatre bearing a dedication to the god, I.Beroia 21 (C4l)); with the epithets Agrios, Erikryptos, Pseudanor it is attested only in Imperial times, but, given its archaic character, it certainly had much earlier origins (Hatzopoulos (1994a) 65–85). From the Hellenistic period are attested cults of Athena (I.Beroia 17), Ennodia (I.Beroia 23), Hermes (I.Beroia 24), Pan (I.Beroia 37) and Atargatis (I.Beroia 19). Beroia is recorded on the Argive list of contributors (IG iv 617.17 (C4l)), which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi (cf. Perlman (2000) 74). The failure of the Athenians to capture Beroia in 432 (Thuc. 1.61.4) probably implies that at least part of the city, such as the acropolis situated in the western extremity, was already fortiﬁed. Traces of a C4l circuit wall made of local poros have been discovered in different parts of the modern town (Petkos (1997) 272). There were at least three gates, one of which bore the name Ε(ιαστικ (I.Beroia 41; cf. BrocasDeﬂassieux (1999) 37–41). The continuous habitation of the site from the Iron Age to the present (cf. Allamani-Souri\n\n(1993a); Allamani-Souri and Apostolou (1992) 97) have left very few traces of the ancient town plan. It is presumed that the ancient agora and main road axes correspond to the modern civic centre and road system (Brocas-Deﬂassieux (1999) 99–101). The stadion has been located in the eastern outskirts of the city. Epigraphic ﬁnds have permitted the location of the gymnasion—ﬁrst attested in the Hellenistic period—in the same area south of the stadion (BrocasDeﬂassieux (1999) 87–90). A late Classical or early Hellenistic epistylion with a dedication to Dionysos (I.Beroia 21) provides evidence for the functioning of the theatre in that period. 534. Dion (Diestes) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.10, long. 22.30. Size of territory: 4. Type: [A]. The toponym is ∆5ον, τ# (Thuc. 4.78.6; Staatsverträge 308.9), ∆ε5ον (SEG 31 630). The city-ethnic is ∆ι/στης (SEG 48 785; Steph. Byz. 522.3) or ∆ιστης (Paus. 9.30.8) or ∆ε5ος (Oikonomos (1915) no. 4) or ∆ιες (Steph. Byz. 232.5). The form ∆ια5ος attested on coins (Hatzopoulos and Psoma (1999) 10–12) has nothing to do with Makedonian Dion. In Ps.-Skylax, the chapter about Makedonia (66) opens with πρ)τη π#λις Μακεδονας ‘Ηρκλειον, ∆5ον . . . Thus, Dion is implicitly classiﬁed as a polis in the urban sense in C4f, and explicit references are found in later sources, both literary (Paus. 10.13.5 (rC6l/C5e); cf. CID i 1) and epigraphical (Oikonomos (1915) no. 4 (early second century ad)). Thuc. 4.78.6 calls Dion a polisma. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a C2e letter of Philip V to the city (SEG 48 785). In the same letter polites occurs (cf. the χ8ραι πολτιδες in a Hellenistic catalogue of names: Pandermalis (2002) 381–82). The territory of Classical Dion bordered on that of Leibethra to the south, Pydna to the north-east and possibly Phylakai to the north-west. We know the name of only one of its secondary settlements: Pimpleia, called kome by Strabo at 7 fr. 17, which was famous because of its connection with the legend of Orpheus and the cult of the Muses (Schmidt (1950)). Dion was the religious centre of Makedonia at least from C5 and probably much earlier (cf. Diod. 17.16.3). The patron deity of Dion was Olympian Zeus, to whom the city owed its name (Just. 24.2.8) and who was venerated along with the Muses (Diod. 7.16.3). Other communal cults were those of Demeter, Dionysos, the Mother of the Gods, Aphrodite, Baubo, Orpheus, Athena, Eileithyia, Asklepios and Hermes. Sarapis and Isis are also attested from early Hellenistic times onwards (Pandermalis (1977), (1993); Hatzopoulos (1994b)\n\nmakedonia 106). The most important religious but also political event at Dion, and in Makedonia as a whole, was the panegyris of Olympia held in the month of Dios and lasting nine days (Diod. 17.16.4). Among other contests it included the pentathlon, the dolichos and the taurotheria (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 129 n. 2; cf. BE (1978) no. 232). Dion maintained close relations with Delphi from the Archaic period (CID i 1 (C6/C5e); cf. Paus. 10.13.5 and Mari (2002) 29–31). From a C4m ﬁscal law (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 56) and a C4l decree (ibid. no. 57), both unpublished, we are informed that Dion had fewer than ten archontes and at least two tamiai. The site of Dion comprises the sanctuaries area in the open plain and the walled city to its north. The latter occupies an area of c.43 ha, which justiﬁes the descriptions of Thuc. 4.78.6 (π#λισµα) and Livy 44.7.3 (urbem non magnam). The rectangular grid-line of the street planning, leaving an open space for the agora, is contemporary with the erection of the walls (Stephanidou-Tiveriou (1998) 216–23). These, 2.60–3.30 m wide, date from C4l and were probably built by Kassandros (after 305?). In their pre-Roman phase they had a regular rectangular perimeter of c.2,625 m and about sixty towers. Of a probable total of at least six or seven gates, four have been identiﬁed so far. One of the northern ones, leading to two consecutive courtyards, was probably the main entry to the city. The walls were built from local conglomerate stone. Above the stone substructure rose a brick superstructure of indeterminate height (Stephanidou-Tiveriou (1988)). In the open plain several sanctuaries have been located: two megaron-shaped temples of Demeter adjacent to each other (in which the Mother of the Gods, Baubo and Hypolympidia Aphrodite were probably worshipped as well) date from C6l (Pingiatoglou (1996); Pandermalis (1999) 60–73); near the theatre lay the small C5 temple of Asklepios (Pandermalis (1999) 84–87); ﬁnally, the famous temple and temenos of Olympian Zeus has now been located in the south-eastern part of the sanctuaries area (Pandermalis (1999) 44–59, (2000) 291–92). Other important public buildings in the open plain are the C4e theatre, which was rebuilt in Hellenistic times (Karadedos (1986) 337–40) and the C6l stadion (Leake (1835) 409 and now Pandermalis (1999) 76, 80–81). 535. Edessa (Edessaios) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.45, long. 22.05. Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is ; Εδεσσα, ! (IG iv 617.16 (C4l); Strabo 7.7.4). The city-ethnic is ’Εδεσσα5ος (F. Delphes iii.3 207.2 (C3m)), also spelt\n\n801\n\n’Εδεσσε˜ος (Tataki (1994) no. 56). Edessa is called a polis in Diod. 31.8.8 (r167), probably in the political, urban and territorial senses combined. For late attestations of the urban sense, see Ptol. Geog. 3.12.39 (cf. 17), and for the political sense, see Demitsas no. 3 (second or third century ad). The term polisma is attested in App. Syr. 57, and the term polites in Antoninus (1879) 227, no. 26. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 36 615.4 (c.ad 200). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Cormack (1973) no. 4 (second century ad) and externally in F.Delphes iii.3 207.2 (C3m). The territory of Edessa bordered on the region of Almopia to the north, on the territories of Kyrrhos to the east, on those of Marinia and Skydra to the south, and on the region of Eordaia to the west (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 112). The constitution of Edessa is known to us only from inscriptions of the Roman period (e.g. SEG 24 531.6 (ad 180/1)), which is also the earliest attested public enactment; Antoninus (1879) 227, no. 26). Edessaians were granted proxenia by Delphi (F.Delphes iii.3 207.2 (C3m)) and Haliartos (IG vii 2848.4 (C3?)), and received citizenship from Larisa (SEG 27 202 (220–210)). Edessa is recorded on the Argive list of contributors of C4l, which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi (IG iv 617.16; cf. Perlman (2000) 74). The cult of Herakles is mentioned by Hesychius, s.v. ’Εδεσσα5ος, and is attested epigraphically (Struck (1902) 310 no. 15 and, with the epithet Kynagidas, in two unpublished C2s and C1m inscriptions). From the same period date inscriptions referring to the cults of Zeus Hypsistos (P. Chrysostomou (1989–91) 30–34) and Parthenos (Hatzopoulos (1995)). Evidence for other cults is of later date. A probably C4l (A. Chrysostomou (1988) 60, (1996) 174) wall enclosed both the acropolis (triangular perimeter, one tower on the north-west apex of the triangle and one on each of the west and north sides) and the lower city (polygonal perimeter, 2.4–3 m wide) covering an area of 3.5 and 23 ha respectively (A. Chrysostomou (1987), (1996)). The walls are mentioned by Polyaen. 2.29.2 (r274). The only public monuments known are the temple of Ma and its stoas, which are epigraphically attested (Hatzopoulos (1995) 126). The site has been occupied continuously since the Bronze Age, which accounts for the lack of Archaic and Classical remains (A. Chrysostomou (1996) 180–82); however, Livy 45.30.5 refers to Edessa as among the urbes nobiles of central Makedonia in 167, and it was presumably already so in the Classical period.\n\n802\n\nhatzopoulos and paschidis\n\n536. Europos (Europaios) Map 50. Lat. 40.55, long. 22.35. Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Ε(ρωπ#ς, ! (Thuc. 2.100.3; Strabo 7.7.9; cf. Kotzias, AA 54 (1939) 257 (inscribed tiles)), ’Ωρωπ#ς (App. Syr. 57; BCH 45 (1921) 17, iii.62). The city-ethnic is Ε(ρωπα5ος (F.Delphes iii.4 405.3 (C3e)) or Ε(ρ)πιος (I. Oropos 98 (C3l)). Europos is called a polis in the urban sense in Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36 (cf. 17) and in the political sense in two honoriﬁc decrees for Roman generals (SEG 41 570 (c.110), 42 575 (c.39–38)). Thuc. 2.100.3 calls Europos a chorion. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 41 570 (c.110) and externally in the C4l contribution list from Argos (IG iv 617.17). For the earliest individual use of the city-ethnic, see the proxenia decree from Delphi (F.Delphes iii.4 405.3 (C4l)). The territory of Europos bordered on those of Pella to the south-west, Ichnai to the south-east and Gortynia to the north. Citizens of Europos received the proxenia at Delphi (F.Delphes iii.4 405.3 (C4l)).A cult of Artemis Elaphebolos is attested in a C3 inscription (SEG 43 399). The Europaians are recorded in the Argive list of contributors of C4l, which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi (IG iv 617.17; cf. Perlman (2000) 74). Europos was most probably a walled city in 429, since Sitalkes besieged it but was unable to capture it (Thuc. 2.100.3). Of its public buildings we know only of an aqueduct mentioned in an inscription of Imperial times (SEG 38 608). Ongoing excavations aim to delimit the settlement; sporadic ﬁnds, such as an unpublished late Archaic kouros (Savvopoulou (1988) 137), testify to Europos’ importance as a trading centre of the Axios valley. 537. Herakleion (Herakleiotes) Map 50. Lat. 40.00, long. 22.40. Size of territory: 3. Type: A. The toponym is ‘Ηρκλειον, τ# (Damastes (FGrHist 5) fr. 4.3; Ps.-Skylax 66; IG i³ 77.v.21 ( T Ερκλειον)), ‘Ηρκλεια, ! (Steph. Byz. 304.3). The city-ethnic is ‘Ηρακλει)της (Gonnoi 93). Herakleion is called a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 66. The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally in Gonnoi 93B.24 (C3l)). The territory of Herakleion bordered on that of Gonnoi to the south-west (see the dossier in Gonnoi 93–107), Leibethra on the north and possibly Homolion, beyond the Peneios, before the foundation of Phila on the mouth of that river in Hellenistic times. Herakleion became a member of the Delian League some time between 430/29 and 425/4 or, at least, the Athenians claimed its membership and had it assessed for a tribute of\n\n1,000 drachmas (IG i³ 71.iv.108, completely restored; 77.v.21). Herakleion appears as a walled city in 169 (Polyb. 28.11.1; Livy 44.9.1–9), but its fortiﬁcations most probably date from C5, since the city could successfully challenge the authority of Perdikkas II and remain a member of the Delian League for years. Presumably, the walls covered the entire hill, since Heuzey (1860) 92–93 saw remains of them at the bottom of the hill, near the river bank. 538. Ichnai (Ichnaios) Map 50. Lat. 40.45, long. 22.35. (On the location of Ichnai on the right bank of the Axios, see Hatzopoulos (2001) 159–60.) Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is ; Ιχναι, αH (Hdt. 7.123.3; BCH 45 (1921) 17.iii.63), Xχναι (Eratosthenes according to Steph. Byz. 342.17, but probably referring to the Thessalian Ichnai; cf. Steph. Byz. 152.16). The city-ethnic is ’Ιχνα5ος (IG ii² 8944 (undated)). Ichnai is called a polis in the urban sense in Hdt. 7.123.3 and in the political sense in a treaty(?) between that city and Dikaia(?) (Struck (1902) 310 no. 15.2 (undated)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C5e (infra) and in inscriptions (Struck (1902) 309 no. 14.6 and 310 no. 15.2). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested in a Delphic C3m proxeny decree (F.Delphes iii.3 207.3 (C3m)) and in an undated Attic sepulchral inscription (IG ii² 8944). The name of the territory of Ichnai might be ’Ιχναων χ)ρα (Hsch. s.v. ’Ιχνααν, unless the reference is to the homonymous Thessalian city). It bordered on the territories of Pella to the south-west,Allante to the south, Tyrissa to the north-west, and probably Herakleia in Mygdonia to the east, across the Axios. The probable site of the urban centre has been totally destroyed by intense agricultural activity (ArchDelt 49 (1994) Chron. 455). Two fragments of an inscription of unknown date might belong to a treaty between Ichnai and Dikaia (Papazoglou (1988) 155–56). A citizen of Ichnai was awarded proxenia by Delphi (F.Delphes iii.3 207.3 (C3m)); another Ichnaian was appointed theorodokos for theoroi arriving from the same city (BCH 45 (1921) 17 iii.63 (c.220)). Judging by the onomastic evidence, Ichnai must have been originally a Paionian settlement which already in Archaic times received an inﬂux of Southern Greek colonists. After the Makedonian conquest, settlers from the Old Kingdom were added to its population (cf. Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 107 n. 1). It seems that citizens of Ichnai, in their turn, participated in the Makedonian colonisation of Amphipolis (Hatzopoulos (1991) 86).\n\nmakedonia Before the Makedonian conquest, Ichnai struck silver staters and octadrachms (c.490–480). Types: obv. male ﬁgure, usually between two bulls, or beside a horse; rev. wheel, or cross in an incuse square; legend: [ΙΧ]ΝΑΙ[ΟΝ], ΙΧΝΑΙ, ΙΧΝΑΟΝ, ΙΧΝΑΙΟΝ (Gaebler (1935) 63–65; Price and Waggoner (1975) 29–30, 117; Papazoglou (1988) 155; SNG Cop. Macedonia 183–84). 539. Kyrrhos (Kyrrhestes) Map 50. Lat. 40.50, long. 22.15. Size of territory: 4? Type: B. The toponym is Κρρος, ! (Thuc. 2.100.4; Steph. Byz. 430.17; Vavritsas (1977) 8), Κρνος (Diod. 18.4.5, MSS, apparently a mistake), Κριος (in the MS of Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36; cf. the form Scurio (It. Burd. 606.3). The city-ethnic is Κυρρ/στης (SEG 40 520; Plin. HN 4.34: Cyrrestae; cf. SEG 27 258 (Roman)) or Κυρρα5ος (SEG 43 435.3 (early third century ad)). The only attestations of Kyrrhos as a polis (in the urban sense) are Plin. HN 4.34 and Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36 (cf. 17), but its mention alongside Dion and Amphipolis in Alexander’s ‘Υποµνµατα (infra) leaves no doubt that Kyrrhos too was a polis already in C4. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on a second century ad boundary stone (SEG 40 520). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see SEG 43 435 (early third century ad). The territory of Kyrrhos bordered on the territories of Edessa to the west, Skydra to the south-west, Pella to the south-east, Tyrissa to the east, and Europos to the northeast. An unpublished C3 decree (cf. Vavritsas (1977)) reveals that Genderrhos was a kome of Kyrrhos. The name of another meros (kome?) of the city, Mandarai, is preserved in Steph. Byz. 430.17. The earliest public enactment of Kyrrhos is an unpublished C3 decree concerning public works in the vicinity and in the agora of the city (Vavritsas (1977)). Kyrrhos was renowned for its sanctuary of Athena Kyrrhestis, which was located on the hill of Palaiokastron (Vavritsas (1977)). It would be tempting to interpret the mass of semi-worked limestone blocks in a nearby C4s quarry (Bakalakis (1970)) as preliminary work for the νας πολυτελς of Athena which Alexander was planning to built in Kyrrhos (Diod. 18.4.5); two C4l/C3e poros capitals— probably of a temple—may attest a later attempt to implement Alexander’s plan (Haddad (1993); Adam-Veleni (1998) 6). The sanctuary of Artemis Agrotera is known from dedications of the Roman period (Panayotou and Chrysostomou (1993) 379–80). The agora of the city is mentioned several times in the C3 unpublished decree (Vavritsas (1977) 8; Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 438–39).\n\n803\n\nThe patron deity of Kyrrhos was Athena, for whom Alexander was planning to build a magniﬁcent temple at the time of his death (Diod. 18.4.5). The cult of Athena Kyrrhestis, which is also attested epigraphically (SEG 27 258 (Roman)), was transferred to the homonymous city in Syria. Other communal cults were those of Artemis Agrotera (attested by Roman evidence: SEG 30 553–54, 35 750, 43 404–5) and of Zeus Hypsistos (P. Chrysostomou (1989–91) 40–41). 540. Leibethra (Leibethrios) Map 50. Lat. 40.50, long. 22.30. Size of territory: 3. Type: C. The toponym is Λεβηθρα, τ (Aesch. fr. 83a.9; BCH 45 (1921) 17 iii.53) or Λεβηθρον (Strabo 10.3.17) or Λβηθρα (Paus. 9.30.9). The city-ethnic is Λειβθριος (Arist. fr. 552; Gonnoi 2.6) or Λιβθριος (Paus. 9.30.11). Leibethra is called a polis in the urban sense in Paus. 9.30.9, referring to the mythical period. The term patris is used in Orph. Argonaut. 1374. Alternative site-classiﬁcations are ethnos (Arist. fr. 552), chorion or oros (Strabo 10.3.17), topos (Hsch., s.v. λεβηθρον) and σκοπι (Lyc. Alex. 275). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on an inscribed weight of one mina (SEG 27 283 (undated)) and externally in Arist. fr. 563 and in a C3e decree from Gonnoi (Gonnoi 2.6). Originally populated by Thracian Pieres, Leibethra and this part of Pieria were conquered by the Makedonians c.C7 (Strabo 10.3.17; cf. Hammond (1972) 417). According to the legend mentioned by Pausanias (9.30.11), the city was destroyed by the river Sys. The topography of the site and the remains of the walls make such a “destruction” by the four torrents in the area quite possible (Kotzias (1948–49) 33–34), although the continued existence of the city is secured by Classical (Pritchett (1991) 127) and Hellenistic (Kotzias (1948–49) 34) remains, by the mention of the city in the C3 inscription from Gonnoi (Gonnoi 2.6) and by the C3l Delphic list of theorodokoi (BCH 45 (1921) 17 iii.53). The territory of Leibethra probably extended from the mountainous area of Lower Olympos to the valley of Sys (Helly (1973) 35–36; Gonnoi 5). The city bordered on Gonnoi to the south-west, presumably on Herakleion to the south, and Dion to the north. The cults of Orpheus, the Nymphs, the Muses and Dionysos are attested in literary sources (Kotzias (1948–49) 26–28). The cult of the latter deity has now found a possible archaeological conﬁrmation (SEG 27 283). The legend of the city’s destruction mentions the existence of walls (Paus. 9.30.11). Kotzias ((1948–49) 33–34), who\n\n804\n\nhatzopoulos and paschidis\n\nexcavated the site, discovered part of a circuit of 1.5 m-wide walls. According to Pritchett ((1991) 127), the circuit was no more than 500 m long. Recent work has conﬁrmed that the acropolis (1.5 ha) was walled and that the site was not abandoned until C1 (ArchDelt 50 (1995) Chron. 497–98). 541. Methone (Methonaios) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.30, long. 22.35. Size of territory: 3? Type: A. The toponym is Μεθ)νη, ! (Thuc. 6.7.3; IG ii² 130), Μεθ)να (IG iv².1 94.ib.8). The city-ethnic is Μεθωνα5ος (IG i³ 61; Thuc. 4.129.4; Arist. frr. 551–52). Methone is called a polis both in the urban sense (Dem. 9.26; Ps.-Skylax 66) and in the political sense (IG i³ 61.44–45; Plut. Mor. 293B, probably derived from Aristotle’s treatise). In Din. 1.14 polis is used in both senses simultaneously. The politai of Methone are mentioned in Diod. 16.34.5 (r354), and there was an Aristotelian Methonaion politeia (frr. 551–52). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins (infra) and externally in IG i³ 61.1. For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see e.g. IG ii² 9330 (C5l). According to Thuc. 6.7.3, Methone bordered on Makedonia (τν Iµορον Μακεδονα), and its territory (τ˜ες χ#ρας τ˜ες Μεθ[ο]ναον) is mentioned in IG i³ 61.22. The territory of Classical Methone bordered on that of Pydna to the south and Aloros to the north-west. The size of the territory must have been close to 100 km², perhaps a little more. After 354 it must have been added to that of Pydna (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 181). Methone was originally a Thracian settlement. It was colonised by Eretrians c.730 (Hammond (1972) 425–26) and joined the Delian League after 431 (for the date and the erroneous restoration of the ethnic in IG i³ 280.ii.67, see Piérart (1988)). It belonged to the Thracian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 430/29 (IG i³ 281.ii.33, restored) to 415/14 (IG i³ 290.iii.8) a total of three times, paying a phoros of 3 tal. (IG i³ 282.ii.53). It was assessed for tribute in 425/4 (IG i³ 71.iii.157 (5 tal.), ethnic completely restored). In 364 or 363 it was captured by the Athenian Timotheos (Din. 1.14 ⫽3.17) and became an ally of Athens but probably without becoming a member of the Second Athenian Naval League (Dreher (1995) 26). Methone was conquered and destroyed by Philip II in 354 (Dem. 4.4; Diod. 16.31.6 and 34.4–5). The inhabitants were allowed to leave the city with one garment each; the city itself was razed to the ground, and its territory distributed to Makedonian settlers. A few decades later, old Methone was succeeded by a new settlement 1 km to the north-west of the former city, which, however, did not enjoy the status of polis but was probably a\n\nkome of Pydna (Hatzopoulos et al. (1990); for the origin of the new settlers, see Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 180–81). Our only information about the constitutional arrangements of Methone concerns its magistrates, the archontes and the polemarchos mentioned in Arist. fr. 551. A Methonaian theorodokos hosted the theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348) (IG iv².1 94.b.8) c.360. Another Methonaian is known to have been granted citizenship in Ephesos (I.Ephesos 48 (C4l)). Methone was a walled city in 354 (Dem. 1.9; Theopomp. fr. 52; Polyaen. 4.2.15; Just. Epit. 7.6.14). No remains of the walls are visible today. Methone struck only one type of bronze coinage in C4f. Types: obv. female head to the r.; rev. lion breaking spear; legend: ΜΕΘΩ (Gaebler (1935) 78–79; Psoma (2001) 115). 542. Mieza (Miezaios/Miezeus) Map 50. Lat. 40.40, long. 22.05. Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Μεζα, ! (Plut. Alex. 7.4), Μ/ζα (BCH 45 (1921) 17, iii.59), Μεζα (in the MS of Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36); the alternative name Στρυµ#νιον given by Steph. Byz. 452.1 (perhaps quoting Theagenes (FGrHist 774) fr. 7) is probably an epithet. The city-ethnic is Μιεζα5ος (Theagenes (FGrHist 774) fr. 7), later spelt Μιεζ˜εος (I.Leukopetra 71.8–9), or Μιεζες (Arr. Ind. 18.6 (r325)). Mieza is called a polis in the urban sense by Steph. Byz. 452.1, possibly quoting Theagenes (FGrHist 774) fr.7 (C3); cf. Ptol. Geog. 3.12.36 (cf. 17). For the individual use of the cityethnic, see Arr. Ind. 18.6. The territory of Mieza is called Μιεζ˜εοι τ#ποι in I.Leukopetra 71.8–9; we know the names of two settlements that were probably its komai, Gaimeion and Nea [---] (SEG 24 524 (C3)). It bordered on the territory of Beroia to the south, Marinia to the north-west, and Skydra to the northeast. Among the magistrates, the eponymous priest of Asklepios, the epistates, tagoi and dikastai are attested in the Hellenistic period (SEG 24 524 (C2f)), and at least the priest of Asklepios and the epistates are likely to have existed since C4 (Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 156). The cults of Asklepios (SEG 24 524 (C2f)), the Nymphs (Plut. Alex. 7.4), Artemis (SEG 24 525–26), Herakles Kallinikos (Demitsas (1896) no. 18) and the river god Olganos (Kallipolitis (1952)) are attested in Mieza. Although the archaeological complex of Leukadia– Kopanos–Naoussa was well known from the nineteenth century, only most recently have excavations started at the very site of the ancient city (Rhomiopoulou (1997)). A large\n\nmakedonia (over 106 m long) C4 stoa, which might form part of a Asklepieion complex, has come to light (Allamani-Souri and Misaelidou (1992) 203–12; Allamani-Souri et al. (2002)). Moreover, the school that Aristotle founded in Mieza (Plut. Alex. 7.4) is almost certainly to be identiﬁed with the building complex at Isvoria, to the south-west of the civic centre, where three caves are joined by elaborate peripatoi, niches, stoas and staircases (Siganidou and Trochides (199o), with earlier refs.). 543. Pella (Pellaios) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.45, long. 22.30. Size of territory: 4 (P. Chrysostomou (1990) 223). Type: A. The toponym is Π/λλα, ! (Hdt. 7.123.3; Thuc. 2.99.4; Syll.³ 267A.4), earlier (or as an epithet?) Βονοµος or Βουν#µεια (Steph. Byz. 515.7–8). The city-ethnic is Πελλα5ος (Arvanitopoulos (1909) no. 16; Arr. Anab. 3.5.3). The alternative forms Πελληνα5ος of Plut. Mor. 339B and Πελλην#ς of Steph. Byz. 515.9–10 are otherwise unknown. Pella is called a polis in the urban sense in Hdt. 7.123.3 and Ps.-Skylax 66. At Xen. Hell. 5.2.13, µεγστη τ+ν .ν Μακεδονας π#λεων is used about Pella both in the personal-political and in the urban sense. The earliest attestation of polis in a purely political sense is in the asylia decree for Kos (SEG 12 374.9 (243)). In a verse dedication of Queen Eurydika, wife of Amyntas II, πολ5τις is used about the female citizens, presumably of Pella (Plut. Mor. 14B with BE (1984) 249). Pella is called a polisma in App. Syr. 57 and a metropolis in Strabo 16.2.10. Ps.Skylax 66 writes: π#λις κα βασλειον .ν α(τ=8 (C4m). πατρς is used about Pella in a C4s epigram from Delphi (SEG 18 222a), in AG 7.139 (C1) and in Strabo 16.2.10. Demosthenes’ description of Pella as a χωρω δ#ξω . . . κα µικρ+ (18.68 (rC4e)) is clearly a rhetorical distortion (cf. Xen. Hell. 5.2.13). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the C2f coinage of the city (Gaebler (1935) 93–97) and externally in the asylia decree for Kos (SEG 12 374 (243)). For the individual use of the city-ethnic, see Arr. Ind. 18.3 (r325), and Arvanitopoulos (1909) no. 16 (C3e). Pella’s extensive territory, Πελλαα (Strabo 7 fr. 20), bordered on the territories of Allante to the south-east, Ichnai to the east, Tyrissa to the north, and Kyrrhos to the north-west and to the west. We know the sites of ﬁve secondary settlements, at Archontikon, Damianon B, Agrosykia, Leptokarya B and Ag. Nikolaos (Krya Vrysi), and two suburbs, one to the north-west and one to the west of the city (P. Chrysostomou (1990); Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 111–12). Pella, originally a Paionian settlement, received an important Ionian inﬂux from early Archaic times. It became a member of the Chalkidian Federation for a brief period in\n\n805\n\nthe 380s (Xen. Hell. 5.2.13). The transfer of the royal residence to the city in the reign of Amyntas III was accompanied by a signiﬁcant Makedonian migration which transformed the character of the city, as the onomastics and the archaeological remains show (Hammond and Grifﬁth (1979) 56; Hatzopoulos (1996b) i. 171–73). There is no evidence for the Classical constitution of Pella; in C3 there is evidence of an archon, an epistates (SEG 48 818), a boule and a demos (SEG 48 817) as well as tamiai (SEG 12 374). In C4s (Syll.³ 267; SEG 18 222a) and in C3m (F.Delphes iii.3 207.2) several citizens of Pella received the proxenia of Delphi. The patron divinity of Pella was Athena Alkidemos (Livy 42.51.2; cf. Gaebler (1935) 93–97). Among other cults, those of Apollo, Artemis, Asklepios, Dionysos, Zeus Meilichios, Herakles Kynagidas, Herakles Phylakos, the Muses and Pan are attested from epigraphic, literary and archaeological sources (SEG 24 540; Papakonstantinou-Diamantourou (1971) 38–51; P. Chrysostomou (1989) 105–6). Moreover, the C4l sanctuaries of the Mother of the Gods, of Demeter and of Darron have been uncovered in or near the city (Lilimpaki-Akamati (1987), (1990), (1991), (1996), (2000), (2002)). For none of the cults do we have evidence from the Classical period. A Pellaian theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Nemea (SEG 36 331.B.23–24 (323–317); for the identiﬁcation of the theorodokos, see Knoepﬂer (2001) 187–90).A citizen of Pella was victorious in the Isthmian and Pythian Games (SEG 18 222a (C4s)). Pella was the largest city of Makedonia; for a general description, see Lilimpaki-Akamati (2002). The rectangular C4s wall is of mudbrick upon a stone foundation and predates the C4l grid plan of the town (Siganidou (1987a)). The city had two citadels. The acropolis, situated on the northern hill and covering an area of 6 ha, is entirely occupied by the palatial complex. At the southern end of the city the islet Phakos in Lake Loudiake, which was connected with the mainland via a drawbridge, qualiﬁed as an >κρα and housed the central Makedonian treasury (Strabo 7 fr. 20). The city was built on a regular Hippodamian grid line with two main north–south roads and one west–east road crossing them in the agora area (Siganidou (1990)). The 200 ⫻ 182 m-wide agora is surrounded by stoas: the north one probably housed the seat of the politarchs, while on the north-west side of the agora probably lay the city archive; along with the building complex around it, the agora covers an area of ten blocks in the centre of the city (Akamatis (1999)). The palace of the Makedonian kings (central complex C4f) covers the entire acropolis area (6 ha) north of the agora. It consists of\n\n806\n\nhatzopoulos and paschidis\n\nthree building complexes, along an east–west axis. Each building complex is composed of two buildings, one to the south, towards the city, and one to the north. All three southern buildings have a large peristyle court. The northern buildings of the west and central complex have bathing facilities. A long stoa of more than 153 m with a 15 m-wide propylon forms the southern façade of the central and east complex facing the city (Siganidou (1987b), (1996); Ginouvès (1994) 88–91; P. Chrysostomou (1996)). Other public buildings uncovered are a large C4l tholos, probably a heroon of Herakles and used as bouleuterion by the Makedonian Council (Hadzisteliou-Price (1973)) and the sanctuaries of the Mother of the Gods and Aphrodite in the agora area, of Demeter in the south-east quarter of the city, and of Darron in the south-west quarter (LilimbakiAkamati (1987), (1990), (1991), (1996), (2000)). A theatre is mentioned by Plutarch in a C4s context (Mor. 1096B). 544. Pydna (Pydnaios) Maps 49–50. Lat. 40.25, long. 22.35. Size of territory: 3 or 4. Type: A. The toponym is Πδνα, ! (Thuc. 1.61.2; Gonnoi 98.7), Πτνα (IG ii² 329.13 ⫽ Staatsverträge 403), Κδνα, which is considered to be the authentic form of the name (Theagenes (FGrHist 774) fr. 5 ⫽Steph. Byz. 390.8–10). The city-ethnic is Πυδνα5ος (Dem. 1.5; Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 55), Πυνδνα5ος, Πυδδνα5ος (only on coins: Tselekas (1996) 14); Πυτνα5ος (IG ii² 339.b.3). Pydna is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 66) and is listed as a polis in the urban and political senses simultaneously at Din. 1.14 ⫽3.17. The term asty is attested in Polyaen. 4.11.3 (r317), and the term polichnion in a scholion on Arist. Rh. 1411a9. The earliest epigraphical attestation of the π#λις Πυδναων is in an honoriﬁc decree of c.169 (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 55). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins (infra) and externally perhaps on a fragmentary asylia decree (SEG 12 374.16 (243)). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an honoriﬁc decree (Hatzopoulos (1996b) ii. no. 55.2 (c.169)) and externally in a C4s Athenian proxeny decree (IG ii² 339.b.3 (333)). The territory of Classical Pydna bordered on that of Methone to the north and of Dion to the south, and may have covered over 200 km². As the recent excavations have shown, Pydna was not a colonial foundation but a Makedonian settlement (Bessios and Pappa (1996) 5). Already in the reign of Alexander I it\n\nbelonged to the Makedonian kingdom (Thuc. 1.137.1). In 432 it was unsuccessfully besieged by the Athenians (Thuc. 1.61). In 410 it rebelled against King Archelaos and seceded from the kingdom, but it was besieged again, and captured after a long siege. Its inhabitants were transferred some 4 km inland, perhaps to modern Kitros (Diod. 13.49.2). Apparently the old site was reoccupied already in C4e (Bessios (1990) 241), and in the reign of Amyntas III Pydna seems for a time to have again successfully seceded from the kingdom, since it struck its own coins; but in the reign of Alexander II, at the latest, it seems to have returned to the fold of the kingdom (Hatzopoulos (1985) 253 n. 66; for a different interpretation of the numismatic evidence, see Tselekas (1996) 19–24). In 364 or 363 it was captured by Timotheos (Din. 1.14 ⫽ 3.17; for the date see Diod. 15.81.6) and became an ally of Athens, but probably without becoming a member of the Second Athenian Naval League (Dreher (1995) 26). In 357 it was besieged and captured by Philip II (Dem. 1.9; Diod. 16.8.3), presumably by being betrayed to the Makedonians (Dem. 20.63, see Hammond and Grifﬁth (1979) 242–44); it thereafter remained an integral part of the Makedonian kingdom. Only two temples are attested in the Classical period: that of Athena (IG ii² 329.13 ⫽Staatsverträge 403 (336)) and that posthumously erected in honour of Amyntas III (Habicht (1970) 11–12). Pydnaian theorodokoi received theoroi from Epidauros c.360 (IG iv² 94 i.b.7). Pydna was a walled city at least from 432 (Thuc. 1.61.3, implicitly; cf. Diod. 19.49.1 (r317)), but probably already in C5e (Bessios and Pappa (1996) 5–6). Traces of the walls were seen by Hammond ((1984) 377). The area enclosed by the walls was c.25 ha, making Pydna one of the largest Makedonian cities in C5e, undoubtedly because of the importance of its harbour (Bessios and Pappa (1996) 6). Pydna struck bronze coins in C4f. (1) During the reign of Amyntas III, types: obv. head of young Herakles wearing lion skin to the r.; rev. eagle with closed wings to the r. devouring serpent which it holds with its talons; legend: ΠΥ∆ΝΑΙΩΝ or ΠΥΝ∆ΝΑΙΩΝ and once ΠΥ∆∆ΝΑΙΩΝ. (2) C.364–357: obv. female head facing l. or r., wearing ear-ring and necklace, her hair in a sphendone; rev. owl to the r., standing on olive branch; legend: ΠΥ∆ΝΑΙΩΝ (Gaebler (1935) 105–6; Tselekas (1996) 14, 26–30; SNG Cop.

Modern discussion of the speech of the ancient Macedonians began in 1808, when F. G. Sturz published a small book entitled De dialecto macedonica liber (Leipzig 1808), intended to be a scientific enquiry into the position of Macedonian within Greek. However, after the publication of O. Müller’s work Über die Wohnsitz, die Abstammung und die ältere Geschichte des makedonischen Volks (Berlin 1825), the discussion evolved into an acrimonious controversy -- initially scientific but soon political -- about the Greek or non-Greek nature of this tongue. Diverse theories were put forward: I) Macedonian is a mixed language either of partly Illyrian origin -- such was the position of Müller himself, G. Kazaroff, M. Rostovtzeff, M. Budimir, H. Baric; or of partly Thracian origin, as it was maintained by D. Tzanoff. II) Macedonian is a separate Indo-European language. This was the opinion of V. Pisani, I. Russu, G. Mihailov, P. Chantraine, I. Pudic, C. D. Buck, E. Schwyzer, V. Georgiev, W. W. Tarn and of O. Masson in his youth. III) But according to most scholars Macedonian was a Greek dialect. This view has been expanded by F. G. Sturz, A. Fick, G. Hatzidakis, O. Hoffmann, F. Solmsen, V. Lesny, Andriotis, F. Geyer, N. G. L. Hammond, N. Kalleris, A. Toynbee, Ch. Edson and O. Masson in his mature years. IV) Finally, a small number of scholars thought that the evidence available was not sufficient to form an opinion. Such was the view of A. Meillet and A. Momigliano. Whatever the scientific merits of the above scholars, it was the nature of the evidence itself and, above all, its scarcity, which allowed the propounding of opinions so diverse and incompatible between themselves. In fact, not one phrase of Macedonian, not one complete syntagm had come down to us in the literary tradition; • •\n\nbecause Macedonian, like many other Greek dialects, was never promoted to the dignity of a literary vehicle; because the Temenid kings, when they endowed their administration with a chancery worthy of the name, adopted the Attic koine, which in the middle of the fourth century was prevailing as the common administrative idiom around the shores of the Aegean basin.\n\nThus, the only available source for knowledge of Macedonian speech were the glosses, that is to say isolated words collected by lexicographers mainly from literary works because of their rarity or strangeness, and also personal names which, as we know, are formed from appellatives (Νικηφόρος< νίκη + φέρω).\n\nThe glosses, rare and strange words by definition, had the major defect of being liable to corruption, to alterations, in the course of transmission through the ages by copyists who could not recognise them. As far as personal names are concerned, for want of scientific epigraphic corpora of the Macedonian regions, until very recently it was impossible to compile trustworthy lists. On top of that, these two sources of information, far from leading to convergent conclusions, suggested conflicting orientations. While the glosses included, besides words with a more or less clear Greek etymology (καρπαία· ὄρχησις μακεδονική [cf. καρπός]· κύνουπες· ἄρκτοι· Μακεδόνες [cf. κύνωψ]˙ ῥάματα· βοτρύδια, σταφυλίς· Μακεδόνες [cf. ῥάξ, gen. ῥαγός]), a significant number of terms hard to interpret as Greek ( γόδα˙ ἔντερα˙. Μακεδόνες; γοτάν˙ ὗν˙ Μακεδόνες; σκοῖδος˙ ἀρχή τις παρὰ Μακεδόσι [Hesychius]), the vast majority of personal names, not only were perfectly Greek (Φίλιππος, Ἀλέξανδρος, Παρμενίων, Ἀντίπατρος, Ἀντίοχος, Ἀρσινόη, Εὐρυδίκη) but also presented original traits excluding the possibility of their being borrowed from the Attic dialect, which was the official idiom of the kingdom (Ἀμύντας, Μαχάτας, Ἀλκέτας, Λάαγος), indeed from any other Greek dialect (Πτολεμαῖος, Κρατεύας, Βούπλαγος). Until very recently it was hard to tell which set of evidence was more trustworthy. During the last thirty years the situation has radically changed thanks to the publication of the epigraphic corpora of Thessalonike (1972) and Northern Macedonia (1999) by the Berlin Academy and of Upper Macedonia (1985) and Beroia (1998) by the Research Centre for Greek and Roman Antiquity (KERA). Meanwhile the latter centre has also published three important onomastic collections: of Beroia, of Edessa and of Macedonians attested outside their homeland. This intense epigraphic activity fed by continuous archaeological discoveries has brought to light an abundance of documents, among which the first texts written in Macedonian. This new body of evidence renders to a large extent irrelevant the old controversies and requires an ab initio re-opening of the discussion on a different basis. Old theories however, die hard and relics of obsolete erudition still encumber handbooks and scientific journals. I particularly have in mind R. A. Crossland’s chapter in the second edition of volume III 1 of the Cambridge Ancient History and E. N. Borza’s latest booklet Before Alexander. Constructions of Early Macedonia published respectively in 1982 and 1999. One reason – perhaps the main one – for such resistance to the assimilation of new evidence and persistence of obsolete theories until these very last years is the way in which since the nineteenth century the scholarly discussion about Macedonian speech and its Greek or non-Greek character has focused on the sporadic presence in Macedonian glosses and proper names -- which otherwise looked perfectly Greek -- of the sign of the voiced stop (β, δ, γ) instead of the corresponding unvoiced, originally “aspirated” stop expected in Greek, as for instance in Βάλακρος and Βερενίκα instead of Φάλακρος and Φερενίκα.\n\nHere I must open a parenthesis. The traditional English pronunciation of classical Greek presents an obstacle to the understanding of the problem. To make things simple, one may say that classical Greek originally possessed several series of occlusive consonants or stops, that is to say consonants obtained by the momentary occlusion of the respiratory ducts. These, according to the articulatory region, can be distinguished into labials, dentals and velars (the occlusion is respectively performed by the lips, the teeth or the velum of the palate) and, according to the articulatory mode, into unvoiced (/p/, /t/, /k/), voiced (/b/, /d/, /g/) and unvoiced “aspirates” – in fact “expirates”, that is to say, accompanied by a breathing – (/ph/, /th/, /kh/). These “aspirates”, in some dialects from the archaic period and in most by the Hellenistic age, had become spirants, that is to say they were no longer obtained by the complete occlusion of the respiratory ducts, but by their simple contraction and were accordingly pronounced as /f/, /θ/, /χ/. At the same time the voiced stops also might, according to the phonetic context, lose their occlusion and become spirants pronounced /v/, /δ/, /γ/. In fact, the chronology of the passage from the “classical” to the “Hellenistic” pronunciation varied according to dialect and to region. The occlusive consonants of Greek are the heirs of an Indo-European system which differed from the Greek one in that it possessed an additional series of occlusive consonants pronounced with both the lips and the velum. This series survived until the Mycenaean period, but was subsequently eliminated from all Greek dialects in various ways. Moreover, in the Indo-European system of consonants the place of the Greek series of unvoiced “aspirate” stops was occupied by a series of voiced “aspirate” stops, that is to say voiced stops accompanied by a breathing. These last ones (/bh/, /dh/, /gh/, gwh/) survived to a large extent only in Sanskrit and in modern Indian dialects. Elsewhere, they either lost their breathing (such is the case of the Slavonic, Germanic, and Celtic languages), or their sonority (such is the case of the Greek and Italic languages, in which they evolved into (/ph/, /th/, /kh/, /khw/). Thus the root bher- is represented by the verb bharami in Sanskrit, bero in Old Slavonic, baira in Gothic, berim in ancient Irish, φέρω in Greek and fero in Latin. The supporters of the non-Greek nature of Macedonian reasoned as follows: if, instead of the well known Greek personal names Φάλακρος (“the bald one”) or Φερενίκη (“she who brings victory”) with a phi, we read the names Βάλακρος or Βερενίκα with a beta on the inscriptions of Macedonia, this is because the Macedonian tongue has not participated in the same consonant mutations as prehistoric Greek -- already before the first Mycenaean documents in Linear B -which had transformed the “aspirate” voiced stops of Indo-European (/bh/, /dh/, /gh/) into “aspirate” unvoiced stops (/ph/, /th/, /kh/). That is to say that, instead of the loss of sonority of Greek, in Macedonian we are dealing with the loss of “aspiration” in Macedonian, which classifies the latter along with the Slavonic, the Germanic and the Celtic languages. But, if Macedonian was separated from Greek before the second millennium B.C., it cannot be considered a Greek dialect, even an aberrant one. What the partisans of such theories have not always explicitly stated is that they all rely on the postulate that the sounds rendered by the signs β, δ, γ in Macedonian glosses and proper names are the direct heirs of the series of voiced “aspirate” stops of Indo-European and do not result from a secondary sonorisation, within Greek, of the series represented by the signs φ, θ, χ. However, one must be wary of short-cuts and simplifications in linguistics. For instance, the sound /t/ in\n\nthe German word “Mutter” is not the direct heir of the same sound in the IndoEuropean word *mater, but has evolved from the common Germanic form *moδer, which was the reflex of Indo-European *mater. The example of Latin demonstrates that the evolution /bh/>/ph/>/f/>/v/>/b/, envisaged above, is perfectly possible. Thus, the form albus (“white”) in Latin does not come directly from Indo-European *albhos. In fact the stem albh- became first alph- and then alf- in Italic, and it was only secondarily that the resulting spirant sonorised into alv- which evolved into alb- in Latin (cf. alfu=albos in Umbrian and ἀλφούς˙ λευκούς in Greek). G. Hatzidakis (see especially Zur Abstammung der alten Makedonier [Athens 1897] 35-37) was the first – and for many years the only one – to stress the importance -and at the same time the weakness -- of the implicit postulate of the partisans of the non-Greek character of Macedonian, to wit the alleged direct descent of the series represented by the signs of the voiced stops in the Macedonian glosses and personal names from the Indo-European series of “aspirate” voiced stops. Since the middle of the eighties of the last century the acceleration of archaeological research in Macedonia and also the activities of the Macedonian Programme of the Research Centre for Greek and Roman Antiquity (KERA) mentioned above have occasioned numerous scholarly works exploiting the new evidence has been collected and allows us to go beyond the Gordian knot which since the nineteenth century had kept captive all discussion about the tongue of the ancient Macedonians (Cl. Brixhe, Anna Panayotou, O. Masson, L. Dubois, M. B. Hatzopoulos). It would not be an exaggeration to say that henceforward the obstacle hindering the identification of the language spoken by Philip and Alexander has been removed: ancient Macedonian, as we shall see, was really and truly a Greek dialect. On this point all linguists or philologists actively dealing with the problem are of the same opinion. It is equally true that they do not agree on everything. Two questions still raise serious contention: a) How should be explained this sporadic presence in Macedonian glosses and proper names of the signs of voiced stops (β, δ, γ) instead of the corresponding originally “aspirate” unvoiced ones (φ, θ, χ) of the other Greek dialects? b) What is the dialectal position of Macedonian within Greek? The first question has been tackled several times in recent years, but with divergent conclusions by Cl. Brixhe and Anna Panayotou on the one hand and O. Masson, L. Dubois and the present speaker on the other. On the question of the dialectal affinities of Macedonian within Greek, besides the above mentioned scholars, N. G. L. Hammond and E. Voutiras have also made significant contributions. As far as I am concerned I have been gradually convinced that the two questions are intimately linked, or rather, that the search for the affinities of the Macedonian dialect can provide a satisfactory explanation of this controversial particularity of its consonantal system. A problematic mutation Down to very recent years discussion on the topic on the Macedonian consonantal system was almost exclusively dependent on literary evidence.\n\nThe systematic collection of inscriptions from Macedonia in the Epigraphic Archive of KERA occasioned the publication of three articles exploiting this epigraphic material, the first two in 1987 and the third in 1988. The first one, written by the present speaker had its starting point in a series of manumissions by consecration to Artemis from the territory of Aigeai (modern Vergina), who was qualified as Διγαία and Βλαγαν(ε)ῖτις, the latter derived from the place name at which she was venerated (ἐν Βλαγάνοις). It was obvious to me that the first epiclesis was nothing else than the local form of the adjective δίκαιος, δικαία, δίκαιον (“the just one”). As for the explanation of the less obvious epiclesis Blaganitis and of the place name Blaganoi, the clue was provided by Hesychius’ gloss βλαχάν˙ ὁ βάτραχος, which I connected with one of the manumission texts qualifying Artemis as the godess [τῶν β]ατράχων. The two epicleseis of Artemis demonstrated that Macedonian might occasionally present voiced consonants – in the case in hand represented by the letter gamma — not only instead of unvoiced “aspirates” (in this case represented by the letter chi of βλαχάν) but also instead of simple unvoiced stops (in this case represented by the letter kappa of Δικαία). This discovery had important implications, because it showed that the phenomenon under examination, of which I collected numerous examples, had nothing to do with a consonant mutation going back to Indo-European, which could concern only the voiced “aspirates” and would make a separate language of Macedonian, different from the other Greek dialects. In fact, it ought to be interpreted as a secondary and relatively recent change within Greek, which had only partially run its course, as becomes apparent from the coexistence of forms with voiced as well as unvoiced consonants also in the case of the simple unvoiced stop (cf. Κλεοπάτρα-Γλευπάτρα, Βάλακρος-Βάλαγρος, Κερτίμμας-Κερδίμμας, Κυδίας-Γυδίας, Κραστωνία-Γραστωνία, Γορτυνία-Γορδυνία), but also from the presence of “hypercorrect” forms (cf. ὑπρισθῆναι=ὑβρισθῆναι, κλυκυτάτῃ=γλυκυτάτῃ, τάκρυν=δάκρυν). This tendency to voice the unvoiced consonants was undoubtedly impeded after the introduction of Attic koine as the administrative language of the Macedonian state and only accidentally and sporadically left traces in the written records, especially in the case of local terms and proper names which had no correspondents and, consequently, no model in the official idiom. In the second article published the same year I collected examples of forms with voiced and unvoiced sounds inherited from Indo-European voiced “aspirates” and was able to identify the complete series of feminine proper names with a voiced labial formed on the stem of φίλος: Βίλα, Βιλίστα, Βιλιστίχη parallel to Φίλα, Φιλίστα, Φιλιστίχη. These names presenting a voiced consonant, rendered by a beta, formed according to the rules of Greek, and the Greek etymology of which was beyond doubt, convinced me that the explanation of the phenomenon should be sought within that language.\n\nThe third article, written jointly by Cl. Brixhe and Anna Panayotou, who was then preparing a thesis on the Greek language of the inscriptions found in Macedonia on the basis of the epigraphic documentation collected at KERA, followed another orientation. – Whereas new evidence did not leave them in any doubt that the Macedonian of historical times spoken by Philip II and Alexander the Great was a Greek dialect, they contended that, besides this Macedonian, there had formerly existed another language in which the Indo-European “aspirates” had become voiced stops and that this language had provided the proper names and the appellatives presenting voiced stops instead of the unvoiced stops of Greek, for instance Βερενίκα and Βάλακρος instead of Φερενίκα and Φάλακρος. These ideas were later developed and completed in a chapter devoted to Macedonian and published in a collective volume. In this paper Cl. Brixhe and Anna Panayotou identified this other language that according to them had disappeared before the end of the fifth century B.C., not before playing “a not insignificant part in the genesis of the Macedonian entity”, with the language of the Brygians or Phrygians of Europe. Such was the beginning of a long controversy in the form of articles, communications to congresses and also private correspondence, which, as far as I am concerned, was particularly enriching, because it gave me the opportunity to refine my arguments. Their objection, at first sight reasonable, to wit that a form such as Βερενίκα cannot be the product of the voicing of the first phoneme of Φερενίκα, for the “aspirate’ stop /ph/ has no voiced correspondent in Greek, obliged me to examine their postulate on the conservative character of the pronunciation of the consonants and, in a more general way, of the Attic koine spoken in Macedonia. With the help of documents such as the deeds of sale from Amphipolis and the Chalkidike and of the boundary ordinance from Mygdonia, I was able to show that by the middle of the fourth century in Northern Greece – the ancient “aspirate” stops written with the help of the signs φ,θ,χ had already lost their occlusion and had become spirants, that is to say they were formed by the simple contraction instead of the complete occlusion of the respiratory ducts; – the ancient voiced stops written with the help of the signs β, δ, γ were pronounced, without any phonological significance, as spirants as well as stops, according to the phonetic context, just like in modern Castillian (ἄνδρες-πόδες; cf. andar-querido). This contention is proved by “errors” such as βεφαίως in a mid-fourth century B.C. deed of sale from Amphipolis, which cannot be explained unless phi, pronounced like an f, indicated the unvoiced correspondent of the phoneme pronounced like a v and written with the help of the letter beta. On the other hand, I drew attention to a series of allegedly “Brygian” terms – since they are found in Macedonian proper names presenting voiced consonants as reflexes of Indo-European voiced “aspirates” – which, however, showed a suspicious likeness with Greek words not only in their stems, but also in their\n\nderivation and composition. Thus, if we accept the Brygian theory, the name of the fifth Macedonian month Ξανδικός presupposes the existence of a Brygian adjectif xandos parallel to Greek ξανθός; likewise the Macedonian personal name Γαιτέας a Brygian substantive gaita (mane) parallel to Greek χαίτα (χαίτη); the Macedonian personal name Βουλομάγα a Brygian substantive maga parallel to Greek μάχα (μάχη); the Macedonian personal name Σταδμέας a Brygian substantive stadmos parallel to Greek σταθμός; the Macedonian personal names Βίλος, Βίλα, Βίλιστος, Βιλίστα a Brygian stem bil- parallel to Greek phil- and also Brygian rules of derivation identical to the Greek ones responsible for the formation of the superlative φίλιστος, φιλίστα (φιλίστη) and of the corresponding personal names Φίλιστος, Φιλίστα (Φιλίστη); the compound Macedonian personal names Βερενίκα and Βουλομάγα not only the Brygian substantives nika, bulon, maga and the verb bero parallel to Greek νίκα, φῦλον, μάχα, φέρω, but on top of that rules of composition identical to the Greek ones responsible for the formation of the corresponding Greek personal names Φερενίκα and Φυλομάχη. However, the Brygian language reconstituted in this manner is not credible, for it looks suspiciously like Greek in disguise. Finally, a series of observations 1) on the names of the Macedonian months, 2) on the use of the patronymic adjective, and 3) on a neglected piece of evidence for the Macedonian speech, induced me to reconsider the connexion between Macedonian and the Thessalian dialects. 1) The Macedonian calendar plays a significant role in the Brygian theory, because according to the latter’s supporters it testified the “undeniable cultural influence” of the Phrygian people in the formation of the Macedonian ethnos. They particularly refer to the months Audnaios, Xandikos, Gorpiaios and Hyperberetaios, which according to them can find no explanation in Greek. – In fact, the different variants of the first month (Αὐδωναῖος, Αὐδυναῖος, Αὐδναῖος, Ἀϊδωναῖος) leave no doubt that the original form is ἈFιδωναῖος, which derives from the name of Hades, “the invisible” (a-wid-) and followed two different evolutions: on the one hand ἈFιδωναῖος>Αὐδωναῖος>Αὐδυναῖος>Αὐδναῖος, with the disappearence of the closed vowel /i/ and the vocalisation of the semivowel /w/ and, later, with the closing of the long vowel /o:/ into /u/ (written –υ-) and finally with the disappearence of this closed vowel, and, on the other hand ἈFιδωναῖος> Ἀϊδωναῖος, with the simple loss of intervocalic /w/. – The case of Xandikos is even clearer. It was felt as a simple dialectal variant within the Greek language, as is ap"
