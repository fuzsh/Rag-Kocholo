        "text": "In case you don't know, Overly Sarcastic Productions is a youtube channel in which the creators opine on various topics like pop culture and history through their animated avatars, Red and Blue. I like quite a few of their videos, though more Red's Trope Talk series than the History/Classics Summarized videos Blue puts out. I'm not a trained expert on ancient warfare, but it's been a persistent side interest; regardless, if I can see problems this deep in Blue's Classical Warfare video, well, that's not a good sign. Blue mentions late Bronze Age and Mid-Republic Roman warfare as well, but the focus of this is on land warfare in Classical Greece. I'm also not going to go line by line or timestamp, but I'll throw up some block quotes; the order is a bit nonlinear, so just bear with me.\n\nBriefly, the video presents a largely outdated and deeply flawed portrayal of Classical Greek warfare, ranging from major issues of basic chronology and foundational characteristics to more minor details of combat and equipment. At its core, Blue depicts Greek warfare since the Archaic period primarily as a limited, honest, and conventionalized contest of farmers over farmland, in which two orderly phalanxes of hoplites met in battle, where they pushed and shoved until one gave way. While this view still has stalwart defenders in Victor Davis Hanson, Donald Kagan, and Gregory Viggiano, more recent scholarship has demonstrated the fundamental weakness of this characterization.\n\nAll the stuff I mentioned above holds true for the hundreds of Greek battles that you haven't heard of, mostly in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and also probably 8th centuries. The famous ones are famous because they were special cases with a lot riding on the outcome of the battle, -usually because of Persia was involved- so they were much more intense, and a lot more people died in them.\n\nBlue's vision of Greek battle is highly schematized, which he attempts to justify through a weak 'argument from silence.' The (many) battles we have record of that did not fit this scheme were recorded, so the idea goes, precisely because they were atypical and worthy of note; most battles of the 7th-4th centuries would have fit the conventional mold. However, this argument lacks force in light of the general dearth of concrete information before the ~sixth century B.C. There really isn't much extant evidence for a limited 'agonal' battle as the norm. Herodotos composed his history in roughly the mid fifth century; Marathon in 490 B.C. is in many ways the first Greek battle for which we have a detailed description, still in living memory when it was described. The Greeks had a slippery grasp of their archaic history, and battle is no exception.\n\nIn the approximate aftermath of Bronze Age warfare, we got the development of classical Greek warfare, which is the phalanx combat you may instinctively think of. Most Greek soldiers were actually farmers the other 99% of the time, so they wouldn't have had a lot of extra time to train for combat beyond the basics of equipment handling and formations. In a world where no city wanted to start an empire or anything (for another couple hundred years, cough cough Athens), most people in cities were primarily focused with defending their own stuff or occasionally giving the neighboring cities a nudge if they happen to think their farms looked especially nice. Again, since pretty much every city in Greece with the exception of Sparta worked with a non specialized militia, the system of fighting needed to be as straightforward as possible; cue hoplite warfare.\n\nWhat evidence we do have for Archaic warfare does little to bolster Blue's view of highly conventional Greek battle centered on a phalanx of hoplites. Both archaeological and literary evidence suggest something radically different. Blue believes that the hoplite phalanx, consisting largely of working farmers, appeared early in the Archaic period, possibly even the eighth century B.C. However, this timeframe is extremely dubious. The settlement patterns of this time are generally very centralized, and suggest a fairly extreme stratification of society into rich landowners and poor tenant farmers. In war, the working farmers would have largely been unable to afford hoplite equipment; the hoplites would have been a small minority in the army, and likely would not have numbered sufficient to form a phalanx of any useful size. It's only in the mid-late sixth century that we see widespread expansion into marginal lands that would facilitate a class of smallholders. As such, we cannot conclude that archaic armies would have greatly resembled the more familiar armies of the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars.\n\nLittle writing from the Geometric and Archaic period survives, but we are grateful for Homer and Tyrtaios, who preserve some memory of contemporary warfare in their songs. These descriptions of combat do not sound like Classical phalanxes. In Homer, the grandees ride chariots ahead of a crowded mass of light troops; there are 'front-fighters', who dash out from the mass to fight duels, strip armor, or retrieve the bodies of their friends. The heavily armed grandees are free to advance into the nomansland between masses and seek shelter in numbers as they wish; they are not fixed in any kind of battle order. While Tyrtaios does not describe the use of chariots, he does still show no assumption of a fixed formation, as he urges the heavily armed men to run to the forefront of the battle and engage the enemy at arms length.\n\nHerodotos believes the separation of the different troop types -light infantry, hoplites, and cavalry- into distinct bodies was a relatively recent invention, and a foreign one at that, attributing it to the Medes of the seventh century. It is possible the old method lived in in Sparta longer than the rest of Greece; at the battle of Plataea, the 10,000 man Spartan contingent is accompanied by 40,000 light troops, and fought together, rather than separately. It is notable that Herodotos doesn't actually use the term 'phalanx' in the technical military sense we're used to, and neither does Thucydides; credit goes to Xenophon in the fourth century. Herodotos actually doesn't ever even tell us how many ranks deep a formation of hoplites was. This suggests the formation of heavy infantry into regular ranks and files was not a longstanding practice in ancient Greece.\n\nIn classical Greek warfare most hoplites would have adopted the Corinthian style of helmet which covered the entire head these things were pretty tough to hear out of but as we'll see peripheral awareness is not super important in a hoplite battle ... Getting back to the hoplon shield itself, one distinct design feature was that the hand grip and armband were offset, so when a hoplite shield is in front of him, his right side was slightly exposed and his left side had an extra couple feet of shield sticking out. This is why the hoplite phalanx worked so well. If you put all of your soldiers together in a line the combination of all those shields ensured a solid line of defense. Almost everyone involved and it ensured that everyone would stick together because everyone was protecting each other.\n\nBlue also falls prey to many popular misconceptions regarding the hoplite panoply. By the classical period, the simple pilos helmet type had long supplanted the Corinthian style, contrary to Blue's claims that the latter fashion was typical. It is also difficult to justify the claim that Classical hoplites were particularly well armored; analysis of the panoplies dedicated at Olympia indicates that only a minority of hoplites wore armor to any great degree; many, even most would have to rely solely on their shield. To be sure, the aspis is a sturdy design, but there's nothing too special about it. Lastly, his claim that swords were a rarity in Classical Greece is puzzling; while the spear was the most iconic and common weapon, swords often appear prominently in material culture and written accounts. The Euboeans were especially famous for their use of swords, and at Plataea, Herodotos attributes great significant to the Spartans' use of swords after their spears were pulled from their grasp.\n\nI'll cut him some slack for calling Greek shields hoplons; ancient people used this term, originating as it does in the histories of Diodoros the Sicilian. Knowing that peltasts were a troop type named for their shield, he extrapolated that hoplites were as well, thus reconstructing a term we now know to be artificial, hoplon. The fact that this reconstruction felt necessary does drive home what a long period we're talking about with classical antiquity; Diodoros was certainly an ancient Greek, but by the time he was writing, hoplites as we know them were fading, as the states that formerly employed them increasingly ceased to have an independent foreign policy.\n\nApart from the name, though, Blue misconstrues the use of the aspis in combat. His claim that the shield left the warrior's right exposed is difficult to justify; hoplites are generally depicted fighting with a side-on stance, and it is easy to see that this method would allow the shield to cover the whole width of the body. His description of overlapping shields has a shaky foundation in the evidence; I'm not a Greek reader, but my understanding is that the word typically translated as overlapping shields actually means 'shields together', which is much more ambiguous, and may indeed be simply figurative; when Tyrtaios describes helmet being set against helmet, we shouldn't imagine hoplites fighting like elephants. When we look at the tactical literature of the Hellenistic period, spacing described as 'natural' for formations of pikemen is six feet per man; we can't make any ironclad conclusions from this, but it does cast doubt on the idea of very dense hoplite formations.\n\nSo what did a battle look like? Well first off the description of the phalanx should indicate that there wasn't the kind of everyone for themselves open order style of fighting that you'd find in again 300 with the phalanx. Everyone needed to stay together, which also meant that fighting with a sword was a definite no-go; you can't swing that thing with two shields in front of you. Spears of about six to eight feet were the weapon of choice for a hoplite. As for when the armies actually came to grips on the battlefield, they're still not quite a consensus yet, but a prominent theory argues that it looked like an inverse tug-of-war called othismos, most literally meaning 'pushing.' The idea is that when two hoplite lines collided they would push at each other in an attempt to get people off balance, break up the Phalanx, and open up to attack. This is partially substantiated by the design of the hoplon itself, which being curved makes it easier for the seven or more rows of hoplites behind the front line to lean forward and push morel you can't do that with a flat shield. The pushing also included some stabbing, of course, but the pushing was step one in a process to open up the enemy line to even more stabbing. After a while a few people in the Phalanx would be dead or at least injured and a few other people would get scared and tried to run. Of course, when the first handful of people run, a few more people would also run, and then a handful more people run, and just like that the entire line has collapsed in a manner of minutes or even seconds. It was customary to lightly pursue the enemy after they've broken and ran, but no one was out for blood, that was kind of frowned upon.\n\nThe shape of hoplite combat is a contentious topic, though the balance of new scholarship tends to favor the 'heretical' view. Blue, however, remains committed to the 'orthodox' model of a literal Othismos, arguing the dished shape of the Argive shield was necessary for files of men to make their collective pushes. In general, I find this characterization unconvincing. For one, hoplites were largely spearmen (this is a little fuzzy depending on timeframe; in the Archaic period, it's possible that many were armed with two javelins and a sword); a spear's primary advantage is reach, and would be of little use if the expectation was to fight at 'bad breath' distance. One piece of evidence trotted out by the literalists is a passage from Polybios (18.30), which states\n\nThese rear ranks, however, during an advance, press forward those in front by the weight of their bodies; and thus make the charge very forcible, and at the same time render it impossible for the front ranks to face about.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that here, Polybios is describing the pike-armed phalanx of the Macedonians, not the Classical hoplite phalanx. These men carried small shields supposedly unsuited for this kind of pushing, and very long spears. Moreover, they were subject to far more drill than hoplites, and attained a high degree of professionalism. It is absurd to imagine them fighting in 'rugby scrum' style with this armament, and it is difficult to justify applying this passage to the Classical period. Second, this method would mean the deeper formation had a more or less overwhelming advantage in pushing power, when we know for a fact that thinner formations often defeated deeper ones, such as the first battle of Syracuse during the Sicilian expedition, when the Athenians drove off a Syracusan phalanx arrayed in deeper order. Thirdly, the tight formation discipline and leadership necessary for coordinated pushes like this would not have existed in Classical Greek armies; the neat ranks and files of the army drawn up in phalanx array would evaporate even at a walk, much less the dead sprint with which most hoplites met their enemy. Blue mentioned earlier that Greek militias would have had little time for training outside basic formation drill; this is actually an overstatement, as all but the Spartans would have had no training whatsoever. One of Sparta's notable advantages was their ability to preserve formation by marching in time; the fact that this was considered worthy of writing down is very illustrative of Greek expectations for hoplite formations.\n\nWhat should be notable from the above discussion is that it concerns hoplites almost exclusively. This should be very alarming to anyone with a passing familiarity with Greek warfare, as armies were almost never composed entirely of hoplites. Rather, light troops and cavalry were crucial to Greek battle. The Battle of Delium, one of the first detailed descriptions of a large, Greek vs Greek battle in 424 B.C., wasn't decided by the clash of hoplites, but by the cavalry of the Thebans. Hoplites were exceedingly vulnerable to these 'fast troops' in almost every terrain if they were not properly supported; light troops accompanied hoplites almost everywhere, to the point historians generally assume a 1:1 ratio if not otherwise stated. This exclusionary focus on hoplites allows him to paint the picture of Greek warfare as a low-skill affair (see below); while this may have been true for hoplites, it is emphatically not the case for the light troops and cavalry.\n\nThe campaign of Pylos, in which an unsupported Spartan phalanx surrendered to light armed rowers is probably the most powerful demonstration of the hoplite's helplessness against faster troops, but other examples abound, not least of which would be Iphikrates's victory at Lecheum. In the Battle of Spartolos, the Chalkidian hoplites failed against Athenian hoplites, but their peltasts and cavalry defeated their Athenian opponents; after receiving reinforcements, these troops ran circles around the hoplites, stringing the Athenians out with their retreats and harrassing them with missiles and cavalry charges until they panicked and fled the field. Agesilaos of Sparta complained during his campaign in Asia Minor that his lack of cavalry forced him 'to make war by running away' against the Persians; Plutarch writes admiringly that he was soon very glad to acquire a body of proper cavalry to protect his 'worthless hoplites'.\n\nWhat's generally really nice about hoplite combat is that the casualties were super low by most standards; since heavily pursuing an enemy was actively discouraged, only about 10 percent of the fighters in a given battle were injured or killed, because the second it starts looking bad for one side or the other, boom, just like that it's over, done. The battle was in many ways a formality; in my opinion, it's primarily a test of will. \"Is this farmland really worth it to you?\" If it was, you stayed, and if it wasn't, you fled. For most hoplites, it was a contest of raw strength and will; the emphasis can't possibly be on individual dueling prowess when you're fighting in a phalanx like that.\n\nLastly, the idea that Greek warfare deliberately limited casualties simply cannot be sustained in light of overwhelming contrary evidence. First of all, in many cases the armies on the field represented the whole male citizenry able to bear arms; a blow against them struck the heart of the city. The battle of Sepeia in 494 BC is a very telling case study. The Spartans overran the Argive camp while they ate breakfast; they then chased the survivors into a grove sacred to the gods, luring them out one by one with lies they had been ransomed. When the Argives discovered what was happening, the Spartans burned down the grove, killing 6,000 men; this was likely their whole army. The extermination of this force supposedly caused a political revolution in the city, as so many of the ruling class were killed.\n\nWhile most Greek battles were not quite this destructive, Greek armies were extremely bloodthirsty; they took positive joy in slaughtering their fleeing enemies, and chased the defeated army as long as they had strength to follow. I mentioned Spartalos and Delium earlier; in the former, the Athenians lost as many as 40% of their army to pursuing cavalry, and the Thebans at Delium harried the Athenians until nightfall. There was no discouragement to pursue the enemy; when Roel Konijnendijk tabulated the battle descriptions that survive, a sizable majority of them record an aggressive sustained pursuit. The essence of battle is destruction; one offers or accepts battle because one wants to see the enemy force destroyed. This can only really be achieved against an enemy who has been broken by panic. Rather than a 'foul' in the sport of war, the slaughter of fleeing enemies in the greatest number possible was goal of Greek battle. Greek warfare was not some 'absurd conspiracy' of farmers; it was a serious means to a serious end, playing for the highest stakes imaginable. The losers risked the slaughter and enslavement of their whole community. While this was extreme, many states lost their political independence as a result of defeat; it was common for losers to be stripped of their walls. This was in many ways a symbolic undoing of the city, as many urban centers had only come into being after their walls.\n\nThis brings me, at long last, to probably the biggest problem with the video; this is its myopic focus on battle. For some time, scholars puzzled over the supposed paradox of Greek warfare, that a country so well suited to fortifications and light infantry would develop a way of war centered on heavy infantry battle in the rare spots of open ground. However, a careful look at the sources will reveal that the Greeks did in fact develop a way of war perfectly suited to their environment. The Persian Wars demonstrate how the Greeks really fought. They fight behind fortifications in geographic bottlenecks, like Thermopylae or the Isthmus of Corinth, or retreat to broken ground like at Plataea. They deceive the enemy and attack by surprise at Sardis and Salamis and Marathon. These are not one-offs either; the Phokian wall the allied army defended had been built to defend against other Greeks, and the fortifications of the Corinthian Isthmus played key roles in future Greek wars. The Athenians developed a chain of fortifications guarding the approaches to Attika; these would slow the enemy while the people evacuated behind the Long Walls, and once the enemy made it to the plain, they would be harried by the Athenian cavalry, limiting the damage they could inflict. When southern Greeks invaded Thessaly, they had to retreat after mere days; they could not forage for food with the sun-hatted barons riding down their foragers. Open battles were undoubtedly important in Classical Greek warfare, but they were only one means to an end. They were not fought for their own sake. Victory in battle gave the winner unhampered access to the hinterland of the enemy; the very existence of a city depended on its access to grain, harvested or imported. Oftentimes, this was the real objective of the army. The Peloponnesian War is an interesting case study.\n\nThe core strategy for Sparta was not the destruction of the Athenian army on the field, though they would have welcomed the opportunity, and seized it in Sicily; it was the economic strangulation of their enemy. They marched through Attika, burning as they went; they encouraged the revolt of their empire, cutting off their main source of revenue; they established a fortress at Dekelea, where they prevented the Athenians from using their land and giving refuge to their escaped slaves; they occupied the Hellespont and cut off grain shipments from the Black Sea. They applied this strategy because it had worked for them before; they invaded the country of their enemies and laid waste to their fields until the whole community was threatened by hunger. The type of pitched battle Blue puts at the center of Greek warfare was not simply not necessary. On Athens' end, they sought to force Sparta to acknowledge them as an equal, not by fighting a pitched battle to show their superior courage, but by demonstrating superior cunning with their naval raids and victories at sea, and by demonstrating to Greece that they could repay the Spartans for whatever harm they inflicted on them or their allies, and that Spartans could not help their friends as Athens could. Along the way, the two engaged in every form of military activity conceivable, from devastation, to naval raiding, to sieges, to ambush, to blockades, to battle. To depict Classical warfare purely through the lens of pitched battle between hoplites alone is profoundly misleading.\n\nThese are the first books and articles that come to mind for a more complete view of Classical Warfare.\n\nFernando Echeverria \"Hoplite and Phalanx in Archaic and Classical Greece: A Reassessment\"\n\nArthur M.
