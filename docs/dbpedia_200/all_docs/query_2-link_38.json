His lexicon of places and concepts cited by Athenian orators, is sadly incomplete but with tantalizing historical tidbits.\n\nEvent Date: 2016\n\n§ a1 Abaris: A proper name. When a plague, they say, had arisen throughout the whole inhabited world, Apollo responded to both Greeks and barbarians, when they asked, that the Athenian people was to make prayers on behalf of all. And when many nations were sending embassies to them, they say that Abaris also came, an ambassador from the Hyperboreans. The time in which he was present is disputed. For Hippostratos says that he was present in the 53rd Olympiad, while Pindar (says that it was) in the time of Kroisos, king of the Lydians, and others (that it was) in the 21st Olympiad.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a2 Abios: Antiphon applied \"abios\" to one who has acquired a great livelihood, as Homer calls a much-wooded wood \"axylos\".\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a3 Abrokomas: This man was a satrap of Artaxerxes, king of the Persians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a4 Agatharchos: Demosthenes mentions him, and he was a distinguished painter, son of Eudemos, and Samian by descent.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a5 Agathes tyches neos (temple of Agathe Tyche): Lykourgos mentions this in On Administration, and others (do too).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a6 Agasikles: Hyperides speaks about Agasikles. A speech against him has been written by Deinarchos also, in which it has been shown that he bribed the demesmen of Halimous collectively and that, owing to this, though he was an alien, he was enrolled in the politeia (as a citizen).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a7 Agoi: This denotes many things. Isaios took it for 'to bear' and 'to lead in' and 'to drag,' in the so-titled \"For Eumathes, removal to freedom\" saying thus: \"Xenokles injured me by removing Eumathes to freedom, when I was leading him into slavery for my own part.\" And many times in the speech he used the word for the same sense. But Antiphon, in On Truth, says, \"may(?) he 'hold' the laws great,\" instead of 'may(?) he think.' There is much use of this (sense).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a8 Agelaion: (belonging to the common herd): Isokrates in Panathenaikos meant, as it were, the many itinerant sophists. The metaphor is from herd animals, which graze in whatever places they happen to come to, or from fish, which they say feed copiously in schools (herds).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a9 Agenes: For 'apais' (childless), in Isaios, in On the Estate of Menekles.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a10 Agesilaos: This man was, as Xenophon shows, a distinguished and noble king of the Lakedaimonians, and he overturned much of Asia, using the soldiers who joined Cyrus on the anabasis (expedition up country).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a11 Aglauros: The daughter of Kekrops. And it is also a given name of Athena.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a12 Hagneuete ten polin (purify the city): Antiphon in his second speech, for 'hagnizete' (purify).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a13 Hagnias: Isaios in Against Eukleides concerning land. Androtion, in book five of the Atthis, says of him and his fellow ambassadors — Philochoros does too — that they were both caught and killed by Lakedaimonians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a14 Hagnous: A deme of the tribe Akamantis. The demesman was an Hagnousios. Demosthenes in For Ktesiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a15 Agnomonos (senselessly): For 'alogistos' (foolishly) and 'aboulos' (thoughtlessly): Demosthenes in the Phillipics.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a16 Agoras (gatherings): Hyperides in Against Polyeuktos concerning the Diagramma: \"They often hold gatherings.\" Perhaps for 'synodoi' (assemblies) (as we say) now. The word denotes also other things.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a17 Agoranomoi: The magistrates in the agora who administer sales: Demosthenes in Against Timokrates. And Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians says that five were apportioned to Peiraieus and five to the city.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a18 Agorasai: For 'onesasthai' (to purchase): Hyperides in Deliakos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a19 Agraphiou: A type of action, so called, against those who owe the public treasury and, on account of this, have been registered, but then have been erased before paying off (the debt). Demosthenes or Deinarchos show that this was so in Against Theokrines; also Lykourgos in Against Aristogeiton; and still further, Pytheas in his defense against the indictment.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a20 Agrious (wild): Aischines in Against Timarchos says that those who are exceedingly impassioned with pursuit of boys and are severe pederasts (are \"wild\"). And Menander says that one who is zealous about dicing is a wild dicer.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a21 Agryle: A deme of the tribe Erechtheis, and a demesman is an Agryleus, and the adverb of place (is) 'Agrylethen' (from Agryle).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a22 Aguias (street): Demosthenes in Against Meidias: \"to hold choruses according to ancestral custom and to fill the street with savor.\" Some accent with the acute, treating it as feminine, like τὰς ὁδούς (the roads). But it is better to use circumflex as if from ἀγυιεύς. An aguieus is a pillar ending in a point, which they set in front of their doors, as Aristophanes, in the Wasps, and Eupolis make clear. They say that these are particular to Apollo, but others say to Dionysos, and others say to both. The complete (i.e. uncontracted) form is ἀγυιέας and according to the Attic dialect ἀγυιᾶς, as they say 'Steirias' and 'Melias' and the like, with contraction. Aristophanes in the Birds: \"slaughter sheep on sacrificial hearths; and fill the street with the savor.\" They say that this is particular to the Dorians, as Dieuchidas makes clear in the third book of the Megarika. But the altars in front of people's houses could be what are called among Attic speakers aguieis, as Kratinos and Menander say. Also Sophokles, in Laokoon, translating the Athenians' customs to Troy, says, \"And the roadside altar shines with fire, wafting drops of myrrh, exotic fragrances.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a23 Agyrrhios: This man was a not undistinguished demagogue; Demosthenes in Against Timokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a24 Agonian (contest): To contend: Isokrates in Antidosis.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a25 Agoniontes (struggling): For 'contending' in the same author in Panegyrikos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a26 Adeetos: For 'not in need of' in Antiphon On Truth book 1.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a27 Adelphizein: For 'to call brother' in Isokrates in Aiginetikos, and in Hekataios of Miletos in book two of Genealogies, and in Strattis, and in Apollophanes in Iphigeron.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a28 Ademonouses (being troubled): Being at a loss.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a29 Adephagous trieres (hungry triremes): Lysias in the diamartyria For Eukritos, if the speech is genuine, and Philistos (writes), \"hungry pentekonter.\" They could mean 'on full pay' and 'spending a lot.' It seems to be said by way of metaphor from full-grown racehorses, which are accustomed \"to eat their fill,\" according to the poet. Alkaios in Tragecomedy called lamps that consume a lot 'hungry.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a30 Adiastaton (without break): Not yet divided or separated. Antiphon said it.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a31 Adikiou: I.e. wrongdoing (adikema). It is the name of an action. One pays this simply if it is rendered before the ninth prytany. Otherwise, one pays double.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a32 Adokimastos (not approved): To be approved is to be enrolled among men, and he who is not yet enrolled is 'not approved' in Lysias in Against Demosthenes concerning guardianship, if it is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a33 Adrasteia: Some say that she is the same as Nemesis, and that she took the name from Adrastos son of Talaos, since he suffered nemesis for what he boasted against the Thebans, and then in accordance with certain oracles established a sanctuary of Nemesis, which they say was called thereafter Adrasteia's, as Antimachos shows in these (lines): \"There is a certain great goddess Nemesis, who was allotted all these things by the blessed. And Adrestos was the first to establish an altar for her beside the stream of the river Aisepos, where she has been honored and is called Adresteia.\" Some, however, say that she is different from Nemesis, as Menander and Nikostratos (do). And Demetrios of Skepsis says that Adrasteia is Artemis, established by a certain Adrastos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a34 Adynatoi: Aischines in Against Timarchos. Those who possess under three minas, and have been incapacitated with respect to the body. These people used to receive — after they were approved by the council — two obols per day, or an obol, as Aristotle says in the Constitution of the Athenians, and as Philochoros says, nine drachmas monthly. There is also a speech — so it is is said — of Lysias Concerning the Invalid, in which he has mentioned one as receiving an obol.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a35 Aei [always]: Instead of heos [until] by Antiphon the Samothracian. A frequent usage by him. Also Thucydides in his proem *** it began thus, \"so then he continues speaking to me until now\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a36 Aïdris: Ignorant.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a37 Aeilogia (continual inquiry): Always undergoing accounting and scrutiny. So Demosthenes and Isaios.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a38 Aeiesto (ever-being): Antiphon (uses this to mean) eternity and to stand always in the same (conditions), just as good fortune is also called well-being.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a39 Aerkton (unfenced): For unfortified and visible from all directions: Lysias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a40 Aetos: Of buildings, the part down along the roof, which some call a pediment. Aristophanes in the Birds: \"For we shall roof your homes with a pediment.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a41 Azenieus: Azenia is a deme of the tribe Hippothontis, and the demesman is an Azenieus. Aischines in Against Ktesiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a42 Azeteton (unexamined): Prevented from undergoing inquiry and prosecution, in Aischines in Against Ktesiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a43 Atheoretos (not to be seen): For unseen, in Antiphon in the speech On Concord.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a44 Athenodoros: Athenian by descent, a soldier: Demosthenes in the speech Against Aristokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a45 Athmoneus: Athmonia is a deme of the tribe of Kekropis, the demesman from which is an Athmoneus.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a46 Aigeion: Hero-shrine of Aigeus in Athens: Deinarchos in Against Polyeuktos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a47 Aigeidai: Demosthenes in the Funeral Speech, if it is genuine. A tribe was named Aigeis after Aigeus son of Pandion; tribesmen therefrom are Aigeidai.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a48 Aigidas ekaloun: They used to call the nets made from garlands 'aigides:' Lykourgos in On the Administration, and Nymphodoros. Herodotus in book 4 says these are called 'aigeas' by the Libyans.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a49 Aigilieus: Hypereides. Aigilia is a deme of the tribe Antiochis. The demesman from there is an Aigilieus.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a50 Aidesasthai (to be reconciled): For 'to be persuaded to change:' Lysias in Against Demosthenes concerning guardianship, if it is genuine, and Demosthenes in Against Nausimachos and Xenopeithes. And in Against Aristokrates this is also for 'atone for' and 'prevail upon.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a51 Aithalides: Aithalidai is a deme of the tribe Leontis, whose demesman is an Aithalides.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a52 Aithiopion: Name of a place in Euboia.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a53 Aikias (for battery): It is a kind of private action brought for blows, whose penalty is not delimited in the laws, but the accuser inscribes a penalty, for as much as he thinks the wrong is worth, and the jurors decide.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a54 Ainious: Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates. Ainos is a city in Thrace. Homer: \"who had come from Ainos.\" Ephoros in book 4, talking about Thracian towns, says, \"Next to these is the city of Ainos, which Greeks settled, the Alopekonnesians first, but later they brought in additional settlers from Mytilene and Kyme.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a55 Aixonesin (at Aixone): Isaios in Against Medon concerning a plot of land. The deme of Aixone belongs to the tribe Kekropis. (The demesmen) used to be ridiculed as blasphemers, whence also they used to say that to speak ill is to \"talk like an Aixonian;\" Menander in Kanephoros. Plato in On Courage says, \"I shall say nothing in response to that, though I could, lest you say that I am from Aixone.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a56 Akademeia: there were three gymnasia, the Lykeion, the Kynosarges, the Academy. It was called after the one who dedicated it, Akademos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a57 Akamantis: Demosthenes in the speech Against Boiotos concerning the name: \"having been born in the tribe Akamantis.\" This is one of the ten tribes, after Akamas son of Theseus.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a58 Akare: for 'a little bit' or 'not at all,' in Antiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a59 Akinakes: Demosthenes in Against Timokrates. It is a Persian sword. Also Anaximenes, in book one of On Alexander.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a60 Ake: this is a city in Phoinike; Demosthenes in Against Kallippos. Nikanor, who has written On Name Changes, and Kallimachos, in the Commentaries, say that what is now called Ptolemais is (Ake). But Demetrios says that, in a special sense, the acropolis of Ptolemais was previously named Ake.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a61 Akmazeis: for 'you do youths' things:' Hypereides in Against Mantitheos, Lysias in Against Nikarchos the flute-player, if it is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a62 Akritos: for indiscriminate: Demosthenes in For Ktesiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a63 Akroasthai: for 'to heed:' Antiphon in Against Philinos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a64 Akte: in a special sense a certain seaside part of Attica: Hypereides in On the Salt Fish. Whence also Aktite stone. Some also used to call Attica thus after a certain king Aktaion, others because the majority of the land is seaside.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a65 Aktia: Hyperides in On Polyeuktos Serving as General. Aktia was an ancient festival, as Kallimachos makes clear in On Festivals.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a66 Alabastothekai: Chests of perfume vases (alabastoi), which in ordinary usage they call myrrh-chests: Demosthenes in On the False Embassy. Alabastoi are flasks which it is impossible to take hold of on account of their smoothness.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a67 Alaieus: Name of a deme.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a68 Alastor: Whom one would never forget: Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon. The word (appears) often in tragedy.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a69 Aleas: Demosthenes in On the False Embassy. It is a Thessalian city and the citizens are Aleans.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a70 Alexandros: Demosthenes in the sixth of the Philippics says \"when Alexander their ancestor came as herald regarding these things.\" This is the one nicknamed Philhellene, the son of Amyntas and father of Perdikkas, and he was campaigning under Mardonios, by whom he was also sent to the Athenians with a view to requesting earth and water; but not only did they pay no attention to him, but also having threatened him exceedingly they sent him away. There is another Alexander, himself also king of the Macedonians, the elder brother of Philip, about whom Demosthenes in On The False Embassy says, \"and yet this Apollophanes was one of those who killed Alexander the brother of Philip.\" And another is Alexander the Thessalian, about whom again Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates [says] \"what about that Alexander the Thessalian?\" This one is a Pheraian, and the Athenians fought with him against the Thebans, when Pelopidas was his captive. And another [is] Alexander the Molossian, brother of Olympias the wife of Philip, whom again Demosthenes mentions in the seventh of the Philippics, if the speech is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a71 Halipedon: Some say the Peiraeus. It is also commonly known as a place which of old was sea, but has since become plain. Wherefore the first syllable is aspirated, since it is as it were \"a plain of salt\" (halos pedion). Or an even (homalon) plain, and worn smooth, that is to say, ground down (alelesmenon), as Aristophanes in The Banqueters, with smooth-breathing, \"in Alipedum.\" Some claim that the plain beside the sea is so called. Some claim that it is so named according to the fact that horses can roll (alindeisthai) themselves in it, that is, cover themselves in dust.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a72 Halimousians: Demosthenes in the appeal Against Euboulides. Halimous is a deme of the tribe Leontis, and the demesmen are Halimousians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a73 Halirrhothios: Proper name, son of Poseidon: Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a74 Alketas: King of the Molossians: Isaios in the speech On the Things Said in Macedonia. But there is also another, a subordinate commander of Alexander.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a75 Alkibiades: The son of Kleinias. But there was also another, the great-grandfather of the aforementioned, whom Lysias says in Against Alkibiades for desertion, if it is genuine, that he and his father's maternal grandfather were twice ostracized. Another is Alkibiades whom Antiphon mentions in the Defense Speech Against the Charge of Demosthenes. Some of the other orators also mention him, and the comic playwrights. And there is (Alkibiades) of Phegous, a guest-friend of Alkibiades.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a76 Alkimachos: Demosthenes in Against Euergos and Mnesiboulos. This man is a general, from Anagyrous by deme, having served as general in the war against Philip. Another is Alkimachos, a Macedonian whom Hypereides mentions in Against Demades thus: \"we made Alkimachos and Antipater Athenians and proxenoi.\" Anaximenes in the second book of On Alexander recorded his address to the people, against which he says that Demosthenes spoke.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a77 Alkmaionidai: A distinguished family at Athens, (descended) from Alkmaion.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a78 Alogian: To have no reason, but to act without reason: Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates, and Plato.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a79 Alogoi eranistai [unreckoned creditors]: Those who have never been scrutinized on their obligation in accordance with the rotating order of the names of those underwriting the eranos [loan]. Deinarchos in the eranic speech Against the Children of Patrokles.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a80 Halonnesos: A little island in the Aegean Sea: Aischines in Against Ktesiphon, as also Archemachos in book 4 of the Euboika. Also mentioning the dispute over Halonnesos is Theopompos, in book 4, and Anaximenes in book 4 of the Philippics.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a81 Alope: Lykourgos in On the Priestess. Kerkyon's daughter, from whom (came) also Poseidon's son Hippothon the namesake of the tribe Hippothontis, so Hellanikos in the second book of the Atthis and Euripides in the play of the same name [sc. the Alope] and Deinarchos in the diadikasia of the Phalereoi.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a82 Alourgopolike: What is called purple trade (porphyropolike) by us: Isaios in Against Elpagoras and Demophanes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a83 Haloa: Demosthenes in Against Neaira. The Haloa is an Attic festival, which Philochoros says was named after the fact that men then spent time around the threshing floors. He says in On Festivals that it was held in the month of Poseideon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a84 Alopeke: A deme of the tribe Antiochis. The demesman is an Alopekeus and 'Alopekethen.' Whence they were named Philochoros shows in book three.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a85 Alopekonnesos: One of the cities in Cherrhonesos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a86 Amadokos: Isokrates in Philip. These were two, father and son, who also came to ally with Philip in the war against Kersobleptes. Theopompos has mentioned both in book 11 of his Philippika.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a87 Amazoneion: Isaios in Against Diokles. Concerning the Amazons' dedication at Athens, Ammonios has discussed in On Altars and Sacrifices. It is a sanctuary that the Amazons founded.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a88 Hamaxanteia: A deme of the tribe of Hippothonitis. The demesman is an Hamaxanteus.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a89 Amblothridion: the aborted foetus.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a90 Ambrakia: city in the Ambrakian Gulf, a colony of the Corinthians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a91 Hamippoi: Isaios in Temenikos. Those who campaign with horses. But some say that certain riding horses are yoked to each other, and that the one who drives them leads the one from the side and rides the other. These are called hamippoi. This is the thing (we find) in Homer: \"Leaping from one to the other.\" But the hamippoi are infantry, as is clear from the histories of Thucydides, and from Xenophon in the seventh book of the Hellenika. And perhaps they are certain advance troops arranged along with the cavalry. Philochoros at any rate in the tenth book says that they are also advance troops.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a92 Ammonis: The sacred trireme of Ammon. Deinarchos in Against Himeraios.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a93 Amorges: He is a bastard son of Pissouthnes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a94 Amorgos (mallow): It is rather similar to flax. Aischines in Against Timarchos. And the comic poets mention clothes made of mallow many times, for example Aristophanes, in Lysistrata, and Eupolis, in Cities.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a95 Amphignoein (to be doubtful/mistaken): For 'not perceiving' or 'being in doubt' concerning knowledge, as also Lysias (says) in Against Aision concerning the theft of the books, if the speech is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a96 Amphideai (bonds): They are certain leg-bands: Aristophanes in Thesmophoriazousai. And in a special sense, Lysias in Against Euthydikos says, \"being unable to break out on account of the doors having been secured with iron rings.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a97 Amphidromia: Lysias in On the Abortion, if the speech is genuine. A day used to be celebrated for newborn children, on which they used to carry the infant around the hearth, running, and from family and friends they used to receive poulps and cuttlefish.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a98 Amphiktyons: It is a Greek council, gathered at Thermopylai. It was named either after Amphiktyon son of Deukalion, because he gathered the races when he was king, as Theopompos says in book 8 (these were 12: Ionians, Dorians, Perrhaibians, Boiotians, Magnesians, Phthiotic Achaians, Melians, Dolopians, Ainianians, Delphians, Phokians), or from the fact that those who were gathered were inhabitants around Delphi, as Anaximenes says in book 1 of Hellenika.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a99 Amphipolis: Antiphon. On the Lindians' Tribute. This is a city in Thrace. It was previously called Nine Roads, as Androtion in book 12 of Atthis (says). Marsyas in Makedonika (says) that it was named Amphipolis owing to the fact that the place is inhabited all around, previously called Akra. Others: Areos Polis.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a100 Amphisbetein kai parakataballein: those who lay claim to inheritances are said to contest or lay claim with a deposit, the former denying that the inheritance was liable to decision on grounds that the deceased had a son, whether by birth or adoption, and the latter saying that, on grounds that he died childless, it was more just for them to have the inheritance than for him who received it, either because they were kin or because they were heirs in accordance with a will. So Demosthenes and Hypereides made clear concerning parakataballein (laying claim with a deposit) .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a101 Amphissa: Demosthenes in For Ktesiphon. A city in Lokris. Aristotle in the Constitution of the Opuntians says thus: \"Andraimon was the founder, and they named it Amphissa owing to the fact that the place is ringed round with mountains.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a102 Amphoteroploun: Demosthenes in Against Dionysodoros.

Kallisthenes spoke of \"anogea\", which is the preferable usage.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a109 Anagyrasios: Aischines in Against Ktesiphon. Anagyrous is a deme of the tribe Erechtheis, whence the demesman is an Anagyrasios.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a110 Anadikasthai: to bring suit anew. So Isaios.

A sanctuary of the Dioskouroi.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a117 Anakrisis (preliminary examination): examination by each magistrate, taking place before trials, concerning those who are intent on going to court.

It appears many times in the orators, for example Lysias in Against Aristodemos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a118 Anaktes kai anassai (lords and ladies): Isokrates in Euagoras. The orator seems to mention a certain custom in Cyprus. Aristotle at any rate says in the Constitution of the Cypriots, \"The sons and brothers of the king are called 'lords' (anaktes) and the sisters and wives 'ladies' (anassai).\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a119 Anaxagoras: A sophist, son of Hegesiboulos, from Klazomene, student of Anaximenes of Miletos. He used to be nicknamed 'Mind,' since he said that matter and mind are the guard of all things. This is the one who said that the sun is a fiery mass.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a120 Anaxibios: Lysias in the Against Thrasyboulos.

Krateros in book 5 of the Decrees says he authored the decree on Antiphon the orator. Also Andron was one of the 400.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a134 Anelousa gar ton nomom: For having overturned the law, it elected him for itself: Demosthenes in Against Androtion says (this); but since it is unclear and defective, different people interpret different ways. In the Attic (Mss?) the phrase appeared two ways, the one thus: \"for having overturned this law, it elected her,\" meaning 'for having transgressed this law, it granted a vote concerning it(self), as to whether it should crown it(self);' and the other: \"for having overturned this law, it elected that man, taking him for itself.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a135 Anemytas: Demosthenes in For Ktesiphon. He is Theban by descent.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a136 Anepopteutos: Hypereides in For Phryne. One who has not become an epoptes (viewer). What it is 'to have become an epoptes' Philochoros shows in book ten: \"This man wrongs all of the sacred things, both the mystika and the epoptika,\" and again, \"Thus, it was a peculiar thing for Demetrios, compared to the others, that he alone was both initiated and at the same time became an epoptes and that the ancestral times of the initiation were moved (for him).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a137 Aneskeuasanto (they dismantled themselves): what is called 'being wrecked in one's life,' that is, to come undone and as it were give up.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a138 Aneton (set free): for 'sacred' and 'devoted' to a god: Hyperides in Deliakos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a139 Anechaitise (reared up/overthrew): Demosthenes in the Philippics, for 'beat back' or 'overturned', by way of metaphor from horses.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a140 Anekei (reaches): in Antiphon, On Truth book 1, for simple 'has come,' or else for example, 'went up' and 'has come forward.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a141 Antheia: that she is a prostitute is clear. But perhaps it should be written 'Anteia' with tau, since we find it thus in Lysias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a142 Anthemokritos: Isaios in Against Kalydon refers to \"the bath that is near Anthemokritos' statue,\" that is to say near the Thriasian Gate. This man was a herald of the Athenians, but he was slain by the Megarians for forbidding them from working the sacred land of the two goddesses.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a143 Anthemous: a Macedonian city, and those from it (are) Anthemountians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a144 Anthesterion: This is the eighth month among the Athenians, sacred to Dionysos.

There was a pair of copiests (checkers?), one for the financial administration as Philochoros says, and the other for the boule as Aristotle (says) in the Constitution of the Athenians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a154 Antigraphe: in a special sense in settlements of inheritances it is called an 'antigraphe' whenever one claims, on grounds that the decedent is childless, that the estate belongs to oneself by family relation or gift. But in general, in public suits and private, the litigants' documents, which they submitted concerning the matter, both those of the prosecutor and those of the defendant, (are called) an antigraphe — and the witness testimonies. Demosthenes, Against Stephanos, and Hypereides. Plato in the Apology of Socrates calls the same thing 'antomosia' (affidavit) and 'antigraphe.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a155 Antithesis: Isokrates in Panathenaikos. Antithesis is a figure of speech in which opposites oppose one another, either by part or on the whole — by part, as Demosthenes (says) in For Ktesiphon: \"You used to teach letters, but I went to school,\" and so forth; on the whole, everything relating to everything, as the same Demosthenes, in Against Meidias, (says) from \"he anyway (was struck) by a friend\" up to \"(it was necessary) to enter because I was choregos.\" The same figure is also called \"antitheton\", as Aischines (says) in the defense On the Embassy.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a156 Antikyra: Lysias in Against Medon. Perhaps it is a nickname. Antiphanes in On Prostitutes says, \"They called (her) Antikyra because she used to drink with men who were wild and crazy. Others (say it was) because Nikostratos the doctor left her much hellebore when he died.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a157 Antiochis: name of a tribe.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a158 Antiphon: one of the ten orators, son of Sophilos and from the deme Rhamnous.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a159 Antipater: son of Iolaos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a160 Antissa: Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates.

So it is called when the prosecutors and defendants used to swear, the former that they would accuse truthfully and the latter that they would defend themselves truthfully.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a163 Anorthiazon (they were shouting aloud): Andokides. For 'they were speaking, shouting shrilly.' Homer: \"Standing there, the goddess issued a great and terrible cry, shrilly, to the Achaeans, and into each man's heart she put great strength to wage war and to battle unceasingly.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a164 Axioi (he thinks fit): for 'he thinks:' Antiphon, On Hybris against a Free Boy, and Lysias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a165 Axiochos: a dialogue called Axiochos was written by Aischines the Socratic.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a166 Axoni (on the axle): the laws of Solon were written on wooden (tablets rotating on) axles. Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates: \"as has been said on the axle.\" They were, as Polemon says in Against Eratosthenes, four-sided in shape and they are kept in the prytaneion, written on all their parts. Sometimes they create a three-sided appearance, whenever they incline to the narrow point of the angle.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a167 Aopta: for 'unseen' and 'not seen, but having seemed to be seen': Antiphon, On Truth book 1.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a168 Apage (arrest!): For 'use apagoge' (arrest). Apagoge is a type of action: Demosthenes in Against Konon. The word has derived from 'carrying off' and 'being carried off' as applied to wrong-doers. And they used to be carried off to the Eleven.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a169 Apagoreuein (to bid farewell to, give up doing): for 'to be distressed' or 'to be unable': Lysias in Erotikos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a170 Apathe (without suffering, feeling, sense, emotion): for 'those experiences that did not truly happen': Antiphon, On Truth book 1.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a171 Aparithmon (reckoning up): for 'tallying a sum:' Isokrates, in Philip.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a172 Apartilogia (even number): Lysias in Against Aresandros and Herodotos for a number that is complete and full.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a173 Apatouria: Demosthenes in Against Boiotos. It is a festival among Athenians, which they celebrate in Pyanepsion over four days, as say those who have written on festivals. Many have told whence it got its name, including Ephoros in book two: namely on account of the treachery (apate) concerning the boundaries (horia), because when Athenians were waging war against Boiotians over the region called Melania, Melanthos, the king of the Athenians, slew Xanthos, the king of the Thebans, fighting in single combat, having deceived him.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a174 Apeipein (to decline): for 'to tire' and 'be unable:' Antiphon in On the Lindians' Tribute. Also for 'to reject' in the same author.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a175 Apergasamenos (having completed): for 'having repaid from the work that one did:' Isaios in Against Apollodoros.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a176 Apeschoinismenos (having been roped off): Demosthenes in Against Aristogeiton 1 for 'having been closed off.' For whenever the council roped itself around, as he says, then everyone else was 'roped off.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a177 Apeloemenos (having been threshed): That which has been collected from the threshing floor after having been threshed, i.e. trod upon: Demosthenes in Against Phainippos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a178 Apecheian (enmity): for hatred: Lysias, Against Medon, and Deinarchos Against Kephisokles.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a179 Apillein (to bar): Lysias in Against Theomnestos, if it is genuine, \"it is considered (to mean) 'to exclude.'\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a180 Apistein: for 'disobey:' Antiphon, Against Laispodios, Isokrates in the Letter to Philip. They also call disobedience 'apistia,' as (does) Demosthenes in the ninth of the Philippics, and many others.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a181 Haplas: Demosthenes, Against Konon. Kallistratos says that single-soled (types) of sandals are so called. Strattis, in Lemnomeda: \"to buy yourself sandals from among the single-soled.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a182 Apobates and apobainein and apobatic wheels: Deinarchos, Against Phormisios and in the Defense against Antiphanes, Lykourgos in the Defence Against Demades. The apobates is an equestrian competition, and apobainein is to compete in the apobates, and apobatic wheels are from this competition. What happened in it is explained by Theophrastos in the 20th book of the Laws. The only Greeks who practised it, he says, were the Athenians and Boiotians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a183 Apographe (declaration): Whenever one says that someone has something that belongs to the city, the accuser makes a declaration, showing whence the person has the property and how much it is. Perhaps the apographe is also a type of action. For if one should deny that one has (the property), then a suit was brought for apographe on grounds that the apographe had not been done correctly. Demosthenes, Against Androtion. What the risk was for the one making the apographe, becomes clear in Demosthenes' Against Nikostratos on the slaves of Arethousios, if it is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a184 Apodektai: the receivers are an office among Athenians, which the orators and the comic poets mention many times. Aristotle, in the Constitution of the Athenians, has shown that there were ten, and that having received the records (of debt), they erase money paid in the presence of the council in the bouleuterion and return the records back to the public secretary. And he clarifies simply what they do. That the receivers were appointed by Kleisthenes in place of the kolakretai Androtion book 2 (shows).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a185 Apodidomenoi: Antiphon in On the Samothracians' Tribute for 'returning' (active voice). And then he says \"we give back\" (middle voice) either for 'we give away' or for 'we sell.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a186 Apoikia (colony): in a special sense, the documents according to which people emigrate some named thus.

Aristophanes in Tagenistai: \"of which your brother at any rate did not obtain a portion.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a191 Apoleloipotes (having left behind): for 'having won.' The metaphor is from runners. For those who win leave behind those who are beaten. Isokrates in Panathenaikos and Panegyrikos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a192 Apolexis: one of the 10 commissioners, whom Plato makes fun of in Sophists.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a193 Apomatton (wiping off): Demosthenes in For Ktesiphon. Some understand it plainly for 'wiping away' and 'cleaning oneself,' but others more elaborately, as 'plastering clay and bran on those being initiated,' as we say 'to wipe the statue with clay': for they used to anoint with clay and bran the initiates, imitating the stories told in myths according to some, that the Titans hurt Dionysus by plastering themselves with gypsum to avoid being recognized. (They say) that then this custom has ceased, but that later people smeared themselves with mud for tradition's sake. Sophocles in Aichmalotides: \"purifier of the army and experienced in rites of cleaning\" and again: \"and most skilled wiper-off of great misfortunes.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a194 Apollo patroios ho Pythios (Ancestral Apollo Pythios): is an appellation of the god, one of many others that also exist. Athenians commonly honor Apollo as Patroios after Ion. For when he settled Attica, as Aristotle says, the Athenians were called Ionians and Apollo was named 'patroios' by them.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a195 Apomisthoi (unpaid): those who do not receive pay: Demosthenes, in the Philippics and in Against Aristokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a196 Apo misthomaton (from rents): Didymos the Grammarian says this for 'from the sanctuaries' income.' For to each god, they used to apportion measures of land, from which, when it was let, the expenditures for the sacrifices used to come. For they did not used to sacrifice the victims out of piety, but as contractors.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a197 Aponome (distribution): apportionment, as when the city takes a share of the returns from the mines, or as when people divide up contractors into many so that each receives a share: Deinarchos in Against the Children of Lykourgos, many times.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a198 Apopephasmenon (having been declared): for 'having been displayed' and 'having been made clear.' So Deinarchos and Lysias and Demosthenes, Against Neaira: \"they sell themselves clearly\" for 'openly.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a199 Apopompas (averting): Isokrates, Phillip. Some gods used to be called 'apotropaic,' concerning whom Apollodoros, in book six of On Gods, has discussed.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a200 Aporrexantes (having offered part of): 'having apportioned,' 'having given a portion:' Isaios in the supporting speech For Nikias. It appears also in comedy.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a201 Aporreta: Things not to be spoken in the laws. Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon. What things it was forbidden to say to each other, Lysias has shown in Against Theomnestos, if the speech is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a202 Aporotatos: for 'one to whom it is impossible to find access.' Isaios in his For Mnesaios' Daughter.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a203 Aposaxanta: Deinarchos, for \"having stopped up the hole and filled it.\" [Herodotus in book 6.] .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a204 Apostasiou (for departure): There is an action granted against freedmen to those who freed them, if they depart from them or register another as prostates (protector), and if they do not do what the laws bid; and those who are convicted must become slaves, while those who win (the case) shall be finally free thenceforth. It appears many times in the orators, in Lysias in Against Aristodemos and in Hyperides in Against Demetrias for Apostasiou. Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians, concerning the polemarch writes this: \"he introduces cases for apostasiou and aprostasiou and for inheritances and epikleroi.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a205 Apostesamenon: for 'receiving for the scale:' Demosthenes in Against Timotheos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a206 Apostoleis (dispatchers): those appointed in charge of sending forth the triremes. Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon, and Philochoros in book 7. And dispatches (apostoloi) are the sending forth of the ships: the same orator in the first of the Philippics.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a207 Apostrophen: for 'refuge,' Demosthenes in the Philippics.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a208 Apotaxis: separate assessment of those who had previously been assessed jointly with each other for payment of the designated tribute. Antiphon in On the Samothracians' Tribute.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a209 Apotimetai kai apotimema kai apotiman kai ta ap' auton (evaluators and evaluated security and to evaluate and things derived therefrom): Those who lease the houses of orphans from the archon used to furnish securities for the lease, and it was necessary for the archon to send out individuals to evaluate the securities. Thus, the securities evaluated used to be called 'evaluated securities' (apotimemata), and those sent to evaluate (were called) 'evaluators' (apotimetai), and the action (was called) 'to evaluate' (apotiman). People then were also accustomed, if her relatives should give a dowry to a woman when she was getting married, to request from her husband some security, as it were, worth the sum of the dowry, such as a house or land. The one who gave the 'evaluated security' was said, in the active voice, 'to give an evaluated security' (apotiman), and the one who received it (was said) 'to have an evaluated security given to him.' The same principle applies also to other debts: Demosthenes in the second speech Against Onetor and Lysias in Against Diogenes on the lease of a house, if it is genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a210 Apotaphos: for 'deprived of one's ancestral tombs;' Deinarchos in the impeachment Against Agasikles.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a211 Apoteichisai: to cut off with a wall and shut out from exit. One who has been cut off and shut out by a wall is 'walled off.' Antiphon in the defense against the public charge of Demosthenes, and Thucydides.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a212 Apo tou pragmatos: for 'far from it,' Demosthenes, Against Androtion.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a213 Apophasis: to declare in writing, part by part, how much property one has, which happens especially in antidosis proceedings. Demosthenes in Against Phainippos many times. Once only he called the same thing 'apographe' (declaration).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a214 Apophoran (removal): For 'take away and make a space between:' Isaios in Against the Orgeones, in which he says thus, \"if in fact they determined with these removals of boundary stones that the land is another's.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a215 Apopsephisontai: for 'they condemn him to not be a citizen': Deinarchos in Against Archestratos. And Demosthenes calls the act 'apopsephisis' (disfranchisement) in the appeal Against Euboulides.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a216 Aprobouleuton: a decree that is not first brought to the Council but is introduced directly to the people. In Against Androtion a law is mentioned that shows this.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a217 Aproskleton: (a suit) that has not been brought as a result of a summons, Hyperides in Against Athenogenes (II).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a218 Aprostasiou (lack of prostates): a type of action against metics who do not have a prostates. For each used to select for himself someone from among the citizens to serve as prostates concerning all private and public matters. Hypereides in the second speech Against Aristagora for aprostasiou.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a219 Aproton: Deinarchos in Against Pytheas: \"when the orators jumped like aprotoi into the port.\" Perhaps a scribal error, and one must write \"like pirates.\" And in some (copies) it has been written \"like parnopes.\" But parnopes are a type of locust.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a220 Araphenios: Isaios in Against Elpagoras and Demophanes. It is a deme of the tribe Ageis.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a221 Argas: Aischines On Restitution. It is more plausible to say that Dorians, particularly Argives, used to call a snake \"argas\", as Achaios does in Adrastos. But Timachidas the Rhodian says that a snake was not called \"argas\" in their tongue, but that it was a kind of snake. It is likely, then, that Demosthenes was called a snake on account of his savagery since he sued his guardians over their guardianship. The same man also likens these sorts of people to snakes in Against Aristogeiton. In the Attic authors, however, it had been written as \"harpax.\" But some say that \"argas\" used to be an epithet for a snake.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a222 Argoura: Demosthenes Against Meidias. It is a city of Euboia lying in the Chalkidic territory, as Aristotle the Chalkidian says in On Euboia.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a223 Argyriotheke (money chest): Deinarchos in Against Proxenos for damages. There were two kinds of grammateidia which the Athenians used, some for writing something in them only, others also for depositing money, which they also used to call chests, and the others also (they used to call) diptychs.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a224 Arguritis ge kai chrysitis: land which yields gold and silver when worked.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a225 Argyrokopeion: Antiphon in Against Nikokles.

This was set up in the Parthenon of Athena.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a228 Argaios: Demosthenes in Against Aristokrates. Concerning this man Theopompos also says in book 1 of the Philippika, \"they call Archelaos both Argaios and Pausanias.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a229 Ariobarzanes: after having been appointed satrap of Phrygia, this man revolted from Artaxerxes, who, after having sent a force to make war on him and having overpowered him, crucified him.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a230 Ardettos: Lysias in Against Elpine. A place at Athens above the Panathenaic stadium, by the deme of Agryle Hypenerthen. In this (place), they say, all Athenians used to swear publicly the heliastic oath. It was named after the ancient hero Ardettos, who first administered the oath to the Athenians. Theophrastos in his books On Laws shows that this custom had been dissolved.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a231 Arete (virtue): For 'good reputation;' Andokides and Thucydides, in book 1.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a232 Arthmios: Proper name, a slave of a certain king.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a233 Aristeus: This is also a proper name.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a234 Aristylla: She was a sister of Aristogeiton.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a235 Aristion: Hypereides, Against Demosthenes. This man is a Samian or a Plataian, as Diyllos says, and, from the age of a young man, a companion of Demosthenes, and he was sent by him to Hephaistion for sake of reconciliation, as Marsyas says in book five of On Alexander.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a236 Arkteusai (to be a bear): Lysias in For Phrynichos' Daughter, if it is genuine; the consecration of girls, before marriage, to Artemis Mounychia or Brauronia. Things that point toward the preceding have been said by others and by Krateros in the Psephismata (Decrees). That maidens who play bear are called 'arktoi' (bears), Euripides, in Hypsipyle, and Aristophanes, in the Lemnian Women and Lysistrata, (show).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a237 Arktouros kai Arktophylax: the one named Bootes. Lysias in Against Philippos for guardianship, but in a special sense the star below its belt. Aratos and Hesiod, in the Works, show.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a238 Arkyoros (netwatcher): Lykourgos in the impeachment against Menesaichmos.

Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a240 Arrephorein: Deinarchos, Against Pytheas. Four Arrephoroi used to be elected, according to good birth, and two were selected who began weaving the peplos and the other things concerning it. And they used to wear white clothing. And if they put on gold things, these became sacred.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a241 Artemisia: Demosthenes on the Freedom of the Rhodians. There were two of these women, Carian by descent and both queens. The first was in the Persian Wars, and was the daughter of Lygdamis, whom Herodotus also mentions. The younger one, whom Demosthenes mentions, was the daughter of Hekatomnos and the wife and sister of Mausolos, whom Theopompos says died having been taken by a wasting sickness owing to grief for her dead brother and husband Mausolos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a242 Artemision: in a particular sense, the statue of Artemis: Hyperides, in Deliakos. A promontory of Euboia is also called by this name, as Demosthenes [does] in For Ktesiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a243 Arrybas: son of Alketas, and king of the Molossians. Demosthenes in the Philippics.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a244 Archairesiazein: to think oneself worthy of being chosen for a magistracy. Deinarchos in Against Polyeuktos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a245 Archaios (archaically): Isokrates in the Panegyrikos: \"to relate ancient matters in a newfangled way and to speak about recent events archaically.\" Some say that it means 'in an old-fashioned way,' that is, to use rather old-fashioned words. Ephoros in the first book of Histories explained in a way. He says that recent authors talk about ancient events in detail. \"For where it concerns events that have happened in our time,\" he says, \"we consider those who speak most accurately most trustworthy, but where it concerns ancient affairs we think those who discourse this way most unworthy of trust, because we suspect that it is likely that neither all of the events nor the majority of the speeches are remembered to so great an extent.\" Demosthenes in the Philippics says \"they were so old-fashioned, or rather civic-minded\" for 'simple'.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a246 Arche andra deiknusi (office reveals a man): Demosthenes in Rhetorical Preludes. Sophokles then, in the elegiacs, says that this is a saying of Solon, and Theophrastos, in On Proverbs, and Aristotle (say that it is a saying) of Bias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a247 Archen iasthai poly loion e teleuten (much better to heal a beginning than an end): Another proverb. And it shows that it is necessary rather to attempt to prevent terrible things when they are starting then when they are at their peak or completed.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a248 Archidameios polemos (Archidamian war): Lysias in Against Androtion and Deinarchos, Against Pytheas for xenia. The first ten years of the Peloponnesian War were called the Archidameian War, as it seems, after Archidamos' invasion of Attika, as Thucydides and Ephoros and Anaximenes say.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a249 Asemanta (unmarked): What are called by us 'unsealed.' For they used to call seals 'marks' (semeia): Hyperides in Against Antias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a250 Aspasia: Lysias in the speech against Aischines the Socratic, whose dialogue was titled Aspasia. And also mentioning her many times are the other Socratics as well, and Plato in the Menexenos says that Sokrates learned politics from her. She was by descent Milesian and skilled at speaking. They say that she was both teacher and, at the same time, a beloved of Perikles. She seems to have been the cause of two wars, the Samian and the Peloponnesian, as it is possible to learn from Douris of Samos and Theophrastos, from the fourth book of Politika, and from Aristophanes' Acharnians. Perikles seems also to have had from her his homonymous bastard son, Perikles, as Eupolis indicates in Demes. After she married the demagogue Lysikles, she had Poristes, as the Socratic Aischines says.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a251 Astathmetotaton: concerning which no one could conjecture or estimate what at some point one has in mind or what one will do: Demosthenes in On the False Embassy.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a252 Astikton chorion: that which was not hypothecated to a lender; for whenever it is hypothecated, the lender was accustomed to show this through documents that lay upon the site. The same thing also happens in the case of a dwelling. Lysias in the Against Aischines the Socratic.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a253 Astrabe: the mule. Demosthenes in Against Meidias. And perhaps also any draught animal on which people ride was so called.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a254 Astynomos: Demosthenes Against Timokrates. Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians says that the astynomoi were ten, five in Peiraieus, five in the city. He says that they took care concerning flute-girls and female harpists and dung collectors and such.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a255 Asynthetotaton (most unbound by covenant): Demosthenes in On the False Embassy applied the word to a mob, or for 'most untrustworthy' and 'most unreliable' and 'not making guarantees owing to unreliability', or 'not agreeing' and 'discordant.' For compacts are agreements. Or for 'most unintelligent,' that is 'most senseless. Or for one whom a person just could not comprehend what in the world he has in mind: Homer: \"And you, take heed and listen to me.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a256 Atarneus: a little town lying opposite from Lesbos; Isokrates in Panegyrikos, Herodotos in book 6.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a257 Atechnos: pronounced with a circumflex on the last syllable for \"clearly\" or \"certainly\" or \"surely\" or \"evidently\", and with an acute accent on the second to last syllable for \"carelessly\" and \"without skill.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a258 Atimetos agon kai timetos (suit without assessed penalty and with assessed penalty): A suit with assessed penalty is one for which a penalty does not lie defined in accordance with the laws, but it was necessary for the jurors to assess what (a convicted defendant) must suffer or pay. The suit without assessed penalty, by contrast, is one to which a penalty defined in accordance with the laws attached, so that the jurors were not required to choose an assessment. Aischines, Against Kteiphon; Demosthenes, Against Meidias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a259 Atimos (disfranchised/outlaw): Demosthenes applied this word in a special sense in the Philippics, that is to say, whomever one is not subject to penalty for having killed. For, talking about Arthmios, he says that the Athenians decreed that he was hostile and an enemy of the people of Athens and its allies, both himself and his kin, and that he be 'atimos.' Next, he adduces it, as if explaining: \"But this is not what a person would so call 'atimia' (disfranchisement). For what was it to the man from Zeleia if he was to have no share in the common matters of the Athenians? But it has been written in the homicide laws, concerning whatever (the law/lawmaker) does not permit prosecution for homicide: 'and as an outlaw' (atimos), it says, 'let him be killed.' This in fact means that he who has killed any such man is to be free from pollution.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a260 Atta: for 'as many' or 'whichever,' Antiphon in On the Lindians' Tribute; and for 'some' or 'some sort,' Demosthenes in the Philippics. But in some cases atta is redundant. [\"Inquire when the swallow appears.\"] .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a261 Attes: Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon. Attes is particularly venerated by the Phrygians, as the attendant of the Mother of the Gods. Neanthes has written about him, but the account is mystic.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a262 Attikois grammasin (in Attic letters): Demosthenes, Against Neaira, for 'in ancient (letters).' For the alphabet of 24 letters was at some late date discovered among the Ionians. Theopompos in the 25th book of the Philippika says that the treaty with the barbarian was fabricated, which (he says) was inscribed on a stele not in Attic letters, but in those of the Ionians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a263 Authentes ('perpetrator'): Lysias in For Erathosthenes. In Against Isodomos he applied it in a special sense to the Thirty, who effected their homicides through others. For 'perpetrator' always indicates the one who acts with his own hand.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a264 Auleios: the house-door that is first from the road, as Menander shows.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a265 Aulia: Lysias in Against Diodotos and Aischines, Against Ktesiphon, either for 'farm buildings' or for 'small courtyards.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a266 Aulizomenoi: for 'going to bed,' Antiphon in On Concord.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a267 Autodikein: for 'determining what is just for oneselves,' Deinarchos in Against Kleomedon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a268 Autokleides: Aischines, Against Timarchos: \"Kedonides and Autokleides and Thersandros.\" These were hardcore pederasts, as Aristogeiton also (says in) Against Timarchos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a269 Au: Demosthenes, for 'again' in Against Aphobos 1.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a270 Autolekythoi: Demosthenes in Against Konon. Either for 'certain men being girt up and ready to do and to endure whatever,' or for 'poor and possessing nothing besides lekythoi,' or 'laborers,' or for 'those ready for blows and as it were striking and whipping and doing violence.' Or it could mean those giving money readily and ready for intercourse. For they also used to keep money in their lekythoi. The word is also in Menander in Heniochos and Daktylios. That they used to keep money in lekythoi sometimes, Diphilos (shows) in Apobates. And that having broken the lekythos they used to use the thong for whipping, Menander (shows) in his Trophonios.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a271 Autolykos: There is a speech of Lykourgos Against Autolykos the Areopagite. He was convicted of having removed his family to safety during the Chaironea events, and the jurors convicted him, as the same orator shows in Against Leokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a272 Automachein (to fight/plead for oneself): To go to court by oneself but not (assisted) by another, such as if one refers to a seller, one declares that the suit is against him; and if one furnishes a man who affirms by diamartyria that the suit is inadmissible, then he himself no longer contests, but the contest is with the one who affirmed by diamartyria. Lysias in Against Eukles for ejectment from property.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a273 Autochthones ('native'): The Athenians. Demosthenes in On the False Embassy: \"You alone of all are autochthonous.\" Apollodoros in On Gods says that they were called autochthonous, since they were the first to work the land (chthon), that is, the earth, when it was idle. Others (say) that it was because they were not immigrants. Pindar and the author of the Danais say that Erichthonios and Hephaistos appeared out of the earth. The Arcadians were also autochthonous, as Hellanikos says, and the Aiginetans and Thebans.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a274 Aphairesis (removal): Said in a special sense, '(removal) to freedom:' Hypereides in Against Aristagora.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a275 Aphareus: this man was the son of Hippias, but was considered the son of Isokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a276 Aphanes ousia kai phanera (invisible and visible wealth): The invisible kind is in money and slaves and equipment, but the visible kind is in land: Lysias in Against Hippotherses.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a277 Apheis kai apallaxas (having released and discharged): \"Released\" whenever one lets another off from the charges which he was bringing against him, but \"discharged\" whenever one persuades the one making the charge to withdraw and charge him no longer: Demosthenes in the counter-suit For Phormio. It is also possible to put it this way: that one releases (a person) only from the things that one charges, while one discharges, whenever one reserves for oneself no further argument against the one charged. Demosthenes in the countersuit For Phormio: \"in order that he may have from you a valid discharge.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a278 Apheis ten hyperan ton poda diokei (letting go of the brace he chases the sheets): Hyperides in On the Salt Fish (I). A proverb applying to those who let go of the more important things and waste time on the trivial things. Braces are ships' ropes, with which the boom is shifted.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a279 Aph' Hestias myeisthai (to be initiated from the Hearth/Hestia): Isaios in Against Kalydon. A man 'initiated from the Hearth' was an Athenian in any case. And having obtained this by lot, he was initiated.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a280 Aphorme (beginning): Whenever one gives money on deposit, it is called 'starting capital,' in a special sense among the Attic orators.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a281 Aphosio (I dedicate): for 'I purify,' 'I consecrate:' Aischines, Against Ktesiphon. Isaios said, in Against Hermon, that to do something not perfectly but, as it were, for form's sake, was to 'do it perfunctorily.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a282 Aphrodision: in a special sense the seat of Aphrodite.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a283 Aphyas: Hyperides, Against Aristagora. It is also a name of two women hetairai, sisters.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ a284 Axaristein: for 'not showing gratitude.' So Antiphon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b1 Balbisin (at the starting lines): Antiphon, On Concord, for 'at the beginnings.' Said after (i.e. taken from) runners. For the line that is under the hysplex (starting gate) — on account of the fact that the runners set foot upon it — is called the balbis.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b2 Barathron (pit): A ditch into which they used to cast those who were condemned to death. Demosthenes in the Philippics says this not properly, but by way of metaphor, as if to say, 'in a state of ruin.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b3 Basanos (touchstone / torture): Antiphon. So called is the stone on which gold is tested by being rubbed against it. Hypereides in Against Antias called things that were said during torture by those being tortured, and copied down, basanoi (testimony under torture).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b4 Royal race: the race that took place in the presence of the king, who is one of the nine magistrates at Athens, appears to be called the royal race. Deinarchos, Against Pytheas.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b5 Basileos stoa (Royal Stoa): Demosthenes in Against Aristogeiton I.

The word is common with this meaning in Attic authors.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b8 Batalos: Aischines in On the False Embassy. He is ridiculed in comedy for effeminacy. Eupolis calls the anus 'batalos.' Perhaps, then, it's from this that they call kinaidoi 'bataloi.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b9 Baubo: a woman's name.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b10 Bebaioseos (for warranty): Is a name for an action that those who have purchased something bring against him who has sold it, if a third party has a dispute over the item sold, and the latter (i.e. the seller) does not warrant it. And sometimes, also when earnest money alone has been given and the one who has sold disputed (the transaction), then the one who gave the earnest money used to bring the action for warranty against the one who received it. Lysias in two speeches.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b11 Besaies (men from Besa): Lysias in the defense Against Philocrates over a contract: Besa is a deme of the tribe Antiochis.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b12 Biaion (for violence): Name of an action against those who do something by force. The one who is convicted pays a fine to the treasury equal to the amount [that he pays] to the victor. Demosthenes, Against Meidias. There are also speeches for violence circulating in the Lysiac corpus. And it is clear that neither the word nor the action was used only in the case of the corruption of virgins, but also for other (wrongs).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b13 Blimazein (to squeeze): to press with the hands. Also to press honeycombs is called 'blisai' (to take honey).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b14 Boedromia: Demosthenes in the Philippics. A festival so called at Athens, which Philochoros in book two says was celebrated since Ion son of Xouthos, with great zeal, helped Athenians when war was waged against them by Eumolpos son of Poseidon, when Erechtheus was king. For to 'bring help' (boethein) was called 'boedromein' (hasten to help), that is, to rush into battle.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b15 Bothynos: in a special sense, a place so called on the Sacred Way. Isaios mentions the place in Against Hermon concerning a surety as does Kallisthenes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b16 Boleones (dung heaps): The place where dung is cast is called a boleon (dung heap). Nikandros in book 3 of Attic Dialect (applies) \"'dung heaps' to the fields, into which the dung is carried.\" So Deinarchos and Philemon and others.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b17 Bombylios: a creature similar to a bee, named after 'bombos' (humming).

Deinarchos and Aristophanes in Thesmophoriazousai.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b20 Bouleuseos: The name of a charge applied to two circumstances. The one is whenever someone by plot arranges death for someone else, whether the person plotted against dies or not, and the other whenever someone, being registered as indebted to the public treasury, sues someone on the grounds that he has registered him unlawfully. For the former, then, Isaios is a witness, in the speech Against Eukleides, when he says that the trials occurred in the Palladion, but Deinarchos in Against Pistias (says that they trials occurred) on the Areopagos. Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians agrees with Isaios. About the other charge: Demosthenes in the first speech Against Aristogeiton. But Hyperides in the first speech against Athenogenes, has used the word in a special sense applying to a trap and deception in regard to money.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b21 Boutades: Bouteia is a deme of the Oineis tribe, whose demesmen are Boutadai .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b22 Boutes: This man held the priesthood.

It is a festival among Athenians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b24 Boucheta: Demosthenes in the seventh of the Philippics. It is a city of Epeiros, said in the neuter plural, which Philostephanos in Epeirotika says was named on account of the fact that Themis came there riding on an ox, during the flood of Deukalion.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b25 Boones: Demosthenes in the Against Meidios says the Boones was distinguished and the greatest offices were conferred on him.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b26 Brytidai: Name of an Attic genos: Demosthenes in Against Neaira.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ b27 Bomolocheuesthai: Those called 'bomolochoi' (altar-ambushers) are principally the ones who sit under the altar at sacrifices and beg with flattery, but also the flautists and seers employed at sacrifices. Pherekrates in Tyranny: \"And then, in order that we, since we are always lurking next to the altars on all sides, not be called bomolochoi, Zeus made a very great smoke-hole.\" By way of metaphor from these, certain people, easily satisfied and lowly and submitting to anything whatsoever with a view to profit through jesting and mocking, used to be called 'bomolochoi.' Aristophanes in Gerytades: \"You jest and you mock us and you altar-ambush.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g1 Galepsos: Antiphon, Against Laispodios. A Thracian city, as the writers of itineraries say. It was named after Galepsos of Thasos and Telephe, as Marsyas the Younger says in the fifth book of the Makedonika.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g2 Gamelia: Demosthenes in the Appeal against Euboulides, and Isaios. Didymos the grammarian in his commentary on Isaios says that the gamelia was given to phratores at weddings, citing a speech of Panodemos in which nothing of the sort is written. In his Commentaries on Demosthenes, the same scholar says instead that gamelia is the introduction of women to the phratores, citing no evidence for this explanation.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g3 Ganos kai Ganiada: Aischines, Against Ktesiphon. They are Thracian localities, as Artemidoros (says).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g4 Geisipous kai geisipodisma kai geisipodizein: The projecting part of the beam on which the cornice (geison) is, is called a 'cornice foot' (geisipous) and 'cornice footing' (geisipodisma), and to make this is 'to make a cornice foot' (geisipodizein): Isaios in Against the Orgeones.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g5 Gennetai: Those who share the same clan. For when all the citizens were divided part by part, the first and greatest parts were called tribes, and each tribe was divided three ways, and each part of these was called a trittys and and a phratry. And in turn each of the phratries was divided into 30 clans, from which the priesthoods that belong to each were allotted. The word appears among many of the orators, for example Demosthenes in the Appeal Against Euboulides. Isaios in On the Estate of Apollodoros called clansmen 'kinsmen.' However, those who were kin simply and by blood were not called clansmen and from the same clan, but rather those who were originally distributed into the named clans. Philochoros in the fourth book says that those whom they now call gennetai were previously called homogalaktes (raised on the same milk).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g6 Gerarai: the women who are consecrated to Dionysos. Demosthenes in Against Neaira.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g7 Geraneia: Lysias, in the Epitaphios. It is a mountain of the Megarid, as Dieuchidas (says).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g8 Gerra (screens): Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon: \"they drove out those in the stalls throughout the agora and torched their gerra.\" Gerra are a kind of Persian military equipment, as Herodotos also says: but already, by misuse, also any covering, whether made of skin or from some other material, used to be called 'gerron.' Here at any rate Demosthenes says that the stalls' coverings and curtains were torched to prevent people gathering around the goods in the agora and holding discussions in the presence of any others. In Against Neaira, if it is genuine, he says thus: \"And the law bids the prytaneis set up the voting urns and give the voting pebble to the people as they approach, before the aliens enter and they take down the gerra.\" So, either the same is in For Ktesiphon or some such must be understood, that the voting pebble was given by the prytaneis in the presence of the citizens in the assembly before the aliens entered and before the fences were taken down, that is before the assembly was opened up to any who wished to speak.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g9 Geophanion: land in which there is a mine in the ground. On the geophanion on Samos, Ephoros has shown in the ninth book in what manner it was found.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g10 Gepedon (plot of land): Deinarchos in Against Stephanos. The ground is 'gepedon,' just as also that which is composed of land and buildings is 'oikopedon' (house site). Plato anyway in book 5 of the Laws says, \"house plots and land plots that he is allotted.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g11 Glaukos: proper name, Karystian by descent.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g12 Glykera: a courtesan.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g13 Gnosis (decision): for 'legal judgment,' Demosthenes in Against Aristogeiton.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g14 Gorgyra (drain): Underground ditch: Deinarchos, Aischines. It is also in Herodotos in book three.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g15 Grammateus: Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon. How the grammateus was appointed and what he did, that he was in charge of the documents, looked after decrees that were passed, kept records of everything else and was based near the Boule, has been explained by Aristotle in the Athenian Constitution.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g16 Grapheus: used for 'painter' (zographos), Demosthenes, Against Meidias. And they used to call painting 'graphein.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g17 Graphe: The word for a public suit. Not only whenever someone accuses a decree or law is he said to have a graphe paranomon (public suit for unlawful measure) rendered and filed, but also applying to many other wrongs, whenever one makes a charge either publicly or on grounds that it applies to the public itself. The word appears often in the orators. Demosthenes, Against Konon.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g18 Grypanion [wrinkled]: Antiphon, On Truth 2 \"For it makes the ground burn and, as it melts together, grypanion [wrinkled].\" and Melanthios in book 2 of the Attic history, talking about when an earthquake happened, says \"and the ground egrypen [wrinkled].\" Thus Dionysios son of Tryphon in On Names says \"'grypainein' is 'to be made wrinkled', like the soft bark strips whenever we fold them and then release them.\" Perhaps then the authors indicate that some kind of foldedness happens to the ground during earthquakes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g19 Gryllos: Hypereides in Against Epikles concerning a house. Gryllos and Diodoros were sons of Xenophon the Socratic. He (Gryllos) died fighting at Mantinea.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g20 Gylios: a plaited soldier's pack, into which one's essentials were placed, as Aristophanes shows, for example, in his Peace.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g21 Gylippos: proper name, a Lakedaimonian.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g22 Gylon: a proper name.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ g23 Goniasmos: Lysias in Against Lysitheos, \"as one turns along the wall, council members, there is a corner on the left and quite a lot of wide open space.\" Also Aristophanes in the Frogs: \"and introductions of fine rules and mitered edges of words.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d1 Daidalos' creations.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d2 Daeira: a proper name.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d3 Damon: a proper name, teacher to Perikles.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d4 Daochos: Demosthenes, For Ktesiphon. He is one of those who betrayed the Thessalians' affairs to Philip.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d5 Dareikos (daric): Lysias in Against Eratosthenes, one of the Thirty. Darics are gold staters, and one was worth the same as what, among the Attic writers, is called the chrysous [gold coin]. They were called Darics not, as most think, after Dareios, the father of Xerxes, but after another more ancient king. Some say that the Daric is worth 20 silver drachmas, so that 5 Darics are worth a mina of silver.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d6 Dateisthai (to distribute): To apportion, and the distributors (datetai) are apportioners. \"To a choice of distributors\" is a kind of action. For whenever people shared with each other and some wished to divvy up the common goods but others did not, the willing used to sue the unwilling, summoning them \"to a choice of distributors:\" Lysias in Against Alexidemos, if it is genuine, and Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d7 Datos: it is a city of Thrace, very fortunate. Thus, after this city a proverb is also said: \"Datos of good things.\" About this city and the territory adjacent to it they have explained, sometimes saying neuter 'Daton' and sometimes feminine 'Datos,' as Ephoros always (does) in the fourth book. And once Theopompos (says) masculine 'Datos' in book 3 of the Philippika. The city of the Datenoi, however, had its name changed to Philippoi when Philip king of Macedon conquered it, as Ephoros says, and Philochoros in the fifth book.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d8 Deeseis [needs]: Instead of endeia [lack], Antiphon in Of Truth book one.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d9 Deigma (sample, display piece): Properly, the item that is displayed out of each of the things being sold. And furthermore a place in the emporion at Athens to which the samples used to be brought was so called. It was the Athenian habit to mark places themselves after the things in the place. Demosthenes in On the Expense of the Trierarchy and Lysias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d10 Deipnophoros [dinner-bearer]: Hypereides in the Against Demeos. It is said that the deipnophoroi are recruited now, because the mothers of the confined children used to send food for them every day to the sanctuary of Athena, where they were staying, and they agreed [to be recruited] so that each could embrace her own.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d11 Deiradiotes: Deirades is a deme of the tribe Leontis, the demesman of which is a Deiradiotes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d12 Deinoi [with skill]: instead of deinesei, Antiphon, Of Truth 2.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d13 Dekazon: Isokrates, On the Peace. What in the world this is, is clear to all. Eratosthenes in his books On Old Comedy shows whence the phenomenon came to be referred to, saying thus, \"Lykos is a hero near the lawcourts in Athens, having the shape of an animal, in front of whom those who take bribes used to gather, arrayed in groups of ten, whence a 'company of Lykos' came to be referred to.\" Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians says that Anytos introduced the bribing of the courts.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d14 Deka kai dekadouchos: Isokrates in the counter-suit Against Kallimachos: \"for the Ten who were established after the Thirty were holding office.\" About the ten men who were elected at Athens after the dismantling of the Thirty and the events thereafter Androtion has spoken in the third book. Each of the officers, however, used to be called 'one of the ten' (dekadouchos), as Lysias makes clear in On the Estate of Diogenes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d15 Dekadarchia [government of ten]: Isokrates. While the governments installed by the Lakedaimonians in the cities are constantly called dekadarchiai by historians, Isokrates is the one who more or less explained the name in his Panathenaicus; he says that Lakedaimonians made 10 men only masters of each city. But Philip never installed a dekadarchia for the Thessalians, as is written in the 6th Philippic of Demosthenes, but a tetrarchy.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d16 Dekateuein: Demosthenes, Against Androtion: \"For not by tithing themselves\" for 'exacting the tithe' and as it were 'plundering.' For things seized from their enemies they used to tithe to the gods. And since Demosthenes, in Against Medon, says about a young girl as follows, \"not to tithe her nor initiate her,\" Didymos the grammatikos, having written a book about this, says that Lysias, in On the Daughter of Phrynichos, has said that to tithe is to serve as a bear. He says, however, that to dedicate was properly called 'to tithe,' since it was Greek custom to dedicate to the gods the tenths of the revenues. But perhaps the orator has said that serving as a bear is tithing since ten-year-old girls used to serve as bears.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d17 Dekateutas (tithe farmers): For 'tax-collectors who collect the tenth:' Antiphon in the defense against the public suit of Demosthenes. That the tenth was a custom duty Demosthenes has shown in On The Tax Immunities.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d18 Dekatelogous (tithe collectors): Those who collect the tenth. The same then as the dekateutai. Demosthenes, Against Aristokrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d19 Dekeleian: The Peloponnesian War, from the final part.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d20 Delphinion: a place in Chios, as Thucydides (shows) in the 8th book. There is another Delphinion at Athens, a sanctuary of Apollo, where there was also the 'lawcourt in Delphinion.' Demosthenes in Against Boiotos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d21 Derkylidas: a Lakedaimonian king [sic].\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d22 Dermatikon: Lykourgos in the speech titled Defense of his Career in Politics. The orator would be calling the money generated from the skins that were sold 'dermatikon.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d23 Dermestes (hide-eating worm): Lysias in Against Eupeithes. Didymos explains that the worm is so called by Sophokles in Niobe, in book 7 of Words with Unclear Meaning, but Aristarchos, interpreting the Sophoclean passage interpreted it as \"serpent.\" But perhaps a dermestes would rather be one that eats hides (dermata), as is indicated in the sixth book of Aristeides' Milesiaka.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d24 Deusopoios (dyed fast): Properly, the word is said applying to purple dye that keeps its brilliance permanent and indelible, but by metaphor 'dyed fast' is also said applying to all other things that keep their color permanent and long-lived, among the old writers, as also Plato makes clear in book 4 of the Republic. Diphilos in Foster Brothers: \"There is a good dyer in the boy. For he has rendered for us completely fast-dyed swaddling clothes.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d25 Demainetos: proper name.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d26 Deliastai: the envoys who went out to Delos: Lycurgus, Against Menesaichmos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d27 Demarchos: Lysias in Against Moschos. The demarch was a magistrate. They made registers of the properties in each deme. Furthermore, the lexiarchic register resided with them, and they gathered the demes (i.e. demesmen) whenever it was necessary, and they put proposals to a vote for them. Aristotle says in the Constitution of the Athenians that they were established by Kleisthenes, having the same charge as the naukraroi before them. Aristophanes in The Women Claiming Tent-Sites shows that the demarchs used to seize securities.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d28 Demokoinos: the public torturer. Isocrates more or less explained the word in his Trapezitikos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d29 Demopoietos (citizen by adoption): One who is a foreigner by birth, but has been made a citizen by the demos. In what manner certain people become citizens by adoption Demosthenes has shown in Against Neaira, if genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d30 Demosios (public): Demosthenes, in the Philippics. They call the city's slaves 'public.' Aischines, Against Timarchos: \"a public slave person of the city.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d31 Demotele kai demotika hiera (at public expense and public rites): Used to differ from each other and from associations' ritual and clans' ritual, as Deinarchos shows in Against Stephanos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d32 Demoteuomenos (being a demesman): To be a demesman is to share in a given deme and to be named after it. Antiphon in the defense Against Philip, if is it genuine.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d33 Demophanes: proper name.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d34 Diagoreuon (stating explicitly): Isaios in Against Diokles in a special sense has used 'diagoreuon' for 'saying different things' and 'not the same things.' For among them, 'diagoreuein' is the opposite of 'synagoreuein' (to advocate / agree), just as 'sympheresthai' (to agree with) is of 'diapheresthai' (to differ from), and 'sympoliteuesthai' is of 'diapoliteuesthai' (to be a political rival), and 'symphonein' (to agree / be in harmony) is of 'diaphonein' (to be in discord).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d35 Diagramma (register): Hypereides in Against Epikles. That which is assessed in the symmories as to how much each man must contribute. The same was not assessed for all, but according to the valuation of his property. Concerning these things Hypereides has shown most clearly in Against Polyeuktos concerning a register. A diagrapheus moreover is the one appointed in the symmories to judge how much each man ought to contribute, as again the same makes obvious in Against Polyeuktos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d36 Diagraphe (specification): The description of the mines for sale (lease), showing in writing from what beginning and up to what limit they are for sale (lease).\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d37 Diagrapsasthai (to cross out): Lysias in Against Nikides, if it is genuine, for 'to remove the charge.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d38 Diadoseis (distributions): Grants that fall to one per equal division. Lysias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d39 Diakechremenon (lent to different persons): For 'lent part by part:' Demosthenes, Against Aphobos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d40 Diastasis (separation, ordering): Antiphon, On Truth book 2: \"concerning the ordering that now prevails,\" for 'ordering of the universe.' .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d41 Diagrapsantos (crossing out/writing an order): Dinarchus in Against Lycurgus. Perhaps for 'depositing and paying.' But some use it for 'reckoning (i.e. paying) through a bank,' as we say in ordinary usage.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d42 Diathesis (disposition): For 'sale:' Isokrates in Bousiris. But for 'we have rendered' Antiphon said \"we disposed\" in Against the endeixis of Kallias, and for 'arrangement' the same author in On Concord (said), \"but knowing the disposition they listen.\" Phrynichos in Tragoidoi says, \"by the disposition of the words.\" For they say the word 'to dispose' for 'to arrange.' Antiphon in On Truth 1 (says), \"stripped of a starting point, it would have disposed even many good things badly.\" 'Dispose' for 'compose:' Hypereides, Against Demosthenes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d43 Dialexis (allotment): To divide by lot/share is to to allot, and the act is 'allotment:' Antiphon in Against Philinos.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d44 Dia mesou teichous (wall through the middle): Antiphon, Against Nikokles. Inasmuch as there are three walls in Attica, as also Aristophanes says in Triphales, the north and the south and the Phaleric, the south wall used to be called \"through the middle\" of those on each side, which Plato also mentions in the Gorgias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d45 Diacheirotonia (vote between two options): Decision of a vote taking place in the assembly. Demosthenes in Against Timokrates and Against Androtion.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d46 Diamemetremene hemera (measured out day): It is a certain measure of water flowing into an aperture measured at a day. It used to be measured in the month of Poseideon. By this (measure) indeed were held the greatest trials and those concerning the greatest matters. The water used to be measured in three parts, one for the prosecutor, one for the defendant, and the third for the jurors. The orators themselves have shown these things very clearly, for example Aischines in Against Ktesiphon. Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians is instructive on these things. But one must also consider what appears in Isaios in Against Elpagoras and Demophanes, that in a measured out day, he says, sometimes the trials take place without water and sometimes (measured) against it.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d47 Diametron: the part left over from something that has been rightly measured: Deinarchos in the impeachment Against Kallisthenes.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d48 Diaskeuasasthai (to get ready): for 'pack up,' Isaios in Against Kallikrates.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d49 Diaseistous (shaken about): Aischines, Against Timarchos. They seem to have been named after being moved and shaken first, and then thrown, so that they may be rather uncorrupted. Menander, Poloumenoi.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d50 Diapsephisis (voting by ballot): It is said in a special sense, applying to the examinations in the demes, which are held concerning each of the men who are (or appear to be) demesmen, as to whether one in fact is a citizen and a demesman or has been illegally enrolled, being a foreigner: Aischines, Against Timarchos. Androtion in Atthis and Philochoros in book 6 of Atthis have discussed quite completely the diapsephiseis, how they occurred in the archonship of Archias.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d51 Diamartyria kai diamartyrein (testimony by affidavit and to affirm by affidavit): diamartyria was a manner of bringing a counter-suit. For before the case was brought to court, it was possible for anyone who wished to to affirm by diamartyria that the case was admissible or not admissible. It differs from the counter-suit in that the diamartyria is brought not only by the defendants but also by the prosecutors. And previously, at least, it used to be possible for the prosecutor to propose someone testifying that the case was admissible, and concerning this the judgment used to be made first toward him who testified, not toward him who first brought suit. But if the prosecutor should not propose a witness, then it was possible for the defendant to introduce someone testifying that the case was not admissible. And again the trial used to be held toward him who testified. They used to bring charges for false testimony by diamartyriai also, just as in testimonies: Lysias in the diamartyria Against Aristodemos, if the speech is genuine. Isaios in the (dike) apostasiou against Python says that it is not possible for aliens to testify by affidavit. Hypereides in the (graphe) aprostasiou Against Aristagora (II) says that the laws bid him who wishes to affirm by diamartyria in public actions for aprostasiou, just as against aliens and countrymen. Perhaps then aliens were barred from affirming by diamartyria in the private actions for apostasiou, but in the (public) actions for aprostasiou were not barred. Deinarchos, however, has applied 'diamartyresai' not to the man who offered the testimony himself, but to the man who furnished someone who gave the testimony in the diamartyria concerning Aristophon's daughter's not being subject to judicial decision. This orator in Against Hedyle also describes the custom of the diamartyria.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d52 Diaitetai (arbitrators): Demosthenes in Against Meidias. Arbitrators are different from jurors. For the latter used to sit in judgement in designated lawcourts and decide cases on appeal from the arbitrators. But the arbitrators — having been appointed by lot beforehand, or else after the disputants had entrusted (arbitration) to them — used to arbitrate the disputants. And if the opponents were satisfied, the action was done. If not, then after depositing in urns the plaints and the summonses and the testimonies and also still the laws and the other proofs of each party, and having sealed them, they would hand them over to the magistrates who introduce the suits. Aristotle in the Athenian Constitution speaks about them.\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d53 Diastesai (to set apart, at variance): For 'throw into confusion' and in a way 'render powerless;' Antiphon in On The Revolution. Menander in The Widow: \"Let him throw the city into confusion by shouting.\" .\n\nEvent Date: -350 GR\n\n§ d54 Didaskalos (teacher): In a special sense, they call the poets of dithyrambs or of comedies or of tragedies teachers. Antiphon in On the Choros Boy says, \"I was assigned by lot Pantakles as didaskalos.\" For that Pantakles was a poet Aristotle has shown in the Didaskaliai. The word is commo"
