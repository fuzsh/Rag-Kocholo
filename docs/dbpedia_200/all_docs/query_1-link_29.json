However, their predecessors, as well as its history and structure before its rise in the 4th c. BC, have always received less attention. But in order to get a complete picture of Makedonia’s rise and also to understand the actions of Alexander’s generals in the early years after his death, it is important to examine the political structures, ruling traditions, royal spaces of action, and forms of representation established before the Argeads’ rise to supremacy and the events they were then involved in. While many lexica of the ancient world exist, specifically of the Greek and Roman worlds and Hellenistic period, so far, there was no lexicon focusing exclusively on central aspects of the history of Makedonia from its beginning to the death of the last Argead ruler, an omission that reflects the current state of the scholarly debate. The editors wish to fill this scholarly gap and thus emphasize the importance of Argead Makedonia. Although Argead Makedonia was a late bloomer, it played a certain role in Mediterranean history prior to its rise to supremacy in the second half of the 4th c. Predominantly approaching Argead Makedonia from a historian’s angle, the lexicon addresses scholars as well as students of (Ancient) History and Classics. Its 247 entries treat the following matters: • the Argead rulers, other prominent members of their house and representatives of their leading circles, chosen allies and opponents; • aspects of Makedonia’s topography, geography, and geostrategy; • politics and representation, legitimization and dynastic image, economy and trade, army and war, court and social hierarchies, cult and religion, literature and art; • the main sources (literary, epigraphic, archaeological, and numismatic); • aspects of reception.\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe lexicon makes no claims to completeness but aims at an overview of the most relevant matters of the history of Argead Makedonia and its major political actors. Due to the loss of Makedonian historiography, our literary sources are written from a Greek or Roman perspective, thus often (mis)judging the Makedonians in accordance with their own cultural norms. Thus, as one central aim, the lexicon intends to deconstruct traditional clichés about Argead Makedonia, its rulers and inhabitants, rooted in Greek or Roman expectations or prejudices. Because of its specific focus, the entries that concern for example Greek poleis such as Thebes will not provide any general overviews on Thebes and its situation in Greece, but will exclusively concentrate on political actors and events connected with Makedonia and the Argeads. The size of the entries is chosen in accordance with their relevance for Argead Makedonia. This means that for example the entries on individual Diadochoi concern only their career under the Argeads and as far as their relationship with them is of relevance, not their career after the extinction of the dynasty. As for the time range, the lexicon begins with the mythic foundation of the Argead Empire, to be dated roughly to the middle of the 7th c. BC, and ends with the death of Alexander IV around 310 BC, for he was the last male reigning Argead, at least formally. Although after the death of Alexander III, the last factually reigning Argead, times of transformations and upheavals had already occurred, the illusion of an Argead power structure was maintained until Alexander IV was eliminated by one of Kassandros’ henchmen. As for names, the transliterated Greek form has been adopted, except for names most commonly known in the English form, namely Aegean, Alexander, Aristotle, Arrian, Lucian, Philip, Pindar, Pliny, Plutarch, Ptolemy, and Thucydides. Likewise, we have decided to keep the English form of Athens, Carthage, Chersonese, Cretans/Crete, Cretopolis, Crocus Field, Danube, Delphi, Hellespont, Peloponnese, Sicily, Thebes, Thessaly, Thrace/Thracians, and Tyre. For reasons of practicability, Plutarch’s Lives are quoted following the numeration in Perrin’s Loeb texts, not that in Ziegler’s critical edition. Arrian’s fragmentary Events after Alexander (Succ.) is quoted in accordance with the edition by Roos and Wirth, Didymos in accordance with the edition by Harding, Synkellos in accordance with the edition by Mosshammer. Besides the editors, 40 international experts of Argead Makedonia were invited to write entries. As the lexicon intends to mirror the current state of the scholarly debate on Argead Makedonia in its diversity, different positions and 8\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nIntroduction\n\narguments will occur within different entries. This is intended. The editors did not mean to strive for an artificial unity regarding the state of the debate but to demonstrate also the range of different approaches and theories. Contradictions of some entries with others are a logical result and intended to illustrate the wide range of current discussions. Thus, the contents of some entries mirror the scholarly opinion of the authors, not the opinion of the editors. Due to the problematic source situation on Argead Makedonia with often meagre contemporary evidence, questions must be left open and problems unsolved. For the editors it was more important that problems caused by the lack of evidence emerge than to create the illusion of a (false) security. Working in the field of Argead Makedonia is shown as it is: a rough, interesting, and challenging experience where often only speculation is possible, as we are missing sources to arrive at answers that in many cases will be illusionary. However, we also hope to give an insight into how instructive and fascinating research on Argead Makedonia can be. Editorial remark: If not indicated otherwise, all dates are BC.

Trogus-Justin (7.5.10) refers to a formal act of a. by an assembly of the Makedonians when in 360/59, in view of the endangered situation of Makedonia, Philip II “was compelled by the people to take the rule (conpulsus a populo regnum suscepit)” instead of his nephew → Amyntas, the son of Perdikkas III. However, the passage has its flaws. Trogus-Justin’s story that Philip served as a guardian for Amyntas for some time does not deserve credence (cf. Diod. 16.1.3). Nothing more is known about the nature and procedure of Philip’s a. The same is true for the accession of → Alexander III. Diodoros mentions that he won over the Makedonians by a tactful speech assuring them that the ruler only changed in name (17.1.2). If this speech is authentic, it may have formed part of Alexander’s a. and was delivered after his confirmation as the new ruler. Referring to the same incident, Trogus-Justin (11.1.8) speaks of a contio in which Alexander encouraged the vulgus. While Plutarch’s unique claim that after → Gaugamela in 331, Alexander was proclaimed “King of Asia” (Alex. 34.1), is sometimes thought to refer to an a., its authenticity is doubtful. There is no evidence that Alexander ever used such a title; it was no Achaimenid title and it did not refer to the full extent of his empire. Furthermore, there was no need to legitimize the Makedonian expansion achieved by military victories by any a. The first a. of an Argead explicitly described was that of Alexander’s half-brother → Arrhidaios. He was acclaimed in → Babylon in 323, after Alexander’s death (Just. 13.3.1-2; Curt. 10.7.13-15; Diod. 18.2.4). According to Justin, this a. was initiated by the infantrymen who felt outmaneuvered by the cavalrymen who had voted for the unborn baby by Alexander and → Rhoxane but chose to re­ concile with them (13.3.2-4.5). Thus, consensus was reached that Arrhidaios only formed part of a regency team together with the future → Alexander IV. Curtius whose report is coloured by Roman ideas indicates that there was only one mass meeting that chose by a. Arrhidaios who was brought before the assembled Makedonians and adorned with Alexander III’s robe. The phalanx then clashed their spears against their shields as a signal of their protection of him (10.7.15) but it is uncertain whether this was a traditional act forming part of a Makedonian a. It is supposed that on the occasion of an a., an oath of loyalty or allegiance was sworn by the Makedonians to their new ruler (Curt. 10.7.9; Diod. 18.2.4).\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n31\n\nAchaimenids\n\nHowever, its exact nature is unclear. In sum, due to the scarce evidence and lack of contemporary testimonies, the exact procedure of the Argead a. as a ritual of dynastic ideology remains uncertain. In any case, the a. served to legitimize the new ruler’s reign by at least creating the illusion of a collective approval and participation in the decision on the succession. In Argead Makedonia, there was no fixed succession process; what actually mattered was personal qualification, networks and support by the court factions. S. Müller Cf.

To secure the river’s lower section (Hdt. 4.93)—while waiting for the king’s return, the Persian fleet might well have gained control some way upstream—and the hinterland of the Greek sea ports, several route corridors from the Danubian plain south to the north Aegean had to be secured. A major role was played by the big Thracian rivers: Hebros, Nestos, Strymon and—already in → Makedonia—Axios; the next big river, the Haliakmon, is the first to enter Makedonia from the west. So the Persian strategic concept must have encompassed the mouth of the Axios and its western approaches, with Makedonia as the newly projected western border zone of the Persian Empire. Near the mouths of two of these → rivers, the Persian general in charge, Megabazos, placed military governors, at the Hebros (Doriskos, a military fort: Hdt. 7.59.1) and the Strymon (Eïon, a fortified trade post). Concerning the other two river zones, he had to find solutions that respected political frames: at the Nestos mouth, he developed a special relationship with Abdera (Hdt. 6.46-48; 8.120), a re-foundation of Ionian Teos (soon after 546, Hdt. 1.168) and therefore in contact with Persian Asia Minor. Concerning the Axios zone (→ Therme), he had to come to terms with the Makedonian ruler → Amyntas I. Following the general Persian practice (cf. Hdt. 3.15.2), he made him the offer of retaining his rule under Persian suzerainty, in the position of a Persian head of a district (Makedonōn hyparchos: Hdt. 5.20.4). 32\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAchaimenids\n\nAs chief of a Persian hyparchia he exchanged his homeland reign for a Persian function ranking below the satrap (whose function could however be expressed by the same term, e.g. Hdt. 4.166.1; 9.113.2). In Makedonian eyes, he could have kept his former authority, but hardly as a king; also for this reason we cannot call him one. On the northern Aegean coast, it was the fourth such position, controlling the west, besides those at Sestos (Hdt. 7.33: Thracian Chersonese), Doriskos (Hdt. 7.105-6: east), and Eïon (Hdt. 7.106-107: centre). To obtain it, Amyntas had to submit Makedonia as a whole to Persian rule by a formal act— handing over earth and water (Hdt. 5.17.1-18.1); by it, the land became a district of the Persian Empire. The control of further regions until that point outside Makedonia, most probably in the northern Chalkidike, might have been included in the bargain as an incentive. Moreover, Amyntas’ position within Makedonia was thus consolidated, with Persian support against internal opponents and enemies beyond the boundaries. In turn, the Persians gained with Makedonia a stronghold near unruly Thracian groups such as the Paionians, then in the middle Strymon Valley (Hdt. 5.98), and the Brygoi, then in some district near the Makedonian heartland—whence they attacked Mardonios’ troops in 493 (Hdt. 6.45—their classification as Thracians points to some eastern region, maybe in the middle Axios Valley). The fiction of the elimination of the Persian envoys just after they had received Amyntas’ submission (Hdt. 5.17-20) was devised probably during the Ionian Revolt when Paionians transferred by the Persians a decade earlier to Hellespontine Phrygia (Hdt. 5.13.1) returned to the Strymon with the insurgents’ help and cut off Makedonia (Hdt. 5.98). → Alexan­ der I who followed his father in these very years may well have attempted to style himself as an enemy to Persian rule. Allegedly to bribe another Persian commission sent to shed light on the whereabouts of the preceding one, Alexander pretended to have paid much money, and even to have given his sister Gygaia in marriage to the head of the new commission, the high-ranking Persian Boubares, Megabazos’ son (Hdt. 5.21, cf. 7.22.2). However, the marriage cannot have been arranged soon after the first commission had allegedly disappeared—indeed it had returned safely—but only around 500, after the death of Amyntas who as long as he lived was responsible for his daughter. So Gygaia was not married under pressure, but in keeping with Argead family strategy (Just. 7.3.74.2). If her husband Boubares was in charge of the strategically important Athos canal project from ca. 483 (Hdt. 7.22.2) this may indicate some affiliation with the royal Achaimenid house (as in the case of another head of the project: Hdt.\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n33\n\nAchaimenids\n\n7.117.1), albeit the couple’s son was called after his Makedonian grandfather Amyntas (Hdt. 8.136. 1), not after the Persian family branch; this does however not allow conclusions regarding rank since there might have been further children, amongst them a firstborn son named Megabazos. The Persian king alloted to Amyntas the revenues of the “important Phrygian city Alabanda” (Hdt. 8.136.1, actually located in Karia, cf. Hdt. 7.195). By his sister’s marriage, Alexan­ der became related to the Persian aristocracy which in 492 helped him to get Mardonios’ pardon for his policy during the Ionian Revolt. Makedonia’s status as a Persian hyparchia was restored then—not initiated, as Herodotos erro­ neously states (6.44.1). The former friendship will have suffered, however, causing some strain in the following years. So we may rule out that soon afterwards the Makedonian ruler was rewarded with “all the land between Mts. → Olympos and Haimos (Rhodope, not Balkan) that Xerxes submitted to his command” (Just. 7.4.1). His friendship with → Athens qualified him for the post of Xerxes’ diplomat in chief in Greece, even though his family’s origin from Peloponnesian → Argos had not yet been invented; yet it is very probable that he was at the head of a Persian delegation there in 481 (Hdt. 7.150). Negotiations and further work done in preparation of Xerxes’ invasion will have earned him his golden → akinakes, awarded by the Persian king, that he proudly shows on his early tetrobols (minted from ca. 483: Heinrichs/Müller 2008, 306, figs. 1.1-1.4 cf. pl. 1.1). Another outstanding honour for him was in 480 the Persian court’s sojourn “in Pieria for some while” (Hdt. 7.131), indeed in Alexander’s residence at → Aigai—a first-rate opportunity to build up networks with members of the Achaimenid high aristocracy. But in the night preceding the battle of Plataiai (autumn 479) he secretly changed sides by giving the Greek high command military information (Hdt. 9.44-45). He could defect openly only in 476, after Eïon had fallen (Hdt. 7.107). Kimon’s further campaign to conquer the Persian strongholds in → Thrace up to the Hellespont cut off Makedonia once more from Achaimenid Asia. Alexander had to choose now between an arrangement with the Greeks, by breaking with the A., or exile in the Persian Empire where his sister’s family would have given him a warm welcome. He decided for the Greek option, allowing him to maintain the Argead dynasty in Makedonia. After 35 years, the land ceased to be a part of the Persian Empire. It did not even border on it until → Philip II advanced to the Hellespont and the Bosporos in the late 340s: From 342/1, he controlled the Thracian Chersonese with Sestos, the Hellespontine bridgehead to Asia (Diod. 16.71.1-2); in 341/40 he besieged Perinthos 34\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAchaimenids\n\nand Byzantion that controlled the Bosporos with the northern land route (Diod. 16.74.2-76; Arr. An. 2.14.5). Artaxerxes III, allegedly in alliance with Philip (so Dareios III just after Issos, in a letter of dubious authenticity: Arr. An. 2.14.2) must have been alarmed, the more so after → Memnon and Artabazos, pre­ viously exiles in → Pella, had returned to Persian service around 345 (Diod. 16.52.3-4): they provided first hand information on power structures at Philip’s → court. At the same time, Philip made contacts to open bridgeheads to western → Asia Minor: reportedly in 342/1 with Hermeias, the tyrant of Atarneus and Assos, in southern Troad facing the isle of Lesbos ([Dem.] 10.32 with scholia, Didym. On Dem. 8.28-32; 6.39-43; → Aristotle may have brought them into touch: Diog. Laert. 5.4), and in 337/6 with Pixodaros, the Hekatomnid satrap of → Karia (Plut. Alex. 10.1-2). The Great King got rid of both of them (Diod. 16.52.5-6; Strab. 14.2.17), and in 340 he ordered the coastal satraps to support Perinthos and Byzantion (Diod. 16.75.1-2; Arr. An. 2.14. 5): Philip’s control of the western bridgeheads on either strait threatened the opposite coasts of Asia. Only in 337 did Philip announce officially to the delegates of the → Korinthian League that he was going to conquer Achaimenid Asia, allegedly in retaliation for Xerxes’ campaign 150 years ago (Diod. 16.89.2, cf. Just. 9.5.5; Curt. 3.10.8-9). In preparation, he sent in 336 a Makedonian advance force under the joint command of → Attalos and → Parmenion (and Amyntas) beyond the Hellespont (Diod. 16.91.2; Just. 9.5.8); it proceeded as far south as Miletos before it was repulsed to Abydos, the Asiatic bridgehead on the Hellespont. The city could be retained to allow for the Makedonian crossing from Sestos, in the spring of 334, under Parmenion and Philip’s son and successor → Alexander III. Also on the Persian throne a change had occurred. The new king Dareios III was going to be Alexander’s counterpart, both on the military and diplomatic fields, for the next four years up to the Persian king’s assassination; afterwards, the Makedonian-Persian dialogue shifted to a series of Alexander’s initiatives towards Persian nobles. The first battle of the campaign was fought at the → Granikos (334), without Dareios’ personal participation. Still nearly all western satraps fought there, moreover Memnon, soon afterwards appointed “commander-­inchief of the whole navy (…) and all the coast” (Arr. An. 2.1.1), and some high ranking Persian generals; at hand were cavalry contingents from eastern satrapies such as Hyrkania and Baktria, also from Persis. So at the Granikos was massed not a reinforced satrap’s force but an imperial army. Its defeat was due not to Dareios’ underrating the threat but to tactical mistakes of the Persian\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n35\n\nAchaimenids\n\ncommanders. The Makedonian progress to Kilikia, the gateway to Mesopotamia, then required a substantially stronger Persian response, under Dareios’ personal command. The subsequent Persian defeat in the → Issos plain (333), once more the consequence of a severe tactical mistake, was the more serious as the king’s family fell in Alexander’s hands and could not be ransomed. Though Alexan­der treated them respectfully according to their royal rank they were indeed his hostages (Arr. An. 2.12.3-5; Diod. 17.37.3-4; Curt. 3.8.12; 11.24-25; Plut. Alex. 21.1; Just. 11.9.12). This shifted the basis of negotiations fundamentally. There is much debate on this since our sources differ as to number, time, and content of Dareios’ offers. With the royal family in hand, Alexander could reject it. A new offer in 331, just before the battle at → Gaugamela, allegedly included “the territory west of the Euphrates (…) and one of (Dareios’) daughters as (Alexander’s) wife (…) and the legal status of a son sharing the whole kingdom” (Diod. 17.54.2, cf. Fr. Sabbaiticum, BNJ 151 F 1.5). If so much was really offered (but there are substantial doubts), precedence went to the Makedonian side: The eastern part that Dareios controlled then would have been second to the west with its access to Makedonian soldiers and Greek merce­naries, the more so as there were substantial problems in the east: a weakened Achaimenid torso empire would have been confronted with separatist activities; to crush them, Makedonian support would have been indispensible. As a result, Dareios (and his successors) would have played the role of junior partners. Yet Alexander had moved too far to accept a two-monarchs-model based on a fair balance of power of A. and Argeads. He aimed at absolute superiority (Arr. An. 2.14.7-9; Diod. 17.54.6) that was not acceptable for the Persian side. Yet Alexan­der needed Persian support to upkeep effective structures, both on the administrative and military plane. Moreover he needed the legal Achaimenid king’s standing and authority that had grown for centuries, combining substantial elements of Max Weber’s categories of “traditional / charismatic government” and amassing what Pierre Bourdieu calls “symbolic capital”. Since he would not let Dareios have real political or military competence in return, his concept was bound to fail. As after Dareios’ assassination and the execution of → Bessos—possibly himself an Achaimenid—Alexander as a foreigner was the sole monarch, the cohesion of the Achaimenid monarchy faded away though he tried to implement political continuity by paying honour to ‘good’ Achaimenid kings and by appointing high officials from the east. But these felt free from both the old monarchy that had ceased to exist, and from the new Makedonian master who had not yet sketched, 36\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAchilles\n\nlet alone consolidated, new structures when he was away in the east for years. On his return, in 324 at → Sousa, he married two royal women (Arr. An. 7.4.4, cf. Diod. 17.107.6). This aimed at dynastic legitimation and at entering family networks of the Persian nobility. But the Achaimenid dynasty finally fell when → Perdikkas did away with the Achaimenid brides in 323, to secure the rights of Alexander’s unborn child with → Rhoxane (Plut. Alex. 77.4). Without the Achaimenid royal house at Alexander’s side, his initiatives were misunderstood as further examples of his increasing orientalism. After 150 years of panhellenic propaganda (→ panhellenism), he alone could not establish the balance which a cooperation of the A. and the Argead monarchs, if only on a reasonable basis, might have achieved. J. Heinrichs Cf. Borza 1990, 98-131; Bosworth 1980, 229-30; Briant, P., Darius dans l’ombre d’ Alexan­ dre, 2003, 191-247 (engl. trans.: Darius in the Shadow of Alexander, 2015, 155-201); Müller 2019, 84-202; Olbrycht 2010.\n\nAchilles Through his mother, → Olympias, → Alexander III traced his lineage back to the hero Achilles. The Molossian royal family of → Epeiros claimed Aiakid ancestry through the union of A.’s son Neoptolemos (also known as Pyrrhos) with Andromache, Hektor’s widow (Theopomp., BNJ 115 F 335 = Pyrandros, BNJ2 504 F 1a; Eratosth., BNJ2 241 F 42; Paus. 1.11.1-2; Plut. Alex. 2.1; Plut. Pyrrh. 1.2; Just. 12.15.3). According to the later sources, Alexander prided himself on his matrilineal connection to the greatest warrior of the Trojan War at least as much as his patrilineal descent from Herakles (Diod. 17.1.5; Strab. 13.1.2 7; Vell. Pat. 1.6.5; Curt. 8.4.26; Arr. An. 4.11.6; Paus. 1.9.10). While Alexander’s Aiakid ancestry and his deliberate framing of his expedition in Homeric terms as an epic struggle between east and west that had begun with the Trojan War are well attested, the ubiquitous portrayal of Alexander as a deliberate emulator of A. must be treated with caution. The roots of this persistent tradition lie in Alexander’s exaggerated reaction to the loss of his beloved companion → Hephaistion, which along with his own premature death naturally evoked the legendary friendship of A. and Patroklos. The parallel with A. was subsequently elaborated by the source tradition and retrojected into Alexander’s campaign\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n37\n\nAegean\n\nfrom the very moment of his arrival on Asian soil, when he is supposed to have placed a garland on the tomb of A. at Troy while Hephaistion did the same for Patroklos (Arr. An. 1.12.1; Ail. VH 12.7; cf. Plut. Alex. 15.4). Alexander’s imitation of A. is therefore an enduring literary fabrication. F. Pownall Cf.

In 342, he subjugated Athens’ ally Kersobleptes in eastern → Thrace. In 340, Philip moved on to besiege Perinthos and Byzantion (Diod. 16.74.2-76.4, 77.2-3; Just. 9.1.2-6; Dem. 18.87-93; Polyain. 4.2.21). Thereby, he stirred up a hornets’ nest: Artaxerxes III, Chios, Kos, Rhodos and the Athenian fleet under the mercenary general Chares came to the aid of the besieged. As the Makedonian → fleet was too small to cut off supplies for the cities, Philip drew back (but managed to capture the Athenian grain fleet). Having established Makedonian dominion over Greece in 338, he adopted the propagandistic claim to aim at “freeing” the Ionian Greeks from the Persian dominion reestablished by the King’s Peace 387/6. Thus, the new Makedonian hegemon of Greece challenged the balance of power between Greece and Persia in the A. Obviously, Philip aimed at controlling → Asia Minor to have a constant source of income for financing future wars necessary to preserve the Makedonian hegemony. In the A., as a hegemonic force following in the footsteps of → Athens, → Sparta, and → Thebes, Makedonia was at a naval disadvantage though: Philip was the first Argead to build a (small) Makedonian fleet. His predecessors had lacked the finances and opportunity to maintain a fleet, being shut off the coast by the Athenians. In 337, after the → Korinthian League’s declaration of war against Persia, a Makedonian advance force under → Parmenion and → Attalos secured strongpoints at the coast of Asia Minor to prepare the army’s crossing (Diod. 17.24.1). Probably about the same time, Philip tried to get access to the crucial stronghold of Halikarnassos by negotiating a 38\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAegean\n\nmarital bond uniting his house and that of → Karia’s satrap Pixodaros. However, the plan was dropped. Plutarch, the only source, spins an incredible yarn about Alexander sabotaging it (Alex. 10.1-3). Apparently, the Persian king intervened by sending one of his loyal officials, Orontobates, to watch over Pixo­daros, marry the satrap’s daughter, and take over the rule when Pixodaros disappeared from the records soon after (Arr. An. 1.23.6-8; Strab. 14.2.17). The Makedonian advance force substituted regimes favourable to the Persians, such as in Chios and Ephesos, but these initial successes were reversed by → Memnon of Rhodos, Dareios III’s éminence grise in Asia Minor. He kept the Makedonians confined to a small beachhead at Abydos that, however, sufficed to ensure the army’s safe landing in 334. The reason why the superior Persian fleet failed in preventing the Makedonian crossing of the Hellespont is debated. Some scholars think that the Persian contingents had not yet returned from defeating a revolt in Egypt. Others argue that the Makedonians did not give them much chance to intervene. According to the ancient sources (Diod. 17.17.2-4; Arr. An. 1.12.810), no naval battle was planned. The satraps and commanders of the affected regions such as Arsites of Hellespontine Phrygia and Memnon were ordered to intercept the Makedonians after their landing, but failed at → Granikos (334). Perhaps Chares, who formally submitted to Alexander before Ilion (Arr. An. 1.12.1) was meant to secure this area for the Persians but was caught off guard when the Makedonians approached so swiftly. Apparently, Chares was based at his refuge at Sigeion, perhaps already having the 2000 mercenaries at his disposal with whom he garrisoned Mytilene for the Persians shortly after. After the battle of Granikos, Asia Minor’s rich satrapies fell into Makedonian hands. Memnon escaped and initiated the Persian counterattack, having a fleet of about 300 ships at his disposal. As a result, the Makedonian fleet, disbanded after Miletos’ fall for financial reasons (Diod. 17.22.5; Arr. An. 2.20.1), had to be reconstituted. While the Makedonians tried to avoid sea battles and neutralize the Persian fleet by conquering its naval bases and ships, the Persians reversed the Makedonian successes in the A. again (Curt. 3.1.19; Arr. An. 3.2.6). In spring 333, Memnon, commander-in-chief in the A. (Arr. An. 2.1.1), seized Chios. The rumor that he wanted to invade Greece to kindle revolts and involve the Makedonians in a war on two fronts (Diod. 17.29.3-4) may have been a piece of psychological warfare that at least worked on → Antipatros who hurried to secure Euboia’s coasts (Curt. 3.1.19-20). In early summer of 333, Memnon died unexpectedly while besieging Mytilene. Dareios transferred the command to Memnon’s nephew\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n39\n\nAegean\n\nPharnabazos (Curt. 3.3.1, 13.14; Arr. An. 2.1.3). Together with Autophradates, probably from an old satrapal family connected with Pharnabazos’ father, he held on to crucial bases in the A. and Western Anatolia, subsidized the Spartan revolt planned by Agis III (Arr. An. 2.13.5), and tried to cut the Makedonian communication lines in the A. It is debated whether Miletos also came shortly under Persian control again. The defeat at Issos did not stop the Persian commanders. Their strategy remained unchanged. Halikarnassos, only partially under Makedonian control, was restored for a certain time. Makedonian news that after Issos, the captive Barsine, Memnon’s widow who was also Pharnabazos’ sister, was taken by Alexander as his mistress (Plut. Alex. 21.4), may be a piece of Makedonian psychological warfare intended to demoralize Pharnabazos and his relatives, all staunch supporters of Dareios. But they carried on resisting. The fate of the Persian counterattack in the A. was sealed when → Tyre fell after 7 months of fierce resistance. Tyre’s local king Azemilkos had formed part of Auto­phradates’ camp (Arr. An. 2.15.7). Thereafter, Hegelochos and Amphoteros, the Makedonian naval commanders, re-established Makedonian control in the A. (Arr. An. 3.2.4-7). Halikarnassos was conquered, Autophradates vanished, Pharnabazos was captured at Chios, but escaped (Arr. An. 3.2.7), and reappeared in the Wars of the Diadochoi commanding a cavalry unit for → Eumenes (Plut. Eum. 7.1), his brother-in-law since the mass marriages in Sousa (324). While the Persian counteroffensive in the A. failed, it marked a crucial stage of the war and illustrated the widespread Persian networks, particularly the links to Athenian politicians and strategoi. Athens formed part of the Korinthian League and sent contingents, but individual Athenians supported the Persian side: the generals Ephialtes and Thrasyboulos assisted Memnon at Halikarnassos, Chares garrisoned Mytilene, the mercenary leader Charidemos served as Dareios’ military adviser, and until before Issos, → Demosthenes and his faction were in contact with Dareios hoping for his victory (Aischin. 3.164). The A. had not ceased to be a platform of Athens’ networks. Her former supremacy provided her with this advantage. The Makedonians had to cut these connections and establish new ones in the A. S.

As rule in Makedonia was linked to the Argeads, A.’s role as an epitropos may indicate that he was an Argead. Alternatively, for onomastic reasons, he is taken for a member of → Lynkestis’ leading house. However, as a scholiast calls Archelaos’ younger brother A. (Schol. ad Aristeid. 46.120.2); he might have been identical with A. II. According to the Makedonian ruler lists, Orestes reigned formally for about 3-4 years (Euseb. Chron. I 229; Synk. 482.27-28 Mosshammer) while predominantly A. is thought to have deposed him immediately. A.’s silver → coinage bearing the legend ΑΕΡΟΠΟ succeeded that of Archelaos and adopted parts of his iconographic program. Next to nothing is known about A.’s reign except for a quarrel with the Spartan king Agesilaos II. On the way back from his raiding campaign in Asia Minor (396-4), his request to lead his troops through Makedonia was received in a hostile way but in the end A. had to give in to him (Polyain. 2.1.17; 4.4.3; Plut. Ages. 16.2). The brief anecdotal reports make any conclusion difficult. The speculations that A. may have been involved in the Athenian and Boiotian alliances against Sparta or had links to Artaxerxes II cannot be validated. In any case, A.’s unfavourable attitude towards Sparta resembled that of the Thracian Trallians (Diod. 14.82.3; Plut. Ages. 16.1) and the Thessalians, particularly of Larisa (with whom the Argeads traditionally had close ties); at that time (Xen. Ages. 2.2). A. seems to have died of natural causes in about 395/4. While Diodoros (14.84.6) calls A.’s son → Pausanias his successor, the ruler lists name a certain → Amyntas II (Euseb. Chron. I 227; Synk. 495.12-13 Mosshammer), perhaps ruling at the same time as his rival. S. Müller Cf.

It is now identified with the modern village of Vergina, where excavations have revealed a royal palace, a theatre, a sanctuary with royal dedications, a fortified akropolis and over 2500 tombs, some with astonishing grave goods, others decorated with fine wall-paintings. Just. 7.1-2 names → Karanos as the legendary founder of A. and recounts an old superstition that the royal line would die out if the Argead kings ceased to be buried at A. The existence of royal burials at A. is documented by Plut. Pyrrh. 26.6, narrating how the Celtic mercenaries of → Pyrrhos plundered the royal tombs in 274/3. It is assumed that → Philip II was buried at A. in 336 because he was assassinated there (Diod. 16.92-94), but no ancient source mentions the location of his → burial. Alexander III was initially going to be buried at A. (Paus. 1.6.3) before his body was snatched by Ptolemy and carried to Egypt. → Philip III Arrhidaios and his wife Adea Eurydike were given a royal burial (complete with funeral games) at A. by → Kassandros in 316 (Diod. 19.52.5; Athen. 4.155A). We do not know where the last Argead, → Alexander IV, was buried, but Tomb III of the Great Tumulus at Vergina is attributed to him. No archaeological remains can be associated with the Argeads until the reign of → Alexander I. Two rich burials of the early 5th c. very likely belonged to royal → women: one contained 26 life-size clay heads that were originally carried on poles and then placed in the tomb. Another burial (of the so-called Lady of A.) contained 12 bronze and one gilded silver phialai (libation bowls), the latter inscribed ΠΕΠΕΡΙΑΣΙ, bronze and iron vessels and clay busts of Persephone. She was bedecked with gold jewellery; her garments were decorated with gold attachments and she wore a cloth diadem covered with a gold sheet embossed with scenes of Greek myths. A cluster of four chamber tombs, three so-called Makedonian tombs (covered with a barrel vault and approached by a dromos) and a cist tomb accompanied by an overground naiskos (comparable to similar assemblages in Aiane and → Pella) were covered with a large tumulus (so-called Great Tumulus of Vergina) which contained debris from the local cemetery, notably grave stelai. Two of the Makedonian tombs, Vergina II and III, were found intact, containing gold and silver jewellery and vessels, gold caskets, gold and ivory weapons and furniture, iron and bronze arms and armour, all of exquisite quality, as well as fine wall-paintings. The cist tomb, Vergina I, is decorated with a high-quality fresco of the rape of Persephone (pl. 3, fig. 4). 42\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAigai\n\nTomb IV and the overground naiskos are very heavily damaged. Because the tumulus was clearly an afterthought, it has been suggested that the tombs belonged to the royal family, were partly plundered by Pyrrhos’ mercenaries and later covered by Antigonos Gonatas. Tomb III contained the cremated remains of a 13-14 year old boy, accompanied by a dazzling array of burial goods and gilded weapons, as well as a painted frieze of funeral games (a chariot race); it has therefore been plausibly attributed to Alexander IV. His presence under the Great Tumulus entails a dynastic burial ground. The tombs under the Great Tumulus have been dated to the period 350-10. There is great controversy on the precise dating of Tombs I and II and various attributions to Argead kings and queens have been proposed without a consensus. The situation is compounded by the skeletal remains: 7 individuals in Tomb I and a couple in Tomb II. The man’s remains in Tomb II have been attributed either to Philip II or to his son, Philip III Arrhidaios, who died in their 40s. The anthropologists’ estimate of the age of the woman buried in the antechamber of Tomb II ranges from 20 to 32 which might rule out both Philip II’s last wife and Philip III’s wife who should have been buried alongside them. Even more problematic is the date of the socalled Tomb of Eurydike, excavated near the royal palace but never properly published. The palace of A. seems to have been the prototype of subsequent royal palaces. It consists of a large courtyard with banquet halls and a circular cult space opening all around it. A magnificent two-storey façade overlooked the east side, with Doric columns on the ground floor topped by engaged Ionic columns. A propylon in the centre of the facade contained false windows on the upper storey. Recent investigations of the palace foundations date it to the reign of Philip II. Part of the palace complex is the theatre, also probably dated to the same period. Only the front row of stone seats survives. The theatre is remarkable for its exceptionally large orchestra which would have been used for celebrations as well as theatrical performances. The banquet offered by Philip II for his daughter’s wedding must have been located in the palace, while his assassination took place in the theatre (Diod. 16.92-94). The sanctuary of Eukleia below the theatre is associated with the Argeads on account of two statue bases inscribed with a dedication to Eukleia by Philip II’s mother, Eurydike. They are dated to the reign of Philip II. She is defined as the daughter of Sirras, with no mention of her husband’s name (Amyntas III). The use of patronymic rather than husband’s name is also attested in a dedication of Laodike, Perseus’ queen, in the same sanctuary. One of the two bases dedicated by Eurydike seems to\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n43\n\nAischines\n\nhave carried an over-life-size peplos figure in Pentelic marble (pl. 3, fig. 1) with a separately made head, also of Pentelic marble. The statuary type suggests that this is a divine image, not a portrait of Eurydike. That a portrait of Eurydike stood somewhere at A. is attested by a statue base carrying her name and found reused in an early Christian basilica in the nearby village of Palatitsia. Parts of the fortification walls of A. may date from the period of the Argeads though they were extensively refurbished by Kassandros. O. Palagia Cf.

(eds.), The Hellenistic Court, 2017, 409-17.\n\nAischines Aischines (ca. 391/0-ca. 322) is an Athenian politician best known for his bitter rivalry with → Demosthenes over the direction of Athenian policy towards Makedonia in the 340s and the 330s. The specific details of A.’s political career and the policies that he advocated in response to → Philip II’s increasingly aggressive expansion into mainland Greece are difficult to ascertain, as most of our knowledge is derived from two sets of mutually contradictory and deliberately obfuscating speeches delivered by A. and Demosthenes, in which each orator defends his own stance against Philip and vilifies his opponent (Aischin. 2-3; Dem. 18-19). The occasion of A.’s political début was Philip’s destruction of → Olynthos in 348, which brought to a head nearly a decade of hostile relations between Makedonia and → Athens. Since Philip’s accession in 360/59, his rapid expansion beyond the traditional borders of Makedonia collided with Athenian interests in the north, culminating in a declaration of outright war in 357 when Philip seized the former Athenian possession of → Amphipolis and refused to return it (Isok. 5.2; Aischin. 2.70). Weakened by the Social War (357-55), the Athenians were unable to mount an effective resistance against Philip’s encroachment upon the northwest Aegean or to provide timely military assistance to their allies: either the Phokians during the → Third Sacred War (despite Athenian success in blocking Philip’s passage south in 352) or the Chalkidic League, resulting in the fall of Olynthos, its most powerful city, in 348. 44\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAischines\n\nIn the wake of Philip’s sacking of Olynthos (during which he took captive some Athenian citizens), A. addressed the Council and the Assembly, advocating a change in direction of Athenian foreign policy, suggesting that they lay aside their current inertia to take an active role against the threat posed by Philip (Dem. 19.10, 303). On the proposal of → Euboulos, A. was one of a number of envoys sent to appeal to the other Greek cities for combined military assistance against Philip (Dem. 19.303-304; Diod. 16.54.1); he went to Arkadia (Aischin. 2.79, 157; Dem. 19.11, 304-307). This attempt to foment a panhellenic coalition against Makedonia failed, however, and A. pragmatically counseled his fellow Athenians that in the absence of aid from the other Greeks it was prudent to make peace with Philip (Aischin. 2.79). On the motion of Philokrates, whose view of the situation was similar to A.’s (Theopomp., BNJ 115 F 164), the Athenians voted to send 10 ambassadors to enter into peace negotiations with Philip; both A. and Demosthenes were chosen (Aischin. 2.18-20; 3.63; Dem. 19.12). The embassy, with Philokrates as the chief negotiator for the peace treaty that later bore his name, departed for Makedonia in early 346. There, the ambassadors seem unanimously to have acquiesced in the peace terms proposed by Philip, a bilateral agreement between Philip and Athens and its allies in the Second Athenian Sea League, which notably included the Athenian renunciation of any claim to Amphipolis (Theopomp., BNJ 115 F 166). The Athenians ratified the peace terms upon the ambassadors’ return to the city, and they duly were sent back to → Pella to await Philip’s ratification of the treaty (Dem. 19.17, 150). But Philip delayed meeting with the ambassadors to swear the oaths to seal the peace treaty while he completed his conquest of → Thrace and gained control of the pass at Thermopylai, allowing him to settle the Third Sacred War on his own terms, including the punishment of the sacrilegious Phokians. A. attempted to ameliorate the changed circumstances in Athens’ favour by urging Philip to mitigate the strong position of → Thebes (Athens’ inveterate enemy and the Phokians’ chief opponent in the Third Sacred War) by freeing the cities of → Boiotia from Theban control (Dem. 19.20-22), a position violently opposed by Demosthenes on the grounds that it would bring Philip perilously close to the borders of Attika. Relations between the two orators seemed to have soured over the question of future Athenian policy towards Makedonia, and soon after the embassy’s return to Athens Demosthenes began actively to dissociate himself from the peace agreement, joining forces with his ally Timarchos to embark on a prosecution of A. for allegedly receiving bribes from Philip. A. was able to\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n45\n\nAischines\n\nhead off this prosecution temporarily by countering it with his own (successful) prosecution of Timarchos on the grounds of sexual misconduct (Aischin. 1). But, thanks largely to Demosthenes’ vigorous campaign to undermine the peace in Athens, Philokrates fled Athens in 343 to avoid prosecution himself, and Demosthenes brought formal charges against A. for accepting bribes from Philip to broker the now-discredited → Peace of Philokrates (Aischin. 2; Dem. 19). A. was narrowly acquitted, by a margin of 30 votes (Idomeneus of Lampsakos, BNJ 338 F 10). He seems to have suffered a loss of reputation and reappears in public life only in 340/39, when Athens was once again in a state of open war with Philip, as one of Athens’ representatives to the → Delphic Amphiktyony (Aischin. 3.115; Dem. 3.149). On this occasion, A.’s vigorous defense of Athens against a charge of impiety by the Lokrians (instigated by the Thebans) resulted in the outbreak of new hostilities in central Greece, the so-called Fourth Sacred War. Although Demosthenes later accused A. of devising a pretext for Philip to march south with his army (Dem. 18.151-152, 156), the upshot of the renewal of war was to drive a wedge between Philip’s allies, the Thebans and the Thessalians, allowing Demosthenes to manipulate the Thebans into an unexpected alliance with Athens (not a result that Philip had foreseen or intended). Nevertheless, Philip prevailed, defeating the combined forces of the Athenians and Thebans along with a coalition of Greek poleis decisively at the Battle of → Chaironeia in 338. A. was chosen along with Phokion and Demades to negotiate for terms with Philip after the battle (Aischin. 3.227; Dem. 18.282). Subsequently, he appears in public life only to initiate a prosecution against Ktesiphon for making an illegal proposal to honour Demosthenes with a stephanos for his service to Athens. Forestalled by the shocking news of Philip’s assassination in 336, which appeared to vindicate his rival’s policies, A. bided his time until 330 when the failure of Agis’ revolt against Makedonia and Alexander’s conquest of Persia in his view made conditions right for the success of a prosecution attacking Demosthenes’ record of opposition to Philip (Aischin. 3; Dem. 18). Nevertheless, A. did not succeed in obtaining even a fifth of the votes, and went into exile thereafter; the ancient biographers provide differing versions of his activities after 330, none of which are reliable. It is too facile to state that A. was “pro-Makedonian” while Demosthenes was “anti-Makedonian,” as both politicians were attempting to defend Athens and its possessions against the expansionist activities of Philip, and clashed only on what kind of foreign policy would be most effective; there is no reason to consider Demosthenes’ accusation that A. advocated the 46\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nakinakes\n\nacceptance of peace terms from Philip because he had been bribed as anything more than a courtroom slander. In the end, they both fatally underestimated the diplomatic and military abilities of Philip, as A. himself concedes (Aischin. 2.118). F. Pownall Cf.

An. 6.29.6; Curt. 10.1.31). Along with the woolen cap of the tiara it later played a major role in the Persian court costume, as displayed on reliefs at → Persepolis. Within this sphere, it adopted the character of an elite distinction, worn by the king (Curt. 3.3.18) and high officials (Hdt. 3.118.2, 128.5; 9.107.2). Golden (handle, scabbard), richly ornamented specimens were awarded by the king, comparable to a golden medal of merit, to outstanding persons for substantial services, also to non-Persians such as the Kilikian vice-king in 401 (Xen. An. 1.2.27, cf. Hdt. 7.54.2). Another case was → Alexander I of Makedonia. His decoration, mentioned in no written source, appears on his earliest coins, minted soon before 480 (pl. 1.1). It emphasizes his rank within the Persian hierarchy, and his position: according to → Herodotos, he repeatedly acted as the Persian diplomat-in-chief in 480/79. After Xerxes’ defeat the detail disappeared when Alexander, no longer a commissioned Persian commander, adopted the new image of a Philhellen. Mardonios, the Persian chief of staff, related to Xerxes and one of his principal advisors, must have been amongst the rather few men in Xerxes’ staff who, as Alexander, were entitled to wear a golden a. He fell in the initial phase of the battle at Plataiai, killed by a Spartan hoplite (Hdt. 9.64.2). For this reason it is not probable that his golden a. went to → Athens, to Athena’s treasury, as was later claimed (Dem. 24.129); the gold in it, restricted to ornaments on the handle and scabbard, allegedly weighed 300 dareikoi (2.5 kg!).

It can be traced back to the early 5th c. In 480/79 both were on Xerxes’ side (Hdt. 7.6.2, 172-173; 9.44.1). Therefore, after its defeat, the Persian army withdrew without any hindrance from the Thessalians and Makedonians (Hdt. 9.89.4). Also, the coins of Alexander’s western series and those from Larisa have similar images which indicate a certain degree of connection. In contrast, Plutarch’s account of the hostility between the Thessalians and Makedonians (Mor. 868E) seems unlikely and is not documented in contemporary sources. For the rule of → Perdikkas II, a solid political xenia with the A. is documented. Due to Perdikkas’ influence (Thuc. 4.78.2), his friend Nikonidas, probably one of the A., escorted Perdikkas’ ally Brasidas through Thessaly in 424 (Thuc. 4.78.679.1). Later, as an ally of Athens, Perdikkas prevented Spartan reinforcements for Brasidas from entering Thessaly (Thuc. 4.132). The suggestion that → Archelaos helped Aristippos, an A., in the matter of an internal conflict, is primarily based on Peri Politeias (6), additionally on a fragment of Thrasymachos (DK 85 B2) and a brief reference in Aristotle (Pol. 1311B). Archelaos reinstated the A. to their leading position, installed a garrison in Larisa and was granted with the citizenship of Larisa and control over Perrhaibia. 10 hostages, among them Hellanokrates from Larisa (Arist. Pol. 1311B), were sent to his → court (Peri Pol. 6, 16-18, 29, 33). Due to its unknown authorship, date of origin and rhetorical character, Peri Politeias must be treated with caution. Archelaos likely helped the A., but the details are hard to assess. Whether Hellanokrates, possibly an A., was a hostage or a guest at Archelaos’ court cannot be clarified. There are no sources that document the connection of his successor → Aëropos to the A., but Plutarch hints that both were hostile to the Spartan king Agesilaos II (Ages. 16.1-3). The nature of the relationship between → Amyntas II, → Pausanias, and the A. remains unclear. However, after → Amyntas III had been expelled from Makedonia at the beginning of his rule, he was aided and restored by the Thessalians (Diod. 14.92.3), among them very likely the A. They, in turn, later asked → Alexander II for help with their internal strife with Alexander of Pherai. Alexander II led his troops to Thessaly and took Larisa. Contrary to his agreement with the A., he did not restore the polis, but installed a garrison there (Diod. 15.61.3-5). He withdrew from Thessaly when the Theban general 48\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAleuads\n\nPelopidas, summoned by some Thessalians, took Larisa (Diod. 15.67.4). There is no evidence for any connection between → Ptolemy of Aloros or → Perdikkas III and the A. Philip II’s first intervention in Thessaly is usually dated to 358. He is generally thought to have intervened in favour of the A. in their conflict with the tyrants of Pherai (Diod. 16.14.1-2; Dem. 18.295). After solving this conflict, he married Philinna of Larisa, probably an A. (Athen. 13.557C). The dating is a matter of debate. In 354/3, conflicts between Lykophron of Pherai and the Thessalians arose. The A. were likely involved and appealed to Philip (Diod. 16.35.1; Just. 8.2.1-2). After two defeats in 353/2 against Onomarchos and Phokis, Lykophron’s allies, Philip returned and defeated Onomarchos, aided by the Thessalians (Diod. 16.35.2-5, 38.1; Just. 8.2.1; Polyain. 2.38.2). It is mostly thought that after his victory, he was elected archon by the Thessalian League, probably with the support of the A. (Polyain. 4.2.19; Dem. 1.22; 2.7; 18.47-48; 19.318; Just. 8.2.1; 7.6.8, 8.3.1-5; 11.3.1-3). However, the dating and even the existence of the election is debated. In 349, according to Demosthenes (1.22), Philip suppressed the Thessalians and they opposed him. Even if his remark is trustworthy, it is uncertain whether Demosthenes misunderstood the privileges of Philip as an archon and if the Thessalians as a whole, including the A., were affected or only Pherai. At the end of the → Third Sacred War in 346, Philip managed to expand his influence in Central Greece significantly. After he had restored the Thessalians to their position in the → Delphic Amphiktyony, he gained, probably with the help of the A., the Phokian votes. Hence, together with his influence on the Thessalians and their votes, he dominated the council (Diod. 16.60.1-2). In 344/3, Philip intervened again in Larisa, due to political unrest (Diod. 16.69.8; Dem. 6.22; 19.260). Initially, the A. were likely engaged in internal strife. His intervention triggered a conflict between him and the A. As a result, several of them and their leader Simos were expelled from Larisa (Dem. 18.47-48; Arist. Pol. 1306A; Polyain. 4.2.11, 2.19). Some scholars think that thereupon Philip broke his ties with the A. Considering the presence of influential A. at Alexander III’s court, this might not apply for all A. Thessalians, among them possibly A., took part in the battle of → Chaironeia (Diod. 16.86.16; Just. 9.3.4-10; Polyain. 4.2.2, 2.7). At the beginning of Alexander III’s reign, he had to overcome Thessalian resistance. Reportedly by evoking their common ancestors, but presumably in fact by military threat, he convinced the Thessalians, among them probably A., to elect him as archon (Diod. 17.4.1; Just. 11.3.1-2). As a member of the → Korinthian League, the Thessalian contingent, among them\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n49\n\nAlexander historiographers\n\nA., fought along with the Makedonian army in Asia (Curt. 6.6.35; Plut. Alex. 24.1; Arr. Ind. 18.7). Some A. were important and influential hetairoi at Alexander’s court such as Medeios and Polykleitos of Larisa. They accompanied him on his campaign (Arr. An. 7.24.4; Diod. 17.117.1; Strab. 15.3.2). Medeios may have been a commander of the Thessalian cavalry. He was appointed one of the honourary trierarchs of the Hydaspes fleet (Arr. Ind. 18.7). Polykleitos was sent to Sousa to examine the royal treasury (Athen. 5.206D-E). After Alexander’s death, during the formal reign of Philip III, the Thessalians joined the Greek forces in the Lamian War. It is uncertain if A. participated. Through his mother Philinna, Philip III may have had connections to the A. It is also possible that he and Alexander IV were elected as archons of the Thessalian League. The relationship between the Argeads and the A. changed from a xenia to a hegemony, so that the Argeads were able to secure their southern border, and gained access to the Thessalian cavalry and the strategically important harbour of Pagasai.

The first historical accounts of A.’s expedition were almost certainly composed at the request of the king himself, who was well aware of the need to legitimize his campaign to the Greeks to ensure their continued co-operation, particularly as he moved farther away from the coast of → Asia Minor. → Kallisthenes of → Olynthos (BNJ 124), whose family had a longstanding association with the Argead → court (he was a relative of → Aristotle), and who had previously proved willing to adopt a suitably pro-Makedonian agenda in his Hellenika, was the obvious candidate for A. to commission as his official court historian (explicit at Just. 12.6.17; implied at Arr. An. 4.10.1-2). The extant fragments from Kallisthenes’ Deeds of Alexan­ 50\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAlexander historiographers\n\nder suggest that the work had a deliberately Homeric and Hellenizing tenor, portraying A.’s expedition as a re-enactment of the Trojan War. Kallisthenes’ condemnation and death in the wake of the ‘Pages’ Conspiracy in 327, however, entail that his history was left incomplete and did not include the final years of A.’s campaign (it is not clear why some manuscripts credit him with the authorship of the romanticizing treatment of episodes from A.’s life known as the Greek Alexander Romance). Like Kallisthenes, Anaximenes of Lampsakos benefitted from Philip’s → patronage at the Makedonian → court and followed up his eulogistic history of Philip’s reign with an account of A.’s expedition; unfortunately the only fragments extant from it (on the number of A.’s troops) are singularly uninformative (BNJ 72 F 29a-b). → Marsyas of Pella accompanied A. until he marched back into Syria in 331, where he remained with his elder half-brother → Antigonos. Marsyas covered A.’s campaign in his history of Makedonia through his departure from → Egypt (BNJ 135-136 T 1); the extant fragments indicate that he too was concerned to justify Philip’s unification of Makedonia and military expansion against the Greek poleis, which suggests that his narrative of A. was likewise written with an eye to legitimizing his conquests to a Greek readership. In addition to Kallisthenes, Marsyas, and Anaximenes, a number of highly-placed military officers and administrators at A.’s traveling court wrote first-hand accounts of his expedition, published in in the years after his death: → Chares of Mytilene (BNJ 125), A.’s royal chamberlain; → Nearchos of Crete (BNJ 133), A.’s admiral; → Onesikritos of Astypalaia (BNJ 134), the head steersman of A.’s fleet; → Aristoboulos of Kassandreia (BNJ 139), who accompanied A.’s expedition, and held no known military commands but performed a series of civil commissions; → Ephippos of Olynthos (BNJ 126), who served as A.’s inspector in Egypt (BNJ 126 T 2); and Polykleitos of Larisa (BNJ 128), a member of A.’s Thessalian cavalry. A few other members of A.’s entourage are attested to have written literary works—Nikoboule (BNJ 127), Medeios of Larisa (BNJ 129), Kyrsilos of Pharsalos (BNJ 130), and Antigenes (BNJ 141), but there is simply too little extant to determine if they wrote historical accounts of A.’s expedition or some other genre of literature altogether. Although little remains from the historical works of A.’s contemporaries, the extant fragments generally indicate a eulogizing and romanticizing tendency (even those of Ephip­ pos, whose work is often considered to be a hostile pamphlet, contain no explicitly negative judgments of A.). Furthermore, most of these writers followed Kallisthenes’ lead, in response presumably to A.’s own instructions, in recasting\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n51\n\nAlexander historiographers\n\nspecific episodes from A.’s campaign in explicitly Homeric terms. In the subsequent historiographical tradition, which relied on the works of these contemporary sources, this episodic tendency results in the reduction of A.’s career to a series of highly stylized anecdotes and rhetorical set-pieces, which could be manipulated accorded to the writer’s own particular agenda. On the other hand, the fragments of the history of A.’s expedition by → Ptolemy, son of Lagos (BNJ 138), one of the most important of A.’s commanders, suggest that its focus was more military and less romantic than the works of his contemporaries. Nevertheless, it too evinces an apologetic tendency towards its subject, and exaggerates Ptolemy’s own military contributions, not surprisingly as his purpose in writing was to establish the legitimacy of his dynasty in Egypt (which also suggests that he is the least likely of those who served with A. to have begun composing his history before the king’s death). Although until recently he also was thought to have accompanied A. on his expedition, → Kleitarchos of Alexandreia (BNJ 137) almost certainly wrote his history of A. decades afterwards, as is indicated by a fragmentary papyrus in which he is named as the tutor of the future Ptolemy IV Philopator (P.Oxy. 4808 = BNJ 137 T 1a), who was not born until ca. 244. Therefore, unlike his predecessors, he does not offer an eyewitness account of A.’s campaign. Despite his reliance on secondary sources and notorious reputation for unreliability (BNJ 137 T 6, T 8), Kleitarchos’ history was extremely influential upon the subsequent historiographical tradition on A. Extending to at least 12 books (BNJ 137 F 6), it offered a sensationalistic narrative of A.’s expedition, abounding in vivid descriptions and prone to rhetorical embellishment. Due in large part to its highly entertaining narrative, Kleitarchos’ history was enormously popular in the Roman period (especially when issues of autocratic rule took on an importance beyond the strictly theoretical), and forms the base of the so-called vulgate or popular tradition on A. The earliest extant full narrative of A.’s reign occurs in Book 17 of the universal history of Diodoros of Sicily, written in the mid-first c. BC. The dramatic and often-lurid vignettes of Kleitarchos’ history were appealing to Diodoros, who found fertile material in it for graphic illustrations of the moral and didactic lessons he wished to impart in his narrative of A.’s campaign. Nevertheless, in comparison with the later vulgate authors, Diodoros’ A. is generally presented in idealizing terms and any criticism of his character tends to be muted. Pompeius Trogus, a Romanized Gaul writing during the rule of Augustus, devoted books 7-12 of his universal history in 44 books to A., using Kleitarchos as his primary source. Trogus’ Philippic History is now 52\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAlexander historiographers\n\nlost, surviving only in an epitome by Justin, composed sometime between the 2nd and the 4th c.s AD; the material on A. is in books 11-12. Trogus-Justin offers the first extant historical treatment of A. in Latin. Perhaps reflecting its Roman context, the portrait of A. in Trogus-Justin is far more hostile than any of its Greek predecessors, although it is based on the same source tradition. Trogus-Justin’s A. is portrayed as a stereotypical tyrant; despite his undeniable military success, he is not a figure to be admired because his lack of self-restraint has transformed him into a cruel and bloodthirsty despot over the course of his campaign. Quintus Curtius Rufus offers the first surviving stand-alone historio­ graphical treatment of A., written in Latin in the first c. AD, probably during the reign of Vespasian. Curtius’ Histories of Alexander the Great was a work of 10 books (of which the first two are lost, and portions of the other are lacunose), ultimately based on Kleitarchos, although there is evidence for his use of other sources as well. Like Trogus-Justin, a major theme in Curtius’ overtly rhetorical and heavily embroidered narrative is the degeneration of A.’s character after his conquest of Persia, when he succumbs to oriental luxury and becomes a despot, complete with the stereotypical tyrannical attributes of irrational violence, para­ noid behaviour, misuse of power, and divine pretensions (A. may represent for Curtius a stand-in for offering implicit and therefore safe political commentary on imperial Rome). The latest surviving representative of the vulgate tradition is the → Metz Epitome (compiled most likely during the 4th or 5th c. AD), a narrative account in Latin of A.’s expedition from the death of Dareios III to his Indian campaign. The Metz Epitome adopts the sensationalism and the dramatic depiction of certain selected anecdotes familiar from the other narratives based on Kleitarchos, but privileges the military achievements of A. over his putative descent into oriental despotism. Thus, although all the historiographers of the vulgate tradition use a common source, the way that they shape this shared body of material results in very different kinds of narratives on A., depending on the individual writer’s intellectual context and political agenda. The Greek writers of the high Roman Empire, writing during a period of political stability, relative intellectual freedom, and philhellenic emperors, when literary resistance to autocratic rule had all but ceased, revert to a largely idealizing portrayal of A. In his Life of Alexander (composed late first/early 2nd c. AD), Plutarch of Chaironeia appears to have used all the sources available to him to construct a generally apologetic portrayal of A. as a powerful symbol of civilizing virtue and the promotion of Hellenic ethical norms among the barbarians. The Life of\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n53\n\nAlexander historiographers\n\nAlexander (paired with Julius Caesar) is a moralizing biography, and as Plutarch himself famously concedes in its introduction (Alex. 1), his aim is not to provide an exhaustive historical account of his subject, but to emphasize the actions that best illustrate his character. Nevertheless, based on his thorough canvassing of the earlier sources (most of which no longer survive) Plutarch does provide his own take on all the episodes from A.’s campaign that had become standard by his time, and is the only extant source to include material on A.’s early life prior to his accession (Alex. 2-10); therefore his Life is one of the most valuable and influential treatments of A. in the ancient historiographical tradition. Like Plutarch, his slightly younger contemporary in the Second Sophistic cultural movement, Lucius Flavius Arrianus (Arrian) returned to a more idealizing portrayal in his narrative of A.’s expedition, the Anabasis of Alexander. Shaped perhaps by the military and political prominence he attained under the Roman emperors Trajan and Hadrian, Arrian rejected the marvelous, the romantic, and the gossipy elements that the mainstream of Alexander historiography represented by the 2nd c. AD, choosing instead to base his narrative chiefly on A.’s contemporaries, Ptolemy and Aristoboulos (Arr. An. praef. 1-2; 7.5.16). Arrian justifies his choice of two relatively obscure sources (by his own time, at least) by claiming that he considered Ptolemy and Aristoboulos reliable authorities because they campaigned with A. and wrote after his death, when no compulsion or incentive would lead them to write anything other than what actually happened; furthermore, it is likely that he found their apologetic and eulogistic portrayals particularly congenial to his own idealizing vision of A. Although Arrian’s Anabasis gives the impression of providing a sober and factual account of A.’s expedition (and for that reason has often been privileged as the accurate historical source by modern scholars, despite its composition nearly 500 years after A.’s death), he too (no less than his predecessors) shapes his narrative and is deliberately selective in his treatment of material in order to portray A. as an ideal ruler (a concern shared by his historiographical model, Xenophon, to whom Arrian pays homage with the title of his work on A.). Thus, even by the time his own contemporaries began to compose the earliest historiographical narratives of A., he had already become a larger than life figure, whose brilliant military career and stunning conquest of the Achaimenid Persian Empire were reduced to a series of topoi, which could be employed as either positive or (eventually) negative exempla depending on the writer’s intellectual milieu and political agenda. Already by the time of Augustus, the geographer Strabon (11.6.4) 54\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\nAlexander I\n\ncomments that it is not easy to believe the accounts of most of those who have written on A. because they play fast and loose with the facts. Thus, even in antiquity, the problematic nature of the historiographical tradition on A. was recognized. F. Pownall Cf. Baynham, E., The Ancient Evidence for Alexander the Great, in: Roisman 2003, 3-29; Bosworth, A.B., From Arrian to Alexander, 1988, 1-15; Müller 2019, 18-33; Pearson 1960; Zambrini 2007.\n\nAlexander I When was Alexander I born? His father → Amyntas I adresses him, around 512/1, as neos: ‘young man’, lacking experience (Hdt. 5.19.1). In a possible model, another father, Dareios I, characterizes his son: ‘neos’ eōn ‘nea’ phronei—being a ‘young man’ he plots ‘new matters’, lacking brain (Aisch. Pe. 782). The young man is king Xerxes, just after Salamis, then on the Persian throne for 6 years. So we cannot conclude from the term neos alone to actual age. Nor may we take A.’s running the stadion during some Olympic Games after 480 (Hdt. 5.22.2, cf. Just. 7.2.14) as a hint to his age. He simply cannot have qualified for the stadion then, due to his advanced years: if he could stand in officially for his father in ca. 512/1, he had exceeded his early years then. If we consider for him an age of 16 (that of → Alexander III when he was → Philip II’s deputy in 340: Plut. Alex. 9.1), he would have been born before 525; so during the earliest Olym­piad possible (476—two decades earlier he had not yet been eager for being regarded as a Greek) he was beyond 50—too old for the stadion. Regarding the years of his accession and his death we are not on firmer ground. According to common opinion, he followed Amyntas around 500, at about 30, and died ca. 454/0, at about 75, being beyond his mid-40s during Xerxes’ invasion in 480. If he really gave his sister Gygaia in marriage to the high-ranking Persian Boubares (Hdt. 5.21.2), he did so after his father’s death: before that, Amyntas himself had been responsible for his daughter. So she cannot have played a role in appeasing a Persian investigation team soon after ca. 512/1. Persian pressure on him was devised at a time when the marriage of a Makedonian royal woman to a Persian noble turned critical for A., as it did during the Ionian Revolt (500492), due to developments in Thracian → Bisaltia, then just east of the Make-\n\n© Frank & Timme Verlag für wissenschaftliche Literatur\n\n55\n\nAlexander I\n\ndonian border: with Ionian help, a group of Paionian nobles, deported from there by the Persians to Hellespontine Phrygia a decade earlier, had returned (Hdt. 5.13-15) and cut Makedonia off the Empire. Enemies to the Persian king, they must have regarded Amyntas and A.—who just then succeeded his father— as traitors. Amyntas had submitted Makedonia to the Great King and in turn been put in charge of this region and probably adjoining areas as a hyparchos (Hdt. 5.20.4, cf. 7.106.1). This implied Persian support against leading men in Upper Makedonia and Thracian neighbours. It ended with the Paionians’ return that must have caused problems for A. (Hdt. 5.98). As a reaction he probably invented the story of an eliminated Persian delegation (Hdt. 5.19-20) that aimed at qualifying him as anti-Persian, and added his own version of Gygaia’s marriage to excuse his family’s connection to highly esteemed Persian nobles (Hdt. 4.143.2-3). That helped him to survive until 492 when Mardonios turned up to crush the Revolt in the far west (Hdt. 6.43.4-45). A. must have received Persian pardon then—he would not if he had sided with the Thracians up to his conviction, but it is likewise improbable that Xerxes granted him territories at the northern periphery of his realm only some years later (Just. 7.4.1). → Herodotos with his strong bias for A. passes over all this in silence. Nor does he explicitly mention A.’s preparations of Xerxes’ invasion which can however be concluded from Persian directives to other subjects, Greek cities in → Thrace: They had to prepare routes for the Persian army in their regions and to supply Xerxes’ troops (Hdt. 6.118-120). A. must have drawn the same assignments. He probably participated in digging the Athos canal (Hdt. 7.22-24), and doubtlessly had to construct and repair roads, bridges, harbours, and store houses in Lower Makedonia. Moreover, he had to equip and supply his Makedonian contingent during Xerxes’ campaign in Greece and probably assist Artabazos’ "
