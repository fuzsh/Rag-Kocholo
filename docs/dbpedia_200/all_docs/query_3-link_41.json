        "text": "2. Proper names garbled: names of persons and places are regularly garbled or got wrong. This is specially regrettable in a book which rightly sees names as important, without however considering how the evidence of epigraphy might bear on the question. See for instance the ingenious note on \"Philokrates son of Demeas\" on p. 301 (Th. 5.116), or that on the patronymics on p. 414 (note on 8.5), or that on Euphemos (\"Good speaker\" as Lattimore renders it, though \"auspicious\" might be closer) on p. 346 (Th. 6.81–87). Here, however, \"almost certainly\" is much too strong for the various identifications suggested, in view of the commonness of the name Euphemos at Athens; see the entry in vol. II (1994) of the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (1987–), a work never cited by Lattimore. In the following list I give Lattimore's page numbers with Thucydidean references in parentheses:\n\n27 (1.52) for \"Leagoras\" read \"Leogoras\"; 52 (1.107) for \"Kitinion\" read \"Kytinion\"; 67 (1.139) for \"Milesippos\" read \"Melesippos\" (correct at 2.12); 80 (2.12) for \"Diaokritos\" read \"Diakritos\"; 84 (2.19) for \"Rhetoi\" read \"Rheitoi\"; 108 (2.66) for \"Anaristos\" read \"Aneristos\"; 125 (2.96) for \"Triballio\" read \"Triballoi\"; 142 (3.26) for \"Kleombrotos\" read \"Kleomenes\"; 144 (3.31) for \"Tein\" read \"Teian\"; 175 (3.93) for \"Kenion\" read \"Kenaion\"; 214, 261, and 274 (4.56, 5.14, and 5.41) for \"Kynosouria\" read \"Kynouria\"; 224 (4.78) for \"Striophokos\" read the good epigraphically attested Thessalian name \"Strophakos\"; 225 (4.78) for \"Phagion\" read \"Phakion\"; 238 (4.107) for \"Gelepsis\" read \"Galepsos\"; 242 (4.118) for \"Tomeos\" read \"Tomeus\"; 254 (5.1 and in footnote) for \"Pharnakos\" read \"Pharnakes\"; 263 (5.18) for \"Spartalos\" read \"Spartolos,\" and for \"Ptoleon\" read \"Pteleon\"; 308 (6.4) for \"Krataimones\" read \"Krataimenes,\" and for \"Anaxilos\" read \"Anaxilas\"; 310 (6.8) for \"Laches\" read \"Lamachos\"; 335 (6.59) for \"Hippokles\" read \"Hippoklos\"; 339 (6.65) for \"Symaistos\" read \"Symaithos\"; 339 (6.66) for \"Anopos\" read \"Anapos,\" as also at pp. 355 (6.96) and 381 (7.42), but note that at p. 402 (7.78) the name has come out as \"Anopis\"; 359 (6.105) for \"Laispodios\" read \"Laispodias\"; 386 (7.50) for \"Kyrnaians\" read \"Kyrenaians\"; 416 (8.10 n.) for \"Speraion\" read \"Speiraion\"; 431 (8.44) for \"Kamieros\" read \"Kameiros\"; 465 (8.101) for \"Lektos\" read \"Lekton.\" Most of these names are, oddly enough, given correctly in the index. \"Anapos\" is correct on map 3."
