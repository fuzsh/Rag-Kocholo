        "text": "This paper begins by assessing the non-Athenian epigraphical evidence for state regulations in the fifth-century Aegean, and in so doing poses questions about the nature, extent, and fluctuation of the Athenian impact on the legalistic and epigraphic habits of her allies. In the second part of the paper, on the basis of a close examination of the Athenian regulations for Erythrai, I shall raise and investigate the possibility that certain Athenian regulations were couched in a rhetoric that would have seemed familiar to their allied readers.\n\nELA database: Browse http://www.epigraphiclandscape.unito.it/index.php/browse ; ELA database: Search http://www.epigraphiclandscape.unito.it/index.php/search ; Complete list of the 118 Athenian inscriptions examined on a topographic perspective for the ELA database, with particular attention to the relationship between the findspot of the inscribed fragments and the possible original location of the supports bearing those texts. These records, published on the database and identified with a DOI number, explore the historical and monumental significance of some groups of official texts - mainly decrees and honorific inscriptions - that enriched the epigraphic landscape of the Athenian 'asty' between the battle of Pydna and the Julio-Claudian age, in the attempt to verify the possible existence of homogeneous “archives” of epigraphic documents in the core areas of Late Hellenistic Athens.\n\nThis essay provides the editio princeps of a fragmentary account found in the area of Plaka (Athens). The inscription dates to the second half of the 4th century B.C., probably in the Lycurgan period. It records expenses for building activity at an unknown location. It is possible, albeit not certain, that the account was issued by the officials of the Eleusinian cult and that it was originally set up in the City Eleusinion.\n\nIn this paper, I study the emergence and advancement of epigraphic studies in roughly the first forty years following the foundation of the modern Greek state. The main protagonists – most of whom remain unknown outside Greece – are introduced, and their epigraphic output in its multiple manifestations is examined: the recording and analysis of inscriptions, the publication of articles and monographs, and the creation and protection of epigraphic collections. My study is contextualized by examining contemporary issues of ethnic identity and state-institution formation, as well as questions of interface amongst the Greek intellectuals themselves on the one hand, and between them and their European counterparts on the other. Ultimately, however, an attempt is made to understand the form and content that early epigraphic studies acquired in the Greek-speaking world, and the extent to which Greek scholarship contributed to the emerging field of epigraphy as it materialized with the publication of the early epigraphic corpora."
