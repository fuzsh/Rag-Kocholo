Originally it stood on the acropolis; reconstructed from more than one hundred and eighty fragments, it now dominates one of the main rooms in the epigraphic museum at Athens. The visitor who stands in front of it cannot always see the rationale for the placing of the fragments in the reconstruction. Some joins between pieces are clearly visible from the front. Others exist but cannot be seen because marble does not fracture into neat rectangular blocks, and joins at a deeper level are obscured by the plaster used to hold the whole together. Many fragments owe their place to scholarly reconstruction alone. The invisible iron clamps that provide the armature of the whole are deteriorating, and the monument needs to be entirely taken apart and put together again with titanium clamps. While that is being done, the full evidence for the existing reconstruction will, for the first time since 1927, be available once again to direct inspection and reinterpretation.1 The prospect is exciting, if daunting. But there are ways of reinterpreting the Athenian empire that do not require the physical disassemblage of major monuments, and it is as a contribution to that enterprise that this volume (based with expansions on a lecture series held in Oxford in spring 2007) is intended. The physical reconstruction of the first tribute lists in 1927 has a symbolic significance as inaugurating what many would see as the modern era in the study of the Athenian empire: it was part of the process that culminated in the publication of Athenian Tribute Lists (‘ATL’) from 1939 to 1953 and (29 years after his first article on the subject) of Meiggs’ still authoritative The Athenian Empire in 1972.2 But fragments of the tribute lists had been known since the 1830s and some other relevant inscriptions since the eighteenth century, while the main literary sources have always been with us. It therefore seemed relevant and interesting to recover a historiography of the Athenian empire prior to 1927 which would set the ‘modern era’ in perspective. The first essay in\n\n1\n\nRobert Parker the volume tackles this task; the second assesses the ATL watershed and subsequent reactions to it. Peter Liddel shows how the earliest British historians of Greece in the eighteenth century tended to take the story of the Athenian empire as the story of a failure, an institution which went wrong and provided a sobering warning for contemporary colonial administrations (the parallel long remained a vivid one). Thucydides’ (on the surface at least) merely descriptive account of an alliance that mutated into an instrument of domination was read by Stanyan and later by Montagu as a decline and fall; even a writer more sympathetic to Athens, William Young, stressed the danger posed to the ethos of a free state by foreign conquest. The example played into the hands of the arch-conservative William Mitford, because the turn to oppression and rapaciousness could be blamed on the radical democracy. The liberal defenders of Athenian democracy in the nineteenth century had therefore to mount a defence, a challenge taken up cautiously by Bulwer Lytton and wholeheartedly by George Grote, who went so far as to declare the empire ‘a sight marvellous to behold … highly beneficial to the Greek world’. The battle lines were therefore drawn up, and most of the factors presented by the sources (cleruchies; transfer of court cases to Athenian courts; export of democracy; abolition of piracy) were already mustered, if very variously evaluated. Meanwhile the first fragments of the tribute lists were published (in 1835) and recognised for what they were (in 1842) by the Greek pioneers of Attic epigraphy, Pittakys and Rangavis. The young discipline professionalised itself with extraordinary speed in Germany through scholars such as Boeckh and Koehler, and the first edition of Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum by Kirchoff in 1871 made an impressive array of epigraphic evidence easily available. Grote and Jowett for reasons of their own continued to insist on the primary importance of the literary sources, but most scholars turned eagerly to the stones and, as a Manchester exam question of 1882-3 proves, expected their students to do the same. Several arguments that have remained highly influential originate in this period: the great increase in the tribute assessment of 425/4 was discovered by Boeckh (and subsequently deployed by Grundy to make a point about Thucydides, who fails to mention it); Abbott in 1891 used the fluctuating returns in the tribute lists from 450-440 to argue for widespread disaffection in that period. On the whole the new evidence gave more ammunition to the empire’s critics than its defenders, but it could often be played two ways, and Alfred Zimmern could even attempt, in Liddel’s words, to ‘introduce epigraphy to a large-scale liberal interpretation of the Athenian empire’. The new documents, Liddel concludes, introduced a new level of detail but did not dislodge scholars from positions in which their political instincts placed them. This contestability of inscriptions is still with us: the ‘Phaselis decree’, for instance, is seen by some as a measure to simplify procedures for Phaselite traders in Athens, by others as a device to subject\n\n2\n\nIntroduction Phaselite defendants to biased Athenian jurisdiction;3 even the great tribute increase of 425/4 that was taken as so fatal to Grote’s defence of the empire has been reinterpreted in a way that would cause him much less pain.4 The Grotean tradition of evaluating the empire positively lived on in the USA for much of the twentieth century, as Lisa Kallet shows. Bonner combined it in 1923 with a modernising, free-market, commercialist vision of the benefits it brought to ruler and ruled alike. But influential voices such as de Romilly and Finley insisted that the empire was about power and status, not trade, and the question also posed by Finley about the economic implications of the empire is one to which scholarship is only now returning. Kallet then addresses the great culmination of American interest in the empire, Athenian Tribute Lists. If most of the inscriptional evidence had been discovered and published in the nineteenth century, why then is the modern era in the study of the Athenian empire felt to begin in the 1920s? Intensive study over three decades by the three authors of ATL and several scholars associated with them in various ways (West, Meiggs, Pritchett) subjected the texts to more concentrated and expert attention than they had ever received before; and ATL interwove its epigraphic conclusions with every available fragment of literary evidence to create what Kallet characterises as a ‘near-seamless picture of the Athenian empire’. The work was transformatory not in introducing a paradigm shift but simply in doing what had been done before much more skilfully and comprehensively. A problem was that many crucial inscriptions could not be dated; to resolve it, the team developed supposedly objective dating criteria, by letter forms, which remained widely accepted until the 1990s. Kallet notes a paradox: letter-form dating required certain inscriptions previously held to attest the odious demagoguery of the 420s to be relocated in the 440s; but the imputation of odiousness was not transferred from Cleon to Pericles (the influence of Thucydides was too strong), the explanation for severity being sought instead in the mid-century ‘crisis of the empire’ (a theme going back, as we have noted, to E. Abbott). The main challenge to the consensus about dating by letter-forms, from Harold Mattingly, was largely motivated by a desire to reload the odium onto Cleon, and it was left to Finley (1978) to insist that imperial policy had in many ways been ruthless and self-interested from the very start. Kallet, like Finley, criticises the over-personalised approach to Athenian policy-making; the inscriptions should not be used, she argues, to illustrate Thucydides’ judgements on individual politicians, nor fitted into his mono-directional model of ‘alliance to empire’. Each should be taken in its own terms, and if done so will reveal the flexibility with which the Athenian assembly responded to a constantly varying situation. Finley once accused scholars of reducing the study of the Athenian empire to a squabble over the dating of the three-barred sigma. But what is at issue is the historical location of many of the most important docu-\n\n3\n\nRobert Parker ments that bear on the empire; and Finley was rightly charged by Meiggs with making a molehill out of a mountain.5 For some fifty years the general opinion was that all inscriptions displaying archaic letter-forms belonged before 446 (the year in which the tribute lists went over to the more modern form of sigma). Nikolaos Papazarkadas describes how that wideranging though never unchallenged consensus suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed in the early 1990s; even if the old doctrine has not been formally proved untenable, enough probable exceptions have been identified to leave it with few confident adherents. The Berlin wall is down, therefore, and we are free to locate every document in the historical context that best suits it. Papazarkadas shows how re-datings (in either direction) can transform not just our picture of Athens’ relations with particular areas of the Greek world (Magna Graecia; the Troad) but also, for instance, that of the role of slaves in naval warfare. As for the big story of Athens’ treatment of allied cities, two inscriptions are generally held to be immovably dated to the 450s and to 446 respectively (the Erythrae and Chalcis decrees), and to show that ‘whatever the dating of the Cleinias decree or the Coinage decree, it still appears that most of the essential tools of Athenian control were in use by 446’.6 But Papazarkadas probes tentatively with his crowbar to see if even these could not be shifted from their familiar place. His aim is not, however, to dissociate the good imperialist Pericles from his degenerate and oppressive successors. If ‘oppressive’ documents move down in time, they leave behind them not a golden age, but a vacuum. The empire was a phenomenon entirely new within the Greek world. Allied cities, required to pay tribute, never passed honorary decrees in favour of Athenians: to such an extent did the empire break the bounds of normal relations between Greek states.7 At its very foundation, the Delian League was ‘an entirely new departure in Greek alliances’. 8 The decision taken in 478 that the League should be funded not by ad hoc levies for individual campaigns but by a regular annual tribute was unprecedented. Thereafter the League developed very rapidly still further away from anything that the Greeks had known among themselves. Athens’ control of a subject, tribute-paying empire liable to legislation from the centre was quite different, Kurt Raaflaub shows in his chapter, from Sparta’s position as leader of an alliance or Corinth’s ‘colonial empire’ or any other Greek model, even those of the Sicilian tyrants. Creation of an extra-territorial empire had never been the aim of earlier Greek warfare. Unlike the British in J.R. Seeley’s famous formulation, the Athenians can scarcely have acquired their empire ‘in a fit of absence of mind’; the absence of mind, if such there was, was that of the Spartans who acquiesced in the loss of leadership in 478, and the allied cities who failed to resist Athenian domination in subsequent years. Raaflaub argues that the Athenians borrowed their ‘instruments of empire’, beginning with the very idea of annual tribute, from the enemy the League was formed to combat. A whole string of Athenian imperial institutions and practices find parallels not in\n\n4\n\nIntroduction Greece but to the East: the dispatch of overseers, and garrisons, to subject states; interference with constitutions; punitive deportation of rebellious subjects; settlement of citizens of the imperial power on land seized from subjects; more speculatively, a navy organised from the centre (to give just a selection of Raaflaub’s examples). Greeks of the governing class had had both the opportunity and the incentive, he points out, to observe and contemplate the operations of the Persian empire for more than half a century. In an eye-opening book of 1997 Meg Miller had already established the reality of ‘cultural receptivity’, particularly in the visual arts, between Athens and Persia in the fifth century. Politicians learnt from Persia (without advertising the fact, for obvious reasons) no less than did potters. A similar claim in a particular aspect is one of the central arguments of John Ma’s paper. He analyses a form of control, found both in the Achaemenid empire and in the Hellenistic kingdoms, which he designates ‘surrender and grant’: a people surrenders to the imperial power, which then gives back what it has received on terms defined by itself – perhaps merely the right to exist, perhaps in rare cases an autonomy which still depends on the good will of the ruling power. The procedure followed by the Athenians when dealing with allies who had revolted was essentially the same, and the right to dictate terms embedded in it was generalised and extended to the whole empire: ‘it seems good to the Athenian people’ became as generally binding as the ‘So speaks Cyrus’ of the Achaemenids and anticipated the ‘I think it right that …’ of the Hellenistic king. Faced as Raaflaub stresses with the problem of controlling an overseas empire, the Athenians borrowed ‘surrender and grant’, and passed it on to their Hellenistic successors. Ma then offers an illustrative case-study which is also a rare ‘bottom up’ glimpse of one of the places subjected to Athenian imperial control. An Athenian decree probably of the 430s thanks the ‘koinon of the Eteocarpathians’ (from the island of Carpathos, near Rhodes) for the gift of a cypress-tree for the temple of ‘Athena who rules Athens’; they are granted in return autonomy and retention of their own property, and there may be a reference to withdrawal of troops. A very Achaemenid scenario, therefore: a community sends a gift to the centre, perhaps in a situation of military crisis, and is rewarded with a privileged status (though one that later evidence suggests it failed to retain long). Ma accepts the recent suggestion that, despite their name (‘true Carpathians’), the mysterious koinon of the Eteocarpathians is in fact a new creation, a splinter community securing benefits for themselves, at the expense of their neighbours, in exchange for providing the Athenians ready access to valuable resources. They are ‘an invention of empire, imposed on the political geography of the island’, but also an illustration of how ‘local actors can achieve agency within a supra-local empire, by channelling the inevitably heavy touch of imperial control’. The converse of this is that they show how the ruling power could exploit local tensions, dividing and ruling; the\n\n5\n\nRobert Parker theme of Athenian flexibility and responsiveness to local circumstances was also raised by Kallet. The Athenians also operate on a regional level by requiring the Coans, Cnidians and Rhodians to aid the Eteocarpathians in case of need. The consequence of all this for the student of the empire is the need for a ‘detailed, sympathetic human geography of the empire’ which would show up the complexity of the interaction between ‘local and supra local viewpoints’. How else, on a political level, did Athenian control of the empire work? The idea that one method was the export of democratic institutions is already found in several ancient sources (as was noted earlier, it was seized on with disgust by the anti-democrat William Mitford), but even the earliest such source notes that the principle was not applied consistently: in situations of civil strife, it emerges, the Athenians had occasionally attempted to side with ‘the best’, if always with unsatisfactory results.9 Moderns who discuss the issue seldom commit themselves on its precise scale. In the reassessment of 425/4, the Athenians sought to levy tribute from at least 380 sources: how many of these should we suppose to have been democracies, and, if democracies, how many imposed through Athenian intervention? Quite a limited number of conspicuous cases could have created the perception. Roger Brock’s contribution is an attempt to get as far beyond generalisation as the evidence allows. His first move is to stress that the situation changed during the Peloponnesian War period, when in so many states ‘the democratic leaders sought to bring in the Athenians and the oligarchs the Spartans’ (Thuc. 3.82.1); but none of the sources which speak of Athenian imposition of democracies is early enough not to have been influenced by that experience or other distorting factors which followed it (such as the Spartan imposition of narrow oligarchies). He goes on to note that, though democracies in allied states are certainly attested, few pre-war instances can be quoted where they demonstrably had their origin in Athenian intervention: Thasos, very probably, in 463, Erythrae in 453/2 (?), Samos in 440, Miletus by 434. But it is not certain even that democracies were imposed after the suppression of the revolts on Euboea in 446 and Samos in 439; and in many important cities oligarchies demonstrably survived into and well beyond the 440s. The presence of dynasts and tyrants in the tribute lists has always been manifest. Athenian foreign policy was pragmatic: even during a stasis they might side with oligarchs, and there were kings who were honorary citizens of Athens. To provoke an intervention in favour of democracy, one or more of several factors were required: opportunity (as most notably the suppression of a revolt); a favourable ‘cost benefit analysis’ (as with mineral-rich Thasos); security considerations (pre-empting a revolt). Such interventions undeniably occurred; but, Brock concludes, there was no consistently-pursued policy driven by ideological commitment. Peter Thonemann’s paper takes us away from this familiar Greek world with its seesawing between oligarchy and democracy. But, obedient to\n\n6\n\nIntroduction Ma’s exhortation, it very decidedly adopts a local viewpoint. It begins ‘high in the forested hills above the modern coastal resort of Kas, in Central Lycia’, and, as Thonemann reconstructs the process by which in the second half of the fifth century the house of Kheriga, dynast of Xanthos and Phellos, acquired control of a vast stretch of Western and Central Lycia, the reader may wonder how Athens will re-enter the picture. It had long been known that the defeat of an Athenian raiding force led by Melesander to Caria and Lycia in 430/29 (known from Thucydides) was mentioned also in the Lycian portion of the great trilingual stele set up by Kheriga in Xanthos c. 400 BC; the stele shows how far inland Melesander’s force had got, to Kyaneai in central Lycia. Thonemann adopts and expands a recent reinterpretation by D. Schürr of the following passage of the stele to show that it refers to the defeat of a further and much larger Athenian raiding expedition known from Thucydides, that of Lysicles in autumn 428; he suggests that the turacssi of the stele is an indigenous place-name interpreted by the Greeks as what they called Mt Thorax, by Magnesia on the Maeander, and gives the site of Lysicles’ defeat. (It had already been shown by Louis Robert that the battle must have occurred in that region.) What is more important, he makes it very likely that the operation against Lysicles was carried out on the instructions of a high Persian official based at Kaunos in Caria, and that it was led by Amorges son of Pissouthnes, later to be well known as an Athenian-supported rebel against Darius II but here leading a Carian and Anaiitan army against the Athenian raiders. The ‘cold war’ between Persia and Athens from the early 440s down to 423 or thereabouts was perhaps, he suggests, a good deal warmer than emerges from Thucydides’ narrative. Persia continued to matter to the Athenian empire, therefore, not just as a model but as a continuing source of pressure from the east, a successful rival for the allegiance of Lycian and Carian communities. Thonemann’s argument underlines the importance for the Greek historian of texts not written in Greek, and appropriately he ends with a Lycian perspective. Why does Kheriga commemorate two defeats over Athenian forces of which one was won by a rival Lycian dynast and the other occurred far outside Lycia with (as it seems) no Lycian involvement? Minor engagements though they were from an Athenian perspective, for a native of south-west Asia Minor they were crucial moments of resistance to the foreign aggressor, ‘the Lycian Marathon and Salamis’. Thucydides discusses the empire in terms of domination and politics, not economics. But he emphasises the vast financial superiority with which the imperial power entered the Peloponnesian War (2.13.3-5); and Aristophanes’ Bdelycleon treats the empire as a funnel which, but for the villainy of demagogues, would pour vast wealth into the pockets of ordinary Athenians (Wasps 656-718). We would do well, Kallet urges, to stop considering it as an empire, misleading term, at all, and view it instead as an economic zone. The economics of empire and the broader economic\n\n7\n\nRobert Parker consequences of empire are central and perplexing themes which need to be tackled on a wide basis. The scarcity of monumental building in Ionia in the fifth century used to be taken as proof of impoverishment caused by Athenian domination; Robin Osborne (1999) has pointed out that, while temple building proves prosperity, the failure to build does not prove destitution, and has suggested that Ionia may in fact have been doing quite well. The archaeological record of most of the Greek world needs to be scrutinised with issues such as these in mind, to build on the foundations laid by Nixon and Price (1990) in a pioneering study.10 That task must be reserved for another volume. But Jack Kroll discusses here one central economic topic that has been much illuminated by recent research. From the late sixth century or a little thereafter Athens coined silver on a very large scale; and Athenian owls were the dollar of the fifth century, the ‘most sought-after trade specie of the Eastern Mediterranean world’, hugely represented in near eastern and Egyptian hoards. This monetary pre-eminence of Athens went back to the strike of silver ore at Laurion around 520-515 BC and thus predated the establishment of the empire; but a new and intensified phase that produced the voluminous standardised tetradrachms of the second half of the century perhaps began with the transfer of the league treasury to Athens in 454 and the recoining of silver that came to the city as tribute. Individuals too, Athenian and foreign, may have been able to bring in silver for (re)minting. It was doubtless in response to the sheer dominance of Attic coin that, as Thomas Figueira argued, many local mints ceased production; and the famous ‘standards decree’ passed (Kroll argues) not long before 414 BC which required allied cities to use Attic coins, weights and measures sought to impose as a binding norm what was already a widespread practice. The spread of Attic coin was market-driven, and individual traders and middlemen were to a large extent its agents. But state actions, such as the treasury transfer, and legislation also had a role. Public and private, commercial and political interweave inextricably, and the power of Athens’ coinage was a correlate to the power of her fleet (but lasted longer: the Egyptian preference for Athenian silver continued down to the time of Alexander). The most important form of economic exploitation of the empire, Alfonso Moreno insists with due emphasis, was the expropriation of foreign land. All attempts to downdate the onset of ‘harsh imperialism’ have to confront the fact that from c. 450 the Athenians revived the practice (which they had applied in Chalcis in 506 BC, and perhaps even earlier) of implanting settlers on a large scale (‘cleruchies’) on land carved out of the territories of conquered states, and not of enemies as at Chalcis but of rebellious allies. The cleruchy established on Lesbos in 427 brought in 100 talents annually, more than three times the highest level of tribute exacted from any individual state. Of all the abuses of the fifth century empire which the Athenians forswore when drafting the prospectus for its\n\n8\n\nIntroduction planned fourth-century successor, none received such emphasis as this. As for the mitigating factors standardly adduced (not that either would have been much consolation to the victims), Moreno disputes both. The cleruchies were not garrisons responsive to military needs; their public utility was rather (Euboea in particular) as a reliable source of imported grain. Nor were they a form of poor relief. On the contrary, he argues somewhat controversially, the portions of allied land assigned to each cleruch were large, and directly or indirectly the cleruchic system was responsible for the sometimes enormous overseas land holdings of rich Athenians attested both epigraphically and in literature. Previous inhabitants might be required to work the land for Attic masters in semi-servitude, if not expelled completely. Forms of exploitation rendered impossible in Attica itself by the reforms of Solon were cheerfully applied overseas by the dreaded ‘Attic neighbours’ of the proverb. Many further essays, manifestly, could have been included in this volume. Some topics we passed by because good recent work, on religion, for instance,11 or on the Athenian understanding of their empire as above all a matter of rule over islands,12 or on Thucydides’ presentation of the empire,13 was not to be repeated. Athens’ aspirations in southern Italy and Sicily are surely not irrelevant to the control she actually exercised elsewhere; that topic, we augur, will be revitalised with the imminent publication of Simon Hornblower’s commentary on the relevant books of Thucydides. We have not tried to locate Athenian rule within a general typology of imperialisms, for fear that the initial docketing as ‘empire’ might misdescribe the phenomenon.14 But Polly Low’s recent remarks on interventionism and empire have underlined the value of a comparative approach: the Athenians were not the only self-proclaimed ‘defenders of the weak’ known to history who sought by such interventions useful expansions of territory and influence.15 One tendency shared by many essays in this volume is a desire to differentiate, to insist that the Athenians sought local solutions to local problems, that chronologically too there is no simple progression to be traced from hegemony to empire. This is not, we trust, a bowing of the knee to post-modernism’s mistrust of master narratives. It is rather a recognition of the extraordinary situation of the Athenians when they found themselves, beyond all expectation and precedent, claiming leadership over hundreds of widely-dispersed communities. How could the thing be done, without existing institutional and bureaucratic structures?16 Inevitably there must have been much improvisation, many false starts, much changing opinion. Through Thucydides’ genius, nothing is more familiar to most students of Greek history than the empire. We need to recover a sense of its strangeness.

Since the publication of Richard Jenkyns’ and Frank Turner’s landmark books, a great deal of work has been dedicated to assessing how and why the reputation of Classical Athens was transformed in nineteenth-century British scholarship.2 It is now widely accepted that the transformation from anathema to exemplum took place partly owing to the fact that democracy, in the second third of the nineteenth century, became an acceptable constitutional form, particularly among liberal British practitioners of Greek historiography.3 Modern analyses of the reputation of Athens have not yet, however, explored pre-twentieth-century views of fifth-century Athenian power in any depth. This paper will attempt to add a new dimension to the story of Athenian reputation: that of eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentiethcentury British, French and German attitudes to the Athenian empire as they arose in the narrative historiography of ancient Greece.4 By tracing the development of perceptions of this subject, I endeavour to make two main points: I shall illustrate the tendency to perceive Athenian power in terms of contemporary colonial realities and shall suggest that changes in perceptions of Athenian power have been inspired not always by the discovery of new evidence, but also by the intellectual milieu and colonialist and political perspectives of those who were engaged in the writing of history. The eighteenth century The survey begins in the eighteenth century, when a growing enthusiasm for narrative historiography combined with growing interest in Greek antiquity to inspire the publication of a number of histories of Greece.5 As this genre emerged, the theme of the rise and fall of the Athenian empire was a central one, for the theme of the succession of empires was an important one in eighteenth-century histories of antiquity.6 Some of the earliest verdicts on Athens were resoundingly negative, and fitted the\n\n13\n\nPeter Liddel narrative into the model of history as the rise and fall of empires, morals and appropriate social structures. One such work was Temple Stanyan’s The Grecian History of 1707,7 which compared Athens negatively with Sparta.8 Stanyan claimed that while the establishment of the ‘Athenian Confederacy’ was a mark of her greatness, the levy of the tribute, the influx of money into Athens and the conversion of ‘Friends and Confederates, to a Condition little better than that of Tributaries and Vassals’ was the start of her ruin.9 As early as Stanyan, therefore, the Thucydidean theme of the transformation of Delian confederacy into Athenian empire made its mark. Oliver Goldsmith’s Grecian History of 1774, on the other hand, was influenced heavily by his reliance on Plutarch’s Lives and the moralising work of Rollin.10 It extended the period of the Persian Wars to the 440s and had very little to say about Athenian power as a historical unit, conceiving of them as self-styled ‘Protectors of Greece’.11 His lack of interest in Athenian power was no surprise: Goldsmith was more interested in the ways in which the Spartan constitution served as a model for emulation. But Goldsmith’s and Stanyan’s preference for Sparta was a way of thinking about Greek history that was falling out of fashion in the last third of the eighteenth century. The first writer to draw parallels between ancient Athenian and modern European imperialism in this era was the French Enlightenment thinker Montesquieu. In his pioneering study of political sociology, The Spirit of the Laws, first published in 1748, he considered how Greek cities managed their commercial interests. While he concluded that the Athenians did not engage in the opportunities offered to them by the resources of their mines or the multitude of their slaves, he described them as managers of a sea-empire; moreover, he suggested that pseudo-Xenophon’s description of Athens as an island was reminiscent of England.12 Comparison was also at the forefront of E. Montagu’s work of 1759, which warned against the possibility that the luxury, effeminacy and corruption that brought Athens down might afflict the liberty, happiness and existence of the British: Our liberty, our happiness, and our very existence as a people, depend upon our naval superiority supported by our military virtue and publick spirit. Nothing, humanly speaking, but luxury, effeminacy and corruption can ever deprive us of this envied superiority. What an accumulated load of guilt therefore must lye upon any future administration, who, to serve the ends of faction, should ever precipitate Britain from her present height down to the abject state of the Athenians, by encouraging these evils to blast all publick virtue in their unlimited progress.13\n\nThe insecurities of naval power suggested by Montagu’s unsettling diatribe were exacerbated in the late eighteenth century by events such as the American revolutionary war of 1776-83. British colonialist anxieties were reflected in contemporary Greek historiography, perhaps most\n\n14\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power clearly in the work of William Young. Young, a colonial governor,14 sugar plantation owner and Whig opponent of the abolition of the slave trade, won fame with his The Spirit of Athens of 1777.15 It is a surprisingly liberal work, and its praise for Athens as a ‘free republic’ takes its lead from the ideas of Montesquieu and German neo-humanism rather than from contemporary British historians. The 1786 edition of this work, entitled The History of Athens, cited Montesquieu and suggested that the story of Athens offered valuable warnings to the British, given his principle that: The tendencies of the state to accession of empire, and the obstacles to continuance of foreign influence and distant dominion … are no where more forcibly exemplified than in the History of Athens.16\n\nNot a critic of empire per se, he offered criticism of Athenian policy, suggesting that in the rush to form an alliance to sustain the war against Persia, the Greeks had failed to consider properly what would be the most expedient organisation in a post-war situation.17 Moreover, he commented cuttingly on the dangers of mixing democracy and empire: Extensive conquests are destructive to the people whose form of government approaches to the free or democratic … among the principles of their decline is that instinctive activity, pushing on to acquisitions dangerous to, and corruptive of, the possessors.18\n\nAs the son of a colonial governor, plantation owner and a governor in waiting, Young’s account of Athens focussed on the benefits from empire for the commercial power and imperial ruler: dominion of the seas and connections of trade led to a growth in the number of ‘foreign excursions’ and guests: ‘national prejudices were thus broken in upon; the minds of men became more knowing and enlarged’.19 The republican upheavals in France and America in the last thirty years of the eighteenth century inspired anti-democratic sentiments among the aristocracies of Europe, and these are most clearly expressed in William Mitford’s History of Greece.20 By contrast to Young, Mitford was keen to distance the ancient example from modern reality. According to his brother, Lord Redesdale, he believed that the experience of the Greek states was quite foreign to the ‘extensive territory and free condition of the British islands’ and that the history of Greece illustrated the evils that arose from the tendency of Greek states to impose a tyranny of citizens over other citizens.21 As the most vehement opponent of democracy in its classical Athenian form, he portrayed the fifth-century Athenian exercise of power in largely negative terms. Mitford took the line that the Confederacy – as he calls it at its inception – was repressive from the start given that the Hellenotamiai were under the control of the Athenian people. The\n\n15\n\nPeter Liddel allies, he suggested, were blinded to the potential consequences of empire by the ‘wisdom and equity’ of Aristides.22 For Mitford, the growing power of the democratic body corrupted the attempts of her leaders, or government, to organise a balanced imperial policy.23 Moreover, the new expenses induced by democratic payment led the Athenians to increase tribute and exert tighter control over its levy; by transferring the legislative, judicial and financial aspects of imperial control to the power of the demos, Athens became a ‘tyrant-city’, and her expansion became driven by the popular desire for conquest rather than calculation.24 While he identified the extraction of a growing amount of tribute and the shift of the treasury from Delos to Athens as central factors in the growing repressiveness of Athenian management of the organisation,25 what irritated Mitford most about the Athenian empire was her supposed habit (cf. Brock, this volume) of imposing democratic regimes in her subject states: Had Athens had a government so constituted as to be capable of a wise and steady administration, men were not wanting, qualified by abilities and by information, to direct the business of an empire. But, of all forms of government, democracy is not only the most capricious but the most selfish. The Athenians were jealous in the highest degree of communicating the rights of Athenian citizens; and the policy employed, however in the existing circumstances necessary, to hold such extensive and populous territories under subjection to one little state, consisting of less that thirty thousand families, was execrable. To coerce all by the force of its native military was impossible. The superiority of its navy gave some facility for the command of the islands. But the general policy for maintaining sovereignty was founded on that division into parties, almost universally pervading the Grecian commonwealths, to which we have so often had occasion to advert.26\n\nMoreover, democracy, for Mitford, was a bad form of government because it was partisan and allowed the interests of those with power to override the interests of the wealthy. For instance, the distribution of Mytilenean territory to Athenian cleruchs in 427 BC, he suggested, was ‘according to the genius of democracy … calculated rather for private emolument than public advantage’.27 The workings of the empire were hampered also by the character of Greek political life, which, being made up of so many discordant parts, lacked a proper interest in the prosperity of all. Indeed, his interpretation of Pericles’ Congress decree was that it was a manifesto for Greek political unity, the rejection of which by the Greek states forced the Athenians to become more repressive in their control of their subjects.28 Like Young, Mitford had nothing bad to say about empire per se: his criticism was focussed on the democratic administration of empire and the failure of the Athenians to unite the Greek states into a commonwealth of common interests.\n\n16\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power Liberal Athenian imperialism The transformation of the Athenian reputation was set in motion by the time of Edward Bulwer Lytton’s Athens: Its Rise and Fall, the first instalment of which was published in 1837. Bulwer Lytton is better known as a novelist and MP, who was offered the throne of Greece on the abdication of King Otto in 1862.29 The third, lost, part of his work was discovered by Oswyn Murray in a Hertfordshire archive as recently as 2002, and showed that he had planned to extend praise to the Athenian democracy in the era of the Peloponnesian War.30 It is of no surprise therefore that his portrait of the Athenian empire, even in the sections of his work published while he was living, was rather different from that of Mitford. Bulwer Lytton’s analysis of the Athenian empire led to a rather chequered balance-sheet. He criticised the Athenians for subjecting themselves to what he saw as the independent and spiralling forces of power, which led them to become reliant on oppression and injustice.31 He noted also that Athenian cleruchies in the territory of Athens’ subject-cities were resented in the same way as the Irish resented British settlements,32 but at the same time he challenged Mitford’s claim that cleruchies were sent out only in the interests of the populist politicians or greedy common proprietors.33 Bulwer Lytton reversed Mitford’s formulation that democracy was the ruin of empire: empire was the ruin of democracy because the command that Athens obtained was disproportionate to her natural resources and tended to ‘rot away’ the spirit of her power while provoking hostility from her subjects.34 Though his interpretation of the nature of Athenian power reacted to that of Mitford, both judgements pivoted on the Athenians’ financial policy towards their empire. For Bulwer Lytton, while the transfer of judicial courts of the dependant allies to Athens was oppressive,35 the financial burden of the empire was light. He insisted that the amount demanded had been exaggerated in the literary sources, pointing to the small amounts of tribute mentioned (2000 and 1000 drachmai) on what he called ‘Chandler’s inscription’ (the earliest-known fragment of Athenian tribute lists which was later to become known as the Reassessment decree of 425-4 BC).36 He suggested that discontent was caused not by the amount of tribute but resentment at it being demanded, and drew on the parallel of Irish peasants paying taxes to the Protestant tithe-owners, claiming, ‘people will pay a pound for what they like, and grudge a farthing for what they hate’.37 Bulwer Lytton’s closing verdict on Athenian power was one of an apologist and supporter of imperialism: once Athens was in the clutches of empire, she would never surrender it: who, he asked, could ask England to surrender her colonies?38 Bulwer Lytton’s work was pioneering in its revisionary view of the Athenian empire, but also in the depth of its explicit comparison with contemporary English power. However, it was George Grote’s History of\n\n17\n\nPeter Liddel Greece (1st edn, 2 vols, London 1846-56) that was to have most impact when it comes to the reputation of Athenian power.39 And certainly, Grote attempted a defence of Athenian power that was more comprehensive and more philosophical. It was philosophical in its enduring interest in the relationship between duties and liberty.40 He even suggested that the Athenian empire was an organisation better suited to the performance of duties and their coexistence with individual liberty than was the citycommunity culture of fifth-century Greece: he did, however, worry that the system of obligations set up at the opening of the Delian League may have infringed the Greek tendency towards political autonomy.41 Nevertheless, the Athenians performed a duty by keeping the alliance together, exacting from every member a regulated quota of men or money, and by keeping the Persians away.42 He explained the transformation of the Delian confederacy into an Athenian empire by reference to the failure of members to perform their duties in an appropriate fashion. The synod of the league at Delos failed in its object to protect the rights of members.43 It therefore became the duty of the Athenians to repress those members, who, like the Naxians, abandoned the league.44 Once the majority of members switched their payment from ships to money, the original feeling of equal rights and partnership in the confederacy was extinguished.45 This, he suggested, led to Athenian interventions in the internal government of their subjects. After the disintegration of the system of rights and duties, Athens gradually became tyrannical, though she had no predetermined plan to reach that stage.46 Such a conclusion pre-empted, and perhaps even inspired, J.R. Seeley’s famous view of British imperialism, enunciated in his 1883 work, The Expansion of England, asserting that the English had acquired their empire ‘in a fit of absence of mind’.47 Despite her behaviour at times of desperation,48 the Athenian empire, Grote concluded, was a remarkable achievement, ‘a sight marvellous to contemplate’, and the Athenians performed a ‘mighty task’ by holding together so many little states, and overcoming ‘that force of political repulsion instinctive in the Grecian mind’. It performed a service to the Greek states by keeping the Persian threat at bay, and improving the material condition of the maritime Greeks.49 His final verdict on the empire even suggested that it acted as a stimulus to the liberty of the Greek states, even if it demanded strict obedience from them: Nothing in the political history of Greece is so remarkable as the Athenian empire; taking it as it stood in its completeness … it is a sight marvellous to contemplate, and its working must be pronounced, in my judgement, to have been highly beneficial to the Grecian world. No Grecian state except Athens could have sufficed to organise such a system, or to hold, in partial, though regulated, continuous and specific communion, so many little states, each animated with that force of political repulsion instinctive of the Greek mind. … If in her imperial character she exacted obedience, she also fulfilled duties and ensured protection – to a degree incomparably greater than was ever\n\n18\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power realised by Sparta. And even if she had been ever so much disposed to cramp the free play of mind and purpose among her subjects – a disposition which is no way proved – the very circumstances of her own democracy, with its open antithesis of political parties, universal liberty of speech, and manifold individual energy, would do much to prevent the accomplishment of such an end, and would act as a stimulus to the dependent communities even without her own intention.50\n\nSuch comments serve as a philosophical elaboration of the Whig imperialism of Lord Macaulay’s speech to the House of Commons in 1833, which argues that the British, in arranging a code of laws for India, were responsible for introducing it to liberty.51 Indeed, Grote employed comparisons explicitly in order to reinforce the idea that the Athenian empire was a liberal organisation which behaved like a modern imperial state.52 He engaged with other theoretical constructions of liberal imperialism in his attempt to elucidate the nature of Athenian power: Grote used the model of the government of dependencies, a concept developed in the 1841 work of G.C. Lewis, a distinguished classicist and MP for Hereford.53 To Lewis, the British system of colonialism had gone further than the Athenians in developing a science of dependent government.54 This was a formulation which Grote reversed. He suggested that a reading of Lewis’ treatise illustrated the number of instances of misgovernment in modern times, which showed that Athens was ‘comparatively a creditable figure’.55 One example that Grote focused on in an extended footnote related to an action brought by a Minorquian, Antony Fabrigas, who presented a redress for grievances to General Mostyn, the British governor of the island, in 1773. The governor’s response was to arrest the complainant and exile him to Spain without any trial, on the grounds that he had complained ‘in a manner which [was] deemed improper’.56 At a later date, Fabrigas brought a case to the Court of Common Pleas against Mostyn, claiming that his expulsion amounted to a miscarriage of justice. The unsuccessful defence made by the counsel for Mostyn took the line that a dependency is governed not for its own interest but for that of the dominant state and that for the sake of Mediterranean trade, it was important to stamp out Spanish patriotism in Minorca. The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff and awarded £3000 damages on the basis that Fabrigas was not attempting to stir up mutiny and sedition in the garrison. Grote’s interpretation of this trial and verdict was that it illustrated both ‘the illiberal and humiliating vein of sentiment which is apt to arise in the citizens of the supreme government towards the subordinate’, and also the protection which the English jury trial offered to citizens of the dependency against oppression. He suggested that the feelings of the law-courts at Athens were similarly directed to protecting the citizens of the subject-states. Revolt and resentment, for Grote, were a characteristic of empire, rather than ‘the product of peculiar cruelty and oppression on\n\n19\n\nPeter Liddel the part of the Athenian democracy, as Mr Mitford and so many others have sought to prove’.57 The problem with Grote’s interpretation of Athenian power is that he was writing at one of those very rare periods of time when the data for Classical history were undergoing significant development. And his chief shortcoming, as a historian, was his failure to acknowledge the potential value of this evidence. The fifty-year period from 1830 to 1880 saw not only the discovery of a wealth of inscriptional evidence but also the development of new ways of publishing inscriptions and deploying them in the reconstruction of history.58 The German scholar Boeckh had raised the possibility that inscriptions might make a considerable contribution in the first edition of his Staatshaushaltung of 1817.59 It must be acknowledged, though, that the significance of epigraphical evidence to the historian of Athenian power would not have been obvious to anyone but the most scrupulous readers of Boeckh’s Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum (182877): the documents relevant to Athenian power were scattered and more fragmentary than they were in later epigraphical corpora.60 The era of epigraphical discovery After Ottoman rule in Athens came to an end in the early 1830s, there came to light a substantial number of previously unknown inscriptions on the Athenian acropolis. A number of them were first thought to be catalogues of members contributing to the imperial tribute; they were published for the first time in the 1835 work of the Greek archaeologist Kyriakos Pittakys.61 But it was the publication and interpretation of the fragments by Alexandros Rangavis in 1842 which elevated the level of available knowledge of what he called, in his French language publication, the ligue Athénienne.62 As well as publishing the 117 fragments of the tribute lists, he made a catalogue of member-states, listed the offices and terms relevant to the organisation, and suggested that the tribute fluctuated.63 He suggested that the amounts listed on the stones represented a 1/120th of the annual total, listing the amount paid for three days, but raised an alternative possibility slightly closer to the truth: that the figures represent a 1/100th quota that was given to Athena.64 While the Greek scholars were important in making epigraphical data available, and thereby revolutionising the level of detail in reconstructions of the administration of the Athenian empire, they did not devise re-interpretations of Athenian power that were as radical as those of Bulwer Lytton or Grote. Despite Rangavis’ enthusiasm for a putative Greek imperial future,65 he did not attempt to set up the ancient Athenian example as a model or counter-model. In fact, when a history of Greece was written in Greek by Konstantinos Paparrigopoulos,66 it was too general to exploit the details of the newly-discovered inscriptions. Moreover, Paparrigopoulos was more interested in Alexander the Great and Byzantium as\n\n20\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power manifestations of the perennial theme of Greek unity and nationhood than in the Athenian empire.67 I shall now turn to the question of how inscriptions were employed in historiography. The significance of epigraphical discoveries was worked out more fully than ever before in the first monograph to appear on the subject, U. Koehler’s Urkunden und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des delische-attischen Bundes of 1869. Koehler’s account of the Delian League was unrivalled in its exactitude, and suggested that the transformation (Verwandlung) of Hegemonie into Herrschaft took place in the late 460s in the aftermath of Eurymedon.68 Koehler used inscriptions to emphasise the size and extent of the confederacy and empire, showing the power that was made manifest and contained in the collection of a tribute. Most importantly, he reconstructed from fragments the Reassessment decree of 425 69 BC, and argued, by reference to that document and the quota lists, that the tribute was increased by a single legislative act to more than 1200 talents.70 In doing so, he supported the line of Boeckh and others that the tribute was raised drastically during the course of the Peloponnesian War. But this work did not lack a political angle: Koehler also suggested that the organisation might be viewed as a Bund, and reflected the desire of the Greek states for unity.71 The engagement of Greek power with the contemporary German unificatory agenda emerged more starkly in the contribution of the young Wilamowitz. The title of his birthday address for the King of Prussia and the German Emperor in 1877 can be translated ‘On the Greatness of the Athenian Empire’. In the published version of the work, he piled praise on the national unification achieved by the fifth-century Athenian Reich.72 He praised the Athenians for exporting their Industrieprodukte in das Barbarenland, for the duties performed by her citizens, for the promotion of Ionian racial identity, and suggested that national unity (Einheit) of Greece, which was the key to Greek greatness, necessitated the leadership of Athens.73 He even recommended Athens to the emperor as an active approach to ‘colonialpolitik’.74 It was a clear manifesto for the emerging Prussian control of Germany established by the birth of the German empire as recently as 1871. Like his predecessor Curtius, who slotted inscriptions into the revised edition of his Griechische Geschichte,75 he used Athenian epigraphy and archaeology of the fifth century to assess the extent and nature of Athenian power, and offered his readers an appendix on the Chalcis decree, discovered in June 1876. The fact that the new epigraphical evidence seemed to sit comfortably with the current trends of German scholarship was made particularly clear in one remarkable case of intuition. As David Lewis noted,76 it was in this address that Wilamowitz suggested, on the basis of a passage in Aristophanes’ Birds, that there was Athenian legislation enforcing, across the empire, a set of common coins, weights and measures.77 He appears not to have been aware of the fragment of the coinage decree which had been\n\n21\n\nPeter Liddel copied at Smyrna and published by Baumeister in 1855.78 In 1894 another fragment of the coinage decree was found on Siphnos, and Wilhelm’s publication of the pair in IG XII 5 480 in 1903 showed Wilamowitz’s suggestion to be correct. This publication inspired numismatists like Weil and Gardner to scrutinise the numismatic record in the light of the documentary evidence.79 Gardner proposed, in his History of Ancient Coinage of 1918, that the enforcement of Athenian coinage illustrated the exertion of Athenian power which she imposed in the interests of her national pride and commercial advantage. He observed that not even the King of Persia tried to control the gold issues of coins within his dominions.80 While the appearance of the inscribed version of the coinage decree certainly added to the detail of the Athenian empire, and influenced the numismatists’ view of Athenian imperialism, it did serve to confirm Wilamowitz’s alreadyexisting hypothesis based on a literary reference: what we can observe is that the epigraphical evidence was serving to confirm what was already hypothesised rather than shaping interpretations of the empire. Before Wilamowitz’s hypothesis on the coinage decree, the publication of the first edition in 1873 of the Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum by Adolf Kirchhoff had drawn together the decrees and accounts relevant to the Athenian empire for the first time. The effect of this publication on scholarly practice was revolutionary, as it was followed by a glut of articles dedicated to elucidating aspects of Athenian imperialism, and the subject became a common one for dissertations.81 The new body of epigraphical material triggered a range of new debates and inspired articles, dissertations and monographs, which made extensive use of epigraphy, disputing the extent and chronology of membership, nature of cleruchies, tribute and jurisdiction. In France, the earliest monograph on the subject was Guiraud’s (1883), a wide-ranging study of Athenian power. Epigraphic evidence was cited extensively: he referred to the inscribed decrees for Erythrae, Colophon and Chalcis to illustrate the ways in which the Athenians reinforced their political authority.82 He drew the conclusion that the intemperate democracy of the Athenians abused its power, spending tribute on the city and on public festivals, and undermined the Greek principles of autonomy by imposing democracies.83 This meant that Sparta became a liberator in the Peloponnesian War by offering an alternative to the forced unity and ‘les violences de la democratie’ of Athens. He pointed out that the tribute assessment and other aspects of imperial control were sanctioned entirely by the decree of the ecclesia.84 However, such an anti-democratic reading is absent from the most important Francophone history of Greece of this era, that of Duruy.85 He appeared to take the line of Grote, that the allies became more dependent and Athens the sovereign in gradual stages, and that the nature of Athenian power changed as a result of her subjects’ choices.86 He revised\n\n22\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power Guiraud’s employment of the epigraphical evidence to suggest that the decrees of Erythrae, Colophon and Chalcis showed that the Athenians cared about legality.87 What both these French historians observed was the depth of Athenian interference in the affairs of their colonies: a reflection of the close political relationship between France and its colonies.88 Epigraphy, despite the resistance of Jowett (whose hostility we shall encounter presently), certainly did have an impact on Anglophone literary scholarship at the end of the nineteenth century: but this appears to have happened more readily on the Western side of the Atlantic. One area where this was the case was on the interpretation of Thucydides 1.77.1,89 the comments of the Athenian delegates on their treatment of allies made at the debate in Sparta before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. What was primarily at stake was how to explain the Athenian claim that they put themselves at a disadvantage (elassoumenoi) in the mysterious dikai xymbolaiai pros tous xummachous. Grote suggested that the Athenian claim that ‘the allies were admitted to the benefit of the Athenian trial and Athenian laws’ was reasonable: he commented that ‘the arrangement was not all pure hardship to the allies – the liability to be prosecuted was accompanied with the privilege of prosecuting for injuries received’.90 Grote’s position was in 1880 challenged by Goodwin, who, in the first number of the American Journal of Philology, argued that dikai xymbolaiai pros tous xymmachous were suits relating to ‘xymbolaia’, which he conjectured were ‘business suits’ involving allied states, and suggested that the speaker was whitewashing the ‘one-sided and compulsory’ nature of Athenian imperial jurisdiction.91Athens’ behaviour was contrasted with the comparatively egalitarian arrangements with which the United States dealt with overseas jurisdiction.92 But the field was changed by the introduction of German-style examinations of the epigraphy. In a lecture given to the Johns Hopkins Philological Association, published in American Journal of Philology for 1884, C.D. Morris re-examined the passage, and in so doing, transmitted a model of German scholarship. He drew extensively on the hypothesis put forward in a dissertation of J.M. Stahl (Muenster 1881) which introduced the newly-assembled epigraphical evidence for the jurisdiction of the empire and for commercial treaties with the Athenians.93 His reasoning was based on the epigraphical evidence, which he took as suggesting that the regular arrangement was that suits arising out of commercial treaties were decided in the courts of the defendant’s city, while serious crimes were tried in Athens. However, suits which arose from crimes committed between citizens of an allied state, he suggested (on the basis of the recently-discovered Chalcis decree, ML 52), were tried in the first instance at the local courts, with the provision that there should be an appeal to Athens in cases where the sentences were death, exile or atimia. But in order to reconcile this with the claim of the pseudo-Xenophontic Constitution of Athens (which he dated to 425) that the Athenians compelled the allies\n\n23\n\nPeter Liddel to come to Athens for court cases (1.16-18), Morris suggested that all but trivial matters were removed from the courts of the allies at some point between the 440s and 425 BC. Morris’ hypothesis, by introducing Stahl’s reading of the epigraphical evidence to Anglophone scholarship, was able to refine Grote’s liberal conclusions and to posit change in the nature of Athenian imperialism. What is striking is the fact that inscriptions were invoked to challenge Goodwin’s idea that the Athenian empire was repressive from its outset. It seems highly unlikely, however, that Grote would have agreed with the method of interpreting literary texts with the aid of inscriptions. At this point it is necessary, therefore, to return briefly to Grote: like Bulwer Lytton, he was aware of the fragment of the Reassessment decree, but asserted that ‘the stone is too damaged to give us much information’.94 This view was taken as part of a defence of his contentious position on the subject of the tribute which was, owing to epigraphical discoveries, to become untenable, but to which he was to cling in his later editions. The substance of this was to dispute the claim made in the oratorical sources and followed by Boeckh and other German scholars that the tribute was doubled to 1200 talents in the early years of the Peloponnesian War.95 Unaware of the Quota lists that had been known in Greece since the 1830s, in his early editions he doubted that it ever reached 1200 talents and suggested instead that there was a gradual increase which happened every fifth year.96 In a later edition, published after he had become aware of the magnitude of the epigraphical evidence, he clung on to this view defensively. But his comments amounted to an attack on the use of epigraphy in historical reconstruction: Had it been our good fortune to recover these Inscriptions complete, we should have acquired important and authentic information respecting the Athenian Tribute-system. But they are very imperfectly legible, and require at every step conjectural restoration as well as conjectural interpretation. To extract from them a consistent idea of the entire system, M. Boeckh has recourse to several hypotheses, which appear to me more ingenious than convincing.97\n\nThis was a reference to the second edition of Boeckh’s Staatshaushaltung of 1851 which dedicated some 380 pages to elucidation of the tribute lists,98 and elaborated or challenged some of Rangavis’ preliminary observations. Grote, on the other hand, appears to have missed the publication in 1842 of Rangavis. When he did become aware of the lists, Grote was unwilling to face the necessary revision of his defence of Athenian empire, or to admit that Thucydides omitted to mention such an increase in the amount of tribute. He had several interests at stake. He was dedicated to defending the ‘system of public economy’ designed by Pericles.99 He was also interested in protecting the reputation of the demagogues, hoping to steer clear of the claim of Plutarch (Aristides 24) that the demagogues gradually\n\n24\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power increased the tribute to 1300 talents in order to indulge the whims of the people.100 For Grote, good history was philosophical, and for the history of Athens, this meant an appropriate interpretation of Thucydides. He appears to have worried that the epigraphical evidence would disrupt his liberal interpretation of the Athenian empire. But it is possible that Grote was echoing a wider hostility among literary scholars to epigraphy, a debate which had its origins in the historical division between historiography and antiquarianism,101 but which appeared to be particularly entrenched in late nineteenth-century Britain.102 It was most clearly enunciated in the work of the Thucydidean scholar Benjamin Jowett, who believed that the value of studying Classical literature lay in its value as an intellectual training for a career in politics or civilian activity.103 In 1881, in an introductory essay to his translation of Thucydides, he criticised the application of inscriptions in extreme terms and with specific reference to the Athenian empire, and talked of the evil tendency of them to drive the historian to the habit of conjecture: The evil tendency of the study [of inscriptions] is that it encourages the habit of conjecture, which has already been one of the great corruptions of philology. There is a necessity for making too much out of a few letters or words, and thus appearing to obtain a result commensurate with the labour spent upon them. The slenderness of his materials leads the enquirer to snatch at the chance coincidences. A possible deduction from the inscriptions, such as the doubling of the Athenian tribute-money, or the transfer of the common treasury from Delos to Athens in the year 454 (resting only on the circumstance that in this year the quota lists begin), is repeated at second or third hand as a great historical discovery.104\n\nHe went on to criticise the shallowness of the epigrapher’s pleasures: To be busy on Greek soil, under the light of the blue heaven, amid the scenes of ancient glory, in reading inscriptions, or putting together fragments of stone or marble, has a charm of another kind than that which is to be found in the language of ancient authors.… Yet even to appreciate truly the value of such remains, it is to the higher study of the mind of Hellas and of her great men that we must return, finding some little pleasure by the way (like that of looking at an autograph) in deciphering the handwriting of her children amid the dust of her ruins.105\n\nJowett was in many ways clinging on to the view that the study of inscriptions was part of the inferior realm of antiquarianism; their study would contribute little to the maturation of a student’s mind. If they had any value, it was merely to confirm what the literary texts say.106 Even within Anglophone scholarship, this view was starting to recede: this was made clear in the historical commentaries contained in the first volume of The Collection of Greek Inscriptions in the British Museum published in\n\n25\n\nPeter Liddel 1874 which announced the British Museum’s epigraphical collection to the world of scholarship.107 It contained a number of documents relevant to the history of the empire, and Hicks’ commentary on the Cleinias decree asserted that Koehler’s reconstruction of the 425 assessment list disproved Grote’s conclusions on the tribute: ‘This important change, which Grote held to be unhistorical, as resting upon no better authority than the Orators, and passed over in silence by Thukydides, has now been established beyond question by the irrefragable evidence of the tribute-lists themselves, which display to us the exact amounts paid by the various allies before and after the alteration.’108 Newton’s essay ‘Of Greek Inscriptions’, first published in the Contemporary Review of 1876, reiterated Koehler’s position on the tribute. He also complained that little had been done to make the texts of Greek inscriptions accessible to the student, and called for a popular work giving their classification.109 Newton’s thoughts were an attempt at formulating a methodology for the use of inscriptions: he suggested (in a paper entitled ‘On the Study of Archaeology’ of 1880), that it was the business of the archaeologist to prepare the literature of documents for the historian, and that whereas the value of the Bisitun inscription and Rosetta stone were obvious, fragmentary texts need more preparation.110 A catalyst for change came with the appearance in 1882 of E.L. Hicks’ Greek Historical Inscriptions, a selection of documents with English commentary, many of them relevant to Athens in the fifth century. The introduction to this book revealed the attractions of epigraphy as a discipline which combined material and literary interest, and allowed direct engagement with the ancient world: ‘we are here face to face with state documents which Perikles may have issued, and Thucydides may have read’.111 He also attacked Jowett for being so engrossed by the genius of Thucydides, and suggested that this was the lingering echo of a controversy between those literary scholars, who saw little value in archaeological study, and those who welcomed its contribution.112 The fact that inscriptions were really coming to the forefront of the history of Athenian power in at least one educational institution is suggested in the record of past examination papers. In John Owens College, the forerunner of the Victoria University of Manchester, questions on the Athenian empire had appeared in examinations since the 1850s, but in the early 1880s an examination was set on Athenian naval confederations.113 It is likely that Hicks’ collection would have been used in teaching given the content of question 2 in the first paper of 1882-3, which asked its candidates to ‘Give some account of the documentary evidence to be found in the so-called Tribute-lists, and indicate its value for the history of the first Attic naval Federation’. Inscriptions soon made an appearance in the Anglophone narrative of Greek history. E. Abbott’s Pericles and the Golden Age of Athens, an emphatically anti-Grote and anti-Periclean history, appeared in 1891. He\n\n26\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power suggested that the Athenian decrees on Chalcis, Histiaia and Erythrae illustrated Athens becoming a ‘tyrant city’, and maintained that the fluctuating number of contributors in the tribute lists between 450 and 440 suggested that there was widespread discontent in the alliance.114 This hypothesis of a mid-century crisis became central to certain prominent later twentieth-century studies of Athenian imperialism.115 The view that Grote was wrong about the tribute reassessment appears to have become widely held. The formulation of Gardner was more extreme: Grote rejected on the ground of the silence of Thucydides, the assertion of some ancient authorities that the tribute which the Athenians exacted from their allies was doubled towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. Nor could the question between Thucydides and the other writers have ever been settled but for the testimony of the inscriptions published by Koehler in his Urkunden zur Geschichte des Delisch-attischen Bundes, which proves beyond question that such a raising of the tribute did occur. And the new fact tells against Grote’s view of the character of the Athenian government.116\n\nThe history of Athens was now being studied and written by scholars who, in their engagement with non-Anglophone scholarship and non-literary evidence, were ‘professionals’ whose histories combined the traditions of political historiography and antiquarianism. Their product was a new form of historical narrative which reacted against the philosophical turn of Grote’s work and the text-based fixations of Oxford scholars like Jowett. The reaction to liberalism The epigraphical turn of British historians appears to have coincided with the move away from Grote’s liberal verdict, and a new tendency: to view Athens as an economically self-interested entity. Four years after Cornford had argued that the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War was forced by a commercial party in Piraeus,117 Grundy’s Thucydides of 1911 introduced the epigraphical evidence to support his economic analysis of Athenian imperialism. He held that tribute supported the Parthenon fund and democratic payment, and argued, by reference to the rider in the Brea decree,118 that the sending out of cleruchies and colonies was part of an economic master-plan to find work for those who had been thrown into economic turmoil by the Athenian investment of capital in slaves. He suggested, on the basis of the Methone decree, that the Athenians regulated the corn trade from the Black Sea area and exerted influence over the economies of other Greek cities.119 The significance of the economic factor, he suggested, was not realised by the ancient Greek historians and was ignored by Thucydides because they were not seen as appropriate material for the highest literary form of composition – a nod perhaps to P. Gardner’s observation that the biggest contribution of epigraphic evidence was in those fields where the ancient writers are silent.120 Such an\n\n27\n\nPeter Liddel economic interpretation of imperialism was contemporary with, but perhaps a reaction to, the economically-minded liberal criticisms of empire which had arisen in the aftermath of the militarism and jingoism of the Boer War.121 What brings us back almost to a Mitfordian view was the contribution on the Athenian empire to the fifth volume of the Cambridge Ancient History of 1927 by E. Walker, suggesting that the transformation from confederacy to a bitterly-resented empire was the calculated intention of Pericles as a means of supporting radical democracy.122 Cary, in his essay on documentary sources for Greek history published in the same year, followed this line, suggesting that the documents of the Athenian empire marked the progress of Athenian despotism and restrictiveness.123 By contrast, the liberal Athenian empire of Bury’s History was largely without epigraphical reference, until Meiggs’ 1951 revised version.124 But it was not the case that the inclusion of epigraphical evidence dictated the interpretation of Athenian power. For Alfred Zimmern, Athens provided a historical paradigm for the reconciliation of great power with international co-operation.125 His chapter on ‘Citizenship’ was subtitled ‘Liberty, or the Rule of Empire’, and serves as a reminder that divergent views of empire coexisted in Anglophone circles in the early twentieth century. He viewed the Athenian empire as the ‘first great civilised attempt to form a state of many cities’, and echoed the views of Grote in perceiving the empire in terms of freedom and duties, taking the view that the Athenians were forced into imperial acquisition, that their empire was the ‘child of necessity’, and that the empire championed free trade and freedom from barbarians.126 He was therefore the first British scholar to introduce epigraphy to a large-scale liberal interpretation of the Athenian empire, drawing extensively on an edition of what was by that time Hill and Hicks’ Manual of Greek Inscriptions:127 his interpretation of the coinage decree, as a reflection of Greece’s readiness to adopt or imitate the ways of Athens, is particularly symptomatic of his interpretation: Athens had thus become recognized as a model State; and Greece was in the mood to adopt or imitate her ways in small things as well as in great. We can see this in the rapid spread of Athenian weights and measures and the Athenian coinage, or of systems arranged so as to work in with them. Athens was standardizing Greek coinage as she was unifying Greek law. She did not, of course, compel her allies to use only Attic money, or money coined on the Attic standard. But she naturally preferred that contributions should be paid in it; and there were indirect ways by which she could encourage it. It was only decent to pay Apollo, and later Athena, in the coinage they preferred to see.128\n\nBut Zimmern’s work bucked the trend, and his project had more far-reaching ambitions than the narrative interests of his contemporaries. By the early twentieth century, therefore, the British narrative of the Athenian empire was now epigraphically informed but, for the most part, was no\n\n28\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power longer dominated by liberal interpretations: a counter-revolution was complete, even if, as the example of Zimmern shows, a liberal discourse coexisted with the new conservativism.129 What was also clear is that the fruits of epigraphical scholarship made the history of Athenian power equally attractive to those analysts of contemporary imperialism who sought to refer to ancient Athens as a constructive or corrective example.130 Conclusion The first conclusion to draw is rather banal: that from at least the mid-eighteenth century to the early twentieth century, historians of Greece and commentators on empire in Western Europe were able to draw on the Athenian example as an imagined equivalent to contemporary nation-states in their attempts to make critical points about the past or the present. The points they made, and accordingly their interpretation of Athens, were contingent with their personal and national situations. The British historians saw the Athenian empire as a precursor to British sea power; some of them saw her as a harbinger of liberty; the Germans saw her as a model of unity; French opinion was divided but focussed on the close intervention of the Athenians in the affairs of their colonies. The second set of conclusions is more complicated and refers to the relation between the expansion of sources and the fluctuation of interpretation. (1) The paradigm shift inherent in Grote’s and Bulwer Lytton’s reconsideration of the Athenian empire was inspired not by the discovery of new evidence, but by the emergence of democracy as an acceptable political idea, the emergence of a liberal apology for colonialism, and the application of liberal and radical ideas to the writing of history: it was a revolution in political thought which inspired the first wave of change in British interpretations of Athenian power. (2) While Grote resisted epigraphy, apparently believing it would undermine his liberal conception of empire, I have noted that inscriptions were received less traumatically into the German tradition of scholarship because the dominant German paradigm concentrating on the unity and power of Athens appears to have been more hospitable to the details that epigraphy appeared to offer. (3) The emergence of an alternative to the liberal model coincided, and, to some degree, was inspired by a number of developments including the professionalisation of the writing of narrative Greek history, the introduction of epigraphical data to the picture, the shift away from political sociology, the economic turn, and a reaction to liberalism. (4) It would be wrong to say that inscriptions drove historians of Athenian power towards non-liberal interpretations. It was not in the nature of epigraphical evidence to oppose the liberal tradition of British\n\n29\n\nPeter Liddel Greek history; it did, however, offer ammunition that was used by scholars who wanted to make points to distinguish themselves from Grote’s interpretation. (5) What the discovery, publication and reception of inscriptions into the scholarly discourse did was to add a new level of refinement and detail, insight into the bureaucracy of imperial Athens, her instruments of power, and their presentation: this revolution is most visible in the work of Rangavis or German scholarship postdating the second edition of the Staatshaushaltung. On another level, they provided ammunition for scholarly debate and a contribution to the continuing professionalisation of the discipline of ancient Greek historiography. They opened the way for the coexistence of a broader spectrum of approaches: a liberal interpretation, like that of Zimmern, which tended to emphasise the stated intentions of Athenian public decrees, coexisted with a conservative reading, like that of Abbott, which presented the epigraphical record as offering insight into the repressive modes of Athenian imperialism. Questions that historians have asked of the Athenian empire since the middle of the eighteenth century have tended to reflect contemporary colonialist anxieties. They have chiefly related to its origins, popularity, the ‘balance sheet’ of its advantages and disadvantages, its means of control, its economic basis, the place of religion, the notion of ‘crisis’, and whether in fact Athenian power constituted an empire at all. However, more recently, scholarship has begun to develop a distinctively cultural and postcolonialist turn, discussing in detail questions of demography, the discourses of imperial economics and diplomacy, and scholars have attempted to reconsider the role of political and religious identities in the construction of imperial ideologies; one study has reconsidered the Athenian empire from the perspective of her island subjects.131 It is likely that in the near future more will be said on the revised chronology of Athenian imperialism, patterns of euergetism within the empire, relations with the east and eastern forms of imperialism (cf. Raaflaub and Ma in this volume), the impact and reception of that power on the medium-term development of the Athenian polis and the infrastructure of her subject states, and on the long-term forms of association and networking in the fourth-century and Hellenistic Aegean. But these new angles to the subject will, in all likelihood, be opened up principally by the re-examination of old evidence rather than the discovery of new evidence: with the exception of the publication of the coinage decree in 1903, and the republication of the Athenian tribute lists from 1939, the epigraphical sources were not, in the twentieth century, transformed to the same extent as they were over the course of the nineteenth century. Where new evidence is brought into the modern scholarly discourse on the Athenian empire for the first time, it is likely that it will have been long known already to practitioners of disciplines whose material is not always well-integrated\n\n30\n\n1. European Colonialist Perspectives on Athenian Power into the study of Athenian history (such as Lycian and near-eastern epigraphy [cf. Thonemann in this volume] or the archaeology of non-Attic Greece). One proposition that emerges from this study, therefore, is that it is not always discovery of new ancient evidence that encourages us to ask new questions or develop new hypotheses. New ideas and interpretations of historical phenomena often derive from the prioritisation of particular kinds of evidence, changes in modes of thought, and cross-fertilisation between different national traditions and across the genres of historiography, anthropology, sociology, literary criticism and material culture. If scholarship is on the cusp of another paradigm shift in the study of this subject, it is just as likely that this will be inspired by reinterpretation of the old evidence as by discovery of new evidence.
