HP: Brand overview

HP is a world-renowned brand that produces hardware and software for offices and private consumers. The founders of the brand are two Stanford University alumni, David Packard and William Reddington Hewlett. In 1939, they started their own business, eventually bringing many innovative products to the world. The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California (USA).

Meaning and History

The evolution of the HP logo reflects all of its transformations – from the moment the company was founded in a garage to its division into two parallel structures. The direct successor of the parent corporation was HP Inc. Her visual identification mark appeared in 1939 and did not change dramatically. The original version is black and white. The color of the logo was added only in the late 1970s. An innovative version is currently in use.

What is HP?

HP is a company that succeeded Hewlett-Packard. It was founded in 2015, while its predecessor was established in 1939. It is an American corporation that manufactures PCs, scanners, printers, and software and provides IT services. It is best known for its computers and has competed with market leaders such as Apple, Lenovo, and Dell.

1939 – 1954

The debut emblem directly reflects the company’s name, made up of the names of the founders – Hewlett and Packard. The logo also had a lot of related information that was of a marketing nature. In the middle of the rectangular background were the lowercase letters “hp” enclosed in a circle. Their ends protruded outward.

1954 – 1964

In 1954, the company decided to reduce the branding to a single “hp” in a circle. Leg “h” is directed up, “p” – down. They extend beyond the borders of the edging by the same distance. The letters and the thin line surrounding them are in black, the background circle in white.

1964 – 1981

This period is very significant for the HP emblem, as it appeared in blue. The hp monogram is now positioned between two narrow multidirectional rectangles that form around white space at the junction. It is in it that the abbreviation is located. The lower part is solid black, the upper part is blue, composed of separate wide stripes. There is complete decoding of the corporation’s name to the right and left of the graphic sign – the names of its founders (the first is Hewlett, the second is Packard). They are in thin capital letters. The logo has a slight slope to the right.

1979 – 2008

The developers took the circle with the lowercase abbreviation into a vertical rectangle to highlight it because they placed the full version of the company name next to it. The letters “hp” have the same design as the previous logo but without vertical elements. They are painted blue, occupy a diagonal position inside a white circle, and are provided with an elongated background in the places where the legs are located. On the right side, there is two-level “Hewlett Packard” lettering in bold and smooth sans-serif glyphs.

1999 – 2012

In 1999, Siegel + Gale design bureau improved the logo, offering a terse version. As a result, the logo became completely blue. It consists of a horizontal rounded rectangle with “hp” in the center on a white background. Its width corresponds to the length of the protruding legs.

2008 – 2014

The emblem of those years became round again. A blue or black circle on the background of which the abbreviation “hp” was executed in white.

2009 – 2014

At first glance, it may seem that this version is identical to the 2008-2014 version, but it is not. There are differences between them. Here are larger signs with increased intra-letter space and a slightly lighter color, literally changed by one tone.

2012 – today

In 2012, the round logo began to be used in a softened palette. But at the end of the period came a turning point in the IT corporation’s work: it was divided into two independent companies. The legal successor was HP Inc., which took over the production of computers and other digital equipment.

Initially, the company reverted to the 1981 emblem, which features a blue rounded rectangle and a “hp” monogram on a white background.

A round version is used in soft colors with white letters on a light blue substrate in parallel.

2016 – today

In 2016, the company finally decided to adopt a new trademark developed for it by Moving Brands studio in 2008-2011. It has four oblique black strokes and is found on premium products.
