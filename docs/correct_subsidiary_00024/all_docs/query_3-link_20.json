        "text": "1. Hewlett-Packard Hewlett-Packard Mission Statement: \"To provide products, services and solutions of the highest quality and deliver more value to our customers that earns their respect and loyalty.\" Hewlett-Packard Vision Statement: \"To view change in the market as an opportunity to grow; to use our profits and our ability to develop and produce innovative products, services and solutions that satisfy emerging customer needs.\" Opportunities  Expanding presence in cloud computing market - Cloud computing describes a new delivery model for IT services. In July 2008, HP along with Intel Corporation and Yahoo! created a global, multi-data center, open source test bed for cloud computing research and education. The goal of the project was to promote collaboration among industry, academy and governments by removing the financial and logistical barriers. In 2009, HP announced HP Cloud Assure, a new SaaS offering designed to assist businesses to safely and effectively adopt cloud-based services. HP Cloud Assure consists of HP services and software, including HP Application Security Center, HP Performance Center and HP Business Availability Center. These solutions are delivered to customers though HP SaaS platform. The increasing demand for cloud computing is likely to create demand for HP’s solutions in coming years. The global spending on cloud computing is forecast to cross a value of over $40 billion by 2012.  Expanding portfolio of imaging and printing solutions - Hewlett Packard has made several strategic acquisitions and introduced new products in the imaging solutions segment in recent times. Its imaging solutions strategy entails the commercial markets, from print services solutions to new growth opportunities in commercial printing and capturing high-value pages in areas such as industrial applications, outdoor signage, and graphic arts. Among those key acquisitions are Tabblo, Logoworks, MacDermid and ColorSpan.  HP has launched several retail photo printing solutions and services that provide consumers the tools to personalize their photos and publish customized creative output. In addition, it has introduced new digital printing technologies, HP Inkjet Web Press, HP Latex Inks and three HP Indigo presses, as part of its graphic arts offerings. In October 2008, it also announced a plan to launch full wireless HP Photosmart printer line-up by 2010.\n\n2. Threats  Projected decreases in the IT markets - Forecasters predict a decrease in the worldwide demand for various IT products offered by HP. The economic slowdown has negatively affected many market segments, including information technology. Hewlett Packard has experienced this decline not only in the U.S. but also in its global markets. Worldwide spending on IT was predicted to decline by 4% in 2009.  Hyper-competitive environment - Although Hewlett Packard recently overtook Dell in sales, the latter remains a formidable competitor, as are other companies such as Toshiba, Lenova Group and Aver. It competes in terms of price, quality, brand, technology, reputation, distribution and range of products, among other factors. In some regions, the company faces competition from local companies and from generically- branded or white box manufacturers.  Specifically, the company’s competitors in enterprise servers and storage include IBM an in storage there is the EMC Corporation, Dell in industry standard servers and Sun Microsystems in UNIX-based servers. The imaging and printing group’s key competitors include Canon USA, Lexmark International, Xerox Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, Samsung Electronics and Dell. HP even faces competition from re- manufacturers including private label brand stores, supply stores such, internet vendors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Lexmark. The re-manufacturers buy the original cartridges from customers, refill them with their own ink and resell them at a discount to the branded OEMS. These entities provide a continuous source of competition which could impact the profitability of HP.\n\n3. KFC Mission Statement, Vision and Strategy KFC’s Mission Statement is: “’The Association of KFC Franchisees, Inc. is united to protect, promote and advance the mutual interests of all member franchisees and the Kentucky Fried Chicken system.” (Association of Kentucky Fried Chicken Franchisees, Inc. 2006).

Our success has only just begun as we look forward to the future, one which promises a long runway for growth, especially on an international level” (Yum!, 2011).

CARIBLA’s mission statement and objectives are “the mission of the CARIBLA Franchisee Association is to represent, promote, and protect the general interests of all member YUM franchisees in Latin America and the Caribbean” (CARIBLA, 2011). Opportunities 1. Online Sales assist profits. 2. Introduction of new products. 3. Expansion due to rising economy (Continual Growth) 4.

KASBIT The Late Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari’s Vision for Pakistan The founding father of the KASB Group envisioned a progressive and prosperous Pakistan based on the power of qualitative education. He always believed that “education, education and only education” was the ingredient that would propel Pakistan to success and to the high citadels where it truly deserves to be. In an evolving and constantly expanding manner, his vision for Pakistan where “education would be available for all” is being carried forward by his son, Arif Ali Shah Bukhari who has set up KASBIT, which presently consists of three campuses in Karachi. In future years these campuses are expected to spread out in all the cities of Pakistan so that KASBIT becomes a name that is synonymous with ‘quality education” the world over. Mission Statement Provide competency based quality education and inculcate the ability to utilize maximum potential to meet challenges of new era. SZABIST The Vision Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology shall be a world class institute recognized globally for its excellence in education, scholarship in research and distinction in service."
