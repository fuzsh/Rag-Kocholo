        "text": "by Susan Twombly, Jan. 2008\n\nIf someone asked you what you had to say about your business, the answer would probably be \"plenty!\"\n\nBut the next question would most likely be \"How?\" How do you say what you need to say about your business in a way that really separates you from the competition?\n\nIt's a question many small businesses are asking today as they attempt to rev up their branding efforts to bring in new business.\n\nIn fact, four out of five small businesses in the United States have attempted to differentiate themselves in the marketplace by creating marketing collateral (such as fliers and brochures), placing print/online ads and/or designing a company logo. However, most say they are unsure on how to stand out. (1)\n\nThat's exactly why HP just launched the \"What do you have to say?\" Small Business Contest, which will award one small business in the U.S. with an opportunity to build their brand and differentiate their business.\n\nWhat's the grand prize?\n\nLogoworks by HP 'Start Up Package' One grand prize winner will have a chance to work with professional designers at Logoworks by HP, a web-based graphic design services firm that HP acquired in 2007. If you win the grand prize, Logoworks by HP will work with you to refresh or create your brand image to help you capture and keep the attention of new prospects and customers.\n\nThe Start Up Package includes:\n\nA Gold logo package of up to eight original logo concepts and an unlimited number of revisions. (Try different fonts and colors combinations for your ideal logo!)\n\nCustomized stationery package\n\nWebsite design: basic, three-page design\n\n500 business cards\n\nAn HP Color LaserJet CP3505dn printer. Ideal for a small business space, this compact printer can help you make a colorful impact to boost the effectiveness of your marketing materials. Additionally, its fast speeds and incredible ease of use can increase productivity.\n\nA comprehensive supplies package, featuring a full set of toner print cartridges and a variety of HP specialty papers to vividly bring your brand to life.\n\nHP Marketing Resource Software, a suite of tools that can help you produce professional-quality marketing material with your own HP Color LaserJet printer.\n\nAre there other prizes?\n\nYes! One second-place finalist will receive a new HP Color LaserJet, which comes with the HP Marketing Resources software. One third-place finalist will also receive an HP Officejet ProL7680 All-in-One. Both prizes come with a robust HP supplies package to bring out the best in your new brand.\n\nWho can enter?\n\nThis contest is open to small businesses with 99 employees or less located in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. No purchase is necessary to win!\n\nHow do you enter?\n\nVisit http://www.hp.com/go/brandcontest to submit your entry. You must include an online essay of up to 400 words, describing your small business, your marketing and branding challenges, and why you would benefit most from refreshing or creating a new brand image for your business. You may also submit up to three digital photos to support your essay. (See link for photo format details.)\n\nWhat's the deadline?\n\nThe deadline for entries is February 28, 2008. The grand prize winner's and finalists' entries will be posted online following the close of the contest. Good luck!"
