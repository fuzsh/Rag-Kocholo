        "text": "John F. Kennedy, often referred to by his initials JFK, was a significant figure in the annals of American history. Born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts, he was the second of nine children from the politically influential Kennedy family. His early education took place in elite institutions, culminating with a Bachelor of Arts in Government from Harvard University in 1940. Kennedy's early life was not only marked by academic pursuits but was also filled with health struggles, including a near-fatal case of Addison's disease. Kennedy's political career began in earnest after World War II. In 1946, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts's 11th Congressional district. After serving three terms, he successfully ran for Senate in 1952. His tenure as a Senator was notable for his advocacy on labor issues and his foreign policy stances, particularly regarding Vietnam. However, it was the 1960 Presidential election that truly thrust Kennedy into the global spotlight. At the age of 43, he became the youngest person ever elected to the presidency and the first Catholic to hold the office. Kennedy's presidency, though brief, was momentous. He navigated the country through some of the most intense moments of the Cold War, including the Cuban Missile Crisis. His administration also saw the initiation of the Peace Corps, the launch of the Apollo space program, and significant strides in civil rights. Tragically, Kennedy's presidency was cut short when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Despite his short time in office, Kennedy's charismatic leadership, compelling speeches, and forward-thinking policies have ensured his enduring legacy in American history.\n\nPenny Sue Pritzker (born May 2, 1959) is an American billionaire businesswoman, entrepreneur, and civic leader. President Barack Obama nominated Pritzker as United States Secretary of Commerce. After being confirmed by a Senate vote of 97â€“1, she became the 38th person to hold that position. Pritzker spent her early career in business. She worked her way up through the Pritzker family business, eventually being appointed as one of three successors to her uncle, Jay Pritzker. She is the founder of PSP Capital Partners and Pritzker Realty Group. She is also co-founder of Artemis Real Estate Partners. As of October 2015, Forbes estimated her net worth at $2.4 billion. In 2009, Forbes named Pritzker one of the 100 most powerful women in the world. Before entering government service, Pritzker had been involved in many Chicago organizations, including the Chicago Board of Education, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and her own foundation, the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation. Pritzker was an early supporter of Obama's presidential candidacy, having been a friend of the Obama family since their time in Chicago. Her brother, J.B. Pritzker, is the Governor of Illinois.\n\nSteven Anthony Ballmer (; born March 24, 1956) is an American businessman and investor who was the chief executive officer of Microsoft from January 13, 2000, to February 4, 2014, and is the current owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As of April 2019, his personal wealth is estimated at US $51.3 billion, ranking him the 19th richest person in the world.Ballmer was hired by Bill Gates at Microsoft in 1980 and subsequently left the MBA program at Stanford University. He eventually became President in 1998, and replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. On February 4, 2014, Ballmer retired as CEO and resigned from the Board of Directors on August 19, 2014 to prepare for teaching a new class.On May 29, 2014, Ballmer placed a bid of $2 billion to purchase the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers after NBA commissioner Adam Silver forced Donald Sterling to sell the team. He became the Clippers owner on August 12, 2014; Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was a fellow owner in the NBA, having owned the Portland Trail Blazers since 1988. His time as Microsoft CEO was mixed, with the company tripling sales and doubling of profits, but losing its market dominance and missing out on 21st-century technology trends."
