Licensing law can be chaotic for both licensors and licensees. To draft a license agreement for software or an information product, a lawyer must be conversant in numerous areas of law, including the common law of contracts, Uniform Commercial Code Article 2, state and federal intellectual property rules and overlays, bankruptcy law, and competition law, not to mention various electronic commerce, data privacy, and digital signature statutes. Article 2B, which draws from all these areas of law, could clarify licensing law and thereby promote commerce in software and information products. Doing so, however, will be difficult.\n\nDespite its promise, both scholars and practicing lawyers have approached the Article 2B project with a degree of wariness, though for decidedly different reasons. Scholars tend to approach Article 2B with suspicion because it appears to \"remake\" n1 the contract law they know from reported cases, n2 existing contract statutes, n3 and scholarly writings. n4 For [*893] practitioners, Article 2B is not new n5 law; it broadly accords with the law that is practiced today in the information and software industries. However, practitioners fear that a group of people unfamiliar with the customs and practices of the industry, or those with political and intellectual axes to grind, will create an ill-fitting contract regime. n6 These practitioners would rather live with the un-codified, chaotic body of law they are working with today than have to cope with codified contract rules that do not make sense.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn1.

Rev. 113, 114 (forthcoming 1999) (\"Proposed Uniform Commercial Code Article 2B will remake the law of software and intellectual property licensing in a radical way.\"). See also Dennis J. Karjala, Federal Preemption of Shrinkwrap And On-Line Licenses, 22 U. Dayton L. Rev. 511 (1997) (arguing Article 2B is unconstitutional); David A. Rice, Digital Information As Property And Product: U.C.C. Article 2B, 22 U. Dayton L. Rev. 621 (1997); J. Thomas Warlick, A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing? Information Licensing and De Facto Copyright Legislation in UCC 2B, J. Copyright Soc'y U.S.A. 158, 172 (1997) (\"2B appears poised to be the impetus for a deluge of oppressive licenses and litigation against hapless licensees.\"). Software and information licensing has been around for a long time (Dunn & Bradstreet has been licensing information for over one hundred years) and needs no further impetus, though licensing law could certainly benefit from more clarity. While Article 2B does not represent new licensing law or practice, it is different than Article2. As explained infra, therein lies much of the promise of Article 2B.\n\nn2. Until ProCD v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996), no reported case had determined the enforceability of a mass market license agreement between a software publisher and an end user. The cases that touched on mass market licenses involved contracts between a software publisher and a distributor. In those cases, the software publisher tried (without success) to use the end user license to amend or alter the distribution agreement between the parties. See Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc. v. Wyse Tech., 939 F.2d 91 (3d Cir. 1991); Arizona Retail Sys., Inc. v. Software Link, Inc., 831 F. Supp. 759 (D. Ariz. 1993). Arizona Retail, however, actually anticipates the court's ruling in ProCD. In Arizona Retail, the distributor, a value-added retailer, initially acquired an evaluation version of the software that was accompanied by an \"evaluation license.\" In this context, the retailer was more like an end user than a distributor of the software. The court held that the retailer was bound by the terms of the evaluation license. See Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. at 766.\n\nn3. But see Jeffery Dodd, Art. 2B Offers Jurisprudence for All Forms, Nat. L.J., Sept. 21, 1998, at B13, B16 (criticizing the \"mechanistic approach\" to contract formation rules that makes \"choreography\" - timing and sequence - all-important); Robert B. Mitchell, Restoring Realism in Software Licensing Law, Multimedia & Tech. Licensing L. Rep., Apr. 1996, at 4, 7 (arguing that courts have departed from the \"legal realist\" roots of the U.C.C. when applying it to software licenses).\n\nn4. The ProCD ruling may have surprised some scholars because they mistakenly believed that the body of critical commentary on mass market licenses was more compelling than the overwhelming industry practice and the economics that drive the industry. See Robert W. Gomulkiewicz & Mary L. Williamson, A Brief Defense of Mass Market Software License Agreements, 22 Rutgers Computer & Tech. L.J. 335 (1996) (describing the importance of mass market licenses for both publishers and users, and citing critical commentary); Wayne D. Bennett, Legal and Blinding, CIO Magazine (Oct. 1, 1998) (visited Nov. 23, 1998) <http://www.cio.com/archive/webbusiness/100198 gray content.html> (criticizing the critics of Article 2B who claim that it represents new legal principles).\n\nn5. The goal of uniform law makers should be, as Grant Gilmore put it, \"to be accurate and not to be original.\" Grant Gilmore, On the Difficulties of Codifying Commercial Law, 57 Yale L.J. 1341 (1948). The drafters of Article 2B have expressed support for this drafting philosophy. See U.C.C. Article 2B, Preface at 9 (Mar. 1998 Draft). Though Article 2B is not new law, it is fair to say it has caused a new focus on software and information licensing.\n\nn6. The Article 2B project did not begin at the behest of the software industry. Indeed, software industry trade associations voiced their disapproval of such a project. Once the project began, however, initially as part of the Article2 re-write and then as a separate U.C.C. article, the software industry as well as other information product industries began to participate in the process. See U.C.C. Article 2B, Prefatory Note at 5-7 (July 24-31, 1998 Draft) (describing the history of the Article2B project); Raymond T. Nimmer et al., License Contracts Under Article2 of the Uniform Commercial Code: A Proposal, 19 Rutgers Computer & Tech. L.J. 281 (1993); Thom Weidlich, Commission Plans New U.C.C. Article, Nat. L.J., Aug. 28, 1995, at B1.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nMany challenges stand in the way of creating a uniform law for software and information licensing. One challenge arises from the nature of the law-making process. Putting together a uniform law through the process sponsored by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (\"NCCUSL\") and the American Law Institute (\"ALI\") is a [*894] slow moving exercise in consensus building. n7 To further complicate matters, the drafting committee used as its starting point Uniform Commercial Code Article 2, a hard goods-centric, sales-oriented set of rules. Though some observers believe a license for software in packaged-goods-form resembles a sale of goods, these transactions differ in many ways from a sale of goods and represent only a fraction of licenses for software and information products. n8\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn7. See generally Marianne B. Culhane, The UCC Revision Process: Legislation You Should See in the Making, 26 Creighton L. Rev. 29 (1992).\n\nn8. Software licensing is often divided into two general categories: upstream licensing and downstream licensing. Upstream licensing refers to licenses a publisher receives to create its product. Downstream licensing refers to licenses a publisher gives to users or distributors of its product. An example of an upstream license would be a license for spell checking software that a publisher receives to include the spell checking software in the publisher's word processing product. An example of downstream licensing would be an end user license or a license with a computer manufacturer to install and distribute system software on its computers. Article 2B applies to both types of licenses.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nArticle 2B also faces an additional challenge: digital convergence. While the initial focus of Article 2B was software, the Article 2B drafting committee soon realized that the software, data, fixed media publishing, on-line publishing, motion picture, television, and music industries and their products are converging. These industries are in the midst of convergence, not at the end of it. This means that Article 2B must meld the licensing practices of the different industries, account for their differences, or attempt to deny that convergence is occurring by focusing the statute upon a subset of these industries. Article 2B's attempt to meld and account for various licensing traditions can be viewed either as an important strength or a fatal flaw, n9 or, in software parlance, as either a \"feature\" or a \"bug.\"\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn9. See Brenda Sandburg, Commercial Code Upgrade May Fall Apart, The Recorder, Sept. 28, 1998, at 1 (describing the qualms of the entertainment and communications industries about a contract statute with one set of rules for all transactions in information).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThis Article provides a perspective on how the authors of Article 2B have fared in their attempt to create a useful contract code for the licensing of software and information products. To do so, it first discusses mass market licensing, which has been a focal point of Article 2B. It concludes that codification of industry standard mass market licensing practices is the proper approach for Article 2B and that any other approach would fundamentally disrupt the software and information industries. It points out that licensors as varied as the Free Software Foundation (with its [*895] \"copyleft\" license), n10 Consumers Union, n11 and the University of California at Berkeley n12 employ mass market licenses. The Article also points out that Article 2B's affirmation of mass market licenses has come at a cost for publishers: namely, the codification of new end user rights.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn10. The Free Software Foundation does not make its software \"free\" by placing it in the public domain. Rather, it does so via mass market licensing. See Free Software Foundation, What is Copyleft? (visited Nov. 5, 1998) <http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/copyleft.html>. According to the Debian organization, publisher of the Debian GNU/Linux \"free software\" operating system, \"truly free software is always free. Software that is placed in the public domain can be snapped up and put into non-free programs, and be free no more. To stay free, software must be copyrighted and licensed.\" Debian GNU/Linux, What Does Free Mean? or What Do You Mean By Open Software?

The Article observes that, while the Article 2B drafting committee has made progress toward reshaping Article 2 default rules, in several fundamental ways Article 2B remains too wedded to Article 2 and thus threatens to remake licensing law by forcing hard goods-centric sales rules on software and information licensing. It also observes that Article 2B may need additional changes to accommodate varied licensing practices among the converging information industries.\n\nII. ARTICLE 2B AND MASS MARKET LICENSES\n\nMass market licensing is not new. n13 Software companies have been using mass market licenses, and legal commentators have been writing [*896] about them, for decades. n14 The software industry is thriving in large part because of what mass market licenses enable: a diversity of innovative products provided to end users at attractive prices. n15 For most software products, the license is the product; the computer program provides functionality to the user, but the license delivers the use rights. n16\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn13. Relatively new, however, are court decisions clearly articulating the value of mass market licensing. See Hill v. Gateway 2000, 105 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir. 1997), cert. denied 118 S.Ct. 47 (1997) (upholding contract terms presented to the user post-payment in a mixed software and computer hardware transaction); ProCD v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996); Hotmail v. Van$ Money Pie, Inc., 47 U.S.P.Q.2d 1020 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (assuming enforceability of mass market license); Arizona Retail Sys. v. Software Link, 831 F. Supp.759, 766 (D. Ariz. 1993) (holding a mass market license enforceable in the initial transaction between a value added reseller and a software publisher, but unenforceable in a subsequent transaction); Brower v. Gateway 2000, 676 N.Y.S.2d 569 (1998) (upholding contract terms presented to the user post-payment in a mixed software and computer hardware transaction).\n\nn14. Standard form contracts are not an innovation of software publishers. The use of standard form contracts is commonplace in virtually all lines of business. See 3 Lawrence A. Cunningham & Arthur J. Jacobson, Corbin on Contracts 559A(B) (rev. ed. Supp. 1998); 1 E. A. Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts 4.26 (1990). Software publishers have been innovative, however, in the various ways they allow users to manifest assent to the terms. See Gomulkiewicz & Williamson, supra note4, at 339-41. Software publishers have also been unique in their efforts to actually draw contract terms to the user's attention and require manifestation of assent. Id. at 352.\n\nn15. See id.\n\nn16. See ProCD, 86 F.3d at 1453 (\"In the end, the terms of the license are conceptually identical to the contents of the package.\"). The use of mass market licenses enables the publisher to tailor a collection of rights to particular types of uses, so that the license, rather than merely the underlying software, becomes the product acquired by the user. This practice has analogies to other industries, such as the airline industry. An airline ticket is nothing more than a right to ride on a given flight, in a certain class of seat, on a certain day and time, to a certain location. The ticket price and associated rights vary from passenger to passenger, depending on the ticket the passenger acquired. For example, one passenger in coach may have paid twice as much as the passenger sitting across the aisle, but the higher priced ticket may entitle the passenger to a confirmed seat on another flight in case the airline cancels the regularly scheduled flight.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe court's ruling in ProCD v. Zeidenberg n17 affirming the enforceability of mass market licenses may have surprised some legal scholars, but a contrary ruling would have devastated the software and electronic information industries. It is far better that the ProCD case merely provoked a few critical law review articles n18 than forced a radical change in\n\n[*897] the way software and information publishers do business. Without an effective contracting method to license software and electronic information to the mass market, the value and choice of products would have diminished significantly, and some companies would have had no viable products at all. n19 Today, a wide variety of organizations employ standard form contracts to provide software and information to the mass market, n20 including Consumers Union, n21 Consumer Net, n22 University of California at Berkeley, n23 Dartmouth College, n24 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, n25 Texas Classroom Teachers Association, n26 Public Broadcast Service, n27 Free Software Foundation, n28 The Robert Woods Johnson Foundation, n29 The Partnership For Food Safety Education, n30 National Pediatric And Family [*898] HIV Resource Center, n31 National Institutes of Health Library, n32 National Kidney Foundation, n33 Guggenheim Museum, n34 Wisconsin Bar Association, n35 First Baptist Church (Rochester, MN), n36 and Catholic Online Webmail. n37\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn17. 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\nn18. See, e.g., Karjala, supra note 1; Apik Minassian, The Death of Copyright: Enforceability of Shrinkwrap Licensing Agreements, 45 UCLA L. Rev. 567 (1997); Kell Corrigan Mercer, Note, Consumer Shrink-Wrap Licenses and Public Domain Materials; Copyright Preemption and Uniform Commercial Code Validity in ProCD v. Zeidenberg, 30 Creighton L. Rev. 1287 (1997). Some commentators disparage the ProCD decision by saying that it has been severely criticized or that most commentators disagree with the court's opinion. See, e.g., David A. Rice, Memorandum to Article 2B Drafting Committee (Mar. 18, 1998) (on file with author) (Professor Rice is a member of the Article 2B Drafting Committee). This count-up-the-law-review-article method of evaluating ProCD is a poor basis to judge the merits of the decision. Most commentators write to critique cases, not to praise them, so seeing more criticism than accolades is normal in legal scholarship. Even at that, one might quarrel with whether particular articles are, on balance, supportive or critical. See Maureen A. O'Rourke, Copyright Preemption After the ProCD Case, a Market-Based Approach, 12 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 53 (1997) (agreeing with the court on contract grounds, while offering criticism on preemption grounds). Another mode of criticizing ProCD is to call it, pejoratively one would suppose, an Easterbrook decision, implying that the court's opinion was the work of one rogue judge. Both ProCD and the Gateway case that followed, were unanimous opinions of the court, neither of which the 7th Circuit reconsidered en banc. See Hill v. Gateway 2000, 105 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\nn19. See Joel Rothstein Wolfson, Contracts and Copyright are not at War: A Reply to \"The Metamorphosis of Contract into Expand,\" 87 Calif. L. Rev. 79 (forthcoming 1999).\n\nn20. In Article 2B nomenclature, many of these contracts would be called \"Access Contracts\" rather than \"Mass Market Licenses,\" although they are every bit mass market licenses in the normal sense of the term. Article 2B distinguishes between the two types of contracts so that the statute can apply context-specific rules to access contracts. Compare U.C.C. 2B-102(1) (July 24-31, 1998 Draft), with U.C.C. 2B-102(31) (July 24-31, 1998 Draft) and see U.C.C. 2B-102, Reporter's Note 28 (July 24-31, 1998 Draft).\n\nn21.

First, licensors have a strong incentive to draw the user's attention to license terms and to get a manifestation of assent. If the user is not aware of the contours of the license or does not feel bound by them, the licensor (who must rely largely on self-policing in the mass market) cannot count on the user to abide by the license. Second, software users are not a docile lot. They are particularly unforgiving of companies that try to license software on unreasonable terms, and the Internet has given them a powerful tool to express their views. n40 Software end users have formed associa [*899] tions to monitor and influence software license terms. n41 Information industry research organizations, such as the Gartner Group, n42 as well as the trade press, n43 keep a watchful eye on licensing practices, sounding the alarm when they see a change that they believe negatively affects end users.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn38.

Nothing could be farther from the truth. Today's mass market licensing is characterized by contract variety and a variety of license terms. n44 It is common for mass market licenses to provide users with more rights than the user would have acquired had the user simply bought a copy of the software, including reproduction, derivative works, and distribution rights. As new products have been developed and brought to market, such as multimedia software, client-server products, and web site \"products,\" contract variety and customer choice have also flourished via mass market licensing. n45\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn44.

It is no more appropriate to judge mass market licenses by their worst clauses than it is to judge all of litera [*901] ture by tabloid journalism or trashy novels. Just as free speech does not deserve to be regulated because some speech is objectionable, so mass market licenses do not deserve to be regulated because some publishers use them as a vehicle for objectionable terms. Mass market licenses should be judged on the basis of the tremendous benefits they provide to software publishers and users, n52 not on the few provisions critics can find to ridicule.

That is, of course, true - indeed, it is the very essence of licensing.

See infra Appendix of Selected License Terms; Gomulkiewicz & Williamson, supra note 4, at 352-56, 361-65. Another objection seems to be to license terms that prohibit reverse engineering or de-compiling software. While some may have philosophical objections to these terms, they have been standard industry practice for many years among companies of all sizes. Article 2B is not the proper place to resolve this debate - Article 2B should not dictate the enforceability of any given contract term, except an unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable one. In some cases, courts have upheld prohibitions on reverse engineering as reasonable, and in others, such as when the user's goal is merely to achieve interoperability, courts have refused to uphold them on various grounds. See, e.g., ProCD v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447, 1454-55 (7th Cir. 1996) (enforcing prohibition on reverse engineering); DSC Communications v. DGI Techs., 81 F.3d 597 (5th Cir. 1996) (copyright misuse); Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software, 847 F.2d 255 (9th Cir. 1988) (preemption). In reality, reverse engineering is seldom critical to the innovation necessary to advance the state of the art for personal computer software. See Gomulkiewicz & Williamson, supra note 4, at 359 n.97. The feature set and other characteristics of a software product are readily ascertainable in the normal use of the product or via publicly available information. The information one can glean from de-compiling is of limited use in any event. See Andrew Johnson-Laird, Software Reverse Engineering in the Real World, 19 U. Dayton L. Rev. 843, 902 n.4 (1994); Pamela Samuelson et al., Symposium: A Manifesto Concerning the Legal Protection of Computer Programs, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 2308, 2336 n.90 (1994).\n\nn61.

Four alternatives exist: (1)provide that contracts are enforceable only if negotiated and/or signed; (2)force publishers to base their transactions solely on background rules of intellectual property law, such as the first sale doctrine, rather than contract; (3)dictate the specific terms that may or may not be included in standard form contracts; and (4) give courts greater leeway to strike contract terms. These four alternatives are not practicable.\n\nThe transaction costs associated with requiring negotiation or a signature would be prohibitively high. n62 For this reason, standard term contracts [*903] are the norm in today's economy, not the exception, n63 and contract law does not generally require a signature to create a contract. Contracting parties have always had the flexibility to manifest assent in a variety of ways, from nodding their head, to shaking hands, to making an \"X,\" to clicking an \"I agree\" button. n64\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn62.

A copyright first sale is, in effect, a one-size-fits-all transaction model. As I have described in detail elsewhere, forcing a software publisher to sell software like a newspaper or book does not permit the publisher to provide various packages of rights desired by end users at attractive price points. n65 If Article 2B constrains mass market software licensing, product prices will increase and product variety and choice will decrease.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn65.

Hence, these approaches should be pursued very cautiously. While there is a rightful place for some limits on freedom of contract, the better approach is to start by affirming the value of mass market licensing and then apply any regulation with care and precision.

MOLDING AND SHAPING ARTICLE 2 RULES IN ARTICLE 2B\n\nThough Article 2B's treatment of mass market licenses has been a focal point of the drafting process, Article 2B primarily addresses other aspects of licensing. Fundamentally, Article 2B should provide sensible, industry standard default rules for day to day licensing transactions. In creating the Article 2B default rules, the drafters of Article 2B began with the default rules of Article 2. The utility of Article 2B will depend in large [*905] part upon how the drafters of Article 2B mold and shape the hard goods-centric rules of Article 2 to fit software and information contracting, and the default rules they add to resolve issues specific to license agreements. To provide a perspective on how Article 2B rates in this regard, I will briefly examine Article 2B's treatment of warranties, duration of contracts, and interpretation of exclusive license grants.\n\nA. Warranties\n\nA major failing of Article 2B to date is that the drafting committee has remained too wedded to ill-fitting rules found in Article 2. In other words, Article 2B actually threatens to remake software and information licensing law by imposing contract rules on it that are better suited to sales of goods. A good example of this is Article 2B's treatment of warranties. n74\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn74. See id.

Unlike licenses typically used in the software industry, Article 2B places the risk of infringement completely on the licensor. Some argue this is fair because the licensor is in the best position to know of and prevent infringement. n77 Anyone who has negotiated a software license has undoubtedly heard this argument.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn77. This may be the case with respect to copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation, but it is less true or simply not true with respect to patent infringement.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn practice, of course, this argument seldom carries the day - it is very common in negotiated transactions to allocate infringement risk between licensor and licensee, or for the licensee to assume all risk of infringement. The sheer number of issued patents, the difficulty of conducting patent searches, and the fact that any given patent can be interpreted dozens of ways, makes placing the risk on the licensor inequitable in many cases. Often the licensor cannot obtain insurance or will not receive enough income from the license to offset the risk of providing a non-infringement warranty (in many transactions, the licensee will receive much more income through use of the software than the licensor who supplied it). The smaller the software developer or publisher, the more likely the developer or publisher is to resist shouldering the risk of a full blown non-infringement warranty. Thus, in the case of the non-infringement warranty, the drafters of Article 2B have created a default rule that runs contrary to industry practice and to the expectations of the very parties (small developers and publishers) most likely to be subject to the default rule.\n\nThe warranty of non-infringement is also an area in which Article 2B may need to distinguish between the licensing traditions of the software industry and other information industries. Observers from the book publishing industry have informed the drafting committee on several occasions that a full-blown warranty of non-infringement is standard practice in their industry. n78 If that is so, then melding licensing traditions may be the wrong approach. The drafting committee should consider an approach that incorporates different default rules for different industries or creates a mechanism n79 that achieves the same result.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn78. Paul J. Sleven of St. Martin's Press has made this observation at several drafting committee meetings in response to this author's observations about software industry trade practices concerning the warranty of non-infringement. In the book publishing industry, patents are seldom at issue.\n\nn79. Default rules can be varied by usage of trade, but the burdens involved with proving usage of trade in order to overcome a black letter law default rule give pause to the industry whose industry practice is not reflected in the black letter law. See U.C.C. 1-201(3), 1-205 (West 1989).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[*907]\n\nB. Duration of Contracts\n\nIn contrast to Article 2B's default rules for warranties, the Article 2B default rule for duration of contracts is a good example of the drafting committee's attempt to recognize the need to craft a different rule for software and information licensing than for traditional sales of goods. n80 However, as described below, the default rule chosen by the Article 2B drafting committee ignores important nuances and, in the end, causes more harm than good.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn80.

This rule works well for services contracts in the information industries, such as a contract to provide support services or develop software code.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn81. See U.C.C. 2-309 (West 1989).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nA weakness of the Article2 default rule in the software and information license agreement context, however, is the implication that certain grants of rights are terminable at will. For most off-the-shelf, mass market software products, the user expects a perpetual license subject only to cancellation for breach. The same expectation is true for licensed informational content that the licensee integrates or combines with other information to create a single product: the licensee does not expect to have to rip the combined product apart at the behest of the licensor. The default rule in section 2B-308 captures and melds these industry practices which are consistent across information industries. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, in its present form, section 2B-308 does not work well for software source code n82 licensing. Source code often contains highly valuable trade secret information. It is common for software publishers to license proprietary source code to other software companies (including competitors, on occasion), computer hardware manufacturers, customers, and other third parties. These source code licenses are seldom for a perpetual term. Under the present formulation of section 2B-308, if the software publisher neglects to specify a contract duration, the default rule results in a perpetual license grant. n83 This \"bug\" in section 2B-308 is no [*908] small matter: it exposes unsophisticated licensors to inadvertent licenses of valuable technology in perpetuity.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn82.

Interpretation of Exclusive License Grants\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Article 2B is its ability to provide contract certainty by resolving license interpretation issues that are ambiguous in current licensing law practice. One basic meddlesome issue is whether an exclusive license grant means the grant is exclusive as to everyone including the licensor or simply everyone but the licensor. n84 The careful licensing lawyer would take care of this in crafting the language of the license grant, n85 but Article 2B, like Article 2, assumes a lawyer-free transaction. Article 2B resolves the current ambiguous state of the law by taking the position that an exclusive license grant means exclusive as to everyone, including the licensor. n86 Thus, the Article 2B default rule for interpreting exclusive license grants shows how Article 2B can make a positive contribution to bringing order to the current disarray in licensing law.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn84.

CONCLUSION\n\nThe software and information industries are thriving and fueling significant economic growth, despite the chaotic state of contract law for licensing transactions. A uniform contract law for software and information licensing could provide significant benefits to providers and users of information products. To be truly beneficial, however, the law must affirm the basic principle of freedom of contract, increase contract certainty, be attuned to the unique practices of the affected industries and the coming digital convergence, and allow for innovative products and methods of distribution. A regulatory statute, a statute based on antiquated rules and distribution methods, or a statute which provides even less contract certainty than today's world of licensing law chaos, is probably best left unwritten.\n\n[*909]\n\nV.

If code licensed under the GPL is incorporated into software, then such software must also be licensed under the terms of the GPL.
