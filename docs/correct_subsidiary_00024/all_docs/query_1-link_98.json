In today’s challenging economic times, this cost advantage makes email marketing arguably the most powerful tool for building any business. But the main advantage of email marketing is not cost. Email is simply the most effective way to stay in touch with most of your customers. If you’re like many businesses, the 2009 recession forced you to hunker down and focus on driving business and sales from those most likely to buy—people you already have a relationship with—and that’s what email marketing is all about. Email marketing is powerful, but it’s also a challenge because the inbox is a hostile environment. Whether your email is noteworthy or not-worthy depends on your ability to stick to the fundamentals of authentic relationship building with your customers. That’s what this book is about—how to use email to build long-lasting customer relationships. Over the years, we at Constant Contact have made it our mission to collect, create, reﬁne, and share email marketing best practices with our customers. We’re proud to now share these with you in this book—strategies that have contributed to the success of hundreds of thousands of businesses around the globe. On a daily basis we interact with thousands of business owners and non-proﬁts just like you on the phone, online via webinars, and in person at live seminars held throughout the United States. These interactions provide us with\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nregular feedback and fascinating lessons on the rapidly evolving world of email marketing. Here are some examples of small businesses and non-proﬁts who have discovered a broad range of beneﬁts of email marketing: “We track all of our participants and have found that more than 53% of them found out about us through the Internet or our email newsletter. Email marketing is only a fraction of the cost of print ads and it brings in a phenomenal ROI.” —Girls Learn to Ride “I can’t believe the number of people who walk into our restaurants and redeem coupons. Before I tried email marketing, I would put a coupon in the local newspaper—but fewer than 10 people would redeem it. I then put the same coupon in an email and sent it to 400 people. I saw 100 email coupons redeemed that month!” —Fajita Grill “For our 35th anniversary, we sent a ‘save the date’ email to 3,000 people. At 42 cents a stamp, that would be over $1,000 worth of postage we’ve saved from just one mailing.” —Women Employed “Most of all, email marketing has helped us stay connected, build community, and inspire people.” —Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta “Our revenue from return customers has increased about 30% since we began sending out our ‘New Arrivals’ email campaign. We’ve found that a number of customers who have never purchased from us before will buy after we send out an email campaign.” —Bijoux Mart International I know the email strategies in this book work because I have personally taught them to thousands of small business owners and watched the results. Constant Contact’s success is directly attributable to the fact that we have helped so many of them grow their organizations. In addition, I used these same email strategies to help build Constant Contact from an unknown technology startup into an industry-leading public company. When I arrived in 2001, we had\n\nThe 40 “Know It or Blow It” Rules of Email Marketing\n\n3\n\n10 customers and roughly $100 a month in revenue. Now, we are the largest provider of email marketing services for small- to mediumsized businesses, with 300,000 customers in 120 countries and 500+ employees. I hope you’ll ﬁnd a path to greater business success in the pages that follow. Since this book is for busy leaders who don’t have a lot of time, I’ve decided to use Chapter 1 to summarize all the email marketing success fundamentals contained in this book, so you can quickly decide which of your own email practices need immediate attention. The rest of the book will help you build a comprehensive email marketing strategy for your business.\n\nTen Keys to Your Overall Email Marketing Success If you learn nothing else from this book, I recommend you master the following ten principles. Most of the statistics that suggest high returns on email marketing investment depend on how closely you adhere to these basics. 1. Only send email to people who know you. People open email from people they know, and they delete email from people they don’t recognize or mark it as spam. It doesn’t even matter what’s legal or ethical. If your business makes a habit of emailing total strangers, then your reputation, your budget, and your growth will suffer for it. You can read about building a good email list in Chapter 5. 2. Don’t treat email addresses like email addresses; treat them like relationships. An email address is one of the most personal things someone can share with your business because it’s an invitation to send your messages to a place where he or she sends and receives personal communications as well as business ones. Email doesn’t work if it feels like a computer-generated HTML document. It has to come across as being part of a meaningful relationship. You can read about building relationships in Chapter 2. 3. Send relevant content that has value to your recipient. You probably weren’t going to send irrelevant, valueless content on purpose, but content with good intentions isn’t the same thing as value and relevance. In order to ensure that your emails are valuable and relevant, you have to know exactly what your audience wants. You have to be a good listener to be a good\n\n4\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing communicator. You can ﬁnd more about creating relevance and value in your content in Chapter 7. 4. Engage your audience in the content you write. This requires attention-grabbing subject lines, clear headlines, and thoughtful content. You can read about what makes email content engaging in Chapter 7. 5. Maximize your delivery rate. Getting email delivered is harder than you might think. Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) such as Yahoo!, AOL, and Hotmail work diligently to block emails from unwanted senders. If your email isn’t up to professional standards in reputation, technology, or permission, you might as well be sending your email directly to the junk folder. You can read about maximizing delivery in Chapter 11. 6. Don’t share email lists with anyone. Your email list is a valuable asset. It will lose value if you loan it to someone else because the people on your list won’t recognize a foreign sender. You should never borrow an email list from someone else. That list is full of people who aren’t familiar with your business, and you\n\nFigure 1.1 Avoiding the junk folder is one of the keys to successful email marketing.\n\nThe 40 “Know It or Blow It” Rules of Email Marketing\n\n5\n\nare likely to attract more enemies than friends. You can read about protecting your email list in Chapter 6. 7. Set expectations with your recipients. When someone signs up to receive your email communications, they do so with the expectation of receiving something of value. If you don’t communicate clearly what that value is, your audience will draw their own conclusions. Tell your audience what you’ll be sending and how often you’ll be sending it. That way, you’ll defeat any value, relevance, and frequency objections before your audience even signs up. You can read more about setting expectations in Chapter 4. 8. Look professional whenever you communicate. If you’re a salesperson, you know how to dress for success. Similarly, if you’re an email, you need to look familiar, inviting, and consistent. You can read more about creating an email with a friendly professional identity in Chapter 9. 9. Be ready to respond. Email communications can be highly automated, in an off-putting way that distances you from your customers. Don’t set an email auto reply in your in-box and take a mental vacation. Keep an eye on your communications and your responses so you can take action, make changes, and repeat positive results. You can read more about responding to your emails in Chapter 12. 10. Regularly review your campaign results. The longer you practice marketing the more you realize how unpredictable your results will be if you don’t analyze your past and make adjustments based on your data. Use email tracking reports to help you improve, progress, and grow. You can read about email tracking reports in Chapter 12.\n\nTen Things Your Customers Expect You to Do Most marketing failures happen because the business worries more about what to expect from its customers than what its customers expect from the company. The problem is, it’s not easy to know exactly what your customers expect. You have to ask them constantly, and you have to believe them, which is even harder than asking. Here’s what\n\n6\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nFigure 1.2 Professional looking emails reinforce your brand and identity. Constant Contact has learned about meeting customer expectations when it comes to email marketing. Your customers expect you to: 1. Protect them. Storing data in a secure environment is critical, but that’s not all there is to privacy. You need a privacy policy, and you need to be sensitive to the amount of intrusion you cause your customers. You can read more about privacy in Chapter 4. 2. Know them. Your customers don’t lack information, they lack personalized relevant information. You don’t need to know every detail about your customers, but you have to make them\n\nThe 40 “Know It or Blow It” Rules of Email Marketing\n\n7\n\nFigure 1.3 Give your subscribers a link to your privacy policy. feel like you know them so you can target your communications to their interests. You can ﬁnd out how to determine what your customers want you to know about them in Chapter 5. 3. Help them. Email is noise when it doesn’t solve a problem or leave the recipient better off than she was before reading the email. To be successful at email marketing, your emails have to help save time, money, and angst. You can read more about helpful email content in Chapter 7. 4. Promise them. Your business makes promises, regardless of whether you intend to. When you send out a message that describes your products or services, someone has to believe it in order to buy it. When someone believes you, it’s a promise you need to keep if you want to keep that customer. When someone subscribes to your email list, you have also made a promise to send only what the subscriber believes he will receive. You can read more about making promises and sending only what you promised in Chapter 4.\n\n8\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing 5. Respond to them. Email is a two-way form of communication. Your audience wants you to respond when they interact with your emails. They can reply, click, block, unsubscribe, and forward your emails, and every form of response deserves an appropriate follow up from you. You can read more about responding to email interaction in Chapter 12. 6. Teach them. People make more educated decisions than they used to because there is so much information available. Consumers want to justify their purchase decisions with good information, and emails are perfect for delivering quality information in a concise format. You can read about creating good email content that makes your audience smarter in Chapter 7. 7. Grab them. Email inboxes are crowded with messages because of spam and because people subscribe to a lot of email lists. Most people don’t have time to read all the emails they receive, and they want someone to help them prioritize the information in their inbox. Your emails have to grab attention and deliver your message clearly. You can read more about grabbing your audience’s attention in Chapter 7.\n\nFigure 1.4 Ask your email subscribers to share their interests.\n\nThe 40 “Know It or Blow It” Rules of Email Marketing\n\n9\n\n8. Ask them. It’s just as classy to ask for your customer’s permission to start periodic emailing as it is to ask your girlfriend’s parents to start dating. It’s old-fashioned, effective, and will probably make you look better than your competition. You can read more about asking for permission in Chapter 4. 9. Give them options. Your audience isn’t likely to simply respond to an offer to “Join Our Email Blast.” You need to give people choices so they can choose the information they want to receive and make changes when their interests shift. You can read more about providing list options in Chapter 5. 10. Free them. It’s easy to think that your email list is too valuable to let anyone easily remove herself. Think again. You need to make it easy for someone to unsubscribe or move from one email list to another. Put an unsubscribe link in every email and let your audience remove themselves from your list permanently with one click. You can read more about allowing and minimizing unsubscribe requests in Chapter 4.\n\nTen Ways to Get Your Business in Trouble with Email How could something so easy, so cost-effective, and so powerful get you in trouble? It usually happens the moment you think that easy, cost-effective, and powerful tools can’t possibly be abused. 1. Get spam complaints. Spam is in the eye of the receiver. If your audience thinks your email is spam, all they have to do in most cases is click one button in their email program, and your email address is ﬂagged as possible spam forever. Spam complaints destroy your deliverability and reputation. To avoid spam complaints, you have to avoid looking like spam. You can read more about spam complaints in Chapter 4. 2. Use deceptive ways to collect contact information. You can ﬁnd email addresses everywhere you look, but not everything shiny is gold. Collecting email addresses from web sites, directories, and web-crawling computer programs will give your email list more spam complaints than sales. You can read more about proper email address collection in Chapter 4.\n\n10\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\n3. Violate the CAN-SPAM Act. Consumers hate spam, so Congress decided to take action on spammers by creating the CAN-SPAM Act. You can be ﬁned if you violate the CAN-SPAM Act, but the laws also shed light on the email marketing practices that consumers dislike the most. You can read about the CAN-SPAM Act in Chapter 4. 4. Send too much email. Your business has to survive, and regular communications are the key to staying top of mind with customers. Sending the right amount of content at the proper frequency is a balance that will reward you if you practice keeping your ﬁnger off the “send” button when your customers aren’t ready to hear from you. You can read more about overcommunication in Chapter 12. 5. Buy an email list. Email list purchases or rentals fail not because of the quality of the list, but rather because consumers dislike receiving unfamiliar emails. You can read more about email list building in Chapter 5. 6. Share your email list unintentionally. Sharing your email doesn’t necessarily have to involve handing a disk to a friend or colleague. When you send an email with hundreds of email addresses copied into the cc ﬁeld, you are sharing your entire list with everyone you’re sending to. You can read more about the proper ways to send email in Chapter 4. 7. Share your business with a spammer. If you send email from an email server that also hosts other businesses, that server is only as good as the reputation of the other people who send email from that server. If your shared hosting partners are spamming people, your emails can be ﬂagged as spam by email programs. Using an email service with a good reputation is critical to your deliverability. Read more about sender reputation in Chapter 4. 8. Go it alone. Effective email marketing is nearly impossible without partners to help you with formatting, delivery, and strategy. Just like a good CEO surrounds herself with key people to grow a business, a good email marketer is surrounded by partners who are invested in the success of the business. You can read more about key partners in Chapter 11.\n\nThe 40 “Know It or Blow It” Rules of Email Marketing\n\n11\n\n9. Hide your identity. Even if your audience knows you, they still have to recognize you. Your email’s “from” line has to be familiar, your brand has to be prominent, and your email address has to look friendly to the companies that decide which emails to deliver and which to send to the junk folder. You can read more about creating familiar emails in Chapter 9. 10. Fail to plan. If you’re going to invest time, energy, effort, and money in an email marketing program, take the time to plan the steps necessary to be successful. You can read more about planning for success in Chapters 2 and 3.\n\nTen Reasons to Use an Email Marketing Service Provider Many small businesses use Microsoft Outlook or a similar email program when they start doing email marketing. The problem is that these applications were designed for one-to-one communications. They can work ﬁne for sending email to a few dozen people. But using Outlook to help you send hundreds or thousands of emails to your customers is like using a speaker phone to deliver a speech in an auditorium. Email marketing can have a powerful impact on your business, and you need tools that are designed for the task. If you are serious enough about email marketing to pick up this book, you should consider using an email service like Constant Contact. (We’re the largest by far, and the best [we believe!], but there are other ones out there.) Email services help you perfect your strategy, manage your data, design your emails, and track your results. 1. Look professional. Unless you’re an HTML programmer who knows how every email program used by your customers will render your code differently, you should consider using an Email Service Provider (ESP) to help you with elements such as colors, fonts, images, and page designs. 2. Easily conform to CAN-SPAM regulations. All reputable email service providers build legal requirements into their platforms so you don’t have to worry about compliance. 3. Learn best practices. Email service companies send a lot of emails. The best ones listen to their customers, study their customers’ results, and share the best practices with others so\n\n12\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing everyone can grow. Go with an email service that embraces the philosophy that when customers are successful, the company is successful.\n\n4. Give customers and easy way to unsubscribe. Keeping track of the people who no longer want your emails is not only professional, it’s a legal requirement. Email services include easy and safe unsubscribe links in every email that automatically remove anyone who clicks on them and keeps track of your unsubscribed customers so you can’t inadvertently add them back. 5. List management. Sending email to a list professionally isn’t as simple as cutting and pasting email addresses into a program. Email services allow you to manage your customers’ personal information and preferences so your emails are customized and your subscribers are segmented into categories and interests. 6. Track results. If you want to see who’s opening, forwarding, and clicking on your emails, you need an email service that gives you tracking reports. Email services can also tell you which\n\nFigure 1.5 Email services share the best practices with their customers.\n\nThe 40 “Know It or Blow It” Rules of Email Marketing\n\n13\n\nemails bounced, why they bounced, and which subscribers opted out of your communications. 7. Maximize delivery to the inbox. Your customers’ Internet Service Providers want to deliver wanted email while blocking unwanted email, so they pay close attention to the reputation of the sender when they decide whether to deliver or block emails to their customers. If you use an email service that is friendly to ISPs and blocks uninvited spammers from using their services, you’ll have a higher delivery rate. If you use your own email server to deliver your mail, you’ll start with no reputation at all, and you’ll probably experience average delivery rates. 8. Automate where appropriate. Email services are constantly developing new tools that help you to automate your strategy so you can spend more time with your customers. Automated features include signup forms that feed customer information into your database, auto responders that send selected emails after a speciﬁed event, and email templates that automatically lay out your content and brand elements into eye catching arrangements. 9. Cost a fraction of a penny per communication. Perhaps the best email marketing beneﬁt involves the low cost of sending lots of emails to lots of people. Good email services pass these low costs on to their customers in the form of ﬁxed monthly fees for unlimited emails or price breaks for large list holders. 10. Provide tools that impact your profits. Where do you turn when you need a library of stock photography, a way to archive your emails to your web site, or online surveys to help you understand your customers better? Any good Email Service Provider will offer these tools and will be constantly ﬁnding ways to make your emails come to life and give you the greatest return on your investment in their products and services. At this point your mind is either spinning with ideas on how to put these rules into practice for your business or you are wondering how to get started. The great news is that in both cases the answers lie in reading on! You may think that sending an email marketing campaign is fairly simple and you would be right. However, email marketing is not about sending email, it’s about getting people to read it! So let’s get started.\n\n2\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\nHave you ever entered a store by opening a door and heard a bell ring? That bell tells store owners that it’s time to drop what they’re doing and focus on you, the customer. If the store owner recognizes that the bell represents an opportunity to begin building a relationship, he can begin the process of turning a stranger walking through a door into a familiar customer who makes repeat purchases, refers friends, and stays loyal for a long time. If the store owner ignores the bell or fails to make a connection with the person entering the store, the results are likely to be poor. The potential customer is going to remain a stranger who must be convinced again—at great expense—to walk through the same door at a later date. In email marketing, the bell rings when someone is added to your list. Understanding how to talk to a customer from that point forward using email communications will enable you to tap into the power of relationships and build your business.\n\nBuilding Customer Relationships with the Constant Contact Cycle Every once in a while, someone visits your web site or walks through your door and instantly falls in love with your products or services. Unfortunately, a lot of small business owners I talk to are trying to\n\n14\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\n15\n\nFigure 2.1 The Constant Contact Cycle survive solely on the small numbers of these “love at ﬁrst sight” customers. They don’t understand how to attract customers from the largest pool of prospective customers—namely the aware but not yet convinced, the skeptics, the comparison shoppers, the indecisive, and the forgetful. Building a business requires you to convert all kinds of people with all kinds of attitudes into customers and keep them for the long term. That happens when you learn how to build solid customer relationships. Relationships don’t happen overnight; they are built over time. In fact, they typically go through four stages of development. We call these stages the Constant Contact Cycle, shown in Figure 2.1. Maximizing each stage in the cycle is critical to your email marketing.\n\nSTAGE ONE—ACQUIRE: THE BEGINNINGS OF A NEW CUSTOMER Married couples (at least happily married couples) and other people in great relationships like to be asked, “Where did you two meet?” Similarly, you should ask every new prospective customer: “How did you ﬁnd out about us?” Before you can start building a high number of lasting relationships, lots of people have to “ﬁnd out” about you. You have to acquire those relationships in the ﬁrst place by gaining someone’s attention in an initial communication or meeting.\n\n16\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nAcquiring new relationships through email is challenging. You can’t use email to send your marketing messages to total strangers because people think unfamiliar emails are spam. If your prospects think you’re a spammer, that’s not going to result in positive or profitable responses to your emails (to read more about spam, ﬂip ahead to Chapter 4). So, you have to acquire new relationships without using email, or by using email to gain referrals at more developed stages of your customer relationships. Good ways to get people’s attention and acquire new relationships include online advertising, search engine marketing, and traditional advertising. After you have earned a potential customer’s attention, you can move to stage two of the Constant Contact Cycle and make a connection that’s strong enough that they will be willing to give you their contact information.\n\nSTEP TWO—CONNECT: FINDING COMMON INTERESTS AND DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF YOUR BUSINESS The second stage in the Constant Contact Cycle is to establish a connection. After you have acquired someone’s attention, the connection point happens when you effectively demonstrate the value of your business to your newly acquired prospect. At Constant Contact we call this the “click” point. What does it mean to click? It means your newly acquired prospect has found something in common with you and is interested in either learning more or continuing to stay in touch after an initial purchase. You’ll know when you’ve “clicked” or “made a connection” when your prospect is willing to share his or her email address by signing up for your email list. Once you have someone’s email address, you can move from higher-cost and less personal “acquisition” advertising and communications to lower-cost and more personal email marketing messages to build customer relationships. Since demonstrating your value is crucial to making the connections that result in a growing email list, it’s important to communicate the value of joining your email list at the ﬁrst sign of attention. For example, I personally enjoy shopping at small businesses because I like to walk in the door and know that the person I am buying from is truly passionate and knowledgeable about what he is selling. Recently, I walked into a wine store called Vintages in West Concord,\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\n17\n\nMassachusetts (www.vintagesonline.com). I happened to meet the owner, whose name is Eric, and I told him that I was looking for a special wine for a friend’s 50th birthday. I quickly found out that Eric understands the value of making connections because he jumped up from behind the counter and gave me a quick tour of the wine section of the store. He engaged me in a dialogue to determine my level of interest and knowledge. Then he demonstrated his expertise by discussing the wines that would be worthy of a 50th birthday gift. We settled on a Spanish red and, since I’m an email marketer, I asked Eric if I could sign up for his email list. This took him by surprise, but I suspect he would have asked me if I had not asked ﬁrst. He told me he would be glad to sign me up and told me that his wife (the co-owner) used Constant Contact to send the emails for the store. He actually had a copy of their most recent email newsletter out on the counter. Now I receive Eric’s wine recommendations regularly and I’ve become a loyal customer. All this happened because Eric engaged me in a dialogue and listened to my interests before demonstrating his value. I suspect next time I’m in the store looking for a bottle of port, he’ll be just as quick to give me a tour of the port section, share his expertise, and start sending me port recommendations. You don’t have to meet people in person to make connections. You can also use your web site, blogs, videos, social media web sites, podcasts, and traditional media to demonstrate your value and ask for email addresses. Just make sure you strive to include as many of the following elements as possible when making connections.\n\nBe Ready to Respond When your acquisition marketing gets someone’s attention, you usually only have one shot to make a connection. For example, your web site needs to be set up to respond to visitors with relevant information and the ability to sign up for more information. At Constant Contact we use different language on our landing pages and our web site depending on what online advertisement our prospects have responded to. That way, we can display more relevant messages to our web site visitors. If your web site isn’t dynamic enough to handle custom messages, you can set up different landing pages for your ads or just give people relevant links so they can quickly ﬁnd and sign up for the information\n\n18\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nthey are most interested in. To learn more about the tactical ways to obtain email addresses and other information, read Chapter 5.\n\nEngage in a Dialogue Finding out what your prospects and customers are interested in requires communication both from and to your newly acquired prospects. In the wine store example, this happened in person, but it can also happen online through surveys, trial and error, analytics, and tracking. Be sure to have a couple of standard open-ended questions on hand as conversation starters (e.g., “What type of appliances are you looking for?”). Then once you gain an understanding of the general needs of the customer you can narrow down to their speciﬁc needs and interests by asking closed-ended questions (e.g., “Are you interested in gas or electric ranges?”). It’s also important to ﬁgure out the level of interest and expertise of prospective customers when you engage them in a dialogue. That way, you won’t talk over their heads as you demonstrate your knowledge and value.\n\nDemonstrate Your Value in Their Words The most effective way to demonstrate your value is to acknowledge the speciﬁc products or services your prospects and customers ﬁnd valuable. In the aforementioned wine store example, Eric acknowledged my need for a 50th birthday present, not just a bottle of red wine. This prompted him to share a speciﬁc section of his wine store and a speciﬁc area of his expertise instead of just showing me the “Expensive Wine” section.\n\nAdd Value When Asking to Continue the Dialogue Asking to continue the dialogue is more than just asking people to join a generic email list. Your email list should be an extension of your business value. In the case of the wine store, I valued Eric’s recommendations because I needed a bottle of wine that would be appropriate for an important friend at an important time. If I came into the store looking for a bottle of wine, it might have been more appropriate to ask me to join a “weekly specials” email list. If you’re a medium or large business and your employees are the ones responsible for making connections, it’s important to engage\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\n19\n\nyour employees and get them thinking about making connections too. At Constant Contact we put all new employees through “onboarding training.” This training not only provides our employees with an understanding for how our product works but also trains them in how our customers use our products and services to help them succeed in business. By helping our employees understand the many ways our customers use our product, we increase the likelihood that we click with customers on phone calls, through our marketing programs, and through the products that our engineers and product teams create. A great way to understand how you can start making more connections with your customers is to evaluate the businesses that have made connections with you or your employees. Start by writing down the names of your favorite small businesses or organizations. Then write next to each name what makes the connection special. Is it the way you are treated by their staff, the quality of what they provide, or the contributing role they play in your community? As you look over your list, you will probably notice that there are a lot of different ways that businesses have made a connection with you. You need to be aware of the many potential ways that your customers connect with other businesses so you can identify and encourage any connections you are currently missing. Another element to think about is how you felt immediately after you made a connection with a business and how long the experience lasted in your memory. Did they follow up on their connection with emails or other communications to extend the experience? Connecting with your customers also includes every positive interaction and exchange that happens after the ﬁrst interaction. Every future positive connection reafﬁrms your customer’s motivation to continue in the relationship, and every future negative connection reafﬁrms the possibility that your competition might be a better choice. When you really connect with a business, the impression lasts. Email marketing, when done right, provides you with the ability to continue the connection. And that brings us to the third stage in the Constant Contact cycle: nurture your connections.\n\nSTAGE THREE—NURTURE: CONTINUING THE CONNECTION The third stage in the Constant Contact Cycle is nurture. Nurturing your relationships keeps your business top-of-mind between purchases\n\n20\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nand extends the value you create when you acquire new relationships and connect with people. Without nurturing, the value you demonstrated during the process of making a connection will diminish over time, and your prospect or customer will forget all about you or become distracted by your competition’s attempts to acquire new relationships through acquisition marketing. It’s commonly known among marketers that it takes six to seven touches to turn a connection into a ﬁrst-time customer in almost every business. While some people will buy on the very ﬁrst connection, many with interest will choose to do more research or simply wait a while before making a purchase. Regardless of whether someone purchases from you on the ﬁrst connection or the tenth, it’s important to realize that your stream of ongoing communications must be based on your original connection to effectively nurture your relationships. In the case of email marketing, it’s important to write content that acknowledges your original connection or your emails will become irrelevant and people will unsubscribe from your list before you have a chance to send more than a few messages to them. For example, if you made a connection because someone trusted your expertise, send emails that share more of your expertise versus simply promoting what you offer. During the 2008 holiday shopping season, many big-box retailers forgot about their customer connections when the economic downturn prompted them to bombard consumers with every email coupon, offer, special, discount, and bundle of value they could think of. At the same time, Constant Contact was advising our customers to continue nurturing their relationships using the same best-practices that worked before the economic downturn. The results were made obvious in a joint report by eMarketer and ReturnPath that showed 98.6 percent of consumers felt they received too many emails over the holidays. More than 30 percent of respondents said the emails were junk and 60 percent said they just deleted unfamiliar and unwanted emails. What’s more, just over 33 percent of respondents said the emails had no impact on their holiday spending.\n\nKitchen Outﬁtters (www.kitchen-outﬁtters.com; see Figure 2.2) rallied all of the other store owners in its strip mall through a customer appreciation event on a Sunday afternoon leading\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\n21\n\nFigure 2.2 Kitchen Outfitters rallies local stores to drive holiday sales.\n\nup to the holidays. By banding together neighboring stores along with expert musicians from a local music school, Kitchen Outﬁtters was able to attract a large audience, engage their local community, drive signiﬁcant foot trafﬁc, and generate business—defying the odds at a time when every sale mattered. Knowing what I know about email marketing, I guarantee these emails not only failed to nurture the connections the retailers made into more purchases during the holidays, they also made it more difﬁcult—if not impossible—for these retailers to nurture their connections into a relationship of trust, which is the fourth and most valuable stage of the Constant Contact Cycle.\n\nSTAGE FOUR—TRUST: THE END AND THE BEGINNING Acquiring, connecting, and nurturing correctly will result in many valuable business relationships, but the most valuable business\n\n22\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nrelationships have the added element of trust. The reason trust is so valuable is because trusting customers begin to value their relationship with your business as much as you value your relationship with them and their patronage. The ﬁrst act of trust actually happens during the connection stage of the Constant Contact Cycle, because someone has to trust you enough to share his or her email address with you. The kind of trust that is present in the fourth stage of the Constant Contact Cycle is much deeper, however. It develops over the course of many email communications, personal interactions, and time. The number of emails is less important than the types of emails you send. The more targeted, relevant, and valuable the information you are sending, the more trust will develop in your relationships. Also, the more time your customers spend on your email list receiving your emails without unsubscribing, the more trust will develop in your relationships. Trust is extremely valuable to your business. Customers who trust you are more willing to respond to your email promotions. That means you’ll motivate more purchases per email in a trusting audience than in an audience of new connections. It’s possible for a business to survive solely on repeat business from a trusting customer base because of the higher response rates, but the business has to build up enough trusting customers to generate a sustainable amount of purchases per email. More purchases per email also translates into less time, money, energy, and effort spent creating acquisition marketing to attract new customers into the cycle. If you can sustain and grow your business on trust, you’ll also acquire new relationships through referrals. This brings me to the second result of trust: Trusting customers are more willing to refer your business to their friends and colleagues. People who refer your business to others are putting their reputation on the line for your business. The more trust you develop in your relationships, the more referrals you’re going to get. When trusting customers refer you to others, they are starting the Constant Contact Cycle for you all over again by helping you acquire a new relationship at nearly zero cost to you. One of the most powerful things about email marketing is that it’s easy to forward an email message on to others. In fact, the Forward Button in your email program is a constant reminder to your customers that they can share your message with others.\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\n23\n\nTrust Pays Dividends I took several of our customers out to dinner in Los Gatos, California, a number of years ago to get a better understanding for how email marketing had impacted their businesses. One of the participants told the group about his ﬁrst encounter with Constant Contact. He ran a business that helped companies that were relocating with furniture and ﬁxtures and he had a list of roughly 1,400 trusting customers. When he sent his ﬁrst email, it resulted in a six-ﬁgure sale. That would have been a great story all by itself, but the story was even more compelling when he stated that the sale was not made to anyone on the email list but rather to someone who received the email as a forward from someone on the list. Now that’s trust really paying dividends!\n\nFour Examples and Rewards of Running a Relationship Business Great customer relationships that develop into trust deﬁne the health and growth potential of your business. Trust results in repeat business and referrals, and there are also many other rewards associated with strong relationships. The following sections provide four windows into the kinds of beneﬁts you can expect in return when you focus your email marketing on building toward trust instead of just promoting transactions. Each section includes a beneﬁt and a real-life example of a business that has derived the beneﬁt using email marketing to develop trust. These are the same beneﬁts we strive for at Constant Contact, and they have made us very successful. Use our experience, and the following examples, as a guide so you can start recognizing and building valuable relationships of your own through your email marketing.\n\nYOU’RE FIRST When you invest in building relationships with your customers, they return the favor by thinking of you ﬁrst when the time comes for making a purchase. Customers who have a relationship with you will also go out of their way and ignore the competition.\n\n24\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nI lived in New York City in the late 1980s, and at that time I began shopping for clothing at a men’s clothing store called Rothman’s. The store offers high-quality clothing at reasonable prices with the added beneﬁt of store employees who really go out of their way to provide their customers with a great shopping experience (see Figure 2.3). Over time, the store owner, Ken Giddon, and I became good friends because he made every shopping experience special and nurtured our relationship with ongoing relevant and valuable communications. To this day, when it comes to shopping for clothing, I put most purchases on hold until travel takes me from Acton, Massachusetts, to New York where I do all my shopping at Rothmans. Email marketing is not only about trying to sell more product, it’s also about extending the shopping experience and building trust. Rothmans’ email marketing campaigns continue the Rothmans experience by sharing tips on men’s fashion, advice on how to select a well-made suit, or ways to spruce up an old suit with a new shirt and tie. The emails not only build trust, they make their customers think of them ﬁrst and foremost.\n\nPRICE IS PETTY Customers who value your relationship are less price-sensitive than customers who only value the transaction. That doesn’t mean you can charge anything you want for your products or services, and it certainly doesn’t mean you should reward loyal customers with higher prices. What it does mean is you won’t have to spend too much of your valuable time bargaining with customers or worrying too much about how your competition is pricing their products and services. I have one of those major home supply stores right by my ofﬁce, but I prefer to go to the local Acton ACE hardware store for most of my hardware needs. The primary reason is the connection I have with the people who work there. I realize that I am probably paying a little more for a certain piece of hardware; however, they take the time to ﬁnd me when I walk in the door and ask me what I am looking for, versus the major home supply store where I spend half my time in the store trying to ﬁnd someone who knows where the stuff is that I need. Time is money, and it’s more important for me to quickly ﬁnd what I am looking for than for me to save 20 percent on a box of nails, and in addition it feels great to be able to support our local business community.\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\nFigure 2.3 Rothman’s extends the shopping experience.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nCUSTOMERS RETURN MORE OFTEN The stronger your relationships, the easier it will become to draw your customers back to your business. Repeat business usually starts out of familiarity or convenience, and then grows as trust develops. When you develop trust, your repeat business starts to come from a sense of obligation or even emotional attachment. Those feelings are valuable to your business because they generate very loyal customers. They are also very fragile, however. When you have relationships of trust in your business, be extra careful not to take advantage of those relationships and make sure you are thanking your loyal customers often. Il Forno is my family’s favorite local go-to restaurant. Whenever we talk about going out for dinner, it is the ﬁrst restaurant that comes to mind. It’s our ﬁrst pick because the food is great, and more importantly, the wait staff recognize us when we walk in the door. In fact, it was actually the actions of one employee, Jenn, that won us over on our ﬁrst visit. She learned the names of our children, asked us what we wanted for dinner, and had the kitchen create her favorite salad, which was not on the menu. She also made sure to welcome us back each time we returned to the restaurant. When you have this type of relationship, email marketing is all about making your audience feel like part of your family.\n\nCUSTOMERS SPREAD THE WORD When you develop trust in your relationships, you’re going to get more direct referrals, and your customers are going to spread the word about your business without giving you a direct referral. Here’s how it works: It comes down to basic human nature. When your customers trust you and frequent your business, they will share stories about their interactions with you through the course of normal human interaction. It’s human nature to want to be perceived as being smart, connected, and knowledgeable. People will talk about your business with friends, colleagues, and co-workers because they like to share knowledge that adds value to conversations. Your job as an email marketer is to make sure your customers have knowledge that is worth sharing with others. At Constant Contact we have learned that leads that come from our existing customers convert at the highest rates of any of our new customer sources. There is nothing like\n\nThe Power of Email Relationships\n\n27\n\nFigure 2.4 Flyte shares knowledge with its audience. one business owner saying to another, “You should be using Constant Contact.” Flyte news media’s (www.ﬂyte.biz) “ﬂyte log” newsletter contains a wealth of information on how to succeed online (see Figure 2.4). In this edition, the company president and author, Rich Brooks, dedicates the entire body of the communication to helping his readers learn how to leverage online video for fun and proﬁt. In sharing his knowledge with his readers, Rich is not only reinforcing his reputation as an expert in the space, he’s also greatly increasing the likelihood that his readers will share their newfound source of great knowledge with others. When I ask business owners where the majority of their business is going to come from in the next month or quarter, the reply I typically\n\n28\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nreceive is “from my existing customers.” At this point I usually borrow a quote from Warren Buffett, who said “In the business world the rear view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.” While I am not sure of the context of Mr. Buffett’s statement, the point is that by focusing your attention on the satisﬁed customer walking out the door you will ﬁnd a clearer path to success. Harnessing the power of relationships is all about tapping into the rear view mirror through ongoing communications with people that already know who you are. In the next chapter we will explore why email marketing is the most cost-effective way to continue an ongoing conversation with your customers.\n\n3\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\nI live close to a golf course, so my garage is always full of golf balls collected by my children. We literally have big plastic containers ﬁlled with golf balls sorted by type and condition. While I like to keep a container with the best of them in my trunk to meet my endless need, my children have other ideas. Mitchell and Madeline, who seem to have the same entrepreneurial spirit I have, would rather sell these balls back to the golfers as they drive by our house on their way home. The reality is, turning a proﬁt on free golf balls might prove less proﬁtable than they hope. After all, attracting people to a curbside store will require a communication strategy. They’ll need to buy a sign to put in the yard, and since not everyone lives on our street, they may have to place an ad in the country club newsletter to let people know when they’ll be in the yard, get the other neighbors to drive by our house, and explain why it’s worth driving out of their way for some used golf balls. If they aren’t careful, they might end up spending more money to advertise the golf balls than the value of their time spent acquiring them in the ﬁrst place. A lot of small business owners make the same mistake. In order to be proﬁtable, marketing communications have to result in more money taken in than they cost. This chapter explains how to efﬁciently use email marketing to make sure the money you spend on all your marketing efforts generates enough money for your business.\n\n29\n\n30\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nHow to Maximize the Return on Your Email Marketing Dollars Depending on which study you read, it can take six to seven interactions to turn a prospective customer into a ﬁrst-time customer. Many of the business owners who come to Constant Contact seeking higher returns on their marketing dollars quickly realize that higher returns happen when they stop focusing so heavily on acquiring new customers and spend more time communicating effectively after the initial touch.\n\nIDENTIFYING YOUR CUSTOMER TOUCH POINTS Figuring out where your customers come from helps you determine where to invest your money and where to cut unproﬁtable spending. In case you think you know exactly where your customers come from, consider the following example: Sally, a small business owner with a brick-and-mortar jewelry store, is contemplating stopping sending emails because most of her new customers were coming from the online ads she places on Google when people search for “jewelry store in Omaha, NE.” When Sally asks her new customers how they found out about her, they say they searched online and found her web site. However, if she had conducted further investigation, she would have found that her new customers actually come from her emails and several other touch points. For example, she asks people to join her email list at the networking events she attends each week. These prospective customers are receiving her emails, but they aren’t always ready to buy jewelry immediately when the emails go out. When Sally’s customers are ready to buy, they remember the networking event, the emails, and the town her store is in, but they don’t remember the name of her store or exactly where it’s located. So, they search for “jewelry store in Omaha, NE” to ﬁnd out where the store is and when she is open. Then they drive to Sally’s store, which happens to be across the street from another jewelry store. Since the sign over her store looks the same as the logo on her web site, Sally’s customers are able to track her down easily. However, if Sally were to ask customers how they found her, she would be just as likely to hear from a web search,\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\n31\n\nyellow pages, or the sign on the door as she would be to hear the real source—her networking efforts. This simple example highlights the challenges of ﬁguring out which of your marketing efforts drives the greatest return for your business. That said, the more you know about your sources, the more effective you can be in maximizing your spend. The combination of your marketing media is known as the marketing mix, and it’s important to understand the role each touch point plays in driving business your way. When I work with business owners on maximizing their email marketing spend, I often start by assessing their overall marketing strategy. I start here because email marketing is a critical component of a comprehensive marketing strategy and it needs to be interwoven with every other marketing program being deployed. I typically start the marketing strategy discussion with a conversation on the market opportunity, during which I ask three questions: 1. Deﬁne your target market. What are the characteristics of your most likely customers (age, gender, location, interests, business types, etc.)? 2. How do they congregate (where, with whom, when, etc.)? 3. How do you plan to reach them (directly, indirectly, word of mouth, etc.)? This is followed by a discussion of where the business owners believe their revenue will come from over the next 24 months. I ask them to answer this question by allocating a percentage of the total future revenue into one of three buckets: 1. The Unaware. people or businesses that have no idea who you are today 2. The Aware. people or businesses that know of you today but are not a customer 3. The Active. people or businesses that have already purchased from you Simply put, the ultimate goal of your marketing strategy is to make the unaware aware, drive the aware to become active, and get the active to return on a regular basis. To maximize your marketing mix,\n\n32\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nFigure 3.1 Constant Contact Cycle with Marketing Mix you simply need to determine the most cost-effective way to move people from one stage to the next and then determine how much of your budgeted time and dollars you want to allocate to each step. I often use Figure 3.1 to demonstrate the correlation between the Constant Contact Cycle and the components of a well deﬁned marketing strategy, and the role email marketing plays to point out how they are interdependent and aligned. The inner ring (1) of the diagram is the process through which relationships are formed, starting with acquisition and leading ultimately to trust. At each stage of the cycle it is important to understand that different marketing strategies are needed in order to move a customer from one stage to the next. The second ring (2) highlights these strategies and they are more fully deﬁned below. The ﬁnal ring (3) represents the role of email marketing and the typical path that it takes as it is integrated into the overall marketing mix. You will note that it starts at point 3 (Grow Stage), with email being sent to engage existing customers, and then migrates back towards acquire as it is deployed to help in converting prospects to customers and ultimately into an acquisition vehicle as recipients forward your communications on to others. A well designed email marketing strategy acts as grease that speeds up the customer relationship cycle (Ring 1). In looking at the chart above, it’s interesting to note that businesses typically think marketing focuses solely on moving the aware to action (Acquisition Marketing). As we will explore in subsequent chapters, a well structured email\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\n33\n\nmarketing strategy typically starts with getting repeat business from those who have already purchased from you (Action Marketing), but then naturally migrates back around to enhance Acquisition Marketing efforts and ultimately drive awareness. Before you dive into the process of determining your marketing allocation, it’s worthwhile to evaluate the characteristics of the marketing mix available to you at each stage in the process. This will help you balance your investments and maximize the velocity at which the cycle spins.\n\nStage One: Awareness Marketing: The Process of Making People Aware that You Exist The key to Awareness Marketing success is understanding your target market. The narrower you can deﬁne your market, the easier it will be to determine the most suitable marketing medium to use. For example, for a plumber this might be the yellow pages, for a coffee shop it might be as simple as having a great looking sign and being in the right location, for a non-proﬁt it might be getting coverage by the local press. Awareness Marketing programs tend to be the most expensive type of marketing you will do for your business. This is due, in part, to the fact that it is often difﬁcult to track the return on your marketing investment. At Constant Contact, we consider our national radio campaign to be an Awareness Marketing campaign. Email marketing is not a marketing medium that is typically thought about as something used to create awareness. However, if you do email marketing well, awareness can be generated through word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nStage Two: Acquisition Marketing: The Process of Driving the Aware to Take Action This form of marketing is typically easier to track than awareness marketing. At Constant Contact, we consider the marketing efforts that drive trafﬁc to our web site to be Acquisition Marketing and we track each source based on volume, quality, and longevity. This enables us to determine the best places for us to invest to drive new business. The key element associated with this type of marketing is that there is a clear direction you want the prospective customer to take. Whether it is to your web site, storefront, or an event, the path is clear\n\n34\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nand traceable. Email marketing plays an integral role in acquisition marketing because once you’ve established a connection, it is the most cost effective way for you to communicate and nurture the connection into a ﬁrst time customer.\n\nStage Three: Action Marketing: The Process of Getting the Active to Return on a Regular Basis Once you have invested in acquiring a customer, you have done all the heavy lifting from an investment standpoint. Now it’s up to you to continue to remind your customers of the value you provide so they continue to return to you when they need what you provide. This is truly the sweet spot of email marketing. By regularly delivering professional communications that contain information the recipient ﬁnds valuable, you will maximize the revenue potential of your customers, maximize the return on investment of all your other marketing investments, and likely reap the added beneﬁt of word-of-mouth marketing as your customers forward your message on to their friends and family. Now it’s time to take out a piece of paper and write down your marketing strategy. Be sure to list every place you interact with your customers and prospective customers. This is something you will want to update regularly. It will give you a great starting point for determining how to incorporate email marketing into your overall mix.\n\nFIGURING OUT HOW MUCH TO INVEST Spending money on marketing is going to feel a lot more like an expense than an investment if you rely too heavily on using paid mass messages to turn total strangers into customers. In fact, the economics of a successful marketing mix are derived from your ability to invest in the most effective messaging after one of your ﬁrst touch points grabs the attention of a total stranger. Compare the following two scenarios with the same starting economics, as shown in Table 3.1. Let’s say you decide to spend $500 on a paid mass advertisement that results in ten people walking into your store. Out of ten people: Two have an immediate need for what you sell and will make a $100 purchase Six are potential future buyers Two aren’t interested in your business at all.\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\n35\n\nTable 3.1 Two Marketing Scenarios Scenario\n\n1 2\n\nSpend ($)\n\nProspects\n\nSales ($)\n\nInterest\n\nNo Interest\n\nContact Info\n\nAdded Sales ($)\n\n500 500\n\n10 10\n\n200 200\n\n6 6\n\n2 2\n\n0 6\n\n0 400\n\nScenario 1: You sell your product to the two with an immediate need and make $200. Since you spent $500 on the ad, the net cost to you was $300 to generate those sales. If you want to get more customers in the store, you could run another $500 ad and lose another $300, or you can do what I recommend by following Scenario 2. Scenario 2: You sell your product to the two with an immediate need and you make $200. You also make a good enough impression on four of the other six that they are willing to share their email addresses. If you also get contact information from the two customers, you now have contact information for six new prospects. At this point, you have experienced the same economics as Scenario 1, but you no longer have to spend $500 to get more customers in the store because you can send your email newsletter and email promotions as a follow up to the people who shared their email addresses. Of course, this will cost you much less. (As an example, Constant Contact allows you to send as many emails as you want, up to 500 people, for $15.00 per month.) If your follow-up emails result in one of the two customers coming back to make a purchase and three of the six interested prospects coming back to make a purchase, the four new purchases will result in $400 in added sales, and you will now have a proﬁt of $100 instead of a $300 loss, minus the low costs of your email program. Having a communications strategy can not only help you generate additional revenue from your marketing efforts, it can actually change the economics so that investments that make no sense alone can actually become proﬁtable when looked at collectively. Figuring out how much to invest isn’t about assigning a percentage of your budget to advertising, it’s about making investments in messages that work together to live beyond the ﬁrst touch. In the next section I’ll explain where to invest.\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\n36\n\nCUTTING THE FAT AND MAXIMIZING YOUR INVESTMENTS Now it’s time for a little math. You need to ﬁnd out the cost of acquisition (COA) for each customer source so you can determine whether you need to cut a cost, apply a lower cost messaging strategy to an upfront cost, or invest more in the same cost. The cost of acquisition is a fancy way of asking, “How much do I have to invest in a given source for it to generate a new customer?” Here is the formula: Amount spent COA = The number of customers generated Example using Direct Mail: $10, 000 Amount spent on 10, 000 pieces (annually) = $100 COA 100 Number of customers generated (annually) Take out a piece of paper and calculate the COA for each of your customer touch points. For now, leave out email marketing. Once you have a COA for each source, list them on a piece of paper from highest to lowest. Table 3.2 shows an example. This summary highlights the magnitude and productivity of each of your marketing investments. Whether you have additional money to spend on marketing your business or are looking to re-balance your current spending to maximize your return, this approach provides you with the information you need to make the right decisions. However, before you start slashing costs or investing more, it is equally important to do some re-weighting of your results based on the quality and quantity of the leads generated from each source. Table 3.2 Example COA Without Email Marketing Type of Ad Newspaper Ads: Direct Mail: Directory Listing: Improved Web Site: Search Advertising: Word-of-Mouth Referrals: Totals:\n\nCost ($)\n\nCustomers\n\n15,000 10,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 0 40,000\n\n75 100 50 50 100 25 400\n\nCOA ($) 200 100 100 100 50 0 100 (avg)\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\n37\n\nTable 3.3 Example COA with Email Marketing Lead Nurture Type of Ad\n\nCost ($)\n\nCustomers\n\nNewspaper Ads: Direct Mail: Directory Listing: Improved Web Site: Search Advertising: Word-of-Mouth Referrals: Email Marketing∗ :\n\n15,000 10,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 0 500\n\n75 100 50 50 100 25 275∗\n\nTotals:\n\n40,500\n\n675\n\nCOA ($) 200 100 100 100 50 0 1.80 60\n\nLeads 500 250 500 500 750 250 0 2,750∗\n\nassumes that email marketing can convert 10 percent of your leads into future customers. Though I can’t share our conversion rate at Constant Contact, I can assure you that our rate is much higher than that.\n\n∗\n\nIn the example above, it would be easy to make the case to eliminate the newspaper ad since it is clearly the most expensive source of customers. However, if your newspaper ad runs in a highly targeted publication and you receive 500 quality leads from that ad per year, you might be able to justify the expense if you ﬁnd a way to convert those leads at a lower cost using email marketing. An example of this is shown in Table 3.3. Note that acquiring 275 additional customers for only $1.80 each brings the total cost of acquisition down by 40 percent from $100 each to $60 each. In this case, it might make more sense to cut your direct mail and invest that money in more newspaper or search ads. The quality of your leads and the contact information you receive has a direct impact on your ability to convert those customers. Poor quality leads could increase your costs or eliminate your ability to convert anyone to a customer. For example, if you have a shoe store and the search engine ad in the table above reﬂects visitors who searched for “hiking boots,” you shouldn’t count those visitors as quality leads unless you are sure they were potential customers trying to buy hiking boots instead of high school students writing reports on camping gear. Usually you need to collect some identifying information to count someone as a lead, and the quality of that information impacts your ability to follow up in a meaningful way.\n\n38\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nFigure 3.2 COA and Break-Even Analysis All these examples point to one thing: If you can follow up multiple times at a low cost, you’ll gain more customers and spend less money in the long run. Figure 3.2 shows a form that you can use to ﬁgure out your own Cost of Acquisition and the number of purchases needed to break even on a new customer.

Once you’ve identiﬁed places to cut or invest, spend some time thinking about non-monetary ways you can impact the number of leads you generate from each source. For example, you can stimulate wordof-mouth and referrals by asking for them instead of waiting for them. From my experience at Constant Contact, I can say that trying to stimulate word-of-mouth is difﬁcult to accomplish by investing money in gifts and expensive programs. Customers who refer you to others are putting their reputation on the line for your business, and that is something, for most people, that cannot be bought. However, it can\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\n39\n\nbe encouraged by simply telling people at the bottom of your email that you appreciate it when people refer your business to others and inviting them to forward your email to one or two other people who might ﬁnd the content interesting. It’s also a good idea to use some of the money you cut from your marketing budget to invest in experimentation. Once you know what you are currently paying to attract new customers, you are well positioned to not only optimize the return you generate from these sources, but to negotiate with new sources. At Constant Contact our marketing mantra is “test, then invest.” We are open to trying any marketing program that reliably reaches our customer demographic and is something that we can measure. However, we ﬁrst test it on a small scale in order to determine that it generates new customers within our cost tolerances. If it performs, then we scale it accordingly. In all cases, make sure your communications provide all interested prospective customers with a way to continue the dialogue in a way that provides you with a low-cost connection.\n\nReaping the Soft Benefits of Email Marketing In addition to the direct ﬁnancial beneﬁts of email marketing, there are a number of other ﬁnancial beneﬁts that are difﬁcult to track. For example, if your logo appears in an email, you might not see sales from people who drove right over to your store to make a purchase, but it might make your web site seem more familiar to a visitor who has seen the email, and that might make her more comfortable making a purchase at a later date. These kinds of beneﬁts are known as soft beneﬁts. I can tell you ﬁrsthand that soft beneﬁts translate into ﬁnancial impact, and I can also tell you that you shouldn’t spend any time or money trying to emulate the big money branding strategies you see from large companies in hopes of receiving soft beneﬁts in return. The right approach to soft beneﬁts is to pay attention to them and let them happen while you’re pursuing measurable direct-response communications. The next sections explain many of the soft beneﬁts you can derive at a low cost while you’re gaining from the more direct beneﬁts of your email marketing strategy.\n\n40\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nTOP-OF-MIND AWARENESS Have you ever spent a lot of time with potential customers teaching them about your products or services, only to ﬁnd out that they made a purchase from someone else? When you hang up the phone or the customer walks out the door of your ofﬁce or leaves your web site, the opportunity to stay “top-of-mind” with your customer starts to diminish. The more time that elapses, the greater the likelihood that the customer will forget all about the services or products you offer. It happens to everyone at one time or another because even people with the best intentions make purchase decisions based on being in close proximity to an offer at the precise time when they are ready to make a purchase. When you send professional-looking email communications, you remind your audience that you exist and you’re ready to serve them when they need you. Top-of-mind awareness also helps you gain referrals. When one of your customers gives a referral, he or she is likely to share the ﬁrst few businesses that come to mind. If you’re in front of your customers with regular email communications, you’re more likely to be at the top of the list. Competition among hotels on Cape Cod is high due to the tourist-based, seasonal nature of the region. As the proprietor of the Crowne Pointe Historic Inn and Spa, David Sanford wanted customers to think of his hotel as a signature Provincetown destination twelve months a year (see Figure 3.3). David abandoned his traditional marketing approach in favor of email marketing, which enabled him to regularly reach out to customers in a timely, inexpensive way that captured Crowne Pointe’s elegant brand. He sends monthly updates about hotel, spa, and restaurant promotions to his list. As a result of his efforts, he has been able to greatly improve year-round attendance at special and promotional events. There are two ways you can improve your ability to bring your customers back: customer loyalty (developed over time through a buildup of trust) and contact information (which provides you with the ability to maintain regular contact). In the case of new customers or prospective customers, you have not yet had a chance to build up trust, so the ability to maintain contact\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\nFigure 3.3 Crowne Pointe Inn stays top-of-mind with professional-looking campaigns.\n\n41\n\n42\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nis even more important. When it comes to customers with whom you have a lot of existing loyalty, email marketing works to “tap them on the shoulder” and say, “Do you need my services this month?” and “Do you have any friends who might?”\n\nHEIGHTENED BRAND IDENTITY Your customers need to be able to distinguish you from the competition and feel conﬁdent in your ability to provide what they need. The more times someone sees your logo, business name, colors, and other identifying features of your business, the more conﬁdent they will feel that your business is legitimate. If you’re a small business, you don’t need everyone to be able to draw your logo from memory, but you do need to make your business familiar to your audience. The best way to do that is by repeating the same brand elements in a consistent way. Building an identity also increases the response rates from your other marketing efforts when you use consistent branding (see Figure 3.4).\n\nFigure 3.4 Building an identity with email involves consistent branding across all communications.\n\nMaking Money: The Economics of Email\n\n43\n\nINCREASED CUSTOMER LOYALTY Loyal customers will bypass the competition on the way to your store, ofﬁce, or web site, because they trust you more than they trust the competition. Customer loyalty can be built through your email communications when you communicate your desire to continue the relationship with your customers after making a purchase. For example, compare a used car dealer who sells you a faulty car and disappears with a used car dealer who sells the same faulty car but sends a follow up email asking for your feedback and is willing to correct the problem when your response points to a disrepair. Loyalty results in more frequent purchases, higher purchases per transaction, and other beneﬁts that aren’t necessarily tied to the number or cost of communications you send. There are three major takeaway points when it comes to understanding the economics of email marketing. First, email marketing is not a standalone marketing strategy. It works in concert with all your other marketing efforts. Second, when done right, email marketing will make all your other marketing investments more effective. Finally, email marketing is most effective in helping you stay relevant and connected with the people that already know what you have to offer.\n\n4\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is a very inexpensive way to communicate. Not surprisingly, some misguided people think that the low cost of sending a message gives them the right to blast their message out to everyone with an email address. If I had to choose one thing that was the key to Constant Contact’s success in the early days, I would probably say that we were the ﬁrst email marketing company to take the issue of permission-based marketing very seriously. Constant Contact was an advocate for permission marketing in 1998, one year before Seth Godin’s famed book on the subject. Obviously, we weren’t the only ones who knew the power of permission. In 2001, we tested offering a list rental service through one of the most reputable list rental companies in the business. We quickly shut down this test when our customers gave us feedback that the results they were experiencing were horrible. I can honestly say that we would be doing our customers a tremendous disservice today if we allowed them to buy or rent email lists. This chapter explains how and why your reputation is on the line with every email that you send, and helps you to make sure every impression you make is a positive one.\n\n44\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\n45\n\nIs Your Email Glamorous or Spam-orous? Sending an email to someone who doesn’t know you is like putting up a sign in a storefront window that says: “Don’t Do Business with Me!” Whether your email is glamorous, because it is loved by your recipients, or “spam-orous” because it is perceived as spam by your recipients, is a legal, professional, and personal matter. It’s a legal matter because laws protect consumers from unsolicited email. It’s a professional matter because the Internet and email industries expect businesses to adhere to best practices. It’s a personal matter because ultimately your customers are the ones who determine what is spam and what is not. Quite simply, if they think your email is spam, then it’s spam. The following sections explain the personal issues related to spam. I cover the legal and professional issues a little later on.\n\nWHY CONSUMERS—NOT SENDERS—GET TO DECIDE WHAT SPAM IS Your deﬁnition of spam doesn’t matter, and neither does mine, unless we deﬁne it in exactly the same way as our recipients deﬁne it. The ultimate judge and jury when it comes to spam is the recipient of the message, not the sender. Consumers think spam is anything they don’t want or can’t verify. If they don’t want it, they think it’s spam. If they don’t know who it’s from, they think it’s spam. As a sender, you need to recognize that your recipient’s inbox is his or her property. The average consumer considers spam an invasion of privacy—trespassing, if you will. Put yourself in your recipient’s inbox. How do you react when you receive email from someone you don’t know and don’t trust? Immediate delete. Why? Because that person is wasting your time and violating your privacy. When you ask for someone’s email address and permission, you are asking to take some of his time and attention. When someone provides her email address, she is telling you that she respects you enough to give you something of value to her—her time and attention.\n\nTHE DANGERS OF TOO MANY SPAM COMPLAINTS Sending email to total strangers will result in spam complaints. You should be very concerned with how many spam complaints you receive, because they have the ability to ruin your email marketing\n\n46\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nstrategy. There are four reasons why you should do everything possible to avoid spam complaints.\n\n1. Your Reputation Is Tarnished. When people think your email is spam and your logo and business’s name appears in the email, they associate your business with those nasty spammers. If you were to send a bunch of postcards through the mail and nobody wanted them, people would just throw them away. But, if you were to send a bunch of emails through an Email Service Provider and nobody wanted them, people would hoot, holler, complain, and get enraged. Consumers really dislike spam.\n\n2. Your Emails Get Blocked or Filtered. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Yahoo!, AOL, and MSN are in business to deliver the emails their customers want, while keeping the emails they don’t want from getting to their inboxes. So they spend millions of dollars and countless resources trying to deliver good email while ﬁltering and blocking the bad email. ISPs keep track of senders who get too many spam complaints by registering the domain name and IP address of the senders who receive the complaints. Don’t let it bother you—that is, unless you receive more than one spam complaint in every 1,000 emails. After that, you’ll start to see those complaints negatively impact your reputation with ISPs and ESPs. Once your reputation is tarnished, your email is more likely to be ﬁltered or blocked by the ISPs.\n\n3. You Get Tossed from Email Service Providers. ESPs like Constant Contact send their customers’ emails from email servers owned by the ESP. In order to keep a good reputation with ISPs, ESPs need to help their customers keep their spam complaints low. Spam complaints directed at ESP customers are logged against the ESP, not the ESP’s customer. ESP customers who receive too many complaints and are unwilling to take measures to reduce the complaints are shut down to protect the rest of the ESP’s customers and their ability to deliver email to ISPs at the highest possible rate.\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\n47\n\n4. Your Customers Won’t Come Back When someone complains that your email is spam, you’re probably going to lose a customer for one of two reasons. First, your email probably isn’t going to get delivered to that customer’s inbox again, so your customer won’t receive the newsletters, promotions, or event invitations you work so hard to create. Second, your customer isn’t likely to be impressed with your business. If you’re perceived as a spammer, you’re like an annoying menace instead of a trusted friend.\n\nAVOIDING SPAM COMPLAINTS ENTIRELY ISN’T POSSIBLE, BUT MINIMIZING THEM IS Reporting email as spam can be as easy as clicking the “This is Spam” button in your email client (as shown in Figure 4.1), or as involved as ﬁnding the source of the email in the message headers and reporting that email as spam to the listed owner of the IP address. The public can also report unsolicited email to third-party reporting services, such as SpamCop and SpamHaus.\n\nFigure 4.1 The spam button allows consumers to easily report spam emails.\n\n48\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nSince spam complaints are often a matter of opinion, they are sometimes triggered by factors that are out of your control. Even if you’re a permission-based email marketer, if you wait long enough, you’ll get a few spam complaints. Sometimes you’ll even get them—albeit inadvertently—from your friends, relatives, and life-long customers. Within Constant Contact we provide our customers with feedback in the event that one of their recipients reports an email as spam. Receiving a spam complaint from someone who is supposed to know you and your business might feel like you’re being betrayed by a friend, especially when you’ve worked so hard to build a permission-based list. You are following the rules, so why the spam complaint? It may be that certain characteristics of your email look like spam to your subscribers or they aren’t satisﬁed with what they are getting from you. But take heart: There are ways to help more of your recipients respond with approval instead of with the spam button.\n\nHOW TO LOOK PROFESSIONAL IN A HOSTILE INBOX ENVIRONMENT The best way to look professional to your audience is to become an email critic and study what comes into your own inbox. I suggest creating several email folders, one for email that stands out from all others and positively impacts your opinion of the sender, and another for messages that make you never want to do business with a company. Over time, you may ﬁnd reasons to create sub-folders for great subject lines, beautiful templates, and great calls to action. However, for starters, two should sufﬁce. Leverage the best of the best as you create your campaigns, and before you schedule the campaign to be sent, check it against the characteristics of the bad campaigns to make sure you stand out from the crowd. Still, there are some common elements that can cause consumers to pull the spam-complaint trigger that might go unnoticed when you’re reviewing the emails in your inbox. Here are the ﬁve most common consumer spam-complaint triggers and how you can avoid pulling them.\n\n1. Questionable Identity Clearly communicating your identity is the number one way to avoid spam complaints. According to a survey by the Email Sender and Provider Coalition, 79 percent of consumers clicked the spam\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\n49\n\nbutton when they didn’t know who the sender was. Here are the two simplest ways to make your identity apparent. Use a familiar name in your “From” line. Use the same words your audience uses to identify you or your business. For example, if you’re an online business and your customers refer to you by your domain name instead of your formal business name, put your domain name in your From line. If you are your brand, and everyone on your list knows who you are, use your name. An example of a well formatted From line would be [email protected], while one at the other end of the spectrum might look like this: [email protected]. Include your brand. Insert your logo into the upper left or center of every email and include image descriptions (alt. text) for readers who have images disabled. Choose colors that identify your business when designing your email templates and use the same colors in every template you use. Don’t just use the stock template colors.\n\n2. Irrelevant Content Consumers expect their email subscriptions to deliver value. According to eMarketer, 46 percent of Internet users say the commercial emails they receive are not targeted to their needs. Since your email list is likely to include people with a variety of interests, take these interests into account before you send. Offer choices on your sign-up form. Some consumers want to receive promotions, while others only want informative newsletters. Offering options helps you make your emails relevant. Use click-through data to target future messages. When people click on your links, they tell you what they are interested in. Use this data to create different email lists. Send surveys and polls to learn about preferences. Instead of making assumptions about what to send, ask. You can conduct a formal survey before starting a major email campaign or use ongoing polls to get small bits of information over time and adjust your strategy as you go.\n\n50\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nFigure 4.2 Welcome emails help you to reinforce and match the interests of new subscribers.\n\n3. Broken Promises Sending emails that your subscribers didn’t ask for (i.e., promotions when they signed up for an email newsletter) can be perceived by your audience as a broken promise. Give your subscribers clear expectations before they share their email addresses, then keep your promises. Tell your new subscribers what you’re going to send. Clearly describe each type of email communication you offer (e.g., promotions, newsletters, event announcements) and ask new subscribers which they would like to receive. Send a welcome email after new subscribers join. Whether they join through your web site or you add them to your list after they subscribe ofﬂine, send a welcome email that clearly describes the email content you plan to send. You can also send welcome emails after your audience has received a few of your emails to make sure they are happy and receiving the right information (see Figure 4.2).\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\n51\n\n4. Excessive Promotion Selling your products or services is an important part of your email marketing, but, according to a Jupiter Research survey, 40 percent of consumers said they stopped subscribing to opt-in emails because they were getting too many offers. Sending promotions too frequently might lead to spam complaints. Keep your promotional frequency in line with your business model. If you sell items that are consumed quickly, your audience probably expects more frequent promotions than if you sell items that are normally purchased every few months, years, or once in a lifetime. Place promotions on your web site and use informative email content to drive clicks. Instead of putting an entire article and a promotion in your email newsletter, use only the ﬁrst two or three sentences in your email and post the rest of the article, and a related promotion, on your web site. Know your audience’s promotional preferences. Some consumers love coupons, sales, and discounts. Others don’t. If you’re not sure of your audience’s promotional preferences, use a survey, a poll, or a choice of interest list to sort your subscribers into groups.\n\n5. Confusion and Illusion Sometimes consumers report legitimate email as spam because they simply want to get off a list and don’t understand the negative impact of hitting that spam button. Here are two reasons why consumers might choose the spam button over the more forgiving option of unsubscribing. Your subscribers can’t figure out how to unsubscribe. If your audience has trouble ﬁnding the unsubscribe link at the bottom of your email, use a permission reminder at the top of your email that includes the link. Your subscribers don’t trust the unsubscribe link in your email. Use your sign-up process and welcome email to reinforce the ability to safely unsubscribe from your list by clicking the unsubscribe link in any of your emails.\n\n52\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing\n\nWhile it may be impossible to take the sting out of receiving a spam complaint, it is possible to minimize the amount of complaints you receive. Stick to permission-based tactics, make your identity clear, send relevant content, and keep tabs on your frequency. If you put all these tips into practice, then you’ve done everything in your power to keep subscribers on your list and stop them from clicking the spam button when they receive your emails.\n\nAdhering to the CAN-SPAM Act There are laws protecting consumers from all kinds of corrupt business practices, and spam is no exception. While this law will not stop spam, it does make most spam illegal and ultimately less attractive to spammers. The law is speciﬁc about requirements to send commercial email and empowers the federal government to enforce the law. The penalties can include a substantive ﬁne and/or imprisonment for up to ﬁve years. The law also includes a private right of action clause for Internet Service Providers (but not for individuals) to sue a sender regarding the receipt of prohibited messages. While I am not an attorney and therefore cannot provide legal advice, I feel it is important to provide you with Constant Contact’s interpretation of how the federal law may affect you. This is a summary of some provisions of the law and is not a full analysis of how it may apply to you. If you believe you may be affected, you should consult with your own attorney. The CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) Act went into effect January 1, 2004, and it preempts all state laws. This means it overrides all individual state spam laws (39 at last count). The great news is that now you only have to comply with one law—the federal law. If you use an Email Service Provider such as Constant Contact, you are already in compliance with much of the federal law, but there are a few other things you need to know. Constant Contact’s terms and conditions require that your list is permission-based, which means that you already comply with the unsolicited email requirements stated in the law: Your email header information is not misleading because it is set for you by Constant Contact.\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\n53\n\nFigure 4.3 Using Constant Contact helps keep your emails compliant. Your email’s From address is veriﬁed and already accurately identiﬁes you as the sender. Constant Contact automatically includes the ability for your contacts to opt-out of future email communications. Constant Contact automatically processes unsubscribes from your email communications. Constant Contact even asks our customers to conﬁrm the lists they upload comply with our policy as shown in Figure 4.3. Even if you use an Email Service Provider that helps keep you in compliance, there are a few more things you need to be aware of going forward. Make sure that your email campaign’s “Subject” line is straightforward, not misleading. The days of using cute phrases or tricks to boost open rates are over. The recent Adteractive settlement reinforces the FTC’s commitment to enforce this requirement. If you aren’t already doing so, any unsubscribe requests that come to you via a reply to your email must be honored within ten days of the request.\n\n54\n\nThe Constant Contact Guide to Email Marketing You need to include a physical address in your email campaigns. Constant Contact requires that you add a physical address before you can schedule a campaign: make sure that this address is a valid physical postal address for your organization.\n\nIn May 2008, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released its Statement of Basis and Purpose and Final Discretionary Rule (“Final Rule”) on the CAN-SPAM ACT. This statement contains four new rules and also contains some clariﬁcations and guidance to the text of the original act in the form of the Statement of Basis and Purpose (SBP). Note also that since the rules are new, it’s likely that the interpretations will evolve over time as the industry acquires more experience with implementations. If you are adhering to your ESP’s current terms and conditions, making sure that your messages contain a valid company name and physical address, and not working with afﬁliates or third-party advertisers, there are probably only a few things you need to consider: You should review the From address and From name you are using in your emails. At least one and preferably both of these should be clearly recognizable as belonging to your organization. Make sure you are not “procuring” the forwarding of your campaigns by offering any kind of incentive (e.g., coupons, discounts, T-shirts) to your recipients. Forwarded messages that contain incentives to forward will be noncompliant under CANSPAM because they will be considered commercial messages and will not contain the required opt-out mechanism. There were some modiﬁcations to the deﬁnition of “sender” in order to clarify the required CAN-SPAM compliance when there are multiple advertisers in a single message. In general, it clariﬁes that the From address visible to your recipients should be clearly recognizable as belonging to your organization. In addition, if you work with afﬁliates or you have third-party advertisements in your email campaigns, you should review the new rule provisions relating to the deﬁnition of sender as it relates to multi-sender emails. The opt-out mechanism must not be complicated: “an email recipient cannot be required to pay a fee, provide information other than his or her email address and opt-out preferences, or\n\nThe Benefits of Permission-Based Email Marketing\n\n55\n\ntake any steps other than sending a reply email message or visiting a single Internet web page to opt out of receiving future email from a sender.” (The Constant Contact opt-out mechanism is compliant with the new guidelines.)
