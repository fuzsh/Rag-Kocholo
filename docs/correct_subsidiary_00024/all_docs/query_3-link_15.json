        "text": "Vyomesh Joshi does not think of those trillions of pages crowding the Internet as the screen images they are. He sees them as the printouts they could be.\n\nWhat if every profile on MySpace.com, every blueprint on an architectural firm's intranet site and every map or picture or page of text that shows up on a Google search were easy to print out? Some are, of course--but Joshi says that many more are not.\n\nAs executive vice president of Hewlett-Packard's imaging and printing group, Joshi has a vested interest in raising that printability quotient. On Wednesday at Hewlett-Packard's Imaging and Printing Conference in Manhattan, Joshi is to introduce Print 2.0, the company's strategy for making printing relevant in an increasingly Web-centric world.\n\n\"We're going to make printing easier for everyone,\" he said in an interview Tuesday. But won't that benefit his competitors, too? \"Sure it will,\" he said. \"But we have the biggest share of the printer market, so we'll benefit the most.\"\n\nHewlett-Packard has put its money where Joshi's mouth is. It bought Tabblo, which makes software that enhances printability of Web pages, and in late June will begin offering free Tabblo \"tool kits\" to Web site developers. It bought Logoworks, which helps companies incorporate their logos and marketing materials into catalogs, posters or other print vehicles.\n\nIt has contracted with ViaMichelin, a map provider in Europe, and with Six Apart, a blog host, to make their pages more easily printed. And it will soon offer a service to retailers in which it will keep a digital library of obscure movies and burn DVD copies on request.\n\n\"We've gone from printer company to printing company, and the next step is to be known for printing services,\" said Doug Vaughan, worldwide senior vice president of marketing for the printing group.\n\nMany of the products are aimed at consumers, but even more are aimed at businesses, small as well as large. Hewlett-Packard wants more than their printing business; it wants to manage their entire information flow.\n\nIn the last few months the printing division has hired 1,000 sales representatives and sent them to woo commercial printers, retailers, banks and other large corporations. And this week it is introducing software and services aimed at helping big companies manage their information.\n\nThe strategy is not confined to the Web. The company is to introduce a handheld printer that can scan address information and print it directly on a package, saving the need for labels. And it is focusing heavily on lowering the costs of high-speed digital printing. Joshi said that conventional offset printers are still more cost-efficient for print jobs of more than 2,000 pages, but that Hewlett-Packard was working to change that tipping point to 15,000 pages in the next five years.\n\nThat takes Hewlett-Packard into hotly competitive territory, though. Xerox, for one, is dominant in the market for the high-speed printers that publishers and commercial printers favor, and it has a solid business in managing document flow for large corporations. \"Hewlett is on the right track, but they are definitely playing catch-up to us,\" said Ursula Burns, president of Xerox.\n\nKodak, meanwhile, has long offered customers the ability to create photo albums or otherwise organize their personal photos with professional templates, a service that Hewlett-Packard's Snapfish stresses. Kodak has also become a bigger player in high-speed printing and document management software.\n\n\"Forty percent of commercially printed documents are utilizing Kodak technology, be it our printing plates or printers or our Web-to-print software,\" said Jeffrey Hayzlett, Kodak's chief marketing officer. The growth of direct mail, he said, continues to create new markets for Kodak's high-speed printers. \"Print, in fact, has become the new interactive media,\" he said.\n\nIndustry specialists also say that Hewlett-Packard is late to many of the parties it now wants to attend. But they say the company's computer roots will give it a leg up.\n\n\"In a sense they are doing what Xerox and others have done for years,\" said Peter J. Grant, managing vice president of the research firm Gartner. \"But the computer side of the business lets them offer security programs and intellectual property that the others don't have.\""
