Printers also ship with marketing resources such as HP Print View software that allows customers to view elaborate print jobs in advance and estimate document costs to avoid the frustration of unanticipated costs and reprints.\n\nHP Color LaserJet CP1215: Priced at $299,(3) HP's lowest-ever priced desktop color laser printer also features new HP ColorSphere toner.\n\nHP In-house Marketing Starter Kit: Available with select HP printers, the kit includes a sampling of paper types commonly used for marketing collateral such as photo, glossy presentation and matte brochure papers, as well as a Business Marketing Design CD containing templates, images and coupons to provide a jumpstart in creating professional marketing collateral.\n\nHP 88 Officejet Brochure Value Pack: Specially priced pack includes HP 88 Officejet Color Ink Cartridges, HP Glossy Brochure and Flyer Paper and a Business Marketing Design CD containing everything needed to create professional quality marketing collateral in-house, including free professional design templates, photo images and exclusive offers from StockLayouts, iStockPhoto and Logoworks.\n\nHP Glossy Brochure and Flyer paper: Improved dry-time is designed to work with HP inkjet printers and enables easy, timely and inexpensive customization of marketing collateral.\n\nHP Presentation Covers: Durable and professional finishing that elegantly binds proposals and other collateral without the expense of using additional equipment.\n\nHP Officejet Printing System\n\nHP also unveiled a new branding strategy for its business ink portfolio. Now through fall 2008, packaging for all HP Officejet and Officejet Pro hardware and appropriate supplies will be identified with the \"HP Officejet Printing System\" name.(4)\n\nAll hardware and supplies packaging for the HP Officejet Printing System will feature a dark green bar across the top of the box to signify that the entire system - from hardware to ink and media - is designed together to provide small business customers with more affordable solutions to produce professional color documents at up to 50 percent lower cost per page than competing laser printers.(1)\n\nDriving productivity and managing the print environment\n\nNew productivity enhancing HP business inkjet and monochrome LaserJet multifunction printers include:\n\nHP Officejet J6400 All-in-One: Feature-rich printer/flatbed scanner/copier/fax with embedded wired and wireless networking(5) and automatic two-sided printing.\n\nHP Officejet J4580 All-in-One: Delivers high-quality color documents for less than laser printers when used with HP Officejet inks(6) and offers convenient printing, copying, faxing and flatbed scanning in one device.\n\nHP Officejet J3600 All-in-One: Dependable printing, copying, scanning and faxing.\n\nHP LaserJet M1319f MFP: HP's lowest-priced monochrome laser MFP with print, scan, copy and fax capabilities.\n\nHP LaserJet M1522 MFP series: Delivers higher-end MFP features at a low price, such as fast print, copy, scan and fax speeds, a 50-sheet automatic document feeder, flatbed color scanning and built-in networking.\n\nTo help small businesses better manage their print environments, HP Easy Printer Care software 2.5i monitors between two and 20 HP printers, both laser and ink, with a single tool. Now supporting most HP business inkjet devices,(7) the software makes it easier to maintain and quickly view the status of multiple devices, set up printer and supply alerts, generate basic usage reports and reorder supplies with the click of a button.\n\nSmall businesses can enjoy high-quality, highly reliable printing using HP technologies. In fact, a recent report from QualityLogic notes that HP LaserJet monochrome toner cartridges consistently outperform remanufactured cartridges.(8) According to the report, one in three of the remanufactured monochrome toner cartridges tested had some kind of reliability problem, while none of the tested HP cartridges experienced issues.\n\nSpecial offers\n\nHP is currently offering a variety of special rebates for its top-selling printers. Rebates and promotional dates will vary by printer model.\n\nAdditionally, Staples retail stores across the United States are making it easy for customers to recycle their old printers and purchase a new HP printer. Through this program, which runs from March 16 - May 3, 2008, customers can bring their old printer, regardless of brand, model and condition, to their local Staples store. Staples will recycle the printer for free and provide customers with a $50 discount toward the purchase of a new HP printer priced at $159 or above.(9) Visit www.staples.com to find a nearby Staples store.\n\nMore information\n\nFor pricing and availability, and additional details on today's announcement, including images, customer testimonial videos and product fact sheets about HP's new imaging and printing solutions for small and medium businesses, visit the online press kit at www.hp.com/go/ColorInTheOffice.\n\nAbout HP\n\nHP focuses on simplifying technology experiences for all of its customers - from individual consumers to the largest businesses.
