        "text": "This is an archived article that was published on sltrib.com in 2007, and information in the article may be outdated. It is provided only for personal research purposes and may not be reprinted.\n\nLogoworks made its mark last year when it landed a spot on Inc. magazine's ranking of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the country and designed a logo for an Office Depot car racing the NASCAR circuit.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Lindon-based company announced its most impressive accomplishment yet - acquisition by Hewlett Packard (H.P.). Financial terms of the deal, expected to be completed in H.P.'s third fiscal quarter, were not disclosed.\n\nH.P. plans to leverage Logoworks' technologies and services to provide small businesses with designs at a fraction of market cost, said Ben Nelson, general manager of H.P.'s destination Web services in San Francisco.\n\nLogoworks customers access the company's services via the Internet and can purchase design packages for logos, Web sites, business cards, stationary and other products. It has 25 in-house graphic designers and a network of 200 freelance designers, which the company said saves money in overhead.\n\nWith 120 full-time employees, Logoworks is scheduled to move this fall into new space at the North Pointe Business Park in American Fork.\n\n\"We will keep our name and nothing internally will change too much,\" said spokesman Jonathan Munk. \"We're hoping to be able to use some of the resources H.P. will provide for us. Obviously, they have a wonderful customer base.\"\n\n\"It's not really the size of the business - it's the capability,\" said Nelson. \"They've got the world's largest network of designers who are connected online. It affords high quality work for a low cost to customers. It was something that was irresistible to us.\"\n\nLike Snapfish, \"the strategy [for Logoworks] is clear,\" he said. \"We saw a terrific company that was a leader in its field and turbocharged its growth.\"\n\nGaining national attention last year, Logoworks ranked No. 66 on the Inc. 500 list, with three-year growth of 1,053 percent. Morgan Lynch and Joey Dempster founded the company in 2001.\n\nWith a portfolio that spans printing, personal computing, software, services and information technology (I.T.) infrastructure, H.P. is among the world's largest I.T. companies, with $94.1 billion in revenue for the four fiscal quarters that ended Jan. 31 of this year.\n\n* Founded in 2001, provides design packages for logos, Web sites, business cards, stationery and other products\n\n* Employs 120 full-time employees and an online network of freelance designers\n\n* Moving this fall from Lindon to American Fork\n\n* Over 45,000 customers, including subsidiaries of Disney, SeaWorld, and Microsoft"
