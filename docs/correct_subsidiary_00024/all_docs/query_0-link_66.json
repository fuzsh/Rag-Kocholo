        "text": "Over the past couple years, I've written about everything small business-related, from business owners who have been able to grow their business through access to capital, to changes at the Small Business Administration, and how small businesses can utilize social media. But behind every company, big or small, is a founding story and innovative, career-driven employees driving its vision. Going forward, from time-to-time my column will include interviews with up-and-coming executives and entrepreneurs about their leadership style, career trajectory, and what inspires them on a personal and professional level.\n\nI'm calling these interviews the American Dream Leadership Series.\n\nFor the first interview, I spoke with Clarke Miyasaki, executive vice president of business development and categories at the hottest sock company in the world, Stance. Founded in 2009, this premium sock company has taken the United States by storm with its bold patterns and ability to marry the action sports culture and fashion. With partnerships ranging from the NBA to Disney, Stance products can be found on celebrities like NBA star James Harden, 2012 and 2014 Masters Tournament champion Bubba Watson, and Grammy Award winning artist Rihanna, to name a few. Since opening its flagship brick-and-mortar shop in New York’s Soho in 2015, Stance has been rolling out retail locations all over the world. A Stance store opened in Salt Lake City, my hometown market, just this week.\n\nQ&A with Clarke Miyasaki\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were a kid, and how has reality matched your expectations?\n\nI really thought I was going to be a professional baseball player until I was about 13. In high school, I decided to be a teacher and a basketball coach, and was actually a secondary ed major in college before ultimately deciding on business before my junior year. So while I didn't get to be a pro athlete, I guess working with them has probably exceeded any expectation I ever had.\n\nWhat has been the greatest contributing factor to your success?\n\nLUCK! Success is a big dose of luck mixed with hard work and a little talent.\n\nHow would you describe your personal leadership style?\n\nChill. I'm an easy-going person in general and don't get too worked up about really anything. I think I've always done a good job at hiring people who I trust to get the job done and they know when to run on their own or come to me for help.\n\nWhat leader in business do you most admire and try to emulate?\n\nI’ve worked with several great leaders so this isn't a direct answer, but I'll tell you a story I've never told anybody because Morgan made me promise to never tell it (sorry Morgan, I think there is a 10-year statute of limitations on keeping promises).\n\nA few months after Logoworks was acquired by Hewlett-Packard, Morgan Lynch (founder) pulled me into his office and handed me a check from his personal bank account. He then went on to tell me how thankful and appreciative he was of my work at Logoworks and that he wanted to share more from the exit than I had received from my stock options.\n\nThe money itself was an incredible gesture, one that I'll always be thankful for, but the true lesson I learned from that experience was the value of gratitude. He didn't have to do anything like that but he was genuinely thankful for the nights I spent away from my family traveling and the general blood, sweat and tears you put into an early stage start-up. This made an incredible impact on the way I look at the world and taught me to be more grateful for everybody I get to interact with.\n\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned in your career that could apply to folks just getting started?\n\nI think the best advice I can give goes off my \"luck\" statement above. You never know when your career break is going to happen or who it is going to come from, so treat everyone with love and respect and work your butt off every chance you get.\n\nWhich small business do you frequent the most?\n\nDoes Chick-fil-A count as a small business?\n\nWhen you think about the next two years, what keeps you up at night?\n\nEasy answer...my daughter going to high school! But from a business perspective, I'm always thinking about the best way to allocate my time and resources. As with most people, I have way too much to do at work, so deciding what will make the biggest impact on the Stance business is always a battle. Outside of Stance, there are so many great investment opportunities or potential board positions out there and I always want to do more than I can handle.\n\nWhat book has been most influential in your life?\n\nThe Book of Mormon and the Bible. Having a strong religious base has really helped me keep a good life perspective, especially in the crazy celebrity and athlete world I sometimes navigate. When things get stressful, I try to ask myself, \"Is this going to matter in a couple of days? How about a couple of weeks or months? How about a couple of years or decades?\" The answer is almost always “NO,” so I am able to put whatever tough situation I encounter into its proper perspective and handle it better.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to go into start-ups?\n\nI was an intern at Freeport.com between my junior and senior years at BYU and fell in love with everything about the startup culture and decided that is what I wanted to do. For some reason, I thought I needed to go work for a big company and get an MBA so I would have permission to do a start-up. My first job out of school was with Ford Motor Company and I was planning to get my MBA at the University of Michigan but I left Ford about a year into my job to join vSpring Capital (venture fund in Salt Lake City) as an analyst and it has been start-ups ever since.\n\nWhat is the best and worst part about doing start-ups?\n\nThe best part, by far, is the people you get to work with during the journey of growing a company and all the fun experiences you have along the way. Having worked in several different businesses and invested in many more, my theory is that all businesses suck in some way. Enterprise sales sucks because the sales cycle is too long. Small business software sucks because it is hard to scale. Consumer products companies suck because the retail environment is tough. BUT, somehow you navigate through the issues and there is a unique satisfaction when a business has a successful exit because it is incredibly hard to build a successful venture.\n\nWhat is your “can’t miss” (podcast, show, publication, website)?\n\nRight now it is anything NBA related...Zach Lowe and Bill Simmons are my favorite NBA related podcasts.\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you ever got?\n\nA+ execution and B+ strategy is much better than taking forever to make a decision on an A+ strategy. No matter how much analysis you do, it is hard to definitively know what path to take, so be smart about the analysis, make a decision and get to work on the execution. Indecision is one of my biggest pet peeves.\n\nWhat’s a piece of advice that turned out NOT to be helpful?\n\nGood things come to those who wait. Definitely not true. A better saying would be good things come to those who hustle.\n\nWhat do you love about where you live?\n\nOh man, don't get me started on San Clemente, California. Sunshine and 70 degree weather next to great beaches is really tough to beat. If you can't be happy here, you're probably not going to find happiness anywhere.\n\nWhat’s your favorite breakfast?\n\nAnything that is really a dessert disguised as breakfast. I have the palette of a six-year-old boy.\n\nHow do you balance your demanding schedule at work with a family?\n\nThat's a great question. My best answer is to marry a rockstar spouse who can handle somebody who works more than they should.\n\nWhat activity or activities (outside of work) do you always make time for? Why?\n\nObviously family activities, especially kids’ sports. I love Saturdays filled with kids’ games back-to-back. I try to play as much golf as possible and get out early to play nine holes before work with our CFO a couple of times a week. I still think I can hoop even though I fear the end is near. We play a couple of times a week at the Stance office."
