Sits 8 Bytes - September 1986 5 MICRONEWS English spelling from new BOS/Speller A new spelling checker for the BOS/Writer VI. 3 has been released, based around a disk copy of the 160,000 word Concise Oxford Dictio- nary under licence from Oxford Uni- versity Press. BOS/Speller is thus in- tended to have the advantage for New Zealand users of preferring En- glish to American spelling. In addition to the main vocubulary, up to nine different user glossaries, each containing up to 2,000 words, may be defined. These might contain company, product and personnel names or specialist terms which are correct but not yet found in the Con- cise Oxford Dictionary, and can also define particular words as 'question- able', or found in the main dictionary but probably errors if they occur in the user company's documents. Under the heading \"Eliminates typos and misspellings\", BOS says BOS/Speller \"scans a document and notes as possible errors words which are not found either in the dictionary or in a user-defined glossary, re- peated words not seperated (sic) by a punctuation mark (eg 'the the'), and words defined as questionable in the current glossary.\" More power Prices down IBM has announced new prices for the lower end of its computer range; however, it's difficult to compare these with previous prices as the pro- ducts are not formatted in quite the same way. The new prices include packages formatted with more memory and more power. For example, the PCXT, formerly 10Mb and 256Kb RAM, cost- ing $8331, now sells at $6533 and in- corporates 20Mb fixed disk and 512 Kb RAM. All up, with a monochrome display, printer and display adapter and DOS 3.2 the and new XT will re- tail at $7,953. The new PCAT with 30Mb fixed disk, the 8 MHz 80286 microproces- sor, 1.2Mb diskette drive, new 101 keyboard and 512Kb RAM memory will retail at $11,512. The old, 20Mb version was selling at $12,339. The PC JX, including a colour monitor, full function keyboard and DOS2.1 now retails at $3,659 and the new portable, the PC Convertible will retail at $4,974. The PCG system with one 5V2 inch drive and 256Kb memory, a monoc- hrome display, printer and display adapter, DOS 3.2 will sell at $5382. AT power in a portable? When is a laptop not a laptop? Toshiba's new compact personal computers released last month pose the question. Both the 256Kb T2100 and related 640Kb T3100 (expanda- ble to 640Kb and 2.6Mb respectively) are described by Toshiba as laptops, but their reliance on mains power separate them from the machines normally associated with complete portability.

Its 80286 processor and switchable 8MHz/4MHz speed make it a full AT computer, according to Toshiba. A full review will appear next month. DSIR to hold CAD seminar A one-day seminar is planned by DSIR's Auckland Industrial Develop- ment Division for November 5, aimed at helping users achieve better pro- ductivity of their personal computer- based CAD systems. To be held at the Sheraton Hotel, Auckland, the seminar is aimed at both current users and potential pur- chasers of PC CAD systems. Speakers will include CAD specialists from technical institutes, DSIR and private industry, and will include Albert Sedlmayer, the Auckland naval ar- chitect who designed the tourist catamaran Pride of Auckland using a CAD system. Clone prices down in UK A cheap IBM PC compatible is now available in the UK for less than £500. The new Osborne Genius from Future Managiement, with 256Kb memory, one floppy disc drive, AT-style keyboard, monochrome monitor and DOS costs £495 plus VAT. However, the best value among the PC clones is said to be the Bondwell 34, with two floppies and 640Kb for £599 plus VAT, and the Bondwell 36XT adds a 20Mb hard disc drive for a total of £999 plus VAT. Further price falls are expected, and PC clones are already selling for under $500 in the USA. IBM actively fights counterfeiting In a joint operation with local police, IBM recently uncovered a large counterfeiting case in Taiwan. At the Ling Yih plant 170 sets of el- legedly counterfeited IBM PC-AT cabinets were discovered, with a further 600 sets found in a shipping container just about to leave the fac- tory. All were taken to the IBM warehouse in Yang Mei to await court action. Meanwhile, IBM New Zealand has announced that Computer Broking Services Ltd has agreed not to do any acts or sell any products which in- fringe IBM's copyrights in the IBM BIOS and MEGA \"BIOS chips, or copyrights in the design of its PC/XT computer cabinet. Computer Broking Services has acknowledged that it may have infringed IBM's copyright in both the basic input/output system chip and the design of the cabinet through the sale of its unbranded XT PC. \"It is our intention to protect IBM's Data Transfer with X A inch tape reliability Thorn EMI present the economical Datatech 9800 W tape data transfer and backup system to provide reliable data interchange between the smallest micro and the largest mainframe.

OLIVETTI throws its AT in the ring out, such as easy access to all switches, adequate cable lengths, ventilation ports at the front and back of the system unit (allowing things to be stacked against the sides) and decent sized shift key, all petty an- noyances when neglected. Another point in the Olivetti's favour is the small footprint of the system unit, al- though vertically it appears bulky. On running up the system, my first and lasting impression was speed. Having used an 8088-Z 8.OMH2 sys- tem running KMAN DBMS applica- tions over the last six months, I was interested to see how/ the M28 would cope with the requirement for mem- ory intensive overlaying and a heavy demand on disk access. It fairly flew through the code. As an example, a sorting routine taking some 16 seconds to run on the 8088-Z based XT was completed in under 10 seconds on the Olivetti. This measure of time saving was evident in all ap- plications that I tried. The review model was supplied with 512Kb of RAM, which is expand- able to 1Mb on the motherboard. The base system comes with a single 1 .2Mb floppy disk and 20Mb slim line integrated hard disk. The configura- tion can be enhanced by adding an integrated 20Mb streaming tape unit, while the hard disk capacity can be expanded to 40 or 70 Mb. The product literature boasts seven 16 bit and 8/ by Rob Eckford Despite the entrenchment of the Intel 8088 CPU in the New Zea- land personal computer scene, a new standard has emerged to challenge that set by the now over three-year- old IBM PC. The new trend, pioneered by the IBM PC AT, has raised consumer expectation to re- quire faster processing and large amounts of RAM with which to run complex management applications. Manufacturers have not been slow to rise to the new expectation, with 17 distributors in New Zealand offer- ing on an average three different models in the Intel 80286-based range. Number 18 has now entered the \"AT race\" with the Olivetti M28. At what odds? The profile of the typical PC AT across the whole market seems to be an 80286-based machine with 512Kb RAM, a single 1200Kb floppy disk and a 20Mb hard disk. Obviously many different tunes are played on the AT fiddle, hence the prices range from around $8,000 to over $23,000 for 8 Bits & Bytes - September 1 98G single user microcomputers that, on the surface, appear to do the same job. The trend-setter IBM PC AT+ sits in the lower end of the middle bracket at about $13,000. To succeed in this market, a manufacturer would have to be seen to be offering something more in performance for something less than average price. After my two-week assessment of the Olivetti M28, I feel that this has been achieved. First impressions on opening the cartons (ex-factory) wore favourable.\" a very well-packaged product, backed up by professional looking manuals, that took only 10 minutes to have up and running. At this stage I would also like to mention the very able and friendly assistance with var- ious queries in the period of assess- ment from Olivetti manager David Frood. With such good local backing for this product, the future looks good for user support. Overall, the Olivetti gives the im- pression that a great deal of user con- sideration has been put into the de- sign. Little points have been thought 16 bit expansion slots, but on inspec- tion, only five are free in the standard configuration. This is somewhat less than the IBM standard. The casing of the system unit can be easily removed by loosening three nuts. There is plenty ot space within the cabinet and the overall impres- sion is of solid engineering. For such an obviously robust chassis, the sys- tem unit is remarkably light in weight. The keyboard is also lightweight and has a good feel, although the non- standard positioning of the Escape and Alt keys left me a little puzzled to begin with. A nice touch was the inclusion of two neat little cards with the documentation containing the video editor commands for the func- tion keys, but I could not find any- where convenient on the keyboard to place them. Over the two weeks I used the Olivetti M28, 1 ran every piece of IBM PC software that I could lay my hands on, including PC tools, Norton Utilities, Flight Simulator, Gatto, Wordstar and KMAN.

Overall I would have to give the machine a compatibility rating of 99.9%. The current price of the Olivetti M28 in the configuration as tested is $13,048. However, David Frood pointed out that marketing strategy would be to offer the base machine at some 10 per cent less than the IBM entry equivalent. This policy has af- fected the price of the M24 which is coming from the new South Korean factory, but the M28 is still sourced from Italy and Olivetti would like to see the product settle for a while be- fore making final adjustments. Still, the Olivetti M28 should be a very viable offering in today's market, and for those who have a requirement for an easily expandable, solidly en- gineered and powerful microcompu- ter. I can really recommend this offer- ing.

SEE US AT STAND NO. 44-46 14 Bits & Byios - September 1 986 PIPS 1 1 1 Almost without exception, the small business computer users that I have spoken to are unsatisfied with the business administration programs they are operating. These comments have referred to off-the- shelf software, to specially modified off-the-shelf software ana, in some cases, to tailor-made packages. Those who feel their software \"does the job\" with regard to a specific task can see that their com pany is largely under-computerised as programs they really want are not available, and the cost and communi- cation problems associated with com- missioning tailor-made packages are to be avoided. One of the reasons for this dissatis- faction is that the modem business practice is in a continuous state of evolution. How anyone administers a business today differs to the methods of three years ago, and will obviously differ from those of even a year's time. Regulations constantly change. GST needs to be accommodated. The line of business has expanded or com- pletely altered. The software they have is inflexible and cannot keep pace with change. It satisfied a period of their evolutionary process, but the passing of time has made it redundant. I became aware of this dilemma not long after I formed my own practice as a building design consultant, and had to make decisions with regard to organising the company's adminis- tration. The solution I chose was to become computer independent, my own programmer. Basic, Cobol or Pascal was out as I could not afford the time required to master any of these and still carry on with business. I selected PIPS III, Sord Computer's Plan Information Processing System, and almost three years down the line 1 con say I am stiU excited about it. For a start, it does not need pro- gramming. From the very day I unpacked it I was able to make my own tables of data, perform calcula- — FIGURE 1 The business user's dilemma by John Highland tions in them, and print them out. Within a week I was sorting data over several pages, searching for data based on my own conditions and doing calculations transversing numerous tables on the disk. For the first year I needed nothing more than to utilise PIPS HI in this manner. To explain, PIPS DI is a collection of programs that carry out specific busi- ness activities and are put into opera- tion by issuing simple commands. These cover basic tasks of making, manipulating and storing tables; to more high-powered tasks such as sorting, searching (with up to 20 con- ditions) and processing data; to specialised tasks such as translating data to graphs, converting tables to invoices, summary pages of reports and letters; and of course transmit- ting and receiving data via telephone modems or closed circuit. As the commands are flexible and have a wide application, anyone can computerise his or her paperwork through a combination of these easy to learn comands. The computer is operated by simple dialogue. The •user gives a command, the computer asks for specifics and then executes this task. The number of PIPS m com- mands has been kept down to about 50, a number small enough to remember with no problem. How- ever, each command represents a unit of work which, when put together with other commands, can take care of all daily business routines. The PIPS III calculation commands are simple and powerful. It can, for example, find the maximum or minimum value of a string of num- bers, or calculate its average, or even calculate sub-totals within the string. The string of numbers need not even be on one page. Three-dimensional calculations over several pages are possible. <T0DATE> Gil3iiCALyC;Dl.l;F )i P;l,12jEADI)(C2)=C2;llM20,2=r120,2iADD[R18,22 l 23 =«22,2;ESC;Pil5;GR;l;2;Y;«;5l2,000,000;0;N;SBjNFjNfl2,70,/4;DC;i;CAfD!l5;3;-l j-2;liNjIC;Yj3;2;ESCjP;15jL;B;ST0P Data can be sorted, combined, deleted, updated, or modified with a single PIPS command. Further, these commands can be executed one after another in succession to carry out complicated operations. Data input once can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, the sales invoice commonly used in offices can be displayed on the screen. Using this as a guide, the operator can enter information under the appropriate headings. As the operator is typing, this data is stored in external memory. The data can then be printed onto the actual sales invoice and sent to the customer. The data can be retrieved again and used for making a record of the total number of sales to a particular com- pany or for monthly billings, or other tasks. The beauty of PIPS III is that the operation carried out can produce an endless variety of results and opera- tions, quickly and effectively. PIPS III is an open structured program sys- tem that gives anyone the flexibility and freedom to computerise to a specific work pattern. Further, a single command controls data reception and transfer, thereby allowing users in different offices to share the same data. Automatic processing Truly exciting is the ability to auto- mate repetitive operations. In PIPS HI, each command carries a unique func- tion. Using them one by one can take care of simple tasks, but stringing them together in different combina- tions can take care of extremely com- plex business operations. The stan- dard programming controls of VARI- ABLES, FOR... NEXT loops, IF... THEN... ELSE decisions, GO TO and GO SUB redirections are just a few of the tools available to convert your PIPS III operations into a fully auto- mated tailor-made program. Herein lies the beauty. A manager can prepare the procedures and oper- ations, which can from then on be car- ried out by even a complete computer novice. Some of the programmes that I have prepared are: 1. Invoicing: Answering screen prompts, a detailed time sheet is pre- pared and printed out. This is then automatically converted into a letter style invoice complete with envelope. Further, a yearly register of invoices is updated to keep track of debtors and payments, complete with run- ning totals and monthly subtotals. Having investigated GST, I will soon expand this program to accommo- date it. 2. Company Accounts (also private): Answering screen prompts, all debits and credits are entered and coded. The data can therefore be sorted and totalled up both in a monthly fashion Bits & Bytes - September 1986 1 5 and as a summary of codes. I can, for example, thereby see how much insurance I have paid out in the last year, and the amount, date and cheque number of a specific payment in question. A summary page is pro- duced, showing cash flows and spending within each code. 3. Bracing calculations to NZS 3604: Copious data from tables and variable options are all processed by the com- puter. 4. A budget estimate program for comercial and residential projects. 5. A detailed quantities schedule for residential buildings program with a library of items and costs stored on disk. 6. A landscape design program with detailed characteristics and environ- mental requirements of over 500 NZ plants stored on disk, processed by computer to locate those that satisfy the user's specifications. 7. A typing tutor program to train the operator to touch-type. 8. A year planner diary: I see my war- rant of fitness is due next week. PIPS III provides two ways to write an Automatic Program. The first is to carry out each step of the process on the screen and as you go, ask the computer to automatically record every step you take. In this manner, you do the job manually the first time, thereafter automatically. The second method is to write out the program line by line. Shown in Figure 1 is an Automatic Program with side comments as to what each unit of data is doing. A sample data page it will process is shown as Figure 2, and the results in Figure 3. This program uses very few of the special instructions available to a PIPS user and is intended only to illustrate what a PIPS III Automatic Program looks like. The task is to collate the 12 monthly income statements and produce a \"Year to Date\" statement for a direc- tors' meeting in 30 minutes' time. As this has not been required before, you prepare a blank statement page which you file on page 13 of the disk. You then write the new Automatic Program which follows. This program can be explained as follows : <TODATE> Program title G;13 Get the blank Year to Date state- ment filed on page 13 of the disk. CAL/C;D1.1;F, Switch on calculation mode, show numeric answeis to decimal places, rounded up, and with commas between every 3 digits. P;1.12 Designate pages 1 to 12, the pages which contain the data you wish to process. EADD(C2) = C2 Add each row of column 2 across the 12 pages and put the answer in column 2 on the screen. #1M20,2 = M20,2 Go to page 1 and transcribe the year's starting balance on to the screen. ADD|R18,21,2) = M22.2;ESC On the screen page, calculate the closing balance P;15 Put your new summary page onto page 15 of the disk. — FIGURE 2 <1NC0NE STATEN£NT-AF-RIL> (19. 4.84) F25 \"•SALES 4 OTHER INCOME\"* NET SALES INTEREST FROM SECURITIES, DIVIDENDS TOTAL SALES 4 OTHER INCOME •\"COSTS 4 EXPENSES\"!

Mitsui Compu- ter Systems is the NZ distributor, part of the worldwide Mitsui & Co Ltd which recorded total trading transac- tions of over $NZ129 billion for the fis- cal 1985 year and is found in over 88 nations. Sord Japan has advised that PIPS IV-G will be released soon and a version to run on the IBM PC AT will be released later. Some further queries may be briefly addressed: Format of data produced: PIPS is a structured program which processes standardised ASCI II text files. These files can be read or written to by any user utility, not just DBASIC, and can therefore be interfaced with user applications and programmes. Back up: The manuals in them- selves are excellent training guides and there are one-day training courses available for those who so desire. Programming complexity/flexibil- ity: It took me a couple of days to per- fect program no. 1. One PIPS user found that he produced with seven lines of programming in PIPS what had taken 163 lines of BASIC to pro- duce. With PIPS you are stringing together ready-made programs to perform units of tasks. The hard work has already been done, and each of these programs allows you, through specification options, to achieve a wide range of flexibility in operation. Other PIPS III programmers may wish to communicate and possibly meet for discussions. At present I am completing a desk-side companion which will tap the experience of many different users and plan to make it available to the PIPS III programmer.

ITT Bits & Bytes - September 1 986 17 MICROSATWORK PC AT CREATING THE STANDARD You don't need a crystal ball to rec- ognise that the AT will rapidly be- come the PC standard with its in- creased processing speed, (Intel's 80286 chip) and vastly extended hard disk and floppy disk capacities. Now that we have the AT we also have a box that runs Unix, or Xenix if you prefer. What we are all awaiting with bated breath is the conversion of all the popular productivity tools to run under Xenix with two operators using Lotus and a third into Dbase in. Naturally the AT will need at least 1Mb of memory. With the availability of turbo-cards, hard disks on additional boards that slip into your expansion slots, it is possible to supercharge your old PC XT (8088 chip) into a processor that resembles an AT for performance., With the price of some ATs right now, in particular the Televideo CAT and the shortly to be released Wyse AT, we are seeing a dramatic in- crease in terms of processing power per dollar of investment. An AT for under $7,800, and it was only three years ago the IBM XT was nearly $15,000 and we have been running a 15 per cent inflation rate! We suggest the 8088 compatible will be obsolete within nine months, at which time we should see a range of locally developed Unix-based software on the market to give the AT a greater thrust. Charter — a sequel Since our article last month we have had contact with Chevron Software (not Industries) who has ac- quired the Charter source code. We do apologise for the inference in the opening paragraph last month that Chevron was not capable of pro- viding the on-going promotion and support of the Charter series. David Harris, managing director of Chevron, advises me that he has been support- ing more than 70 Charter sites for the past two and a half years and knows the product intimately. Chevron's in- tentions are to develop Charter along the lines that the users and the mar- ketplace demand, which will involve building new features into an already feature-rich product. There is even talk of a multi-user version! Chevron, we wish you well. Unhappy users survey MicroLab has thought for some time that we should address the mar- ketplace to determine who the dis- 18 Bits & Bytes - September 1986 satisfied users are and assist them to get a better return on their invest- ment. We would estimate that almost 60 per cent of microcomputers in small to medium size businesses are not working to capacity. It may be the failing of the software, it may be the users' unwillingness to get to grips with the new technology, or it may be the constant change of staff in the users' offices. Whatever... there is scope on most sites to dramatically improve the performance of their computer. With MicroLab's position in the market we would like to think we have a good working relationship with most suppliers, to the extent we can resolve any vendor-related prob- lems on your site. Systems 86 Whoever said there is a trend away from trade shows must have put a notch in his belt after this year's Sys- tems Show. The droves that visited the showgrounds in the early 1980s really are now only a memory. Although attendance was down, some of the hardware vendors were very positive and confident that they would turn enquiries into sales. We are told genuine buyers as a percen- tage of total visitors gets better by the year. It is a substantial investment in both dollars and time exhibiting at the show, and we wonder if it's just a case of flying the flag or whether the marketing dollars could not be spent more wisely. From the businessperson's point of view the show is not the place to discuss one's business affairs in detail. It is gener- ally cold and impersonal, not the at- mosphere to be wooed into parting with thousands of dollars. At the Systems Show it is a notice- able trend that there are fewer of the recognised computer hardware and software suppliers, and an influx of vendors on the periphery. There are simpler and more convenient ways to appraise a range of hardware and software. We are not offering any prizes for correctly guessing howl I Wake up, all you programmers ! ! They say the computer industry is progressive and innovative. Certainly we see plenty of exciting new hardware products on the pages of Bits & Bytes with new graphics capabilities and faster processors. But who uses them? Whose account- ing system uses sound effectively — or colour? Who uses mice and drop down windows? Let's face it — probably one half or more of the time we spend in front of our PCs is doing pretty routine stuff — running our business's accounting systems.

(much!) We mentioned last month that in many ways Charter had set the stan- dard for New Zealand accounting software. The trouble is - no one has bothered to improve on these stan- dards since! Sybiz challenged our traditional thinking with its function key opera- tion and function/ledger rather than module/function approach. Sybiz Plus offers us a calculator and enquiry facilities on hand at any point in the program. Even Cashlink offers us a Wordstar-like word processor in- cluded in the suite of programs. But are these really innovations — or just clever marketing? And why haven't the other popular accounting pac- kages met the challenge? Some programmers say keep it sim- ple - just give the user the bare minimum and make it quick to use. After all, who wants to spend longer on bookwork than he needs to? We agree with the sontiment - but not with the approach. Running a business is a complex, highly inter-re- lated operation. You often need to do some rather complicated things, sometimes at once, such as taking a customer phone enquiry while you're working out how well the new sales rep did last month, while your secret- ary hovers over your shoulder waiting for you to give her your notes for new price lists you were due to send out yesterday. Phew! The real world is like that. WE all chew gum and walk at »the same time, so why don't software developers remove their blinkers and design products that ac- tually work the way we do - not the way computers do? The recently released DSIR study of the New Zealand software industry identified marketing skills as a weak- ness. A key aspect of marketing is understanding what the customer (the software user) wants. We're amazed how many software com- panies don't really know. Okay - what sorts of things should, or could, software developers be giv- ing us that would make life easier? How about something easy to start — context sensitive help throughout. If CBA can do it, so can the rest of you - and it's far cheaper than print- ing a manual!! How about an on-screen calculator available anytime? And a diary. We could always buy \"Sidekick\", but it would be nice to have all our manage- ment tools in one package. And how about split screens or windows? We want to be able to jump to any part of our system from anywhere else, without all this time consuming quitting and plodding through menus. And so on we go - the possibilities are limited only by the imagination. Many of New Zealand's software de- velopers have come from big systems backgrounds, or have trained in the structured environments of COBOL and the like. The systems they have grown up with were old, slow and cumbersome. But today's businesses are rising PCs that can play music, display colour, and perform all sorts of tricks. The hardware's much more powerful, the scope for imaginative programming is much greater. So how about it guys!

Bits & Bytes - September 1986 21 The new Sperry personal com- puter is here, an IBM PC AT com- patible with a lot of room to grow as you grow. The PC IT computer sys- tem comes in the now familiar three- unit set comprising the main compu- ter itself, a color monitor and a keyboard. The reviewed system has a voice kontroller (yes, that's how it's spelled) interface. The main unit comes in a giant box by PC standards, almost filling all the boot space in my family car. It is also very heavy, all 22 kg of it. The system unit is physically 17.4 cm high, 58 cm wide and 42.7 cm deep. The reviewed system is an en- hanced unit with 1 Mb of RAM (ran- dom access read/write memory), high resolution color monitor and a profes- sional keyboard. Extras fitted include a 60 Mb tape backup unit and the voice kontroller interface at a cost of approximately $5000 and $3000 re- spectively. The price of the rest of the system is $18,616 including tax. PC IT is based on the Intel 80286 microprocessor with a built-in clock. Processor speeds of 6, 7,16 or 8 MHz are dip switch selectable, but the switch is located inside the main sys- tem unit on the motherboard and it took me several minutes to change the speed. Two asynchronous and one parallel interface come as standard along with a very clever 1.2 Mb 5V4 inch floppy diskette drive, a 44.6 Mb hard disk and controller, and eight expan- sion slots. The floppy disk controller recog- nises the format of whatever Prefor- matted floppy that's inserted into the drive. For example, a 360 Kb floppy formatted on an IBM PC compatible machine will be written onto by the PC IT using the same 360 Kb format. It will write in 1.2 Mb format if you use a 1 .2 Mb floppy, and of course it formats blank floppies at 1.2 Mb. So this is one truly compatible IBM PC/XT/ AT compatible floppy drive, a very useful feature to consider if you have a whole lot of them around. No problems whatsoever will be encoun- tered with data incompatibility, and while many other 80286 based com- puter systems have 1.2 Mb diskette drives, they can only read in 360 Kb format and not write. This is the first that I have come across that reads and writes in both formats. Additional memory can be added to the PC IT. A maximum of 4 Mb using 2 expansion boards (and slots) will be required. A socket is provided for the 80287 numeric math coproces- sor, giving improved performance for floating point, extended integer and BCD data type handling with trans- cendental operations. Basically it en- hances computation bounded appli- cations, for example large spread- sheets or scientific programs. An additional diskette drive or a fixed disk could be installed into the main unit, only one additional in the review system with the other being taken up by the tape backup unit. Without it, the system would be able to support two floppy diskette and two hard disk drives. Thus a more logical choice would be the installa- tion of hard disk 'D' because there is not much need for a second floppy drive. What about copying floppies? you might ask. That would be just as easily accomplished by first copying down to hard disk and then backing to another floppy. With two hard disks installed, you would have 90 Mb of storage. What a set-up that would be! Other options include a floor stand with bottom cover to allow the place- ment of the system unit on the floor in a vertical orientation. The footprint of the main unit in a horizontal posi- tion is almost 1 Va times that of an AT and twice that of an XT, so anybody with desk top space at a premium should check this option out more seriously. Multi terminal adaptor takes up one slot and it allows connection of up to four asynch. devices for use in a multi-user system, for example in the optional UNIX system setup. (Sperry calls it XENIX). The adapter has four 9-pin connectors and all you need are the terminal cables and dumb terminals. Thus with the maximum of two multi terminal adap- ter installed, the PC IT would be able to support up to nine users simultane- ously, all able to have access to cent- rally stored applications, data, prog- rams, utilities and peripherals. The high resolution 12 inch colour display unit has a 640 by 400 dot screen resolution and 192 Kb display buffer. It can display 256 colours when in 320 by 200 and 320 by 400 modes (medium resolution). In the high resolution 640 by 400 or 640 by 200 modes, 16 colours are available, when even the text and numbers ap- pear sharp and clear enough to be intermixed with graphics. Thus long hours on the word processor in colour should be no problem. One small irritating thing about this colour monitor (and a lot of others as well) is the 'ghosting' when test is scrolled or screens refreshed. This is more apparent in a slightly dimmed room, and in a brightly lit office envi- ronment, it is acceptable. The reviewed monitor did not come with the proper power cord to con- nect it to the switched power outlet for the monitor on the main system unit. A separate plug connected the monitor to the wall outlet, with the need to power the monitor on and off manually. This is rather importiant in the interest of power economy and prolonging the life of the display unit, and I unknowingly left the monitor on one night after shutting down the main unit. 22 Bits & Bytes - September 1 986 Sperry PC/IT The keyboard There is a choice of three different keyboards for the PC IT, namely the standard, advanced and professional. The professional keyboard of the re- view system has 100 keys including 10 function keys in 2 groups of five, horizontally spread across the top of the keyboard, separate cursor and numeric keypad, and a new pause and system reset keys. The reset button on the main sys- tem unit is well hidden in a very tiny recess in the front and under the power on light, able to be activated with a blunt object such as a pen or pencil to poke into it. There is another button on the keyboard. Both CTRL RESET keys need to be hit to reset the system rather than just the RESET key alone. Good thinking Sperry. Of course, with other keyboards, you can do a reset with CTRL ALT DEL keys, and the PAUSE key likewise replaces a two-key com- mand common on other keyboards. It is used to suspend a task, for example temporarily stop printing. LED indicators are found onthe LOCK, NUM LOCK, CURSOR PAD keys. Another nice touch is the inclusion of homing locators on the 'F', 'J' and '5' keys, with slightly raised '— ' on the faces for quick indications of where your fingers are. This is a heavyweight class keyboard, check- ing in at 2.68 kg. Overall I find the keyboard easy enough to use. The keys feel positive although they do not offer enough re- sistance to my liking. Voice kontroller If you have been waiting to com- municate with your computer system using only your voice (just like in the movies), then Sperry has come up with this interface that will do the trick for you. A combination of speaker and mic- rophone with attachment cable is supplied with the PC IT voice kontrol- ler card. Incidentally, this card also fits into your regular PC and compat- ibles. The unit is approximately 12 cm square and draws power from the PC itself. The microphone jack and speaker jack use the standard 1.27 cm phone plug and 0.317 cm mini plug respectively. This interface provides you with a natural way to talk, literally speaking, with your computer system. It thus enables the users to speak in their own languages, however varied, in a natural conversational flow. The PC voice kontroller recognises previ- ously trained words from a user's lib- rary of word templates. Up to 10 of 64 voice commands for each applica- tion can be programmed, and each voice command can replace up to 30 keyboard character sequence. Even when using the voice kontroller for input, the keyboard is completely ac- tive and can be used in conjunction, and another feature permits replay of the pre-recorded voice messages for operator prompting, feedback and messages. If you do not like listening to your voice, try programming with someone else's. Great fun! Easy train software (KEYMAKER) is provided with the voice kontroller card, menu driven to provide a simple and quick way to help train the PC IT to recognise your voice commands. The procedure is to type your phrase (command) onto the template and then speak naturally into the mic- rophone. Repeat the spoken phrase, and type in the key sequences that you want replaced by the phrase. For example, you can say, \"Start Lotus 123,\" which replaces keystrokes \"CD/123 RETURN, RETURN.\" Up to 30 keystrokes can be stored for a single voice command, a real joy in repetitive work. I tried out my own voice-controlled command exercise with Lotus 123. I could do everything without the use of my hands. \"Start 123,\" \"Monthly Forecast,\" \"continue,\" \"Annual Sales,\" \"Sort,\" \"Give me a Status Re- port,\" \"Who are the problem ac- counts,\" \"Quit\" I encountered no problem with Lotus 123. In fact, Sperry claims that the voice kontroller could work with all MS DOS 2.11 and higher applica- tion programs, for example Sym- phony, Wordstar, etc. As you can see, a considerable sav- ing in keystrokes can be achieved. However, this is only worthwhile when you have repeated tasks. Likely users could be top-level management who could be suffering from keyboard-phobia or handicapped people where the use of hands or sight is limited. For remote operators, for example, the computer with voice kontroller could be located in head office and still be operated from other rooms, the factory floor or warehouses using, say, two-way radio or telephone. Tests were carried out on the PC IT, IBM PC AT and COMPAQ II port- able. On the Sperry PC IT, the CPU (Central Processor Unit) clock was set to 7.16 MHz with zero wait states for memory access. The IBM PC AT was running at 6 MHz and had a 80287 math coprocessor fitted. The COM- PAQ was an AT compatible running at 8 MHz. The spreadsheet was from Lotus Symphony with 30 columns by 100 rows. Most of the common arithmetic functions were used in the recalcula- tion, including multiplication, addi- tion, subtraction, division, summa- tion, maximum, minimum, and var- iance. The 'load' and 'save' were to floppy disk (for tansportability) in- stead of hard disk. In the BASIC math calculation program, the time taken was for an iteration of 5000 division, multiplica- tion, addition and subtraction opera- tions using BASIC interpreter. In the case of sieve, the time taken was for one iteration of the sieve of Eratos- thenes' prime number benchmark program. The program is written in BASIC and generates 1899 primes. The performance index is relative to IBM PC and derived from running one of Norton's utilities: PC/IT PC/AT COMPAQ mm sec mm sec min sec Booting up 15 29 27 Tape backup (2 1 Mb) 9 40 — — BASIC Math 13 24 14 Sieve 41 1 05 45 Performance Index 8 3 5 7 7 7 Spreadsheet: Load 38 38 48 Save 1 13 1 15 49 Recalculate 15 15 14 Bits & Bytes - September 1 986 23 Sperry PC/IT Conclusion I have not many complaints about the PC IT other than its size and weight, and there is no tilt and swivel base for the monitor. The asking price is high, but it has the performance to match. Overall I found it a very impressive piece of machinery. It should be one of the major contenders in complex environments such as LAN (Local Area Network), host computer com- munications, or multi-user systems. It has lots of memory and a 44.5 Mb hard disk, while the tape backup is a very handy option. The inclusion of the voice kontioller would be a wel- come option for a particular section of the market, but the most useful component for me is the intelligent diskette drive. The PC IT is highly recommended.

Minidisk By consistently producing better tech- nology, Verbatim rapidly became the world's biggest seller of floppy disks. These days, new Verbatim disks are so re- liable we can confidently warrant they'll last a lifetime in constant use. That's a human life- time, not some vague disk lifetime expectation. Only the world's biggest seller of disks could offer such a warranty. Exceptional accuracy and reliability is built into every single disk we sell, because every disk is individually tested. Every Verbatim disk is, therefore, as perfect as a disk can be. Which is probably why we sell more than any other disk maker in the world. \\ferbatim. Word perfect. For life.

Bits & Bytes - September 1986 25 PROPAX Integrated accounting at its best by Peter Biggs ** T^awn, yet another 'integrated X accounting package'. The market is full of them ! \" I hear you say. Too true. Accounting software has always been the bread and butter for programmers and has proliferated ac- cordingly. After all, all businesses do it, whether they be the corner dairy or a multinational corporation. Accounting itself is an arcane art with double entry bookkeeping being its major arcanum. To most businesspeople who cannot afford the luxury of a full-time accountant and bookkeeper, accounting is just an end-of-the-month headache. It never goes away and is always too histori- cal to be of much benefit day-to-day. As any businosaperson knows, usually the hard way, money in the bank does not mean profitability, and the reverse is also true. Most busines- ses never know exactly what the fi- nancial status of the business is at any one time - they just fly by the 'seat of their pants'. They simply do not have the time to number-crunch every day nor do they want to be bookkeepers. 26 Bits & Bytes - September 1986 With GST on the horizon, I decided that the time had come to enter this world of true accountancy using the processing might of the computer. I chose an IBM compatible computer and then I looked at all the available small business accountancy software 1 could find. Before I go further, I should explain something about my peculiar attitude to computer software. I like the instal- lation to be convenient and easy, the screens to be attractive and laid out for maximum ease of use, the com- mands to be simple and not memorised, and the software to do as much as possible. I also like software to be open, in that data, once in, can be extracted from it to other software. Finally, to commit my business to a software program I need reliability and aptness to the NZ situation. NZ- written software for accounting is my preference. I also do not like software that re- lies on a single system disk for copy protection because if it becomes dam- aged, the software is useless while the disk is being replaced, often from overseas. So I came across Profax. First I liked the fact that I could play with three demonstration discs before I com- mited myself. This enabled me to be sure that it was right for me and my particular business. Convenient It seemed to score highly in all re- spects. I immediately liked the obvi- ous caie taken with its screen presen- tation and ease of use. It seemed de- signed to be convenient! So that's why I bought Profax for my business and hence am writing this review. Now to Profax itself. It comes with a 200-page manual, attractively bound in a slip case. The manual is professionally presented and laid out with clear headings and references. The program itself comes on three 5.26 inch discs - a starter, program and data disk. It seems to run on most IBM compatible comput- ers. Profax can be used with dual floppy disk drives but, with the cost of hard discs being very reasonable, I use it on a hard disk. The program is 'protected' in this way. On purchasing Profax you then send in the company name on an ap- plication form printed by the program to Logical Methods in Auckland. A system number is sent back to you. This number is then typed into the program as the system initialisation and the program then becomes 'live'. This company name then appears at the top of every report, etc. If you wish to change this at any time, con- tact either your dealer or Logical Methods. Next are the data files. These can be resized to your own requirements at any time, providing you have the disk space. The single data disk will hold about 500 monthly debtor trans- actions, 100 monthly creditor transac- tions and carry 500 stock items. Read- ing from and writing to a floppy disk is always aggravatingly slow com- pared to a hard disk, but if you have patience, it is quite usable in this way. A hard disk can obviously hold a lot more. Installing to a hard disk is easy. I made a directory called PROFAX and copied all the files from both discs into it. Then a file called PFDtfS will install colour (if you have a colour monitor), and the data and program files now both need to be changed to the hard drive (drive C on my compu- ter). If I wished, I could keep the data on one directory and the program files on another. Starting up Typing PF starts the program. A title screen flashes up and then the master menu appears. From here you can go to accounts receivable, inventory control, invoic- ing/sales analysis, accounts payable, general ledger and GST. The G/L can be protected with a password to pre- vent unauthorised access. Data file exporting is a little tricky, but financial information can be pul- led out into Lotus 1-2-3, Open Access, Visicalc, Supercalc HI, dBase III and Wordstar —in fact, any other program capable of using DEF format files. I found this useful for cash flow fore- casting using a Lotus 1-2-3 spread- sheet. Also on the master menu are the options for file recovery. This is used if a power failure occurs while proces- sing, not an uncommon event in some industrial areas, and files are left open. Many programs have difficulty with this. Profax has software that determines if corruption has occurred and works through each file that has been left open and check the validity of the data. It works through each record in the masterfile and checks that all transactions are correctly as- sociated with the correct accounts, etc. All irrecoverable transactions are reported, and it also may restructure some files at the same time. Obvi- ously weekly backups are important as well. The system initialisation enters company details, the security code number (which unlocks the program), G/L password and sets the audit trail options. Resizing the data files on basis of transactions, creditors, debtors, etc. can be done at any time. You are warned if the data files are not large enough to complete a transaction. Floppy disk users will need to watch these sizes. Now to using the program. The ac- counts receivable is for debtors. It of- fers a full customer enquiry and edit- ing facility. Transactions and state- ments can be sent with a statement message and printing of address labels. It also offers reports such as customer lists, debtors overdue, inac- tive, aged and nil sales. Inventory covers stock handling. From here you can set up your stock lists by group and supplier. Full re- ports are available on backorders, stock by product code or supplier, and price lists, sales reports, stock valua- tion and stocktaking forms can be printed out. The invoicing section is designed to be used with special Profax invoice forms #605, designed and printed by Moore Paragon. Form #201 is used for printing statements. To enter up an invoice the customer must be in the customer file or else a cash sale 1 issued. The stock code is entered along with the number of items and all calculations (including discount) is calculated. A discount schedule can be set up for different customers and some inventory func- tions are here as well. One unique feature is its ability to add and edit comment lines. Freight and GST are added. With accounts payable the ac- counts can be paid or part paid, pay- ments can be split between different genera) ledger areas, and cheques can be computer-written if required. General ledger (or G/L). It is vital that the G/L is carefully set up at the beginning. Once set up, the G/L gives a business person the facility to have a set of accounts each month. Profitability and margins are all here in different reports as well as setting budgets. Many different re- ports are available. The GST option allows you to set up the reporting system, the GST re- gistration number and even includes an option in case Mr Douglas decides in the future to have multiple GST rates. Everything I need for GST is there. What did I especially like about Pro- fax? The screens are well designed for ease of use and the program has a very consistent key use. The ES- Cape enables you to escape out of what you are doing, ends a menu and E exits from a transactions menu. Audit trails can be set as optional and even a printer is often not needed. The reports are many, varied and all are useful and include a full GST re- port. Obviously a trial balance and a profit and loss statement are availa- ble. The only other thing I would like is context-sensitive help screens but this would be impractical on a floppy disk system. I found Profax about as complex as I would expect a good accounting package to be. Setting it up was both time-consuming and instructive, but it has definitely been worthwhile. Any accounting package would re- quire the same. I'm still finding out other useful things it will do almost every day. I could use Profax to run a substantial business as long as it had only one profit centre. In hindsight, probably the most daunting aspect of getting into com- puterised accounting was setting the system up. Consulting with my ac- countant was useful, then the input of all our creditors, debtors and stock, including working out a useful coding system for us, took time. You can get someone to set it up for you at around $400 and training courses are availa- ble from Auckland Business Academy. Once set up, we ran the manual system beside this system for at least one month to iron out any problems. It has performed faultlessly and has vastly improved my financial control of the business. I feel very confident about October 1 ! To close, I would advise anyone to see as many as possible accounting programs before choosing one. After all, it is your business you are playing with. Ask for demo disks to play with in your own time. At $1500 Profax isn't the cheapest or most expensive but it certainly stands out in the ranks as a superb implementation of an in- tegrated accounting package. I found the price quite acceptable consider- ing the savings in accountant's fees and the feeling of at last having a real- time financial 'grip' on my business. o Introducing Flip n File For Storage and Protection Of Diskettes Sturdy compact design that swings open to an easel-type work station.

According to the NZ distributor, Calibre Systems Ltd, the AT was orig- inally designed as a multi-user/file server with a large footprint to accommodate expansion boards. However, with the AT becoming the desktop PC of choice, says Calibre, the demand is for a smaller unit with- out sacrificing power or performance. The TeleCAT 286's footprint is 400mm by 420mm, 28 per cent smal- ler than the IBM PC/AT. Its 512 Kb is expandable to 15 Mb, and it comes with a 1.2 Mb diskette drive, either the formatted 20 Mb or 30 Mb Win- chester drive, keyboard, RS-232C serial port, parallel printer port, clock/ calendar with battery backup, and five I/O expansion slots. It is sold with MS-DOS 3.1 and GW BASIC 3.1, and will be serviced throughout New Zealand by the Calibre Group. BITS & BYTES will carry a full review of the 286 in the near future.
