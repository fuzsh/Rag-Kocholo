        "text": "We are both researcher and designer. For us, comparing points of view and challenging opinions are activities that are necessary in order to become guides capable of exploring the future of society and driving current transformations. Under the aegis of Georges Balandier (1), we think we should revive and modernize imaginations by gathering new images from biological and digital discoveries, from virtual experiences and new machines. We are in the midst of a transformation to be played out with unprecedented yet barely used intellectual tools that call for such collaborations. Together, we must explore new ways of being part of the world (as biomimicry proposes) because repeating past methods and yesterday’s know-how can no longer guarantee \"living together\" on this planet. Mirroring scientific and intuitive methods, digital modeling and designing, allows for the complexity of living organizations to be represented, experiences to be co-created to validate assumptions and innovate, and imaginary worlds that carry common symbolism to be sought out. This biomimicry cross-discipline is a first step toward examining our respective disciplines and finding a way to embody ideas.\n\nIntroduction to a pioneer of systems thinking who outside the German speaking countries has remained relatively unknown, by means of a review of his book \"The Art of Interconnected Thinking: Tools and Concepts for a New Approach to Tackling Complexity\" (Munich, Germany: MCB Verlag, 2007). Note: This is an updated and extended version of 21 Oct 2015, of a paper originally published in 2005 as a review of a book in German language that had not yet been translated into English then but which, I suggested, should be made available to the English speaking world. The revision allowed adapting the review's terminology to that of the translator. The original review was published in Journal of Research Practice, 1, No. 1, 2005, Article R2 (5 March 2010), under the title \"Can nature teach us good research practice? A critical look at Frederic Vester’s bio-cybernetic systems approach,\" with a minor Postscript of 10 April 2008 giving updated links to work by Frederic Vester. The present, expanded version is also available in the \"Downloads\" section of Werner Ulrich's Home Page.\n\nInterdisciplinary debates focusing on the cybernetic and biotechnological advancements of semi-natural systems in architecture have contributed a great deal to the creation of new design imperatives and theoretical discourse in the field of experimental architecture. This paper explores interim stages of such advancements theoretically and practically derived from biology and cybernetics, based on the writings of Francisco Varela and Sanford Kwinter, as well as the work of Marcos Cruz and Steve Pike. The paper will exhibit and illustrate through a simulation elements of autopoietic system behaviour. This research establishes that such principles and processes in biology have a direct impact on the creation of generative situations in architecture. Furthermore, it illustrates the difference between the being of architecture as an outcome of the process of design and the becoming of architecture as a generative and collective process of situations. Situations as opposed to mere forms and spaces in architecture are elemental parts for this paper. Situations imply a spatio-temporal generation of objects, forms, spaces and events that exhibit unstable states in a system. They are considered as seeds of emergence in the process of becoming in architecture – singularity in-between complex systems and architecture. This is a theoretical paper – with an element of practice – that seeks to distinguish between generativity for the process of being in architecture and generativity for the process of becoming, where the latter is the central focus of this research."
