The Excelsior system provides far superior speed for the single user, as well as increased price/ performance in multiple computer installations. Speed, flexibility, RAM caching, shared storage, and removable media combine to make Excelsior a uniquely powerful solution for microcomputer applications. The latest in storage technology With the Excelsior range of products, customers receive both the speed and capacity of traditional Winchester disk systems, as well as the security and unlimited backup capability of removable media. Available for a wide range of computers Excelsior products are available for a wide range of computers, including: IBM PC, XT and AT Victor/Sirius Apricot PC, XI and FI Apple NEC APC Epson QX-10 Sanyo MBC 1100 PC Compatibles And others to come... Shared storage...even between different operating systems! The speedy single-user Excelsior system is easily and inexpensively upgraded to allow multiple users to share a common disk, at little cost to performance. Any combination of the above computers may be connected to the system, providing a common storage area where data created by one user may be retrieved by another.This sharing feature gives Excelsior the highest price/performance ratio in the market. The unique high performance controller The Excelsior RAM cache disk controller incorporates 256k of RAM memory and an ingenious disk caching algorithm.This unique combination stores the most frequently used information in RAM memory on the controller. In most cases, subsequent disk read and write requests will be found in RAM memory so that data is transferred at RAM speeds rather than disk speeds. By keeping frequently accessed information in the cache buffer, the intelligent caching algorithm provides higher performance in both single user and disk intensive environments. All the versatility of removable media The implementation of removable media in the Excelsior system provides security in sensitive corporate and government environments, as well as unlimited primary or backup capability. Data on removable media may be secured in safes or vaults, making it impossible for unauthorized users to access private files. Further more, Excelsior allows each disk to be treated as primary or backup storage. Simply use the removable disk as one would any Winchester disk system in primary mode, or for backup in the archive mode. And with removable cartridges, capacity is virtually unlimited. Configurations to meet any requirement The Excelsior Mass Storage COMPUTER PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 16 PCW NOVEMBER 1985 Flexibility. Backup Assurance. EXCELSIOR! System offers from 24 to 200 megabytes of Winchester capacity, as well as 12 to 48 megabytes of removable media capacity.This combination gives customers the speed and power of standard Winchester disk subsystems, as well as the transportability, security and unlimited backup capability of removable media systems. Excelsior’s flexibility of configurations allows users to choose a total system which most ideally satisfies their needs. Upgrading is easy and economical Excelsior allows users to expand their system by either adding disks or attaching inexpensive slave units. As user requirements grow, additional computers may be added to the Excelsior to provide a shared resource.This upgradeability feature lets Excelsior grow in power as the demands on the system increase. Unlimited backup capability The Excelsior system incorporates the use of removable media disk drives, providing unlimited backup capability. Backup/Archiving may be accomplished in either a file-by-file or dump mode as required. As additional insurance in the event your Winchester disk should fail, the removable media disk would guarantee continuous operation with little degradation in speed or performance. Now recruiting qualified distributors Representatives of Computer Products International soon will be embarking upon an aggressive promotional campaign to sign quality distributors to market the Excelsior System.
