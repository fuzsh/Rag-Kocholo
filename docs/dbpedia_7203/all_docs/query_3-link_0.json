        "text": "Musical artist\n\nRalph Simon Sharon (September 17, 1923 â€“ March 31, 2015) was a British-American jazz pianist and arranger.[1] He is best known for working with Tony Bennett as his pianist on numerous recordings and live performances.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nRalph Sharon was born in London, England, to a British mother and Latvian-born father. He emigrated to the United States in early 1954,[2] becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States five years later.\n\nBy 1958, Ralph Sharon was recording as an accompanist for Tony Bennett. That was the start of a more than 50 year working relationship as Bennett's \"man behind the music\" on many Grammy Award-winning studio recordings, and touring with Bennett for many years. Sharon found the song \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" for Bennett, a year after placing the sheet music in a bureau and forgetting about it. Sharon discovered the manuscript while packing for a tour that included San Francisco. While Bennett and Sharon liked the song, they were convinced it would only be a local hit. Instead, the tune became Bennett's signature song.\n\nOn his recording of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the 1992 CD Snowfall: The Tony Bennett Christmas Album, Bennett is heard at the end of the song exclaiming \"Take me home, Ralph!\" as Sharon plays the last notes of the song.[3]\n\nRalph Sharon was a jazz pianist in his own right, recording a series of his own albums. But Sharon was best known as one of the finest accompanists who backed up popular singers, including Tony Bennett, Robert Goulet, Chris Connor and many others.[1]\n\nRetiring to Boulder, Colorado, from on-the-road work with Bennett when he reached 80, Ralph Sharon continued to perform in the Denver metropolitan area until shortly before his death. Tony Bennett and the Ralph Sharon Trio performed at various jazz venues, including Dazzle Restaurant & Lounge in Denver. He died from natural causes on March 31, 2015.[4]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nSolo albums\n\n[edit]\n\n1953 Autumn Leaves and Spring Fever\n\n1954 Easy Jazz (As The Ralph Sharon All-Star Sextet)\n\n1956 The Ralph Sharon Trio (As The Ralph Sharon Trio)\n\n1956 Mr. and Mrs. Jazz (With Sue Sharon)\n\n1957 Around the World In Jazz (As The Ralph Sharon Sextet)\n\n1958 2:38 A.M.\n\n1963 Modern Innovations In Country and Western Music\n\n1964 Do I Hear a Waltz?
