        "text": "Bob Fox adds (via email):\n\nWay back in 1951, I was Manager of the Pier Bandstand at Weymouth, and Ralph had been engaged with a sextet (I say \"a\" because it was obviously not his usual one). The Weymouth Council had done a deal with Ralph's Agent at the time for the resident summer season, and in order to \"boost\" the sound as it was only a sextet working on an open air stage, Ralph was required to play a hammond organ. He was also required to play typical \"bandstand\" music - \"Student Prince:\"etc, and even, on one night a week, play for Old Time Dancing.\n\nWe got on very well - but I don't think it would have been one of his happiest seasons. I really did feel sorry for Ralph especially when one Sunday, Vic Lewis and members of his Band who were playing a Sunday night concert in Weymouth, turned up in the afternoon to hear Ralph playing selections from the shows - very embarrassing!\n\nThat season may have been Ralph's first contact with the Americans though, as I remember that the USS MIssouri, known as Mighty Mo' the largest battleship in the world at that time was in Portland Harbour, and Ralph used to go aboard on his night off and play jazz with the Yanks. They had a cracking 20 piece big band, and Ralph wrote an article for the Melody Maker, and I recall the headline to this day \" Mighty Mo Rocks at Anchor\".\n\nTed Heath and his Music - January 28th, 1946 (Decca)details\n\nJack Parnell and his Quartet - March 29th, 1946 (Decca)\n\nReg Owen (cl), Ralph Sharon (p), Dave Goldberg (g), Charlie Short (b), Jack Parnell (d).\n\nSoft Noodles*/Just You, Just Me*/Too Marvellous For Words/Riffet.\n\n(*Avid CD - Jack Parnell: Two Classic Albums plus Two Eps)\n\nJack Parnell and his Quartet - July 29th, 1946 (Decca)\n\nReg Owen (cl), Ralph Sharon (p), Dave Goldberg (g), Jack Fallon (b), Jack Parnell (d).\n\nCant We Be Friends?*/Stomping At The Savoy*/On The Alamo*/I'll Never Be The Same*.\n\n(*Avid CD - Jack Parnell: Two Classic Albums plus Two Eps)\n\nMelody Maker's Jazz Rally - June 29th, 1947 (All issued on Columbia)\n\nDave Wilkins (tp), Woolf Phillips (tb), Harry Parry (cl), Reggie Dare (ts), Ralph Sharon (p), Pete Chilver (g), Jack Fallon (b), Norman Burns (d).\n\nWho's Sorry Now (part 1)/Who's Sorry Now (part 2).\n\nSame date\n\nReg Arnold (tp), George Chisholm (tb), Bertie King (as) Cliff Townsend (vln), Ralph Sharon (p), Frank Deniz (g), Jack Collier (b), Jock Cummings (d).\n\nI've Found A New Baby.\n\nSame date\n\nFrank Weir, Carl Barriteau (cl), Harry Hayes, Bertie King (as), Tommy Whittle (ts), Ralph Sharon (p), Dave Goldberg (g), Jack Collier (b), Jock Cummings (d).\n\nConfessin'/C Jam Blues/Thriving On A Riff*.\n\n(*Proper Records 4CD Box set - Jazz in Britain 1919 - 1950)\n\nThe Esquire Five - January 13th, 1948 (Esquire)\n\nRonnie Scott (ts), Pete Chilver (g), Ralph Sharon (p), Jack Fallon (b), Carlo Krahmer (d).\n\nLady Be Good*^/Boppin' At Esquire*^/Idabop^/What Is This Thing Called Love^.\n\n(^Indigo CD - Boppin' At Esquire)\n\n(*Giant Steps Records CD - Great Scott)\n\n(^Charly/Esquire 4 CD box set - bebop IN BRITAIN - issued in 1991 currently only available second hand...)\n\n(^Proper Records 4CD Box set - Ronnie Scott \"Boppin' With Scott\")\n\nAlan Dean and the All Star Sextet - April 17th, 1948 (Esquire)\n\nAubrey Frank (ts), Reg Arnold (tp), Ralph Sharon (p), Tommy Pollard (vib), Jack Fallon (b), Norman Burns (d), Alan Dean (vocal).\n\nOop-pop-a da#/Disc Jockey Jump.\n\n(#Hallmark CD - Basement Bop - British jazz in the 1950s)\n\nApril 29th, 1948 (Esquire)\n\nPersonnel as April 17th.\n\nGalaxy*/I Can't Get Started*#/First Gear*/Confirmation*.\n\n(*Charly/Esquire 4 CD box set - bebop IN BRITAIN - issued in 1991 currently only available second hand...)\n\n(#Hallmark CD - Basement Bop - British jazz in the 1950s)\n\n(#Proper Records 4CD Box set - Jazz in Britain 1919 - 1950)\n\nMay 8th, 1948 (Esquire)\n\nPersonnel as April, 17th\n\nMy Baby Likes To Bebop*/Disc Jockey Jump*/Fallonology*/Jack Fiddles While Norman Burns*.\n\n(*Charly/Esquire 4 CD box set - bebop IN BRITAIN - issued in 1991 currently only available second hand...)\n\nJanuary 15th, 1949 (Esquire)\n\nPersonnel as April 17th, 1948 except Kenny Baker (tp) replaces Reg Arnold.\n\nGabardine And Serge/First Gear.\n\nKeith Bird and The Esquire Six - October 13th, 1949 (Esquire)\n\nKeith Bird (cl), Tommy Pollard (vib), Ralph Sharon (p), Dave Goldberg (g), Charlie Short (b), Carlo Krahmer (d), Cab Kaye (voc-1).\n\nHow High The Moon(1)/Esquire Blues/Tom's Tea Party/Revol.\n\nRalph Sharon Bobtet - November 9th, 1949 (Harmony)\n\nHarry Roche (tb), Harry Klein (as), Ronnie Scott (ts), Bob Burns (bs), Ralph Sharon (p), Dave Goldberg (g), Charles Short (b), Martin Aston (d), Doreen Henry (vcl).\n\nEuphonia/How High The Moon/Zanzibar.
