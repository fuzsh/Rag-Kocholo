        "text": "Kelly Osbourne and Sid Wilson are parents!\n\nThe couple welcomed their baby boy, Sidney, at the tail end of 2022, after going public with their relationship in January of that same year. However, Osbourne and Wilson have been friends since they met in 1999 on the music scene.\n\nIn February 2024, the pair made their red carpet debut at the Grammys in Los Angeles.\n\nFrom welcoming their son to their sweet social media tributes, here is a complete timeline of Kelly Osbourne and Sid Wilson's relationship.\n\nWhere it all started\n\nIn 1999, Osbourne and Wilson met for the first time while Slipknot toured with Ozzfest, the music festival founded by her parents Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne.\n\nA hard launch\n\nIn January, Osbourne shared a handful of photos on her Instagram wishing him a happy 45th birthday — and a source confirmed to PEOPLE shortly after that they're \"very happy together.\"\n\nThe source also said that given their past, it shouldn't come as a shock since they've \"remained friends.\"\n\nDistance makes the heart grow fonder\n\nA few days after PEOPLE confirmed their relationship, Osbourne documented her trip to Ireland and Italy with her friend Kip Zachary — and in a sense, Wilson!\n\n\"Everywhere I go I take my baby with me 😂,\" she captioned a slide on her Instagram Story of herself posing with a large, screen-printed pillow of Wilson's face.\n\nShortly after, she also posted a sweet quote on her Instagram Story, tagging Wilson on the slide.\n\n\"&& so there's this boy, And the way he laughs makes me smile, And the way he talks gives me butterflies, And everything about him, makes me happy,\" the quote read.\n\nFamily time\n\nIn a rare sighting, the couple was photographed in Los Angeles in February going to a family gathering.\n\nThe pair were photographed wearing dark-colored outfits as they stopped by a 4th birthday party being held for Osbourne's niece, Minnie, daughter of her brother Jack.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, the star shared a sweet Instagram photo of her and her nieces playing on a swing set.\n\n\"Happy birthday Min Min I can't believe you are 4!!! 🎂🎁🎈,\" she captioned the photo.\n\nOsbourne also shared a photo to her Instagram Story of herself and Wilson snuggling up to her parents' dog Wesley.\n\n\"Wesley is not just dads favorite but he is Sids favorite too!\" she wrote.\n\nFirst Valentine's Day\n\nTo mark Valentine's Day, Osbourne didn't let her love for her rocker beau go unnoticed and shared a carousel of sweet photos on social media, dedicated to Wilson.\n\n\"After 23 years of friendship I can't believe where we have ended up!\" the reality star wrote alongside a photo of herself and Wilson sharing a smooch. \"You are my best friend, my soulmate and I am so deeply in love with you Sidney George Wilson. 💜\"\n\nIn the post, she also shared a photo of Wilson giving her a kiss on the cheek, one inside what appears to be a spaceship, one smiling with a dog, and a serious selfie showing off their overalls.\n\nHe then shared the photo to his Instagram feed and wrote, \"There is not enough colours to display the palette of Love I have for you in my Heart 💜 Happy Valentines Day my Love XoXo.\"\n\nBaby on the way!\n\nIn May 2022, Osbourne announced on Instagram that she was expecting her first baby with Wilson alongside a selfie of her holding an ultrasound photo.\n\n\"I know that I have been very quiet these past few months so I thought I would share with you all as to why… I am over the moon to announce that I am going to be a Mumma,\" she wrote. \"To say that I am happy does not quite cut it. I am ecstatic! 🤰💜.\"\n\nShortly after, Wilson shared a photo of the ultrasound to his Instagram feed but let the photo speak for itself — captioning the photo with a series of emojis including hearts and a family.\n\nIt's a boy!\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2022, Osbourne revealed the sex of her baby while talking to Entertainment Tonight. She decided to make the information public after her dad, Ozzy, couldn't keep the secret from friends and family.\n\n\"I mean, he's told everyone ... the gender of my baby before I ever got the chance to,\" she said. \"And I'm just like, 'Aww Dad, come on. Like, come on,' but I will say, every single day he does this little song and this little dance about how excited he is, and he is so excited that it's a boy. It's the first — out of me and my brother, it's the first boy, so, he's like planning all these things.\"\n\nNew parents\n\nOsbourne and Wilson welcomed their first child together in 2022.\n\nOsbourne's mom, Sharon, made the news public during an appearance on The Talk in January 2023. She also shared her grandson's name — likely without permission from her daughter.\n\n\"[His name is] Sidney. [They're] doing so great,\" Sharon said. \"She won't let a picture go out of him.\"\n\nLater that day, Osbourne posted a message on her Instagram Stories that said: \"I am not ready to share him with the world. It is no one's place but mine to share any information on my baby.\"\n\nIn June 2023, the proud mom finally shared a picture of the baby on Instagram. In the snap, the little one was dressed in a black swaddle with bat ears and bat wings, a reference to when Ozzy infamously bit the head off a live bat while on stage in 1982.\n\nDuring an episode of The Osbournes Podcast in February 2024, the Fashion Police alum revealed that she and Wilson got into a \"huge fight\" over naming their son.\n\n“It’s the biggest fight me and my baby’s father have ever ever ever had, and probably ever ever will,\" she said. \"I wanted our son to have both of our last names, and he wouldn’t let me. After lots of eye-opening conversations and some couples therapy, he has seen the light.\"\n\nRed carpet debut"
