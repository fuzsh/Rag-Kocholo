        "text": "Ralph Sharon, Tony Bennett’s longtime accompanist, who in the early 1960s persuaded Mr. Bennett to sing a song originally written for a Wagnerian contralto — about the fond intersection of a large muscle in the chest with a Northern California city — and in so doing created a Grammy-winning standard, died on March 31 at his home in Boulder, Colo. He was 91.\n\nHis son, Bo, confirmed the death.\n\nA highly regarded jazz pianist in his own right, Mr. Sharon joined forces with Mr. Bennett in the late 1950s and remained with him for the better part of the next 45 years. He collaborated with Mr. Bennett on a string of Grammy Award-winning albums, over time serving as his accompanist, arranger and musical director, and is widely credited with nudging Mr. Bennett out of pop and into jazz.\n\n“I’ve been very lucky to have worked with Ralph Sharon,” Mr. Bennett told The Seattle Times in 1993. “In my life I’ve seen only two others like him, Bill Miller with Sinatra and Bobby Tucker with Billie Holiday and Billy Eckstine — very good jazz musicians, but able to sublimate themselves to singers. It’s a real art, and it’s rarely recognized.”\n\nTheir most famous recording together, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” released in 1962 on the Columbia label, won Mr. Bennett two Grammys, for record of the year and best male solo vocal performance. Its title ballad remains Mr. Bennett’s vocal signature to this day and, in his myriad renditions, has sold millions of copies.\n\nWith music by George Cory and lyrics by Douglass Cross, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” was first published in 1954. It had been composed in the early ’50s for the contralto Claramae Turner, a midcentury mainstay of the Metropolitan Opera whose roles there included Amneris in Verdi’s “Aida” and Erda in Wagner’s “Siegfried.”\n\nTurner sang the ballad as an encore in recitals but never recorded it. Then, in the late ’50s or early ’60s, Mr. Cory and Mr. Cross, acquaintances of Mr. Sharon, gave him the sheet music for Mr. Bennett’s consideration. Mr. Sharon put the music into a bureau drawer and promptly forgot all about it for more than a year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
