        "text": "Ralph Simon Sharon was a jazz pianist and arranger.\n\nSharon was born in London, England, to an English mother and Latvian-born father. He emigrated to the United States in early 1954, becoming a naturalized citizen five years later.\n\nBy 1958, Ralph Sharon was recording with Tony Bennett, the start of a more than 50 year working relationship as Bennett's \"man behind the music\" on many Grammy Award-winning studio recordings, and touring with Bennett for many years. He found \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" for Bennett, a year after placing it in a bureau and forgetting about it. Sharon discovered the manuscript while packing for a tour that included San Francisco. While Bennett and Sharon liked the song, they were convinced it would only be a local hit. The tune became Bennett's signature song.\n\nSharon was a jazz pianist in his own right, recording a series of his own albums. But Sharon was best known as one of the finest accompanists who backed up popular singers, including Bennett, Robert Goulet, Chris Connor and many others.\n\nRetiring to Boulder, Colorado, from on-the-road work with Bennett when he reached 80, Ralph Sharon continued to perform in the Denver metropolitan area until shortly before his death. Tony Bennett and the Ralph Sharon Trio performed at various jazz venues, including Dazzle Restaurant & Lounge in Denver. He died from natural causes on March 31, 2015."
