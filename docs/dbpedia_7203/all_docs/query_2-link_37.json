        "text": "The Year of Tony Bennett is proud to recognize Ralph Sharon as the musical collaborator the month for September 2017.\n\nRalph Sharon was born in London on September 23, 1923. He emigrated to the United States in 1954 and in 1958, became Tony Bennett’s pianist and musical director.\n\nI’ll be sharing more about Mr. Sharon over this month. But today I’ll let Mr. Bennett speak, in his wonderful memory of Ralph in Jazz Times.\n\nTony Bennett Remembers Ralph Sharon – JazzTimes\n\nEach year, in our March issue, we ask prominent musicians to pay tribute to fellow artists who have passed in the previous year. This piece appeared in the March 2016 edition of JazzTimes. As with other artists, there’s always one song that’s bigger than any other song, and for me that was “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.”"
