        "text": "A funeral service will be held Thursday for Ralph Ryland Kelley, formerly of Dutch Lane, Hermitage. He passed away at 12:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 1, 2010, in the hospital of Sharon Regional Health System after a brief illness. Recently, he had been a resident of Countryside Convalescent Home in Lackawannock Township. He was 96. Mr. Kelley was born Feb. 11, 1913, on the Kelley farm, between Bruceton Mill and Terra Alta, Preston County, W.Va., to his parents, Russell A.O. Kelley and Lenore Michael Kelley. As a young child, he walked a mile each way to and from the rural primary school, Laurel Glenn, which he attended. He boarded in Terra Alta during the winter months while attending Terra Alta High School, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1931. For the next two years, he was enrolled at Salem College in Clarksburg, W.Va., then transferred to West Virginia University in Morgantown, from which he graduated with honors from the College of Engineering. Joining Westinghouse Electric Corp. in the 1930s, Mr. Kelley was transferred from the Pittsburgh area to the former Sharon Transformer Division. He met Nellie Richardson in 1940 and married her March 8, 1941. She preceded him in death Nov. 18, 2000. Mr. Kelley worked at Westinghouse for 40 years in the design department and retired in 1978. Ralph was very active in Free and Accepted Masons. He was past master of the Sharon Lodge 668 twice, and Lodge 810, Hermitage. He continued to be active in the Hermitage lodge and was a past commander of Knights of Templar Mount Calvary Commandery 67, Greenville; and belonged to Royal and Select Masters Council 48, Sharon; and Mound Royal Arch Chapter 212, Greenville. He was a 32nd degree of Scottish Rite’s New Castle Consistory and a former member of the Zem Zem Shrine, Erie, and Mercer County Shrine Club. He was also active in the Civil Air Patrol and the Junior Chamber of Commerce. As a skilled licensed pilot, Mr. Kelley retained a passion for flying personal aircraft. For many years, he would amuse listeners with his recounting of flying Santa Claus to the old Chadderton Airport in Hermitage. Rooted in his agrarian upbringing, Mr. Kelley had a lifelong interest in vegetable gardening, lawn care and the enjoyment of wildlife. He is survived by: two daughters, Carol Jean Bauzo, Hermitage; and Nancy Beth Kelley, Centerburg, Ohio; three sons, Ralph Drew Kelley and his wife Barbara, St. John, Ind.; Russell Lynn Kelley and his wife Barbara, Columbia, S.C.; and Bruce Richardson Kelley and his wife Paula, Hermitage; four grandchildren, Douglas Kelley and his wife Catherine; Laura Kelley; Allison Croxton and her husband Kevin; and Megan Kelley; two great-grandchildren, Thomas Ryland Croxton and Adaline Grace Croxton; and a sister, Margaret Cubbon, Florida. Besides his wife, he was preceded in death by his parents and a son-in-law, Joseph A. Bauzo. Memorial contributions may be made to Sharon Regional Hospice and Palliative Care, 2320 Highland Road, Hermitage, PA 16148. The family would like to extend their gratitude to Dr. Iftikhar Chatha and the skilled staff of Countryside Convalescent Home for the care and compassion shown toward their father. KELLEY Ralph, 96, formerly of 319 Dutch Lane, Hermitage.
