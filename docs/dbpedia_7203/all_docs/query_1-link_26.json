        "text": "The Year of Tony Bennett is proud to remember Ralph Sharon on anniversary of his birth on September 17, 1923.\n\nRalph Sharon was born in London, England to an English father and an American mother, who was a professional pianist.\n\nMr. Sharon found success quite early in life. By the age of 20, he was playing for Ted Heath in England, all the time playing additional jazz gigs and recording for the BBC. In the early 1950s, he emigrated to New York. He worked with prominent musicians, recording albums with noted jazz musicians, including Charles Mingus, Jo Jones, and others.\n\nRalph Sharon is seminal figure in the early recording history of Tony Bennett. A noted jazz pianist, he encouraged Tony to explore his love of jazz at the same time the studio was attempting to guide Mr. Bennett into the role of popular singer. Sharon auditioned for Tony Bennett in 1957, as described by Mr. Bennett in his autobiography, The Good Life:\n\nThe first guy that showed up was okay, but the second guy, Ralph Sharon, just had to hit a few notes for me to know that he was the piano player for me.\n\nAt about the same time that Ralph Sharon began to play for Bennett, Columbia began to phase Mitch Miller out and Bennett began to work with other producers. Due to his enormous success, Bennett was able to stand up to the producers who wanted to keep him solely in the popular music hit factory. Tony Bennett had already recorded his first jazz album, Cloud 7, in 1955. Working with Sharon, they began to plan his next jazz album, Beat of My Heart. They assembled great percussionists to play the great standards, with exceptional arrangements by Mr. Sharon. In addition to great American drummers (including Nat Adderley, Chico Hamilton, Jo Jones, and Eddie Costa) they also brought in two important Latin American percussionists: Sabu and Candido. The album was one Tony Bennett’s finest albums to date and was well-received by jazz fans.\n\nIn 1962, Bennett and Sharon released one of my favorite albums, Tony Sings For Two. At a time when so much popular music was over-produced with enormous string sections, this album with just Ralph Sharon on piano and Tony Bennett singing was quite revolutionary. This album is quite exceptional and very beautiful. T\n\nIn 1966, Ralph Sharon and Tony Bennett parted ways. Mr. Sharon lived on the West Coast and wanted to spend less time on the road. They reunited in 1979 and continued to play with Mr. Bennett until 2002. They did wonderful work together on albums Mr. Bennett released in that period: Art of Excellence, Bennett/Berlin, Perfectly Frank, and the MTV Unplugged concert, among others.\n\nSpeaking strictly as fan of Tony Bennett, I am grateful for the collaboration between Ralph Sharon and Tony Bennett.\n\nRalph Sharon died on March 31, 2015 in Boulder, Colorado. He was 91 years old.\n\nNPR did a nice story about Ralph Sharon soon after his death:\n\nThe song of the day for Thursday, April 27, 2017 is “I’ll Be Seeing You.”\n\nAbout This Song\n\n“I’ll Be Seeing You,” written in 1938 by Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal (lyrics), grew to its fame during World War II, when it became something of an anthem for soldiers serving overseas and the loved ones left at home. It’s been recorded by Billie Holiday, Al Hirt, Lisa Minelli, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee and Willie Nelson. One of my favorite recordings is from Tony’s old friend Rosemary Clooney, who closed her 1991 album For The Duration with this song.\n\nAbout This Version\n\nTony Bennett recorded “I’ll Be Seeing You” in 1992 for his album of songs associated with Frank Sinatra: Perfectly Frank. Like Rosemary, Bennett also closed out this magnificent album with “I’ll Be Seeing You.” The song features a very fine arrangement by Ralph Sharon. This album is also significant in that Columbia recording engineer Frank Laico came out of retirement to serve as recording engineer for the album.\n\n“I’ll Be Seeing You,” as well as Perfectly Frank, is available from iTunes."
