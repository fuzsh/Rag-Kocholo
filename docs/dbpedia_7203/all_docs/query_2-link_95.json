        "text": "Very sad news...\n\nMark Fox reports on Facebook that we have lost Ralph Sharon at the age of 91. Ralph was most well-known as Tony Bennett's accompanist and musical director for many years. Confirming obituary will be posted as soon as one is found online.\n\nI saw that. I don't trust Wikipedia enough to post, plus it says nothing really. Best obit will be from the Denver newspaper. Ralph was a resident of that area and played in a small club up until sometime this year.\n\nTrue...he has been out of the spotlight for some time now and only really still \"known\" to the Denver jazz people in recent years.\n\nThat is a particularly lovely album.\n\nUrgh. Sharon was a simpatico accompanist and a good piano trio leader. I'm going to spin When Lights Are Low when I get home.\n\nSee â€”> Tony Bennett: The Complete Albums (Disc 56)\n\n(For the many Tony Bennett albums he played on, search for \"Ralph Sharon\" in that thread.)"
