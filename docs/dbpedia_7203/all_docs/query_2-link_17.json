        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- Jazz pianist, bandleader, and composer Ralph Sharon has died, at 91.\n\nSharon was the gifted keyboardist who turned Tony Bennett onto jazz, and made 'I Left My Heart In San Francisco' into Bennett's signature song, and the anthem for The City.\n\nThe British-born pianist died from natural causes in Boulder, Colorado on March 31.\n\nSharon played with the jazz greats -- Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Kenny Clarke, Rosemary Clooney -- but his most famous association was with singer Tony Bennett. In fact, it was Sharon who convinced Bennett to switch from popular songs to jazz back in the 60s. Bennett wrote in his autobiography, \"Hooking up with Ralph was one of the best career moves I've ever made.\"\n\n\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" collected dust in the bottom of Sharon's shirt drawer for months. Songwriters George Cory Jr. and Douglass Cross had given Sharon the music in hopes he would play it one day.\n\nHe did.\n\nHe played it for Bennett just before a tour stop in San Francisco and the crooner liked it. Luck, fate and opportunity collided the night they performed it at the Venetian Room in San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. Amazingly, Mayor George Christopher and future mayor Joseph Alioto happened to be in the audience. Everyone loved it, and the song took off. Bennett recorded it on the B-side of \"Once Upon A Time,\" and it shot up on the Billboard charts, winning the Grammy Award for 'Record of the Year' in 1962.\n\nSharon would remain Bennett's musical director until 2002. Even after he retired and left Los Angeles for Colorodo, he continued to play in clubs and night spots until his death.\n\nRalph Sharon is survived by his wife, Linda Noone Sharon, a son, and 2 grandchildren."
