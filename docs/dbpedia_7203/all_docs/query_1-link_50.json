        "text": "Ralph Sharon was Tony Bennett's longtime accompanist and in the early 1960s persuaded him to sing a song originally written for a Wagnerian contralto — about the fond intersection of a large muscle in the chest with a Northern California city — and in so doing created a Grammy-winning standard.\n\nA highly regarded jazz pianist in his own right, Sharon joined forces with Bennett in the late 1950s and remained with him for the better part of the next 45 years. He collaborated with Bennett on a string of Grammy Award-winning albums, over time serving as his accompanist, arranger and musical director, and is widely credited with nudging Bennett out of pop and into jazz.\n\n\"I've been very lucky to have worked with Ralph Sharon,\" Bennett said in 1993. \"In my life I've seen only two others like him, Bill Miller with Sinatra and Bobby Tucker with Billie Holiday and Billy Eckstine — very good jazz musicians, but able to sublimate themselves to singers. It's a real art, and it's rarely recognized.\"\n\nTheir most famous recording together, I Left My Heart in San Francisco, released in 1962, won Bennett two Grammys, for record of the year and best male solo vocal performance. Its title ballad remains Bennett's vocal signature to this day and, in his myriad renditions, has sold millions of copies.\n\nWith music by George Cory and lyrics by Douglass Cross, I Left My Heart in San Francisco was first published in 1954. It had been composed in the early '50s for the contralto Claramae Turner, a mid-century mainstay of the Metropolitan Opera whose roles there included Amneris in Verdi's Aida and Erda in Wagner's Siegfried.\n\nTurner sang the ballad as an encore in recitals but never recorded it. Then, in the late '50s or early '60s, Cory and Cross, acquaintances of Sharon, gave him the sheet music for Bennett's consideration. Sharon put the music into a bureau drawer and promptly forgot all about it for more than a year.\n\nRalph Simon Sharon was born on September 17, 1923, in the East End of London. His mother was a pianist for silent movies. By the time he was a teenager, Ralph was playing in the celebrated British big band led by Ted Heath.\n\nIn the mid-'50s, Sharon moved to New York to try to make it in American jazz. After a few years with the clarinetist Tony Scott and other jazzmen, he was asked to audition for Bennett, of whom he had never heard.\n\n\"I was skeptical,\" Sharon said in 2009. \"But I met this guy, and he sang a few things and I played a few things. I thought, 'This guy sounds pretty good'.\"\n\nThe two remained together until Sharon's retirement in 2002, with Bennett backed by Sharon alone or by the Ralph Sharon Trio, which included a bassist and a drummer. Sharon left for a period in the 1970s to work with Rosemary Clooney and Robert Goulet but later reunited with Bennett.\n\nOn his own or with his trio, Sharon recorded dozens of albums, among them Around the World in Jazz, The Magic of Jerome Kern and The Magic of George Gershwin.\n\nCall it providence. In 1961, as he and Bennett were about to embark on a concert tour, Sharon opened his bureau drawer, reached for a shirt and noticed the forgotten sheet music. The tour would take them to San Francisco — what would be the harm, he thought, in persuading Bennett to sing the ballad there?\n\n\"We played it there, and the people liked it,\" Sharon said in 2002. \"We thought it would be a local hit.\"\n\nRalph Sharon is survived by his wife, Linda (nee Noone), son Bo and two grandchildren.\n\nMargalit Fox.
