        "text": "Sharon R. Pielak passed away on Sunday, January 28, 2024, at the age of 83 with her family by her side at her home in West Branch, MI.\n\nShe was born Sharon Rae Hoover in Detroit, MI on October 20, 1940, to Ralph Emerson Hoover and Pearl Marie (Julien) Hoover.\n\nSharon married Walt Pielak on February 20, 1958, and was blessed with a long-lasting partnership for over 65 years. She was determined to remain by Walt’s side as he passed away and soon after joined him.\n\nWalt and Sharon went through life together side by side; loving family time, morning coffee and donuts, making traditional family recipes together, traveling around the country in their motorhome, overnight trips to Michigan casinos, old black and white movies, and were absolutely crazy about their cute and crazy golden-doodle, Toby. She loved the many homes Walt built for them over the years and enjoyed decorating comfortable environments they could share with family.\n\nSharon was the most extraordinary homemaker, creating a warm, loving home open to all. Their home was always filled with family and friends who will certainly recall all the delicious home cooked meals, the overabundance of blankets and pillows needed to accommodate weekend family visits, the endless supply of clean towels for swimming and showers, and most importantly the love and laughter that was shared by all.\n\nSharon especially loved to care for her grandchildren. She loved their times together decorating cookies, dying easter eggs, carving pumpkins for Halloween, joyous birthday celebrations, and overnight stays. Walt and Sharon spent countless hours at sporting events and school activities for their children and grandchildren. Sharon poured her love into caring for her family.\n\nSharon leaves behind her son Greg Pielak of Manton, MI, daughter Jammie (Gary) Buddenborg of St. Helen, MI, granddaughters Jennifer (Aaron) Gilbert of Fountain Valley, CA, Stacy (Jerry) Hancock of Howell, MI, Michele Gancitano of Highland, MI, Amy (Rick) Silva of San Jose, CA, and Ellie Connett of Cincinnati, OH, grandson Riley (Ally) Connett of Auburn Hills, MI, 11 great grandchildren, 2 great-great grandchildren, her brother Russel (Barb) Hoover, sisters-in-law Kathy Campbell, Bernice Jones, and Marcie Tonti, and brother-in-law Pete (Debbie) Pielak.\n\nSharon was preceded in death by her parents, husband Walt, daughter Loreen Gancitano, brother Larry (Sharron) Hoover and her sisters and brothers-in-law Edsel, Telly, Francie, Helen, Johnny, Mary, Al, and Bernadine.\n\nThe family, again, is so appreciative to the staff of The Brook of West Branch and Compassus Hospice. The Brook staff supported Sharon during the last days of Walt’s life and their compassion during Sharon’s last days will never be forgotten. We can’t thank Compassus Hospice enough for their help and kindness shown to Sharon and her family.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations be sent to Compassus Hospice of West Branch.\n\nTo honor Sharon and her late husband Walt, there will be a celebration of their lives in early summer. A date, time, and location will be announced in spring on the family’s Facebook.\n\nArrangements were handled by Steuernol & McLaren Funeral Home in West Branch. www.steuernolmclaren.com"
