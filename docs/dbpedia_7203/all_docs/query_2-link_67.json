Good condition with some signs of external wear. Small tear to lower and upper spine. Several annotions by preowner on two pages. \"Ralph Simon Sharon (September 17, 1923   March 31, 2015) was an Anglo-American jazz pianist and arranger.Born in London to an English mother and Latvian born father, he emigrated to the United States in early 1954, becoming a naturalized citizen five years later. By 1958, Ralph Sharon was recording with Tony Bennett, the start of a more than 50 year working relationship as Bennett's man behind the music on many Grammy winning studio recordings, and touring with Bennett for many years. He found 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco' for Bennett, a year after placing it in a bureau and forgetting about it. Sharon discovered the manuscript while packing for a tour that included San Francisco. While Bennett and Sharon liked the song, they were convinced it would only be a local hit. The song became Bennett's signature tune. A great jazz pianist in his own right, recording a series of his own albums, Sharon was best known as one of the greatest pianists who backed up singers, including Bennett, Robert Goulet, Chris Connor and many others. Retiring to Boulder, Colorado from on-the-road work with Bennett when he reached 80, Ralph Sharon continued to perform in the Denver metropolitan area until shortly before his death. He and the Ralph Sharon Trio performed at various jazz venues, including Dazzle Restaurant & Lounge in Denver, Colorado. He died March 31, 2015.\" (Wikipedia) Sprache: english. - The Very Thought Of You. Arranged and Featured by Ralph Sharon.",
