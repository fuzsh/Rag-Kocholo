        "text": "Mary Lilace Norris (nee Martin) passed away at her home on August 6, 2024. She was 93 years old. Born on her family farm in Sharon (Forest Hill, MD) Lilace was the daughter of the late Lilburn and Mary (Long) Martin. She was married to her late husband and best friend, William C Norris Jr for 70 years.\n\nBoth Lilace and her late husband worked for the US Postal Service. She was a clerk, a mail carrier and before retiring, she was the Postmaster of the Pylesville Post Office. They both took great pride in their careers.\n\nAfter retirement, Lilace was more of a homebody and except for a few good friends, left most of the socializing to her husband. She enjoyed reading, playing cards and spending time with her family. Her sisters all enjoyed playing Bingo regularly, but Lilace didn’t want to “hang out with old ladies”. In her younger years she took classes to be a pilot and loved to fly but once she got her license, she never flew again. She was just happy with her accomplishment. In all of her 93 years, Lilace never once pumped gas. Her husband always made sure her tank was full for her. They were a good team.\n\nIn addition to her parents and husband, waiting to greet her were her four brothers Frank L Martin, Carl W Martin, Ralph J Martin, J Granville Martin, and four sisters, Ruth M Ayres, Margaret E Hall, Dorothy R Dick and Mildred H Ayres. Imagine that reunion!\n\nThose of us missing her here include her son W Scott Norris, her daughter Kathe (Ralph) Blake, grandchildren Laura (Matt) Caskey, Krista (Eric) Petterson, Stefanie (Kevin) Endres and Michael (Sarah) Blake, great grandchildren Lily, William and Quillan Petterson, Lonni Caskey, Grady, Truitt and Tillman Endres and Oliver Blake, as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nShe never wanted a fuss made over her and requested no services. (She’s probably upset with me for even writing this.) She will be cremated and buried privately with her husband at Deer Creek UMC in Forest Hill."
