        "text": "Sharon Marie Craig, beloved mother, wife and friend, left this world on April 1st, 2020 after an 8-year battle with Breast Cancer. Born in Portland, OR Sept 14, 1961 to LeVerne and Ervin Neff, Sharon is survived by her husband Richard \"Rick\" Craig, her mother Le' Mengis, sister Lisa Ivy, brother Kevin Penney, daughters Brittany “Leha” Green, Brandy Green, Cathy Ryan, Stephanie Craig, and grandson Gabriel Ryan. Her father Ervin Neff, brother Hans Neff, and Uncle Ralph Neff predeceased her.\n\nAdditional surviving family members are niece Kaneischa Johnson, grandniece Aria Salazar, nephews Eli Moody and Maliko Minnieweather, aunts Elaine Brown and Bonnie Neff, cousins Steve Brown (Jackie), Cynthia Seiffert, Loreen Brown, Janet Hendrickson, Nancy Pierce (Roger), Lanette Clayton (Dan), Teanne Jones, Celene Gohsman (Greg) and Monty Neff (Jeanne).\n\nMost people who knew Sharon laugh, knowing how fitting it is that she left us on April Fool’s Day. She absolutely loved to laugh, always pulling pranks on family and friends. Sharon was blessed with a warm, caring heart and had a genuine zest for life that was contagious and unabashedly shared. At Hudson Bay High School, she received the Most Spirited award in honor of the Eagle mascot costume she created and wore during all school events.\n\nSharon was graced with a huge heart, loving not only her family and friends but her animals as well. During her life, she had a variety of pets consisting of 3 cockatiels, 1 rabbit, and 5 cats. Her first 2 were from Wales, Duchess and Toffee, then later Babie, Ervin, and Gladys, the latter 4 being Siamese.\n\nShe had a wide variety of interests. She was an avid foodie and loved traveling, kayaking, glass blowing, high teas, garage series paintings, book club, Bunco, Skip-Bo, and the Naked and Afraid TV show. Most recently she swam with the dolphins in Orlando, attended her London Navy Reunion with her shipmates, was able to celebrate her mother Le’s birthday in Portland last fall, and has frequented Doc Antle’s Myrtle Beach Safari.\n\nHer career highlights include retiring after 20 years of service in the US Navy in 2000, and most recently 19 years as Publication Manager for Sunny Day Guide.\n\nTo know Sharon was to love her. The world is a lesser place without her, but Heaven is shining brighter with her spirit. She was deeply loved and truly missed.\n\nDonations may be made in her name to one of her favorite charities, World Vision at https://www.worldvision.org/donate or The American Cancer Society.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at Rose City Funeral Home in Portland on Friday, August 20th at 2 pm. Donations in her name may be made to World Vision or the American Cancer Society."
