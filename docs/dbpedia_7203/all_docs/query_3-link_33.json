        "text": "The song of the day for Wednesday, July 24, 2024, is “It’s A Sin To Tell A Lie.”\n\nAbout This Song\n\n“It’s A Sin To Tell A Lie” was written by Billy Mayhew in 1936 and was originally introduced by Fats Waller. It’s been recorded by artists from Billie Holiday to Steve Goodman to Slim Whitman to Patti Page. And, of course, Tony Bennett.\n\nAbout This Version\n\nTony Bennett recorded “It’s A Sin To Tell A Lie” on March 26, 1964, for his album When Lights Are Low. The Ralph Sharon Trio accompanied Bennett on this album, with Sharon on piano, Hal Gaylord on bass, and Billy Exiner on drums. Sharon also wrote the arrangement.\n\n“It’s A Sin To Tell A Lie,” as well as When Lights Are Low, is available on Apple Music.\n\nThe song of the day for Saturday, April 20, 2024, is “When Lights Are Low.”\n\nAbout This Song\n\n“When Lights Are Low” was written in 1936 by Benny Carter and Spencer Williams, while both Carter and Williams were living and working in Europe. Carter was the staff arranger for BBC during that time.\n\nAbout This Version\n\nTony Bennett recorded “When Lights Are Low” on March 26, 1964, for the album When Lights Are Low, which was released sixty years ago today on April 20, 1964. Bennett was accompanied by the Ralph Sharon Trio: Sharon on piano, Hal Gaylord on bass, and Billy Exiner on drums. Sharon also wrote all the arrangements for the album.\n\n“When Lights Are Low,” as well as the album When Lights Are Low, is available on Apple Music.\n\nThe song of the day for Tuesday, March 19, 2024, is “Ain’t Misbehaving.”\n\nAbout This Song\n\n“Ain’t Misbehaving” was written in 1929 by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks, with lyrics by Andy Razaf. Fats Waller introduced “Ain’t Misbehaving” in the 1929 musical revue Connie’s Hot Chocolates, staged at Connie’s Inn in Harlem. Andy Razaf, the lyricist, says that Waller wrote the entire song in just 45 minutes. It has become one of Waller’s most well-known songs, perhaps due to the wildly successful Broadway musical revue Ain’t Misbehaving, which opened in 1978.\n\nAbout This Version\n\nTony Bennett recorded “Ain’t Misbehaving” on March 26, 1964, for his album When Lights Are Low. The Ralph Sharon Trio (Sharon on piano; Hal Gaylord on bass; Billy Exiner on drums) accompanied Bennett for this recording; Ralph Sharon wrote the arrangement.\n\n“Ain’t Misbehaving,” as well as When Lights Are Low, is available on Apple Music.\n\nThe song of the day for Wednesday, November 8, 2023, is “Autumn Leaves.”\n\nAbout This Song\n\n“Autumn Leaves” was composed in 1945 by Joseph Kosma, with French lyrics by Jacques Prévert. Johnny Mercer wrote English lyrics in 1947. Known as “Les feuilles mortes” (The Dead Leaves) in the original French, the English song is known as “Autumn Leaves.” Mercer wrote the lyrics in 1947 and Jo Stafford was the first artist to record the song with the English lyrics. Other notable recordings include those by Edith Piaf and Nat King Cole.\n\nAbout This Version\n\nTony Bennett recorded “Autumn Leaves” on October 14, 1964, for his album Who Can I Turn To. George Siravo wrote the arrangement. The recording features The Ralph Sharon Trio (Sharon on piano, Hal Gaylord on bass, and Bill Exiner on drums).\n\n“Autumn Leaves,” as well as the album Who Can I Turn To, is available on Apple Music.\n\nThe song of the day for Thursday, August 24, 2023, is “They Can’t Take That Away From Me.”\n\nAbout Today\n\nThe Year of Tony Bennett wishes Elvis Costello a very happy birthday! Costello was born in London, England on August 25, 1954.\n\nAbout This Song\n\n“They Can’t Take That Away From Me” was written by George and Ira Gershwin for the 1937 Fred Astaire–Ginger Rodgers movie Shall We Dance. Unlike most songs that Astaire introduced in his films, there was no dance number associated with “They Can’t Take That Away From Me.” It is one of the Gershwin’s finest love songs. George Gershwin died just two months after this film was released.\n\nAbout This Version\n\nTony Bennett and Elvis Costello recorded “They Can’t Take That Away From Me” on April 12, 1994, for Bennett’s legendary MTV Unplugged appearance. The MTV Unplugged album was released in June of that year.
