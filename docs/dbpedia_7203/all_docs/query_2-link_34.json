        "text": "£6.99 each\n\nTwo wonderful Double CDs by legendary pianist, arranger and band leader Ralph Sharon constitute exciting additions to AVIDs Essential Collection series.\n\nBorn in London in 1926 Ralph Sharon is arguably one of the great unsung heroes of British popular music. Playing with such British greats as Ted Heath, Ronnie Scott and Victor Feldman before leaving for the USA where after becoming an American citizen he went on to become musical director and accompanist to Buddy Rich, Rosemary Clooney, Mel Torme, Carmen McCrae, Peggy Lee and most famously Tony Bennett.\n\nOn these delightful recordings Ralph is joined for the first time in 40 years by old sparring partners Jack Parnell on drums and Lennie Bush on bass to pay tribute to some of the greatest songwriters America has ever produced. All three musicians play as if they had just left off all those years before as they tip their hats to the music of Cole Porter and Jerome Kern, offering us music of the very highest standard.\n\nCD1\n\nThe Magic Of Cole Porter\n\n1.
