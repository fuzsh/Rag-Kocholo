        "text": "Deal Overview\n\nOn February 10, 2022, Brookfield Asset Management Inc.’s (NYSE: BAM, $56.44, Market Capitalization: $88.2 billion) CEO Bruce Flatt in a letter to shareholders, following the 4Q21 announcement, revealed that the company is considering options, including spinning off its asset management business into a separate public company. Post Separation, the asset management division will be a pure-play alternative investment firm that would generate revenues through the collection of management fees from institutional investors. On the other hand, BAM will focus on growing its newly launched reinsurance and investment operations through $50 billion (net of debts) directly owned assets across real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, credit, and private equity.\n\nDuring the 4Q21 conference call, the management clarified that if they pursue separation, it will be independent security and a listed company, not a tracking stock. However, the parent entity would continue to own a part of the separated entity and initially distribute a quarter or a third part of the business to its shareholders.\n\nBAM believes separating its asset management business would provide the unit with further growth avenues. Consequently, the BAM parent unit will look to grow its reinsurance and investment operations and opines that separating a part of the asset manager, would allow investors to own separate security that would be a “asset light” business model.\n\nWhile BAM conveyed its intention to separate the asset management business, it will be evaluating various options (including possibly doing nothing) that will maximize value for various stakeholders. The company is going to provide further information in due course of time, while it also seeks views from the public and shareholders regarding separation.\n\nBased on comparable multiples of pure-play, “asset-light” alternative investment managers, BAM estimates its asset management business would likely to have an equity value in the range of $70 to $100 billion (or $45-$60 per share). This excludes the equity capital of $50 billion net (or $30 per share) that BAM has invested in various businesses.\n\nIn July 2021, BAM completed the acquisition of all of the limited partnership units of Brookfield Property Partners LP (Nasdaq: BPY) in a deal valued at $6.5 billion, taking its real estate arm private. This deal has strengthened BAM’s overall real estate portfolio. BPY owns, operates, and develops one of the largest portfolios of real estate across the globe that includes, office, retail, multifamily, logistics, hospitality, triple net lease, manufactured housing, and student housing.\n\nIn September 2019, BAM completed the acquisition of the majority stake in Oaktree Capital Group in a deal valued at about $4.7 billion. This deal has strengthened BAM’s overall fee-bearing alternative asset portfolio and broadened product offering.\n\nDeal Rationale\n\nBAM expects separation of asset management business would simplify the company’s structure and allow shareholders to own a business that would be an “asset-light” model. Currently, the asset management business also manages BAM’s $50 billion of directly owned net assets that the parent entity has been able to accumulate over the decades through retention of profits as well as growth in asset values.\n\nBAM in its shareholder letter highlighted that their current business model makes it “asset-heavy” as compared to most other asset managers which are “asset-light” as those are either recently established or have distributed their profits annually to their owners. The management believes distributions from its $50 billion owned investment capital to shareholders, would easily turn their business asset-light, but this capital has proved to be their operating strength. However, the management believes that their current structure makes it difficult for an investor to value the company.\n\nBlackstone Group, one of the most valuable private equity groups does not represent any direct investments on its balance sheet as all their investments are done through an investment vehicle under asset management, which receives management fees for managing investments. On the other hand, BAM being “asset-heavy” derives significant value from their directly owned assets. We believe, directly owned assets are relatively difficult to value. As a result, BAM has been trading at a lower multiple compared to Blackstone in recent years. In our view, separation of asset management business would unlock enormous amount of shareholder value as it would be easier to value the company and attract higher multiples.\n\nIn addition, in its shareholder letter, BAM highlighted that its asset management business is one of the largest and fastest-growing scale alternative investment businesses globally. Over the years, the business has shown tremendous growth and profitability, supported by BAM’s internal capital. The management believes the assets management unit has become self-sustaining, where its annuity-like cash would allow it to operate independently without much dependence on internal capital.\n\nWe believe the acquisition of Oaktree Capital in 2019 was an inflection point for BAM’s asset management business, post that it was able to significantly broaden its offerings across various strategies. The overall fee-bearing capital across the alternative asset classes grew from $126 billion in 2017 to $364 billion in 2021. Fee-related earnings (excluding performance fees) more than doubled from $754 million in 2017 to $1,742 million in 2021. The management opines, now the business has reached to compelling growth stage, where it could strategies upon future growth options as many of their previous strategies are continuously getting larger with each vintage and are compounding on each other.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management (BAM) is a leading global alternative asset management company with ~$690 billion asset under management and presence in 30+ countries across five continents. The company’s segments include Asset management, Real estate, Renewable power and transition, Infrastructure, Private equity, Residential development, and Corporate activities.\n\nAsset Management\n\nThe segment manages $364.1 billion of fee-bearing capital, including $169.3 billion in long-term private funds, $114.6 billion in perpetual strategies and $80.2 billion in Liquid strategies on behalf of investors.

In July 2021, BAM completed acquisition of all of the limited partnership units of BPY, taking the company private. Currently, BPG’s preferred units are listed on Nasdaq and Toronto Stock exchanges under ticker BPY. BPG own and operate iconic properties globally, and its portfolio includes office, retail, multifamily, logistics, hospitality, triple net lease, manufactured housing and student housing.\n\nRenewable Power and Transition\n\nThe company operates renewable power assets through a 48% stake in Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), which is listed on the New York and Toronto Stock exchange.
