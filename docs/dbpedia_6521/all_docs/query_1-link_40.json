        "text": "Douglas Eisenberg, Founder and Executive Chairman\n\nDouglas Eisenberg is the founder and executive chairman of A&E Real Estate, a vertically-integrated real estate management and investment firm with preeminent property management, asset management and construction capabilities. Mr. Eisenberg holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Cornell University and a Juris Doctorate from Brooklyn Law School. Mr. Eisenberg currently is a member of the boards of Montefiore Hospital, New York Junior Tennis League, Randall’s Island Park Alliance, Citizens Committee for New York City and the New York Urban League.\n\nWhat is your favorite landmark in New York State?\n\nStatue of Liberty.\n\nWhat has been your favorite development project and why?\n\nMy favorite project to date is the acquisition and development of Riverton Square in the heart of Harlem. Aside from beautifying and restoring this historic property, it was our honor to dedicate the community center in memory of former NYC Mayor, The Honorable David Dinkins, and his wife, Joyce.\n\nHow did you become interested in architecture, real estate, or construction?\n\nExploring New York City as a child, along with the exposure to real estate through my father’s property management firm, cultivated within me a strong visual acuity of structures, old and new. I’ve always been fascinated with how the interdependence of architecture, real estate, and construction contributes to the development of communities.\n\nWhat is the current state of commercial real estate in New York? What impact has the pandemic had?\n\n2020 saw an exodus of Manhattanites fleeing to the suburbs, putting New York real estate on shaky ground. As the economy has slowly bounced back to pre-pandemic days, so have rent averages. As a die-hard New Yorker, I’m a big believer in this city. New York City is the epicenter of just about everything, as far as I’m concerned — including real estate. The recovery has shown that the city is open for business — big time.\n\nWhat is your favorite place you’ve ever lived?\n\nNew York City — lived here my whole life!\n\nJames Patchett, CEO\n\nJames Patchett is the chief executive officer of A&E and joined the firm in 2021. He is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the firm including operations, investments, financing, capital programs, and dispositions and is a member of the firm’s Management Committee and Investment Committee. Prior to A&E, Mr. Patchett was president and CEO of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Patchett holds a BA in Economics from Amherst College and an MBA from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. He serves on the Board of the Prospect Park Alliance.\n\nWhat is your favorite landmark in New York State?\n\nI love the Empire State Building because it’s the only landmark building my (young) kids recognize. They love to point out the different colors at night from all parts of the city. And we were fortunate to visit it for the first time during the pandemic. It was amazing to go up when there was almost no one else there! (Now that the tourists are back, we probably won’t be!)\n\nWhat has been your favorite development project and why?\n\nI had the pleasure of overseeing Essex Crossing while at EDC. Essex is a major mixed-use development on the Lower East Side with the new Essex Market, a historic neighborhood staple, at its core. I don’t believe there is any more successful or widely supported example of a ground-up development project in the middle of such a dense urban area.\n\nWhat is the current state of commercial real estate in New York? What impact has the pandemic had?\n\nThe impacts really vary based on the asset class. At A&E, we’re fortunate to be in multifamily, which has come through the pandemic in great shape. That being said, the depths of COVID hit both renters and owners very hard.\n\nHow did you become interested in architecture, real estate, or construction?\n\nI first worked “in real estate” in eighth grade when I started a Habitat for Humanity program at my church. From the first time I watched a family move into their new home, I was sold on the importance of housing in changing people’s lives.\n\nWhat is your favorite place you’ve ever lived?\n\nI’ve now lived in Brooklyn for 13 years, which is the longest I’ve ever lived anywhere. There is a reason I’ve stayed so long. Brooklyn has everything.\n\nMaggie McCormick, President\n\nMaggie McCormick is the president of A&E and joined the firm in 2012. Ms. McCormick is actively involved in the strategic direction of the firm and managing all areas of the firm, including operations, investments, financings, capital programs, and dispositions. She is a member of the firm’s Management Committee and Investment Committee. Ms. McCormick holds a BS in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Cornell University. Ms. McCormick is actively involved with Minds Matter, a college-focused program for underprivileged high school students.\n\nWhat is your favorite landmark in New York State?\n\nNew York Public Library – I can’t resist a good library, and as with many things, New York’s is the best.\n\nWhat is the current state of commercial real estate in New York? What impact has the pandemic had?\n\nNYC is back and has been back, with commercial real estate picking up steam. The pandemic obviously had an effect and sped up the exodus of some New Yorkers, but since mid-2021 we’ve seen that New Yorkers want to be here more than ever.\n\nHow did you become interested in architecture, real estate, or construction?\n\nI was a structural engineering major who wanted a career in a dynamic, social, and fast-paced industry. After meeting and working with Douglas very early in my career, I found that real estate was a great place to combine my logical, problem-solving mindset with my desire to get out from behind my desk and work with different people every day.\n\nWhat is your favorite place you’ve ever lived?\n\nNew York, of course.\n\nVincent Altieri, a principal in Berdon LLP’s Audit Department with more than 15 years of experience, serves clients in a broad array of industries, most notably in the real estate and real estate-related sectors. He has also provided tax and accounting services to retail enterprises, nonprofit organizations and foundations, wholesalers, and professional service firms. Vincent graduated from Fordham University with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting. He has been licensed as a Certified Public Accountant in New York since 2003.\n\nWhat is your favorite landmark in New York State?\n\nThis may be recency bias, but this past weekend I visited the Summit at One Vanderbilt. Complete 360-degree views of Manhattan, from the Chrysler, Metlife, The Empire State, One World Trade, and Central Park, you can see it all. They also have a great terrace, bar, and art exhibits. All in all, a fantastic experience.\n\nWhat has been your favorite development project and why?\n\nBeing involved in the revitalization of Hotel Chelsea has been my most rewarding project. Seeing all the pieces come together, culminating with a recent stay with my wife for our anniversary, and seeing a preview of the end result has been very fulfilling. The attention to detail in construction, down to the furniture and artwork is astounding, and the recently re-opened El Quixote and its food and ambience are nothing short of spectacular.\n\nWhat is the current state of commercial real estate in New York? What impact has the pandemic had?\n\nI believe we are at a crossroads. While development and outlook are still strong, the long-term effects of the pandemic are still unknown. While NYC seems revitalized, tenants have yet to return to the office full-time and have assumed a hybrid workforce, which I believe will continue indefinitely. Much of this relates to pricing, but the main cause is a generational shift in thinking and transition of power. If this trend continues, we will see usage change of many existing asset classes, more amenities, work-life play, landlords investing in ideas to attract tenants to the office on a regular basis.\n\nHow did you become interested in architecture, real estate, or construction?\n\nIn my travels to Italy and other parts of the world, I always loved and admired the attention to detail in architecture and marveled how such large projects came together. Since college, when I began my career at Berdon, it sort of fell into my lap. Given Berdon’s vast wealth of knowledge in this area and in working with multiple generations of real estate families, as I continued to grow at the firm, my experience further renewed my interest and love of real estate.\n\nWhat is your favorite place you’ve ever lived?\n\nI’ve been a New Yorker for my entire life, currently residing in White Plains. Although I’ve traveled extensively, NY will always be my home. Given the access to theater, music, arts, food, and culture, I’ve never had the desire to live anywhere else."
