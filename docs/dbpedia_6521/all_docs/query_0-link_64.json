        "text": "Manhattan, one of the five boroughs of New York City, is often considered the heart and soul of the city. It’s an island bordered by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers and is the most densely populated borough. Manhattan is renowned for its iconic skyline, bustling streets, cultural institutions, and as a global financial center. It is divided into Lower, Midtown, and Upper regions, each with its unique characteristics and attractions. From the financial hub of Wall Street to the bright lights of Times Square and the tranquil paths of Central Park, Manhattan offers a diverse array of experiences for residents and visitors alike.\n\nThe Heart of New York City: Exploring Manhattan\n\nManhattan is the most densely populated and geographically smallest of New York City’s five boroughs, coextensive with New York County. This tiny island near the southern tip of New York state is the urban core of not just New York City, but the entire Northeast megalopolis.\n\nHome to only 22.66 square miles of land, Manhattan manages to pack in over 1.6 million residents, making it one of the most populated places on Earth. At a density of 72,918 people per square mile, it epitomizes urban density and dynamism.\n\nManhattan serves as New York City’s economic engine and houses key administrative infrastructure like City Hall. It has rightfully earned descriptions as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment nucleus of New York and even the wider world.\n\nFrom its early days as a Dutch trading post called New Amsterdam in the 1600s, Manhattan has steadily grown into a global metropolitan hub. It came under British rule in 1664 and was rechristened New York, eventually becoming the first capital of the United States from 1785 to 1790.\n\nMajor landmarks today reflect the island’s history as America’s largest port of entry for immigrants in the 1800s, like the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. Various neighborhoods have also left cultural marks, like Greenwich Village’s Stonewall Inn catalyzing the modern gay rights movement.\n\nGeographically, Manhattan is interlaced with waterways and urban infrastructure. It comprises three sections divided lengthwise – Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. The Hudson, East, and Harlem Rivers border it, along with urban islands like Roosevelt, Randall’s, and Ward’s Islands.\n\nAnchoring its lower area is Wall Street in the Financial District. This cements Manhattan’s status as the premier global city for finance through the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and major banks/firms. It also boasts top educational institutions like Columbia and NYU and landmarks including Times Square, Central Park, and the United Nations headquarters.\n\nIn essence, Manhattan constitutes New York’s cultural soul and economic engine. Its nonstop energy and dynamic urban fabric imbue New York City with a cosmopolitan, fast-paced identity that has made the city so iconic. Exploring Manhattan offers a crash course in New York’s best attributes.\n\nHighways in Manhattan\n\nFDR Drive\n\nWest Side Highway (NY-9A)\n\nHarlem River Drive\n\nInterstate 95 (I-95)\n\nInterstate 78 (I-78)\n\nColleges in Manhattan\n\nColumbia University – 116th St & Broadway, 10027\n\nNew York University (NYU) – 70 Washington Sq S, 10012\n\nFordham University Lincoln Center – 113 W 60th St, 10023\n\nThe City College of New York (CUNY) – 160 Convent Ave, 10031\n\nHunter College (CUNY) – 695 Park Ave, 10065\n\nParks in Manhattan\n\nCentral Park – 59th to 110th St, 10026\n\nBryant Park – 6th Ave & W 41st St, 10018\n\nThe High Line – Gansevoort St to 34th St, 10011\n\nWashington Square Park – 5th Ave & Waverly Pl, 10012\n\nBattery Park – State St & Battery Pl, 10004\n\nAirports in Manhattan\n\nNote: There are no airports within Manhattan.
