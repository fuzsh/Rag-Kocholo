ACTION: Announcement of funding awards. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: In accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, this announcement notifies the public of funding decisions made by the Department under the HUD-Administered Small Cities Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program for Fiscal Year 1995. The announcement contains the names and addresses of the award winners and the amount of the awards. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Rhodeside, State and Small Cities Division, Office of Community Planning and Development, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 7184, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, Telephone (202) 708-1322 (voice) or (202) 708-2565 (TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (the HCD Act), authorizes the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. Section 106 provides that HUD will administer the CDBG Program for nonentitled units of local government within a State which does not elect to assume the administrative responsibility for the program. As such HUD, continues to operate the nonentitlement CDBG Program in Hawaii and New York in accordance with 24 CFR part 570, subpart F. In Hawaii, HUD distributes funds in Hawaii on a formula basis since there are only three nonentitlement entities. In New York State, HUD conducts an annual competition in which nonentitled units of general local government may apply for nonentitled CDBG funds allocated to New York State. The Fiscal Year 1995 competition in New York State was announced in a notice of funding availability (NOFA) published in the Federal Register on December 5, 1994 (59 FR 62474). The NOFA announced the availability of allocation of $50,616,000 for nonentitled communities in New York State. The NOFA also announced the allocation of this funding amount between the New York Office and the Buffalo Office. In accordance with section 102 (a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, the Department is publishing the names and addresses of the grantees, and the amount of the award made to each grantee. This information is provided in Appendix A to this document. Dated: August 30, 1995. Andrew Cuomo, Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.
