        "text": "Join us for an engaging evening with Miya Ando, winner of the 2023 Brookfield Place New York Annual Arts Commission, and Ami Vitale, a Nikon Ambassador and National Geographic photographer, who will discuss their environmentally focused art exhibitions currently on view at Brookfield Place. The artist talk will be followed by a reception with light bites, beer and wine. The panel will be moderated by Kendal Henry, who has thirty years of curating experience, specializing in public art projects across the globe, including Ando’s artwork at Brookfield Place. The artists will discuss their observations and documentation of climate change and conservation facilitating a thoughtful conversation about the future of our planet.\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n5:45 PM – Check-in opens\n\n6:00 PM – Artist Talk\n\n7:00 PM – 2024 Brookfield Place New York Annual Arts Commission Announcement\n\n7:00 – 8:00 PM: Light bites, wine, beer & networking\n\nRSVP at ArtisticReflections.rsvpify.com.\n\nABOUT MIYA ANDO\n\nMiya Ando’s artworks are a physical articulation of the artist’s contemplation of the cycles of nature and the passage of time; concept, image, and materials are inextricably linked in the artist’s work. The layered, refractive surfaces of Ando’s sculptures and paintings on metal or wood, mirror the impermanent, ephemeral nature of their subject, which is often fleeting natural phenomena: the seasons, day, night, clouds, tides — materialized in ink, pigment, micronized silver, gold, mica, oil, or resin. Ando frequently chooses multilingual titles for her artworks— a Japanese word and its approximate English translation — to reveal the variations in thought and perception between the two cultures which have informed her identity and experience. Ando’s titles contain nuanced, arcane or literary Japanese words naming and describing the varied qualities of moonlight, rain, clouds, and other elements — language that expresses a relationship to nature and a philosophy of existence not present in the West, which the artist preserves and translates into visual form through her art.
