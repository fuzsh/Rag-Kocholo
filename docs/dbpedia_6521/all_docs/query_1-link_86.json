        "text": "lafayette.JPG\n\nLaFayette eighth-graders listen to a presentation during a field trip at the Onondaga Lake Visitors Center in November. LaFayette is listed as the most fiscally stressed school district in Central New York in a comptroller's report released today.\n\n(Ellen M. Blalock | eblalock@syracuse.com)\n\nEditor's note: The initial version of this story incorrectly listed the Onondaga Central school district as \"susceptible to fiscal stress.\" The list should have included the Oswego school district, not Onondaga Central.\n\nTwenty-three percent of Central New York school districts are suffering \"fiscal stress,\" the state comptroller's office said in a report released this morning.\n\nThat's the highest percentage of districts in any region of the state. Statewide, 13 percent are fiscally stressed, the report says.\n\nThe most highly stressed districts in Central New York are LaFayette, DeRuyter, Skaneateles and Brookfield.\n\nThose districts are in \"moderate fiscal stress\" -- the second most serious category in the comptroller's report. No Central New York districts are in the highest category -- \"significant\" stress -- although LaFayette comes close.\n\nNYS schools' financial ratings: What should taxpayers take away from them?\n\nLaFayette has the 14th highest fiscal stress level of the 674 districts in the comptroller's report.\n\nSeven area districts are at a lesser level of stress, termed \"susceptible to fiscal stress.\" They are North Syracuse, Cazenovia, Southern Cayuga, Morrisville-Eaton, Cincinnatus, Tully and Oswego.\n\nStatewide, 12 school districts were classified as in \"significant fiscal stress,\" 23 in \"moderate fiscal stress\" and 52 as \"susceptible to fiscal stress.\"\n\nThe ratings do not include the big-city districts of Syracuse, Buffalo, Rochester or Yonkers. Those will come out later this year.\n\nThe ratings are an extension of a \"fiscal monitoring system\" launched by Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's office. The comptroller already has released fiscal stress levels of the state's municipalities.\n\nThe comptroller said most school districts found to be in fiscal stress are operating with low fund balances, operating deficits and limited cash on hand. They also have a much higher likelihood of using short-term borrowing to bridge cash flow gaps, the report said.\n\nThe report said many factors outside a district's control can drive costs up and revenues down. They include declining property values, high poverty rates and low school budget support."
