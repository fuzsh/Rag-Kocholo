        "text": "For towns in New York, see List of towns in New York.\n\nThis is a list of municipalities in New York other than towns, which includes all 533 villages and 62 cities of New York. Of the 533 villages and 62 cities, there are 590 non-town municipalities in New York, plus five coterminous town-villages, villages that are coterminous with their town.\n\nAt the time of the 2010 United States Census, the state of New York had 555 villages. Since then, 21 villages were dissolved (four in Cattaraugus County, three in Oneida County, two each in Chautauqua County, St. Lawrence County and Wayne County, one each in Essex County, Jefferson County, Seneca County, Washington County and Oswego County as well as Keeseville in Clinton and Essex counties), while one new village was created in Suffolk County (Mastic Beach). After only seven years of being incorporated, the Village of Mastic Beach dissolved on December 31, 2017. The village of Van Etten in Chemung County and the village of Harrisville in Lewis County were both dissolved on December 31, 2018, while the village of Morristown in St. Lawrence County was dissolved on December 31, 2019. Although still listed in the 2022 population estimates from the US Census, the village of South Nyack, New York was dissolved on April 1, 2022, and the village of Fort Johnson was dissolved on December 31, 2023.\n\nMost municipalities in New York are located within a single town and county, but some municipalities are located in more than one town. Of those, there are two cities and eight villages located in more than one county:\n\nGeneva, in Ontario & Seneca Counties, although the portion in Seneca County has no population and is entirely
