        "text": "Yes, you can certainly take a tour of the space before signing up for a membership. In fact, it’s encouraged, to help you get a feel for what your workday will look like. by filling out the form along with the date and time when you would like to visit the space and we’ll see you there.\n\nStorage in coworking spaces can be limited, with most of it reserved for members with dedicated desks and private offices. However, you can reach out to the coworking operator using the form on the right side of the page to see what options are currently available.\n\nAbsolutely. Flexibility is one of the best parts of coworking. Most coworking memberships are month-to-month, so you can quickly adjust your space preferences according to your unique requirements and the size of your team. Whether that means upgrading the space or downsizing it or even completely changing the type of coworking subscription that you use, you always have the option to adjust as you go.\n\nIt may be possible to adjust your membership before current membership ends, but you will have to discuss and negotiate directly with Regus, who is more than happy to help out.\n\nMost, if not all, amenities are available to you as a member, regardless of the type of membership. Some shared spaces, like the meeting rooms, need to be booked in advance and private offices are only available for those with a subscription. However, all the other areas, like the lounge, kitchen and breakout spaces, are usable by every member. All complimentary services are available and anything ancillary can be purchased or negotiated with Regus."
