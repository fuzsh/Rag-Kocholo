        "text": "Saks Fifth Avenue will announce on Wednesday that it is making a major commitment to Lower Manhattan by opening a new Saks Fifth Avenue department store, opening Manhattan’s first Off 5th outlet store, and moving its United States headquarters to the heart of New York’s financial district.\n\nThe move, which is being done with tax incentives from the city and state, is the latest sign of revitalization efforts downtown. Saks is expected to announce that it will open a four-floor, 85,000-square-foot store to anchor Brookfield Place, an enormous office and retail complex in Battery Park City across from the World Trade Center. The store will be its second location in Manhattan, aside from its flagship store on Fifth Avenue.\n\nIn addition, the Hudson’s Bay Company, the parent company that owns Saks Fifth Avenue, will consolidate into 400,000 square feet at Brookfield Place. The public company currently leases about 550,000 square feet across eight locations in Manhattan, and will move into its new headquarters sometime in mid- to late 2016.\n\nAs part of the deal, the retailer will also open its first Off 5th outlet store in Manhattan, with 55,000 square feet at One Liberty Plaza. The site, which fronts Church Street and is across from the discount retailer Century 21, is currently occupied by Brooks Brothers.\n\nIn return for choosing Brookfield Place, Hudson’s Bay Company will receive $3 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits from New York State’s Empire State Development. That money will be tied directly to the relocation of 1,850 existing jobs downtown, as well as the creation of up to 800 new jobs over five years. The company will also receive $9 million through the federally funded Job Creation and Retention Program, a grant offered jointly by the state and the New York City Economic Development Corporation.\n\nAs a result of the office lease, Brookfield Place, formerly called the World Financial Center, which consists of 8.5 million square feet spread across five buildings, is now 95 percent leased.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
