For example, two towns may have determined that rather than exist as two separate municipal entities, consolidating into a single town would result in tax savings or service efficiencies.\n\nCommunities considering consolidation may be eligible for a Local Government Efficiency grant to assist with studying the feasibility of consolidation or to assist with the consolidation itself."
