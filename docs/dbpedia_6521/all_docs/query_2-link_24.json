        "text": "NEW YORK, NY — March 9, 2020 — Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (“Brookfield”) announced today that the reorganization of Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: INF) into Brookfield Real Assets Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: RA) (the “Reorganization”) was completed prior to the open of the New York Stock Exchange on March 9, 2020.\n\nIn the Reorganization, RA acquired all of the assets and liabilities of INF in a tax-free transaction in exchange solely for newly issued RA common shares, which were distributed by INF to its stockholders in the form of a liquidating distribution. RA common shares issued to INF stockholders have an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of INF’s common shares outstanding as of the close of trading on March 6, 2020. Each stockholder of INF received the number of RA common shares corresponding to his or her proportionate interest in the common shares of INF, less the costs of the Reorganization. Fractional common shares of RA were not issued and consequently cash will be distributed for any such fractional amounts.\n\nRelevant details pertaining to the Reorganization are as follows:\n\nThis press release is not intended to, and shall not, constitute an offer to purchase or sell shares of RA, the surviving fund in the Reorganization.
