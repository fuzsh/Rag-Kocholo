        "text": "Maximizing the cultural value of every project we undertake\n\nOur placemaking philosophy, which we refer to as the Brookfield Properties experience, is how we transform our urban vision into enduring value, for our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. We believe our multi-disciplinary process turns the key attributes of a property — its location, infrastructure, design, public spaces, etc. — into a greater whole: a place people want to be.\n\nHow we create one-of-a-kind experiences\n\nIt starts with a holistic civic and social strategy to integrate all “uses” into authentic new districts or existing neighborhoods, so connections between people and place flow organically. It grows through our ongoing commitment to curating the human experience: from world-class shopping, events and public art to food, dining and wellness - all attuned to the needs and values of the tenants, residents and visitors we serve. And finally, it is achieved by our global placemaking expertise: a deep understanding of each stakeholder involved; an in-house, fully integrated team dedicated to surprising and delighting those who visit our properties; and the long-term application of best practices from the most successful mixed-use locations in the world.\n\nPlacemaking in Western Australia\n\n205K square metres across four properties\n\n340+ tenant engagement activities\n\n35+ placemaking activations annually\n\nThe Brookfield Properties experience at Brookfield Place Perth\n\nBrookfield Place is one of Perth’s most iconic precincts, bringing together modern office spaces, curated dining, world-class shopping and cultural experiences. The precinct has grand indoor and outdoor public spaces which are activated year-round through a mix of art installations and cultural events, bringing together a diverse array of tenants, residents and visitors. We believe crafting bespoke, unique experiences for our stakeholders help our tenants with employee retention, increase the cultural value of the neighborhood for our local residents and create unforgettable experiences for visitors.\n\nAt Brookfield Place Perth, we are focused on six key pillars of placemaking: wellbeing, sustainability, arts and culture, community, memorable moments and diversity. Activations that act as a cross-section for a majority of these pillars - such as those focused on key local causes and traditions - receive strong support from our City and neighbors alike.\n\nStay up-to-date with events at Brookfield Place Perth"
