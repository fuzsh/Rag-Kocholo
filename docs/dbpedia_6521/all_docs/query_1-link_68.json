        "text": "Lea Ceramiche’s mesmerising surfaces for Starbucks Brookfield Place (NY)\n\nBrookfield Place, one of New York’s most iconic destinations, is home to a shop belonging to the famous US Starbucks chain.\n\nStarbucks Reserve is located in one of the city’s most dynamic districts – constantly crowded with office workers, shoppers and tourists – comprising five skyscrapers of different sizes, ranging in height from 80 to 225 metres. Overlooking the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan, the complex is one of the main financial centres in the metropolis and visiting it is a bit like entering a city within a city: inside there are offices, shops, restaurants, squares and gardens.\n\nLea Ceramiche’s contribution\n\nExquisite surfaces were selected for the café to create a cosy, inviting atmosphere. The Delight collection was used to cover the wall behind the counter and the counter itself, revealing the story of four sophisticated marbles selected from among the finest in the world in a complete ceramic project, including new tactile sensations, large formats and stunning decorations.\n\nSpecifically, a marble effect was chosen in the elegant Calacatta Oro shade, laid in large 6 mm-thick slabs. The result is captivating, sophisticated, and refined. Perfect for a contract space where customers are welcomed into a bright environment characterized by large open windows, striking references to marble – a natural, ancient material – and a distinctly contemporary feel.\n\nThe Delight collection is also part of the PROTECT® line of antibacterial porcelain stoneware floor and wall coverings featuring an effective antibacterial silver ion shield incorporated in the tiles which eliminates up to 99.9% of bacteria from the surface, ensuring safe and protected environments."
