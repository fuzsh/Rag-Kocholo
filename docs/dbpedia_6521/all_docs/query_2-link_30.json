(NYSE:BBU) (TSX:BBU.UN) (\"Brookfield Business Partners\"), together with its institutional partners (collectively “Brookfield”), and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”) today announced a definitive agreement for Brookfield to acquire half of CD&R’s ownership interest in Brand Industrial Services (“BrandSafway” or “Company”). As a result of the investment, Brookfield and funds managed by CD&R will each own approximately 45% of the Company.

BrandSafway has significant runway for growth, both organically and inorganically, and we look forward to supporting management in continuing to execute on their strategic vision for the business.”\n\n“Our entire leadership team is excited about the opportunity to work with CD&R and Brookfield to continue to drive value creation over time,” said Bill Hayes, President and CEO of BrandSafway. “CD&R has been critical to our success in creating the leading access and industrial services player – and now Brookfield brings additional resources, expertise, and insights to continue our global growth.
