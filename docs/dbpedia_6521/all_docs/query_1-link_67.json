        "text": "Jones Day's New York Office offers one-stop shopping, from deals to disputes, to the world's leading banks, private equity firms, and global blue chip companies. Many of the Firm's global practice leaders are based in New York.\n\nWall Street institutions call on Jones Day to counsel them on key M&A, banking, capital markets, bankruptcy, litigation, private equity, tax, and intellectual property matters.\n\nJones Day lawyers have been litigating and trying complex commercial cases for clients, negotiating transactions, and providing regulatory counseling to leading financial institutions related to sophisticated bank products such as CDOs and CDSs since well before the credit crisis.\n\nOur financial regulatory lawyers routinely represent financial institutions and their senior officials in a range of regulatory investigations and proceedings before all relevant U.S. agencies and, quite frequently, in coordination with non-U.S. offices.\n\nMany key global practices are led by partners resident in New York: Financial Markets; Employee Benefits & Executive Compensation; Labor & Employment; M&A; Private Equity; Securities Litigation & SEC Enforcement; and Tax."
