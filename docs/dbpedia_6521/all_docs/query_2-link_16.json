        "text": "Hydro\n\nOur hydro power assets are characterized by a perpetual asset life, high cash margins, and storage capacity.\n\nHoltwood Hydropower produces over 250 MW of clean, renewable & reliable energy, which it sends to the PJM grid. In doing so, this facility provides a baseload of energy and ensures that hospitals, businesses & residences alike in the Lancaster region have the critical power that they need to stay running. The Holtwood Hydropower facility produces enough electricity to serve about 250,000 homes.\n\nLearn More\n\nWind\n\nWind is a freely available, inexhaustible and emission-free source of energy and is one of the fastest-growing renewable generation technologies. The benefits of wind power ensure it will continue to play an increasing role as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\nWe own and operate 22 high quality wind facilities across the U.S. with an installed capacity of 2,448 MW.\n\nLearn More\n\nSolar\n\nUtility-scale solar farms harness energy from the sun to generate electricity. These forms of technology continue to improve – with increased efficiency and lower unit cost, ensuring their place as mainstream electricity sources.\n\nIn 2017, Brookfield Renewable added a premier solar technology platform to its global renewable portfolio through its acquisition of TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global.\n\n* Includes approximately 175 megawatts of assets owned through X-Elio.\n\nLearn More\n\nDistributed Energy Resources\n\nDistributed energy resources (DER) employ smaller scale technologies than a more centralized system to produce power where it is needed. Such onsite, local generation has multiple benefits, including avoided generation capacity costs and avoided transmission costs. It allows consumers greater control over their power supply and potentially reduces their reliance on back-up power.\n\n* Distributed energy resource (DER) facilities may include one or more technologies including distributed solar, distributed storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and microgrids.\n\nLearn More\n\nStorage\n\nStorage systems play an important role in providing flexibility in power markets, particularly with pumped hydro storage which acts as a giant ‘rechargeable battery’ and can range from fast millisecond response services required to stabilize grid systems to reserve products that provide hours of delivery in the event of a power failure.\n\nWe have storage assets of over 600 MW through our pumped hydro and battery facilities.\n\nLearn More"
