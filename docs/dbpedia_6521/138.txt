Hydropower Safety

Safety is a top priority for Brookfield Renewable , and is an essential aspect of doing business.

Brookfield has set very high standards to minimize risks at its hydropower plants.

While these wonderful water resources are producing electricity to help make our lives easier, we remind visitors to any hydropower facility to be aware of safety warning and procedures.

Safety tips for recreating near hydropower facilities:

• Always use a Coast Guard-approved life vest or other approved personal flotation device.

• When boating, kayaking, fishing, hiking or swimming, stay well away from dams, discharges and water intakes.

• Respect all warning signs and devices

• Swim only in designated locations manned by lifeguards.

• Know your physical limitations and abilities.

• In fishing streams, wade with caution and use footwear with non-slip soles.

• Keep water drawstrings tight and never get into a situation in which waders and boots could flood.

• Always keep alert for changes in water levels and currents and move to the nearest shore immediately if water appears to rise.

• Use only designated recreation areas. Do not trespass on the hydroelectric facility site or private property excluded from public access.

• Stay clear of areas designated as no entry zones.

• Properly maintain and extinguish all campfires and extend courtesies to others in public access areas.

• Carry in, carry it out!
