        "text": "Dutch multinational conglomerate corporation\n\nFor other uses, see Philips (disambiguation).\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. (lit. 'Royal Philips'), commonly shortened to Philips, is a Dutch multinational conglomerate corporation that was founded in Eindhoven in 1891. Since 1997, its world headquarters have been situated in Amsterdam, though the Benelux headquarters is still in Eindhoven. Philips was once one of the largest consumer electronics companies in the world, but later focused on health technology, having divested its other divisions.\n\nThe company was founded in 1891 by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik, with their first products being light bulbs. Philips employs around 80,000 people across 100 countries.[2] The company gained its royal honorary title (hence the Koninklijke) in 1998 and dropped the \"Electronics\" in its name in 2013,[3] due to its refocusing on healthcare technology.\n\nPhilips is organized into three main divisions: Personal Health (formerly Philips Consumer Electronics and Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care), Connected Care, and Diagnosis & Treatment (formerly Philips Medical Systems).[4] The lighting division was spun off as a separate company, Signify N.V.\n\nThe company started making electric shavers in 1939 under the Philishave and Norelco brands, and post-war it developed the Compact Cassette, an audiotape format, and co-developed the compact disc format with Sony, as well as numerous other technologies. As of 2012, Philips was the largest manufacturer of lighting in the world as measured by revenue.\n\nPhilips has a primary listing on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Acquisitions included Signetics and Magnavox. It also founded a multidisciplinary sports club called PSV Eindhoven in 1913.\n\nSee also: Philips (family)\n\nThe Philips Company was founded in 1891, by Dutch entrepreneur Gerard Philips and his father Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in Zaltbommel, financed the purchase and setup of an empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has since been adapted and is used as a museum.[6]\n\nIn 1895, after a difficult first few years and near-bankruptcy, the Philips's brought in Anton, Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years. Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips corporation, they laid the foundations for the later multinational.\n\nIn the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as vacuum tubes. For this purpose the Van Arkel-De Boer process was invented.\n\nIn 1924, Philips joined with German lamp trust Osram to form the Phoebus cartel.[7]\n\nOn 11 March 1927, Philips went on the air, inaugurating the shortwave radio station PCJJ (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by a sister station (Philips Omroep Holland-Indië, later PHI). PHOHI broadcast in Dutch to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and later PHI broadcast in English and other languages to the Eastern hemisphere, while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.[citation needed]\n\nThe international program Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the Happy Station show, which became the world's longest-running shortwave program. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in Huizen to use for pro-Nazi broadcasts, some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Philips introduced the \"Chapel\", a radio with a built-in loudspeaker.\n\nPhilips Radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch International Service. Some PCJ programs, such as Happy Station, continued on the new station.\n\nPhilips was instrumental in the revival of the Stirling engine when, in the early 1930s, the management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain. Engineers at the company's research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil – \"cheap and available everywhere\" – was favoured).[8] They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.[9]\n\nEncouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16 W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of 30 mm × 25 mm,[10] various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout World War II. By the late 1940s, the 'Type 10' was ready to be handed over to Philips' subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200 W electrical output from a bore and stroke of 55 mm × 27 mm, was designated MP1002CA (known as the \"Bungalow set\"). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price, besides the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.[11]\n\nIn parallel with the generator set, Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the 'reversed Stirling engine' cryocooler. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.[12]\n\nThe first Philips shaver was introduced in 1939, and was simply called Philishave. In the US, it was called Norelco. The Philishave has remained part of the Philips product line-up until the present.\n\nOn 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German invasion of the Netherlands was to take place the following day. Having prepared for this, Anton Philips and his son-in-law Frans Otten, as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States, taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the North American Philips Company, they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the Netherlands Antilles to keep it out of German hands.[13]\n\nOn 6 December 1942, the British No. 2 Group RAF undertook Operation Oyster, which heavily damaged the Philips Radio factory in Eindhoven with few casualties among the Dutch workers and civilians.[14] The Philips works in Eindhoven was bombed again by the RAF on 30 March 1943.[15][16]\n\nFrits Philips, the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands. He saved the lives of 382 Jews by convincing the Nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at Philips.[17] In 1943, he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at Vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production. For his actions in saving the hundreds of Jews, he was recognized by Yad Vashem in 1995 as a \"Righteous Among the Nations\".[18]\n\nAfter the war, the company was moved back to the Netherlands, with their headquarters in Eindhoven.\n\nIn 1949, the company began selling television sets.[20] In 1950, it formed Philips Records, which eventually formed part of PolyGram in 1962.\n\nIn 1954, Cor Dillen (of the very well known and prestigious Dillen family) (director and later CFO and also CEO) put Philips on the map in South America introducing them to Color television for the first time [21] in most countries of the Americas like Brazil, although Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s when Dillen was named the company's CEO.\n\nPhilips introduced the Compact Cassette audio tape format in 1963, and it was wildly successful. Cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing stenographers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside vinyl records used to sell recorded music.\n\nPhilips introduced the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the \"radio recorder\", and is now better known as the boom box. Later, the cassette was used in telephone answering machines, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for professional needs with the Mini-Cassette, although it would not be as successful as the Olympus Microcassette. This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machines.[citation needed] Philips continued with computers through the early 1990s (see separate article: Philips Computers).\n\nIn 1972, Philips launched the world's first home video cassette recorder, in the UK, the N1500. Its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Later one-hour tapes were also offered. As the competition came from Sony's Betamax and the VHS group of manufacturers, Philips introduced the N1700 system which allowed double-length recording. For the first time, a 2-hour movie could fit onto one video cassette. In 1977, the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the UK, featuring comedy writer and presenter Denis Norden.[22] The concept was quickly copied by the Japanese makers, whose tapes were significantly cheaper. Philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the Video 2000 system, with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time. As Philips only sold its systems on the PAL standard and in Europe, and the Japanese makers sold globally, the scale advantages of the Japanese proved insurmountable and Philips withdrew the V2000 system and joined the VHS Coalition.[23]\n\nPhilips had developed a LaserDisc early on for selling movies, but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales. Later Philips joined with MCA to launch the first commercial LaserDisc standard and players. In 1982, Philips teamed with Sony to launch the compact disc; this format evolved into the CD-R, CD-RW, DVD and later Blu-ray, which Philips launched with Sony in 1997[24] and 2006 respectively.\n\nIn 1984, the Dutch Philips Group bought out nearly a one-third share and took over the management of the German company Grundig.\n\nIn 1984, Philips split off its activities on the field of photolithographic integrated circuit production equipment, the so-called wafer steppers, into a joint venture with ASM International, located in Veldhoven under the name ASML. Over the years, this new company has evolved into the world's leading manufacturer of chip production machines at the expense of competitors like Nikon and Canon.\n\nPhilips partnered with Sony again later to develop a new \"interactive\" disc format called CD-i, described by them as a \"new way of interacting with a television set\".[25] Philips created the majority of CD-i compatible players. After low sales, Philips repositioned the format as a video game console, but it was soon discontinued after being heavily criticized amongst the gaming community.[26][27]\n\nIn the 1980s, Philips's profit margin dropped below 1 percent, and in 1990 the company lost more than US$2 billion (biggest corporate loss in Dutch history). Troubles for the company continued into the 1990s as its status as a leading electronics company was swiftly lost.[28]\n\nIn 1985, Philips was the largest founding investor in TSMC[29] which was established as a joint venture between Philips, the Taiwan government and other private investors.\n\nIn 1990, the newly appointed CEO, Jan Timmer, decided to sell off all businesses that dealt with computers. This meant the end of Philips Data Systems as well as other computer activities. The year after, those businesses were acquired by Digital Equipment Corporation.[30]\n\nIn 1991, the company's name was changed from N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken to Philips Electronics N.V.[31] At the same time, North American Philips was formally dissolved, and a new corporate division was formed in the US with the name Philips Electronics North America Corp.[32]\n\nIn 1997, the company officers decided to move the headquarters from Eindhoven to Amsterdam along with the corporate name change to Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., the latter of which was finalized on 16 March 1998.[33]\n\nIn 1997, Philips introduced at CES and CeBIT the first large (42-inch) commercially available flat-panel TV, using Fujitsu plasma displays.[34][35][36]\n\nIn 1998, looking to spur innovation, Philips created an Emerging Businesses group for its Semiconductors unit, based in Silicon Valley. The group was designed to be an incubator where promising technologies and products could be developed.[37][38]\n\nThe move of the headquarters to Amsterdam was completed in 2001. Initially, the company was housed in the Rembrandt Tower. In 2002, it moved again, this time to the Breitner Tower. Philips Lighting, Philips Research, Philips Semiconductors (spun off as NXP in September 2006), and Philips Design, are still based in Eindhoven. Philips Healthcare is headquartered in both Best, Netherlands (near Eindhoven) and Andover, Massachusetts, United States (near Boston).\n\nIn 2000, Philips bought Optiva Corporation, the maker of Sonicare electric toothbrushes. The company was renamed Philips Oral Healthcare and made a subsidiary of Philips DAP. In 2001, Philips acquired Agilent Technologies' Healthcare Solutions Group (HSG) for EUR 2 billion.[39] Philips created a computer monitors joint venture with LG called LG.Philips Displays in 2001.\n\nIn 2001, after growing the unit's Emerging Businesses group to nearly $1 billion in revenue, Scott A. McGregor was named the new president and CEO of Philips Semiconductors. McGregor's appointment completed the company's shift to having dedicated CEOs for all five of the company's product divisions, which would in turn leave the Board of Management to concentrate on issues confronting the Philips Group as a whole.[37]\n\nIn February 2001 Philips sold its remaining interest in battery manufacturing to its then partner Matsushita (which itself became Panasonic in 2008).[40][41]\n\nIn 2004, Philips abandoned the slogan \"Let's make things better\" in favour of a new one: \"Sense and Simplicity\".[42]\n\nIn December 2005, Philips announced its intention to sell or demerge its semiconductor division. On 1 September 2006, it was announced in Berlin that the name of the new company formed by the division would be NXP Semiconductors. On 2 August 2006, Philips completed an agreement to sell a controlling 80.1% stake in NXP Semiconductors to a consortium of private equity investors consisting of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), Silver Lake Partners and AlpInvest Partners. On 21 August 2006, Bain Capital and Apax Partners announced that they had signed definitive commitments to join the acquiring consortium, a process which was completed on 1 October 2006.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2006, Philips bought out the company Lifeline Systems headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts, in a deal valued at $750 million, its biggest move yet to expand its consumer-health business (M).[43] In August 2007, Philips acquired the company Ximis, Inc. headquartered in El Paso, Texas, for their Medical Informatics Division.[44] In October 2007, it purchased a Moore Microprocessor Patent (MPP) Portfolio license from The TPL Group.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, Philips and Respironics, Inc. announced a definitive agreement pursuant to which Philips acquired all of the outstanding shares of Respironics for US$66 per share, or a total purchase price of approximately €3.6 billion (US$5.1 billion) in cash.[45]\n\nOn 21 February 2008, Philips completed the acquisition of VISICU in Baltimore, Maryland, through the merger of its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary into VISICU.

The company was acquired by Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Wistron in 2009 and it was shut down in 2012, after repeated failed attempts to find a potential buyer.[131][132][133]\n\nPhilips' core products are consumer electronics and electrical products (including small domestic appliances, shavers, beauty appliances, mother and childcare appliances, electric toothbrushes and coffee makers (products like Smart Phones, audio equipment, Blu-ray players, computer accessories and televisions are sold under license); and healthcare products (including CT scanners, ECG equipment, mammography equipment, monitoring equipment, MRI scanners, radiography equipment, resuscitation equipment, ultrasound equipment and X-ray equipment);[134]\n\nIn January 2020 Philips announced that it is looking to sell its domestic appliances division, which includes products like coffee machines, air purifiers and airfryers.[135]\n\nProfessional indoor luminaires[137]\n\nProfessional outdoor luminaires[138]\n\nProfessional lamps[139]\n\nLighting controls and control systems[140]\n\nDigital projection lights[141]\n\nHorticulture lighting[142]\n\nSolar LED lights[143]\n\nSmart office lighting systems[144]\n\nSmart retail lighting systems[145]\n\nSmart city lighting systems[146]\n\nHome lamps[147]\n\nHome fixtures[148]\n\nHome systems (branded as Philips Hue)[149]\n\nAutomotive Lighting[150]\n\nHi-fi systems\n\nWireless speakers\n\nRadio systems\n\nDocking stations\n\nHeadphones\n\nDJ mixers\n\nAlarm clocks\n\nPhilips healthcare products include:\n\nCardiology informatics (IntelliSpace Cardiovascular, Xcelera)\n\nEnterprise Imaging Informatics (IntelliSpace PACS, XIRIS)\n\nIntelliSpace family of solutions\n\nCardio/Vascular X-Ray Wires and Catheters (Verrata)\n\nComputed tomography (CT)\n\nFluoroscopy\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nMammography\n\nMobile C-Arms\n\nNuclear medicine\n\nPET (Positron emission tomography)\n\nPET/CT\n\nRadiography\n\nRadiation oncology Systemsroots\n\nUltrasound\n\nDiagnostic ECG\n\nAutomated External Defibrillators\n\nPortable Monitor/Defibrillators\n\nAccessories\n\nEquipment\n\nSoftware\n\nPhilips AVENTil\n\nAnesthetic gas monitoring\n\nBlood pressure\n\nCapnography\n\nD.M.E.\n\nDiagnostic sleep testing\n\nECG\n\nEnterprise patient informatics solutions\n\nOB TraceVue\n\nCompurecord\n\nICIP\n\neICU program\n\nEmergin\n\nHemodynamic\n\nIntelliSpace Cardiovascular\n\nIntelliSpace PACS\n\nIntelliSpace portal\n\nMulti-measurement servers\n\nNeurophedeoiles\n\nPulse oximetry\n\nTasy[152]\n\nTemperature\n\nTranscutaneous gases\n\nVentilation\n\nViewForum\n\nXcelera\n\nXIRIS\n\nXper Information Management\n\nThe famous Philips logo with the stars and waves was designed by Dutch architect Louis Kalff (1897–1976), who stated that the emblem had been created as a coincidence as he did not know how a radio system worked.[153]\n\n1938–68\n\n1968–2008[154]\n\n2008–13\n\n2013–present\n\nWordmark (1968–2008)\n\nWordmark (2008–present)\n\nTrust In Philips Is Worldwide (1960–1974)\n\nSimply Years Ahead (1974–1981)\n\nWe Want You To Have The Best (1981–1985)\n\nTake a Closer Look (1985–1995)\n\nLet's Make Things Better (1995–2004)\n\nSense & Simplicity (2004–2013)\n\nInnovation & You (2013–present)\n\nIn 1913, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands, Philips founded Philips Sports Vereniging (Philips Sports Club, now commonly known as PSV). The club is active in numerous sports but is now best known for its football team, PSV Eindhoven, and swimming team. Philips owns the naming rights to Philips Stadium in Eindhoven, which is the home ground of PSV Eindhoven.\n\nOutside of the Netherlands, Philips sponsors and has sponsored numerous sports clubs, sports facilities and events. In November 2008, Philips renewed and extended its F1 partnership with AT&T Williams. Philips owns the naming rights to the Philips Championship, the premier basketball league in Australia, traditionally known as the National Basketball League. From 1988 to 1993, Philips was the principal sponsor of the Australian rugby league team The Balmain Tigers and Indonesian football club side Persiba Balikpapan. From 1998 to 2000, Philips sponsored the Winston Cup No. 7 entry for Geoff Bodine Racing, later Ultra Motorsports, for drivers Geoff Bodine and Michael Waltrip. From 1999 to 2018, Philips held the naming rights to Philips Arena in Atlanta, home of the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association and former home of the defunct Atlanta Thrashers of the National Hockey League and from 2024 Philips became a sponsor for a la liga team known as FC Barcelona\n\nOutside of sports, Philips sponsors the international Philips Monsters of Rock festival.\n\nIn June 2021, Philips announced a voluntary recall of several of its Respironics ventilators, BiPAP, and CPAP machines due to potential health risks. Gradual degradation of foam in the devices, intended to reduce noise and vibrations during operation, could result in patients inhaling particulates or certain chemicals.[155] The recall involved around 3 to 4 million machines which, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to a supply chain crisis impeding the availability of these devices to patients.[156] Originally, Philips described the risks as potentially \"life-threatening\" but that there had been no reports of death as a result of the issues.[157] Since then, the FDA has received 385 reports of death allegedly caused by the foam issue.[155]\n\nIn 2023, ProPublica and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Philips had received thousands of patient reports and returned machines affected by the degrading foam as far back as 2010, and many of these reports were not disclosed to the FDA as Philips was legally obligated to do.[158]\n\nIn October 2022, dozens of lawsuits against Philips related to the safety concerns were consolidated into one class-action lawsuit. Philips settled this lawsuit in September 2023 for at least $479 million.[159] In January 2024, Philips agreed to halt the sale of any new sleep apnea devices in the U.S. as part of an agreement with the FDA. As part of the deal, Philips would need to meet certain conditions in its U.S. manufacturing plants, a process that Philips CEO Roy Jakobs could take five to seven years.[160]\n\nPhilips and its CEO, Frans van Houten, hold several global leadership positions in advancing the circular economy, including as a founding member and co-chair of the board of directors for the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE),[161] applying circular approaches in its capital equipment business,[162] and as a global partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.[163]\n\nPhilips was a member of the 1925 Phoebus cartel along with Osram, Tungsram, Associated Electrical Industries, ELIN [de], Compagnie des Lampes, International General Electric, and the GE Overseas Group,[164] holding shares in the Swiss corporation proportional to their lamp sales. The cartel lowered operational costs and worked to standardize the life expectancy of light bulbs at 1,000 hours[165] (down from 2,500 hours),[165] and raised prices without fear of competition. The cartel tested their bulbs and fined manufacturers for bulbs that lasted more than 1,000 hours.\n\nPhilips also runs the EcoVision initiative, which commits to a number of environmentally positive improvements, focusing on energy efficiency.[166]\n\nAlso, Philips marks its \"green\" products with the Philips Green Logo, identifying them as products that have a significantly better environmental performance than their competitors or predecessors.[167]\n\nIn 2011, Philips won a $10 million cash prize from the US Department of Energy for winning its L-Prize competition, to produce a high-efficiency, long operating life replacement for a standard 60-W incandescent lightbulb.[168] The winning LED lightbulb, which was made available to consumers in April 2012, produces slightly more than 900 lumens at an input power of 10 W.[169]\n\nIn Greenpeace's 2012 Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are, Philips ranked 10th of 16 companies with a score of 3.8/10.[170] The company was the top scorer in the Energy section due to its energy advocacy work calling upon the EU to adopt a 30% reduction for greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. It was also praised for its new products which are free from PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Philips' sourcing of fibres for paper, arguing it must develop a paper procurement policy which excludes suppliers involved in deforestation and illegal logging.[171]\n\nPhilips has made some progress since 2007 (when it was first ranked in the guide started in 2006), in particular by supporting the Individual Producer Responsibility principle, which means that the company is accepting the responsibility for the toxic impacts of its products on e-waste dumps around the world.[172]\n\nIn 2016 Philips introduced a series of LED-Lamps with an efficiency up to 200lm/W.[173][174] The Dubai Lamp produces 600 lumens at an input power of 3 W.[175][176]\n\nA.
