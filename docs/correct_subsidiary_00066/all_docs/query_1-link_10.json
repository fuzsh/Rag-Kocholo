        "text": "Royal Philips Electronics announced that it will commence a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of VLSI Technology at a price of $17.00 per share. According to the company, the offer represents a 58% increase in value over current VLSI shares, which were values at $10.75 per share on February 25.\n\nPhilips announcement comes one day after VLSI announced that its board of directors would hold off making a decision about the proposed merger until later in March (see VLSI Co-Develops Bluetooth Processor, Evaluates Philips Merger Proposal). In the release, VLSI stated that it needed more than four days to properly evaluate the proposal.\n\nIn response, Philips says it encouraged by VLSI's statement that its board of directors has an open mind concerning the Philips offer. However, given the compelling nature of the offer and Philips' desire to quickly complete such a mutually beneficial transaction, Philips has decided to take its offer directly to VLSI shareholders.\n\nIn order for VLSI shareholders to receive the benefits of the offer, Philips intends to request that the VLSI board of directors redeem the VLSI rights plan or otherwise take action to render the plan inapplicable to Philips' offer. In the event the VLSI board does not dismantle the rights plan, Philips plans to take the necessary steps to replace the VLSI board with nominees who, subject to their fiduciary duties, would allow the Philips offer to proceed.\n\nThe tender offer, which will begin tomorrow, will expire at midnight Eastern Time on Thursday, April 1, 1999, unless extended."
