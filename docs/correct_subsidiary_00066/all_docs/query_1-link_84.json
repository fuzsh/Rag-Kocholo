        "text": "Introduction\n\nUV900, the new volume tuner, 1990\n\nThe previous Philips volume TV tuner generation was the UV600, introduced in 1985, using the solid one-piece Zamac frame and introducing the TDA5030 mixer-oscillator IC. The first models used were pre-scaler-based in the high end CTV sets (2A, 2B and 3A from the Brugge fab) but gradually the bulk of the models used became VST without pre-scaler, driven by the need for lower cost in the mid-end chassis (CP90, CP110, G90AE from Dreux, as well as the Overseas GR1AX chassis). The need for cost reduction lead to the parallel introduction of the 700-family, again in folded metal frames, of smaller size and with discrete MO. Whereas the high-end segment continued with the UV816 that introduced the full PLL next to the MO-IC, this covered only a fraction of the Philips TV volume: high-end volume was around 100k sets per year of the total 12Mio sets produced annually by Philips. It is thus obvious that the next tuner family for the mid- and low-end segments had to provide a serious cost reduction compared to the UV60o/700, not to the much more expensive UV800. This became the - in the end - very successful UV900 tuner family.\n\nA single piece UV900 frame before being folded into shape. This is a \"reverse unfolded\" frame, therefore not entirely flat and some punched contours can be seen, mostly for holding the PCB. Multiple folding steps were required to assemble the complete frame. [Hugo Duran collection]\n\nOne of the main innovations in the UV900 was the new metal frame. The one-piece Zamac frame was definitively dropped, and replaced by 0,5mm thick tin-plated metal sheet frame. However, where metal sheet frames had been used before (ELC2000, UV400, UV700) they were always assembled from multiple pieces. The UV900 introduced the single-piece frame, which was stamped from a single sheet and then in a number of punching steps formed into the assembled frame. For most of the tuners the printed circuit board (PCB) was made from epoxy-filled glass fibre FR4, which provided the best compromise in RF performance, thermal expansion matching with the metal frame and resistance to humidity. The holes for the circuit vias were drilled and metallized-through together with the tracks on both sides, while the rectangular slots for the wire pins, frame tags and the final contour were stamped out. The different connectors, either IEC, IEC-long, phono or F, were soldered to the frame and fixed with two tags. The PCB, after SMD component placement, was clicked fix into the frame. All in all this made the mechanics a major cost reduction element of the UV900 family, and most of these elements were to be re-used in the next generations.\n\nA UV915E. The cover contacts on the solder side (A-side) were soldered after alignment and final test, to avoid fretting corrosion.

It carries both the Philips 12nc (3139 147 10381) as well as the Magnavox code 340313-0001. [Hugo Duran collection]\n\nAlthough there were in the end 22 different UV900 basic types (excluding the high-end types that will be treated separately), the general architecture can be summarized as follows:\n\nMost tuners were full 3-band, so no switched-2B as used in the UV600 linked to the TDA5030 MO-IC. All tuners again used discrete mixer-oscillators. The exception were the UV933/34 for Latam, which used a large-range 2-band concept to tune the VHF with one varicap from 55-211MHz.\n\nOf most basic models both a VST and PLL version were available. Only the very first UV916 also offered pre-scaler based FST initially, but I haven't seen any practical use of this type and I suppose it was quickly dropped. The PLL IC was the same Philips TSA5510 as used in the UV816. However, the TSA5510 had problems with I2C cross-talk into the PLL control signal, which gave a lot of design and application headaches, and in many products the more robust Plessey SP5510 was used. Only when the improved TSA5512 appeared around 1993 it replaced the 5510 PLLs if a Mk2 version was deemed economical. (A re-design was needed because the TSA5510 was in an SO18 package, while the TSA5512 used SO16).\n\nThe intricate 3B input circuitry was the same as used in the UV816, using coupling varicaps between the pre-filter and MOSFET input for mid and high band. The MOSFETs were the latest BF998 for low and mid band, and BF990 for UHF. The Singapore-designed off air tuners (UV913, UV953) would use the cheaper Sanyo 3SK189.\n\nAll tuning diodes were still leaded glass varicaps, which were at the time the cheapest. They were hand inserted like all other leaded components (mainly the air coils). However, the UV900 family was very successful and lived for almost ten years. Towards 1996 a serious issue with glass diode supply emerged, Philips Semiconductors (the Business Line Discrete Semiconductors in Hamburg) starting end-of-life procedures for its glass diodes, the varicaps first. Tuners still running in volume by that time, specifically the UV915 and U944, therefore had to be redesigned to replace the glass varicaps by then standard SOD323 plastic packaged types.\n\nThe UV916E/IEC-long. The 916 was one of the main runners of the family, together with its UV915E VST counter part and the UV936E for the US market. The glass varicaps are clearly visible. The long IEC connector was used for mechanical backward compatibility with the UV800. From the point of mechanical robustness this was obviously not a very popular construction. [Oswald Moonen collection]\n\nThe solder side (A-side) of the same UV916E with all SMD's and the SO16 PLL IC. This is therefore a Mk2 version, no longer using the TSA5510.

Note the much tighter design rules and the associated less crowded lay-out. [Electroda.PL]\n\nAlthough the UV900 tuners were conceptually all identical, there were of course some variations and specialities across the family.\n\nThe US tuners were almost 100% PLL, which was due to the local practice to have TV users directly choose the real channel number, which can only be accomplished using a tuner PLL. The UV935 was thus hardly sold and the UV936 was the standard US tuner. (Due to the high volumes and the low end US TV market it was also always the tuner with the highest price pressure). But the UV936 also had its issues, because in 1993 the FCC issues a new ruling with respect to radiation (the Cenelec equivalent), which required the UV936 to have around 10dB lower radiation at its pins. This problem was only solved after quite some design efforts.\n\nThe UHF-only UK tuners always were the oddities in every tuner family. Within the UV900 family the electrical design was for once less of an issue, since a discrete 1-band could easily be derived from the discrete 3-band. The mechanics were, however, deemed too expensive and for the U943 a smaller frame was designed, 38mm high instead of the standard 46,5mm. For the U944 the PLL was added on a small sub-PCB. Later new Cenelec-approved UK models were developed, the U943C and U944C, which re-used the standard 46mm tuner frame, albeit in combination with single-sided PCBs for some cost compensation.\n\nThe UV900 family was the first to provide full global coverage of all existing standards. To make the tuners standard-specific usually meant either a different frequency coverage (e.g. no VHF-I for South Africa in the UV973/4) or different IF (the new 36,875MHz Australian VIF and a lowest frequency of 45,75MHz) that could fairly easily be derived from the UV916 or UV936. Nevertheless they all required dedicated different filter settings and alignment, and were thus distinctly separate models.\n\nThe biggest deviation was found in the Japanese UV980 models, with its substantially higher 58.75MHz VIF, and associated different band edges. These were expensive models, requiring dedicated design for a market where Philips had minimal sales due to the local Japanese vendor dominance. Interestingly, the Japanese tuners still used separate inputs for VHF (a phono connector) and UHF (two 300 Ohm balanced pins), just like the old PCEC tuners had. The first models where the UV983 and UV984, which had one drawback: close to the very high power Tokio TV transmitter they showed non-linearity due to the varicap curves. This was solved in the later UV988 using back-to-back varicaps as in the UV916M.\n\nTowards the end of the UV900 generation, when it started to overlap with the UV1300 successor, the need for market compatible steps grew, for example reduction of the 12V supply to 9V. The long-running models UV915, U943 and U944 thus all saw 9V versions towards the late 1990s.\n\nThe UV900 was the largest ever tuner family made by Philips, comprising of 22 different basic models as shown in the table. 12nc-level diversity was a factor 3 higher due to connector and other options.\n\nOne of the first Philips TV groups to use the UV900 tuners was Overseas, for their 1992 GR1 global chassis. This is the small 14\" screen 14GX1227, which used the UV917 VST S-band tuner. [RadioMuseum.org]\n\nInterior view of the same 14GR1227, with the tuner just visible left next to the HT-transformer. [RadioMuseum.org]\n\nThe UV900 family was very successful, produced in very large numbers, and throughout the 1990 decade the cash cow of the BU Tuners. The first models UV917 and U943 were introduced in 1990 by the Overseas organization in their already running GR1.AX chassis, replacing the UV617 and U743. The next year the UV900 was the tuner used in the GR2 chassis, while the UV933 and 935 were used in the GR1.L Latam chassis. But the real volumes came with the use in Philips low end chassis between 1991 and 2000, the Anubis-A (1991), Anubis-S (1992/3), Anubis A5 (1995), Mid1.1 (195) and Low L6.1 (1996) with combined volumes of some 12Mio sets per year. The Philips BG-TV was extremely conservative as we've seen earlier, being very slow in introducing such innovations as I2C-bus, one-chip TV ICs and for the tuner the PLL function. As a consequence the bulk of the tuners were still VST: UV915 for the hyper-band countries (France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, Ireland), UV917 for the S-channel countries (Germany, Netherlands, Austria and southern Europe), UV913 for cheap off-air sets and the U943 for the UK. Sets for non-European countries used the UV933 (Latam), UV953 (China, Russia, Eastern Europe), UV963 (Australia and New Zealand) and UV973 (South Africa). UV916 PLL tuners were used sporadically for featured sets within the chassis, while the US PCEC Magnavox sets all used the UV936. The only real PLL chassis in this period were the Overseas G8 and G88, using the UV914, UV916, UV936, UV964 and UV974.\n\nThe Anubis low end platform was, next to regular square grey low end TVs, also used for some more exotic designs. This is the Anubis-B 21PT350. [Marcels TV Museum]\n\nThe UV917 in the 21PT350 as shown left. Note that the tuner is located directly next to the EHV transformer, and therefore shielded with a thick metal plate. [Marcels TV Museum]\n\nAnother creative design, the 14AA3324 \"Book\", based on the Anubis-A. Both sets shown here were produced in Monza, Italy.\n\nThe low end Philips chassis L6, from 1996, was the last to be based on VST tuning, using the UV913/15/17. This one, the 14PT1405, was produced in Hungary.\n\nOverview of the European tuners within the Philips UV900 tuner family. Colours in the last column refer to Philipc CTV (red), Philips VCR (blue) and TV-VCR combo (purple). Black are external customers.\n\nAnother application of especially the UV916E was VCR. The first Philips VHS decks used the UV416 and UV616 tuners, but in 1988-89, for reasons unknown to me, a wave of Sharp and Panasonic decks was in-sourced, thus reducing the Philips tuner content to zero. With the Jasmin chassis in 1990, however, the UV916E was introduced, with the U944C for UK decks. Compared to the UV616 the UV916E must have provided an appreciable price reduction for the very cost sensitive VCR business. Up to and including the 1995 Olivia platform the UV916E was used without interruption, only the UK version migrated to the cheaper U944E.\n\nThe UV936E was the absolute main runner of the family, seeing uninterrupted use in all PCEC/Magnavox chassis in the US as well as many global low end and Overseas chassis. The last platform to introduce the UV936 was the G88 in 1995-1997, meaning 7 years of new design-ins. In that period the UV936E remained essentially unchanged, apart from the TSA5510, 5511 and 5512 upgrades.\n\nAs mentioned, the main volume of the UV900 family, in fact 70%, were the VST types, although within that category there was a steady shift from off-air (UV913) and S-channel (cable, UV917) to hyper band (UV915). However, the large volumes and de facto standardization on a number of main types (UV915, UV916 and UV936) also meant a serious price erosion. The sales price of UV915 had declined from its introduction in 1990 to 1997 from 20 to 10Hfl (roughly 14 to 7USD), while the UV916E price declined from 25 to 13Hfl (17 to 9,5USD). With the UV900, tuners unavoidably started to become a commodity component, much more driven by price than performance.\n\nBecause (low end) TV's had to be cheaper and cheaper, the tuner had to follow.

[Obsolete Telly]\n\nSecond part of the Philips UV900 tuner family, all non-European types.\n\nTuner theory 10: filtering and tracking\n\nA number of developments in the tuner applications required a much tighter control of the tuner frequency characteristics, most importantly the so-called \"tilt\", or flatness of the bandpass characteristic under tuning. Two mechanisms play an essential role in providing the overall tuner frequency characteristic as measured at the IF output:\n\nthe intrinsic shape and flatness of the combined selective bandpass filters. In practice this is the multiplied characteristic of the input matching filter and the selective bandpass filter (BPF), where the aim is to have the dual-tuned BPF be the determining element, while the single-tuned input filter provides a less critical (i.e. slightly broader) constant filter characteristic.\n\nthe tracking between the BPF central frequency and the local oscillator (LO) frequency.\n\nWe'll start with the BPF characteristic.\n\nThe main difference between a tuner and a more classical receiver (radio, today especially telecom like mobile phones and WiFi) is the much larger tuning range. Especially with hyper-band the frequency ratio of low and mid band is typically 3,5 (from 48 to 170MHz) and 2,6 (175 to 450MHz). The challenge is to keep the BPF characteristic constant while tuning over such a large frequency range. For tuning a frequency ratio of 3,5 a varicap with a ratio of 3,5^2=11,5 is required, but this roughly 10-fold variation in C gives a sqrt(10)=3,3 in variation of the Quality factor Q. The illustration on the right shows that for a constant ideal filter characteristic the product kQ should be 1 or slightly higher. As we will see 1-1,2 is the ideal value. How to achieve this?\n\nBandpass characteristic of a dual-tuned BPF, as a function of the coupling factor k.\n\nThe practical implementation of a double-tuned BPF for 2 octave tuning. At the bottom an example is given for a combined VHF-I and III BPF, using typical values for a such a design.\n\nCompared to the theoretical BPF from the first figure, a more practical BPF is designed as shown on the left. The capacitance C is now variable, and effectively the varicap variance. R is the parasitic series resistance of the varicap. Two elements have been added to \"shape\" the characteristic under tuning: a foot inductor Lk and a top capacitor Ct. With the foot inductor the mutual coupling between the two main BPF inductors can be accurately set, as per the diagram upper right. This ensures a constant k over frequency, independent of magnetic coupling. However, as can be seen in the left figure, kLQ increases linearly with the frequency and on its own would give a rapidly degrading BPF characteristic with kQ>>1. Therefore the top capacitor is introduced, which, for increasing frequency, essentially starts to bridge the BPF. As the formula shows, the net kQtot (green dotted line) is the difference between the inductive kQ (red line) and the capacitive kQ (purple line). As the formula also shows Lk and Ct can be individually tuned to engineer the kQtot to maximum flatness across the band. First Lk is set such the kLQ at the low end of the band is 1, then Ct is tuned to achieve the same at the upper end of the band. Ideally kQtot then varies between 1 and 1,2 across the whole band under tuning, thus providing a stable BPF characteristic.\n\nAssuming the BPF had the right characteristic (kQ) over the entire tuning range, the next challenge is local oscillator tracking. Only if the LO frequency is exactly the intermediate frequency (IF) higher than the centre of the BPF will the properly filtered input signal be mixed down to the IF. In case the LO is not correct, say 5MHz too low, the input signal 5MHz below the BPF centre frequency will appear at the output of the IF filter. At this frequency the transfer characteristic of the BPF is obviously much lower in amplitude and rotated in phase, leading to serious signal distortion.\n\nTo make an oscillator be exactly the IF higher than the input frequency over roughly 2 octaves is the real challenge of tuner design. To achieve this the BPF and oscillator tank circuit, although conceptually identical parallel tuned circuits, must be adapted and adjustable. The figure on the right shows the basic main inductor Lp and varicap Cvar in parallel for both, but now each with two added elements: a padding capacitor Cpad and a parallel capacitor Cpar. Understanding the concept is easier using a numerical examples, in this case again for a low band tuning from 50 to 170MHz.\n\nFor the BPF the Cpad is so much larger than the varicap capacitance that effectively it plays no role. So in a first step Lp is adjusted to 165nF such that at the lowest tuning voltage (Cvar = 60pF) the filter centre is at 50MHz. But without the Cpar the upper tuning edge would now be 219MHz (165nF // 3,2pF). With Cpar the upper band edge can now be tuned to the targeted 170MHz (blue line), essentially by reducing the integral capacitor variance from 60 to 3,2pF to 60 to (3,2//2,1)=5,3pF. Any deviations due to e.g. parasitics can be tuned out with Lf.\n\nThe oscillator is now more complex. The varicap only (red line) gives an LO tuning from 68 to 294MHz. The padding capacitor is first used to fix the low edge of the band to slightly above the target 50+38,9=89MHz (the orange line). With the parallel capacitor the tuning curve can now again be rotated to the correct upper band edge of 209MHz (green line). It can be verified that the two tuning curves are now exactly 39MHz apart for all varicap capacitances.\n\nExplanation of the tuning alignment of the BPF centre frequency (left) and local oscillator (right). By adjusting the inductor Lp first and then the capacitances the proper tuning curves can be obtained. Numerical values for a low band example. For simplicity all curves are drawn as straight lines, in practice they can be slightly curved, depending upon the varactor C(V) curve shape.\n\nAn illustration of the tuner tracking mechanism. These are simulations on the UV936 NTSC tuner, using the circuits on the left including detailed parasitics (not shown). With the varicap capacitance changing from 13 to 2pF the entire UHF range is covered with a constant IF of 45,75MHz (with a 1MHz error). Note the non-linear relation between Cvar and the filter centre frequency and thus the tuning voltage. The centre graphs show the nominal filter and tank characteristics. However, outside their target band they both feature resonances in the 30-400MHz domain, shown upper right for the BPF. Especially strong unwanted signals at the positive spurious resonance can result in so-called breakthroughs. [Philips Tuner Development Report \"Theoretical Model for UHF tuner circuit\", Hans Brekelmans, February 1993 via Martin Barnasconi]\n\nThe explanation above is based on a single filter section. In practice alignment is much more complex due to the dual-tuner BPF, parasitics that will make the curves less ideal (especially at increasing frequencies towards UHF), unwanted magnetic coupling between inductor coils, and the possible influence of the parallel bands that are not in use but nevertheless can passively load the active band. And then there is always the need to align and tune for other parameters like image rejection. For the latter a very small \"vane\" capacitor is put across the entire BPF and tuned for a attenuation maximum at the LO frequency (2x38,9=77,8MHz above the BPF centre, especially for N+9 in UHF. This then also gives additional N+5 suppression required for Cenelec. Another issue in the above analysis is the assumption and prerequisite that the varicap values under tuning in both the BPF (with at least 2 varicaps!) and the LO are exactly identical. A serious challenge!\n\nThese analyses and examples are all taken from the \"Accumulated Tuner Knowledge\" book that was written within the BU Tuners Development organisation, containing much more detailed and extensive analysis of these type of tuner characteristics.\n\nVaricap developments, 1980-2000\n\nAlthough much of the focus of the tuner key components increasingly goes to ICs, the MOSFET and varicaps should not be forgotten. They also showed consistent innovation at this component level. Let's start with the varicap, also based on the previous analysis on tracking. Since the introduction of the BB105 varicap in 1968, 3 more generations were introduced until 1990. In that period varicaps had been optimised per band (VHF-I, -III and UHF) where especially in view of first the S-channels and then hyper-band the tuning ranges were seriously stretched. It also meant the full voltage range for the capacitive tuning of the varicap was needed, so from 0,5 to 28V. The latest varicaps (the BB130 family) had a lowest capacitance of 2-2,5pF at 28V. The differences were in the range, where VHF required the largest range. The BB132 for VHF-I thus had a maximum capacitance of up to 75pF, and a capacitive range (C(0,5)/C(28) of 25-30. Because the filter frequency changes with the square root of C that gives a theoretical range of 5-5,5 in frequency. As we've seen in the previous chapter this reduces to a factor 3,5 after alignment, the margin is needed to guarantee tuner alignment in all practical cases of component tolerances and value spreading. UHF diodes like the BB134 didn't require such high ratios (typically 8,5-12) but focused on low parasitics and especially series resistance.\n\nTo achieve these wider tuning ranges quite some process engineering was required. Multiple implantation steps with different doping materials and levels were made to arrive at the overall doping profile that provided the requested C(V)-curve. One of the main requirements of the C(V) curve is to avoid unwanted filter de-tuning in case of large input signals. Because the C(V) curve is non-linear, large input signals could give an asymmetrical output signal with a \"DC capacitive component\" delta-C, see the figure on the right. It can be shown that in order to make Delta-C zero the C(V) curve needs to have a third order shape, which can be achieved through proper optimization of the varicap doping profile. In production the Philips varicaps were therefore characterized at 9 different voltages to guarantee the C(V) curve had the proper shape.\n\nThe last step in varicap optimization is then the device-to-device matching. As the previous section has shown, in the ideal case the two varicaps in the BPF and in the LO tank circuit (and to a lesser extent the pre-filter varicap) should all have exactly identical C(V) curves for proper LO and filter tracking. The target for this matching was defined as <0,5%, a major challenge. There was one relaxing factor though: the matching is required only for the four varicaps in one tuner, between sets of varicaps for different tuners the spread can be roughly 1.5%.\n\nFigure explaning the relation between varactor characteristic C(V), its possible effect on filter de-tuning in case of large input signals, and how this can be avoided by having the proper 3rd-order curve that can be realized through proper doping profile engineering of the varicap.\n\nThe small plastic leaded packages of the BB130-40 and BB170-80 varicap families. [Philips Semiconductors Data Sheets]\n\nMatching levels that were achievable through optimal on-wafer uniformity process control were in the order of 2,5-3% across all devices on a wafer. Around 1980 the BB809 and BB909 were the first varicaps delivered with such guaranteed matching. Obtaining sets of <0,5% matched diodes required additional selection, which was done using the Direct Measurement Assembly (DMA) method. In this case all diodes on a wafer were individually characterised at three voltages (0,5, 10, 13,5 and 28V), and then individually selected to form closely matched series when put in the reel. In the first generation DMA diodes (BB132-134) four consecutive diodes had a guaranteed match of <1,0% in VHF (BB132), <0,7% in VHF-III (BB133) and <0,5% in UHF (BB134). This matching was maintained in groups of at least 50 diodes, and per reel there were less than 15 different groups. This generation varicaps also introduced the 1,7x1,3mm-size SOD323 miniature plastic package.\n\nThe very tight matching requirements of the BB132-134 family was driven by the need for very low tilt D2MAC and digital tuners, especially the UV916M. However, with increasing price pressure for the regular tuners the focus shifted from extreme matching to lower cost and footprint. The BB145-146 set was an intermediate step, pushing for extreme tuning range for the switched 2-band tuner, the BB147-152 was the regular family for the UV1300 family. At the same time matching requirements were reduced to <2% mismatch over 15 devices. The BB178-182 family was the next generation, introducing the 1,2x0,8mm SOD523 plastic package. In the meantime, like for most key components, a dual sourcing policy had established Hitachi as the other varicap supplier, where the two companies (Philips Semiconductors and Hitachi) were forced to offer exact copies of each others devices. So when Hitachi introduced the improved HVU202A, 300A and 363A Semiconductors was forced to release the BB149, 152 and 153. This dual sourcing in turn gave a big price pressure on the components, and in the end a varicap, despite its advanced engineering and matching, cost an average 2,5$ct. With this the varicap had essentially reached the end of its development. There was no need to improve it further, given the good matching and tuning curves, and there were no opportunities for real cost breakthroughs. The last step that happened was the move to an even smaller SOD523 package, but the varicap dies remained the same. And so the BB178, BB179 and BB182 were effectively the last tuner varicaps developed by Philips. They would therefore become the standard components for all successive tuner generations, including the frontends and digital tuners. As late as 2008 they were still the components of choice in new tuners.\n\nOverview of the different generations tuner varicaps produced by Philips Semiconductors. Note that the BB178-179-182 family was the last one developed specifically for tuners. They were used without interruption for all Philips tuner families until 2010!\n\nNew MOSFETs, 1985-2000\n\nThe MOSFET remained the critical input device, the first active element after the passive antenna matching filter. The primary role is still that of low noise pre-amplifier, while secondly it provides the RF Automatic Gain Control (AGC). Like that of the varicap, the basic concept of the MOSFET never changed: it was a dual gate MOSFET tetrode, with mostly two identical FETs stacked in a cascode configuration. Because MOS transistors are extremely sensitive to Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) each gate is protected by two anti-series diodes to substrate that will conduct in case of high surges on a gate. The first rounds of innovation in MOSFETs were purely technology based: in the slipstream of the rapidly improving IC-technologies and the associated production technologies, also MOSFETs were manufactured using increasingly more advanced process technology. Where the initial devices still used around 5um gate length technology, with the 3rd, 4th and 5th generation this reduced to roughly 1,2um (BF998), 0,9um (BF904) and 0,5um (BF1101).\n\nAnother technology breakthrough was the introduction of enhancement mode FETs. The first three generations MOSFETs were depletion mode, meaning that the gate-source voltage of a FET was negative, especially during AGC gain reduction. This always required complex biasing schemes. With an enhancement mode lower FET the Ug1s is always positive, making biasing much more convenient. This was introduced with the BF998, which also introduced the all-band MOSFET. It was immediately applied in the UV800 and UV900, where it was used for ten years in massive numbers.\n\nThe higher current densities and lower parasitics associated with the smaller scale technologies could be used to optimize performance. Initially this was focused on getting more gain (transconductance) until that reached 40mS at 8V Uds. However, it turned out that with 40mS the gain had become too high, leading to higher cross-modulation distortion. So the transconductance finally settled on 30mS at 5V supply, while the technology margin was then used to improve the noise figure, which over the generations reduced from 2,8dB to 1,0-1,1dB at 800MHz.\n\nConcept of the 3rd generation dual-gate RF MOSFET family BF990-BF998. Typical voltages are given for the nominal condition of maximum gain for depletion type (orange) and enhancement type (green) lower MOSFET.\n\nThe new internal current mirror MOSFET bias scheme for improved x-modulation performance. The graphs are for the much used BF1101. The left graph shows the on (green) and off (red) operating points under band switching. [Philips Semiconductors BF1101 data sheet]\n\nThe next innovation was the introduction of an internal current mirror inside the MOSFET package. This current mirror was a scaled version of the main dual gate MOSFET, but operating at a substantially lower drain current of 30-50uA. Because the current mirror drain was connected to G1, this became also the G1 current. External bias resistor Rg1 set the current mirror bias; for typical settings see the figure left. The main purpose of the internal biasing is to maintain optimal cross-modulation performance under gain control. Again, Rg1 and the mirror current can be used to vary the actual performance, but the figure shows that for typical 120kOhm Rg1 the cross-modulation is better than 90dBuV for the interferer, and improving for increasing gain reduction. The small peak at about 7dB gain reduction is due to a resonance between the Miller capacity Cgd and the gm of the first FET.\n\nThe functionality of the MOSFET had now stabilized to a 5V 12mA setting, resulting in 30mS transconductance (and thus a voltage gain of 0,03RL), band switching using Vgg coming from the open collector band switch drivers within the PLL IC, and finally more than 40dB gain control range by reducing Vg2 from the nominal 4V to 1,5V. And all that for around 4$ct!\n\nA last step was the introduction of twin MOSFETs for VHF, with two devices plus biasing on a single die. The SOT363, although now 6-pin, kept the same external dimensions as the previous 4-pin SOT343. Overall this gave a significant 30% materials and assembly saving.\n\nOverview of the MOSFET packages in the period 1985-2000. [Philips Semiconductor BF998, BF1101 and BF1204 Data Sheets.]\n\nOverview of the Philips Semiconductors tuner dual-gate MOSFET families and types. Most types are used as single band variable gain amplifiers. The BF1107 and 1108 are passive loop-through switching MOSFETs. The SOT363 types are dual MOSFETs, combining two bands.\n\nUV900 high-end tuners, 1991-1995\n\nTowards 1990 the Tuner business had a dilemma. The UV816 of the existing family was maybe the best tuner in the world, but much too large and too expensive. The new UV900 family described above had only one objective: cost reduction, and in order to achieve that had dropped the mixer-oscillator (MO) IC and returned to discrete implementations, accepting some performance degradation compared to the UV816. However, a number of high-end customers remained, essentially demanding high performance for UV900 compatible prices. Especially Sony-Europe, out of its Pencoed (South Wales, UK) design centre and factory, had been using Philips tuners for many years, mostly in its top line Trinitron chassis: the UV417, UV616 and UV816. The UV916H (H for high performance) was defined to fulfil this requirement, and was, at least initially, the only MO-IC tuner within the UV900 family.\n\nConceptually the UV916H was predominantly a migration of the UV816 concept, using the TDA5330 MO-IC, to the smaller 900 housing. The use of a MO-IC in principle improved cross-modulation, LO-pulling and LO-feed-through due to higher isolation. The main innovation in the UV916H was the new TDA5630 3-band MO-IC, which, compared to the TDA5330 of the UV816, had the supply voltage reduced from 12 to 9V. This supply voltage reduction, however, had serious design repercussions and resulted in linearity problems, which took multiple re-designs by the Semiconductors team to solve. At the same time the TDA5630 also showed some considerable improvements, due to the use of simplified 2-pin (and for UHF 3-pin) oscillators. The IC no longer required an external IF filter between the mixer input and SAW driver output, saving 4 pins, although this required more subtle output matching of the IF.\n\nOther than that the UV916H used the same MOSFETs (BF998 and BF990) and varicaps as the mainstream UV900 tuners. But due to the MO-IC the performance showed a number of improvements:\n\n2dB lower Noise Figure in mid and high band;\n\n4dB better in-channel cross-modulation, and around 15dB improvement for N+/-2, N+/-3 and N+/-5;\n\nspecified low LO radiation on all pins and the antenna connector.\n\nAfter the UV916H European version was finished, in the Singapore lab a US version was derived, the UV936H, which was only used in very limited numbers in projection TV sets of PCEC Knoxville.\n\nBlock diagram and application of the TDA5630 9V MO-IC that was introduced in the UV916H.

In the lower right corner the 7 interconnect contacts to the IF are visible, when the tuner is used as part of the FQ900-Mk2 front end. [Pieter Hooijmans collection]\n\nBoth the UV916H and UV916M were very good tuners, fulfilling the most stringent requirements for any analogue television application. However, the market for high end television was small compared to the total TV market: roughly 10% of the market in Europe, 0% in the US and less than 5% in the rest of the world. Only a few TV set makers therefore used these tuners, including the main high-end competitors of Philips BGTV: Sony Europe, Panasonic Europe and Bang & Olufsen. Philips at this time did not use stand-alone tuners in its high end sets but tuner-IF front ends. The first generation FQ900 used the UV916H as tuner, the FQ900-Mk2 the UV916M. However, combined volumes of the UV916H, M and their frontend versions never exceeded some 350k units per year.\n\nThe UV916M featured a number of design optimizations compared to the UV916H to meet all these requirements:\n\nIt was the first tuner to use DMA varicaps for better BPF symmetry and tracking, which both have a major impact on tilt. The BB132, BB133 and BB134 were used for the low, mid and high bands, respectively. The standard non-DMA BB131 was used in the pre-stages;\n\nFor better 2nd-order linearity it used in low and mid band the new concept of back-to-back varicap diodes, which meant that the two diodes were in series with their cathodes connected. This had the advantage of cancelling out 2nd order distortions and also the halving the matching error, but at the expense of only half the effective variable capacitor range. This required compensation by increasing the BPF inductors, either the main filter inductor or the common foot inductor (see Tuner theory 10);\n\nThe standard MOSFET was in principle the 5V 30mS BF904, but in low band the BF908R 8V 40mS version was used to compensate for the gain loss due to the pre-filter which was broadened for good low band input VSWR;\n\nThe UV916M used standard 0603 SMDs, providing much more lay-out flexibility. Compare with the UV916H using 0805 shown above;\n\nIt increased the input surge protection from 6 to 10kV.\n\nOne interesting complication worth noting is that the UV916M specification on tilt (<2dB) was so tight that the production test equipment tolerance of 1dB posed a real problem, leaving less than 1dB for product spread. It required a lot of production equipment calibration, adding to the manufacturing cost.\n\nSMD bottom side of the UV916S-Mk1. Note the pinning differences between the SSOP24 MO-IC and the Motorola SO14 PLL. [Internet]\n\nTop view of the UV916S-Mk2. Because of the single-sided PCB there are neither tracks nor soldering on this side of the board. [Jac Janssen collection]\n\nThe component side of the UV916S-Mk2, identical to the Mk1 but with an SO24 MO-IC instead of the SSOP24. [Jac Janssen collection]\n\nA last tuner in this family of high performance tuners within the UV900 family, and in fact the last 900-tuner to be designed, was the UV916S (with the S probably for Saving). It was intended as a cost-reduced successor of the UV916E, used so far in the Standard Dreux chassis GR2.2 and GR2.4, and intended to be introduced in the new Mid1 and Mid2 chassis. Compared to the UV916M, from which it was derived, there were a number of changes in the UV916S:\n\nit was a 5V tuner (apart from the 33V varicap voltage), so no longer requiring the 12V pin;\n\nto this end the 9V TDA5630 was replaced by the 5V TDA5736, by then the standard 5V MO also used in other families;\n\ninstead of the Philips TSA5512 it used the almost compatible Motorola MC48829, essentially because it was cheaper. One difference between the two PLLs was that the Motorola device did not feature the PLL Lock bit;\n\nfor further cost reduction the tuner technology changed from double-sided FR4 wave soldering to single-sided CEM3 PCB and re-flow soldering.\n\nThe original plan was to introduce the UV916S in the GR2.4 first, as running change, and then roll it out in volume in the Mid1 and Mid2 chassis. However, the Dreux TV organisation was dragging its feet and always finding excuses why it was difficult (the 5V supply could not handle the tuner current, the missing lock bit gave SW problems, etcetera), so first the GR2.4 design was skipped and then the Mid1.1. It was only in 1996 in the Mid1.2 and Mid2.1 that the UV916S was introduced, although it would from then on run in substantial numbers (around 2Mio per year). In parallel the UV916S was also selected for the iR3 Vienna and Grundig TV-VCR chassis Beta (in 1996) and Mono98 (1998), which added another 650.000 tuners. And finally the tuner was used for the TP900-Mk2 tuner-splitter-modulator for VCR. So overall the UV916S was produced in serious volumes, and as such the highest runner of the MO-IC UV900 tuners. Because the UV916S was designed to be produced on the oldest type of equipment within the BU, especially the SSOP24 package of the MO gave reliability issues due to soldering short circuits. In 1997 the UV916S-Mk2 was therefore introduced, being completely identical to the Mk1 apart from the MO-IC that was now in a larger SO24 package.\n\nPictures of the UV916S in sets are rare. Here the 28PW6302/02, a Mid1.2E chassis Black Line S TV. [Obsolete Telly]\n\nThe Mid1.2E chassis introduced 16:9 screen sizes in the mid end domain and used the new UV916S. This is the 24PW6322 from 1998. [Philips]\n\nThe second generation TV-VCR combi, the 1996-97 Beta chassis, was the first to use the UV916S. This is the 14PV162.\n\nThe third generation TV-VCR was the Mono98 chassis, again using the UV916S and UV1216D. [RadioMuseum.org]\n\nOverview of the Philips UV900 high performance tuners with MO-IC (except for the UV988).\n\nFS900 and FQ900 TV Front ends, 1991-1993\n\nTerrestrial front ends, that is a tuner plus IF, remained one of the most frustrating product segments for the BU Tuners in its relation with the big Business Group TV. The FQ800 family was being used for all Brugge high-end FL1 and FL2 chassis, but volumes were modest at 220k modules/year. Furthermore diversity was an issue, with one single type accounting for 70% of the volume, two types for another 20% and the next three for 10%. So when discussions about the next generation 900 front ends started the BU objective was to reduce diversity by focussing on a few multi-standard versions. Unfortunately the BGTV organization politics and structure decided differently.\n\nThe first to ask for new front ends was the Overseas organization for its 1993 G8 chassis. They required front ends, but less expensive than the FQ800, and three types were defined: the FS916 for B/G, the FS936 for M/N in the US and Latam, the FS986 for Japanese M. The concept of the FS900 was much more basic than the FQ800:\n\nUV916E and UV936E discrete MO standard tuners, in contrast to the high-end UV816;\n\nno multi-standard versions;\n\nno complex IF demodulation: only video and one sound channel. For stereo the sound 2nd IF was made available as output;\n\na shorter, 100mm folded metal housing instead of the 145mm Zamac housing of the FQ800.\n\nHowever, the FS900 introduced one major innovation: synchronous PLL based demodulation, using the Sanyo LA7570 and LA7571 IF ICs. So where the TDA4439 of the FQ816 still used a filtered VIF carrier for the quasi-synchronous video demodulator, the LA7570 contained a real PLL with a VCO that locked to the incoming IF picture carrier. A Nyquist Slope Circuit (NSC) provided an \"anti-filter\" for the vestigial sideband Nyquist slope, thus reducing VCO phase deviations due to asymmetrical video content around the picture carrier on the Nyquist slope. Identical quadrature demodulators were used for the tuner AFC (using the IF picture carrier) and FM demodulation (using the sound sub-carrier).\n\nBlock diagram of the FS900 IF section around the Sanyo LA7570 IC. The single PLL-controlled VCO is used for the synchronous detection of video (top flow) and sound (bottom flow).\n\nThe Sanyo IC had one drawback: it required a separate Sound IF SAW filter. However, this allowed the same VCO to be used for identical synchronous detection of both the video and quasi-synchronous sound, which minimized video-sound crosstalk. The dual SAW filters plus the price of the IF-IC made the FS900 relatively expensive for its functionality. As a consequence (probably) the Overseas organization decided to use standard UV900 tuners for all European models of the G8 chassis, using the FS936 only in Latin America, Taiwan and Korea, and a handful of FS986 in Japan in Marantz sets.\n\nMechanics of the short FS900 front end (top), with a 100mm long body, and the 125m long FQ900 front end (bottom).\n\nTop view of the FS936E.

[Hugo Duran collection]\n\nPublicity picture showing the IF sections or PCB of the FQ816 (upper left), FS936 (centre) and FI916 (front). [Johan Bos]\n\nThe Eindhoven High-End Lab, together with the Brugge TV development, however, had higher specifications for their targeted front ends, which were to be introduced in the already running Feature Line FL1 and FL2 chassis that were using the FQ800. The FQ900, as it was called, was expected to be a major cost reduction from the expensive FQ800, without any performance compromise but with the addition of some new features. Compared to the FS900 this meant:\n\nuse of the high performance UV916H tuner (which was in fact developed specifically for this application);\n\nmulti-standard solutions for the complex European border zones. The same Multi-Europe (ME; covering B/G as main and L and M as secondary standards) and Multi-France (MF; L/L' as main and I and B/G as secondary). In other words, the same multis as for the FQ800;\n\nmulti-standard video demodulation using the TDA9802;\n\nstereo FM sound demodulation to be included using the TDA9820 dual FM demodulator;\n\nmono AM sound demodulation using the TDA9830 for SECAM L/L';\n\nIF output optionally available for external D2MAC demodulation. For these cases a separate D2MAC IF-module was requested too;\n\nfor dual tuner Picture-in-Picture (PIP), a feature on which expectations of TV marketing were high, an active power splitter with good Noise Figure and VSWR was to be added in front of the tuner: the PS915;\n\nbecause the front end was supposed to be introduced in the FL1 and FL2 as replacement of the FQ800 without lay-out changes on the side of the TV, Long IEC connectors were needed to compensate for the smaller length of the FQ900.\n\nPictures of opened and closed FQ900 TV front ends.

The three DIL IF-ICs that are required for the full Multi-France functionality are clearly visible and take up most of the space. Compared to the FQ800 the brown-coloured SAW filter has considerable been reduced in size. [Hugo Duran collection]\n\nThe IF section of the FQ900 was designed around the new TDA9802, a PLL demodulator like the Sanyo IC used in the FS916, but at 5V supply voltage instead of 9V. Other than that the concepts of the two ICs were almost identical, although the 9802 was able to demodulate both negative modulation standards as well as positive modulation (L/L'). The single FM sound demodulator was not used, but instead the TDA9820 dual PLL demodulator, which could demodulate both the main and second audio signals. For the main input the IC contained a built-in selection switch. In case also L and/or L' reception was required the dedicated AM audio demodulator TDA9830 was added, which required the SAW-filtered IF signal as input, and performed quasi-synchronous (using the clipped IF carrier as input) AM demodulation. Although, compared to the FQ800, the number of IF ICs increased from two to three, the system partitioning was much more optimal and the application circuit much less complex with especially fewer tank circuits that needed alignment nor external switching transistors. The FQ900 family was introduced as a running change in the FL1.10 and following versions of the FL1, FL2 and FL4 TV chassis from 1993.\n\nStarting from the FL1.10, the high-end Feature Line chassis switched from the FQ800 to the FQ900L. The FL2 covered the 16:9 screen size. This is the 32PW962B from 1993, using the new using Black Line-S Crystal Clear screen. It featured 100Hz and PIP. [Philips catalogue via RadioMuseum.org]\n\nTop down interior view of a similar FL2.24 set, the 28PW908B. On the left the FQ900 front end. [Obsolete Telly]\n\nBy the time the FQ900 was being defined, around 1991, D2MAC was in crisis due to the emergence of Astra satellite TV, but definitely not dead. It was expected that especially Cable-D2MAC, so D2MAC-coded signal distribution in cable-TV networks, would still become a serious application. Ever since the FQ800, and still in the FQ900, provisions for D2MAC were important. In practice this meant that the tuner IF output was made available, symmetrically, for an external D2MAC IF demodulator, followed by the D2MAC decoder. All FQ800 and FQ900 models used internally by BGTV have the IF-suffix, indicating they were D2MAC ready.\n\nIt seems that the BU Tuners also designed and offered a D2MAC IF demodulator to the TV Labs, either on their request or on its own initiative. This model had the functionality as shown in the circuit diagram below, the only reference I've seen for this module.\n\nBlock diagram of the Philips D2MAC IF demodulator module, intended to accompany the FQ800 and FQ900 front ends. [BU Tuners 1990 product overview]\n\nThe module essentially was a second down-converter, with a PLL locking to the D2MAC carrier. AGC gating and a positive/negative switch made it flexible to all possible D2MAC modulation formats. As said, there are minimal traces of this module, and I strongly doubt it was ever taken into production. Knowing the BGTV, they probably claimed doing it themselves better and cheaper. Despite all that, D2MAC was persistent, and when the next generation front end was defined it was called the FM900, the M explicitly referring to MAC.\n\nThe main challenge of the FQ900 family was the type diversity. There were the FQ916 basic version (B/G), ME Multi Europe (B/G/L/M), MF Multi France (L/L'/I/B/G) plus the FQ944 (I), as well as splitter versions of the multi-versions and IF-versions for D2MAC out. In all some 8 types for a modest 350k modules per year.\n\nThe PS915 click-on PIP-splitter, 1993\n\nAs listed earlier, one of the requirements for the FQ900 family was to support dual tuner Picture-in-Picture (PIP). In that case a splitter module could be clicked in front of the FQ900 tuner section, reducing the normal IEC-long connector to a normal IEC. Broadband splitters are always a challenge, as we've already seen in the VCR module section in chapter 4, compromising between broadband gain, NF degradation and good IP2 and IP3 overload performance.\n\nThree pictures of the PS915: with closed cover, SMD-side and bottom side. [Johan Bos and Martin Barnasconi collection]\n\nThe PS915 was essentially based on a single transistor amplifier directly behind the input, using a high power BFG97 amplifier. Normally the outputs were then connected through a balancing transformer. However, this did not provide sufficient isolation between the different outputs, and additional common base amplifiers were added in each of the output branches. Because this type of amplifiers does not add gain but only noise, overall performance of the PS915 was marginal.\n\nFQ900 types using the PS915 splitter were marked D. So the FQ916DME was the Multi Europe type with splitter.\n\nApproximate circuit diagram of the PS915 RF PIP-splitter. Rb1 and Rb2 set the base voltage of the BFG97; Rf/RE set the amplifier gain; Ra and Rb set the base voltage of the common base transistors; Rt sets the output impedance to roughly 75 Ohm.\n\nOverview of the Philips FS900 and FQ900 TV Frontends. The FQ900D types used the click-on PS915 splitter module.\n\nFQ900-Mk2, the last TV front end, 1995\n\nThe FM900, as the next generation was called with the M referring to D2MAC, was defined for the next generation high-end chassis, the Global Feature Line (GFL), targeted for launch in 1994 in Europe, Asia in 1995 and Latam in 1996, and intended to cover 24-32\" 16:9 and 25-33\" 4:3 screen sizes. Given the experience with the FQ900 the BU Tuners desperately tried to keep diversity limited, but the front end was clearly used to solve the BGTV regional diversity problems. The original request was 19 types: eight new FQ900-Mk2, one video-only FV900, the three existing FS900 and seven FM900. The BU Tuners, in contrast, pushed hard to have all multi-types covered by a single Multi-Global: main standards B/G/D/K/L on the main PCB, secondary standards M/L' on an add-on PCB. The type that in practise came closest to this ambition was the FV916MG, a version with no internal sound demodulation, so only video, for the typical Overseas countries. However, BGTV insisted on the by now standard ME and MF versions. The updates of the FM900 versus the FQ900 were:\n\nreplacement of the UV916H tuner by the lower tilt UV916M, required for the D2MAC performance;\n\na new multi version was introduced covering the D/K standard for Russia and Eastern Europe (remember that in 1989 the Wall fell) and China: Multi-Russia (B/G/D/K/I/M);\n\nuse of the fully integrated Philips Semiconductors multi-standard QSS IF-IC TDA9815. This IC had dual VIF inputs, a PLL video demodulator with gated phase detector for L/L' and gated AGC for positive modulation, a QSS SIF demodulator which also acted as detector for AM sound, two FM demodulators for the main and sub-carrier and D2MAC mode (by-passing all audio circuitry);\n\nthe D2MAC demodulator as optional sub-printed circuit board, where it is not clear on which IC this function was based;\n\nfor the multi versions the IF required switching between four VIF SAWs, while on the sound sub-carrier level there were also multiple sound filters to be selected. For all this switching multiple transistors were required. So although the TDA9815 provided a much higher level of integration compared to the three ICs in the FQ900, the application became more complex;\n\nbecause there were now so many standard options and combinations, and especially so many different switches to control, the three control lines coming from the tuner I2C in the PLL were no longer capable of driving it all, and a digital decoder HEF40538 was required to manage the standards selection;\n\nthe PS915 was still required for PIP versions, but the front end input was no longer the TV set antenna connector, so all connectors became phono. Although there were some investigations into an improved Mk2, due to low volumes it was decided to stay with the PS915-Mk1.\n\nThen in September 1993 the decision came to drop all D2MAC versions; D2MAC was finally declared dead within BGTV. This substantially reduced type diversity, which, under pressure of the low volumes of the more exotic types, was reduced to just 6: ME and DME, MF and DMF, DMR and the FV916MG. Because the FM900 name was no longer useful, the family finally became the FQ900-Mk2. It ramped according plan during the first half of 1994 in the GFL chassis.\n\nA-side picture of the Philips FQ916DMR-Mk2 multi-standard TV front end with PS915 splitter on the left.

[Philips Semiconductors TDA9815 Data Sheet]\n\nThe only chassis using the FQ900-Mk2 frontends was the Global Feature Line. Here a 4:3 screen version of the GFL2.20, the 33\" 33PT9121.\n\nA widescreen 16:9 version of the GFL chassis, the GFL2.30 32PW9761.\n\nThe history of analogue TV front ends between the BU Tuners and BGTV was not a happy one. One reason was technical: front ends were originally defined to match the tightening Cenelec norms on radiation, where it was expected that both functions in a single metal can would improve especially radiation ingress performance. Which was true, but unfortunately not necessarily the only possible solution, so in the end there was no urgent need for TV to use front ends. Also there was no functional integration or design advantage of having both in the same box, they were literally two separate PCBs put into one frame. But the main reasons were political!\n\nThe first generation FS600 suffered from cover contact fretting corrosion, which gave the BU-T quality reputation a serious dent. When this problem was structurally solved - by soldering the cover contacts - the High End Lab and Brugge TV Development returned to the FQ800 family, which was high performance but also high price. An FQ800-multi price at the time was around 55Hfl, a considerable part of the total TV Bill-of-Material (BoM), and this was one of the main reasons these front ends never came into the standard segment (the Dreux Anubis chassis). The main problem with BGTV was that they didn't provide a stable application, allowing the families to run for a number of years to recover the fairly high development costs. The FQ800 was introduced in the FL1 and FL2 chassis in 1991, to be replaced a so-called \"running change\" in 1993 on the same chassis with the FQ900-Mk1, which in turn was replaced by the FQ900-Mk2 (after a lot of wasted D2MAC development costs) in the GFL in 1995. So the volume life time of each generation was only two years, with increasing complexity and performance requirements, and all that for a total volume of, at the peak in the GFL chassis, 450.000 units per year. Where the combined volume of the ME and MF main runners was already 370k, and in contrast that of the combined PIP D-versions less than 13k pieces. At the same time every sub-type had to go through the same full release procedure. To add insult to injury the splitter versions were even completely dropped in 1994, the splitter moving to the UV1216D which will be discussed further down. It is obvious that under these conditions the front ends were a seriously loss making business for the BU Tuners, and a strain on the internal BGTV-BUT relation. It was therefore a relieve to both parties when BGTV decided end of 1993 that they didn't require any new front ends after the FQ900-Mk2 family. There was a short discussion on the request to build IF modules for material plus 0,50Hfl, but this obviously didn't lead to any agreement. This ended the 10-year story of front ends in Philips TVs.\n\nA last, and probably very low volume, application of the FQ900-Mk2 frontends were the FTV1.5 and FTV1.9, the very first plasma TVs of Philips from 1997-1998. Here the FTV1.5 42PW9962.

The trend towards increasingly multi-standard solutions is obvious.\n\nTP900, VCR tuner-modulator, 1996\n\nIn the VCR domain the Wien factory in Austria tried to stay competitive against the Asian competition by using high levels of automation, whereas Grundig continued production in its renewed factory Werk21 in Nürnberg. In 1992 the two companies, although now both owned by Philips, create the the separate joint venture (60% Philips) \"Image Reception, Recording, Replay\"or in short iR3, which from then on contains all VCR activities. The iR3 construction allows a further strengthening of the co-operation with Panasonic/JVC and its Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia factory. In the Philips model range we thus see the occasional Panasonic set (re-branded as Philips) and an increased use of Matsushita key components like modulator modules.\n\nAs explained in the previous chapter, the relation between the BU Tuners and the VCR business in Wien (Vienna, Austria) remained difficult. The VCR business was the first to drop the notion of vertical Philips purchasing, instead buying many components, modules, complete decks and sometimes even complete sets in Asia. One of the worrying elements was that this was now hailed by the Consumer Electronics management, and around 1995 iR3 - after many years being left alone and ignored following the V2000 debacle - was now all of a sudden hailed as a shining example for the other CE groups (TV and Audio). The desastrous effects of this we will see in the years to come! With the 1990 Jasmin chassis a Philips tuner (the UV916E) had been re-introduced, but the splitter-modulator module remained Asian (Alps, Mitsumi, Samsung). The BU Tuners thus had to do a lot of talking to convince Wien to use Philips tuners. The difficulty in the discussions was the big cost pressure in VCR, Philips/iR3 only being a small player, with price references set by the big and homogeneous US VCR market (20Mio of the global 48Mio sets VCR market). In this segment Alps had a major position, producing so-called NTSC 3-in-1's, that is a single module containing splitter/modulator, tuner and single-standard IF. It was obvious that given the European and Asian IF diversity (B/G, D/K, I/I', L/L') it was not economical to make non-NTSC 3-in-1's, so the target became the 2-in-1: splitter/modulator plus tuner. But with aggressive price targets based on 3-in-1 single-standard references. This became the TP900.\n\nThe 900-family frame design was flexible, and could be extended backwards (behind the tuner, top) or forwards (in front of the tuner, below). In the picture from top to bottom the FS900, UV900 and TP900 frames. RF input always on the right side. [Hugo Duran collection]\n\nBlock diagram of the Philips TDA8722 PLL-controlled UHF video modulator. [Philips Semiconductors TDA8722 Data Sheet]\n\nTo make the TP900 as cheap as possible it was based on the lowest cost European tuner available, the UV916E, the product already in use by iR3. So where all other tuner generations in development at this time used an MO-IC, the TP916 was the last product still based on a discrete mixer-oscillator. The functionality and characteristics were as follows:\n\nUV916E discrete MO tuner with TSA5512 PLL;\n\nit used an extended single-piece UV900 frame, although a separate screen insert was required. The total length became 100mm (versus 66mm of the UV900). When the project started in 1993 Vienna asked for a frame with the two connectors under 90 degrees on the top side of the frame, for backward compatibility with the then used modulator modules. Luckily this request was dropped at a later stage and the connectors were then back at their normal position;\n\na UHF modulator based on the Philips TDA8722 in an SSOP20 package. This was essentially a mixer-oscillator PLL (MOPLL) but with the mixing in the \"opposite direction\": from base band directly to UHF. The UHF-only PLL was essentially identical to the stand-alone TSA5512-type PLLs. The modulator could handle all negative video modulation plus FM sound standards, so G (Western Europe), K (Eastern Europe) and I (UK, Ireland). The intention was to use the Plessey SP5067 as SECAM UHF modulator, but since the IC didn't meet specifications it was dropped and it was agreed with Vienna to have no modulator for French sets, given that in France SCART was mandatory and no modulators were required. The TDA8722 contained an internal Test Pattern Signal Generator (TPSG). To reduce cost the two PLLs shared the tuner 4MHz crystal;\n\nthe loop-through amplifier was based on two BFQ540 power transistors, one as first common amplifier, a second one in the tuner branch. This was always a difficult trade-off: a single transistor providing all gain but then requiring high current to guarantee the required linearity, versus two or three-stage amplification with more trade-off of power vs. linearity per stage. Around the loop-through were two more complications. In US NTSC VCRs with VHF channel 3-4 modulators, the loop-through was switched-off in case of modulator play-back, making especially impedance matching easy. In the European splitter-modulator the loop-through remained active, even when the modulator was active. This required a more complex signal addition, even more so at the roughly 600MHz of the modulator output. Secondly, in all European VCR splitter-modulator modules, often with mediocre performance, an emergency 10dB attenuator switch was available, accessible at the back of the VCR set. The VCR organization was very scared of deleting this switch, where Tuners didn't want it for design reasons and cost. In the end it was deleted, although the space was reserved to add it back in case of need (which fortunately never happened);\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of any VCR up to now was that the loop-through splitter always needed be active, even if the VCR was not used, to guarantee signals were passed to the television RF input. Due to their high linearity requirements, loop-through splitters consume quite some power, and therefore the stand-by power of VCRs was always high. Furthermore, at least according the internal Philips rules for component guaranteed lifetime performance, junction temperatures of permanently-on devices needed be lower than 100degrC, which meant large devices or a lot of heat sinking. The perfect solution to all this was the Passive Loop-Through (PLT) function, which was proposed as new feature for the TP900. Although the reception by Vienna was lukewarm (it was of course not for free) it was nevertheless made a main element of the product and available as option (TP900L).\n\nBlock diagram of the TP900L with passive loop-through (block 14 with its control terminal 15). [Philips US patent 5,706,060 by Leo Ruitenburg, filed April 1995]\n\nThe basic circuit of the Passive Loop-Through, using multiple series-connected varicaps. [Philips US patent 5,706,060]\n\nThe PLT was based on a patented solution using the latest high-ratio varicaps. The basic concept uses the fact that at zero Volt the capacitance of a varicap is high, while it becomes low at 28V. The BB1147 capacitance, for example, varied between some 100pF at 1V and 2,5pF at 28V, a ratio of 40. During normal operation of the splitter-modulator, the voltages on the PLT control terminals are high: 33V at terminal 151, 5V at terminal 152 and thus 0V at the varicap anodes. The capacitance of the varicaps is consequently low and the equivalent impedance parallel to the active loop-through high. If the impedance of a single varicap is too low in the on-state, multiple diodes can be connected in series; the Philips patent goes as high as four. For example, at 1GHz, C28 of 2pF per diode and three diodes in series gives a total impedance of 240 Ohm. When both control voltages 151 and 152 are switched off at 0V, the diode voltages become 0V too and the capacitances high, providing a low-Ohmic path between in- and output. The design of the TP900L PLT is based on the three-diode circuit shown left, although in practice the 2nd diode 17 was replaced by a capacitor for saving cost. The typical insertion loss of the PLT when in use was 3dB.\n\nTop view of the Philips TP916 Tumod, with on the right the splitter-modulator section.

[Philips RF Manual, 4th edition, 2003]\n\nThe TP900 was released early 1996, and although developed in Krefeld was volume produced in Singapore and Batam, in view of the required volumes and the cost. The total VCR volumes of Philips at this time were 4,5Mio sets per year: 2,25Mio standard Europe (TP916 system G), 50k Eastern Europe (TP956 system K), 500k France (TP926 no modulator), 300k UK (TP944 system I UHF only) and 20k Ireland (TP946 system I). After much discussion it was decided that all Grundig Neurnberg sets would use the PLT while all small volume types (944, 946 and 956) would only be produced with PLT. However, now the iR3 politics (or was it the Consumer Electronics or even Philips politics?) kicked in again, because the Vienna organisation had forced Alps to develop pin compatible copies of the TP900 family, including a PLT. In contrast to the BU Tuners, who never made any Japanese pinning products, Alps did develop a Philips-pinning TP900 family (called TMRG1), probably the only time they ever did this. Vienna decided that 15% of the volume including the small volume versions went to Alps, leaving the TP916 and TP926 main runners to Philips. From a production and diversity perspective this was not bad, although it didn't reduce the development effort, since all versions needed release anyway. Later the Alps percentage increased to 40%.\n\nThe TP900 family didn't live long, because it was quickly succeeded by the TP900-Mk2, based on the UV916S tuner discussed in the previous section, including its single-sided re-flow technology. The modulator remained unchanged, but the passive loop-through was improved by switching to a dedicated single-gate MOSFET, based on the same 0,5u technology as used for the latest generation dual gate MOSFETs. The BF1107 was a depletion-mode type, which was operated in a grounded-grid configuration. The Drain-Source voltage was always kept equal to zero by the series capacitance in the Source. In normal VCR operation the Drain is connected to 5V, and with Vds=0 the Source too. The Gate-Source voltage Vgs is thus -5V, far beyond the -3V pinch-off voltage, and the MOSFET doesn't conduct, leaving the loop-through function to the normal active splitter. However, in stand-by, with Vd=0V too, both Drain, Source and Gate are all at 0V, the MOSFET conducts and thus provides a (12Ohm resistive) RF path to the output. To avoid capacitive load of the inoperative active splitter, two additional switching diodes are added.\n\nThe TP900-Mk2 was introduced in the new Apollo Turbo-VHS platforms in 1998 to 2000 (Apollo10, 11, 12 and 20), again alongside some 40% Alps copy models. In the end the TP900 families lived for only 5-6 years, amounting to some 15Mio products and 300MHfl sales.\n\nBy this time the VCR was rapidly loosing its position as carrier of video content to the (recordable) DVD, and became a very low cost commodity product. As part of the required cost cutting production in the Wien factory was stopped, and transferred to Shékesfehérvár, Hungary in 1997. But did not stop the trend. In the US Philips/iR3 stopped manufacturing its own VHS recorders per the same year, the Japanese company Funai taking over production of all Magnavox-branded VCR decks. Ironically they were very successful, being the first to introduce below 100$ VHS recorders. In 2001 Philips, the majority shareholder in iR3, threw in the towel and sold all remaining VCR business to Funai. Although they continued to sell Philips-branded products (Philips in Europe, Magnavox in the US) the chassis quickly became Funai-designed using Japanese components, and all prospects for Philips tuner-modulators were gone. Funai stopped production in Hungary end of 2009.\n\nThe TP900(L)-Mk2 externally looked identical to the Mk1. Here the TP916L-Mk2.

[van Eck Video Services]\n\nOverview of the two generations Philips TP900 Tuner-Modulators (Tumods) for the VCR market.\n\nAlmost in parallel to the TP900 Tuner-Modulator, a second segment was addressed between iR3 and the BU Tuners: TV-VCR combis. The VCR drive was becoming so cheap - the main problem of iR3 - that it became econiomically feasible to put a VCR drive into a standard TV set. The first platform called Alpha (but more commonly TV-VCR1) was launched in 1995. It used the Anubis-A low-end TV chassis from Monza as a starting point, which used the UV917 VST tuner. It was plobably only a trial, with very few actual models. It was the only TV-VCR to have the VCR unit above the TV, all next generations would have it below. The TV-VCR1 also seems to have been the only produced in Monza, the mother fab of the Anubis chassis. (In parallel all US TV-VCRs were also developed by Funai, coded CCA or CCB, and produced in Malaysia).\n\nNow, for TV-VCR there were two options:\n\ncheap sets used the single tuner of the television chassis, which meant that only the TV channel being watched could be recorded.\n\nmore expensive sets had a second tuner on the VCR board, allowing the recording of a different channel than the one being watched. These second tuners were the uV1216D with splitter, the output of the splitter looped-through to the TV tuner.\n\nThe next TV-VCR platform was the Beta, which was the first real volume family with many different 14 and 20\" models. It was the first chassis to use the UV916S, the Paolina VCR that was developed in parallel still used the UV916E-based TP900-Mk1. The Gamma chassis (also known as Mono98) still used the same UV916S and UV1216D tuners. The Delta chassis, launched in 1999, was the last iR3-developed TV-VCR, using the latest UV1316-Mk2 and UV1316T splitter-tuner. The Epsilon, from 2002, was already a Funai chassis, and just like the Funai VCRs no longer contained Philips modules. Another Philips product that no longer was.\n\nOverview of the Philips VCR and TV-VCR generations and their RF module sources from 1990 till the take-over by Funai in 2002.\n\nThe end of the VCR era.

Although Philips was perfectly competitive on performance (and often still the benchmark) and price, the smaller size always gave discussions. Perception was that bigger was less advanced. So once the UV900 family reached production in 1990 development started of a substantially smaller tuner family: the UV1200. The challenge with miniaturization in the meantime remained as it will always be: in general smaller size means less material and thus lower cost, but beyond a certain point the technology to make a product smaller also makes it more expensive, often due to the need for new components. Because volumes are still low, prices are higher. For Philips Tuners an additional cost adder were investments, since completely new manufacturing processes were required.\n\nMechanics of the UV1200, the smallest Philips tuner to date.\n\nUV1216E top view (B-side) and bottom view (A-side). This was the first generation UV1200 tuner, still based on the UV916E discrete concept. [Hugo Duran collection]\n\nNote on the above two pictures: since this was a manufacturing prototype the IC and 4MHz crystal were not mounted. To give the impression of the complete product I've copy-pasted them into the pictures.\n\nThe main challenge for miniaturization was the need to move to a more advanced soldering process. Wave soldering used up to now was reaching its limitations: smaller components (0603 or SSOP ICs) could no longer reliably be wave soldered without the risk of short circuits. The solution for this was well known: re-flow soldering, where a solder paste is printed on the PCB before the components are placed, and the solder joint is made during a pass through the re-flow oven. The first exercise was the UV1216E, essentially a copy of the UV916E scaled to the much smaller 1200 size. The innovations were thus in the mechanical and process domains:\n\nsmaller 50x36x13mm single-piece folded frame, only 38% of the UV900 volume;\n\nplastic pin block instead of wire pins;\n\noption for horizontal mounting, with bended pins and four mounting tags at the corners of the A-side cover;\n\nre-flow soldering on A-side, 0603 components and SO20 PLL IC.\n\nThe UV1216E was only produced in very small numbers, as far as I know only for some exclusive applications like a small 6\" LCD TV made by the Marantz Philips sub-brand. I think it was quite obvious that a discrete MO tuner in such a small housing was a real challenge, and the new UV1200 family from now on consistently used an MO-IC.\n\nThe UV1216 now made a split into two different directions, not dissimilar from the UV800 earlier: the main application became the tuner being the tuner section of the new FI1200 multi-media front end family. This would become the by far biggest application, for many years. The second track was the UV1216 as second tuner in TV-VCR or Picture-in-Picture TV applications, in these cases often as splitter-tuner. the original intention to make the UV1200 the new main tuner family as successor of the UV900 were quickly dropped, also because the intended leading TV chassis Horus, the Steco successor of the Anubis chassis, was cancelled. The Anubis saw multiple upgrades, stretching its life till 1997 when it was succeeded by the L7 chassis.\n\nSince the UV1200 was not cheaper than a standard UV900, it only found application where it was worth paying for a small tuner. The first one was the TV-VCR (or TVCR) combo, a secondary product line of the iR3 organization in Wien and Neurnberg (Grundig). These TV-VCRs were positioned as cheap small size alternatives to separate TV and VCR, and were mainly using small 14\" to 20\" screens. In cabinets barely larger than a standard 14\" TV but now also including a VCR deck there was obviously not much room for large modules. The first generations TVCR were based on an Anubis-A CTV chassis in combination with standard VCR drive. In case of single tuner sets the standard UV917 tuner was used on the Anubis chassis, but for a dual-tuner that was replaced by the UV1216D (with the same length) from which a small coax cable then ran to a second UV900 tuner on the VCR board. All tuners were standard vertical mounting. The TV-VCR Gen1 was introduced in 1994, the Beta chassis in 1996 and the Mono98 in 1998, all using the UV1216D/P.\n\nThe second application was Picture-in-Picture, which at the time was seen as a major TV innovation, after the death of D2MAC and with the upcoming 16:9 widescreen television. PIP was initially only implemented in the high-end Brugge chassis, where an add-on module with a complete video processing chain was added to the basic chassis. The very first PIP set was the FL1.14 Feature Line, but still using a vertically mounted UV916E. The GFL2.20 in 1995 introduced the horizontally mounted UV1216 on a PIP plug-in panel. In these chassis the splitter was part of the FQ900 front end as has been discussed. The life of the UV1216 in high end sets was as limited as that of the FQ900, so just one chassis.\n\nA typical medium sized screen Philips TV-VCR, the 20\" 20PV184, with the VCR deck below the TV screen.

[Johan Bos collection]\n\nAlthough the UV1200(D) was not a major business success (volumes remained quite low), it was an important technology innovation step, introducing a few new features:\n\nthe UV1216 had its two SSOP ICs on the A-side, with all other SMDs on the B-side. It thus required two steps of re-flow soldering, one for each side of the PCB;\n\nit introduced fine pitch SSOP ICs, with a pin-to-pin distance of 0,65mm (0,025\"), half the value of the SO packages used so far. SSOP ICs required dedicated vision-controlled component placement machines;\n\nit introduced the 5V tuner, using the TDA5730 5V family of MO-ICs, succeeding the 9V TDA5630 family;\n\nthe UV1216D continued the standard Philips backward compatibility approach, being 65mm long like the UV900, allowing a lay out that could accommodate both UV900 and UV1200D.\n\nThe major contribution of the UV1200 tuner and technology would be the front end family derived from it, the FI1200, that used the UV1200 as tuner section. To this end a full range of tuners was developed as tuner IP block - not as stand alone tuner! - with 1216 (PAL-B/G), 1236 (NTSC), 1244 (UK), 1246 (Ireland), 1256 (PAL-D/K) and even a 1288 (Japan) tuners for the different standards.

[Philips Semiconductors TDA8012 Data Sheet]\n\nThe previous Philips satellite front end had been the SF916, launched in 1991 and using a modified UV900 housing. However, by that time it was already outdated with respect to size. Competition was offering much smaller satellite modules for the Set Top Boxes (STB) that quickly became thinner. The satellite front end was thus one of the most urgent application areas for the introduction of smaller modules, and consequently the first to adopt the 1200 family mechanics. Also because this was the only option for offering horizontal mounting. In contrast to the UV1200, which used reflow soldering, the SF1200 continued to use the cheaper wave soldering, with the exception of the SSOP IC on the B-side. Compared to the SF916 it introduced the following new features and components:\n\nthe 1200 frame (65x38,5x12,5mm), allowing dual input connectors and the choice of horizontal mounting;\n\nwhere the SF900 still used default IEC connectors with F-connectors as an option, the SF1200 reversed this, introducing the F-connector as the standard solution for satellite;\n\nthe Plessey SP5055 PLL was replaced by the Semiconductors TSA5055. This was essentially the standard tuner TSA5012 with an additional divide-by-2 pre-scaler to cover LO frequencies up to 2,6GHz;\n\nthe SF1200 targeted a substantial step in integration. Semiconductors designed three ICs specifically for satellite front ends: the TDA8010 MO, TDA8011 IF amplifier and TDA8012 FM demodulator. However, getting all ICs within specification was a bigger challenge than originally envisaged: the TDA8010 did not meet phase noise requirements, the TDA8011 was unstable and oscillated and the TDA8012 showed frequency drift. In the end the TDA8012 was the only one of the three that was ready in time. It featured two new functions: internal AFC including D2MAC or MUSE keying as well as carrier detect in channel search mode. The combined AFC-carrier detect output is zero in case of no signal, becomes high when the PLL captures a carrier (typically +/-17MHz) and becomes the linear AFC voltage when in lock (+/-500kHz);\n\nthe AFC voltage is connected to the TSA5055 PLL ADC input (P6) and can be read through the I2C bus;\n\nthe receiver has a two-step AGC: first the IF is controlled using the BF904 dual-gate MOSFET, when more gain reduction is needed the RF PIN-attenuators kick in;\n\nthe SF1200 offered the switchable IF bandwidth option, where there were essentially two configurations compared to the standard 27MHz IF bandwidth as used by Astra: switching to 32 or 36MHz as used by higher bandwidth modulation formats. Or switching to the lower 18MHz bandwidth to provide threshold extension for Astra signals. In the latter case, with high noise due to a weak received signal, the SNR can be improved by reducing the noise bandwidth from 27 to 18MHz. Switching is controlled through port P0 of the PLL.\n\nSMD (A-) side of the Philips SF1216/FW2732 satellite front end. This side is still wave soldered.

On this side only the two ICs are reflow soldered: the TSA5055 on the right, left the TDA8012 IF demodulator. [Johan Bos collection]\n\nThe SF1200 was quite successful on the satellite market in terms of speed of design-in and the ramp of volumes. The modules were used by the Philips Suresnes STB, as well as the CTV satellite add-on modules. The latter were a last desperate attempt by the CTV organisation to keep satellite within the TV domain. However, these TV satellite cards were only fit for so-called \"free-to-air\" uncoded channels, whereas the majority of the most popular channels broadcast by Astra and the likes disappeared \"behind the decoder\", only visible with a subscription and card. (This ignores the massive hacking of the early analogue conditional access systems, but that didn't change the problem for the TV makers). A single plug-in satellite module was developed for the GR2.2 and GFL chassis based on the SF1216, but sales were minimal. After a last try with the Mid1 chassis satellite was dead within the Philips TV chassis, from now on satellite reception was exclusively the STB domain.\n\nThe next development in the satellite domain was the band extension of the Astra satellites, where next to the Enhanced Astra band from 10,7-11,8GHz now also the so-called Universal Astra band was added, from 11,7 to 12.75MHz. The challenge with this new band has already been introduced in the previous chapter, and is illustrated in the figure on the right. With the \"default\" LNB LO-frequency of 10,75GHz the first IF (and thus the input frequency range for the satellite front end) would be 950-2000GHz, within the normal SF1200 range. However, in this case the beat frequency of the two LOs (10,75-9,75=2,0GHz) would fall within the satellite IF band, see the top part of the figure. The upper LO was therefore shifted down to 10,6GHz, shifting the beat to 850MHz outside the 1st IF band, but now the 1st IF range became 1100-2150MHz. (The 2nd order beat 2xLO2 - 2xLO1 now appeared at 1700MHz, so within the band, but because of the 2nd order the power level of this interferer was acceptably low).\n\nIllustration of the need for 1st IF band extension to 2150MHz with the introduction of Universal Astra reception.

Note the change of coding convention with the introduction of the 2150MHz.\n\nTelephone modules, 1991-1995\n\nAnother new application, not covered so far, is wireless communication. These standards use by definition radios for transmission and reception, always bi-directional, and these radio modules obviously fell within the scope of potential new business for the BU-T. At the same time we should not forget that by the end of the 1980s this was really new for consumer applications, and initially the number of use cases was limited. The first application was the in-house analogue FM cordless phone of the CT0 standard, which had the advantage that only a limited range of some 10-20m was required. The problem was that many countries had their local CT0 standards with respect to downstream and upstream frequencies, so the BU developed only a few versions: CT012 for Spain and The Netherlands (31MHz base-to-handset, 40MHz return), CT024 for France (26 and 41MHz) and the CT034/54 for the US and China. The modules were based on a Semiconductors chip set and, given the low frequencies, didn't require a metal housing, so they were essentially stuffed PCBs. Which immediately highlighted the issue with these type of modules: there was not much RF competency required, neither for design nor for production (e.g. coil alignment). The CT0 modules were produced for the Philips Communications organization in Le Mans, France, and between 1991 and 1995 the volume steadily grew to 1,2Mio units/year.\n\nThen in 1995 CT0 volumes completely evaporated because it was replaced almost overnight by CT1 and CT1+, still analogue FM but operating at considerably higher frequencies in the UHF band: CT1 at 914 and 960MHz, CT1+ at 885 and 932MHz, which were used in most of Europe and Germany, respectively. CT1 provided 40 channels spaced 25kHz apart, CT+ 80 channels. The BU developed modules for both CT1 and CT1+, the CT912/914 and CT916/918, based on a Philips chipset consisting of the SA601 RF LNA, SA626 FM demodulator and UMA1015 PLL. It still used a discrete LO and filtering, so here the RF design content was much higher. CT1 quantities ramped to 240.000 units in 1995, but then collapsed like CT0, to be replaced by the \"ultimate\" Digital European Cordless Telephone standard (DECT). However, DECT was from the beginning highly integrated and for cost reasons designed directly on the cordless phone main PCB, without an RF module. This thus was the end of cordless phone modules by the BU.\n\nThe Philips CT918B RF module for CT1+ analogue cordless phones. Production date was August 1994.

[ibid]\n\nThe next application to emerge was the analogue mobile phone. While Europe quickly converged on the digital GSM standard, other areas started with (very big, shoe box size!) analogue mobile phones. The UK, Ireland, Italy, Singapore and Hong-Kong used ETACS (Extended Total Access Communication System), while the US used the very similar AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System). Like CT1 they operated in the UHF band just above the highest TV channel 69, although at substantially higher transmit powers to bridge the much larger distance. Philips developed a module for each of the two standards: the CA934 for AMPS and the CA944 for ETACS. But by the time these were launched (1995) the standards were already 10 years old and on the decline, given the emergence of digital standards. Furthermore, and in contrast to CT1 although at roughly similar frequencies, the AMPS and ETACS radios contained much more complex sub-functions, which were in-sourced as complete modules inside the CA934/944: a big antenna diplexer filter, an oscillator module, a PA module and a very narrow SAW filter. This made the purchased bill of material very high, and the margin for BU Tuners extremely small. When Le Mans switched to GSM completely also AMPS and ETACS were quickly discontinued. By 1997 it was all over for the telephone modules, when the last 100k were produced.\n\nThe Philips CA944 ETACS module. At the bottom left to right the oscillator, PA and diplexer modules.

[ibid]\n\nFI900 and FI1200 Multimedia frontends, 1992-1995\n\nWhile the \"big\" TV front ends, i.e. tuner plus IF demodulator in one box, remained a difficult and loss-making struggle, another front end application emerged with much better prospects. By the early 1990-ies the Personal Computer (PC) from IBM and its many clones, then based on the Intel 80486 processor families (with around 100MHz clock speed) and the Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 plus Windows 3.1 operating system, was rapidly becoming a standard device in the office and at home. Although the Internet already existed, it didn't have today's scale yet, and many PCs were operated in a quasi stand-alone mode. One of the big questions hanging over the consumer electronics market at the time was which of the two main functions would become leading in the home, the TV or the PC. (After 20 years we now know they both survived, in the form of the smart-TV and the highly networked PC as main access to the cloud-based Internet. In 1990 we couldn't have imagined either of the two). Because at the time TV was still the by far biggest content provider, as a first step in the merge of TV-centric entertainment and PC-based networking and computing, the desire emerged to be able to watch TV on a PC. On this application Philips emerged as one of the leading component suppliers, for the semiconductors but especially the tuner.\n\nIn the early days of home computing, we talk about the 1980s, the time of the Commodore 64 and the MSX computers of Philips and the Japanese companies, the computer was only a processing unit, connected through CVBS cable or SCART to a monitor. For these type of systems, and of course primarily its own fairly successful MSX2 computer, Philips brought out the AV7300, which can be considered as the first multimedia tuner module. It was launched in 1987 and used the then highly mature UV417-Mk2 all-band VST tuner (for the UK the U411 UHF-only version). The ICs were based on the System4 TV chip set: the TDA2541 PAL synchronous demodulator IF-IC that re-generated the CVBS, followed by the TBA120SQ FM audio demodulator. The Video and Sound baseband signals were available on tulip output connectors. Twelve band selectors and tuning potmeters allowed the pre-setting of twelve VHF or UHF channels. It supported both cable (full hyper band) and offair reception, for the latter it had its proper dual extendable V antenna that could be mounted on the rear of the box. The AV7300 was very successful, the benchmark for PC tuners, and ran for many years in substantial volumes.\n\nInterior view of the Philips AV7300, with upper right the UV417-Mk2 tuner and at the bottom the 12 channel pre-set potmeters (the black block), LEDs and channel selection buttons.

As the name says, around this time multimedia functions started to be added to the basic PC.

A PC-TV card would be used in the same way.\n\nThe main functions for the video processing on a PC-TV card using the SAA7110. One of the six inputs would be connected to front end module, the others could be regular video inputs from e.g. a VCR. [Philips Semiconductors SAA7110 Data Sheet]\n\nDisplaying TV broadcast content on a PC is technically quite different from watching it on a classical TV or, like in the case of the AV7300, on a standard analogue input monitor. To start, PCs are essentially operating in the digital domain, and any external analogue source requires digitization and formatting to make it compatible with the internal PC data structure. (Around the early 1990s most PCs were still 16-bit based, with the 486 cores being able to handle 32 bits too). For this interfacing IBM, when inventing the PC, had made the brilliant decision to accommodate every PC with a number of standardized ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) 8 or 16-bit interface slots. These slots were used for all external interfacing functions: video capture and accelerators, sound capture and play back (the famous Sound Blaster cards), networking interfaces and then also the TV reception card. By the mid 1990s the ISA slots were increasingly replaced by the Peripheral Component Interface (PCI), which was of the same concept but for 32 and later 64-bit inter-connections. In order to make the RF TV channel picture displayable on the PC monitor, multiple steps were required: RF-to-IF conversion (a tuner), IF demodulation, signal conditioning, analogue-to-digital conversion, luminance (UV) and chrominance (YUV) extraction, correction and filtering. The first two functions were performed by a front end, the remainder by video processing ICs like the Philips Semiconductors SAA7110 \"One-Chip Frontend\" OCF1, Brooktree and ATI Rage Theatre ICs. Because the video output was by definition not synchronized with the PC clock, and because PC monitors don't use interlaced but progressive scanning, the digital UV and YUV signals were written into a full frame picture memory. A Video Memory Controller finally read the memory driven by requests from the PC OS and put the signals on the ISA or PCI bus.\n\nThe advantage of this architecture was that the video processor IC required a CVBS video signal, exactly the output provided by the AV7300 tuner module as well as the typical FQ800, FS900 or FQ900 TV front ends already presented earlier. So that's how the Philips BU Tuners entered the what was called the \"Multimedia\" arena.\n\nThe Philips FI916E/IEC, the very first multimedia frontend, using inter-carrier IF.\n\nAt least in the beginning the PC-TV application was much sim"
