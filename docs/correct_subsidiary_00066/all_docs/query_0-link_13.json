        "text": "Royal Philips Electronics subsidiary Philips Semiconductors (Tempe, AZ) plans to add at least 50 positions to its Tempe facility within the next year and continue to grow at that rate in subsequent years. By 2003, employment is expected to double at the site, with most new positions in engineering, marketing, and technology development.\n\nPhilips Semiconductors will establish the worldwide headquarters for its Standard Analog business at the Tempe site. In addition to Standard Analog, increased emphasis and staffing will be focused in the Networking business line, the Computing and ASIC business line, and related technology development organizations.\n\nThis site in Tempe was formerly part of VLSI Technology Inc., which was acquired by Philips in June 1999."
