        "text": "In considering the NeuroSys Cluster4Future as a whole, the orchestration of its diverse activities resembles project designs in the field of transformation research. The field spans various discourses and approaches rooted in the social sciences (Heyen and Brohmann 2017). They range from sustainability transition studies and transition management (Geels and Schot 2007; Loorbach 2010; Rip et al. 1998), over innovation studies (Ömer-Rieder and Tötzer 2004; Smith et al. 2010), diffusion research (Rogers 1995; Wilson 2012), and change management (Boje et al. 2012), to literature on post-growth and sufficiency (De Saille et al. 2020; Jackson 2009; Stengel 2011). While there is little consensus on the definition of transformation (Feola 2015), the following examples tend to be associated with the term: the shift towards a low-carbon future (Foxon et al. 2013; Geels 2018), changes in media and communication sparked by the Internet and smart phones (Dolata and Schrape 2013; Küng et al. 2008), and “smart agenda[s]” (Köhler et al. 2019, p. 15) for mobility, urban development, and product manufacturing (Luque-Ayala and Marvin 2015; Manders et al. 2018; Van Agtmael and Bakker 2016). What these examples have in common is that they associate the introduction of new technologies with wider changes in society, economy, and geography. However, what makes a change transformative, whether transformation is radical and/or gradual, and how transformation relates to other concepts, such as transition, regime shift, resilience, and adaptation are topics of discussion in transformation research (Köhler et al. 2019).\n\nThis chapter sidesteps these discussions because transformation research in NeuroSys is not predominantly a social science endeavor. Although it resembles engaged social science approaches that initiate and shape transformation processes while describing and analyzing them at the same time (Herberg et al. 2021; see also Feola 2015; Heyen and Brohmann 2017), transformation research is considered as a transdisciplinary undertaking in NeuroSys in which all projects (see A–E in Sect. 3) participate. In NeuroSys, transformation research refers to science and technology development that is intertwined with societal, economic, and regional changes, while also reflexively engaging with processes and outcomes of change. Science and technology development can be considered as reflexive if the researchers involved can position themselves and their work within these wider changes to capture and anticipate how they themselves shape and are shaped by such changes (Stirling et al. 2006).\n\nAs these definitions are closely aligned with Letmathe et al.’s (this volume) model of transformation research, this chapter is structured according to the four dimensions of that model: technology, economics, society, and environment. In applying these dimensions to NeuroSys, the chapter demonstrates how a holistic transdisciplinary approach to transformation research can be put into practice. While the technological dimension elaborates on the kinds of technologies developed in the cluster, the economic dimension assesses their potential to enter and transform markets. The societal dimension discusses how building an innovation ecosystem around neuromorphic computing shapes—and is shaped by—structural, political, and cultural changes in the region. Both the societal and the environmental dimension further elucidate how an innovation ecosystem can be steered in order to support socially desirable, ethically acceptable, and environmentally benign research and innovation processes.\n\n4.1 Technology\n\nTechnology development in NeuroSys is characterized by a co-design of neuromorphic hardware and tailor-made software. Whereas the design of hardware and software is split traditionally by a well-defined interface—the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)—new processing principles in the neuromorphic computing domain promote a sequential approach: material and devices are defined first and inform the subsequent development of architectures, algorithms, and applications (Schuman et al. 2022). Quite differently, NeuroSys engages in a co-design process all across the design hierarchy (Fig. 3). In this co-design process, specific needs of algorithms and applications can influence the development of novel devices and material systems; at the same time, novel algorithms and learning models are developed that exploit the technical capabilities of neuromorphic hardware (Aimone 2021). Hence, the high performance of neuromorphic hardware at low energy consumption is a result of innovative connections between new materials and devices and the functions of entire AI systems (Chakraborty et al. 2020).\n\nThese connections are subject to a “technology push” and an “application pull” (Grunwald 2019, p. 76). On the one hand, results from basic research on materials and devices can push the development of algorithmic approaches. For example, emerging hardware devices inspired by the plasticity of the human brain can stimulate the development of new neuromorphic computing algorithms, which match how plasticity functions on these devices (Parsa et al. 2020). On the other hand, applications can pull hardware development into specific directions. The accuracy demands of applications can help to define the requirements of a specific crossbar implementation as well as the size and number of crossbars in a corresponding System-on-Chip. The push–pull dynamic requires hardware and software developers to engage in a continuous collaborative process of alignment, for instance, between the compute complexity required for highly-performant applications and the capabilities of neuromorphic hardware.\n\nIn NeuroSys, the application pull is stronger than in ordinary high-tech projects because industry actors are involved in early stages of the research and development process. Their involvement focuses on use cases of neuromorphic computing technology. Although there is currently no commercial neuromorphic computing technology available, Schuman et al. (2022) predict two wide areas of AI applications. First, neuromorphic computers could accelerate AI operations on personal computing devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and desktops. Neuromorphic accelerators improve battery life by realizing AI operations with significantly less power than today’s state-of-the-art accelerators.\n\nSecond, low power consumption of neuromorphic hardware is also relevant for edge-computing applications. Edge computing refers to a type of computing where data analysis and processing are performed close to the points of data generation. Instead of sending data to a cloud service for remote processing, edge computing allows data to be processed locally, which supports data security and privacy by reducing network traffic (De Salvo 2018; Li and Huang 2021). These features are relevant for the following application areas: autonomous systems, such as vehicles and drones (Viale et al. 2021); remote sensors, especially in energy-constrained environments (Vanarse et al. 2017); robotics (Cheng et al. 2020); wearable technology and prostheses (Daus 2022; Osborn et al. 2018); and the Internet of Things, which is of particular interest in industrial contexts and smart homes (Fayyazi et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2017).\n\nFrom this range of potential applications, four use cases are investigated in NeuroSys:\n\n1.\n\nA camera-based measurement device will be developed for medical applications. The device will generate visual and thermal images of wounds whose diagnoses will be made with the help of neural networks. As the device is supposed to be mobile and light, it could be used in hospitals and care facilities.\n\n2.\n\nA speech recognition and translation system will be built that relies on edge computing. The system will enable real-time language translation on mobile devices, such as smartphones.\n\n3.\n\nA basic technology of semantic video analysis will be created for application in different domains. Examples are video editing on smartphones, segmentation of organs on medical images, and tracking of traffic participants in intelligent vehicles.\n\n4.\n\nAn invasive medical controller will be developed, which helps to adjust treatment measures to the changing biological measurements of a patient through reinforcement learning algorithms. Such a medical controller could be an artificial pancreas or a pacemaker.\n\nThese cases were selected because they all rely on energy-efficient hardware for mobile use but vary in terms of data: visual and thermal images, oral speech and written texts, video recordings, and biological measurements such as blood glucose concentration and heartbeat. These kinds of data have different features and their processing must satisfy specific demands. For example, the data rate of an artificial pancreas is low, but the device must be highly accurate in predicting treatment measures. Video segmentation systems, by contrast, must handle relatively large volumes of data, but the importance of accuracy varies per application (e.g., video editing for personal use vs. traffic tracking in autonomous cars). By tailoring algorithms to these use cases, NeuroSys tests the potential of neuromorphic computing hardware to satisfy diverging application demands. Moreover, speech recognition and language translation systems as well as semantic video analysis were selected as use cases because they depend on complex AI models which have high demands for their underpinning hardware. Hence, these technologies are “hard” use cases and could become prototypical benchmarks for the development of neuromorphic hardware.\n\nNeuroSys researchers assess whether neuromorphic hardware is as performant as conventional hardware in working with hundreds of millions of parameters. Whereas neuromorphic computing hardware has been shown to outperform conventional microprocessors in terms of energy efficiency (Hsu 2014), Schuman et al. (2022) state that there is yet to appear an AI application for which neuromorphic computing is superior to other deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy (the number of an algorithm’s correct predictions divided by the number of its total predictions). The authors anticipate a variety of challenges that could stifle the growth in neuromorphic algorithm and application development, for instance the lack of established benchmarks and metrics to evaluate which hardware system is most suitable for a given application and the integration of neuromorphic computing in a heterogenous computing environment. More specifically, Zidan et al. (2018) outline materials and device challenges of memristor-based neuromorphic hardware as it is developed in NeuroSys.\n\nWhile enumerating the technical challenges of neuromorphic hardware development would go beyond the scope of this chapter, it is important to emphasize that they indicate a gap between expectations and reality. The history of microelectronic reveals that it can take a long time for such a gap to be closed. It took nearly four decades from the postulation of the memristor by Chua in 1971 until scientists from Hewlett Packard labs made the first operational memristor (Chua 2018; Mainzer 2022). Sometimes, the expectation-reality gap was never closed; several microelectronic devices (e.g., the Josephson junction and molecular electronics) promising to provide alternatives to the dominance of conventional silicon chips were studied for decades but failed to reach practical application and disappeared from view (Mody 2017).\n\nNeuromorphic hardware is nowadays available in research communities, but it has not been used in real-world applications yet. However, market researchers and developers of neuromorphic computing technology predict that neuromorphic chips will be available on the market in about 3–5 years (La Barbera and Huang 2022; Yole Report 2021). Although these predictions are promising, NeuroSys has set itself an ambitious agenda. As the hardware systems and applications studied in NeuroSys primarily target prototype demonstrations in the first three years of the funding period, the cluster starts its activities on a mid-level technology readiness level. This means that the cluster seeks to facilitate an early market transfer of a technology under development whose commercial competitiveness is a topic of ongoing investigation—a task further advanced by the economic dimension of NeuroSys.\n\n4.2 Economics\n\nThe economic dimension of NeuroSys supports one of the cluster’s main objectives: achieving technological sovereignty for Europe in semiconductor and AI research, development, and production. This objective is aligned with the European Chips Act adopted in 2023. After years of decline in semiconductor investment (Fig. 4), the Chips Act aims to increase Europe’s share of global chip production capacity to 20% from its current level of about 10% (Timmers 2022). As the global chip crisis exposed supply chain vulnerabilities which led to production stops (Pennisi 2022), the Chips Act strives to bring parts of the value chain to Europe.\n\nIn support of European technological independence, NeuroSys seeks to build an innovation ecosystem in the Aachen region, where neuromorphic computing chips will be designed and produced in close collaboration with companies that incorporate these chips in their products. To ensure the long-term usability of the innovations that will arise from NeuroSys, the economic dimension will evaluate possible business models. Moreover, the value chains of neuromorphic chips and associated products will be mapped to assess their feasibility with regard to its organization structure and the necessary competencies along the value chain. It is important for the establishment of neuromorphic hardware and software in the respective markets to identify possible cost savings, which can affect both the production and the use of the hardware. For this reason, the study of the cost structures and value chains relevant to the production of neuromorphic hardware and software must be analyzed in detail. The same applies to the markets in which the resulting innovations are applied. This research is a prerequisite for commercializing NeuroSys innovations; it will also inform later analyses of external costs as well as quantifications of socio-environmental impacts.\n\nTo stimulate and inform entrepreneurial activities in and around NeuroSys, the economic dimension will quantify the target market potential of neuromorphic computing technologies. The market potential can be assessed on the basis of applications for which neuromorphic computing offers tailored solutions (see Sect. 4.1). However, the market potential of these applications is difficult to estimate at present because neuromorphic computing hardware has not yet reached market maturity. While the exact amount of neuromorphic computing hardware in future applications is still unknown, these applications can be organized into three categories. First, existing applications will be supplemented by neuromorphic hardware. Second, some applications will stimulate a production shift toward neuromorphic hardware because neuromorphic hardware is equally—or better—suited to performing a specific task. Here, the monetary benefit of the unique advantages of neuromorphic hardware will determine when the underlying technology of existing applications will be changed. Third, novel applications will emerge that are not possible or even conceivable with current hardware.\n\nThe first two categories target a certain share of existing markets. One of those markets is AI. According to a Statista (2022a) report (using the forecast from International Data Corporation), the global AI market is expected to reach up to 552.3 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2024. This includes hardware (server, storage), software (applications, software platforms, system infrastructure software, application development and deployment), and services (business services, IT services) (ibid.). The market size of machine learning, deep learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, context-aware computing, and computer vision is estimated to reach 227.46 billion U.S. dollars by 2024 and is expected to rise to 1,591 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2030 (ibid., using the forecast from GlobeNewswire). These estimates emphasize the growing demand for AI applications. Considering only the market for AI hardware, the market revenue is forecast to grow from 15.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 to 70.9 billion U.S. dollars by 2026 (Statista 2022b). A major customer of AI hardware will be the automotive industry, whose market size is expected to increase from 30 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 to 55 billion U.S. dollars by 2025 (Statista 2022c).\n\nAlthough the specific market penetration of neuromorphic computing cannot be anticipated accurately at present, the general market predictions for neuromorphic applications are promising. Therefore, NeuroSys could have an impact on the competitive development of the wider high-tech sector and could transform the labor market in the Aachen region. Students, researchers, engineers, and other professionals will be attracted to the region both for education and employment in neuromorphic computing research, development, and production. To establish a platform for expert training, the university and further organizations involved in NeuroSys plan to develop and offer new fields of study as well as degree programs. In this vein, university education will be complemented by learning opportunities for industry employees with the support of business development agencies, such as RWTH Innovation GmbH and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aachen. Hence, NeuroSys’ investments in the local semiconductor workforce complement the high investments of the European Chips Act in semiconductor manufacturing (Heck 2022). This step is crucial to build an innovation ecosystem around neuromorphic computing technologies, which secures their long-term economic success.\n\n4.3 Society\n\nThe societal dimension of NeuroSys focuses on the social order which enables and supports the emergence of an innovation ecosystem around the development of neuromorphic computing hardware in the Aachen region. Although the notion “innovation ecosystem” has been adopted with diverging meanings by academic, management, and policy-making discourses (Autio and Thomas 2021; Chhillar 2022), it is used here to denote an interacting set of actors who seek to realize the assumed beneficial outcomes of innovation (Adner 2017). The establishment of such an innovation ecosystem is an essential driving force for the socio-technical transformation process, which Van Agtmael and Bakker (2016) describe as a shift from “rustbelt” to “brainbelt” (p. 23). The authors use the American term “rustbelt” for areas in the USA and Europe which were once powerful industrial sectors but then experienced decline due to the elimination or outsourcing of manufacturing. They observe that some former rustbelts have become brainbelts: local research and development of smart products transform regions into innovation hubs. This transformation is driven by a collaborative ecosystem of universities, small and medium-sized companies, start-ups, local authorities, and a variety of supporters and suppliers. The reason is that one single research institute or company is not in a position to pursue the development of smart products, like computer chips, new materials, biotechnology, and medical devices. To tackle the complex tasks of developing smart products and transferring them into the market, transdisciplinary collaborations need to be established. An innovation ecosystem provides the social, material, and institutional conditions for such collaborations to emerge.\n\nTo transform the Aachen region—formerly a coal mining area—into an innovation hub, the NeuroSys project seeks to create an innovation ecosystem around the development of neuromorphic computing hardware. The NeuroSys cluster pools a transdisciplinary set of actors from RWTH Aachen University, Research Center Jülich, the non-profit Research and Technology Organization AMO GmbH, and regional technology companies as well as start-ups. The cluster is not a closed entity; it is the nucleus of an expanding innovation ecosystem. A resource for the organic growth of the ecosystem is the advisory board, which includes regional, national, and European members from science, industry, and society. All involved actors constitute a dynamic system which connects the research and development activities anchored in the cluster with innovation initiatives stimulated by external partners, such as the City of Aachen, the regional competence platform KI.NRW, and European projects launched under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. NeuroSys is thus a “connector” (Van Agtmael and Bakker 2016, p. 26): an organized group with the vision, the relationships, and the motivation for catalyzing the emergence and growth of an innovation ecosystem (Fig. 5).\n\nTo study the development of an innovation ecosystem from a social science perspective, different strands of literature are combined. The multi-level perspective is instructive for analyzing transformation processes of socio-technical systems (Geels 2004; Geels and Schot 2007). It distinguishes between three levels: a cultural, political, and material landscape, socio-technical regimes constituted by the practices of different actor groups, and the niche which is the nucleus of innovation. Climate change and associated political calls for sustainable AI, for example, in the European Green Deal (Gailhofer et al. 2021), can be regarded as pressures in the landscape. These pressures create instability in the regimes (e.g., technological and product regime, science regime, user and market regime) which preserve the existing socio-technical system around the use of GPU-based hardware for AI applications. Neuromorphic computing hardware may take advantage of such instability and may break through markets once it has been sufficiently developed in the technological niche of NeuroSys, i.e., a space protected by public subsidies and strategic company investments (Fig. 6).\n\nFor a new technology to move out from a niche into companies and markets, quadruple helix collaborations can support the transfer. Quadruple helix collaborations are a form of research and innovation in which actors from research institutes, industry, government, and civil society collaborate toward realizing a shared innovation goal (Carayannis and Campbell 2009). Such collaborations are important, especially if public subsidies for technology development come with high political and societal pressure on researchers to find a solution to a grand challenge. These pressures may induce researchers to continue working on the seemingly promising technological solution despite negative outcomes (Geels and Raven 2006). To avoid hype-backlash dynamics (Garud and Karnøe 2003), technological niches could incentivize researchers to flexibly adjust technology development and evaluation routines in response to continual feedback by users, policy makers, and special-interest groups. Such multi-stakeholder learning can occur in quadruple helix collaborations.\n\nThe opportunities and challenges that arise from bringing together diverse groups of actors in collaborative projects have been studied in historical and social science scholarship (Mody 2017; Nguyen and Marques 2021; Popa et al. 2020). Collaboration and networking provide support for knowledge sharing, but they depend on relationships of trust. The reason is that research groups and companies may fear the loss of competitive advantage due to knowledge leakage (Bogers 2011; Chesbrough 2003), especially in the current geopolitical climate of the semiconductor industry, where “technology theft” by Asian competitors is suspected (Li et al. 2021, p. 122). While non-disclosure agreements among universities and companies may be time-intensive and cumbersome (Berlin 2017; Parthasarathy 2017), the creation of legal and technological frameworks around a new technology can facilitate market entry in the long run. The development of reporting and benchmarking guidelines across research fields and streamlining quality, security, and sustainability standards across markets and national contexts supports the inclusion of the technology in existing infrastructures, processes, and products (Cheng et al. 2022; Van Den Ende and Kemp 1999).\n\nAnother aspect of quadruple helix collaborations is the participation of societal stakeholders. Participation has become a key concept in social science literature on the production of knowledge and innovation (Kimura and Kinchy 2019; Lezaun et al. 2017). It is often considered to be the defining feature of “transdisciplinary research,” which denotes the collaboration between researchers and non-academic actors (Defila and Di Giulio 2015). Despite the ubiquitous talk about the importance of transdisciplinarity in academic and policy discourses, empirical research on practices of participation reveals that inputs from societal stakeholders and wider publics are often not included in innovation processes (Felt et al. 2012a, 2016; Irwin et al. 2012). One reason is that stakeholders have different interests, goals, and perspectives, which may be in tension with one another (Blok et al. 2015a, b). The tension between economic profit and socio-ethical considerations has been widely discussed in business ethics and responsible innovation literature (Garst et al. 2017; Hahn et al. 2018), and practical strategies to manage this tension have been proposed (Almquist et al. 2016; Long and Blok 2017; Porter and Kramer 2011).\n\nBuilding on this literature, a holistic approach that takes socio-ethical considerations into account in the process of research and development is embedded in NeuroSys. The following list provides examples of such considerations:\n\nTrust in AI: Social acceptance of AI technologies is conditioned on trust in these technologies (O’Neill 2018; Thiebes et al. 2021). Trust is breached if AI output discriminates on the basis of race, gender, or age, or if data security cannot be warranted (Amoore 2020; Benjamin 2019; Chun 2021).\n\nHuman autonomy and AI: Research has shown that users of AI systems are concerned about these systems violating their autonomy, for instance, by paternalistic nudging or impoverishing capacities for self-determination through increasing deferral of decision-making processes to algorithms (Laitinen and Sahlgren 2021; Nagel 2016).\n\nSustainability of AI: The production of neuromorphic computing hardware is likely to have environmental costs, for example with regard to the extraction of minerals, water, and fossil fuels, which can be undergirded by pollution, extinction, depletion, and war (Crawford 2021; Letmathe and Wagner 2018).\n\nThe societal dimension of NeuroSys does not only study the socio-ethical aspects of neuromorphic computing but also helps to sensitize actors in the innovation ecosystem to these aspects. The aim is to facilitate the governance of a “responsible innovation ecosystem” (Smolka and Böschen 2023; Stahl 2022). Responsible innovation ecosystem governance is conceptualized as a “capacity” (Fisher 2007; Guston 2014; Guston and Sarewitz 2002) of actors to integrate the societal dimensions of research and innovation into their work. As capacities are shaped by wider political, institutional, and material structures, it needs to be investigated which socio-technical architecture of the innovation ecosystem supports socio-ethical reflection and responsible decision-making. The evolution of the innovation ecosystem around NeuroSys is thus a socio-technical transformation in which reflexive technology development, collaborative innovation, and responsible governance are intertwined. Instead of probing consumer and public reactions once a specific neuromorphic computing technology is ready for purchase, societal acceptance emerges in a collaborative process of “integrative” (Fisher et al. 2015) research and development. For this purpose, social and technoscientific experts continuously collaborate with one another, rather than engaging in a division of labor. A division of labor is common in technical projects with an add-on social science task force, such as in typical forms of Begleitforschung (Kromrey 2017; Schikowitz and Maasen 2021). NeuroSys, by contrast, builds an ecosystem linking social and technological innovation inextricably with each other. In adopting this approach, NeuroSys could become a role model for other regions, technologies, and research projects.\n\n4.4 Environment\n\nNeuroSys seeks to introduce neuromorphic computing to AI-dominated software domains, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and autonomous decision-making, where conventional computer hardware reaches its limits of performance and energy efficiency. High energy demands for training neural networks with deep learning methods are of environmental concern because energy is currently not derived from carbon–neutral sources in many locations, and, where renewable energy is available, it might be better allocated elsewhere (Strubell et al. 2019). Strubell et al. estimate that the process of training a deep-learning natural language processing model consumes roughly the same amount of energy as five cars over the cars’ lifetimes (ibid., p. 1). In light of the global climate change crisis, algorithms that can perform mental tasks may not be worth the environmental costs. NeuroSys aims to create more “sustainable AI” (Van Wynsberghe 2021) which reduces the environmental impacts (e.g., carbon footprints) of developing and using AI models.\n\nThe environmental dimension of NeuroSys approaches sustainable AI holistically by not equating sustainability with energy efficiency but by adopting a broader view: critical interrogations of “techno-fix” narratives accompany technology development. Techno-fix narratives are based on a dominant rationality in society and policy-making according to which global challenges like climate change can be “fixed” by technological innovation that is advanced by technoscientific experts (Ludwig et al. 2021). Speculative technological innovations are cast as solutions to biodiversity, public health, and climate change crises (Thomas 2015). These narratives do not acknowledge that complex issues like climate change are “wicked problems” (Peters 2017; Rush 2019) that have neither a straightforward problem definition nor a solution because they can be approached from different disciplinary perspectives and may affect stakeholders in drastically different ways. A critical interrogation of a techno-fix narrative related to neuromorphic computing asks whether switching to more energy-efficient computer hardware will indeed reduce the carbon footprints of AI applications. To answer this question, the environmental dimension of NeuroSys follows Bratton’s suggestion: “If we really want transformation, we have to slog through the hard stuff (history, economics, philosophy, art, ambiguities and contradictions). Bracketing it off to the side to focus just on technology, or just on innovation, actually prevents transformation” (Bratton cited in Thomas 2015, p. 93).\n\nHistorical, economic, and societal considerations need to be considered when exploring the relations between neuromorphic computing technology and carbon emissions because of the so-called “rebound effect” (Santarius 2012, 2015; Santarius et al. 2016). The concept denotes an increased energy demand that is driven by efficiency improvement. Santarius distinguishes between different types of rebound effects to explain why energy efficiency improvements often fail to translate into adequate absolute reductions of energy service demand. From the diversity of rebound effects that could be related to neuromorphic computing, two examples are presented here. A financial rebound effect may occur if neuromorphic computing hardware is used for new energy-intensive multi-feature AI applications rather than for making existing products more energy-efficient. Material rebound effects can result from (a) the energy consumed in the research, development, and production process of neuromorphic computing hardware, and (b) in building new capacities as well as infrastructures necessary for the implementation of this new type of hardware in products."
