However, the market cannot be so easily tricked. The closing price of Xerox stock last Friday (April 13, 2018), before many of the sordid details came to light, was $28.17 per share, which is approximately 14% below the closing price on the day prior to the announcement of the scheme and approximately 37% below management’s purported deal value of $45.00 per share.\n\nNoted Columbia law school Professor John Coffee summarized the transaction and the process behind it as follows: “This is a strange and irregular transaction that is simply not comparable to any other transaction I have seen in over 45 years of observing the ‘merger and acquisition’ marketplace. A CEO of the target, facing likely ouster, serves as the loyal agent of the acquirer, designing a deal that is too good to be true: a cheap price, little governance protections, no market check, and a process that ignores other bidders.”\n\nWe could not have said it better ourselves.\n\nWe fully expect that Xerox will not prevail in its shameful attempt to keep hidden from shareholders the many other sordid facts surrounding this unfortunate transaction that are still being concealed due to the machinations of Xerox’s lawyers. Despite their attempts to bury the truth, the fundamental economics of the scheme – which dramatically undervalue Xerox and disproportionately favor Fuji – are undeniable. Therefore, we are confident you will agree that the only choice here is to vote out the worst of Xerox’s directors and to oppose the proposed Fuji scheme.\n\nWe look forward to engaging with you further over the upcoming weeks and months. Please stay tuned for more.\n\nSincerely yours, Carl Icahn Darwin Deason\n\n*****\n\nAdditional Information and Where to Find it;\n\nParticipants in the Solicitation\n\n2\n\nSECURITY HOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES BY CARL ICAHN, DARWIN DEASON AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES FROM THE SHAREHOLDERS OF XEROX CORPORATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN XEROX CORPORATION AND FUJIFILM HOLDINGS CORPORATION (THE “TRANSACTION”) AND/OR FOR USE AT THE 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF XEROX CORPORATION (THE “ANNUAL MEETING”) WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN SUCH PROXY SOLICITATION.

UNDERPERFORMANCE , MISMANAGEMENT AND POOR GOVERNANCE AT XEROX Poor shareholder returns • 1 , 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns significantly lag peers and broader benchmarks Phantom “cost cuts” • Xerox touts ~ $ 1 . 2 B in “cost cuts” over the past two years, but only ~ $ 30 M of those “cuts” flowed to the bottom line Disgraceful governance • Failure to disclose “crown jewel” lock - up agreement with Fuji for at least 17 years SECTION II. THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH FUJI – GIVING AWAY CONTROL WITHOUT A PREMIUM Highly unusual structure • Tortured and convoluted transaction structure in which Fuji will acquire a 50 . 1 % controlling interest in Xerox Skewed risk profile • Fuji will take control of Xerox and receive $ 120 million more in annual dividends from Xerox “without spending a penny\" No control premium • Even if shareholders assume that the combined entity will achieve a majority of the forecasted $ 1 . 7 B in synergies – which current management has never demonstrated the capability to do – the transaction only provides ~ $ 28 of value per share Relative values disproportionately favor Fuji • In Xerox’s analysis, Fuji Xerox is valued based on a multiple of 2018 E adjusted EBITDA that is 2 . 5 turns higher than Xerox , even though Fuji Xerox has 40 % lower margins, a higher mix of manufacturing, is on pace to report consecutive years of revenue declines and is still reeling from a massive accounting scandal Insufficient minority protections • Fuji will continue to compete with Xerox post - closing (for example, in certain categories of high - end equipment, which account for ~ 20 % of Xerox’s total equipment revenue), which will provide ample opportunities for Fuji to abuse its control of Xerox to take market share solely for its own benefit Conflicted, poorly - run process • Negotiations were led by a conflicted Xerox CEO, who betrayed shareholders by “serv[ing] as a loyal agent of the acquirer” in “a process that ignore[d] other bidders” and was conducted without a proper market check SECTION III. OUR PLAN FOR XEROX – A BETTER, BRIGHTER FUTURE AS A STANDALONE COMPANY Four Part Plan to Increase Shareholder Value 1. Unlock growth through new adjacent services and partnerships 2. Drive bottom - line cost savings through network consolidation and channel optimization 3. Monetize untapped intellectual property 4. Re - evaluate Asia - Pacific market with a stronger management team SECTION IV. COMPARING THE VALUE PROPOSITIONS • We believe our plan could create total value of $ 54 to $ 64 per share compared to ~ $ 28 per share in the proposed transaction , while retaining operating control and the prospect of receiving a true control premium in the future Shareholders should vote AGAINST the proposed Fuji/Xerox transaction and FOR a new board of directors that can drive much needed change and maximize shareholder value\n\n7 SECTION I.

Those costs have not flowed all to the bottom line on our side, because we're offsetting whether it's currency headwinds , declines in revenues , this past year, about 4.7% in constant currency.” - William Osbourn, Xerox CFO 5 “Currency headwinds” and “declines in revenues” only account for 22% of the offsets — the full “cost savings” were in reality offset by ~$556M of “cost creep” Xerox Operating Margin $1,351 $1,316 ($65) ($82) ($12) $680 ($556) (1) 2016 Adjusted Operating Margin (2) 2017 Revenue Decline (3) 2017 Fx Impact (4) 2017 Equity Income Decline (5) 2017 Cost Savings (6) 2017 Cost Creep (7) 2017 Adjusted Operating Margin Xerox management touts $ 680 M of cost savings in 2017 , but ~ $ 556 M of those cost savings were offset by opaque “cost creep” 12.5% 12.8%\n\n10 Source: Xerox 2017 10 - K $1.23B of “cost cuts” but only 30 bps or ~$30M of margin improvement In fact, only $ 30 M of management’s apparent $ 1 . 23 B of “cost cuts” over the past two years flowed to the bottom line Select Xerox Financials Fiscal Year Ending December 31, (USD in millions) 2015 2016 2017 Revenue $11,465 $10,771 $10,265 COGS $6,883 $6,510 $6,204 % of Revenue 60.0% 60.4% 60.4% Gross Profit $4,582 $4,261 $4,061 % Margin 40.0% 39.6% 39.6% SG&A $2,865 $2,695 $2,631 % of Revenue 25.0% 25.0% 25.6% Operating Cash Flow $1,078 $1,018 $122 Memo: Ending Cash $1,228 $2,223 $1,293 Adjusted Operating Profit $1,435 $1,351 $1,316 % Margin 12.5% 12.5% 12.8% Fx Impact on Margin ($11) ($65) ($82) Memo: Adverse Transaction Currency % (0.1%) (0.6%) (0.8%) YoY Δ Fuji Xerox Equity Income ($51) $18 ($12) Gross Cost Savings (as reported) -- $550 $680\n\n11 Xerox also has a disgraceful governance record – the Company concealed the “crown jewel” lock - up it gave Fuji at least 17 years ago and now claims that the lock - up prevents anyone other than Fuji from buying Xerox • The proposed transaction is the result of an improper and fraudulently concealed “crown jewel” lock - up buried in the JV agreements that Xerox and Fuji entered into at least 17 years ago • Xerox says the “crown jewel” lock - up in the JV agreements “limit[s] Xerox’s strategic flexibility” such that Xerox could not run a more customary process to explore a sale to a private equity buyer or another strategic acquirer • Yet t he very first mention to shareholders of this lockup did not occur until nine days after the proposed Fuji deal was announced (i . e . , when it could be used to push through a self - serving transaction), even though at least one Xerox director (Charles Prince) was already pointing out the lock - up to his personal contacts • This intentional deceit prevented shareholders from ever having the opportunity to push management to terminate or renegotiate the JV agreements, which would have given Xerox more flexibility to pursue strategic alternatives over the past 17 years “[It’s] sad : a (formerly iconic) US company selling control to a Japanese company … . But there is a Joint Venture Agreement … which made it practically impossible for Xerox to sell to anyone else … . A really amazing problem” - Charles Prince (Xerox director), in a personal email, February 1, 2018\n\n12 But we believe Xerox never thoroughly explored transactions with other buyers or tried to capitalize on its obvious points of leverage over Fuji … Last year’s massive accounting scandal at Fuji Xerox almost certainly gives Xerox the right to terminate the JV agreements for material breach Alternatively, Xerox could begin the process of terminating the Technology Agreement in 2020, which would give Xerox unfettered access to the Asia Pacific market and would also be absolutely catastrophic for Fuji While the “crown jewel” lock - up is deal restrictive, Xerox still has options that the current board and management have never wanted to pursue for their own selfish reasons At a minimum, each of these termination rights could be used as leverage to renegotiate the terrible terms in the JV agreements\n\n13 … and the experts agree with us! The Xerox Board claims the proposed transaction with Fuji followed a “comprehensive review” and “careful consideration of all alternatives available to the company” 1 But Columbia Law School professor and world renowned corporate governance expert John C. Coffee Jr. reviewed the record and concluded the following: “This is a strange and irregular transaction that is simply not comparable to any other transaction I have seen in over 45 years of observing the ‘merger and acquisition’ marketplace. A CEO of the target [Xerox], facing likely ouster, serves as the loyal agent of the acquirer, designing a deal that is too good to be true: a cheap price, little governance protections, no market check, and a process that ignores other bidders.” 1) See Xerox press release dated January 31, 2018 But we now know that – contrary to the advice of its own financial advisor – the Xerox Board NEVER reached out to ANY potential strategic acquirers and only ever contacted three potential financial sponsors\n\n14 Based on this record, should we really trust that Xerox’s current management and board have negotiated a transaction that maximizes shareholder value? History tells us the answer is NO Current Xerox Leadership’s “Accomplishments” • Shareholder returns below peers and relevant benchmarks • $1.2B of “cost cuts” that did not actually flow to the bottom line • Shameful mismanagement of the Fuji relationship o Concealed “crown jewel” lockup buried in JV agreements from shareholders for at least 17 years o Failed to leverage the massive accounting scandal that Fuji oversaw at Fuji Xerox (see slide 20) o Failed to leverage the fact that Xerox is likely Fuji Xerox’s largest single customer -- 15 - 20% of revenue (see slide 35 - 36 ) o Executed an M&A transaction process with Fuji without: ▪ Conducting a proper market check ▪ Replacing a conflicted CEO as the lead negotiator ▪ Forming a special committee ▪ Adequately considering or pursuing alternative opportunities that came to the company o Negotiated and approved the proposed transaction, which : ▪ Gives away control of Xerox without a control premium (see slide 17) ▪ Dramatically undervalues Xerox (see slide 18) ▪ Disproportionately favors Fuji (see slide 21) ▪ Renders Xerox shareholders virtually powerless to protect their investment going forward (see slides 24 - 25) • Critical strategic and operational failures o Failure to capitalize on $20+ billion market opportunity to expand services to mid - market and SMB (see slide 28) o Failure to partner with PC manufacturers that have no footprint in adjacent print space (see slide 29) o Failure to develop a coherent, efficient e - commerce and distribution network (see slides 30 - 32) o Failure to monetize or commercialize valuable assets and innovations (see slides 33 - 34)\n\n15 SECTION I.

Xerox also inflates the proposed transaction’s value by capitalizing 100 % of the purported synergies using that same lofty and unjustified premium (USD in billions) Xerox's View of Synergy Value 1 Realistic View of Synergy Value EV / Adj EBITDA 7.5x 5.0x Run-Rate Synergies $1.25 $0.75 Enterprise Value $9.4 $3.8 (x) Xerox Ownership of New Co 49.9% 49.9% EV Attributable to Xerox Shareholders $4.7 $1.9 EV Attributable to Xerox Shareholders (PV) $3.2 $1.3 Xerox Fully Diluted Shares 267M 267M Synergy Value to Xerox Shareholders $12 / share $4.8 / share 2\n\n23 On a net cash flow basis, the multiple Xerox shareholders receive in the proposed transaction is an outrageously low 2 . 3 x 1) Equal to (i) the $ 2 . 5 B special dividend minus (ii) ~ 50 % of the $ 2 . 5 B of debt incurred to finance that dividend (since Xerox shareholders will own ~ 50 % of the company incurring that debt) 2) For detailed backup see Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason’s joint letter to Xerox shareholders dated February 12 , 2018 3) Based on Xerox’s 2017 Adjusted Operating Income on page 26 of Xerox’s Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings presentation, plus depreciation and amortization not already adjusted for, less equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 4) Xerox will own ~ 50 % of its own cash flow post - closing 5) We are netting out the estimated cash flow Xerox shareholders will receive from owning an additional ~ 25 % interest in Fuji - Xerox (as explained in our February 12 , 2018 letter to shareholders) in order to come up with an accurate estimate of the cash flow Xerox shareholders are surrendering in exchange for the $ 1 . 25 B net dividend • Xerox shareholders are selling ~ $ 535 million of normalized annual recurring net cash flow for just ~ $ 1 . 25 billion 1 • The below breakout uses Xerox’s actual 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (to derive a recurring “cash in the bank”), which we believe is the best way to analyze the proposed transaction (USD in millions) 2017A Xerox 2017 Stand Alone Adjusted EBITDA 3 $1,675 Annual Maintenance Capex (175) Annual Interest Expense (200) Xerox 2017 Stand Alone Cash Flow $1,300 ~50% of Stand Alone Cash Flow 4 (650) Xerox 2017 Cash Flow Contributed $650 Additional ~25% of Fuji-Xerox Cash Flow 5 ($115) Net Xerox Cash Flow Contributed $535 Value Received for ~50% of Xerox's Net Cash Flow $1,250 Multiple 2.3x Xerox's Net Contributed Cash Flow 2\n\n24 In addition, if the proposed deal closes, Xerox shareholders will be passive minority owners of a Fuji subsidiary – virtually powerless to prevent Fuji from abusing its control For example, Fuji competes directly against Xerox in the market for high - end inkjet products What's to stop Fuji from shutting down Xerox's inkjet business just to benefit its competing Fuji Ink business? o When asked on a recent UBS conference call if this was a risk, Xerox’s Chief Commercial Officer said: “I don’t think so.” 3 o But Xerox’s lawyers know it’s a risk – that’s why elsewhere Xerox warns shareholders that “Fujifilm may have different interests [than yours]…and may make decisions adverse to your interests.” 4 Fuji will have a myriad of opportunities to oppress us as minority shareholders 1) Per page 34 of Xerox 2017 10 - K 2) Per page 7 of Fujifilm 2017 Integrated Report 3) Per call with investors held by UBS on March 12, 2018 (emphasis added) 4) Per page 18 of Xerox 2017 10 - K 20 % of Xerox’s total equipment revenue is attributable to sales of its high - end equipment, which includes production quality inkjets 1 11 % of Fuji’s consolidated revenue is attributable to its Graphic Systems segment, which markets inkjet products worldwide 2 The truth is that Fuji is well positioned to take advantage of Xerox shareholders post - closing . They already have Xerox management convinced that post - closing Fuji and the combined Fuji Xerox will be “ one company and one entity ” 3 even though they will have (A) competing businesses and (B) two separate and distinct shareholder bases .\n\n25 Just imagine the most plausible worst - case scenario – the result will be massive value destruction for Xerox shareholders Do you really believe the new Fuji controlled board will look out for the best interests of Xerox shareholders if management can’t achieve the synergies or (like in the past) can’t make them flow to the bottom line? 1. Cost savings don’t flow through and synergies miss expectations 2. The combined company continues to lose market share 3. Fuji begins to siphon off value, beginning with shuttering Fuji - Xerox’s inkjet business 4. The market realizes minority shareholders have little recourse against Fuji 5. The stock price plummets as the market extrapolates the downward trend and prices in a massive minority discount END RESULT: Xerox shareholders sold control for $9.80 in cash and a stub share worth a few dollars\n\n26 SECTION I.
