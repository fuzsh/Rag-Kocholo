More specifically, the present invention pertains to an arrangement of fine alignment targets used for aligning a stepper shot and a wafer.\n\nIntegrated circuit dies are fabricated en masse on silicon wafers using well-known techniques such as photolithography. Using these techniques, a pattern that defines the size and shape of the components and interconnects within a given layer of the integrated circuit die is applied to the wafer. The pattern applied to the wafer is laid out in an array, or matrix, of reticle images. A wafer stepper holds the pattern over a wafer and projects the pattern image of the reticle onto the wafer through a lens. The area on the wafer upon which the image is projected is defined as a stepper shot.\n\nStepper 100 includes a light source 122 , masking blades 124 , a reticle 126 , a lens 128 , and a stage 112 .\n\nthe light source 122 projects light through an opening 126 a of masking blades 124 , through the transparent portion of a pattern 126 a on reticle 126 , through lens 128 and onto a wafer 133 located on the stage 112 .\n\nthe pattern 126 a of the reticle 126 is reproduced on the wafer 133 , typically at a 5:1 reduction.\n\na pattern located on an inner, or center, portion of the reticle 126 passes through a center portion 128 a of lens 128 .\n\na pattern 126 b located on an outer, or peripheral, portion of the reticle 126 passes through an outer portion 128 b of lens 128 .\n\nthe integrated circuit is essentially built-up by forming on the wafer 133 a multitude of interconnecting layers, one layer on top of another. Because the layers interconnect, a need arises for ensuring that the patterns on wafer 133 are accurately positioned and formed. Conventional methods rely on precise alignment of the wafer 133 , the stage 112 , the lens 128 and the reticle 126 in order to accurately fabricate an integrated circuit.\n\nAccurate formation of an image on a wafer using photolithography can be affected by several error-causing variables. These variables include rotational alignment error, translational alignment error, and lens distortion error, among others. Each one of these error-causing variables can be corrected by a different part of the stepper. It is desirable to segregate the types of errors and measure them independently so that the error measurements are not confounded and so that the resulting corrections for each variable will not be conflicting and counterproductive.\n\nthe rotational alignment error caused by rotational movement of the reticle 126 relative to the wafer 133 (or vice versa), is of particular interest with regard to the discussion herein. As described above, it is desirable to segregate rotational error from the other error-causing variables in order to compensate for the true measurement of rotational error.\n\nalignment targets 14 and 16 are placed on the wafer 133 in order to ensure that the final alignment of the wafer 133 and the reticle 126 ( FIG. 1 ) is correct before the integrated circuit is formed.\n\nthe alignment targets 14 and 16 are located within the scribe line region of a stepper shot 12 .\n\na stepper shot 12 may be comprised of multiple integrated circuit dies or a single die. Multiple stepper shots are performed until the entire wafer 133 is exposed.\n\nFIG. 2A illustrates an arrangement using only two alignment targets 14 and 16 .\n\nAlignment target 14 is used for acquiring the y-direction offset\n\nalignment target 16 is used for acquiring the x-direction offset.\n\na deviation of the alignment targets 14 and 16 from their expected location or orientation is interpreted as a translational error when, in actuality, it may be a rotational error or a lens distortion error.\n\nPrior Art design guides specify that alignment target 18 must be placed in a location where it will not interfere with the y-direction measurement mark (e.g., alignment target 14 ) on the y-coordinate. Consequently, alignment target 14 and alignment target 18 are not aligned with each other and are separated in the y-direction by an offset 20 .\n\nthe amount of offset 20 is measured to determine the amount of rotational error. That is, for example, the amount of offset 20 is known for the case where there is no rotational error. If stepper shot 12 is rotated clockwise, the amount of offset 20 will increase relative to this amount, and the amount of the increase can be translated to a measurement of rotational error.\n\nall three alignment targets 14 , 16 and 18 need to be acquired and the deviation from their expected positional values measured.\n\nthe targets are acquired for multiple shots in order to obtain the measurements needed to determine rotational error.\n\nthe alignment targets 14 , 16 and 18 may need to be acquired and measured multiple times per wafer. The time and the processing effort needed to acquire the targets, obtain measurements, and calculate rotational error can limit the throughput of the stepper.\n\nproper focusing of the alignment scope used to acquire targets 14 , 16 and 18 is required in order to acquire the targets with the precision necessary for calculating rotational error.\n\nThis focusing may be performed for every wafer or at some other frequency (e.g., every other wafer, every fifth wafer, etc.). At any rate, the time needed to complete the focusing task can further limit the throughput of the stepper.\n\nthe present invention provides a method and system thereof that can properly compensate for rotational error in the integrated circuit fabrication process.\n\nthe present invention also provides a method and system that can satisfy the above need and that can save measurement and processing time, thereby potentially improving stepper throughput.\n\nthe present embodiment of the present invention pertains to a method and system thereof for fabricating integrated circuits using four fine alignment targets per stepper shot.\n\nthe present invention pertains to a wafer that has four fine alignment targets per stepper shot.\n\nthe present invention pertains to a reticle used to form the four alignment targets on the wafer.\n\nthe four alignment targets are formed within the scribe line on each side of a four-sided stepper shot.\n\nthe alignment targets on opposites sides of the stepper shot are located in mirror-image positions.\n\nthe alignment targets are located at the mid-point of each side of the stepper shot. In another embodiment, the alignment targets are located at each corner of the stepper shot.\n\nthe alignment targets each include a plurality of rectangles that have prescribed dimensions (e.g., length and width).\n\nthe alignment targets are formed using a positive resist process and thus will consist of solid (e.g., chrome) rectangles in a clear field.\n\nthe alignment targets are formed using a negative resist process and thus will consist of a dark field (e.g., chrome) background with rectangular windows (e.g., non-chrome regions) formed therein.\n\na second alignment target formed in one shot will overlay a first alignment target formed in a preceding shot (e.g., a right-hand target in a first stepper shot will be overlaid by the left-hand target in the adjoining stepper shot).\n\nfirst and second targets With no rotational error (no rotation of the stepper shot relative to the wafer), the first and second targets will be aligned, and the rectangles that make up the alignment target will retain their prescribed dimensions.\n\nthe first and second alignment targets in adjoining stepper shots will not be aligned, and the dimensions of the rectangles that make up targets will change by an amount corresponding to the amount of rotation. That is, with solid rectangles in a clear field, the width of the rectangles will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the amount of rotational error, and with clear rectangles in a dark field, the width of the rectangles will be increased by an amount corresponding to the amount of rotational error.\n\nthe center line of the rectangles, and hence the alignment target will remain unchanged even with the rotation, thereby compensating for the rotational error without the need for measurement.\n\nthe effect of the rotational error is, in essence, canceled out by the placement of the four alignment targets in accordance with the present invention.\n\nthe rotational error is reduced by one-half.\n\nthe rotational error for this latter case is minimized and will therefore consume a smaller portion of the budget overlay requirement.\n\nthe alignment target resulting from the overlay of alignment targets in adjoining stepper shots will compensate for rotation about the center of a stepper shot. Consequently, it is not necessary to acquire the alignment targets in order to determine rotational error, saving time and reducing processing and thereby potentially increasing stepper throughput.\n\nthe alignment approach of the present invention uses four alignment targets per stepper shot, the precision of the fabrication process can be increased relative to conventional approaches.\n\nFIG. 1 is a side view of one embodiment of a stepper in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFIGS. 2A and 2B show arrangements of alignment targets according to the prior art.\n\nFIG. 3 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a stepper in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFIG. 4A shows the general layout of a integrated circuit die in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 4B shows an arrangement of alignment targets according to one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 4C shows an arrangement of alignment targets according to another embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 5 shows target patterns in an alignment target in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 6A illustrates a target mark in an alignment target with no rotational error in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 6B illustrates a target mark in an alignment target with clockwise rotation about the center of a stepper shot in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 6C illustrates a target mark in an alignment target with clockwise rotation about the left-center of a stepper shot in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 7 is a flowchart of the steps in a process for forming alignment targets on a wafer in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 8 illustrates a top perspective view of a wafer with alignment targets in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nStepper 202 includes a stage 208 coupled to a stage movement device 210 , a processor 212 , a signal transceiver 204 , and a memory 214 .\n\nWafer 206 is placed on stage 208 for processing in stepper 202 .\n\nMemory 214 contains program instructions implemented through processor 212 .\n\nMemory 214 can either be permanent memory, such as read only memory (ROM), or temporary memory, such as random access memory (RAM).\n\nMemory 214 can also be any other type of memory storage capable of containing program instructions, such as a hard drive, a CD ROM, or flash memory.\n\nProcessor 212 can either be an existing system processor or microprocessor, a dedicated digital signal processing (DSP) processor unit, or a dedicated controller or microcontroller.\n\nthe program instructions may be implemented using an implementation of a state machine.\n\nSignal transceiver 204 is coupled to processor 212 .\n\nSignal transceiver 204 is a source of an electromagnetic signal, such as a laser. Additionally, signal transceiver 204 is a receiver for an electromagnetic signal, such as the return signal that is reflected from wafer 206 .\n\nFIG. 4A shows the general layout of a single integrated circuit die element 400 on a wafer (e.g., wafer 206 of FIG. 3 ).\n\ndie element 400 is illustrated as square-shaped, it is appreciated that die element 400 may be rectangular-shaped.\n\nDie element 400 comprises integrated circuit die 401 , which is surrounded by an input/output (I/O) pad area 402 , a guard ring 403 , and a scribe line 404 .\n\nthe scribe line 404 contains inserts and production marks (e.g., the alignment marks of FIG. 4B or 4 C) used during the manufacture of integrated circuit dies from a wafer.\n\nthe scribe line 404 is overlaid from side to side and from top to bottom. That is, a segment of the scribe line in one stepper shot is overlaid by a segment of the scribe line of the adjoining stepper shot. For example, the right-hand portion of a scribe line of a first stepper shot is overlaid by the left-hand portion of a scribe line of the adjoining stepper shot.\n\nFIG. 4B shows an arrangement of alignment targets 420 a , 420 b , 430 a and 430 b in a stepper shot 410 on a wafer 206 according to one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nstepper shot 410 is illustrated as square-shaped, it is appreciated that stepper shot 410 may be rectangular-shaped.\n\nAlignment targets 420 a , 420 b , 430 a and 430 b are disposed within the scribe line of stepper shot 410 (e.g., scribe line 404 of FIG. 4A ).\n\nthe arrangement of alignment targets illustrated by FIG. 4B also corresponds to a target pattern on a reticle used to form alignment targets 420 a , 420 b , 430 a and 430 b on wafer 206 in stepper shot 410 .\n\nalignment targets 420 a and 420 b are on opposite sides of stepper shot 410 and are positioned in mirror-image locations. In the present embodiment, alignment targets 420 a and 420 b are located at the mid-point of opposite sides of stepper shot 410 . Similarly, alignment targets 430 a and 430 b are positioned in mirror-image locations on the other two opposite sides of stepper shot 410 . In the present embodiment, alignment targets 430 a and 430 b are located at the mid-point of opposite sides of stepper shot 410 .\n\nalignment targets 420 a , 420 b , 430 a and 430 b can be positioned at other than the mid-points of the sides of stepper shot 410 , as long as alignment targets 420 a and 420 b are in mirror-image positions on opposite sides, and alignment targets 430 a and 430 b are in mirror-image positions on the other two opposite sides.\n\nFIG. 4C shows an arrangement of alignment targets 440 a , 440 b , 440 c and 440 d according to another embodiment of the present invention.\n\nalignment targets 440 a , 440 b , 440 c and 440 d are located at the corners of stepper shot 410 .\n\nthe scribe lines 404 for each stepper shot 410 are overlaid by an adjoining stepper shot, as described above. Accordingly, the alignment targets in the scribe lines 404 will also be overlaid by an alignment target of an adjoining stepper shot. For example, alignment target 430 b in a first stepper shot will be overlaid by alignment target 430 a in a subsequent stepper shot adjoining, and to the right of, the first stepper shot.\n\nthe use of four alignment targets, and their arrangement in mirror-image positions in the scribe line of a stepper shot provides an efficient and precise method and system for segregating and compensating for rotational error (refer to FIGS. 6A through 6C , below).\n\nthe use of four alignment targets per stepper shot will increase the precision of the alignment process.\n\nlens distortion error may be averaged out or reduced.\n\nFIG. 5 shows target patterns 500 a and 500 b in an alignment target (e.g., the targets of FIGS. 4B and 4C ) in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nthe target pattern 500 a comprises a plurality of solid (typically, chrome) rectangles 510 in a clear field 512 .\n\nthe target pattern 500 b comprises a plurality of clear rectangles 520 in a solid (typically, chrome) background 522 .\n\nthe target patterns 500 a and 500 b are formed using a known positive or negative photoresist process.\n\ntarget patterns 500 a and 500 b Although six rectangles are shown in each of target patterns 500 a and 500 b , it is understood that any number of such rectangles can be used in accordance with the present invention. Furthermore, other types of target patterns and designs can be used in accordance with the present invention; one such design is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,984 by P. Leroux and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and which is hereby incorporated by reference. It is also understood that the target patterns of FIG. 5 correspond to target patterns on a reticle that is used to form target patterns 500 a and 500 b on wafer 206 in stepper shot 410 ( FIGS. 4B and 4C ).\n\nrectangles 510 and 520 are precisely specified.\n\nthe rectangles 510 and 520 have a width of four (4) microns and a length of 30 microns.\n\nthese dimensions are not critical to the present invention, and different dimensions can be used.\n\nFIG. 6A illustrates the alignment of a target mark (e.g., a rectangle 510 ) in an alignment target (e.g., the alignment targets of FIGS. 4B and 4C ) for the case where there is no rotational error.\n\nthe alignment target of one stepper shot will be overlaid by the alignment target of a subsequent, adjoining stepper shot; for example, alignment target 430 b in a first stepper shot will be overlaid by alignment target 430 a in a subsequent stepper shot adjoining, and to the right of, the first stepper shot.\n\nthe alignment target formed as a result of the overlay of alignment targets will be referred to as the âoverlay targetâ or the âresultant target.â\n\nthe target marks e.g., rectangles 510\n\nthe target marks of alignment target 430 a from the second stepper shot\n\nthe target marks of alignment target 430 b from the first stepper shot\n\nthere will be no change in the specified dimensions of each rectangle 510 in the overlay target e.g., each rectangle 510 will still measure 4 microns by 30 microns. Consequently, the center (centroid) of each rectangle 510 in the overlay target is unchanged, and the centroid of the overlay target is also unchanged.\n\nFIG. 6B illustrates a target mark (e.g., rectangle 510 ) in an alignment target (e.g., the alignment targets of FIGS. 4B and 4C ) for the case in which there is clockwise rotation about the center of each stepper shot, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 6B can also illustrate the case in which a first stepper shot is properly aligned (no rotational error) and a second, adjoining stepper shot is rotated about its center. As a result in either case, the alignment target 430 a of the second stepper shot will not precisely align with the alignment target 430 b of the first stepper shot.\n\na target mark e.g., rectangle 630\n\na target mark e.g., rectangle 632\n\nrectangle 510 resulting from the overlay of rectangles 630 and 632 will be formed. Accordingly, rectangle 510 of the overlay target will have reduced dimensions (that is, its width will be something less than 4 microns, depending on the amount of rotation). However, for the case in which the rotation occurs about the center of a stepper shot, the center (centroid) of rectangle 510 will not change, and thus the centroid of the overlay target is also unchanged. Note that, for the negative resist process, the rectangle 510 resulting from the overlay of rectangles 630 and 632 will have increased dimensions (that is, its width will be something more than 4 microns, depending on the amount of rotation).\n\nthe effect of the rotation is canceled out because the centroid of the overlay target is unchanged. That is, the centroid of each resultant rectangle 510 in the overlay target, and hence the centroid of the overlay target, remains coincident with the center of the stepper shot. Accordingly, the rotation of the stepper shot can be compensated for by finding the centroid of the overlay target, as if there was no rotation. As such, measurements and calculations needed to determine rotational error are not necessary, saving both fabrication time and processing time and potentially increasing the throughput of the stepper.\n\nFIG. 6C illustrates a target mark (e.g., rectangle 510 ) in an alignment target (e.g., the alignment targets of FIGS. 4B and 4C ) for the case in which there is clockwise rotation about the center of one side of each stepper shot, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 6C can illustrate the case in which, for example, a first stepper shot is properly aligned (no rotational error) and a second, adjoining stepper shot is rotated about its left-center.\n\nthe alignment target 430 a of the second stepper shot will not precisely align with the alignment target 430 b of the first stepper shot.\n\na target mark (e.g., rectangle 640 ) of alignment target 430 a (of the second stepper shot) will not align with a target mark (e.g., rectangle 642 ) of alignment target 430 b (of the first stepper shot).\n\nrectangle 510 resulting from the overlay of rectangles 640 and 642 will be formed. Accordingly, rectangle 510 of the overlay target will have reduced dimensions (that is, its width will be something less than 4 microns, depending on the amount of rotation). Note that, for the negative resist process, the rectangle 510 resulting from the overlay of rectangles 630 and 632 will have increased dimensions (that is, its width will be something more than 4 microns, depending on the amount of rotation).\n\nthe effect of the rotation is canceled out because the centroid of the overlay target is unchanged. That is, the centroid of each resultant rectangle 510 , and hence the centroid of the overlay target, remains coincident with the center of the stepper shot.\n\nmeasurements and calculations needed to determine rotational error are not necessary, saving both fabrication time and processing time and potentially increasing the throughput of the stepper.\n\nthe magnitude of the rotational error is reduced and therefore may not be a significant portion of the overlay budget requirement.\n\nFIG. 7 is a flowchart of the steps in a process 700 for forming alignment targets (e.g., the alignment targets of FIGS. 4B and 4C ) on a wafer 206 ( FIGS. 4B and 4C ) in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nMany of the instructions for the steps, and the data input and output from the steps, of process 700 utilize memory and utilize controller hardware shown in FIG. 3 .\n\nwafer 206 , stage 208 , and signal transceiver 204 can be controlled by memory 214 and processor 212 to accomplish the requirements steps in process 700 .\n\nAlternative embodiments of FIG. 3 are equally applicable to implementing the steps of process 700 .\n\nprocess 700 is utilized in a stepper machine, the present invention is well-suited to other devices needing wafer alignment.\n\nsoftware in memory 214 does not need to be modified for process 700 .\n\nprocess 700 of the present embodiment shows a specific sequence and quantity of steps\n\nthe present invention is suitable to alternative embodiments.\n\nthe present invention is well-suited to an embodiment which includes more or less steps than process 700 .\n\nthe sequence of the steps can be modified depending upon the application.\n\nprocess 700 is shown as a single serial process, it can also be implemented as a continuous or parallel process.\n\nstep 710 of FIG. 7 a wafer 206 is received at stepper 202 ( FIG. 3 ).\n\na first stepper shot 410 is performed.\n\nfour alignment targets are formed in scribe line 404 of stepper shot 410 .\n\nthe four alignment targets are positioned as shown by FIG. 4B ; that is, alignment targets 420 a and 420 b are located in mirror-image positions on opposite sides of stepper shot 410 , and alignment targets 430 a and 430 b are similarly located.\n\nthe four alignment targets 440 aâb are positioned as shown in FIG. 4C .\n\na second stepper shot 410 with four alignment targets is performed.\n\na segment of scribe line 404 of the second stepper shot overlays a segment of scribe line 404 of the first stepper shot, such that an alignment target of the second stepper shot overlays an alignment target of the first stepper shot.\n\nthe left-hand portion of scribe line 404 of the second stepper shot can overlap the right-hand portion of scribe line 404 of the first stepper shot, in which case alignment target 430 a of the second stepper shot would overlay alignment target 430 b of the first stepper shot.\n\nalignment target 430 b (of the second stepper shot) would precisely align with alignment target 430 a (of the first stepper shot).\n\nalignment target 430 b (of the second stepper shot) will not precisely align with alignment target 430 a (of the first stepper shot); however, the centroid of the overlay target formed as a result of the overlay will still indicate the center of the shot. Accordingly, there is not a need to measure or calculate the magnitude of the rotational error, and the rotation of the second stepper shot can be compensated for by finding the centroid of the overlay target.\n\nalignment target 430 b (of the second stepper shot) will not precisely align with alignment target 430 a (of the first stepper shot).\n\nthe centroid of the overlay target formed as a result of the overlay will be different from the center of the shot due to rotational error; however, the magnitude of the rotational error will be reduced by one-half relative to conventional methods.\n\nFIG. 8 illustrates a top perspective view of a wafer 830 with a multiplicity of alignment targets 835 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nWafer 830 is partitioned into a number of shots exemplified by shot 840 .\n\nshots 850 , 852 , 860 , 862 , 870 , 872 , 880 and 882 have four alignment targets 835 located at the mid-point of each their sides, as described in conjunction with FIG. 4B , above.\n\neach shot 840 can have four alignment targets 835 in accordance with the present invention.\n\nalignment target 836 is located at the right-hand side of shot 850 and the left-hand side of shot 852 . As described above, alignment target 836 is formed by overlapping the left-hand target of shot 852 and the right-hand target of shot 850 . Thus, alignment target 836 is actually the composite of targets formed in two different shots.\n\na certain number of shots are selected for the alignment.\n\neight shots may be selected for alignment.\n\nadjacent shots share alignment targets, as described previously herein.\n\na target such as alignment target 836 in effect represents two shots (e.g., shots 850 and 852 ).\n\nthe number of shots selected for alignment can be reduced by one-half while still maintaining the current level of precision.\n\nthe precision can be increased two-fold if the number of shots selected for alignment is not reduced.\n\nanother advantage to the present invention is that it can advantageously increase throughput without loss of precision, or increase precision without loss of throughput.\n\nthe present invention thus provides a method and system thereof that can properly compensate for rotational error in the integrated circuit fabrication process.\n\nthe present invention also provides a method and system that can save measurement and processing time, thereby potentially improving stepper throughput.\n\nLandscapes\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nCondensed Matter Physics & Semiconductors (AREA)\n\nManufacturing & Machinery (AREA)\n\nComputer Hardware Design (AREA)\n\nMicroelectronics & Electronic Packaging (AREA)\n\nPower Engineering (AREA)\n\nExposure Of Semiconductors, Excluding Electron Or Ion Beam Exposure (AREA)\n\nExposure And Positioning Against Photoresist Photosensitive Materials (AREA)\n\nUS09/737,606 2000-12-14 2000-12-14 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment Expired - Lifetime US7067931B1 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (8)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US09/737,606 US7067931B1 (en) 2000-12-14 2000-12-14 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment JP2002550447A JP2004516661A (ja) 2000-12-14 2001-12-13 ã¹ãããã¢ã©ã¤ã¡ã³ãã®ããã®èªå·±è£æ­£ãã¼ã¯ã®é ç½® EP01270811A EP1346262A1 (en) 2000-12-14 2001-12-13 Self-compensating mark arangement for stepper alignment KR1020027010486A KR100873799B1 (ko) 2000-12-14 2001-12-13 ì§ì  íë¡ ì ì¡°ì© ì¨ì´í¼, ì ë ¬ íê² íì±ì© ë í°í´, ì ë ¬íê² íì± ë°©ë² PCT/IB2001/002507 WO2002048798A1 (en) 2000-12-14 2001-12-13 Self-compensating mark arangement for stepper alignment CN018079393A CN1217237C (zh) 2000-12-14 2001-12-13 ç¨äºæ­¥è¿æºå¯¹åçèªè¡¥å¿è®°å·è£ ç½® TW097149228A TW200924015A (en) 2000-12-14 2002-01-23 A self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment US11/412,596 US7556893B2 (en) 2000-12-14 2006-04-26 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US09/737,606 US7067931B1 (en) 2000-12-14 2000-12-14 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment\n\nRelated Child Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US11/412,596 Division US7556893B2 (en) 2000-12-14 2006-04-26 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment\n\nPublications (1)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date US7067931B1 true US7067931B1 (en) 2006-06-27\n\nFamily\n\nID=24964543\n\nFamily Applications (2)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US09/737,606 Expired - Lifetime US7067931B1 (en) 2000-12-14 2000-12-14 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment US11/412,596 Expired - Fee Related US7556893B2 (en) 2000-12-14 2006-04-26 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment\n\nFamily Applications After (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US11/412,596 Expired - Fee Related US7556893B2 (en) 2000-12-14 2006-04-26 Self-compensating mark design for stepper alignment\n\nCountry Status (7)\n\nCountry Link US (2) US7067931B1 (zh) EP (1) EP1346262A1 (zh) JP (1) JP2004516661A (zh) KR (1) KR100873799B1 (zh) CN (1) CN1217237C (zh) TW (1) TW200924015A (zh) WO (1) WO2002048798A1 (zh)\n\nCited By (3)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US20070091328A1 (en) * 2005-10-21 2007-04-26 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
