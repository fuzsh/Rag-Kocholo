He has been named by IP Law360 a “Legal Lion” for his lead counsel patent infringement jury trial victories. He was selected to The California Daily Journal’s List of Top Plaintiff’s Attorneys for Year 2023. He was ranked a top 30 patent litigator nationally for year 2023 based on an in-depth evaluation of 17,052 patent litigators in Patexia’s Report of Best Patent Litigators of 2023, an honor reserved for top-tier professionals who demonstrated their prowess and ascended to the upper echelon in the field. He also ranked in the top 50 best performing patent litigators in the country for the six-year period 2017-2022 by Patexia 2023 Patent Litigation Intelligence Report, a comprehensive analysis of the best patent litigators in the country. He was also named to IAM 1000’s list of top patent litigators for year 2024, and was peer selected as a “Northern California Super Lawyer” in IP Litigation, reserved for the top 5% of attorneys nationally in 2024. Recently, he was also named to IAM 300’s prestigious national list of the top 300 IP strategists in 2024.\n\nRecently, Mr. Kramer was lead counsel for plaintiff winning a $172.6 million jury verdict of willful infringement against Micro Focus Corp., a Hewlett-Packard spin-off company that acquired HP’s software business for $8 billion. This resounding victory was the largest jury verdict in the history of the Sherman Division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Rob was likewise lead trial counsel winning two major jury trials in the widely followed Finisar litigation, one of the largest patent infringement cases in the country between competitor optical networking companies. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Kramer’s client in two trials, and within two hours of his closing argument in the second of these heavily fought jury trials.\n\nRob, as lead counsel, and the Kramer Alberti team were included on the National Law Journal’s List of “100 Largest Verdicts in the U.S,” and honored to be named on Texas Lawyer Magazine’s “Top 10 Patent Infringement Verdicts of the Year” (winning the 3rd largest verdict). Rob has represented clients in patent disputes involving a wide range of products and industries, including wireless technologies, networking, mobile and cellular telecommunications, smart grid utility networking systems, data compression and transmission, microprocessors, power over ethernet (PoE), IEEE 802.3, programmable logic arrays (PLAs), semiconductor manufacturing and packaging equipment, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), optics and optical networks, wavelength selective switches (WSS and ROADMs), databases, software, graphics, electronic gaming, industrial equipment, chemicals and adhesives, biometric authentication, and Internet patents. In addition, Rob has worked with standard essential patents (SEP) and FRAND licensing. Rob represents universities, including U Michigan, and is a member of AUTM.\n\nRob was a partner and national chair of the Dentons law firm’s Patent Litigation Practice from 2012-2019 before he and his team joined Kramer Alberti (then Feinberg Day), as was widely reported in The American Lawyer, IP Law 360, and other publications. He is a frequent author and lecturer on patent and intellectual property law topics and was an adjunct professor of law at Temple University and a guest lecturer at Waseda University in Tokyo teaching patent law. Rob serves as the co-chair of the American Bar Association Intellectual Property Litigation Committee’s Section 112 Subcommittee.\n\nHe served on the Board of Governors of the Association of Business Trial Lawyers. Rob has been Chambers ranked, and he is consistently honored as a “Northern California Super Lawyer” in IP Litigation, including in 2023. He also serves on IP Law360’s California Editorial Board.\n\nHe has been recognized as a leading patent practitioner by Law360, IAM Patent 1000, Super Lawyers, Legal 500 US and BTI Consulting. Rob started his career in New York. He was a judicial extern for U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and upon graduating from law school was a Judicial Law Clerk for Judge Richard Simons, Associate Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. He was trained as a litigation associate at a major New York law firm for five years before relocating to San Francisco/Silicon Valley to continue practicing as an intellectual property litigator where he was a full equity partner at Morrison & Foerster LLP."
