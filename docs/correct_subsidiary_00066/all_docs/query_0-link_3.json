        "text": "1999-03-13 ,\n\nNews Flash\n\nPhilips Electronics takes step to expedite $17 per share cash offer for VLSI technology\n\nRoyal Philips Electronics (NYSE:PHG) yesterday announced it is taking another step to expedite the consummation of its $17.00 per share cash tender offer for VLSI Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:VLSI).\n\nPhilips remains hopeful that VLSI will enter into negotiations soon. However, in the event it is necessary to proceed with a consent solicitation, Philips has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a consent statement seeking consents of VLSI stockholders to remove the VLSI Board of Directors and replace them with nominees who, subject to their fiduciary duties, would allow the Philips offer to proceed. Philips is also giving notice to VLSI that it is requesting that a record date be set for the purpose of establishing which VLSI stockholders are entitled to participate in the consent solicitation. Philips expects to be prepared to mail its consent statement to VLSI stockholders in approximately two weeks.\n\nOn March 5, 1999, Philips commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares of VLSI at a price of $17.00 per share in cash. The offer represents a 58% premium to VLSI's closing price of $10.75 per share on February 25, the last trading day prior to disclosure of Philips' letter to the VLSI Board of Directors offering to acquire VLSI for $17.00 per share.\n\nDetails of Philips' proposal, as well as the consent procedure, are described in Philips' Schedule 14A which was filed yesterday with the SEC.\n\nPhilips Media Relations\n\nJeremy Cohen, tel. +31 20 5977213\n\nThe following information is required under United States Securities Law:\n\nCERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING PARTICIPANTS\n\nThe entities and individuals named below may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of consents by KPE Acquisition Inc. (the \"Purchaser\"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. (\"Royal Philips\"), to remove and replace the board of directors of VLSI Technology, Inc. (\"VLSI\") in connection with the Purchaser's tender offer (the \"Offer\") for the shares of common stock (the \"VLSI Shares\") of VLSI. The participants in this solicitation may include the Purchaser; the directors of Purchaser (William E. Curran and Guido R.C. Dierick); the non-director executive officer of Purchaser (Belinda Chew); Royal Philips; and the directors and executive officers of Royal Philips: Cor Boonstra (President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Management and Group Management Committee), Dudley G.

Pieper (Executive Vice-President and Member of the Board of Management and the Group Management Committee), Ad H.A. Veenhof (Member of the Group Management Committee and Chairman of the Domestic Appliances and Personal Care Division), Kees Bulthuis (Member of the Group Management Committee and Senior Managing Director of Corporate Research), J. M. Barella (Member of the Group Management Committee and Chairman of the Medical Systems Division), A.B.

Kleisterlee (Member of the Group Management Committee and Chairman of the Components Division), J.P. Oosterveld (Member of the Group Management Committee and Senior Director of Corporate Strategy), A.

Bruijel (Member of the Group Management Committee responsible for Corporate Human Resources Management), F.A. Maljers (Chairman of the Supervisory Board), A. Leysen (Member of the Supervisory Board), W. Hilger (Member of the Supervisory Board), L.C. van Wachem (Member of the Supervisory Board), C.J. Oort (Member of the Supervisory Board), L. Schweitzer (Member of the Supervisory Board), Sir Richard Greenbury (Member of the Supervisory Board) and W. de Kleuver (Member of the Supervisory Board).\n\nRoyal Philips has retained Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (\"CSFB\") to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Offer, for which CSFB will receive customary fees, as well as reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, Royal Philips has agreed to indemnify CSFB against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement. CSFB is an investment banking firm that provides a full range of financial services for institutional and individual clients. CSFB does not admit that it or any of its directors, officers, employees or affiliates is a \"participant,\" as defined in Schedule 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the solicitation, or that such Schedule 14A requires the disclosure of certain information concerning CSFB or such persons. In connection with CSFB's role as financial advisor to Royal Philips, CSFB and the following investment banking employees of CSFB may communicate in person by telephone or otherwise with a limited number of institutions, brokers or other persons who are stockholders of VLSI: George Boutros (Managing Director) and Jason Dilullo (Vice President). CSFB engages in a full range of investment banking, securities trading, market-making and brokerage services for institutional and individual clients. In the normal course of its business, CSFB may trade securities of VLSI for its own account and the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. CSFB informed Royal Philips that as of March 9, 1999, CSFB held a net long position of 1,440 VLSI shares.\n\nAs of the date of this communication, Royal Philips, together with its subsidiaries, beneficially owns an aggregate of 1,235,000 VLSI Shares, or approximately 2.7% of the VLSI Shares. Other than as set forth herein, none of the foregoing participants beneficially owns VLSI Shares."
