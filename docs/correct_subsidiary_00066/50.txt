Dutch consumer electronics company Royal Philips Electronics NV is suing VLSI Technology Inc. to block a poison pill defense against Philips' $777 million hostile tender offer.

In its suit, Philips claims VLSI is hindering shareholders from taking advantage of the $17-a-share offer by delaying its decision on whether or not to support the bid and rescind the pill. If VLSI's pill is allowed to stand, it will be triggered as soon as Philips acquires 20% or more of VLSI's common stock.

The lawsuit also seeks to invalidate a dead hand provision that would prevent a newly-elected board from removing the pill if it is triggered by the board it replaces.

Philips made its $17 per share cash offer to VLSI on Feb. 26, 1999, a 58% premium over the previous day's closing stock price, and requested a response by March 3. In response, VLSI said it would review the proposal and make a recommendation to its stockholders on March 23.
