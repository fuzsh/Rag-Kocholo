WHAT HAD SAEED AKHTAR MIRZA SAID

In an interview with Indian Express, screenwriter and director Saeed Akhtar Mirza dissed The Kashmir Files. He said, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.”
