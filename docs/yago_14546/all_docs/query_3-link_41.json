        "text": "Vivek shared a screenshot of Saeed's statement and tweeted, \"Maine kaha Mirza sahab ko Salaam. Fir milte hain Janaab, The Delhi Files ke baad (I say, salutations to Mirza sir. Let us meet again after The Delhi Files). 2024.\"\n\nTalking about The Kashmir Files, Saeed had told Indian Express, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.”\n\nEarlier this year, Vivek had announced that he will make a film titled The Delhi Files and later confirmed that the film is set for 2024 release. “I thank all the people who owned The Kashmir Files. For last four years we worked very hard with utmost honesty and sincerity. I may have spammed your TL (timeline) but it’s important to make people aware of the GENOCIDE and injustice done to Kashmiri Hindus. It’s time for me to work on a new film. #TheDelhiFiles,\" he tweeted in April this year.\n\nFeaturing Mithun Chakraborty, Anupam Kher, Darshan Kumar, and Pallavi Joshi in lead roles, The Kashmir Files talks about the 1990 exodus and killings of Kashmir Pandits. While critics of the film call it ‘propaganda’ and misappropriation of facts, Vivek and his team insist the film is based on first-hand accounts of families of those killed the 1990s in Kashmir."
