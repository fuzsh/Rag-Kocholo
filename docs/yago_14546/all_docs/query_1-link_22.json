        "text": "In 1969, three unusual Hindi films started doing the rounds of the film festival circuit in India: Basu Chatterjee’s Sara Aakash (The whole sky, 1969), Mrinal Sen’s Bhuvan Shome (1969), and Mani Kaul’s Uski Roti (His Daily Bread, 1969, released 1970). Though very different films, all shared the same cinematographer and wore the visual influence of European art cinema on their sleeves.1 Crucially, all three were adaptations of modern Indian literature, following in the footsteps of Satyajit Ray’s The Apu Trilogy (Pather Panchali [Song of the little road, 1955], Aparajito [The Unvanquished, 1956], and Apur Sansar [The World of Apu, 1959]). Since the early 1960s, Indian cinephiles had been hungry for a homegrown new wave, their hunger whetted by their exposure to the few European art films that circulated through the efforts of [End Page 24] amateur film societies and through the International Film Festival of India (held in 1952, 1955, and annually since 1965).2 To contemporary audiences, the near-simultaneous appearance of Sara Aakash, Bhuvan Shome, and Uski Roti in 1969—with their whimsical editing, fresh-faced casts, and naturally lit images of the world outside of studio sets—felt like a long-awaited breath of fresh air. The New Wave moment had finally arrived in India and had arrived to stay.3\n\nA generous catalog of the Indian New Wave, or the New Indian Cinema, over the next two decades would comprise around a hundred films in five languages. Yet, barring a small set of works by a familiar roll call of internationally recognized auteurs (Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and Shyam Benegal), little critical attention has been paid to arthouse Indian cinema, which remains strangely absent in most catalogs of world cinema— poorly archived and rarely watched or taught outside of India.\n\nThis article explores a remarkable aspect of Indian New Wave film-making: the deep and enduring ties with modern Indian literature that allowed New Wave films to serve as a contact zone between the worlds of print and celluloid. Partly due to the state-owned Film Finance Corporation’s preference for funding low-budget films based on the work of “eminent writers in Hindi and other national languages” and partly due to middle-class investment in print culture during this period of socialism and economic stagnation, modern Indian literature played a crucial role in the Indian New Wave.4 Not only did an astonishing number of New Wave films have their roots in modern Indian literature, but the very form of this cinema also often aspired to literariness. While there has been some analysis of the relationship [End Page 25] between film and literary culture in the case of Bengali, Kannada, and Marathi, this article focuses on the largely unstudied relationship between postcolonial Hindi print culture and the New Cinema.5 From the late 1960s to the mid-1990s, the so-called Indian New Wave became a source of endless commentary and discussion in the Hindi public sphere, acting as a bridge between the middle-class and radical sections of the intelligentsia. This article maps this vital literature-cinema nexus, drawing on interviews and pulling together material housed in various print and cinema archives.\n\nBefore the New Wave, popular Hindi cinema had mostly ignored Hindi literature altogether, turning instead to Urdu for the hybrid, poetic language in which it spoke of love, faith, and justice.6 The Indian New Wave brought the Sanskritic neologisms of literary Hindi into cinema theaters for the first time.7 Three distinct New Wave forms reflected a vibrant dialogue with the themes and preoccupations of postcolonial Hindi literature: a genre of lighthearted comedies about middle-class life (the middle cinema), adapted from the fiction of writers such as Kamleshwar and Mannu Bhandari; an avant-garde or experimental cinema that emerged out of collaborations with modernist Hindi writers such as Nirmal Verma, Mohan Rakesh, and Ramesh Bakshi; and the topical, issue-based cinema most closely associated with screenplays by the Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar.8 While the political and aesthetic differences between these films are significant, they share an orientation toward vernacular literary culture that extends beyond individual [End Page 26] instances of novels or short stories serving as sources for films. In what follows, I briefly explore each of these film genres, placing them in conversation with Hindi literary debates about realism, modernism, and socialism and with successive literary formations (the nayi kahani, or New Story, of the 1950s; sathottari, or post-1960s literature; and the samantar kahani, or Parallel Story, which became popular in the 1970s). Drawing on brief case studies, I analyze the literariness of the Indian New Wave as a “material phenomenon produced by a system of institutional interests and actors.”9 The article concludes with a reflection on the circumstances that pulled apart modern Indian literature and cinema in the 1990s.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF THE HINDI LITERARY FILM\n\nHow did the literature-cinema nexus of the Indian New Wave come apart? For a little over two decades, the New Wave had functioned as a unique contact zone between the cinema hall, printing press, and coffee house intellectuals. This contact zone disappeared in the 1990s. As India embraced economic liberalization, public-sector funding for arthouse cinema petered out, and the National Film Development Corporation reevaluated its priorities. For most of the twentieth century, the Indian middle class had been a class of clerks rather than compradors—defined by its relatively low levels of consumption, which it tended to valorize through discourses of austerity, responsibility, and piousness. In late colonial Bombay, for instance, it was not disposable income as much as their enthusiastic participation in the print public spheres that separated many middle-class households from the upper echelons of the working class.65 But by the mid-1980s, as the economic [End Page 46] paradigm shifted, the market for black-and-white televisions, color televisions, and video cassette players had begun to grow at a tremendous rate—by 1989, televisions were selling almost as much as radios for the first time in India.66 Video parlors and video libraries, both legal and illegal, sprung up all over the country, sometimes circulating bootlegged foreign films or pornography, creating an exciting, erogenous alternative to the relatively staid programming on state-run television or radio channels. The first few years of Indian television were a boom period for New Wave–style adaptations of Hindi literature, by directors such as Raman Kumar and Saeed Akhtar Mirza. But as television took the place of older middlebrow magazines, the cultural capital commanded by Hindi writers and editors began to depreciate in value. In time, with the coming of private entertainment channels and live news broadcasts, Hindi writers would become marginal to the television universe of kitschy horror shows, mythological epics, Indi-pop music videos, and gloriously melodramatic saas-bahu(mother-in-law versus daughter-in-law) dramas.67 One of the last notable films in the New Wave style, Saeed Akhtar Mirza’s Naseem (The morning breeze, 1995), stages a confrontation between the brash new world of television and the older syncretic legacy of Hindi-Urdu literary culture as embodied in the film by the communist poet Kaifi Azmi—a confrontation that the poet eventually loses.68\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Hindi public sphere has been characterized by a paradox: even as the number of Hindi speakers and readers continues to rise, literature has become increasingly marginal within this public sphere. As the privileged language of national politics and administration and through the newspaper revolution of the 1980s, Hindi grew faster than any other vernacular language. Similarly, the growth of television in the 1990s and early 2000s saw the creation of Hinglish and the increase in popularity of Hindi written in the Roman script.69 But this muscular expansion came at a cost. [End Page 47] The marginalization of the largely left-wing Hindi literary establishment within the peshawari duniya (professional world) of newspaper and magazine publishing has produced an impoverished public sphere, in which the only poetry that circulates widely takes the form of Bollywood lyrics, doggerel, and fragments of religious verse.70 In the 1950s and 1960s, the geographical horizons of Hindi were anything but provincial. The iterant, cosmopolitan protagonists of Hindi writer Nirmal Verma’s hauntingly beautiful stories from the 1950s and 1960s—who wander through European bookstores like djinns, who queue up for jobs outside factories in London with the dust of many countries under their collars, or stroll through the Charles Bridge in Prague discussing the latest Fellini movie—remain a striking reminder of postcolonial Hindi literature’s internationalist and world-making ambitions. These ambitions would remain frustrated. Increasingly since the 1990s, English has come to take the place of Hindi as a national link language within India, and as the preferred medium for conversations between different regional literatures, while also serving as a gatekeeper controlling access to world literature.71 Even as the Hindi public sphere has steadily expanded, the Hindi literary field has shrunk. As part of an aggressive rebranding strategy, India’s largest media conglomerate—Bennett, Coleman and Company Limited—would shutter a whole host of periodicals in the mid-1990s, including Dharmayug, Sarika, and Dinmaan, which reportedly brought in only a tiny fraction of the group’s revenue.72 No equivalent periodicals or websites have taken their place. Nor has any writer in the last forty years been bestowed with the kind of moral authority and political power that Hindi readers once bestowed on the likes of Ramdhari Singh “Dinkar” (1908–1974) and Phanishwar Nath “Renu” (1921–1977).\n\nRaman Kumar’s intuition that his would be “the last generation of truly literary filmmakers” working in Hindi may yet be proved wrong.73 But the [End Page 48] 1990s certainly marked the end of an era for the Hindi literary film. The middlebrow literary culture that had once been the source of so much hope and inspiration for the likes of Kumar is yet to recover, even as Indian writing in English has gone from strength to strength. While the aesthetic and thematic legacies of the New Wave can be still be seen in contemporary independent cinema from India, Hindi cinema’s strong institutional nexus with vernacular literary culture did not survive the 1990s.74 [End Page 49]"
