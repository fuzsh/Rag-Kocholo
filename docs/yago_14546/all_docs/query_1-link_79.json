In a properly conservative society, ‘one doesn’t say these things’ that express desire. And so, they get said, and shown, in song. The hero is Gandhian when he speaks, flirtatious when he sings. Casting a romantic Gandhi would, of course, need extraordinary measures – an excerpt from ‘A Gandhian Affair: India’s curious portrayal of love in cinema’ by Sanjay Suri\n\nMoon Songs, Part 1: Ten songs addressed to the moon is now followed up with Part 2: Adjectives for the Moon and Part 3: Comparisons to the moon by the singer\n\nThrough the Lens of Bollywood: Kashmir as an Image, Kashmir as a Place – Debashree Mukherjee – Dominant images of Kashmir in popular cinema present only one facet of the kaleidoscope of histories and memories, signs and signification, actions and emotions.

But did you know that the talented thespian once worked as an insurance agent?\n\nAnd now we pick up tributes and memories:\n\nGirish Karnad –\n\nThe untold story of Girish Karnad – Girish Karnad did not create a spectacle out of his death. He had scripted it that way. …This was not totally unexpected. It was in keeping with Karnad’s unsentimental public persona, and a certain rational, pragmatic pursuance of life, all through its eight decades.\n\nGirish Karnad, the Renaissance man of Indian culture, dies at 81 – Salil Tripathi – A playwright, actor, aesthete and classicist, Karnad delved into tradition to understand and explain modernity – The characters Karnad played were progressive, not radical; some of those characters were morally flawed and compromised. Life was not about absolutes; Karnad understood that as human condition. But his commitment to integrity was absolute.\n\nStoryteller With A Cause – Girish Karnad – While Girish Karnard’s capability as an actor is well acknowledged, he also emerged as a very impactful storyteller through his art of combining underlined message with an alluring storyline and simultaneously writing award winning books too. Kalpana Swamy recounts one such unusual work of his is 1992 multiple awards winning film Cheluvi, starring Sonali Kulkarni\n\nActress-singer Ruma Guha Thakurta passes away on 3rd June,2019 at age of 84. After making her silver screen debut with Hindi film Jwar Bhata in 1944, Ruma Guha Thakurta, a niece of filmmaker Satyajit Ray, went on to star in Bengali movies. Apart from acting, Ruma was a popular playback singer too.\n\n70 years of Shankar-Jaikishnan – Rajgopal Nidamboor – Melody was S-J’s complete existence…The power of their melodies evokes a distinctive feeling, replete with that perpetual velvety touch…There is that innate sense of transcendent particle running through their compositions.\n\nIlaiyaraaja: Music is more like a spiritual seeking that takes one to unknown levels – S Subhakeerthana – Ilaiyaraaja, who turns 76, gets talking about his early years as a music director and why his tunes have a unique space in the hearts of both commoners and connoisseurs.\n\nTen of my favourite Rajendra Krishan songs are presented to mark the birth centenary of the lyricist.\n\nRemembering a Forgotten Singer! – Lalita Deulkar – Her voice had the typical tone of vintage era and it was eloquent. Her Hindi pronunciation was also good, if we consider her pure Marathi background and that she had not taken much formal training in music. Her voice could express any emotion very easily and very effectively. If she had continued her singing career, we would have got more opportunities to listen to her songs of different genres.\n\nHemant Kumar’s duets with ‘other’ singers is a tribute to mark 99th birth anniversary of the music director -singer – While Lata Mangeshkar personified melody and sweetness with Hemant Kumar, the ‘other’ singers brought their own unique verve and joy, and combining with his deep melodious voice created a different kind of charming effect. Illustrative songs from this list:\n\nYe Mast Nazar Shokh Ada Kiske Liye Hai – Bandi (1957) – with Geeta Dutt – Hemant Kumar – Prem Dhawan\n\nYe Pyar Bhara Dil Hai Mohabbat Ka Khazana – Yahudi Ki Beti (1956) – with Asha Bhosle – Kamal Mitra – Kaifi Azmi\n\nShailendra Sharma @ Golden Era of Bollywood has posted following memorial tribute posts:\n\nRoop Tera Mastana – The Song that completes 50 Yea…\n\nHemant Kumar-The Romantic Voice of Dev Anand\n\nSuraiya- The Top Singing Actress after Independenc…\n\nBharat Bhushan – The Actor Who Gave Many Musical H…\n\nOnce Indian Cinema was ruled by the Jews\n\nNutan – The Heroine, not allowed to see her own fi…\n\nThe Magic of Nargis-Raj Kapoor,\n\nRaj Khosla- A director with a fantastic ear for mu…\n\nWhen Dilip Kumar Sang his own Song\n\nThe Story behind the song “Jalte Hain Jiske Liye” …\n\nMajrooh Sultanpuri and the Burmans\n\nThe Super Hits and the Forgotten Gems: 50 Years of Bappi Lahiri – One tends to overlook the many achievements of the composer Bappi Lahiri, overshadowed as they have been by his ‘Tathaiyya, tathaiyya’ brand of cacophony, his infamous penchant for gold jewellery and his heavily accented Bengali voice. Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri revisits the top 5 bona fide hits (of the many of Bappi Lahiri’s illustrious career) and 5 of the best songs that people have forgotten he had composed.\n\n“Mai Jaan Gayi Tujhe Saiyan”- Kammo, whose first name is Kamarjehan . She got her first chance as solo dancer in Sindabd The Sailor (1952) song Jis Roz Se Hamne Tera Deedar Kiya (Music: Chitragupta- Lyrics: Shyam Hindi). She went on to work for over 60 films in her two decades long career.\n\nRIP, Queen Harish (the World-Famous Rajasthani Folk Artist and “Dancing, Whirling Desert Drag Queen” Who Also Posted Comments on This Blog Close to Twelve Years Ago) – “He was an enhancer of life; investing his heart and soul into every move,” says writer and historian William Dalrymple, who loved watching Queen Harish perform.\n\nJune, 2019 episode of Fading Memories, Unforgettable Songs takes up. Dattaram – Haal-e-Dil Hamara Jaane Na.. Ye Bewafa Zamana. This in continuation to the previous article in 2018 wherein we had covered Dattaram’s songs from 1957 to 1959\n\nAnd, now commence the posts on other subjects.\n\nThe Navketan Ladies – If Dev Anand portrayed characters were mostly those on the fringes of urban society, intrinsically decent, but flawed, morally grey, human, the leading ladies of Navketan were fully fleshed-out characters; they might be the keepers of his characters’ conscience or the beacon of hope, but they got to live finely nuanced lives on screen. Nearly all the heroines in his films were strong, independent women.\n\nThe Classical Music Giants contribute to Hindi Cinema – Part I deals with the composers, who originally were related to classical music as a popular instrumentalists or classical vocalist and Part II looks at the contribution of classical vocalists to Hindi films, as a playback singer.\n\nTen of my favourite tree songs lists the songs with two primary conditions – the tree should be named in the first two lines, and, one song from one species of the tree only.

And shows a glimpse of what the “Middle Cinema” could have looked like, for bringing formal inventiveness to a story that could have been made into a sweet little tele-drama, because it’s an adaptation of an important Hindi novel – and for a look at the inner life of a young man who has no idea what he wants, for Mani Kaul as an actor – playing almost a dialogue-less role of the elder brother.\n\nReasons to watch the anti-war film Aman (apart from the Bertrand Russell cameo) – Because it’s one of the oddest films of its time, combining surface gloss with a serious, compassionate look at the horrors of nuclear war, For a (possible) glimpse of the teenage Naseeruddin Shah – one of the extras walking alongside a large funeral procession at the end, if only one could spot him!\n\nThe continuing story of Kamini Kaushal – Uday Bhatia – The 92-year-old actor appears in a small part in ‘Kabir Singh’\n\nBicycles and Bollywood Songs – Part 1 and Part 2 – Aditi Thakur relives the delights of bicycle rides in Hindi film songs, like, Kaise Bheege Bheege – Apna Ghar (1960) – Mohammad Rafi, Suman Kalyanpur – Ravi – Prem Dhawan\n\nFollowing the overview article, Best songs of 1946: And the winners are?. , we have also rolled out The Micro View of Best Songs of 1946, beginning with Male Solo songs.

Le Chal Nadiya Ke Par – Nadiya Ke Par (1948) – C Ramchandra –\n\nMasoom Chehra Ye Qatil Adayein Ke Bemot Mare Gaye Ham Bechare – Dil Tera Diwane (1962) – With Lata Mangeshkar -Shankar Jaikishan – Hasrat Jaipuri\n\nMere Junglee Kabutar – Ek Kali Muskayi (1968) Madan Mohan – Rajendra Krishna\n\nIss Vishal Dharati Par Chahe Rahein Kahin Ham Sathi – Love in Canada (1979) – with Hemant Kumar – Hemant Kumar – Yogesh\n\nCongress Ko Vote Do – NFS – Shankar Jaikishan – Kazi Saleem\n\nI earnestly solicit your inputs for further broad-basing our cache for the content for our carnival of blogs on the Golden Era of Hindi film music.\n\nDisclaimer: This monthly series of posts is my best-effort-based compilation of posts on Hindi film songs that I normally visit regularly.

The copyrights to the posts, images and video clips remain the properties of the original creators.\n\nCarnival of Blogs on Golden Era of Hindi Film Music – May 2019\n\nWelcome to May 2019 edition of Carnival of Blogs on Golden Era of Hindi Film Music.\n\nWe have two distinctive themes as the lead article – birth centenary of Manna Dey and 50 years of ‘parallel Cinema.\n\nManna Dey – Birth Centenary\n\nUnknown facets of singer extraordinaire Manna Dey – Debolina Sen – On the legendary singer’s birth centenary today, top musicians talk about the soul connect they shared with the man with a big heart and a golden voice.\n\nOn Manna Dey’s 100th Birth Anniversary, Here are 5 Iconic Tracks by the Singer – From Aye Bhai Zara Dekh Ke Chalo to Ek Chatur Naar, Manna Dey showed off his versatility as a singer in about 4000 songs in multiple languages.\n\nOn Manna Dey’s 100th Birth Anniversary, a Look Back at His Journey – ANIRUDHA BHATTACHARJEE and BALAJI VITTAL – Satyajit Ray, in an article discussing the limitations of Hindi film music, had mentioned that listeners would be “more shocked than surprised if they were made to hear a voice outside a coveted set of six singers”. Maybe six was just an empirical number he had in mind, but throughout his career, Manna certainly was not one of the six when the requirement was singing for the lead actor. He was always the seventh, in the role of a specialist.\n\nManna Dey Diary – On Manna Dey’s birth centenary, a diary about the legendary singer by Ranjan Das Gupta\n\nTen of my favourite Manna Dey duets presents a bouquet of Manna Dey’s duets with different singers.\n\nManna Dey – Balraj Sahni – Giants In Their Field – have weaved an eternal story which makes us the on-way street of Kaun Kahe Is Aur Tu Aye Na Aye.\n\nFifty years of Hindi Parallel Cinema\n\nFifty years of Hindi alternative cinema – Uday Bhatia, Jai Arjun Singh – In 1969, three films signaled the start of Hindi-language Parallel Cinema. To mark the half-century, the article has collated a selection of 50 films, one for each of the last 50 years, which are notably influential, obscure or under-appreciated., from the arthouse, experimental, indie, Parallel and Middle Cinema movements\n\nThe sounds of Parallel Cinema – Salil Tripathi – Music and sound design played a huge part in the alternative Hindi cinema of the 1970s – Directors turned to composers like Vijay Raghav Rao, Vanraj Bhatia and Rajat Dholakia for innovative soundscapes…Songs allowed for playful innovations. In filming the delightful song Paanch Lakh Ki Gadi, Saeed Mirza used an extended long shot in Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980), as Naseeruddin Shah and other motor mechanics tinkered with an expensive jalopy. The song is filmed in a single shot, as if paying homage to Hitchcock, whose Rope (1948) was filmed to seem as if it was a single shot.\n\nThe varied aesthetics of the Indian New Wave – Omar Ahmed– Parallel Cinema directors didn’t adhere to any one particular style….Instead, they used everything from neorealism to agitprop to avant-garde to tell their stories\n\nThe sari’s alternative screen test\n\nContinuing with the homage to Shamshad Begum, Shamshad sings with Mangeshkar sisters remembers duets and triads, e.g. Khushiyan Na Manaae Kyon Hum.. Kismat Hamare Saath Hai….– Khidaki (1948) – with Lata Mangeshkar and Mohantara Talpade – C Ramchandra – PL Santoshi\n\nTen of my favourite Kaifi Azmi songs is a chosen list of some of Kaifi Azmi’s timeless songs.\n\nThe Unrivaled Poet Kaifi Azmi- Part I lists his songs composed by Khayyam, Hemant Kumar and Madan Mohan and Part II lists his songs with all other composers. I have taken one illustrative song from each one –\n\nSara Mora Kajra Chhudaya- Do Dil (1965) – Mohammad Rafi & Aarti Mukherji / Music – Hemant Kumar\n\nBaithe Hai Rehguzar Par – 40 Days (1959) – Asha Bhosle / Music – Babul\n\nNazir Hoosein ensured that at Mumbai’s Liberty Cinema, the show never stopped – A tribute to the doughty owner of Liberty Cinema, Mumbai’s Art Deco gem.\n\nRomancing the Reel: Vijay Bhatt – Legendary director-producer Vijay Bhatt, the founder of Prakash Pictures, a film production company and Prakash Studios in Mumbai, had launched some of the most illustrious names in Hindi film industry. SMM Ausaja pays tribute to this illustrious filmmaker with a journey through his life and works on his birth anniversary, embellished with a collection of rare pictures courtesy Osianama.\n\nShailendra Sharma @ Golden Era of Bollywood has posted following memorial tribute posts:\n\nDev Anand – The Karma Yogi of Indian Cinema\n\nTalat Mahmood – A Great Fan of K L Saigal\n\nThe Golden Combination of Naushad and Rafi\n\nThe First Indian Fim was Released on 3rd May 1913\n\nManna Dey-The Great Versatile Singer of Bollywood\n\nThe Immortal Songs of C Arjun\n\nInteresting Hindi Film Songs With Question and Ans…\n\nFeroz Khan- A Successful Journey from Third Grade …\n\nDev Anand’s Association with Shankar Jaikishan\n\nRemembering Kedar Sharma is a tribute to Kedar Sharma, on his 20th Death Anniversary.\n\n“Shamma Pe Aake O Parwane Jal Jal” – Heera Sawant – Heera Sawant was not only an excellent dancer but also an adept actress. She made her debut in Hindi films in 1940s, made her emphatic presence felt in around 120 films over two decades, produced a few films and with the changing times bid adieu to the arc lights of the film world.\n\nMay, 2019 episode of Fading Memories, Unforgettable Songs takes up. Manna Dey – Chale Jaa Rahein Hai…. : 1947 – 1950. This in continuation to the previous article in 2018 wherein we had covered Manna Dey’s songs for the year 1943 to 1946.\n\nAnd, now commence the posts on other subjects.\n\nChorus Songs in the Hindi Films of Yore – In the first part of her three-part dissertation on chorus songs in the films of yore, the guest author, Shalan Lal covered the first decade of the 1930s. The second part, dealing with the second decade of the 1940s, and chorus songs from this era, gives a good insight into the main trends during this period and style of music.\n\nRomancing The Letters – Khat, Chitthi and Sandesh Songs is a collection of Hindi songs which narrate a story through the wonderful, romantic mode of communication.\n\nDoris Day sang ‘Que Sera Sera’ – and so did Telugu star Bhanumathi – Sriram V – How Indian filmmakers reused the famous tune from Alfred Hitchcock’s suspense thriller ‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’ (1956).\n\nDoris Day sings Que Sera Sera in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).\n\nChinna Pennana Pothile, Aaravalli (1957)\n\nQue Sera Sera in the Telugu film Thodu Needa (1965).\n\nOn ‘Main Shayar toh Nahin: The Book of Hindi Film Lyricists’ by Ravishankar presents Hindi-film lyrics and lyricists from the 1930s to the present day. Main Shayar Toh Nahin isn’t a book you will read for the quality of the writing, or for a cleanly structured approach: it makes random leaps, there are patches of repetition. But by the time you reach the last page, you feel better-educated about a subject that had been something of a mystery to most of\n\nFollowing the overview article, Best songs of 1946: And the winners are?. , we have also rolled out The Micro View of Best Songs of 1946, beginning with Male Solo songs. We have covered Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, Manna Dey, G M Durrani and Ashok Kumar till now.\n\nNow we post with a few songs of Mohammad Rafi, each one of which basically has a link with the topics discussed in the present post.\n\nTera Husn Rahe Mera Ishq Rahe – Do Dil (1965) – Hemant Kumar – Kaifi Azmi\n\nArre Hasanewale, Kabhi Ye Bhi Socho – Parwana (1971) – Madan Mohan – Kaifi Azmi\n\nChalate Hi Jaana Chalate Hi Jaana Jahan Tak Aaj Ye Raah Chale – Usne Kaha Tha (1961) – With Manna Dey – Salil Chaudhary – Shailendra\n\nI earnestly solicit your inputs for further broad-basing our cache for the content for our carnival of blogs on the Golden Era of Hindi film music.\n\nDisclaimer: This monthly series of posts is my best-effort-based compilation of posts on Hindi film songs that I normally visit regularly.

The copyrights to the posts, images and video clips remain the properties of the original creators.\n\nCarnival of Blogs on Golden Era of Hindi Film Music – April 2019\n\nWelcome to April 2019 edition of Carnival of Blogs on Golden Era of Hindi Film Music.\n\n2019 marks the birth centenary of some of classic Hindi cinema’s greatest in the field of music. Music director Naushad was born a hundred years ago; lyricists Kaifi Azmi and Rajendra Krishan were born a hundred years ago; and two of Hindi cinema’s most popular playback singers—Manna Dey and Shamshad Begum—were also born in 1919, less than a month apart.\n\nThe unforgettable voice of Shamshad Begum: Birth centenary special – 14 April 2019 marks the birth centenary of one of India’s most durable and outstanding singing voices — Shamshad Begum.\n\nTen of my favourite Shamshad Begum solos is tribute to her to commemorate her birth centenary, of which I have picked three of the post-1950 songs-\n\nO babuji main na karoon teri naukri (Shrimatiji, 1952) – Jimmy – Raja Mahendi Ali Khan\n\nBachke balam kahaan jaaoge (Naya Andaaz, 1956) – O P Nayyat – Jan Nissar Akhtar\n\nSaiyyaan teri akhiyon mein dil kho gaya (12 O’Clock, 1958) – O P Nayyar – Sahir Ludhyanavi\n\nK L Saigal – The Modern Tansen – Saigal was so perfect in his singing that musicians, composers and singers around him called him Shiva’s Bhrm Naad. During a recording or a song recital it is usually the musicians who set their instruments first to give the scale and the singer would match that scale. But in case of Saigal, it was the other way round. Tanpura and other instruments were set after Saigal sang a scale.\n\nDirector Ravindra Dave, who was ‘Ravinbhai’ in Hindi films and ‘Bapa’ for Gujarati cinema – A tribute to the multi-faceted filmmaker on his birth centenary – Hiren B Dave – Ravindra Dave’s Hindi films between the early 1950s and the late ’60s include Nagina (1951), Agra Road (1957), Post Box 999 (1958), Satta Bazaar (1959), Dulha Dulhan (1964) and Raaz (1967). His films had numerous hits songs and were largely popular with audiences. His contributions extend to Gujarati cinema, which he revived with the blockbuster Jesal Toral in 1971. Dave also had an interest in carpentry – he would make chairs for domestic use – and was an amateur painter and sculptor too.\n\n‘Like Holi with the blood of Hindus and Muslims’ – Sumangala Damodaran – This song – Din Khoon Ke Hamare – about Jallianwala Bagh still resonates\n\nAlso read:\n\n‘An Incident from 1919’: Saadat Hasan Manto’s haunting short story on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre\n\nOne hundred years of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre: What Tagore wrote in 1919 resounds today\n\nSome Nice Film and Dance References to the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah (plus some other things) – Raj Kapoor has personified Nawab of Awadh for the song Kate Na Kate Raina for Mera Naam Joker\n\nJeetendra – The Jack Of All Trades – From becoming Sandhya’s body double in Navrang (1959) at the age of 17 to doing a lead role in Mother (1999) at the age of 57, Jeetendra has come a long way. In between he travelled a distance of almost 200 films.\n\nShailendra Sharma @ Golden Era of Bollywood has posted following memorial tribute posts:\n\nAmeeta – A Forgotten Actress\n\nThe Story Behind the Song “Dum Maro Dum”\n\nStory Behind the Song “Yeh Aankhen Uff You Maa”\n\nJeetendra – The First Dancing Star of Bollywood\n\nStory Behind the song Hotho Mein Aisi Baat\n\nThe Iconic Cinema Halls of India\n\nANAND BAKSHI – Kuch To Log Kahenge\n\nJagdeep – When Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru Appreciated hi…\n\nS N TripathI – A Forgotten Music Director\n\nActor Singer Songs of Bollywood\n\nFlashback series for the current moth informs why these films need to be watched again. We shall record these reasons in brief here:\n\nlanguage, education and a great romantic pairing in Gunga Jumna represents Dilip Kumar’s crowning achievement as a multi-tasker and how it influenced Hindi films (and stars) to come\n\nwhy you should watch Guru Dutt’s Mr and Mrs 55 because it’s Guru Dutt Lite (but points the way forward to his more personal work), for the sharp writing, the general air of zaniness… and RK Laxman, for Madhubala and for the subtle movement between a happy-go-lucky tone and a more cautionary one.\n\nThe legend of Baiju Bawra: Was there ever a musician who could melt marble with his singular voice? – Malini Nair – There’s more to the mystery than what was immortalised on screen – the early history of Hindustani music, largely an oral tradition, is a mishmash of legends, anecdotes and miracles.\n\nApril, 2019 episode of Fading Memories, Unforgettable Songs takes up. Hasrat Jaipuri – Beyond Shanker Jaikishan: 1956 -1957. This in continuation to the previous articles in 2017 and 2018 respectively wherein we had covered Hasrat Jaipuri’s songs for music directors beyond Shanker Jaikishan for 1950 to 1953 and from 1953 to 1955 respectively.\n\nAnd, now commence the posts on other subjects with a SoY celebration of The Unified Theory of Fools on 1st April.\n\nStage Performances at College or School Festivals – The songs are either of chhed chhad type or rarely announce the love, the performer has, for his or her love interest. In all, majority of such songs are of celebration, songs with happy mood, etc. Rarely we do come across a melancholic song Here is one illustrative song_\n\nB A, M A, Ph D – Adhikar (1954) – Asha Bhosle & Chorus – Avinash Vyas – Prem Dhawan\n\nBefore size matters- When Hindi film songs were extra-long and all the better for it – Devarsi Ghosh – The one with a lengthy prelude and numerous antaras that exercised the imagination of music composers, lyricists and filmmakers? … That time when Bollywood tunes stretched on for seven minutes and more, and no one complained… the eight-and-a-half minute Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho from Chetan Anand’s Hanste Zakhm (1973) incorporates the sounds of rain, thunder and waves. Similarly, in Piya ToSe Naina Laage Re (Guide, 1965) Rosie (Waheeda Rehman) also signals her changing equation with the world. After four antaras and multiple costume changes, Rosie is a star hounded by fans.\n\nव्याकरण, उच्चारण और उत्पीड़न (Grammar, Pronunciation and Persecution) – is an excellent treatise on the subject of deliberate or natural abuse of either grammar or pronunciation in the Hindi film songs. The songs presented in the post range from subtle to hitting-on-the face impact of such errors. Here is one illustration to enhance the point under discussion – Suno bairi balam sach bol re ‘ib’ kya hoga by Rajkumari from Bawre Nain (1950), lyrics Kedar Sharma, music Roshan – We don’t know whether Kedar Sharma meant to use ‘ib’ for ‘ab’ consciously, but it does enhance Geeta Bali’s impishness. HFGK writes it as ‘अब’ kya hoga. ‘Ib’ might have gone unnoticed.\n\nIn the Song Sketch series we have :\n\nGhar Aaja Ghir Aaye – Chhote Nawab – Clouded Craving – Lata Mangeshkar –Shailednra – R D Burman\n\nHothon Pe Beeti Baat Aayi Hai – Angoor – Moonlit Fib – Asha Bhosle – Gulzar – R D Burman\n\nYe Dil Deewana Hai Dil Toh Deewana Hai – Ishq Par Zor Nahi – Doting Ditty – Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammad Rafi – Anand Baxi – S D Burman\n\nHothon Se Chhoo Lo Tum – Prem Geet – Psalm Of Love – Jagjit Singh – Indeevar – Jagjit Singh\n\nLasting Music Pieces in Films – Some of the finest music in films becomes emblazoned in the audience’s mind as any of the images. HQ Chowdhury, author of the recently republished Incomparable Sachin Dev Burman looks at a few of these lasting music pieces in cinema in the western world that have stood the test of time and are now part of film folklore. E.g.\n\nTheme music is that of Dr. No.\n\nthe Lawrence Music – Theme music of Lawrence of Arabia\n\nSoY has set the ball rolling for continuing the annual series of Best songs of year with an over view post Best songs of 1946: And the winners are?.\n\n[I plan to commence our corresponding The Micro View of Best Songs this blog from the next month.]\n\nBefore we formally take up the end of the episode, we have a two-part post Mohd. Rafi & Manna Dey Songs- Part 1 and Part 2 dealing in details with the songs that Mohammad Rafi and Manna Dey have rendered together. I have picked two illustrative songs:\n\nDildaar Milenge Kahin Na Kahin – Vatan Se Door (1968); – Lala Sattar – Farooq Qaiser .\n\nMehfil Mein Shama Chamki – Gunahon Ka Devta (1967) – Shankar Jaikishan – Hasrat Jaipuri.\n\nNow we post with a few songs of Mohammad Rafi, each one of which basically has a link with the topics discussed in the present post.\n\nMere Sapno Ki Raani.. Tu Hi Tu Hi Mere Sapno Ki Raani – Shajehan (1946) – K L Saigal is the lead singer and Rafi joins in a chorus – Naushad – Majrooh Sultanpuri\n\nDuniya Ki Nazar Hai Buri Zulfein Na Sawara Karo – Agre Road (1957) – With Geeta Dutt – Roshnan – Prem Dhawan\n\nMain Jaan Gayi Tujhe Saiyan – With Shamshad Begum – Howrah Bridge (1958) – O P Nayyar – Hasrat Jaipuri\n\nJhin Chak Jhin Chak | Mohammed Rafi, Shamshad Begum – Lal Quilla (1961) – S N Tripathi – Bharat Vyas\n\nI earnestly solicit your inputs for further broad-basing our cache for the content for our carnival of blogs on the Golden Era of Hindi film music.\n\nDisclaimer: This monthly series of posts is my best-effort-based compilation of posts on Hindi film songs that I normally visit regularly.

The copyrights to the posts, images and video clips remain the properties of the original creators.\n\nCarnival of Blogs on Golden Era of Hindi Film Music, March 2019\n\nWelcome to March 2019 edition of Carnival of Blogs on Golden Era of Hindi Film Music.\n\nA tribute to Shashi Kapoor on his 81st birth anniversary: The many faces of the legendary Shakespeare Wallah\n\nRekha speaks through her eyes, which made her my choice for Umrao Jaan: Muzaffar Ali -For every art enthusiast, Muzaffar Ali’s home is a treat to the eyes. Speaking with him about his films while laying focus on his best-known work, Umrao Jaan (1981), we got to know a bit more about him and his process of bringing poetry and art to the 70mm screen and more.\n\nRarely Heard Ghulam Mohammad – on 51st death anniversary – the lyrics formed an important part, then the actual tune.\n\nRemembering Ravi through the songs that he wrote, Lata sings for Ravi and The silent giant-killer and the man of many-splendoured talents: Ravi are rich tributes to a music director who did not get credit befitting his success.\n\nChalo Ek Baar Phir Se Ajnabi – Gumraah – Strangers Once Again – the situation in life becomes such that you start feeling it is better to be strangers than being lovers. Music composer Ravi takes all the care to handle the delicate situation with utmost care. He uses only the piano (violin and percussion is just an accompaniment) and Mahendra Kapoor’s voice to convey Sahir’s thoughts.\n\nThe real mesmeriser Talat Mahmood: His best non-film songs capture some of the most remembered non-film songs of Talat Mahmood.\n\nThe Story Of A Sindbad – Shankarrao Biniwale, is narrated to us by Kaushal Inamdar in Marathi here. The post is English translation of that article. Shankarrao Biniwale was an accomplished violinist, who went around the world and explored the origins of violin.\n\nShailendra Sharma @ Golden Era of Bollywood has posted following memorial tribute posts:\n\nJohny Mera Naam, the film that influenced future H…\n\nThe Great Thumris of Bollywood\n\nHistory behind the historical -MUGHAL_E_AZAM\n\nForgotten Songs of HOLI\n\nShashi Kapoor – The Man who made many Meaningful F…\n\nGhulam Mohammed’ – The man who gave the Immortal M…\n\nThe Undying Appeal of the Songs of Golden Era\n\nHow the film Hare Rama Hare Krishna was Concieved …\n\nQamar Jalalabadi – Who wrote “Mera Naam Chin Chin …\n\nSahir Ludhianvi- A Journey as lyricist through the…\n\nFunny Bollywood Songs wtth the Names of Films and …\n\nDev Anand lent his voice to one song, from the fil…\n\nRavi – His music became a part of our life\n\nKalyanji Anandji- From the Folk Music to Funky Mus…\n\nManmohan Desai – The Film Maker that Ruled the Box…\n\nFarooq Sheikh – A Man For All Seasons, who worked with directors like M S Sathyu, Satyajit Ray, Muzaffar Ali, Sai Paranjape, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Yash Chopra, Ketan Mehta, Ayan Mukherjee.\n\nOn Kundan Shah, Paigham, and Vyjayanthimala as the comic foil recollects a lighthearted scene in the 1959 Dilip Kumar-Vyjayanthimala-starrer Paigham\n\nFlashback series: human pain and human comedy in Boot Polish (1954) recommends seeing the film because two child actors get top billing in a 1950s Hindi film… and earn it\n\nMarch, 2019 episode of Fading Memories, Unforgettable Songs takes up S N Tripathi: Unremembered music director of remembered songs :1957 – 1960. This is the 3rd article in the series on S N Tripathi. First two covered his songs from 1941 to 1950 and from 1951 to 1956 respectively in 2017 and in 2018.\n\nAnd, now the posts on other subjects:\n\nBarahmasa in film songs = Literally meaning ‘twelve months’, in music it refers to folk or light classical form of north and east India, sung primarily in the rainy season. E.g.\n\nBarkha ki raat aye manwa by Pankaj Mullick from Adhikar (1938), music Timir Baran\n\nO varsha ke pahle baadal mera sandesa le jana by Jagmohan Sursagar from Meghdoot (1945), lyrics Faiyyaz Hashmi, music Kamal Dasgupta\n\nHis girl Friday: Sanjeev Kumar and the ‘computer’ in Trishul, an economical, unobtrusive little moment in a larger-than-life film. The scene is where we are introduced to the middle-aged version of the businessman RK Gupta, played by Sanjeev Kumar, and his superbly resourceful secretary Geeta (Raakhee). The office scene in Trishul isn’t subdued or quirky, but it performs a comparable function – telling us something important about a character, a situation and an environment with a few minute brush-strokes.\n\nSongs At The Opening Credits Of The Movie – Title songs carried a gist of that particular film and the songs at the opening credits sort of served as the preamble of that particular film. Though at times both combined as one and solved both purposes. Opening credit songs might not essentially have the title of film in it. Sometimes the film might also have both, opening credits having the title as well as independent title song. We have picked up a few examples form the article:\n\nDhund,\n\nUmrao Jan\n\nRang Birangi – serves the purpose of title songs and an opening credit song.\n\nSomewhat Cross-dressed Women ‘Romancing’ Women in Performances: Ten Songs from which I have picked out a few, which are relatively less-known-\n\nChaakuwaala chhuriwaala (Al Hilal, 1958):\n\nDupatta mera mal-mal ka (Adalat, 1958)\n\nAs-salaam alekum babu (Kalpana, 1960)\n\nJawaani jala bedardi (24 Ghante, 1958\n\nChhodo chhodo ji baiyaan mori (Baradari, 1955)\n\nFew Marathi songs by prominent Hindi singers has listed Marathi songs sung by Geeta Dut, Sudha Malhotra, Mukesh, Manna Dey, Hemant Kumar and Moahammad Rafi, obviously excluding Lata Mageshkar, Asha Bhosle and Suamn Kalyanpuar. The post ends with a note on Lata Mangeshkar’s connection with Marathi cinema – a music director. Sixty-nine years back Lata Mangeshkar debuted as a Music Director in the Marathi movie Ram Ram Pavhana (1950). It is to be noted that in her first movie as a composer she used her own name. And it’s not clear why in the later four Marathi movies she gave music under the pseudonym- Anandghan. Anonymity I guess. Her music was one of the 8 state awrds that Sadhi Manas got.\n\nHow SD Burman became as famous as the singers he worked with despite his thin, nasally voice – In edited excerpts from a reissued biography – Incomparable Sachin Dev Burman – on SD Burman (known as Dada), H Q Chowdhury reopens the debate: was he a singer-composer or a composer-singer?\n\nWho wrote the classic Hindi film ‘Aandhi’? And was it based on Indira Gandhi? Gulzar clears the air – In edited excerpts from an interview, by Saba Mahmood Bashir, in ‘Aandhi Insights into the Film’, Gulzar reveals how his Suchitra Sen-Sanjeev Kumar starrer got made.\n\nKhilte Hain Gul Yahan – Sharmilee – Of Roses And Romance – One version rendered by Kishore Kumar and the other by Lata Mangeshkar. One is happy, the other is sad. The opening lines of both songs depict the sense of the opposites in the songs.\n\nSongs with a Surprise! Share the opening lines by chance. The post has put up quite demaninding filters for the selection of these songs\n\nThe words should be from the opening lines of the songs\n\nThe songs should share at least four words.\n\nThe songs should not have been inspired from a well known ghazal or a bhajan,\n\nThe songs should be from two different films\n\nTeri Dhoom Har Kahin – Kala Bazaar – Money Matters is a praise money situation –\n\nSooraj ke jaisi golaai\n\nChanda ki thandak bhi paayi\n\nThanke toh pyare duhai\n\nLai lai lai lai\n\nTeri dhoom har kahin\n\nTujh sa yaar koi nahin\n\nHum ko toh pyare tu sab se pyara\n\nIn our tradition of ending our post with article on Mohammad Rafi or a topical song of his, I have picked up a few songs, each one of which basically has a link with the topics discussed in the present post.\n\nDuniya Ki Haalat Naram Naram, Halwa Chhodo, Poodi Chhodo, Bajhiya Yeh Kha Lo Garam Garam– Guzara-1(954) – Ghulam Muhammad – Raja Mehdi Ali Khan\n\nGhoda Peshauri Mera Tanaga Lahori Mera – Pyar Ka Bandhan (1963) – Ravi – Sahir Ludhyanavi\n\nBeta Jamure Kah De Duniya Ko Lalakar Ke – Biradari (1966) – With Manna Dey – Chitragupta – Prem Dhawan\n\nKya Hua Maine Agar Ishq Ka Izahar Kiya – Yeh Dil Kis Ko Doon (1963) – with Asha Bhosle – Iqbal Quereshi – Qamar Jalalabadi\n\nI am also not able resist temptation to recall one of my most favorite song – Ghulam mOhammad creation.\n\nHai Bas Ke Har Ek Unke Ek Ishare Pe Nishan Aur – Mirza Ghalib (1954)\n\nI earnestly solicit your inputs for further broad-basing our cache for the content for our carnival of blogs on the Golden Era of Hindi film music.\n\nDisclaimer: This monthly series of posts is my best-effort-based compilation of posts on Hindi film songs that I normally visit regularly.

It’s a list of romantic serenades, of people singing in praise of the person they’re in love with (or, as in the case of a couple of fraudulent characters in this list, pretending to be in love with).\n\nFor the Love of a Goddess – The article first takes through the narrative journey of a music documentary, Music for Goddess (by Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy and Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy), which explores the sacred music, dance and rituals of devidasis and devidasas, women and men dedicated to the goddess Renuka/Yellamma. It then introduces the instrument, the chaundka—also called chaundke, which the followers of the Goddes use mainly in their dancing and singing. The chaundka sounds similar to the damru. Our cinema has used the chaundka in several songs. The article has listed some of these songs.\n\nSuman Kalyanpur – Sweetness Personified – The name conjures memories of lilting sweet songs, solos and duets that have gained immortality and enriched our music heritage. Peeyush Sharma revisits some of her evergreen melodies, enjoyed and cherished by generations of music lovers. Of the two duets she could get to sing with Mohammad Rafi, Din ho ya raat hum rahein tere saath (Miss Bombay, 1957, Hans Raj Behl / Prem Dhawan) is perhaps more known than Duniya Ye Kehati Hai.. Meri Kismat Mein Likhi Wo Jo Mere Peechhe Baithi Hai\n\nIn a tribute to Bharat Vyas in his centenary birth year, last month we had touched Bharat Vyas – The Prolific Lyricist – I and Bharat Vyas – The Prolific Lyricist – II .

[I have searched a song in which each one is associated in a duet with Mohammad Rafi. The songs are at the end of the present article.]\n\nShailendra Sharma @ Golden Era of Bollywood has posted following memorial tribute posts:\n\nNavketan’s Guide- From Pages to Celluloid\n\nI S Johar – A Versatile Bollywood Personality\n\nThe First Generation Composers of Bollywood\n\nMadhubala- A Journey from Baby Mumtaz to Madhubala…\n\nThe Great Dacoit Films of Bollywood\n\nPakeezah was the Taj Mahal for Kamal Amrohi\n\nSongs were the Integral Part of Dev Anand Personal…\n\nJagjit Singh and Chitra Singh’s chemistry worked l…\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Iconic Studios and Banners of…\n\nBhagwan Dada- The Original Dancing Star of Bollywo…\n\nWaheeda Rehman- A Journey from Kamini(C I D) to Nu…\n\nS D Burman was the Soul of Navketan Films\n\nThe flashback series has why you should watch Waqt (1965), because it’s a near-perfect summary of the “masala” film before the term was commonly used and why you should watch Mem Didi (1961) for the beautiful chemistry between three elderly character actors.\n\nWaheeda Rehman 2.0 – The Grand Diva Of Hindi Cinema – Staying relevant is one of the most crucial elements of Hindi film industry and Waheeda Rehman is a living legend who has stayed relevant in every era since her debut in 1955 in Telugu and Tamil cinema.\n\nZameen Kha Gayi Aasman Kaise Kaise – Some Non-picturised Songs Of R D Burman – Part 1 and Part 2 – the songs that either recorded but not filmed at all or filmed, but subsequently removed.\n\nFebruary, 2019 episode of Fading Memories, Unforgettable Songs takes up Talat Mahmood’s duets with Mubarak Begum and Madhubala Jhaveri, in continuation to the previous articles . Some of the Talat Mahmood Duets receding from the memory and Talat Mahmood’s Duet Combinations with Rare Co-singers.\n\nAnd, now the posts on other subjects:\n\nRomancing the Pardesi is a varied collection of beautiful Pardesi songs of separation, longing, betrayal and hope.\n\nWhat Time It Is? is a theme-based list that has songs mentioning the actual time in the opening line.\n\nWith Claps As Percussion – Songs With A Difference, which has several over-riding conditions, one of which it is that it should not be an O P Nayyar composition. Here is one song that comes up as result:\n\nNacho Jhoom Jhoom Ke – Sarhad (1960) – Chitalkar – C Ramchandra – Majrooh Sultanpuri\n\nBy the Sea Shore remembers the songs from the films of 50s-60s and 70s, picturized on a seashore or a beach.\n\nReluctant Singer? Take a Boat Ride – Transformation happens to many people when they are on a boat that has left the shores some time ago. The songs listed herein are the ones that were sung by such “What, me sing?” folks when on the land. This is a celebration of people who themselves manage to move a sea vessel from one place to another.\n\nTujhe chaand ke ‘bahaane’ dekhun ki ‘chhat’ par aa ja goriye is a rich collection of songs in which an excuse to go to the terrace is linked up.\n\n‘The Guide’ in English: The story of Dev Anand’s abortive attempt to storm Hollywood – Based on RK Narayan’s novel of the same name, the film was directed by Tad Danielewski. But reviewers thought it was ‘clumsy and artless’.\n\nMose Chhal Kiye Jaaye – Kya Se Kya Ho Gaya – Guide – The Twofold Stunner -The Writer / Director, Vijay Anand, wants his songs to take his story forward. He opts for two different songs…back to back and Burman da composes those two songs. Both songs have the same notes!!!! Whereas Lata Mangeshkar song is an accusation of the feeling of cheating, Mohammad Rafi’s song is a romantic plea for the sake of his love.\n\nSongs of दास्तान- ए – हाल – ए -दिल weave anguish or agitation, and some time happiness, or sheer romance, when a person comes up to tell his / her heart-felt feelings.\n\nWe are bit late in documenting ‘Songs in the Snow: Ten of my favourites’. The songs should feature some amount of snow; it need not necessarily be all against a backdrop of snow. And the snow, even if it’s not real should at least not look patently fake.\n\nIn our tradition of ending our post with article on Mohammad Rafi or a topical song of his, I have picked up a few songs, each one of which basically has a link with the topics discussed in the present post.\n\nAkhiyan Mail Ke Jara Baat Karo Ji – Pardes (1950) – with Lata Mangeshkar – Ghulam Mohammad – ShakeelBadayuni\n\nAao Chale Manwa More Door Chale Kahin Re – Amar Prem (1948) – with Rajkumari – Dutt Thakur – Mohan Mishra\n\nTumhein Chupke Se Dil Mein Liya – Ek Do teen (1953) – with Asha Bhosle – Vinod – Aziz Kashmiri\n\nChowpati Par Kal Jo Tujhse – Afsana (1951) – with Shmashad Begum – Husnlal Bhagatram – Chander Oberoi\n\nKehdo Kehdo Jahan Se Kehdo Ishq Par Jor Nahin – April Fool (1964) – with Suman Kalyanpur – Shanker Jaikishan – Hasrat Jaipuri\n\nAuraton Ke Dibbe Mein Mard Aa Gaya – Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh (1962) – With Suman Kalyanpur – Hansraj Behl – Prem Dhawan\n\nTere Peechhe Phirte Phirte Ho Gaya Pura Sal – Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh (1962) – With Suman Kalyanpur – Hansraj Behl – Prem Dhawan\n\nI earnestly solicit your inputs for further broad-basing our cache for the content for our carnival of blogs on the Golden Era of Hindi film music.\n\nDisclaimer: This monthly series of posts is my best-effort-based compilation of posts on Hindi film songs that I normally visit regularly.

The present sequel takes up the tale of the choral tail, the tail that follows as smoothly after the mukhada as the aqua-dynamic as the shape of the tail of the mermaid, an apt example is the improvised sad version of Saagar Kianre\n\n‘Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche’ – Imtiaz Khan, elder son of actor Jayant, played played important roles in many hit films like ‘Yaadon Ki Baaraat’, ‘Dharmatma’, ‘Zakhmi’, ‘Zorro’, ‘Kala Sona’, ‘Kabeela’ and ‘Darwaza’., but his first love was film direction.\n\nJanuary, 2019 episode of Fading Memories, Unforgettable Songs is second article in the series of annual article series on Jaidev: Brilliant, But Underrated Composer. The present article covers less remembered songs of unknown films from 1964 to 1970. For the records, we had covered his take-off years of 1955 to 1963 last year.\n\nWe also have another article, JAIDEV- A composer with the highest number of unreleased films, in which he had composed some gems\n\nAnd, now the posts on other subjects:\n\nWelcomed with Arrows – Arrows and bows are called teer and kamaan respectively in Hindustani language. They are also called baan and dhanush. Our poets have used teer and baan as metaphors in poetry, both to ignite love—in the Cupid way—as well as to injure it. The post checks out these songs from our films, which make an early reference to such ammunition:\n\nGreatness in the shadow of the giants: Pandit Shyam Sundar – Shyam Sundar was not only central to the career of the three greatest singers, Noorjehan, Lata Mangeshkar and Rafi, he takes the sole credit for Sulochana Kadam’s fame. Shyam Sundar’s career was short, spanning about 14 years (1939-1953) in which he gave music for only 4 Punjabi and 20 Hindi films. He died prematurely in 1953.\n\nThe Irony of an Iron Building – One wonders how the word hotel became a substitute for an eatery in Hindustani parlance, with names like one finds names like Ram Bharose Hindu Hotel or Allah Bux Hotel being ubiquitously seen across towns in India. The post recalls the song engaging with this idea,\n\nAao Hamar Hotel Mein Chai Piyo Ji GaraM Garam, Biscuit Khalo Naram Naram – Kundan (1955) – S D Batish, Sudha Malhotra – Ghulam Mohammad – Shakeel Badayuni\n\nShehnai (1947) and a Sad Video About the River in the “Chhuk Chhuk Chhaiya Chhaiya” Scene – The clean, fragrant, and sweet waters that the song talked about have long since lost their spirit. Today, the Kandivli ‘nullah’ bears an ominous look.\n\nMore Than Meets the Eye – What is it about sunglasses that is so cool? Why is it that they are seen more as style accessories than as protection for the eyes? When did they transform from a thing of function to one of fashion? In any case, Hindi films have a known tradition of actors who were seen wearing sunglasses in a song. The post lists such songs.\n\nWe will take a quick look at these guest posts, before we move over to the curtain call for the present episode:\n\nKanha main tose haari, by Deepa Buty\n\nMatwala Jiya, by Gaurav Sahay\n\nDukh bhare din beete re bhaiya, by Pisharoty Chandran\n\nIn our tradition of ending our post with article on Mohammad Rafi or a topical song of his, I have picked up a few songs, each one of which basically has a link with the topics discussed in the present post.\n\nChand Ki Sundar Nagri Mein Pariyon Ki Raani Raheti Thi – Dholak (1951) – with Uma Devi and Chorus – Shyam Sundar – Aziz Kashmirir\n\nKoi Ek Ana Koi Do Ana Koi Ten Ana Koi Char Ana – Dhun (1953) – with Satish Batra, Madan Mohan, Babul – Madn Mohan – Bharat Vyas\n\nIshq Mein Mere Kya Kaya Junoon Ki – Khunus (Unreleased) – Jaidev – Bahadur Shah Zafar\n\nWo Teer Dil Pe Chala Jo Teri Kaman Main Hai.… – Aarti (1962) – with Asha Bhosle – Roshan – Majrooh Sultanspuri.\n\nNain Mila Ke Pyar Jata Ke Aaj Na Ja Tu – Mera Bhai Mera Dushman (1967) – With Jagjit Kaur – Khayyam – Kaifi Azmi\n\nJinke Pas Haathi Ghoda Inke Pas Dil Thoda – Dil Ka Raja (1970) – with Asha Bhosle and Manna Dey – R D Burman – Mahrooh Sultanpuri\n\nI earnestly solicit your inputs for further broad-basing our cache for the content for our carnival of blogs on the Golden Era of Hindi film music.\n\nDisclaimer: This monthly series of posts is my best-effort-based compilation of posts on Hindi film songs that I normally visit regularly.

And Naushad among the monarchs of Hindi film music. When they teamed up, the result was classic! Vijay Kumar pays a tribute to this inimitable confluence with an exploration of the music and poetry they created together.\n\nRemembering my father and the legend Madan Mohan – In response to SoY invitation, Sangeeta Gupta, the eldest daughter of Madan Mohan, joins in contributing a guest article on Madan Mohan’s songs ‘with other singers’ as a touching finale to the tandem series on Roshan and Madan Mohan on SoY.\n\nHappy Birthd Usha Mangeshkar!

All the three separately posted posts of Mohammad Rafi’s First Solo Song With The Music Director: 1954 -1958 can be accessed at / downloaded by clicking on the hyperlink.\n\nAnd, now the posts on other subjects:\n\nThe ‘Radio Songs’ from Hindi films are the songs that have radio to a major extent. The song can be the one which is being played on radio and is also seen being recorded too.\n\nChariots of Verse – The older generations rues the Axial Age of our cinema, mainly the middle 1940s to the late 1960s, when cinema and music reached heights of excellence that seem unachievable today. That age was exemplified not just by a wide range of words used, but by the high use of imagery too…Sometimes, songwriters of that time used different words or sentence structures to express essentially the same idea, like he lyrics-writer Anjaan said Teri aankh mein wo kamaal hai (Rafi/Mr India, 1961).. There are many thoughts—more or less of the same kind—that have been offered differently in 3 or more songs, even if it’s sometimes the same poet in two songs. The post engages with such poetic chariots of 3 poems with similar attributes:\n\nThe Great Horse Beat Songs of Bollywood resonates in our memories even today thanks to some of the great songs composed on that rhythm.\n\nMusically Yours, 1963: Part 3 – This is Part 3, following up Part 1 and Part 2 in a 4-part series of essays, exploring the Hindi film music of 1963, the year of birth of the writer Monica Kar. In a personal tribute to composers who gave music that makes its presence felt even after 55 years, Monica Kar explores the enduring magic of three composer-duos – Shankar Jaikishan, Kalyanji-Anandji and Laxmikant-Pyarelal.\n\nTen of my favourite Bharat Vyas songs lists the songs of Bharat Vyas to pay tribute in the centenary year of his birth.\n\nIf it’s a Harp, This Could be a Woman – there is a musical instrument that is mostly associated with women, and it’s an ancient instrument too, so for observation’s sake, its history can be studied in some detail. The instrument is called the harp, whose early shape was inspired by the curve of the hunting bow. It now comes in many shapes, but in all of them, it has a charming appearance. The post lists songs featured on women with harp.\n\nMann Kyun Behka – Utsav – Midnight Musings Aditi and Vasantsena in Utsav (1985) bonding over their love for Charudutta share their feelings in this duet..\n\nTwo of a kind lists humkhayaal thoughts from different minds, which make a subject for a fascinating study, for example:\n\nJab bhi jee chaahe nayi duniya basa lete hain log\n\nEk chehre pe kayi chehre laga lete hain log – Lata Mangeshkar – Daag, 1973) – Laxmikant Pyarelal\n\nAnd, across the border in Pakistan, the wonderfully-voiced Mehdi Hassan had rendered something similar in Saza (1969), to the poetry of Qateel Shifai:\n\nJab bhi chaahen ik nayi surat bana lete hain log\n\nEk chehre pe kayi chehre saja lete hain log\n\nJogi Jab Se Tu Aaya – Bandini – Under The Spell is the song that Love makes its presence felt and before you know it, you are under the spell.\n\nSoY concluded Best songs of 1947: And the winners are?

In the concluding post, well-known, years 1960-1968 – part of Roshan’s career has been covered. Roshan had his usual creative flavor even in the relatively less-known films like Warrant (1961) in this period, as can be seen in the songs as diverse as Hothon Pe Hasin, Ankhon Mein Shararat Raheti Hai (Lata Mangeshkar), Nigahon Mein Yeh Masti Kyon Kyun (Geeta Dutt), O Beimaan Maine Tujhe Pehchan Liya (Asha Bhosle).\n\nSix years after Rafi’s solos by Roshan, and after a tandem series on Roshan and Madan Mohan, Songs of Yore has presented two well-crafted posts on Roshan:\n\nRafi’s duets by Roshan – Out of the total 92 Rafi-Roshan songs, solos are about 35 and duets 57. Third of Roshan’s Rafi songs belong to eleven years of 1949 to 1959,, and two thirds belong to the nine years of 1960 to 1968.\n\nRoshan’s songs for ‘other’ singers – Apart from qawaalis, whenever Roshan has used other ‘singer’s, the resulting output has been quite everlasting. e.g. Yeh Ichak Beechak Chhurr (Baware Nain – 1950- Shamshad Begum)\n\nAnd, now, we take up the tributes in November, 2018:\n\nA Eulogy that Touches the Heart – Three-quarters of a century back, a child prodigy from Punjab, the sensational vocalist named Master Madan used to electrify live audiences with his light classical singing of ghazals, thumris and Punjabi gurbanis. But before he became 15 years old, the boy passed away as a result of mercury poisoning, if the rumour is true. He was able to cut just 8 records, through which he is immortalized, especially for rendering two ghazals written by Sagar Nizami: Yoon na reh reh kar humen tarsaaiye, and Hairat se tak raha hai jahaan-e-wafa mujhe…. Our films have featured kids in hundreds of situations as well as songs. On Jawaharlal Nehru’s birthday, Bal Din, the post lists some songs now, but only those where children themselves sing, without any adults singing with them.\n\nSohrab Modi – His films always carried Social or National Message – (born 2 November 1897) a great filmmaker of the 1930s 1940s.and 1950s.
