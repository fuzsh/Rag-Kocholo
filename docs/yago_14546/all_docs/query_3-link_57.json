        "text": "The supporters and defenders of The Kashmir Files are equal as some hail the realism shown of atrocity against the Kashmiri Pandits while some continue to call it islamophobic propaganda. Recently amongst one of such offended parties, screenwriter Saeed Akhtar Mirza called the Vivek Agnihotri directorial ‘Garbage’.\n\nCalling Out The Kashmir Files and saying that all religions were affected in the ‘vulgar trap’, Saeed shared his thoughts.\n\nHe told The Indian Express, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.”\n\nVivek Agnihotri reacting to the same took a jibe and said that he’ll meet Saeed after the release of The Delhi Files and that Bollywood promotes ‘Muslim victimhood’.\n\nIn a video shared later, Vivek claimed that Bollywood has a genre called ‘Muslim Genre’ that he called ‘The Harsh Truth’. See it here:-\n\nRecently, filmmaker Ashoke Pandit reacted to the Besharam Rang controversy and weighed it with The Kashmir Files.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Ashoke wrote, “If abusing & trolling @vivekagnihotri was right & hence the entire industry kept quiet, then automatically trolling & stupid comments against #Pathaan become valid. If attack on #KashmirFiles was wrong, then the same applies to #Pathaan. Let’s not be selective with our responses!”\n\n“Our silence at certain moments because it suits an agenda makes our enemies stronger. I stood by all those films like #UdtaPunjab & #Padmaavat which were abused by fundamentalists, but saw no support by the industry. Enemies hv misused this division between different camps,” his followup tweet read.\n\nReacting to the same, Vivek Agnihotri dropped ‘Hmm…’ which left the internet to wander and find their own answers.\n\nAmidst the entire country boiling with boycotts and controversies, Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi hailed Amitabh Bachchan and SRK for their views at KIFF 2022.\n\nShe tweeted, “Glad to see Sh. @SrBachchan and Sh. @iamsrk take the lead to call out the controversies-a-day created around movies, moral policing, boycott calls and hate narratives built for political purposes. High time indeed to break the silence.”"
