        "text": "Note: This is a postscript to The Godhra Riots:\n\nSifting Fact from Fiction, July 2013, by the same author.\n\nIn May this year, the people of India chose their Prime Minister. Over twelve\n\nyears, several inquiry commissions — the Tewatia Committee (2010), the\n\nNanavati Commission (2008), the Special Investigation Team (2011) under the\n\nSupreme Court — cleared Narendra Modi of all charges of having\n\nmasterminded or, at least, encouraged the Godhra riots.1 Still, his detractors —\n\npoliticians and ideology-driven activists in India, the US and Europe — have\n\ncontinued to label him “merchant of death”, “butcher”, “Nazi”, “fascist”,\n\n“murderer”, etc.\n\nLet us examine the facts and see whether they can point to the riot’s real\n\nmastermind.\n\nThe Role of Congress Members\n\nOn 27 February 2002, when a coach of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya\n\nwent up in flames at Godhra railway station, a Congress member of the Godhra\n\nmunicipality, Haji Balal, led a mob and stopped the fire-fighting vehicle on its\n\nway to the station. The fire crew reported that “he had been visiting the fire\n\nstation at night for the past few days on the pretext of watching films on\n\ntelevision.” Haji Balal got the fire-fighting vehicles sabotaged beforehand: one\n\nof the main vehicles had its clutch plates taken out a few days earlier; also\n\nremoved was the nut connecting the pipe with the water tank on the other\n\nengine.2\n\nHaji Balal who, according to locals, proudly proclaimed himself the “Bin\n\nLaden of Godhra”, is among eleven people convicted for criminal conspiracy\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 2\n\nand murder and sentenced to death by a special fast track court in the highsecurity\n\nSabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad on 22 February 2011.3\n\nOther Congress members were also “booked for the carnage”.4 The\n\nattack on the pilgrims was carried out “according to what was planned earlier\n\nunder the directions of [the late] Maulvi Umarji”,5 a religious leader of the\n\nGhanchi Muslims of Godhra.6 “All the acts like procuring petrol, circulating\n\nfalse rumour, stopping the train and entering in coach S/6 were in pursuance of\n\nthe object of the conspiracy,” concluded the Nanavati Report. “The conspiracy\n\nhatched by these persons further appears to be a part of a larger conspiracy to\n\ncreate terror and destabilise the Administration.”7\n\n“Destabilise the Administration”: Narendra Modi had assumed office as\n\nGujarat Chief Minister on 7 October 2001, four months earlier. Incidentally,\n\nMaulvi Umarji got a ticket to campaign for the Congress in December 2002 state\n\nelection in Gujarat.\n\nIn order to quickly gather a crowd of angry Muslims to the Godhra\n\nstation and attack the train, so that no one would guess who was pouring petrol\n\nin the S6 and S7 coaches, rumours that a Ghanchi Muslim girl had been\n\nabducted by the Kar Sevaks were spread by the Jamiat-Ulema-E-Hind (JUH), a\n\nlong-standing ally of the Congress.8\n\nFrom the start of the crisis, Narendra Modi appealed to the people to\n\nremain calm and exert self-control. On five occasions between 27 and 28\n\nFebruary, “CM addressed Media, Assembly and General public and\n\neverywhere the genesis and intention was one and the same, to punish the\n\nculprits responsible for the Godhra incident in an exemplary manner, so that it\n\ndid not recur ever again.”9 He announced an ex-gratia payment of 200,000\n\nrupees to the next of kin of those killed in the Godhra incident and ordered a\n\nhigh-level inquiry into the incident.10\n\nOn 1st March, less than two days after the tragedy and while riots were\n\nraging, Modi requested the chief secretaries of neighbouring states of Madhya\n\nPradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan to send ten companies of armed police\n\nfrom each state to assist the government in “handling law and order situation”.\n\nAs the sociologist and author Madhu Kishwar points out,11 all three states then\n\nhad Congress governments, and all three turned down the request.\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 3\n\nThe Campaign\n\nLet us recall that the BJP-led NDA alliance had been in power at the Centre\n\nsince 1998, confirmed by fresh elections in 1999. A 15-million-rupee campaign\n\nby journalist-activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, funded by\n\nthe Congress Party and Communists to “politically isolate the BJP”,12 failed to\n\nconvince the Indian people, who voted the BJP to power. And the crusaders\n\nhad to swallow the obvious — that the streets of India remained peaceful\n\nduring the NDA regime.13\n\nThey however found a fertile ground in the US, especially with the\n\nevangelical lobbies.14 On 1st April 2002 Teesta Setalvad created “Citizens for\n\nJustice and Peace” (CJP), an NGO “outsourced by the Congress to the job of\n\nattacking Modi”, as Madhu Kishwar put it.15 The activists approached the\n\nUnited States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a U.S.\n\ngovernment-funded body, with known roots in the evangelical movement,\n\nwhose “original intention was to protect Christians around the world … to\n\nreview facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom\n\ninternationally — and to make policy recommendations to the President,\n\nSecretary of State, and the Congress”.16 Testifying before the USCIRF, Teesta\n\nSetalvad alleged that the BJP had conducted:\n\nsuccessful pogroms and attacks against the countries religious\n\nminorities, … recent state-sponsored Genocide of the Muslim\n\nCommunity in Gujarat … Brutal destruction of life, through rape,\n\nquartering of bodies, urinating on them and incarcerating [sic] them so\n\nthat there is no trace or evidence of their remains … desecrating over 270\n\nreligious and cultural shrines belonging to the community … through\n\nsystematic planning and targeted action by armed militias ideologically\n\ndriven by the vision of a supreme and exclusive Hindu rashtra (state). …\n\nOver 2,000 lost their lives, 500 are missing and 250-300 girls and women\n\nwere gang-raped before being quartered, burned and killed.17\n\nThis “testimony” from India is what fed countless self-styled human\n\nrights organizations and intellectuals in India and in the West. They drank in\n\nSetalvad’s words and regurgitated them as articles and “reports” with a\n\nplethora of gory details.\n\nAs regards the number of riot victims, invariably quoted in thousands,\n\nthe then Police Commissioner P.C. Pande, in a statement to the Special\n\nInvestigating Team, declared,\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 4\n\n… it was incorrect to say that 1000 people lost their lives in Ahmedabad\n\nCity during the riots of 2002, whereas the actual number of deaths\n\nbetween February 28th 2002 and April 30th 2002 was 442, of whom 113\n\nwere Hindus and 329 Muslims. … All offences committed were duly and\n\nproperly registered including by sending police officers to relief camps\n\nand therefore, no important crime remained unregistered.18\n\nAccording to the Congress-led UPA government’s statement in\n\nParliament on 11 May 2005, the final figures of those killed in the Godhra riots\n\nare 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus.19 In any case, the endlessly repeated figure of\n\n“2000 Muslim victims” has no basis in actual fact.\n\nThe SIT and Sanjeev Bhatt\n\nFacts cannot so easily be wished away. And they were nailed by the Nanavati\n\nReport and the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT),\n\nheaded by former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chief R.K. Raghavan in\n\nresponse to a petition filed by Jakia Nasim, Ehsan Jafri’s20 widow, and Teesta\n\nSetalvad, which alleged criminal conspiracy by Narendra Modi’s government.21\n\nJakia Nasim’s testimony before the Nanavati Commission and Supreme Court\n\nin 2002 and 2003 was that “the mob would have lynched all of them but for the\n\ntimely action by the police”. Four years later, her praise turned into complaint\n\n— except that the poor lady was not even aware of what she complained or\n\npetitioned about: “She has no personal knowledge of the allegations mentioned\n\nin the affidavits filed by R.B. Sreekumar during the years 2002, 2004 and 2005\n\non his own”, said the SIT.22\n\nLet us explain: The SIT, appointed on 23 March 2008, investigated two\n\nretired Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, one of them being R.B. Sreekumar\n\njust mentioned, to whom we will shortly return. The second one, Sanjeev Bhatt,\n\nthen Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence in the Gujarat government, claimed\n\nafter years of silence that he was present at a law and order meeting convened\n\nby the Chief Minister on 27 February night at his residence. At this meeting,\n\nwhich lasted 15-20 minutes, Sanjeev Bhatt claims that the Chief Minister said\n\nthat “for too long the Gujarat police had been following the approach of\n\nbalancing the action against Hindus and Muslims … that the situation\n\nwarranted that the Muslims be taught a lesson, … it was imperative that Hindus\n\nbe allowed to vent out their anger….”23\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 5\n\nAs it turned out, none of the officials present even remembered the\n\npresence of Sanjeev Bhatt. Interrogated independently later, they denied any\n\nsuch talk by the Chief Minister, who, they asserted, said instead that the\n\nGodhra flare-up was very unfortunate and should be handled with a firm hand.\n\nThe discussions centred around maintenance of law and order in view of the\n\ncall for a bandh on the next day and the availability of forces. Ahmedabad\n\nPolice Commissioner P.C. Pandey categorically stated that no instructions to\n\nallow any freedom to law-breakers were given by the Chief Minister. According\n\nto Prakash S. Shah, then Additional Secretary (Law & Order), the Chief Minister\n\ninstructed all the officers that “communal peace and harmony be maintained at\n\nall costs and all possible steps be taken to control the possible communal flareup.”\n\n24\n\nAs for Sanjeev Bhatt’s testimony, the SIT called fax messages produced\n\nby him “not genuine”, “forged document, fabricated subsequently by someone\n\nwith a vested interest.”25 “This conduct of Shri Sanjiv [sic] Bhatt in arranging,\n\nprompting and controlling the witness [a witness produced by him] to\n\ncorroborate his statement is highly suspicious and undesirable.”26 And from the\n\nlocation of his mobile phone, his claim of being present at the said meeting at\n\nthe Chief Minister’s residence proved to be false. “Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is a tainted\n\nwitness and therefore, cannot be relied upon keeping in view his background in\n\nthe police department as he was involved in criminal cases of serious nature\n\nand departmental inquiries are also in progress against him.”27 Cases against\n\nhim included inflicting torture in custody leading to death, abduction, extortion\n\nand unprovoked firing, killings and planting narcotics with a view to blackmail.\n\nSIT head R.K. Raghavan concluded that Bhatt had lied and brought in tutored\n\nwitnesses to falsely implicate Modi.28 The Gujarat Vigilance Commission\n\nrecommended his suspension twice (on 15-07-2002 and 19-10-2006) for\n\nprofessional misconduct, but each time he managed to evade prosecution.29\n\nA last brush stroke on Sanjeev Bhatt’s erratic comportment is given by\n\nsenior lawyer Ram Jethmalani in a Sunday Guardian article. The man “handed\n\nover charge and his official computer, leaving all his emails in an unprotected\n\nmode for all to read”… The state government forwarded the material to the SIT\n\nfor investigations, and thanks to this irresponsible gesture, authorities\n\nharvested details of his “hobnobbing with the Opposition Congress party in a\n\nthoroughly illegal and almost seditious manner to concoct evidence against the\n\nChief Minister and the state of Gujarat”. To this end Bhatt was in constant touch\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 6\n\nwith top Congress party leaders, from whom he received not only guidance,\n\nbut “packages” and “materials”, as per his own statement.30\n\nAn Activist’s Career\n\nThe activist Teesta Setalvad built a successful career on the Godhra issue and on\n\ndemonizing Narendra Modi, for which she has been covered with national and\n\ninternational awards. Let us mention just a few:\n\n• In August 2002, the Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavana [Communal\n\nHarmony] Award instituted by the Congress (I), jointly with Harsh\n\nMander (former IAS officer and NAC board member)31, “for their\n\noutstanding contribution towards communal harmony and national\n\nintegration”.\n\n• In 2003, the Nuremberg International Human Rights Award (jointly with\n\nIbn Abdur Rehman, a Pakistani “peace and human-rights advocate and\n\nveteran communist from Pakistan”).32\n\n• The New York-based Parliamentarians for Global Action’s 2004\n\nDefenders’ of Democracy Award, for her efforts “to ensure justice for the\n\nvictims of the genocide in Gujarat.\n\n• In 2006, the Nani Palkhivala Award. In her acceptance speech, Setalvad\n\nwas all praise for an IPS officer to whom she dedicates her award,\n\nsomeone “who stood mighty in the face of a murderous and vindictive\n\nGujarat administration.”33\n\n• In 2007, the Padma Shri Award from the Government of India, which\n\nsince May 2004 had been run by a Congress-led coalition.\n\nThe ISRO Spy Scandal\n\nThe IPS officer praised by Setalvad (and referred to earlier by the SIT) is R.B.\n\nSreekumar. He is remembered for the 1994 Indian Space Research Organization\n\n(ISRO) spy scandal which implicated eminent ISRO scientists. Dust may have\n\nsmothered the case with time but not the memory of those who were falsely\n\naccused. The story in brief:\n\nDevelopment of the Indian [rocket’s] upper stage had been underway\n\nwith Russian help for four years when the arrangements were\n\ndenounced by American President George Bush as a violation of the\n\nMissile Technology Control Regime. … In May 1992, the Bush\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 7\n\nadministration announced that it was applying American sanctions on\n\nboth the ISRO and Glavcosmos [the Russian agency collaborating with\n\nISRO].34\n\nS. Nambi Narayan, a senior scientist at the Vikram Sarabhai Space\n\nCentre, an ISRO centre at Trivandrum (Kerala), was arrested on 30 November\n\n1994 without any search being conducted at his office or home. Harassed and\n\ntortured, he refused to confess to the charge of selling defence secrets to two\n\nalleged Maldivian spies; he also refused to implicate the director of the Liquid\n\nPropulsion Systems Centre. Nambi Narayan collapsed under the torture and\n\nwas hospitalized. He was released after fifty days in custody. A colleague of his,\n\nD. Sasikumaran, was similarly arrested and interrogated. The two Maldivian\n\nwomen and two businessmen were also arrested and implicated.\n\nUpon his release on 19 January 1995, Nambi Narayan was transferred\n\nout of Trivandrum; ISRO reinstated him and promoted him as director of\n\nAdvanced Technology and Planning, but he was now a broken man.\n\nThe case was investigated by the CBI. A year later, in April 1996, its\n\nreport indicted the Intelligence Bureau (IB) as the main organization\n\nresponsible for creating an imaginary spy ring and falsely implicating the two\n\neminent space scientists (besides two Maldivian women who were framed as\n\n“spies”). The CBI came down heavily on nine IB officials for “acting in an\n\nunprofessional manner and being privy to the arrest of six innocent persons,\n\nthereby causing them immense mental and physical agony”. The information\n\ncollected by the IB and the Kerala police was “not only false but was forcefully\n\nextracted from the six accused”.35 The CBI filed its closure report on April 30,\n\n1996, recommending that the accused be discharged, and necessary action taken\n\nagainst the IB officials and the Kerala Police.36\n\nSeveral IB officers were, according to the CBI report, responsible for this\n\nunprecedented frame-up, especially:\n\n• IB Director D.C. Pathak got the espionage case registered under the\n\nIndian Official Secrets Act 1923, “so that the case would get a transnational\n\ndimension, even though the Act makes it clear that the Kerala\n\nPolice have no legal right to do so”, as highlighted by the Kerala High\n\nCourt and Supreme Court of India. Pathak advised the Kerala Director\n\nGeneral of Police (DGP) to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT);\n\nhe also “informed” the then ISRO Chairman, K. Kasturirangan, that\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 8\n\n“incriminating documents had been seized from the scientists”.37 Pathak\n\nwas indicted by the CBI in 1996 and sacked.\n\n• Rattan Seghal had joined the IB as additional director five months before\n\nS. Nambi Narayan’s arrest. In November 1996, Seghal was “caught redhanded”\n\nby the then IB chief Arun Bhagath while having a secret\n\nrendezvous with two undercover CIA agents to hand over sensitive\n\ninformation about India’s Atomic Energy Commission. He was dismissed\n\nfrom service, but allowed to escape and settle in America.38\n\n• R.B. Sreekumar was an IPS officer seconded to the Central Industrial\n\nSecurity Force, and posted as commandant in charge of security of the\n\nVikram Sarabhai Space Centre where Nambi Narayan was working. “The\n\nUSA, with its excellent information gathering machinery, got wind of\n\nwhat was going on inside VSSC, and put the CIA on the job of sabotaging\n\nthe cryogenic project,” writes Sam Rajappa.39 At the time of Nambi\n\nNarayan’s arrest, Sreekumar was posted as Rattan Seghal’s deputy.\n\nDespite being indicted by the CBI, Sreekumar was in 1998 awarded a\n\n“Medal for Distinguished Service” by the Government of India. We will\n\nreturn to him soon as he was probably the main player in the plot.\n\nIn Kerala’s Congress-led government (UDF), infighting raged between\n\ntwo camps over the ISRO Spy case. Chief Minister K. Karunakaran being no\n\nparty to the spy story, he was forced to step down in March 1995 as he refused\n\nto drop charges against the IB officials implicated in the case. With A.K. Antony\n\nreplacing him, the said officials were not prosecuted.\n\nA change of regime followed in favour of the Communists; the new\n\ngovernment issued a notification to reopen investigations into the ISRO spy\n\ncase, and it was to be investigated by the same IB officials!40 On 29 April 1998,\n\nthe Supreme Court reprimanded the Kerala Government for ordering yet\n\nanother investigation by the State police after an inquiry by the CBI had found\n\nthat the allegations of espionage were false and the accused had been ordered\n\nto be released. It quashed the notification for being “patently invalid … and\n\nissued with malafide intention.”41\n\nIn 1998 the first work illuminating the story in detail came out — and\n\nalmost instantly vanished from the shelves. In an article about his book Spies in\n\nSpace: The ISRO Frame-up, J. Rajasekharan Nair author pertinently asks:\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 9\n\nWhat about the charge that the cryogenic missile technology was\n\ntransferred from ISRO to enemy countries? To begin with, India does\n\nnot have cryogenic technology even today [in 2013]. How could then, in\n\n1994, ‘spies’ transfer this non-existent technology? … 42\n\nProf. Nambi Narayanan echoes those words in a recent interview to\n\nRediff:\n\n… at that time, we had not developed cryogenic technology, how can\n\nyou sell a non-existent technology?43\n\nIn September 1999, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)\n\nordered the Kerala government to pay an interim compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs\n\n(one million) out of 1 crore (10 millions) to Nambi Narayan “for having\n\ndamaged Narayanan’s distinguished career in space research along with the\n\nphysical and mental torture to which he and his family were subjected.” A\n\ndivision bench of the Kerala high court upheld the order. But Kerala’s\n\nCongress-led government managed to block the payment, till Nambi\n\nNarayanan finally won a case for a compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs which he\n\nreceived in September 2012 — 18 years after his arrest.\n\nR.B. Sreekumar was sent back to his parent institution in Gujarat in\n\nAugust 2000. Disciplinary proceedings against him were started in 1999, but\n\nonly on 29 January 2004 was he served a chargesheet by the Ministry of Home\n\nAffairs. The charges included:\n\n• Illegally taking into custody the accused persons from the custody of\n\nKerala Police without completing the legal formalities and conducting an\n\nindependent investigation totally disassociating the Kerala Police.\n\n• Torturing/ill-treating the accused persons during the investigation.\n\nConsequently, no written statement was recorded.\n\n• The interrogation statements prepared by Sreekumar’s team were left\n\nunsigned and undated, indicating devious intent.\n\n• Failing to conduct verification of the statements of the accused persons …\n\nwhich reflects lack of proper supervision, integrity to duty …44\n\nWithout examining those implicated in the case, the investigations\n\nagainst Sreekumar, which involved charges of endangering national security,\n\nsaw his file rush to closure in just 43 days, from 13 December 2004 to 24 January\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 10\n\n2005: Sreekumar was cleared of all charges.45 In 2008, the UPA government\n\ngranted him in addition the Gangadharan Memorial Award for Best Police\n\nMan, for his “courageous and competent performance of duties” during the\n\n2002 Gujarat riots. He was invited with Teesta Setalvad for a lecture tour to the\n\nUS, organized by the Indian Muslim Council-USA, to deliver discourses against\n\nNarendra Modi and the state of Gujarat, disregarding all evidence and\n\ninvestigations.46\n\nThe same Congress-led Kerala government blocked all the CBI\n\nrecommendations against IB and police officials, till it ordered closure of the\n\nfile, fifteen years having conveniently passed since the case was initiated.47\n\nHowever, on 20 October 2014, on an appeal from an indomitable Nambi\n\nNarayanan, Justice Ramakrishna Pillai of Kerala High Court quashed the order\n\nexonerating three police officials involved in the case.48\n\nLet us see whether they will finally be prosecuted and face justice — and\n\nnot only these three but all those responsible for trying to wreck India’s space\n\nprogramme at the behest of a foreign power.\n\nCooked-Up Affidavits\n\nThe UPA government cleared Sreekumar of the CBI charges against him but not\n\nwithout a quid pro quo: he became an ideal “prime witness” in the 2002 Godhra\n\nriots. When questioned by the Nanavati Commission before 2005, Sreekumar\n\nhad never made any allegation against the Gujarat Chief Minister. He even\n\nsubmitted a letter “raising questions over Sanjeev Bhatt’s integrity for speaking\n\nup against Narendra Modi”. But from 9 April 2005 onward, with his third\n\naffidavit to the Nanavati Commission, he joined Bhatt’s and Setalvad’s\n\ndemonization of the Gujarat administration.49\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court’s Special Investigation Team (SIT)\n\ninquiring into the Godhra events found the allegations in Sreekumar’s\n\naffidavits to be “vague”, “too general in nature, [with] nothing specific against\n\nany individual police officer.”50 Sreekumar’s testimony was based on an\n\n“unauthorised register” which appeared only in 2005, with entries noted down\n\nfrom memory, including Narendra Modi’s alleged oral instructions to\n\nencourage riots between Hindus and Muslims. The SIT observed that disclosure\n\nwas made about the said register only “after he was denied promotion.”51 “The\n\nregister … cannot be considered to be a reliable document, as the same appears\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 11\n\nmotivated and no credence can be placed upon the same. Moreover there is no\n\ncorroboration to the oral version of R.B. Sreekumar by any of the independent\n\nwitnesses. The allegation is, therefore, not established.”52\n\nBesides, the SIT found twenty-two “witnesses” whose signed affidavits\n\nwere drafted, typed and printed on the same computer: their signatories were\n\nnot even aware of what they had signed of the alleged incidents.53\n\nEuros and US dollars flowed to Teesta Setalvad’s NGO. Among the\n\ndonors were the Netherland-based Humanistic Institute for Co-Operation with\n\nthe Developing Countries (HIVOS), the ever-ready Ford Foundation, etc…54 A\n\nstatement of financial transactions of Teesta Setalvad and her NGOs, obtained\n\nthrough a Right to Information petition, revealed how she went from “rags to\n\nriches after 2000 Gujarat riots. A person who was not in a position to deposit\n\neven Rs. 500 in her account continuously for two years (from 1st Jan., 2001 to 31st\n\nDec, 2002), could manage to get deposit of Rs. 1.49 crores in her account and Rs.\n\n92.21 Lakhs into her husband Javed Anand’s account after Gujarat 2002 riots.”55\n\nFollowing the Clues\n\nAnswers to the following questions contain the clues to the real masterminds of\n\nthe Godhra events:\n\n• Who gave orders to the Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh,\n\nMaharashtra and Rajasthan to deny Gujarat the help it was urgently\n\nasking for to control the riots?\n\n• “Tainted witness” Sanjeev Bhatt having “lied and brought in tutored\n\nwitnesses to falsely implicate Modi,”56 the Gujarat Vigilance Commission\n\nrecommended his suspension twice (on 15-07-2002 and 19-10-2006) for\n\nprofessional misconduct: with whose help did he manage to evade\n\nprosecution each time?57\n\n• Who gave instructions to the IB and Kerala police officers to frame ISRO\n\nscientists, putting a brake on India’s space programmes?\n\n• From 1994 to 2014, who shielded the IB officials and the Kerala police from\n\nbeing prosecuted as per the CBI’s recommendations?\n\n• In particular, who shielded Sreekumar in the ISRO spy case, extracting in\n\nthe process his cooperation in the demonization of Narendra Modi?\n\nThe Godhra Riots — Postscript: The Masterminds / p. 12\n\n• Who in the previous UPA government decided not to prosecute Teesta\n\nSetalvad for perjury, arranging false witnesses and fabricated affidavits,\n\nand for misappropriating funds intended for riot victims?\n\nYears ago, while campaigning in Gujarat, Sonia Gandhi had accused\n\nNarendra Modi of being a “merchant of death”.
