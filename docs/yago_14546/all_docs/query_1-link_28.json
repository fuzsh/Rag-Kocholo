I had to do a lot of preparation in order to get into the skin of the character and match the brilliance of ace actor – Naseeruddin Shah. Also, I feel privileged that an entertainment house like Shemaroo who has been in the business is showcasing the movie on their OTT platform ‘ShemarooMe’. The OTT medium is becoming very exciting and it would be great to connect with the audience, reaching out not only to the hinterlands of India but also to global audiences in the USA who enjoy Bollywood.”\n\nDirector of Albert Pinto ko Gussa Kyu Atta Hai, Soumitra Ranade said, ‘In the earlier days, a Friday would decide the fate of a film but that’s not the case anymore.

Shemaroo has a huge track record of being in the entertainment industry and I am sure the film will become accessible to hundreds and thousands of people across the country.
