Lubna Salim\n\n3. Ankur\n\nSynopsis : Anubhav Verma, is a middle aged white collared office-goer who has been forced to relocate to his present home to support his only son's specific studies targeting the premium engineering institutions of the country. He is getting increasingly frustrated when he sees the wards of his neighbours settling into jobs, while his son has not achieved anything significant. Thus his sense of equanimity is disturbed and he starts to assign reasons, real as well as imaginary, to his increasing ill health. His imaginary ill health increasingly begins to affect his mental state, which in turn starts to disturb the equilibrium in his family. This leads to scenes of acerbic altercations with his wife and son. As things seem to hurtle inexorably towards a violent climactic showdown, something suddenly happens which brings the Vermas back on a normal track.\n\nDirector Bio : Rahul Srivastava is an alumnus of the prestigious Film and Television Institute of India, Pune and a man possessing myriad talents.

He has edited feature films like Saheb Biwi aur Gangster, Saheb Biwi aur Gangster Returns, Bullet Raja and many more. He was nominated as the best editor by Apsara Producers Guild awards. He has directed several ad films and brand films as an ad filmmaker, which have become extremely popular with a wide audience. His roots in Allahabad have made Rahul a writer of tremendous sensitivity and compassion but one who retains the quintessential flavour of the Gangetic hinterland as well.\n\nFilmography :"
