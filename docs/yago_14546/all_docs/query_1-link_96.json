        "text": "By Mahlia Lone\n\nFrom afar it seems that a superstar’s life is perfect. We can neither look inside their homes to see their personal lives, nor assess their mental, emotional or spiritual health for ourselves. The audience is fed a perfectly constructed image. Aamir Khan, who looks like he’s got it all together, battled the demon of depression in the isolation of his home for four years following his separation and subsequent divorce from his first wife; he was rendered unable to work, barely mustering up the will to leave his house. His younger brother has a history of severe mental illness, so weak nerves and a highly sensitive nature may run in the family. But then destiny intervened in the shape of assistant director Kiran Malik who was a ray of the sunshine in his life and Aamir, taking a chance, grabbed on to her and in time wedded her. She filled his life with her radiance and cheery spirits and together they have built a new happy life Â\n\nAamir comes from a film family. He was born inÂ MumbaiÂ on 14th March 1965 toÂ film producer Tahir Hussain and his wife Zeenat, and is the second eldest of four siblings:Â Farhat, who lives in New Jersey, Faisal, also an actor, andÂ Nikhat, a film producer.Â Tahirâ€™s older brother, Nasir HussainÂ was a film producer, director and screenwriter who produced a string of formulaic but successful films with his core team under the Nasir Hussain Films banner. One such is Teesri Manzil, directed byÂ Vijay Anand, starring Hussainâ€™s favourite stars Shammi Kapoor and Asha Parekh withÂ R.D. Burman composing the filmâ€™s scoreÂ for the first time. The filmâ€™s songs became so popular that they are played to this day and include O Haseena Zulfonwali, O Mere Sona Re, Deewaana Mujhsa Nahin, Tumne Mujhe Dekha, and Aaja Aaja Main Hoon Pyaar Tera. ActorÂ Imran Khan, whom Aamir launched in films, is Nasir Hussainâ€™s grandson.\n\nAamir Khan with father Tahir Hussain, elder sister Nikhat Khan & mother Zeenat Hussain\n\nAamir with his mother Zeenat Hussain\n\nAamir with his struggling filmmaker father Tahir Hussain\n\nThe Hussain brothersâ€™ were also related to Indiaâ€™s first Muslim President Dr. Zakir Hussain. On his maternal side, Aamir is the great grand-nephew of freedom fighter, Islamic philosopher, Urdu poet, renowned educationist and Indiaâ€™s first Education MinisterÂ Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, whose birthday is celebrated each year as National Education Day across India. So proud is Aamir of his academic ancestor that he has named his youngest son Azaad after him.\n\nAamir attended J.B. Petit School,Â St. Anneâ€™s High School, Bandra, theÂ Bombay Scottish School, Mahim and the Narsee Monjee College, but he said he â€œwas much more into sports than studies,â€ playing tennis at state level championships. Looking back he said that his childhood was â€œtoughâ€ due to the financial difficulties faced by his father. â€œThere would be at least 30 calls a day from creditors calling for their money.â€ His father was so hard up financially that he could barely afford his childrenâ€™s school fees.\n\nAamirâ€™s first brush with acting was at the age of eight when he first appeared in a song in his UncleÂ Nasir Hussainâ€™s filmÂ Yaadon Ki BaaraatÂ (1973). The next year, he was cast by his father in his own film Madhosh.Â Bitten by the acting bug, at sixteen the budding actor played the lead opposite Neena Gupta and Victor Bannerjee in a teenage experimental production of a 40-minute silent film,Â Paranoia, which was made on a shoestring budget of a few thousand rupees. His parents were not happy with him wanting to be an actor as they wanted him to have the steady income of a professional, so heÂ did it in hiding. He enjoyed acting and assisting the director so much that he decided to pursue a career in film and, while still a student, worked backstage part time for a theatre group called Avantar. Finally, a year later he started getting acting parts on stage as well.\n\nAs a child actor\n\nIn Yaadon ki Baaraat\n\nAfter completing high school, Aamir started working full time as an assistant director for his uncle Nasir Hussain on the set of the films Manzil Manzil (1984) andÂ ZabardastÂ (1985). Meanwhile, directorÂ Ketan Mehta offered him a small role in the low-budget experimental filmÂ HoliÂ (1984) featuring an ensemble cast of teenage newcomers. As Aamir reached maturity, Nasir Hussain cast him as the leading man in his son Mansoor Hussainâ€™s directorial debutÂ Qayamat Se Qayamat TakÂ (1988) opposite former Miss IndiaÂ Juhi Chawla in a contemporary take on Shakespeareâ€™sÂ Romeo and Juliet. Aamir plays a cute, â€œclean-cut, wholesome boy-next-doorâ€ college student. The movie was a runaway success, making both the newcomer leads overnight stars.Â It received sevenÂ Filmfare Awards,Â including aÂ Best Male Debut award for Aamir. But more than Juhi, there was another young, short haired girl in the movie who had already stolen his heart. You can see her in a scene standing cheering in the audience when Aamir is on stage lip-syncing to the popular song Papa kehtey thay bada naam karega.\n\nWedding\n\nAamir & Reena with their kids\n\nThis girl extra was his childhood sweetheart Reena Dutta whom he had married in 1986 against the wishes of their families when he was only 21.\n\nThe couple refrained from having children while Aamir focused on establishing his career. Reena shunned the limelight and stayed in the background because having a wife adversely affected a young romantic heroâ€™s rising popularity. A marriage would be a hindrance to his romantic hero image. Staying home, Reena grew very close to Aamirâ€™s family. Their son Junaid was born after 7 years of marriage and daughter Ira after 12. All the while Aamirâ€™s career progressed steadily.\n\nBritish journalist Jessican Hines lives as a single mother in London with her son Jaan whom she claims was sired by Aamir while he was still married to first wife, Reena\n\nWith Pooja Bhatt with whom he was rumored to have had an on set affair\n\nThen came Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India, a period sports drama, the storyline of which was so gripping when he heard it that Aamir Khan signed on not just as the star but as the filmâ€™s producer, starting up his own production company Aamir Khan Productions in the process with Reena at the helm as the filmâ€™s executive producer. The story is set in a small village the inhabitants of which are unable to pay their taxes due to drought and are challenged by a British civil servant to a cricket match for a wager over their tax dues, thinking that there was no way the British team wonâ€™t win. The starving villagers were desperate enough to accept, but they didnâ€™t know how to play the game and had to learn quickly, quite a riveting story.\n\nAamirâ€™s company invested $10 million into the filmâ€™s budget, the highest for an Indian movie till then. Then being a perfectionist, Aamir, along with director Ashutosh Gowariker and the entire cast and crew left no stone unturned to make their masterpiece. Since the film is set during the Victorian period of the British Raj in a drought-ridden village, they scoured the countryside for a dry and ancient looking village with no modern amenities, like electricity, etc. before deciding upon Bhuj in Gujarat. The antique looking 19th century style tools and equipment were actual ones that the villagers still used, while the musical instruments of that time were collected from around the country. Sparing no expense, Aamir hired a 300 strong crew for six months and rented as well as furnished accommodation for them.Â The costumes for the cast were meticulously researched and made by Bhanu Athaiya, who had earlier won anÂ Oscar for Best Costume Designs for the filmÂ Gandhi.\n\nAs a newly married couple\n\nIn 2001,Â LagaanÂ premiered at theÂ International Indian Film Academy AwardsÂ (IIFA) inÂ Sun City, South Africa to rave reviews. The movie became so popular atÂ Switzerlandâ€™s Locarno International Film Festival with some audience members reportedly dancing to its soundtrack in the aisles that it was shown four times and not the usual once. It also won the festivalâ€™sÂ Prix du PublicÂ award. Doing the film festival circuit, it was shown at the festivals of Sundance, Cairo,Â Stockholm,Â Helsinki and Toronto to critical acclaim. Film criticÂ Kevin Thomas of theÂ Los Angeles TimesÂ wrote that the film is â€œan affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it to the level of an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view.â€ The movie was nominated for theÂ Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but didnâ€™t win. Aamir attended the award show clad in a black achkan.\n\nThe movie was significant in his life for another reason as well. It was on the shoot of Lagaan that Aamir first met short haired, bohemian-looking young assistant director Kiran Rao, whom one day he was to marry. She came from an aristocratic family as her paternal grandfather wasÂ J. Rameshwar Rao,Â Raja of Wanaparthy, a large estate in Telangana under theÂ Nizam of Hyderabad. She told a reporter later that as a fourteen-year-old she had seenÂ QSQTÂ on the new VCR her family had bought. â€œI loved him (Aamir) in it but I enjoyed the film more. I was like â€˜What a great film, what great music, what acting and what a cute guy!â€™ The impression of him she came away with was â€˜he is one of the few good actors in the industry.â€™â€ However, when she accepted the film job, she did not think she would spend any time with the filmâ€™s star since she was a lowly assistant at the time.\n\nReportedly it was his on set affair with Preity Zinta, which was the last straw that broke his first marriage\n\nBut destiny had other plans for the two. Akhil Renjith described how Aamir and Kiran met:\n\nâ€œHer first encounter with him was on the bus in which they were travelling to Bhuj for a recce. Though no one imagined Aamirâ€™s company on that journey as the bus was full of technicians and crew members, â€˜Aamir Khan, who is a superstar, was also on the bus. But Aamir was not just on the bus, he also made conversation with every assistant, asked their names, introduced himself,â€™ Kiran said and eventually they talked for the first time. This first encounter with Aamir made Kiran realise that he was a regular chilled out person with no starry tantrums. â€˜He had no filmi persona about him at all,â€™ she revealed. Though he was surrounded by security guards, she found him completely down to earth. She felt there was no snobbery or I donâ€™t talk to assistants kind of attitude in him, which impressed her.\n\nThey enjoy a happy & lighthearted camraderie\n\nAamir remembered their word-building games, which they used to play on the sets of Lagaan. His general impression about her was of a really nice, warm, happy, bright girl who is fun to be with. He also confessed that the earrings which a character wore in LagaanÂ actually belonged to Kiran, which he borrowed from her. After that they met while Kiran was doing some work on the Goa schedule ofÂ Dil Chahta Hai. That is when she reminded him that he owed her a pair of earrings in exchange for the ones he borrowed forÂ Lagaan.Â Aamir actually went with Reena, his wife at that time, and shopped for earrings from the Taj hotel shop for Kiran.â€\n\nReturning her the earrings he had borrowed from her for the actress in Lagaan\n\nTelling body language\n\nAfter Lagaan, Aamir was busy shooting for Dil Chahta Hai, which co-starred Saif Ali KhanÂ andÂ Akshaye Khanna, withÂ Preity ZintaÂ playing Aamirâ€™s love interest. Rumors started flying that Aamir and Preity were indulging in an on set romance. This was certainly not the first time he had been accused of this. Earlier a similar story floated about, linking him with Pooja Bhatt during the filming of Ghulam (1998). Additionally, he had been linked with British journalist Jessica Hines. It was said that the two even moved in together somehow. To her joy, Jessica became pregnant with Aamir`s baby, but Aamir asked her to abort it. When she refused, Aamir broke up with her and distanced himself. She gave birth to a baby boy that she named Jaan. Jessica has raised Jaan as a single mother in London reportedly without any acknowledgment or financial assistance from the father.\n\nClearly, Reena had put up with a lot and forgiven him for his indiscretions in the past. His affair with Preity was the last straw and the married couple separated formally.\n\nâ€œBoth Reena and Aamir have not shared with anyone the issues that broke them up as a couple,Â so I have no idea what went wrong with those two. There was no bickering, no spate of ugly attacks and no filth that was plashed. Without washing their dirty linen in public, they were divorced. When they decided to part ways, they first explained the situation to their children,â€ wrote Renjith.\n\nHowever, Aamir liked being a family man and the security and stability that marriage provides. Things didnâ€™t go so well with him after the separation. He sank into depression. Soon he even lost interest in making films. He isolated himself at home for four years. â€œProbably the most traumatic period has been my divorce â€” not just for me but for everybody involved, I imagine. I canâ€™t think of any other significant low. Emotionally, I was very brittle at that point of time,â€ Aamir admitted.\n\nAs luck would have it, Aamir was producing and starring in a commercial for Coke, which also had Kiran working on the set. The two got a chance to spend timeÂ together. One day while he was feeling very low, Kiran called him up. The call lasted for half an hour and when he hung up, he found himself drawn towards her, because she had managed to cheer him and make him feel better. He knew she was special at that moment, a keeper. â€œSlowly I felt that when I am with her, I am comfortable and happy and open to share anything with her. Actually, we were friends first and then lovers. I felt relaxed after years,â€ he added.\n\nWhen he confided his feelings about Kiran to his sister Nuzhat, she advised him to stay away from her, as he was too damaged at that time to get involved or commit. But Aamir could not control his heart and took their relationship a step further by asking her to move in with him.\n\nSiblings, Junaid & Ira Khan\n\nRenjith added, â€œBoth of them, at that time, were not keen on a long-term relationship. But after a few months of spending time with him, Kiran fell in love, though she did not expect anything serious to come out of such a casual relationship. She confessed, â€˜I felt like oh… this is someone I really want to spend more time with and this is someone I want to know better. But I fell in love with him quite early…â€™ a couple of months of spending time intimately with him, sheÂ was hooked.\n\nAamir shared what he loves about Kiran. â€˜Her energy; itâ€™s a very vibrant and positive energy which I find comforting and healing. She is a very happy person.â€™â€\n\nWhen eventually he did commit to Kiran, the two became inseparable. After Aamir got his childrenâ€™s blessing, the couple married in 2005 in front of their entire families in his Panchgani farmhouse.\n\nOver time Kiran became extremely protective of Aamir and would even defend him and pick fights with anyone who upsets or disturbs his mental equilibrium. She fascinates Aamir with her knowledge of art, music and films. He likes her sense of aesthetic and design, and loves her creative instinct. Kiran finds Aamirâ€™s sensitivity very endearing. His manner is light and teasing with her, making fun of and amusing her, while she fondly calls him â€œChhotte!â€ They keep each other on their toes.\n\nRegarding Aamirâ€™s relationship with his ex, Renjith wrote, â€œEven now he holds her in high regard and the two have a close and amicable relationship. The two have never spoken about the reasons behind their divorce. They filed it by mutual consent and because of â€˜temperamental differencesâ€™, which is apparently a thing in India. There were no issues during their divorce, no fighting, and no disagreements. Reena received full custody of their children, though Aamir retained the right to see his kids three times a week, on alternate weekends and for a portion of the summer and Christmas holidays. He is very involved in both his childrenâ€™s lives and although he speaks rarely about his private life, one gets the impression that he is proud of his children and loves them dearly. Reena didnâ€™t vanish from his life after the divorce. Whilst the two werenâ€™t married anymore, their relationship transformed after the divorce and became one of mutual respect and friendship. Due to their children, they continue to have a close relationship, one that extends to Aamirâ€™s second wife as well, who says nothing but good things about Reena and her step-children.â€\n\nAfter many unfortunate miscarriages, Kiran and Aamir had a son, Azaad Rao Khan, who was born via surrogacy. â€œTheir young son is their pride and joy. Their family is certainly a patchwork family, but it seems to work for everyone involved, including Reena, who is not the ex-wife left behind, but someone, who is still close to her children as well as her ex-husband and his new wife,â€ Renjith added.\n\nYounger brother Faisal Khan\n\nOnce he was happily married, Aamir came back to Bollywood with a vengeance after a four year hiatus with Ketan Mehtaâ€™sÂ Mangal Pandey: The Rising (2005) playing the title role of the real-lifeÂ sepoyÂ and martyr who helped spark theÂ Indian Rebellion of 1857. The film garnered great reviews and was screened at theÂ Cannes Film Festival. Next he starred in Rang De Basanti (2006), one of the yearâ€™s highest-grossing films, which also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English LanguageÂ in the U.K. He co-starred in and produced his directorial debut venture, Taare Zameen Par (2007) in which he plays a teacher who befriends and helps aÂ dyslexicÂ child, a different choice of topic for a Bollywood film. It opened to rave reviews including for his acting. Amongst other awards, Aamir notably received the Filmfare Awards for Best Director and Best Film of 2007, as well as theÂ National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare amongst others. Both Mangal Pandey and Taare Zameen Par were Indiaâ€™s official entries for their respective years at the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Film category. Aamir came to be known as a discerning filmmaker, a cut above the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, Aamirâ€™s younger brother Faisal who was suffering from a serious mental condition suffered from a psychotic breakdown, accusing Aamir of locking him up and went missing for two days in 2007. It became a big story with their father being awarded custody by court order of Faisal. However, Tahir Hussain died of a massive heart attack in 2010. Faisal is said to have recovered enough to have signed a couple of upcoming movies.\n\nSecure in his domestic life, Aamir went from strength to strength with a hat-trick of top Bollywood grossers of all time starting with Ghajini (2008), followed byÂ 3 Idiots, which earned $30 million nationally and $25Â million internationally. In Yash Raj Filmsâ€™ Dhoom 3, in which he is said to have played the most difficult role of his career broke the record set by the previous two in the preceding two years.\n\nThere are many insecurities in the actor`s life. This is the reason Aamir Khanâ€™s family have named Captain Caution. Negative thoughts swirl in his mind. Losing his family members and his loved ones are the biggest fears in his life. Aamir is always cautious about the security of all his loved ones. At the same time, he also has insecurity relating to his work. He thinks that at some point he might lose his job or his creative instinct, but he may Â remain unaware of it or be the last one to know about it. Thus, he takes criticism seriously. Whenever, Aamir hears something about his work, he rectifies it immediately. His family and work have primary importance in his life. However, he never fears losing stardom, according to Renjith.\n\nIn 2008, Aamir also launched his nephewÂ Imran KhanÂ in the filmÂ Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane NaÂ made by his production house. 2011 saw the release of Kiranâ€™s dirctorial debut Dhobi Ghat. The same year, Aamir co-produced English languageÂ Black comedyÂ filmÂ Delhi Belly starring Imran Khan. Aamir himself played an alien inÂ Rajkumar Hiraniâ€™s satirical science fiction dramaÂ PK (2014) opposite Anushka Sharma, and with Sanjay Dutt in a supporting role.Â This became the fourth of his films that became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. Film critic Raja Sen called the film a â€œtriumphâ€¦.Aamir Khan is exceptional inÂ PK,Â creating an irresistibly goofy character.â€ And yet again, for the fifth time, Aamirâ€™s turn as a wrestler inÂ real life sports hero movie Nitesh Tiwariâ€™sÂ Dangal became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. Aamir also won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his portrayal.\n\nJunaid, Ira & Reena Dutta\n\nAamir Khan with his mother performing Hajj\n\nAamir avoids most film award ceremonies and does not readily accept any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Aamir does not attend any Indian film award ceremonies, saying â€œIndian film awards lack credibility… I wonâ€™t attend it either. Apart from theÂ National Film Awards, I donâ€™t see any other award ceremony that I should give value to.â€ He has also famously refused to give his consent for his wax statue to join those of other Bollywood superstars atÂ Madame Tussaudâ€™s.â€\n\nHowever, with other Bollywood heavyweights appearing on their own TV shows, Aamir sought to strengthen his connection with his audience by making his television debut with the social issues talk showÂ Satyamev Jayate. This highly anticipated show made Aamir the highest paid host on Indian TV up till 2012. In her review, Ritu Singh said, â€œAamir Khan deserves applause for bringing up such sensitive issues and presenting them in a hard hitting way. The amount of research Aamir and his team have put into the show is clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issues is covered with great diligence.â€\n\nAn observing Muslim, Aamir performed Hajj with his mother in 2013. Recently, he has turned vegan following his atheist wifeâ€™s example. He believes in a balanced, tolerant, live and let live approach. So when in 2015, Aamir spoke up against intoleranceÂ in India at a newspaper event in New Delhi, saying that he had considered â€œmoving out of India,â€ his words were taken out of context by the Shiv Sena. He was harassed by the party and on social media. A lawsuit was filed against him and Kiran. Many stars spoke out in his support and he was forced to explain that he had no intention to emigrate ever.\n\nAll this time, Reena remained close to his family and is often seen at family occasions, participating both in the happy as well as unhappy moments. It helps that Aamirâ€™s sister and Reenaâ€™s brother, who live in New Jersey, are married to each other. According to Aamir, though his relationship with Reena has undergone a change after the divorce, the bond that he shares with her will never end. He still has a lot of love and respect for her and she will always remain an important part of his life. â€œI really value the 16 years Reena and I spent together. I have the highest respect and love for her. I will always have that,â€ he toldÂ the Hindustan Times.\n\nâ€˜She has immense strength of character and patience. She is a valuable part of my life. Our relationship may have altered, but nothing and no one can take away what we have shared,â€™ he said in an interview to Femina magazine.\n\nKiran also enjoys a wonderful rapport with his children from his first marriage. She praised them in an interview, â€œI love them and they are just lovely kids and I think Reena has done a spectacular job of bringing them up the way she has. They are warm, affectionate, intelligent and grounded kids.â€\n\nAamir Khan with Kiran Rao & son Azad Rao Khan in Meghalaya\n\nAamirâ€™s eldest Junaid, who surprisingly stands at six feet three inches tall towering over his fatherâ€™s more modest five feet five inches, is presently assisting Raj Kumar Hirani in the upcoming movie, Peekay with Aamir and Anushka Sharma in the lead.\n\nAamir has his priorities in order and gives kudos to the women who have supported him along the way and helped make him the man he is. Giving credit where it is due, Aamir Khan said that the three most respected women in his life are his mother, his ex-wife, Reena Dutta and his present wife, Kiran Rao.\n\nThe reigning King & Queen of Bollywood\n\nKing Khan wasnâ€™t born a Prince with blue blood in his veins or a silver spoon in his mouth. He was born in an average family in New Delhi to a Muslim emigre from Pehawar who tried his hand at many business ventures including a small restaurant while housing his family in a succession of rented flats. The baby was named Shahrukh at birth, which was later updated to Shah Rukh when he went into acting. His father, Hindko speaking Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was a pro Mohandas Gandhi supporter and follower of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of the All Indian National Congress, in Peshawar. According to Shah Rukh, his paternal grandfather, Jan Muhammad, was an ethnic Pathan from Afghanistan. However, Shah Rukhâ€™s cousins who still live in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Qissa Khawani Bazaar in Peshawar claim that the family is of Hindko origin from Azad Kashmir, not Pathan, and also contradict the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan. So Khanâ€™s tweet claiming his ethnicity is a mix of â€œhalf Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), some Kashmiri (grandmother)â€ may very well be a partial reinvention of his true ethnicity, perhaps to fit in with the traditional Bollywood Pathan heirarchy.\n\nAfter Partition, Meer moved from Peshawar, now in Pakistan, to the Punjabi refugee neighbourhood of Rajendra Nagar, central Delhi, since he was pro-India. There he married a Hyederabadi girl, Lateef Fatima, in 1959. Their first born was a daughter named Shehnaz Lalarukh, who now lives with Shah Rukh permanently. Shah Rukh spent his primary five years in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the â€˜60s while it was being built. After this, Meer moved his family back to Delhi where the head of the household tragically succumbed to cancer in 1981.\n\nHis parents, Meer Taj Mohammed & Lateef Fatima Khan with elder sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh\n\nBaby Shah Rukh\n\nShah Rukh attended St. Columbaâ€™s School, New Delhi. Because he excelled academically as well as at sports such as hockey and football, he received the schoolâ€™s highest award, the Sword of Honour. More importantly for his future career, he acted in stage plays and was known as a teenager for his imitation of Bollywood actors like Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan and, funnily enough, Mumtaz. Amrita Singh, who became a top Bollywood actress in the â€˜80s, was one the teenage friends with whom he acted.\n\nIn high school\n\nOne evening in 1984, when Shah Rukh was 18, he met 14 year old Gauri Chibber at a party where the boys and girls stood separately. She was the daughter of Punjabi-Brahmin Hindu Colonel Ramesh Chandra and Sarita Chibber, residents of the South Delhi suburb of Panchsheel Park. She attended first the Loreto Convent and then the Delhi Modern School. Boldly, Shah Rukh mustered up his courage and crossed over to the girlsâ€™ side and asked Gauri to dance.\n\nShah Rukh Khan confessed in an interview, â€œI am very shy in my personal life. I had never asked a girl out. I danced with her, she was very good. I asked for her telephone number and she was the first girl with whom I had danced or asked for their number. I felt that she is the one for me, as she had not said â€˜noâ€™ to me up till now.â€ He promptly asked her for a date the next day to have a soda. She assented and soon they started dating regularly.\n\nAt their wedding\n\nGauri was not entirely happy with Shah Rukhâ€™s decision to join Bollywood. She even secretly wished his films would flop so they could return to Delhi where he could work for her father. â€œWhen I went to become an actor, she didnâ€™t like it, because actors have such a reputation and also ours was an inter-religion marriage,â€ SRK said on The Anupam Kher ShowÂ\n\nMeanwhile, Shah Rukh got his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics from Hansraj College in 1988, simultaneously studying at Delhiâ€™s Theatre Action Group (TAG) under the mentorship of renowned theatre director Barry John. Gauri also got her Bachelorâ€™s degree in History from Lady Shri Ram College and then took a six months course in fashion design and tailoring from the National Institute of Fashion Technology to join her fatherâ€™s garment business.\n\nShah Rukh began his professional acting career in the late â€˜80s by appearing in several television series, in which he started making a name for himself as critics compared his look and acting style with that of Dilip Kumar, the film thespian. But where Gauri was concerned, Shah Rukh was an insecure and possessive boyfriend who did not even like her keeping her hair open, let alone talking to other boys. He said in his defense, â€œI donâ€™t know whether I am a nut but I am very intense about my love for Gauri. Sheâ€™s a part of me.â€\n\nHowever, Gauri got fed up with this attitude. Only her mother knew of her relationship with a Muslim boy, that too a struggling actor, as she was too scared to tell her father. So when she was invited by friends to a trip to Mumbai, she left without even telling him. Suddenly, Shah Rukh felt abandoned by her and realized he didnâ€™t want to let go. He told his mother about Gauri and his mother asked him to go and search for her. Armed with INR 10,000, Shah Rukh drove to Mumbai in his trusty, old Fiat in search of his errant girlfriend with no idea of her exact whereabouts. After much searching, in true filmi fashion, he headed to the beach knowing she would definitely visit there. There, he spied her and ran towards her. The moment the two met, they flung themselves upon each other in an embrace and started crying, realising the depth of their love.\n\nShah Rukh recalled in a TV interview, â€œI had a Fiat back then and I was dropping her home. That is when I asked her if she will marry me and went off, I didnâ€™t even wait for her to say â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜no.â€™â€\n\nGauri added, â€œmy parents were obviously not for it because we were so young and then to take a decision to get married to a person who was going to join films and also from a different religion.â€\n\nBut her brother supported her decision after warning Shah Rukh, â€œDonâ€™t do anything hanky panky with my sister!â€Â 1991 turned out to be an eventful year in his life. Shah Rukhâ€™s mother died that year from complications from diabetes. Then, in April, he moved from Delhi to Mumbai and was signed by Hema Malini for the film Dil Aashana Hai that she produced and directed opposite Divya Bharti, in addition to signing three more films. Alone and back in New Delhi, his sister Shahnaz sank into depression. Shah Rukh and Gauri remained in touch, but found the long distance relationship hard. Gauri decided that either they should get married or break up for good. After much cajoling, she finally convinced her strict Hindu, vegetarian father to let her marry Muslim boy Shah Rukh and managed to get his blessing. They got married on 25th October, 1991 in a Hindu ceremony.\n\nShah Rukh Khan bought his mumbai mansion, Mannat, for just INR 15 crores (US$2.5 million) in 1995. a tourist landmark, itâ€™s now reportedly worth a whopping INR 2000 crores (US $333 million). He was also gifted one of the most expensive homes in Dubai, a villa on Palm Jumeirah, worth US$65 million. In addition, He also owns a palatial bungalow in Delhi and a GBÂ£20 million flat near the Dorchester on Park lane, mayfair, London. The second richest movie star in the world, SRK is worth…wait for it…$600 million\n\nShah Rukh reminisced on fellow actor Anupam Kherâ€™s TV chat show, â€œI started shooting in June and in October we got married. Our honeymoon was on the sets of Dil Aashana Hai.â€ The young couple set up home in a small, rented apartment in Mumbai.\n\nShah Rukhâ€™s debut film turned out to be Deewana, releasing in June 1992, in which he was a supporting actor. The filmâ€™s leads were Rishi Kapoor and Divya Bharti. It became the second highest grossing film of the year, launching his film career. He was awarded the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance. The same year, he also starred in Chamatkar and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman opposite Juhi Chawla, a hit pairing. The roles he played were similar in that they were full of energy and enthusiasm. Film critic Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis wrote that Shah Rukh brought a new kind of acting â€œsliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy … visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.â€\n\nThe next year, he played villainous anti-hero roles in the hits, Darr, in which he plays an obsessive lover, and Baazigar, in which he plays a murderer. In Yash Chopraâ€™s Darr, which was the first of his many collaborations with the filmmaker and his company Yash Raj Films, Shah Rukhâ€™s stammering portrayal and the use of the phrase â€œI love you, K-k-k-Kiranâ€ became memorable and popular with audiences. He received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, for this role. In Baazigar, Shah Rukh plays an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocking Indian audiences and turning the standard Bollywood film formula on its head. In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character â€œthe consummate anti-hero.â€ Cast for the first time opposite newcomer Kajol, he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The Shah Rukh-Kajol pairing has been so successful over the years, that two decades plus later, they are still playing the leads in films together. They have starred in nine films together to date.\n\nWith his star in the rise, in 1995 Shah Rukh starred in a total of seven films, the first of which was Rakesh Roshanâ€™s melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.\n\nAryan has dated Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s granddaughter Â Navya Naveli Nanda\n\nThe highest grossing film of the year and one of the most successful Indian films of all time is the romcom, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) opposite Kajol. Written and directed by Aditya Chopra, Yashâ€™s son and later husband of actress Rani Mukherjee, the filmâ€™s plot revolves around two young non-resident Indians (NRIs), who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Though Shah Rukh was initially hesitant to portray the role of a lover, the audience loved him in this film as a â€œromantic heroâ€ so much that it became the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema. It won a record of 10 Filmfare Awards, the most for a single film at that time, including the second of Shah Rukhâ€™s Best Actor Awards, as well as winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack also became one of the most popular albums of the â€˜90s. Film critic Raja Sen said, â€œKhan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. Heâ€™s cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.â€\n\nAfter Gauriâ€™s brief foray into show business with her hosting gig on weekly Hindi music countdown show, Oye, for MTV India behind her and with Shah Rukhâ€™s star status secure, the couple decided it was finally time for them to start a family and in 1997 their son Aryan was born.\n\nAryan, now 19, is a mini-me of his famous father. He graduated from the prestigious Sevenoaks School, Kent, half an hour from London. In his own right, he has won the Maharashtra Taekwondo competition in 2010 and was presented with the black belt, the highest achievement level in the martial arts. He is also a budding actor. While Shah Rukh won for best dubbing voice male animation, for Hum Lajawab Hai, the dubbed Hindi version of the Oscar winning cartoon feature movie The Incredibles, Aryan won the award for best dubbing child voice artist male for it in the childrenâ€™s category. He is also rumored to have dated Amitabh Bachchanâ€™s granddaughter Navya Naveli Nanda. Aryan is currently enrolled in the University of Southern California where he is studying filmmaking. His godfather is fittingly Karan Johar.\n\nRed hot in an Herve Leger bandage dress, Suhana canâ€™t wait to be a Bollywood star\n\nSuhana in a Manish Malhotra ghagra choli attending the Bachchan’s Diwali bash\n\nShah Rukhâ€™s next big blockbuster was the song and dance vehicle Dil To Pagal Hai (1997) with Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor, the highest grossing Indian film of the year worldwide, followed next year by Karan Joharâ€™s directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) Shah Rukhâ€™s fourth film opposite Kajol and a coming of age romcom drama. The third highest-grossing Indian film of the year, itâ€™s the first Bollywood film to enter the UK cinema top ten.\n\nIn 2000, the couple had their daughter Suhana. Now 16 and enrolled at Dirubhai Ambani International School, she is a pint sized fashionista, standing at 5â€™2â€, a footballer, playing football tournaments for her school, and even captaining the U-14 team. She loves dancing, and performed in the Pop video of Shiamak Dawarâ€™s Summer Funk show. She also enjoys writing, winning an award at Katha national story writing competition. Shah Rukh has proudly stated in many interviews that Suhana is desperately waiting to finish her studies and join films. She too has her fatherâ€™s looks, especially his distinctive nose. Shah Rukh plans to send her to the U.S. for college to study acting.\n\nNext Shah Rukh starred opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Aditya Chopraâ€™s Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Joharâ€™s family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), which SRK cites as a turning point in his career, as he held his own against the veteran actor who stars in both films. Amitabhâ€™s role in both is that of an authoritarian figure, the movie shows ideological struggles between the two men. Shah Rukh was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein, while Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, also starring Kajol remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.\n\n2001 brought a reversal of fortune for SRK. Shah Rukhâ€™s production company Dreamz Unlimited produced Santosh Sivanâ€™s historical epic Asoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka, starring Shah Rukh in the titular role. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival, but despite opening with much fanfare, it performed poorly at the box office. So heavy was the loss incurred that Shah Rukh was forced to close srkworld.com. Then in December, Shah Rukh suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsiâ€™s Shakti: The Power. He was diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, which caused him severe pain during shooting. His condition worsened to the point that he finally had to undergo the complicated anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London in 2003. After this, Shah Rukh has reduced his workload and limited the number of film roles he accepts per year.\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansaliâ€™s remake of period romantic tragedy Devdas (2002), the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time, starred Shah Rukh in the title role of a rebellious and love lorne alcoholic opposite Ashwariya Rai and Madhuri Dixit. The film became an instant classic and earned numerous awards including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Shah Rukh and even a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.\n\nÂ â€œThat she is stylish, enigmatic, and poised is known, but at the shoot we saw another side of her. Even in the frames she shares with Shah Rukh, she holds her own impressivelyâ€ wrote Priya Tanna, editor of Vogue India\n\nKaran Joharâ€™s Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama set in New York City, starring Shah Rukh, Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year. His tear jerker portrayal of a man with a fatal heart disease won over the sentimental audience and critics alike. In the 2003 edition of the Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, it was written that Shah Rukh â€œdefied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero.â€\n\nThen, conflict broke out between Shah Rukh, Juhi Chawla and Aziz Mirza, all partners in Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi in their 2003 production of Chalte Chalte instead of the much younger Rani Mukherjee, and they parted ways, despite the filmâ€™s success. Dreamz Unlimited was disbanded and gave birth to Red Chillies Entertainment with Gauri emerging as producer (uptill now the production house has released nine films). In the companyâ€™s first production, he starred in choreographer Farah Khanâ€™s directorial debut, the action comedy masala film Main Hoon Na opposite Sushmita Sen, a fictionalised account of Indiaâ€“Pakistan relations. The film is the story of Indian army Major who becomes embroiled in the events to ensure that â€œProject Milap,â€ the releasing of civilian captives on either side of the border of India and Pakistan, can take place as a sign of trust and peace between the two nations. Perhaps because of his familial links with Pakistan, the film consciously moves away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as a villainous country and shows the Indo-Pakistani conflict from a neutral point of view. In Yash Chopraâ€™s romance, Veer-Zaara, Shah Rukh plays an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman, played by Preity Zinta. The film, screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise, was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, while Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner. So Shah Rukh was ruling the box office with both the highest and second highest grosser. Is it any surprise then that he became the reigning King of Bollywood?\n\nAbRam was born via surrogacy\n\nShah Rukhâ€™s third collaboration with Karan Johar was the romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), the story of two unhappily married people in New York City who begin an extramarital affair. The film, featuring an ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukherji and Kirron Kher, was Indiaâ€™s highest-grossing film in the overseas market. His role in this as well as in Don, a remake, earned him Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards, though critics negatively compared his portrayal to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.\n\nShah Rukh Khan bought his mumbai mansion, Mannat, for just INR 15 crores (US$2.5 million) in 1995. a tourist landmark, itâ€™s now reportedly worth a whopping INR 2000 crores (US $333 million). He was also gifted one of the most expensive homes in Dubai, a villa on Palm Jumeirah, worth US$65 million. In addition, He also owns a palatial bungalow in Delhi and a GBÂ£20 million flat near the Dorchester on Park lane, mayfair, London. The second richest movie star in the world, SRK is worth…wait for it…$600 million\n\nIn 2007, Shah Rukh revisited his hockey skills for his portrayal of a disgraced hockey player who coaches the Indian womenâ€™s national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Filmsâ€™ semi-fictional Chak De! India. Critic Bhaichand Patel stated that Shah Rukh essentially portrayed himself as a â€œcosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim.â€ For this, he won another Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN critiqued that his performance was â€œwithout any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks,â€ portraying the character â€œlike a real flesh-and-blood human being.â€ Filmfare magazine included his performance in their 2010 issue of the Top 80 Iconic Performances.\n\nShah Rukh starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Deepika Padukone, in her debut role, in Farah Khanâ€™s reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, in which he plays â€˜70s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007. Khalid Mohammed, film critic for Hindustan Times wrote, â€œthe enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature styleâ€”spontaneous and intuitively intelligent.â€\n\nReceiving his honorary degree from University of Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nIn 2008, Shah Rukh bought ownership rights for the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta for USD 75 million. The teamâ€™s performance improved over time, and they finally became the champions in 2012 and 2014. To enhance the teamâ€™s brand, Shah Rukh himself performed at the opening ceremony of the 2011 season, dancing to Tamil songs. In 2013, he entertained the crowd alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull at the cricket staduim.\n\nGauri also remained in the spotlight by appearing in a TV commercial for the home furnishings brand Dâ€™decor along with Shah Rukh in 2013. The next year, the couple walked the ramp together for Karan Joharâ€™s debut fashion sown at the HDIL India Couture Week 2009.\n\nCelebrating Kolkata Knight’s IPL win with Shoaib Akhtar\n\nMy Name Is Khan (2010), Shah Rukhâ€™s fourth successful collaboration with Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol, is a true story about the prejudice against Islam in the U.S. after the 11 September attacks. His character is a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome that sets out on a journey across America to meet the countryâ€™s president. Shah Rukh spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equaling Dilip Kumarâ€™s record of most wins in the category. Jay Wiesenberger wrote in Variety how Khan portrayed the Aspergerâ€™s sufferer with â€œaverted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized textsâ€, believing it to have been a â€œstandout performance sure to receive the Autism Societyâ€™s gold seal of approval.â€\n\nFurthermore, over the years, Shah Rukh has systematically played roles that â€œpresent NRI identity in global Bollywood,â€ earning him a billion fans the world over. â€\n\nShah Rukh and Gauriâ€™s lavish neo classical Bandra bungalow, Mannat has been done up by Gauri in a myriad of styles. While the formal entertaining area of drawing and dining rooms are Louis XIV inspired with much use of gilt and heavy, ornate curtains, the lounge has exposed brickwork displaying Art. You can tell that for better or for worse no expense has been spared and the house is meant to impress the viewer. In the home, notably the Quran can be seen lying next to the statues of the Hindu deities.\n\nEmboldened by her questionable success in doing up her own splendid home, in 2010 Gauri partnered with Hrithik Roshanâ€™s ex-wife Susanne Khan to design exclusive interior projects. Their first project was a 60,000 square foot mansion Vadodara. In 2012, they launched a line of furniture at Susanneâ€™s home store in Mumbai â€“ The Charcoal Project. In an interview with Vogue India, she said that she chose interior design because of her interest in art, â€œI started off as an artist in school with various sketches. I continued that as a hobby for many years, and I think that is where my designs come from.â€\n\nShah Rukhâ€™s third child AbRam was born in 2013 via surrogacy, since Gauri was well over 40 by this time. The birth mother is not known and, to quell public curiosity, Shah Rukh is most protective of this child who was born premature and spent a lot of time in the hospital after birth. All three kids have been brought up practicing both their parentâ€™s religions.\n\nAfter this, SRK starred in the hits Chennai Express (2013) Happy New Year (2014), his own production Dilwale (2015) yet again opposite Kajol, and Fan (2016) in which his grand mansion Mannat appears. Raees (2017) is this yearâ€™s upcoming release opposite the charming Mahira Khan. He has appeared in more than 80 Bollywood films to date, and won 14 Filmfare Awards. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honored him with the Padma Shri, and the Government of France awarded him both the Ordre des Arts et des Letters and the LÃ©gion dâ€™honneur. He also has countless endorsement deals, earning him the nickname, Brand SRK. His philanthropic efforts include health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCOâ€™s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of childrenâ€™s education. In 2015, he received an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nShah Rukh is one of the wealthiest celebrities in India, topping the Forbes Indiaâ€™s Celebrity 100 List in 2012, 2013 and 2015, his wealth being estimated at US$600 million. He owns several properties in India and abroad, including a GBÂ£20 million apartment in central London, and a villa on the Palm, Jumeirah in Dubai. He was named by Newsweek as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008. His wax statue is at six of the Madame Tussaudâ€™s museums around the world.\n\nSpeaking of his success, Shah Rukh said in an interview, â€œSuch great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldnâ€™t have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that thereâ€™s this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that … Iâ€™ll do it, I am an actor. But I canâ€™t start believing in this myth.â€\n\nâ€œWe have known each other for so long, we have surpassed a stage,â€ he said regarding his relationship with Gauri on Koffee with Karan. â€œOne of the stages that we have passed is that we donâ€™t need to sit under a moonlit night. I think just passing each other across from the bedroom to the living room is romantic. Love is in the air. We have wonderful children who are a proof that we have a wild, loud, screaming romance going on in the house all day long.â€\n\nThey sure seem like a rock solid couple at least outwardly despite their starry life with its myriad of hazards and pitfalls.\n\nBy Mahlia Lone\n\nYoung, rich, famous, good looking, and in loveâ€¦life is goodÂ\n\nBradford bad boy/boy bander, Zayn Malik has countless nubile young female fans the world over, but his number one fan would have to be his girlfriend, supermodel and Victoria Secret Angel, Gigi Hadid. In December, he even proposed to her, and while she has asked him for time before she even begins contemplating settling down, letâ€™s look back at their fast paced year long romance.\n\nZain Javad Malik was born on 12th January 1993 in Bradford, Yorkshire, to working class Pakistani-British Yaser Malik and his English/Irish wife Tricia, who converted to Islam upon their marriage. The couple also has three daughters: Doniya, Waliyha and Safaa. All four have declared themselvesÂ Muslim, speak Urdu and can read Arabic.\n\nDespite the band’s massive popularity, Zayn became the target of anti-Muslim slurs, forcing him to delete his Twitter account in 2012. During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, he posted “#FreePalestine” on Twitter, for which he received condemnation and death threats. Now he wisely keeps his political views private\n\nZain grew up listening to his fatherâ€™sÂ urban musicÂ collection ofÂ R&B,Â hip hop and reggae, as well asÂ Bollywood songs. As a teenager, he took performing arts courses and appeared in school productions.Â He also boxed at varsity level and enjoyed writing, which is why he wanted to pursue anÂ EnglishÂ degree atÂ university.\n\nIn 2010, he changed the spelling of his name to the more contemporary sounding Zayn and auditioned as a solo artist for the British television music competitionÂ The X Factor. Though he was eliminated as a solo singer, he came back as part of the boy band One Direction withÂ Harry Styles,Â Niall Horan, Liam Payne, andÂ Louis Tomlinson. Zaynâ€™s wideÂ tenorÂ vocal range with his beltingÂ andÂ falsettoÂ singing techniques ensured that he hit the high notes and, thus, became the bandâ€™s strongest singer. The pretty boy group quickly became popular all over the UK and finished in third place. Seeing this, the showâ€™s executive producer Simon Cowell contracted them to a Â£2 million deal atÂ his label Syco Records. While in North America, the band signed on withÂ Columbia Records.\n\nOne Direction gained immense popularity amongst female tweens. Their book, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), licensed by the band, released in February 2011, toppedÂ The Sunday Timesâ€™Â Best Seller list. Simultaneously, the boy band went on The X FactorÂ Live Tour in the UK performing for 500,000 people in total. At the end of the year, they dropped their debut studio albumÂ Up All Night, which topped the charts in 16 countries. The lead single What Makes You Beautiful reached number one in theÂ UKÂ and number four in theÂ US; it went platinum four and six times in the US and Australia, respectively. After a year, they released their second studio album Take Me Home, which sold 540,000 copies in its first week in the US and went on to the number one position in 35 countries. The albumâ€™s lead single Live While Weâ€™re Young became One Directionâ€™s highest ranking song in many countries and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist at the time. When One Directionâ€™s third studio album, 2013â€™sÂ Midnight Memoriesâ€™ debuted on BillboardÂ 200 they became the first band ever to have their first three albums all debut atop theÂ BillboardÂ 200. With their fourth album, aptly entitledÂ Four, they had a record of four consecutive number one albums. By March 2015, the band had sold more than 50 million records globally.\n\nDespite this tremendous global success, after five years of being a part of the band that made him famous, Zayn quit on 25th March 2015, citing stress. He was feeling burnt out and perpetually exposed. He said he wanted to live as a â€œnormal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.â€ He denied rumors of any trouble with the other members, explaining that they were understanding and supportive of his decision.\n\nIn December ’16, Zayn reportedly popped the question, but Gigi replied that she is not ready to settle down and asked for more time. She’s also hesitant and wants to proceed with caution after her mother’s two messy divorces\n\nâ€œHe was one of the more accomplished vocalists of the group, exhibiting the widest range. He mostly inhabited a silvery, full-bodied tenor, similar to but more sharp and precise than Harry Stylesâ€™ smoky warble,â€ wrote Brad Nelson inÂ The Guardian, adding that his departure would leave â€œa void of vocal agility.â€\n\nZayn had started dating Perrie Edwards in May 2012. She came from a similar background, was exactly the same age and was also discovered in the same way. She is a member of the all girl band Little Mix that was also discovered on The X Factor. In fact, Little Mix is the only band to ever have won on the show. The couple got engaged after a couple of years together. Scandal broke out in mid 2015 when an English fan claimed in the tabloids to have hooked up with Zayn when his band was on tour in Thailand. She met him and his band mates when they were partying at a nightclub in Patong, Bangkok. Though Perrie stuck by him through the scandal and he promptly returned to London to be at her side, clearly his heart was no longer in the relationship.\n\nIn his autobiography, entitledÂ Zayn, he writes when he decided to leaveÂ One Direction: â€œIt was March 2015. I had been in a bad place for a while and I didnâ€™t see myself getting out of it unless I made a change. My relationship with my fiancÃ©e, Perrie, was breaking down. To make matters worse, there were so many crazy stories flying around in the newspapers about us, and it felt like such an invasion of privacy, it made me just want to disappear for a while.â€\n\nDespite taking time off his music to work on the relationship, Zayn couldnâ€™t make it work. Perrie became insecure and controlling and finally Zayn sent her a break up text in August 2015. In Little Mixâ€™sÂ Â newÂ book Our World, Perrie reveals, â€œIt was horrible, the worst time in my life. A four-year relationship, two year engagement ended by a simple text message. Just like that.â€\n\nHis good looks, naughty, juvenile peccadilloes, cheating scandal, body covered tattoo graffiti, including Perrieâ€™s image that he subsequently got altered, trendy hairstyles and last but not least his singing and songwriting talent had garnered Zayn a substantial fan following.Â BillboardÂ editor Joe Lynch described him as â€œthe quiet one in the group, never the one to grab the spotlight during interviews. He typically saved his words for the songs, not for media sound bytes.â€ And after much speculation regardingÂ his career as a solo artist, Zayn signed a solo recording contract withÂ RCA RecordsÂ in 2015. That year he also met Gigi Hadid.\n\nJelena NouraÂ Hadid, known popularly as Gigi, was born on April 23rd 1995 to a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate developer Mohamed Hadid and his model wife Yolanda. After her, came her younger siblings who are also models now, Bella and Anwar.\n\nMohamed Hadid is a Jordanian-American who was born in Nazareth and is of Palestinian parentage. On his motherâ€™s side, he can trace back his ancestry to Dasher Al Omer, Prince of Nazareth and Sheikh of Galilee, the mid-18th century Arab ruler of northernÂ Palestine who withstood the might of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHadid immigrated to the U.S. to make his fortune and started out by restoring and reselling classic cars in theÂ GeorgetownÂ neighborhood ofÂ Washington, D.C. He then moved to a Greek island where he opened a nightclub. The club flourished and with the profits, he started developing real estate in the U.S. In the â€˜80s, he bought theÂ Ritz-CarltonÂ hotels in NYC and D.C. forÂ US$150 million; he also famously outmaneuveredÂ Donald TrumpÂ to buy the Ritz property in Aspen, Colorado; then he focused on Beverly Hills residential property, developing a luxurious mansion Le Belvedere that sold for $50Â million in 2010; in 2012, he developed Le Palais, a 48,000-square-foot limestone fronted mansion built on an acre plot next to theÂ Beverly Hills Hotel, currently listed for sale at $58Â million.\n\nA competitive man with a type A personality, at the age of 43 on the encouragement of his friend Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber, Hadid competed inÂ speed skiingÂ at theÂ 1992 Winter Olympics, representingÂ Jordan. Not only was he the only member of the Jordanian delegation, but he also remains the only person to have represented the country in theÂ Winter Olympics to date.\n\nThough Hadid does not consider himself a devout Muslim,Â he has abstained from drinking alcohol. However, this did not stop him from investing in a 5,000-bottle wine cellar, including some from his own Beverly Hills winery that he runs as a business venture.\n\nBorn Yolanda van den Herik, Gigiâ€™s Dutch mother herself worked as a Ford model for fifteen years.Â In 1994, she quit modeling when she married the divorced millionaire businessman Mohamed, sixteen years her senior who had two daughters, Alana and Marielle, from his previous marriage to an American. After having her children, Yolanda gained fame on the reality show Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, on which her good looking progeny regularly appeared, propelling their own modeling careers. Yolanda divorced Hadid in 2010 and married musician, composer and producer David Foster, who himself already had five daughters, but the marriage only lasted five years due to her ongoing battle with Lyme disease. After her second divorce, she changed her last name back to Hadid to match the name of her famous children.\n\nNow Gigi was a really pretty child and growing up in a Beverly Hills mansion with well connected parents who were proud of her looks, she had been modeling since age two forÂ Paul Marcianoâ€™sÂ brand Baby GUESS. She stopped to concentrate on school plus get through the awkward stage and, in 2011, went back to work for GUESS as a teen model. Â In 2013, she graduated fromÂ Malibu High SchoolÂ where she had been captain of the varsity volleyball team as well as a competitive horseback rider. She moved to NYC to model and attend The New School, where she started studying criminal psychology. But her modeling career took off and she quit college and signed withÂ IMG ModelsÂ working full time. She made her New York Fashion Week debut in February 2014. By the end of the next year, Gigi had made it, shooting to the Top 50 Models ranking at Models.com. She has graced magazine covers such as those of VogueÂ (U.S.,Â Paris,Â Italy,Â Britain, Japan, Spain, Australia, Brazil, the, Germany, Italy, China),Â Allure,Â W MagazineÂ andÂ Teen VogueÂ as well asÂ WSJÂ Magazine, ElleÂ Canada,Â DazedÂ andÂ Harperâ€™s BazaarÂ (USA, Malaysia) among many others. By May â€˜15, Gigi had walked for such premiere designers as:Â Marc Jacobs,Â Chanel,Â Michael Kors,Â Jean Paul Gaultier, andÂ Max Mara. In December, Gigiâ€™s dream of becoming a Victoria Secret model came true when she walked in her first Victoriaâ€™s Secret Fashion Show along with her bff Kendall Jenner, of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. For the lingerie show, she trains and body sculpts by boxing.\n\nFor two years, from 2013 to 2015, Gigi dated musician Cody Simpson and also appeared in the music video of his song Surfboard. Following their split, she dated Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers for five months. Clearly, she liked pop stars. Gigi, along with fellow models Kendall and Hailey Baldwin, daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin of Hollywoodâ€™s Baldwin brothers, became American celebrity It girls. Gigi also became a part of American pop star Taylor Swiftâ€™s girl squad. She appeared in Swiftâ€™s Bad Blood video and also in Taylorâ€™s then boyfriend Calvin Harrisâ€™ video How Deep Is Your Love.\n\nBy November, Gigi was dating Zayn. They announced their fledgling relationship via her Instagram account when she posted a photo of them holding hands together. In an interview with Sirius XMâ€™s The Morning Mash Up, Zayn talked about the beginning of his relationship with Gigi: â€œYeah, I just asked her out. It was pretty straight up. I just asked her if she wanted to go out. I was in New Yorkâ€¦We met and we spoke, and we went on a date.â€\n\nâ€œWe were both talking about the fact that weâ€™d never actually been on a first date until each other,â€ Gigi toldÂ a reporter of the TV show Entertainment Tonight. â€œI met him once before and he is obviously so gorgeous, but really the way we could have conversations and kind of justâ€¦weâ€™re really interested in the same things, so it was really easy. So that was amazing.â€\n\nOn the 12th of January â€™16, Gigi celebrated her boyfriendâ€™s 23rd birthday by gifting him a customized Z pendant. At the end of the month, fans got to see their chemistry for themselves with their hot makeout scene in his Pillowtalk video.Â When asked during a radio interview if it was easier to makeout with his girlfriend, he replied in the affirmative, confirming their relationship and, hence, a new power couple was formed.\n\nZaynâ€™s debut studio albumÂ Mind of MineÂ released in March 2016. The album and its lead single, Pillowtalk reached number one in several countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden, with Zayn becoming the first British male artist to debut atÂ number one in both the UK and USÂ with his debut single and debut album. He debuted atop the USÂ BillboardÂ 200Â earning 157,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with 112,000 coming from pure album sales.Â Zayn also topped theÂ BillboardÂ Artist 100Â chart, replacingÂ Justin BieberÂ at his peakÂ and surpassing One Directionâ€™s number-two peak on the chart. He had proved his naysayers wrong, those who had doubted his ability to succeed on his own, just like Justin Timberlake did after leaving NSYNC. Philanthropically minded, he is also an official ambassador of theÂ British Asian TrustÂ charity group, contributing to improving the lives of disadvantaged people living inÂ South Asia.\n\nIn April, the genetically blessed couple featured in a romantic spread for Vogue, ala Kim and Kanye West. They also made a sensational red carpet debut at the Met Gala looking very much loved up.\n\nBut then in June came news that left fans reeling. Horror of horrors, they had broken up after an explosive fight on her birthday. Apparently, they had been fighting quite a bit recently, and so decided to take a time out. Stress had taken its toll on Zaynâ€™s fragile nerves. Anxiety had crippled him and he had to pull out of concert appearances. He even cancelled his performance at Londonâ€™s Capital Summertime Ball, saying he was â€œsuffering the worst anxiety of my career.â€\n\nE! channel reported a source saying, â€œThey got through a rough patch that Zayn was facing personally and it started to put a dark cloud on their relationship. Gigi was there for him when he needed her the most and that brought them closer than ever.â€ Gigi and Zayn stayed in touch through this period and she played the role of a supportive friend. He began relying on her more and more and she was determined to be his rock.\n\nGigi tweeted her support for him, â€œZ â€“ Iâ€™ve seen the battles you go through and the way you fight to get to a place that allows you to get up there for your fans. Your bravery in those times makes me proud, but your honesty last night proved what youâ€™re all about, being real â€¦ Your talent and good heart will never lead you wrong. Love you and so proud of you always.â€\n\nAfter they got back together, they took a romantic trip to Tahiti, which the paparazzi managed to photograph as the couple snoozed on the beach and kayaked together like regular beach goers.\n\nWhen in September, she was pounced on by a prankster in Milan and picked up from behind, she elbowed him ferociously and said he should be thankful her boyfriend wasnâ€™t there or he would have really been in trouble!\n\nThe show must go on and indeed her shows did.Â Gigi walked for:Â Versace, Chanel,Â Elie Saab,Â Fendi,Â Marc Jacobs,Â Anna Sui,Â Miu Miu,Â Balmain,Â Diane Von Furstenberg,Â Tommy Hilfiger,Â Fenty x Puma,Â Isabel Marant, andÂ Giambattista Valli during 2016 despite the drama in her personal life. She signed lucrative endorsement deals, becoming the global brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger, fronting many of the brandâ€™s campaigns plus launching her own clothing line Gigi by Tommy Hilfiger; similarly, she put out a boot collection for Stuart Weitzman, the Gigi Boot and she became Reebokâ€™s brand ambassador.Â (Incidentally, Zayn has also just come out with a boot collection this year for Giuseppe Zanotti.)\n\nTwo of Gigiâ€™s most high profile gigs of the year were theÂ 2016 iHeartRadio Much Music Video AwardsÂ and the American Music Awards both of which she hosted, injecting her youth, beauty and sex appeal into the proceedings. For the first she received favourable reviews but her comedy skits in the second were panned by viewers. She followed this up with getting her VS wings at this yearâ€™s show where she was joined by younger sister, Bella. To cap it all off at the end of the year, Gigi won the award for International Model of the Year at theÂ British Fashion Awards, presented to her byÂ Donatella Versace, beating out all the other top supermodels, like Cara Delevingne and Kendall.\n\nOn the down side, Gigi was diagnosed withÂ Hashimotoâ€™s disease, anÂ autoimmune disease involving the thyroid. In time, sufferers develop goiters, gain weight and may even develop thyroid lymphoma. Though incurable at the moment and degenerative, the disease can be managed with medication.\n\nGigiâ€™s growing stature as a model can be gauged by the fact that out of all the models she has the highest number of Instagram followersâ€”26 million by the end of 2016, over only 10 million the year before. Zaynâ€™s social media followers acrossÂ Twitter,Â Instagram,Â Facebook,Â YouTubeÂ andÂ Pandora are an eye-watering 47 million. Moreover, he was voted the â€œWorldâ€™s Sexiest Asian Manâ€ inÂ Eastern Eyeâ€™s worldwide poll yet again.Â Together they make quite a formidable power couple at such a young age. However, they are quite a low key couple in private, preferring to stay in and cook than party the town red. â€œHe makes a brilliant curry. Butter chicken is his signature dish,â€ Gigi said in an interview to ES magazine.\n\nAsked in an interview what makes their relationship tick, Zayn said: â€œSheâ€™s super intelligent. I think thatâ€™s why it works so well. She knows how to carry herself. Sheâ€™s quite classy and that. Sheâ€™s not, like, arrogant in any way, sheâ€™s confident. She carries it well. Sheâ€™s cool. And we do the same type of job, so we get that with each other.â€\n\nGigi added, â€œI would say his brain. For the first time, we are both in a relationship where we have similar interests outside of work, and that is really important. We cook a lot together and do art together, and weâ€™re each otherâ€™s best friends. We both feel we can talk about anything and learn a lot from each other.â€\n\nIn December â€™16, Zayn reportedly popped the question, but Gigi replied that she is not ready to settle down and asked for more time. Sheâ€™s also hesitant and wants to proceed with caution after her motherâ€™s two messy divorces.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mirror reported a source saying, â€œZayn and Gigi have moved in together in LA and heâ€™s busy furnishing and buying paintings to change it up and make it more of a coupleâ€™s pad. They cherish every moment together and make sure theyâ€™re never apart for longer than 10 days so it made sense for her to move in officially. The couple also share Gigiâ€™s New York apartment when they are on the East coast and couldnâ€™t be happierâ€¦ Zayn prefers a quiet night with Gigi than showbiz parties so itâ€™s important she feels comfortable.â€\n\nHereâ€™s wishing the couple good luck. We donâ€™t know if they will be together for the rest of their lives, but for however long it lasts, at least they bring out the best in each other and make each other feel secure.\n\nâ€œZayn sees how much Gigi is there for him,â€ said a source close to the couple. â€œTheyâ€™re mutually passionately in love.â€ It doesnâ€™t get much better than that.\n\nA MEETING OF THE MINDS\n\nBy Mahlia Lone\n\nâ€œMy childhood was spent in a commune,â€ Shabana Azmi, the renowned Indian actress, recounted in an interview. â€œMy entry into this world â€” on September 18, 1950 in Hyderabad â€” was thanks to a blind dai (midwife). Soon, my family shifted to a semi-commune at Red Flag Hall in Bombay. My father Kaifi Azmi, a Communist Party of India (CPI) member, shared a flat with comrades such as Ali Sardar Jafri and Sawantji. We had a room each and a bal-cony converted into a kitchen. For eight years, I grew up amid CPI meetings. It was an unusual childhood: Each couple, includ-ing my parents, would take turns to look after all the children of the families who lived together. We celebrated all major festi-vals together â€” be it Holi, Diwali, Eid, Xmas. My education was varied. Due to our meagre income, I went to an Urdu-medium school, and then a municipal school. When I got zero in all subjects, Abba sent me to Queen Maryâ€™s, where the fees were a princely Rs. 30. As English-speak-ing parents were a pre-requisite for admission, Sardar Jaffreyâ€™s wife Sultana became my mother Shaukat; Munish Narayan Saxena pretended to be Kaifi Azmi!\n\nMy parents worked hard to give us a better life: Abba gave all his earnings to his party and was left with Rs. 40 each month. This was when my mother started working â€”first as an announcer on AIR and then with the Indian Peopleâ€™s Theatre Association (IPTA). Later, she joined Prithvi Theatres. Life improved after my father wrote the film Buzdil, for which he was paid Rs. 500. My father was different other fathers who left for the office in the mornings. My kurta-pyjama-clad Abba, instead of going to office, would write all day.â€\n\nSayyid Akhtar Hussein Rizvi, known as Kaifi Azmi, was the son of a zamindar from Uttar Pradesh (United Provinces in British India) who gained renown at a young age for his Urdu poetry, especially as a ghazal (lyrical poem) writer. He joined first the Quit India Movement, then the Communist Party of India and lastly the Progressive Writersâ€™ Movement. He married Shaukat in Hyderabad where Munni (later named Shabana by a family friend) was born. The young family moved to Bombay where their son Baba was born. There Kaifi met filmmakers and started to work in the film industry as a script and dialogue writer and lyricist. Kaifi revamped Hindi film dialogues and songs by bringing Urdu literature to films. He changed the tenor and vocabulary of the filmi song. Kaifi Azmiâ€™s greatest feat as a writer is considered to be Chetan Anandâ€™s Heer Raanjha (1970) for which he penned the entire dialogue of the film in verse.\n\nShaukat Azmi in her Urdu lan-guage book Kaifi Aur Main, which has been translated into English by Nasreen Rehman under the title Kaifi and I, writes about Shabanaâ€™s personality growing up: â€œIt was her hypersensitivity that made her (Shabana) acutely aware of our financial constraints, and she never made the usual demands that most children make of their parents. White plimsoles were a part of her uniform and Shabana went through a pair in three or four months. One day, I grumbled, â€˜Such large feet like Clodhoppers! How can I afford a new pair, every three months?â€™ A few days later I noticed that her shoe was ripped near the small toe, but instead of asking for a new pair Shabana had cut out a piece of cardboard and glued it on the hole. My heart went out to her and I scraped togeth-er some money and bought her a new pair.\n\nI used to give Shabana thirty paisa a day for her bus fare from Juhu to Santa Cruz station. If she wanted a snack she saved five paisas by getting off the bus four stops earlier at Juhu Chowpatty and trudging home, but she never demanded extra money. Once again, it was from Parna that I learnt about this many years later.\n\nShabana was always looking for ways to earn some extra money for the house. After she had passed her Senior Cambridge in the first division, Shabana had three months before going to col-lege. She found herself a job selling Bru Coffee at petrol stations, earning thirty rupees a day. She did not tell me, and I am afraid that I was so busy rehearsing that I did not notice her absence. At the end of the month she handed me all the money she had earned. Surprised, I asked, â€˜Betey, where did you get this money from?â€™ She made light of it and said, â€˜I had three months to wait before going to college. I thought, why not put the time to some use.â€™\n\nI was very proud of Shabana but I was also distraught that at this young age she felt she had to share her familyâ€™s financial responsibilities.â€\n\nDespite the familyâ€™s finan-cial constraints, Shabana grew up in awe of her father who gave his children a unique Bohemian upbringing that contributed to their creative careers (Baba became a cine-matographer). Shabana com-pleted a graduate degree in Psychology from St. Xavierâ€™s College, Mumbai, and went to watch a film in the cinema that changed her life.\n\nâ€œI had the privilege of watch-ing Jaya Bahaduri in a (diploma) film, Suman, and I was completely enchanted by her performance because it was unlike the other perform-ances I had seen. I really mar-velled at that and said, â€˜My God, if by going to the Film Institute I can achieve that, thatâ€™s what I want to do.â€™â€ said Shabana looking back\n\nSince she had always enjoyed acting in school and college, she decided to pick it up as a vocation and joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune. Incidentally this was where actor Farooq Shaikh, of Umrao Jaan fame (that also starred Shaukat Azmi as the head courtesan), was two years her senior. Naturally gifted, Shabana topped the list of successful candidates of successful candidates of 1972.\n\nHer professor at FTII was the iconic film actor/director Guru Duttâ€™s award winning documentarist grandson Shyam Benegal. For his directorial feature film debut Ankur (The Seedling, released in 1974), he cast Shabana in the lead. The film is based on a true story of eco-nomic and sexual exploitation in his home state, Telangana. In it, Shabana plays Lakshmi, a married village servant who drifts into an affair with a col-lege student who visits the countryside. Benegal shot to fame with this film that started the realistic New India Cinema or parallel cinema. For her portrayal, Shabana won the National Film Award for Best Actress, quite a feat for a newcomer.\n\nThat year she also starred in Dev Anandâ€™s mainstream movie Ishq Ishq Ishq. Devâ€™s nephew, Shekhar Kapur, who had recently given up a desk job as a chartered accountant in London to pur-sue his Bollywood dream, had a support-ing role in the film. The actor, and later director, was smitten. Shabana promptly dumped her boyfriend actor Benjamin Gillani and began a seven year relation-ship with Shekhar. They eventually got engaged and moved in together to make a go of it. Though it didnâ€™t work out; they split up so amicably that later Shabana starred in Shekharâ€™s directorial debut Masoom (1982), based on Erich Segalâ€™s novel Man, Woman and Child, which catapulted him to fame as a director.\n\nShekhar went on to direct such commer-cial and critical successes as Mr. India and Bandit Queen. Internationally, he was chosen to direct Cate Blanchett in the vastly successful Elizabeth and Elizabeth: The Golden Age but after the box office dud Four Feathers, Western filmmakers are no longer as interested in hiring him.\n\nIn the meantime, the very married writer Javed Akhtar who lost his own poet father in 1976 had started visiting the Kaifi household. Javed had just added poetry to his roster of literary accom-plishments, having written his first Urdu couplet as homage to his father and sought counsel on matters pertaining to Urdu literature from Kaifi Azmi.\n\nJaved was born in 1945 in Gwalior to Jan Nisar and Safia Akhtar. Jan Nisar, an Urdu poet of ghazals and nazms (rhymed and prose style poems), a Bollywood lyricist and a part of the Progressive Writersâ€™ Movement, belonged to a renowned family of Sunni theologians, scholars and poets. His father Muztar Khairabadi and paternal uncle Bismil Khairabadi were both poets, while his great-grandfather, Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi was not just a scholar of Islamic studies and theology, but also edited the first diwan of Mirza Ghalib upon his request. He was also a leader ofÂ the Indian Revolution of 1857 in his hometown of Khairabad.\n\nJaved grew up in Lucknow and attended Saifiya College in Bhopal. Then, film star Rajesh Khanna changed his life. Up till now, different writers were used to pen a filmâ€™s story, screenplay and dialogue and none of them were given any credits in the title. Rajesh Khanna gave Javed and his writing partner Salim Khan (Salman Khanâ€™s father) their first break as screen-play writers by hiring them for Haathi Mere Saathi and sweetening the pot by mentioning them in the filmâ€™s credits. Javed said in an interview, â€œOne day, Rajesh Khanna went to Salim sahib and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bunga-low Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satis-factory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.â€\n\nOf the 25 films Salim-javed wrote, Â 21 were huge hits. Eventually, they split in 1982 reportedly due to ego issues. They are known as “the most successful (Bollywood) scriptwriters of all-time”\n\nThe eminently suc-cessful duo Salim-Javed became con-tracted by G. P. Sippy as resident screen-writers for Sippy Films and were responsible for such blockbusters as Andaz, Seeta Aur Geeta, Zanjeer, Deewaar, Sholay, Don and Mr. India, directed by Shabanaâ€™s ex Shekhar Kapur.\n\nTogether the Akhtar-Azmis are a redoubtable film family\n\nOn the sets of Hema Malini starrer Seeta Aur Geeta, Javed met the former child star and then 17 years old Honey Irani who had a supporting role in the film. Honey belonged to an Irani, Zoroastrian family and her older two sisters were also in the industry. Honeyâ€™s eldest sis-ter Maneka is married to the stunt film-maker Kamran Khan and is the mother of film-makers Sajid Khan and Farah Khan, the latter is ofcourse one of the better known choreogr-pahers in the indus- try. Honeyâ€™s mid-dle sister Daisy, who was a suc-cessful actress, is married to screen-writer K.K. Shukla.\n\nHoney developed a teenage crush on the 26 year old writer and the two bonded on a similar sense of humour. â€œI liked his sense of humour, he liked mine,â€ Honey told Farhana Farook, â€œLove is blind. I was totally in awe of Javedâ€¦.He was los-ing in a game of cards on the sets. I said, â€˜Let me pull a card for youâ€™. He said, â€˜If itâ€™s a good one, Iâ€™ll marry youâ€™. The card was good. He declared, â€˜Chalo, chalo letâ€™s get marriedâ€¦.Salim sahib, a family friend, told my mom that this boy wants to marry her but he has no home, plays cards and drinks. My mom said, â€˜Let her get married, sheâ€™ll learn a lesson and come back.â€™â€ Javed later immortalized their proposal in the Sholay scene when Amitabh Bachchan takes Dharmendraâ€™s proposal to Hema Maliniâ€™s aunt Leela Mishra.\n\nThey got married in 1972. â€œWe didnâ€™t have a place. My elder sister Maneka, who was married to filmmaker Kamran Khan (filmmakers Farah and Sajid Khanâ€™s father), had an extra room in Juhu. It was used to store shooting props.\n\nShe cleared it for us. We stayed there for a year,â€ Honey said. â€œJaved made me promise; I wouldnâ€™t accompany him to parties, apply make-up or hire a maid. So, Iâ€™d get up at 4 am to fill water. Of course, when I got pregnant, we had a maid. I had two air-conditioners in my parentsâ€™ home. Javed felt bad for me as we didnâ€™t have one. He got a second-hand air condition-er. We were thrilled and called our neigh-bours. And just when they had gathered, the AC conked off. I was so upset. Weâ€™d then sprinkle water on the floor, spread a chaddar and sleep.â€\n\nTwo children were born in quick suc-cession, Zoya and Farhan. Affluence fol-lowed Javedâ€™s career success. Honeyâ€™s film connections and Javedâ€™s talent made the couple popular socially and soon they were spending convivial evenings with top stars like Amitabh Bachchan. Honey reminisces, â€œI guess I was lucky for him. After Zanjeer, we never looked back. We bought a flat in Bandstand and then this bungalow. Mashallah! We had a party every night. Amitji and Jaya (Bachchan), Yashji and Pam (Chopra), Yashji and Hiroo (Johar) would often be here. Those days Amitji used to drink. Weâ€™d have a blast the whole night and then go and drop him for his shoot at 5 am. The initial years were wonderful. I donâ€™t really blame Javed for what hap-pened later. He was young when he got such huge success. Itâ€™s not easy to handle that. He used to drink a lot too. That was one of the major problems.â€\n\nSimultaneously, another relationship was brewing. Shabana recounts how â€œJaved had been coming to our home for a long time, like other poets he would come to read his poems to my father, seek his opinion. But I was very busy with my work, and never really engaged with him. I would try to avoid him since Javed was a married man with two children.â€ Finally, he took the first step at a Page 3 event, and struck up a conversation with Shabana about her film Sparsh and it was the first of many engaging literary, philo-sophical and political conversations between the two.\n\nJaved said at this time Shabana was plagued by â€œthousands of questions about which sheâ€™d never thought earlier. Itâ€™s no surprise then that we were drawn closer to each other.â€\n\nShabana added, â€œI sat in on conversa-tions my father had with him on poetry, on politics, and I realised he was very different from his image. Look at the similarities in our backgrounds. In dis-covering Javed I rediscovered my father. Both are from UP, both poets, film lyri-cists, writers. Both love politics… In fact if you consider the fact that one seeks the perfect match of backgrounds for an arranged marriage, then this could well have been the perfect arranged marriage. He was already married by the time I realised how well suited we were. We stayed away from each other for as long as was possible. My mother was against it completely.â€\n\nShabana said she liked Javedâ€™s wit, humour and his tehzeeb (manners). â€œHe would never put up his feet before elders.â€\n\n1976 onward rumours of his closeness with Shabana fuelled frequent feuds between the married couple. â€œWe separat-ed in 1978 as things had turned bad,â€ said Honey without any bitterness. Javed and Shabana had become increasingly open about their relationship in the couple of years preceding the separation. â€œThere were fights and ugly scenes. But we ensured the children (Farhan and Zoya) werenâ€™t around. I realised there was no point in living with a man who was no longer in love with me. So I told him, â€˜Please.â€™ Javed said he couldnâ€™t speak to the children. So I spoke to them and said, â€˜Your father is not leaving me because of you guys. Itâ€™s just that we donâ€™t get along.â€™â€\n\nâ€œNobody can understand the anguish, the heartbreak,â€ said Shabana. â€œThere were children involved. For 2 to 3 years, we suffered the trauma. And then one day, we decided to break up. It was too trau-matic for the children if we went on. We told each other, â€˜We will break up after one last meeting.â€™ We met for that last meeting and we talked and talked … not love talk alone, but about everything, pol-itics, poetry. We got so busy talking, we forgot to break up.\n\nAfter the separation, though Javed was providing child support, it didnâ€™t cover all the childrenâ€™s expenses. â€œI started embroidering saris. Reena Roy, Mumtaz and others would buy them,â€ said enterprising Honey. â€œI had written some short stories but feared theyâ€™d be dismissed as Javedâ€™s.â€ She showed one to Pam Chopra who showed it to her husband Yash Chopra, the uber successful filmmaker. Yash chose it for a film. â€œLater, Yashji asked me to develop a â€˜five minuteâ€™ idea which he gave me. Soon, I wrote the script and read it out to him. But he just got up and left. An hour later, he returned after having completed his pooja. He hugged me saying, â€˜I was so moved. Itâ€™s fantastic.â€ The film was Lamhe (1992), which became a big hit. Honey also wrote Darr (1993) for Yash Raj Films, followed by Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Kya Kehna and Koi Mil Gaya. She fell out with the Chopras when she complained that she wasnâ€™t given due cred-it for writing Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge.\n\nWhen I told my father, I asked him, â€˜Is he wrong for me?â€™\n\nAnd he said, â€œHe is not wrong, but the circumstances are wrong.â€™\n\nWhen I asked him, â€˜What if I change the circumstances?â€™\n\nHe said, â€˜Then it should be okay.â€™\n\nShabana and Javedâ€™s affair continued for the next six years and Shabana inspired him to write romantic couplets.\n\nThe song Dekha ek khwaab from Silsila picturised on Amitabh-Rekha was written in 1981 at the height of their affair.Â They eventually tied the knot in a traditional Muslim ceremony in 1984, while his divorce from Honey was finalized the fol-lowing year.\n\nThe public was outraged because peo-ple felt that Shabana who proudly posed as a feminist was being a hypocrite by first having an adulterous affair and then getting married to an already mar-ried man. Shabana defended her decision explaining that she was no home-wrecker and that the mar-riage was already over by the time she entered the scene. Though not entirely true, that was her justifica-tion.\n\nHoney said she maintained cor-dial relations with her ex and still respected him. â€œHe has been decent and generous. He gave me this house. Javed says, â€˜One good thing about you is that you donâ€™t cling to negative thoughtsâ€™. Once someone says â€˜sorryâ€™, my slate is clean.â€\n\nâ€œGirls run after him. He is a poet, he must be so romantic, they think. But believe me, there is not a single romantic bone in his body. I once asked him about it and he joked: â€˜Look, the trapeze artist does not hang from a trapeze at home.â€\n\nâ€œI didnâ€™t make any sacrifices â€” thatâ€™s too dramatic. I did what I thought was right,â€ she said describing her life as a struggling single mother. â€œI did miss a man. I was in a long relationship, which didnâ€™t work. But I never gave marriage a thought. I didnâ€™t know how heâ€™d be with the kids. Though they did tell me, â€˜If you wish to get married, go aheadâ€™. Today I have my grandchildren (Shakya 12, and Akira 5), my friends and my work. Of course, you do feel lonely. But I canâ€™t go through the pain again. At this age what you need is a companion, someone to share, to travel with…There again Iâ€™m being a romantic.â€\n\nShe was generous enough to allow Shabana to enjoy a warm relationship with Farhan and Zoya. â€œI never spoke a word against Shabana or Javed. I didnâ€™t want the children to develop feelings of hate or anger. Theyâ€™d go over and meet them. Javed would come over. Touchwood! Their relationship never went wrong. But I have no rapport as such with her. I go to Javedâ€™s house on his birthday. Shabana and I greet each other. Itâ€™s cordial. Thereâ€™s a lot of respect. Thatâ€™s it. But itâ€™s not as if we are sahelis (friends). Not at all.â€\n\nShabana described her conjugal bliss in an interview, â€œAfter marriage it was like we were two peas in a pod. So much was similar about us. There was not much adjustment needed on my part. There was so much he had gone through in a broken marriage that he had come out of it wiser, more mature. I married a sensible man, growing wiser with years. We have each shaped and moulded the other since we married, but the most important fact is that we are also very good friends. And he jokes in his typical manner. He loves to say â€˜Shabana is such a good friend; even marriage could not spoil our friendship.â€™\n\nI have no interest in action films, or in sports. He loves all sports: tennis, cricket, soccer. He took me to watch the finals at Wimbledon. I watched the match and swore never to go again. He also likes to joke: If thereâ€™s a sad serious film on TV, or a boring programme, he will say, â€˜Shabana ko bulao, itâ€™s her type of pro-gramme.â€™â€\n\nWhile doting on her husband Shabana continued, â€œthe wonderful thing about Javed is that whether I am with him in a slum or with the Queen of England, he is so completely at home. He will win them all over. He is constantly stealing my friends away from me! But to give him his due, in academic circles he is known at Princeton, Harvard, Columbia, and he has delivered lectures there. He com-mands a lot of respect. He is competitive but never jealous; he is ambitious but never insecure.\n\nFor medical reasons, I could not have a child. It hurt a lot, and I was heartbroken for a while. Then I told myself, â€˜One canâ€™t have everything in life.â€™ Also Zoya and Farhan were very young then, and their mother was generous in letting us have access to them. So I had children around. And I got the man! I cannot imagine being married to anyone else.\n\nWe have deep trust and faith in one another.Â He will never open my bag, or read my mail. (I would do all that though.) The friendship keeps us close. He is deeply emotional and sen-sitive. Of course we have fights and bit-terness; we are so busy in our own worlds that it is great to be together when we do meet! That is what marriage should be about â€“ the undying and unconditional friendship between two individu-als who invest trust and time in each other for a lifetime.â€\n\nJaved said something similar\n\nto Priya Gupta in an interview for The Times of India, â€œShabana is basically my friend. We happen to be married. Our friendship is so strong that even marriage could not break it. We got mar-ried as people thought that you have to be married. What is impor-tant is there are so many things that we share, like our basic values and our aesthetics. And there are many matters on which we differ from each other. But if we are totally sim-ilar, then you should not live with a person who is exactly like you. And if you are totally different, then too, you canâ€™t function together. So I think there is a right kind of balance between similarity and dissimilarity between us. She is a very strong woman with a strong sense of fairness and desire for justice all around. We have come from the same training school. Her parents were poets, leftists, involved in progress of writersâ€™ movements. We both, in our own way, have learnt to hold progressive, liberal, religious and as a matter of fact almost anti- religious values. But she is dangerously frank. That makes me uncomfortable. I generally donâ€™t do that. Much like all cultural civilisations, I am diplomatic.â€\n\nâ€œThe camaraderie between Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar is hard to miss; they are so at ease with each other. â€˜We have a really happy marriage because we rarely meet,â€™ quips Shabana.\n\nJaved believes that two people can be happy together only when they are happy as individuals. â€œAnd no matter how close you are to each other, every-one has a private space that needs to be respected. When you expect more than the other person is willing to give, the relationship sours,â€ he says.\n\nShabana recounted an incident where a woman walked in on her ironing Javedâ€™s kurta. â€˜She asked me how I could call myself a feminist. I was doing it because I wanted him to wear a well-ironed kurta. It was that simple,â€™ she says. Javed adds, â€˜Thankfully no one came into the room the day I was press-ing your feet because you were tired. They wouldnâ€™t have believed it if I told them that it was not an everyday occurrence!â€™\n\nAnd when it comes to age, Shabana is more accepting of it. â€˜Embrace your age. Donâ€™t fight to be younger,â€™ she says, even as Javed adds, â€˜Given a chance, Iâ€™d live forever. Not because I love myself â€” although that is true too â€” but because the thought that I wonâ€™t be around to see new movies, listen to new songs and learn about new discoveries about the human body and the uni-verse is depressing. And there are so many poems, scripts and more waiting to be written.â€™â€ â€”Susanna Myrtle Lazarus, The Hindu â€œGirls run after him. He is a poet, he must be so romantic, they think. But believe me, there is not a single romantic bone in his body. I once asked him about it and he joked: â€˜Look, the trapeze artist does not hang from a trapeze at home.â€\n\nThe Sunday Tribune article described their relationship thus: â€œHereâ€™s a marriage where the couple discuss various â€˜ismsâ€™ (socialism, Marxism or secularism) over a cup of adrak (ginger) tea which Javed cannot make and Shabana loves. Itâ€™s another matter altogether that their rare disagreements lead to heated debates. Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtarâ€™s is a marriage of intellect, and like true believ-ers in democracy, they agree to disagree.\n\nWhile possessiveness for the man and jealousy in the woman are considered inevitable and even prescribed in a romantic relationship, hereâ€™s a couple who thinks differently. Says Javed in an interview, â€˜We seek love from one source, wisdom from another and companionship from yet another. Seldom does it all come from one single source. She gives me all this plus mental and intellectual support.â€™\n\nAnd when constant companionship like Siamese twins is considered a hall-mark of intimacy, Shabana has her own prescription for a successful relationship. â€˜Bumping into each other, occasionally, at airports,â€™ she says, â€˜is very good for mar-riage!â€™\n\nThe world knows her as the inspiration behind Javedâ€™s most romantic song, Ek ladki ko dekha toh aaisa laga. She was theÂ narmi ki baat (gentle whispers), sardi ki dhup (the winter sun), resham ki dor (a strand of silk) and sandhal ki aag (a sandalwood fire).\n\nShe, in turn, simply calls him Jaduâ€”in her peculiar style with sparkling eyes disap-pearing into the crinkles. She is not the only muse in this relationship. â€˜What I really value is when I have to write a paper and am stuck; I know I can depend on him to help me.â€™ For Shabana, Jadu is the touchstone for testing ideas and thoughts. Itâ€™s Javed who encouraged her to do the con-troversial role in Fire (in which she plays a lonely lesbian). He is the one who coerced her into Submitting Arth for National Film Awards (1982) and Fire for the Best Actress Award both times.â€\n\nThough Javed was born a Muslim, heÂ is a self proclaimed atheist and raised his children with the same beliefs. In fact, Javed gets upset when people refer to him as being Muslim. he replies that only his name is muslimÂ\n\nAfter his second marriage, Javed had a solo writing career in which he wrote the scripts for a dozen movies and more than 100 songs. He has won a total of 11 National Film Awards for his song lyrics and 13 Filmfare Awards; he was also awarded the civilian honours Padma Shri in 1999 and the Padma Bhushan in 2007 by the Government of India, as well as the 2013 Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu, Indiaâ€™s second highest literary honour, for his poetry anthol- ogy Lava. He also served for a term in the Parliamentâ€™s upper house Rajya Sabha starting 2009.\n\nJavedâ€™s son Farhan Akhtar is an actor/filmmaker and Zoya is a screenwriter/direc-tor. They have collaborated on films such as Dil Chahta Hai, Rock On and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara that have the recurring theme of friendship. Farhan said this was because he leaned on his friendsâ€™ support during the painful times his parents split up. â€œI have always found this relationship of friends very beauti-ful. It made a lot of sense to me when Zoya told me that dur-ing our growing up years, friends played a very important part for us. Given the fact that my parents were going through a divorce, friends became a huge part of our support sys-tem and eased a whole lot of pain for us.â€\n\nRecognised as one of the finest Indian actresses and having appeared in more than 120 Hindi and Bengali films, Shabana in her turn has won the National Film Award for Best Actress five times and also bagged four F"
