        "text": "She was almost nearing 30,when she was playing the role of Kasturba in Richard Attenborough’s English Academy awards winning film ‘Gandhi’. But, that role made her an internationally acclaimed actress. Born as Rohini Oak in Pune, Rohini married Jayadev Hattangadi, who was her batch mate in NSD, Delhi. Today, Rohini Hattangadi, is a renowned personality in films, theatre and television industry. So far, she has won two Filmfare Awards, one National Film Award, and is the only Indian actress to win the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance as Kasturba Gandhi in Gandhi (1982). Since her childhood, she always wanted to become an actress and began her lessons through theatre. Rohini made her film debut with Saeed Akhtar Mirza’s ‘Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan’ in 1978. The film won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie. This was followed by her appearance in Mirza’s next picture, ‘Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Ata Hai’ (1980), which won the same award, and Rabindra Dharmaraj’s drama Chakra (1981). Her roles in these films were not big; but after her performance in ‘Gandhi’ in 1982, she was mostly offered character roles in mainstream Hindi cinema and was often typecast in mother’s roles, much ahead of her actual age. Respected for her acting prowess, she has appeared in about 80 feature films, and is today very active on Marathi television.\n\nRohini Hattangadi, Actress\n\nBeing a versatile actress, Rohini has performed in many Hindi and Marathi serials in the recent past; but, her eTV’s serial ‘Char Divas Sasuche’ which made a record run of more than 6 years continuously. Today, she is the most popular TV actress, returning back with another important role of a head of the family in Zee Marathi’s new serial ‘Honar Sunn Mee Hya Gharchi’. Marathi Movie world spoke to this resourceful actress, to know more about her 35 year long acting career.\n\nQ: We have heard that every serial you are part of in Marathi, turns out to be a marathon serial, gaining popularity. What’s your reaction ? A: Yes, I have seen the success and popularity of ‘Char Diwas Sasuche’; and now, being part of ‘Honar Sun Mee Hya Gharchi’, I watching almost the same reactions coming from people, who I come across. They have appreciated the subject and my role. But, I would attribute the credit of popularity of the serial to the entire team, the writer, producer, director and all the artistes. It’ happens because of good team work.\n\nQ: In your acting career, right from the beginning stage, you have played the Mother’s role for actors, who were much elder to you. How did you react to that situation? A: Being a professional actress, I had to be prepared for any role that was offered to me. Yes, some of the actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Jitendra were more than10 years elder to me. But, it all depended, how that actor playing my son, responded in all those important scenes with me. For any actor, it is very important to extract the best out of him or her; with the good support coming from the artiste who is opposite that person in a particular scene.\n\nQ: Recently, we even saw you performing in a Marathi film ‘Premachi Goshta’ after a long time. Your comments. A: Yes, I did accept that role, as I liked the script.\n\nQ: There are many new Marathi stage plays on different subjects. Aren’t you tempted to perform on Marathi stage now? A: I had done stage in the past. But, in the recent past, I had not received any offers with a good script. But, very soon, you will see me performing in a play ‘Jagadamba’ which is on the life of Kasturba Gandhi. The play was already staged in 2009 and is being revived now. I will be playing the lead role with a solo performance in this two act play. There is lot to be told about life of kasturba Gandhi and her actual role in the life of Mahatma Gandhi. The general feeling is that, ‘behind every successful man there is a wife’. But, in the case of Gandhiji, kasturba was always with him and not behind him. That’s what this play will be speaking about. Through this play, the main character will be communicating with the audience. So, just wait. I am getting ready for this play.\n\nQ: Tell us something about this ongoing serial of yours, ‘Honar Sun Mee Hya Gharchi’? A; Well, I liked the concept and even my role in it. The head of the family I play, is very strict, who wants everybody to be disciplined and speak truth. She is taking good care of all the women folks in the house, after getting rid of the useless men; except her Grandson- Shree, who is well behaved and very much attached to her."
