        "text": "Last year, TBIP documented the work and lives of some of India’s best known ‘character actors’, through a series of photographic portraits and in-depth interviews. In the second part of that series, we present Alok Nath.\n\nAlok Nath, 58, is one of Hindi cinema’s most recognizable ‘character actors’. A National School of Drama alumnus, he is well known for essaying the role of a kindly patriarch in many Bollywood films in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, among them the blockbusters Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1993) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). Also, Nath has won acclaim for his turn as Haveli Ram in Doordarshan’s television series, Buniyaad.\n\nLast December, jokes and memes based on characters played by Alok Nath—mostly on the ‘sanskaari’ (morally upright) and ‘kanyadaani’ (father of the bride) nature of his on-screen avatars—went viral on Twitter and Facebook, leading to the actor’s name trending on social media for no apparent reason, prompting online marketing case studies on the phenomenon.\n\nThe shoot and interview takes place at his apartment in Lokhandwala, Mumbai. We sit on velvet upholstered sofas in his sitting room, chatting about the highs and lows of his journey as an actor, interrupted occasionally by the snores of his pet Boston terrier sleeping on a chair nearby.\n\nOne of your first roles was in Gandhi. What were your thoughts while working on the movie with actors like Ben Kingsley, Roshan Seth, etc. Do you have any special memories of it? How did you get the role?\n\nWhen I joined Hindu college, at Delhi University, I was very active in college theatre as well as in the Ruchika theatre group. I also kept doing television. After college I chose to take up acting professionally. My parents had wanted me to be a doctor—my father is a doctor—but they stopped interfering and left the decision to me once I took up humanities instead of science in college. After graduating I joined the National School of Drama in Delhi. I did three years there and even in my spare time and during the holidays continued with professional theatre and television in Delhi. Towards the end of my time at the National School of Drama (NSD), in 1980, Dolly Thakore from Bombay came to our school looking for actors for small character roles in Gandhi, being directed by the great Sir Richard Attenborough. We were told to represent the National School of Drama in the auditions and have a nice bath, wear clean clothes, shave, oil our hair… Getting the role or not was immaterial. Just to see Richard Attenborough in the flesh—he used to do theatre too and we were in awe of him—was a big high. When I met him at the Ashoka Hotel I was shivering. He looked me over and seemed to contemplate, as if he was buying a horse or cattle. His eyes were piercing into me and I was dying, frankly, because I wasn’t getting any reaction that revealed whether he liked me or not. He finally said, “Yeah Dolly looks good.” Dolly lead me into an adjacent room and said, “You’re on Alok. So this character is called Tyeb Mohammed, one of Gandhi’s associates and friends when he was in South Africa and involved in the coal miners’ agitation. So you got the role.” I said, “That’s great. But what do I do for it?” And she said, “See you look the role, that’s why Attenborough chose you.”\n\nLater I realized I must have been chosen because I had that mean hungry look those days, the look of a frustrated theatre actor who is a committed revolutionary, a Commie theatre enthusiast.\n\nShe asked me “How much will you charge?” In those days, in television, for a play for which you had to rehearse for a week or 10 days and then record, we would get 60 rupees. Nobody had asked me what I would charge. I was just given whatever pittance and I took it. So I was like, “Madam Dolly…” Dolly was a nice looking young woman, very Westernised. And here we were, the lesser humans visiting a posh Delhi hotel, who had never been to a five star hotel suite, and my feet were like jelly but I couldn’t say that I haven’t done a film before so I don’t know how much to charge. Also I couldn’t say I used to get 60 rupees or she’d give me 100 rupees or something. So I just kept quiet. She finally said, “Okay will over 20 be alright?” I almost got a heart attack because I used to get 60 and now 20? Then she said, “Twenty thousand rupees. Should we close the deal?” My expression was like… I literally shat in my pants. I was like, “Yeah 20 is fine, it should be good.” And as I was calculating how much 20,000 rupees was, she took out a wad of notes for 10,000 rupees. “Here is an advance and you’re on.” And she made me sign some papers. So that was how I got Gandhi. I went out of the room, kept the money in my pocket, left the hotel, then took the money out and checked if they were real notes. I kept the wad under my armpits and the whole way back I took an auto-rickshaw (I used to travel by bus normally). I went home and gave the money to mom. My parents too were shocked. “Thank God you didn’t become a doctor,” they said. Because my father didn’t earn 10,000 rupees in a year.\n\nYou had only one film as a hero, Kamagni. Why were you not considered for the lead more often back then? Because I’ve seen younger photos of you. And…\n\nJust say it. That I was good looking.\n\nYou were good looking. Why were you not offered leads?\n\nBetween Gandhi and Kamagni there were five to six years. I struggled in Bombay for almost two years and got nothing but constantly kept doing theatre at Prithvi Theatre with Mrs. Nadira Babbar, Raj Babbar’s wife. Raj, an NSD alumnus, had suddenly become an overnight superstar and signed some 30 to 40 odd films. That was also one of the reasons for this exodus of a lot of Delhi actors to Bombay. They wanted to get into the gold rush of cinema by which Raj Babbar, a Delhi theatre actor, had become a hero.\n\nDuring that span of doing theatre in Prithvi with Nadiraji, a lot of film people used to come and watch our shows. I got some small roles in films. My first break was with Mr. Yash Chopra in a film called Mashaal with Anil Kapoor—it was also one of his first films—and Dilip (Kumar) saab. I played a journalist and he later gave me a role again in his film Lamhe and then I got a role in Aaj Ki Awaaz, a B. R. Chopra film.\n\nAlso, in those days the TV serial business had begun in a big way here. There was a serial made in Delhi called Hum Log, the first Indian soap. And people lapped it up like crazy. In the wake of that, more serials started getting made in Bombay. So 26 and 30 episode serials were being made. I started getting work in these serials starting with one by Basu Chatterjee, then by Nadiraji herself doing a serial and then Mr. Ramesh Sippy’s company making a serial on journalism, a caricaturist kind of show called Chapte Chapte. I played a cranky, grumpy editor, and then Buniyaad happened.\n\nBuniyaad was a major milestone in my life which catapulted me into the acting space. I was compared to the greats of those times. The press suddenly put me on this pedestal and I got great acting offers but the condition of Buniyaad, also made by Mr. Ramesh Sippy, was that you had to give one year to them in which you would concentrate on this one show. With Buniyaad it was like I had gotten my voting card for Bombay, that read: ‘Alok Nath, Actor’.\n\nAnd yet the irony of Buniyaad was I couldn’t do other work, so a lot of offers went rejected. And while people wanted to work initially, things changed. Let me explain. When I started Buniyaad I was 26-27 years of age and it started with me playing a young revolutionary, an honest, good looking guy, falling in love with a woman. Then we married, had children, they grew up, they got married, they having children and we became grandparents. All of this in one year. So in one year I lived 60 years of my life. In that one year the younger Haveli Ram, the character in the serial which got all these offers, was forgotten and at the end the image of a masterji, growing old, remained in the audience’s mind. The last shot of the serial, that has lasted in people’s memory, was that I am walking with two grandchildren into the horizon. An 80 year old man, balding, with white hair. That was the lasting image of Alok Nath.\n\nHum Aapke Hain Koun.. ! established you as a sort of household name. What was it like working on that film? Hum Aapke… also affected the tone of movies made in Bollywood in the nineties. Did you anticipate the effect that it had?\n\nBefore that was Maine Pyaar Kiya and even before that was Saraansh in 1983, produced by the same Rajshri Productions. In the early eighties I was doing doing a play at Prithvi called Sandheya Chaya. It’s about an old couple in their late 60s or 70s, whose children have left them for their work, staying abroad. And how they make friends with people who visit them, or the postman, or the next door servant or some person who’s dialed them by mistake. So I was playing one of the old couple and Raj Babbar was doing some Rajshri film. The people from Rajshri saw a performance. So the next day Mr. Babbar had left a message with the paanwalla asking me to call him immediately. We never had phones in those days so the paanwalla at the corner would take our messages and paid him a little extra in return. So I called Raj Babbar and he asked me to turn up at the Rajshri office.\n\nWhen I landed up I was shown into a room and it was Rajkumar Barjatya, Sooraj Barjatya’s father’s room.\n\nI introduced myself, saying: “My name is Alok Nath. Mr. Raj Babbar has asked me to come and meet you.”\n\nHe said, “Lekin par kyon (But why)?”\n\nI’m amazed at this man. He has called me all the way from Juhu and he’s not even recognizing me.\n\nA little agitated, I said, “Sir I am Mrs. Nadira Babbar’s actor. We have a group called Ekjute. Yesterday some people from your office came to see the play and then I got a call.”\n\nHe said, “You were in the play last night?” I said, “Yes sir.” He asked, “What were you doing in the play?” I was on the edge, also reaching the end of my patience. “Sir I was acting in the play, playing the lead.” He said, “Tum toh… lekin woh buddha tha (But, he was an old man)!” I said, “Sir, he was an old man, but I am a young man. I was acting in that play as an old man. But I am 25 years old.”\n\nHe finally recognised me, then said, “Good, good. But very sad.” He said he couldn’t give me the role. “This film we are making, we need an older man in this. But don’t worry Mr. Alok. We will always work with you.” So this is my history with Rajshri. I didn’t get that role, Anupam Kher got it. Bastard! He is just one year older than me. The only solace I got was that he must have been looking older than me. They gave me a small role in that film, a sadhu’s role. And since that film, I have worked in every film of theirs except Main Prem ki Diwaani Hoon.\n\nWere you wary of getting typecast? Did you try to resist it?\n\nI was aware of it, not much initially because initially there was the thirst of getting into the groove of films, being a part of this cinema world. I accepted what I was offered. Refusal would mean that the offers would stop coming, because it’s a small industry and people take offence if you refuse them.\n\nWhen I was in it, I was doing it with all my honesty. By the time I realised no yaar, I think I’m on the wrong bus, I could not change things.\n\nThere were some offers, but they were not out and out different. A good man turning villain in the end, at the climax, so people will not think that he’s a villain— those kinds of roles. But even they did not work with the audience. The films worked, but I didn’t get any recognition, so I was stuck in this scenario where I would do only goody-goody roles, older roles, big brother roles, the uncle, the father, now the grandfather… It’s ok. It’s paid my bills, I’ve bought my own house, my car, I had the courage to get married, have children, give them a good education. At the end of the day, the creativity got a little dejected but survival was funded by these films.\n\nIn Hindi cinema it’s not just an actor but also a role that gets typecast. What have been the characteristics of the traditional Indian father? Is that image changing today?\n\nA father is a person who is always looked upon as a positive person from the hero’s point of view because we have an Indian tradition of following in your father’s footsteps. So if the father is good the hero is good and the hero is always good so that means the father should always be good. If the father is bad then there are influences of that in the hero which get corrected during the process of the film. Goodness prevails. But the father figure is mostly pujya. Pujya matlab (Pujya means) a respected person. Whether he is poor or rich he is listened to, his values are cared for, his directives are obeyed.\n\nBut now, also, over the last decade our cinema has gone through a lot of churning. The whole genre of filmmaking has changed in which the family has suddenly taken a back seat. There’s less of pitaji or bauji or babuji, and more of ‘mom-dad’. The ‘Yo!’ kind of generation has emerged. And the generation gap between children and their parents doesn’t seem to show much, even literally, because of facilities such as beauty products, various options in clothing, technologies like hair weaving etc. So the parents look young and happening now, which is a kind of role I don’t fit into.\n\nAlso the heroes of the last two decades have now become fathers, though they still want to be heroes. But unfortunately their children have become heroes too, so they have had to graduate to fathers. So automatically those fathers have taken up more cinema space and left little for outsider fathers like us.\n\nFinally, there are ‘lesser parents’, for subjects where parents are not really required. Here they are just like furniture in a film, with small roles. Maybe just passing by or with two or three scenes. Or they’re shown in albums or photographs, things like that. So, often, parents are now not an integral part of Indian cinema.\n\nYou once mentioned some particular mannerisms or thought processes that you may have that make people cast you as an older person? What did you mean?\n\nYou can’t defy age, though I did do so in the opposite direction. I played father to heroes elder to me. I’ve done almost 500 films till now in my 30 to 35 years in Bombay and almost 95% of them have been in older roles— older than my present age. And I have never said no to a film. The only film I refused around 20 years ago was one from Madras. I was asked to play Mr. Jeetendra’s father to which I said nahin (no) yaar, this is too much. He must be about 15 years older to me.\n\nYou also mentioned in an interview that you had certain goals when you came to Mumbai but you hadn’t achieved what you set out to do. If you could re-do your innings as an actor, what changes would you make to it?\n\nIn any sphere of life you have to have a goal post and you have to aim well to score. Anybody who comes in at an early age, wants to become a star, a hero. When you brush or shave in the morning there’s nobody better looking than you. You’re the ultimate. You’re Don Juan. I also came in thinking like that. But your dreams get shattered slowly, till you realise you need to face the world, face reality. This is it, accept it or leave it. At this one stage of life you’re a beggar so you can’t be a chooser because it’s a question of survival. In addition you have your family’s baggage: What the hell, you’ve left us! You’ve gone to Bombay to become a hero! What’s happening? No news! Nothing’s happening! Everybody’s shining, you’re not shining!\n\nYou get frustrated, you’re in a foreign country and you lap up the first opportunity just to prove to somebody back home that: No, no. See, that show is coming, or that film is coming. Watch. It’s me. So in doing so you accept a little defeat thinking that if you prove yourself in that little role maybe in the next film the same people will say, “He performed well, he’s a good man. He behaved well while shooting, let’s give him a better role.”\n\nAnd things keeps improving too but, in doing so, time passes. To relive the past, to recycle, to change goal posts, is not easy. Obviously anybody would want to be a star, live young like a hero, sing nice songs, dance with beautiful girls, fall in love with them on screen, different women, different films, different directors. That karishma (miracle), that aura, the almost demi-god feeling… that I missed.\n\nBollywood can limit actors like yourself and yet you have been a part\n\nof it for many years. What keeps you going?\n\nWith acting the biggest reward was that it was my hobby which turned into my passion and then my passion turned into my profession. And it’s paying you, with money, recognition, adulation, love and respect from the audience. The money makes it a very cushy life that way.\n\nYou’ve done work recently with well known online comedy groups. What was it like exploring this new aspect? Also, did your newfound spurt of fame on social media affect your life in any way?\n\nComedy is not an integral part of an Indian household. We don’t laugh too much or too often unfortunately. There is a lack of humour in our lives. When I was in school, in the initial stages of theatre, I used to do a lot of comedy in school functions because you are young and your audience is young. There was laughter, gaiety and even more slapstick, bizarre and over the top comedy.\n\nBut then seriousness happened to me, age happened, so the comic aspect of my personality got buried. People think: He’s a serious bugger, he doesn’t laugh much, he doesn’t make people laugh much.\n\nSo with people making fun of me in the social media what can I do? It’s good! It takes a lot of work to squeeze out something funny from a serious wood like Alok Nath. Why take offense? I laugh at jokes made on other people.\n\nNow my daughter, who’s studied filmmaking abroad, was working with AIB (All India Bakchod). One evening, she seemed very serious. “Papa, they’re making sketches and caricaturish stuff on you and Kejriwal. I don’t think I’ll be assisting them on this one.” When I asked why she said, “They’re making fun of you. You’ll be saying funny things to him and your voice will be speaking from your portrait.” I said, “So what? So much of that has happened already (on social media).” She said, “Yeah but doing it to your own father, I’m not feeling quite good about it.” I said, “That’s your call. But it’s your work. I’d say go ahead and do it.”\n\nThen I said, “Suppose I do it? Instead of the portrait, if I was there? Then would you do it?” She immediately called those people: “Hey my dad says that you can take him.” And they went crazy. Really? Alokji will do it? Then they called me and thanked me. I went and shot it and I enjoyed it. It went viral, got some 35 lakh views. Then some other company called Gray made some jokes, some rap songs to promote some project. Then the 9X people, Comedy Central, Channel V… So I said, chalo karo (come lets do it). That hidden bug of comedy is coming alive so let’s give it a different shape. I’m enjoying it.\n\n“Life’s like a play; it’s not the length but the excellence of acting that matters.”\n\n—Seneca, Roman Philosopher, mid-1st century CE.\n\nFor our year end upload we bring you actors from the past few decades. Actors. Not the big-movie stars who have battled constantly for attention, but those who have climbed stealthily into our cultural landscape and are here to stay. Stealthily because unlike our heroes and heroines our films are not tailored to prop them up. But they transcend the stock roles they are given—those of maids, mothers, uncles, villains and at times just a grey amorphous area in a script that is supposed to stand for the ‘common’ man or woman—and bring to these roles and the films something that make them memorable so that, long after, we remember the role, even if not the name of the person who played it. Here are portraits and interviews of five ‘character actors’ who have stood the test of time.\n\nSulabha Deshpande, 76, has been a founder member of the Marathi theatre groups ‘Rangayan’ (with theatre director Vijaya Mehta and her husband Arvind Deshpande) and ‘Awishkar’. Sulabha and Arvind Deshpande and playwright Vijay Tendulkar were also at the centre of the ‘Chhabildas Movement’ in Marathi experimental theatre during the 1960s and 70s. Her most memorable theatre performance has been that of Benare, the protagonist of Tendulkar’s landmark Marathi play Shantata! Court Chalu Ahe. She essayed the same role in its film adaptation. Deshpande went on to act in several other mainstream and parallel Marathi and Hindi movies, during the seventies and eighties, such as Shyam Benegal‘s Bhumika: The Role (1977) and Kondura (1978), Saeed Akhtar Mirza‘s Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980) and Govind Nihalani’s Vijeta (1982), and Tezaab (1988), Ghar Ho To Aisa (1990) and Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat (1997). Her last appearance in a Hindi film has been in English Vinglish (2012). Deshpande is soft spoken and she says her memory isn’t as sharp as it once was. Yet, as we go over the past at her Mahim flat, with the rain falling hard outside, she recounts the most amazing stories.\n\nHow did you begin acting?\n\nMy father (Vasant Rao Kamerkar) was a recordist with HMV. So, in a big hall at our home, we used to have rehearsals for songs and plays, which he would record. From when I was four years old, which is when I had begun to speak, I would enter that space and perform after the rehearsals. But my first ‘proper’ role was in school, in the seventh standard. There was a play written by a teacher in which I was cast as a small child. After this I did a play in my first year of college, for a festival.\n\nDid you do only Marathi theatre, when you started out, or Hindi theatre as well?\n\nBoth. At first I worked in Marathi theatre. My first work in Hindi was Andha Yug, with (theatre director) Satyadev Dubey in 1964. That was for the theatre group Nandikar’s theatre festival in Calcutta. Four days before the play the actress who was playing Gandhari (a character from the Mahabharata, also in this play) left it, so P. L. Deshpande suggested my name to Dubey. That was the first time I met Dubey. He came to my house and said, ‘You have to do it in four days. You have to leave today.’ I said no at first, because my four year old son was ill. At that time Arvindji (Arvind Deshpande), my husband, used to work in experimental theatre too, which there’s no money in. This was reformist theatre, in a way. He said, ‘Go, because Nandikar’s is a very big festival in Calcutta and this team is representing Bombay and that too in Hindi.’ He would take leave from office to take care of our son. So, in four days, I prepared myself for the role of Gandhari. There was tremendous applause at the festival. After this I did two or three more Hindi plays with Dubey.\n\nWhat was your first professional play— in Marathi or Hindi?\n\nThat was in Marathi: Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe. I had done work on two state level plays before this, but they were for amateur competitions. Even they happened quite late, because I was a teacher for 15 years in the Chhabildas Girls’ School, where I had studied as well. Incidentally, this was one of the reasons why our group was later able to get Chhabildas Hall, for 18 years, to rehearse our plays. That’s how our theatre movement came to be called the Chhabildas Theatre Movement.\n\nComing back, 1967 was when work began on Shantata… (Vijay) Tendulkarji’s play. It was supposed to contest in a government competition (the State Drama Competition, Maharashtra). It was an unusual play for its times, but it won an award for best play and I won one for my role as Benare, the central character. In about four months, appreciation flowed in from all over the country.\n\nShantata… has a story behind it. After Vijayaji (Vijaya Mehta) left the theatre group Rangayan because of her marriage, Arvindji eventually came to be in charge of it. He did two or three plays and this was the last one. He said to me, ‘There’s no money, in this field, but there is this government competition. We have good actors. Our writer is also good. So if we win a place in the competition, we will get award money and with that we can do more work.’ There were 77 people (in the group) in all, and their finances weren’t in a good state. Vijay (Tendulkar) wasn’t in a good state of mind then either. His elder brother was ill. But everyone insisted that he write and send in something, so he wrote the first act. There wasn’t much to it— no drama.\n\nSo in the 21-22 days the show was supposed to take place in, Tendulkar would write all night and Arun Kakde, who stayed next door to Tendulkar, in Vile Parle, would come in the morning, before the milkman arrived, to deliver bits of the script to Arvindji. Arvindji would work on these bits in the evening after his office hours, make notes, prepare them for the next day’s rehearsal. At night he would explain the characters to me. By the end of it I remembered everyone’s lines and knew all the characters. I wasn’t scared of doing the main role.\n\nBut what I found really challenging was that Benare, my character, doesn’t say anything throughout the play. She is not heard. She just sits there. In fact, in the final courtroom scene, the judge says: ‘You have 20 seconds. Say whatever you want to say.’ And even then, for twenty seconds, Benare says nothing. Yet Arvindji said that just one look would explain everything about Benare’s history and her life. It’s okay if she doesn’t speak, he said, she can speak with her mind.\n\nTendulkar, however, didn’t like that she didn’t say anything even at the end. So there was a big fight between them (Tendulkar and Arvind), because 21 days were nearly up and everything had to be ready. And, with two days left for the play to open, he had nearly finished the third act but still hadn’t given in the end. The way things stood then, the play would have had to end after Benare’s 20 seconds of silence. So, when Tendulkarji came to see the rehearsal, everyone shut him in the hall in which we were rehearsing in. Arvindji said, ‘Write the end and only then come out. Till then we’ll do the rehearsal outside.’ After half an hour, or 45 minutes, Tendulkar came out and gave it to him, and left without saying a word. We thought he was angry, but that wasn’t the case. The truth was his elder brother had passed away, and he was grieving. Even then he wrote it. In fact, I also knew the play really well by the date of performance because Tendulkar had explained everything to us as well, right down to the movements…\n\nShantata! Court Chalu Aahe went on to be translated into 13 languages. We made it in Hindi. And then someone took on the play for 100 shows. Then we did 150 shows. And then Rangayan shut down and a new theatre group called Awishkar was begun by us. I had suggested the name, in fact.\n\nWhat was the first film you did?\n\nShantata… in Marathi. That was the first Marathi film. The second film was in Hindi. And that was Shantata… as well. They had taken a loan from NFDC. Dubey was to direct it. In the beginning I refused to do the main role because I felt the heroine had to look good. ‘Who told you that?’ Dubey said. I said, ‘I’ve seen it in so many films. Heroines are chosen this way. And you have taken a loan for this play. Me playing the lead would be okay for an experimental play but not for a film because you’ll have to pay this loan back. I’ll give you some names, they do good work, and they look good too.’ But both the names I gave him said they wouldn’t do it and Dubey was in a fix. So I agreed.\n\nGovind Nihalani was cinematographer on Shantata… and you’ve worked on other films of his later on. With him as well as with Shyam Benegal. How did those roles come about?\n\nGovind Nihalaniji was a part of Arvindji‘s and my circle. We were close friends. We were all at a party, once, at Juhu Hotel. Govindji, me and Amrish Puri were talking so that both of them were looking at me and I was facing the buffet table. Now, when the waiter came he put paraffin into the fire under one of the dishes on the buffet, to heat it, and it exploded into flames. My face and Govind’s back were burnt.\n\nGovind had just arrived in Bombay then and didn’t have anyone in the city. So he stayed at our home for one and a half months, recovering. Shyam Benegal’s Kondura had started filming, at a village near Madras and Govind was a cameraman on it. He left for the site once his back was okay. I was avoiding work still. Though my face was mostly fine, my eyebrows had been burnt and I was uneasy about getting back on stage or screen.\n\nShyam phoned, asking me to come there. Govind said, ‘Come. You can just enjoy yourself with us.’ Once I reached there Shyam said, ‘Call the makeup man.’ When I asked why, he said: ‘Did I call you here to eat for free? I’ve called you for work.’ I said, ‘You know, you can see my face, how it is… ’ Shyam still insisted on getting my make up done, and immediately after took a picture and showed me. ‘Can you see any difference? No, right? I need Sulabha just as she really is. Come. Let’s start work.’ So that’s how I ended up acting in Kondura. Shyam later said he had really wanted a very natural look anyhow.\n\nYou directed a children’s film called Raja Rani Ko Chahiye Pasina.\n\nI used to direct children’s plays. This was one of them that Tendulkarji had written. It was a Marathi educational play that was later translated into Hindi. So V. Shantaram saw the play and said, ‘I want to make a film based on this play. Will you do it?’ But I had never directed a film so I took a month or so first, to figure how to adapt it from theatre to film. It had to be like the play, but it couldn’t be exactly like it. So Tendulkarji and I reworked the script. The story is that the king and the queen don’t have any children. And someone says it’s only when you sweat that you’ll have a child. So they want to sweat and to be able to do so they travel, search for the answer… in the end they learn that without work it’s not possible to sweat…\n\nWe went to Shantaram’s office. It had huge doors and there was his famous cage(a golden cage with a parrot in it)outside the office. Shantaram looked at the script and said, ‘However you want to do it, go ahead.’ And on the first day, when we took the first shot, he was watching us from his office on the first floor. It was very sunny and he had this flat hat which he sent down to me. So I wore the hat and began work. Someone took a photo of me in that hat. Someone also said, ‘You are wearing V. Shantaram’s hat. You are making his picture. So now we need to salute you too.’\n\nYou have worked with Smita Patil in several movies. What are your memories of her as a co-actor or as a friend?\n\nSmita wasn’t exceptionally beautiful but she was very attractive. She was seedhi saadhi (simple) and didn’t really bother about how to be stylish, how to dress. But she was a fantastic actress. Her parents were social workers and right from childhood she wanted to help whoever she could. Her mother had told me of an incident from when she was a nurse and Smita was four or five years old. Smita had heard about a woman in the hospital in which her mother worked, who had had a third daughter and so no one was coming to see her (because she had given birth to yet another daughter, instead of a son). So Smita’s mother had made tea and Smita kept a portion of it separately. Her mother asked whom she was keeping it for and Smita told her about the woman who had given birth to a third daughter. She was crying about this. So she went to visit the woman with her mother.\n\nIn Pet Pyar aur Paap, she was playing a garbage collector. On set there was a hut and the garbage that piled up outside it was very dirty. Smita put her hand in it and I said, ‘Don’t do that. There’s no place to wash your hands. You want to do your work well, fine, but don’t put your hand in dirt.’ She said, ‘Sulabha Tai, do you know where the director is standing? Right in the middle of a puddle, because that’s where the camera is. He’s going to take a shot of me. I shouldn’t be complaining.’\n\nThe last film I did with her was Bheegi Palken. After my last scene in the movie with her was done, as I was leaving, I noticed Smita searching for something frantically. She said, ‘I had kept my mangalsutra here and now I can’t find it.’ Her shot was ready and waiting so I gave her my mangalsutra, saying she could return it whenever we met next. But after this she fell ill. I went to see her in the hospital and I remember there was a bottle there (near her bed). I asked her for what it was and she said, ‘Cough medicine.’ I said, ‘But you don’t have cough.’ She said, ‘I don’t have a cough, but I’m not getting any sleep that’s why I’m taking it. It’s good if I can get some sleep.’ I remember saying, ‘It’s not good at all. You’re having a child. Don’t do this.’ I knew there were personal problems she was going through, even though she didn’t tell me herself. She used to drink a lot of the cough syrup, and then sleep. Then her son Prateik was born. He was only 10 days old when she passed away.\n\nAfter she was gone, I got a phone call from her mother. She said, ‘Smita has left something for you— tied in a cloth. And on that she has written your name.’ I had forgotten about the mangalsutra by then and said, ‘There was nothing of mine with her.’ But she said, ‘Your name is written on it, so it must be something.’ She gave it to me, I opened it, and in the cloth was my mangalsutra.\n\nYour last Hindi film role was in English-Vinglish. How did that come about? Also, your character was different from the typical mother-in-law that we see in the movies. Do you feel women are getting more interesting parts in mainstream Hindi cinema?\n\nThere are lots of different roles nowadays for women. Gauri (Shinde, the director) just said: ‘I have faith in you, and there should be one Marathi (actor) in this film (because the central family in the film was a Marathi family). It’s a small role.’ But there’s no such thing as a small role. She never told me what to do. She just told me about the role and the scene. Everyone likes this film, I feel, because everyone relates to it in some way. And true— I’m a different kind of mother-in-law in the movie.\n\nWhat has been your most challenging film role so far?\n\nI got a call from NFDC about a Kannada film where the director (Vasant Mokashi) wanted me for the main role. That was Gangavva Gangamayi. It won 16 awards. The character I played, the lead, was an old woman. I didn’t know one word of Kannada and I wasn’t comfortable. I said I couldn’t do it in the beginning. After four days the director came to my house. He said, ‘Please do it.’ I said, ‘How can I do it? I don’t even know the language, and you want me to do the main role.’ He said, ‘This story has been written by my father. It’s won an award. My mother said, ‘Give this role of Gangavva, to this Marathi actress that I’ve seen. She should do it.’ I don’t know why my mother said that and what work of yours she’s seen. But I’m doing this for her. How many days will you take to learn to speak the language?’ I told him it would take me two months, but first I would need the script and to find a lady who can speak both Marathi and Kannada.’ So they found a professor who knew Marathi and Kannada very well. The crew wrote my lines in Devanagari and they recorded them for me so I knew how to say them. I, on my part, worked hard at all of this for one and a half months. But I still didn’t have any confidence. I told them during the shoot, ‘Next to the camera, there must be a light cutter (a black sheet on a stand, to cut out excess light while shooting) with my lines and cues written in big letters. I won’t read it, but I need the confidence of knowing that that is there.’ They agreed to this.\n\nI remember there was a big scene, where my character says something very angrily. While talking, I looked from left to right, and the camera was on a trolley. It was moving from a long to a close to an extreme long shot. After I had finished, the cutter had to be moved between shots. But while doing the next shot I realized that there was no cutter there. And so I got nervous and forgot my lines and began to speak in Hindi. And the people who were watching started laughing because they didn’t know that I was Maharashtrian. Whatever they had heard till then was in Kannada— so they thought I knew Kannada. Then the director made everyone get out and did a tight close up.\n\nI had said to the director at first that I’d do it but they’d have to get a good artist to do the dub. So they had arranged for a big Kannada actress to do it. But then I tried to do the dubbing myself. After listening to it for one or two months they said, ‘Sulabhaji’s done very well. Her voice can be used.’\n\nNow, I did another film and there was a Kannada actress working on that. And she said to me, ‘Haven’t you heard, a Maharashtrian actress has won an award for a Kannada film. I haven’t seen the film but the actress who played the role of Gangavva, she’s Maharashtrian. And still I got second place.’ She didn’t know I was the same actress.\n\nFilmmaker Shyam Benegal’s lecture on a hundred years of Indian Cinema delivered at Victoria Memorial, Kolkata\n\nThe Beginning\n\nWhen cinema was brought to India three years after its invention, in 1896, for a demonstration at the Watson’s hotel in Bombay, no one would have predicted that within a period of 75 years India would become the largest film producer in the world with films regularly made in over 22 languages every year. Soon after its first demonstration, several technologically minded Indians were already tinkering with film cameras of the time. The first known film was actually a filmstrip shot in 1901 which showed a mathematician, Wrangler Paranjpe, coming down the gangway of a ship at Bombay’s Apollo Bunder. From the novelty of recording live moving images on film to using film technology to tell stories and complex narratives was a fairly short step.\n\nAmong the pioneers were a number of theatre entrepreneurs both in Bombay and Calcutta who attempted to make films specially for Indian audiences. Eventually it was Dadasaheb Phalke who preceded all others with Raja Harishchandra which he released in 1913.\n\nBarely a year after Raja Harishchandra was released, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India.\n\nEarly 20th century was a period when the nationalist movement gathered steam. The demand for swaraj or self-rule became the anthem. Among the political strategies, and actions that nationalist groups undertook, was to boycott British-made cloth and other goods. Large bonfires would be made of videshi or foreign goods. The word swadeshi gained currency. To rely on oneself and to be self-sufficient, became an integral part of the nationalist agenda. Gandhiji’s political strategy aimed at regaining Indian self-esteem with the privileging of the charkha as the symbol of resistance.\n\nIndian cinema in many ways grew in size and strength much like the freedom movement. Making films indigenously, like the setting up of the steel industry by Jamsetji Tata, could be seen as a nationalist act. When Dadasabeb Phalke chose to make films on mythological subjects, consciously or unconsciously he was asserting the primacy of Indian traditions and culture. Even films that dealt with contemporary and topical subjects, tended to be critical of the slavish adoption of colonial fashions and lifestyles. For instance Dhiren Ganguly’s film Bilat Ferat, or ‘England Returned’, satirized people with westernized tastes. It became the first film to be caught up in colonial censorship. A few years later, Bhalji Pendharkar’s Vande Mataram Ashram was banned, evidently viewed as a threat to the British government. This led to the creation of a censor board for cinema by the colonial government which ironically continues to this day, nearly 66 years after India became independent.\n\nIdeas of social reform influenced by the nationalist movement often found voice in films, both in Bombay and Calcutta. Filmmakers like Baburao Painter in Kolhapur and Pune, and later the legendary V Shantaram who learnt filmmaking from Baburao Painter, made several films that critiqued caste attitudes and adopted reformist views when it came to traditional inequalities in both caste and gender relations. Quite a number of filmmakers chose stories of medieval saints in order to cleanse what they considered were corrupt social practices in contemporary Indian society.\n\nBy the time sound came to cinema at the beginning of the 1930s, cinema had established itself as a prime entertainment medium in the major cities of India. Soon it would cover all of urban India.\n\nThe Advent of Sound\n\nWith sound, came song and dialogue. Both these elements were to become integral to Indian cinema. Alam Ara— the first ‘sound film’ made in 1931, had over 30 songs.\n\nSongs and rhetorical dialogue, which were the staple of successful theatrical productions, were taken wholesale by Indian cinema. This gave it distinct character. It was around the same time that films in regional languages started to be made. Unlike silent films, which could be shown all over the country, regional films could not be shown beyond the regions where the language was spoken. It was also during this time that the freedom movement under the Congress had resolved to make Hindustani the national language of the country. Thus films made in Hindustani could see themselves as ‘all-India films’. To succeed they had to design themselves for pan-Indian appeal.\n\nStrangely enough, Hindustani films were produced in cities such as Bombay and Calcutta where the commonly spoken language was neither Hindi nor Urdu. As a consequence filmmakers had to opt for an idiom that was simple and easily understood across the board. Both these cities had a flourishing theatrical tradition from the mid-19th century that was patronized by the urban elite— the Parsi-Urdu theatre. Combined with local theatrical forms this had become the basis for Indian cinematic form. In Bombay there was a flourishing Gujarati Bhangwadi theatre and the musical Natya theatre in Marathi. Both these forms went on to become models for the unique character that popular Indian cinema would take on.\n\nWhile mythologicals and costume dramas were easily made with clearly set models from urban and rural theatrical genres, the real problem for Hindustani cinema lay in handling subjects of a contemporary nature. Making a pan-Indian film meant the construction of an environment and a culture that would be acceptable all over the country. Clearly, this invented national culture was a construct that glossed over a great deal of the diversity that was part of India. People were presented in a generalized and eventually standardized way that would not identify them with any recognizable region. They were quite simply urban or rural, rich or poor, or identified by the social class to which they belonged, though admittedly the standard Hindi-Urdu idiom of these films marked them in unacknowledged ways as upper-caste, middle-class, and ‘North Indian’. They only had first names and no surnames. Surnames would give away their caste, community and their regional origin. The only other identification was their religion. Hindustani films represented India in much the same way the nationalist movement did, identified mainly by the two communities, Hindu and Muslim. Regional films, on the other hand, were far more culture specific and rooted in their communities in terms of subjects and their treatment. They could use their local idioms, customs, manners and conventions to make a greater claim on realism. Interestingly, successful regional films would often be remade in Hindustani, after being culturally transformed to make them accessible and acceptable in all parts of the country.\n\nMost Hindustani films that were part of the genre of family socials were domestic melodramas or love stories set in a familial milieu. The stories they told were more like parables rather than realistic narratives. In the pre-independence era a fairly large number of films dealt with socially relevant subjects such as untouchability in Achhut Kannya (Franz Osten, 1936) or the emancipation of women in Duniya Na Mane (V. Shantaram, 1937). In Achhut Kannya for instance, the glamorous Devika Rani played an untouchable girl. However, there was no attempt at credibility or realism in making her look the part. What is more, the film was directed by a German filmmaker, Franz Osten, whose ignorance of Hindustani was only matched by his lack of knowledge of local customs. The theatrical tradition of suspension of disbelief and the disregard for the historical context continues in popular cinema until today. Take a recent film like Black, released a few years ago. The family is identified as being Anglo-Indian because they speak English. Beyond this primary identification everything else is invented. An invented world, an imaginational culture devised by the director. Audiences, however, did not find this unacceptable and the film went on to become a great success. Hindustani films were accepted not because they created a credible milieu, but because they legitimized traditionally accepted social values that extolled the sanctity of the family and its primacy over the individual. Sacrificing oneself for the family—renunciation leading to redemption—were common themes in films of the time. Traditional culture as presented in popular Hindustani cinema was not so much what existed in reality as much as it represented a normative ideal, although reformist ideas would often be introduced in these films unlike in their counterpart, the ‘Muslim socials’.\n\nOften seen as a twin of the Hindu family social (yet not quite a twin), the genre of Muslim socials presented a flattering image of the Muslim community as cultivated and essentially feudal, extolling virtues once again of self-sacrifice, loyalty, friendship and family honour. Hindus and Muslims as either twins or brothers in the family of India would eventually become a recurring motif in several Indian films before and immediately after Indian independence. Films of the period like Padosi (made by V. Shantaram, 1941) and Hamrahi (by Bimal Roy, 1945) echo the theme of twins.\n\nSecularism in Indian Cinema\n\nInterestingly, the separatist politics of the Muslim League never seriously found a voice in the popular cinema, and, indeed, found ideological opposition in the cinema of the forties and fifties. For example, Prithviraj Kapoor’s play Deewar, which was subsequently made into a film by him, represented Partition as a threat to the unity of the family. It is not insignificant that writers and poets belonging to the Progressive Writers Group and the Indian People’s Theatre Association came into the cinema at about that time. Writers like Saadat Hasan Manto, Ali SardarJafri, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Sahir Ludhianvi, Kaifi Azmi, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and others brought a politically left-wing and overtly secular outlook to the films they were associated with. While most of them remained active in the cinema over the years, their early attempts were largely unsuccessful at the box office because of the radical views they propagated. Popular cinema could not afford to give up the traditional values that were part of its appeal to the mass audience. Thus for example, when the eminent novelist Premchand wrote the script for Mazdoor (made by Mohan Bhavnani in 1934), it sank without a trace. Similarly, Saadat Hasan Manto’s attempts to subvert the Muslim social with films like Najma (Mehboob Khan, 1943) and Naukar (Shaukat Hussain Rizvi, 1943) did not meet with commercial success.\n\nWith Partition and Independence, a substantial section of the Muslim population became citizens of Pakistan, and India found itself with an overwhelmingly large majority of Hindus. One significant and far-reaching consequence of the division of the country along religious lines was that there was an increased ambivalence towards the minority Muslim community. Indian Muslims were perceived as continuing to have a choice in the matter of citizenship— they could either remain in India or emigrate to Pakistan. Their allegiance to the country was not taken for granted as easily as it was with the other religious groups; thus their nationalism was always suspect and needed to be ritually reaffirmed or proven. Simultaneously, the protection of minorities, a commitment under the Indian Constitution, became the most important aspect of the newly affirmed secular State. This posed several problems for the Hindi cinema. How were Muslims to be depicted in the Cinema? There was an awkward formality and a great deal of self-censorship in the way they were shown. Part of the problem had to do with political correctness and a desire not to offend— Muslim characters were routinely shown as sane, sensible, good and devout. During the Nehruvian era, many films, especially those that were written by progressive writers, strived to create the image of a secular Muslim. For instance in the 1959 film, Dhool Ka Phool (late Yash Chopra’s first film), an old Muslim adopts an abandoned child whose religious antecedents are not known and sings a song to the boy, which in effect goes, “You will not grow up to be either a Muslim or Hindu; you are the son of man, so a human being you shall be”. There was a great deal of tokenism as well with Muslim characters playing walk-on parts in attempts to represent the diversity of Indian society in cinema. Such sanitized representations were also due, in part, to the constraints of the Government’s Censor Board, which would come down heavily on what it interpreted as negative characterizations of members of any minority community (Christians, on the other hand, were often depicted as good-hearted drunks, presumably because Christianity had no strictures against drinking alcohol).\n\nCommunal harmony thus became a kind of signature in a large number of films during the fifties and the sixties. Hindi cinema soon came to be seen as a socially integrating force and the National Awards instituted for films by the Government of India included one that was given for promoting national integration. Interestingly enough, while Hindi films found it difficult to deal with ordinary Hindu-Muslim relationships without sanitizing them, there was no such inhibition in the regional cinemas. In Kerala, where there is a sizeable Muslim and Christian population, inter-communal relationships were depicted in a far more direct and credible way. Ramu Kariat made films like Moodupaadam (1963) and Chemmeen (1965) that centered on inter-communal love stories. This was possible because Kerala had not been affected by the trauma of Partition despite having communal and caste-based parties and associations, and perhaps, also because Malayalam films did not seek to represent themselves as ‘India— the nation’. Muslims in Kerala did not experience the kind of social insecurity and diffidence that sections of the Muslim community felt in northern India after Partition. By contrast, Hindi cinema was self-consciously secular in its attempt to make the minority Muslim community feel accepted and socially secure, yet it often reflected and performed a paternalistic duty of the avowedly secular Indian State towards Muslims. Consequently, benign as it may have appeared, the secularism of the Hindi cinema of this era reflected to a large extent the secularism of the State, which was at best patronizing. This formulaic representation of Muslims and other religious minorities continued through the fifties and the sixties.\n\nIt was not until the early seventies that things began to change and Hindi cinema found it possible to tackle subjects related to Partition and the contemporary Muslim experience, which until then were considered awkward subjects liable to inflame communal passions. Two significant developments paved the way for an alternative politics of minoritarian representation: one— the creation of State-established institutions like the Film and Television Institute and the Film Finance Corporation that enabled the emergence of the ‘new cinema’, two— the second partition of the subcontinent in 1971 that led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nLet me lay out some of the material conditions that led to the emergence of the new cinema, and then provide a brief survey of some of the more important films that placed minority communities at the center of their narratives. I would also like to examine the significance of the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 and how it made possible the production of films like Garm Hava that treated the subject of Partition in a realistic manner for the first time in Hindi cinema.\n\nTo understand the importance of the new cinema, it would be important to situate some of the developments that took place in the cinema of the post-independence period. Indian cinema was already a flourishing industry at the time of independence. It was totally market driven and unregulated. Financial booms and busts were quite frequent. This prompted the Government of India to set up a committee to look into the affairs of the film business. The committee made several far reaching recommendations that would set the course for cinema in the next fifty years. Among the recommendations were the setting up of a fund to finance films, an institution for teaching filmmaking, a children’s film society to encourage filmmakers to make children’s films, the creation of a national film archive, and so on. There were other recommendations too, which were not particularly helpful to the cinema, such as the levy of an entertainment tax on film screenings. Since cinema was not understood to be socially productive by the State, the tax was somewhat punitive in nature. Moreover, since the state governments (not the central government) levied the entertainment tax, it varied from state to state— 55% of the price of a ticket in Maharashtra, going up to 132% in Uttar Pradesh and 146% in Bihar. (The centre is now recommending a 30% Tax across the country). The government, in effect, ended up by earning much more from films than either the film producers, distributors or exhibitors. As a result, the old studio system became unsustainable and gave way to independent entrepreneurs and speculators. Filmmaking became a far more speculative and high-risk business than it had ever been in the past. In spite of this, the film business grew by about eight to 10 percent each year due to the phenomenal growth of cities, towns and new urban townships in the wake of industrialization and other programs of economic development. The complexion of the audience too began to change. The older middle class was no longer the arbiter of taste in the cinema. A growing new middle class, an increasing working class and vast numbers of recent immigrants from the countryside into towns started to play their part in determining the aesthetics of the cinema. Films had to meet their entertainment needs since they constituted the largest segment of the audience. The effect of all this started to be felt in the popular cinema of the sixties. The common denominator of films got lowered, and widened to appeal to the largest number of people. Consequently, there was a growing concern in the State establishment that the increasing number of films being made each year did not indicate any improvement in the quality of cinema. The most frequent criticism was that the popular cinema aped and plagiarized Hollywood films and was not Indian enough. This concern paved the way for State sponsored funding agencies that would help promote a different kind of cinema, one which was not necessarily designed to meet the perceived demands of the marketplace.\n\nBy this time Satyajit Ray had arrived on the scene with his highly celebrated cinematic works. His films were not only successful at the box office in his native Bengal but were critically acclaimed all over the world. Ray’s films along with those of his two other contemporaries Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen were not simply vehicles of mass entertainment. Apart from their artistic qualities, they were seen as closer to Indian reality and life. Ironically, given Ray’s own resolute sense of Bengali identification, for cineastes and critics outside India, Ray’s films represented India. Ray’s cinematic aesthetics thus set the tone for the various institutions that the State established for the cinema. The most significant of these were the Film and Television Institute and the Film Finance Corporation. By the beginning of the 1970s graduates from the Film Institute were making films funded by the Film Finance Corporation, which attempted to provide a more realistic depiction of contemporary Indian life. Moreover, after 1971, another factor helped in boosting the prospects of such films. The import of foreign films was cut down drastically, leaving a large number of cinemas, particularly in metropolitan cities, with available playing time. These cinemas catered mainly to a niche audience whose taste did not extend to popular Hindi cinema. Encouraged by the response, several private producers began funding films of this kind. All my films made in the seventies and the eighties were funded by such producers.\n\nIf popular cinema worked on the basis of tried and tested formulas in which religious and ethnic minorities rarely, if ever, took centre stage (if a Muslim was to be the protagonist in a film, it could only be in a Muslim social), what was specially significant about the new cinema was that, freed of the constraints of the marketplace, it was able to take on a variety of complex social subjects. In 1969, Mani Kaul, a graduate from the Film Institute made his first film Uski Roti in which the central character was a Sikh, which in itself became a political statement against the unmarked Hindu hero of much popular Hindi cinema. One of the most significant films to be financed by the Film Finance Corporation was M.S. Sathyu’s Garm Hava (1973). It was the first film to grapple with the experience of Indian Muslims in the immediate aftermath of the Partition. As I mentioned earlier, until Garm Hava was made, Muslim characters in popular Hindi films were routinely depicted in token roles, and often without blemish. In this way they were separated from the community, effectively making them the “other” and not part of us.\n\nBased on a short story by Ismat Chughtai and written by Kaifi Azmi, Garm Hava attempted to recreate the predicament of a North Indian Muslim family reacting and responding to the extraordinary circumstances during the time of Partition. The family has to make the painful choice— whether to stay on in their ancestral home in Agra, or leave for Pakistan. The film’s narrative maps the gradual break up and division of the large joint family as individual members depart for Pakistan for various reasons; however, unlike his relatives, the protagonist Salim Mirza refuses to migrate to the new Muslim nation given his attachment to his place. The film traces the gradual breakdown of Salim Mirza’s fortitude in an atmosphere of growing distrust and suspicion against Muslims in post-Partition India, leading to his eventually painful decision to emigrate along with whatever is left of his family. However, inspired by a communist procession affirming the solidarity of the oppressed, the film’s final sequence has Mirza and his younger son Sikandar reversing their decision in spite of all their travails. Despite its affirmative secular-nationalist closure, Garm Hava remains the only film to address the plight of Muslims in post-Partition India in the early years after independence. Ironically, the film found itself in a great deal of trouble with a section of the Muslim community who appealed to the government to ban the film. The censors themselves could not make up their mind; it was a number of years later that the film was finally released. When it did get to be seen all over the country it was via television.\n\nIf the establishment of State funded agencies aided the production of films like Garm Hava, it is my suggestion that a historical moment was also an important contributory factor that enabled the film’s production. It is not insignificant that Garm Hava was produced after the 1971 creation of Bangladesh. While the first two decades after Independence continued to be a period of migrations for Muslims, as Pakistan was still an option, this option effectively disappeared after the creation of Bangladesh. In addition, this new partition—this time of Pakistan—along linguistic lines also aided in containing some of the anxieties around Indian Muslims. The commitment of Muslims to India was suddenly no longer a matter of doubt or nationalist anxiety, and therefore Sathyu could choose to take on a topic that until then had been avoided or only referred to in oblique gestures by most popular filmmakers. A film of this kind would have been impossible to make before 1971.\n\nSeveral stories dealing with contemporary Muslim experience found articulation during the seventies and the eighties in the new cinema. Muzaffar Ali made Gaman (1978) and Anjuman (1986): the former about a Muslim taxi driver in Mumbai and the latter documenting the life of Muslim chikan workers in Lucknow. Satyajit Ray made Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977) set in 1857, based on a Premchand story, and I made Junoon (1978) on incidents in an Uttar Pradesh cantonment town that related the experiences of various communities— Hindus, Muslims, Anglo-Indians and the British who found themselves caught up in the uprising. Soon after, Saeed Mirza made the film Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980) about a Goan Catholic family in Mumbai, and later made Salim Langde Par Mat Ro (1989) on a young thief in a Muslim ghetto. I made a film called Trikal (1985) on a privileged Catholic family set in a Goan village at the time of the liberation of Goa. The earlier diffidence that filmmakers felt in tackling subjects dealing with minority communities was replaced with a new confidence. Sterile representations of the minorities, very much a part of the Indian cinema before 1971, were replaced by films on ordinary people grappling with the problems of life and change in a modernizing world. Several of the films I mentioned earlier had a favourable audience response and some of them were reasonable box office successes.\n\nHowever, the first film to take up the issue of the Hindu-Muslim divide during Partition was a mini series based on Bhisham Sahni’s novel, Tamas by Govind Nihalani (1987). Fortunately for the series it did not require to be cleared by the Film Censor Board as it was made for television, otherwise the censors would have banned it on grounds that it showed hostility between the communities. While the national television channel Doordarshan was considering telecasting it, militant Hindu groups and some of their affiliates and other constituents, objected violently to the screening. Nihalani’s apartment in Mumbai was attacked and threats were issued against his life. As a result, Doordarshan decided against showing the series citing a threat to peace as right-wing Hindu organizations had also threatened to burn down the television station. Nihalani went to court and the Bombay High Court, after viewing the series, directed Doordarshan to show it as there was nothing unconstitutional in the film to warrant a ban. It was shown in its entirety on prime time to a record audience over three evenings and passed off without incident.\n\nForm and Idiom in Popular Cinema\n\nIndian cinema in many ways is unique to itself. It has a form and idiom that is distinct, and different from all other international cinematic forms and idioms. This has a great deal to do with how and what we in India popularly consider as entertainment.\n\nIn all our traditional arts, particularly the performing arts, entertainment is quantified as a combination of the essences of nine basic emotions or navrasas. Complete entertainment is possible only when the nine emotions of love, hate, joy, sorrow, pity, disgust, fear, anger and compassion are blended in different ways around a predominant emotion. The main emotion could be love or valour but without being complemented by the others neither is it defined, nor experienced. Popular Indian Cinema like other traditional arts is an heir to this tradition. The plots and story lines are used as pegs to hang various emotional ingredients that make up for entertainment.\n\nUntil fairly recently, most narratives in popular cinema had plot lines largely taken from traditional romances and melodramas that did not require any specific context. Since most plot movements were known, they tended to be predictable. What made one film different from the other were largely the improvisatory elements that came in since most scenes and dialogues were written as the film was being shot. Since film lends itself to spectacle more easily than theatrical productions, it became an integral part of popular cinema. The unfolding of the story itself took place through a series of incidents which were woven together by means of co-incidences, accidents and through songs and dances. Audiences in India have always been accustomed to this form of cinematic narrative almost since the very beginning of cinema.\n\nThe psychoanalyst, Sudhir Kakar, says, (Popular Indian) cinema presents a collective fantasy— a group daydream, containing unconscious material and the hidden wishes of a vast number of people.\n\nI quote: “The depiction of the external world may be flawed; their relevance to the external life of the viewer remote, yet the popular Hindi film demonstrates a confident and sure-footed grasp of the topography of the changing circumstances of desire… It is the world of imagination fuelled by desire. The relationship between collective fantasy of Hindi films and Indian culture is complex. Though itself a cultural product, Hindi film has shaped culture in an unprecedented way.”\n\nAs I said earlier, for many years most popular Hindi films were peopled by characters who had no surnames that would give away their caste and region. This lack of differentiation, except when it came to religion, was designed to create a larger homogenous Indian identity that could be identified by people in different parts of India. Suppressing traditional identities was seen as helping to create a single national identity and inculcate a patriotic spirit. Most film narratives, were broadly speaking, either rural or urban morality tales in which good overcame evil at the end with all the turns and twists in the tale. Traditional morality was sacrosanct even if only lip service was paid to it.\n\nAshis Nandy has an interesting observation to make about the duality of the rational self (which is modern) as against the secret self (which is traditional) in contemporary Indian literature and films. He suggests that the secret self represents the deep-seated traditional attitudes that appear as subtexts in contemporary works. The rational self would be conscious and overt while the secret self would be unconscious and covert or, as the philosopher Dr Akeel Bilgrami reminded me, may even be the disowned self. I would rather call it the unacknowledged self. This exists in all of popular cinema. I am personally of the opinion that without the subtext of the secret and covert self no film can strike a chord in the Indian audience, nor would it have a chance of popular success. Often what may seem simplistic and banal may possess a complexity that may not seem obviously evident.\n\nA few years ago, the eminent film critic, the late Chidananda Dasgupta wrote: “The Indian cinema never succeeded in emerging into the area of national resurgence in the way painting, dance, drama or music did… (The language of the cinema) was held back by the very fact that it is a modern, industrial, technological medium imported from the West. Not being a traditional medium, there was no ready base for an understanding of it as a new language. The absorption of the cinema into Indian culture was made difficult by the absence of an industrial-technological culture. Grafted on to an agricultural country, it failed to develop a valid artistic form, a cultural contact point with tradition or with reality, it subsisted on an imitation of the West, mainly Hollywood, without producing the fusion of art and box office that Hollywood often represented… The cinema lived in partly enforced isolation (in British India), enclosed comfortably within its own standards. The absence of film culture was as marked as the physical spread of commercial formula-bound cinema.”\n\nEven earlier, speaking on Indian cinema in 1929, Rabindranath Tagore commented, ‘Form in Art changes according to the means it uses. I believe that the new art that could be expected to develop out of the motion picture has not yet made its appearance. In politics we are looking for Independence, in Art we must do the same. Every Art seeks to find its own independent manner of expression within the world it creates; otherwise its self-expression is undermined for lack of confidence in itself… No creative genius has yet arrived to deliver it from its bondage. This act of rescue will not be easy, because in poetry, painting and music the means are not expensive, whereas in the cinema, one needs not only creativity, but financial capital as well.”\n\nWhile agreeing with several assumptions made by both Dasgupta and Tagore, one cannot brush aside the incredible hold that Indian cinema has not only on the Indian population but on the entire region of South Asia. It is true that Indian cinema developed in a largely agrarian society in a somewhat enforced isolation from the industrial-technological society of its origin. It was taken to enthusiastically by its early practitioners who were part of a newly emerging urban middle class in the commercial cities of Bombay and Calcutta. And it was the urban middle classes who owed their origin to the colonial policies of British India that determined the agenda for Indian cinema in its infancy.\n\nAlthough the urban middle classes have grown exponentially in the last hundred years and their cultural characteristics have become far more complex, they have continued to remain the predominant influence in the shaping of Indian cinema. Initially, Indian silent cinema was imitative and mimetic of the form it was taking in the West, but soon enough, filmmakers started to look at the existent theatrical entertainment forms that were most successful in urban India at the time. Having appropriated this form, Indian cinema did not have to look any further. This is probably what prompted Chidananda Dasgupta to remark as I quoted earlier, “(to remain) enclosed comfortably within its own standards” and Rabindranath Tagore to bemoan the fact that “the new art that could be expected to develop out of the motion picture has not yet made its appearance.”\n\nBy and large, film critics in India have claimed that the forms of popular Indian film did not emerge from the aesthetic and narrative capabilities inherent in cinematic expression as much as it did from Indian theatre prior to the arrival of cinema. Therefore it was difficult to explain in post renaissance western aesthetic terms or in the context of international cinema.\n\nThe classical definition of entertainment in Indian aesthetics is a blend of nine rasas. This has always been integral to Indian film. In some way this has inhibited the development of genres in Indian films. All this was soon going to change.\n\nIndian Cinema Today\n\nThe last decade and a half has been a time of great change in the cinema as it has been in Indian society. Economic liberalization has led to growth that was unthinkable earlier. A much greater confidence in the nation’s ability to survive and the widespread acceptance of democracy in the body politic, despite pockets of extreme dissatisfaction, can be attributed to the phenomenal growth of the middle class— at last count a larger community than the entire population of the United States. The dissatisfaction of the urban young has more to do with a demand for better governance rather than a rejection of democracy. Alongside, print and electronic media has grown exponentially, saturating the entire media space of the country. From being part of popular culture, cinema, like soap operas and other forms of entertainment and current affairs programming on television, has become a part of mass culture. Film as a cultural artifact has gotten subsumed by its value and worth as a commodity. The effectiveness of cinema in persuasive communication makes it an ideal vehicle for promoting lifestyles. Popular film stars become brands. As brands they promote the sale of any number of products and services often overshadowing their primary profession as actors. They are often valued more as brands than as actors.\n\nLike all aspects of mass culture, it thrives on standardization, inevitably leading to the creation of a single dominant culture. With cultural homogenization and the growth of consumerism, a new set of values has come into being that equates moneymaking with success; media exposure with fame. To be a celebrity you do not need any kind of achievement. Making money is at a premium. Those who cannot make money are automatically excluded.\n\nMainstream films in recent years have begun to reflect these views. Many of them are peopled with characters that live trans-nationally in considerable material comfort. The only requirement is the ability to accumulate wealth. With wealth you have great social and political influence. The pursuit of these attributes becomes the highest aspiration for the young. Well-being is portrayed in terms of expensive cars, five star comfort, travel in private aircrafts and so on.\n\nWhile this may be so, there is at the same time, an emerging group of young filmmakers who do not wish to be part of this cultural hegemony. They are making films that are neither imitative, nor are they unconcerned with reality. They are contextual, rooted, identifiable often using language and expression that belongs to the region where the film is located, choosing material often not seen as possible in film entertainment. They have become far more inclusive, both in content and form. In many ways, their postmodernism has made them uninhibited and willing to deal with subjects unthinkable earlier.\n\nThe 14th FICCI Frames, a three day annual media and entertainment conclave is on in Mumbai. FICCI Frames is hosted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FICCI’s) Entertain ment Division.\n\nThe theme of this year’s conclave is “A tryst with destiny: Engaging a billion consumers.”\n\nDay 3. March 14, 2013\n\n(See Day 2 and Day 1 Below)\n\n5:15 pm to 7:00 pm A valedictory address by Manish Tewari, Minister of Information and Broadcasting (I&B). A keynote address by Ronnie Screwvala, MD, Disney-UTV. And speeches by Uday Kumar Varma, Secretary I&B, and Uday Shankar (Chairman, FICCI-Media & Entertainment Committee). Also on the stage are Karan Johar, Filmmaker and actor Kamal Haasan, and actor Prosenjit Chatterjee.\n\nUday Shankar delivers an opening speech where he highlights the role of the Government in the Entertainment and Media industry. Although Manish Tewari isn’t able to attend the conference, I&B Secretary Uday Kumar Varma has been able to fly down from Delhi to represent the government at this last session at FICCI Frames, 2013.\n\nTewari’s recorded address is played where he apologizes for not being there as the parliament is in session. He addresses the issues raised by Shankar in the inaugural speech. He says, “This industry has the potential of absorbing the creative intellect of our youth.” The government should ensure that the growth of this industry is greater than before. He acknowledges the film industry’s role in contributing to India’s soft power. “The Indian film industry has grown not because of the government but in spite of it,” says Tewari. He assures a more expedient process for obtaining permissions for both intentional and domestic productions to do location shooting. He also acknowledges the crisis of talent in the media and entertainment industry and sees public-private partnerships as the way forward. He says that it is the private sector that should ensure adequate training in the technical aspects of film and broadcast. On the topic of freedom of speech and expression, Tewari says that his stand is that freedom of speech should include the freedom to offend but he adds that the Indian Constitution also imposes reasonable restrictions.\n\nRonnie Screwvala’s Keynote address follows. He notes that the industry has had a 12% growth but also that this is still less than that of other “sunrise industries”. One of the key subjects of discussion during the conference has been the digitization of TV, which Screwvala says will take us three to four years to monetize. He also says that 2012 was an interesting year for cinema, where good storytelling was seen, alongside big blockbusters. He says that our regional markets have grown significantly. However, he feels the industry lacks a unanimous voice. “What we need is a lot more innovation and disruptiveness,” he says. About the Rs 1000 crore box office target, Screwvala says we have the potential to achieve this target, but we can’t increase ticket prices to meet it. The challenge cinema faces is that it has to make us want to come out and watch it.\n\nUday Kumar Varma acknowledges the film industry’s disappointment with the recent budget. “My ministry is with the film industry,” he says. With regard to the completion of 100 years of cinema, Varma announces that a part of the National Museum of cinema is complete. He also says that ‘National Film Heritage Mission’ will be formally announced soon to ensure film preservation and restoration and “to make sure nothing is lost to posterity.” He says that plans are also being made for a ‘Film Shooting and Facilitation Board’ to enable a single window for the multiple permissions needed for film shoots, and to make the process easier for domestic and international producers. He says that India can become a digital hub “in terms of production.” He calls for the industry to align interests and efforts with the government in this regard.\n\nUday Shankar thanks the attendees, the delegates, the media, the organizing committee and his co-chair Karan Johar. He also thanks Bangladesh’s Information Minister, Hasanul Haq Inu for attending the event. He reiterates the importance of evolving a suitable regulatory framework for the industry. In this regard he announces on behalf of FICCI, the ‘Centre for Regulatory Excellence’ for suggesting policy changes in any regulatory framework to the government. He says that while this Centre will focus on pushing for a regulatory framework for the media and entertainment sector, it will also be open to consult other sectors.\n\n4:45 pm to 5:15 pm Valedictory Session. Filmmaker Karan Johar in conversation with actor Kajol.\n\nThe actor is attending FICCI Frames for the first time. The conversation plays out like a live version of Johar’s popular TV show, Koffee with Karan. They cover topics ranging from social media, her motherhood, film lineage, item numbers, brand endorsements to controversies. Kajol calls herself “controversy-free”. On the current crop of actors she says: “Acting has a lot to do with the kind of films you are given.” She believes that the actors have a long time to go before one can decide how good or bad they are. On how her motherhood has changed the roles she plays on screen: “There are some things that you cannot do. That is okay.”\n\nThe actor fields several questions from the audience on her comeback, her plans for the future and her relationship with Yash Raj Films. A filmmaker in the audience grabs the opportunity to offer her a role: “I thought: No one fits the role better than Kajol.”\n\n3:45 pm to 5:00 pm “The Creative Impact of HD, 4K and Beyond: A masterclass by Tony Cacciarelli, Product Marketing Manager, AJA Systems.”\n\nTony Cacciarelli begins his masterclass with a presentation on AJA Systems’ Ki Pro Quad, and the HD and 4K formats. The presentation looks at the process of working in the 4K format from shooting till editing the video. He says the move to HD led to improvements in compression technology.\n\nThe Ki Pro Quad can record video directly in a higher resolution. This allows for easier and quicker editing. The work flow is easier allowing for a single cable to carry raw data from the camera to the Ki Pro system. The same work flow applies to HD. “This means you can work in 4K in an affordable way, very fast,” says Cacciarelli.\n\nThe presentation is followed by a demo of the Ki Pro Quad. The raw footage can go directly to editing without converting it into another format. The 4K resolution doesn’t tax the system as much. Cacciarelli says that the 4K format is still a few years away from being widely employed in the US and the UK. They’re looking at the format being available at home in 2015. Japan is looking to do it in the next year. India is maybe three to four years away, he says. But it is possible to anticipate it and prepare for it, it is possible for systems to benefit from 4K for other formats. Cacciarelli adds: “I don’t like it when technology takes over the creative process.” The Ki Pro system costs approximately $ 3396.\n\n3:45 pm to 4:45 pm “Media and Entertainment: Unleashing the power of Social and Economic Change.”\n\nThe panelists are Filmmakers Mahesh Bhatt and Goutam Ghose, Jonathan Taplin (Director of Annenberg Innovation Lab, University of South Carolina), Colin Maclay (Managing Director, Berkman Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University) and actor Kiran Joneja. Sandra de Castro Buffington, Director, ‘Hollywood, Health & Society’ (a program of the USC Annenberg Norman Lear Center that leverages the power of the entertainment industry to improve the health and well-being of individuals and communities worldwide), moderates the session.\n\nBuffington shows clips from two TV series— Private Practice and Numb3rs. She cites these shows as examples of using the medium of television to successfully educate audiences on issues such as alcohol, drug abuse, breast cancer and organ donation. “These efforts create impact”, she says. “Around 10 percent of the audience of Numb3rs became organ donors.” She talks about her program ‘Hollywood, Health and Society’ at the University of South Carolina collaborating with Asian Center for Entertainment Education on a project called The Third Eye, to do the same with Bollywood and other entertainment avenues in India. Bhatt and Ghose express support for this endeavor. Bhatt says: “It is our duty to act and act we will.” Joneja feels that it is necessary to use entertainment to bring in this awareness “without the audience feeling like they are being lectured.”\n\nMaclay says: “It is a challenge to the creative industry, to not just put the story out there but to see how do you tell the story in a way that there is robust digestion and engagement with the audience.”\n\n2:15 pm to 3:30 pm “Opportunit ies for creative collaborat ion between India and the UK— case studies and new developmen ts.”\n\nThe moderator is Mark Leaver (Consultant & Creative Industries Specialist, United Kingdom Trade and Investment- UKTI). Other panelists are Samantha Perahia (Senior Production Executive, British Film Commission), Sumedha Saraogi (Sr. Vice President Global Business Dev/Co-productions at DQ Entertainment), A. K. Madhavan (CEO, Crest Animation) and Merzin Tavaria, Chief Creative Director and Co-Founder, Prime Focus.\n\nMadhavan says that the UK would be the best option for India when it came to co-productions for animation as the UK gives Indian companies a chance to co-create and co-own intellectual property. Also the UK government grants support to productions, unlike the US where there is no support from the government. Moreover there is a greater cultural connect between India and the UK.\n\nSaraogi says that the UK has a store of classic stories. “There is a huge potential in intellectual property, sitting there, waiting to be rebooted,” she says. She adds that India complements the UK in terms of bringing the right scale to co-productions.\n\nTavaria says that his experience in dealing with the UK has been great. Moreover the UK has a huge advertising and commercials community, which has demanded a lot of creative input and a lot of animation, which makes it a perfect business destination for Indian animation companies.\n\nPerahia mentions that so far collaborations have mostly been limited to Indian film crews coming to shoot a portion of their movies, on location in London. The Indo-UK co-production treaty which is already in place hasn’t been used a great deal. Madhavan asks Perahia about possibility of funding for co productions. She speaks about various funds that outside productions could avail of if they want to make films in U.K. There is funding from banks as well, but the majority of banks shied away from film funding when the financial crisis hit. The question of distribution is also put forward. Leaver talks about how the British population spends more time and money on mobiles than any other country in the world and that Indian animation companies could look at it as a possible platform. Tavaria cites Prime Focus’s work with Youtube to get a mobile feed for IPL as an example.\n\nThey examine things that may pose challenges to Indo-British collaborations. Madhavan says: “You need deep pockets to create new Intellectual Property.” Says Tavaria: “There needs to be a greater seriousness towards animation in the country. There needs to be more investment in animation in India.” An audience member asks him if he would prefer to go to countries like Singapore and Malaysia as they give better incentives to animation rather than the UK. “My answer is an emphatic ‘no’,” says Tavaria. “The UK is where the heart of animation is because it’s where the studios and clients are. These countries (like Singapore and Malaysia) haven’t created instantly recognizable properties yet.” Saraogi says the company (DQ Entertainment) is waiting to see what the effect of the new treaty is before they go ahead with their planned co-productions in animation.\n\n2:15 pm to 3:30 pm “Unleashing the Power of Data.”\n\nThe panelists are Louise Chater (Audience Research Consultant and former Head of Movie Market Research, Walt Disney Studios), Nick Burfitt (Global Director of RPD services, Kantar Media), Atul Phadnis (Founder and Chief Executive, What’s-On-India), Anandshiv Paramatma (Senior Vice President Consumer Insights, Star India), Rajesh A Rao, (Partner, IBM Global Business Services) and Ashish Khanna (Executive Vice President and Managing Partner, Communications and High Tech Group at Accenture India). The discussion is moderated by LV Krishnan, (CEO, TAM Media Research).\n\nChater says that audience research and testing is over 35 years old but it is only in recent years that the studios have paid attention to this data and used it to tweak the films they are making. Today, from script-testing to exit polls after the film’s release, there are six to seven tests done for each film. “Nothing goes out into the market that hasn’t been tested,” Chater says. Paramatma talks about how each medium has a different set of metrics and frequency for measuring the data generated: “Print is yearly, internet gives data every second and TV is weekly.” Fusing this data can provide significant socio-economic trends and insight.\n\nPhadnis says that the audience’s search pattern on TV correlates with consumption patterns in a big way: “We get to know the ‘intent to view’ which indicates the direction of future consumption.” Chater says: “That is ultimately the (kind of) measure you want.” She feels that Hollywood is yet to crack this in their audience research. Nick Burfitt, says that UK’s television service Sky has been using such data to modify the viewing behaviour of audiences. The panelists agree that the large sample sizes and data are key to understanding the complex consumption patterns of audiences and modifying content to suit their preferences.\n\n12:30 pm to 1:30 pm “Single Window Clearance: Making India easier for Film makers.”\n\nThe panelists are Colin Brown, Former British Film Commissioner, Graham Broadbent, producer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Uday Singh (MD, Motion Picture Distributor’s Association, India—a subsidiary of the MPA— which represents the interests of the six big Hollywood studios in India), filmmaker Mukesh Bhatt (also President, Film & TV Producer Guild), Catherine McDonnell (Head, Business and Legal Affairs, Fox Studios Australia) and Colin Burrows (CEO Special Treats), who is moderating the session.\n\nBhatt suggests that tourism in india can be given a great boost through location filming. He cites the example of Bollywood and Switzerland. He also recommends a partnership between filmmakers and the government towards this end. Broadbent speaks about his experience while filming The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Although he didn’t face any problems while getting initial shooting permissions, he was hampered by various government obstacles when it came to renewing shooting permissions after the permissions lapsed due to delays between pre-production and the shoots. This also had an effect on visas. The director was in India on a business visa. Casting was incomplete and yet the director was unable to leave the country because he didn’t know whether he would get a visa to return. “There was no single place (or officer in the government) to go to have a conversation with,” he says. However the actual production experience was very good. “Make it simple to come here, because we’re going to spend millions of dollars here,” Broadbent says.\n\nMcDonnell speaks about her work with Australia Film, an organization that works to make Australia a production destination. She claims it is now known as the one place to go to if the filmmaker has a problem shooting elsewhere. She also says there is a need to have a presence in LA for any country to pitch themselves as a production location. And she talks about the cost of visas in India. “I spent 450 dollars for a business visa for one week,” she says.\n\nBurrows asks Bhatt about the government’s interest in how India projects itself on the screen. Bhatt replies, “They call us cultural ambassadors, but I don’t know what they mean about that. There’s nothing done from state or government levels— just sweet talk, they haven’t done anything.” Brown takes out a report on the British film industry and begins to read findings from it. In 2010 the film industry was responsible for a one billion dollars worth of investment in one year. “Government officials can be impervious to the charm of cinema, but they can’t be impervious to the net benefit to the economy. This is the big hammer you beat them over the head with,” he says as he holds the report up for people to see.\n\nSingh says they are working on getting business visas ready in 48 hours. “With that and post production facilities, next time he (Broadbent) can walk out of the country with a film (that’s ready to be shown),” he says.\n\n11:30 am to 12:30 pm “India— a celebrated award winning global VFX hub.”\n\nThe panelists are Akhauri Sinha (Managing Director, The Moving Picture Company, Bangalore), Gaurav Gupta, CEO (FutureWorks Media Ltd and Merzin Tavaria), Chief Creative Director and Co-founder, Prime Focus. The discussion is moderated by Biren Ghose (Country Head, Technicolor). It was also to be attended by Keitan Yadav, (COO RedChillies.vfx), but he is not present.\n\nThe panelists discuss India’s arrival on the global VFX stage. Sinha says that 10 out of 12 films in the ‘billion dollar club’ have VFX behind them: “They are the heroes of the films.” Gupta adds: “In the global stage if there is any VFX film being made, I’m sure India has a part in it”. Merzin Tavaria says: “VFX is now part of ‘production’, not just ‘post’ (production).” According to Gupta, this has happened only post 2007. But within the country itself, the use of VFX is just getting started. Tavaria: “India has to evolve into using VFX.”\n\nVFX is an industry that evolves every day and Sinha believes Indian VFX companies are moving forward from just doing back-end work on Hollywood films. “Shots are being finalized in companies in India now.” Comparing the present scenario with what happened five years ago, Ghose says walking through the studios is like “walking in dreamland”. “There are animals, mutants and superheroes.”\n\nBut the space needs a lot more investment and Sinha illustrates exactly how much with this example: “One shot of Life of Pi took more space (digital storage space, which means more money) than an entire Harry Potter film”. Tavaria, however, believes that India needs stories which allow filmmakers to use VFX creatively. Sinha agrees: “It (VFX) has to be thought of by the writers and directors in India.” But he believes that things are moving in the right direction. “Ten years ago, there was no storyboarding in (Indian) films,” he says.\n\n11.45 am to 12.30 pm Skills in M&E (Media and Entertainment)— The Next Big Leap Towards Creating Greater Talent.”\n\nThe Panel has Teri Schwartz (Dean, UCLA School of Theatre, Film &Television, USA), Jonathan Taplin (Director, Annenberg Center for Innovation, University of Southern California School of Communications & Journalism). Colin Maclay (MD, Berkman Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University), Sanjay Gupta (COO, Star India Pvt. Ltd), D J Narain (Director, FTII) Meghna Ghai Puri (President, Whistling Woods International). The moderator is Sunit Tandon, Director General, IIMC.\n\nSchwartz opens the panel by stating the need for a more inter-disciplinary media education. She calls digital movie making “a game changer” which has led to new ways of telling stories. She also says that sometimes the curriculum itself prevents the students from forming new inter-disciplinary partnerships. She says: “DIY creativity and entrepreneurship is at a high. Everyone is a media creator.” However she says there is “no getting away from one critical fact: the story matters.”\n\nTaplin says the issue which Annenberg is concerned with is “how do we create a next generation of people who have taste and ideas.” He sees Mumbai as being one of the “scenes” for developing great content. Maclay, calls himself the only “non-film person” on the panel and says that media and entertainment industries have much to learn from the digital world. He warns against dismissing film people from the digital world as that is where much of the interesting content is being created presently.\n\nSchwartz, Maclay and Taplin together speak about the importance of collaboration, community and innovation in the new media world. Gupta offers his perspective as an employer: the industry currently employs 15 lakh people but need 60 lakh more people to join the industry. “We need very high quality talent and in very high numbers,” he says. He lists three main problems facing media employers: the Human Resources practices are informal, the industry is incestuous (hiring from within itself) and there is a need to excite people about joining the industry.\n\nHe says media companies must hire people outside of Mumbai. ” Mumbai isn’t a hub, it’s a fort,” Gupta says. Narain speaks of a major urban-rural divide and a serious lack of infrastructure. The media industry doesn’t work in a bottom up direction. This is creating social tension. He also stresses the need for media literacy to be a part of school curriculum.\n\n10:30 am to 11:30 am “Between Worlds: The International Indian Filmmaker.”\n\nMira Nair is in conversation with Zoya Akhtar. Nair discusses the early years of her filmmaking career, the continuing legacy of Salaam Bombay!, where her sense of belonging come from with a life and career spread across 3 continents, Maisha, her film school in East Africa, the other projects that she is working on and her upcoming film The Reluctant Fundamentalist.\n\nAkhtar who assisted Nair in Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, talks about the best advice that she has received on filmmaking from her: “You don’t need to lose your femininity to do this job” and “don’t hook up with the actors.” Nair talks about beginning her foray into the arts with the questions “Is it possible to change the world with art?” and “Is it possible to make art and still be sane?” She discusses the recurring theme of migration that runs through her films, and about “distance (for the subject) giving (her) clarity” in making these films. She also feels that perhaps “the duplicity is captured much better by film than literature” in dealing with this theme.\n\nNair also talks about how she gets her way in making the film she wants to make by spreading the financing of a film between two to three financiers: “So there is no one boss and I get final cut.”\n\n9:30 am A video address by India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari\n\nThe video address by I&B minister Manish Tewari was called off due to “technical difficulties”. The chairs for the session, Naina Lal Kidwai (Country head, HSBC India and FICCI President) and Uday Shankar (CEO, Star India and Chairman of FICCI’s Media and Entertainment Committee), expressed embarrassment and apologized to the audience. The speech given by Tewari will be recorded and played later in the day.\n\nDay 2. March 13, 2013\n\n(See Day 1 Below)\n\n5:45 pm to 6:30 pm “100 years of Cinema and Beyond.”\n\nThe panelists are filmmakers Anurag Kashyap, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Karan Johar. The discussion is being moderated by film critic Rajeev Masand.\n\nThe discussion covers various topics right from 100 crore films, how healthy India’s film industry is, the sexuality of men and women on screen, as well as the responsibilities of cinema and its makers, the need for a diversity and quality of content, intelligent blockbusters and the scope for animation films in India.\n\nKaran Johar says: “We as a fraternity didn’t coin the term ‘100 crore film'”. But he admits that everyone plays a part in the circus that ensues from this idea: “The brilliance and flaws of a film are not discussed.” Dibakar Banerjee: “I am thankful to films like Rowdy Rathore. They give strength to studios to put in three to four crore in an LSD (Love Sex aur Dhokha) or a Gangs (of Wasseypur). Helps us cockroaches survive. I don’t want that to change. Bless you Salman!” Kashyap agrees with him: “We survive because of those blockbusters.”\n\nZoya Akhtar rejects the notion that cinema is the reason for increased crimes in society. “Cinema is the softest target,” she says. “We’re not the police.” She also points to the under representation in cinema of subjects such as “disability, alternate sexuality.” “We don’t discuss bad filmmaking,” she adds. Banerjee says that the content of a country’s cinema is reflective of its system: “Our system is oppressive and our entertainment is designed to make us forget the oppression.”\n\nThe filmmakers also talk about the short films they directed for Bombay Talkies, a film anthology project backed by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures in celebration of 100 years of Indian cinema. Kashyap calls Johar’s film “the bravest of the lot.”\n\n4:45 pm to 5:45 pm “Creating Compelling Content: The Power of a Story.”\n\nThe panelists are writer Jerry Pinto, filmmaker-writers Vijay Singh, Rajshree Ojha and Ma"
