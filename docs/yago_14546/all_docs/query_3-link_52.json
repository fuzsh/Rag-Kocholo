        "text": "an era where many films fell in a form of ideological false consciousness, this not only plays like an antithesis but addresses the same. class prejudice (and additional inclusion to those set prejudice), preconceived notion and dismal of minority/working class while the majority/upper class benefits from power (by thier own people) is blatantly addressed - in a pedagogical perspective and a lumpen one as well. there's a scene where the entire mohalla (neighborhood) watch a film abt oppression and feel pitiful not by what the watch but how they relate to the state of ’others’, on debating the filmmaker who presents this documentary film talks abt peace within the community - here we acknowledge, not by that specific scene but…\n\nWhen big studios splurged all their meat into recreating the same wafer-thin plotline into 3 hours long display of incompetence in the writing department, some people tried to churn out socially relevant films with overtly preachy narratives such that the exposition reaches the bottommost of society, even if art and grandeur are compromised.\n\nSaed Akhat Mirza's Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro was suited to its time and unfortunately, it is suited to the current socio-political atmosphere as well.

These contradictions come to define India, and in some strange way, even complete India; all in all to…\n\n[Johan- \"मरने के लिए हिंदुस्तान से अच्छी जगह और कोई नहीं है\"]\n\nWatching this makes you realize that after 30 years this movie is still very relevant. We are facing the same problems and politics so nothing has changed in last three decades.\n\nI don't know if anyone else feels that but this movie reminds me of Mahesh bhatt's Ghulam (1998) that education opens a rowdy's mind and he begins to take a stand against this bad system.\n\nThere was line in the movie that before British Hindus and Muslims live happily together but I don't think that because before British there is Prithviraj and Ghori, Rajputs and Mughals, and Hamir and Khilji and there was forced proselytism and destruction…"
