        "text": "Vivek Agnihotri is one of the renowned filmmakers in Bollywood became famous after his film ‘The Kashmir Files’. On the one hand various people hailed the film meanwhile on the other hand a section also criticized the film. Recently screenwriter and director Saeed Akhtar Mirza called his film The Kashmir Files ‘garbage’.\n\nNow, Vivek Agnihotri shared a screenshot of Saeed's statement and tweeted, \"Maine kaha Mirza sahab ko Salaam. Fir milte hain Janaab, The Delhi Files ke baad (I say, salutations to Mirza sir. Let us meet again after The Delhi Files). 2024.\"\n\nEarlier Mirza criticizing the film said, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.”\n\nOn the work front, Vivek's Kashmir Files was made on a budget of ₹15 crore and ended up grossing over ₹350 crore worldwide, largely due to strong word of mouth. The film, directed by Pallavi’s husband Vivek Agnihotri, dealt with the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley over 30 years ago. The film beat out several big releases like Ranbir Kapoor’s Shams Hera, Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha, and Akshay Kumar’s Samrat Prithviraj in the box office race. Now he is all set for its part 2 Kashmir Files unreported.\n\nVicky Kaushal showers his love on Katrina Kaif, “She’s extremely…”\n\nWatch, Anushka Sharma lashes out at a Popular Sports Wear Brand for this reason"
