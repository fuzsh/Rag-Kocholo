        "text": "Nowhere has the cinema made more foundational a public intervention than in India, and yet the Indian cinema is consistently presented as something of an exception to world film history. What if, this book asks, film history was instead written from the Indian experience? Indian Cinema in the Time of Celluloid reconstructs an era of film that saw an unprecedented public visibility attached to the moving image and to its social usage. The cinema was not invented by celluloid, nor will it die with celluloid's growing obsolescence. But 'celluloid' names a distinct era in cinema's career that coincides with a particular construct of the twentieth-century state. This is not merely a coincidence: the very raison d'etre of celluloid was derived from the use to which the modern state put it, as the authorized technology through which the state spoke and as narrative practices endorsing its authority as producer of the rational subject.\n\nThis essay examines the missing national film archive of Pakistan against the politics of competing cultural memory. Sharing a common past yet existing in the shadows of the Indian film industry, cinema in Pakistan found itself in an unusual predicament after decolonization and Partition. While filmmaking was expected to carry the imprint of national difference, the intercultural context of colonial India bequeathed the industry its traditions and personnel. Yet when the British Film Institute repatriated colonial Indian films in the mid-1960s, the holdings went entirely to India. The lack of a public film repository denied Pakistan not only its colonial heritage but also the systematic preservation of its postcolonial film culture. In the absence of a state archive, what has emerged in the country is a democratic archive consisting of independent collectors, magazine proprietors, and avid users. Using a term extracted from one of the archives, filmaria (film fever), Siddique reads in the popular film archives the contagious circumstances of intercultural cinema. It alerts us to a film contagion widespread in the subcontinental publics that thrives on filmgoing, cinematic resemblance, and embodied cultural memory, a condition caused by the displacements of Partition and the creation of national difference.\n\nTo what extent is cinema, or any technology, an aggrandizing, autonomous force that demands the reorganization of the environment around it according to its own technological needs? In the US, the railway system demanded the alienation of land and the coordination of time as a condition of its technical operation. Air travel commanded an instant redefinition of the concept of property—particularly air rights over individual plots—to facilitate flying from one part of a country to another without trespass. Technology, in this sense, is a standardizing, overcoding force that erodes local difference according to its own technological needs. The dispositif of cinema, in this light, can be seen as such an overcoding. The architectonics and screening practices of cinema are remarkably familiar, often instantly recognizable whether we are looking at 1920s Iowa City, Ibadan, Sunderland, Lucknow or Chiang Mai. Despite massive cultural, political, and religious differences, the cinematic apparatus takes on a familiar shape and any attempt to analyze the emergence and history of technological media has to take this capacity of overcoding into account. The turn toward materialism in the recent critical thought, represented in such diverse domains as the archaeology of media, new materialisms, and actor-network theory, asserts the agentive, deter-minative power of technologies and rejects the idea that technologies and objects \" are just there to be used as a white screen on to which society projects its cinema \" (Latour, 1993, p. 53). On the other hand, to what extent is this overcoding technology vulnerable and porous to the environments it finds itself growing within? The version of technology presented in the opening paragraph is based on an assumption that the ontology of a machine is formed at its moment of invention, and that once formed, it is simply transported from place to place. This is, particularly, the case with media archaeology whose critical effort is focused on revealing the conditions of possibility from which media emerge rather than the ways in which those media, once existing in the world, continue to mutate and grow. A more infrastructural view of media places emphasis on standardization and extension. The invention, in the work of someone like Gilbert Simondon (1992), is a single phase in an ongoing process of individuation that will have multiple phases. Cinema, in this sense, comes to be. It is a porous instrument whose internal structures are in constant mutual exchange with a host of external forces—other technologies, modes of economic organization, political formations, legal regimes, religious disciplines, and so on."
