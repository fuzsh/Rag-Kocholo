        "text": "Here's the roundup of the most notable filmmakers to watch out for this year\n\nHere's the roundup of the most notable filmmakers to watch out for this year\n\nThis year, B-Town will see a host of first-time directors making their debuts with a wide range of subjects from action to comedy and drama.\n\nu00a0\n\nTwo of them are better known as master choreographers. The others have taken the step either after assisting famous filmmakers, or after seeing their own director dads at work.\n\nu00a0\n\nSo while David Dhawan's son makes his directorial debut, so will Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's former assistant.\n\nu00a0\n\nHowever, unlike 2010, when Jugal Hansraj and Parmeet Sethi turned to direction, this year will not see any actor going behind the camera or calling the shots.\n\nu00a0\n\nHere's looking at the directors ready to grab the limelight in 2011.\n\nKiran Rao\n\nFilm: Dhobi Ghat\n\nIntroduction: Aamir Khan's better half turns director with four stories featuring four different protagonists, one of them being, Aamir himself.\n\nUSP: Aamir as producer seldom fails. Aamir as actor never fails. Plus the film looks very European in its classiness.\n\nDowner: Barring Anurag Kashyap's Life In A... Metro, episodic films have never worked in Hindi.\n\nRohit Dhawan\n\nFilm: Desi Boyz\n\nIntro: Chip off the old block, David Dhawan's Beta No 1\n\nUSP: Fresh lively look with an endearing cast of Akshay Kumar, John Abraham (back together after Garam Masala), Deepika Padukone and Chitrangada. Rohit has his Papa's blessings.\n\nDowner: Director-sons seldom strike gold. Ramesh Sippy's son Rohan will never make Sholay. Does anyone remember Chetan Anand's son Ketan? And Satyajit Ray's son Sandeep is still struggling to get out of the shadows.\n\nRaghav Dhar\n\nFilm: My Friend Pinto\n\nIntroduction: Assisted Mani Ratnam and Sanjay Leela Bhansali.\n\nUSP: Withu00a0 Pratik in the title role, and Mumbai as its backdrop, My Friend Pintou00a0 shouldu00a0 get sizable support in the metros.\n\nDowner: Barring Julie and Black, Hindi films onu00a0 theu00a0 Anglo-Indian communityu00a0 didn't grab mass attention. Even Saeed Mirza's Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai which starred Pratik's mom Smita, was an arthouse oddity.\n\nDeven Khote\n\nFilm: Phillum City\n\nIntroduction: Years of solid experience as a producer.\n\nUSP: Knows the business of entertainment\n\nDowner: Film sounds too culture-specific. Is the audience in the mood for some niche harkatein?\n\nRemo D'Souza\n\nFilm: F.A.L.T.U\n\nIntroduction: Well known choreographer, has directed a very successful Bengali film.\n\nUSP: Brings to the table several years of experience, is making a young vibrant campus film.\n\nDowner: Except for Farah Khan, choreographers have been disastrous directors. Hope audiences don't take the title to heart.\n\nShiamak Davar\n\nFilm: A Slumdog Millionaire Goes Dancing\n\nIntroduction: Superstar choreographer.\n\nUSP: Knows the entire entertainment industry on first-name terms.\n\nDowner: Choreography and direction are separate vocations.\n\nAli Abbas Zafar\n\nFilm: Mere Brother Ki Dulhan\n\nIntroduction: Has assisted several directors at Yash Raj including Shaad Ali and Kabir Khan.\n\nUSP: Imran Khan and Katrina Kaif together for the first time. Need we say more?\n\nDowner: Haven't we just seen a full-on wedding film from Yashraj? Band Baajaa Baraatu00a0 all over again?\n\nShakun Batra\n\nFilm: Short Term Shaadi\n\nIntroduction: Has assisted Farhan Akhtar, Abhishek Kapoor and Abbas Tyrewala.\n\nUSP: With Kareena Kapoor and Imran Khan finally coming together with Karan Johar asu00a0 producer, this one needs no further recommendation.\n\nDowner: Not another 'Shaadi' film, please!\n\nYogesh Mittal\n\nFilm: Yeh Faasle\n\nIntroduction: Has assisted Raj Kumar Santoshi.\n\nUSP: Has the guts to make au00a0 father-daughter film and to release it on the same Friday as Kiran Rao's Dhobi Ghat. Brave boy!\n\nDowner: Father-daughter films from Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anupama and K V Raju's Indrajeet to Surendra Kumar Bohra's Saajan Ka Ghar and Vikram Bhatt's Aetbaar seldom work.\n\nSiddique Lal\n\nFilm: My Love Story\n\nIntroduction: Super-successful South Indian director\n\nUSP: After Murugadoss in Ghajini and Prabhu Deva in Wanted, Siddiqui could complete a hat trick of South Indian directors in Bollywood.\n\nDowner: Hard for a South Indian director to translocate the culture-specificity of the South into Mumbai."
