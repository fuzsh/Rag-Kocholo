        "text": "March 14, 2020\n\nI got to know him from Rajay Sabha TV segment, Guftugoo. Guftugoo, a beautiful interview collection done by Irfan. You would be amazed to know reading habits of KK Menon and Anurag Kashyap.\n\nSaeed Mirza belongs to a class of artists which believed in their craft to be useful. His tilt for socialist ideas is evident in His movies. However He concluded his film struggle for literary struggle.\n\nThis book is proof of His belief in futility of film industry. Saeed Mirza writes it in an unconventional way which is truelly a letter to a democratic mother. Firstly He hints about marriage of his parents as fruit of forbidden love seeds. Both characters of his short story resemble a lot with His both parents. Along the way He narrates his own life with memories of His mother. Saeed Mirza repeatedly questions but own his Muslim and socialist identity. His lamentation about idealistic secular Indian society looks like His shattered dreams.\n\nAt the end of book, His screenplay makes me realised that how simple a film seems on paper but you can somehow sense brilliance.\n\nJanuary 8, 2020\n\nA potpourri of essays, poetry, ancient tales, letters (duh!) and a film script in 5 acts as a bonus!\n\nLike his movies, this is a memoir attempted in an offbeat way. He's writing these letters to his deceased mother.\n\nHe recounts and recollects many incidents and conversations that stirs up the thought process and eventually makes up an individual.\n\nWish there were some inset pics included in the book. The only pic of her mother is what we see on the cover.\n\nAugust 25, 2016\n\nA nice book, better than what I expected. In a form of a letter to his late mother, Saeed Mirza portrays several areas of life through various forms - short story, poetry, parable, legend, satire, travelogue, memoir, history, diatribe, and even a film-script. In very simple language, he moves from a story of love and romance in and around Quetta, his personal memoirs of growing up in India (mainly in Bombay), to his discourse between history and politics.\n\nHe writes about the the people in his life, and the people he meets when he travelled within India and a few places outside India; about he came to be in the New Wave film-making industry; legends, philosophers, poets from the Islamic world and otherwise; on religious matters, at times; his reminiscences, including his father's struggles, and mother; the state of poverty in a 'shining India'; the unpaid (yet happy) tea-garden workers; the local farmer who literally tells the writer and his crew to 'fuck off' to the big city.\n\nHe writes about the path the West chose in history and questions its philosophy; about Kemal Mustapha, the Ataturk, as one of his character's hero; the two Sufi mystics (Haji Bektash and Jalaluddin Rumi) of Turkey; Democracy and the War against 'terrorism' by the West; and much, much more.\n\nI felt this is an important book to read to remove certain stains of misunderstandings that have been created in the minds of many people throughout the world in these damaged hours of our times. The writings in this book tries to bring back the beauty of the community that has been, it seems, long gone and forgotten in history, and is being over-shadowed by its harmful and unsensible radical thoughts.\n\nA fast-read in simple and easy language. Certainly recommended. :)\n\nJanuary 25, 2013\n\nFor a change, it was when I read the preface that had me thinking toward old-existing unanswered questions right at the beginning of few pages. Author’s words starts for his mother and to some extent are formed and mould out of his mother’s soul. The book is the journey of Saeed Mirza’s (narrator and the author) life in the form of letters to his Ammi-Mother, who passed away in 1990, leaving him in the time to become one of the story tellers, stories which he's been living with for years about India & Politics, Post Independence & Muslims Identity, Poverty at large and Congress Belief. It is one of those makes you wonder with constant urge of exploring the rage thinking about India in now and then sense.\n\nHe is addressing his letters to Ammi, a democratic mother who had an inquisitive mind and inclination toward social issues, political agendas and a streak to be liberal and opinionated about the world- changing or unchanging. Saeed has presented his personal encounters in pieces, he flows down his memories with his Ammi and Abba in the form of short stories related to events of Political Suffrage, Urdu Poetry, European Philosophers and Indian History and many more personal events and encounters of them as a growing up citizens of India....\n\nFor the full review, visit IndiaBookStore.\n\nJuly 14, 2011\n\nThis book gets one extra star just for engaging writing style. It was so engaging that I read 2 pages at a bookstore and decided to buy it. Then I wanted to sleep on my early morning flight but didn't - it was captivating enough that I'd finished 3/4ths of the book in the flight itself.\n\nThe author Saeed Mirza is director of popular TV serials such as Nukkad and has also directed movies like 'Albert Pinto ko Gussa Kyun aata hai?'. His book is addressed to his mother who was interested in knowledge and democracy while she was alive. The book is a compilation of various vignettes from author's personal life, his childhood, some bits on history and culture, stories (I loved the story of Nusrat Beg. Saeed Mirza is very much interested in beginnings of Moorish, Arabian and Islamic culture. Icons such as Kemal Ataturk, Ibn Senna, Ibn Rush etc. occur again and again. His pain at demolition of Babri masjid and 9/11 comes alive clearly in the book. He also highlights the story of some individual individuals/social workers from various parts of India Some sad, others heartbreaking.\n\nAll in all I had great time reading the book. What's more, book ends with a (new) film script that is atatched at the end of the book.\n\nRead\n\nJune 24, 2012\n\nThe fact that the author is a well known and loved raconteur is what attracted me first to the book and of course the not so usual theme - that of a grown up son writing to a mother who is no more. Well known screen writer and director of hindi films and television, Saeed Mirza, takes us through the life of his parents and some turbulent times. In the author's own words, the book is\n\n\"a kind of refelctive, personal journey set in a background of idea, politics and history\"\n\n\"This is a story about a young man and a young woman, and how they met and fell in love with each other, It is also a story about a time and a place.\"\n\nThe narrative moves up and down in the form of anecdotes, short stories, part of a novel and sometimes poetry. The story starts in an old haveli in Quetta, ruled by Shahbobo, the quintessential matriarch that you expecet to find in such places. Jahanara is her granddaughter and here is where she meets her aunt's brother Nusrat Beg, the scholar and idealist. Her father agrees to the match against his family's apprehensions and the young couple move to Sibi, a dry an arid place in Balochistan. Their years there lay the foundation to a life long journey of love. Woven through the words is Jahanara's inquisitive mind, het thirst for knowledge and her liberal, yet traiditional outlook against all that she comes across.\n\nThe story is interspersed with tales from the author's childhood, stories of Aryabhata, Ekalvya, sufis, saints, maulvis and of course couplets by Mirza Ghalib. He then takes us through his growing up years, how English and everything western started influencing him, his years in the film school, incidents from his film making years, gripping encounters with unusual people met during his travels and so on. All through this are thrown around snippets of conversations with his mother on subjects as diverse as Vietnam war, intercaste marriages, the sikh riots, communal wars and the like.\n\nThe connecting thread through the myriad and diverse images is the author's affection for his parents, specially his mother and his suppressed anguish that he could neither spend enough time with her nor talk to her as much as she would have wanted him to.The story is as much about him as his mother. The letters that he now addresses to her is a sort of penance for the earleir ones that\n\n\"were bahanas, excuses for the real thing. 'Letters', you said, 'should be about things that people want to say. Not what they ought to say\"\n\nA must read!\n\nJanuary 22, 2014\n\nThis book is a wonderful insight into Mirza's childhood and his mother's influence on him. Many times while reading through his narration of events that shook the peace and tranquility of common people throughout the world, I realized the sensitive mind of the child Ammi raised in Multicultural Mumbai(Then: Bombay).\n\nIts a struggle in today's times to inculcate values that promote multicultural ethos and secular upbringing in children which Ammi so wonderfully gifted it in her children. The incident where Ammi gets distressed with the Hindu neighbors returning her Kheema dish on Eid, yet makes her kids understand the reasons behind the neighbors' such action, truly is a lesson to be learnt when people exploit religion while fighting over petty issues.\n\nThis book is not just Mirza's memoirs of his mother but a beautiful journey of his sense of being as a good, moral human raised by a woman who knew her humane capacities, and her compassion that touched not only her children's lives, but also other people who now know her through these letters.\n\nFebruary 15, 2009\n\nI often judge books by their cover and it usually works. I think it did this time as well. Never having heard of Saeed Mirza, apparently a well-known film maker in India, I came across his novel at a Crossword's and thought it was worth checking out. A collection of poems, stories, reflections, and even a screenplay, to his late mother, Mirza eloquently puts together a tapestry, a tribute, to his mother, a loving wife, a devout Muslim, and believer in democracy (hence, the title). A bit fragmented and unconventional, it took a bit to get used to its rhythm and flow. I also thought it ended a bit abruptly, and left the reader hanging. But, I liked Mirza's writing style - writing like I suspect he talks. Simple, and real. Overall, a good read.\n\nMarch 5, 2013\n\nLet me first thank the goodreads user who suggested the book to me. THIS is the one good book that I really enjoyed. When I started initially I felt the narration style occurred to me similar to the book I read recently. As the reading progressed I had to change my opinion as this book's style is totally different. Quick and easy read.\n\nLet me tell you why I liked the book apart from the above points.\n\nThe author succeeded in his efforts regarding doing justice to the title, as I felt normally doesn't occur. The journey the author takes with the reader while doing so shares the joy and sorrow. The author also shares lots of information on various philosophers, scientists and others who are generally been neglected by the history due to various reasons.\n\nJune 17, 2014\n\nIn a letter to his mother, the author takes us on a journey with which I am sure that a lot of people can connect. It provides a refreshing perspective. It leaves you in awe at many times, but most of the times it makes you think. He talks in the same breath about kings as he does about common folks. Do read this enjoyable book.\n\nJuly 6, 2012\n\nThis i not a conventional book . There is no single narrative but rather a collection of memoir, essay and short tales all linked as one letter by the author to his mother. The beauty of the book lies in its simplicity of language and style. Highly recommended.\n\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nVery good. A lesson in true history of the world especially Western war mongering\n\nI liked the seemingly piecemeal style of writing. Very heart rending in parts. I would recommend it to the younger generation as a history reader\n\nApril 28, 2017\n\nI highly recommend this piece of literature,it breaks the fourth wall and encloses all facets of human emotions in a few hundred pages.The leftist master weaves his concoction with ample dexterity.\n\nJuly 15, 2019\n\nA deeply engaging and thought provoking read!\n\nJuly 16, 2020\n\nThis book offers the narrative truest to a director like Saeed Mirza, an amalgamation of different genres of fiction... It's a treasure.\n\nMay 18, 2020\n\nThe author Saeed Mirza made a very good attempt with his debut novel. This is the letter to his late mother who died in 1990. First, he described the political scenarios all over the world. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Palestine crises, Yugoslavian wars, Rwanda genocide, Iraq and Afghanistan invasion by the USA, peace in Namibia and Angola, Argentina's economic status. He covered all the world from 1990 to 2006.\n\nA beautiful love story of Jahanara and Nusrat Beg set in 1932 is a part of his writing. Belonged to a wealthy Pashtun family, Jahanara chooses to marry Nusrath Beg of the Mughals. The Nusrat character is outgoing and he believes in modernization and respects communist ideas. This love story is about Pathans vs Mughals, rich vs poor, civilized vs uncivilized, educated vs uneducated. The narrator is so engaging with the short stories, Sufi quotes, philosophy, connected History.\n\nHe expressed his views to his socially inclined mother in the various outrages all over the world. He was moved by the Babri masjid issue and a terror attack in Mumbai and his concern can be seen in his words to his mother. He mentioned many Islamic philosophers and was attracted by the teachings of Ibn Senna and Ibn Rushd. These two names are repeated very often and he also mentioned Alturk's influence on Islam. Saeed reveals his love towards Sufism and he believes that Sufism has changed every aspect of his life and the philosophers who revolutionized the world.\n\nThe book is so informative and incisive for the readers. In the time where the book writers are turning into Bollywood scriptwriters, Saeed has proved that he can be extraordinary in both fields.\n\nDecember 15, 2008\n\nA tribute to an extraordinary woman, her influence on her son and his vision of the world. Made me nostaligic for a more gentle and elegant way of living, but that's probably far from reality, based on a child's memories and recollections of his parents.\n\nI wish there'd been more about what it was like to be a Muslim woman in modern India, living in a Hindu conclave. And definitely more about what it's like to be an adult Muslim man in Bombay following the Babri Masjid demolition, or to travel overseas after 9/11."
