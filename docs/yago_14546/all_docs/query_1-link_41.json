        "text": "NANDITA DAS, MANAV KAUL & SAURABH SHUKLA LET GO OFF THEIR FEE FOR THE REMAKE OF THE CULT FILM ‘ALBERT PINTO KO GUSSA KYUN AATA HAI’\n\nNandita Das, Manav Kaul & Saurabh Shukla, who play the lead roles in the remake of the cult film ALBERT PINTO KO GUSSA KYUN AATA HAI, did not charge a penny as remuneration. Since it’s an independent film directed & produced by Soumitra Ranade (who directed JAJANTARAM MAMANTARAM and wrote GOOPY GAWAIYA BAGHA BAJAIYA) there were budget constraints. The actors fell in love with the script and offered to work for free. Touched by their gesture, Soumitra has made them partners on the project and will be sharing the box office profit with the 3 actors once the film is released. The film is raising 30 lakhs through a 2 month long crowdfunding campaign on Wishberry which will cease on 2nd Oct, 2015. The campaign started on 3rd Aug, 2015 to collect money for the post production, animation & VFX of the film. The original film directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza was released in 1980 and starred Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil & Om Puri in the lead roles. Soumitra says, “It was a very challenging film but I could pull it off only because of my supportive actors who worked for free.”“This is the 1st script I read that grabbed me so much that I couldn’t put it down. It was such an amazing script. I know the director very well and I knew it was straight from his heart. I told him we have to make this film anyhow, even if we have to do it for free. Such roles don’t come your way often and I didn’t want to let go this brilliant opportunity.” Says Manav Kaul. Says Nandita Das, ““Firstly I don’t equate money with work. There is a lot of work that I do without charging anything. Films ofcourse, help me pay my bills and hence I don’t do them without any fees. But seldom do you get a project or a director where you know that they genuinely don’t have the money – and they just want to make a good film!So you want to participate in that. I think we all have to support each other especially those who are doing things with great honesty, with great integrity.”Says Saurabh Shukla, “Soumitra approached me and told me that there is no money but you be a partner. So all of us are partners in this project and I think it is great idea, because there are scripts in which the ‘mainstream market’ doesn’t believe in. But as artists we know that it has content and also has commercial possibilities. So what should we do? Should we be slaves to the market and not do these films? Or should we try it? So when we try it, we have to cut down costs. Soumitra has put in his own money and how much can a normal person invest in a film. So in such a scenario actors and the crewmembers come on board and say we will work free for you and share the profits later. So infact this is my chance to buy my Jaguar !”\n\nTANIMA BAGS THE BEST ACTRESS AWARD\n\nTanima Bhattacharya wins the Best Actress Award for her role of ‘Abeera’ in SAANKAL – Shackle at the 20th Indie Gathering International Film Festival. It’s a proud moment for Pisceann Pictures as their debut Hindi film SAANKAL – Shackle is winning accolades and awards at various international film festivals. An excited Tanima shared her thoughts by saying, “I am really blessed and honored that our film “SAANKAL – Shackle” has won the Best Lead Actress Award at 20th International Indie Gathering Film Festival 2015.” The actress further added, “I am really blessed and honored that our film ” SAANKAL ( Shackle)” has won 2nd Best Foreign Feature Drama Award and I have won the Best Lead Actress Award at 20th International Indie Gathering Film Festival 2015. I am really proud of my director Dedipya Joshii Ji because he is the man who gave birth to Abeera & Kesar. Thanks to him for keeping faith in me that I can do justice to the role of Abeera. This is true that Tanima Bhattacharya has got this award but I want to dedicate the award to ABEERA in “SAANKAL”. SAANKAL – Shackle brings light on the still followed malpractice of elder women forcefully marrying off to younger boys in the state of Rajasthan. A tradition like this has several ill-effects however it still exists in the Thar desert. “SAANKAL – Shackle” features Chetan Sharma, Tanima Bhattacharya, Harish Kumar, Jagat Singh, Samarth Shandilya & Milind Gunaji. The film is produced by Aanand Rathore & Dedipya Joshii and directed & written by Dedipya Joshii.\n\nFWICE’s GENERAL COUNCIL HAS DECIDED TO GO ON A STRIKE\n\nThe General Council of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) has decided unanimously to strike work across the Film & TV sectors as the negotiations between the TV producers & FWICE failed without coming to an agreement on even a single point. Speaking to us the President Shri Kamlesh Pandey stated “We are extremely disillusioned with the lack basic respect for human rights & liberties. Technicians are being compelled to sign draconian contracts that are illegal and anti worker” Amit Behl who is the Sr. Vice President (FWICE) and represents the interests of actors too stated “CINTAA is 100% supporting the strike and no actor will report for duty. Actors, Technicians & workers are being forced to work for over 12 hours a day regularly at remote locations with no breaks and they are on the brink of collapse” The FWICE General Secretary Dilip Pithva said that the trust the FWICE had placed in the producer bodies had been misplaced and all their commitments had proved shallow and been a time wasting exercise.\n\nWith the All India Film Employees Confederation having unanimously shown their support to the strike and with the Core Committee of AIFEC meeting on Oct 1st 2015 to express National Solidarity with the FWICE the situation is set for a showdown. With this current situation of chaos prevalent in the Film industry it remains to be seen as to whether the workers succeed in their fight for their rights.\n\nDVD COLLECTION OF THE HISTORICAL MAGNUM OPUS ‘BUDDHA – THE KING OF KINGS’ RELEASED BY ULTRA MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT PVT LTD\n\nBUDDHA – THE KING OF KINGS was a famous historical serial on the life of Buddha produced on a scale & grandeur never before seen on Indian Television.
