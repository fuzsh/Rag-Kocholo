The problem is that you probably deleted the label at some point and than add it back to the storyboard.

Hover your mouse on the circle next to @IBoutlet weak var funFactLabel: UILabel!, the label should highlight. If it doesn't right click on the label and drag form the "New referencing outlet" to @IBOutlet weak var funFactLabel: UILabel! in your viewController class.
