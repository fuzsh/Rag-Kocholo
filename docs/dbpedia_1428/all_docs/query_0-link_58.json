        "text": "By: Annalisa Parent\n\nDo you struggle with the finer rules of English grammar? Has this blind spot ever given you imposter syndrome? When you commit a grammatical faux pas, does a little voice whisper “you don’t know the difference between ‘who’ and ‘whom’ and you actually think you can be a writer?”\n\nI’m here to tell you you can tell that voice to please go away. Many writers struggle with grammar and syntax, even if their prose is otherwise outstanding. This does NOT mean you are not a good writer, or that you can’t get published.\n\nBut I’m also here to tell you that you absolutely DO need to address these errors before sending your book to any agent or publisher. No publisher wants to spend time fixing a million little syntax errors, and frankly, it shows them you haven’t put all the care and attention into your book that you could possibly could have, again, even if they’re just blindspots for you.\n\nSo what can you do to fix your grammar?\n\nI have two solutions:\n\nBrush up on your grammar. Yes, I mean actually go back and study proper English grammar, textbooks, flashcards, and all. I know this probably does not sound fun (for me it actually sounds like a blast, but that’s me). For that reason, I’ve included below a tidbit of guidance about some very common errors I’ve seen writers make.\n\nWork with someone who DOES know and understand grammar. This is perhaps the best option, because #1:it’s going to save you a ton of studying time, #2: you’re unlikely to master all grammar anyway and #3 there are some occasions where bending the grammar rules can contribute to creating the appropriate voice for your book (for example, if you’re contrasting two characters with different educational backgrounds or socioeconomic statuses). But these ‘errors’ need to be very, very intentional and carefully done. And it doesn’t work if your grammar is sloppy in the places where it should be clean. For that reason, I suggest working with someone who has a good grasp on both grammar and storytelling. I do happen to know someone who is both a grammar nerd and storytelling connoisseur...you can talk to her by booking a call here.\n\nOkay, as promised, here are my sassy syntax tips to get you grammar out of the gutter:\n\n1) Never leave “this” standing alone.\n\nThis is why. This could lead to confusion. This is really common.\n\nWhat the heck is “this?” Use “this” as an adjective. It should modify something. This method is a much clearer way of writing. This type of communication expresses its ideas more effectively. This idea should now be evident to you.\n\n2) Don’t confuse that, who, and whom.\n\nOk, I know we live in a commercial culture that thrives on objectifying humans for the sake of sales. But, please, do not bring that smut into your writing. People are not objects, no matter what the latest ads are telling you. “So what?” I hear you say. Well, let me tell you.\n\n“That” refers to objects.\n\n“Who” and “Whom” refer to people.\n\nTherefore: “She is the girl that I asked out last week” does not work. Unless you are cavorting with inflatable plastic people– and frankly that’s too much information.\n\nRather, I am going to make the potentially foolish assumption that you went out with a real live human girl and therefore need to refer to her as a human by using either who or whom.\n\nWhat to do? “It’s so confusing this whole who/whom conundrum,” I hear you whine. Ok, here’s the official skinny: who is a subject, whom is an object.\n\nWhat does that mean for you? Here’s the simple test: does your sentence already have a subject, then “whom” is probably your new knight in shining armor, the word of your dreams.\n\nLet’s take a look at our example.\n\n“She is the girl that I asked out last week.” What’s the subject? She. Very good.\n\nWho is a subject. We already have a subject, therefore we don’t need another one. Use Whom.\n\nShe is the girl whom I asked out last week.\n\n3) “But that sounds so funny. Nobody talks that way.” Seriously, are you whining again?\n\nYes, it is true– no one does talk that way. But just think– and not to get too “Alice’s Restaurant” on you– but we could start a revolution here– if people did start to talk that way maybe we could start this whole uprising of people who actually spoke properly.\n\nIt could go viral!\n\nOk, ok, ok, I’ll calm down.\n\nIt may not sound right, but it is, in fact, right. And as a writer, you should care about following grammar, usage, and mechanics rules.\n\n4) You have a sacred role as a protector of the language. Don’t abuse it.\n\nSo, let’s get back to more important tasks in your role as safeguard. Whom is an object pronoun, ok, we’ve covered that. If you are referencing a human being and are tempted to use that, think twice, then opt for who or whom.\n\nIf you decide you can’t choose between who and whom, or if you simply don’t want to sound like you’ve stepped out of a Dickens novel, please at least err on the side of treating people with dignity and use who over that.\n\n5) It’s all relative\n\nOne last note: I am not one for labels– I am more concerned with proper usage than nomenclature. That said, here’s a hint that might help you: the words who, whom, and that are called relative pronouns, thusly named because they relate to the noun they are describing. Therefore, just like in that preschool card game “memory,” they have to match. “That” is no more a match for “person” than “strawberry” was for “lemon,” no matter how much you tried to cheat when your brother wasn’t looking.\n\nBesides, thinking of grammar like a card game makes it fun. Well, almost.\n\n6) Your opinion matters\n\nOk, I’ve sassed about with my writing pet peeves. What are some of yours? What tips do you have for avoiding them? Send your ideas and questions my way. I always love to hear from you.\n\nHappy Writing!"
