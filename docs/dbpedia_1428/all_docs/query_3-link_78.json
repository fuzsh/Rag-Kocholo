        "text": "Season 7, Episode 2, ‘The Well’\n\nSorry about all the violence and death last week, “Walking Dead” fans. Here, have a tiger.\n\nOr maybe a song. Or how about a nice pork chop? (Actually, skip the pork chop.) These were just a few of the delights on offer on Sunday when, after last week’s night of horror, we landed in a brighter, more idyllic land.\n\nThis was the Kingdom, a place of flourishing gardens, abundant cobbler and Renaissance Faire dialogue, overseen by the beneficent and dreadlocked King Ezekiel. We learn later that the Arthurian airs were just that — a put-on. But upon the initial encounter with the bombastic amateur thespian I imagine most of us had reactions similar to Carol’s: This place is a joke. How do I get out of here?\n\nWe’ll get into Ezekiel’s stagecraft in a minute. The larger point with the Kingdom is, here is another way.\n\nWe’ve known that “The Walking Dead” was moving into a new phase, one defined less by the peregrinations and shifting fortunes of Rick and company, and more by the relationships between competing colonies, each with its own version of civilization. Sunday’s episode represented a notable expansion not only of the players and cast of this story, but also of philosophy.\n\nWhatever you think about the fairy tale aspects of the Kingdom, it seems to be a settlement based in hope and, perhaps, a belief in the fundamental goodness of humankind, which distinguishes it from roughly 100 percent of the groups that Rick and the gang have encountered this far. From the Nero-esque Governor to those ravenous Terminus lunatics to Officer Dawn’s actual police state to the predatory Wolves to the despicable Saviors, “The Walking Dead” has so far equated post-apocalyptic polity with toxicity. Even the fatally oblivious Alexandrians based their decency in denial, leading to vulnerability within — think Pete the serial abuser — and without — think Season 6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
