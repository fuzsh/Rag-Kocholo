        "text": "How to Use These Prayers\n\nFeel free to choose from the many different prayers, litanies, and scriptures, depending on the circumstances and condition of the person. Also, the length of the prayers may be shortened or extended. Most importantly, listen to how God may be speaking to you.\n\nAs you begin praying, it is helpful to ask for a moment of silence among those gathered and invite all present to call to mind the presence of God. The prayers are best said in a slow, quiet voice, alternating with periods of silence. A pause or a period of silence between each section is also helpful.\n\nDo not hesitate to say these prayers even if the person appears to be unconscious. A person who appears unconscious may still be aware of their surroundings and be able to hear and may know that others who care and love them are near and are there to help them on their journey to meet Our Lord.\n\nDownload a PDF version of this page here.\n\nIntroduction\n\nVisiting a person who is approaching the end of life can be a difficult time, filled with stress and confusion. The dying person and their family and friends need our support, but we often feel helpless and are not sure what to do. It is hoped that these prayers that are in the Catholic tradition will give you some guidance and direction. Our prayers at the bedside of our Christian brothers and sisters will let them know that they are not alone. We are walking with them as far as we can on this final journey to their new home. We cannot cross over into their new home, but we can go as far as the door with them.\n\nIt is hoped that as death draws near, these prayers will give the person confidence in God’s mercy so they can overcome their fears and look forward to a heavenly life and resurrection through the power of Christ, who destroyed the power of death by his own dying. Our Lord is by their side to guide and protect them. The promise of scripture is that God will lead us through the valley of the shadow of death. As we read in Deuteronomy 31:8, “It is the Lord who goes before you; he will be with you and will never fail you or forsake you. So do not fear or be dismayed.”\n\nWe should rejoice for our loved ones who will soon be in the presence of Christ. As the apostle Paul tells us, though we naturally grieve at losing loved ones, we are not to “grieve like the rest, who have no hope” (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Our parting is not the end of our relationship, only an interruption. We will not lose our loved one who is near death, because we know where they will be going. They will experience the joy and love of Christ’s presence in a place so wonderful that Christ called it Paradise. And one day, we’re told, in a magnificent reunion, them and we “shall always be with the Lord. Therefore console one another with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:17-18).\n\nThe Sign of the Cross\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\nGreeting\n\n“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” – 2 Corinthians 1:2\n\nWe journey with you, (Name) toward your new home. We will go with you as far as the front door. We will help you and pray with you as you pass through this door into your new home in the kingdom of God. Let us walk together in faith and peace, sharing the love we have for (Name).\n\nPenitential Act or Reconciliation\n\nNow let us turn with confidence to the Lord and ask his forgiveness for all our sins.\n\nLord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\n\nLord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.\n\nMay almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen.\n\nDivine Mercy Prayer\n\nJesus revealed to St. Faustina Kowaska, “At the hour of their death, I defend as My own glory every soul that will say this chaplet; or when others say it for a dying person, the indulgence is the same. When this chaplet is said by the bedside of a dying person,… unfathomable mercy envelops the soul, and the very depths of My tender mercy are moved (Diary, 811).\n\nNow let us pray the Divine Mercy Prayer as Jesus taught St. Faustina:\n\nEternal Father,\n\nI offer you the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity\n\nof Your dearly beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n\nin atonement for our sins,\n\nand those of the whole world.\n\nFor the sake of His sorrowful passion,\n\nhave mercy on us and on the whole world (repeat 3 times)\n\nScripture Readings\n\nNote: Scripture texts here and elsewhere in this work are from the New American Bible Revised Edition, a bible translation approved by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and available on their website. This revised edition is the culmination of nearly 20 years of work by nearly 100 scholars and theologians.\n\nShort Scriptural Texts\n\nWhat will separate us from the love of Christ? Romans 8:35\n\nWe shall always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:17\n\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear? Psalm 27:1\n\nJesus said, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.” Matthew 25:34\n\nGod said, “I will never forsake you or abandon you.” Hebrews 13:5\n\nThey that hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on eagles’ wings. Isaiah 40:31\n\nLonger Scriptural Reading\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd;\n\nthere is nothing I lack.\n\nIn green pastures he makes me lie down;\n\nto still waters he leads me;\n\nhe restores my soul.\n\nHe guides me along right paths\n\nfor the sake of his name.\n\nEven though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n\nI will fear no evil, for you are with me;\n\nyour rod and your staff comfort me….\n\nYou anoint my head with oil;\n\nmy cup overflows.\n\nIndeed, goodness and mercy will pursue me\n\nall the days of my life;\n\nI will dwell in the house of the Lord. Psalm 23\n\nOther Scriptural Readings\n\nJesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled.\n\nYou have faith in God; have faith also in me.\n\nIn my Father’s house there are many dwelling places.\n\nIf there were not, would I have told you\n\nthat I am going to prepare a place for you?\n\nAnd if I go and prepare a place for you,\n\nI will come back again and take you to myself,\n\nso that where I am you also may be.”\n\nJohn 14:1-3\n\nJesus said, “Whoever loves me will keep my word,\n\nand my Father will love him,\n\nand we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.\n\nPeace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.\n\nNot as the world gives do I give it to you.\n\nDo not let your hearts be troubled or afraid.”\n\nJohn 14:23, 27\n\n“Do not fear: I am with you;\n\ndo not be anxious: I am your God.\n\nI will strengthen you, I will help you,\n\nI will uphold you with my victorious right hand.”\n\nIsaiah 41:10\n\nBe strong and steadfast!\n\nDo not fear nor be dismayed,\n\nfor the Lord, your God, is with you\n\nwherever you go. Joshua 1:9\n\nJesus said, “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,\n\nand I will give you rest.\n\nTake my yoke upon you and learn from me,\n\nfor I am meek and humble of heart;\n\nand you will find rest for yourselves.\n\nFor my yoke is easy, and my burden light.”\n\nMatthew 11:28-30\n\nJesus said, “My sheep hear my voice;\n\nI know them, and they follow me.\n\nI give them eternal life,\n\nand they will never perish.\n\nNo one can take them out of my hand.\n\nMy Father, who has given them to me,\n\nis greater than all,\n\nand no one can take them out of the Father’s hand.\n\nThe Father and I are one.”\n\nJohn 10:27-30\n\nSo whoever is in Christ is a new creation:\n\nthe old things have passed away;\n\nbehold, new things have come.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n\nJesus said, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you.\n\nNot as the world gives, do I give it to you.\n\nDo not let your hearts be troubled or afraid.”\n\nJohn 14.27\n\nBlessed are those who trust in the Lord;…\n\nThey are like a tree planted beside the waters\n\nthat stretches out its roots to the stream:\n\nIt does not fear heat when it comes,\n\nits leaves stay green;\n\nIn the year of drought it shows no distress,\n\nbut still produces fruit.\n\nJeremiah 17; 7-8\n\nFor I know well the plans I have in mind for you…\n\nplans for your welfare, and not for woe,\n\nso as to give you a future of hope.\n\nJeremiah 29:11\n\nGod is our refuge and our strength,\n\nan ever-present help in distress.\n\nThus we do not fear, though earth be shaken\n\nand mountains quake to the depths of the sea….\n\n“Be still and know that I am God! Psalm 46: 1-3, 11\n\nLitany of Saints\n\nThe Lord’s Prayer (Our Father)\n\nOur Father, who art in heaven,\n\nhallowed be thy name,\n\nthy kingdom come,\n\nthy will be done,\n\non earth as it is in heaven.\n\nGive us this day our daily bread;\n\nand forgive us our trespasses,\n\nas we forgive those\n\nwho trespass against us;\n\nand lead us not into temptation,\n\nbut deliver us from evil.\n\nAmen.\n\nPrayer of Commendation\n\nName, child of God,\n\nour companion in faith and sister/brother in Christ,\n\nGo forth, Christian soul, from this world\n\nin the love of God the almighty Father,\n\nwho created you,\n\nin the mercy of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,\n\nwho suffered and died for you,\n\nin the power of the Holy Spirit,\n\nwho was poured out upon you, and strengthens you,\n\nat one with all the faithful, living and departed.\n\ngo forth, faithful Christian.\n\nMay you rest in peace\n\nand rise in the glory of your eternal home,\n\nforever in the paradise of God.\n\nwhere grief and misery are banished,\n\nand light and joy abide.\n\nAmen.\n\nConclude With The Sign of the Cross\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
