        "meta_description": "Sublimation is the process in which a special ink is used to print the design and pressed onto a substrate that is either coated with a special coating or material that is 100% polyester. If pressing onto a shirt that isn't 100% polyester the design will have a duller look to it and will wash out some after each wash. Sublimation ink can only stick to polyester fibers which is the reason for the less vibrant image and the washing out a bit after a wash. It is suggested to press at 385 degrees with light pressure for approximately 45 seconds. Ensure you adhere the paper to the substrate to prevent ghosting which is caused when the paper lifts or moves during the transfer process. It is best to rip around the image to remove any excess areas to prevent unseen ink from transferring onto your garment. Transfers will come printed reverse. DTF is the process in which designs are printed directly onto a film. The design is able to be applied to almost any substrate/material. Also, these transfers can go on any color item. Unlike sublimation this process DOES print white. The process is rather simple. To apply you will press the design at 302 degrees for 8 seconds for cotton and 266 degrees for 5 seconds for polyester medium to high pressure. Set item aside and let cool. Once cool peel the film and repress with teflon sheet for 8 seconds. You want to see the texture of the shirt. With these items you will want to wash inside out in cold water and dry on low heat. SIZING Mug: 3-4 inches wide/height Infant: 5-6 inches wide/height Toddler: 7-8 inches wide/height Youth: 8-10 inches wide/height (printed on a standard 8.5 by 11 inch size paper) Adult: 8-11 inches wide/height (printed on a standard 8.5 by 11 inch size paper) Adult large: 12-15 inches wide (printed on a 13x19 inch paper and proportioned accordingly) ALL HEIGHTS WILL BE BASED ON THE APPROPRIATE PROPORTION FOR THE DESIRED WIDTH and paper sizing only pertains to sublimation not DTF ***NOTE WHITE DOES NOT PRINT WITH SUBLIMATION*** You can also get CUSTOM transfer upon request but design must be print ready!
