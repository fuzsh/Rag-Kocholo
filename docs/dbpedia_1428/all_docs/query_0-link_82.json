        "text": "Four Pepperdine University students were killed by an out-of-control BMW driver as they walked along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on Tuesday night, according to police.\n\nThe four women, who were all seniors, were fatally struck when a 22-year-old driver, identified by police as Fraser Michael Bohm, lost control of his BMW around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday on a notoriously treacherous stretch of the iconic highway.\n\nThe students were identified by school officials as Niamh Rolston, Peyton Stewart, Asha Weir and Deslyn Williams on Wednesday.\n\n“To the students who loved, lived with, and were in community with the departed members of our Pepperdine family, my heart is broken with yours. I join you in your grief as we process this profound loss,” Pepperdine president Jim Gash told the school community in a statement.\n\nBohm was speeding as he drove westbound on the highway in his dark vehicle when he lost control, smashed into several parked vehicles, then crashed into a group of young women walking in the area, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department told reporters at a news conference Wednesday, KTLA reported.\n\nWitnesses reported that Bohm got out of the vehicle unharmed and was tackled to the ground by several people.\n\nRolston, Stewart, Weir and Williams were declared dead at the scene.\n\nTwo others were taken to local hospitals in unknown conditions, cops said.\n\nBohm was arrested on charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.\n\nA DUI investigation is still pending, the LASD said.\n\nHowever, he was later released from custody due to lack of evidence, Fox 11 reported.\n\nThe crash occurred roughly four miles north of Pepperdine’s picturesque coastal campus.\n\nA prayer service has been scheduled for members of the Pepperdine community for 10 a.m. Thursday, the university said.\n\nAdditional plans are in the works to hold a memorial service for each student.\n\n“In the days ahead, we will come together in meaningful ways to honor and celebrate the lives of the remarkable individuals lost to this unthinkable tragedy,” Gash said."
