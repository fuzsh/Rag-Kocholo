        "text": "What are examples of terminal illnesses?\n\nThere is no set list of illnesses which are terminal. People who are terminally ill may have a single illness or a number of different conditions.\n\nExamples of some illnesses which can be terminal include:\n\nadvanced cancer\n\ndementia (including Alzheimer's)\n\nmotor neurone disease (MND)\n\nlung disease\n\nneurological diseases, like Parkinson's\n\nadvanced heart disease.\n\nRemember that these illnesses are not always terminal. If you have questions about your illness, it is best to speak with your healthcare professional.\n\nIs advanced cancer always terminal?\n\nAdvanced cancer is not always terminal, but it can be.\n\nAdvanced cancer usually means that there is a lot of cancer or it has spread (is a later stage). Terminal cancer usually means the cancer cannot be controlled and is likely to be the cause of someone's death.\n\nSome advanced cancers can be treated to control their growth or spread, while others are terminal. If you have terminal cancer, you can still have palliative care or treatment, which may focus on managing symptoms.\n\nSome healthcare professionals may define or use the words 'terminal' and 'advanced' differently. If you are not sure about the words your healthcare professional is using, it is best to ask them to explain what they mean.\n\nRead Macmillan Cancer Support's information about staging and grading cancer.\n\nHow do I know if my illness is terminal?\n\nThe healthcare professional managing the treatment for your condition, such as your doctor or consultant, should explain whether your illness is terminal or not. The diagnosis would be given after tests and, in some cases, treatment.\n\nSometimes healthcare professionals may use different terms or definitions. If you are unsure or worried about whether your illness is terminal, it's best to speak with your healthcare professional.\n\nHow long will someone with a terminal illness live?\n\nSomeone with a terminal illness may live for days, weeks, months or years. It often depends on their diagnosis and any treatment they are having. It can be difficult for healthcare professionals to predict exactly how long someone with a terminal illness will live (their prognosis).\n\nIt can be shocking or upsetting to get a terminal diagnosis, as people sometimes think the word 'terminal' means they will die soon. This might be a worry for you too. It may help to remember that no two experiences of a terminal illness are the same. Sometimes, a person's condition will gradually get worse as the illness progresses. Other people may find that they feel better or worse at different points during their illness – it is not always a straight path.\n\nWhat care will someone with a terminal illness need?\n\nIf you are living with a terminal illness, you will usually have treatment and care which focuses on:\n\nmanaging any symptoms\n\noffering emotional, spiritual and practical support\n\ngiving you a good quality of life.\n\nThis type of holistic care, which looks after every part of you, is called palliative care. Palliative care aims to make sure you feel supported and comfortable, rather than cure the illness.\n\nYou can have other treatments at the same time as palliative care. But sometimes you may stop having other treatments. It can be difficult to cope with stopping treatment, especially if it's because the treatment is not working. If this happens, it's important to let your healthcare team know how you're feeling. They can explain what palliative care you can have and how that may be able to help.\n\nPalliative care may be given at home or in another healthcare setting, such as a hospital or hospice.\n\nRead about palliative care.\n\nCan a terminal illness get better?\n\nBy its definition, a terminal illness will not get better – in other words, it cannot be cured. But some terminal illnesses can be treated to help ease symptoms or give a better quality of life.\n\nWe know that it can be difficult to cope with a terminal diagnosis, which is why it's important to ask for the support you need. Your healthcare team, and Marie Curie, are here to offer emotional, physical and practical support.\n\nRead about coping with a terminal diagnosis.\n\nMore information and support about terminal illness\n\nIt may take some time to process getting a terminal diagnosis, and we are here to help you make sense of it. You may find our information on living with a terminal illness helpful, which includes guidance on managing symptoms and tips for planning ahead.\n\nRead about living with a terminal illness.\n\nYou may want to tell other people about your terminal diagnosis, especially those close to you. We have some tips on how to have those conversations that may be useful.\n\nRead about telling others about your terminal diagnosis.\n\nIf you need more support about terminal illness or a terminal diagnosis, you can call our free Support Line on 0800 090 2309.\n\nFind out more about our Support Line."
