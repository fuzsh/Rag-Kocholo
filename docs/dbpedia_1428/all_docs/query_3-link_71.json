        "text": "Writing Sympathy Notes For Loved Ones\n\nWhen someone you care about is feeling ill, having surgery, or going through a rough patch, writing get well soon messages or a personal note with inspirational greetings can make all the difference. In fact, sending a comforting get well gift is how Spoonful of Comfort started.\n\nAnd while you might have all the “get well” good vibes in your head, we know it’s sometimes hard to put sincere wishes into words. So let us help.\n\nGet well greetings cross our desk every day. Some make us laugh. Some make us cry. Some make us feel hope each sick person will conquer the world. So we thought we’d share common threads we’ve seen.\n\nThis article covers questions our customer service team hears a lot when it comes to get well gifts. You’ll see some of the most frequent reasons people are sending get well wishes. And you’ll find inspiration to adapt these ideas to send the care your loved one needs.\n\nWhat if I Don’t Know What to Write?\n\nUnless you’re a professional writer—which most of us aren’t—it can be tough to know the right words to say when someone feels down or ill. So start by thinking about two things: how you imagine that person is feeling (physically and emotionally), and what your relationship with them is like.\n\nGot it? Now you can follow some good common sense steps.\n\nWrite a get well message that’s brief\n\nIf somebody’s not feeling well, they might not be up to long stories (even with the best intentions). Now you know this person better than we do, so use your judgment. But they might appreciate something short and sweet like:\n\nI’m thinking of you this very minute. Hope you can feel it—and feel better soon.\n\nI’m sorry you’re sick. Call me when you’re up for it, I’d love to hear your voice.\n\nTake time to take care of yourself. Hope you bounce back soon! In the meantime, enjoy these flowers and cookies.\n\nWhen I heard you were sick, it made me feel a little worse, too. Hoping you feel better quickly.\n\nWishing you good health—and sending you healing vibes and hugs. Feel better soon!\n\nSay get well in a personal way\n\nSay something that could only come from you. What’s your relationship with that person? Is there something you know will make them smile?\n\nHey big brother—did you finally get sick from teasing me? Or did karma finally find you? Hope you know I love you (really).\n\nSorry you're having a sick day. Hope to see you out walking our block again soon.\n\nMiss you, friend! Book club isn’t the same without you. Hope you’re up and around soon.\n\nBe practical in your get well wishes\n\nIs there something you can take over while they’re sick? Let them know.\n\nI heard you’re out of commission for a while. Plan on me taking Anna to gymnastics on Tuesdays—I’d love to watch her class.\n\nHere are a few freezer meals while you recover. Feel better soon!\n\nWe’ve got the HOA meetings under control. Focus on getting better!\n\nGet Well Card Messages After Surgery\n\nSo, someone you know has just had surgery and will be laid up for a while. How can you share hopes for a full, speedy recovery? The same principles above still apply (be brief, personal, and practical). You might find more ways to apply their personality and situation to a get well message after surgery.\n\nWhat’s that person like? How will their personality affect their recovery?\n\nIs she a go-getter? Tell her you hope the doctors will be the patient ones—you know she’ll kick butt in rehab.\n\nIs he someone who gets discouraged easily? Remind him that little steps in recovery make a big difference. Trust the process!\n\nHow will this surgery change the future? Help them focus on the good things ahead.\n\nShare your wishes to feel well after surgery—and share some practical ways you can help. Sometimes people in recovery “feel fine” but can’t return to their normal routine yet. Offer practical, sincere wishes by:\n\nDriving to and from appointments\n\nPicking up the groceries\n\nDoing loads of laundry\n\nWatching the kids\n\nWalking the dog\n\nLetting them stay with you, if you have fewer stairs or other complications at home\n\nSending a heat-and-eat meal (if you can’t make it yourself, Spoonful of Comfort offers the next best thing!)\n\nGet Well Messages for a Serious Illness\n\nWhen someone is seriously ill or has a terminal illness, it’s hard to find the right words to say. And that’s okay. A simple expression of your care is very appropriate. Here are some positive thoughts about what you might say—and ones to avoid saying—when sharing kind words for a serious illness.\n\nBe straightforward\n\nIt’s okay to be honest about your feelings. Candidly sharing your thoughts can mean a lot:\n\nI’m so sorry to hear you’re unwell. I hope you’re surrounded by the people who care about you most while you recover.\n\nI was sad to hear about your diagnosis. Know I’m sending love and care as you begin treatment.\n\nI hope you’re taking it slow and easy right now. Wishing for better days soon!\n\nI’m pulling for you during recovery. It may be tough, but our prayers are with you every step of the way.\n\nI don’t know what to say except I care about you, and I’m thinking of you.\n\nShare uplifting thoughts\n\nInstead of dwelling on bad news, illness, or injury, share an optimistic and cheerful message. A positive attitude can make all the difference in someone’s recovery.\n\nI hope you find positive moments today. My best wishes are speeding them to you.\n\nHang in there, I know the strength you have.\n\nHope you feel a little better every day.\n\nWishing you a little encouragement and a little progress as you recover today.\n\nNow’s the time to rest and recuperate. Hope you get better soon.\n\nYour attitude is amazing! You have so much positive energy and I know you'll find renewed strength during this difficult time.\n\nI’d love to visit and laugh with you soon.\n\nYou’re surrounded by so much love. I hope you can feel that from me.\n\nAvoid making promises you can’t keep in a get well card\n\nEven though people have the best intentions, saying “I know you’ll be fine” or “you’ll be 100% in a month” can feel discouraging in serious situations. Instead, be mindful of what you don’t know, and leave prognoses to medical professionals.\n\nAvoid comparisons and unsolicited advice in get well messages\n\nIt’s natural to want to find something in common with a person’s situation. But every patient and every circumstance is unique. Drawing a parallel with your own illness or another person’s outcome or treatment can be disheartening or set unrealistic expectations. Don’t offer advice if you’re not asked.\n\nDon’t be negative\n\nAgain, it’s tempting to make comparisons with other situations you know about. But avoid sharing stories about someone who died or who experienced long-lasting effects from a similar illness or injury. Don’t talk about what’s going wrong while that person’s laid up. If someone looks worse for wear, zip your lips. People have plenty of their own worries without any help.\n\nThink carefully about using humor\n\nThere’s a time and a place for jokes, and you’re wise to consider both before you try to get someone to smile. It might be a really bad day. There might be circumstances of which you’re not aware. Be mindful about the relationship you have with that person, too. The better you know them, the better you can read the situation. And remember, something you write might sound fine in your head but come across all wrong in a note.\n\nInspirational Get Well Soon Quotes\n\nSharing some wisdom and inspiration is a great addition to get well soon cards. Consider a person’s personality, religious, and cultural views. Here are a few warm thoughts to wish them a speedy recovery:\n\nI look forward to having your light back in my life. Get well soon.\n\nHugs and humor are like sunshine and water to the body. Hope you’re healthy and laughing again soon.\n\n“We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.” —A.P.J. Absul Kalam\n\nTough times don’t last, tough people do.\n\n“I know God will not give me anything I can’t handle. I just wish He didn’t trust me so much.” —Mother Teresa\n\n“Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.” —Charles R. Swendoll\n\n“Accept the challenges so that you can feel the exhilaration of victory.”—George S. Patton\n\n“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.” —Helen Keller\n\n“Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.” —C.S. Lewis\n\nReligious Get Well Messages\n\nReligious-based messages of healing can renew the faith of a close friend or family member. Keep any denominational differences in mind. Here are a few ideas:\n\nI’m praying for your quick recovery. God will take good care of you.\n\nMay God’s love surround you and your family during your illness.\n\nIllness is a reminder that we need God’s blessings. I’m praying you’ll get all the blessings you need.\n\nGod answers prayers. I pray that you’ll be better soon.\n\nThe Lord can heal you. Keep the faith and keep praying. I will!\n\nFaith and prayer are the best kinds of medicine.\n\n“God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.” —Psalm 46:1\n\n“And [God] shall heal the breast of the believers.” —at-Tawba, 9:14\n\n“And when I am ill, it is [God] who cures me.” —Ash-Shu’ara, The Poets: 26:80\n\n“The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him and I am helped.” —Psalm 28:7\n\nWhatever the right get well message is for your situation, get writing. Genuine care makes a real difference in people’s lives—we are privileged to see it happen daily. We hope to help you put your best wishes into a get well card or get well gift. We hope you and the people you care about do, too."
