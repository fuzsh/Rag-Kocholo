        "text": "I believe it was because your fetch, which only fetches remote refs and commits, didn't give you a local master branch to checkout. Since you were in an empty repo, you were never on a branch, so your git checkout had no master branch to go to.\n\nYou could directly checkout the remote master by explicitly naming it with git checkout origin/master but that will leave you in a detached head state.\n\nOnce you did the pull, it fetched and merged, the pull created a local master to track the remote master.\n\nI was having the same error trying to migrate svn to git. Here was my fix.\n\nConfirm you've initialized the git repo:\n\ngit init\n\nConfirm you actually had a valid migration from svn:\n\ngit branch --remote #You should see this output: #git-svn\n\nCreate a detached head:\n\ngit checkout git-svn\n\nConvert the detached head into the master branch:\n\ngit checkout -b master\n\nAt this point your git repo will function normally."
