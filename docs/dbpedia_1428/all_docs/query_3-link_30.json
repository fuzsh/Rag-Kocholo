MSDH has not reviewed this translation and is not responsible for any inaccuracies.\n\nDistracted driving endangers drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike. Distracted driving is a common occurrence in Mississippi with three quarters of current adult drivers reporting they have talked on a cell phone while driving and one-third admitting they have read, written, or sent a text message while driving. (Centers for MS Healthy Policy Brief, 2010)\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 10% of fatal accidents and 17% of injuries in accidents involved distracted drivers in 2011, and distracted driving was responsible for 3,331 deaths.\n\nTips for Phone-Free Driving\n\nBefore You Drive\n\nIn a 2008 survey, work-related phone calls were responsible for distracted driving 39 percent of the time. Employer policies can reduce this risk and make driving safer.\n\nDevelop a habit of turning off your cell phone when you get in your vehicle, and turning it back on when you are done driving.\n\nPut your cell phone in your trunk to avoid temptation.\n\nRecord a voice mail greeting telling callers it is not safe to make calls while driving, and you will return their call as soon as you are able.\n\nOrganize your route and schedule to allow time to make and return phone calls from the parking lot of one location before leaving to drive to the next one. This strategy has helped employees who drive frequently to maintain productivity and accessibility.\n\nWhile You Drive\n\nMississippi Law\n\nIn Mississippi, novice drivers (drivers with an intermediate license or temporary permit) are prohibited from texting while driving. (§63-1-73)\n\nDo not make or answer cell phone calls, even with hands-free and voice recognition devices. If you must make an emergency call, leave the road and park in a safe area.\n\nDo not send or read text messages or email.\n\nHave a passenger use the phone for you.\n\nLet someone else drive so that you can freely make or receive calls.\n\nEnjoy phone-free driving; focus on the road. Protect your life and those around you.\n\nMore\n\nFor More tips, visit:\n\nAre You at Risk from Distracted Driving?\n\nWhile driving, do you . . .\n\nThink you can safely look away for more than one second?\n\nEat, drink, shave, or engage in other personal activities?\n\nText or talk on your cell phone?\n\nAnswer your cell phone without stopping in a safe place?\n\nListen to anything that requires ear buds in your ears?\n\nFeel fatigued or drowsy?\n\nTry to deal with children or pets without stopping?\n\nIf you said yes to even one item, you are at risk.\n\nNearly 80% of all crashes and 65% of all near-crashes involved driver distraction during the last 3 seconds before the incident."
