        "text": "How common is prostate cancer?\n\nThe American Cancer Society’s estimates for prostate cancer in the United States for 2024 are:\n\nAbout 299,010 new cases of prostate cancer\n\nAbout 35,250 deaths from prostate cancer\n\nThe number of prostate cancers diagnosed each year declined sharply from 2007 to 2014, coinciding with fewer men being screened because of changes in screening recommendations. Since 2014, however, the incidence rate has increased by 3% per year overall and by about 5% per year for advanced-stage prostate cancer.\n\nRisk of getting prostate cancer\n\nAbout 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. But each man’s risk of prostate cancer can vary, based on his age, race/ethnicity, and other factors.\n\nFor example, prostate cancer is more likely to develop in older men. About 6 in 10 prostate cancers are diagnosed in men who are 65 or older, and it is rare in men under 40. The average age of men when they are first diagnosed is about 67.\n\nProstate cancer risk is also higher in African American men and in Caribbean men of African ancestry than in men of other races.\n\nTo learn more, see Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer.\n\nDeaths from prostate cancer\n\nProstate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, behind only lung cancer. About 1 in 44 men will die of prostate cancer.\n\nProstate cancer can be a serious disease, but most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die from it. In fact, more than 3.3 million men in the United States who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point are still alive today.\n\nThe prostate cancer death rate declined by about half from 1993 to 2013, most likely due to earlier detection and advances in treatment. In recent years, the death rate has stabilized, likely reflecting the rise in cancers being found at an advanced stage.\n\nFor statistics related to survival, see Survival Rates for Prostate Cancer."
