        "text": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — As the number of deadly vehicle accidents continues to rise nationwide, a new study has ranked the cities with the worst drivers — and a New Mexico city has topped the list.\n\n“Albuquerque, New Mexico is the most dangerous city in America to drive in, with high incidents of fatal car accidents, drunk drivers and distracted drivers,” reads the Forbes Advisor report.\n\nForbes’ Advisor’s analysts say they compared the country’s 50 most populated cities across five key metrics, including the number of fatal car crashes involving a drunken or distracted driver.\n\n“Our analysis identifies the cities where drivers engage in the most hazardous behavior that threatens public safety,” the report said.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee, and Detroit, Michigan, rounded out the top three respectively, while two cities in Arizona — Tucson and Phoenix — made the top 10.\n\nAlbuquerque has the most fatal distracted-driving accidents, while Memphis leads in the number of fatal drunken-driving crashes, according to the report.\n\nBelow is a look at the top 10 cities with the worst drivers, according to Forbes.\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nTucson, Arizona\n\nKansas City, Missouri\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nLouisville, Kentucky\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nFort Worth, Texas\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nConversely, the city with the best drivers on the list was Boston, with three California cities — San Francisco, Oakland and San Diego — making the top 10.\n\nThe top 10 cities with the best drivers, according to Forbes, are as follows:\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nNew York, New York\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOakland, California\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\nSan Diego, California\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nThe report also noted how driving behavior impacts insurance rates: the more dangerous the reported behavior, the more a driver can expect to pay.\n\n\"Getting speeding tickets, running red lights, texting while driving and other reckless behaviors all raise your chances of accidents and damage claims,\" the report said. \"This makes you a greater liability in the eyes of insurers.\""
