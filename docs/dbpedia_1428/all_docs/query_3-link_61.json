        "text": "What is diabetes?\n\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body can't make enough insulin, or can't use insulin normally. Insulin is a hormone. It helps sugar (glucose) in the blood get into cells of the body to be used as fuel. When glucose can’t enter the cells, it builds up in the blood. This leads to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia).\n\nHigh blood sugar can cause problems all over the body. It can damage blood vessels and nerves. It can harm the eyes, kidneys, and heart. In early pregnancy, high blood sugar can lead to birth defects in a growing baby.\n\nThere are 3 types of diabetes:\n\nType 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder. The body's immune system damages the cells in the pancreas that make insulin.\n\nType 2 diabetes. This is when the body can’t make enough insulin or use it normally. It’s not an autoimmune disease.\n\nGestational diabetes. This is a condition in which the blood glucose level goes up and other diabetic symptoms appear during pregnancy in a woman who has not been diagnosed with diabetes before. It happens in about 3 in 100 to 9 in 100 pregnant women.\n\nWhat causes diabetes during pregnancy?\n\nSome women have diabetes before they get pregnant. This is called pregestational diabetes. Other women may get a type of diabetes that only happens in pregnancy. This is called gestational diabetes. Pregnancy can change how a woman's body uses glucose. This can make diabetes worse, or lead to gestational diabetes.\n\nDuring pregnancy, an organ called the placenta gives a growing baby nutrients and oxygen. The placenta also makes hormones. In late pregnancy, the hormones estrogen, cortisol, and human placental lactogen can block insulin. When insulin is blocked, it’s called insulin resistance. Glucose can't go into the body’s cells. The glucose stays in the blood and makes the blood sugar levels go up.\n\nWho is at risk for diabetes during pregnancy?\n\nThe risk factors for diabetes in pregnancy depend on the type of diabetes:\n\nType 1 diabetes often occurs in children or young adults, but it can start at any age.\n\nOverweight women are more likely to have Type 2 diabetes.\n\nOverweight women are more likely to have gestational diabetes. It’s also more common in women who have had gestational diabetes before. And it’s more common in women who have a family member with Type 2 diabetes. Women with twins or other multiples are also more likely to have it.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes during pregnancy?\n\nThere are no common symptoms of diabetes. Most women don't know they have it until they get tested.\n\nHow is diabetes during pregnancy diagnosed?\n\nNearly all nondiabetic pregnant women are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. A glucose screening test is given during this time. For the test, you drink a glucose drink and have your blood glucose levels tested after 2 hours.\n\nIf this test shows a high blood glucose level, a 3-hour glucose tolerance test will be done. If results of the second test are not normal, gestational diabetes is diagnosed.\n\nHow is diabetes during pregnancy treated?\n\nTreatment will depend on your symptoms, your age, and your general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.\n\nTreatment focuses on keeping blood glucose levels in the normal range, and may include:\n\nA careful diet with low amounts of carbohydrate foods and drinks\n\nExercise\n\nBlood glucose monitoring\n\nInsulin injections\n\nOral medicines for hypoglycemia\n\nWhat are possible complications of diabetes during pregnancy?\n\nMost complications happen in women who already have diabetes before they get pregnant. Possible complications include:\n\nNeed for insulin injections more often\n\nVery low blood glucose levels, which can be life-threatening if untreated\n\nKetoacidosis from high levels of blood glucose, which may also be life-threatening if untreated\n\nWomen with gestational diabetes are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in later life. They are also more likely to have gestational diabetes with another pregnancy. If you have gestational diabetes you should get tested a few months after your baby is born and every 3 years after that.\n\nPossible complications for the baby include:\n\nStillbirth (fetal death). Stillbirth is more likely in pregnant women with diabetes. The baby may grow slowly in the uterus due to poor circulation or other conditions, such as high blood pressure or damaged small blood vessels. The exact reason stillbirths happen with diabetes is not known. The risk of stillbirth goes up in women with poor blood glucose control and with blood vessel changes.\n\nBirth defects. Birth defects are more likely in babies of diabetic mothers. Some birth defects are serious enough to cause stillbirth. Birth defects usually occur in the first trimester of pregnancy. Babies of diabetic mothers may have major birth defects in the heart and blood vessels, brain and spine, urinary system and kidneys, and digestive system.\n\nMacrosomia. This is the term for a baby that is much larger than normal. All of the nutrients the baby gets come directly from the mother's blood. If the mother's blood has too much sugar, the pancreas of the baby makes more insulin to use this glucose. This causes fat to form and the baby grows very large.\n\nBirth injury. Birth injury may occur due to the baby's large size and difficulty being born.\n\nHypoglycemia. The baby may have low levels of blood glucose right after delivery. This problem occurs if the mother's blood glucose levels have been high for a long time. This leads to a lot of insulin in the baby’s blood. After delivery, the baby continues to have a high insulin level, but no longer has the glucose from the mother. This causes the newborn's blood glucose level to get very low. The baby's blood glucose level is checked after birth. If the level is too low, the baby may need glucose in an IV.\n\nTrouble breathing (respiratory distress). Too much insulin or too much glucose in a baby's system may keep the lungs from growing fully. This can cause breathing problems in babies. This is more likely in babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nPreeclampsia. Women with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for preeclampsia during pregnancy. To lower the risk, they should take low-dose aspirin (60 to150 mg a day) from the end of the first trimester until the baby is born .\n\nCan diabetes during pregnancy be prevented?\n\nNot all types of diabetes can be prevented. Type 1 diabetes usually starts when a person is young. Type 2 diabetes may be avoided by losing weight. Healthy food choices and exercise can also help prevent Type 2 diabetes.\n\nHow is diabetes during pregnancy managed?\n\nSpecial testing and monitoring of the baby may be needed for pregnant diabetics, especially those who are taking insulin. This is because of the increased risk for stillbirth. These tests may include:\n\nFetal movement counting. This means counting the number of movements or kicks in a certain period of time, and watching for a change in activity.\n\nUltrasound. This is an imaging test that uses sound waves and a computer to create images of blood vessels, tissues, and organs. Ultrasounds are used to view internal organs as they function, and to look at blood flow through blood vessels.\n\nNonstress testing. This is a test that measured the baby’s heart rate in response to movements.\n\nBiophysical profile. This is a measure that combines tests such as the nonstress test and ultrasound to check the baby's movements, heart rate, and amniotic fluid.\n\nDoppler flow studies. This is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to measure blood flow.\n\nA baby of a diabetic mother may be delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. It will depend on your health, and how much your pregnancy care provider thinks the baby weighs. Your pregnancy care provider may advise a test called amniocentesis in the last weeks of pregnancy. This test takes out some of the fluid from the bag of waters. Testing the fluid can tell if the baby's lungs are mature. The lungs mature more slowly in babies whose mothers have diabetes. If the lungs are mature, the healthcare provider may advise induced labor or a cesarean delivery.\n\nKey points about diabetes during pregnancy\n\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body can't produce enough insulin, or it can't use it normally.\n\nThere are 3 types of diabetes: Type 1, tType 2, and gestational diabetes.\n\nNearly all pregnant women without diabetes are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nTreatment for diabetes focuses on keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range.\n\nWomen with gestational diabetes are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in later life. Follow-up testing is important.\n\nNext steps\n\nTips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:\n\nKnow the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.\n\nBefore your visit, write down questions you want answered.\n\nBring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.\n\nAt the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.\n\nKnow why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are.\n\nAsk if your condition can be treated in other ways.\n\nKnow why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.\n\nKnow what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.\n\nIf you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.\n\nKnow how you can contact your provider if you have questions."
