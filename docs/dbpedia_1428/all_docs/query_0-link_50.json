        "text": "At the heart of most wrongful death cases is negligence. As humans, we all bear responsibilities to others. As we go about our daily lives, we must consider others around us. If someone’s carelessness causes injury or death, Michigan law holds him or her accountable.\n\nCar and motorcycle accidents\n\nDid you know that distracted drivers killed over 3,000 people and injured another 431,000 within only one year in the United States? Excessive speed, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and other reckless behaviors have led to countless fatal accidents over the years.\n\nMichigan law identifies several behaviors as potentially distracting while operating a motor vehicle:\n\nReading, typing, or sending text messages\n\nUsing a cell phone (except voice-operated options)\n\nEating and drinking\n\nUsing a navigational system\n\nOperating the radio or other controls\n\nGrooming\n\nAttending to children\n\nReading (anything, including maps)\n\nTaking eyes off the road\n\nTaking hands off the wheel\n\nIf your loved one died in a motor vehicle accident caused by a careless driver, a wrongful death attorney can help you employ Michigan law to hold the at-fault driver responsible for his or her actions. This may be your only chance to get justice for your loved one.\n\nWhy not consult with one of our Michigan wrongful death attorneys? He or she can examine the evidence to determine if negligence played a role in your loved one’s fatal crash. We offer free consultations for the family members of anyone killed in a car accident.\n\nMedical malpractice\n\nSometimes healthcare professionals fail us by causing unnecessary pain and suffering. Do you suspect negligence played a role in any aspect of your family member’s healthcare management? Medical malpractice might encompass:\n\nAnesthesia\n\nDiagnosis\n\nTreatment\n\nInsufficient information concerning risks\n\nFaulty medical devices\n\nSurgery\n\nAftercare\n\nTransport\n\nIf medical staff caused injury to your relative, call 855-MIKE-WINS and let us know. Mike Morse Law Firm can get to the bottom of your case. As the largest personal injury law firm in Michigan, we have the resources to investigate medical malpractice cases thoroughly to build you a strong case.\n\nNursing home patient abuse and neglect\n\nThe last place you might expect to find negligence is in a nursing home. After all, most people place their loved ones in nursing facilities to get extra care and attention. Yet, the research reveals why the elderly and infirm are particularly vulnerable in residential settings: Many suffer from cognitive or physical limitations that increase their dependence on others.\n\nElder abuse may involve:\n\nPhysical harm\n\nUnreasonable confinement\n\nUnnecessary medication\n\nCruel punishment\n\nNonconsensual sexual attention\n\nPsychological abuse\n\nDenial of food, drink, or hygiene to control behavior\n\n“Neglect” refers to the failure to provide care according to reasonable standards, resulting in physical harm, mental illness, or death. Nonverbal patients may be unable to report abuse, and others hesitate to do so out of fear of retaliation. We must therefore be their voice. A Michigan wrongful death lawyer can seek legal damages if abuse or negligence fatally harmed your family member. Schedule an appointment with our law firm for free legal advice.\n\nProduct malfunction\n\nThere are times when the products we purchase do not live up to expectations. Yet, a product should never be unreasonably dangerous to use. When it is, Michigan product liability law protects consumers from:\n\nDesign flaws that make the product unsafe\n\nManufacturing defects resulting from insufficient quality control during production\n\nInadequate or missing warning labels that leave consumers ignorant of the risk of serious harm\n\nMedical device failure\n\nFiguring out why and how a product is defective is no easy task. Industry experts may need to examine the item or equipment. Because we understand the process, we can take the steps to prove that an item or piece of machinery is hazardous. Our competent Michigan lawyers are ready to go the distance if a product causes a personal injury or wrongful death.\n\nA successful product liability claim would provide substantial compensation for damages, including medical bills and lost wages. Taking action now might also prompt recall or reform of faulty products, ensuring the safety of other families.\n\nWork accidents\n\nWorker’s compensation provides for employees who suffer an injury on the job. This system will replace a portion of lost wages and reimburse qualifying medical and rehabilitation benefits. In most cases, your employer may file a claim for you.\n\nIf the employer’s insurance company disputes your claim, you may still have grounds for a wrongful death settlement. A lawyer can investigate the accident to determine who is liable for the accident.\n\nAs discussed above, for example, product flaws can cause serious injury. If a product manufacturer or distributor was behind work or safety equipment failure, you can pursue damages on behalf of your relative.\n\nWe can answer your questions about work accidents. Take a few moments to fill out the form for a free client consultation. We will get back to you within 24 hours!\n\nWhen a person dies due to negligence, abuse, medical malpractice, faulty products, or otherwise, Michigan wrongful death law allows beneficiaries to recover damages from the person or corporation responsible.\n\nUsually, beneficiaries are related to the deceased or serve as personal representatives for the estate and may be the:\n\nSpouse\n\nChild\n\nDescendent\n\nParent\n\nGrandparent\n\nSibling\n\nChildren of the surviving spouse\n\nIn Michigan, you can seek two main types of damages for wrongful death claims. Pecuniary damages include financial injury that resulted from the fatal event:\n\nLoss of support presents a large problem for many families after an unexpected death. So you are entitled to demand compensation for the income that your loved one would have earned had he or she lived.\n\nMedical expenses can multiply rapidly after a severe injury. Michigan wrongful death lawsuits can help you recover what you spend on medical transport, treatment, surgery, and other costs related to the fatal accident.\n\nFuneral and burial expenses are often included as damages in a wrongful death settlement.\n\nLoss of household services refers to the monetary value of the household services that the deceased party contributed to the household. For instance, if your family member cared for the children, you may be entitled to that service’s replacement value – the cost of childcare.\n\nOf course, the pain and suffering of wrongful death goes beyond financial losses. When serious or intentional wrongdoing is involved, you may seek punitive damages on behalf of your family member. In some states, a court might use damages to punish people for wrong actions and discourage others from similar behavior. The State of Michigan does not allow punitive damages for punishment, but it has allowed these damages in extreme cases.\n\nAn attorney from our Michigan law firm can advise you about what damages you are eligible to seek for your wrongful death claim. Since opening our doors 25 years ago, we have won over $1 billion for our Michigan clients. Why not see what we can do for you?\n\nRemember, we offer Michigan residents a free consultation to explore your legal rights. And you pay no fees until we win your Michigan wrongful death case. Schedule an appointment at a time convenient for you by calling 855-MIKE-WINS as soon as possible."
