        "text": "It is not an expression currently in use. It means an ability that one is born with, not one that is learned. Nowadays instead of saying \"He has a fatal facilty.\" we might say \"He is naturally gifted\".\n\nIt comes from the idea that one has a \"fate\". It is the gifted author's fate to be able to write well.\n\nFor example a magazine from 1926 notes\n\nThe worst obstacle an artist need fear to encounter is a fatal facility\n\n(a gifted artist will not learn the skills of practice, and so won't exceed their gift)\n\nI am always sorry to disagree with @JamesK and very rarely do so, but his answer does not to my mind really explain what might be fatal about facility. The point is that if you find that you can do something in some field of endeavour (write, draw, understand mathematical concepts) without any effort at all, you may fall into the temptation that you need never exert yourself in that field again. In that sense your 'facility' (that is, your easy ability to do well) is \"fatal\" to your ability to do exceptionally well in that field. You may find that you are 'coasting' - moving along at high speed without exerting yourself. If only you worked harder, how brilliant you could be!"
