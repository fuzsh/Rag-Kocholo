        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nRomeo and Juliet separate at the first light of day. Almost immediately her mother comes to announce that Juliet must marry Paris. When Juliet refuses, her father becomes enraged and vows to put her out on the streets. The Nurse recommends that Juliet forget the banished Romeo and regard Paris as a more desirable husband. Juliet is secretly outraged at the Nurse’s advice and decides to seek Friar Lawrence’s help.\n\nEnter Romeo and Juliet aloft.\n\nJULIET\n\n2057 Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\n\n2058 It was the nightingale, and not the lark,\n\n2059 That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.\n\np. 157\n\n2060 Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\n\n2061 5 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\n\nROMEO\n\n2062 It was the lark, the herald of the morn,\n\n2063 No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\n\n2064 Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\n\n2065 Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\n\n2066 10 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.\n\n2067 I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\n\nJULIET\n\n2068 Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\n\n2069 It is some meteor that the sun ⌜exhaled⌝\n\n2070 To be to thee this night a torchbearer\n\n2071 15 And light thee on thy way to Mantua.\n\n2072 Therefore stay yet. Thou need’st not to be gone.\n\nROMEO\n\n2073 Let me be ta’en; let me be put to death.\n\n2074 I am content, so thou wilt have it so.\n\n2075 I’ll say yon gray is not the morning’s eye;\n\n2076 20 ’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.\n\n2077 Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\n\n2078 The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\n\n2079 I have more care to stay than will to go.\n\n2080 Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\n\n2081 25 How is ’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.\n\nJULIET\n\n2082 It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!\n\n2083 It is the lark that sings so out of tune,\n\n2084 Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\n\n2085 Some say the lark makes sweet division.\n\n2086 30 This doth not so, for she divideth us.\n\n2087 Some say the lark and loathèd toad ⌜changed⌝ eyes.\n\n2088 O, now I would they had changed voices too,\n\n2089 Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\n\n2090 Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\n\n2091 35 O, now begone. More light and light it grows.\n\np. 159\n\nROMEO\n\n2092 More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\n\nEnter Nurse.\n\nNURSE 2093 Madam.\n\nJULIET 2094 Nurse?\n\nNURSE\n\n2095 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.\n\n2096 40 The day is broke; be wary; look about.⌜She exits.⌝\n\nJULIET\n\n2097 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.\n\nROMEO\n\n2098 Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I’ll descend.\n\n⌜They kiss, and Romeo descends.⌝\n\nJULIET\n\n2099 Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend!\n\n2100 I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\n\n2101 45 For in a minute there are many days.\n\n2102 O, by this count I shall be much in years\n\n2103 Ere I again behold my Romeo.\n\nROMEO 2104 Farewell.\n\n2105 I will omit no opportunity\n\n2106 50 That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\n\nJULIET\n\n2107 O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?\n\nROMEO\n\n2108 I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\n\n2109 For sweet discourses in our times to come.\n\n⌜JULIET⌝\n\n2110 O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\n\n2111 55 Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,\n\n2112 As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\n\n2113 Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.\n\nROMEO\n\n2114 And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\n\n2115 Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.He exits.\n\np. 161\n\nJULIET\n\n2116 60 O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.\n\n2117 If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\n\n2118 That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,\n\n2119 For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,\n\n2120 But send him back.\n\nEnter ⌜Lady Capulet.⌝\n\nLADY CAPULET 2121 65 Ho, daughter, are you up?\n\nJULIET\n\n2122 Who is ’t that calls? It is my lady mother.\n\n2123 Is she not down so late or up so early?\n\n2124 What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?\n\n⌜Juliet descends.⌝\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2125 Why, how now, Juliet?\n\nJULIET 2126 70 Madam, I am not well.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2127 Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?\n\n2128 What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\n\n2129 An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\n\n2130 Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of\n\n2131 75 love,\n\n2132 But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\n\nJULIET\n\n2133 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2134 So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\n\n2135 Which you weep for.\n\nJULIET 2136 80 Feeling so the loss,\n\n2137 I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2138 Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death\n\n2139 As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.\n\nJULIET\n\n2140 What villain, madam?\n\np. 163\n\nLADY CAPULET 2141 85 That same villain, Romeo.\n\nJULIET, ⌜aside⌝\n\n2142 Villain and he be many miles asunder.—\n\n2143 God pardon ⌜him.⌝ I do with all my heart,\n\n2144 And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2145 That is because the traitor murderer lives.\n\nJULIET\n\n2146 90 Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\n\n2147 Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2148 We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\n\n2149 Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,\n\n2150 Where that same banished runagate doth live,\n\n2151 95 Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram\n\n2152 That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.\n\n2153 And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.\n\nJULIET\n\n2154 Indeed, I never shall be satisfied\n\n2155 With Romeo till I behold him—dead—\n\n2156 100 Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.\n\n2157 Madam, if you could find out but a man\n\n2158 To bear a poison, I would temper it,\n\n2159 That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\n\n2160 Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\n\n2161 105 To hear him named and cannot come to him\n\n2162 To wreak the love I bore my cousin\n\n2163 Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2164 Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.\n\n2165 But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\n\nJULIET\n\n2166 110 And joy comes well in such a needy time.\n\n2167 What are they, beseech your Ladyship?\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2168 Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,\n\np. 165\n\n2169 One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\n\n2170 Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy\n\n2171 115 That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.\n\nJULIET\n\n2172 Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2173 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\n\n2174 The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\n\n2175 The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church\n\n2176 120 Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\n\nJULIET\n\n2177 Now, by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,\n\n2178 He shall not make me there a joyful bride!\n\n2179 I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\n\n2180 Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.\n\n2181 125 I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,\n\n2182 I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear\n\n2183 It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\n\n2184 Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2185 Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\n\n2186 130 And see how he will take it at your hands.\n\nEnter Capulet and Nurse.\n\nCAPULET\n\n2187 When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,\n\n2188 But for the sunset of my brother’s son\n\n2189 It rains downright.\n\n2190 How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\n\n2191 135 Evermore show’ring? In one little body\n\n2192 Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.\n\n2193 For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\n\n2194 Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\n\n2195 Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,\n\n2196 140 Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,\n\n2197 Without a sudden calm, will overset\n\np. 167\n\n2198 Thy tempest-tossèd body.—How now, wife?\n\n2199 Have you delivered to her our decree?\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2200 Ay, sir, but she will none, she ⌜gives⌝ you thanks.\n\n2201 145 I would the fool were married to her grave.\n\nCAPULET\n\n2202 Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.\n\n2203 How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\n\n2204 Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,\n\n2205 Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\n\n2206 150 So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?\n\nJULIET\n\n2207 Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\n\n2208 Proud can I never be of what I hate,\n\n2209 But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\n\nCAPULET\n\n2210 How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?\n\n2211 155 “Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,”\n\n2212 And yet “not proud”? Mistress minion you,\n\n2213 Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\n\n2214 But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next\n\n2215 To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,\n\n2216 160 Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\n\n2217 Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\n\n2218 You tallow face!\n\nLADY CAPULET 2219 Fie, fie, what, are you mad?\n\nJULIET, ⌜kneeling⌝\n\n2220 Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\n\n2221 165 Hear me with patience but to speak a word.\n\nCAPULET\n\n2222 Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!\n\n2223 I tell thee what: get thee to church o’ Thursday,\n\n2224 Or never after look me in the face.\n\n2225 Speak not; reply not; do not answer me.\n\n2226 170 My fingers itch.—Wife, we scarce thought us\n\n2227 blessed\n\np. 169\n\n2228 That God had lent us but this only child,\n\n2229 But now I see this one is one too much,\n\n2230 And that we have a curse in having her.\n\n2231 175 Out on her, hilding.\n\nNURSE 2232 God in heaven bless her!\n\n2233 You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\n\nCAPULET\n\n2234 And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.\n\n2235 Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.\n\nNURSE\n\n2236 180 I speak no treason.\n\n⌜CAPULET⌝ 2237 O, God ’i’ g’ eden!\n\n⌜NURSE⌝\n\n2238 May not one speak?\n\nCAPULET 2239 Peace, you mumbling fool!\n\n2240 Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,\n\n2241 185 For here we need it not.\n\nLADY CAPULET 2242 You are too hot.\n\nCAPULET 2243 God’s bread, it makes me mad.\n\n2244 Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,\n\n2245 Alone, in company, still my care hath been\n\n2246 190 To have her matched. And having now provided\n\n2247 A gentleman of noble parentage,\n\n2248 Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ⌜ligned,⌝\n\n2249 Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,\n\n2250 Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man—\n\n2251 195 And then to have a wretched puling fool,\n\n2252 A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,\n\n2253 To answer “I’ll not wed. I cannot love.\n\n2254 I am too young. I pray you, pardon me.”\n\n2255 But, an you will not wed, I’ll pardon you!\n\n2256 200 Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.\n\n2257 Look to ’t; think on ’t. I do not use to jest.\n\n2258 Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise.\n\n2259 An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.\n\np. 171\n\n2260 An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\n\n2261 205 For, by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,\n\n2262 Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.\n\n2263 Trust to ’t; bethink you. I’ll not be forsworn.\n\nHe exits.\n\nJULIET\n\n2264 Is there no pity sitting in the clouds\n\n2265 That sees into the bottom of my grief?—\n\n2266 210 O sweet my mother, cast me not away.\n\n2267 Delay this marriage for a month, a week,\n\n2268 Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed\n\n2269 In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n2270 Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.\n\n2271 215 Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.\n\nShe exits.\n\nJULIET, ⌜rising⌝\n\n2272 O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\n\n2273 My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.\n\n2274 How shall that faith return again to Earth\n\n2275 Unless that husband send it me from heaven\n\n2276 220 By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.—\n\n2277 Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems\n\n2278 Upon so soft a subject as myself.—\n\n2279 What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\n\n2280 Some comfort, nurse.\n\nNURSE 2281 225 Faith, here it is.\n\n2282 Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing\n\n2283 That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you,\n\n2284 Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\n\n2285 Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,\n\n2286 230 I think it best you married with the County.\n\n2287 O, he’s a lovely gentleman!\n\n2288 Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\n\n2289 Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\n\n2290 As Paris hath.

Go, counselor.\n\n2309 Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\n\n2310 I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.\n\n2311 255 If all else fail, myself have power to die.\n\nShe exits."
