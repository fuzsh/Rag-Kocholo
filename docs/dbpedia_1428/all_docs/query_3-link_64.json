        "text": "WRITTEN BY: Beyond Type 1 Editorial Team\n\nAbout Jesse Was Here\n\nJesse Was Here—a program of Beyond Type 1—provides resources, support and tools for those navigating life after a type 1 diabetes (T1D) death.\n\nHere you will find:\n\nResources for the early days, weeks and months—from planning a service or creating a memorial fund to thoughtfully removing your loved one from social media or explaining T1D to others.\n\nStories from those who have experienced loss—some after living with T1D, others due to a missed diagnosis.\n\nConnection with others—fellow parents, siblings, spouses or loved ones—in a private Facebook group for parents and siblings.\n\nOpportunities to celebrate your loved one through legacy projects, raise awareness about T1D or support others navigating loss.\n\nAdditional content as we build this vital resource.\n\nFor Spanish, visit our Spanish page.\n\nInspiration\n\nJesse Was Here was inspired by Michelle Bauer Alswager’s experience after the sudden death of her 13-year-old son, Jesse, from type 1 diabetes. Grieving the loss of her child, and the potential loss of the diabetes community, she created an online community to support parents who had also lost their children to type 1 diabetes.\n\nBy connecting with others who shared her experience, she realized many of those seeking support and opportunities to honor their loved ones struggle with unexpected funeral expenses, ongoing medical bills and sometimes even the funds for a headstone.\n\nThrough her efforts, she discovered many others—not just parents of young children—were looking for peer support, practical information, coping tools and financial assistance. Working together, Michelle and the team at Beyond Type 1 are creating a very special program to serve this unique and deserving community.\n\nFor parents\n\nPlease consider joining the private support group for parents on Facebook.\n\nFrom Coping to Healing (And Everything in Between) — An Interview with Michelle Bauer\n\nMichelle Bauer sits down with Beyond Type 1 to discuss her newest book, Jesse Was Here (More Lasagna, Please): Feeding the Soul of a Grieving Mother.
