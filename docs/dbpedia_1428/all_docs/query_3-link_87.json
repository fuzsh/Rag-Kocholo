        "text": "After enabling Two Factor Authentication (2FA), you may see something like this when attempting to use git clone, git fetch, git pull or git push:\n\n$ git push origin master Username for 'https://github.com': your_user_name Password for 'https://[email protected]': remote: Invalid username or password. fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/your_user_name/repo_name.git/'\n\nWhy this is happening\n\nFrom the GitHub Help documentation:\n\nAfter 2FA is enabled you will need to enter a personal access token instead of a 2FA code and your GitHub password.\n\n...\n\nFor example, when you access a repository using Git on the command line using commands like git clone, git fetch, git pull or git push with HTTPS URLs, you must provide your GitHub username and your personal access token when prompted for a username and password. The command line prompt won't specify that you should enter your personal access token when it asks for your password.\n\nHow to fix it\n\nGenerate a Personal Access Token. (Detailed guide on Creating a personal access token for the command line.)\n\nCopy the Personal Access Token.\n\nRe-attempt the command you were trying and use Personal Access Token in the place of your password.\n\nRelated question: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21374369/101662\n\nhttps://[email protected]/eurydyce/MDANSE.git is not an ssh url, it is an https one (which would require your GitHub account name, instead of 'git').\n\nTry to use ssh://[email protected]:eurydyce/MDANSE.git or just [email protected]:eurydyce/MDANSE.git\n\ngit remote set-url origin [email protected]:eurydyce/MDANSE.git\n\nThe OP Pellegrini Eric adds:\n\nThat's what I did in my ~/.gitconfig file that contains currently the following entries [remote \"origin\"] [email protected]:eurydyce/MDANSE.git\n\nThis should not be in your global config (the one in ~/).\n\nYou could check git config -l in your repo: that url should be declared in the local config: <yourrepo>/.git/config.\n\nSo make sure you are in the repo path when doing the git remote set-url command.\n\nAs noted in Oliver's answer, an HTTPS URL would not use username/password if two-factor authentication (2FA) is activated.\n\nIn that case, the password should be a PAT (personal access token) as seen in \"Using a token on the command line\".\n\nThat applies only for HTTPS URLS, SSH is not affected by this limitation.\n\nIf like me you just updated your password and ran git push to run into this issue, then there's a super easy fix.\n\nFor Mac users only. You need to delete your OSX Keychain access entries for GitHub. You can do it via terminal by running the following commands.\n\nDeleting your credentials via the command line\n\nThrough the command line, you can use the credential helper directly to erase the keychain entry.\n\nTo do this, type the following command:\n\ngit credential-osxkeychain erase host=github.com protocol=https # [Now Press Return]\n\nIf it's successful, nothing will print out. To test that it works, try and clone a repository from GitHub or run your previous action again like in my case git push. If you are prompted for a password, the keychain entry was deleted.\n\nWhen using the https:// URL to connect to your remote repository, then Git will not use SSH as authentication but will instead try a basic authentication over HTTPS. Usually, you would just use the URL without a username, e.g. https://github.com/username/repository.git, and Git would then prompt you to enter both a username (your GitHub username) and your password.\n\nIf you use https://[email protected]/username/repository.git, then you have preset the username Git will use for authentication: something. Since you used https://[email protected], Git will try to log in using the git username for which your password of course doesn’t work. So you will have to use your username instead.\n\nThe alternative is actually to use SSH for authentication. That way you will avoid having to type your password all the time; and since it already seems to work, that’s what you should be using.\n\nTo do that, you need to change your remote URL though, so Git knows that it needs to connect via SSH. The format is then this: [email protected]:username/repository. To update your URL use this command:\n\ngit remote set-url origin [email protected]:username/repository\n\nNone of the answers were working for me. In my case I needed access for a given organisation. So renewing the token was not enough, I also had to grant access for that particular organisation.\n\nThis is the complete process I had to go through to restore access to the repositories of my organisation:\n\nRegenerate token (in my case I already had a token which had expired)\n\nCopy the token\n\nAdd permissions more my organisation:\n\nUse the token to access your repo, for example by doing:\n\n% git pull Username for 'https://github.com': YOUR_USER Password for 'https://[email protected]': PASTE_TOKEN\n\nSince you probably want to keep 2FA enabled for your account, you can set up a ssh key and that way you won't need to type your Github credentials every time you want to push work to Github.\n\nYou can find all the ssh setup steps in the documentation. First, make sure you don't currently have any ssh keys (id_rsa.pub, etc.) with $ ls -al ~/.ssh"
