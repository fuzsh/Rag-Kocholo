And to celebrate : the game is discounted at 50% until Sept 28th.\n\nThe Fatal Falls DLC gives players a new and alternative mid-game route for those who are tired of the Slumbering Sanctuary or want to get away from the crowds in Stilt Village.\n\nNew biomes to visit – Get some fresh air at the Fractured Shrines, splash around at the Undying Shores and take a picture at the Mausoleum\n\nNew monsters to welcome you – The Cold Blooded Guardians and their friends would love to teach you about their culture. … Wait, aren’t those relatives of yours in the Undying Shores…?\n\nNew weapons to pack for your trip – lil’ Serenade is perfect for breaking the ice with the locals, although the Snake Fangs would make for a great souvenir…\n\nNew boss to face – The Scarecrow is very proud of his gardening skills and won’t hesitate to show off"
