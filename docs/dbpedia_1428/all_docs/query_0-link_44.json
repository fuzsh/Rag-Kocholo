        "text": "MEAD, Okla (KXII) - A twenty year-old man was care flighted from the scene of a wreck in that same area on July 6 and pronounced dead the next day.\n\nWithin the last two weeks, an intersection at Streetman Road and Highway 70 in Mead, OK has become a location prone to fatal car wrecks.\n\nBobbie Kelsay, Paul Crabtree’s mother, says she yearns to hold her son one last time.\n\n“I want to hug him so bad and I want to get up in that bed and just cuddle him one more time,” said Kelsay. “But they’re not going to let me because he’s hooked up to everything.”\n\nCrabtree was care flighted to the Plano Medical City Hospital. His organs will be donated. Kelsay says her son was a loving person who will be missed by many.\n\n“Paul was a very loving, caring young man,” said Kelsay. “That’s why he decided to become an organ donor. And he just loved life. He loved everyone that loved him.”\n\nCrabtree leaves behind a stepfather and many siblings. One of those siblings is 13 yrs old with autism.\n\n“He’ll know that his brother is not here but he won’t know why.,” she said.\n\nKelsay heard of her son’s condition while at her younger child’s birthday party. After hearing the grim details of the wreck, she believes she knows the cause of the wreck.\n\n“I feel that the car was going way too fast,” said Kelsay. “My son stopped at the car stop sign. Something’s got to be done with that intersection.”\n\nA week ago News 12 spoke to a grieving wife about 55 year-old Stephan Severini who was hit and killed while trying to assist a car wreck near streetman rd.\n\nIt turns out Kelsay knew Severini and his family, and the news saddened her. But losing her own son a week later in the same vicinity, has broken her heart.\n\n“It don’t have to be yours,” said Kelsay. “And we’ve just got to do something to get a stoplight put up there. There’s just too many wrecks.”\n\nOklahoma Troopers say Crabtree failed to yield at the stop sign and was hit by an oncoming vehicle that was not at fault. Those drivers left the Durant Alliance Hospital with minor injuries.\n\nTo help Kelsay’s family with Crabtree’s funeral arrangements, you can donate to his GoFundMe."
