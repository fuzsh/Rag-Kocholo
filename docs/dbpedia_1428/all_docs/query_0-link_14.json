        "text": "After leaving the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles behind him, Bleed the Dream’s Keith Thompson returned to his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. However, fate had decided that music was not finished with him quite yet. Thompson reached out to his long-time best friend, guitarist Christian Rivera, who was serving overseas in the U.S. Army at the time and expressed his desire to start another band - a desire which was strongly shared by Rivera. In essence, the concept of Fatally Yours was born with a single exchange, sent halfway around the world.\n\n​Upon Rivera's return to American soil in the spring of 2012, the two immediately began work on Fatally Yours – a band which Thompson himself would front for a time. Thompson and Rivera quickly recruited former Rookie of the Year drummer, Justin Posner to fill out the rhythm section.\n\nIn 2013, Fatally Yours released their first EP \"Every Moment.\" The five song effort gained praise throughout the Baltimore music scene, as well as airplay on Baltimore's WIYY 98 Rock, with their songs \"Exit Sign,\" and the title track, \"Every Moment.\"\n\nFast-forward 3 years. Keith reached out to longtime friend, former aFREUDIANSLIP vocalist Billy Fisher, to join him on a track, cutting some vocals. What started as an idea led to a lot of talking and thinking, and eventually sealed the deal that Billy would take over the main vocal duties for the band. The two had been wanting to write songs together for years, so the guys saw this move as a no-brainer.\n\nAdding a second wall of guitar power was a must. Chuck Moore, a local Baltimore player, and friend was tapped to bring the fury with his guitar, and textures with his keyboard.\n\nSince their beginnings in 2012, Fatally Yours has independently released two EPs, shared the stage with major label acts such as Alice in Chains, Jane’s Addiction, Pop Evil, Coheed and Cambria, Circa Survive, Trapt, Candlebox, Saliva, Young Guns, Big Wreck, Taproot, and Adam Gontier (Three Days Grace), and have built lasting relationships with some great companies such as Coldcock Whiskey, Get'm Get'm, and Ernie Ball.\n\nThe band is now taking a fresh approach and steadily releasing new music to follow-up 2013's Every Moment, an effort which was spearheaded with the recent release of their highly anticipated and highly praised single, \"Damn Your Eyes.\"\n\nFor Fatally Yours, 2017 and beyond will be a new musical journey, with the sky’s limits as the goal to reach.\n\nShow More"
