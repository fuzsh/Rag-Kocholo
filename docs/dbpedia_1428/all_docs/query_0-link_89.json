        "text": "Sometimes music can really tug at the heartstrings. This is especially true when Valentine’s Day is around the corner, and pop-punk fivesome Grayscale may have this year’s biggest heartstring-tugger with their video for “Forever Yours,” which premieres on Billboard today (Feb. 12).\n\nThe five-minute clip starts out with some cryptic, haunting shots of a pretty girl, a shattering car windshield and emergency room nurses before Grayscale’s frontman Collin Walsh takes the mic with an acoustic guitar to tell the tale of a love that ended tragically. As the video shows Walsh and the girl happily spending time with each other, things take a dismal turn when the girl gets into a fatal car accident — a visual representation of the track’s equally heartbreaking lyrics.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n?“’Forever Yours’ is a song about regret,” Walsh tells Billboard. “It’s a song about a relationship falling apart without having a chance to gain closure due to unfortunate circumstances.”"
