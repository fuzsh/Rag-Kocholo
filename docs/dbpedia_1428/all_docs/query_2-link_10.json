        "text": "The Injuries Resolution Board\n\nThe Injuries Resolution Board, previously known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), is an independent statutory body that deals with personal injury claims. All personal injury claims in Ireland, except for medical negligence claims, must be submitted to the Injuries Resolution Board.\n\nThe Injuries Resolution Board provides an independent assessment of personal injury claims for compensation following road traffic, workplace or public liability accidents.\n\nIf the person you hold responsible for your injury (the respondent) does not want the Injuries Resolution Board to assess your claim for compensation, you can take your claim to court.\n\nMost claims are assessed in 9 months from when the respondent agreed for the claim to be assessed by the Injuries Resolution Board.\n\nHow to apply to the Injuries Resolution Board\n\nYou should notify the person you are claiming against (the respondent) within one month of the accident. If you don’t do this, it could affect your claim for legal costs if the case goes to court.\n\nYou can submit your personal injury compensation claim:\n\nOn the Injuries Resolution Board website using the online application form\n\nBy emailing an application form (pdf) to post@injuries.ie\n\nBy posting an application form to P.O. BOX 8, Clonakilty, Cork, Ireland, P85 YH98\n\nCompleting the application form\n\nYou must complete an Injuries Resolution Board Application Form (pdf) to make a claim by post or email.\n\nFor the Injuries Resolution Board to proceed with your claim, your application must include:\n\nYour full name, date of birth and home address\n\nYour contact number, if you have one (if you do not have one, you can state this on the form)\n\nYour Personal Public Service (PPS) number, or, if you were never issued a PPS number, a copy of a valid ID, such as a driver’s license, passport, national ID card, or other proof of your right to reside in Ireland\n\nWhether you are making a road traffic, workplace or public liability claim\n\nDetails of the accident or incident (the date and time it occurred, and how and where it happened)\n\nA description of your injuries and how they affected you\n\nA medical report completed by your treating doctor\n\nName and address for the respondent\n\nWhether you consent to the claim being dealt with by mediation (employer liability claims only, see ‘Resolving a claim through mediation’ below)\n\nPayment (see ‘Fees for Injuries Resolution Board’ below)\n\nYou should also provide any other documents that support your claim, such as copies of receipts for any losses or expenses you suffered because of the accident.\n\nYou can read the Injuries Resolution Board’s Guidance Notes (pdf) for further information on how to complete the application form. You can also read the Injuries Resolution Board’s Guidance on Medical Reports (pdf).\n\nMaking a claim on behalf of someone else\n\nYou can make a claim on behalf of someone else if they:\n\nAre under 18\n\nAre of unsound mind\n\nWere fatally injured in the accident or incident\n\nYou will need to provide your own details and details of your relationship with the person you are claiming on behalf of.\n\nYou must use a Fatal Accident Application Form (pdf) when claiming for someone who was fatally injured.\n\nDo I need a solicitor to make a claim?\n\nYou don’t need to use a solicitor to make a claim, but you can use one if you want to. You will need to provide their details in the application form.\n\nOffences\n\nIt is an offence to give false information in your application. The Injuries Resolution Board can disclose this information to the Gardaí.\n\nYou can find more information about making a claim on the Injuries Resolution Board’s website.\n\nHow are claims assessed?\n\nWhen assessing claims and the damages which may be due to you, the Injuries Resolution Board considers:\n\nThe medical report from your doctor\n\nA report from an independent doctor appointed by the Injuries Resolution Board, if necessary\n\nThe injuries you sustained and your circumstances\n\nThe Injuries Resolution Board is not required to assess certain claims and, in those cases, it will grant you an authorisation to bring legal proceedings. The Injuries Resolution Board previously did not make assessments in claims for psychological injuries, but it now does.\n\nYou can read the Injuries Resolution Board’s FAQs about making a personal injury claim.\n\nTime limits for making an application\n\nUnder the Civil Liabilities and Courts Act 2004, the time limit for claims for compensation is 2 years from the date of the accident.\n\nIt is very important that you notify the person you hold responsible for your injury (the respondent) within one month of the accident. You should notify them in writing (by registered post) detailing what they have done. This gives the person, company or organisation a chance to investigate your claim.\n\nIf you do not inform the other person, it may affect your case later if you go to court, and you may not be able to recover your costs.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Injuries Resolution Board assessing case\n\nWhen the Injuries Resolution Board receives your claim, it will give you an application number. It will then inform the respondent about your claim. The respondent has 90 days to agree to let the Injuries Resolution Board assess your claim.\n\nIf the respondent agrees to this, they must pay a fee (see ‘Fees for Injuries Resolution Board’ below).\n\nIf the respondent does not agree to this, the Injuries Resolution Board will issue you with an Authorisation. This is a legal document that allows you to take your claim through the courts if you wish.\n\nMotor accident with uninsured or unknown driver\n\nIf your claim is against a driver who was not insured, or who left the scene without giving their details, you should contact the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) before you make your claim to the Injuries Resolution Board.\n\nYou can read more about making a claim and responding to a claim on the Injuries Resolution Board’s website.\n\nResolving a claim through mediation\n\nThe Injuries Resolution Board offers a free mediation service for workplace injury and public liability claims. Mediation services will include road traffic claims later in 2024.\n\nA mediator is an impartial, trained professional who will work with you and the respondent to try find an agreement that both parties accept. Mediation is free of charge and voluntary. You can leave the process at any time.\n\nYou can read more about mediation at the Injuries Resolution Board.\n\nHow to apply for mediation\n\nYou can consent to mediation on the application form. If both you and the respondent consent to mediation, your claim will be assigned to a mediator. This happens at the start of the process.\n\nWhat happens after mediation?\n\nIf you come to an agreement, the mediator will give you and the respondent a written agreement to sign, followed by a 10-day cooling off period. If both parties are still happy after the 10-day period, the Injuries Resolution Board will issue a legally binding Order to Pay (see 'Compensation amounts' below).\n\nIf no agreement is reached, you can have your claim assessed by the Board if the respondent consents. If they don’t consent to the assessment, you can take the case to court (see 'Taking a case to court' below).\n\nConfidentiality of mediation\n\nAll information shared during the mediation process is confidential. This means it cannot be shared during a later assessment or in any court proceedings, even if no agreement is reached.\n\nCompensation amounts\n\nThe guideline amounts for compensation for particular injuries are set out in the Injuries Guidelines (pdf). The Injuries Resolution Board can depart from the Injuries Guidelines but must explain its reasons for doing so.\n\nAccepting or rejecting the compensation award\n\nYou and the respondent will both receive a Notice of Assessment which sets out the compensation the Injuries Resolution Board has assessed for the injury.\n\nClaimant accepts or rejects the award\n\nWhen the Injuries Resolution Board makes its assessment, you have 28 days to decide whether to accept or reject the award.\n\nIf you accept it, you must acknowledge this in writing to the Injuries Resolution Board.\n\nIf you do not reply within 28 days, it is taken that you have rejected the assessment.\n\nRespondent accepts or rejects the assessment\n\nThe respondent has 21 days to accept or reject the assessment.\n\nIf the respondent does not reply within this time limit, it is taken that they have accepted the assessment.\n\nBoth parties accept the assessment\n\nIf both parties accept the assessment, the Injuries Resolution Board will issue an Order to Pay to the respondent. This means that the respondent will pay you the amount awarded to settle the claim.\n\nEither party rejects the assessment\n\nIf either you or the respondent rejects the assessment, the Injuries Resolution Board will issue you with an Authorisation allowing you to take your claim to court.\n\nIf the court awards you a lower amount than the Injuries Resolution Board did, you will generally have to pay the respondent’s legal costs as well as your own (see ‘Taking a case to court’ below).\n\nSocial welfare recovery\n\nUnder the Recovery of Certain Benefits and Assistance Scheme, the Department of Social Protection can recover the value of certain illness-related social welfare payments from compensation awards. The benefits are recovered from the compensator and not from the injured person.\n\nTaking a case to court\n\nYou can take your case to court if:\n\nThe respondent does not agree with the Injuries Resolution Board assessing the claim\n\nThe respondent does not agree with the amount of compensation\n\nYou do not agree with the amount of compensation\n\nThe respondent fails to pay the agreed amount of compensation\n\nThe Injuries Resolution Board gives you an Authorisation to take a case to court. You should get legal advice before taking a case to court.\n\nLegal costs\n\nIn civil cases, the court usually awards costs to the person who wins the case. This means that if your case is successful, the court will order the respondent to pay your legal fees. There are some exceptions to this in personal injuries cases.\n\nEven if you win, you will usually still pay the respondent’s costs if:\n\nYou went to court because you did not agree with the amount of compensation that the Board awarded, and\n\nThe respondent did agree with the amount, and\n\nThe court awards less than that amount\n\nYou may also be ordered to pay costs if you didn’t comply with requests from the Injuries Resolution Board.\n\nFor example, if you did not:\n\nProvide information that the Injuries Resolution Board requested, or\n\nAttend a medical examination arranged by the Board\n\nIf you did not inform the respondent of your intention to take a personal injuries case within one month of the accident, this could also affect your claim for legal costs.\n\nFees for Injuries Resolution Board\n\nFurther information\n\nYou can read more about how to make a claim in the Injuries Resolution Board’s Claimant Guide (pdf).\n\nIf you have any further queries about making a claim to the Injuries Resolution Board or about the application process, contact the Injuries Resolution Board:"
