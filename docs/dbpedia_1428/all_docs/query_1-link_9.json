        "text": "LADY MACBETH\n\nThat which hath made them drunk hath made me bold. What hath quenched them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it. The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nThe wine that made the servants drunk has made me bold. The liquor that put them to sleep has filled me with fire. Listen! Quiet! That was the shriek of an owl—an omen of death like the bell struck at midnight by the night watchman before the cell of a man condemned to death. Macbeth is killing Duncan right now. The doors to Duncan’s chamber are open, and the snores of the drunk servants make a mockery of their job of guarding him. I drugged their drinks to make them sleep so soundly that they seem dead.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nAlack, I am afraid they have awaked, And ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deed Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss ‘em. Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done ’t.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nOh no, I’m afraid the servants woke up, and the job is not done. It would ruin us completely to fail in our attempt to murder the king. [She hears a noise] Listen! I placed the servants’ daggers where Macbeth could not miss seeing them. I would have killed Duncan myself if he didn't look so much like my own father while he slept.\n\nMACBETH\n\nThere’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried. “Murder!” That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them. But they did say their prayers, and addressed them Again to sleep.\n\nMACBETH\n\nOne servant laughed in his sleep, and one cried, “murder!” so that they woke each other up. I stood and listened, but they just said their prayers and fell back asleep.\n\nMACBETH\n\nOne cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands. List’ning their fear I could not say “Amen,” When they did say “God bless us!”\n\nMACBETH\n\nOne servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other said, “Amen,” as if they’d seen me with my blood-stained hands. Though I heard the fear in their voices, I couldn’t respond “Amen” when they said “God bless us!”\n\nMACBETH\n\nI thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more! Macbeth murders sleep.” Innocent sleep. Sleep that smooths away all our fears and worries; that puts an end to each day; that eases the aches of the day’s work; and soothes hurt minds. Sleep, the main and most nourishing course in the feast of life.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nWho was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there. Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nWho was it that cried out these words? Oh, my noble thane, you make yourself weak and unable to act when you think so obsessively about things. Go get some water and wash this filthy evidence from your hands. Why did you bring these daggers from the room? They must remain there. Go return them and smear the sleeping servants with the blood.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nInfirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. ‘Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nYou weakling! Give me the daggers. Dead and sleeping people are as harmless as pictures: it’s childish to fear a scary painting. If Duncan is still bleeding, I’ll cover the faces of the servants with the blood. They must appear to be guilty.\n\nMACBETH\n\nWhence is that knocking? How is ’t with me when every noise appals me? What hands are here? Ha! They pluck out mine eyes. Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red.\n\nMACBETH\n\nWhere is that knocking coming from? What’s wrong with me, that every noise terrifies me? [Looking at his hands] Whose hands are these? Ha! They’re plucking out my eyes. Could even all the water in the ocean wash this blood from my hands? No, my hands would instead stain the seas crimson, turning the green water entirely red.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nHark! More knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.\n\nLADY MACBETH\n\nListen! More knocking. Put on your sleeping robe, so that when we have to appear it won't seem as if we’ve been awake and watching this whole time. Break free of the sad thoughts that hold you down."
