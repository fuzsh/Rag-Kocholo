What Is NetSuite?

NetSuite is a cloud-based, developer-hosted ERP software supporting finance, operations, sales, service, and HR needs. Widely viewed as the first cloud software company, Oracle NetSuite offers robust built-in modules, including inventory control, eCommerce, HR, procurement, project management, and accounting. NetSuite’s tax engine accommodates multiple schedules for local taxes across subsidiaries.

Who Uses NetSuite?

We recommend NetSuite software for medium-sized businesses in the distribution, information technology, and professional services sectors. Based on our internal review activity, the median size of organizations considering NetSuite is 30 employees. Due to its cost and complex feature set, NetSuite might be too expensive and intricate for startups and small businesses.

What Features Are Missing?

Transparent pricing: Companies interested in NetSuite will need to reach out for a pricing consultation. Cost varies depending on user count, support expectations, module selections, implementation needs, and other factors.

Simple implementation: NetSuite often requires the help of an outside consultant for implementation and data migration purposes. However, working with a Value Added Reseller (VAR) allows you to customize the platform to your specifications and receive ample post-implementation support.

NetSuite Pricing

NetSuite does not publish subscription costs on its website. Those interested in the software will need to schedule a consultation for pricing. NetSuite pricing options generally start around $1,000/mo, with additional licensing costs dependent on module selection, support level, and user requirements.

How Do I Get Started?

Because NetSuite implementation is often complex, you typically work with a VAR rather than NetSuite directly to get started. goVirtualOffice is an example of a VAR that helps configure the software correctly the first time around and maximize your investment through its BOOST program.

How Do I Build A Report?

We found building a report in NetSuite to be simple and intuitive. For example, to create a basic income statement, follow these steps:

Click on Reports in the top navigation bar to trigger a dropdown menu.

Select the Financial > option, then Income Statement from the submenu.

Adjust date ranges in the Period fields at the bottom of the screen.

Choose Parent (Consolidated) or a specific selection from the Subsidiary context field.

Click the Column field to break out data by department, location, class, accounting period, etc.

Select the Excel, PDF, etc. icons in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to Export.

Click the Print icon to print.

Select the Email icon to send reports to specific users or automate recurring financial reporting.

NetSuite vs. QuickBooks

QuickBooks Online doesn’t match the breadth of functionality found in NetSuite. Designed for medium to large businesses, NetSuite ERP offers modules for CRM, inventory, e-commerce, accounting, and more. It provides real-time global business management and financial consolidation for multi-national, multi-subsidiary operations.

QuickBooks is better for small to medium businesses. Its features are limited to bookkeeping, payroll, sales invoicing, and expense tracking. While QuickBooks offers some degree of scalability, it doesn’t function like an ERP. You can read a more thorough comparison in our NetSuite vs. QuickBooks Guide.

Which Companies Use NetSuite?

Examples of companies using NetSuite include Crumbl Cookies, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Inc., Land O’Lakes, Quicken, and TechSoup. Over 34,000 customers worldwide use NetSuite ERP. Industry types include healthcare, light manufacturing, professional services, retail, transportation, wholesale distribution, and advertising.

Is NetSuite Worth It For Small Businesses?

NetSuite might not be the best fit for new businesses due to high implementation and maintenance fees. The software’s wide range of features can also overwhelm organizations needing the next step up in accounting and inventory solutions, like Odoo and AccountingSuite.

However, small companies with capital to invest in launching a new ERP system might find it easier to absorb these expenses. In that case, NetSuite is comprehensive, flexible, and scalable, meaning it will grow with your business.

Summary

We recommend using NetSuite if you’re a mid-sized business that has outgrown its basic accounting solution and now needs functionality in inventory control, time tracking, and supply chain management. It’s optimal for distribution and light manufacturing businesses. NetSuite is a popular choice in the professional services market, where distributed workforces benefit from anytime, anywhere access provided by the web-based client software.

However, NetSuite is not a great fit for smaller companies with fewer than 20 employees. It does not have the functionality to handle process manufacturing and will likely require a high degree of customization to be usable.

NetSuite is a strong ERP pick for businesses looking for comprehensive, out-of-the-box functionality that scales with their growth.

Cons

If you have a big product catalog and take phone orders or in store sales, it is a big FAIL. Very few easy ways to look at stuff in a sales order. Each gridded item is an individual which is good for accounting and very bad for looking stuff up. Every other system, you find an item by the matrix parent and then choose your grid item - not netsuite, you have to scroll through all your matrix sub-items to pick what you want -quite cumbersome if you have big grids and a large catalog with similar items. When looking up, you have to know exactly what you are looking for - or use wildcards for any word that might not be in order (so more typing - sounds trivial but when you get a lot of phone and in store pick up orders, it is a nightmare). Otherwise a big "search" screen is used, you fill out multiple fields, click look, then you scroll..... our old system, you just type a few words not necessarily in order and matches came up. You can't search directly by MPN. You can't take a quick look at a grid to check stock - you have to run a report for that. You can't print barcodes directly to printer. You have to download to a file and then send to printer and then the barcodes don't scan because it is lost in translation - have to buy an expensive add-on if you actually want to print a barcode label to an actual barcode printer. You can't split payments on a cash sale. To do on a sales order a very cumbersome "deposit" method. You can't do an exchange - you must do a credit memo, then an invoice, then marry the two - (so MUCH WORK). Barcode scanning only works in a few transaction types - and then not all the time. If you want to use it for inventory adjustments, etc, forget it - unless you pay more.. Looking items up for a sales order takes forever, with popups and clicking and looking... If you get like one phone order an hour and have 10 products, you will be fine..Otherwise, prepare for frustration. Quickbooks is better for syncs to banks and credit card agencies. You can import data, but it is very particular, so you need to get your CSV's then reformat to make netsuite happy - when we were on quickbooks, everything connected on it's own. No great way to reconcile paypal - again it connected in our old system and a daily reconcile was easy - now it has to be done with manual imports and matching. This system was built for service organizations not retail. It's a shame, because I LOVE a lot of things about this software from a high level perspective but for my poor staff trying to do day-to-day activities, it has slowed them down considerably from our old systems (counterpoint sql and quickbooks).
