Only with NetSuite OneWorld can you see business operations consolidated information across all your companies AND the very industry expertise data you are interested in within each.\n\nReal-time Management for Multi-Company Businesses\n\nUnlike other products that only allow you to see consolidation only at the level of general ledgers, NetSuite OneWorld provides complete visibility into all areas of each business processes NetSuite OneWorld supports regions, subsidiaries, and separate legal entities with the same parent company with sophisticated accounting/ERP, sales, marketing, support and eCommerce in real time.

From concerns about cost and demonstrating ROI, to practical considerations about who will manage the process at your company, ERP implementation efforts require commitment by a project team and support by business leaders to ensure success.\n\nThere’s no getting around the fact that ERP deployment is a major undertaking, but the process doesn’t have to be painful. With proper planning and execution, implementing an ERP system should be a smooth process and quickly improve efficiency across your business."
