        "text": "If you’re weighing up which CRM solution would be the best fit for managing your customer relationships, you’ve come to the right place! In this article, we break down the pros and cons of Oracle’s NetSuite CRM vs. Salesforce, the current CRM market leader. We’ll also look at how monday sales CRM differs from both options, and help you pick the best solution for your team.\n\nTry monday sales CRM\n\nWhat is NetSuite CRM?\n\nNetSuite CRM is a customer relationship management software created by Oracle; this cloud-based CRM solution that offers a real-time view across the entire customer lifecycle. It helps users manage their prospects and customers from the first point of contact, through conversion, fulfillment, renewal, upgrades and support.\n\nWhat is Salesforce?\n\nSalesforce offers multiple software products and services, including Salesforce CRM, a cloud-based software solution that helps businesses manage customer interactions and data.\n\nSalesforce CRM offers a wide range of features including sales forecasting, lead management, opportunity tracking, and customer service management. The software is highly customizable and can be tailored to fit the specific needs of different businesses.\n\nSalesforce remains the CRM market leader, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), with 22% market share in 2022.\n\nNetSuite CRM vs Salesforce–what’s the difference?\n\nBoth NetSuite CRM and Salesforce are customer relationship management solutions. CRM platforms help you store and organize your lead and customer data in a centralized location.\n\nThe big difference is that NetSuite is an ERP which includes a CRM, whereas Salesforce is primarily a CRM system. Both are highly customizable, reputable cloud-based software solutions with a wide range of integration options. Salesforce is more popular, more specialized and more expensive. NetSuite is more comprehensive, stronger on integrating accounting and finance, and possibly a better option for small to mid-sized businesses.\n\nTarget users\n\nNetSuite CRM is part of a full enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution offered by Oracle. Its main users are mid-sized businesses in the US, primarily in the IT and computer software industry. So, if that describes your business, this could be a good fit for you!\n\nSalesforce also has its main customer base in the US, although like NetSuite it is in global use. As of 2022, most Salesforce clients come from the professional services industry (29%), which includes businesses like law firms, accountants, and advertising agencies. It has a significantly larger market share than NetSuite CRM. While businesses of any size can use Salesforce, their price structure may make it too expensive for smaller companies.\n\nFunctionality\n\nNetSuite CRM isn’t really a standalone option–you’d be more likely to use it as part of their ERP platform. If you want an end-to-end business solution, offering everything from accounting to human resources management alongside a CRM solution, then this could be a good option for you.\n\nSalesforce is a best-in-breed CRM, but it doesn’t let you manage the rest of your business. However, if you just need a specialist sales and CRM tool, then Salesforce should certainly be on your short-list.\n\nHow does monday sales CRM compare?\n\nmonday sales CRM has been built to suit everything from solopreneurs to enterprise customers. It’s easy to customize to fit your sales cycle (without calling in the developers!) And it gives you the best of both worlds: you can integrate it into the full monday.com Work OS if you’d like all of your info in one platform, or integrate it with your existing set-up if you prefer.\n\nTry monday sales CRM\n\nNetSuite CRM vs Salesforce–what features do they include?\n\nBoth NetSuite CRM and Salesforce offer a wide range of features for managing customer relationships, sales, and marketing processes. Here’s a comparison of some of their key features:\n\nAnalytics\n\nNetSuite CRM and Salesforce both have built-in sales analytics and reporting capabilities, allowing businesses to track sales performance, campaign ROI, customer behavior, and more.\n\nSalesforce also offers AI-driven analytics insights, which NetSuite is still working on.\n\nCustomization\n\nNetSuite CRM and Salesforce are highly customizable, allowing businesses to tailor the software to their specific needs and workflows.\n\nOverall, Salesforce may be stronger in this area, with a reputation for easy adaptability and personalization.\n\nIntegrations\n\nNetSuite CRM integrates seamlessly with the rest of the suite of products included in its ERP offering. This means that if you use the NetSuite ERP solution, you can keep all your business data (from HR to finance) in the same place. You can also integrate with several on-premise or cloud-based applications, via the SuiteCloud technology platform. However, it doesn’t integrate natively with many commonly used tools (like Skype, Facebook, Twitter, or Office 365).\n\nSalesforce has a reputation for more flexible integrations, because it offers virtual integration technology. You can hook it up to your ERP software, e-commerce platform, accounting software and so on, through AppExchange, a marketplace that includes thousands of third-party integrations.\n\nMarketing\n\nBoth NetSuite CRM and Salesforce include marketing tools for creating and executing campaigns, tracking interactions, and analyzing performance.\n\nNetSuite CRM includes marketing automation as standard, while in Salesforce you’ll need the Sales Engage add-on.\n\nWe should probably mention here that monday sales CRM incorporates all these features and more, including:\n\nCustomizable sales pipelines\n\nLead management tools, including lead capture forms, lead scoring, and lead segmentation\n\nEasy-to-visualize deal tracking\n\nCollaboration tools, including the ability to share files, comment on tasks, and tag team members\n\nIntegration with popular marketing automation tools like Mailchimp, Hubspot, and Marketo\n\nNetSuite CRM vs Salesforce–how much do they cost?\n\nNetSuite Pricing\n\nNetSuite is extremely discreet about its pricing! To get a quote, you’ll need to contact them (or a NetSuite reseller) directly. To give you an idea, the base license for the NetSuite ERP suite is $999 per month, according to the software review site Better Buys. Each user then costs an additional $99 per month.\n\nHere’s how NetSuite’s pricing works:\n\nYou sign up for an annual license fee for the entire NetSuite platform.\n\nThe price will vary depending on the number of optional modules you include in your package, and the number of users you need. NetSuite CRM is included with the NetSuite platform.\n\nPricing is per user–so every employee who needs to access NetSuite CRM will need their own user license.\n\nYou can activate new modules or add new users as your business grows.\n\nSalesforce Pricing\n\nSalesforce has a number of different price points, depending on how many users you have and the modules you purchase (sales, customer support, or marketing). It also offers a free trial. After your trial finishes, you’ll purchase an annual contract.\n\nTo give you an idea of their price ranges, here are a few of the products available (all prices are billed annually):\n\nSalesforce Essentials gives you the sales and customer support modules for up to 10 users and costs $25 per user per month\n\nSales Professional gives you the CRM module for any size of the team for $75/user/month.\n\nEnterprise is a more customizable sales CRM, at $150/user/month\n\nUnlimited is a CRM option for high-growth businesses, priced at $300/user/month\n\nmonday sales CRM pricing\n\nmonday sales CRM comes with all of the same features (and more) at a more affordable price.\n\nThe Basic account is suitable for teams of 3 or more. It includes unlimited pipelines, contacts and boards, as well as templates, mobile app and a built-in dashboard, at $12 per user/month.\n\nOur most popular account type, the Standard CRM, costs $17 per user/month, and also comes with email integration, duplicate data merging, and custom automations and integrations.\n\nIf you need a more advanced solution, the Pro CRM costs $28 per user/month, and includes sales forecasting, email automation, and sales analytics capacity.\n\nFinally, our Enterprise CRM account also adds in lead scoring, multi-level permissions, and enterprise level governance (including HIPAA compliance).\n\nMore details on monday sales CRM pricing here\n\nNetSuite CRM vs Salesforce–what do customers say?\n\nThe full NetSuite ecosystem gets 4 out of 5 stars on G2.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nUsers describe it as a “flexible ERP for mid-size businesses.” They like its “flexibility to customize into a bespoke powerhouse system.” Specific features that get a mention include text messaging for customers through the sales order screen, and unified customer records.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nOverall, the CRM functionality of NetSuite is mentioned far less often than its use as an accounting and reporting tool. In terms of the NetSuite ecosystem in general, users say that “it’s a pretty difficult learning curve,” “creating custom reports is cumbersome and not at all intuitive,” and that “there is also A LOT to learn, and it can be a little overwhelming.”\n\nSalesforce Sales Cloud gets a 4.3 out of 5 on G2, from over 16,000 reviewers.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nUsers say it’s “very helpful for pipeline management, managing daily tasks and follow-up items, and various reporting needs.” They like the “customizable dashboards,” “the number of tools that integrate”, and the way it makes it easy to “get consolidated information across teams.”\n\nThe Cons:\n\nUsers tend to dislike the pricing structure. They also say that Salesforce can be “technically challenging,” “too hard to use”, and “complex to understand.”\n\nmonday Sales CRM reviews\n\nThe monday Sales CRM gets a whopping 4.7 out of 5 on G2 from over 525 reviewers (excuse us while we burst with pride!)\n\nThe Pros:\n\nReviewers say that our Sales CRM is “a super easy and user friendly platform.” They mention our customizable templates, our at-a-glance dashboards, and the way we “make it easy to track your prospects in every step of the sales cycle from lead to conversion.”\n\nThe Cons:\n\nHey, nobody’s perfect, right? Reviewers on G2 say they’d like “more videos on different use cases to give business owners and managers an idea of how to make Monday work for them.” We’re on it!\n\nTry monday sales CRM\n\nNetSuite CRM vs Salesforce–how does monday.com compare?\n\nYou knew where we were going with this, right? Both Salesforce and NetSuite have a lot to offer to growing businesses. However, they both have a reputation for being complex, hard to learn, and overwhelming for the end user.

Is NetSuite a CRM or an ERP?\n\nNetSuite is a suite of enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools, which includes NetSuite CRM. ERPs are platforms that companies use to manage and integrate all the information involved in running the business, such as:\n\nHuman resources data\n\nCustomer data\n\nFinancial data\n\nReporting\n\nDistribution and logistics\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) software is a tool that focuses only on the information that relates to leads, prospects and customers (such as contact details, records of communications, and order details, for instance.) So NetSuite CRM is a component of a larger platform called NetSuite, which is owned and managed by Oracle.\n\n2. Is Salesforce a CRM or an ERP?\n\nSalesforce is not an ERP. It’s a CRM software, although it does have some functions that are designed to complement an ERP, like pricing, quoting, and billing. An ERP system enables businesses to integrate their financial and operational processes into a centralized database, whereas a CRM system focuses on managing customer interactions and relationships. You can integrate Saleforce into your ERP platform to manage your whole business.\n\n3. NetSuite CRM vs Salesforce–which one is better?\n\nAs with so much in this life: it depends! If you’re looking for an end-to-end business platform, with an integrated CRM system, then NetSuite could be a good option for you. Its strengths include its comprehensive overview of all the aspects that make up your business and its high level of customizability.\n\nIf you just need a great CRM, then Salesforce might be the better option. It’s the market leader for a reason – it’s easy to integrate with your existing set-up, feature-rich, and has top-of-the-range AI capabilities, making it a great sales partner for your Revenue team. However, users do complain that it can be a bit complex and pricey, especially for smaller companies.\n\nAnd don’t forget about the latest offering from monday, the monday sales CRM. It’s quick to set up, easy to use, and offers seamless integration into the most popular sales and marketing platforms.\n\nIf you’re looking to upgrade your CRM, look no further\n\nNetSuite CRM and Salesforce are both great software options. If you’re looking for an end-to-end business platform, with an integrated CRM system, then NetSuite could be a good option for you—but it does have a reputation for having a steep learning curve. Plus, if you already have an ERP, and you just want a CRM, then this wouldn’t be an option for you.\n\nIf that’s the case, then Salesforce might be the right fit. It’s the market leader for a reason – it’s easy to integrate with your existing set-up and has a wide range of features including AI-powered analytics. However, some people say it’s a bit complex and pricey, especially for smaller companies.\n\nIf you’re looking for a CRM that’s flexible, easy to use, and great for teams, then you might want to check out monday sales CRM. We offer top-of-the-line customer support that makes it effortless to get started, an incredibly intuitive interface, and an extremely flexible, visual dashboard to give you an overview of your whole sales pipeline.\n\nIf you’re interested to learn more, why not give it a try?"
