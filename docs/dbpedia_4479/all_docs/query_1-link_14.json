        "text": "Software has become an integral part of a person’s life. From the operating system used on a phone or computer to the basic functions of the appliances that make up their smart home, they all run on software. With computers and computer-assisted devices proliferating in the past few decades, it’s easy to overlook how software has impacted our daily lives. Regardless if one’s been observant of how much we rely on technology nowadays, it’s a fact that software has vastly improved the quality of our lives nowadays. For that, we have software companies to thank for.\n\nCreating and producing software isn’t easy though. It isn’t as easy or as instant as the final output or functions these software are actually produced for. They take time, effort, and resources. While these things can be managed manually, ERPs like NetSuite greatly streamline processes and, in doing so, actually reduce the workload on personnel who can otherwise be assigned for more important tasks. So, whether you’re reading this because you’re a start-up software company, a progressive enterprise decisionmaker who’s thinking of ways to improve efficiency, or you’re just curious, you’ll probably get insights here on what NetSuite can do for software companies.\n\nWhy NetSuite though? Surely a software company can whizz up their own management systems that can manage their data, resources, and other processes all together, right? While this may be true for some, this also eats up a lot of time, energy, and resources that should be allotted somewhere more useful.\n\nAs with any business, software companies can’t afford to be bogged down by buggy and complicated business systems. Sometimes, in an effort to save money, companies will opt to invest on smaller, singular, applications that are used for specific needs instead of getting an entire suite. While that’s actually alright, in fact, you can argue that it’s a smart decision, more often than not, the business is hampered or bottlenecked by the limitedness brought on by these one-track programs. Besides that, while they’re stacking on more independent programs or systems on top of each other, they’ve become the very thing they were trying to avoid… a steaming hot mess of spreadsheets. Only this time, instead of spreadsheets, they’re the systems that were implemented to uncomplicate things in the first place!\n\nNetSuite avoids that problem by centralizing all these systems into one suite. NetSuite’s cloud business management solutions give software companies the foundation they need to simplify important business operations, save time, money, and reduce problems. Imagine dealing with only one version of your data throughout your organization, avoiding the inaccuracy and confusion that’s brought on by multiple solutions being set in place. Being dynamic and progressive, NetSuite gives software companies realtime data insights that allow them to make important adjustments and changes on the fly. So, in a sense, NetSuite is a software that makes software companies make software easier. :Wink wink: To give you a more in-depth rundown of what NetSuite can do for your software company, what NetSuite primarily does is automate and simplify your business for efficiency. It does that by eliminating error-prone spreadsheets by centralizing all data onto the cloud. Since it’s on the cloud, it goes without saying that you can access all this data whenever and wherever you are. It also reduces manual reconciliations since it’s already automated. Financial close processes are also expedited and order processing is optimized. The fact that NetSuite is cloud-based and centralizes all your existing solutions means the needed IT support and resource costs are significantly reduced. Ergo, all your professional service productivity is drastically improved. Some of the features that NetSuite has that will help your software company avoid complexity and boost your growth are its order management, streamlined billing, revenue recognition, optimization of recurring revenue, sales force integration, professional services automation, and unique customization.\n\nHave we mentioned that NetSuite basically dominates the Tech IPO Market? Sixty-three percent (63%) of technology IPOs are NetSuite customers since 2011.\n\nHonestly, though, that isn’t a flex! It’s just a fact that six out of the top seven best performing tech stocks of 2019 are NetSuite customers. Sixty-three percent (63%) of technology IPOs are NetSuite customers since 2011. Now, you might be feeling overwhelmed. You might be thinking… “We’re just a small startup! NetSuite’s too expansive for us at this point!” Or, it might be the other way around. Questions like, “Isn’t NetSuite for smaller companies and startups?” start floating around.\n\nRelax. One of the best features NetSuite has is its scalability. Software companies of all sizes, whether a startup or an enterprise, can greatly benefit from the improved visibility and efficiency brought on by NetSuite. NetSuite provides these advantages through its complete, worldwide finance and accounting core. NetSuite operates by the mantra, “Scale. Streamline. Modernize.” As your business grows and develops into something more, NetSuite appropriately scales along, eliminating costly and inefficient manual processes and disparate systems.\n\nNetSuite’s award-winning solutions assist startups, midsize, and enterprise software companies alike. Today, over 33,000 businesses rely on NetSuite to provide the framework for their business processes. Besides scale, NetSuite prioritizes streamlining. As mentioned above, NetSuite automates and unites your key business processes for increased financial efficiency and accuracy.\n\nLastly, modernize. As a tech company, NetSuite’s naturally inclined to go for progress and betterment. While some similar software may look better on paper, it hampers itself with clunky and outdated UI and accessibility. In contrast, NetSuite promises easy-to-use and accessible programs. With this commitment to modernization, NetSuite hopes to aide you in fostering innovation within your organization.\n\nAs previously stated, NetSuite caters to a lot of tech companies, not necessarily all dealing with software. However, the average KPI improvements in these select software companies are IT cost savings, reduction in time to close, and an increase in employee productivity. Phew, talk about giving the hard sell, right? We sincerely hope we didn’t turn you away from the wall of words that we just dropped on you. While this may already be a lengthy read, it’s a necessary one since this is the future of your company we’re talking about after all. We believe it’s also in your best interest to really go on an in-depth review of all ERPs you’re considering. While you’re at it, you should also consider the solutions partner who’ll be providing you the ERP itself. Try to find out what kind of packages they offer and what the inclusions will be. Compare them with other companies that also offer NetSuite or other ERPs.\n\nSince we’ve brought it up, we’d like to ask you to consider *us*, Salora ERP, as your solutions partner! We hope you don’t feel like we’re being too pushy about the subject. But if you’re sincerely considering NetSuite, we just wanna let you know we’re experts on NetSuite. Our clients include\n\nGoDaddy, GoPro, Glassdoor, ZenDesk and more. Besides knowing all there is to know about NetSuite and all its enterprise solutions, we offer unparalleled service.\n\nAs a full-service Solution Provider, our team of specialists can choose the best NetSuite package for your business and get you up and operating faster than our competition. While we may be boutique size, that means we provide hands-on service that allows us to tailor fit the solutions to your specific needs.\n\nBut, again, we really recommend that you review the ERP and solutions partner that you feel is the best for you.\n\nAfter all, a software company can’t afford to have bad software."
