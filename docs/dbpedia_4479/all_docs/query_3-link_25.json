        "text": "First things first, there is no real substitute for actual experience, therefore, choosing an ERP partner that doesn’t just understand how to work and navigate the software, but how to use it for your specific industry translates to more effective use of ERP software. Plus, a partner with experience will be able to have the foresight to incorporate expected changes going forward. Aarialife makes the ERP software work hard for you and not the other way round.\n\nYour growth as a brand and business should be at the heart of your partner’s deployment strategy. From suggesting relevant additional modules, third party products, or training on existing solutions that result in long-term gains is critical. Ultimately, when you are satisfied with the performance only then will a business find it worthy to renew their subscription. The holy trinity of cloud, mobility and dashboards keeps operational costs under control as your business moves forward in a transparent fashion. Naturally, advice that ensures growth and alleviates problems are critical to building trust, both of which are paramount for us. When you grow, we grow as a by-product.\n\nAs a partner we are in a unique position to breakdown ERP features and functionality at your disposal. According to a study conducted by Accenture a few years ago, where they interviewed over 300 CTO’s about their ERP systems, it was found that organizations used only 64% of their ERP functions. Under-utilized ERP functions will never be a problem with Aarialife as your preferred partner, as we understand the software solution inside-out. This very attention to detail means we will direct you to ‘best of breed’ SaaS applications you would need to support your growth. Moreover, we will ensure you take out the time to train on essential features by communicating the urgency, instead of under-utilising the software capabilities\n\nWhen you go live with changes implemented through the software, it’s not only in your best interest to do it quickly and effectively, but in your partner’s interest as well. We have the ability to get you off the ground remotely, while navigating through all the kinks, troubleshooting any pain points along the way. The testimonials and our ever-growing client list are testimonies to the difference we make and the diversity of our portfolio"
