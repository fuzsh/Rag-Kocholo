        "text": "Built For\n\n“Is NetSuite like QuickBooks?” is a question typically asked by businesses that have outgrown QuickBooks but are far from needing NetSuite or its expensive price tag.\n\nIs NetSuite like QuickBooks?\n\nMost companies start out managing their business with QuickBooks. At some point, they discover they need more inventory, order, and business management capabilities than QuickBooks offers, and they begin searching for software to handle those needs.\n\nEarly into the software exploration process, they will most likely encounter ads from NetSuite and ask the question, “Is NetSuite like QuickBooks?” NetSuite and QuickBooks are business software solutions designed to help businesses manage their finances and operations, but they differ significantly in their target markets, features, and pricing.\n\nQuickBooks\n\nTypical size of business user:\n\nSmall to medium\n\nCost:\n\nAffordable\n\nEase of use:\n\nEasy\n\nFeatures SUmmary:\n\nFinancial management, payroll, and invoice payments\n\nIs there something in between QuickBooks & NetSuite? Yes\n\nNetSuite\n\nTypical size of business user:\n\nLarge\n\nCost:\n\nExpensive\n\nEase of use:\n\nComplex\n\nFeatures SUmmary:\n\nFinancial, purchasing, inventory, order, and business management\n\nIs Netsuite like QuickBooks? No\n\nQuickBooks was primarily designed for small and medium-sized businesses, while NetSuite is geared more towards large-sized enterprises. QuickBooks is generally easier to use and less expensive than NetSuite and offers features such as invoicing, expense tracking, and basic financial reporting. On the other hand, NetSuite offers financial management capabilities, enterprise resource planning (ERP), inventory management, and supply chain management.\n\nSo, the answer to the question, “Is NetSuite like QuickBooks?” is no. Discovering the differences leaves many growing small to medium-sized businesses asking the next question, “Is there something in between NetSuite and QuickBooks? That answer is Yes.\n\nWhen the question “Is NetSuite like QuickBooks?” really means “Can I get the features my business needs without leaving QuickBooks?\n\nAs businesses grow, their operational needs become more complex, and they may find that QuickBooks no longer offers the required features and functionality. Additionally, QuickBooks may need help keeping up with the needs of the growing business in terms of handling larger transaction volumes, managing multiple entities, and providing advanced inventory and order processing capabilities. However, most companies do not want to leave QuickBooks to manage their financials.\n\nThe solution is a software system with advanced capabilities and features that seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks, like Acctivate.\n\n“I’ve used Fishbowl and NetSuite, and they were very cumbersome. Whereas I found when I had the presentation on Acctivate, it seemed less of a learning and setup curve. Even though there was a good amount of setup, it was not as complex as those two competitors.”\n\nBruce Werber, COO\n\nThrivell\n\nSo, is NetSuite like QuickBooks? No. But is NetSuite like Acctivate?\n\nBuilt for QuickBooks, Acctivate is inventory management and order fulfillment software designed primarily for small and mid-sized businesses. Acctivate focuses on streamlining inventory control, order processing, purchasing, and warehouse management.\n\nA key difference between Acctivate and NetSuite is that Acctivate seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks to provide enhanced business and operational capabilities without requiring businesses to leave QuickBooks.
