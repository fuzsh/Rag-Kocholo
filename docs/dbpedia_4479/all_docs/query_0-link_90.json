MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 2 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com Scope and methodology This report examines the current market for B2B marketing automation platforms, and the considerations involved in implementing marketing automation software. It addresses the following questions: • What factors are driving B2B marketing automation platform use? • What capabilities do B2B marketing automation platforms provide? • Does my company need a marketing automation platform? • Who are the leading players in B2B marketing automation? • How do I evaluate which platform is best for my business? If you are considering licensing a B2B marketing automation platform, this report will help you decide whether or not you need to. The report has been completely updated from its March 2018 publication to include the latest industry statistics, developing market trends and new vendor profiles and product updates. For the purposes of this report, B2B marketing automation is defined as follows: The use of software and web-based services to execute, manage and automate repetitive marketing tasks and processes to more effectively market through multiple channels (i.e., email, mobile, social media, and websites). Marketing automation focuses on the definition, scheduling, segmentation and tracking of marketing campaigns, allowing the marketing and sales organizations to nurture leads with highly personalized content aimed at attracting and retaining customers. The 14 vendors profiled in this report represent some of the choices available for B2B marketing automation platforms; they are not a comprehensive list of B2B marketing automation vendors. This report is not a recommendation of any marketing automation platform or company and is not meant to be an endorsement of any particular product, service or vendor. This report was prepared by conducting in-depth interviews with leading vendors and industry experts in January and February 2019. These, in addition to third-party research, form the basis for this report.

Overall marketing budgets have remained flat year on year at 11.2% of company revenue, as CMOs and CMTOs (Chief Marketing Technology Officers) continue to focus on ROI and efficiency. However, the proportion of marketing dollars going to marketing technology is on the rise. Martech spending grew from 22% of overall marketing budgets in 2017 to 29% in 2018, according to Gartner’s CMO Spend Survey 2018-19 (see Table 1). Optimism is high and 63% of North America and UK-based CMOs expect their budgets to increase in 2019, despite economic uncertainty surrounding potential trade conflicts and the UK’s imminent exit from the European Union.

MA platforms prioritize user experience Marketing automation platforms form the backbone of marketing operations, increasingly serving as sophisticated marketing orchestration platforms. A range of platforms is available to marketers depending on their firm’s size, budget and level of digital marketing sophistication. The more basic functions of marketing automation have become somewhat commoditized, so platform vendors mostly look to differentiate their platforms based on the ability to scale, as well as usability, ease of implementation and customer experience. Platform vendors are also looking to differentiate themselves by offering more support for increasingly sophisticated customers who have adopted the software and who are looking to justify the investment by proving ROI. Vendors continue to expand training programs, as well as add-on professional services available to customers, to improve platform use. Online communities – for both customers and developers – have also become increasingly important to strengthen platform support, advocacy and market penetration. Many marketing automation platform vendors have roots in email marketing, which continues to be a core function – and often the only function that customers use. However, the platforms offer an evolving range of features, including advanced lead management, account-based marketing (ABM) tools, predictive analytics and open architectures to support the growing martech ecosystem. Marketing automation platforms form the backbone of marketing operations, increasingly serving as sophisticated marketing orchestration platforms.\n\n8. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 5 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Marketing automation platform users have become more tech savvy, as marketing skill sets have evolved significantly in recent years. As marketing becomes ever more tech and data centric, this has led to the rise in prevalence of the Marketing Operations specialist, combining business operations and IT skills to clean, harness and democratize data. IBM predicts 2019 will see many brands creating new dedicated marketing roles, such as director of marketing data, data integration and marketing data architect. The important role of third-party integrations ABM is increasingly replacing persona-based marketing, leading the way for greater demand of ABM capabilities among marketing technology platforms, and driving a convergence of marketing and sales. Sales and customer service professionals frequently use marketing automation platforms to better understand how customers are reacting to products and service. Most marketing automation platforms now have native integrations with CRM platforms, which is essential for ABM, as these three departments (sales, marketing, customer service) work together more to look at the entire customer experience. At the same time, with marketing automation platforms in general prioritizing user experience and scalability, there has been less of a focus on building out new technology than previously predicted. For example, personalization is one of the biggest trends driving marketing today. But while some marketing automation platforms do provide personalization capabilities, this is not an essential feature, and can be achieved using point solutions. B2B marketers should therefore not necessarily be put off if a marketing automation platform does not provide personalization as part of the platform. Similarly, despite a lot of hype over the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have not (yet) emerged as a significant trend in the B2B marketing automation space, although some platforms do include it. Many marketing automation vendors offer “app marketplaces” that provide information and support for integrating with third-party software partners. Will CDPs threaten marketing automation platforms? Driven by the need to offer highly personalized customer experiences, and to handle vast amounts of customer data that traditional CRM and marketing automation tools cannot, some marketers are turning to customer data platforms (CDPs), which enable marketers to capture, retain and analyze more granular data and create unified, shareable customer profiles. CDP platforms are able to provide attribution, audience selection and real-time response capabilities, and some provide advanced analytics and the ability to expose individual customer profiles in real time for review by customer service and sales agents. The CDP market is still in its infancy, but CDP platforms are being rapidly adopted and could eventually pose a threat to marketing automation platforms as they provide some of the same tools and functionalities. CDP providers in many cases are newer firms and it is difficult for marketers to know at this stage which providers to trust and which will survive in the long term. ABM is increasingly replacing persona- based marketing, leading the way for greater demand of ABM capabilities among marketing technology platforms, and driving a convergence of marketing and sales.\n\n9.

In 2018, there were a number of acquisitions by Adobe and Salesforce in particular as they sought to consolidate their positions at the top of the market and broaden their offerings for B2B firms. Adobe’s biggest deal of 2018 was its purchase of rival marketing automation platform Marketo in September for $4.75 billion; the firm also bought Magneto Commerce for $1.68 billion in May. Meanwhile Salesforce acquired integration platform Mulesoft in May for $6.5 billion, analytics provider Datorama in July for $800 million, as well as interactive email outfit Rebel in October and CloudCraze in May for undisclosed sums (see sidebar). There was less deal-making activity among vendors serving the small and mid- sized business (SMB) market in 2018, although Infusionsoft, which targets small and rapidly growing firms, raised $20 million in Series E funding in October before undergoing a rebrand (to Keap) in January 2019 and launching a new CRM tool. In January 2019, Cision sold iContact to j2Global for $49 million. Mailchimp bought graphic design startup Sawa in February for an undisclosed sum to enable users to more easily create on-brand campaign graphics.

The platforms also typically provide centralized marketing databases and a basic level of reporting on web traffic, visitor behavior and campaign results. Combined, the core features offered by most B2B marketing automation platforms profiled in this report include: • Email marketing and landing page development; • Lead management (i.e., capture, scoring and nurturing); • Native CRM integration; and • APIs or app marketplaces for faster martech system access. The market is quickly evolving, as B2B marketers demand integrated marketing functionality that rapidly translates into bottom-line return. Vendors continue to add more advanced features to provide marketing end-users with the ability to build, track and manage campaigns across channels and/or devices, and monitor the flow of leads as they move from marketing to sales. These features include, but are not limited to: • Dynamic content generation (email, landing pages and/or website); • Account-based marketing (ABM); • Mobile marketing; • AI-based predictive analytics; and • Social/lead profile integration. The following section discusses several of these core and advanced marketing automation capabilities in more depth (see Table 3). Dynamic content creation Virtually all marketing automation platforms provide the ability to create, send and measure personalized email campaigns. Where they differ is in how email, landing page and website content is created and personalized. Some vendors offer wizard-based campaign design or content templates, while others provide a more customized approach. There are also differences in static vs. dynamically generated content, which adjusts on the fly as prospects interact with a website or form. Progressive profiling is often offered to pre-populate forms with known data and use a drip approach to capture additional prospect information each time they interact with campaigns. Message deliverability is also an important factor to consider. Some B2B marketing automation vendors offer dedicated IP addresses to improve deliverability, and/or monitor deliverability by including ReturnPath or other email deliverability services. Email previewing is an advanced function but may be critical to marketers that want to reach their audience through mobile devices and see what their message will look like on smaller screens. The market is quickly evolving, as B2B marketers demand integrated marketing functionality that rapidly translates into bottom-line return.\n\n12. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 8 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Lead management Lead management comprises three functions: lead capture, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Leads are captured from a variety of sources that feed the marketing automation database, including (but not limited to) website visitors, social media, paid digital campaigns, email marketing respondents, trade show attendees and purchased third-party lists. Platforms will vary based on the ease with which additional lead sources can be captured, such as through an open API, or whether the platform offers landing page optimization. Lead scoring assigns a value to each lead based on a predetermined set of rules or criteria. Traditional lead scoring models are generally based on two sets of data values: behavior (i.e., site purchases, browsing, social posts) and demographics/firmographics. Many B2B marketing automation platforms now offer predictive scoring, which can incorporate hundreds of data points by sourcing websites, social networks and internal systems such as the CRM and marketing database itself to calculate scores. Lead nurturing is the process of keeping prospects engaged with the brand through periodic, personalized communications or campaigns until they are ready to buy. Marketing automation platforms may offer a number of pre-built nurturing steps or actions, as well as allow users to customize their content and process. These efforts are meant to build a relationship between the brand and its prospects, and drive interaction with sales if and when the prospect is ready. Predictive analytics Virtually all of the B2B marketing automation platforms profiled in this report provide a standard set of analytics that track quantifiable data such as website visitor activity, pages viewed, time spent on site, emails opened, content downloaded and campaign responses. More vendors are offering predictive analytics and models based on machine learning, which uses algorithms to process data and surface trends or insights that enable marketers to customize visitor experiences and marketing campaigns. Several platforms have invested in artificial intelligence (AI) to go a step beyond machine learning and use technology to “mimic” human intelligence and recommend marketing actions or outcomes. These may include highly personalized website content or product recommendations based on analysis of consumption trends, on-site behavior, firmographics and CRM data. Other vendors rely on plug-and-play integration with predictive analytics tools to offer greater analytics and personalization capabilities. Mobile marketing Creating an engaging experience for mobile prospects and customers is a must-have capability. As a result, many B2B marketing automation platforms include responsive templates for email, landing pages and web forms. Several vendors integrate with email testing tools such as Litmus, to allow users to preview email marketing messages across email clients and devices. More advanced mobile marketing features include SMS/texting, in-app marketing and remote platform management from mobile devices. In-app marketing features can include “push” notifications or ads based on geography (i.e., geo-fencing or beaconing) or during events. B2B marketing automation vendors have also expanded platform access to mobile users, moving beyond automated alerts and remote data collection to full platform management. Virtually all of the B2B marketing automation platforms profiled in this report provide a standard set of analytics that track quantifiable data such as website visitor activity, pages viewed, time spent on site, emails opened, content downloaded and campaign responses.\n\n13. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 9 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Account-based marketing (ABM) Aligning marketing initiatives with sales teams has become a leading ABM priority for marketers. The goal is to target marketing programs to prospect or customer buying teams, rather than individuals who may have moved into new positions or firms. Many times, a B2B buyer is not a single person. The larger the purchase, the more people and departments are involved. B2B marketing automation vendors continue to add new ABM features to their platforms to enable this strategy, including enhanced account nurturing and predictive scoring capabilities. Social/lead profile integration Most of the B2B marketing automation vendors profiled in this report provide some level of social media publishing, sharing and tracking within the platform for networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. Some platforms provide more advanced social media tools to monitor social posts and add social behavior to lead profiles, often using social engagement as a scoring factor. Other platforms enable the use of social media sign-on to capture social profile data and build lead profiles. Native CRM integration With more businesses seeking to align marketing with sales, native or out-of-the-box integration with CRM systems has become a critical feature for B2B marketing automation platforms. Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Oracle NetSuite and Sugar CRM are some of the most commonly available connectors. Data is synchronized between the two systems and shared in both directions at frequent intervals. For example, data that is added by a sales rep to an account record in the CRM will be automatically added to the record in the marketing automation platform for marketing end-users to view and act upon, as well. Third-party software connectivity B2B marketing automation vendors continue to open their platform architectures through APIs and app marketplaces to offer customers access to an expansive array of third-party martech software systems. The app marketplaces provide faster “plug-and-play” access between the systems, although there may be additional fees to purchase the marketplace apps. If a preferred martech app is not available on a marketing automation vendor’s marketplace it doesn’t mean that the two systems won’t connect – it means that some customization will be required. API use does incur additional charges, generally on a per-call basis for each data download. Most of the B2B marketing automation vendors profiled in this report provide some level of social media publishing, sharing and tracking within the platform for networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n14. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 10 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Platform Dynamic content creation Lead management Predictive Analytics (AI/ML) Mobile marketing ABM Social integrated w/ lead profiles Native CRM integration Third-party software connectivity SMS/ Push In-app notifications Remote platform access API App marketplace Act-On Email/landing pages 4 4 8 8 4 4 4 IN, MS, ONS, SF, SU, 4 4 Autopilot Email 4 4 4 4 8 8 4 PD, SF 4 4 Higher Logic Email/Landing pages 4 4 8 4 4 8 4 MS, SF, SU 4 8 HubSpot Email /landing pages/site personalization 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 HUB, SF 4 4 IBM Watson Marketing Email /landing pages/site personalization 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 MD, NS, SF, SU 4 4 iContact Pro Email/landing pages 4 4 8 4 4 4 4 SF 4 4 Infusionsoft (by Keap) Email/landing pages 4 4 8 8 8 4 8 Built-in CRM 4 4 MailChimp Email 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 BA, PD, SF, SU, TG, VT 4 4 Marketo Email/landing pages/site personalization 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 MD, SF 4 4 Mautic Email/landing pages/site personalization 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 CW, HUB, MS, PD SF, SU, VT, ZH 4 4 Oracle Eloqua Email/landing pages/site personalization 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 MS, OCRMON, OSC, SF 4 4 Salesforce Pardot Email/landing pages/site personalization 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 SF 4 4 Salesfusion Email 4 4 8 4 4 4 4 BH, MD, SG, IN, NS, SF, SU 4 8 SharpSpring Email/landing pages 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 SF 4 4 CRM abbreviations: Batchbook (BA), BH (Bullhorn), CW (ConnectWise), HUB (HubSpot), IN (Infor), Microsoft Dynamics 365 (MS), OCRMON (Oracle CRM On Demand), ONS (Oracle NetSuite), OSC (Oracle Sales Cloud), PD (Pipedrive), SF (Salesforce), SG (Sage CRM), SU (SugarCRM), Teamgate (TG), VT (VTiger), ZH (Zoho).

Prospects are managing more of the buying process themselves, creating decision short lists by researching brand websites and social channels without ever speaking to a sales rep. To be effective, B2B marketers must be creative, targeted and aligned with sales goals; they must also have greater visibility into buyer attributes and behaviors. Faced with these challenging market dynamics and increasing ROI pressure, B2B marketers at companies of all sizes can gain these benefits from a marketing automation platform: • Increased marketing efficiency. Automating time-consuming, manual tasks around content creation, management and personalization; campaign scheduling and execution; data hygiene (i.e. duplicate or inconsistent data residing in various silos); communication with sales; and lead nurturing saves time and improves productivity. • Enhanced ability to generate more and better qualified leads. Marketing automation can combine multiple criteria, including demographic, firmographic and behavioral data (pages visited, downloads, filled out forms) with a lead scoring system to generate and identify sales-qualified leads. • A multichannel view of prospect behavior. Today’s marketing automation platforms are integrating multiple channels and devices – including social media and mobile -- to create more comprehensive prospect profiles and holistic views of prospect behavior. • Better alignment of sales and marketing goals. Marketing automation software can help align sales and marketing efforts to ensure that sales reps are working with sales-ready leads. By working cooperatively to set scoring parameters and define qualified leads, sales and marketing become one team. Marketing works on building relationships with early stage leads to enable sales to focus their efforts on the most highly qualified prospects. • Improved lead conversion and ROI. Numerous studies have found that using a marketing automation system can increase conversions. Forrester found that B2B marketers implementing marketing automation experience a 10% increase in their sales-pipeline contribution. Marketing automation can result in a 15% increase in sales productivity as well as a 12% decrease in marketing overhead, according to tech research firm Nucleus Research. B2B marketing automation platform pricing Virtually all marketing automation platforms offer SaaS-based pricing, meaning software is licensed by the customer and hosted by the vendor. Several vendors targeting the enterprise market also offer on-site installation and implementation services. Pricing is often based on the number of contacts in the marketing database, the number of email marketing messages sent each month and/or the number of users. Many vendors require annual contracts (although some offer month-to-month pricing) and may offer discounts in exchange for longer-term commitments. The proliferation of digital channels and devices has made it difficult for B2B marketers to accurately target prospects with the right messages, on the right devices, at the right times.\n\n16. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 12 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Recommended steps to making an informed purchase Understanding your current marketing processes, knowing how to measure success and being able to identify where you are looking for improvements, are all critical pieces of the marketing automation platform decision-making process. The following section outlines four steps to help your organization begin that process and choose the marketing automation platform that is the right fit for your business needs and goals. Step One: Do you need a marketing automation platform? Deciding whether or not your company needs a marketing automation platform calls for the same evaluative steps involved in any software adoption, including a comprehensive self- assessment of your organization’s business needs, staff capabilities, management support and financial resources. Use the following questions as a guideline to determine the answer. 1. Have we outgrown our current marketing system? Marketing automation is often a solution for companies that are growing rapidly and need to scale their efforts. If you have data in multiple databases that cannot be consolidated or are using an email system that can’t deliver the level of behavioral targeting you need, it may be time for marketing automation. 2. What marketing automation capabilities are most critical to our business? Identify and prioritize your software requirements and the key capabilities you’ll need from the new system. Do your sales reps need real-time access to marketing data? Then native CRM integration is a must have. Do you have a sophisticated social media presence? Then social marketing management and integration will be important. By knowing what you need, you’ll be in a better position to control the selection process and choose the platform that will most benefit the organization. 3. What kind of marketing automation platform do we need? Marketing automation is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it’s important to find the right fit. Nearly all companies offer the same basic capabilities for email, website tracking and a marketing database. Additional capabilities vary, however, so it’s important to identify what you need. Is inbound marketing (social media, blogging, SEO) more important than outbound (email)? Are reporting and analytics the key features you need? Is lead scoring a crucial part of your marketing process? Do you need greater capabilities in audience segmentation and personalization? 4. What are our goals? It is critical to know upfront what your goals for the marketing automation system will be. Do you want to improve the quality of leads handed off by marketing to sales? Or increase revenue by increasing conversion at key stages in the buying cycle? Do you want to improve visibility into the buying and sales cycles to optimize marketing engagement? Or do you want to reach the growing portion of your leads that are mobile users? Bring key stakeholders together to establish the organization’s goals. 5. How will this platform integrate with our existing martech stack? The odds are that you already have a martech stack in place, (e.g., several standalone tools for social media management, SEO, webinar hosting, etc.). You’ll need to identify them all so you can ask the marketing automation vendor about integration. Many vendors offer app marketplaces, which provide faster access to the participating systems. Virtually all marketing automation vendors offer APIs, but they may be an add-on to the price of the platform.\n\n17. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 13 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Every marketer should have an executive sponsor to secure support at the C-level. If you are not the ultimate decision maker for this purchase, you will need management to buy into the idea before you go any further. 6. Does management support this purchase? Every marketer should have an executive sponsor to secure support at the C-level. If you are not the ultimate decision maker for this purchase, you will need management to buy into the idea before you go any further. Present a compelling case that the benefits of new software vastly outweigh the costs. This could include converting more leads, making sales more efficient and improving campaign ROI. 7. Do we have the internal skillset and staff necessary? To maximize your ROI, staff will need training and a willingness to develop and execute new business processes. You may also need to consider several new hires. If your marketing and sales organizations have been operating in silos, they will need to work more cooperatively on lead scoring and routing systems, lead qualification definitions and more effective marketing collateral and communications. Identify someone in the organization who will take the lead on the selection process, as well as who will be using the system once it has been adopted. 8. How will we measure success? This is one of the toughest questions, and ties in directly to understanding why you are adopting a marketing automation platform. If your goal is to increase conversions, you’ll need to know what your conversion rate is before automation in order to measure its impact. If it’s to improve email efficiency, be prepared with metrics on open rates, clicks, etc. In addition to measuring against your marketing goals, it’s wise to measure the depth and breadth of platform usage. Many marketers only use basic email capabilities, which ends up being a costly investment. 9. Have we realistically assessed the cost? Some marketing automation platforms are all inclusive, while others feature add-on tools and services that can significantly increase costs. In addition to the cost of the software license itself, consider the costs of ongoing services and training, as well as the indirect costs associated with getting staff up and running on the new system (i.e., more cooperation and data sharing between marketing and sales). If you don’t have your own IT or design staff, be sure to ask questions about what these services cost on an hourly basis. For example, if the platform offers templates, find out how many, and how much it costs to customize template design. Step Two: Identify and contact appropriate vendors Once you have determined that marketing automation software makes sense for your business, spend time researching individual vendors and their capabilities by doing the following: • Make a list of all the marketing automation capabilities you currently have (i.e., email blasting), those that you would like to have (i.e., predictive scoring or recommendations) and those that you can’t live without (i.e., plug-and-play CRM integration). This last category is critical and could help you avoid a costly mistake. • Take your list of capabilities and then do some research. The “Resources” section at the back of this report includes a list of blogs, articles and industry research that will help. (Many of the vendors profiled in this report also provide whitepapers and interactive tools that can help.) • Narrow your list down to the vendors that meet your criteria. Submit your list of the marketing automation capabilities you’ve identified and set a timeframe for them to reply. • Decide whether or not you need to engage in a formal RFI/RFP process. This is an individual preference but be sure to give the same list of capabilities to each vendor to facilitate comparison.\n\n18. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 14 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide The most effective RFPs only request relevant information from the vendors and provide ample information about your business and its marketing automation needs. The most effective RFPs only request relevant information from the vendors and provide ample information about your business and its marketing automation needs. Let the vendor know how you plan to use marketing automation, including your high-level strategic goals and KPIs and how you will evaluate the success of your marketing automation efforts. Include details about timelines and the existing digital technology you have deployed. When written properly, an RFP will facilitate the sales process and ensure that everyone involved on both sides come to a shared understanding of the purpose, requirements, scope, and structure of the intended purchase. From the RFP responses, you should be able to narrow your list down to three or four platforms that you’ll want to demo. Step Three: Scheduling the demo Set up demos with your short list of vendors within a relatively short timeframe after receiving the RFP responses to help make relevant comparisons. Make sure that all potential internal users are on the demo call, and pay attention to the following: • How easy is the platform to use? • Does the vendor seem to understand our business and our marketing needs? • Are they showing us our “must-have” features? • If we ask a specific question, can they demonstrate the answer on the call? Other questions to ask each vendor include: • How easy is it to integrate this software into my organization? • What is the onboarding process? • How long does implementation take? • What kind of support and training are included in the base price? • What does your partner and developer community look like? • How do I maximize adoption in my organization? • Will we have a dedicated account rep available to us? • Do current customers utilize the full functionality? • What new features are you focusing on for the coming year? • Can we do a test run for a few days on our own (i.e., a free trial)? • How do you protect and secure customer data? Do you have a roadmap for what you would do in the event of a hack? Don’t hesitate to ask for a demonstration of the specific capabilities that you have identified in your RFI/RFP. Consider requesting product demos showing basic tasks and demonstrating core reports: • Create and edit a new email from scratch. • Import and segment data. • Base data management, cleansing and enrichment options. • Create and edit a new landing page from scratch. • Execute a simple campaign with an email, mailing list and landing page. • See a report showing email opens, clickthroughs and landing page conversions. • See a report showing web traffic and/or specific leads from an email campaign. • ROI dashboards and reports at the organization and campaign levels. • Campaign attribution options and capabilities. This is an ongoing relationship; it’s important to feel that your questions are being answered.\n\n19. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 15 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Step Four: Check references, negotiate a contract Before deciding on a particular vendor, check out its online community and review sites, and speak with one or two customer references, preferably someone in a business similar to yours. The vendor should be able to supply you with several references if you cannot identify ones yourself. You can also ask around at conferences and networking events that you attend. Use this opportunity to ask any additional questions, and to find out more about any questions that weren’t answered during the demo. Make sure that the person you’ve been referred to is someone who is a primary user of the platform. Consider also asking these basic questions: • Why did you license a marketing automation platform? • Did you migrate to this platform from another? If so, how was the conversion process? • Why did you select this platform over others? • How long did the system take to implement? • Has this platform lived up to your expectations? • Did you receive the level of support you needed? • What CRM system is this platform integrated with? Are you pleased with that integration? • Were there any surprises that you wish you’d known about beforehand? • Where have you seen the most success? The biggest challenges? • How are you measuring your own success? • How responsive is customer service? • Has there been any down time? • What is the most useful, actionable (favorite) report the platform generates? • What do you wish they did differently? • Why would you recommend this platform? Although not all vendors require an annual contract, many do. Once you’ve selected a vendor, be sure to get in writing a list of what technology and support are covered in the contract. Ask about what kinds of additional fees might come up. Are there charges for custom design, and, if so, how much? What is the hourly charge for engineering services, and is there a minimum? What partner organizations are available to install and integrate the platform? If you need to train a new hire mid-year, what will that cost? Obtaining the answers upfront – and having them in writing – will ensure fewer surprises or additional costs down the road.\n\n20. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 16 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Conclusion While martech budgets experienced a lift in 2018-19, marketing leaders are still expected to be able to demonstrate ROI for any new technology investment. Marketing automation platforms are a critical part of the martech ecosystem, offering numerous benefits by streamlining manual B2B marketing tasks, including lead management, email campaign development and landing page creation. These platforms offer a wide range of advanced features, including AI-based predictive lead scoring and product recommendations, ABM and social media campaign integration. They also integrate seamlessly with many third-party CRM and other point solutions to offer extended capabilities. The key to ensuring ROI is to make sure the platform is easy to use and scale and is suited to your organization’s goals. Platform vendors offer extensive training programs, online communities and strategic consulting services to encourage more comprehensive platform use and create a higher return on marketing automation investments. To identify the marketing automation platform vendor that is the right fit for your organization, it is imperative that you understand your current marketing processes, recognize where you need to improve and know how you will measure success. By performing your due diligence in researching and interviewing marketing automation vendors, your search can come to a successful conclusion and result in greater long-term ROI and business productivity. n\n\n21. © 2019 Third Door Media, Inc. • http://thirddoormedia.com 17 Email: martechtoday@digitalmarketingdepot.com Vendor profiles MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: B2B Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer’s Guide Act-On Software 121 SW Morrison St., Suite 1600 Portland, OR 97204 (T) (877) 530-1555 www.act-on.com Target customer • Emerging growth and mid-market B2B companies across a variety of industries, including business and financial services, manufacturing, higher education, insurance and technology.
