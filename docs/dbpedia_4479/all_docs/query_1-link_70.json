        "text": "What is HubSpot?\n\nHubSpot is a marketing and sales platform that offers a range of software products, including Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and CRM. Individuals, start-ups, SMBs, and enterprises use these products to optimize their RevOps channels.\n\nWhether you want to gain and retain customers or foster your customer service processes, HubSpot helps you with sales promotion and inbound marketing solutions.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you probably use HubSpot as your CRM.\n\nWhat is NetSuite?\n\nNetSuite is a cloud-computing platform for enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), financial management, e-commerce, and professional services automation (PSA).\n\nIts unified business management suite gives you access to products, solutions, and services for delivering business applications across the internet and primarily managing ERP financials.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you probably use NetSuite as your ERP and billing tool.\n\nWhy integrate HubSpot with NetSuite?\n\nUsing NetSuite, CRM customers can connect their marketing and sales efforts with HubSpot to measure their campaigns and sales revenue more effectively.\n\nWith NetSuite’s SuiteCloud Connect, you can integrate a series of packaged solutions with HubSpot and benefit from on-demand and on-site enterprise applications that monitor performance.\n\nYou’re probably looking for one of two scenarios:\n\nQuote-to-cash, or a way for HubSpot CRM closed-won accounts to populate NetSuite billing information for the finance team to begin collecting revenue.\n\nLead matching, routing, and management, where HubSpot is your marketing automation tool and NetSuite is your CRM, and you need new leads and existing contact engagement to map back to NetSuite accounts and contacts.\n\nWhat’s the best way to sync HubSpot with NetSuite?\n\nYou can integrate HubSpot with NetSuite in two ways. Here are your strategy options:\n\nNative sync using HubSpot or NetSuite\n\niPaaS tools (NetSuite to HubSpot and back)\n\nCommon problems\n\nNetSuite is notoriously difficult to integrate with marketing and sales tools like Salesforce, Outreach, and HubSpot. In fact, companies turn to only a handful of providers or instead use off-the-shelf iPaaS tools.\n\nIf you’re thinking about using native sync, read this first. The troubleshooting and managing process is time consuming.\n\nIf you’re thinking about using iPaaS tools to build field-level mappings between HubSpot and NetSuite, consider that you’ll need many workflows to keep all fields up to date.\n\nInstead, you should be able to use a tool that provides codeless, stateful synchronization across both tools and others in your stack.\n\nIntro to Syncari for HubSpot to NetSuite sync\n\nSyncari is a RevOps automation platform that unifies your data across all go-to-market (GTM) systems. When you need customer success tools, sales engagement solutions, ERP, finance, data enrichment, and more, our platform facilitates the process.\n\nBuild your deduplication and merge logic in Syncari’s Merge Studio, then maintain it over time. Syncari keeps running during NetSuite outages and syncs data once it’s back online.\n\nThen, build your own quote-to-cash or lead management workflows — without code.\n\nRegardless of the location or number of sources you have, Syncari simplifies your data synchronization from start to finish.\n\nHow to sync HubSpot with NetSuite using Syncari\n\nYou can route data from objects within HubSpot and NetSuite to select entities using Syncari’s Sync Studio. You’ll see data updates in near real time, whether files are deduplicated, enriched, or cleansed before being stored in Syncari.\n\nThe HubSpot Synapse synchronizes these objects:\n\nCompany\n\nContact\n\nOwner\n\nTicket\n\nProduct\n\nThe NetSuite Synapse synchronizes these objects:\n\nContact\n\nCustomer and opportunity\n\nEmployee\n\nJournal entry\n\nVendor\n\nAssembly and inventory items\n\nItem group\n\nNon-inventory purchase and resale items\n\nKit item\n\nOther charge purchase, sale, and resale items\n\nPayment, service purchase, and service resale items\n\nDescription item\n\nDiscount and gift certificate items\n\nMarkup and subtotal items\n\nSales order and sales order line items\n\nInvoice and invoice line items\n\nCustomer payment and customer payment line items\n\nPrice level\n\nFile\n\nSubscription (i.e., line, change order, change order line, plan, plan line)\n\nCurrency and subsidiary\n\nBilling account and billing schedule\n\nContact Syncari"
