        "text": "Let’s look at the differences between Oracle NetSuite vs. QuickBooks to understand better what to use in different business situations.\n\nYou are a small business or just a startup. You are looking for business accounting software/ERP for streamlining your financial and accounting processes. You come across names like Oracle NetSuite, QuickBooks, etc. In this article, let’s compare Oracle NetSuite vs. QuickBooks.\n\nBe it a small business, a mid-size firm, or a large multinational, businesses need a solution to streamline all business operations. What is the best solution for it? NetSuite. It is an NetSuite ERP solution that helps in managing all business processes, such as:\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nHuman resources\n\nFinancial planning\n\nInventory and ordering process\n\nSupply chain\n\nProduction and procurement\n\nAccounting processes\n\nAnalytics\n\nEcommerce\n\nProfessional services\n\nQuickBooks is accounting software with options like QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Enterprise, and QuickBooks Premier.\n\nThough not the same, both QuickBooks and Oracle NetSuite make the financial and accounting processes efficient. NetSuite does more than that, while QuickBooks is primarily focused on accounting and financial management. It depends on you, your business requirements, budget, and many other factors to choose one of these.\n\nQuickBooks\n\nWith QuickBooks, you only have the accounting functionality. So you need to integrate with other software to streamline other business functions, such as customer relationships, inventory, procurement, etc. That is an added cost for you. Also, sometimes, the integration does not result in the efficiencies you expect.\n\nAlso, reporting becomes challenging because of data storage in one application and analytics in another. You need to generate insights for each business function separately and then relate them for a better perspective.\n\nNetSuite\n\nOn the other hand, NetSuite is an expansive platform with seamlessly integrated business functions. So the data storage is a shared repository accessible to all business functions. This allows you to generate comprehensive insights on all business functions in real-time.\n\nYou don’t need to integrate it with other software or platforms to generate reports. Thus, everyone in the organization is aware of all the facets of business performance. It helps you make strategic decisions, giving you an edge over others.\n\nQuickBooks\n\nSince QuickBooks is an accounting and financial management software, it gives you all insights into your business performance. QuickBooks Online Accountant has a dashboard with main KPIs, metrics, ratios, figures, and actionable items. Thus, with formulas and charts, you can better view your financial performance.\n\nYou can also look at the historical numbers to compare past and current performance. You can also compare your performance with industry benchmarks, peers, your own set goals, and competitors. Thus, QuickBooks allows you to view your business performance quantitatively.\n\nNetSuite\n\nThe best part about NetSuite is its capability to perform collective business functions. A single source of data that can help you with decisions in all aspects of the business. It automates all business processes, making your operations smarter, faster, and more accurate. Your hiring and human resources costs reduce, and there are fewer errors in operations.\n\nWith an integrated view of all business functions in one place, you don’t need to extract data from several places and collate them for insights. The software generates insights, giving you real-time visibility of your business performance. With complete focus on your performance, you can increase your revenues and walk on the path of growth.\n\nOnce you implement the NetSuite ERP software, your IT infrastructure remains free from other integrations required. This reduces your IT costs, which can be used for other strategic initiatives. Thus, you improve your business’s overall productivity.\n\nThus, NetSuite gives a clear, comprehensive view of your quantitative and qualitative performance. It’s not only about the numbers but also a qualitative performance dashboard that helps in decision-making.\n\nQuickBooks\n\nYou can get QuickBooks on a monthly subscription basis, depending on your chosen plan. The subscription price ranges from US$25.0 to US$180.0 per month. If you want to integrate add-ons, such as Tsheets, Payroll, etc., you have to pay additional monthly costs. You need to renew your subscription every month, either directly or through an authorized QuickBooks partner.\n\nThe other costs include upfront costs and recurring costs. The initial setup charges are minimal, but you need to pay additional money for add-ons, support, and user training. You might be required to pay for any consulting or bookkeeping services, depending on your in-house capabilities. Also, there is an annual software subscription fee.\n\nNetSuite\n\nIn the case of NetSuite, you need to sign a yearly contract, which requires annual renewal. You can do it directly with Oracle or with a NetSuite partner. But, the pricing structure is customized depending on the features you need, the number of users, business size, and other factors.\n\nThere are additional upfront and recurring cost elements as well. You have to pay the annual software subscription and support fees. If needed, you might have to pay additional money for consulting or optimization requirements. Besides, you have to spend your dollars on support services for NetSuite implementation, data migration, NetSuite integration, customization, and other support."
