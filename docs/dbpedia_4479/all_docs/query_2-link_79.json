        "text": "NetSuite manages corporate data and has been quite successful at its cloud-based system of sales, order and inventory management software.\n\nNow it has developed software to help customers build complex retail operations using little more than a Web design team. It could also fundamentally change what NetSuite does.\n\n“We want to make it so anyone can be Amazon,” said Zach Nelson, chief executive of NetSuite. “This is a commerce back office that any Web designer can plug into and use what he wants.” He said the offering, called Commerce as a Service, will work for small shops and “the biggest companies in the world, that want to control everything.”\n\nIf successful, NetSuite could enable large and small companies the kind of online customer knowledge, product recommendations and order management used by Amazon.com (though without the powerful analytics that enable Amazon to keep selling you stuff.)\n\nThe product is designed to work for commerce between companies, even automated sales between, say, a car with sensors that indicate a headlight is out and a dealership with the part.\n\nMr. Nelson said NetSuite would also partner with other emerging commerce companies, like Square, to offer customers online payments software. “We need a few partners so we can remove all of the operational friction in e-commerce,” he said. “Over all, business data and transactional data has to become a single stream of information.” Besides Square, he said NetSuite will work with Stripe, a payments company aimed at software developers, and Bazaarvoice, which analyzes the content of social media for brands.\n\nNetSuite, along with Salesforce.com, was one of the earliest enterprise software companies to offer business software online. Salesforce tended to focus on a company’s outward-looking functions, like customer management. NetSuite, which was originally financed by Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, has concentrated on the more complex challenge of inward-looking areas like inventory and accounting.\n\nNetSuite has been public since 2007, and in 2011 had revenue of $236 million, a 22 percent increase from 2010. The company’s competitors, however, include both incumbent enterprise resource planning companies like SAP, which are building their own cloud businesses, as well as newer upstarts like BizSlate and Acumatica.\n\nMr. Nelson said NetSuite’s transition to the commerce-as-a-service offering took 18 months of engineering work, which involved decoupling NetSuite’s own back end system from the way it interacted with customers.\n\n“We’ve put all hands on deck for this,” he said. “Every company will be a commerce company.”"
