With experience across industries including professional services, wholesale and distribution, manufacturing, and more, Dev.co’s Netsuite development services can boost your business’s efficiency and maximize value across all aspects of your operation.\n\nNetsuite Development Services\n\nNetsuite provides high quality, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) infrastructure for all your business’s needs. With experience across industries including professional services, wholesale and distribution, manufacturing, and more, Dev.co’s Netsuite development services can boost your business’s efficiency and maximize value across all aspects of your operation.\n\nWhat Is Netsuite?\n\nNetSuite is today’s top Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, designed for maximum flexibility across a wide range of functions, from eCommerce to business intelligence – and this flexibility is its primary appeal. Because it’s built for the cloud, NetSuite is easy to scale up as your business grows, and the system comes outfitted with development tools and resources for building industry-specific applications.\n\nThe DEV.co NetSuite Development Services\n\nHow can Dev.co support your business’s NetSuite development needs? We focus on building out quality services from across your business’s lifecycle, including the following:\n\nFinancial Management And Planning\n\nAcross the board, NetSuite’s ERP is designed to provide operational visibility so that your business can take advantage of new opportunities as they come your way. In order for that to be possible, you need a clear sense of your financial picture, including modeling capabilities, budgeting, analysis, and reporting.\n\nOrder Management\n\nWhat happens when your business receives an order? Depending on the products you offer, maybe it’s a simple process - a customer orders a list of products and you pack them up and shift them out. Or maybe you offer made-to-order products requiring a longer process, from quote to confirmation, fulfillment and invoicing. Whatever your system demands, NetSuite’s system can prevent order bottlenecks, helping you complete orders quickly.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management is critical to business success, yet these systems become more complex all the time. Keep track of where your products come from, where they’re needed, and ensure just in time delivery and minimized stress on your warehouse system.\n\nWarehousing And Fulfillment\n\nSpeaking of warehouses, NetSuite’s ERP excels at warehouse management and fulfillment, allowing your business to optimize space usage and minimize costs. Data-driven warehousing also enables faster order fulfillment; as with other parts of the NetSuite ecosystem, its warehousing and fulfillment functions let you see the big picture so that your business operates efficiently and generates the greatest profits.\n\nHow We Develop For NetSuite\n\nMulti-platform Integrations\n\nAt Dev.co, we know just how powerful NetSuite can be - and we also know that it works best in conjunction with other systems. That’s why, when we develop for NetSuite, we emphasize multi-platform integrations, pairing NetSuite with such applications as Avalara, Jitterbit, Magneto, and Salesforce, among many others.

Originally, NetSuite was a cloud-based accounting management program.\n\nBoth Evan Goldberg and Zach Nelson, who joined NetSuite as CEO in July 2002, previously worked for Larry Ellison, the co-founder and CTO of Oracle. Ellison was one of the company’s original investors, offering $125 million in startup capital in 1998.\n\nNetSuite made history as the first cloud computing company. It predates Salesforce by about one month.\n\nNetSuite is the largest cloud Enterprise Resource Planning system, serving over 40,000 customers around the world.\n\nNetSuite is headquartered in San Mateo, California.\n\nThough NetSuite has primarily developed its own services, the company has also acquired nine other software companies since 2008, allowing it to offer a comprehensive software suite. NetSuite’s acquiitions include LightCMS, Monexa, TribeHR, and Retail Anywhere.\n\nNetSuite offers five primary product categories: Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, E-commerce, Professional Services Automation, and Enterprise Performance Management.\n\nNetSuite was acquired by Oracle in July 2016. Despite this, NetSuite operates independently as a Global Business Unit and is still led by its original management team.\n\nAs part of their commitment to supporting non-profit services, NetSuite donates their non-profit solution with no-cost activation to qualifying organizations.\n\nNetsuite’s solutions serve a wide range of businesses and non-profits. Some of their clients include the famed comedy club The Second City, the food and agriculture cooperative Land O’Lakes, microloan non-profit Kiva, and the cosmetics company, e.l.f.\n\nBack to top ^"
