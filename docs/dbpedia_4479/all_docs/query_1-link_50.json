NetSuite’s robust, full-featured CRM offering empowers small and mid-sized businesses with the tools and technologies they need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the broadest range of customer-touching processes.\n\nNetSuite goes beyond traditional CRM by incorporating cutting-edge, fully-integrated capabilities for document management and publishing, order and incentive management, Web site management and analytics, project tracking, and customer self-service.\n\nUnlike other CRM software packages that focus primarily on prospect and opportunity management, NetSuite enables effective management of the entire customer lifecycle, tracking and storing complete customer purchase histories and order information.\n\nAs a result, sales staff can produce more accurate forecasts and generate more revenue, while marketing teams can boost ROI by deploying more successful programs and promotions.\n\nAnd, NetSuite CRM integrates seamlessly with any corporate Web site, making it an integral part of the selling process. So companies can further leverage this powerful marketing tool (which is often the preferred method of interaction for prospects and customers) to implement more effective cross-channel communications, increase conversions, and enhance service delivery.\n\nNetSuite CRM is a fully-hosted, on-demand solution that is available in two editions. NetSuite CRM provides features to support sales force automation, marketing automation, and customer service and support. Additionally, it delivers a real-time key performance indicator (KPI) dashboard, business intelligence and analytics, productivity tools such as email integration and group calendaring, and full customization and application building functionality.\n\nNetSuite CRM+ provides all the capabilities of NetSuite CRM, plus advanced sales force automation features such as expense reporting, incentives, and order management; a partner relationship management module; Web site building, hosting, and analytics; and a comprehensive customer knowledge base."
