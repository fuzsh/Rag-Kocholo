        "text": "The digital world is full of acronyms, two of the most common being SaaS (Software as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service). These terminologies might seem overwhelming, especially when trying to understand platforms like NetSuite. One of the questions that often arise when talking about NetSuite is: \"Is NetSuite a SaaS, or is it PaaS?\".\n\nOr read the SaaS businesses complete guide to selecting NetSuite >\n\nA Quick Recap: SaaS and PaaS\n\nBefore diving into NetSuite's classification, let's briefly understand what SaaS and PaaS are. In the simplest terms, SaaS is a software delivery model that allows users to access a software application over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. SaaS applications are usually fully developed and ready-to-use software solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, PaaS offers a platform that allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications. It provides a framework that makes it easier to create applications, eliminating the complexity of infrastructure management.\n\nThe NetSuite Lowdown\n\nNetSuite, a product of Oracle, is a comprehensive business management suite that includes functions like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), PSA (Professional Services Automation), and e-commerce. But, is NetSuite a SaaS or is NetSuite PaaS?\n\nIn essence, NetSuite is a SaaS platform. It is a fully developed software solution that customers can subscribe to and access over the internet. It does not require customers to manage servers, databases, or any other aspect of the underlying infrastructure. Instead, customers simply log in, set up their company's information, and start running their business operations.\n\nThe beauty of SaaS solutions like NetSuite lies in their scalability, flexibility, and the fact that all you need to access them is an internet connection. This means you can manage your business operations from anywhere, at any time.\n\nIs NetSuite PaaS or SaaS, Really?\n\nAs mentioned, at its core, NetSuite is indeed a SaaS solution. However, the lines between SaaS and PaaS are becoming increasingly blurred, thanks to the advent of PaaS-like features within SaaS applications.\n\nIn the case of NetSuite, there's SuiteCloud - a suite of cloud development tools, applications, and infrastructure that provide developers with the ability to create additional functionalities and bespoke applications on top of the NetSuite platform. This offering can be viewed as somewhat 'PaaS-like', as it allows for customisation and expansion of the original software, aligning with the basic definition of a Platform as a Service.\n\nHowever, despite this PaaS-like feature, NetSuite remains primarily a SaaS solution. The platform's main use is not for creating new applications but rather using the existing software to manage business operations. SuiteCloud's PaaS-like capabilities are an additional benefit for those who want to tailor the software to their specific needs, but it doesn't change the fact that at its core, NetSuite is a SaaS.\n\nScale your business with Annexa + NetSuite\n\nYour trusted NetSuite partners in sales, implementation, development and support across Australia and New Zealand.
