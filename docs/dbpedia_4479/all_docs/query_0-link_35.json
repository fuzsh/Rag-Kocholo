We're building best-in-class machine learning and LLM-powered scoring for outbound sales teams. Our first product lives in Salesforce, ingests data from a variety of sources (firmographics, intent signals, marketing interactions, and prior engagement, including unstructured call transcripts, email chains, and notes), and combines LLMs with structured models to tell sales reps who they should reach out to each day (and why) to be laser-focused.\n\nOur paying customers are fast-growing unicorns you've definitely heard of with large outbound sales motions, where the reps use us to target their outbound every day. Our thesis is that scoring (a known/\"need to have\" part of the stack -- but able to be done 10x better with LLMs because you can incorporate the goldmine of unstructured engagement data) is the right wedge into building the intelligence-driven outbound sales stack of the future that _actually works_ for large companies that need to generate millions of dollars in pipeline each quarter. Unlike most other companies in the space, we are explicitly building for companies of this scale and have them using our product today \"in production.\" We have a 100% close rate from pilot → paying customer and want to scale our customer base aggressively this year.\n\nWe started with the vision of bringing AI to every business team, and have since narrowed down to focus on outbound sales teams who have a bunch of attractive properties (there are a _ton_ of them out there, they all use the same stack, the data is consolidated in one place, lift is measurable and directly touches the top line, etc.).\n\nWe're a team of 6 working in-person in NYC with a team from Scale/Waymo/Google/etc. (including some very senior folks) and looking to bring on a couple more engineers as we start scaling our customer base, in both product & solutions engineering roles. If you have at least a few years of experience, are highly entrepreneurial / excited to work closely with customers + dig in across the business, and are excited to work on some combination of LLMs/data infra/across the stack, we would love to chat: mihir [at] actively.ai!\n\nKeywords: AI, ML, LLMs, machine learning, Salesforce, explainable AI, product engineering, SQL, solutions engineering, data infrastructure\n\nModash.io | Senior Data Engineer | Remote | Full-time | Europe\n\nHey there!

As Solaris Japan continued its success and our customer base grew, we sought solutions to serve our customers, and added Shopify to our toolkit.

Thus, Lunaris was born, and with it additional e-commerce solutions like easyPoints, easyRates, and more.\n\nWe are a team of international engineers, and are actively seeking a few more engineers to join our growing team:\n\n- Senior/Lead Engineer - https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/senior-lead-developer\n\n- Fullstack Engineer - https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/full-stack-developer\n\nTech stack: Elixir, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, React (mostly JS)\n\nIf Lunaris sounds like a good fit for you, and you're ready for a new experience in Japan (or already living here), please check out the above positions and send in your application.\n\nOf course, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach us at jobs@lunaris.jp\n\nBeneKinetic | Founding iOS Engineer | Washington DC Area or Remote (+/- 5 hours EST) | $150 - $175k | Equity\n\nBeneKinetic is a cutting-edge technology company dedicated to enhancing the lives of individuals with musculoskeletal and neurological conditions through its innovative mobile application.

Our vision is to transform houses so we make the living experience sustainable and yet convenient. We have two product lines. One is Roof-1 which is a solar panel, and unlike the conventional solar panels, the color and texture of the module is well-designed so it’s hard to distinguish the roof and module. Architectural designers in Japan love that appearance, and we have high demand since last year. Another product is Home-1 which is a built-in IoT system: automated lighting, curtains, heating and cooling, smart locks, distribution board, and more, all preconfigured to work out-of-the-box. Best of all, you’ll have seamless control of your home through our beautiful UI, which you can access through a touchscreen built into the house or through your phone.\n\nWe are seed-stage Tokyo startup (will have the series-A round soon) with a top-tier international team.

It's preferable if you have the basic knowledge/skill of web development, such as RDS/NoSQL and HTTP/socket.io communications.\n\nSome of our employees have relocated to Tokyo and the company can support relocation and VISA. Remote work is welcome in this company, and most developers are working remotely, but it’s necessary for this role to sometimes go onsite and check how devices work with your programs.\n\nIf you are interested in visiting our website, here’s the link but unfortunately it’s only in Japanese. https://www.monochrome.so/\n\nIf you have any questions or wish to apply for the position, please send an email to so[at]monochrome.so with your inquiries or your resume.

Where other AI companies see only words, we see the other half of human communication: subtle tones of voice, word emphasis, facial expression, and more. These behaviors reveal our preferences—whether we find things interesting or boring; satisfying or frustrating; funny, eloquent, or dubious. Trained with billions of human expressions, our LLMs will be better question answerers, copywriters, tutors, call center agents, and more.\n\nOur goal is to enable a future where technology draws on an understanding of human emotional expression to better serve our goals and support our well-being. We currently provide API access to our expression measurement models to help developers build better healthcare solutions, digital assistants, communication tools, and more, optimizing their products for human well-being. We're also building a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind empathic voice assistant.\n\nWe're seeking technical talent interested in working with our research team to build state-of-the-art LLMs and scale up our systems. Our new LLM training method - reinforcement learning from human expression (RLHE) - learns human preferences from behavior in millions of audio and video recordings, making LLMs superhumanly helpful, interesting, funny, eloquent, honest, and altruistic. Join us in the heart of New York City and contribute to our endeavor to ensure that AI is guided by human values, the most pivotal challenge and opportunity of the 21st century.\n\nAs part of our mission, we also conduct groundbreaking scientific research, publish in leading scientific journals like Nature, and support a non-profit, The Hume Initiative, that has released the first concrete ethical guidelines for empathic AI (www.thehumeinitiative.org).\n\nYou can learn more about us on our website (https://hume.ai/) and read about us in Axios (https://www.axios.com/2023/01/26/startup-ai-emotions-hume) and The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/17/artific...).\n\n꩜Substrate | Founding Engineer | NYC – Hybrid/Onsite\n\nWe're building a never-before-seen way to declare, run, and scale an ensemble of ML models. You'll get to build a deep understanding of this fast-evolving space, design greenfield developer interfaces and infrastructure, and co-create the culture of what could become a generational company.\n\nBecause we're building an ambitious developer product, we're extremely selective with early hires. We're looking for engineers who are extraordinarily meticulous about the foundations, really sweat the details when designing interfaces, abstractions, and infrastructure, and are willing to wear the many hats we'll need to scale this business.\n\nOur founding team is a group of friends that have known each other for the last decade since meeting at Venmo in 2013. Rob (CEO) was the founding engineer at Substack, Smalltalk, and Fin.com. He’s been hacking on GPU pipelines for years, and built AI features for startups before realizing he should be building reusable infra instead. Ben (Cofounder) spent the last 8+ years at Stripe, where he led mobile and was the founding engineer on Stripe Terminal. Liam (founding engineer) spent the last 8 years at Grailed, recently acquired by GOAT.\n\nWe've raised a large seed round from notable VCs, the founders of Vercel, Venmo, Substack, and others.\n\nApply: Email ben@substrate.run with your resume\n\nMore info: https://publish.obsidian.md/-/Join+Substrate\n\nPolarsteps | Multiple positions | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Full-time (or 4 days/week) | Hybrid | VISA (with relocation package) | https://careers.polarsteps.com/\n\nWe're an Amsterdam-based team of 50 (and counting) with 20+ nationalities amongst us – a varied, skilled bunch of \"Citizens of The World\" with hundreds of thousands of kilometers under our travel belts.

It's surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. Climate change and the resulting natural disasters are forcing even more people to become map-makers, and Felt is here to meet that need. It's the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record.

Every day we get bombarded with content from social networks, news sites, blogs, messages, etc. It’s hard to keep up and it’s even harder to find the content that really matters to you. It takes time and energy to sift through the noise and find what really matters. That's why we created Upnext, our flagship product that lets users easily organize reading, audio, and video content in one neat space. We’re not stopping there, our latest app helps you stay up to date on the topics and news that you care about by aggregating updates into a single place. Using our own AI models we’re building in deep personalization from the beginning so Upnext users will always have the most important updates about topics they care about. We've got open roles for:\n\n- Software developers: our tech stack is TypeScript / Node / React / Python - Designers: we're creating a seamless, beautiful experience across desktop, native and web - ML research / ML engineer: help us design build and deploy our first generation of recommendation and understanding systems - Marketing / growth: help us get the word out!\n\nIf you'd like to chat, email me at joe [at] upnext [dot] in!\n\nBRINC Drones | https://brincdrones.com/ | Onsite in Seattle | Full-time | $150-225k + equity\n\nBRINC Drones helps first responders with products that quickly and effectively respond to emergencies. Our technology lets first responders get eyes and ears on what's happening in indoor structures when it's too dangerous for people to enter - whether it be a fire, medical emergency, violence, or search and rescue. In March 2023, we released the Lemur 2, our latest and most advanced drone, and we started shipping it to customers the same year.\n\nIn addition to launching more advanced drones, we're also expanding our software ecosystem into realtime monitoring and fleet management, and we recently shipped the first version of our first web app: LiveOps. This app gives drone operators and first response teams access to real-time live-streaming drone data such as visual and thermal video feeds, 3D map data via point clouds, and a myriad of drone telemetry – it’s essentially a web-based drone fleet management software. But our vision isn’t just fleet management; LiveOps represents a critical part of BRINC’s transition from a company that just sells drones to a company that sells entire drone programs: we want to build out the entire drone ecosystem (both hardware and software) for our customers.\n\nIt’s an ambitious goal, but it’s one that we feel confident about – we’ve got a lot of interest from customers in what we’ve built so far, and we are seeking both a full-stack and a backend/platform engineer to join our engineering team and own the development of this web app and cloud ecosystem.\n\nJob Postings:\n\n- Senior/Principal Full-stack Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f...\n\n- Senior/Principal Backend & Platform Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5...\n\nSome recent press:\n\n- https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-wit...\n\n- https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/\n\nI'm the founding engineer for the cloud services engineering team at BRINC, so feel free to relay any questions about the role to me (dylan at brinc drones dot com, parse it yourself), but please apply through the job posting if you're interested in the role so that we can keep track of you!\n\nJuniper (YC W21) | Senior Software Engineer, Senior Frontend Engineer | HYBRID NYC | Full-time | juniperplatform.com\n\nJuniper operates at the messy infrastructure layer for US Healthcare. We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.\n\nHealthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.\n\nWhat’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.\n\nWe’re changing that.\n\nAt Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)\n\nOur typical paid rate is above 95%.\n\nWe are a team of 25 with STRONG product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.\n\nYou’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.\n\nEmail me at chris@juniperplatform.com\n\nRoboflow | Open Source Software Engineer, Web Designer / Developer, and more. | Full-time (Remote, SF, NYC) | https://roboflow.com/careers?ref=whoishiring0124\n\nRoboflow is the fastest way to use computer vision in production. We help developers give their software the sense of sight. Our end-to-end platform[1] provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.\n\nOver 250k engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models[2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill[3] and Supervision[4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog[5] and YouTube channel[6].\n\nWe have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy & we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders & problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0124\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring0124\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0124\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nY Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Infrastructure Software Engineer | Bay Area | Full-time\n\nI currently run YC’s infrastructure and I need some help! Over the last 7 years I’ve been at YC, our software team has grown considerably both in engineers and in products. We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly.\n\nThe main thing you’ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it’s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511.\n\nThe first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).\n\nThe main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you’ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you’ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform). You’re probably the person people turn to when there’s a fire to put out.\n\nYC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/0Ewh...). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents. And if you’re curious about startups (and possibly starting one someday), this job gives you amazing access to interact with YC’s programs, partners, and founders.\n\nIf you’re interested, I’d love to chat! I’m mark@ycombinator.com.\n\nSurge AI (https://surgehq.ai) | Software Engineers (full-stack or applied ML) | Full-time | SF or Remote\n\nOur mission at Surge is to build the human infrastructure powering the next wave of AI and LLMs. We’re building a data platform that powers AI teams at OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, and more.

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.\n\nMoreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.\n\nHow can this be, and how can we change it?\n\nNuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.\n\nToday, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.\n\nBut -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?\n\nAbsolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.\n\nIn 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients.

Specifically:\n\n• You should be comfortable and familiar with the core of our tech stack (Java / Spring / PostgreSQL / AWS).\n\n• You should need be able to get up to speed quickly on an unfamiliar project and, after a short period of orientation, be able to self-teach / find your way around on your own.\n\n• A key requirement is that you should be able to cover for me if I become sick or unavailable - you should quickly reach the point where you can reliably carry out urgent development work unsupported.\n\n• A mathematical background would be a plus - our pricing model is somewhat technical and one of the key things we need to support.\n\n• As the team grows, you should be able to skill up quickly enough to be able to support and mentor less experienced developers who still need some help finding their way around.\n\n• Being able to assist with interview and recruitment processes would also be a plus.\n\nDeveloper - £60k-85k\n\n• You should have experience writing software as part of a team, using Git or other version control.\n\n• You should know how to write automated tests and understand why they are important.\n\n• You don't need to have the depth of experience necessary to become fully autonomous on day one, but once you understand a task and the area of the codebase you're changing, you should be capable of working reliably and independently.\n\nPlease email a CV / cover letter to careers@paratusltd.com to apply.\n\nPlantingSpace | Full-time | Remote (EU time zone) with quarterly gatherings | https://planting.space\n\nWe are building a system that can accurately represent knowledge and handle uncertainty, to enable the discovery of insights and solve problems based on explainable reasoning.
