Beyond accounting functionality, NetSuite offers a wide range of features, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), inventory management, and e-commerce capabilities. Due to NetSuiteâs robust software features and scalability, itâs an ideal choice for rapidly scaling businesses and those looking to expand and support their operations as they reach the next stage of growth.Â\n\nNetsuite is currently the top-purchased ERP tool on the Vendr Buying Platform â with 10x more purchases than competitors such as Workday and Certinia â and was the 8th most renewed SaaS product in 2023. Netsuite customers can also integrate the platform with Vendr to gain a more comprehensive picture of their SaaS spend. Check out our detailed guide on whatÂ Netsuite is and how it's used for more information.\n\nQuickBooks overview\n\nQuickBooks is one of the most popular accounting software choices for small to medium-sized businesses. Known for its short learning curve and user-friendly interface, core accounting capabilities, and affordability, QuickBooks offers several pricing tiers and packages. Between the two, QuickBooks is more geared toward businesses with smaller software budgets and those needing fewer additional capabilities beyond accounting.Â\n\nFeature comparison: NetSuite vs. QuickBooksÂ\n\nNow itâs time to compare and contrast platform features related to accounting and financial management, inventory and order management, scalability, and integration.Â\n\nAccounting and financial managementÂ\n\nBoth NetSuite and QuickBooks provide users with industry-leading accounting and financial management features. Their differences lie in the depth of features and reporting capabilities provided by each platform.Â\n\n1. NetSuiteÂ\n\nOffers comprehensive financial management features, including general ledger, cash management, accounts payable, and accounts receivable.Â\n\nContains real-time financial tracking and reporting to monitor financial performance and make data-driven decisions.Â\n\nComplies with international accounting standards, making it ideal for multi-national companies.Â\n\n2. QuickBooksÂ\n\nOffers core accounting features, including invoicing, bill payment, and income and expense tracking.Â\n\nContains reporting capabilities, enabling organizations to generate financial statements and track key performance indicators (KPIs).Â\n\nQuickBooks complies with United States accounting standards, making it a great software solution for smaller businesses primarily operating within the U.S.Â\n\nInventory and order managementÂ\n\nInventory and order management features are provided by both QuickBooks and NetSuite, but their respective features are catered to different needs.\n\n1. NetSuiteÂ\n\nIncludes complex, multi-location warehousing solutions that make NetSuite more suitable for businesses with multiple warehouses or distribution centers.Â\n\nOffers advanced inventory management features, including inventory forecasting, demand planning, and cycle counting.Â\n\nIntegrates well with eCommerce platforms so businesses can easily manage online sales and inventory within the same software platform.Â\n\n2. QuickBooks\n\nIncludes basic inventory tracking and management features.Â\n\nBusinesses can track inventory levels, manage purchase orders, and generate basic inventory reports.Â\n\nIntegrates well with the most popular eCommerce platforms, including Shopify and WooCommerce.Â\n\nScalability and integration\n\nOne of the most significant differences between NetSuite vs. QuickBooks is their scalability and integration capabilities.Â\n\n1. NetSuite\n\nNetSuite is designed to grow with medium or large businesses, providing scalability and customization options.Â\n\nContains a comprehensive suite of business management applications, including CRM and human capital management.Â\n\nNetsuite offers a wide range of integration capabilities, enabling businesses to connect third-party applications and services.Â\n\n2. QuickBooks\n\nOffers a more straightforward, user-friendly interface without quite as many detailed customization options.Â\n\nProvides basic integration capabilities enabling businesses to connect to popular third-party applications and services.\n\nContains a few additional business management applications, including payroll and time tracking.Â\n\n{{cta2}}\n\nPricing and valueÂ\n\nBoth QuickBooks and NetSuite offer several pricing tiers and packages, so businesses must consider their organizationâs specific needs and software budget when evaluating the best option.Â\n\nNetSuite pricing overview\n\nOne of NetSuite's biggest advantages is its customizable pricing model in which businesses choose the specific features and modules they need. NetSuite offers two classifications for its suite of apps: Legacy and SuiteSuccess, each with multiple service levels based mostly on the number of users and business entities that will use the software.\n\nThe cost of NetSuite varies widely depending on an organizationâs size and the number of additional applications and modules it requires. The base ERP software package costs $999 per month plus $99-$200 per user per month, with optional add-on modules, like Advanced Financials and its CRM application, costing an additional $300-$800 per month.\n\nTo find what NetSuite will cost your company per month, you will need to contact them for a quote.Â\n\nQuickBooks pricing overview\n\nQuickBooks offers several pricing tiers that are a bit more straightforward than NetSuite and more affordable for small businesses. QuickBooks online access starts at $30 per month for the Simple Start package, and up to $200 per month for the Advanced package.\n\nQuickBooks also offers a self-employed pricing model for freelancers, contractors, and sole proprietors that starts at $20 per month and goes up to $40 per month for its tax bundle features, including access to CPAs.\n\nSimilar to NetSuite, the overall price for QuickBooks depends on the specific features and software capabilities your business needs. While these features are less robust than NetSuite, thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find that using QuickBooks is more than adequate for their businessâs needs.Â\n\nChoosing what's best for your business\n\nThe NetSuite vs. QuickBooks comparison comes down to your businessâs needs and size. Both are powerful software solutions designed to help businesses streamline operations and manage financials. Each caters to different scales of business operations and software needs, so itâs essential that a businessâs decision-makers thoughtfully evaluate their software requirements before making a decision.Â\n\nConsider the size of your company, the complexity of business operations, and your specific accounting and financial management needs, along with the available software budget.
