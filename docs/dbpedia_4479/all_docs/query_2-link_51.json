        "text": "What Is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)?\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) is a platform companies use to manage and integrate the essential parts of their businesses. Many ERP software applications are critical to companies because they help them implement resource planning by integrating all the processes needed to run their companies with a single system.\n\nAn ERP software system can also integrate planning, purchasing inventory, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and more.\n\nUnderstanding Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n\nYou can think of an enterprise resource planning system as the glue that binds together the different computer systems for a large organization. Without an ERP application, each department would have its system optimized for its specific tasks. With ERP software, each department still has its system, but all of the systems can be accessed through one application with one interface.\n\nERP applications also allow the different departments to communicate and share information more easily with the rest of the company. It collects information about the activity and state of different divisions, making this information available to other parts, where it can be used productively.\n\nERP applications can help a corporation become more self-aware by linking information about production, finance, distribution, and human resources together. Because it connects different technologies used by each part of a business, an ERP application can eliminate costly duplicates and incompatible technology. The process often integrates accounts payable, stock control systems, order-monitoring systems, and customer databases into one system.\n\nHow Enterprise Resource Planning Platforms Work\n\nERP has evolved over the years from traditional software models that made use of physical client servers and manual entry systems to cloud-based software with remote, web-based access. The platform is generally maintained by the company that created it, with client companies renting services provided by the platform.\n\nBusinesses select the applications they want to use. Then, the hosting company loads the applications onto the server the client is renting, and both parties begin working to integrate the client's processes and data into the platform.\n\nOnce all departments are tied into the system, all data is collected on the server and becomes instantly available to those with permission to use it. Reports can be generated with metrics, graphs, or other visuals and aids a client might need to determine how the business and its departments are performing.\n\nTypes of ERP Systems\n\nThere's a number of different ERP solutions that can meet a variety of business needs. This list is not meant to list every single type of ERP, though the list is pretty comprehensive. Any business considering implementing an ERP system should be able to find value in some of these types of systems, and multiple systems may be relevant in any given situation.\n\nOn-Premise ERP\n\nOn-premises ERP systems involve purchasing the software licenses and installing the ERP system directly onto a company's own servers. Companies have full control over the system and data, as it resides within their premises. Customization and integration with existing systems can be more extensive, and this type of ERP usually requires dedicated IT resources for maintenance, updates, and security.\n\nCloud ERP\n\nCloud ERP systems are hosted on remote servers and accessed through the internet. Cloud ERPs like SaaS products offer better scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust resources and features as needed without significant upfront investment in hardware. Cloud ERP systems typically have a subscription-based pricing model, and updates/maintenance are managed by the ERP provider (not the company itself).\n\nIndustry-Specific ERP\n\nIndustry-specific ERP systems are tailored to meet the unique needs and requirements of particular industries. These systems often include industry-specific modules, functionalities, and best practices to address the complexities of the industry. For example, consider a manufacturing firm that is heavily reliant on inventory, supply chain management, and distribution of goods. That type of ERP will be vastly different than a client-based ERP such as a financial institution's ERP.\n\nOpen-Source ERP\n\nAn open-source ERP system (or any open-source software, for that matter) provides users with access to the source code. This means a company can customize, modify, or redistribute the ERP to better meet the company's needs. Implementing and maintaining open-source ERP systems may require more technical expertise and resources compared to commercial ERP solutions.\n\nSmall Business ERP\n\nOn the other hand, small business ERP systems are designed specifically for the needs of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). These types of ERP systems try to offer balance between being slightly niche while offering essential functionalities at a more affordable price point. Because they are less robust, small business ERP solutions are often easier to implement and require less customization compared to enterprise-level ERP systems.\n\nTiered ERP\n\nTiered ERP systems offer different levels of functionality and scalability to cater to businesses of varying sizes and complexity. Companies can choose the tier that best matches their current needs and budget, with the option to upgrade or customize as their requirements evolve. This would entail adding on modules as they become relevant (i.e. a company that is scaling to international operations may wait to implement foreign current modules).\n\nBenefits of ERP\n\nBusinesses employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) for various reasons, such as expanding, reducing costs, and improving operations. The benefits sought and realized between companies may differ; however, some are worth noting.\n\nImproves Accuracy and Productivity\n\nIntegrating and automating business processes eliminates redundancies and improves accuracy and productivity. In addition, departments with interconnected processes can synchronize work to achieve faster and better outcomes.\n\nImproves Reporting\n\nSome businesses benefit from enhanced real-time data reporting from a single source system. Accurate and complete reporting help companies adequately plan, budget, forecast, and communicate the state of operations to the organization and interested parties, such as shareholders.\n\nIncreases Efficiency\n\nERPs allow businesses to quickly access needed information for clients, vendors, and business partners. This contributes to improved customer and employee satisfaction, quicker response rates, and increased accuracy rates. In addition, associated costs often decrease as the company operates more efficiently.\n\nIncreases Collaboration\n\nDepartments are better able to collaborate and share knowledge; a newly synergized workforce can improve productivity and employee satisfaction as employees are better able to see how each functional group contributes to the mission and vision of the company. Also, menial and manual tasks are eliminated, allowing employees to allocate their time to more meaningful work.\n\nERP Weaknesses\n\nAn ERP system doesn't always eliminate inefficiencies within a business or improve everything. The company might need to rethink how it's organized or risk ending up with incompatible technology.\n\nERP systems usually fail to achieve the objectives that influenced their installation because of a company's reluctance to abandon old working processes. Some companies may also be reluctant to let go of old software that worked well in the past. The key is to prevent ERP projects from being split into smaller projects, which can result in cost overruns.\n\nERP vs. CRM\n\nERP and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms are two different types of software systems used in business. At their core, ERP focuses on internal business processes and operations, while CRM is centered around managing interactions with customers and prospects.\n\nERP systems are designed to integrate and automate core business functions. In contrast, CRM systems are dedicated to managing customer relationships and interactions. This can range from things like sales leads, marketing campaigns, customer service inquiries, and contact management. While the goal of ERPs is to streamline processes, the goal of CRMs is to enhance customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty.\n\nDespite their distinct focus areas, ERP and CRM systems often overlap in certain areas. Many modern ERP systems include CRM functionalities. This integration enables businesses to synchronize customer information, such as contact details, purchase history, and communication logs, between ERP and CRM systems. For example, a CRM would traditionally host a customer's purchase history. By looping that into a broader ERP system, a company can predict when the customer will re-order, make sure it has sufficient quantity on hand at a specific time, and make sure it has enough personnel on hand at a specific time to fulfill the potential order.\n\nERP Solutions Providers\n\nSome familiar names are leaders in ERP software. Oracle Corp. (ORCL) originally supplied a relational database that integrated with ERP software developed by SAP (SAP) before entering the broader enterprise market in a big way in the early 2000s. Microsoft (MSFT) has long been an industry leader, with many customers using multiple software applications from the company.\n\nAs cloud-based solutions have grown in popularity in recent years, the traditional ERP industry leaders have seen challenges from upstarts such as Bizowie and Workwise.\n\nERP Examples\n\nFulton & Roark\n\nMen's grooming product maker Fulton & Roark successfully implemented enterprise resource planning to better track inventory and financial data. Like many other businesses, the North Carolina company used spreadsheets to track inventory and accounting software to record financial data.\n\nAs the company grew, its processes lagged. Their antiquated inventory tracking system did not account for changing costs, and the accounting software could not record the metrics needed for key financial statements. These breakdowns created manual processes, which further compromised time and resources.\n\nTo eliminate unnecessary processes and centralize work, they chose the Oracle NetSuite ERP system. Immediately, Fulton & Rourk was better able to identify accounting errors related to inventory, eliminate costs from employing third parties to evaluate their financial records, and better report financial positions.\n\nCadbury\n\nCadbury, a global confectioner and maker of the popular chocolate Cadbury egg, also successfully implemented an ERP system. The company had thousands of systems but could not keep pace with its rapid growth and used ineffective warehouse management systems.\n\nIt implemented a system that integrated its thousands of applications, standardized processes, and restructured warehouse management systems—breaking down silos for seamless, integrated coordination of work.\n\nTips for Choosing an ERP System\n\nWhen selecting an ERP system, there's many things for you to consider. Here are some key features to consider during your decision-making process:\n\nEnsure that the ERP system can scale with your business as it grows and evolves. It should accommodate increasing transaction volumes, users, and data without significant disruption or performance issues.\n\nSeek an ERP solution that allows for customization to adapt to your unique business processes and requirements. You can get customizable workflows, fields, forms, and reports from ERP systems fairly easily.\n\nConsider the ERP system's ability to integrate seamlessly with other software applications you may already be using. Think about your CRM, e-commerce platforms, payroll systems, and business intelligence tools. If it's important to you, your ERP can likely communicate with each of them.\n\nIf you plan on using your ERP often, choose an ERP system with an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use. A well-designed interface can help people buy into the software as well as simply make it more intuitive on how to capitalize on all of the ERP features.\n\nIf it's relevant to you, opt for an ERP solution that offers mobile accessibility. Mobile access allows you to perform key tasks, access information, and make decisions in more flexible ways which may be important based on how your business operates.\n\nPrioritize data security and compliance features to protect sensitive business information. Look for ERP systems with robust security measures, encryption capabilities, access controls, audit trails, and compliance certifications. Note that ERPs can be industry-specific, so some security measures may be more relevant to your industry.\n\nEvaluate the ERP system's analytical capabilities. This means taking a look at its built-in reporting tools, dashboards, and advanced analytics features. You may also want to think about how real-time information can be pulled in, if that's important to your business.\n\nAs you work through the selection process, assess the level of support and maintenance provided by the ERP vendor. You'll want to make sure you get technical support, software updates, patches, and documentation.\n\nLast, consider the total cost of ownership of the ERP system over its lifecycle. This is not just the upfront implementation cost. Think about ongoing maintenance fees, training costs, and potential hidden costs like \"charge per transaction\" instances. You can also think through what future growth and adding additional modules will cost.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) manages and integrates business processes through a single system. With a better line of sight, companies can better plan and allocate resources. Without ERP, companies tend to operate in silos, with each department using its own disconnected system.\n\nERP systems promote the free flow of communication and sharing of knowledge across an organization, the integration of systems for improved productivity and efficiencies, and increased synergies across teams and departments. However, moving to an ERP system will be counterproductive if the company's culture does not adjust to the change and the company does not review how the structure of its organization can support it."
