        "text": "Reducing ERP Project Risk: Why the Right Provider Matters\n\nIf your business is in the market for enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, there are generally two options for implementing the chosen software – working directly with a software publisher or working with a service provider and value-added reseller (VAR).\n\nToday's ERP projects can often require collaboration with multiple parties; independent software vendors (ISVs) and other line of business application consultants, as well as with your internal resources to support detailed planning, personalization, and change management. ISVs collaborate with business process outsourcing specialists (BPOs), and referral partners — many of whom play a unique, yet non-implementation- focused role. Full-service providers, like Citrin Cooperman’s Digital Services Practice, provide the full range of services mid-market companies need to successfully implement today's more advanced cloud-based ERP systems.\n\nLearn more about how to reduce ERP project risks with our free guide.\n\n* Required\n\n* I understand and agree to Citrin Cooperman’s Privacy Notice, which governs how Citrin Cooperman collects, uses, and shares my personal information.
