        "text": "2)\n\nApplication Complexity: Applications are increasingly complex and deployed as microservices-based architectures that are written in multiple different programming languages with hundreds of loosely coupled service connections. The scale of this complexity is heightened by the advent of the Internet of Things, which increases the number of potential sources of application failure.\n\n•\n\nAbility to build better applications at a faster rate. Cloud-based application development technologies such as container and microservices architectures, enable enterprises to focus developer resources more on creating and improving value-add application features and less on managing underlying operating systems and infrastructure. Gartner estimates that by 2022, more than 75% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, which is a significant increase from fewer than 30% today. In addition to new cloud-based development technologies, enterprises are adopting new processes such as DevOps and Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, or AIOps, that help accelerate the software delivery cycle.\n\n•\n\nOperational efficiency. Enterprises are moving to the cloud to reduce spending on expensive and static systems, the data centers to house them, the energy to run them and the IT staff needed to maintain them.\n\n•\n\nAgility. Cloud services can be purchased dynamically as demand ebbs and flows over time, affording greater flexibility, financial efficiencies, and scale than traditional systems. Enterprises can scale capacity up and down to address seasonality or quickly address unexpected spikes in demand without needing to purchase and maintain infrastructure for peak demand and leaving it underutilized during other times.\n\n•\n\nGreater complexity. Multi-cloud strategies require that IT teams manage applications and ensure interoperability of operations between private and multiple public clouds, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or SAP. In addition, these applications are containerized and increasingly fragmented into microservices that are hosted across multiple cloud platforms, creating interdependencies across heterogeneous environments that increase the risk of incompatibility issues and the number of potential failure points if the applications are not deployed and maintained correctly.\n\n•\n\nHighly dynamic environments. Cloud infrastructure and applications are built to scale up or down in real-time depending upon usage and traffic. The automation required to monitor these highly dynamic environments is beyond what is required for monolithic, on-premise applications.\n\n•\n\nMassive scale. As software becomes more critical to business success, the number and size of applications will continue to grow and encompass more features and greater functionality. At the same time, web-scale architectures are enabling\n\n•\n\nMore frequent changes to software. The adoption of DevOps practices and cloud architectures have increased the speed at which software updates can be developed and deployed. With the application development lifecycle accelerating, enterprises must adapt their software operations environment and culture to ensure that performance and business outcomes are not adversely affected by frequent changes.\n\n•\n\nManual configuration processes that do not scale. Traditional monitoring tools require unique agents for each component of an application and rely on IT personnel to manually pre-configure each agent. The complexity and dynamic nature of multi-cloud applications, which can include thousands of containers and microservices, makes this multi-agent approach costly, slow, and impractical to install and maintain, especially as these applications are rapidly modified and updated.\n\n•\n\nNot designed to capture data across the full application stack. Traditional APM solutions were created to view a limited portion of the full software stack and provide visibility only into individual applications, without providing visibility into how the applications are interconnected. In order to get a complete view of all applications, from the underlying infrastructure to the user experience, IT personnel are required to manually implement and manage many disparate tools. We believe this approach has resulted in enterprises overinvesting in operations and underinvesting in development, which slows innovation.\n\n•\n\nOnly able to provide data, not answers. Traditional monitoring tools provide data only about narrow components of the technology stack. As a result, IT teams must manually integrate and correlate the data from disparate systems and apply their own assumptions to identify the underlying cause of performance issues. This process is slow, prone to errors, and is made especially challenging by the complexity of multi-cloud applications.\n\n•\n\nCollect limited snapshots of data that do not provide real-time observability. Traditional APM tools were not designed for the far larger and more complex data sets produced by multi-cloud applications and can only capture snapshots of application performance or user data. This approach requires these tools to rely on partial data sets, reducing their effectiveness in performing precise root-cause determination, adding risk, and delaying innovation. In addition, traditional monitoring tools do not provide visibility into containers and microservices, which leads to blind spots in software performance monitoring when used in cloud-based environments.\n\n•\n\nLack of flexible deployment options. Traditional monitoring solutions are either deployed as SaaS-only or on-premise-only. SaaS-only solutions often fail to meet the strict governance, security, and scale requirements of large enterprises, and were not built to monitor on-premise applications, making them incompatible with the needs of customers who manage hybrid-hosted applications. Conversely, traditional on-premise solutions were not built to manage cloud applications and are typically upgraded less frequently and thus innovate more slowly than cloud-based applications.\n\n•\n\nSingle agent, fully automated configuration. Dynatrace® is installed as a single agent, which we refer to as OneAgent®, that automatically configures itself, continuously discovering all components of the full-stack to enable high fidelity and web-scale data capture. OneAgent® dynamically profiles the performance of all components of the full-stack with code-level precision, even as applications and environments update and change.\n\n•\n\nFull-stack, all-in-one approach with deep cloud integrations. Dynatrace® combines APM with Infrastructure Monitoring, AIOps, Digital Experience Management, or DEM, and Digital Business Analytics in a single full-stack approach. We believe that this all-in-one approach reduces the need for a variety of disparate tools and enables our customers to improve productivity and decision making while reducing operating costs. Dynatrace® provides out-of-the-box configuration for the leading cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu, and SAP, as well as coverage for traditional on-premise systems, including mainframe and monolithic applications in a single, easy-to-use, intelligent platform.\n\n•\n\nAI-powered, answer-centric insights. Davis™, our explainable AI engine, dynamically baselines the performance of all components in the full-stack, continually learning normal performance thresholds in order to provide precise answers when performance deviates from expected or desired conditions. Unlike correlation engines that overwhelm IT professionals with dozens of alerts from many different tools, Dynatrace® provides a single problem resolution and precise root cause determination. We believe that the accuracy and precision of the answers delivered by our AI engine enable our customers to shift from reactive remediation, providing a substantial advantage in time, resource, efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business outcomes.\n\n•\n\nFlexible deployment options. We deploy our platform as a SaaS solution, with the option of retaining the data in the cloud, or at the edge in customer-provisioned infrastructure, which we refer to as Dynatrace® Managed. The Dynatrace® Managed offering allows customers to maintain control of the environment where their data resides, whether in the cloud or on-premise, combining the simplicity of SaaS with the ability to adhere to their own data security and sovereignty requirements. Our Mission Control center automatically upgrades all Dynatrace® instances and offers on-premise cluster customers auto-deployment options that suit their specific enterprise management processes.\n\n•\n\nExtend our technology and market leadership position. We intend to maintain our position as the market-leading software intelligence platform through increased investment in research and development and continued innovation. We expect to focus on expanding the functionality of Dynatrace® and investing in capabilities that address new market opportunities. We believe this strategy will enable new growth opportunities and allow us to continue to deliver differentiated high-value outcomes to our customers.\n\n•\n\nGrow our customer base. We intend to drive new customer growth by expanding our direct sales force focused on the largest 15,000 global enterprise accounts, which generally have annual revenues in excess of $750 million. Approximately 59% of our Dynatrace® customers added during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 are new customers and the initial\n\n•\n\nIncrease penetration within existing customers. We plan to continue to increase the penetration within our existing customers by expanding the breadth of our platform capabilities to provide for continued cross-selling opportunities. In addition, we believe the ease of implementation for Dynatrace® provides us the opportunity to expand adoption within our existing enterprise customers, across new customer applications, and into additional business units or divisions. Once customers are on the Dynatrace® platform, we have seen significant dollar-based net expansion due to the ease of use and power of our new platform.\n\n•\n\nEnhance our strategic partner ecosystem. Our strategic partners include industry-leading system integrators, software vendors, and cloud and technology providers. We intend to continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on expanding our strategic alliances and cloud-focused partnerships, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, and VMware Tanzu.\n\n•\n\nCloud providers. We work with many of the major cloud providers to increase awareness of our products and make it easy for customers to access our software. Our software is developed to run in and integrate with leading cloud providers, such as, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Our customers are also able to procure our software through leading marketplaces such as AWS, Azure, SAP, and IBM.\n\n•\n\nResellers. Our resellers market and sell our products throughout the world, and provide a go-to-market channel in regions where we do not have a direct presence, such as Africa, Japan, the Middle East, Russia, and South Korea.\n\n•\n\nTechnology alliance partners. We partner with leading innovative technology organizations such as Red Hat, VMWare, and Atlassian to develop integrations, best practices, and extended capabilities that help our customers and solution partners achieve faster time to market and enhanced value in dynamic multi-cloud environments.\n\n•\n\nSystem integrators. We have a network of systems integrators, both global and regional, that help joint customers integrate our products into their multi-cloud ecosystems. These partners extend our scale and reach and collaborate with our direct sales teams, bringing domain expertise in technologies and industries along with additional offerings powered by Dynatrace®.\n\n•\n\nfluctuations in the rate of utilization by enterprise customers of the cloud to manage their business needs, or a slow-down in the migration of enterprise systems to the cloud;\n\n•\n\nthe emergence of significant privacy, data protection, security or other threats, regulations or requirements applicable to the use of enterprise systems or cloud-based systems that we are not prepared to meet or that require additional investment by us;\n\n•\n\nour ability to anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape, or improvements in the functionality of competing solutions that reduce or eliminate one or more of our competitive advantages;\n\n•\n\nour ability to adapt and update our products and solutions on an ongoing and timely basis in order to maintain compatibility and efficacy with the frequently changing and expanding variety of software and systems that our products are designed to monitor;\n\n•\n\nour ability to maintain and expand our relationships with strategic technology partners, who own, operate and offer the major platforms on which cloud applications operate, with which we must interoperate and remain compatible, and from which we must obtain certifications and endorsements in order to maintain credibility and momentum in the market;\n\n•\n\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\n•\n\nrisks associated with trade restrictions and additional legal requirements, including the exportation of our technology or source code that is required in some of the countries in which we operate;\n\n•\n\ncompliance with United States and foreign import and export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security and the executive orders and laws implemented by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls;\n\n•\n\nthe composition of our board of directors, which has the authority to direct our business and to appoint and remove our officers;\n\n•\n\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\n•\n\nafter Thoma Bravo ceases to beneficially own at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, removal of directors only for cause, and subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% or more of our outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote at a meeting of our stockholders called for that purpose;\n\n•\n\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\n•\n\nallowing Thoma Bravo to fill any vacancy on our board of directors for so long as affiliates of Thoma Bravo own 30% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock and thereafter, allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\n•\n\nafter Thoma Bravo ceases to beneficially own at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\n•\n\nafter we cease to be a controlled company, the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\n•\n\nafter we cease to be a controlled company, the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our charter relating to the management of our business (including our classified board structure) or certain provisions of our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\n•\n\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\n•\n\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of
