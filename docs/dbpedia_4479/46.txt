NetSuite Pricing

NetSuite uses a subscription-based pricing model, charging customers a monthly fee to access the software. Fees are based on a per user basis, so costs scale up or down depending on number of users. There are also fee tiers based on functionality needs across the different NetSuite editions (Starter, Standard, Premium). Custom pricing quotes are provided based on each customer's unique requirements.

When estimating total cost of ownership (TCO), it's important to consider the range of business processes managed within NetSuite. With everything on a single unified platform, it can consolidate multiple existing systems and reduce IT infrastructure/maintenance costs. The cloud delivery model also shifts costs from a large upfront capital expenditure to a flexible operating expenditure that scales with the business.

There are also additional costs to factor for implementation services, employee training requirements, and change management. However, the improved efficiency and real-time visibility gained across core business operations can yield significant ROI over time.

NetSuite Reviews

Based on over 700 reviews on Gartner Peer Insights, NetSuite earns an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars. The majority of reviewers are directors and managers in the services, manufacturing, and technology industries. Positive feedback focuses on NetSuite's user-friendly interface, customizability, and excellent ROI. For example, a supply chain director in retail stated, "We have reduced inventory costs by 15% thanks to better demand planning with NetSuite." Negative reviews mention occasional slow page loads, the learning curve for advanced features, and desire for more industry-specific functionality out of the box. Software analysts view NetSuite as a flexible, scalable cloud ERP solution but note that it may not be the best fit for complex global enterprises.
