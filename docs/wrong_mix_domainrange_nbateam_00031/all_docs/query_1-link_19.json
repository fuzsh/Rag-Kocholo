        "text": "The Nuggets add a much needed defensive presence to their young roster in hopes to making the playoffs\n\nThe Eastern Conference exodus continues, as a third star switched conferences last Sunday night. Following the Jimmy Butler and Paul George trades, Paul Millsap decided to take his talents to Denver to create possibly the best frontcourt in the league with Nikola Jokic. How does Millsap fit into the Nuggets system, and will he be able to get the team over the top and into the playoffs?\n\nMillsap is a versatile offensive player, as he is able to get to the line at a very high frequency (over 80th percentile in the league, second among all power forwards with 6 free throws a game) and hit threes at an average rate for a power forward (he shot 32% last year from three, exactly the same as the average NBA power forward). The Nuggets offense was third in the league in Offensive Rating behind Houston and Golden State, so fitting a player with an offensive game like Millsap won’t be an issue for Mike Malone.\n\nThe ball movement in Denver’s offense is also a good fit for Millsap, who averaged nearly 4 assists per game last year, third among all power forwards. The fit of Millsap and Jokic is similar to that of Millsap and Al Horford, which at it’s best anchored a 60-win Hawks team. Look at the dribble hand off between the two bigs in Atlanta here, allowing Millsap to get inside and draw the foul.\n\nHorford and Jokic’s offensive games are very similar, with both being great passers and shooters for their size. It isn’t hard to imagine the Nuggets running similar dribble hand off plays with Gary Harris in place of Korver and Jokic in place of Horford. Millsap will have no problems either in the corner to space the floor or in similar plays to this.\n\nAlthough Millsap’s shot chart is blue almost everywhere other than the mid range and corners, he will have no trouble fitting into the space that is the Nuggets offense. Gary Harris was 5th in the league on catch and shoot threes (46.6%), while Jokic shot an otherworldly 66% in the restricted area. He will have an elite inside threat in Jokic combined with an elite outside threat in Harris, and as a passing/ball handling big, he will fit in without a problem.\n\nThe Nuggets were an offensive juggernaut after giving Jokic the keys to the offense. According to Nba.com/Stats, the Nuggets led the league in offensive rating after December 15th. The problem was that they were last in defensive rating over the same period. Bringing Millsap in is a defensive move for a Nuggets team that ranked 29th in defensive rating for the season. What is interesting is that Millsap might not be the rim protector Denver needs. According to NBA.com/Stats, Jokic had a “Field Goals Defended at Rim Percent” of 57%, while Millsap had 51%. To put it in perspective, Draymond Green led the league at 44%. In other words, 57% is awful, and 51% is average.\n\nSo why does Millsap still rate as a remarkable defensive player if he is only an average rim protector? It’s because he does nearly everything else at an elite level. According to FiveThirtyEight, he is in the top 75th percentile of rebounding rate in the league, 76th percentile in block percentage, and in the mid 80’s percentile of steal percentage. He has a defensive box plus minus of 3.1, as well as 3.35 defensive real plus minus, good for 14th in the league. Millsap is 6’8, quick, and athletically able to defend/switch onto nearly every player in the league. Watch him switch onto DeMar DeRozan off of a pick and roll and force a turnover.\n\nMillsap can also guard a post up big like LaMarcus Aldridge one on one.\n\nHow will Millsap fit with Jokic? The Serbian big has impressive defensive analytics (+2.5 defensive box plus minus according to fivethirtyeight), but is known around the league as a bad defensive player. Think about him as similar to Kevin Love. The eye test is bad; when either player gets switched onto a smaller guard, they can be embarrassed trying to defend them off the dribble. Watch as Jrue Holiday gets to the rim, without even a contest from Jokic.\n\nNeither Love nor Jokic steals or blocks at above average rates either. But both guys are excellent rebounders, which is the reason for their strong defensive ratings. Millsap is exactly the type of player that can complement Jokic’s strength in rebounding with his on ball defense.\n\nThe fit of the two bigs aside, Millsap provides a second star for the Nuggets to stagger minutes with. When Jokic was on the court last season, the Nuggets had a outscored their opponents by 5.1 points per 100 possessions according to NBA.com/stats. When he was on the bench, the Nuggets got outscored by 6.6 points per 100 possessions, which would be equivalent to the third worst team in the league. It isn’t hard to see the difference a player of Millsap’s caliber could make to those numbers. The Nuggets now can have either him or Jokic on the floor at all times. And with the continued development of Gary Harris and Jamaal Murray, two impressive young guards, the Nuggets will definitely improve. This signing alone should be able to get the team over the hump and into the playoffs in a stacked Western Conference."
