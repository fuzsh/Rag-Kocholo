        "text": "Overreaction Monday. T.J. Warren just had his second 30+ minute game of the season for the Phoenix Suns, the third of his career, and I am already thinking we have a future Sixth Man of the Year candidate on our hands. When I say future, I mean this year.\n\nAnthony Warren Jr.\n\nIt is still a young NBA season. Many teams don't know who they are yet, but we are already passed the 20% mark of the season. The next four chunks of 16/17 games will fly by just as quickly. Coach Jeff Hornacek continues to tinker with the rotations and minor injuries haven't allowed him to solidify his lineups. Markieff Morris isn't outplaying Jon Leuer or Mirza Teletovic right now and Tyson Chandler nor Alex Len have made it blatantly obvious one of them needs to be on the floor at all times.\n\nT.J, Warren is making it obvious he needs to be on the floor. Many will petition for him to land in the starting lineup, but there is no reason why Warren can't see 25-30 minutes consistently per game off the bench and solidify himself as one of the most lethal bench weapons in the Association. However, Warren will start if the Suns struggle as the season wears on and the playoffs are not attainable. He may start regardless.\n\nIn Warren's last two performances off the bench, in combination with the other 10 games in which Warren has received 20+ minutes, is mounting evidence towards how truly special he can be in that role. Starting with other offensive minded players like Morris, Knight and Bledsoe could hurt Warren's production.\n\nSmall ball continues to be a thing in the NBA and more teams are throwing out small lineups for extended stretches throughout games. The Suns' own centers have felt the effects this season. If P.J. Tucker continues to average 25 minutes per game, Warren needs a large majority of the other 23 minutes at the small forward position. Majority as in about 22 of them.Warren is demonstrating enough versatility to be at the two or four for small stretches with certain match ups. That will firmly put his slotted minutes at 25+ every single night, and that is how it should be.\n\n20+ Minutes\n\nI am singling out the games in which Warren has played 20+ minutes because it most accurately represents the type of minutes Sixth Man of the Year candidates receive. In fact, the last fifteen sixth men of the year averaged nearly 30 minutes per game. I could cherry pick all games in which Warren has played 23+ minutes to further strengthen my case, but then sample size further becomes an issue.\n\nHopefully Warren's minute surge over his last four games (29.5 minutes per) is a real thing.\n\nIn the 12 games in which T.J. has been at 20+ minutes, he has averaged 25.1 minutes per contest. In those games, Warren has averaged:\n\n15.8 Points\n\n4.2 Rebounds\n\n58% from the field (6.8/11.8 FGM/FGA)\n\n50% from three (9/18 FGA/FGM)\n\nThese numbers are good. Like, great. Sustainable? I think his three point percentage will settle down comfortably below. 40%. Though, I don't think it will plummet into the 20% range either. Warren's overall field goal percentage will also likely finish at least several percentage points below this 58% clip. However, the points and the rebounds should hold pretty firm, if not increase. Especially if Warren keeps trending near or above 30 minutes per game.\n\nAforementioned, the NBA's last 15 - 6th Man of the Year - winners averaged 29.8 minutes per game, 16.1 Points, 4.1 Rebounds, and 3 Assists. At 30 minutes per game, 16.1 Points and 4.1 Rebounds would be floors for T.J. Warren in my opinion. The 3 assists per game would be out of Warren's grasp, but many 6th men are guards, which inflates that area slightly.\n\nAdvanced Statistics\n\nThe back of the trading card statistics don't mean quite as much as they used to with the emergence of advanced statistics that paint a much more accurate picture of value and effectiveness. T.J. Warren stacks up well in this regard as well. Follow below:**Warren is the left side vs. the right side, the average of past winners** and **these numbers include ALL Warren games, not just 20+ Minutes**\n\nWin Shares Per 48 Minutes - .152 vs .155\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating - 19.3 vs 18.8\n\nOffensive Rating - 116 vs 112.4\n\nDefensive Rating - 107 vs 105.9\n\nTrue Shooting - 58.5% vs 57.5%\n\nUsage Rate - 21.4% vs 24.7%\n\nTo summarize the numbers above, we can see Warren is nearly even in terms of Win Shares Per 48 Minutes with past 6th Man winners. However, that WS48 for Warren is including his games in which he didn't really play enough to compile numbers, though that is partially on Warren.\n\nPER, Player Efficiency Rating, T.J. has the edge, and similar to his Win Shares, Warren's PER in just his 12 games of 20+ minutes would be significantly higher than 19.3. I am guessing 20-21, easily.\n\nOffensive and Defensive Ratings wise, TJ grades out very well in both areas. Though, these numbers aren't in a vacuum. Different styles, paces, talent levels. The key take away is that Warren is +9, which looks favorable to the competitions +6.5.\n\nTrue Shooting Percentage, Warren takes it again. Warren's TS% would be in the 60%+ range quite comfortably, if below 20 minute games are removed from the sample. As for Usage Rate, the fact that TJ Warren is putting up the types of numbers he is putting up, while having a very modest Usage Rate in comparison to other 6th men, is pretty indicative of Warren's game.\n\nJust because....In the 8 Games Warren has played 23+ Minutes:\n\n**18 Pts - 4 Reb - 27.1 Minutes - 63.6% FG - 50% 3PT**\n\nQuest For the Ultimate Reserve\n\nT.J. Warren realistically won't win 6th Man of the Year this season. Manu Ginobli, James Harden, Jamal Crawford, Lamar Odom, Jason Terry, Leandro Barbosa, Antwan Jamison, etc. This award is has been being given to some really good players over the years, and most weren't twenty two years old like T.J. Not only that, but the award has been given to really good players on really good teams. However, there aren't many high performing bench players on high quality teams right now. With the season being so fresh, really no one is \"off the table\" yet, in terms of candidacy.\n\nIn fact, only Ben Gordon, 21, in 04-05 and Harden, 22, in 11-12, are the youngest on the list. Leandro won at age 24 in 06-07 and Mike Miller won at age 25 in 05-06. The rest are guys in their primes, 27-33 years of age.\n\nWarren may not be on the bench long enough to win the award,. If he continues to average 25-30 minutes per game this season and Hornacek decides Tucker's intangibles are necessary with the starting lineup, there is no reason why Warren won't finish the season with at least numbers worthy of 6th Man of the Year consideration. Jamal Crawford started 35% of his games in 2013-14, and he still won the award, so a shift into the starting lineup late in the season could still keep Warren in the conversation.\n\nIn this discussion, it would be relevant to review other candidates around the league, to see where Warren falls so far.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans - Ryan Anderson\n\nLong story short, Anderson has been remarkable for the Pelicans. He has come off the bench for 14 of his 17 games, basically averaging 18 Pts - 7 Rebs, on 46/38/85 slash line in nearly 33 minutes per game. His PER sits just below Warren at 18.7.\n\nIf Warren averaged 33 minutes per game, the numbers may be a little closer. Really, a huge factor in this award would be if one of these two teams made the playoffs. If the Pelicans start clicking, Anderson would run away with this award.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves - Zach LaVine\n\nThis is another candidate who is playing lights out off the bench, though he has started over a third of his games thus far, so he falls in that 2013-14 Jamal Crawford candidacy range. At 25 minutes per contest, LaVine is averaging 15 Points, 4 Rebounds, and 4 Assist with a healthy 18.2 PER. His slash line of 45/38/91 is impressive too for a 20 year old. The only thing holding LaVine back is the Timberwolves likely fall towards the bottom of the conference, but the numbers are definitely there.\n\nDenver Nuggets - Will Barton\n\nAnother Western Conference casualty. Similarly to the T-Wolves, the Nuggets aren't going to have a top 8 spot in the West, which hurts Barton's case. However, Barton averages 13 Points, 5 Rebounds and chips in 2 assists in his 27 minutes off the pine. His 47/43/87 would be drastic career highs across the board and his 19.4 PER shimmers as well.\n\nCharlotte Hornets - Jeremy Lamb\n\nLamb is having a really nice season for the Hornets and it is nice to see this young player finally find himself ample opportunity. Lamb has played every game off the bench thus far. His numbers are almost identical to Will Barton, averaging 13 Points, 5 Rebounds, 2 Assists, and a PER of 19.87. He is shooting over 52% from the field in his 25 minutes per contest. The Hornets are 10-7 so far this season, so team performance gives a solid bump to Lamb here.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder - Enes Kanter\n\nEnes Kanter is making the Max salary, so I almost feel he should be disqualified, but the man has played every game off the bench thus far. Kanter is only receiving 20 minutes per game, but is posting nearly a double-double with 12 Points, 8 Rebounds, and a PER that is almost touching 24. Kanter also has an Offensive Rating of 122 and a Defensive Rating of 105. The Thunder play really well when he is on the floor, as he is averaging nearly 21 and 15 per 36 minutes. The Thunder's playoff ready roster gives Kanter a boost too if he doesn't eventually find his way into the starting lineup.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs - Manu Ginobli\n\nThis one is kinda iffy, but is isn't. At age 38, Ginobli continues to be a winning ingredient at a high level. He is only playing 20 minutes a night, but still posting 11 Points, 3 Boards, 3 Assists and a PER of nearly 20. His per 36 minute numbers aren't much below his best years, and the Spurs are still really, really good.\n\nSo there is a chance...\n\nThere are other candidates around the league, of course. No disrespect to players who didn't make my list (apologies to Andre Iguodala), but these were the players who really stood out as I glanced over the rosters, regardless of team standings. If the Pelicans are fighting for an 8 seed (I think they will if health breaks right for them), Anderson clearly will be a top dog. The Hornets are performing well and a playoff birth could land Jeremy Lamb near the top of the conversation. If Manu stays healthy, his numbers, and the Spurs overall record, would help validate his bench heroics. Enes Kanter may be the front runner thus far, and we know where the Thunder will be by seasons end.\n\nOverall, not an immense amount of competition to be deemed the Association's top bench option. Aforementioned, if Warren continues to see 25+ minutes per night, we will see him continue to put up 15+ points per night on his usual high efficiency. The Suns staying above .500 and competing for the 7/8 seed in the West will also strengthen his case.\n\nT.J. scoops, swoops, cuts, oops, dunks, floaters, runners, jumpers, lay ins, etc. etc. Whatever one can do with a basketball before it goes in the hoop, Warren can likely pull it off. At 22 years of age, and his first year in a significant role, Warren's potential as a scorer is off the charts. His long range shot is improving quicker than most anticipated and as long as his teammates can help Warren find the basketball, he will continue his scoring crusade."
