        "text": "Aaron Gordon has played an instrumental role in the Nuggets' success all season long, but his impact reached another level on Friday night.\n\nIn the Game 4 matchup between Denver and Miami, Gordon scored 27 points on 11-of-15 shooting, adding six assists, six rebounds and two steals. He was a team-high plus-29 in the Nuggets' 108-95 win.\n\nGordon not only helped his team take a commanding 3-1 series lead, but also set a new playoff career high.\n\nMORE: Why Jokic's defense was the most impressive part of historic Game 3\n\nWhat is Aaron Gordon's career high in points?\n\nRegular season\n\nGordon set his career high for points during his fourth season with the Magic. On Oct. 24, 2017, he totaled 41 points on 14-of-18 shooting from the field. He also grabbed 14 rebounds in a 125-121 victory over the Nets.\n\nLater that season, Gordon racked up 40 points in a win over the Thunder. Those are the only games in his career in which he has scored at least 40 points.\n\nNBA Playoffs\n\nGordon had the best individual outing of his postseason career on Friday, finishing with 27 points against the Heat.\n\nHis previous playoff career high was 25 points. Gordon hit that mark on April 21, 2019, when the Magic lost Game 4 of their first-round series against the Raptors.\n\nWhat is Aaron Gordon's height and weight?\n\nGordon is listed at 6-8 and 235 pounds on the Nuggets' official roster.\n\nPart of what makes Gordon an effective scorer is his ability to play bully ball against smaller defenders. As Caleb Martin can certainly tell you, trying to battle Gordon for post position is not a fun task."
