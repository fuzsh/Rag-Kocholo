        "text": "ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith is not to hold back when giving opinions about just everything. That brazenness, however, particularly about Brooklyn Nets guard-forward Ben Simmons, got the ire of the player’s agent.\n\nSmith recently called out Simmons for not having “love for the game” anymore during an appearance on The OGs Show. When Simmons’ agent, Bernie Lee, heard Smith’s shot at his client, he tried to give Smith a dose of his own medicine.\n\n“Quite Frankly.. I think Stephen A is an idiot and I only wish he still had he’s TV show so I could sit in his audience and voice my opinion to him while he attempted to do his job…alas.. it got canceled,” Lee said (h/t NetsDaily).\n\nWhat version of Ben Simmons will show up in 2024-25 season with the Brooklyn Nets?\n\nSmith’s point mostly stems from the fact that Simmons has only played a total of 57 games for the Nets since Brooklyn acquired him from the Philadelphia 76ers via the blockbuster trade that also involved former league Most Valuable Player James Harden back in 2022.\n\nSimmons was not able to finish the 2023-24 NBA season because of a back issue, though, he’s been seen on social media working out in the offseason.\n\nSimmons is set to earn $40.33 million in the 2024-25 NBA season but the former Rookie of the Year will be a free agent in 2025. He will have to show up in the coming season if he is to convince teams next year that he still warrants a big contract.\n\nSo far in his time with the Nets, Simmons has averaged just 6.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 6.0 assists while shooting 57 percent from the floor.\n\nFor More NBA, WNBA, and College Basketball Content:"
