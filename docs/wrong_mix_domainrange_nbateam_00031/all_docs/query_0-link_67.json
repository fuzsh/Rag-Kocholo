        "text": "The Denver Nuggets may not be playing in the NBA Finals right now, but fans know better than to count them out next season.\n\nWhether you like it or not, Nikola Jokic is the face of the NBA. The Serbian center may not have the athleticism of the league’s most explosive athletes, but his playmaking and incredible basketball IQ prove him to be one of the most game-changing athletes on the hardwood.\n\nSince his season ended earlier than he would have liked, Jokic has plenty of time to consider whether he would join Serbia’s men’s basketball team to make a serious push for Olympic qualification. While the Joker has blossomed into a terrific athlete in the United States, his homeland hasn’t experienced the benefits of seeing him play for quite a while now.\n\nHowever, he finally made a decision to end all speculation about his eligibility, and it’s news that plenty of Serbians (and NBA fans) would love to hear.\n\nNikola Jokic will join Serbia’s preliminary Olympic team after his disappointing season with the Denver Nuggets\n\nThe Associated Press released a quick article that ends the doubts in everyone’s minds: The Joker will grace Paris with his presence.\n\nWhile nothing is still set in stone until the actual games start, it’s an encouraging sign for Serbian basketball to see their most talented player included in the lineup.\n\nThe piece also included other NBA players who would join Jokic on this trip:\n\nAlso on the list announced by Serbia coach Svetislav Pesic are Charlotte Hornets guard Vasilije Micic, Miami Heat forward Nikola Jovic, Atlanta Hawks sharpshooter Bogdan Bogdanovic and Hornets forward Aleksej Pokusevski.\n\nJokic last played for his country in the 2019 FIBA World Cup, where he put up a stellar display that was a prophecy to his on-court rampage today. He averaged 11.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.8 assists on 68% shooting and 40% from deep through eight games.\n\nJokic’s inclusion to the Serbian lineup adds another tough opponent for USA Basketball’s plans to regain dominance in international tournaments. They can only imagine the kind of havoc he’ll cause on the floor when they can barely contain him when he’s with his Denver Nuggets.\n\nFor More Content"
