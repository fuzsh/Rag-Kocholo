        "text": "Ben Gordon continued the brilliant form which on Tuesday saw him named amongst the NBA Players of the Week as his Detroit Pistons beat the Charlotte Bobcats 98-75 at home last night.\n\nGordon had an efficient 22 points – scoring on 10 of his 15 shots – and added a season-high eight assists.\n\nThe Brit was helped by power forward Charlie Villanueva who scored 30 points and Ben Wallace who didn’t score a single point but contributed nine rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks. The win lifted Detroit to a 4-4 record.\n\nLuol Deng’s Bulls also have a 4-4 record following their 99-89 loss to a Chris Bosh-inspired Toronto Raptors.\n\nBosh, a 6ft 10in power forward who was on the US squad that won gold in the 2008 Olympics, had 28 points and 11 rebounds for the Raptors.\n\nDeng did not disgrace himself though finishing with 18 points, eight rebounds, two steals and two blocks in the loss.\n\nPops Mensah-Bonsu again managed to get some playing time for the Houston Rockets in their 104-79 thrashing of the Memphis Grizzlies. The British power forward didn’t score in his four minutes on the court but managed to pull down three rebounds, dish out one assist and block one shot.\n\nArgentine Luis Scola led the way for the Rockets with 22 points and 15 rebounds. The win was their fifth of the season.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns exploded for 40 first quarter points and kept pouring it on to beat the New Orleans Hornets 124-104.\n\nEight players finished in double figures, led by Amare Stoudemire's 21 points, as the Suns put up their biggest score of the season.\n\nKevin Garnett scored 18 points, highlighted by an alley-oop slam in the third quarter, as the Boston Celtics beat the Utah Jazz 105-86.\n\nGarnett, recovering from off-season knee surgery, suggested he was close to full health with the athletic finish to Rajon Rando's pass.\n\nLeBron James and Mo Williams combined for 64 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Orlando Magic 102-93, gaining a measure of revenge for the Magic's 4-2 victory in the Eastern Conference finals last season.\n\nEven with Tim Duncan and Tony Parker still missing, the San Antonio Spurs found a way to beat the Dallas Mavericks 92-83, shutting down Dirk Nowitzki to do it.\n\nThe German star missed 18 of his 27 shots as his struggles against the Spurs continued.\n\nDanny Granger scored 31 points as the Indiana Pacers survived the early loss of point guard TJ Ford to beat the Golden State Warriors 108-94. Ford left the game with back spasms in the first quarter.\n\nAl Horford scored a game-high 25 points and added nine rebounds and two blocks to help the Atlanta Hawks inflict a fifth straight loss on the New York Knicks, 114-101, at Madison Square Garden.\n\nRookie Brandon Jennings scored a career-best 32 points to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 108-102 win over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nKevin Durant nailed the go-ahead shot with 38 seconds left as the Oklahoma City Thunder topped the Los Angeles Clippers 83-79.\n\nDurant finished with 30 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThe injury-ravaged New Jersey Nets were able to use only seven players but still came close to a victory as they went down 82-79 to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nGreg Oden collected 18 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 107-84 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Minneapolis.\n\nNone of the Brits are in action tonight but the league’s two in-form teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns are set to go head-to-head at LA’s Staples Center.\n\nThe Suns, led by two-time MVP Steve Nash, have won eight of their first nine games while Kobe Bryant’s Lakers have won six of their first seven."
