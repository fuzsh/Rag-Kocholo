It is an honor to announce that Ben Gordon drops in to share his basketball journey with us for a conversation we will never forget.Â \n\nBen Gordon starred at UConn where he was the Big East Tournament MVP and an NCAA Champion. He went on to become the 3rd overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft and was the first and only rookie to win the Sixth Man of the Year Award with the Chicago Bulls. Gordon had an outstanding NBA career that included many clutch moments in a very memorable playoff series. Gordon shares all about growing up in New York, high school days, UConn, Coach Calhoun, Emeka Okafor, Title run, Draft night, that incredible Bulls Celtics series, Ray Allen, business of the NBA, his Players Tribune Article, life after hoops and MUCH more!\n\nWe canâ€™t thank Ben Gordon enough for taking the time to hang out and share his memories from his outstanding career. He has always been a student of the game and we learned some great, valuable things from him that our listeners will love. Be sure to tune in. You do NOT want to miss this one! We are forever grateful for the opportunity.Â \n\nThank you @officialbengordon !\n\nYou can find this episode link in bio or weâ€™re on Apple, Spotify or any source for podcasts.\n\n@emekaikeofficial @uconnmbb @uconn @chicagobulls @trayfour @uconnhuskies @uconncentral @mountvernonelite @nbaalumni #uconn #bengordon #bigeast #mountvernon #emekaokafor #champion #ncaa #bulls #chicago #huskies #nba #podcast #basketball #basketballpodcast #nbapod #conn #chicagobulls #gordon #bg\".",
