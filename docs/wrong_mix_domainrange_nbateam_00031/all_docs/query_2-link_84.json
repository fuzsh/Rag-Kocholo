        "text": "Below, we look at the 50 best NBA players right now. Some youngsters make the list for the first time while all-time greats such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry show no signs of slowing down.\n\nDoes stud San Antonio Spurs rookie Victor Wembanyama land in the top-50? Where is NBA MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander? We look at that and more as the 2023-24 NBA Playoffs continue.\n\nRelated: Updated NBA Playoff predictions\n\n50. Fred VanVleet, Houston Rockets\n\nAfter signing a big-money $128.5 million contract with Houston last summer, VanVleet has played a big role in the team’s emergence to postseason contention. The 29-year-old former All-Star is averaging 16.5 points and 8.2 assists per game. While his shooting numbers are not great (41% FG), VanVleet’s veteran presence has been huge for the Rockets. It enables him to open our list of the 50 best NBA players of 2024.\n\n49. Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nHolmgren is technically in his rookie season after missing the entire 2022-23 campaign to injury. That’s why it’s so surprising he’s been able to pick up where he left off at Gonzaga. The former No. 2 pick is averaging nearly 17 points with 7.6 rebounds per game. He’s also shooting a resounding 39% from three-point range. That type of range is what made the 7-foot-1 center a generational prospect to begin with.\n\n48. Aaron Gordon, Denver Nuggets\n\nAll-around game. An ability to defend pretty much all five spots on the court. Gordon will never be mistaken for a star in the truest sense of the term. But he is certainly among the 50-best NBA players this season. It doesn’t hurt that the former top-five pick is shooting 55% from the field while averaging 3.1 assists per game. Solid stuff.\n\n47. Julius Randle, New York Knicks\n\nThe NBA’s Most Improved Player back in 2021-22, Randle drew a ton of crticism for his performance a season ago. That’s what happens when you play in the bright lights of New York City. Despite suffering a shoulder injury this season, his numbers are as consistent as they get. Randle is averaging 24.0 points, 9.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists. He’s been a catalyst for the Knicks’ emergence to conference title contention.\n\n46. Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nGarland’s numbers are down from each of the past two seasons. But a lot of that has to do with the emergence of other players for a vastly improved Cavaliers team. This doesn’t take away from the fact that he’s still shooting 47% from the field while averaging 18.2 points and 5.9 dishes per game. He continues to be one of the best NBA players this season.\n\nRelated: Top 20 NBA players of all-time\n\n45. Kristaps Porzingis, Boston Celtics\n\nPorzingis could not have found a better fit than the Celtics this past offseason after coming over from the Washington Wizards in a blockbuster trade. He has fit right in with Jaylon Brown and Jayson Tatum for the NBA’s best team. Perhaps, the most astonishing thing here is that Porzingis’ scoring is down from a season ago. But he’s shooting an absurd 53% from the field with a .604 effective field goal mark. Some great splits right there for the Unicorn.\n\n44. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors\n\nIn terms of all-around play, there is little question that Green remains one of the best NBA players. Sure, he has been suspended two times this season. But his play in Golden State has been amazing. The four-time NBA champion is averaging 9.7 points, 6.7 rebounds and 6.1 assists. He’s also shooting a crazy 42% from three-point range. He’ll also be in consideration for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nRelated: Golden State Warriors to reunite with Kevin Durant?\n\n43. Jrue Holiday, Boston Celtics\n\nSpeaking of defense, Holiday continues to do his thing in his first season with the Celtics. The five-time All-NBA Defensive Team performer already boasts a defensive win shares of 2.3 on the season. While his numbers are down from previous seasons (13.1 PPG, 4.8 APG), a lot of that has to do with the star power in Boston. In reality, there is nothing wrong with a “role” player finding himself on this list. The past two are prime examples.\n\nRelated: Jrue Holiday lands in elite company with contract extension\n\n42. Jalen Williams, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nAn All-Rookie performer in 2022-23, Williams has taken his game to a whole new level for a contending team as a sophomore. The Santa Clara product is averaging 19.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.6 assists on 54% shooting. It is just a matter of time before Williams is a perennial NBA All-Star. Not too bad for a player selected in the bottom of the NBA Draft Lottery.\n\n41. Mikal Bridges, Brooklyn Nets\n\nAcquired from the Phoenix Suns in the Kevin Durant trade during last season’s NBA trade deadline, Brooklyn views Bridges as a franchise cornerstone. In fact, the team has pushed back against dealing him for a plethora of picks and young players. For good reason. Since coming over from Phoenix, the wing is averaging 23.2 points while shooting 37% from distance and playing stellar defense. He’s the definition of a three-an-D wing in today’s NBA landscape.\n\nRelated: Highest-paid NBA players of 2024\n\n40. Zion Williamson, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nPrior to the 2023-24 campaign, Williamson had played in all of 114 games in four seasons with the Pelicans. He was seen as an injury-plagued malcontent. While Williamson has missed time this season, he’s been more consistent for the Pelicans. The former No. 1 pick from Duke is averaging 22.4 points, 5.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists on 59% shooting from the field.\n\nRelated: Why the New Orleans Pelicans should trade Zion Williamson\n\n39. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets\n\nInjuries have again limited Ball to a mere 22 games this season. He played in just 36 last season for the Hornets. That keeps him down on our lest of the best NBA players. When on the court, he remains a dynamic threat. In four NBA seasons, Ball is averaging 20.0 points, 5.1 rebounds and 8.0 assists on 37% shooting from distance. He just needs to stay healthy. Thus far, that has not happened.\n\n38. James Harden, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nFrom star to top-end role player? It seems as if the 34-year-old Harden has taken to that latter role in his first season with the Clippers. It’s also leading to a more efficient player than we’ve seen in the past. Harden is shooting 45% from the field, including a 42% mark from three-point range. He’s also averaging 8.4 assists compared to a mere 2.5 turnovers per game.\n\nRelated: NBA Playoff power rankings\n\n37. Dejounte Murray, Atlanta Hawks\n\nThe subject of trade rumors ahead of the in-season NBA trade deadline, Murray just continues to play stellar basketball. Since joining Atlanta in a blockbuster trade from the San Antonio Spurs ahead of the 2022-23 campaign, the former All-Star is averaging 20.9 points and 5.8 assists on 46% shooting. Whether it’s with the Hawks or another team moving forward, he’ll continue to be vastly underrated in the grand scheme of things.\n\n36. Bradley Beal, Phoenix Suns\n\nLike so many others on this list, it’s been all about injuries for Beal. He has suited up in just 30 games in his first season with the Suns after seeing action in a mere 90 games over the past two seasons in Washington. Beal has also seen his production decline (18.2 PPG) in 2023-24. He simply needs to remain healthy to ascend our list of the best NBA players right now.\n\nRelated: Phoenix Suns owner has interesting take after NBA Playoff exit\n\n35. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nA lack of defense? That’s fair. Major struggles in the NBA Playoffs? That’s also fair. What we do know is that Towns is an absolute force on the offensive end of the court. Since the start of the 2018-19 season, he’s averaging 24.1 points and 10.3 rebounds on 40% shooting from distance. It’s unfair how a 7-foot big can expand his range like we’ve seen from KAT over the years.\n\nRelated: NBA executives expect Minnesota Timberwolves to trade Karl-Anthony Towns this summer\n\n34. Brandon Ingram, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe NBA’s Most Improved Player in his first season with the Pelicans back in 2019-20, Ingram simply continues to be a force. Since being acquired from the Lakers in the Anthony Davis blockbuster, he’s averaging 23.3 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.2 assists on 49% shooting. Did we mention Ingram is still only 26 years old?\n\nRelated: New Orleans Pelicans could blow it up this summer\n\n33. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies\n\nThe reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year has picked it up big time from a scoring perspective with Ja Morant injured. Jackson Jr. is averaging a career high 22.3 points on 45% shooting. He also boasts a defensive win shares of 2.2 in 51 games.\n\n32. Rudy Gobert, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nAbout that whole Towns-Gobert fit in Minnesota? It seems to be working out well with the Wolves seen as a legitimate tite contender. Gobert is one of the primary reasons for this. He leads the NBA with a 4.2 defensive win shares this season while averaging 12.5 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game. That seems pretty darn good. It has him as one of the best NBA players right now.\n\nRelated: Minnesota Timberwolves’ Rudy Gobert concludes that he’s a Hall of Famer\n\n31. Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\n\nAlready impressive as a rookie last season, Banchero has morphed into an All-Star as a sophomore for the surprising Magic. He’s averaging 23.0 points, 6.9 reounds and 5.3 assists on 46% shooting. The former No. 1 pick has also upped his three-point game to 37% from a 30% mark a season ago. Yeah, he’s a franchise cornerstone.\n\nRelated: 20 worst NBA players of all-time\n\n30. Pascal Siakam, Indiana Pacers\n\nAcquired by Indiana from the Toronto Raptors ahead of the in-season NBA trade deadline, this two-time All-Star has not missed a beat. He’s averaging 21.4 points and 6.7 rebounds in 15 games with the Pacers. His defense will also likely play a role in Indiana’s improvement on that end of the court.\n\n29. DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls\n\nWhether his career continues in Chicago or another city moving foward, DeRozan will continue to be one of the best NBA players. He just continues to prove it on a yearly basis. Since the start of the 2013-14 season with Toronto, he’s averaging 23.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. The only thing missing from DeRozan’s game is the three-pointer (30% on his career). But the dude is simply a bucket waiting to happen.\n\n28. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat\n\nIt’s amazing to look at how much Adebayo has improved since averaging all of 6.9 points as a rookie back in 2017-18. Primarily, his offense has caught up to his defense. Since the start of the 2020-21 campaign, he’s averaging nearly 20 points per outing to go with 9.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.2 steals while shooting 55% from the field. That seems pretty good.\n\nRelated: Updated 2024 NBA mock draft\n\n27. Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\n\nAt 20 years old, Wemby continues to defy logic. He ranks in the middle of our 50 best NBA players after less than 50 regular-season games. And it’s not controversial. He’s put up historic triple-doubles and boasts some absolutely eye-opening numbers. The 7-foot-4 big is averaging 20.5 points, 10.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and a league-high 3.2 blocks per game. He’s doing so in just over 28 minutes per game. That’s absolutely insane.\n\nRelated: Why Victor Wembanyama could become one of the best NBA players ever\n\n26. Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nMaxey’s career trajectory makes it no real surprise that he was a first-time All-Star this season. He’s improved each and every year he’s been in the NBA. That includes going for an average of 25.7 points and 6.4 assists on 38% shooting from distance thus far this season.\n\nRelated: Tyrese Maxey to land max contract during NBA free agency\n\nBest NBA players: Top-25 NBA players of 2023\n\n25. Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento Kings\n\nAn All-Star snub despite heading into the break averaging 20.1 points and 13.2 rebounds, Sabonis has morphed into one of the most-skilled big men in the game. He’s a triple-double machine with an average of 8.3 assists per, too. The one issue here is defense. It’s probably an area he’ll never be great in.\n\n24. Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets\n\nWhen on the court, Murray is one of the best points guards in the NBA. At issue here is the fact that he’s played all of 105 games since the end of the 2020-21 season. He’s dealt with injuries thus far this season, too. Despite this, Murray is still averaging 20.5 points and 6.5 assists while shooting 41% from distance. That seems pretty good.\n\n23. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks\n\nHas young capped out as someone who puts up huge numbers for a losing team? We might find out this summer with there being a good chance of a blockbuster trade from Atlanta. What we do know is that those numbers are stellar. Since the start of his sophomore campaign in 2019-20, Young is averaging 27.2 points and nearly 10 assists. Even in today’s NBA landscape, those are rare numbers.\n\nRelated: 10 NBA players who could be traded this summer, including, including Trae Young\n\n22. De’Aaron Fox, Sacramento Kings\n\nSince Sacramento broke up the Tyrese Haliburton-Fox backcourt, this dude has turned into one of the best NBA players. That’s not hyperbole. He’s averaging a resounding 26.8 points, 4.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists on 38% from distance. Fox has also morphed into one of the most-clutch players in the Association. The crazy thing here is that he just turned 26 in December.\n\n21. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat\n\nButler’s numbers are down across the board this season after leading Miami to a shocking NBA Finals appearance in 2022-23. He’s also played in just 37 games, which is a clear indication that things could be headed in a downward trajectory for the 34-year-old guard. Despite this, he’s still an all-around force when actually in the game.\n\n20. Paul George, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nStill one of the best two-way players in the game, injuries had caught up to George ahead of the 2023-24 season. The good news here is that he’s remained relatively healthy and is balling out. The six-time All-Star is averaging 22.5 points and 5.3 rebounds on 39% shooting from distance on the campaign. Not too shabby.\n\nRelated: Paul George drawing interest from Eastern Conference contender\n\n19. Damian Lillard, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nIt’s no surprise that Dame has seen his scoring decline in his first season playing with Giannis Antetokounmpo. He’s averaging 24.6 compared to 32.2 with the Blazers a season ago. Lillard is also shooting just 42% from the field, including a 34% mark from distance. This has him down a tad in our latest list of the best NBA players.\n\n18. Kyrie Irving, Dallas Mavericks\n\nIt appears that Irving has found a spot in Big D after some major drama with the Cavaliers, Celtics and Nets earlier in his career. He’s teaming up with Luka Doncic to form one of the best duos in the Association. Thus far on the 2023-24 campaign, Irving is shooting 49% from the field and 41% from three-point range. Those are Stephen Curry-like numbers. He’s also averaging 25.5 points to go with north of five rebounds and five assists per.\n\n17. Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks\n\nA mere second-round pick of the Mavericks back in 2018, we have to hand it to Brunson. He’s gone from a deep bench option to one of the all-around best NBA players. What we’ve seen from the Villanova star this season adds another layer to this. He’s averaging 27.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 6.5 assists on 48% shooting from the field on the campaign. He’s a legit NBA MVP candidate. There is no doubt about that.\n\n16. Tyrese Haliburton, Indiana Pacers\n\nThe Haliburton-Sabonis blockbuster is one of the few modern NBA trades that’s worked out for both teams. This 24-year-old guard is spearheading a surprise playoff contender in Indiana, averaging 21.8 points and a resounding 11.7 assists on 40% shooting from distance. He’s one of the best NBA players and will continue to be for some time.\n\n15. Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics\n\nThere is little doubt that Brown can be a No. 1 option on a contending team. He’s just not that with Jayson Tatum doing his thing in Boston. Despite this, Brown’s splits this season are stellar (49% from the field, 54.9% effective shooting). He’ll need to up his scoring from 22.0 PPG if the Celtics are to accomplish their goal of winning the NBA title.\n\nRelated: Updated NBA Rookie of the Year contenders\n\n14. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nAfter injuries impacted his game over the past several seasons, Leonard has been relatively healthy in 2023-24. It’s led to a rebound performance from the former NBA Finals MVP. Leonard is averaging 24.0 points and 6.1 rebounds on 53% shooting. He’s also shooting an insane 45% from distance.\n\n13. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nA force on defense. That’s what has come to define Anthony Davis’ game as much as what he’s been able to do o offense. The big man boasts a defensive win shares of 3.2 on the season. That stood at 3.4 throughout the entire 2022-23 camaign. He’s also averaging 24.9 points and 12.2 rebounds on 53% shooting. That seems pretty good.\n\nRelated: New York Knicks linked to Anthony Davis on NBA trade block\n\n12. Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nThere had been some question whether Mitchell could be the No. 1 option on a contending team. He’s answered that big time in 2023-24 en route to leading Cleveland to conference title contention. The guard is averaging 28.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 6.3 assists on 47% shooting from the field. It’s been a career-best performance from the five-time All-Star. The only question here is whether Mitchell’s career will continue in Cleveland after the season.\n\nRelated: Donovan Mitchell trade more than likely this summer\n\n11. Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns\n\nBooker, 27, is an absolute machine. Since the start of the 2018-19 season, he’s averaging 26.7 points, 4.4 rebounds and 5.8 assists on 48% shooting. He’s been a perfect fit with Kevin Durant since the star forward joined Phoenix, too.\n\nRelated: Could Devin Booker land with the New York Knicks?\n\nTop 10 Best Basketball Players\n\n10. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nEdwards, 22, certainly deserves to be in the NBA MVP conversation. He’s spearheading a ‘Wolves team with legitimate title aspirations. The former Rookie of the Year is also averaging 26.3 points, 5.2 rebounds and 5.4 assists on 47% from the field. He has not yet come close to hitting his prime. The sky is the limit for Edwards. He’s shown that this season.\n\nRelated: Anthony Edwards’ superstar is exploding in the NBA Playoffs\n\n9. Kevin Durant, Phoenix Suns\n\nAs with others on this list, getting a bit longer in the tooth has impacted Durant’s ability to stay healthy. Even then, he’s still suited up in 48 games this season while continuing to put up elite numbers (28.2 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 5.7 APG). KD is also shooting 54% from the field and 44% from distance. That seems pretty damn good. And it still has him as one of the best NBA players today.\n\n8. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nAs with Curry below, James continues to defy Father Time. He just turned 39 years old in late-December and shows no signs of slowing down. How else can we explain the 20-time All-Star (that’s a thing) averaging 24.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 7.8 assists while shooting 52% from the field? We’re talking about one of the best NBA players ever and someone who continues to shatter the record books.\n\nRelated: LeBron James not committed to the Los Angeles Lakers moving forward\n\n7. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics\n\nWithout a doubt, Tatum should be in the MVP conversation. He headlines the best team in the Association and the odds-on title favorite. He’s averaging 27.1 points, 8.6 rebounds and 4.8 assists on a stellar 48% shooting from the field. He also boasts a defensive win shares of 3.1 on the campaign. Talk about being an all-around stud.\n\n6. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n\nSet to turn 36 later in the season, it’s simply sensational what this four-time champion continues to do. He dropped 60 points in a game earlier this season and leads the NBA with an absurd 252 three-pointers in just 50 games. He’s re-writing record books as we type this. It also doesn’t hurt that Curry is averaging 28 points while shooting 42% from distance. Yeah, he’s an all-time great.\n\nRelated: Updated Golden State Warriors news and rumors\n\n5. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nCurrently sidelined to a torn meniscus, this reigning NBA MVP was in the midst of yet another banner season before going down. That included an absurd 70-point outing against the San Antonio Spurs back in January. All said, Embiid is averaging what woud be an NBA-best 35.3 points to go with 11.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists. The question now is whether he can come back healthy. We know injuries have been a major back drop to the seven-time All-Star’s career.\n\n4. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, guard, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nSGA has morphed into one of the best players in the NBA since coming over from the Los Angeles Clippers in the Paul George trade. He’s now a legitimate MVP candidate for the surprising Thunder, averaging a resounding 31.1 points to go with 5.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists. Still only 25 years old, he leads the Association in offensive win shares and win shares per 48 minutes. Just absolutely insane stuff here.\n\nRelated: Updated NBA MVP race\n\nTop 3 players in the NBA now\n\n3. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\n\nJokic has redefined the modern NBA in that he’s not athletic. He will not make plays above the rim. He will quietly dominate. Winning two consecutive league MVPs adds another layer to this. An historic three-plus year stretch that compares favorably to some of the best bigs ever (26.0 PPG, 12.1 RPG, 8.7 APG) also adds another layer to this. The dude is a future first ballot Hall of Famer. It’s that simple.\n\n2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nHow good has the Greek Freak been over the long haul? Since the start of the 2017-18 season, this dude is averaging 29.0 points, 11.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists on 56% shooting. He put up a 64-point performance earlier in the season and is primed to go off for 80 at some point before his prime ends. About that? Giannis just turned 29 back in December. Craziness.\n\nRelated: Will Giannis Antetokounmpo request a trade during NBA offseason?\n\n1. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks (best NBA player)\n\nAt this point, it’s safe to assume that Doncic is one of the best NBA players of the modern era. He’s pretty much been dominant since making his debut in the Association back in 2018. This season has seen Doncic take it to a whole new level. The five-time All-Star leads the NBA at 34.2 points per game. He’s also averaging 8.8 rebounds and 9.5 assists on 49% shooting. These are historic numbers."
