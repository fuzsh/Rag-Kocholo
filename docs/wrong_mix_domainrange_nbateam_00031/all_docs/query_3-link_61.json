        "text": "There are just nine players from the UK to have played in the NBA, who have come through the British system.\n\nDespite Great Britain hardly being a hotbed for hoops, it is possible to be British and make the league, and below we will show you the select few who have made the big league (find the Brits who made the WNBA here).\n\nBritish-Developed Players to Make the NBA\n\nWe start with British players who originally came through the UK system – playing in it and being coached by British teams – before making the NBA – this does not include those where born in the UK but moved to the US at a very young age.\n\nJohn Amaechi\n\nThough he was actually born in the US, Amaechi was raised in Stockport, England. He first started playing at the age of 17 years old, under the legendary Joe Forber, who now heads up the Manchester Magic programme.\n\nThe 6’10” center was undrafted and then signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1995. He became the first undrafted player to start in his first NBA game as the Cavaliers’ starting center.\n\nAmaechi played 28 games for the Cavaliers during the 1995–96 season before heading to Europe.\n\nHe returned to the NBA ahead of the 1999-2000 season, signing with the Orlando Magic, having his best season in the league as he averaged 10.5 points in 21.1 minutes per game.\n\nAmaechi is famously known for turning down a $17 million contract offer from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2000, opting to remain in Orlando for $600,000 per year. Amaechi went on to play for the Utah Jazz from 2001 to 2003.\n\nHe was traded to the Houston Rockets before the 2003–04 season in exchange for Glen Rice, and, though he was an active player, he did not participate in any games for them. The Rockets later traded him to the New York Knicks before the Knicks bought him out of his contract and he eventually retired from playing the sport altogether.\n\nRobert Archibald\n\nRobert Archibald has his own slice of history as the only Scottish player to make the NBA.\n\nHe was drafted with the 32nd pick in the second round of the 2002 NBA draft by the Memphis Grizzlies, who he signed a 2-year contract with.\n\nAfter one season with the team, in which he played only 12 games, Archibald was traded to the Phoenix Suns, before again being traded in December 2003 to the Orlando Magic. A week later he was traded, for the third time that season, to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nHe played 30 games with the Raptors and holds NBA career averages of 1.2 points and 1.6 rebounds per game.\n\nThe 6’11” big man represented GB for six straight years from 2006-2012, collecting 46 caps which culminated in suiting up at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nArchibald sadly took his own life at the age of 39.\n\nSteve Bucknall\n\nThe first British-developed player to make the NBA, Steve Bucknall suited up for the Lakers during the 1989-90 season.\n\nOriginally coming through the Crystal Palace programme, Bucknall went to the US for High School at Governer’s Academy before heading to college to play under the legendary Dean Smith.\n\nFollowing a successful college career at the University of North Carolina, the 6’6″ 215 lbs shooting guard went undrafted in 1989, but hooked on with the Lakers during training camp.\n\nHe made 18 appearances during the season, averaging 1.3 points in 4.2 minutes per game.\n\nHe returned to the UK to play for Sunderland the following season before a successful career both domestically and in Europe before retiring in 2007, as his rookie season was his only year with the league.\n\nLuol Deng\n\nThe UK’s greatest ever player, Luol Deng was a two-time NBA All-Star and by far the most successful Brit in the NBA.\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the Duke for a single season, Deng was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2004 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick, where he was swiftly traded to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nHe was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team as a 19-year-old in 2005, was an All-Star with the Bulls in 2012 and 2013 before splitting the 2013–14 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers. After just half a season with Cleveland, Deng joined the Miami Heat for 2014–15. He played two seasons for the Heat before signing with the Lakers in 2016. He spent his last season with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nHe made 902 appearances over his career, with career averages of 14.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1 steal per game.\n\nOn 17 October 2019 Deng signed a one-day contract to retire with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nTosan Evbuomwan\n\nTosan Evbuomwan is the most recent British player to make the NBA.\n\nHailing from Newcastle, the former Newcastle Eagle went undrafted in the 2023 NBA Draft following his collegiate career at Princeton, where he was named the 2021-22 Ivy League Player of the Year as a junior and went on a fairy tale March Madness run in his Senior year.\n\nHowever, after impressing with NBA G League’s Motor City Cruise, appearing in 29 Showcase Cup and regular season games (27 starts) averaging 15.1 points, 8.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists on 57% shooting, he got a 10-day contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nEvbuomwan played 18.5 minutes over four game with the Grizzlies on a hardship 10-day contract. He averaged 2.5 points and 3.5 rebounds, including a 12-rebound outing against Boston, and then got a 10-day contract with Detroit.\n\nHe did enough on his 10-day with the Pistons to then get signed to a two-way contract.\n\nJoel Freeland\n\nThe only other Brit to play in the NBA in the 2010s outside of Luol Deng, Joel Freeland held a three-year deal with the Portland Trailblazers from 2012-2015.\n\nOn 28 June 2006, he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 2006 NBA Draft as the 30th overall draft pick, however, he opted to stay in Europe to improve his game, becoming one of the premier big men on the continent with Unicaja Malaga in the ACB and Euroleague.\n\nDespite a rocky road to his NBA career, being assigned to the Idaho Stampede of the NBA D-League in December of his rookie season, he soon found a rhythm, working his way into the rotation.\n\nHe had a career-high of 17 rebounds in December of 2014, and a career-high 16 points against Oklahoma City Thunder in April of 2015.\n\nIn 151 appearances in the NBA, Freeland averaged 3.2 points and 3.4 rebounds in 12.1 minutes per game.\n\nOn 13 July 2015, Freeland signed a two-year contract with the Russian club CSKA Moscow, where he won a Euroleague title in 2016, was a two time VTB United League champion and rounded out his playing career in 2017.\n\nPops Mensah-Bonsu\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2006 NBA draft, he joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2006 NBA Summer League before signing with them for his rookie year.\n\nDuring his rookie season, he had multiple assignments with the Fort Worth Flyers of the NBA Development League. In the 2006–07 season, he managed just 12 games for the Mavericks, averaging 2.4 points and 1.8 rebounds in 5.9 minutes per game, and was waived in July of 2007.\n\nAfter a stint in Europe, he managed a return to the league with San Antonio in 2009 on a 10-day contract after impressing with their D-League squad Austin Toros. Two days after his 10-day contract with the Spurs was up, he signed with the Toronto Raptors for the rest of the 2008–09 season where he had his most productive stint in the league, averaging over 5 points and 5 rebounds in just 13.8 minutes per game in 19 appearances.\n\nIn August 2009, Mensah-Bonsu signed with the Houston Rockets but was waived in November after playing just four games.Four days later, he was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Raptors, where he remained until January 2010 when he was released and signed in Europe.\n\nHis final stint in the NBA was the 2010-11 season with the New Orleans Hornets where he played until being waived in early January of 2011.\n\nPops made 61 total appearances in the NBA, with career averages of 3 points, and 3 rebounds per game.\n\nMensah-Bonsu earned 40 international caps for the Great Britain Men’s National Team between 2008 and 2012. He averaged 15.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game during his international career and recorded 14 double-doubles including a career best 32 points and 21 rebounds against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 26 August 2010.\n\nMichael Olowakandi\n\nDespite being born in Nigeria, Olowakandi moved to England when he was 4 years old and was raised here; he didn’t start playing basketball properly until he was 18 years old (despite being a 6′8″ sixteen year old!).\n\nAged 20 and at Brunel University in West London, he decided this was his last opportunity to chase dreams of professional basketball. He went to the library, pulled out a directory called Peterson’s a guide to four year American colleges and opened it up – it opened to Pacific.\n\nHe called them, explained he was 7′1″ and wanted to play basketball and the rest, as they say, is history.
