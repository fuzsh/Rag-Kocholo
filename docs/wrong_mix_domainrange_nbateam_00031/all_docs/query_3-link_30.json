        "text": "Free agent guard Ben Gordon and the Orlando Magic have agreed to terms on a two-year, $9 million contract, reports Yahoo Sports. The second year of the contract will reportedly be a team option, according to CBS Sports.\n\nThe amount of money Gordon signed for comes as something of a surprise because of how far Gordon's career has fallen after signs of early stardom with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nAfter averaging 18.5 points per game with the Bulls in his first five seasons, including winning the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in his rookie year in 2004-05, Gordon signed a five-year, $55 million contract with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nBut Gordon's play suffered in Detroit, as his scoring average fell to 12.4 points over three years with the Pistons. That led the team to trade him to the Charlotte Bobcats in 2012, where Gordon quickly fell out of favor due to his disruptive behavior and conflicts with coaches.\n\nMORE NBA: NBA free agency tracker | Top 25 NBA free agents\n\nThe Bobcats tried to buy out Gordon's contract and trade him at various points over his Charlotte tenure, eventually waiving him in March, the timing of which made Gordon ineligible for the playoff roster of a potential new team.\n\nLast season, Bobcats coach Steve Clifford played Gordon in just 19 games before he was waived, only three of which came after December. All told, Gordon averaged 5.2 points in 14.7 minutes per game in his limited action.\n\nGordon joins a Magic team in full rebuilding mode. Orlando went 23-59 last season, recently selecting Arizona's Aaron Gordon with the No. 4 pick in the NBA Draft and acquiring guard Elfrid Payton from Louisiana-Lafayette in a draft-day deal with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nâ€”Ben Estes"
