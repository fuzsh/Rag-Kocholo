        "text": "Former NBA player Drew Gordon has died at the age of 33 after being killed in a car crash in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday.\n\nGordonâ€™s agent confirmed the news about the former UCLA and New Mexico forward.\n\nGordon was a high school star at Archbishop Mitty in San Jose, California, before heading to play for Ben Howland at UCLA. Gordon played two seasons at UCLA before transferring to New Mexico, where he became a standout player.\n\nGordon averaged 13.4 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in his two seasons at New Mexico. He was a second-team all-conference selection as a junior and first-team All-Mountain West player as a senior.\n\nGordon went undrafted in 2012 and began his professional career in Europe. He eventually caught on with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014-15 and played nine games with them. That was his lone NBA action.\n\nGordon continued to play professionally through 2022-23, playing mostly in Europe but also in Asia. He was a French League All-Star in 2016 and Russian League All-Star in 2018.\n\nGordon was the older brother of Denver Nuggets big man Aaron Gordon."
