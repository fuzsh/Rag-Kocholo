        "text": "Approved For Release 2004/10/ Cl R 88-6fRQ_0Q2HU0007-7 `stimulating awareness t is ~-iare part of a broader world society' Fifty-one years ago, in 1922, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations was founded with the purpose of edu- cating people in the Midwest on foreign affairs. On June 22, 1973, the Council formally celebrated its 50th anniversary with a dinner at the Palmer House featuring an address by Secretary of the Treasury George P. Shultz. Through the years, the Council has played an increasingly important role in stimulating awareness that Ameri- cans are part of a broader world society and in insuring that, whatever the climate of opinion of the moment, the question of the proper role of the United States in the world would receive a full hearing. As part of its mission during the last three decades, the Council also helped educate leaders who have occupied important positions in American public life. Men from Chicago have gone out to help lead the nation and have left their impact on international affairs-men such as Frank Knox, Adlai Stevenson, Sargent Shriver, William McCormick Blair, David Kennedy, George Shultz, Peter G. Peterson, Charles H. Percy, Adlai Stevenson III, Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Ingersoll. Now, in the 1970s, the Council has an opportunity to play a new role by pro- viding an institutional means through which the leadership of the city and surrounding areas can take part in the shaping of United States foreign policy. With few exceptions, most Chicago institutions have traditionally been regional or national in scope, rather than international During the course of National commercial and financial institutions have become international; some multinational corporations, once located principally on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, are now headquartered in Chicago. Institutional involvement, as distinct from personal participation, is a relatively recent thing. The number of people who are today professionally engaged in international activity in Chicago is many times greater than a decade ago. In the coming decade the Council will give considerable attention to making the voice of this community fully felt in the national foreign policy process. In accepting the position of Executive Director in 1971, I remarked that the decade of the 1970s has seen the emergence of international economic issues as central foreign policy con- cerns. With the phenomenal growth of Japan and the emergence of a strong Europe, U.S. attention has necessarily begun to focus on these issues. Therefore, during the past two years, priority consideration in the substan- tive work of the Council's program has been given to questions of international economic policy. Three separate seminar series over a two-year period have focused on various aspects of this broad subject--one on U.S. relations with Japan, another on Europe and a third on Canada. In November, 1972, an international conference (the Atlantic Conference) was devoted to interna- tional economic policy as it applies to Europe, North America and Latin America. In view of the position which the city of Chicago now plays in the international economic life of our country, it is important that the Council continue to devote considerable resources to examining America's international economic posture. At the same time, there are other criti- cal issues we cannot ignore. Perhaps the overriding question of American foreign policy today is that of redefining Amnrina'c nvarnll rnla in tha wnrlri place some limitation on our overseas aspirations, to restrict the exercise of American political and military power. But it is important that our memory extend beyond the last decade and our vision beyond the next. As we seek to redefine the international role which the United States will play for the remainder of the century, we should not entirely forget Gladstone's defense of a foreign policy based ultimately on moral imperatives. \"Good ends,\" he said, \"can rarely be attained in politics without passion.\" No doubt this is a dangerous doctrine placed in the wrong hands. But perhaps it i$ as necessary during a retrenchment as during an advance, as necessary in the pursuit of stability as in the pursuit of justice. The Council must continue to address this central issue. During the past decade, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations has become a large organization-its 22,000 members make it the largest private foreign policy institution in the country. Because the Council's membership is diverse, its program also must be diverse. For the past two years the Council has sought to broaden the services offered to its members. Because many Council members live in the suburbs rather than the city, we have developed an exten- sive suburban program, both on the North Shore and in the Western sub- urbs, a program which will be con- tinued. Second, because many of our members are first introduced to inter- national affairs through foreign travel, we have diversified the opportunities to travel abroad. We have added greatly to the substantive programs available to members before and during their over- seas visits. Third, we have strengthened our extensive secondary education pro- gram through more carefully focused efforts on teacher training, and by relating the program more closely to because or me airrlcunies expenenoeu with Dr. Gwendolen Carter, Council Vice the past decade this has in some of our foreign policy of the last President and Director of the Program of changed. hwestern Universi c r hLto e l ~ ' p ty.

We have strengthened our programs serving the leadership of the community through expanding the Chicago Committee's program and diversifying its membership. Fourth, in order to strengthen the Council's publication program, we have affiliated with a new quarterly. Foreign Policy, published in New York and Washington. We are promoting the widest possible circulation of this excellent journal in the Chicago area. It is available to Council members on special terms, and, as Executive Di- rector, I serve on the Editorial Board. We regard Foreign Policy an important outlet for serious foreign.policy writing stemming from Council programs. Finally, during the last two years, the Council's Board of Directors has been strengthened by the addition of execu- tives from the business and banking world, editors and publishers from Chita jo media and leading acade- mician sand university administrators. Since the Council does not have a residE nt research staff, we have tried to use more fully the resources of the major universities with which the Council has long enjoyed a close assoc ation-the University, of Chicago. North restern University and the Unite sity of Illinois. In addition, we have c eveloped regular cooperative ties w th other private foreign policy institues in this country and abroad which seek to reach influential segmf nts of the public interested in foreig i policy. These include the Carne lie Endowment for International Peace The Council on Foreign Rela- tions i i New York: the United Nations Assoc ation in New York; the Center for Int yr-American Relations; The Japan Society; The National Committee on 11.~ .-China Relations; The Aspen Institu e for Humanistic Studies; The Adlai Stevenson'nstitu-a and the Brookings Institution.

They do, however, give an idea of the range of the roughly 200 meetings per year the Council now conducts, plus various publications and a diverse travel program.

Shultz noted that never before had the economy of the United States been tied so closely to the world economy, a rela- tionship that had become pronounced during the first six months of 1973. He pointed out that world-wide anti- inflationary efforts were producing a closer economic relationship between the United States and other nations. One result of this was the recently concluded agreements between Presi- dent Nixon and Soviet Communist Party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. \"A Soviet-American detente is an ab- solutely necessary condition for greater economic development,\" said Shultz. Shultz's remarks provided the highlight of an evening which brought together former presidents of the Council; former Executive Directors Louise Leonard Wright and Clifton Utley; rep- resentatives of Chicago's consular 1.

The real question is whether the U.S. and Japan can, in spite of growing economic competition, find a modus vivendi which will allow us to compete creatively and avoid a confrontation which would have serious conse- quences for both sides-and for the world. In meeting the many questions posed by the emergence of an economically powerful Japan, the Council has spon- sored seminars for businessmen, bankers, journalists, academicians and teachers; through the Council Forum reached out to its younger members; and, by developing a close working relationship with the Japanese Con- sulate and Japan Trade Center, pro- vided a vehicle for intelligent transmission of ideas. is about to become \"Number Two.\" The last scene in America's military venture in Vietnam is being played out, leaving Japan at the critical hub of East Asia- the hub of an economic wheel. China, meanwhile, has joined the complex geometry of great nations, and raised new questions ... problems ... oppor- tunities for Russians, Americans and Japanese. Can we work with Japan? Perhaps not, if we keep the old standards of world power-power based on military might. Perhaps not, if our economic interests in East Asia and elsewhere conflict with Japan's-if problems of trade, monetary reform and energy lead to a diplomacy of mutual suspicion. But perhaps we in the United States can work with Japan-if we both accept the emerging rules of the new security -economic security-in the game of great powers. Perhaps we can-if the end of Indochina does not mean the end of U.S. interest in the economic fortunes of East Asian trade ... invest- ment ... development. Perhaps we can, if the China craze does not blur the giant form of Japan in Asia-and the Can the United States work with Japan in Asia? Ten years ago, this question would have been ridiculous. The United States was the world's unchallenged economic superpower and had just weathered a test of wills with the Soviet Union in Cuba. Japan's security was bound up with America's, while China sulked in isolation-part self-imposed, part thrust upon it. Japan's economic miracle was only just beginning, and Vietnam was still a name that most Americans mispronounced. Today, Asia has entered a new era, dominated by economics. Nuclear treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union have reduced fears of war generally in the world and, with them, reduced dependence of Japan and other countries on the United States for military security against Moscow. Japan has climbed in the economic ranks, \"Trying Harder,\" and world.

It is the for- gotten member of the Atlantic Alliance; the forgotten market for one-third of all U.S. exports; the forgotten center of decision on the use of its own natural resources. Why not forget? What choice does Canada have but to depend on the United States? Perhaps the range of that choice is small, but it does exist. It exists far beyond the point of meriting for Canada only a passive role in slogans of \"friendship\" ..... partner- ship\" ... \"community.\" The United States' ability to act on the basis of \"Continental ism\" is fading fast. Cultural reaction is growing in both English and French Canada. The politi- cal climate of U.S.-Canadian relations has progressively gone sour in recent years, especially as our economic problems-and some heavyhandedness -have had their impact on Canadian jobs, prices and prosperity. And the idea of a \"continental energy policy,\" with Canada a passive partner, is as anathema north of the border. Our increasing need for Canadian energy, water and export markets- along with opposition to U.S. control of Canada's industries and to possible pollution of its lands by U.S. oil pipe- lines-argue for different attitudes and different relations. These changes are possible, but they are not yet in prospect. Yet here, too, the decline in U.S. economic fortunes relative to other rich Western states is posing new demands that may not be to our liking, but which must still be met. 1.

The old Heartland ... a political and cultural expression ... the center of (once great) confrontation ... a growing economic force, in both West and East ... the newest New World ... and more. The Atlantic World is swept by the same currents of change that in Asia are moving U.S. relations with Japan. \"Equal\" becomes perforce a more important word than \"Partnership\" in the old cliche.

Security here, too, takes on an economic meaning, because of success and new concerns. Success (and at the summit) in the control of arms and conflict means less worry about the institutions of a military era. European economic power means new concerns for the institutions of trade, monetary relations, and the broader, working community of economic interests. The Atlantic Alliance of the 1940s and '50s is near the end of its Cold War purpose. Tomorrow, that Alliance-and the community it has expressed-will die unless their purpose and methods can change as well. For the United States, troops abroad have let us remain aloof from real involvement in the outside world; yet today economic challenge is bringing that world into the lives of all Americans. Old attitudes and relations must die with the Almighty Dollar; a narrow focus on NATO must go the way of tensions that preceded detente; and the monopoly of American decision-and leadership -must end with the birth of West European pride and effort and a fledgling unity. 1.

This pri- vate, international conference series, originally initiated in 1965 by Joseph Slater at the Ford Foundation, moved to the Chicago Council in the autumn of 1971. The 1972 meeting, held in Macuto, Venezuela, brought together 50 leaders from the three continents for a private, off-the-record discussion of the sub- ject, \"International Economic Policy: Europe, North Ame -ica and Latin America.\" By 1972, internatioral economic issues had become amonc the most divisive in the foreign policies of Western nations. The measures taken by the Nixon administratic n in August, 1971, followed by the Smithsonian agree- ment, focused attention on the funda- mental re-alignment that has taken place in world commercial and financial arrangements. Wei before the devalu- ation of the dollar in February, 1973, international econcmic policy had moved to the front rank of American foreign policy issues. As a result. the discussion at the 1972 Atlantic Con- ference centered on three themes: revision of the internatioral economic system, growth of tie multinational corporation, and the search for devel- opment by Latin Arierican nations. The Atlantic Conference meetings focus on the common problems of the Western World shirred by the three continents. The title of the series, \"Atlantic Conference,\" is designed to emphasize that those are meetings of leaders from the rr ajor nations of the Western World. nct simply the United States and Europe, or the United States and Latin America. The conference meets every two years and discusses a specific subject of special relevance to all three continents.

I n the city ...and suburbs In recognition of the fact that a signifi- cantproportion of the Council member- shipnow lives in the suburbs, in 1971 the Program Department initiated a series of meetings designed to serve the needs of the North Shore and the Western suburban areas. In a highly successful series on, \"Neo- Isolationism:Myth or Reality,\" the Council closely examined a central problem in contemporary America and brought Senator Thomas Eagleton, The Honorable George Ball and Professor Robert Tucker of Johns Hopkins to the North Shore, where, over the course of three discussions, some 600 members heard the issues debated. In the Western suburb of Oak Brook the Council cooperated with The University of Illinois and The League of Women Voters in athree-part analysis of, \"The Limits of Intervention.\" This series featured a debate between then Presi- dential candidate Congressman Paul N. McCloskey, Jr., and Senator Gale McGee, and lectures by Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski of Columbia University and Senator Jacob Javits. Audiences of 1,000 attended these discussions. In addition to serial programming, the Council has also sponsored a number of evening lectures in the suburbs where notables such as Senator William Proxmire, Clovis Maksoud of A/ Ahram of Cairo, Senator Robert Dole and cor- respondent Mark Gayn met for discus- sions of the Mid-East, China and the allocation of defense expenditures.

Nine schools were represented at the Indonesian seminar, ranging geo- graphicallyfrom Madison, Wisconsin, to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and including Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois and Knox College. Four representatives of the Center for Strategic International Studies in Jakarta presented papers and engaged the 28 participants in a full-day discussion of Indonesia's role in Southeast Asia. Additionally, the Council co-sponsors foreign affairs courses with the Uni- versity of Chicago extension program and with the City Colleges of Chicago. In this latter connection, working with the Loop College, the Council has offered its members opportunities to study contemporary Mexico, Southeast Asia and most recently the sources of Irish nationalism. Altogether, the Council's work with Chicago's colleges and universities is a two-way street, where the Council draws on the intellectual resources of the schools and at the same time provides the professors and students of the Midwest an opportunity to meet in small sessions with many of the distinguished visitors who come to the city as guests of the Council. 1.

To some young people this represents a backpack and a carefree trip through Europe via hostels. To others it means a present from parents, a chance to explore the world's marketplaces and build up a sizable slide collection; but, to the 11 students who participated in the Council's \"Young Ambassador\" pro- gram this year, it spelled an unusual experience. As Young Ambassadors, the students spent the summer with a foreign family experiencing first hand the lifestyle and culture of another nation. The Chicago Council on Foreign Rela- tions, working jointly with the American Field Service and local community organizations, has been able to send 55 students abroad since the Young Ambassador program originated in 1969. The first delegation sent by the Council spent the summer in Norway and since then travels have extended as far as Australia, Brazil. Argentina and throughout Europe. Typical of the Young Ambassadors is Mary Tudela. While parades and fire- workdisplays proclaimed the Fourth of July 1971 across the United States, Mary celebrated with her German family, who gave a party in her honor. A student from Chicago's Wells High School, Mary spent the summer in Neukerchen, Germany. She was sponsored by Emerson House. Now a sophomore at the University oI Illinois, Mary hopes to spend her junior year abroad in Barcelona. A Spanish and pre-law major, she spends her spare time singing with the university choir and working at the local Boys' Club. \"Sharing my family's day-to-day life was a beautiful experience,\" Mary explains. \"Not only did I grow to know and love them, but I was also able to grasp an understanding of the German people and their culture ...and knowing people that way makes 4,000 miles seem like next door.\" t The 1972 edition of the Young Ambas- sadors against a Chicago backdrop. 2 Program Associate of the Council Irene Approved For Release 2004/10/13 :CIA-RDP88-01315~~~~''~h1r,~l7r,~Se4iarives of Emerson New direc~ionsr in apu?~~1iCA~I~~~-013158000200110007-7 Through its monthly publication, World Events, and through an affiliation with the new quarterly, Foreign Policy, the Council offers members additional opportunities to obtain information and informed analysis on U.S. foreign policy. In addition, the Council pub- lishes papers which result from its conferences and study groups, such as the Atlantic Conference papers published in 1973. Founded on April 29,1925, the first edition of World Events (it was then called News Bulletin) featured stories on Henri Poincare's government in France and on \"The Agile Benes\" and his recently concluded agreement with Poland; turned to the concerns of President Calles of Mexico; and con- cluded by noting with trepidation that Field Marshall von Hindenberg had been elected President of the German Republic. Such was the world of 1925. In the 1930s, under Clifton Utley, then Executive Director, it became the principal source of analysis of news in the Midwest.

The Council's affiliation with Foreign Policy dates from December,1972. Executive Director John E. Rielly serves on the editorial board of the magazine, and Council members may subscribe under special arrangements. The journal offers an outlet for serious essays emanating from Council programs. As part of its arrangement with Foreign Policy, the Council inaugurated a special series of meetings called \"The Author Meets His Chicago Critics,\" which brings authors of articles in the magazine to Chicago for discussions of their work. On January 10, 1973, some 500 members turned out to hear Lincoln Bloomfield of M.I.T. discuss \"A Foreign Policy for Disillusioned Liberals,\" and on March 20, 1973, over 800 were on hand for David Halberstam's analysis of The Best and the Brightest. Meanwhile, the Japan Trade Center saluted the Council on its 50th anni- versaryand published an article drawn from the papers of the Council's seminar on the Japanese economy in the spring, 1972, issue of U.S./Japan Outlook. The Atlantic Conference papers, published following the meeting at Macuto, Venezuela in November, 1972, appeared under the title, International Economic Policy: Europe, Latin America and the United States.

Attention properly has focused upon many of the accomplishments of those first 50 years, and in various ways recognition was given to the key people who were essential in the building of the Council. That attention and the related recognition were certainly well deserved. In reviewing the last two years, how- ever, Inote aninteresting parallel in the growth of the Council relative to the importance of international develop- ments to the Chicago metropolitan area. To be sure, since the 1950s, Chicago has become an international center in many ways. Commercial, academic, intellectual, and just plain personal interests in other areas of the world now exist among the people in this area. The opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the late 1950s was perhaps the most dramatic symbol of the developments then taking place. But for all that the period 1971-1973 marked a particularly sharp rise of Chicago-area involvement in the world of business and international trade. At the Council's annual meeting in 1971, Peter G. Peterson, then the Special Assistant to the President for Interna- tional Economic Affairs, told us that foreign affairs issues of the 1970s would be economic issues. Many such issues have surfaced in the intervening two years, including problems with the monetary system and future interna- tionaltrading arrangements. Such problems represent serious issues with no obvious solutions in sight. Those new internati~~nal problems which have surfaced to date seem to be only the tip of an iceberg of completely new and different foreign affairs questions. It seems likely the future will hold other completely different problems. if the ov. Hers of such funds choose to make s~ ch an effort. Both the United States and Japanese governn ents are encouraging Japa- nese im =stments of their surplus funds in United States investments. Recently Prime N' nister Tanaka of Japan announc ed that Japan would give $10,000. )00 to United States universi- ties tc f~ rther Japanese studies. In a revE rsal of past trends, recently there ha re been takeover bids made by EuroFe< n companies for United States busines es. It is entirely possible that in not too r iany years we may well have multirat onal activity by labor unions on a levc I commensurate with that of large ,nt ~rnational companies in operatic ~ today. As such jevelopments take place, they will crea e new and different problems. We of th ~ Council can and should play leading ~ oles during the future decades in develc ping new thinking geared to resolving such future foreign policy problem ~. As we have responded to some of he new economic issues durinc ti e past two years through special ~ =minars and new programs, we must 31so respond in new and different ways to the questions of the future I now that the Council will do its best t ~ meet the challenges of the future wi h the same energy. enthusi- asm and confidence which it has shown in meetir g the challenges of the past.

The history of the founding and develop- ment ofthe Chicago Council on Foreign Relations has been recorded in other places, most notably in our 40th anni- versary book, so I need not repeat it here. But as we plan for the years to come, we cannot forget that it is through the hard work and untiring efforts of many people that 50 years after its founding we at the Council look forward to a bright and productive future. The last two years have been marked by many advances in programming: a strengthening of the publications pro- gram, atightening of the administra- tion of the Council and a continuation of a strong financial position.The Board has been significantly strengthened by the addition of new members. In the years to come we look forward to implementing the many ideas which come from our Board members, the committees of the Board and our talented professional staff. I am honored to have been chosen the 26th President of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.
