Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 March 11, 1982 Major Developments in Soviet Propaganda Soviets today are making a worldwide effort to sway public opinion in their favor and against the U.S. They have committed sizable human and material resources to this endeavor. While this activity has continued over many years, there are signif- icant current developments, including: o Soviet external radio broadcasting has increased dramatically in recent years. For example, their total of 2,094 hours per week in 1980--an increase of 75 hours per week over 1979-- reflects the largest single jump in annual broadcasting in over ten years. Radio Moscow World Service in English has been on the air 24 hours a day since 1980. o Soviet publishing for export has increased-substantially in recent years. For example, the number of book and pamphlet titles for export rose by almost 10 per cent between 1977 and 1979 (from roughly 2,280 to 2,495 titles) and the number of copies of books and pamphlets for export rose by 16 percent in the same period (from 56,849,200 to 61,396,800 copies). o Soviet propagandists have increasingly ex loited Western media, particularly television. In 1981 Soviet official spokes- men \"blitzed\" American TV with a series of appearances on major 10 public affairs programs. They justified Soviet international behavior, condemned U.S. activities worldwide, and promoted major Soviet propaganda themes. Because no reciprocity exists for Americans on Soviet TV, the U.S. must increase its efforts in other ways to counter this Soviet advantage in media access. Major Themes in Soviet Propaganda ? These themes change very little over time. Soviet propagandists adapt their basic line to fit current needs: -- The U.S. aims to establish military superiority over the USSR and by use of arms or the threat of force seeks to achieve global hegemony for itself and world imperialism. (Used to condemn Reagan budget with emphasis on defense) -- The U.S. (and its NATO puppets) is unwilling to engage in meaningful arms control/reduction talks with the USSR. (Used to separate the U.S. and its allies over INF) -- The U.S. interferes in the internal affairs of other nations. (Used to condemn U.S. sanctions against Poland and the USSR, to describe the situation in Afghanistan, and to criticize U.S. policy toward the Middle East) -- The USSR is the leading force for peace and liberation in the world. (Used to justify fomenting revolutions) Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 2 ? -- The USSR is committed to support national liberation move- ments. (Used to justify Soviet interference in places such as the Caribbean, Angola, Southeast Asia, and to overcome U.S. objections to such actions) -- The U.S. is anti-Soviet in all its policies. (Used to con- demn an alleged U.S.-PRC alliance and American arming of the Chinese.) -- The CIA is plotting covert actions around the world to sub- vert legitimate Marxist and leftist governments. (Used with respect to Nicaragua, Cuba, Poland, African states) -- The U.S. is a racist, exploitative, corrupt society. Its economy is in very bad shape, with the poor and minorities bearing the worst burdens of these difficulties. Major Techniques of Soviet Propaganda While Soviet propaganda techniques are many and varied, the most important are: Indirection ? Soviet propagandists take quotations out of context, cite sources inaccurately, misuse legitimate Western reporting, and \"plant\" pro- Soviet information--all to lend credence and support to their own views. Diversion Soviets blunt attacks on the USSR by diverting attention from their misdeeds, often through absurd/false charges aimed at the U.S. Fanning Resentment An essential purpose of Soviet propaganda is to incite social unrest and to play up traditional resentments with the expectation that, in conditions of social disorganization, Communists will more easily be able to take power. Disinformation By spreading lies, forgeries, and other forms of false information--in their own media and through the Soviet-sympathetic media of other nations--the USSR tries to sway world public opinion against the U.S. ?

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT From: Alexander M. Haig, Jr. Charles z. Wick COt-IUtI\\ t , , Subject: Initiative To Set the Stage for Your Trip to Europe We face a major problem in Europe with the among young people there to blur the disti.nctionrbetweenedemocratic and communist societies. Your personal involvement would be. extremely helpful in addressing this problem. We suggest that on the eve of your trip to Europe you announce a new Atlantic Youth Fellowship exchange program -- a 5 year initiative aimed at substantially increasing the present level of exchanges between American and European 17-19 year olds. This program would mark the first time the USG has focused on exchanges for this age group. This effort would begin the urgent task of building a new fabric of relations among the next generation of Americans and Europeans to help replace the old fabric of ties that are fast disintegrating. Increased contact and communication between American and European young people would improve their ability to recognize that what we share is far more important than the issue's dividing us. These exchanges would focus on our mutual accomplishments -- intellectual, economic, security and political -- that have been nurtured by 35 years of peace and Western cooperation. They would help provide a vision of the future which gives youth a greater sense of having a stake in the democratic values we share. The 35th anniversary of the Marshall Plan and the 25th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, present an ideal context for you to reaffirm existing ties with the Allies and to launch this two-way initiative. We recommend that the White House announce a special meeting -- organized by ICA, State and the White House -- in May to examine how to best improve US-European ties. This meeting would include private and government leaders from both sides of the Atlantic. We would ask you to make brief remarks to kick off the meeting and announce our 5 year initiative for greater youth exchange. To avoid any appearance of American largesse being heaped on a hapless-Europe, the program should be a joint effort suppoted by government and private funds on both continents. If you approve this initiative, we will approach government y eaders Europe to shape their cosponsorship and coordinate private tplan's in announcement. This is especially important in Italy where we have already begun to lay the groundwork for a pilot project starting in September, which would significantly increase youth exchange between our two countries.

Announcing this initiative just prior to your departure would be an excellent scene-setter for your trip. By showing sensitivity to the problems of youth, it would help create a positive tone for your journey. Recommendations: 1. That you approve the Atlantic Youth Fellowship program, a new initiative for increased U.S.-European youth exchanges. Approve Disapprove 2. That you agree to a White House announcement, as soon as possible, for a May meeting to examine how to improve U.S.-European ties. Approve Disapprove 3.

D.C. 20547 March 3, 1982 MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT FROM : Charles Z. Wic Director SUBJECT : Reaching the Europeans Through Public Diplomacy During my travels in Europe I was. impressed by the progress made in gaining European public understanding of U.S. policies. However, we need to do more through public diplomacy. High on the list of European concerns are the arms race and the economy. All too often your words and other U.S. policy statements reach European audiences in distorted form after instant analy- sis by media commentators here and abroad. A significant exception was your November 18 speech on arms reduction for peace. That speech, which ICA satellited directly to Europe, told the Europeans exactly what they wanted to hear and met with near unanimous approval. Your upcoming trip to Europe presents opportuni- ties to add momentum to your peace initiative. The points you made on November 18, and others, need to be reiterated-to those Europeans who remain dubious, poorly informed and fearful about U.S. policies. At the same time, the importance of fostering and preserving unified Western actions in opposition to the repression in Poland and Afghanistan should be stressed. While building up an adequate Western defense against the Soviet threat, the United States must keep talking peace to reassure our Allies, muster support for our positions, and energize other Western governments to make better efforts in public diplomacy, especially with the suc- cessor generation.

RECOMMENDATION 1 INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PRINT AND TELEVISION CORRESPONDENTS FROM THE COUNTRIES YOU WILL VISIT. To set the scene for your trip and to reach Europeans directly without passing through the filter of media commentators, I recommend your granting here in Washington in mid-April a half- hour to forty-five minute interview to a group of four senior correspondents from Italy (I1 Tempo), Great Britain (The Economist), France (Le Monde) and the Federal Republic (Die Welt). The specific topics for discussion (the economy, arms control, the Atlantic Alliance, East-West relations and U.S. policy in Central America) should be agreed upon in advance. In addition it will be requested that each journalist submit his questions in advance. A second half-hour interview with senior tele- vision correspondents from the same countries should be taped for broadcast just prior to your trip. Each journalist's questions will be sub- mitted in advance. RECOMMENDATION 2 A MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH IN LONDON ON THE SUBJECT OF PEACE AND SHARED WESTERN VALUES. At an appropriate historical site in London you should deliver a major policy address on U.S.- European relations before a substantial and sym- pathetic audience. Such a major address, care- fully focused on two or three basic themes, would have great weight and resonance. CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 VVY1 1/I UIYl iF 1J (3) The timbre of your?voi?ce, the quality of your body movements in combination with an overall aura that you generate, communicates an inner warmth and sincerity which is truly confidence building. There is very little lost despite a simultaneous translation of your words and/or subtitles. Your speech would be televised live in the U.K. and throughout Europe. The overall theme for such an address should be our ardent desire and search for peace. While it is important to make the point about the need for adequate defense to guarantee peace, we must not lose ground to the Soviets, who hammer away at the peace theme while steadily and quietly beefing up their forces. The U.S. has, perhaps, spoken too loudly about the need for nuclear force modernization, defen- sive chemical weaponry and arms increases. The emphasis on arms has tended to drown out our peace-seeking voice, which is.the one the Europeans most want to hear. In this speech you might challenge the Soviets to a \"Race for Peace\" instead of a race for war. After all, the United States represents the real \"peace movement\". We seek to conquer no territory and are willing to discuss genuine arms control and reduction. For this \"Race for Peace\" to be effective, how- ever, the Soviets need to go beyond their empty rhetoric and begin to demonstrate more re- strained international conduct. They must not be permitted, through their propaganda, to undermine the sound and proven values uniting the free world. A second important theme is the bond of shared values which unites the Western democracies. Individual liberty and the freedom of self-ex- pression are cherished rights which we and our CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 Approved For Release 2008/06/24: CIA-RDP83M00914R002100110014-6 (4) forefathers earned through sacrifice and dedica- tion. Continued vigilance is required to pro- tect these rights, which we must not take for granted. At the same time we cannot stand mutely by when other people and nations, as close as Poland and Afghanistan and as far away as Kampuchea, struggle for their human rights and national independence. This theme would be particularly relevant to the \"successor genera- tion\" of Europeans who did not experience the carnage of World War II. RECOMMENDATION 3 TRIBUTE TO THE MARSHALL PLAN AND REMARKS ON THE NEED FOR JOINT EFFORTS TO OVERCOME OUR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. While in Paris on June 5, the 35th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, we recommend you visit the headquarters of the OECD, which is a direct and lasting outgrowth of the European Recovery Plan. This would be a highly appropriate site for positive remarks by you recalling joint European-American achievements under the Marshall Plan and stressing the need to rededi- cate ourselves to the principles of cooperation, hard work and determination in meeting the eco- nomic challenges of today. The mutual benefits which we and the Europeans derived from the Marshall Plan should serve as an example to us of the wisdom of joint endeav- ors by nations which share the same basic prin- ciples and love of freedom. This tribute to the Marshall Plan would serve two useful purposes. It would remind older Europeans of our successful common efforts to reconstruct war-torn Europe and inform younger Europeans about the post-war recovery period, an era with which many of them are unfamiliar.
