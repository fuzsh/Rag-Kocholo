He was 75 years old.\n\nA ceremony in memory of Mr. Barzini is scheduled to be held in Rome on Monday, after which his body will be buried in a family plot in Orvieto.\n\nPresident Sandro Pertini and Prime Minister Bettino Craxi headed a list of public figures who sent condolences.\n\nA Renaissance Man\n\nLuigi Barzini, an Italian-born, American-educated author, journalist and member of the Italian Parliament, was something of a latter-day Renaissance man.\n\nAn urbane, witty intellectual who covered political upheavals and wars in Germany, Ethiopia and China, Mr. Barzini had a long and distinguished career. In his youth, he at first embraced Mussolini's Fascism, but was soon disillusioned and was eventually imprisoned for his opposition to the regime.\n\nHis best-known book, ''The Italians,'' cemented his reputation as a leading authority on the history, culture and national character of the Italian people. Although it amused, delighted and enlightened millions of foreigners, many of Mr. Barzini's fellow Italians were offended by its often stinging criticism.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
