        "text": "The Man with\n\n​ a Famous Frown\n\n​\n\nparaphrasing and using language\n\n​from the BBC podcast above\n\nHe was a populist and nationalist, known for his jutting chin and perpetual frown. He had a keen sense of how to use the media to his advantage, and he was always looking for ways to project an image of strength and power. A journalist famously labeled him as \"neurotic, excitable, self-pitying, excessively blasphemous, vindictively vengeful, ill-dressed, and a sponger.\" According to many who knew him, he was in politics, not because he loved people, but for the power and adulation. He campaigned on a platform of making his nation great again, returning it to its old glory. I'm talking about Benito Mussolini (1883-1945), of course.\n\nMussolini initiated a campaign to Make Italy Great Again: that is, to enable it to return to the glory days of the Roman Empire. He began as a socialist but turned into a fascist, suppressing all political opposition. Some of his policies were quite good, including large public works projects such as the draining of marshes and the construction of highways. He also dramatically increased military spending. But over time he became more and more isolated, more and more certain that he was right, less and less able to listen to anyone who disagreed with him, and it drove him mad.\n\nMussolini led Italy into World War II on the wrong side, aligning with Nazi Germany in a disastrous decision. He admired the power of the Nazis, including their goose-stepping soldiers. \"I knew my friend Adolph Hitler would not desert me,\" he once said.\n\nHe was a womanizer. He had many mistresses, treating women as objects to be possessed and discarded when they were no longer useful to him. He bragged about dominating women and even about raping a woman. He stabbed one of hs girlfriends.\n\nHe was a powerful personality but not a likeable personality. A journalist famously labeled him as \"neurotic, excitable, self-pitying, excessively blasphemous, vindictively vengeful, ill-dressed, and a sponger.\" Beneath it all was an insecurity. He was plagued by self-doubt and constantly seeking validation, often interpreting even the slightest perceived insult as an offense and seeking revenge. He was determined to achieve retribution at any cost. His was a politics of power and resentment.\n\nMussolini's fascism was totalitarian. Many politicians curried favor with him and were complicit in his rise. If you became part of his movement you could not sit back and watch. You had to participate in it in an active way. You had to put the flags out, to give yourself to it, body and soul. In doing so you received his favor, and you could participate in the power, fueled by resentment and anger. You could help Make Italy Great Again.\n\n- Jay McDaniel\n\nMussolini's Life and Personality\n\n​\n\n​BBC Podcast\n\n\"September 1943, and German troops have just landed in gliders to rescue Benito Mussolini from the mountain resort where he was being held. “I knew my friend Adolf Hitler would not desert me,” he said later. But Mussolini died before the end of the war, shot and then strung up with his mistress in Milan.\n\nWho was this man, and is he still relevant today? Nominating him is Professor Margaret MacMillan, emeritus professor of History at the University of Toronto and an emeritus professor of International History at Oxford University, not as her hero but as someone she says must not be dismissed as a buffoon. Mussolini founded and led the fascists in Italy, was a brilliant propagandist, and would have probably died in his bed but for the war. Winston Churchill, speaking in 1927, told him his fascist movement \"has rendered a service to the entire world.\" Only later did he dub him the Italian Miscalculator. Mussolini declared war on Britain just as France was poised to fall.\n\nAs well as archive of Mussolini, Churchill, and the Italian journalist Luigi Barzini, the programme features Professor John Foot of Bristol University. Margaret MacMillan is the author of Peacemakers and a former BBC Reith lecturer. The programme is presented by Matthew Parris.\n\nThe producer in Bristol is Miles Warde\n\n​\n\n​"
