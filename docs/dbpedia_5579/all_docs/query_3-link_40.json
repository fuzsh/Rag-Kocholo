        "text": "“You who live safe in your warm houses”\n\nPrimo Levi\n\nFriday, January 27, from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm\n\nPUBLIC READING OF THE NAMES OF THE JEWS DEPORTED FROM ITALY\n\nConsulate General of Italy in New York\n\n690 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065\n\nOn January 27, on the occasion of the Giorno della Memoria (International Holocaust Remembrance Day), the Consulate General of Italy will host the traditional ceremony of the public reading of the names of the Jews deported from Italy and the territories under Italian control.\n\nThis initiative is part of a program of events promoted by the Consulate General, the Primo Levi Center, the Italian Cultural Institute, the Casa Italiana Zerilli Marimò at NYU, the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America at Columbia University, the Calandra Institute at CUNY, the Scuola d’Italia Guglielmo Marconi, the Center for Italian Modern Art (CIMA) and Magazzino Italian Art to commemorate the victims of the Shoah and preserve the memory of those tragic events.\n\nThe reading of the names is an open, outdoor event that will take place in front of the Italian Consulate (on Park Avenue, between 69th and 68th street). The public is invited to take part in the reading. Anyone interested can join the reading at any time during the\n\nceremony.\n\nPROGRAM DETAILS\n\nThursday, January 19, 6:00 pm\n\nA MAN OF LETTERS\n\nGiorgio Bassani in North America\n\nItalian Cultural Institute\n\n686 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065\n\nThe seminar will be introduced by professor Fabio Finotti, director of the Cultural Institute and by Paola Bassani, president of the Fondazione Giorgio Bassani. The editor of the volume, Anna Dolfi, will present the entire corpus of poems, ranging from 1945 to 1982 from which emerges – differently from his prose – a more autobiographical and intimate Bassani, one who looked at post-war Italy with a stern and watchful eye.\n\nIn the 1970s, Bassani came to the United States as Visiting Professor in the universities of Indiana and California and also went to Canada. There, he reworked the Romanzo di Ferrara and wrote some new poems for the volume, In gran segreto, some of which he defined as his “American Poems”.\n\nAlain Elkann will evoke his meetings with Giorgio Bassani in New York and the writer’s impressions on the United States and on American literature.\n\nValerio Cappozzo will discuss original materials from the correspondence between Bassani and the New York Times as well as with other journals published in New York, a city where Bassani’s work was and continues to be published.\n\nTo add to the seminar, there will also be an exhibition of documents made available by the Fondazione Giorgio Bassani, curated by Cappozzo with the collaboration of Gaia Litrico and Francesco Franchella. Autographs of letters and poems will be on display. Also on display for the first time, Bassani’s newly rediscovered translation of Hemingway’s Farewell to Arms, done in 1943, and considered lost until today: a work that opens new paths of inquiry on the relationship between the Ferrarese writer and US literature.\n\nSaturday, January 21, 12 noon\n\nPIOMBO\n\nMagazzino Italian Art\n\n2700 US-9, Cold Spring, NY 10516\n\nInspired by the work of Primo Levi, this rare performance of the legendary cellist Frances-Marie Uitti features the world premiere of Piombo (The Periodic Table) a solo work by Luciano Chessa.\n\nThe composer became fascinated with Levi’s journey in Nuragic Sardinia and the mines of Bacu Abis, a quasi-divinatory tale of labor and knowledge that unfolds as a counterpoint to Levi’s reflection on the “lager experiment”. The program also includes Quest[o], for\n\ncello, dan bau, and piano, anchored in Levi’s call to witness: “consider if this is a man”.\n\nTransportation and reservations: www.magazzino.art\n\nTuesday, January 24, 6:00 pm\n\nCRITICAL THINKING IN ACTION\n\nThe Political Writings of Eugenio Colorni\n\nJohn D. Calandra Italian American Institute, CUNY\n\n25 West 43rd Street (17th Floor), New York, NY 10036\n\nThis panel takes its title from the first volume in English of Eugenio Colorni’s writings and correspondence. Born in 1909, Colorni was a political philosopher and a teacher who entered the ranks of the anti-fascist movement. His analysis of the convergence of capitalistic interests, nationalism, and state violence, and his federalist ideas led to his incarceration at Ventotene and, in 1944, to his murder by Pietro Koch’s Fascist militia. Besides the renowned Manifesto di Ventotene, his writings have been, for the most part, published posthumously and translated into English by the Colorni-Hirschman International Institute (https://colornihirschman.org/). Panelists\n\ninclude Luca Meldolesi, Nicoletta Stame, Ernest Ialongo (Hostos, CUNY), Stanislao Pugliese (Hofstra University).\n\nReservations: www.calandrainstitute.org\n\nFriday, January 27\n\nA CONVERSATION WITH KATHARINA VON SCHNURBEIN (EUROPEAN COMMISSION)\n\non combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life\n\nItalian Academy for Advanced Studies in America, Columbia University\n\n1161 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027\n\nEurope and the United Nations commemorate the victims of the Shoah each winter on the date of Auschwitz’s liberation in 1945, and the Italian Academy marks Holocaust Remembrance Day annually with an exploration of issues of discrimination and crimes against humanity. Throughout the years, the Academy has broadened its focus to explore groups that were targeted in the racism and xenophobia of the Nazi and Fascist regimes, and that suffered and died along with the millions of Jews. Of particular concern recently is the wave of antisemitism, historical denialism, and misinformation, and the manipulating of social media to pursue neo-Nazi and neo-Fascist ideas.\n\nThis year the Academy presents a conversation between Barbara Faedda, the Academy’s Executive Director, and Katharina von Schnurbein, first European Commission Coordinator on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life.\n\nThe interview/conversation will be published on January 27, 2023\n\nTuesday, January 31, 6:30 pm\n\nTHREE MEMOIRS OF FIUME\n\nCasa Italiana Zerilli Marimò, NYU\n\n24 West 12th Street, New York, NY 10011\n\nAfter various attempts to seize the city, in 1924 Mussolini annexed Fiume. As a result, thousands of Fiumani who identified as Croatians, Slovene, Hungarians, etc., became victims of legislative, political, and physical persecution. Here, the first Fascist laboratory of ethnic cleansing took form. From the library and archive of Centro Primo Levi, we will read excerpts from the memoirs of Jewish women who grew up in Fiume and became victims of Fascist persecution: Cathy Lager, Andra and Tatiana Bucci, and Nora Tausz. Panelists include Dominique Kirchner Reill (University of Miami), Andra and Tatiana Bucci, Nora Tausz Ronai, Marcia Fink.\n\nReservations: www.casaitaliananyu.org\n\nWednesday, February 1, 5:30 pm\n\nWHEN THE PAST WAS PRESENT\n\nAn early representation of the deportation of the Jews of Rome\n\nCenter for Italian Modern Art\n\n421 Broome Street (4th floor), New York, NY 10013\n\nA group of scholars will discuss a little-known 1948 short film that appears to be one of the earliest public recollections of the deportation of the Jews of Rome, the exile, and the birth of the State of Israel. Director Romolo Marcellini and writer Luigi Barzini Jr. had flourishing careers under Fascism and transitioned to the post-war cultural industry. The context that originated this film is unknown. Undoubtedly, someone guided the director and the writer through the recent memories of Roman Jews. Someone who knew the story and the wounds; the streets, the places, and the religious rituals. Someone who helped mediate between the small Italian Jewish world brutally betrayed by its own country and a new republic that reluctantly had to come to terms with the sight of its recent past. Ruth Ben Ghiat (New York University), Alexander Stille (Columbia University), Raffaele Bedarida (Cooper Union), and Natalia Indrimi (Centro Primo Levi NY) will present the film and propose some hypotheses on its history and production."
