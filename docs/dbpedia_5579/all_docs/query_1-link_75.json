Introduction\n\nLike all social institutions, property rights are justified by the benefits they bring to individuals in society. The dominant understanding of this justification for all types of property has been an economic formula: property rights are the most efficient means to produce social wealth. Judges and commentators considering intellectual property have historically remained true to this formula; copyrights and patents are viewed as an ex ante incentive structure to produce the most social wealth at the least cost.\n\nThe same general justification - benefits brought to individuals in society - has given rise to discussions of the non-economic benefits of intellectual property. Property rights, it was observed, are a means to protect the personality interest or \"personhood\" of individuals; this seemed especially true with intellectual property rights that are draped over creations of the human mind. Along these lines, personhood proponents could understandably be found in the vanguard of \"moral rights\" for authors, \"reverse shop rights\" for inventors, and \"rights of publicity\" for everyone.\n\nWhile personhood theory challenged economics' prior monopoly on explanations of property, the \"pro-property\" personhood theory was itself met with a deconstructionist reply specific to intellectual property: that creators' rights to control intellectual property should be limited to permit non-owners to manipulate the communicative messages, shape their own messages, and, thereby, increase the personhood benefits that intellectual creations bring to those non-owners. This argument is akin to the consumer benefit side of economic analysis. It repeats the established formula with only slightly different formulation: the creator's personality interest in her work must be balanced against the [*82] personality interest of consumers - who will be further creators - using her work in their own acts of creation/expression. Along these lines it is argued that authors need greater liberty to quote existing texts, minority groups need greater liberty to manipulate existing cultural symbols (like celebrity images), and performing artists need more liberty to interpret theatrical works.\n\nThe interesting arguments in this area have obscured a deeper problem: we do not have a good grip on what constitutes the \"personality\" or \"personhood\" interests that may be present in a particular piece of intellectual property. We know that we can think about the \"personhood interest\" being held by one person, a few people (as in joint works), or, in the deconstructionist critique, in the multitude who are users, consumers, or the audience. We know that the personality interest may lead us into a highly subjective world, in which some proclaimed personality interests may strike us as illegitimate or unhealthy. n1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn1.

This article explores some of the interests which might live under the personhood tent. Drawing on a variety of problems, this article describes three identifiably separate personhood interests in an intellectual property res: n2 (1)creativity; (2) intentionality; and (3) identification as the source of the res. Without claiming that these three strands of personhood are exhaustive, I will explore areas of the law where these interests seem to influence and other areas where they do not, but perhaps should, hold weight.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn2. Res is everything that may form an object of rights and includes an object, subject-matter, or status.

App. Div. 1960).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nPartI describes the background for the search for \"personhood\" interests in property and then explores how much \"creativity\" - a fundamental notion in our copyright law - is a core personhood interest, that blurs the notions of originality and personal expression. But this does not mean that creativity occupies the same conceptual space as the idea of the individual \"author\" - an apparent assumption of some recent commentators. In fact, the notion of creativity comfortably co-exists with the idea of collaborative or co-created works. This article's discussion of creativity concludes by suggesting that the linkage of creativity to personal [*83] expression creates a generally unrecognized dilemma - one the legal system might solve by what I will call a \"moral shop right.\"\n\nAt the same time, one of the basic propositions of this article is that the notion of creativity, despite this complexity, does not explain all the personhood interests in an intellectual property res that may be worthy of protection. Indeed, too much attention on \"creativity\" has pushed other personhood interests into the background. The result is ad hoc reasoning by courts, catch-all phrases in statutes, n3 or efforts to shoehorn or redefine those interests into paradigms called, sometimes derisively, the \"Romantic genius\" and the \"inventor-hero.\" n4 A personhood theory of intellectual property needs to provide for the inventor-hero's creativity. However, it can also provide for the inventor who identifies with his improved widget only in the same way that his neighbor takes pride in a recently purchased sports car. This article proposes that we might improve on such phrases with two additional concepts for personhood interests: \"intentionality\" and \"sourcehood.\" Part II discusses \"intentionality,\" a significant personality interest, andarguably more important than creativity. PartII's discussion shows how the concept of intentionality can help us understand copyright's \"made-for-hire\" doctrine as well as the personhood interest of inventors, photo-journalists, and \"inadvertent\" creators - problems that have always seemed ill at ease with a creativity-based property justification.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn3. For example, one country's law grants copyrights to anthologies only if \"they are distinguishable by their originality, or their coordination or by any other personal effort justifying protection.\" Egyptian Copyright Law, Part I, Article 4(3), Law No. 354, June 24, 1954, as amended by Law No. 34, 6/17/75, art. 4 (emphasis added).\n\nn4.

L. Rev. 595 (1993).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFinally, Part III considers whether merely being the source of a res creates legitimate personhood interests that justify protection of some sort. For example, I propose that personhood interests can arise from simply being the human source of an intellectual property res. Examples might be true \"eureka\" discoveries or profoundly accidental intellectual products. That personhood interests may arise in such settings is not surprising, particularly to the extent that we believe, as David Gauthier suggests, that \"each person identifies with those capacities, physical and mental, to which he had direct access, and we see that this identification affords each person a normative sense of self....\" n5 An individual's per- [*84] sonal identification with all of her physical and mental capacities could give rise to personal identification with the intellectual products of those capacities - without any reference to what we would call \"creativity.\" n6 If an individual has a \"sense of self\" from her capacities, we should explore if and when the use of those capacities for intellectual production should lead to protectable personhood interests. n7 This \"sourcehood\" helps explain the personhood interests of inventors and suggests that in 1990 plaintiff Moore may have had a better case for rights over cells generated from his spleen than the California Supreme Court was willing to recognize in Moore v. University of California. n8\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn5. David Gauthier, Morals by Agreement 210 (1986).\n\nn6. Actually, we should imagine an intermediary step. If a person identifies with his or her own mental capacities, this may cause that person to identify, first, with the process of using those capacities and, second, with the products of those processes. It is conceivable that someone would identify with the process without identifying (as strongly) with the product.\n\nn7. Are personhood justifications compatible with the Copyright and Patent Clauses of the Constitution? The wording of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 (\"to promote the progress of science and the useful arts\") expresses an instrumental view of intellectual property law, a goal of \"stimulating original investigation whether in literature, science, or art, for the betterment of the people that they might be instructed and improved with respect to those subjects.\" Ansehl v. Puritan Pharm. Co., 61 F.2d 131, 133-34 (8th Cir. 1932). But this incentive structure may just as easily encompass, for example, moral rights as economic rights. Acknowledgment as an author or an inventor may be a critical incentive for lots of people.\n\nn8. 793 P.2d 479 (Cal. 1990).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThis discussion of creativity, intentionality, and sourcehood is a descriptive framework for better understanding the sentiments of creators and the educated classes from which they largely come and for whom they (partially) create. The question remains whether we should protect such interests. It may be wrong for people to (1)identify with their capacities; and then, (2)identify with the intellectual products of those capacities. Taking a cue from Rawls, we might believe that an individual does not have any particular entitlement to her talents, n9 jeopardizing any justification based on personality interests. Or we may question whether (2) is a legitimate move. To transpose Robert Nozick's classic query, why should we think putting our personality out into the world gives us rights to the things we create? Why should we not assume that [*85] when we mix our personality with the world, we lose part of our personality instead of gaining part of the world? n10 At another level, the discussion that follows is a mix of both descriptive and normative accounts of our legal system. For example, the proposal that intentionality helps explain the work-for-hire doctrine is: (1)a proposal that (descriptively) the concept is already at work in the thinking of courts and parties; and (2)a proposal that (normatively) we should bring the concept into the light of day to help make our conscious framework better fit our case law. This transiting between experience and logic, \"being and meaning,\" is a regular process of legal thinking. n11 Perhaps the transiting is so regular that we too often forget when we are trying to describe how the world is and when we are prescribing how the world should be.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn9. Assume that individuals identify with (1)their capacities; and, thereby (2)the processes of using those capacities; and, thereby, (3)the intellectual products of these processes. We might conclude, as John Rawls suggests, that step (1) is wrong, that the individual does not have any particular entitlement to identify with the talents with which she is endowed. Professor Rawls considers even the ability to expend effort to be determined by factors outside a person's control and hence a morally impermissible criterion for distribution. See John Rawls, A Theory of Justice 104 (1971) (\"The assertion that a man deserves the superior character that enables him to make the effort to cultivate his abilities is equally problematic; for his character depends in large part upon fortunate family and social circumstances for which he can claim no credit.\"); id. at312.\n\nn10. Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State and Utopia 174-75 (1974) (questioning why Locke thought \"mixing\" one's labor with the world gave that person property rights, instead of causing the person to lose the value of their labor).\n\nn11. As Professor Leff wrote, the law's life is \"an attempt to create and maintain a coherent species of 'logic' that would not too ridiculously fail to reflect, or even refract, experience. It has been, in short, an attempt to construct a legal system that accommodates the equally exigent demands of being and meaning, and to do so in a universe in which what a thing does is only one of the things that it means, everything that it means is something else that it does.\" Arthur Allen Leff, Law and, 87 Yale L.J. 989 (1978).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThroughout this article, the discussion has benefited from the thoughts and impressions of a variety of creators.

Priest concludes that there is, at present, an \"inability of economists to resolve the question of whether activity stimulated by the patent system or other forms of protection of intellectual property enhances or diminishes social welfare ...\" id. at 21, and that without empirical research \"economic analysis\" in this area is akin to \"applied moral philosophy.\" Id. at 22.\n\nn13.

Personhood Interests from Creativity, Originality, and Personal Expression\n\nIn her classic analysis of \"personhood\" in property, Margaret Jane Radin drew upon familiar material objects - a wedding ring, a portrait, a family home. When Radin describes how these objects become \"bound up with personhood,\" n14 we intuitively understand [*86] what she means. The individual probably had no role in the material object's design or creation; most of us neither designed nor constructed the houses, furniture, and clothes we live with. Nonetheless, we come to identify with these objects and they come to be imbued with our \"personhood.\"\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn14. Radin, supra note 1, at 959.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWith a wedding ring, an individual's personality seems to move into an existing object. Years ago, a husband and wife could have chosen a completely different set of rings but now the rings have great sentimental significance. In fact, our \"personhood\" may often be wrapped up in external objects we consider imperfect, inconvenient, or even ugly. The table inherited from Aunt May has an honored place in the home not because it is pretty, but because it is imbued with family history. n15 The same kind of identification can happen with intellectual property: a poem learned while young can become particularly important to the individual, a piece of music first heard on an important occasion can become imbued with personal meaning.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn15. Another possibility in the case of existing objects is that the personality does not \"move into\" the object so much as the object \"moves into\" the personality. Consider some of Milan Kundera's thoughts on personal development:\n\nThere are two methods of cultivating the uniqueness of the self: the method of addition and the method of subtraction. [One character] subtracts from herself everything that is exterior and borrowed ... [another character], she keeps adding to it more and more attributes and she attempts to identify herself with them .... This method of addition is quite charming if it involves adding to the self such things as a cat, a dog, roast pork, love of the sea or of cold showers. But the matter becomes less idyllic if a person decides to add love for communism, for the homeland, for Mussolini, for Catholicism or atheism, for fascism or antifascism.\n\nMilan Kundera, Immortality 100-01 (Peter Kussi trans., 1991).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nProfessor Radin gave us examples of situations where \"commodification,\" treating a physical res as fungible property, disrupts a personhood interest. For instance, a tenant may lose an apartment for market reasons - like increasing rent or a decision to redevelop the property - even though that tenant has greater personal identification with the apartment than the landlord. However, commodification of intellectual property does not engender the same disruptive separation of person from (personhood embodying) res. Intellectual creations are \"public goods\" in the economic sense. n16 They are \"non-excludable\" n17 in that once one has had some access to the intellectual property res, one can [*87] not be completely separated from it. If a person were deprived of all his music and books, he would have a great sense of personal loss, but yet would still know Satie's \"Gymnopedies\" by heart, would still remember much of Faulkner, and could still go to the library to read or listen to these favorites. n18\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn16. A \"public good\" is a good for which \"it is possible at no cost for additional persons to enjoy the same unit.\" Harold Demsetz, The Private Production of Public Goods, 13 J.L. & Econ. 293, 295 (1970). Put another way, the public good is subject to \"non-rivalrous consumption.\" Stephen L. Carter, Owning What Doesn't Exist, 13 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 99, 102 (1990). The sweep of a lighthouse beam is a public good that can be enjoyed by any and all ships along the coast; a clock atop city hall offers a public good - accurate information on the time - to all who pass nearby. The subjects of intellectual property are the prototypical public good; indeed, the lighthouse and the city hall clock are not far from intellectual property since the commonly shared public good is information.\n\nn17. Carter, supra note 16, at 102.\n\nn18. A distinction should be clear here: the difference between the intellectual property res and the particular, physical manifestation of that res. The copy of Lady Chatterly's Lover on my shelf belonged to my grandmother; it is that copy, not the novel, which has personal significance for me. Personhood interests in a physical object, whether a book or a wedding ring, were the subject of Radin's initial inquiries. While the intellectual propertyres is distinct from the object, it is also true that access to a poem, symphony, or fictional story is made much easier by owning physical objects. On that account, it might be noted, for example, that the bankruptcy laws of most states allow a bankrupt person to retain their home (often the greatest repository of personhood interests) and a dollar amount of personal effects; within that amount, the individual can choose the optimal personhood-preserving mix of family heirlooms, library, etc.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nOf course, commodification of intellectual property may, as with commodification of physical property, systemically prevent prospective personhood interests from developing. When Mr.Potter's ownership of all the buildings in town prevents Emily & Geoff from buying an affordable house in Pottersville, prospective personhood interests are frustrated. Similarly, when the high royalties demanded by authors keeps Curt from buying books (and curtails the library's acquisitions), Curt's prospective personhood interests are frustrated. He cannot identify with a book to which he is denied access.\n\nSo far this has been a discussion of personhood interests commonly linked to sentimental attachment or opportunity for personal growth. Intellectual property also brings to mind an intuitively different set of personhood interests. When we first encounter a res of intellectual property, instead of noting that an individual's personality has moved into an existing object, we may note that an individual's personality caused the object to come into existence. The object comes into the world already an embodiment or reflection of some particular individual. n19 So Delacroix called paintings \"a bridge linking the painter's mind with that of the viewer,\" Solzhenitsyn said that literature \"transmits incontrovertible condensed experience,\" and Thomas Jefferson called in- [*88] ventions \"the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain.\" n20 Armed with this belief about the nexus between the individual person and the intellectual product, we believe that rights to these intellectual products are desirable because \"they strengthen our sense of individuality.\" n21\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn19. Many physical objects also come into the world imbued with someone's personality, like a hand-built cabin or a hand-made Christmas wreath. But if we continue this line of thinking, the distinction between material property and intellectual property starts to blur because the material objects that most obviously come into the world imbued with personhood interests are also more likely to be objects of intellectual property laws, i.e., paintings or art pottery.\n\nn20.

For example, \"creativity\" is a characteristic we cultivate in our children, linking it intimately with their development as autonomous individuals. We look at nearly indistinguishable finger paintings, praise them as original, make posters of them, and imagine that one of these children will be a new Pollock. Throughout our culture, we link, if not blur, our notions of creativity, originality, and personal expression. This linkage occurs whether we are turning our attention to kindergarten finger-painting or Carnegie Hall performances; whether our critical faculty is focused on intensely original work - like Picasso's Les Desmoiselles d'Avignon when it was first viewed n22 - or on works whose subtle variations are appreciated only by a few. In some situations, a work's origin may cry out to the whole world. It does not take much familiarity with modern painting to recognize most of Picasso's work as Picasso or most of Miro's work as Miro. However, the identification of some specific work with some specific individual occurs with subtler expression, similar to a particular defensive play in a chess tournament, a solution to a computer programming problem, the juxtaposition of a certain painting with another at an exhibition, a particular style of lighting scenes in a film, n23 or even the layout of sand traps and [*89] greens on a golf course. n24 A few years ago, a foreign affairs article appeared in a scholarly journal attributed to \"Z\". The speculation about the author included numerous people claiming it read like Ambassador JeanJ. Kirkpatrick or Zbigniew Braezinski. n25 In these latter, subtle cases, we may search for some new terminology like \"critical judgment\" or \"intellectual insight.\" However, it is hard to deny that some sense of personal style is what lurks behind the terminology and, in turn, that this notion of \"style\" is some alloy of creativity and personal expression. n26\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn22.

One question is whether this linkage is inevitable or merely the result of historical accident; if the law developed at a time when these notions were culturally linked, although the cultural linkage might break down [*90] over time, the conceptual linkage in jurisprudence might continue.\n\nThis is the spirit of the deconstructionist's observations about the single \"author\" and the immutable \"text.\" The deconstructionists reason that the solitary author-genius is a creation of Romanticism that became embedded in American jurisprudence in the nineteenth century. Now, the argument continues, in a world of high technology and collaborative creative work, this construct needs to be replaced. There is much that is interesting, but also much that is dissatisfying about these deconstructionist observations. Assuming the \"author\" reflects the creative process of another time, the deconstructionists give us little real evidence of how our creative process is different. The evidence the deconstructionists do marshal is as much evidence of a benign, complex notion of creativity as it is evidence that the \"author\" lurks beneath intellectual property decisions. Instead of being a historical accident, there is good reason to think that the linkage between creativity, originality, and personal expression is both historically rooted and, at a deeper level, inevitable. That linkage, in turn, raises the issue of what I will tentatively call the \"moral shop right.\"\n\nA. The Romantic Author-Genius and the Place of Creativity\n\nIn recent years, critical legal studies imported the deconstructionist attack against \"authors\" and \"texts\" from French literary criticism. This wave of law review articles n29 has explored how copyright law developed with, and came to rely on the Romantic notion of creative authorship, \"an extreme assertion of the self and the value of the individual experience ... together with the infinite [*91] and the transcendental.\" n30 The \"author\" is seen as a historically contingent social construct that arose to capture the creative process in the nineteenth century and did not exist before that time. n31 In general, the deconstructionists view \"the persistent judicial reliance on author-reasoning as a method of resolving ambiguity and suppressing the complexity of the world.\" n32 In a tempered, wide-ranging presentation, Professor James Boyle has even argued that the author construct gets used in economic analyses of legal controls on information. n33\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn29.

But, the book she draws this inference from is an \"economic dictionary\" and all these professionals are held on a par as to their respective economic effect on \"this branch of manufacture.\" Id. This does not address the social place of \"the scholar and the writer.\" This would be the same as taking, as evidence of their similar social station today, a statement like \"book publishing is an X billion dollar business, providing jobs for authors, editors, graphics technicians, book store clerks, and lumberjacks.\" Would such a statement make you believe that we treat authors and lumberjacks on a par?\n\nn32.

Other times, sometimes breathlessly in the same article, the deconstructionist sees a resurgence of the individualistic Romantic author construct with destructive consequences for less typical sources of intellectual production. There is valuable work in this deconstructionist jurisprudence, but there are questions about both its picture of how the world is and its vision of how the world should be. n35\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn34.

Some deconstructionists also see the development of the \"work\" as a construct used to disempower authors. But the increasingly broad property protection engendered by the \"work\" construct is a mixed, often valuable, gift for authors. In early copyright cases, any concept of \"work\" was limited to the exact physical embodiment of the author's copy. This resulted in authors losing value at the hands of less creative market players. See, e.g., Stowe v. Thomas, 23 F. Cas. 201 (E.D. Pa. 1853) (holding that copyright of Uncle Tom's Cabin is not infringed by non-English translation); White-Smith Music Publ'g v.

Even if one believes in the possibility of private language, most ideas remain social constructs. If the point is that the individual author \"construct\" is out of synch with the times - for which we need a more collectivist paradigm of creative output - then three observations are in order.\n\nFirst, the case for this new descriptive account of the world has not been made (and it will be difficult to make). It is difficult to measure how much more collective and collaborative the creative process has become compared to the past. The evidence mustered seems about as convincing as Bertolt Brecht having himself photographed in the 1930s \"writing poetry in the midst of a crowd of workers to emphasize that the days of romantic political individualism were dead and poetry was now a collective proletarian activity.\" n36 On this point, the evidence assembled focuses on writing - particularly books, lectures, stories - without reference to closely related arts and activities. n37 For example, plays - collaborative efforts of playwrights, actors, set designers, and musicians n38 - have been a continuously vibrant part of both western and Japanese cultures for centuries. Renaissance frescoes were often collaborative works among similarly stationed individuals - as was the Brancacci Chapel in Florence by the painters Masaccio and Masolino. n39 There are also old literary traditions, western and eastern, of col- [*93] laborative writing, like the Japanese renga. n40\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn36. Paul Johnson, Intellectuals 178 (1988). The authors often overstate the situation. For example, Professor Margaret Chon in a thoughtful discussion of \"chain art\" and other collaborative projects on the Internet, recently commented that \"whether the work is an e-mail conversation or a serialized document, the individual-based notion of 'work' does not describe what is actually occurring in this new medium.\" Chon, supra note 29, at 271. But an \"e-mail conversation\" is not fundamentally different from a regular correspondence - a genre of historic publication that has flourished in the world of the \"author\" and \"work.\"\n\nn37. This is even true of many articles focusing on the Internet. See, e.g., Rebecca Tushnet, Legal Fictions: Copyright, Fan Fiction and a New Common Law, 17 Loy. L.A. Ent. L.J. 651 (1997). However, there is also a growing literature about \"collaborative\" images on the Net. See, e.g., Chon, supra note 29; Raphael Winick, Intellectual Property, Defamation and the Digital Alteration of Images, 21 Colum.-VLA J.L. & Arts 143 (1997).\n\nn38. For example, songwriting, in all its subgenres, had often been a collaborative venture, including the works of Elton John and Brian Tauper, David Bowie and Brian Eno, Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Jay Livingston and Ray Evans (winners of three Academy Awards and authors of compositions like Mona Lisa, Que Sera Sera, and Silver Bells). See Rachel Fischer, Piano Men, L.A. Times, Aug. 18, 1996 (Westside Weekly Supp.), at 1; See e.g., Patricia T. Perkens, \"Hey!

Pei and Antoine Predock have studios staffed with junior partners and assistants who do much of the work on the building commissions given to the named architect. n41 Arguably the most striking feature of Louis Kahn's greatest work - the Salk Institute in San Diego - was not originally Kahn's idea. n42 The deconstructionists are correct to note that even when learned critics focus on the works coming out of such studios, the analysis is intensely individualistic, e.g., \"what was Predock trying to achieve?\" or \"what did Kahn mean?\" But this does not mean an old way of thinking is being imposed on a new way of producing intellectual works. Scores of understudies in the studios of Michelangelo and Leonardo worked on the masters' projects. The point is not that the \"old\" way was individualistic or collective; the point is that the \"new\" way has not been shown to be more collective.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn41.

When Louis Kahn asked Luis Barragin how he would landscape the area between the two buildings at the Salk Institute, \"the Mexican architect walked over to one building, touched its concrete, and corrected Kahn's question at its premise. The space should not be a garden at all, Barragin concluded ... but a plaza paved in stone cut by a channel of water....

There was just a touch of irony when two of the leading proponents of the \"collective process\" wrote back-to-back articles in one journal. Each article wasentitled Author Effect and each author thanked the other author in the first footnote. But the articles were not co-written; each retained individual authorship of one article. n48 Apparently, their own works have not become that \"polyvocal.\" Of the people who write about the contemporary collaborative writing [*95] process, Andrea Lumsford and Lisa Ede seem to be rare exceptions who put their pens - and their empirical research - where their theories are. n49 Their work has not yet gone far enough to prove increasing feelings of a non-individualistic, collaborative process. n50 And what would we do if we concluded that intellectual production had become more collaborative, while that identification with intellectual products remained intensely individualistic?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn43.

As Professor Chon has observed:\n\nEven in intensely collaborative environments, individual feelings of ownership (or perhaps possessiveness) emerge .... Whatever the futureoligists predict, the Internet has not yet erased the vestiges of earlier historical views of authorship and works - views reinforced by cultural practices that persist despite successive waves of different kinds of \"mechanical reproduction,\" appropriation art, post-structuralist theory and critical thinking in the law.\n\nChon, supra note 29, at 274 (noting that students participating in a \"chain art\" project on the Internet were often upset when someone changed the joint image in a way they were unhappy with).\n\nn45.

For example, Louis Kahn proudly recounted the following tale from his childhood:\n\nOne day as a small boy I was copying the portrait of Napoleon. His left eye was giving me trouble. Already I had erased the drawing of it several times. My father leaned over and lovingly corrected my work. I threw the paper and pencil across the room saying, \"Now it is your drawing, not mine.\" Two cannot make a single drawing. I am sure the most skillful imitation can be detected by the originator.\n\nLouis Kahn, The Notebooks and Drawings of Louis Kahn, (Foreword) (1974). And it is hard to fathom Walt Disney's motives when it came to attribution in Disney films. The classic Walt Disney movies from the \"golden age\" of animation - Snow White, Fantasia, Jungle Book, Bambi - were created by the \"Nine Old Men\" of Disney, including Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, but Walt Disney - whose singular name is identified with that treasure trove - \"would not allow any animator to take sole credit for a character in a film.\" Scott Collins, Frank, Ollie Ride Again, L.A.

The three patentees regularly interacted in this setting in an effort to solve the problem of proper staple firing and formation.

After the 318th standing ovation - which followed the 318th performance of the show - Andrews announced her decision to decline the nomination saying, \"I have searched my conscience and my heart and find that I cannot accept this nomination and prefer to stand instead with the egregiously overlooked ... members of the Victor/Victoria family.\" Andrews specifically named 12 people to whom she attributed the success of the show, including the lighting and costume designers.

There are good arguments that the basic system should remain the same. n51 A scheme for attribution rights would probably not be difficult to sort out. Artists seem generally amenable to such attribution. Our popular culture already thrives on recognizably collective, albeit extremely hierarchical creativity. It is \"Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band,\" \"Prince and the New Power Generation,\" or \"Huey Lewis and the News.\" Still, one wonders how far such a scheme must go.

Nonetheless, the fact remains that, no matter what people say, there is indeed an \"imaginer\" and this suffices to restore the traditional basis. This does not mean that the new technologies do not complicate matters. For example, it may be difficult to separate the contributions of the computer programmer and the artist, or that of the provider of the basic scenario and that of the \"adopter.\" However, this is basically a classic problem.\n\nJean-Loup Tournier, Author's Rights and New Modes of Exploitation, 16 Colum.-VLA J.L. & Arts 441, 458 (1992).\n\nn52.

One option would be to extend the present system, effectively giving each contributor rights to prevent any particular use (license, novelization, broadcast, etc.). This would produce a \"veto\" system which would surely diminish society's access to jointly written works. In such a system, pressures would be strong to create a background hierarchy of contributors so that not every contributor could prevent release of the work.

As Professor Keith Aoki has noted, it is ironic that while some scholars have been marshaling European literary criticism against \"authors,\" other scholars and lawmakers have been importing European notions of \"moral rights\" - legal privileges which elevate the importance of the individual who produces intellectual works. n54 Declaring the end of the romantic \"author\" and thoughtfully calling for programs to reshape the law without this nuisance concept seems just a little out of touch. We must first consider a dozen legislatures who have already passed moral rights laws for visual artists, and Congress which has grudgingly embraced the moral rights requirements of the Berne Convention. n55 If these laws are any indicia, then it may be, as James Boyle believes, that \"the romantic vision of authorship is more important today than it was to Fichte and Krause, Pope and Macaulay.\" n56\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn54.

First, the rise of the [*97] \"author\" in eighteenth and nineteenth century cultural norms and its migration about that time into jurisprudence does not tell us that the word \"author\" in present-day court opinions has either the same content or the same influence it may once have had. We cannot condemn a social construct purely on its pedigree without reference to its present uses. n57 If the history of ideas teaches us anything, it is that ideas are not stable. The question is not whether the concept is historically contingent, but how contingent it is. The concept of a \"republic\" is also historically contingent, but that does not mean it lacks utility or applicability. n58 No doubt \"romantic author\" is a more historically contingent construct than \"author\" - just as \"federal republic\" would be a more historically contingent construct than \"republic.\" If the point is to show us that \"author\" in American jurisprudence always carries \"romantic author\" imbedded in it, then there is a great deal yet to prove.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn57.

This terminological \"drift\" also makes for more comfortable reading; ironically, it follows in the tradition of intellectual property case law which has been attacked for the same kind of imprecision. For example, in the 1884 Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony case, Justice Miller used almost a score of different phrases to describe what was protectable by copyright, ranging from \"original intellectual conceptions\" to \"originality of thought\" to \"intellectual production.\" 111 U.S. 53, 58-61 (1884).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAfter exploring the notion of creativity, the discussion below will sketch out how the deconstructionists' observations about \"author reasoning\" can just as well be diagnosed as the law's sometimes uncritical reliance on the notion of \"creativity.\"\n\nB.\n\nThe Multivalent Notion of Creativity\n\nFrom the deconstructionist perspective, copyright law \"is grounded on an uncritical belief in the existence of a distinct and privileged category of activity\" n63 called authorship. However fascinating the historical account of romantic author-genius' arrival into Anglo American law may be, our courts, like our art professors and theater critics, are more concerned with creativity than authorship.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn63.

To psychologists and psychiatrists, \"the more one studies the subject of creativity, the more complex and bewildering it seems.\" n64 Freud himself reluctantly concluded that \"before the problem of the creative artist, analysis must, alas, lay down its arms.\" n65 And to many artists \"the most important element\" of their works remains completely \"inexplicable.\" n66 We do not even know what kind of relationship it has with other constructs of human activity, such as labor. n67 This is [*99] serious baggage for someone arguing that creativity better explains judicial reasoning than the \"romantic author.\" To meet that burden, the discussion that follows explores the popular notion of creativity and how its constituent elements provide a personality justification for intellectual property rights. Although creativity bears some aspects of \"a distinct and privileged category of activity,\" it has over the decades actually required dilution of the romantic notion of creative genius and, in its place, put increasing emphasis on originality and personal expression.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn64. As Leon Berman elaborates:\n\nAttempts to define the creative process have focused on ... regression in the service of the ego; and such diverse affects as awe, wonderment, loneliness, inspiration, and ecstasy. Significant life experiences have been considered as well as innate endowments. Traumatogenic theories of creativity have implicated childhood abuse, loss, illness, and congenital deformity.\n\nIn the midst of all this attention, the character of the poor artist has been idealized, diagnosed, and defamed. He has been associated with the infant, the child, and the adolescent; the dreamer, the prophet, and the rebel; the neurotic, the impostor, the sociopath, the pervert, the criminal, and the psychotic.\n\nLeon Berman, An Artist Destroys His Work: Comments on Creativity and Destructiveness, in Creativity and Madness: Psychological Studies in Art and Artists 59 (Panter et al. eds., 1995).

There is a very ambiguous relationship between creative work as \"work\" and as pleasure. For example, watching the young Renoir paint, the critic Charles Gleyre asked him, \"No doubt, it is to amuse yourself that you are dabbing in paint?\" To which Renoir is supposed to have replied, \"Why, of course, and if it did not amuse me, I beg you to believe that I would not do it.\" Otto Friedrich, Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet 242 (1992). Aristotle was probably the first to observe that the \"sciences which do not aim at giving pleasure or at the necessities of life were discovered, ... first in the places where men first began to have leisure. This is why mathematical arts were founded in Egypt; for there the priestly caste was allowed to be at leisure.\" Aristotle, 1 Metaphysics, 690-91 (Random House ed. 1941). Thus started the quandary of how an experience of leisure could be a process of labor.

The Copyright Act limits property rights to \"original works of authorship.\" n69 The adjective \"original\" has led courts to create a threshold issuein copyright disputes of whether a work shows \"originality.\" The Supreme Court packed the notion of creativity into the notion of originality in the context of using \"originality\" as a requirement for copyright protection. This is decidedly different from a social scientist's effort to unpack the notion of creativity; the Court was considering a judicial construct versus a social scientist exploring a social convention. Still, Feist is a starting point because the Court concludes that everything juridically original is also juridically creative. That logically entails the proposition that decided Feist: if something is not juridically creative, it cannot be juridically original. (\"If j-original, then j-creative.\") n70\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn68. Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv.

For those familiar with symbolic logic, let's summarize the Feist decision as saying: if j-original, then j-creative, which is logically equivalent to if not j-creative, then not j-original (<diff>j-creative<arr rt><diff>j-original).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThis equation (if j-original, then j-creative) was in reaction to a long line of case law that had supported the view that the requirement of originality was \"little more than a prohibition of actual copying.\" n71 This juridical notion of originality, like the popular no- [*100] tion of originality, owes its currency to the idea of something's \"origin\": if a song owes its origin to Leslie, it must be original to Leslie. This measure of \"originality\" dates back to Justice Story's early nineteenth century opinions n72 and gave us a fairly bright line test: if the work was the independent creation of someone, it was \"original\" to that person. n73 (As described earlier, this minimalist sense of \"original\" - owing its origin to someone - is what we will explore below as the notion of \"sourcehood.\" If the song owes its origin to Leslie, Leslie is the source of the song; if the cell line owes it origin to a skin sample taken from Tim's wrist, then Tim is the source of the cell line).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn71. Alfred Bell & Co., v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc., 191 F.2d 99, 103 (2d Cir. 1951). This is a view unquestioned by scholars writing prior to Feist.

Because American law makes originality the gate keeper of copyright protection, the Feist Court backed away from this narrow sense of \"original.\" Instead, the Court embraced a formula tying originality with creativity. The Second Circuit and Professor Nimmer were among those who had already explicitly linked originality to creativity n74 while many copyright decisions had already required \"creativity\" for copyright protection - meaning that it was either embedded in the notion of \"originality\" or it stood as a separate requirement. n75\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn74.

Prior to the Feist decision, Professor Litman also suggested that the \"symbolic power\" of originality was rooted in the \"romantic model of authorship.\" Litman, supra note 29, at 1007. While not subscribing to the scholarship of the \"romantic author\" construct, I take Litman to have recognized that the legal notion of \"originality\" always required creativity.\n\nn75. The ambiguous place of the creativity requirement goes back at least to Justice Miller's formulation in Trade-Mark Cases that copyright protection applies to works \"only such as are original, and are founded in the creative powers of the mind.\" In re Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 94 (1879).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe program in Feist adopts the formula \"if j-original, then j-creative\" because this provides the more important rule, \"if not j-creative, then not j-original.\" Embedding creativity in originality certainly makes the originality test more complicated than it would be as a mere test of sourcehood. n76 But beyond that where are we led? [*101] What counts as creative in the juridical sense? What counts as creative in the popular sense? In Feist, the court tells us only that creativity is not variations that are \"mechanical,\" \"entirely typical,\" or \"garden variety.\" Intellectual products that result from choices about composition that are obvious, inevitable, or \"age old practice(s)\" do not count as minimally creative.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn76.

Supreme Court opinions are understandably restrained by fear that legions of lawyers will try to shoehorn a wide range of future human activity into choice phrases from opinions. But if judicial creativity is the same as the popular notion of creativity, we have a problem because the popular notion of creativity turns back to and depends on the popular notion of originality.\n\nAs Russ VerSteeg has pointed out, \"creativity\" traces its etymological roots to the Latin verb creo, meaning \"to beget\" or \"to give birth to.\" n77 The Latin root also means \"to make\" or \"to produce\" and is related to the verb cresco meaning \"to grow up\" or \"to spring forth.\" n78 In short, the words' roots do nothing to help distinguish \"creating\" from \"originating,\" or being the source of something.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn77.

Imagine that Patty purchases ten pounds of red clay from Adam, who dug the clay from a hillside on his farm. Patty uses five pounds of the clay to make a vase; she gives this vase to Kevin. She also gives the five remaining pounds of clay to Kevin (perhaps with a note about the pleasures of the potter's wheel). It is non-controversial that if someone asked you, knowing all this, \"what is the origin of the vase?\" you would probably say \"Patty\" and that the same reply would hold true if you substituted \"source,\" i.e. \"what is the source of the vase?\" If you rephrased the question into \"who created the vase?\" you would again get \"Patty\" as the answer.\n\nNow consider if someone asked about the clay, i.e., \"what is the origin of the clay?\" or \"what is the source of the clay?\" This is more difficult. If you understood this question to be \"how did the clay get here?\" you might answer \"Patty,\" but it seems more likely that you would treat this as a question about the clay's provenance, [*102] i.e. \"where did it come from?\" In that case, if someone asked you \"what is the origin of the clay?\" you would probably say \"Adam\" or \"Adam's farm.\" Again, the same answer would come if \"source\" was substituted for \"origin.\" The probable answer would be \"Adam\" or \"Adam's farm.\"\n\nBut what if someone asked who created the clay? The question might evoke \"God,\" \"Nature,\" or some explanation that Adam dug it up, but didn't \"create\" it. I believe that this question gets a different answer because Adam does not seem to have transformed the materials available to him when he dug them up. But this still does not evince a great difference between the popular ideas of \"creating\" and \"originating.\" In fact, we could arrange a hierarchy of questions which, to increasing degrees, evoke the question of when an object first appears in the world (or first appears in the world in the form it now has):\n\n\"What is the provenance of X ?\"\n\n\"Where/who did X come from?\"\n\n\"What is the source of X ?\"\n\n\"What is the origin of X ?\"\n\n\"Who/what created X ?\"\n\nSubstitute Patty's vase or Adam's clay for X in this series of questions - the questions initially can be met with an intermediary answer (\"the delivery truck,\" \"the back seat of Patty's car,\" etc.). However, as you go down the list, what is increasingly demanded is an answer about when X first appears in the world identifiable as X. This would hold true if you ran through this list replacing X with a commercial jetliner, an antique chest, or a manuscript, anonymous because the title page has been torn off. Point to a commercial jet at an airport and ask where did it come from; its last stop - Boston, Cincinnati, Denver - will be a fine answer. But point to the same aircraft and ask who created it; nothing but \"Boeing\" will do as an answer. The moment when something first appeared in the world in its present form is synonymous with the moment when other things were transformed to the new thing.\n\nThe point of the hierarchy of questions is that it shows that both creativity and originality are rooted in the transformative process. n79 But there are many details that need attention. First, there [*103] is the issue of whether the transformative process of \"creating\" or \"originating\" focuses on the materials actually at the disposal of the person or the total world of materials or elements possibly available. Notions, especially populist notions, of both creativity and originality are context-specific; they measure transformation by what the person actually had available. For example, discussing \"creativity,\" Robert Nozick writes,\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn79. The view that transformation or novelty is fundamental to creativity is also put forward in Robert Weisberg, Creativity: Beyond the Myth of Genius 4-5, 247-48 (1993), a book that came to my attention after this article was written. Weisberg provides a thoughtful survey of psychological efforts to explore creativity, particularly how it differs from regular thinking - an issue that this discussion does not address.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWhether or not there really is anything new under the sun, a creative act produces something new or novel in comparison to what the creator had encountered and known previously. If unbeknownst to the creator someone else had produced something similar or identical ... still the creator's act would have been an act of creation. All that matters is that the effects of this earlier discovery have not seeped through and become known to the new discoverer in a way that makes his act less novel. Calling an act \"creative\" characterizes it only in relation to the materials it actually arose from, the earlier experiences and knowledge of the creator, not in relation to everything that has preceded it in the history of the universe. n80\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn80.

In considering Rembrandt and the master forger, Mihaly Csikszentmihaly reasons that only \"Rembrandt's work is creative because he introduced some variations in the domain of painting at a certain point in history, when those variations were novel .... The very same variations a few years later were no longer creative, because then they simply reproduced existing forms.\" n81 Csikszentmihaly's definition of creative differs from Nozick's not in the test - which remains a test of identifiable difference - but in the reference set used for the test. Whereas Nozick refers to what the creator had encountered and known previously, Csikszentmihaly compares to all that has come before.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn81.

This is a problem we sometimes encounter with children: the child piles up sand in her sand box and asks us to look at what she has \"made.\" We feign interest, but it does not look like anything has been \"made\" at all. No transformation is apparent to us; nothing in the sand box looks much different than the pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe law rarely needs to worry about the sensitivities of infants, but the problem returns in the case of faithful reproductions and derivative works. The master copier example makes clear that the question of \"transformation\" from pre-existing materials is a question of mental or intellectual materials, not physical materials. Consider a case where the master copier reproduced Pineapple Bud, not on a canvas but in a different medium - a holographic image of Pineapple Bud, a tile mural of Pineapple Bud, etc. Professor Nimmer reasonably took the position that \"mere reproduction of a work of art in a different medium should not constitute the required originality\"; Nimmer reasoned that \"no one can claim to have independently evolved any particular medium.\" n82 But while the result seems right, the reasoning is suspect. The real reason must be because expression of the same image in a known medium, while an identifiably different object, is not an identifiably different image.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn82. 1MelvilleB.

As to the first factor of whether the copying was a \"transformative (or productive)\" n84 use of the original, Texaco argued that its use of the articles was \"transformative\" because: \"photocopying the article separated it from a bulky journal, made it more amenable to markings, and provided a document that could be readily replaced if damaged in a laboratory, all of which 'transformed' the original article into a form that better served [the sci- [*105] entist's] research needs.\" n85\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn83. 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\nn84.

So some distinction is necessary between value that \"inheres\" in the work and \"new\" value. In an intellectual culture steeped in law and economics, we can understand a court trying to objectify its analysis in terms of \"value.\" But beyond this conceptual dressing, it is clear that the distinction between inherent value and new value really relies on a judgment about transformation and not vice versa. New value depends on transformation and transformation depends on identifiable differences from what has come before.\n\nDoes transformation - and thus a judgment of originality or creativity - depend on anything more than identifiable difference? Does it depend on significant differences or important differences or extensive differences? Some quantum of difference - either quantitative or qualitative? One author broadly identified creativity as: \"(1) originality - new or unusual elements must be involved, and (2) adaptation to reality - outcomes must be meaningful to others rather than random or idiosyncratic.\" n88 Here the popular notion of creativity is being defined in terms of originality, which is not at all surprising given our discussion. \"New or unusual elements\" adds little to this.

One prospect is that if \"non-randomness\" is a requirement for something to be creative, it is because random organization of existing elements are not identifiably different from what occurs (has occurred or could occur) in the background world. n89 The child's arrangement of [*106] blocks does not seem \"creative\" if it looks no more than random. Another prospect is that what is \"non-random\" is non-random because it is meaningful. Both these interpretations can be read from Aristotle's discussion of the concept of art. \"Art\" for Aristotle was that which owed its origin to a person and did not have its existence in the background world:\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn89.

As the court said in Mitel, Inc. v. Iqtel, Inc., 124 F.3d 1366 (10th Cir. 1997):\n\nMitel's arbitrary selection of a combination of three or four numbers required de minimis creative effort, Mitel's own witness testified to the arbitrariness of the command codes ....

The Connection between Creativity and the Personal\n\nIt is said that Diego Rivera's affair with his wife's sister, Christina, was discovered because of the way he painted Christina's image into a mural at the Mexican National Palace - in an \"ecstasy pose,\" n91 while the extraordinary paintings of his wife, Frida Kahlo, reflected her own experiences - spinal injuries from a car accident, [*107] a miscarriage, and struggles with Catholicism. n92 Edward Munch's first major work, The Sick Child, recalls the death of his sister Sophie from tuberculosis. It was a scene he would repaint six times in his life. n93 Julian Green acknowledges that several of his characters \"inherited\" his own fascination \"for long, adventurous walks\" through the streets of Paris n94 while Eudora Welty sees the emphasis in her stories on weather, schoolteachers, and parades all stemming from childhood memories. n95 Ibsen was even more direct in transforming personal experiences into literature. He was known to abruptly start inviting individuals to dinner parties, then just as unceremoniously drop them from his social list, once he had enough of their manners, speech, and attitudes to create a character. n96 Even animators draw upon their experiences with humans to draw memorable characters and creatures. n97 We could fill an encyclopedia with such examples of \"art\" based on the artist's experiences. n98 As Bono, lead singer of \"U2\" remarked, \"musicians, painters, whatever, they have no choice but to describe where they live.\" n99\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn91.

The connection could be one of practicality and prudence, the most successful creators staying close to what they know. Kahlo herself explained that many of her paintings were self-portraits \"because I am the subject I know best.\" n100 In giving advice to a young writer, Jane Austen suggested \"Let [your characters] go to Ireland, but as you know nothing of the Manners there, you had better not go with them. You will be in danger of giving false representations ....\" n101 But it [*108] appears to be something more than creativity conveniently married to personal memories. Many of us - perhaps most of us - move uncritically from a belief that intellectual works reflect personal experiences to a belief that intellectual works are personal expressions. This is worth exploring. It is important to consider how personal expression may be something different from repeating or reproducing personal experiences.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn100.

Jane Austen also displayed her lack of personal experience when writing to Clarke, the Prince Regent's librarian, about a novel featuring a clergyman much like the Reverend Clarke:\n\nI am quite honoured by your thinking me capable of drawing such a clergyman .... But I assure you I am not. The comic part I might be equal to, but not the good, the enthusiastic, the literary. Such a man's conversations must at times be on subjects of science and philosophy, of which I know nothing; or at least be occasionally abundant in quotations and allusions which a woman who, like me, knows only her mother tongue, and has read very little in that, would be totally without the power of giving.\n\nLetter from Jane Austen to James Stanier Clarke (Dec. 11, 1815), in Jane Austen's Letters 442 (R.W.

Weak and Strong Views of Creativity-as-Reflection\n\nFaithfully reconstructing a situation from one's personal past - memory regurgitation - would be an act of personal reflection. It would reflect personal experiences as though the person was a passive, if imperfect, mirror of extra-person reality. But let's consider two distinct strands of the view that intellectual works reflect the personal experiences of those that produce them.\n\nFirst, it is certainly easy to believe that an intellectual work is a personal reflection of the individual - a reflection of their infancy, their childhood, their recent experiences, or what they had for lunch today. As Welty writes, \"any writer is in part all of his characters. How otherwise would they be known to him, occur to him, become what they are?\" n102 Liam Hudson and Bernadine Jacot believe, for example, that the broad choice of what field academics and professionals enter is a reflection of parent/child relations in infancy. n103 At a more refined level, Hudson and Jacot believe that the research projects undertaken by many eminent social scientists reflect neither random choices nor strategic career opportunities nor influential teachers, but \"the mind helping make the raw edges of personal experience smooth.\" n104 Their examples include both [*109] Sigmund Freud and Alfred Kinsey pushed to their respective works in sexuality - the former highly normative, the latter dispassionately descriptive - by their own homosexual experiences. n105\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn102. Welty, supra note 95, at 101.\n\nn103. Lian Hudson & Bernadine Jacot, The Way Men Think 81-82 (1991). Hudson and Jacot believe that the \"science and technology, far from requiring an extension or distortion of imaginative processes that are properly personal, provide the 'male' imagination with venues within which it can be deployed in its most fluent and spontaneous form.\" They also believe that male artists turn their imagination away from this \"natural home\" by refocusing on the \"female body from which it initially took flight.\" Id. at 172.\n\nn104.

But the \"reflection\" theory has a much more explicit side. The possibility is that personal reflection, personal expression, and creativity should all collapse on one another, i.e., that \"creativity\" is only a fancy covering for observation - the direct reproduction of things we have experienced. n106 The Athenian Greeks were the first to conclude that art was an act of reproduction or imitation, n107 a view that was reflected in Aristotle's reference to fine arts as \"imitative arts\" and \"modes of imitation.\" In this spirit, Emily Dickinson described the eminent painter as \"one who could repeat the Summer day\" and \"reproduce the Sun.\" n108 Dickens modeled a character in Bleak House, Harold Skimpole, so precisely after Leigh Hunt that Dickens noted to a friend that his fictional character was \"The most exact portrait that was ever painted in words .... It is an absolute reproduction of the real man.\" n109 Kundera tells us that \"Hemingway's work is but a coded form of Hemingway's life.\" n110 Perhaps even sometimes an individual's personality is most manifest in a res as a negative inference: I recognize that the emotions or the vision in the intellectual work come from some human experience, but I know that it could not come from my experience. n111\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nn106. As in the New Englander who thought Thoreau got his ideas from conversations with one of Emerson's relatives: \"He did set them [Bulkey Emerson's views] down, but he didn't give Bulkey the credit.... I think Thoreau was nothing more than an early new journalist. He was an excellent reporter, but he was nonobjective and he was very bad about his sources.\" John Manson Mitchell, Ceremonial Time 141 (1984).
