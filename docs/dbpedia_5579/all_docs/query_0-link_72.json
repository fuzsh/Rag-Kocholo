Yet he has not attracted as much literary\n\ninterest as the more revolutionary communist leaders.\n\nItalian communism has not, for example, involved the\n\nUnited States in any conflict such as the Korean or Viet­\n\nnamese Wars. This observation raises additional questions\n\nabout the nature of Italian communism. Why has the com­\n\nmunist movement taken a less violent course in Italy than\n\nin the East? What impact has the \"Italian road to\n\nsocialism\" had on the Italian political scene? Since no\n\nItalian has had more influence on the course of the\n\nItalian Communist movement than Palmiro Togliatti, whose\n\npolitical career spans the evolution of the party to the\n\nlargest in the Western World, an assessment of his politi­\n\ncal significance would be vital to any understanding of\n\nItalian communism.\n\nTogliatti himself wrote regularly for communist\n\npublications including \"L*Unita,\" \"Stato Operaio** and\n\n\"Rinascita\" and is the author of numerous polemical works.\n\nii\n\nWhile these works reflect the political line of the\n\nItalian Communist Party, they tell us little about Togli­\n\natti the man. Communist chroniclers like Giovanni\n\nGermanetto, Paolo Robotti, Giorgio Speriano, Luigi Longo\n\nand Roberto Battaglia have offered suggestive interpre­\n\ntations of various facets of Togliatti*s career as have\n\nnumerous ex-communists including Fulvio Bellini, Giorgio\n\nGalli, Angelo Tasca, Ignazio Silone, Eugenio Reale,\n\nRenato Miele and Giulio Seniga. Scholars such as Norman\n\nKogan, Gunther Nollau and Charles Delzell have contributed\n\nmuch research to various phases of the Italian Communist\n\nParty. By drawing together the various sources touching\n\non Togliatti*s career, my own work embraces a longer span\n\nthan that of the several writers mentioned. I hope that\n\nthis synthesis can become a point of departure for new\n\ninvestigations into this intriguing subject.\n\nI found Mussolini*s Enemies, by Charles Delzell, a\n\nvery helpful account of the early years and popular front\n\nperiod of the Italian Communist Party. The New York Times\n\nwas particularly useful for the 1944-1957 account of\n\nTogliatti*s career.\n\nI wish to thank the members of my guidance committee\n\nat the University of Southern California, Dr. Lawrence\n\nWalker, Dr. Donald Queller and Dr. Robert Anchor, and\n\nDr. Robert Wohl of the University of California at Los\n\nAngeles, for their assistance and criticism.\n\niii\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPage\n\nPREFACE\n\nChapter\n\nAN INTRODUCTION TO A POLITICAL CAREER\n\nII.

CONCLUSION\n\n134 BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\niv\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAN INTRODUCTION TO A POLITICAL CAREER\n\nThe political career of Palmiro Togliatti is a study\n\nof a master politician. During his thirty-eight years as\n\nthe undisputed head of the Communist Party of Italy (PCI),\n\nhe was labeled with many diverse terms, but the users of\n\npolitical and social appellations have agreed, for the\n\nmost part, that Togliatti was a \"master of maneuver.\n\nThe same Togliatti, who has been charged with being an\n\nagent of Moscow, was the \"originator and leading exponent\n\nof the polycentrist faction of world communism.\" As one\n\nof the leaders of the faction that broke away from the\n\nSocialist Party of Italy (PSI) in 1921, Togliatti would\n\nalso be the man who would lead the PCI back to a \"Pact\n\nof Unity\" with the socialists fifteen years later. While\n\ncriticized by many for his autocratic leadership of the\n\nparty, he has been hailed by others for initiating a\n\n\"democratic\" road to socialism in Italy. Truly, Togliatti\n\nis one of the enigmas of the communist movement.\n\nThe main purpose of this thesis shall be to demon-\n\n^Robert A. Wohl, \"Togliatti, Master of Maneuver,\"\n\nCommunist Affairs, I (November-December, 1963), p. 21.\n\n^\"Luigi Longo, Successor to Togliatti,\" Communist\n\nAffairs, II (July-August, 1964), p. 28.\n\n2 I\n\nj\n\nstrate Togliatti*s significance in the evolution of the\n\nItalian Communist Party, Italian politics and the world\n\ncommunist movement. We are not going to be unduly con­\n\ncerned with the motives of Togliatti. His struggle for\n\nsurvival through fascism. Stalinist terror, Spanish Civil\n\nWar and World War II might alone have guided Togliatti*s\n\npractical duplicity. But the results are not negligible.\n\nToday the PCI remains the largest communist party in\n\nWestern Europe and observers of communist affairs, such\n\nas Norman Kogan, Alexander Daliin and Walter Laqueur have\n\nlooked to the Italian experience for insight into the\n\ndirection of the world communist movement.\n\nWhen Togliatti first became a member of the PCI, few\n\noutside of socialist circles had ever heard of him. Yet\n\nin a few years he was not only a national figure but well\n\nestablished in Moscow circles as well. By 1924 he had met\n\nand conferred with such figures as Lenin, Bukharin,\n\nTrotsky and Zinoviev. With the arrest of Antonio Gramsci\n\nin 1926, Togliatti became the number one man in the PCI,\n\nalthough not officially elected Secretary-General of the\n\nparty until 1944. In 1937 Togliatti, who was by then\n\nSecretary of the Communist International or Comintern,\n\nheaded an international team of communists in the Spanish\n\nCivil War. His personal contacts in Moscow and his avail­\n\nability, since he was one of few to escape Fascist im­\n\nprisonment, catapulted him to the top position in the PCI\n\n3\n\nso that, upon his return to Italy in 1944, he became one\n\nof the chief negotiators in the formation of a new Italian\n\ngovernment.\n\nMembers of his own party as well as the leaders of\n\nthe right were shocked when Togliatti failed to insist on\n\nthe elimination of the monarchy and instead called for\n\ncommunist cooperation and participation in Parliament.\n\nThis turn or \"svolta** in tactics paved the way for his\n\ncabinet positions in the following five administrations.\n\nThere were some dire predictions that \"Togliatti*s\n\n*'democratic road to socialism** would be suicidal for the\n\nparty, but his coalition with the socialists and communist\n\nparticipation in the resistance resulted in great postwar\n\npopularity for the party. Although ousted from the cabi­\n\nnet in 1947, the communists continued to augment their\n\nstrength in Parliament. With votes as his new weapon,\n\nTogliatti could bargain with ifehe right and center parties\n\noffering communist support in return for a left-center\n\ngovernment.\n\nAs easily as he had adapted to the Stalinist line,\n\nTogliatti adjusted readily to de-Stalinization and even\n\nto criticisms of his party's \"revisionism.* * If Moscow\n\nordered toughness, the PCI leader might call for a strike\n\nto appease the Soviets but, if such a move threatened his\n\nplans for the party in Italy, the strike would be called\n\noff in twenty-four hours. In this way, Togliatti was\n\n4\n\nable to hold together both the right and left factions of\n\nthe PCI.\n\nIn the wake of Tito's break with Moscow, Togliatti\n\nappeared to endorse Tito-autonomism. In a press interview\n\nhe rejected \"the principle of one guiding party for world\n\ncommunism\" and noted the necessity for \"polycentric\"\n\nleadership in Europe. When this statement evoked criti-\n\nI cism from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU),\n\nI\n\n, he quickly explained his way out of his original meaning\n\nand back into the good graces of Moscow. By calling for\n\nI \"unity through autonomy\" in the communist movement, Togli-\n\n; atti attempted to support both sides of an issue at once,\n\nj A studious man, Togliatti could read Greek, Latin, Russian,\n\nI German, Spanish, French and English and collected rare\n\n! books.^\n\nPalmiro Togliatti was born in Genoa on March 26,\n\n1893. He was bom in the Convitti nazionale, a local\n\norphanage, where his father, Antonio Togliatti, was a\n\nmiddle-class, government bookkeeper. Togliatti later\n\ndescribed his father and mother, Teresa Viale, as \"both\n\nintelligent and capable people, but in the end crushed\n\n^L’Unlta.

He had an older bro­\n\nther, Eugenio, who later became a professor of science\n\nat the University of Genoa; an older sister, Maria Chris­\n\ntina, who became a literature professor in Turin; and a\n\nyounger brother, Enrico, who became an engineer. The\n\nfamily moved from Genoa to Turin where Togliatti attended\n\nhigh school. Since he was studious and usually at the\n\nhead of his class, he was able to obtain gratuities for\n\nmost of his studies. During this period he found some\n\nsocialist books hidden behind a closet at home, where per­\n\nhaps his father had put them. He read them avidly but\n\nhis favorites were still Voltaire, Dante and Leopardi. In\n\nI 1908 the family moved to Sassari, Sardinia idiere Togliatti\n\nj studied Greek and Latin. When his father died in January,\n\n1911, the family moved back to Turin, back to Sassari and\n\nback to Turin again in the fall so that he could take the\n\nscholarship examinations for the University of Turin.^\n\nThe day of the examination he met Antonio Gramsci, i\n\nwho was destined to become the founder of the Italian j\n\nI\n\nCommunist Party. Togliatti placed second in the competi- j\n\ntion while Gramsci placed seventh. His scholarship from\n\nthe Provincial Foundation allowed Togliatti seventy lira\n\nper month for each of his years at the university. At the\n\n^Marcella Ferrara and Maurizio Ferrara, Conversando\n\ncon Togliatti, (Rome: Edizioni di Cultura Sociale, 1954),p.1\n\n^Fulvio Bellini and Giorgio Galli, Storia del Partito\n\nCommunista Italiana, (Milan: Schwarz, 1953), p. 231 |\n\n6\n\nuniversity, Togliatti became good friends with Gramsci,\n\nAngelo Tasca and Umberto Terracini, who eventually formed\n\nthe hierarchy of the Italian Communist Party, Of Gramsci,\n\nTogliatti later wrote, \"He was much more advanced than I,\n\nin culture, in intellectual experience and it was his\n\nguidance that orientated me.\n\nTogliatti did his first research on the backward\n\nconditions and criminality in Sardinia and concluded that\n\nthe Sardinian economy had fallen victim to Italian capi­\n\ntalism which had forced a new customs tariff that ruined\n\nthe local Sardinian agriculture. In addition to studying\n\neconomics, he was much impressed by Arturo Farinelli's\n\nI class in classics and German romanticism and was influenced\n\nI by Hegelianism and the idealism of Benedetto Croce. With\n\nI\n\n! Gramsci he frequented the circles of \"young fascists\" and\n\ni\n\nin 1914, joined the socialist party. Togliatti was\n\nI\n\nI arrested for the first time during a demonstration when\n\nan election candidate, the socialist Gaetano Salvemini,\n\n'spoke in the Piazza Statute. During these years Turin\n\nwas one of the focal points for demonstrations for and\n\nagainst the war, in addition to being one of the most in­\n\ndustrialized of Italian cities. During one such protest\n\nan anarchist who was leading a march was shot by police\n\nand fell dead next to Togliatti.^ Such events left a\n\n^Ferrara and Ferrara, op. cit., p. 24.\n\n8\n\nBellini and Galli, op. cit., p. 1.\n\n7 I\n\nlasting impression on him. After submitting his thesis |\n\non colonial tariff systems, in which he maintained the\n\nincompatibility of a protective tariff with the Italian |\n\nI economy, Togliatti received his laureate with distinction '\n\nI and went on for a law degree. His studies were interrupted\n\nI\n\nI by World War I. At first Togliatti was judged physically\n\nunfit for military service and so served voluntarily in\n\ni\n\nthe medical corps. Later he became a soldier in the 54th\n\nI Regiment and then the 2nd Alpine Regiment where he became !\n\nan officer. After being discharged in 1917 because of\n\n^lung trouble, he returned to Turin for a doctoral degree\n\nin philosophy and became familiar with Das Kapital, the\n\nQ\n\nEthics of Spinoza and Giordano Bruno s Dialogues.\n\n1 '\n\nTogliatti began to write regularly for the socialist !\n\nnewspaper, \"Avanti,\" but beginning on May 1, 1919, he i\n\nedited a separate newspaper, \"Ordine Nuovo\" [New Order] , |\n\n\" . . . . I\n\nalong with Gramsci, Tasca and Terracini. During the next\n\ntwo years this group, which came to be known as the Ordine !\n\n!Nuovo, began to organize \"Soviets\" or worker's councils\n\njin Turin factories, modelled after those set up in Russia, ,\n\n' ■ i\n\nj and emphasized revolutionary discipline instead of demo- |\n\ncratic methods. Along with other left-wing socialists,\n\nthey demanded that the PSI join the Third International\n\nor Comintern that was launched by Lenin in 1919. In his\n\ni\n\n^Wohl, op. cit. I\n\n8\n\nmemoirs, Piero Gobetti, who later left the communist party,\n\nrecalls that, for the most part, the \"Ordine Nuovo\" was\n\nsomewhat sterile and that the most lively articles \"were\n\nsome brilliant cultural chronicles which revealed the j\n\ncaustic genius of Palmiro T o g l i a t t i . .\n\nIn \"Ordine Nuovo,\" the young writer discussed the\n\nrecession, labor problems and the role of man in history |\n\n(\n\nand revolutions. He also translated some of Lenin's works I\n\nI\n\nj\n\ninto Italian and completed a cultural work, Battaglia I\n\ndelle idee. Thus, Togliatti was able to give some support ,\n\nto the rest of the family with whom he continued to live. '\n\nThe office of both \"Avanti\" and \"Ordine Nuovo\" was\n\nlocated on the comer of via XX Settembre and via Arcive-\n\nscovado until 1922. The Ordine Nuovo group started the !\n\nfirst factory council in May, 1919 at the Brevetti Fiat |\n\n11 I\n\nplant. Social activities the group sponsored were often I\n\ninterrupted by the police. Through the initiative of j\n\nOrdine Nuovo a Wagnerian concert was given for workers at I\n\n; the Teatro Reale. When the Superintendent of Police was\n\n; offended by the uproarious applause that greeted the\n\n!\n\nI \"Cavalcata delle Walkerie,\" which he confused with the\n\nj\n\ncommunist song \"Bandiera Rossa,\" he ordered everyone to\n\n^^Piero Giobetti, La Revoluzione liberal, (Turin:\n\nEinaudi, 1943), p. 119.\n\nUperrara and Ferrara, op. cit., p. 9.\n\n9 I\n\nleave the theater. In the fall of 1920, 1,267,953 workers !\n\nwent on strike after the FIAT workers took over the factory,\n\nrefusing to leave. Later Togliatti, in Conversando con\n\n■ 12\n\njTogliatti, recalled how armed forces of \"black shirts\"\n\ntook to the surrounding hills and from time to time di­\n\nrected machine gun fire against the buildings where the\n\nworkers were posted. On the night of September 9, Togli­\n\natti and Gramsci were at the FIAT center when shots were |\n\nheard. Togliatti followed Gramsci up the fire escape and |\n\non to the roof and watched several workers at another I\n\nfactory, the Capomianto, fall dead from an assassin's\n\nbullets.\n\nThe Ordine Nuovo group had taken part in the planning\n\nof the occupation and spent much time with the workers.\n\nTeresa Noce, the wife of Luigi Longo, who would follow\n\nTogliatti as leader of the PCI, also recounts in Conver­\n\nsando con Togliatti, how he stayed up all night making the\n\nrounds of the factories and fell asleep on the bus until\n\nit reached the end of the line. The occupation ended\n\non September 26, \\dien the workers accepted the terms of\n\nthe industrialist, Annelli, against Togliatti*s cautioning\n\nto beware of the \"insidious p r o p o s a l s \" ^ ^ and the conflict.\n\n^^Ibid., pp. 3-24 passim.\n\n13Ibid.. p. 78.\n\nl*^Palmiro Togliatti, \"Coopérâtivi o Schiavitu,\"\n\nAvanti, September 30, 1920.\n\n10\n\nwhich Togliatti had thought was the beginning of the revo- j\n\nlution, fizzled out. The national editor of \"Avanti,\" '\n\n: Giacinto Serrati, accused the Turin group of lack of I\n\nj I\n\nI discipline and criticized them for openly calling for a i\n\nI I\n\nI struggle in PSI against the \"reformists.\" This rebuke pro- |\n\nvoked the group to break the ties with the national edition\n\n; of \"Avanti\" and, at the end of the year, Togliatti left\n\nI\n\n; his post as Secretary of the Turin section of the Socialist\n\n! 15\n\n'Party.\n\nThe Italian Socialist Party had dated from 1892. '\n\n1 j\n\n; There had long been factions in the party, but unity had ’\n\nI !\n\ni been maintained. In March, 1919, PSI voted to adhere to\n\nI\n\nI the Third International, but when Lenin imposed the\n\nI \"Twenty-One Conditions\" as a requirement, three opposing !\n\nfactions emerged in the party: those, like the Ordine |\n\nI i\n\nNuovo group, who urged unconditional acceptance of the |\n\nI\n\nConditions, which included the ousting of all reformists j\n\nor those socialists favoring gradual, peaceful reform;\n\n1\n\n; those reformists led by Filippo Turati, who opposed any ,\n\ni ' '\n\njlink with the Comintern; and a center group, led by Pietro i\n\nNenni, ^ o sympathized with the aims of the Russian Revo- j\n\n; lution but hesitated to oust the reformists or change the\n\nparty name to the Communist Party of Italy.By the fall\n\n^-^Ferrara and Ferrara, op. cit., p. 86. !\n\n^^Charles F.

The split was precipitated by a communi­\n\ncation from Lenin published in \"Avanti\" on September 21.\n\nLenin charged \"events in Italy must open the eyes of even\n\nthe most obstinate. Turati, Modigliani and Daragona are\n\nguilty of sabotage against the revolution in Italy at the\n\nI \" n\n\nmoment when it begins to ripen.\" When the party of­\n\nficials, Antonio Graziadei and Nicola Bombacci, returned\n\nfrom Moscow soon afterwards, they urged the party to oust\n\nthe reformists and regard the \"Third International as the\n\nhighest authority accepted by all true Socialists in the\n\n18\n\nworld.\" A few days later the executive council of the\n\nPSI voted seven to five for adherence to the Conditions,\n\nbut the approval was tentative pending the vote of the\n\n19\n\nnational congress.\n\nLater Togliatti characterized the PSI in 1920 as in­\n\ncapable of struggling against the oligarchical regime,\n\nwhich served the privileged at the expense of the workers,\n\nbecause it lacked the perspective of a revolution and\n\nfailed to comprehend that the last stage of capitalism had ;\n\n^^New York Times, October 1, 1920, p. 17.\n\n^^Ibid..

Togliatti cited Italy's attempts at colonial\n\nconquest in Africa as proof that capitalism had indeed\n\nreached the imperialistic stage by 1920. Hence, according\n\nto Togliatti, the PSI had by 1921 missed the opportunity\n\nfor revolutionary action and, because the party lacked\n\ncomprehension of the Italian situation and the revolution­\n\nary task, it also lacked interior unity, effective disci­\n\npline, and the capacity to conduct itself in terms of con­\n\ncrete a c t i o n . Thus, even before the Leghorn Conference\n\nin 1921, Togliatti felt that a new party was needed.

A few days prior to |\n\nI I\n\n; the meeting a dispatch arrived from Moscow signed by Lenin, j\n\n! Trotsky, Zinoviev and Bukharin. It confirmed an earlier j\n\ndemand that the PSI oust the reformists and also the Ser-\n\n! rati-wing idiich wanted to adapt the Twenty-One Conditions\n\nI to the practical needs of Italy. It read: \"Whoso accepts\n\nI not the Third International without reservation, let him\n\n! be anathema.\" The pro-communist faction had already\n\nagreed that if they did not emerge victorious from the\n\ncongress, they would form their own party.\n\nAs the 8,000 delegates entered the Goldoni Theater,\n\nthey passed large portraits of the dead socialist heros,\n\nRosa Luxemberg, Dr. Karl Liebnecht and Jean Jaurès.\n\nAnticipating a possible clash between socialists\n\nand fascists, the government dispatched 1,000 Royal Guards\n\nand carabinieri to the area. Included among the delegates\n\nwere the Bulgarian Communist, Christo Kalakchein and the\n\n^New York Times, January 15, 1921, p; 3.\n\n13\n\n14^\n\nHungarian representative to the Comintern, Matyas Rukosi.\n\nZinoviev and Bukharin were planning to attend but were\n\nrefused passports by the Italian government, which was\n\nled in that year by a center coalition under Giovanni\n\nGiolitti.2 In 1920 the PSI, together with popolari or\n\nChristian Democrats, constituted the two rival mass parties.\n\nMembership in the PSI had risen from 50,000 before the war\n\nto over 200,000 in 1921 and trade union membership in the\n\nsocialist controlled Confederation of Labor was over two\n\nmillion. In addition to 156 seats in parliament, the\n\nsocialists controlled 2,000 municipalities and over one-\n\nthird of the provinces.^\n\nThe congress was opened by Nicola Bombacci, a deputy\n\nin the Italian Chamber and president of the PSI. Bombacci\n\nsketched the history of the party, eulogizing Rosa Luxem­\n\nburg and Karl Liebknecht as socialist martyrs. At this '\n\npoint pandemonium broke out. Cries of \"Hurrah for Commu­\n\nnism\" antagonized the right-wing socialists and a fierce |\n\nbattle of words ensued. In the confusion some of the ;\n\ndelegates stood on benches, gesticulating and shouting\n\nuntil they were exhausted. During the uproar fist fights\n\n^Martin Ebon, World Communism Today, (New York:\n\nWhittlesey House: McGraw Hill Book Co.,1948), p. 232.\n\n^Denis Mack Smith, Italy, A Modern History, (Ann\n\nArber: The University of Michigan Press, 1959), p. 327.\n\n_ _ I\n\n15i\n\nwere numerous and every mention of communism or socialism\n\nmet with cheering or protests from the opposing factions.\n\nFinally, Deputy Misinno raised a motion changing the sixth\n\nitem on the agenda--the question of the Third International\n\n--to the fourth item saying, \"there is but one fight, that\n\nof revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nAfter the motion was approved, the German communist, Paul\n\nI\n\nLevy, was permitted to speak, but Wilhelm Deltman, former ,\n\nvice president of the German Reichstag, was shouted down j\n\nby communist catcalls. The voice of the Turati reformists |\n\nwas expressed by the professor Baratono the following day i\n\nI\n\nwhen he advised, \"let us reply to Moscow that we see our |\n\nown situation through our own eyes,that we are for a ;\n\n5 I\n\ngreater unity than Moscow.\" Speaking for the Ordine NuovQ\n\non the other hand, was Terracini, the thirty-year-old law- ;\n\nyer and millionaire businessman. He urged violence and\n\nthe communist direction, but when Deputy Lazzari argued *\n\non the seventeenth for unity and against violence, all\n\nfactions participated in the ovation.

Immediately, Amadeo Bordiga mounted '\n\nI\n\nthe platform and pronounced the preconceived decision:\n\nThe communists are not going to check up, the votes, i\n\nbut they know there were irregularities in the voting.\n\n. . .

Almost two years later,\n\nin December of 1922, another split occurred in the PSI,\n\nI\n\n! with the reformists forming the Socialist Party of Italian\n\njworkers (PSLI) while the center left, under Pietro Nenni,\n\nj became the Maximalist Socialist Party (PSI).\n\ni At the second meeting of the PCI early in 1922, To-\n\nI\n\ngliatti became a member of the Central Committee in reward\n\nfor backing the \"Thesis of Rome,\" as set forth by Bordiga.\n\nThis thesis or strategy guide discredited the efforts of\n\nall non-communists to join the resistance to fascism.\n\nThesis number thirty-eight rejected any coalition with\n\nnon-communists in an anti-fascist government.Togliatti\n\n9\n\nPartito Comunista Italiana, Relazione del Comitato\n\nCentrale; Seconde Congresso Nazionale, (Rome: PCI, 1922), ,\n\npp. 4-6.

The PCI was ordered to carry on mass illegal\n\nwork promoting propaganda and strikes. In its attempts\n\nto comply, the PCI \"stuck its neck out and promptly had\n\nit chopped off.\"^^ in the spring of 1922 several communist\n\nleaders were arrested in Florence for plotting to recruit\n\na Red army from various youth organizations.

Bombacci had praised the Italo-\n\nRussian commercial treaty and referred to Mussolini's\n\ngovernment as a great revolutionary movement. Bombacci,\n\nwho charged that the move against him was based on personal\n\nhatreds, appealed to Moscow, which backed him with a slight\n\n13\n\nreprimand, but soon after he became a fascist.\n\nIn the beginning the party was preoccupied primarily\n\nwith gaining influence over the workers in the factories\n\nand defending itself from the fascists, who had ordered\n\nthe communists to suspend publication of their newspapers\n\non the grounds that they constituted a menace to public\n\norder.The communists reconstructed their squads and in­\n\nfiltrated the socialist controlled General Confederation\n\nof Labor (CGL).\n\n^^New York Times, December 6, 1923, p. 9, and May 4,\n\n1924, p.~%\n\n^^New York Times, December 13, 1923, p. 2.\n\n20\n\nBecause of Bordiga*s temporary imprisonment and the\n\nabsence of Gramsci, who was in Moscow in 1923, Togliatti\n\nbecame temporary head of the party after Gramsci recom-\n\nI mended him to Zinoviev and Bukharin. Togliatti, who was\n\nusing the name Ercole Ercoli, set up his headquarters at\n\ni Angera on Lake Maggiore. According to the records of the\n\nsecret police, there were at this time 9,619 Italian\n\ncommunists in Italy and 9,394 in France.Togliatti*s\n\npowers as provisional party head did not go completely\n\nuncontested. In the July 1923 issue of **Avanti,' * he was\n\npersonally attacked as \"dictator of the party** by Andrea\n\nViglono. Togliatti solved the problem by expelling\n\nViglono from the party. In a second letter to **Avanti'*\n\nViglono reiterated his charges saying:\n\nInvested by whom, no one really knows, Togliatti\n\nhas concentrated in his hands every deliberative\n\nand executive power. The same circumstances that\n\nhave been fatal to his comrades in this struggle\n\nhave made him the undiscussable and indisputable\n\ndirector of the communist party of Italy ....\n\nIn the party no one does anything without the\n\norders of an individual, who has not even rendered\n\nsufficient proof of his position to give them.\n\nCertainly there are, in fact, deficiencies in this\n\nman as a revolutionary head and great are his\n\ndefects, the principal of which is a marked\n\ntendency to elusiveness. When the times are most\n\ndifficult and, therefore, more rapid and indis­\n\npensable must be the decisions, Togliatti, who is\n\nthe only one who wants to be in a position to make\n\nthem, is never where he ought to be and his com­\n\nrades can never find him. . . .16\n\n^^Bellini and Galli, op. cit., p. 97.\n\n^^Ibld., p. 99.\n\n21 I\n\nI\n\nIt was precisely his \"elusiveness** which allowed Togliatti |\n\nto elude the police and remain a leader of the PCI. Since ,\n\nI\n\nTogliatti was in hiding when Gramsci appointed him pro­\n\nvisional head of the party, an article was printed in the\n\nsocialist paper **Avanti** instructing him to communicate 1\n\nat once with the Executive of the party. However, in i\n\nthese early years, Togliatti*s ability to adapt to the\n\nclandestine life occasioned by the rise of fascism, was ;\n\ninterpreted by many communists as excessive prudence and ,\n\nhesitancy. As the ex-communist, Piero Giobetti, put it,\n\n**Finding himself in a position of high responsibility,\n\ni\n\nTogliatti was dominated by a restlessness that seemed\n\ninexorably cynical and tyrannical . . . . **^^\n\nIn 1924, Togliatti married Rita Montagnana, a former |\n\nTurin dressmaker ixho had represented the Communist Women* s ;\n\n1\n\nOrganization at the Fourth International Congress in\n\nMoscow. The fact that he attended the Fifth International ^\n\nCongress with Bordiga and became a member of the presidium j\n\nI\n\nwas evidence of his new importance. The Russian leaders i\n\nat the congress were primarily concerned with denouncing\n\nthe tactics of Heinrich Brandler, head of the German\n\nCommunist Party (KPD). Brandler had attempted to unite\n\nwith the socialists in a popular front, but the results\n\n1^Avant1. April 12, 1923 (Milan).\n\n^^Bellini and Galli, op. cit.. p. 101.\n\n22 I\n\n!\n\nwere disastrous for his party. Zinoviev, however, did not i\n\nattack the strategy of a popular front but only the way |\n\ni\n\nBrandler had applied it and he criticized Bordiga*s anti- j\n\nfront position urging him to unite the PCX with the left I\n\nI\n\nwing of the Italian Socialist Party. Although Bordiga !\n\ndefended his position energetically, the congress appoint- !\n\ned a new Central Committee for the PCI that included only ,\n\n19 i\n\npopular front supporters like Togliatti. ]\n\nTogliatti later justified the shift from isolation- |\n\nism to a popular front tactic by explaining that it had\n\nalways been promulgated by both Marx and Gramsci.\n\nAccording to Gramsci, the application of Marxist\n\nand Leninist principles must always be adapted to\n\nthe exigencies of political action and the principal\n\ncanon of these was never to isolate the party from\n\nthe masses, never to be content either with dogmatic\n\nformula of propaganda, nor to wait passively for\n\nevents, . . . where possible to unite with the\n\nworkers front, . . . to reach the proposed object­\n\nives. These are the norms of political and tactical\n\nstrategy that Marx and Lenin had taught the working ,\n\nclasses.20 j\n\nAt the same time Togliatti explained his own previous\n\ninvective against the socialists by maintaining that,\n\nwhen the break with the PSI occurred, the revolutionary\n\nmovement had passed its high point. The workers had al­\n\nready occupied the factories and when the socialists\n\nl^ibld., p. 136.\n\n^®Togllattl, II Partlto, op. cit., p. 52.\n\n23\n\nfailed to act, a feeling of skepticism had already dif­\n\nfused among the masses so that a pretense of unification\n\nof the factions of the party would have served no pur-\n\n21\n\npose. In this way, Togliatti absolved the communists\n\nfrom charges that their break with the socialists weakened\n\nthe revolutionary movement at the critical moment.\n\nIn keeping with this new strategy of a popular\n\nfront, the PCI joined the other fascist opposition in\n\nseceding from Parliament. In June of 1924 the liberals\n\nI\n\nand socialists had withdrawn from Parliament as a protest\n\nagainst the murder of Deputy Giacomo Matteotti by fascist\n\nbands a few days following his criticisms of Mussolini* s\n\nillegal methods. Faced with a solid fascist majority\n\nanyway, most of the opposition abandoned the Chamber in\n\nwhat became known as the Aventine secession, named after ;\n\na protest group in ancient Roman history which had with-\n\n22\n\ndrawn to the Aventine hill. With only a handful of j\n\nliberals and communists left in Parliament, Mussolini :\n\neasily won a vote of confidence. When Gramsci noted that j\n\nI\n\nthe Aventine bloc was winning popular sympathy, he led j\n\nthe PCI out of Parliament too. The communists invited the ^\n\nI\n\nother fascist opposition to form a new assembly but the |\n\n1\n\nprogram which they outlined was considered too radical, !\n\n_____ I\n\n^^Ibid., pp.39-51 passim.\n\n^^Smith, op. cit., pp. 380-82\n\n24\n\nso that the PCI actually remained outside both Parliament\n\nand the Aventine. In November, however, they returned\n\nto Mussolini* s Parliament when the Aventine failed to be­\n\ncome an effective legislature. Togliatti, nontheless\n\nmaintained the necessity of their participation in the\n\nsecession in order to keep the PCI*s identification with\n\nthe masses.23\n\nThe following year Togliatti was included in another\n\ngeneral round up of communists and arrested after being\n\ndiscovered in Florence at a secret meeting for the organi­\n\nzation of youth squads. A general amnesty on the anni­\n\nversary of the King* s coronation, however, left him free\n\na few months later to join his wife and newly born son,\n\nAldo. In 1926 he attended the Seventh International\n\nCongress in Moscow where he joined the permanent secre­\n\ntariat of the Comintern and received Soviet backing to\n\noust the PCI Secretary, Bordiga, who was opposed to\n\ncollaboration with the PSI in any kind of a united front.\n\nBordiga also insisted that opposition in Parliament was\n\nfutile and recommended communist abstention from it. He\n\nurged instead that the labor syndicates seize power by\n\nrevolutionary violence when, in actuality, the party still\n\nlacked sufficient influence over the workers to accomplish\n\n23\n\nPalmiro Togliatti, Per la liberta e 1 independenza\n\nd* Italia: relazione della direz ione del !PCI a V Congres so\"\n\nXRome: PCI, 1945), pp. 1-4.\n\n25\n\nsuch a task. Recognizing this fact, both Gramsci and\n\nTogliatti solicited the backing of Zinoviev and Bukharin\n\nin ousting Bordiga. In 1924, Mauro Scoccimarro, one of\n\nGramsci*s aids and an Italian representative to the Comin­\n\ntern, prepared an indictment against the **Bordigist\n\n24\n\nheresy’* which denounced him as a *’ narrow sectarian. * *\n\nA vote of the Central Committee soon after, however, re­\n\nsulted in a defeat for Gramsci and Togliatti. Five\n\nfederations supported them while thirty-five supported\n\ni the Bordiga \"thesis of Rome.\" Togliatti blamed the\n\nI\n\nI defeat on Gramsci who should have, he wrote, battled\n\nI\n\n! openly against Bordiga prior to the meeting. At a party\n\ni convention at Lake Como in May 1924, Bordiga*s position\n\nwas upheld again. Togliatti had \"methodically\" read his\n\nI speech at Como from a dossier in front of him. \"His voice\n\nj had no special modulations nor rhetorical inflammation to\n\nI\n\nclinch, . . . the political line of a united front that\n\nhad been formulated by the congresses of the Inter­\n\nnational.\" Togliatti insisted on the new line because\n\nit was the strategy urged by Moscow but added that:\n\nI also insist, if permitted, because this is my\n\npersonal conviction and such it would remain even\n\nif by chance it ceases to be yours.\n\nAt this point Bordiga interrupted Togliatti saying, \"At\n\nthe Second Congress, you didn*t share any such sentiments.\n\n24\n\nGarosci, op. cit., p. 167.\n\n26 :\n\nYou didn’t even think this way. Why have you voted for\n\nthe ’thesis of Rome* that was explicitly against the |\n\n1\n\nunited front?** Togliatti replied that times had changed |\n\n1\n\nwhile Bordiga insisted that Togliatti had not accepted the i\n\nI\n\nnew strategy in good faith but in \"aquiescence to the will |\n\nof the International.**^^ Bordiga had temporarily won the |\n\nstruggle against unification with the socialists and at\n\nI\n\nthe Fifth Plenum of the Comintern Executive in Moscow, 1\n\nI\n\nTogliatti shifted the blame to the International. |\n\nI\n\nWe still hold today that it was an error for the '\n\nComintern to put the task of fusion (with PSI) to ,\n\nour party several months after its constitution, !\n\nwhen the line conscientiously followed until then |\n\nhad been completely diverse. But the Comintern '\n\nalso commits errors .... It is from such that ;\n\nthere are the uncertainties, the oscillations\n\nthe clamorous failures for which now our party\n\nmust pay the penalty.2o I\n\nI\n\nAs a result of the Lake Como Convention the defeated ,\n\nI\n\nfaction decided to intensify the struggle against the !\n\nBordigian ideology on the \"grounds of principle** and **to j\n\novercome the visual narrowness of Bordighianism\" they i\n\nI\n\nrecognized the need to work with not only the proletariat |\n\n97 I\n\nbut the petit bourgeoisie as well.At the Third Party j\n\n,\n\nBellini and Galli, op. cit., p. 118.\n\n26 '\n\nGiuseppe Tamburrano, Antonio Grynsci: La Vita, II\n\nPensiero, L*Azione (Perugia: Lacaita Editore,1963), p. 140.\n\n97 '\n\n'Palmiro Togliatti, La Seconda Conferenza del\n\nPartito Comunista d*Italia (n.p., PCI, 1928), p. v. i\n\n27\n\nCongress in Lyons in January,1926, sixty delegates who had\n\ncrossed the frontier in disguise, expelled Bordiga from\n\nthe Central Committee and Gramsci became Secretary-General.\n\nThe Congress issued the **Lyons thesis\" that the PCI must\n\nnot abstain from supporting and joining in united action\n\nwith other fascist opposition. Bordiga went to Moscow\n\nwith Togliatti in February of 1926 for the Sixth Plenum\n\nof the International of which he was still a delegate.\n\nBordiga appealed his case but Togliatti, who reaffirmed\n\nthe necessity for discipline and collaboration with Russia,\n\nasked the Comintern to reject Bordiga*s demand to declare\n\nthe results of the PCI Third Congress invalid. Bordiga*s\n\nplea was denied. He was allowed to keep his party card\n\nbut in 1930 he was imprisoned by the fascists and then\n\nexpelled from the PCI for Trotskyite leanings. In 1937,\n\nTogliatti said of the first secretary of the PCI, \"Bordiga\n\nlives tranquilly as a Trotskian dog, protected by police\n\n28\n\nand hated by the workers as a traitor is hated.\"\n\nIn addition to clarifying the party ideology that\n\nbrought the inner party struggles to an end, the Third\n\nParty Congress formed agitation committees to hold illegal\n\nfactory meetings to work for an eight hour day, protest\n\nagainst war, and organize peasants into an agricultural\n\nlaborers union. Their program included a united front\n\n^%ellini and Galli, op. cit., p. 193.\n\n28\n\nwith left-wing socialists, defense of the trade unions,\n\nand distribution of land to the peasants. In the fall of\n\n1926 the party accomplished the fusion with the left-wing\n\nor maximalist socialists under Nenni, which brought in\n\n2,550 additional m e m b e r s .29\n\nFurther plans were interrupted abruptly when the\n\nfirst of Mussolini’s \"exceptional degrees\" deprived the\n\ncommunists of their seats in Parliament in November of\n\n1926. The same month Gramsci, Terracini, Scoccimarro and\n\nothers were arrested in spite of their Parliamentary\n\nimmunities and sentenced to an average of twenty-three\n\nyears imprisonment. Togliatti, Wio was in Moscow for the\n\nSixth International Congress, escaped arrest but was\n\nindicted along with thirty-seven others for being an\n\nexponent of the PCI and for attempting to establish a\n\nrevolutionary army of workers and peasants for the purpose\n\nof making an armed uprising against the state and violent­\n\nly establishing the Italian Republic of the Soviets.\n\nSince police reports showed that he had organized groups\n\nof communists in France, the Special Tribunal concluded\n\nthat Togliatti was of particular importance and, hence,\n\ngreatly responsible for the criminal acts of the party.\n\n29committee on Un-American Activities, ed., The Com­\n\nmunist Conspiracy: Strategy and Tactics of World Communism,\n\nPart I, Section D, Exhibit No/ 67, 1956, p. 337.\n\n^^Antonio Gramsci, II Partito Comunista d*Italia\n\ndavanti al Tribunale Sepciale fascista %n.p 7 PCI, 19^8),\n\npassim.\n\n29\n\nAfter the November arrests, minor officials of the\n\nother opposition parties either recanted or went abroad.\n\nThe socialists Claudio Treves, Giuseppe Saragat and Pietro i\n\nNenni went to Switzerland, Turati to Corsica and the |\n\nPopular Party leader, Don Sturzo, to Paris. When Togliatti\n\nleft Italy in 1926, he did not know that he would not re- j\n\nj turn for eighteen years. These first five years in the |\n\n1 PCI, however, taught Togliatti two valuable lessons. Firsts'\n\nI the Bordiga-Gramsci struggle had demonstrated the necessity!\n\n; of Moscow* s backing for any political maneuvers within the '\n\n* PCI and second, fascist methods of suppression gave\n\n1 ;\n\n; Togliatti experience in the art of survival— experience\n\nwhich would prove useful in the years ahead.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE PCI UNDERGROUND\n\nBy the end of 1926 membership in the PCI had de­\n\nclined but its influence had increased. A foreign center\n\nhad already been established, first at Zurich and later\n\nat Paris, while the internal center of underground acti­\n\nvities in Italy remained at Milan. After Gramsci*s arrest\n\nin 1926, Togliatti was invested by the International with\n\nthe leadership of the party. When he returned to Moscow\n\nin 1928, the Paris center was left in the hands of Angelo\n\nTasca, known as \"Serra\" and Ruggiero Grieco or \"Garlandi.\"\n\nThey in turn gave orders to the Milan center which was\n\nlocated in an apartment of Pietro Tresso. Alfonso\n\nLeonetti was left in charge of the PCI publications, which\n\ncontinued to circulate in northern industrial centers.\n\nBeginning in 1927, \"L*Unita** appeared once a month and was\n\ndistributed at night in Turin, Milan and Rome. \"Battaglie\n\nSindacali** and **Stato Operaio** with over 1,000 subscrip­\n\ntions were circulated among the workers. Still, in these\n\nyears of exile, the communists did not have control over\n\nI\n\nthe workers * movement. Although the party called a strike j\n\nI\n\nof rice workers in the Po Valley in June of 1927 to pro- |\n\ntest the fascist deflation of the Italian lira, the strike |\n\nI\n\nfailed and there were no more labor incidents until the I\n\n3 0 i\n\n31 :\n\ndepression, possibly because the workers knew not what\n\nfascism would bring and still had an \"attitude of hopeful\n\nI\n\nexpectancy.\" Nontheless, with the slogan: \"Leave the |\n\nfascist syndicates! Join the CGXL.\" the communists at­\n\ntempted to woo the workers into a communist-socialist |\n\ndominated union, the General Confederation of Labor\n\nI\n\nj (CGIL).l\n\nj The internal center gave orders in turn to the\n\nI !\n\nI regional secretariats and to Pietro Secchia, head of the\n\ni Communist Youth Federation. The party made use of false\n\ndocuments, forged passports and other secret apparatus,\n\nwhich had been set up prior to the PCX’s expulsion from |\n\nItaly. However, within two years several successive heads !\n\nof the Milan center were arrested by the OVRÂ (Inspectorate\n\nof Public Security) along with inter-regional chiefs and j\n\nCentral Committee personnel. In 1927 Togliatti and Luigi\n\nLongo taught the PCI agents at a school in the mountains I\n\nI\n\nI of Switzerland until, after several arrests and releases, !\n\nI o\n\n; they were expelled from the country.^\n\nOther fascist-opposition parties also set up centers\n\nin France and Switzerland, some collaborating in their\n\ni\n\nanti-fascist activities. For example. Carlo Roselli of '\n\nthe Unitarian Socialist Party (PSU), attempted to create\n\n^Delzell, op. cit., pp. 116-119.\n\n2\n\nFerrara and Ferrara, op. cit., p. 288.\n\n32\n\na \"revolutionary force which would rival the fascists in\n\nits mass appeal . . . with a democratic-republie as its\n\neventual goal. In the first years of their exile, the\n\ncommunists remained aloof from such coalitions labeling\n\nthem \"social fascists.\" Togliatti contemptuously viewed\n\nRoselli*s plan as \"superficial, out-dated . . . fascist-\n\n/\n\nlike criticism of Marxism.\"\n\nAlthough Togliatti may actually have preferred an\n\nanti-fascist alliance with other parties of the left, he\n\nundoubtedly deemed it prudent to wait for sanction from\n\nthe International. When Tasca, who was also on the\n\nExecutive Committee of the Comintern, criticized the non­\n\ncollaboration policy along with Stalin* s German policy, it\n\nwas taken as a denial that an economic crisis was imminent\n\nin the capitalist system. Tasca also sided with Bukharin\n\nin his dispute with Stalin over the liquidation of the\n\nwealthy peasants or kulaks in Russia. For such mistakes,\n\nTasca, the former school-mate and one of the founders of\n\nthe \"Ordine Nuovo,\" was expelled from the party in 1929\n\nand imprisoned by the fascists the following year. The\n\nComintern also wanted to replace Togliatti with Ignazio\n\nSilone because he was suspected of 'Bukharin-like vacilla-\n\nDelzell, op. cit., p. 63.\n\n^Palmiro Togliatti, \"Sul movimento di Giustizia e\n\nLiberta,\" Stato Operaio (Paris: PCI, September, 1931),\n\nquoted in Delzell, ibici., p. 463.\n\n33\n\ntion,\" but, fortunately for Togliatti, Silone was recu­\n\nperating from an illness in Switzerland.^ Togliatti was\n\nperceptive enough to sense the direction of the power\n\nstruggle in Moscow and, at the Thirteenth Plenum in 1933,\n\nhe swept away any doubt of his own leanings by stating,\n\n\"We have a guide. Comrade Stalin, who continues in the\n\nfield of theory and practice the great cause of the revo­\n\nlutionary leadership of Marx and Lenin.When Tresso,\n\nLeonetti and Paolo Ravazzoli also expressed doubt that a\n\nrevolutionary situation was imminent in Italy, Togliatti\n\ndid not hesitate to expel such \"revisionists\" from the\n\nparty.^\n\nAccording to Ignazio Silone in The God that Failed,\n\nalthough Togliatti generally accepted all of Stalin's\n\ndirectives, he disliked the arbitrary methods of the\n\nInternational and recognized the duplicity and demorali­\n\nzation among its personnel. At the Sixth Congress of the\n\nComintern, when Stalin prescribed the tactic of non-\n\ncSollaboration with other fascist opposition, Togliatti had\n\n^Fulvio Bellini, \"The Italian CP: The Transformation\n\nof a party, 1921-1945,\" Problems of Communism, I (January-\n\nFebruary, 1956), p. 36.\n\n^Kermit E.

As no one else asked to speak, after\n\nconsulting Togliatti, I made my apologies for having\n\narrived late and so, not having been able to see the\n\ndocument which was to be condemned. \"To tell the\n\ntruth,\" Thaelmann declared candidly, \"we haven't seen\n\nthe document either .... \"The Political Office of\n\nthe party,\" said Stalin, \"has considered it would not\n\nbe expedient to translate and distribute Trotsky's\n\ndocument . . . because there are various allusions\n\nin it to the policy of the Soviet State.\" . . . After\n\nconsulting Togliatti, I declared: \"Before taking\n\nthe resolution into consideration, we must see the\n\ndocument\" .... \"The proposed resolution is with­\n\ndrawn\" said Stalin ....\n\nAs a reprisal for our impertinent conduct, those\n\n“1\n\n35 !\n\nfanatical censors discovered that the fundamental\n\nguiding lines of our activity . . . were seriously\n\ncontaminated by a petty-bourgeois spirit.° ,\n\nAfter the meeting Togliatti suggested to Silone that they |\n\naddress a letter to the Political Office of the Soviet |\n\nparty (CPSU) explaining the reasons for their attitude at |\n\nthe meeting. The letter stated that: I\n\nNo communist would presume to question the historical j\n\npreeminence of our Russian comrades in the leadership j\n\nof the International; but this preeminence imposed |\n\nspecial duties on our Russian comrades ; they could\n\nnot apply the rights it gave them in a mechanical\n\nand authoritarian way.^\n\ni Silone explains that the letter was received by Bukharin,\n\nI\n\nwho sent for him and Togliatti and advised them to with­\n\ndraw it so as not to worsen their already appalling poli­\n\ntical situation. When Silone read in Berlin that the 1\n\nInternational had severely rebuked Trotsky for the document,|\n\nThaelmann explained to him that the Presidium, which in­\n\ncluded Togliatti, could adopt any resolution in the name\n\nof the Executive Committee. Soon after Togliatti ex­\n\nplained to Silone his reasons for condemning the unseen\n\ndocument at the Presidium. The present state of the\n\nInternational, he said, was \"certainly neither satisfactory\n\nnor agreeable. But all our good intentions were powerless\n\nto change it; objective historical conditions were in-\n\n^Ignazio Silone, The God that Failed, ed. by Richard\n\nCrossman, (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1949), pp. 105-110.\n\n^Ibld..p. 112.\n\n36\n\nvolved and must be taken into account. The forms of the\n\nProletarian Revolution were not arbitrary\" and if \"they\n\ndid not accord with our preference, so much the worse for\n\nus.\" Besides, added Togliatti, \"What alternative remain­\n\ned? Other communists who had broken with the party, how\n\nhad they ended up?\"^^\n\nThus, Silone, who was expelled from the party in\n\n1931, demonstrates that Togliatti's willingness to accept\n\nthe Stalinist authoritarianism was based on the exigency\n\nfor survival. According to Giorgio Galli in La Sinistra\n\nitaliano nel dopoguerra, only from this meeting did the\n\nleader of the PCI accept in open form all the directions\n\nof Moscow in connection with the defeat of Bukharin, es­\n\ntablishing a procedure which the leading group of the PCI\n\nwould follow scrupulously.^^ The small nucleus of the\n\nPCI realized full well that it carried on its political\n\nactivity thanks only to the aid of Moscow, a situation\n\nwhich would not change until after World War II.\n\nI\n\nI In addition to the problems created by working in\n\ni the underground, the PCI Central Committee found itself\n\nI\n\n; in the middle of a new crisis. Believing that the advent\n\nof the world wide depression was an omen signifying a\n\ncapitalist collapse, Togliatti proposed that the majority\n\nl°Ibid.. p. 112.\n\n^^Giorgio Galli, La Sinistra italiano nel dopoguerra\n\ni (Bologna: II Mulino, 1958), p. Ï28.\n\n37 I\n\nof the party in exile return to Italy to prepare for a\n\ntake over. Although the top three in Milan opposed the\n\nI\n\nI proposal, Togliatti was supported by Longo, Ravera and\n\nI Secchia, who broke the tie vote. The Milan trio was, i\n\ntherefore, replaced by Luigi, Frausin, Luigi Amadesi and |\n\nj Giuseppe Di Vittorio. According to Secchia \"the crisis\n\nof the directing center of the party was the gravest that\n\nthe PCI had ever passed through and was overcome and\n\nliquidated rapidly thanks especially to the work of\n\nPalmiro Togliatti and to the aid of the Communist Inter-\n\n1 n\n\nnational.\" Secchia's statement clearly indicates that\n\nI ■ :\n\nj the expulsion of the opposition in the party was ordered\n\nj by Moscow.\n\nI\n\nI New cells were also established at Naples under\n\n; Giorgio Amendola and Dr. Eugenio Reale, By October 1930,\n\nI i\n\nI however, the police had caught all but Reale. When\n\nI several leaders, including Camilla Ravera and Vincenzo ^\n\nj Moscatelli were caught in Milan, Togliatti sent Secchia to |\n\n!\n\nI reorganize the Milan center until he too was arrested in\n\nI March 1931.^^\n\nI\n\nI By the Fourth Congress of the PCI, which met near\n\nj Düsseldorf, Germany, in April 1931, Togliatti recognized\n\nI that they had overestimated the chances for a revolution.\n\n! 1 o\n\nPietro Secchia, \"Rinascita\" (Rome: PCI, March\n\n! 1953), quoted in Delzell, op. cit., p. 124.\n\n^^Delzell, ibid., p. 127.\n\n38\n\nThe theses of the Congress, nevertheless, called for a\n\nworkers' insurrection for the destruction of fascism and\n\na dictatorship of the proletariat. They continued to de­\n\nnounce the socialist leaders Nenni and Giuseppe Saragat\n\nand the anti-fascist coalitions. A new Central Committee\n\nwas also elected with Togliatti at its head. He succes­\n\nsively appointed Battista Santhia, Frausin and Carlo\n\nPajetta to the Milan center. All were arrested by the\n\nOVRA so that 1934 \"marked the definite liquidation of\n\nevery organized communist activity in the peninsula . .\n\n. . Realizing that their \"previous tactics of hostility:\n\ntoward not only bourgeois but socialist parties . . . had |\n\n1 Q I\n\nsimply hastened Hitler's victory\"^ Togliatti became one j\n\nI\n\nof the strongest advocates of a popular front policy.\n\n' ;\n\n^ In the spring of 1934 he conducted talks with Nenni,\n\nj leader of the center-left socialists and Saragat, the\n\nI leader of the right-wing socialists. Three months later,\n\nj on August 17, 1934, they concluded the first of many\n\n\"unity of action\" pacts that created the united front.\n\nThus, Togliatti removed the PCI from its isolation. The\n\npreamble to the pact recognized fundamental differences\n\nin the doctrine, methods and tactics of the two parties.\n\nTogether they published in Paris the \"Grido del popolo\"\n\nI ^^Ibid., p. 129, and Bellini and Galli, op. cit.,\n\np. 307.\n\n^^Ibid., p. 82.\n\n39\n\nwhich was edited by Teresa Noce, the wife of Luigi Longo.\n\nThe new coalition conducted demonstrations in Paris and\n\ncalled for abolition of Mussolini's Special Tribunal and\n\namnesties for political prisoners like Antonio Gramsci.\n\nAt the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935 Togliatti\n\nbecame a permanent member of the Political Secretariat of\n\nthe Comintern along with Manuilsky, Gottwald and Pieck\n\nI\n\nI with Dimitrov as Secretary-General. Along with Stalin,\n\nI\n\nI Bukharin, Rykov, Molotov and Thorez, the PCI leader out­\n\nlined the program for the Seventh Congress. In a diplo-\n\nI\n\nI matic move, Togliatti proposed that the congress address\n\nStalin as \"Comrade Stalin, the leader, teacher of the\n\n1 ' - J\n\nproletariat and of the oppressed of the whole world.\"\n\nThis motion was applauded and followed by a speech deli­\n\nvered by Dimitrov who approved the new communist-socialist\n\npact and emphasized that Social Democrats must no longer\n\nbe smeared as \"Social Fascists.\" To Dimitrov's speech,\n\nTogliatti added, \"From the theoretical point of view,\n\nthere is no doubt about the possibility of the Bolsheviks\n\ncollaborating with capitalist states, even on the level\n\n18\n\nof military cooperation.\" Then, explaining the need for\n\nGunther Nollau, International Communism and World\n\nRevolution (London: Hollis and Carter, 1961), p. 123.\n\n^^Delzell, op. cit., p. 132, and Bellini and Galli,\n\nop. cit., pp. 310 and 3ll.\n\n40\n\nthe popular front and even identification with bourgeois\n\ninstitutions, Togliatti said:\n\nWhy do we defend bourgeois-democratic liberties?\n\nPrimarily because we . . . have no other interests\n\nthan those of the whole proletariat. We are quite\n\nwell aware that, however reactionary the real essence\n\nof the bourgeois-democratic regime, it is still better\n\nfor the working class than open fascist dictatorship.^^\n\nThen in a foreshadowing of what, in later years, would be\n\nI announced as an \"Italian road\" to socialism, he denied the\n\n1\n\n! necessity for a similarity in tactics between the PCI and\n\n! those of the Russian party:\n\nI But this identity of aim by no means signified that\n\nat every given moment there must be complete coinci­\n\ndence in all acts and in all questions between the\n\ntactics of the proletariat and communist parties\n\nthat are still struggling for power and the concrete\n\ntactical measures of the Soviet proletariat and the\n\nCPSU, which already have the power in their hands\n\nin the Soviet U n i o n . 20\n\nThus, within a year after Hitler came to power the stra­\n\ntegy of the Comintern had changed from one of revolutionary\n\nextremism to the popular front.\n\nThe popular front sponsored anti-fascist demon­\n\nstrations in Brussels to protest Mussolini's invasion of\n\nEthiopia and called for support in the League of Nations\n\nfor economic, but not military, sanctions against Italy.\n\nTogliatti opposed military sanctions on the basis that\n\nl^Degras, op. cit., p. 349.\n\n^^McKenzie, op. cit., p. 95.\n\n41\n\nthey would drag the proletariat of Great Britain into war\n\n21\n\nagainst Italy. At the same time, however, he maintained\n\nthat in cases of attack by another nation, that is, in\n\nwars of national defense among capitalist states, the\n\nproletarian must identify himself with the cause of free­\n\ndom and defend his c o u n t r y .^2\n\nThe following year, however, it was necessary for\n\nTogliatti to make an about face. In accordance with Soviet\n\nforeign policy, which in that year w^s attempting to iso­\n\nlate Germany by strengthening relations with Italy and\n\nFrance, Togliatti offered reconciliation with the fascists\n\nin order to mollify Italian relations with Russia. As\n\nTogliatti put it, \"We desire that Italy conclude mutual\n\nassistance pacts with all our neighbors especially with\n\n23\n\nFrapce\" and with \"the Soviet Union.\" And in September\n\nof 1936 a communique was sent to Mussolini titled,\"For the\n\nSalvation of Italy and the Reconciliation of the Italian\n\npeople\" which stated:\n\nWe communists are adapting the Fascist program of\n\n1919, a program of peace, freedom and defense of\n\nthe worker's interests. Blackshirts and veterans\n\nof Africa, we call on you to unite in fighting for\n\nthis program .... We proclaim that we are ready\n\nto fight beside you.

No one was more aware of this\n\nthan Togliatti himself who, although an intellectual, was\n\nabove all a political realist, and his adaptation to the\n\nStalinist line, which Tasca condemned as a betrayal of\n\n27\n\nGramscian liberalism and idealism, was fundamentally\n\n25\n\nMaurizio Milan and Fausto Vighi, La resistenza al\n\nfascismo (Milan: Feltrinelli, 1962),p. 34.\n\n26\n\nTogliatti, II Partito, op. cit.» p. 60.\n\n! 27\n\nAngelo Tasca, Nascita del Fascism (Florence: La\n\nNuova Italia, n.d.), pi H\n\n43\n\nconsistent with his primary aim of securing his own posi­\n\ntion in these years.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE POPULAR FRONT IN ACTION\n\nj The popular front undertook the task of aiding the |\n\nI republican government in Spain against Franco in the i\n\nI Spanish Civil War. Writing under the pseudonym of i\n\n! :\n\nI \"M. Ercoli,\" Togliatti explained in 1934 the need for such\n\nI\n\n! a front, not only with socialists, but with the petty\n\n! i\n\nbourgeoisie as well, by differentiating the Spanish\n\nI I\n\nI Revolution from the Russian Revolution of 1917. He\n\nI\n\nI\n\n! described the Spanish Revolution as a bourgeois-democratic ,\n\nI\n\n! revolution against the aristocracy, the privileged and\n\nI\n\nt other feudal remnants. Conditions peculiar to Spain\n\nI i\n\nj necessitated tactics diverged from those of the Russian\n\nI\n\nRevolutionaries. Three facts distinguished the Spanish ■\n\nsituation:\n\nIn the first place the working class of Spain\n\noverthrew the monarchy in 1931, before there was\n\na real mass Communist Party.\n\nIn the second place, while in the process of the\n\nRevolution, a mass Communist Party was taking\n\nshape but the Spanish proletariat remained under\n\nthe powerful influence of the Socialist Party.\n\nIn the third place— and this distinguishes Spain\n\nfrom all other countries of Europe--the Spanish\n\nproletariat has also mass Anarcho-Syndicalist\n\norganizations in addition to the Communist and\n\n44\n\n45\n\nSocialist Parties\n\nAlthough these other parties hindered the People's Front\n\nwith hasty projects like \"compulsory collectivization,\"\n\n\"abolition of money\" and \"organized indiscipline,\" these\n\norganizations and even the bourgeoisie had fought against\n\nfascism, so that to gain influence the communist party\n\nmust, said Togliatti, identify with this struggle and\n\ntransform itself into a mass party that would include the\n\nSocialist Party of Workers, the Union of Syndicalists,\n\nthe Anarchist National Confederation of Labor, the Republi-\n\n2\n\ncan Party of Azana and the Catalonian Party.\n\nTogliatti found support for this thesis in the\n\nwritings of Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci died on April 27,\n\n1937, after spending much time in government hospitals\n\nwith tuberculosis. He died of uremic poisoning while\n\nstill technically incarcerated. While in prison, Gramsci\n\npublished numerous polemics and wrote letters to his\n\nRussian born wife. In Quaderni del Carcere Gramsci said\n\nthat fascism was typical of great landowners but did not\n\nattack the general bourgeoisie, leaving open the possi­\n\nbility for a united front. Actually, Togliatti was merely\n\nreaffirming the resolutions of the Twelfth Plenum of the\n\n^M.

The 1\n\nnew UPI launched \"La Voce degli Italiani\" that circulated [\n\namong immigrants in Western Europe and signed a pact with\n\nthe Spanish loyalists to aid them militarily with the j\n\nGaribaldi Brigade that was organized in 1935 under the I\n\nI\n\nleadership of Randolfo Pacciardi of the Italian Republican \\\n\nParty. After Pacciardi resigned, the leadership of the j\n\nBrigade passed to the communist, Luigi Longo.^ j\n\nI\n\nAfter the Seventh Comintern Congress, Togliatti re­\n\nmained in Moscow as secretary of the Comintern and the\n\nI\n\nhead of the Central European Communist Parties including )\n\nGermany, Poland and Czechoslavakia. In Moscow he became ^\n\na Russian citizen and took over the duties of Waldemar\n\nKnorin who had disappeared in the Stalin purges. Shortly\n\nafterwards, however, he was replaced by Clement Gottwald\n\nand sent to Spain as the Comintern Chief Emissary to the\n\nLoyalists. While in Moscow, Togliatti had already met\n\n^McKenzie, op. cit., p. 78.\n\n^Delzell, op. cit., pp. 133, 152, 161.\n\n47\n\nother agents working with the loyalists including Julio\n\nAlvarez del Vayo, Dr. Marteaux and Jesus Hernandez. He\n\narrived in Spain in August of 1937 under the name\n\n\"Alfredo\" with the task of unifying the leadership of\n\nthe International Brigades which up to this time tended\n\nto follow their own separate disciplines. Before\n\nTogliatti's arrival, his chief representative in Spain was\n\nHeinz Neumann, a veteran of the German and Chinese revolu­\n\ntions, and then Vittorio Codovilla, an Argentine of\n\nI Italian origin. According to Hugh Thomas in The Spanish\n\nI Civil War,however, the Comintern was not aiming for a\n\nI communist victory in 1937 because such a victory would\n\nI\n\n; have alarmed France and Great Britain whom Russia was\n\n1\n\ni attempting to draw closer to in order to isolate Germany.\n\nj\n\n;\"For this reason\" Thomas says:\n\nRussia did not send arms to Spain in the first years\n\nof the Civil War but only food and raw materials and\n\nfor these reasons Stalin probably did not send orders\n\nto the Spanish Communist Party and his chief agents\n\nthere, Codovilla and Stepanov, to make full use of\n\ntheir opportunity to gain control of the Spanish\n\nRepublic.5\n\nYet it was precisely at this time that the Spanish\n\nSocialist Party, directed by Largo Caballero, chose to\n\nhead violently leftwards. The Spanish communists were,\n\ntherefore, forced, in order to extend their influence over\n\n^Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (London: Eyre &\n\nSpottiswoods Ltd., 1961), pp. 73 and 215.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n48\n\nthe \"now impressionable socialists to adopt a position\n\nconsiderably to the left of the policy favored by the\n\nComintern and by the Soviet government.\n\nBesides Togliatti, the Comintern team included the\n\nFrench communist Jacques Duclos and the Italian Vittorio\n\nVadali (\"Cardos Contreras\") and the Hungarian Erno Gero.\n\nThe Comintern had set aside a thousand-million francs to\n\naid the Spanish government with nine-tenths contributed\n\nby the Soviet Union. The money was administered by a\n\ncommittee including Thorez, Caballero and Togliatti.^\n\nWhen the Spanish communists complained of the lack of\n\nmilitary aid from the Soviet Union, Togliatti explained\n\nthat \"Russia regards her security as the apple of her\n\neye. A false move on her part could upset the balance\n\nof power and unleash a war in East Europe.Nevertheless,\n\nunder pressure from the Spanish communists, he and Thorez\n\ndecided to urge Moscow to send arms.\n\nAt a meeting with the Spanish communists in April,\n\n1937, Togliatti demanded the removal of Largo Caballero\n\nfrom the premiership of the Republican government on the\n\ngrounds that he had been trying to reduce the powers of\n\nthe communist army commissars. This motion drew objections\n\n^Ibid., p. 216.\n\n^Ibld.\n\nQ\n\nThomas, op. cit., pp. 404-5.\n\n49 j\n\nfrom Spanish communists like Ramas Jose Diaz, who did not\n\nalways desire to conform to the directives of Moscow. His\n\nobjection was rebuked by the Stalinist agent, Stepanov,\n\nwho said that it was not Moscow but history which dictated I\n\nI ^\n\nj Caballero's removal, and the motion was passed. On\n\nj Togliatti's recommendation it was agreed that the campaign i\n\n! to destroy Caballero would begin at a meeting in Valencia\n\nI ;\n\nI and that Juan Negrin would be the new choice for premier.^ |\n\nj Togliatti occupied a house in Madrid with a commu- !\n\nI\n\nI nist known as La Pasionaria and her lover. After March 8,\n\nt 1938, Jesus Hernandez assumed the virtual leadership of I\n\nI I\n\nJ the party outside of Madrid while Luigi Longo remained\n\ni \" I\n\nI the military leader of the Garibaldi Brigade. Later in i\n\nI 1938 Togliatti moved from Madrid to Cartagena, but after\n\nthe collapse of the Loyalist resistance in Barcelona in\n\nJanuary 1939 he flew back to Madrid.\n\nThere has been much speculation that between 1935\n\nand 1939 it was Togliatti who carried the orders calling\n\nofficials back to Moscow for extinction. Dr. Eugenio\n\nReale, who was expelled from the party in 1956, maintains\n\nthat in 1938, by the will of Togliatti, the leaders of\n\nthe Polish Communist Party were lured to Moscow and\n\ncharged with treason and espionage and then assassinated.\n\nlOlbld., p. 116.\n\nI\n\nGomulka and Bierut escaped because they were absent from\n\nthe phony meeting to which they were called. This happen-|\n\ned during the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact !\n\nbetween Germany and Russia in which Hitler and Stalin |\n\nsecretly agreed to divide Poland. Although he points to |\n\nManuilsky as the actual executor of the 1938 purges, I\n\nI\n\nReale describes Togliatti as \"the most cynical and wicked |\n\nof all, cunningly assenting for well calculated reasons.\"\n\nReale does not enumerate these reasons but also condemns\n\nI Togliatti for not \"moving a finger\" to help his own cousin,\n\ni Robetti, who was arrested, tortured and held in a Moscow\n\nI 12 I\n\n; prison for some years without reason.On the other\n\nhand, in International Communism and World Revolution, ,\n\nGunther Nollau maintains that the German communist Willie\n\nMunzenberg, although eventually liquidated by the Stalinist\n\nmachine, survived an immediate purge in 1937 only because\n\n13\n\nTogliatti gave him an exit permit from the USSR. 1\n\nAlthough as he had reviewed the sentences of Bela Kun and\n\nAndres Nin^^ Togliatti was undoubtedly aware of Stalin's\n\n1\n\npurges, his role, if any, was well camouflaged by his\n\nnumerous other activities.\n\n^^Eugenio Reale, Nascita del Cominform (n.p.,\n\nArno1do Mondadori Editore, 195ÏÏ), pp. 21-257\n\nl^Nollau, op. cit., p. 177.\n\n^^Renato Mlell, Togliatti 1937 (Milan: Rizzoli,\n\n1964), p. 110.\n\n51\n\nWhen the Loyalist Colonel Segismundo Casado ousted\n\nPremier Negrin in a move that left the communists without\n\nany influence on the Republican government, which was\n\nrapidly losing ground to Franco, Togliatti was arrested\n\nnear Alicante by Casado's men, but released through the\n\nintervention of General Sarabia. During this civil war\n\nwithin a civil war, Togliatti caught the last plane out of\n\nthe Pyrenees on March 25, 1939. After a narrow escape\n\nthat left French gendarmes firing fruitlessly at the\n\nascending aeroplane, Togliatti and the pilot landed on\n\nthe beach of Mostuganem in Algeria where he was arrested\n\nby police and then released.After arriving back in\n\nParis in August, Togliatti concentrated on re-establishing\n\nparty cells in Italy and publishing a number of propa­\n\ngandist materials. Since over 600 Italian communists had\n\ndied in Spain, the first task was to recruit new party\n\nmembers among the Italian expatriots.\n\nIn Italy the PCI concentrated on infiltration of\n\nthe unions and the Fascist Institute for National Culture\n\nas Dimitrov had outlined at the Comintern Congresses.\n\nThis less violent strategy had come as a result of the\n\n1937 Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty of Neutrality and Non-\n\nAggression, which had taken the popular front by surprise.\n\nIn accordance with this new turn in Russian foreign\n\n^^Bellini and Galli, op. cit., p. 281.\n\n52\n\npolicy, the front was not to stir the axis powers against\n\n! the USSR.\n\n' Togliatti*s work in France ended with his arrest\n\nand six months imprisonment for using a false passport.\n\nFortunately for him the French were not aware of his true\n\nidentity and he was released in February, 1940. In the\n\nface of such obstacles, the Central Committee and the :\n\nSecretariat were transferred to Moscow. Togliatti arrived\n\nin Moscow in April, 1940, where he joined once again his\n\n! wife and secretary, Giovanni Germanetto.\n\n'\n\n! From his office at 10 Ulica Texlichekov, vdiich he I\n\nI shared with Manuilsky and Dimitrov, Togliatti continued [\n\nI to issue orders to the foreign center that was left in |\n\ni France. He ordered Umberto Massola to return to Milan\n\nand begin publication of \"L'Unita\" and \"II Lavaratore\"\n\nonce again. With Hitler's invasion of Russia, the popular\n\nfront, which was renewed in the fall of 1941, concentrated\n\non intensifying agitation against the government in Italy\n\nand called for Italy to make a separate peace with the\n\nAllies, dispose of Mussolini, and restore civil liber-\n\n1 7\n\nties. From Moscow Togliatti began radio broadcasts to\n\nItaly under the name \"Mario Correnti.\" Beginning in\n\n^^Delzell, op. cit., pp. 15-16.\n\n1 7\n\nFranz Borkenau, European Communism^(New York:\n\nHarper & Bros., 1953), pi TSZl\n\n53\n\nJune, 1941, until the armistice, he asked;\n\nFrom the moment that Hitler made his way along a\n\nroad that carries him to ruin why must we Italians\n\ncontribute to save him? Why starve to give Germany\n\nour products, why sacrifice for Hitler the lives of\n\nI t a l i a n s ’ 1 8 |\n\nIn these broadcasts titled \"Discorsi agli italiani,\"\n\nTogliatti also urged Italians to join the popular front in\n\nresistance to the government. He recognized that the\n\nfront must include the middle classes as well. As he\n\nstated in 1942:\n\nThe salvation of Italy rests with the Italian people,\n\nwith the Italian working class, peasantry, petty and\n\nmiddle bourgeoisie of the cities, the intelligentsia,\n\nand even those elements of the bourgeoisie who are\n\nstill capable of regarding the interests of the\n\nnation above the egoistic calculations of caste.19\n\nHe added that such a front would only be created when\n\nstrikes broke out in the cities and army.\n\nIn the northern cities of Italy the communist agents\n\npromoted strikes in the Fiat plant and other important\n\nindustries. The popular front re-established the old\n\nGeneral Confederation of Labor (CGIL) to lure workers\n\naway from the fascist unions. They called strikes on an\n\naverage of two per month throughout 1942. In 1943, on\n\nthe Communist International Women's Day, the front staged\n\nhuge demonstrations in Turin, calling for the King, Victor\n\n1 o\n\nFerrara and Ferra, op. cit., p. 298.\n\n^^Committee on Un-American Activities, op. cit.,\n\np. 387.\n\n54 I\n\nI\n\nEmanuele III, to depose Mussolini. In order to create a ’\n\nbroad popular front they omitted attacks against the King* s ' ■\n\n20\n\nposition and demands for separation of Church and State.\n\nAfter the invasion of Salerno in September of 1943,\n\nMussolini was deposed by the King and the Armistice with\n\nthe Allies was signed on September 8, 1943. The following\n\nday the communists, socialists, Christian Democrats, lib­\n\nerals and Party of Action established the Central Committee\n\nfor National Liberation (CCLN) with the socialist Ivanoe\n\nBonomi presiding. The PCI was represented in the new front\n\nby Giorgio Amendola and Mauro Scoccimarro, while Luigi\n\nLongo became the Supreme Commander of the CCLN in Milan\n\nunder the name \"Gallo.\" From Longo * s command post in\n\nMilan, the CCLN transported partisan fighters to the\n\nNorthern centers. PCI's Garibaldi Battalion made up two-\n\nfifths of the partisan ranks. Some communists, like\n\nVincenzo \"Cino\" Muscatelli with his group of 3,600\n\npartisans, distinguished themselves in the fighting and\n\nwere later elected to the Senate on their reputations as\n\npatriots. Along with the socialists, PCI organized the\n\nGappisti, which consisted of three or four teenage boys\n\nand a leader to carry out sabotage against the Germans.\n\nOften such attacks brought grim reprisals, as when 335\n\nItalians were rounded up by the Germans and shot in what\n\nbecame known as the Ardeatine Cave massacre. There is\n\n^^Delzell, op. cit., pp. 207-210.\n\n55\n\nlittle doubt, however, that the PCI played a major role\n\nin the struggle that followed the fall of fascism in\n\n1943. The Catholic Party of Action was the only other\n\norganization that compared in efficiency with the PCI,\n\nwhose work of propaganda, organization and re-organization\n\nwas broadest in scale with more messengers, fighters and\n\ncasualties. Of the 4,671 anti-fascists condemned during\n\nthe fascist period, 4,030 were communists.\n\nIt was amid the PCI's new glory from its identifi­\n\ncation with Italian patriotism that Togliatti arrived\n\nback in Italy after the dissolution of the Comintern and\n\nliquidation of its agencies in September, 1943. After\n\neighteen years underground the PCI could now demand a\n\nvoice in the direction of the country. The popular front\n\ntactics, which failed in Spain, proved their utility in\n\nItaly and would, therefore, remain the policy of the PCI\n\nin the first years after the war.\n\nIbid., pp. 244-52.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE \"SVOLTA DI NAPOLI\"\n\nFollowing the desposition of Mussolini in 1943,\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele III appointed Marshal Pietro\n\nBadoglio as the new head of state. Badoglio was not an\n\nI\n\ni anti-fascist but had held both military and political\n\n!\n\n! positions under Mussolini. He was aided by several non-\n\n! party ministers. This \"monarchial autocracy\" promised\n\nI parliamentary elections as soon as the war was ended.^\n\n! But in the spring of 1944, the government administration\n\nI\n\ngave way to a coalition of the six major parties in the\n\nCCLN. But these parties, ranging from Monarchists to\n\nCommunists, could not agree on the issue of the monarchy\n\nAlong with the parties of the left and center, the PCI,\n\nwhich in the absence of Togliatti was in the hands of\n\nEugenio Reale, had taken the position that they would\n\nabstain from supporting Badoglio* s government unless the\n\nmonarchy was dissolved.\n\nIt was during this crisis that, with the help of\n\nthe Allies, Togliatti returned to Italy. The journey\n\ntook several weeks through the Persian Gulf, Cairo,\n\n^Smith, op. cit., p. 487 j\n\n56\n\n— — — — — 1\n\n57 '\n\nAlgiers and finally to Naples on March 27, 1944. As\n\nIvanoe Bonomi later described:\n\n. . . there arrived miraculously from a far away ;\n\nplace a wonderful knight, a Lohengrin raised from\n\nthe dead, who put himself by the side of Badoglio i\n\nand carried him into safety. The knight came from j\n\nRussia and was Palmiro Togliatti .... He evi- |\n\ndently interpreted the thought of Moscow and acted i\n\nin conformity as the head of his party. The thinking I\n\nof Togliatti is simple, straightforward and convincing.'\n\nAnti-fascist Italy must make war upon the Germans |\n\nand upon fascism .... Confronted with this supreme !\n\nnecessity, what are the diatribes for or against the i\n\nabdication of King Vittorio, for or against Badoglio*sj\n\ncabinet?2 !\n\nUpon his return Togliatti immediately indicated that he\n\nhad no objection to collaborating with the other anti­\n\nfascist parties in Badoglio*s government. King or no\n\nKing. In a press conference on April 1, he stated, **We\n\nare no longer a sect of agitators but have assumed the\n\nresponsibility of a great party, the institutional\n\nquestion will be solved later.’* When asked if Italy\n\nwould be communist after the war, the PCI leader replied\n\nthat Italy must be democratic after the war and on demo­\n\ncratic lines the country would be able to work out its own\n\ndestiny. He outlined a four-point program for Italy:\n\n(1) a united front to end the hostilities, (2) a national\n\nconstituent assembly elected by universal vote, (3) a new\n\n2\n\nIvanoe Bonomi, Diario di un anno: 1943-1944\n\n(Cerusco Gaizanti, 1947), ppl 175-6.\n\n^Bellini, * ’ The Italian CP,'* op. cit., p. 42.\n\n58\n\ngovernment based on the support of the mass parties in\n\nthe CCLN, (4) freedom for all political viewpoints.^ Ten\n\ndays later, Togliatti re-enforced this more moderate,\n\nrightist position of the PCI when he defined the party's\n\ngoals as a parliamentary republic of workers and intel­\n\nlectuals; nationalization of large monopolies, banks and\n\ninsurance companies; liquidation of large uncultivated\n\nproperties and protection of medium and small ones.^ He\n\nwarned against sectarian extremism explaining, \"It must\n\nalways be remembered that the insurrection which we\n\ndesire does not have as its aim the imposition of social­\n\nist and communist changes but pursues the objective of\n\nnational liberation . . . .\"\n\nThis reversal in communist policy or \"svolta di\n\nNapoli\" (turn of Naples) as it became known, surprised\n\nthe PCI Central Committee in Naples. \"The postponements\n\nof radical change by the intelligentsia provoked in the\n\nparty a transparent embarrassment over the inconsisten­\n\ncies and, if its position in the CCLN was strengthened,\n\nthe efficacy of its presence in the clandestine movement\n\n^New York Times, April 2, 1944, 19:2.\n\n^William E.

Magnani and A. Cuechi maintain that;\n\nWhen the policy of compromise with the monarchy\n\nappeared [to represent] the genius of Cayour, it\n\nwas [actually the result of] a Soviet directive\n\naimed at guarding the political and military\n\ninterests of the Soviet Union in the war against\n\nHitler.8\n\nAnd according to Muriel Grindrod in The Rebuilding of\n\nItaly, Togliatti*s \"svolta\" was based on the:\n\n. . . far reaching calculation that, by gaining a\n\nfoothold in the government, the communists would be\n\nable to rally the other left-wing parties under their\n\naegis and so eventually acquire sufficient power to\n\nparalyze the whole party system.9\n\nStalin had indeed ordered Togliatti to propose his coop­\n\neration and the USSR recognized the Badoglio government\n\nimmediately afterward. Speaking to the disbanded Comin­\n\ntern on May 22, 1943, Stalin had outlined the sixth\n\n^Palmiro Togliatti, Per la Salvezza del Nostra\n\nPaese (Rome: S. A. Puligrafica Italiana, 1946)J p. 156.\n\n^Avanti, April 5, 1944.\n\no\n\nJohn Ducoli, \"The New Face of Italian Communism,\"\n\nProblems of Communism, Vol. XIII, No. 2 (1964), p. 83.\n\n9Muriel Grindrod, The Rebuilding of Italy: Politics\n\nand Economics 1945-1955 (New York: Royal Institute of\n\nInternational Affairs, 1955), p. 14.\n\n60\n\nstrategy of world communism as the united war effort and\n\nrecognition of the rebirth in nationalism.^^\n\nNonetheless, Togliatti appeared to many as more\n\nItalian than communist. Even non-communist circles out­\n\nside of Italy welcomed the move as realistic and\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele confided to a friend that\n\n\"Togliatti . . . has spoken as an Italian .... At I\n\nI\n\nI this moment the communist leader is sincere . . . the world\n\n! is moving to the left . . . . The liberals called the |\n\n; . I\n\nI move a \"concrete debut of a collaboration that represents j\n\nI 12 '\n\nI the first reconstructive act of a new Italian life.\"\n\ni\n\nTogliatti s move had the resolute effect of sweeping\n\nthe liberals and other monarchial opposition into support\n\nof Badoglio and coincided with a Soviet thrust to counter\n\nAnglo-American hegemony in Italy by communist participation\n\nin the government. Badoglio gave equal representation to\n\nthe five major parties. Togliatti was named minister of\n\nstate without portfolio along with the liberal Benedetto\n\nCroce, Count Sforza and socialist Pietro Mancini, and on\n\nApril 24, 1944, they swore allegiance to the monarch and\n\npledged the Allies not to upset the armistice. When on\n\nJune 10 Badoglio resigned and Bonomi became premier.\n\n^^Ebon, op. cit., p. 17.\n\n^^Delzell, op. cit., pp. 16-18.\n\n^^Piscitelli, op. cit., p. 338.\n\n61\n\nTogliatti retained his position in the cabinet calling\n\nupon the Allies to distribute arms to youths and urging\n\nthe Church to be mutually tolerant, admitting that a\n\ncommunist Italy in the near future was out of the question:\n\nWe aren't even thinking in those terms .... We\n\ncommunists believe in small land owners and private\n\nproperty in Italy. Can you imagine an Italy without\n\nthem . . .?. As long as there are good monarchists,\n\nlet us collaborate with them,13\n\n1\n\ni Since Togliatti was aiming at securing a leftist\n\ngovernment, he extended an invitation to the Christian\n\nDemocrats to collaborate with the communist-socialist\n\nbloc. In connection with this aim the PCI announced that\n\nhis party respected Catholicism and replaced any mention\n\nof a proletarian dictatorship with propaganda calling for\n\npatriotic unity. Later in September of 1944, when the\n\nleader of the Christian Democrats (DC), Alcide de Gasperi,\n\nused harsh language to accuse the PCI of breaking up a DC\n\nmeeting, Togliatti denied the charge saying, \"In particu­\n\nlar we hope and wish that concrete political accord with\n\nyour party will be possible.Togliatti*s conference\n\nwith Msgr. Giovanni Montini, a papal secretary, soon after\n\nrepresented the first direct contact between the Vatican\n\nand the PCI. Such unprecedented actions led \"L'Unita\" to\n\n^^New York Times, July 14, 1944, p. 7.\n\n^^Ibid., September 17, 1944, p. 26.\n\n62\n\ncomment that \"Palmiro Togliatti is becoming more Italian\n\n, ,,15\n\nevery day.\n\nMeanwhile, the communist Minister of Justice,\n\nScoccimarro, was attempting to eliminate both real and\n\nalleged fascists, causing a number of cabinet crises in­\n\ncluding the resignation of the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nImprisonment without trial had become a common feature of\n\nhis \"defascistization.\" Togliatti was criticized for not\n\ndeploring the mob murder of Donato Cerretta, a fascist\n\npolice chief who had actually helped many anti-fascists\n\nlike Guiseppe Saragat to escape prison. In a parliamen­\n\ntary rebuttal the communist leader pointed out that there\n\nwere many more such lynchings in the United States. He\n\nalso complained of reactionary officials who were seeking\n\nto minimize the role of the partisans by granting all the\n\npowers to the Allied Control Commission. After Florence\n\nwas liberated, the Allies were definitely concerned with\n\ngetting arms out of the hands of those who might later use\n\nthem for political purposes.\n\nThe PCI* s position was strengthened, however, when\n\nthe communist group Sappisti (Squadron for Patriotic\n\nUnity), Youth Front and Group for the Defense of Women\n\nwere all incorporated into the CCLN. Between 1943 and\n\n^^Ibid., August 12, 1944, p. 10.\n\n^^L'Unlta, July 30, 1944.\n\n63\n\n1944 the PCI membership had increased to 100,000 card\n\ncarriers. The party had gained most during the war from\n\nits superior organization, prestige from its role in the\n\nresistance and infiltration into the workers unions. In\n\na speech to the party National Council, Togliatti pointed\n\nout that the party could use the resistance role as a\n\nmeans of augmenting its popularity with the voters rather\n\nthan seizing power or forcibly altering the structure of\n\n17\n\nthe state. The capable Giuseppe Di Vittorio, who had\n\nmastered the Leninist skills of organizational control\n\nwhile in the International Brigade in Spain, managed in\n\ntwo years to gain control of the only worker * s union,\n\nCGIL, for the communists. Thus, as a result of the PCI * s\n\npact of unity with the socialists, the communists gradually\n\nwere able to take from them the influence over the workers\n\nand at the same time prevent the Christian Democrats from\n\njoining in a coalition of the right. The growing strength\n\nand popularity of the communists was demonstrated in Rome\n\nin early November idien over 80,000 persons carrying red\n\nflags gathered at the Palatine to hear Pietro Nenni of\n\nPSI and Togliatti speak. Both stood for several minutes *\n\novation before Nenni denounced the monarchy and Togliatti\n\n1 7\n\nPalmiro Togliatti, Storia critica del partiti\n\nitaliani (Rome: Reuniti, 1945), pp. 194-6.\n\n64\n\n18\n\navoided the issue. When the socialists threatened to\n\nback out of Bomoni's government at the end of the year,\n\nTogliatti pledged support to Bonomi even without the\n\nsocialists. It was thought that this move might weaken\n\nthe unity-of-actibn pact but on December 8 \"L'Unita\"\n\nasserted:\n\nOur brotherly union will not break up and certainly\n\nthe communists will do their best to maintain it,\n\nbut it will be difficult since the moderate-wing\n\nof the socialists are in a much stronger position.\n\nThe socialists eventually agreed to support Bonomi's new\n\ncabinet, which included Togliatti as a vice-premier along\n\nwith the Christian Democrat, Rodino. Other communists in\n\nthe cabinet included Mario Pesenti, minister of finance;\n\nScoccimarro, minister of occupied territories ; Fausto\n\nGallo, minister of agriculture; and Eugenio Reale, foreign\n\nminister. They swore the oath to Crown Prince Humbert, the\n\nson of Vittorio Emanuele, who had agreed to abdicate in |\n\n20 I\n\nfavor of his son.\n\nDuring the following six months Togliatti pursued\n\nthe same line and went even further in his attempts to\n\ndraw closer to a coalition with the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn April he charged the Church with using religious\n\n^^New York Times, November 13, 1944, p. 1.\n\n^^Ibid., December 9, 1944, p. 6.\n\n! 20\n\nIbid., December 10, 1944, p. 12; December 12,\n\n1944, p. 8.\n\n65\n\nterrorism to scare Catholics away from the PCI:\n\nWe know very well that there are many devout in our\n\nparty and we have consciously, after mature reflection,\n\nopened the door of our party to the faithful. This\n\nmeans that we do not impose as a condition that he\n\nwho intends joining our party should join our ideo­\n\nlogies, since in our party today a regime of tolerance\n\nrules.21\n\nOn the matter of Italy* s foreign policy, Togliatti\n\nhad not yet lashed out against American \"imperialism,\"\n\nsince the United States was still carrying on the war\n\neffort with Russia. In a three hour address to a PCI\n\ndelegation he stated that Italy's foreign policy must be\n\nbased on the unity of the three great democratic nations\n\nand warned against attempts to maneuver along the lines\n\n22\n\nof possible eventual antagonisms among the big powers.\n\nIn the fall of 1944 both partisan and Allied acti­\n\nvities were slowed by the winter and Mussolini's promises\n\nof amnesties to those who would support him. Finally,\n\nin April, Mussolini was caught at Dongo, thirty miles\n\nfrom the Swiss border,by the Fifty-Second Garibaldi\n\nBrigade while fleeing with a German unit to Switzerland.\n\nMussolini was discovered in a German uniform after the\n\ncommanding German officer informed the partisans of his\n\npresence in their convoy in return for the release of\n\nhis unit. Mussolini was shot on the twenty-eighth along\n\n^^New York Times, April 8, 1945, p. 27.\n\n66 I\n\nI\n\nwith his constant companion, Clara Petacci.

When his parliamentary\n\nimmunity was lifted several years later, he escaped behind\n\nthe iron curtain and wasn't brought to trial until 1957.\n\nThe fifty-seven year old communist, who was charged with\n\nboth murder and embezzlement, answered every question with\n\n\"I don't know\" and \"I don't remember.\" However, an ex­\n\ndriver for the partisans, Terzi, testified that he deli­\n\nvered the \"treasure\" in five suitcases to Gorreri \"because\n\nthe communists had fought harder than anyone else,\"\n\nadding that \"they weighed plenty.\" \"The car was over­\n\nloaded and the wheels scraped against the fenders.\"\n\nGorreri insisted, \"I never saw you before, you lie.\"\n\nTerzi replied, \"I never lie.\" Other witnesses told of\n\nthe disappearance of over one hundred sons and husbands\n\nwho knew Gorreri. The sixty-three year old mother of\n\nLuigi Canali, known as \"Neri,\" who had signed the original\n\npartisan inventory of the \"treasure,\" said, \"I remember\n\nwhen my son told me, 'Mama, those thieves are ruining\n\neverything. I have seen such things.'\" She added. When\n\nPalmiro Togliatti came to Como, I saw him in the Piazza\n\ndel Popolo. *I am Neri's mother* I said to him. 'My\n\nson worked hard for the party. What became of him?*\n\n'Be calm,* he answered, 'your son will be rehabilitated.*\"\n\n(Time, LXIX, June 24, 1957, p. 34.) The judge declared\n\na mistrial when a juror committed suicide. (Delzell,\n\nop. cit. p. 542.)\n\n67\n\nThe following month riots broke out in several\n\ncities over Italy's claim to Trieste in the Peace Treaty.\n\nTogliatti and the rest of the cabinet arrived in Milan\n\nwhere the government headquarters had been moved. In\n\nviolation of Allied rulings, he spoke from the balcony\n\nof his room to a throng of 15,000 and referred to the\n\n\"Italian character of Trieste.(Nenni was arrested\n\nfor the same violation.) During the crisis over Trieste\n\nTogliatti insisted that there should be a socialist\n\npremier or the PCI would withdraw its support from the\n\nI\n\nI government. This threat was only one of many that Togli-\n\ni\n\n: atti used to test his strength in such situations,\n\nj Actually, the PCI leader was determined to enlarge the\n\nI\n\nrole of the party in the government and a few days later\n\nhe invited Alcide de Gasperi to join him and Nenni in a\n\ntripartite regime. De Gasperi was not interested in any\n\ncoalitions with the communists and the new premier,\n\nFerruccio Parri, was a liberal leader of the Party of\n\nAction.\n\nWhile minister of justice in Parri's cabinet,\n\nTogliatti was censured by the Italian Bar Association for\n\n25\n\nhis interference with legal processes. In his bid to\n\n^^New York Times, May 27, 1945, p. 14.\n\n^^Ibld., October 26, 1945, p. 7.\n\n68\n\nmake the PCI a national party with the cooperation of the\n\nChristian Democrats, Togliatti supported the retention of\n\nthe Lateran Pact between the Vatican and the Italian State.\n\nThe Pact was first negotiated by Mussolini in 1929. In\n\naddition to guaranteeing the Church recognition as a state\n\nreligion and possession of the Vatican territory, the Pact\n\ngranted the Church bonds in Mussolini's regime. This con­\n\nservative move coincided with a shift of communist empha­\n\nsis on the workers in the North to the peasants in the\n\nSouth.\n\nj By the end of 1945 the PCI could claim two million\n\nI card carrying members and in the June elections of 1946\n\nI they gathered 4,342,722 votes and 104 seats in Parliament.\n\nI Together with the socialists with 115 seats, they attempt-\n\nI ed to block ratification of the NATO treaty in July and\n\nafter failing to do so Togliatti ordered the communist\n\ndelegates to walk out of the Chamber during the ratifi-\n\n27\n\ncat ion.\n\nBy the end of 1946 Togliatti was forced by pressure\n\nfrom Moscow to modify his stand on one of the most nation­\n\nalistic and emotional issues facing the Italian government.\n\nAlthough the Peace Treaty had recognized Italy's claim to\n\nTrieste, after protests from Tito in Yugoslavia, the\n\n^^Time, XLIX (April 26, 1948), p. 32.\n\n^^Grindrod, op. cit., p. 123.\n\n69\n\nAllies urged Italy to settle the problem with her eastern\n\nneighbor. Togliatti made an unsponsored trip to Belgrade\n\nin November to confer with the Yugoslavian leader and\n\nupon his return to Rome Togliatti proposed that Parliament\n\naccept Tito's offer to rescind his demand for Trieste in\n\nreturn for Gorizia with a guarantee of autonomous status\n\nfor Trieste. In \"L'Unita\" the communist explained that\n\nthe Alto Adige or Italy's frontier with Austria was far\n\nmore important than the Yugoslavian border since, histori-\n\n■ cally, Italy was menaced by Germanic invasions rather\n\nthan Slavic. By denouncing the frontier set under the old\n\nt\n\nTreaty of Rapallo, which, by granting Italy Gorizia and\n\n1 ■\n\nI Trieste, but not Fiume, had not satisfied either\n\nI\n\nI Yugoslavian or Italian nationalist aims, Togliatti was\n\ni\n\nable to assume the role of mediator Wiile backing the\n\n28\n\ncause of Yugoslavian*Italian relations. Of the nineteen\n\ncabinet ministers four communists and two republicans\n\nsupported the Tito proposal. The opposition, led by\n\nde Gasperi who had followed Parri as premier, maintained\n\nthat the offer was not in the interest of Italy, saying,\n\n\"Tito would give us what is not his in exchange for what\n\n29\n\nis already ours.\" Nenni, who at first opposed the\n\nproposition, came out in support of the proposal.
