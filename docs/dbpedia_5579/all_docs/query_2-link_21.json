        "text": "ROME, March 22—There was a lot to be learned about the anguish of presentday Italian life, Luigi Barzini suggested, from the funeral Saturday of the five bodyguards who were killed in the abduc tion of Aldo Moro, one of the country's leading politicians.\n\n“Did you see it on television?” he askew a visitor to his home, a comfortable retreat built in the 'style of an Umbrian farmhouse in the hills just north of Rome. “The Christian Democrats marched under the Catholic flag—white. The Communists marched under the revolutionary flag—red. It was a day of national mourning, you understand, but the only place you saw the national colors was on the coffins of five dead men, The only place!”\n\nIt is 14 years now since Luigi Barzini, the journalist son of a journalist father, published his book, “The Italians,” and found himself acclaimed as a definitive interpreter of his people. At 70 years of age, Mr. Barzini has given up the parliamentary seat he first won in 1958, but he. is still watching the daily unfolding of events, and he still sees disastrous drift and disunity.\n\n“The decay of the Italian state has been decisively demonstrated by the kidnapping of Moro,” Mr. Barzini said. “Up until now, many Italians have deceived themselves, told themselves that things were not really so bad. Self‐deception is a national trait, and it's so easy.\n\n“After all, look at this house, these books. For a lot of us, the life surrounding us is sweet, and the taste of the food, the gossip with your friends, the warmth of the sun don't change. But knew something terrible was coming.”\n\nWith that Mr. Barzini picked up a copy of his own book from the stack on the coffee table and began quoting from the last page.\n\n“It is the Italian way of life which makes all laws and institutions function defectively,'. he read. “It is the illusion of a solution, lotus‐eating, the resigned acceptance of the very evils man has tried to defeat, the art of decorating, enobling them, calling them by different names and living with them. The un- solved problems pile up and inevitably! produce catastrophes at regular intervals.’ The Italians always see the next one approaching with a clear eye, but, like sleepers in a nightmare, cannot do anything to ward it off.”\n\nMr. Barzini looked anything but the pessimist as he sat in a red leather armchair in his library, with books lining all four walls from floor to ceiling. Smoking, gesticulating, toying with his glasses, he looked the picture of the self‐assured Italian aristocrat in his pink shirt and blue pullover. But he wasn't confident at all.\n\n“I'd like to get the hell out of here and forget the whole thing,” he said, hands locked behind his head, “but don't see myself as a Nabokov, living out my days on the shores of Lake Geneva. I'm an Italian'—he chuckled selfmockingly—'so I'll stay.”\n\nHis conversation was studded with expressions of gloom about his country's past and future:\n\n?'Italy has been in a shambles ever since Charles VIII of France] came south across the Alps in 1494.”\n\n?'We're going down the drain to Bangladesh. We're going to be the first developed country to turn itself back into an underdeveloped country.”\n\n?'The Italian nation is Immortal. It will live forever, but not the Italian state. Maybe we'll turn out to be like the Armenians.”\n\nWhen, Mr. Barzini was asked, would the final collapse come? It was hard to say, he replied, citing in explanation comment by his favorite political philosopher, the 16th‐century Florentine, Guicciardini, to the effect that one could never forecalst with precision when a debt-ridden merchant would go bankrupt, when a dying man would expire or when besieged city would finally run out of food.\n\nToward the end of a long interview, he was toying with the idea that perhaps tile abduction of Mr. Moro would “shock the Italians into some sort of unified, unselfish action.” A connoisseur of historical parallels, Mr. Barzini thought at once of Caporetto, the defeat in 1917 after which an Italian Army composed mainly of boys held the line along\n\nthe Piave River when the rest of the Allies thought the situation was hopeless.\n\n“Every Italian forgot the church, his region, even his family and rallied to the state.” the writer said. “Maybe it will happen again.”\n\nMr. Barzini believes that the roots of Italian political fragility lie in the origin of the modern state, which, he says, was the creation of a narrow minority of liberal aristocrats and bourgeois intellectuals, while the Catholic Church was hostile and the masses were indifferent, probably because they thought no government could change things.\n\nAfter World War II, he said the other day, it was clear that the liberals, a group’ to which he and his forebears belonged, were too weak to resist the increasingly powerful Communists.\n\n“So the anti‐Communists, like a medieval city sending its bishop out to negotiate with its besiegers, turned to the Pope,” Mr. Barzini went on. “The result was the Christian Democratic Party. They held back the Communists, but they never had the slightest notion how to run a modern state. They lacked the men, the ideas and the capacity to mold new society.”\n\nHe compared the Christian Democrats to the Luddites, the 19th century English opponents of the Industrial Revolution who smashed machines, and said they wanted to re‐create a Catholic past that never really existed “except in their imaginations.” ,Under their stewardship, he asserted, universities have become chaotic, corruption has rotted the Government, the police have gone from bad to worse and agriculture has declined.\n\nThen why has the party held power for 30 years?\n\n“There is no one else,” replied Mr. Barzini. “We [the liberals] had made too many mistakes, lost too many wars, passed too many bad laws. After a few years of sharing power—the years of the Italian economic miracle—the old elite became demoralized and simply disap peared. Then, for a time, the Socialists shared power with the Christian Democrats. But they're a minestrone of wellmeaning ineptitude.\n\n“So we were left with the Guelphs and Ghibellines'—the rival papal and imperial parties in medieval Italy--'the Christian Democrats, who couldn't run the state, and the Communists, who went about undermining it in every way they could. Nothing in between.\n\n“Now the Communists are afraid that the whole thing will collapse, so they're willing to cooperate with their archenemies. And that infuriates the cultural proletarians, the university graduates with no jobs—people like the Red Brigades.”\n\n“It's a pity,” he said. “Italians are careful when they choose a surgeon. They're careful when they choose a cook; they Won't eat bad food. They won't tolerate bad singers. But they have never been very careful about their politicians.”"
