        "text": "My dissertation crosses the divide between the inter-war and post-war periods in closely examining the sculptural production, exhibition, and critical reception from 1935 to 1959 of two Italian sculptors, Marino Marini (1901-1980) and Fausto Melotti (1901-1986). Since Italian culture has largely been segregated around the Second World War, a parentheses has been put around Fascist culture, largely because of the Regime’s wartime connection to Nazism. Yet, both Marini and Melotti were productive before, during, and after WWII. This dissertation brings attention to how these sculptors’ wartime production can be seen as both relating to and moving away from their inter-war artworks. While many critics and scholars have praised Italian sculptors’ post-war production as a phoenix rising from the ashes of Fascism, my project posits that the beginnings of post-war vibrancy can be found during the war years. The intensification of totalitarian controls on culture resulting from both Mussoli...\n\nThis article explores the contradictions in Italy’s relationship with the Mediterranean basin, taking Tunisia as a focal point. Tunisia was a paradoxical case at the intersection of Italy’s foreign policy: it was a former Roman imperial colony with a strategic location, but it also possessed a large and vibrant Italian emigrant settlement, like the Italian “colonies” of Buenos Aires, Sao Paolo, New York, and San Francisco. This situation caused much confusion in debates over how Italy should develop its international influence. Faced with a choice of priorities, the Italians of Tunisia called for Italy to concentrate on establishing territorial colonies in the Mediterranean, rather than cultivating Italian emigration worldwide. In 1881, France surprised Italy by seizing control of Tunisia, skewing Italian policy and fomenting a sense of weakness and insecurity. Italy’s “loss” of Tunisia encouraged the belief that Italian imperial motives were more deserving and more sincere, and Nationalists used the wealthy and successful Italian community of Tunisia as a model of what Italians would be able to achieve in neighboring Libya. Fascist representations of Italians in Tunisia, however, finally discredited the Italian expatriates’ claims to rights and representation under French colonial rule. This case study thus illustrates how Mediterranean Europe and North Africa became enmeshed in multiple layers of competition and integration through trends in colonialism, migration, and the formation of transnational communities.\n\nIn 1798 the Jacobin Matteo Galdi theorized the distinction between methodical public education, given in the schools, and revolutionary public education, «which instructs the masses in the principles of democracy». Among the latter’s tools, Galdi enumerated the constitutional circles, which were patriotic societies specifically devoted to educate the adults, who could not take advantage of the new scholastic system. Many patriots got involved in the circles’ activities in 1797-98. In comparison with precedent experiences of patriotic sociability in 1796-97, the circles did not set any admission requirements and allowed women and men of all social classes to actively join the sessions. My paper primarily analyses the way this new form of egalitarian republican sociability was intended as a useful tool for the political education of Italian people. Particular emphasis will therefore be placed on the pedagogic instruments conceived by the patriots within the circles: they included not only speeches and catechisms, but also chants, poetry readings, festivals, para-religious ceremonies, and commemorations held in honour of the martyrs of freedom. Through the revolutionary education, the patriots aimed at giving birth to a new political community, replacing the ancient regime’s one. Furthermore, my paper deals with the patriots’ successful attempt to organize all the Cisalpine circles in a similar way, in order to build a real network devoted to the popular education and to maximize the positive effects of patriotic sociability.\n\nThe Piedmontese government, which led the process of reunification, reformed the school system from the top down through the Casati law (1859). Scholars have viewed this measure on the one hand as a means of ensuring the loyalty of the newly-formed ruling class to the state and to the young constitutional monarchy. On the other hand, it was also the beginning of compulsory elementary education. Thus the widely-cited claim that, ‘having made Italy, now we must make Italians’, has led to a focus on the effort to teach “Italianness” in schools. Thanks to data unearthed in archives in Sardinia and Lombardy, which are here adopted as case studies, I found significant clues which suggest we need to challenge the accepted pattern of historical change and shift the focus from the centre (state) to the margins. Local sources and regional archives, analysed with the help of new computer technologies, allow for the collection of enormous amounts of data, which can then be compared and examined with great precision and flexibility. This paper is an invitation to embrace interdisciplinary approaches and to re-think the importance of geography in order to better understand the history of schooling of the peninsula."
