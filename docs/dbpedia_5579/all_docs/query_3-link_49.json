        "text": "My grandmother Giannalisa Feltrinelli, at a mere 32 years of age, found herself with an enormous fortune at her complete disposal. Her first move was to dismiss her husband's most faithful colleagues. Her second was to request an audience with Il Duce, \"in order to explain the difficulties that I now find myself obliged to face on my own\". Mussolini, perhaps more sensible of decency than the widow, did not receive her.\n\nGiannalisa loved her children, Giangiacomo and Antonella, but she treated them with ill-considered logic. First she would mortify them, and then shower them with kisses and hugs. They were transported here, there and everywhere, like monkeys. School was out of the question. Giannalisa enrolled her son in the Italian Fascist Youth Movement. An alumnus of one of the city's finest high schools was chosen to give the children lessons in the family's Roman residence.\n\nGiangiacomo did not have friends. By way of compensation, one morning at breakfast his mother introduced Luigi Barzini junior, thumb and index finger hooked into the lapels of a gangster-style bathrobe. He was wearing plush slippers, and a cigarette hung from his fleshy lips: he was the new fianc√© of the richest widow in Italy.\n\nIn 1942, the family moved to Giannalisa's villa. It stood on a promontory, surrounded by thick Mediterranean vegetation. It is a splendid place, but \"for us it was sheer murder\", explains Antonella, then 15. \"We were left entirely to our own devices, but like kidnap victims, without ever going beyond the gate, without ever being able to get to know anybody...\" Giangiacomo hated his new stepfather Luigi, a sentiment that was cordially reciprocated. Giannalisa and her husband did not hesitate to inflict humiliating punishments on him, such as locking him up in the cellar for days on bread and water. He suffered from claustrophobia from then on.\n\nIn the November of 1944, Giangiacomo, aged 20, enrolled in the Legnano combat unit, a volunteer corps seconded to the 5th Army, and soon after joined the Italian Communist party. Giannalisa was scandalised by the company he kept. Having a communist for a son was tantamount to having a son with the plague. A few months later, she took herself and the family silver off to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nGiangiacomo's 21st birthday brought him rights and obligations. He was the sole male heir to the Feltrinelli empire. Giangiacomo must have seriously considered getting rid of the damned money and \"handing it all over to Togliatti\" [leader of the Italian Communist party, PCI]. According to the usual stereotypes, he ought to have been a spendthrift or a zealous philanthropist, or a businessman bent over his accounts. But he turned out to be none of these things.\n\nPolitical activity took up almost all his free time. During the day, Feltrinelli the businessman struggled to elude the traps laid for him by his rapacious mother. His holdings were concentrated in construction, lumber and he, ostentatiously communist, was the principal stockholder in a merchant bank, side by side with a representative of the Vatican's bank. In April 1951, a confidential report informed the chief of police: \"Within the sphere of the various activities of the PCI, we ought to include the work of the well-known communist businessman Giangiacomo Feltrinelli.\"\n\nIn the late afternoon of Saturday, June 18, 1955, four young men and a girl met in a Milan bar, a stone's throw from La Scala opera house. One of the four was the fledgling publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, whose 29th birthday it was that very evening. The other three men were his editors, while the girl was his willing secretary, interpreter, cashier and telephonist. The little group decided to make a toast: to the new publishing house and its first books!\n\nAll of them shared a common experience. In the immediate postwar period, the editorial department of an evening paper, Milano Sera, had launched a series of low-cost paperbacks: the Universale Economica del Canguro. The idea was to revive a glorious Italian tradition of the late 19th century, when a few publishers had gone after the mass market, printing the classic literature of the whole world and offering the books at the absurdly low price of 25 cents.\n\nCanguro got off to a remarkable start: the readers liked what they saw and print runs reached a peak of 35,000. But booksellers did not earn much out of the publications: the list price was too low. Within a few months sales had plummeted. The venture ended, but the idea remained. In early 1954, publication was suspended to make way for the establishment of the newborn Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore. The first titles to be published soon won shelf space in the bookshops, because they captured something about culture in those places where culture was really to be found (in Germany, Russia, Latin America, the US, even in Persia, Egypt and China), and because Feltrinelli had put his money into paperbacks (unfashionable in those years), not only novels but non-fiction books and manuals.\n\n\"At bottom,\"recalled Anna Del Boffino, the press officer at the time,\"we realised we were very lucky, we were living in the eye of the cyclone.\" But there were problems having a boss who was also a comrade. The new publishing house was explicitly a part of Italian \"anti-Fascist\" culture and its editorial approach was organised along Marxist lines. Contacts with the Communist leadership, at least until 1955, were cordial and helpful.\n\nIn the meantime, the first great bestseller in the history of contemporary publishing was about to be born. In 1955, Sergio D'Angelo, Feltrinelli's literary talent scout in the USSR, told him that an amazing novel written by a Russian poet, Boris Pasternak, was about to be published in the Soviet Union. Feltrinelli asked D'Angelo to get in touch with the author and to request a copy of the manuscript so that a translation might be made immediately.\n\nOnce he had the manuscript in Milan, Feltrinelli sent a telegram to the Slavic linguist Pietro Zveteremich to ask him for an opinion. Zveteremich wound up his reader's report with these words: \"Not to publish a novel like this would constitute a crime against culture.\"\n\nIn June 1956, Feltrinelli sent off his first letter to his future author, in French. He offered 15% royalties and 50% of foreign rights.\n\nAgreeing to the contract, Pasternak wrote, \"It is no merit of mine if questions of money are non-existent or entirely secondary for me. In any event, keep all that is due to me under your protection, I entrust it to you unreservedly, and don't let's talk any more of this until I come to you or bring up this matter myself. I am particularly glad that the novel will come out and be read in your country. If its publication here, promised by several of our magazines, were to be delayed and your version were to come before it, I would find myself in a tragically embarrassing situation. But this is not your concern. In the name of God, feel free to go on with the translation and the printing of the book, and good luck! Ideas are not born to be hidden or smothered at birth, but to be communicated to others...\"\n\nBy August, the KGB knew of the delivery of the manuscript. The foreign minister Dimitri Shepilov defined Pasternak's novel as \"a ferocious libel against the USSR\" and gave notice that \"the Department for Relations with Foreign Communist Parties, through some friends, is taking steps to prevent the publication abroad of this anti-Soviet book\".\n\nPublication was delayed at Pasternak's request. Then, under duress, Pasternak signed another letter to Feltrinelli stating, \"I am now convinced that what I have written can in no way be considered a finished work. In my view it is not possible to publish the book in its current form . . . Please be so kind as to return, to my Moscow address, the manuscript of my novel Doctor Zhivago, which is indispensable for my work.\"\n\nThe letter sent by Pasternak to Feltrinelli a few months later was of a quite different tenor. \"Oh, how happy I am that neither you, nor Gallimard, nor Collins have been fooled by those idiotic and brutal appeals accompanied by my signature (!), a signature all but false and counterfeit, in so far as it was extorted from me by a blend of fraud and violence . . . But we shall soon have an Italian Zhivago, French, English, and German Zhivagos - and one day perhaps a geographically distant but Russian Zhivago! And this is a great deal, a very great deal, so let's do our best and what will be will be!\"\n\nWithin the closed ranks of the Soviet leadership it was thought to the last that the book would not be published in Italy: Feltrinelli, ultimately, was \"one of ours\". This made the diplomatic, political, and cultural defeat of the world's first or second power all the clearer and more wounding. Of course, Khruschev could have taken the trouble to read that long novel, something that much later he was to confess he had not done.\n\nThere is an emblematic photo of the Soviet defeat. A paparazzo immortalised Anastasy Mikoyan, the vice-president of the Council of Ministers, as he was gloomily observing the window of the biggest bookshop in New York. The picture was taken on an official visit in the winter of 1958. Doctor Zhivago was the only book on display, many copies piled up in the window.\n\nAfter the publication of the novel, Feltrinelli had to withstand the assault of the PCI, punctual as a Swiss watch. The party leadership produced an internal memo deploring Feltrinelli's behaviour, deemed \"incompatible with the duties of every militant communist\".\n\nFeltrinelli left for America with his new love, Inge Schoenthal. New York gave them a special welcome. There were important encounters and new friends. One of these was Barney Rosset, an editor at Grove Press. They spoke at length about Beckett. Feltrinelli took out an option but, unfortunately, did not clinch a deal. He was on the trail of Jack Kerouac. He approached Nabokov about Lolita, an approach that failed owing to incompatibility of character. Things went better with Karen Blixen: oysters, champagne and a deal for Out Of Africa.\n\nIn 1959 Feltrinelli published translated versions of Saul Bellow, Kazimierz Brandys, Jorge Luis Borges, JP Donleavy, Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, EM Forster, Doris Lessing and Nathalie Sarraute... \"There was a moment in which Feltrinelli was an Italian publishing house only because its head office was in Milan,\" wrote Valerio Riva.\n\n\"Do you read a lot of books?\" I once asked him. He replied that he read plenty of them, but not an excessive amount. \"Publishers,\" he maintained, \"are handcarts, people who go around with the sign 'printed pages for sale', they are conveyors of messages. Knowing nothing, they must know everything, everything of use.\"\n\nFeltrinelli's political thinking was taking a steadily apocalyptic turn. The capitalist world was on \"the brink of the volcano\", and revolution was smouldering beneath the ashes. His Cuban adventure can be divided into two phases. The first, between 1964 and 1965, was spent in the hunt for a great book, the memoirs of Fidel Castro. The Castro book was to be the big new \"scoop\". A major international bestseller. Or, at least, this was the plan.\n\nA few days before Feltrinelli's editor Valerio Riva left for Cuba, JF Kennedy was assassinated. The first news, sent out by a Dallas radio station, was that the Cuban secret service was responsible. At that moment, Fidel Castro was never at greater risk of being eliminated.\n\nWhat to do about the plans for the memoirs? It was decided to carry on. Riva left for Cuba; he was one of two ghostwriters.\n\nWhen Riva arrived, there was no sign of Fidel. In Cuba, keeping people waiting is a customary ritual, especially when it is a matter of a meeting with the leader. Riva describes his eventual meeting with Castro in a letter to Feltrinelli: \"He has a really strange half-falsetto voice. Sometimes his tone is high and shrill; other times it is soft and suave. Using his right hand, he continually played with his paratrooper's beret, adjusting it over his forehead, over his ear. He was forever crossing and uncrossing his legs... He is fat, with a belly and a big backside, but seen from close up he gives an impression of youth and strength.\"\n\nOn the night of February 5, 1964, a plane landed, a sweetish scent wafted in through the open door, and Mr and Mrs Feltrinelli were in Havana. They were lodged in a government villa with garden and pool.\n\nThe first meeting with Castro was an exploratory affair. Castro was expecting someone with the aplomb of an old millionaire, a powerful international publisher. So much so that he began to talk \"business\". He asked a couple of times: \"Is this really the millionaire?\"\n\nAs they talked, the atmosphere grew more relaxed. Castro laughed, joked, talked and backslapped. Feltrinelli was almost embarrassed by so much cordiality. The conversation freewheeled: the October crisis, agricultural production, the clich√©s and the tedium of the official documents produced by the Communist parties of Latin America (\"Socialism must not be boring but joyous\"), relations with the States and, also, Doctor Zhivago. Castro said that he had read it, in instalments, in the Diario de la Marina, in Batista's time. Feltrinelli turned to Riva: \"Those rats! They published a pirate edition!\"\n\nAt the end of the visit, Feltrinelli noted down his first impressions: \"In my opinion, FC is not a Communist or Marxist. He is a middle-class Utopian and idealist (whose Utopia once came true). He runs this country as if it was his company (poor application of the American executive philosophy). He has to be idealist because, as in all countries in Africa or Latin America, there is no bourgeoisie.\"\n\nCastro's words of farewell to everyone were \"See you soon\". Naturally, no one could say when. Patience was required. On February19, Feltrinelli wrote to the collaborators of the publishing house: \"After having waited for two weeks, in which we have had only one interview with the Supreme Beard, we had made up our minds to leave. But on the day of our departure, we received word of a new evening visit, so okay, we'll put off our departure. And that evening, in fact, he arrived, in a good mood and said, come to my house tomorrow at nine and we'll get down to work together. We went, and we found him wearing slippers and pajama jacket and pants and naturally his beard, and for two hours we got in some good work. The most important fact is that we are authorised to show up every morning at nine at his house and we no longer have to wait for him. A decisive step. When he is in a good mood, he talks willingly and a lot. But you have to keep him off his favourite subject. Which is cows. He dreams of boundless cattle farms and, with a certain sexual satisfaction, of the artificial insemination of one hundred thousand cows that in 1965 would give him one hundred thousand calves, of which fifty thousand would be females that could be made pregnant in their turn... and so on, for ever and ever, amen.\"\n\nOn the roof of the house there was a small chicken coop and a basketball hoop. In the breaks, Giangiacomo and Fidel would take a few shots at the basket while Inge photographed their one-on-one matches. After a month of work with the stenographer, Feltrinelli went back home. He left Riva to carry on.\n\nAfter the publisher's departure, work on the Castro book came to a standstill almost immediately. Castro was enthusiastic about the project, but always had something else to do.\n\nIn June 1967, Feltrinelli was writing a letter to Lyndon Johnson, the US president:\n\nDear Mr President,\n\nI am a leading Italian publisher.\n\nFrom time to time, my authors, because of their writings, incur the wrath of governments: as a publisher, it is my duty to do whatever I can to guarantee their freedom and to help them be heard.\n\nTen years ago, it was the case of Boris Pasternak, who was attacked by the Soviet Writers Association and by the League of Communist Youth. I was Mr Pasternak's publisher at that time. Today, it is the case of R√©gis Debray, a young French philosopher who is the author of A Revolution Within The Revolution. Debray was arrested by the Bolivian police at the end of April, 1967 mainly because he wrote this book. As the publisher of Mr Debray, I ask you, Mr President, to exert all your powerful influence for the immediate release of R√©gis Debray.\n\nWashington did not make a prompt reply.\n\nIn Europe, not much was known about Bolivia, the guerrilla war, or of Debray. On April 19, 1967, Debray had been arrested with the Argentine Ciro Bustos and the Anglo-Chilean photographer George Roth. Their capture gave the Bolivian military proof that Che Guevara was in Bolivia. Fidel felt that a campaign of solidarity was urgently required to draw international attention to the Debray case. The Cubans proposed that my father personally follow the trial scheduled to be held in the coming weeks.\n\nOn his arrival in Bolivia, Feltrinelli checked into one of the two grand hotels of the capital. The city was swarming with journalists who were not journalists, informers who were informing God knows whom, tourists who were not real tourists, Anglo-Chileans, Franco-Argentines, German-Bolivians, Cuban-Americans and Guatemalan-Danes. All bustling about, but keeping a low profile.\n\nOn the morning of August 17, Feltrinelli realised that he was being tailed, and the following afternoon two plain-clothes officers presented themselves at his hotel and escorted him to the offices of the DIC (the Bolivian criminal investigations department). The interrogation was conducted directly by the CIA, but produced no results.\n\nOn August 19, all the Italian popular press ran the story. La Notte of Milan had the headline \"Publisher Feltrinelli vanishes in Bolivia\". The Italian President Saragat and foreign minister Fanfani intervened immediately. Thanks to them, the Bolivian authorities expelled Giangiacomo Feltrinelli after one day and two nights in jail.\n\nIn May 1972, the Bolivian Minister of the Interior, Antonio Arguedas, was to issue a surprising statement. He said that, in August 1967, Feltrinelli had offered the Bolivians a ransom of $50 million for Che, in the event of his capture. The CIA said that the deal was out of the question. True or false? All the Cubans would say, was, \"The only instructions we gave him were to go to La Paz.\"\n\nIn January 1968, Feltrinelli returned to Cuba once more. This time he was accompanied by Enrico Filippini from the publishing house who was to recall the trip in an article for La Repubblica. \"I heard Feltrinelli make a speech in Spanish that only an Italian could have understood. I grasped a few comments. He wanted to let the Cubans know that his function as a European publisher had ceased, that he thought of himself only as 'a fighter against imperialism'.\"\n\nDuring his stay on the island, Feltrinelli worked on an essay on the Italian situation, called Guerrilla Warfare And Revolutionary Politics. In his text, Feltrinelli offers a few examples of \"vanguard strategies\", mentioning South Vietnam and Venezuela, that were needed to orientate the future struggles of the Italian working class. The Italian secret services considered Feltrinelli's ideas rather unoriginal, if not downright comical. But from then on their surveillance became even more obsessive.\n\nLate that spring, an urgent invitation arrived from Havana. When Feltrinelli landed, he learned that Castro wanted to give him and Maspero (another publisher) a copy of Che's Bolivian diary, which had been smuggled out of La Paz by Arguedas: this was Operation \"Aunt Victoria\". Holed up in a little villa in Vedado, Feltrinelli translated the text in a couple of nights. The diary was to come out in Italy in 1968, and the rights were passed on with no charge to the publishers of half the world. The cover of the Italian edition bore the legend: \"The proceeds of this publication will be donated entirely to the revolutionary movements of Latin America.\" Questions were asked in parliament. Feltrinelli printed thousands of posters from the negative of the famous photo by Alberto Korda and had them hung in his bookshops.\n\nA diplomat in the Cuban embassy, Andr√©s Del R√≠o, was bemused when Feltrinelli handed him a suitcase full of banknotes: \"The proceeds.\" Del R√≠o did not know what to do with all that money, and so the suitcase was transformed into a bank deposit amounting to more than half a million Swiss francs. The name of the account? The functionary still remembers it: \"R√≠o Verde\".\n\nWhen 1968, the year of the √©v√©nements in Paris, came along, Feltrinelli was ready. Shortly before this great historical moment, he had become convinced that the taking up of arms had become inevitable. On his return from Bolivia, he found numerous messages of solidarity, and he received invitations to speak in public from all over: Florence, Lugano, Novara, Palermo, Catania, Rome... How to give the Italian left a revolutionary strategy once more? What was the lesson of the struggles in the third world?\n\nFeltrinelli was determined to tackle what he believed was the imminent danger: an Italian-style coup d'√©tat. That year, the squares and the streets of Italy were embellished with new slogans: leftists favoured things such as \"The university is our Vietnam\" and \"Agnelli, The shop floor is our Indochina!\"; and rightists chanted \"Let's cut the crap/Bring in the Colonels\" or \"First Athens, then Rome!\"\n\nItems from the family chronology of 1968.\n\nMay 1. Gg took part in the Berlin demonstration. The Italian intelligence services warned the Germans that Feltrinelli was a dangerous individual with a \"frenetically subversive personality\".\n\nMay 12. Gg bumped into a group of students in front of La Scala theatre. They attacked him verbally; he was not one of them.\n\nEnd of May. In France, Gg was on the list of foreigners deemed persona non grata. The French maintained that he had financed half of the extra-parliamentary left-wing groups of Paris.\n\nJune 24. Family lunch in via Andegari. Gg reacted badly when Inge told him that his publishing house was falling apart.\n\nNovember 14. Strike at Feltrinelli.\n\nIn Battipaglia, on April 9, the police fired on demonstrators during the general strike: two people died and 200 were injured.\n\nOn the night of August 8-9, a spate of explosions rocked about 10 trains and stations. Others were found unexploded. Was this the dress rehearsal for a right-wing coup?\n\nFeltrinelli was preparing to face such a coup. In the Apennines above Genoa, he rented a farmhouse procured for him by the ex- partisan Giovanbattista Lazagna. The message was to stand ready for guerrilla action. In the farmhouse, three sealed crates, a Winchester carbine and a Colt Cobra revolver appeared.\n\nMilan, December 12: 16 dead and 84 injured in an explosion at the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricultura in the piazza Fontana.\n\nOn the morning of December 13, one name rang out for the first time during the packed press conference in Milan police headquarters. Some journalists asked police chief Guida if it was true that the publisher Feltrinelli had been arrested. He paused before replying, and all present were left free to speculate as they wished. \"For the present,\" another pause, \"the publisher has not been arrested.\"\n\nOn December14, Inspector Allegra requested a warrant to search the offices and home of Feltrinelli: \"There is reason to believe that in his domicile and in the offices of the publishing house there is evidence pertinent to the bombing.\" Ugo Paolillo, the judge who received the request, turned it down.\n\nMy father heard about piazza Fontana from a radio news broadcast. It was in the chalet in Oberhof, which Sibilla (officially fourth wife since early 1969, with a wedding in Lugano) was transforming into a real home. His reaction, as he listened to the news, was immediate: \"It's like the burning of the Reichstag.\"\n\nHe had to make up his mind. To go back to Milan, place himself at the disposal of the police and defend himself against the accusations; or to go the other way, into clandestinity, for which he was already prepared. He headed for Genoa. It wasn't a random decision; Genoa is the \"red\" city by definition, home to many people who fought in the resistance. He hid in Lazagna's house. Here, he collected his thoughts and sent off a letter to his staff. He said he had opted for \"untraceability\". \"It is the only condition that allows me to serve the cause of Socialism.\""
