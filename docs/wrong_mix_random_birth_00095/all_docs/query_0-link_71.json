        "text": "The Summer Jam at Watkins Glen was a July 1973 rock festival outside Watkins Glen, New York, that featured the Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead, and the Band. The July 28, 1973 event long held the Guinness Book of World Records entry for “largest audience at a pop festival,” with an estimated 600,000 fans in attendance at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Raceway. Approximately 150,000 tickets were purchased in advance, the rest being admitted in what became a “free concert”.\n\nAnalog is proud to present this night as a tribute to this historic event with an incredible lineup of musicians and vocalists.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nPETER LEVIN\n\nPeter Levin is just, oh man! Hes a little more Leon Russell and Billy Preston. Hes a hell of a Hammond player. – Gregg Allman\n\nHes one of the most versatile and soulful cats Ive ever been in the studio with. He was great on Gregg Allmans Southern Blood. – Don Was, producer\n\nPeter Levin is my favorite keyboard player in the whole world. Hes one of the finest musicians I know, too. His playing is otherworldly and he plays with contagious love and joy. Peter Levin rules. – Amanda Shires\n\nPeter Levin is one of the finest keyboardists Ive had the pleasure of working with. Always intuitive, creative, and ready. Looking forward to the next time we work together. – Steve Berlin, Los Lobos\n\n5 x Grammy Nominated writer, producer, and keyboardist Peter Levin has long been in demand for his musicianship, good ears, tasty soulful playing in any setting, and good vibes that make any band better. Levin has toured and/or recorded with a host of blues and Americana luminaries for the past decade, including Gregg Allman, Amanda Shires, Aaron Neville, Ringo Starr, The Highwomen, Marcus King, the Allman Betts Band, the Blind Boys of Alabama, the OJays, and Dolly Parton. Before all that, he already had a diverse background working in the studio with the likes of Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys, and crushing it onstage with Manhattan jam band kings the Zen Tricksters, God Street Wine, and Robert Randolphs Family Band.\n\nLevins virtuosity, great ear, and ability to make any session he plays on better knows no genre boundaries. Recently, he has been working with Pharrell Williams and his new band Virginia, playing keys on the album Black Yacht Rock and on Pharrells musical movie Atlantis. Levin has long been more than just a great player; he also co-wrote the song Dont Call Me on the Highwomens album and co-wrote Inglewood Motel (Halestorm) with Marcus King on the latters Mood Swings record. He also co-wrote and produced the Grammy-nominated song The Message for the Blind Boys of Alabama and co-wrote several tunes with Shires on her most recent album, Take It Like A Man.\n\nAfter graduating with honors from The University of Rochester/Eastman School of Music, Levin spent years as a warrior in the New York musical trenches while also doing sessions on gold and platinum records by the likes of Train, Korn, and Gym Class Heroes. While in High School, Levin also studied drums and percussion at the renowned Drummers Collective in NYC and Berklee College of Music in Boston. Levins big turning point came in 2008 when he was hired as the Blind Boys of Alabamas keyboardist. His first appearance with the legendary gospel group was on Late Night with Conan OBrien, a prime example of being thrown into the deep end and learning to swim. Recording and touring the world as a member of the Blind Boys band, Levin began to concentrate more and more on the Hammond organ, which was central to their sound.\n\nI wasnt schooled in the southern gospel music that everyone else in the band knew but I had really good ears and the singers liked the way I played so much that they nicknamed me Church Boy, Levin recalls with a laugh. That immersion in gospel roots and Hammond B3 mastery paid off in 2014, when Levin began playing with Allman, developing a close personal and musical bond over the next four years. I interviewed Gregg in 2015 before the release of his live album Back to Macon and the first thing he wanted to tell me was that he regretted the show was recorded before we got my new keyboardist. Unsolicited, Gregg wanted to sing Levins praises. Peter Levin is just… Oh, man! Hes a hell of a Hammond player. This was the ultimate compliment Allman could give a keyboardist and it humbled Levin to hear it. He was speechless when I called him with the news. Gregg had never quite told Peter what he thought of his playing. That wasnt his way, and neither was extravagant praise, and Peter immediately understood the significance of Greggs comment. Any listener paying attention to Levin behind an organ will hear what Gregg heard: a hell of a Hammond player forged in the trenches of American music and carrying a proud and honorable tradition forward.\n\nThe ability to tour and record with both the Blind Boys and Gregg is something I hold very dear, Levin says. Through them, I was able to meet and play with people like Aretha Franklin, Mavis Staples, Allen Touissant, and Aaron Neville. These are true American music legends, and I cherish my time playing music and just being around all of them.\n\nFollowing Allmans 2017 death, Levin relocated from New York to Nashville and began playing with Amanda Shires and others in town. Hes in demand as a session player, working with producers like Dave Cobb and Steve Berlin. When Shires, Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile, and Natalie Hemby came together in 2019 to form the country supergroup The Highwomen and record a self-titled album with Cobb, they could have hired any keyboard player in Nashville. They chose Levin – and no one who has followed Peters career for the last 20 years was surprised.\n\nPeter Levin is an American musical master. – Alan Paul, Author, One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band and Texas Flood: The Inside Story of Stevie Ray Vaughan\n\nNICKI BLUHM\n\nA San Franciscan now calling Tennessee home, Nicki Bluhm possesses a modern, clear-eyed perspective that grabs the heart and keeps you holding on to every word.\n\nBluhms music career began in the Cow Hollow area of San Francisco, where she recorded two solo albums and co-founded Nicki Bluhm and The Gramblers. The band wrote and performed their own music and recorded covers nostalgic to their childhoods, including the Hall and Oates classic I Cant Go For That. After gaining widespread attention for their Van Sessions on YouTube, they toured internationally and recorded two albums as a band.\n\nFollowing appearances and collaborations with artists such as Phil Lesh, Dawes, The Band of Heathens, Little Feat, and The Infamous Stringdusters, Bluhms creative confidence is well-won, and her authentic voice charms audiences wherever it pops up.\n\nJD SIMO\n\nJD Simos talent has led to a vast career as a guitarist, producer, and band leader. His remarkable talent and versatility have led to playing on records with artists including Beyonc, Paul McCartney, James McCartney, Dolly Parton, Tommy Emmanuel, Jack White, Cowboy Jack Clement, David Kahne, Dave Cobb, Joe Bonamassa, Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, The War and Treaty, Peter Collins, Chris Isaak, Paul Worley, and Stevie Nicks.\n\nHes also been blessed to tour as a member of the Grateful Deads Phil Lesh & Friends.\n\nAs a further testament to his depth and range, JD did all of the guitar work on the soundtrack and score to Baz Luhrmanns film Elvis.\n\nHe tours in support of his solo projects, often with frequent collaborations with Luther Dickinson, Anson Funderburgh, Jimmy Hall, Kirk Fletcher, Devon Allman, Duane Betts, Patrick Sweany, Tal Wilkenfeld, and Adam Abrashoff.\n\nBEN SPARACO\n\nBen Sparaco is a Nashville-based guitarist, producer, and songwriter. Originally from South Florida, he has spent the last decade touring nationally as a sideman, as well as performing original music with Slow Pass, and Ben Sparaco and The New Effect. He has also toured extensively with Allman Brothers Band founder Butch Trucks Freight Train Band and nationally-acclaimed Grateful Dead tribute act The Stolen Faces. Ben was named one of Relix Magazines 5 Artists You Need To Know and is an in-demand guitarist for sessions and live shows in Nashville and beyond.\n\nTED PECCHIO\n\nTed Pecchio is an American bassist and currently a member of Doyle Bramhall II’s touring group. Prior to that, he played with Colonel Bruce Hampton and the Codetalkers and Susan Tedeschi. Pecchio was born in Youngstown, Ohio, and is the son of Daniel Pecchio, bassist for the bands Glass Harp and The Michael Stanley Band.\n\nGREG MORROW\n\nGreg Morrow is an American drummer, percussionist, session musician, mixing engineer, and vocalist.\n\nMorrow was born in Ripley, Tennessee, and raised in Memphis. At age 11, Morrow and his band performed on a local TV show, and he participated in his first recording session.\n\nWhile working as a teen at the Drum Stand, Morrow’s mentor was Dave Patrick, who taught him about drums and drum construction.\n\nIn the 1980s, Morrow toured and recorded with the Christian ensemble DeGarmo and Key. Morrow then was a part of Amy Grant’s touring band.\n\nMorrow moved from Memphis in 1996 after encouragement from Norbert Putnam and Chad Cromwell.\n\nMorrow is a member of Big Al Andersons band The World Famous Headliners, along with Shawn Camp, Pat McLaughlin, and Michael Rhodes.\n\nMorrow has performed and recorded with Blake Shelton, Don Henley, Joe Bonamassa, Billy Gibbons, Bob Seger, Luke Bryan, the Dixie Chicks, Kacey Musgraves, Steve Earle, and others.\n\nJoin us for another installment of Analog Soul featuring Will Davenport, The Smoke Show, and Boulevards!\n\nABOUT WILL DAVENPORT\n\nMore than words on a page or notes to a melody- William Davenport has had an intimate relationship with music that dates back to his childhood in Atlanta, GA. A soulful spirit with gospel roots, he scribes music reminiscent of mature love in its truest form. From his beginning days, William has been lauded as a true balladeer and music prodigy skilled in piano, guitar, violin, and organ. While in college pursuing a degree in Engineering, William appeared in and won several high-profile talent shows including the Embassy Records National Talent Search, and the opportunity to be a singer/songwriter for Neyos recording label, Compound Entertainment. More recently, William has continued to be recognized as an independent artist, including being spotlighted in the BET Music Matters campaign.\n\nNo stranger to the stage, William has shared a stage with legends such as India Arie, Will Downing, Boney James, Laura Izibor, Mary Mary, and Kirk Whalum. A powerful voice in his own right, William continues to pen musical stories that genuinely reflect the heart songs of everyday love and sensuality while carving a career in the industry with his unique sound and undeniable talent.\n\nABOUT THE SMOKE SHOW\n\nJon “Smoke” Lucas, a musician since age 8, is a Nashville native, multi-instrumentalist & GRAMMY Award-winning musician with a passion for curating immersive live music experiences.\n\nLucas is a highly sought-after drummer and DJ within the local Music City scene. He has toured the US, Canada & Europe playing various genres including Country, Soul/R&B, Funk, Rock, Gospel, and Hip-Hop/Rap. Lucas has shared a stage with artists such as Billy Ray Cyrus, Robert Randolph, Gramps Morgan, Indie Arie, Chris Janson, James Otto, Bas, Mr. Talkbox, Shannon Sanders, John Oates, Bob Weir, Meghan Linsey, CeCe Winans & more.\n\nABOUT BOULEVARDS18-month\n\nIn February 2022, Boulevards, the project led by musician Jamil Rashad, released its fourth studio album, Electric Cowboy: Born in Carolina Mud. That album culminated years of slow building and provided the Raleigh, N.C. native the breakthrough he deserved. After an 18-month, rigorous run, he wasnt ready to take a deserved break.\n\nUpon Electric Cowboys release, Rashads creative ideas continued to flow. He reached out to friends and collaborators, like writer Gentle Nature and J.J. Whitefield of German funk group The Poets of Rhythm, and began to mold his new ideas into full-fledged songs. After the campaign for Electric Cowboy wound down, Rashad returned to his home state of North Carolina and got to work on his fifth studio album.\n\nAs the song ideas flowed, Rashad explored the importance of self-reflection and personal experiences, particularly themes of love and vulnerability. Drawing from that prism and channeling the joy of his recent engagement, the artist had plenty of positive momentum heading into the recording sessions.\n\nAfter Electric Cowboy was released, I thought hard about my intentions for the next album, shares Rashad. The objective was to make a record that echoes the spirit of my live shows and reflects the truest me.\n\nCarolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road is a tip of the cap to his home and will be released by the New West Records imprint Normaltown Records. At Killion Studios in Los Angeles, Rashad teamed with producer Sergio Rios (Neal Francis, Say She She, Orgone) to create an album chock full of memorable uptempo Southern Fried Funk. For the first time in Rashads career, he recorded live and straight to tape, capturing the true essence of these songs, which were brought to life by Dan Hastie (keys), Dale Jennings (bass), and Sam Halterman (drums).\n\nWorking with Sergio Rios as a producer allowed me to refine my vision while preserving the raw, infectious sound that feels most authentic to me, Rashad adds.\n\nWith an assist from Whitefield, Rashad captured the raw, crunchy sounds hed been hoping to incorporate into his recordings. The album also features the handy work of Mike Buckley (Daptones, Budos Band, Jalen Ngonda), who composed the horn parts, Blake Rhein (Durand Jones & The Indications), and Kendra Morris (Colemine Records). This is the album that finally captures the energy of Rashads high-octane live show onto wax. Black Pumas virtuoso Adrian Quesada and Will Grantham mixed Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road, giving Rashad the exact sound he sought to capture.\n\nRashad points to What We Live For as one of his favorite songs from the 10-song collection. In the past, hes hidden his personal lyrics underneath the power of his groove-laden instrumentals. Not here. He admits that hearing the finished version gave him chills and he teared up a bit. At its heart, its what Carolina Funk is about celebrating love. As tender as What We Live For is, Rashad didnt want to get too hung up on sentimentality. The songs rhythm and melody are club-ready with its funk soul.\n\nThe same goes for Run and Move. Describing the fears of vulnerability in a relationship, Rashad brings an astute perspective to describing human nature. Despite it being one of his favorite songs, he admits that it was one of the toughest to track in the studio. Even so, the collection captures Rashads ethos as an artist and is his most well-rounded to date.\n\nLike any great artist, Rashad writes in a fashion that is true to himself, yet has the ability for his rapidly expanding fan base to relate to. With Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road, Rashad shows that he cant stop and wont stop channeling his creativity into funk-powered hits."
