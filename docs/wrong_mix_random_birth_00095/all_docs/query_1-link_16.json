        "text": "Each summer, the development of young officials continues at the USA Hockey Officiating Development Camps. These camps are used to identify and prepare officials for junior, collegiate, and professional competition, and provide all participants with the fundamental skills needed to return home to their grassroots hockey community and be the best amateur hockey officials they can become. Many of the top officials in the United States have progressed through the various summer development camps, and USA Hockey recruits the top instructors available from professional and collegiate leagues to educate and evaluate the participants in all aspects of officiating. Here is a brief synopsis of each of the camps.\n\nNote: The USA Hockey District Referees-in-Chief have more information regarding each of the development camps. All interested officials that meet the criteria for participation should contact their District RIC. Applications must be submitted to the District RIC by the prescribed deadline.\n\n\"USA Hockey has instructors that are second-to-none. The ice sessions were challenging. The classroom sessions were informative. The environment was outstanding and allowed for development. Everything about this camp emphasized becoming a better official. There was no 'fluff' at all. Though it was a mental grind, I can confidently say that after leaving camp, I can go out and conquer the next level with what I've learned and implemented. Not only that, but I can share what I've learned and help others to reach their goals as well.\" - Michael (Hamburg, NY)\n\n\"The other officials here were a blast. We all had a great time pushing each other on and off the ice and joking around with each other during downtime. I made some great friends here that I hope to see again down the road during my officiating career.\" - Kyle (Richmond, VA)\n\n\"USA Hockey Officiating Summer Camps offer three years of developmental content in less than a week. The opportunity to work a game, and get immediate feedback repeatedly is invaluable. The programs also offer campers an unusual amount of development time with top-level instructors.\" - Dan (Denver, CO)\n\nFUTURES CAMPS\n\nOBJECTIVE - This camp is a thoroughly educational review of the fundamentals of amateur ice hockey officiating.
