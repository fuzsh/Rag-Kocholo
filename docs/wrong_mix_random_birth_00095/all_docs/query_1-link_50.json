        "text": "Lord Mayors of the City of Oxford\n\n1962–today\n\n“Since 1963 [Oxford] has boasted a Lord Mayor, instead of a plain Mayor, a distinction which it shares with\n\n18 other English cities and which means, pomp apart, nothing whatsoever” (James Morris, 1965)\n\nAbove: New Lord Mayor of Oxford Mary Clarkson with outgoing Lord Mayor Susanna Pressel on her right parading through Queen Street on 25 May 2009. Behind them are the new Deputy Lord Mayor John Goddard and Sheriff of Oxford Elise Benjamin\n\nBelow: Three former Labour Lord Mayors at the Remembrance Day Parade in St Giles on 13 November 2005: Carol Roberts (1998/9), Maureen Christian (2000/1), and Gill Sanders (2002/3)\n\nBill Buckingham, Lord Mayor 1994/5\n\nList of every Lord Mayor of Oxford from 1962 to the present\n\nTheir year of office started in May except for the first, Evan Roberts, who was elected plain Mayor in May 1962, but served as Lord Mayor from 23 October 1962 for the last five months of his year of office. The first to be elected Lord Mayor from the start was Alec Percivel Parker who served from May 1963.\n\nThe following is a list only, and there is no plan to add biographies. Where, however, the Lord Mayor in question happens to have an entry in Wikipedia, a link is provided; and a note is made if they have a full entry in the Oxford Dictionary for National Biography (ODNB).\n\nPrior to 1962 only four women served as Mayor of Oxford, but since that date another 21 women (shown in red below) have served as Lord Mayor.\n\nAbove: Bill Fagg, Lord Mayor 1975/6\n\n(and also from 21 May to 6 July 1987)\n\nRight: Queenie Whorley, Lord Mayor 1988/9\n\nLord Mayor’s Parade\n\nThis takes place in Oxford each year on the Bank Holiday Monday at the end of May,\n\nsoon after the new Lord Mayor starts his or her term of office.\n\nLord Mayor’s Parade 2007\n\nLord Mayor’s Parade 2008\n\nLord Mayor’s Parade 2009\n\nLord Mayor’s Parade 2010\n\nThe election of Lord Mayor usually takes place in May each year (immediately after any city council elections). Section 37 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 established the date of local elections throughout the country as the first Thursday in May (but this can be postponed by Statutory Instrument to June if it is necessary that the election coincides with those to the European Parliament)"
