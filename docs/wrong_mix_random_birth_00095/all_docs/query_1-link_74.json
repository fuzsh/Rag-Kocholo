        "text": "July 14th, 2024\n\nWhat’s up bitches?\n\nI was raised during a time when Tabasco sauce and dish soap were the acceptable remedies for the polluted mouth of a youngster. Profanity is for the inarticulate, is a phrase I hear in my father’s voice—a sentiment instilled to inspire a creative and meaningful vocabulary. Although I can humor this in specific instances, especially from a parental standpoint—it isn’t that simple.\n\nThe parental instinct to shield children from choice words is respectable but ineffective in its execution. Studies have shown that children learn cursing by age two and upon entering school have a working vocabulary of over thirty offensive words. This isn’t to say that parents should eliminate their role in distinguishing inappropriate words to their children. In fact, parents and caregivers have a profound role in retaining the power of such words. If children don’t internalize the taboo-ness of swearing, the societal implications would diminish and fail to extract a strong emotive response.\n\nHere is a personal testimony to this theory:\n\nAside from the occasional slip of shit and damn in my household, both of my parents kept it pretty PG. The first time I heard my mother say fuck, I was 16 and quite literally fell to the ground in uncontrollable teary-eyed laughter. The use of this word was fueled by sincere irritation, met with humor, and followed by a cathartic response from both parties. My laughter provoked hers, and I’d argue that it transformed her initial state of frustration. Had I heard this word frequently from her mouth and used in the same situation, this moment would fail to be a memory—one that still makes me smile to this day.\n\nThis is the power of profanity.\n\nCussing and swearing aren’t reserved exclusively for the uneducated and illiterate. Katherine Dunn, the American journalist, novelist, and poet reminds us that, “Cuss words and phrases, whatever they may be in our vocabularies, are the most potent words we have for expressing emotion.” But like all words, they can be used, abused, wrung out and hanged to dry until they are completely devoid of meaning. In the event that coarse words lose their potency, Dunn states that these become expletives: “any word or phrase that adds nothing to the meaning of the sentence” (Dunn 2019). It is our job then, to use them less generously and in more inventive ways.\n\nBeyond everyday use, profanity is an essential element to understanding cognitive linguistics. There is significant evidence that swear words are not stored in the same part of the brain as normal language and aphasia patients help support this claim. Usually caused by a stroke or head injury, aphasia results in disordered language and incomprehensible speech patterns. The sophistication of vocabulary left intact varies, but retainment of profane words is a recorded pattern that dates back as early as the 19th century, when the neuroscientist Jaques Lordat suffered a life-altering stroke, temporarily stripping his ability to speak.\n\nLordat eventually recovered and pursued research involving people of similar brain traumas. One such case was published in 1843, where he studied a parish priest and stroke survivor who could only speak two words. Benjamin K. Bergen, author of What The F, reports, “The first was je, the French word for ‘I’. Perhaps unsurprising, if you’re only going to retain one word. But the other word was, at the time, unimaginable for a parish priest.” The second word, he concludes, “was the French word foutre, which by coincidence happens to start with the same letter as its English translation: fuck” (Bergen 2018). This historic record is not an isolated case. Modern accounts of foul language retainment in aphasia patients continue to unfold (Fowler 2016) and invite us to inquire on the evolutionary purpose of swear words.\n\nObvious provocations aside, profanity carries the unique ability to promote connection. Michael Adams, author of In Praise of Profanity, contends that “…bad words are unexpectedly useful in fostering human relations because they carry risk—so that use of them demands trust—but not the traditional risk of taboo. We like to get away with things, and sometimes we do so with like-minded people.” There is a richness in transforming indecent language into terms of endearment. There is an intimacy and playfulness in being able to greet your friends as bitches, no? Adams maintains that “…profanity in such relationships matters a lot precisely because it doesn’t, because the participants feel such complete comfort with each other that they can be impolite together—that’s one of the many paradoxes accompanying our use of profanity.”\n\nLanguage is our medicine and ammunition. It is the most omnipotent, versatile force in the tool box. It is the toolbox. Profanity is no exception, and as the late Samuel Beckett would say: words are all we have.\n\nLove,\n\nMarta"
