        "text": "Hello! I’m from Washington, D.C. I attended the University of Michigan for undergrad where I studied English and Biology, and then Wake Forest for medical school. Before medical school, I worked as an EMT in Detroit and, during my summers, used my WEMT to lead backcountry kayaking trips in the Rockies. EM has always been where I hoped I would end up in medicine, and has been my passion from the get-go. Outside of medicine, I’m an avid whitewater kayaker, biker, and climber. I also love to make things – some of the projects I’m most proud of include a working pocket watch and a wood-carved relief map of the Grand Canyon.\n\nI was born and raised in Charlottesville (graduated from WAHS) and started my undergrad at Brigham Young University. After completing freshman year, I spent 2 years as a missionary in Cuiabá, Brazil, after which I returned and completed my undergraduate degree at BYU. That was also where I met my wife, Rebekah, and we were married a year before starting medical school at the Penn State College of Medicine. During medical school, our three boys, Charlie, Richie, and Teddy, were born. My hobbies include tinkering with technology, and as a family we enjoy DIY projects, puddle jumping, and anything involving the outdoors (camping, hiking, biking, and campfire cooking). We are very excited to return to Charlottesville and be a part of UVA EM!\n\nHi! I grew up in Tampa, Florida and have been making my way up the East Coast over the last few years. I went to Florida State for undergrad (go Noles!) and attended Wake Forest for medical school (go Deacs!). My interest for EM began while I was working as a scribe in the ED during my gap year. This continued to grow throughout medical school and, after discovering my passion for Global Health and Social EM, I knew I couldn’t turn back! Outside of the hospital I love exploring the outdoors, gardening, finding the best coffee shops in town and baking.\n\nHi, my name is Ola El Kebbi, born and raised in Beirut, the city that made me fall in love with Emergency Medicine. I completed my MD with a minor in biomedical engineering at the American University of Beirut before pursuing a two year research fellowship in Pediatric Emergency Medicine at the same institution. I then completed an intern year in Pediatrics in New York City before finally matching into Emergency Medicine here at UVA EM! My interests include research, medical education, and quality improvement. In my free time, I love to paint while listening to random podcasts. My friends rely on me when it comes to organizing camping trips, barbecues, and hikes. Also, you can always count on me for new music recommendations and beautiful biking routes.\n\nHello! I was born and raised in Midlothian, VA. I attended Virginia Tech for college, VCU for post-bacc, Liberty for med school, and am now at UVA for residency! But long before becoming a Hokie, Ram, Flame, or Cavalier, I always wanted to be a doctor. Eventually, my experiences as an ED scribe would completely sell me on the magical chaos that is Emergency Medicine. It is a privilege to match at UVA and entrust my training to some of the best educators that medicine can offer. As for long-term EM goals, I like to teach and hope to take part in mentoring the next generation of physicians.\n\nOutside of medicine, I enjoy going out with friends for drinks and Karaoke! You can also find me at home playing the guitar or Super Smash Bros. Melee. If you sing/play an instrument, we should definitely jam. Thanks for reading! 🙂\n\nHi guys! I got the opportunity to bounce around a bit growing up. After some awesome stints in Hawaii and South Korea, I was lucky enough to land in Virginia and attend UVA for undergrad. After, I went to the Frank H Netter School of Medicine up in Connecticut and had a great time, but I’m stoked to come back to UVA and Charlottesville. My educational interests primarily revolve around wilderness and disaster medicine. When I’m not in the hospital or punishing myself with question banks, I love anything that gets me active and outside. Skiing is my favorite hobby, and I’m trying to learn to mountain bike with as few C-collars necessary as possible. On chill days, I try to cook new, and what are now mostly edible, foods and throw unreasonable amounts of various things on the grill.\n\nHey! My name is Jai and I am one of the Emergency Medicine residents. I am very lucky to be a part of our incredible crew here at UVA. I was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and moved to Cincinnati as an adolescent (big Bengals fan here, Who Dey!). I most recently lived in northern Virginia and went to medical school here at UVA.\n\nI spend my non-hospital time going to the gym, spending time with my wonderful niece and nephew, playing soccer and basketball, and making music. I have been trying to practice electric guitar recently and really enjoy the learning process of learning a new instrument! I love the city of Charlottesville and all the food spots – although I make an unhealthy amount of visits to Raising Cane’s. The Rivanna Trail, the Frisbee golf course off of 29, the Quirk Rooftop, and Carter Mountain are some of my favorite places here in Charlottesville.\n\nHi! I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington all the way out on the west coast! I went to a small university in my hometown for college where I got to play soccer. I then went to the University of Washington for medical school! My husband and I couples matched and are both thrilled to be moving to beautiful Charlottesville for each of our residency training! I love to explore the outdoors, hang out with my dog Nellie, and play any sport or game although not always well!\n\nHey all! I was born in Saudi Arabia where I lived for 10 years before relocating to Egypt. In Egypt, I grew up in a small village called Elshmout where my favorite activities were cycling and berry picking. I graduated from the College of Human Medicine at Banha University in Egypt where I fell in love with emergency medicine. My interests in medicine include global health and medical education. I am super excited to join the UVA EM team and live in beautiful Charlottesville for the next 3 years. When I am not video calling my family, I enjoy reading, playing chess, cycling, swimming, watching comedies, and hanging out with my friends.\n\nHello! My name is Ethan and I am originally from a small town outside of Baltimore called Sykesville. I attended James Madison University for undergrad (Go Dukes!) where I volunteered as an EMT, then completed a Master’s in DC before returning to Virginia for medical school at EVMS. I am beyond excited to return to the mountains of VA and continue my education at UVA! My interests in EM include ultrasound, prehospital medicine, and wilderness medicine. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, camping, trivia, exploring breweries, and spending time with my border collie, Kona.\n\nHi! My name is Sigal, and I’m originally from Indianapolis. I went to Indiana University for a degree in Psychology and Spanish, and then for medical school. I got interested in medicine after spending a year in Israel, during which I was a first responder with the ambulance service in Haifa. My husband and I are so excited to live in the beautiful mountains of Charlottesville, and I’m so happy to be part of the UVA EM team! Within EM, I’m interested in global health, public health, and pretty much everything else. Outside of EM, I love a good hike, camp, cycle or run, or some crochet on the couch with a sitcom on.\n\nHola! I’m originally from Manatí, Puerto Rico. I went to Penn State (We Are!) for undergrad where I majored in Biology. I then returned to Puerto Rico for medical school at Ponce Health Sciences University. I am super excited and happy to join the UVA EM team and explore all the things Charlottesville has to offer. Outside of medicine, I love nearly all sports but by far my favorite is fútbol (Hala Madrid!). On top of that, I love traveling, going to the beach, video games, music, and any type of outdoor activities. Oh, and I have Panda German Shepherd who probably loves the beach as much as I do.\n\nHello! I’m from Lexington, VA, where I was an EMT and volunteer firefighter throughout high school. I went to Wake Forest for undergrad, where I studied chemistry. After graduating, I spent a year doing medical research in NYC before heading to DC for a master’s degree and then medical school. I’m delighted to be returning to Virginia for residency and join the UVA EM family. In my free time, I enjoy drinking coffee, playing tennis, cooking, and spending as much time outside as possible.\n\nHey/Hola! I was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, went to the University of Puerto Rico – Mayaguez Campus for undergrad and went to medical school at Ponce Health Sciences University. I’ve been all around my little island and have lived there my whole life. I am super excited to be here in UVA and experience something new with the wonderful people at this program. My interest in emergency medicine started with a shadowing experience I had my first year of med school. I was in the busy ED of a hospital in the south of PR, and the attending ran to where I was eating lunch and told me “come quick we are doing an emergency pacemaker and you’re going to help”. I saw so many procedures and different people that I just fell in love with it then and there. Things about me: I love the beach (even though I’m always pale – sunblock people), I am always reading fun books, and currently I’m learning about hiking in VA. I’m excited for the snow and snowboarding too. Also I have a little toy poodle that I’m excited to see experience snow for the first time!\n\nHi! I was born in Chicago but raised in Charlotte, NC. I went to undergrad and grad school at UNC-Wilmington where I studied chemistry, but decided life in a lab wasn’t for me and took a left turn into medicine. I then went to medical school at Brody School of Medicine in eastern NC where I discovered my passion for emergency medicine! My EM interests include ultrasound, education, and wilderness medicine. Outside of medicine, you can find me mountain biking, rock climbing, going for long walks in the woods with my hound dog Kirk, playing the piano, or napping. I’m excited to move to gorgeous Charlottesville and be part of the UVA team!\n\nHey there! I’ve done a lot of moving, so it’s hard to say where I’m from, but I was born in Paraguay, partly raised in the States, then spent most of my late teens and adult life between Brazil and Argentina where I went to medical school and met my wife. We are very happy to be living in such a beautiful city and have a growing list of places we want to see and visit. I am thrilled to continue my learning as part of the UVA EM team, and hope to grow in areas of academic interest such as global EM and academics. Life outside of the hospital is important and revolves around family, friends and hobbies such as sports, outdoors and music!\n\nHey what’s up y’all! I was born in Fairfax, Virginia and moved to like…five different cities all throughout the state. I went to Virginia Tech (wow) for undergrad and then moved to the Electric City (Scranton, PA) at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine for my Master’s degree and MD. I love BBQ’ing, throwing socials, enjoying a nice cold brew, building furniture, fixing cars, home repair, pretending like I know how to surf, playing guitar to a mediocre degree, and the typical nature things that everyone likes! My academic interests include Global Health and Ultrasound. Having been here for just over a month, Charlottesville has not disappointed with so many different things to do. Too many things. I am beyond stoked to join the UVA EM family and can’t wait to see where this journey takes me!\n\nHi! My name is Nick. I am from Salem, OR. I graduated from Western Oregon University with a degree in Chemistry. I attended medical school at Pacific Northwest University in Washington State. My Wife, Sam, and I have two incredible daughters, Lyla and Kallie. Outside of medicine, I enjoy spending my time with the family, hiking, fishing, camping, barbequing. In the future my goal is to work in rural and underserved communities. I also hope to learn more about Global Medicine. We are looking forward to moving to Charlottesville and exploring all the outdoors activities it has to offer. I am so excited and beyond grateful to be joining the UVA EM Crew!\n\nHi there! Your typical Florida girl, I was born and raised in Tampa and went to the University of Florida for undergrad. My interest in emergency medicine began while I was working as a scribe in college. I attended medical school at George Washington University in DC, where I developed a passion for health policy. I am also incredibly passionate about innovation, specifically artificial intelligence integration into medical practice. I love the outdoors and am so excited to be spending the next 3 years in a place as beautiful as Charlottesville! If I’m not outside, I’m usually watching soccer (#YNWA) or listening to music and attempting to play things on my keyboard.\n\nHi! I’m originally from Mississippi, and I graduated from the University of Mississippi with a degree in English and went on to complete my medical degree and the UM School of Medicine. I’m a bit… atypical, as I completed a residency in Pediatrics at the University of Virginia, then a chief resident year, and then decided to continue my training in General Emergency Medicine! My wife, Vivian, and I (and now our dog, Sully, and our daughter, Nin) have been in Charlottesville for going on 5 years and I really can’t say enough good things about it. From the outdoor access (if you’re interested in mountain biking, hit me up!), to the food, to the live music and beyond, it’s truly a great place to live. With that in mind, the Emergency Medicine program is truly the cherry on top. The clinical experience balances education and patient care extremely well, the faculty is approachable, responsive, and loves to teach, and the collegiality within the program is excellent. Good luck to everyone applying this year, and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions!\n\nHola! I am originally from Peru, later moved to Northern Virginia, and went to Indiana for medical school. I became interested in EM when I started scribing, and now my interests lie in global health and critical care. Outside of medicine, I salsa dance and I backpack around the world whenever I get the chance. I am excited to live in Charlottesville, close to home, and check out all the outdoorsy activities it has to offer.\n\nMy name is John and I am from Denver, CO. Only after undergrad in Portland, OR and a little time ski-bumming around Colorado did I realize that medicine was my calling. I did a post-bac program at WashU in St. Louis, where I met my better half, Emily, and then went to Chicago for medical school at Rush Medical College. Now I can’t wait to join the UVA EM family and see what the next few years hold! In the ED, I’m interested in critical care, toxicology, and wilderness medicine. Outside the ED, our favorite things include our little old dog Sophie, hiking, cycling, climbing, skiing, cooking, and checking out all the breweries, wineries, coffee shops, and restaurants that we can.\n\nHello! I was born and raised in North Carolina before moving to Dallas during high school. I then went to Notre Dame for undergrad where I met my wonderful partner, Katie; afterwards I returned to the heat to attend medical school at UT Southwestern where I developed my interests in emergency medicine and medical education. Katie and I are thrilled to couples match here at UVA and we are incredibly excited to return to the east coast, where we envision our long term future. Outside of medicine, I love playing and watching soccer, golf, anything Notre Dame, and giving belly rubs to our dog, Teddy.\n\nHi, I’m Sarah! I’m from Johns Creek, GA, a suburb north of Atlanta and am proudly Ghanaian-American! I went to the University of Pennsylvania for undergrad and graduated with a B.A in biology, and then went to Boston University for an M.S in medical sciences. During grad school, I was first introduced to Emergency Medicine while working as a scribe, and I am convinced that’s where the seed was planted! I attended the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine for my MD and am interested in global health, wellness, and mentorship. In my free time I enjoy writing, watching game shows, old sitcoms and movie reruns, dancing/Zumba, singing, trying random grocery products, and traveling! I am thrilled to be joining UVA Emergency Medicine and am looking forward to exploring Charlottesville!​\n\nI grew up in Connecticut, but these days my family is mainly in Maryland. For undergrad, I went to Miami University in Oxford, OH (Love & Honor). After graduation, I worked as a clinical research coordinator in an Emergency Department, where I first became interested in Emergency Medicine. I went to Penn State College of Medicine, and ultimately decided to become an EM physician. My interests include research, education, and critical care. Outside of medicine, I love trying new restaurants, so I am excited to explore Charlottesville!\n\nHi! I was born in a small town just outside Lexington, KY and I have lived in Kentucky my entire life up until matching at UVA. I went to a really small school, Centre College, which only had about 1600 students but it was one of the best decisions of my life. I played soccer there, and you’ll still find me out (of shape) playing pick-up in C’ville. I went to the University of Louisville for medical school and was fortunate to study with some of my closest friends. Outside of medicine, I love to hike (especially out west), play sports, watch Liverpool, cook, and spend my downtime with friends, family, and my cat, his name is Kitter Catter.\n\nHello! I was born and raised in Guanajuato, Mexico, and moved to South Carolina during high school. After learning a whole new language and finishing my bachelor’s degree in biology, I began working as a research specialist in a lab at the Medical University of South Carolina, later attending medical school. My interests in emergency medicine orbit around trauma, ultrasound, and education! Outside of work, you can find me in the gym or jogging along city streets and parks. I enjoy spending my free time with family and friends and dedicate personal time to meditate, listen to podcasts/music, and the occasional hike/road trip. I am so excited to start EM residency at UVA and cannot wait to explore Charlottesville & Virginia.\n\nHi! I was born and raised in Miami, Florida before going to Baltimore for undergrad at Johns Hopkins and then NYC at Mt. Sinai for medical school. I am especially interested in climate policy, health care reform, and public advocacy. Charlottesville has been a dream so far, and I can’t wait to keep exploring all this quirky city has to offer. Outside of work, music is my biggest passion —I play guitar, attend concerts whenever I can, and most recently got into DJing/electronic music.\n\nHey y’all! I’m originally from Garland, TX, where I stayed until high school and then moved a city over to start undergrad at the University of Texas at Dallas. With a brief half-year hiatus from college to go on tour with a hard rock band, I returned to UTD after finding an interest in medicine and graduated in 2014. Two gap years later including a covert mission to Antarctica, I started medical school at the University of Vermont where I also completed a preliminary year in Internal Medicine. Now, I’m overjoyed to start my EM residency at UVA! My interests in EM include global health, ultrasound, and medical education. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, fishing, sports (boxing, basketball, football, bowling, golf), and watching the Cowboys, Mavs, Stars, and Rangers always build me up to let me down.​\n\nHello! I was born in California and lived there for the first four years of my life, after which I moved to beautiful Lebanon and have lived there ever since. I completed my undergrad studies in biology as well as medical school at the Lebanese American University. Moving away from my family and friends in Lebanon for the first time in my life is definitely overwhelming, but my new UVA family has been the warmest and most welcoming! I feel so grateful to be joining the UVA EM team, and my decision to move here was a no-brainer right after the first encounter! Outside of EM, I enjoy live music, both traveling and staycations, going to the gym, a Netflix binge, and spending time with my family, friends, and most definitely my 15 year old puppy (big time dog mom here)! I cannot wait to explore all that Charlottesville has to offer as I have only heard wonderful things about the area… and especially the wineries!\n\nBorn and raised in south Louisiana in a town that ends in our notorious “-eaux”. I bleed purple and gold through and through and attended Louisiana State University for undergrad and medical school. For the first time ever, I can call another state my home and I could not be happier. I couples matched with my fiancé, Mackenzie, who is training to become a pediatrician. Accompanying us are our two dogs Cooper and Ollie. My free time is spent either with my dogs, going to breweries, KanJam, watching sports, running, and looking at memes. Looking forward to exploring all of what Charlottesville has to offer!\n\nHey! After being born and raised in Fayetteville, NC, I went to East Carolina University for undergrad, where I double-majored in public health studies and chemistry. My passion for emergency medicine grew out of experiences that I had during high school and college. After beginning in emergency services as a volunteer firefighter in high school, I became a paramedic and worked throughout my undergraduate years at Lenoir County EMS and Bell Arthur EMS. After graduating from ECU, I decided to spend another four years in Greenville, NC to attend medical school at ECU, still working as a paramedic at Bell Arthur during that time. My EM interests include critical care, EMS, and ultrasound. Outside of the hospital, I enjoy cycling, hiking, camping, kayaking, and homebrewing. I am excited to explore all of the great restaurants, breweries and wineries, and outdoor activities in Charlottesville, and to become a part of the UVA team!\n\nHello! After growing up in Richmond, VA, attending Virginia Tech for undergrad, and taking a pit stop in Philadelphia for medical school, I’m absolutely thrilled to be joining UVA emergency medicine! Like so many others, I worked as an ED scribe before medical school and from that experience always knew I’d eventually end up in EM. My life outside of the hospital revolves around my wonderful fiancée and our dog Watson. We’ve already hiked a couple of trails in the Blue Ridge Mountains and are excited to explore so many more along with all of the restaurants, wineries, and breweries in the area."
