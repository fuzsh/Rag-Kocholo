        "text": "by Beatrice Yahia and Gwendolyn Whidden\n\nSignup to receive the Early Edition in your inbox here.\n\nA curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the past 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:\n\nTRUMP RALLY SHOOTING\n\nGrowing evidence that law enforcement was made aware of the Trump rally shooter before the gunfire began has put the Secret Service under pressure to explain the security failure. According to a Washington Post analysis of video footage, witnesses warned police of the shooter, Thomas Crooks, at least 86 seconds before he opened fire. The analysis backs up reports from other witnesses who have said they tried to alert police in the moments before Crooks shot at former President Trump. Jon Swaine, Abbie Cheeseman, Jonathan Baran, Isaac Stanley-Becker, and Shawn Boburg report.\n\nTRUMP LEGAL MATTERS\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon yesterday dismissed Trump’s federal classified documents case, citing in the 93-page motion the “unlawful appointment and funding of special counsel Jack Smith.” The decision, which was based on the legality of the Justice Department’s appointment of Smith, marks another major legal win for Trump ahead of November’s election. A spokesperson for Smith’s office yesterday confirmed that the Justice Department has approved plans to appeal. Erin Doherty reports for Axios; Justin Jouvenal reports for the Washington Post. Readers may also be interested in Adam Klasfeld’s analysis of Cannon’s decision for Just Security.\n\nDOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nTrump yesterday named Sen. J. D. Vance (R-OH) as his 2024 running mate and vice president. If Trump is elected, Vance, who turns 40 in August, would be one of the youngest vice presidents in U.S. history, and bring just two years of elected experience. Alex Leary and Vivian Salama report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n\nIsrael and Egypt have discussed a possible Israeli withdrawal from the Egypt-Gaza border as part of a ceasefire deal with Hamas, according to Israeli and Western officials. Israel’s willingness to do so could remove one of the main obstacles to a truce with Hamas, which has said Israel’s withdrawal from areas including the border is a precondition for a ceasefire. Patrick Kingsley reports for the New York Times.\n\nThe U.N. yesterday said that it will start increasing the use of armored vehicles and personal protection equipment for its humanitarian aid operations in Gaza after receiving approval from Israeli authorities. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.\n\nIsraeli police said officers shot and killed a 19-year-old Palestinian today after he stabbed a police officer in the West Bank. The Guardian reports.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE\n\nChina will host senior officials from Hamas and Fatah for a meeting next week in a bid to bridge gaps between the rival Palestinian factions that have long competed for authority in Gaza and the West Bank, according to officials in both parties. Adam Rasgon and Vivian Wang report for the New York Times.\n\nThe E.U. yesterday sanctioned five Israeli individuals and three entities, describing them as responsible for “serious and systematic human rights abuses” against Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nGerman authorities arrested a Lebanese man accused of being a member of Hezbollah and procuring drone components that were to be exported for use in attacks against Israel. AP News reports.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE\n\nIn an interview released yesterday, President Biden said he “did more for the Palestinian community” than anyone else when pressed about U.S. support for Israel. Lauren Sforza reports for The Hill.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised concern over civilian casualties resulting from Israel’s recent strikes on Gaza in a meeting with two senior Israeli officials, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. The Guardian reports.\n\nGLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nMembers of the European Parliament demanded that Hungary’s E.U. voting rights be stripped after Prime Minister Victor Orbán’s trips to Russia and China. In a letter addressed to top E.U. diplomats, 63 MEPS said Orbán has “caused significant damage by exploiting and abusing the role of the Council Presidency.” Separately, E.U. foreign affairs ministers are set to boycott Hungary by organizing their own foreign affairs summit in August instead of attending Orbán’s event in Budapest. Barbara Moens and Seb Starcevic report for POLITICO.\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame is gearing up for a fourth term in office after securing 99.15% of the vote in an election where only two contestants were allowed to run against him. Agence France-Presse reports via The Guardian.\n\nA French soldier in the anti-terrorism force was stabbed at a train station in central Paris yesterday, officials said. The soldier was hospitalized with injuries and is in a stable condition. The motive for the attack is under investigation, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. ABC News reports.\n\nArmenia yesterday launched joint military drills with the United States. Amid souring ties with Russia, the “Eagle Partner” war games are aimed at increasing the interoperability of units participating in international peacekeeping missions, Armenia’s defense minister said. Avet Demourian reports for AP News.\n\nAzerbaijan yesterday reopened its embassy in Iran after more than a year of negotiations between the countries to ease tensions. An embassy official said it had resumed operations, but a formal announcement by Iran’s foreign ministry is still pending. Amir Vahdat reports for AP News.\n\nPakistan’s government plans to file treason charges against imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan for wrongfully dissolving parliament in 2022, the country’s information minister said yesterday. The government also plans to ban Khan’s party for allegedly receiving foreign funding, a move widely seen as the latest effort by a weak governing coalition to quash Khan’s political party. Munir Ahmed reports for AP News; Christina Goldbaum and Salman Masood report for the New York Times.\n\nSouth Korea’s spy agency today said that a senior North Korea diplomat based in Cuba has fled to South Korea, the highest profile defection from the North to the South in several years. NBC News reports.\n\nAt least four soldiers were killed in Kashmir yesterday after a gunfight erupted with suspected militants. Meryl Sebastian reports for BBC News.\n\nGermany today banned the far-right Compact magazine, accusing it of stirring up antisemitism and hatred against people with immigrant roots. AP News reports.\n\nISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH TENISONS\n\nAn Israeli strike on a car near the Lebanon-Syria border yesterday killed a prominent Syrian businessman who was sanctioned by the United States and had close ties to Assad, according to pro-government media and other allied officials.
