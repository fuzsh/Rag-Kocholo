        "text": "by Beatrice Yahia and Gwendolyn Whidden\n\nSignup to receive the Early Edition in your inbox here.\n\nA curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:\n\nTRUMP RALLY SHOOTING\n\nFormer President Trump is injured but “fine” after surviving an assassination attempt on Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania. One attendee was killed, and two others wounded. The assailant, identified as twenty-year-old Thomas Crooks, was fatally shot by the Secret Service at the scene. The FBI says Crooks appears to have acted alone, but that they have not reached any final conclusions. Meanwhile, Trump arrived in Milwaukee yesterday for the Republican National Convention, which is expected to continue as scheduled. The Washington Post’s Emily Davies, Devlin Barrett, Jasmine Hilton and Perry Stein report; Juliegrace Brufke reports for Axios; BBC News reports.\n\nPresident Biden condemned the assassination attempt on Trump and called for the “temperature of politics” to be lowered. “No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence,” Biden said in an address to the nation, adding, “In America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box … Not with bullets.” BBC News reports.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n\nIsraeli strikes hit a camp for displaced people in a designated humanitarian area in Khan Younis on Saturday, killing at least 90 Palestinians and injuring 289 others, the Hamas-run health ministry said. The Israeli military said the strike had targeted top Hamas commanders Mohammed Deif and Rafa Salama, who Israeli officials described as “two of the masterminds” of the Oct. 7 attacks. The Israeli military declared Salama dead yesterday, but it remains uncertain if Deif was killed. Hamas called Israel’s claims to have targeted top commanders “false allegations” intended to “cover up the scale of the horrific massacre.” The Washington Post reports; Dov Lieber reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed in a strike Saturday that hit a makeshift mosque in a displacement camp in west Gaza City, according to a hospital official who treated the casualties. Abeer Salman, Lauren Kent, and Ibrahim Dahman report for CNN.\n\nHamas said yesterday that Gaza ceasefire talks are continuing and rejected the idea that mediated discussions had been suspended after Israel’s strike over the weekend. CBS News reports.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE\n\nDavid Lammy called for an immediate ceasefire during his first visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories as the U.K.’s new foreign secretary. Christy Cooney reports for BBC News.\n\nArgentina designated Hamas a terrorist organization on Friday and ordered a freeze on the financial assets of the group, a largely symbolic move as President Javier Milei seeks to align Argentina with the United States and Israel. ABC News reports.\n\nA Dutch court on Friday rejected a claim by human rights organizations that the Netherlands is dodging a court order to halt shipments of F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel. The Hague District Court ruled that the groups had failed to evidence that the Dutch government was ignoring the court’s February ruling, which told the Netherlands to stop sending the weapon parts to Israel, citing a clear risk of international law violations. Molly Quell reports for AP News.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE\n\nFormer commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion, an Israeli military unit the United States has accused of gross human rights violations, have been promoted to senior positions in the IDF and are now actively training ground troops as well as running operations in Gaza, a CNN investigation has found.\n\nIsraeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi will be in Washington this week for meetings at the White House, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Hanegbi will be joined by “senior officials” from both countries. The New York Times reports.\n\nGLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife were acquitted on Saturday in a case that accused them of unlawful marriage. Khan is unlikely to be immediately released from prison, where he has been held for almost a year, as authorities recently hinted he will face new charges. Salman Masood reports for the New York Times.\n\nIran’s President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian said his government will create “balance in relations with all countries” in line with national interests, but stressed to the United States that Tehran “will not respond to pressure.” Amir Vahdat reports for AP News.\n\nRwanda is heading to the polls for elections in which Paul Kagame is widely expected to be reelected. Kagame was elected president in 2000 and has won more than 90% of the vote in the three previous elections since then, in 2003, 2010, and 2017. Carlos Mureithi reports for The Guardian.\n\nVoting is underway in Syria today in a parliamentary election that could pave the way for a constitutional amendment to extend President Bashar Assad’s term. The vote is the fourth in Syria since the country’s civil war began in 2011. The number of eligible voters has not been announced, but it excludes rebel-held northwest Syria, the country’s northeast under the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, and the Syrian diaspora. Albert Aji and Abby Sewell report for AP News.\n\nChina and Russia’s naval forces yesterday began a joint exercise at a military port in southern China, the official news agency Xinhua reported. The Chinese defense ministry said that the operation did not concern international and regional situations or target a third party. AP News reports.\n\nFive people linked to one of Ecuador’s largest criminal gangs have been jailed for the murder of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio last year. A vocal anti-corruption activist and journalist, Villavicencio was shot dead as he left a campaign rally in Quito. Matt Murphy reports for BBC News.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has stepped down to become the E.U.’s next foreign policy chief later this year. Kallas handed in her formal resignation to President Alar Karis today. ABC News reports.\n\nNepal’s newly appointed prime minister took the oath of office today at a ceremony in Kathmandu. Khadga Prasad Oli, the leader of Nepal’s largest communist party, was named prime minister yesterday following the collapse of a previous coalition government. Binaj Gurubacharya reports for AP News.\n\nFrance’s left-wing parties still plan to form a joint government after emerging as the strongest bloc in parliament in the country’s snap election, but any pact is unlikely to come this week, the head of the Socialist Party (PS) said today. Reuters reports.\n\nA West African court has found the Nigerian government guilty of human rights abuses during its suppression of the 2020 #EndSARS protests against reported police brutality. The Abuja-based ECOWAS Court of Justice imposed a financial penalty on the country after finding “credible evidence of disproportionate use of force and violations of the right to liberty and security, assembly, free speech, and dignity.” Stephanie Busari and Abel Alvarado report for CNN.\n\nFour police officers were killed and at least three injured in clashes between Iraqi government forces and militants from the self-styled Islamic State group in eastern Iraq on Saturday, police and medical sources said. Reuters reports.\n\nISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH TENSIONS"
