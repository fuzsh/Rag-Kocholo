        "text": "DELRAY BEACH — Twins Bob and Mike Bryan have cemented their legacy as the best doubles team in ATP Tour history.\n\nBut if you ask them, they’re nothing more than regular guys playing the sport they love.\n\n“We’re just trying to win the next match — we’re not thinking about accolades,” Bob said. “It feels good to be respected by your peers, by the fans, but who knows what our place in history will be when we retire.\n\n“I’m not going to call Mike a legend. He’s not going to call me a legend. We’re going to keep kicking each other in the butt and keep each other humble.”\n\nWhether the Bryan brothers want to acknowledge their greatness or remain humble, one thing is clear: They have been the gold standard in men's doubles tennis for more than two decades.\n\nPlaying the Delray Beach Open — which Bob called his “home tournament” — has been a regular stop for the 40-year-old brothers, who won doubles championships here in 2009, 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nOn Thursday night, the Bryans secured another semifinal berth, defeating the French team of Adrian Mannarino and Hugo Nys 6-3, 7-5 in the quarterfinals.\n\nMike, the world’s No. 1-ranked doubles player, and Bob, ranked 17th after missing nearly eight months with a hip injury, face Marcelo Arevalo and American Jamie Cerretani in the semifinals at 12:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nEven though Bob’s health continues to improve — he had a metal implant inserted into his hip in August — the brothers are not taking another potential Delray Beach championship for granted.\n\n“There are no more easy matches for us,” Bob said. “There were times when we could breeze through the early rounds, but every match now presents a new challenge.\n\n“We’re going to watch game tape and come up with a great strategy — or we’re going to leave as losers. We’re just trying to play good matches. If it stacks up to holding the trophy, we’ll be extremely happy.”\n\nSouthern California natives who also played together at Stanford, the brothers now call Florida home. Bob lives in Sunny Isles Beach, Mike resides in Tampa.\n\n“We love playing in South Florida,” said Mike, who teamed with American Jack Sock to win doubles titles at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the ATP Finals while Bob recovered.\n\n“There are really passionate tennis fans here, especially doubles fans, so every time we step on the court, they’re rooting for us. We can feel the energy. We play our best when they’re behind us.”\n\nMike has been pleased with Bob’s speedy recovery from hip surgery. The brothers have won 116 career doubles titles, including 16 Grand Slams and nine ATP Masters 1000 events. They won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\n“He’s improved considerably since early January, where we didn’t think he’d be ready for the Australian Open,” said Mike, who with Bob reached the Aussie quarterfinals. “He’s moving better, he’s pain free. We’re starting to flow better on the court.”\n\nAlthough Bob said he’s not quite 100 percent, he continuing gaining confidence with each match.\n\n“Doctors said I’d be feeling pretty normal around nine months, and I’m around six months now,” he said. “I’m very happy with the progress.”\n\nIn Thursday’s singles action, Radu Albot defeated Aussie Nick Kyrgios, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, advancing to Friday’s quarterfinals where he’ll face American Steve Johnson, the No. 4 seed.\n\nTop-seed Juan Martin del Potro played American Reilly Opelka, a Palm Beach County resident, in Thursday’s late match."
