        "text": "June 24, 2023\n\nI’m a sucker for books about books and this one is wonderful. I saw the end coming a mile away (and some children will also) but that didn’t diminish the delight I felt in reading & viewing it.\n\nThe story is great and book lovers of all ages will understand it.\n\nThe illustrations are beautiful and colorful. I laughed when I saw the image of the girl’s dress with text on it and then loved how her clothing (or lack of clothing) changed as the story setting changed. Clever and creative! I loved the facial expressions of Alice and of her parents, especially on the last page.\n\nI appreciated how this story is an affirmation about the power of books & reading and also shows the support and acceptance present in a loving family.\n\nI have enjoyed other books by this illustrator and this author. They team up well for this book.\n\n4-1/2 stars\n\nFebruary 15, 2023\n\nFun and sweet. I love that her name is Alice and that there's a white rabbit. I also love the green screen effect with her dress.\n\nLibrary copy\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\nThe only thing that could make this book cooler is if Tomie de Paola was involved. But since, sadly he is no longer with us, this cannot not humanly be any better. This is a sweet book about imagination and some far out fantastic illustrations. The colors pop off the page, and maybe a little ironic after saying that my favorite image is the moon and all black. I love how the young girls outfit fades into background, making her immersed into the story. I would love to know, however, what the book her \"word dress\" is from. Or where the text is from.\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nIt happens to all of us regardless of the length. When the last word is read and the cover is closed, we look up. For a few moments, we are confused as to where and when we are. We are still lost in a story, a story other than our real lives. Not only are we still part of the world within those pages, but we come away with having found something. It may be something we have misplaced or misunderstood or something fresh and new.\n\nThis is the gift of a book, given to us again and again whenever the cover is opened. Authored by Grace Lin and Kate Messner with illustrations by Grace Lin, Once Upon a Book (Little, Brown And Company, February 07, 2023) is a layered narrative with hidden references to other titles and different cultures. It is a story of longing and belonging.\n\nMy full recommendation https://librariansquest.blogspot.com/...\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\nVibrant illustrations and a strong sense of imagination and fantasy celebrate the joys of reading.\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\nOnce Upon a Book is a super cute picture book about the magic of reading. Books can transport you from one place to another whenever you feel unhappy with where you are (like on a rainy day you can't go out). The art is cute, the story is cute, and it's a fun read. Recommended!\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nA young girl reads and enjoys the magical experiences in her book as she unlocks the wonders in its pages, becoming part of the book itself. Isn't that what happens to us all as we read any book? We become the book, the book becomes us.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nMarch 8, 2023\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I’d get so immersed in the book I was reading that I’d tune everything else out. I wouldn’t hear people talking to me, I’d miss any commotion happening around me and I’d often blink and look around in confusion when I finally emerged from the page into the read world.\n\nI loved getting lost in the world of books. I still do.\n\nI think that’s why I adore Grace Lin and Kate Messner’s new picture book: Once Upon a Book.\n\nThis beautifully illustrated book literally immerses you in a story of childlike wonder and reading refuge. In it, we meet Alice. Alice is a young girl who is fed up with the cold, dreary days of winter and escapes into the pages of her book to faraway lands that look and feel very different from her own.\n\nPage by page, she travels to a tropical jungle with the birds, the blazing hot desert with the camels, a refreshing coral reef with the fish, the wide-open freedom of the sky with the clouds and the quiet calm of the moonlight. While all of these places each had something wonderful to offer, what Alice ultimately wished for was a place full of coziness and warmth… her own home.\n\nWhile readers will become entranced in Alice's story, they’ll literally experience it for themselves as a result of the artfully designed illustrations. Each two-page spread ensconces the entire page and alternates between living in a scene directly from Alice’s book to exploring the next page to come, propelling the reader through the story.\n\nBut the best part of the book, in my opinion, is the clever way Alice literally disappears into the pages. The story began with Alice wearing an adorable dress made out of fabric that resembled the pages of a book. As she jumps into the story, her dress literally blends in with the scenery as she gets lost inside the pages, just how I imagined myself doing the same as a child.\n\nReading Once Upon a Book will remind you of the power of reading and the utter joy readers feel when they lose themselves in the pages. This is a book to be read, to be savored and to spark a joyful reading habit.\n\nFebruary 15, 2023\n\nVery sweet, and I esp love the flying illustrations ☁️\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nLove the concept of books taking you anywhere and the illustrations are very fun.\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\nOnce Upon a Book captures the vivid sensory experience of childhood reading, as a little girl tired of staying indoors in the winter indulges in some literary tourism. A delightful ending, and I love what Lin did with Alice's dress and her toy rabbit.\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nFun and fanciful little story about how reading will take us to different places. I love the artwork, because it fits so nicely. And a fun thing, in every part of the story, wherever the little girl goes, you can find a little white rabbit. This is a lovely new book.\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nI really enjoyed this book, especially the illustrations. I think Grace Lin’s choices for Alice’s dress made for a cool visual effect, and sharp-eyed young readers will enjoy the Easter eggs in the text.\n\nI think I’ll read this with my older students and see what they think before I read it to my younger kids, but this may be a contender for my Mock Caldecott.\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nI absolutely love books about books and the magic of entering literary worlds. This happens with BEAUTIFUL illustrations and to be honest, I smell possible Caldecott something with this one\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nSpoiler-free summary:\n\n\"\"Once Upon a Book\" by Grace Lin is a delightful picture book that celebrates the joy of reading and storytelling. Through charming illustrations and engaging text, the book follows a young girl as she discovers the magic of books and the worlds they contain. From fairy tales to adventures, each story she reads transports her to new and exciting places, sparking her imagination and creativity. As the girl explores the pages of her favorite books, she learns valuable lessons and finds inspiration in the characters she meets. \"Once Upon a Book\" is a love letter to the power of literature and the endless possibilities that come with every turn of the page\" (ChatGPT, June 10, 2024).\n\nCommentary:\n\nThis book could go along with the book, \"The Year I Learned to Fly\". They both use imagination and creativity as a large plot in their story. This teaches children that their imagination is endless and there is nothing that they cannot do. The magic and fairytale aspects are a great way for it to play a role in the classroom. Children remember fairytales and the stories that go along with it so this book would hopefully be one they wouldn't forget.\n\nApplication:\n\nIn my classroom, I would probably use this at the same time that I use \"The Year I Learned to Fly\" because they both align very well on the topic of interpersonal relationships and imagination/creativity. We could have two groups of students where they each are read the story and asked to do an activity that coordinates with the story they are read. They we can switch groups so that all of the students can hear both stories, then we can come together as a class and compare and contrast the stories and relate them to real-life circumstances.\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nBeautiful illustrations with only a few words. This book seems to be a nod to Alice in Wonderland. Oddly, I've never read that. When I look at this book, I wonder what I've missed. For example, I love the little girl's dress, which is from the pages of AinW. What else would I find if I knew more?\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nRead this gorgeous book to 2nd graders for their first library visit of the year. Let’s get excited about books and all the places they can bring us! The kiddos were especially interested in Alice’s ever-changing dress and the different environments.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\nThis sweet picture book reminds me a lot of my childhood, always picturing myself in the books I was reading.\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nJuly 28, 2023 reread:\n\nI read this for a school-age storytime, and I enjoyed reading this with the kids so much that I read it again the next day for a preschool storytime. This is such a great book with a handful of literary allusions to Alice in Wonderland. I love the way the endpapers are a part of the story, and I was able to keep even the youngest kids engaged by telling them that there was a rabbit on every page for them to find. It's just a wonderful story with incredible illustrations. On the last page of the family, I love how there are elements of all the different places she visited. Great!!\n\nFebruary 6, 2023 Original review:\n\nA simple, lovely book about a bored girl who traverses the planet through the transportive magic of reading.\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nPerfect picture book about the joys of reading. The illustrations have gorgeous color that make everything “pop” off the page. I love that the main character is named Alice and that there’s a white rabbit that leads her into each adventure. Also like that her dress acts as a “green screen” in each world. I would like to know what book the words on her dress are from.\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\nA delightful book! Simple but imaginative story, and it pays homage to a classic. The illustrations were beautiful and amazing, rich with colors, and the girl blended in wonderfully. There is another character showed up at each page, echoing the homage, and make reading this book a fun activity for young kids. This is designed for kids 4-8 years old.\n\nMarch 28, 2023\n\nGrace Lin's beautiful art lights up this new book by her and Kate Messner. On a gray day, curious Alice climbs inside her favorite book and goes on adventures with colorful birds, camels, fish, and the stars. This will make a perfect read aloud for wiggly preschoolers and early elementary-aged kids. For added fun ask the kids to spot the white rabbit on every spread.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nI love the illustrations as I do love all Grace Lin’s work. More times with rerads the more I love this. I'm going to pair it with David Wiesner's Three Little Pigs with the 4th/5th graders tomorrow and see what they think. Been listening to ALA Notable committee discussions and it helped me see even more to love in this.\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nIn this book we get to see a little girl go through a journey of being dissatisfied with the different places she’s in based around a book. This book speaks to Alice and takes her from the real world, bringing her to a place where she wants to go. We get to see Alice ride on camels, swim with fish and dance with the clouds. A major theme that I notice from this book is that it is OK to want more but don’t wish for more when what you have is enough. I understand Alice is a child and wants to have fun while going on an adventure but at the end of the book she realized she missed home! Another theme is simpler as it supports children’s creative side which is to ‘dream big’. Create those stories in your head that allow time to pass by and let you live out any dream you want! The main genre is adventure. Children reading this book could learn that the sky is the limit and to dream big. They could also learn the value of nothing is ever perfect, there will always be something that they don’t find appealing anymore. Another concept might be that its ok to change your mind. We see Alice unhappy and begin to create wild worlds in her head, but we also see how easy it was to be aware of the things she disliked and want something else. Sometimes kids aren’t given the opportunity to change nor speak their mind when it comes to certain things in life. This was a WOW book for me because I’ve never read a children’s literature book that switched scenes that fast. When I was younger, I also never dived into ‘adventure’ books. I enjoyed seeing the different places Alice went and how the author made the book so easy but entertaining to read with the illustrations and wording.\n\nSome of the literary devices the author used in writing this book were alliteration, personification, imagery, metaphor, and repetition. These techniques enhanced the quality of the writing by creating vivid and engaging descriptions that transported readers like me to a fantastical world with Alice. For example, phrases like \"a place of sparkling sand, where the sun would dry her\" utilize imagery and metaphor to create sensory experiences and enhance the audience’s engagement in the story. I would consider this book to be an anti-bias book because it doesn’t highlight specific stereotypes, ethnicities, or cultures. Instead, the book focuses on the theme of imagination, adventure, and contentment that resonate with children of all backgrounds.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nThis is quite possibly the best children's book of the year. Definitely one of the most beautifully and imaginatively illustrated. It is the perfect illustrated nod to Alice in Wonderland. Alice is stuck inside and it's raining. She tired of being cold. She puts on a special dress (I'm guessing it's an \"imagination\" frock or something-- as she takes it out of the bureau, I can read some of the words, which are taken from Lewis Carroll's first page of Alice in Wonderland-- the words \"tired\" and \"book\" are right there), and a book \"flaps\" at her. There's a white rabbit on the page of the book, and the book words echo the narration words of the book. (Also, her \"book\" frock has more Lewis Carroll excerpts on it; they differ on every page that the words appear). Alice is reading a book about herself, Alice, going to a variety of different wonderful dreamy locations, invited by the locals themselves. All readers, young and old, should delight in the realistic quality of the illustrations when Alice is skulking around her house, and when her hands, so realistically conveyed, are holding a book which depicts her entrance into a variety of fantastic destinations. Very Van Allsburg, very Wiesner-esque. She enters a colorful jungle (it's too rainy); a sparkling desert (icky sand storms); a coral ocean (she gets caught in seaweed); a scenic sky (she gets caught in a thunderstorm); and finally, outer space. But space is lonely, and she eventually wishes to come home. She follows the sound of her mother's voice and returns home. The illustrations are beyond exquisite, and they tell their own story. When Alice is in her new locations, her \"book\" frock becomes a green screen, subtly taking the color of the background of her surroundings. When she transitions between home and her imaginative journeys, her \"book\" frock has words which are excerpts from Alice in Wonderland. Please take the time to find the White Rabbit who is accompanying Alice. It might take some effort, he is almost as elusive as Waldo. Young and old readers should savor this perfect book.\n\nFebruary 13, 2023\n\nFirst sentence: Alice was tired of heavy sweaters and thick socks and staying inside with nothing to do. \"I wish I were someplace that wasn't so frozen and gray!\" she grumbled to her mother. She began to stomp away, but something flapped nearby. It was the pages of a book. Curious, Alice began to read.\n\nPremise/plot: Alice, our protagonist, spends the afternoon [or morning, or day] IN a book--literally and figuratively. The illustrations show her stepping right into a book and truly LIVING and EXPERIENCING the action/story of the book[s]. She goes from story to story meeting all sorts of characters--mainly animals, if not exclusively animals. Her landscape is ever-changing.\n\nMy thoughts: I wanted to love this one. I did. I love, love, love books about books. I didn't quite love this one despite me wanting to absolutely do so. I think that is mainly all on me. It is not at all fair to judge a book based on your expectations, what you want the book to be. But the book I desperately wanted this one to be would have Alice stepping into familiar books and stories--meeting characters, being thrown into stories. Instead, it was almost let's travel the globe and learn about different habitats and animals. Yet it wasn't even quite that. [Not nonfiction-y enough to be an informative book]. The illustrations were bright, bold, colorful.\n\nAn artistic choice that I personally didn't love was Alice's ever-changing dress. She starts off with a dress imprinted with words. But her dress blends into EVERY landscape. It changes with each story. At first glance--at least my first glance--it looks like arms, legs, head and shoulders--just floating disconnected. Again, that could be 100% just me. Yes, upon a double-take I saw she was still wearing a block-y dress. But it was distracting/disconcerting to me. Again a nitpicky thing. I probably am the only reader who will feel this way.\n\nMarch 28, 2023\n\nA lovely book about books. Alice is beckoned to climb into a book and travel to different worlds. Each place she travels is not quite right whether it's too dry, too crowded, or too loud. At the end Alice travels to a place of \"coziness and warmth, where the kitchen smelled of dumplings and her family was waiting with dinner.\" Beautiful story with vibrant illustrations. I especially love the pages with Alice in the ocean. The orange clownfish and bright pink coral against the turquoise sea are stunning. The crowded chaos of her being surrounded by too many fish and the tangly seaweed wrapping around her convey the cramped-ness and confusion without being of putting or overwhelming.\n\nI love the way Alice's dress changes with the setting. Lin states \"So if you notice, before Alice goes into the book, she actually changes from her sweater into this summery dress. And this summery dress is made up of words. But then when she finally goes into the book, the words disappear. And that's because she has actually become part of the book. It's kind of a visual metaphor of getting lost in a book or becoming a part of a book when you read it. So that's why, when she's actually inside the book, her dress becomes a part of the environment around her.\"\n\nI related to this statement so much as a child. I would get lost in books and would not want to put them down until it was over.\n\nI also love how this story reminds me of Alice in Wonderland. The girl is named Alice and her dress has words from the story on it. The pages shown on her dress are purposely chosen. Her dress on the cover is made from a page saying, \"Tell us a story!\" for example. There is also a white rabbit following Alice throughout the book which is a nod to both Alice in Wonderland and Asian myths of the rabbit on the moon. This rabbit is fun to hunt for throughout the illustrations and at the end when Alice returns home, the rabbit stays on the moon. Ready to re-read this book again and again and to look for more hidden features within the illustrations."
