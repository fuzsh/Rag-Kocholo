We have a pretty good sense of who to read to capture the breadth of literary fiction in the West (see the list here). But who can list what are the essential fantasy texts to read?\n\nWell, Locus Magazine can. NPR too. And the 2015 World Fantasy Conference. And me, if you don’t mind the impertinence.\n\nI was inspired to do this blog by two things: my bulletin board, and my friend Matthew Rettino’s blog, “World Fantasy Convention 2015, Part III: Challenging the Canon.” Matthew tells us a bit about the 2015 World Fantasy Convention (which I would have sold all my neighbour’s cats to attend), and does some thinking about what we mean by a canon. In a superstar panel, the guests were challenged to add to the canon of fantastic literature. This is the list that came out of the session:\n\nWorld Fantasy Conference 2015 New Canon\n\nGene Wolfe, The Book of the New Sun\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, A Wizard of Earthsea\n\nHope Mirrlees, Lud-in-the-Mist\n\nPeter S. Beagle, The Last Unicorn\n\nMary Stuart, The Crystal Cave\n\nC.S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia\n\nLord Dunsany, Gods of Pegana\n\nMadeleine L’Engle, A Wrinkle in Time\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings\n\nMervyn Peake, Gormenghast\n\nH.P. Lovecraft, Cthulhu Mythos\n\nJoan Aitken, Wolves of Willoughby Chase\n\nLaurell K. Hamilton, Guilty Pleasures\n\nMaurice Sendak, Where the Wild Things Are\n\nChina Miéville, Perdido Street\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay, Under Heaven\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay, Tigana\n\nCharles de Lint, Someplace to be Flying\n\nThis is an excellent list–I have added it to my bulletin board–but still a bit eclectic. Even expanding the work of Wolfe, L’Engle, Le Guin, and Peake to the series, and we don’t have the breadth of the most important work.\n\nFor a couple of years I have been using the Locus Magazine list. Not the updated list that I’ll talk about in a moment, but the one from 1987. 1987 is a good time to freeze the 20th century in place. The 1987 list is not yet swept up by works influenced by the Dying Earth subgenre that dominated the late 70s and 80s, yet Jack Vance and Gene Wolfe are there. Vampyre fiction is not yet the bomb, and urban fantasy had not yet blended fairy forests with concrete jungles. The British trinity of Gaiman, Pratchett, and Adams have not had their say yet. J.K. Rowling and George R.R. Martin have not begun to revolutionize the entire world of fantasy writing. And the satiric films of the late 20th century have not yet turned all genres upside down.\n\nWilliam Morris’ The Well at the World’s End is missing (what Lin Carter calls the first fantasy book), and I’m not sure we would choose those two Stephen King books from the period. I would extend the work of Le Guin, White, Zelazny, and Wolfe into the series in which the books stand, and I would add Guy Gavriel Kay’s Fionavar Tapestry. We are also missing people who were influential to fantasy fiction, like H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Margaret Atwood, and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (see the SF list below). But note how representative of imaginative fantasy this 1987 LocusMag list is:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien (1955)\n\nThe Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien (1937)\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea, Ursula K. Le Guin (1968)\n\nThe Shadow of the Torturer, Gene Wolfe (1980)\n\nThe Last Unicorn, Peter S. Beagle (1968)\n\nThe Once and Future King, H. White (1958)\n\nNine Princes in Amber, Roger Zelazny (1970)\n\nThe Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Stephen R. Donaldson (1977)\n\nDragonflight, Anne McCaffrey (1968)\n\nLittle, Big, John Crowley (1981)\n\nAlice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll (1865)\n\nThe Gormenghast Trilogy, Mervyn Peake (1950)\n\nThe Riddlemaster of Hed, Patricia A. McKillip (1976)\n\nThe Incompleat Enchanter, Fletcher Pratt & L. Sprague de Camp (1941)\n\nWatership Down, Richard Adams (1972)\n\nThe Dying Earth, Jack Vance (1950)\n\nGlory Road, Robert A. Heinlein (1963)\n\nA Spell for Chameleon, Piers Anthony (1977)\n\nDracula, Bram Stoker (1897)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum (1900)\n\nSilverlock, John Myers Myers (1949)\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes, Ray Bradbury (1962)\n\nThe White Dragon, Anne McCaffrey (1978)\n\nThe Stand, Stephen King (1978)\n\nLord Valentine’s Castle, Robert Silverberg (1980)\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia, C. S. Lewis (1950)\n\nThe Shining, Stephen King (1977)\n\nConjure Wife, Fritz Leiber (1953)\n\nDeryni Rising, Katherine Kurtz (1970)\n\nThe Worm Ouroboros, E. R. Eddison (1922)\n\nWitch World, Andre Norton (1963)\n\nSalem’s Lot, Stephen King (1975)\n\nA Wrinkle in Time, Madeleine L’Engle (1962)\n\nI am working my way steadily through this top 33 list. I have added to it a number of lists:\n\nMy Own C.S. Lewis’ Chronological Reading List (not ready to share the detailed list yet)\n\nTerry Pratchett’s Discworld Novels\n\n“25 Books Every Christian Should Know” by Michael G.\n\nThe Top 100 Sci-Fi Books\n\nHarold Bloom’s Canonical List\n\nThese lists don’t mean I am skipping everything new. Locus Magazine has kept updating their lists based on reader response. They use a voting system to tabulate the results in four categories:\n\n20th Century SF Novels\n\n20th Century Fantasy Novels\n\n21st Century SF Novels\n\n21st Century Fantasy Novels\n\nThis is a fantastic resource (if you can excuse the pun). We can see in the top 50 of the 20th c. fantasy (below) how very influential certain figures are: Rowling, Tolkien, Lewis, Martin, Le Guin, Zelazny, Bradbury, King, Pratchett and Gaiman. I suspect we will see Mists of Avalon tumble down the lists, and Terry Pratchett’s work make its way up. The Martin-Tolkien-Rowling-King domination is key, and shows the strength of their fictional worlds as well as the power of film to draw readers into the book world. Le Guin, L’Engle, Lewis, Gaiman, Pratchett, Guy Kay, and the Arthurian writers have never really had very good adaptations.\n\nI have attached the Top 50 in both the 20th c. SF and Fantasy categories. With notable exceptions, it is interesting that common names from the late 20th century dominate the top of the early 21st c. Fantasy list, but the top of the SF list has a lot of new names. I think this should be a comment on the publisher-locked world of contemporary fantasy–a world shattered in SF by the incredible success of The Martian. As far as SciFi goes, I do not know yet if it means that the last great SF age has passed, or if we are seeing new energy for the genre.
