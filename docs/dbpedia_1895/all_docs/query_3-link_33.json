        "text": "Quentin Tarantino’s most recent film, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, seemed to split audiences along generational lines. Despite its charms and Tarantino’s customary flair, I came out of it frustrated and a bit bored, wondering if it was finally time to divorce this film-maker who’d shaped the sense of cinematic possibility of anyone who grew up in the 1990s. Tarantino’s essential shallowness, which in the past he has alchemised as aesthetic vitality, and his adolescent moral outlook had come to seem dismayingly inflexible: I didn’t feel he could surprise me any more. But everyone a couple of decades older than me, who remembered the late 1960s televisual and cinematic golden-age Hollywood so lovingly elegised, seemed to adore the film.\n\nNow Tarantino has surprised us all by turning his hand to writing books, beginning with this novelisation. It’s far better than I expected it to be. Anyone who admired the movie will have a great time with this spin-off work. Interestingly, it is not a straightforward translation of the events in the film. The two versions of Rick and Cliff’s story do share a number of scenes, but even those are altered and lengthened and there numerous new scenes and characters, some of them real-life figures (Steve McQueen has a cameo).\n\nI haven’t read a film-to-book novelisation since I was a teenager; among disreputable genres it’s down there with the reality TV star autobiography. Yet Tarantino has such fun expanding his fictional world, and the results are sufficiently intriguing, as to suggest that more auteurs might consider becoming authors. As a pop culture polymath, he exploits the novel format to lay on thick his lavishly detailed, period Hollywood shop talk and industry gossip. With its garrulously omniscient third-person narration, the book serves as an essay on cinema and televisual history. Sometimes, the fictive mask comes off and it’s unmistakably Tarantino talking right at us: “When it came to how to do a modern-day Hitchcockian thriller for a with-it audience, that pulsed to a swinging London beat, with Repulsion Roman [Polanski] cracked the code.” His zeal and insider’s savvy indicate that Tarantino can write decent pop-cultural nonfiction too; in fact, he has a memoir on the way (he has signed a two-book deal with HarperCollins).\n\nThere is probably little point reading this book if you haven’t seen the film, in which actor Rick Dalton (the Leonardo DiCaprio character) and his stunt double, chauffeur and buddy Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), come to terms with their advancing years and a changing cinematic culture in which tough guy leading men are being replaced by a new generation of androgynous long-hairs. Meanwhile, Polanski and Sharon Tate are enjoying their status as Hollywood’s royal couple, as Charles Manson and his “family” of lost girls plan to trigger social upheaval by way of murderous carnage. Disorientingly, the film’s climactic scene of fantasy violence – Rick torching the killer hippies with a flamethrower – is dispatched in a flash-forward sequence 100 pages in.\n\nThroughout, the process of novelisation anchors the meandering story. There is little actual structure here, but the backlighting provided by the film means it doesn’t really matter: the characters and settings benefit from a charisma emanating across media.\n\nTarantino is no Henry James. He over-explains, repeats himself and dishes out stock phrases to get the descriptive job done: films “strike a chord with audiences”; industry moguls are “head honchos”; victims issue “bloodcurdling screams”. So it goes – Tarantino is inventive and playful in other ways: for instance, with metafictional gestures such as giving himself a directorial credit in the résumé of a child star on the cowboy show Lancer (we also get a long account of the show’s plot line, which I felt I could skim to no great loss).\n\nAs in his films, Tarantino’s insatiable enthusiasm for pop culture trivia is infectious and thrilling. I will be reading the memoir."
