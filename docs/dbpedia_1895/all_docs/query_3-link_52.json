        "text": "November 18, 2018\n\nI picked up Once Upon a Time Travel By Sariah Wilson as I fancied something light and fluffy and this certainly hit the spot.\n\nThis is my first experience with a Sariah Wilson book and this definitely got a thumbs up from me.\n\nIt was just what I needed, An easy read that put a big smile on my face.\n\nSo first I just want to say I absolutely love time travel romances and couldn't wait to get stuck into this one.\n\n\"So Once Upon A Time Travel,\" Tells the story of Emma Damon who while working at Hartley Hall manages to get herself transported through time to 1816 (200 years in the past to be precise).\n\nHere Emma gets mistaken for someone else entirely, an American lass by the name of Miss Emily Blythe.\n\nSeeing no other course of action Emma decides to pretend to be Miss Blythe Until she can work out how to return home.\n\nThe only dilemma is Miss Blythe is about to be engaged to the earl of Hartley's brother and Emma now must learn how to engage with polite society in this time period and help keep her true identity under wraps.\n\nTo further confound things, Emma takes a massive shine to The Earl Of Hartley.\n\nThe Earl himself has vowed never to marry, so pushes his feeling for Emma aside while in turn nudging her in his brother's direction.\n\nSo this story was lovely, it kept my interest, flowed brilliantly and also made me chuckle on numerous occasions.\n\nThe two main characters Emma and Hartley were extremely likeable, though I did find Hartley a bit thick-headed at times particularly in regard to his ex-love Libby, who everyone but he could see what a huge golddigger the girl was.\n\nI loved all the secondary characters, especially aunt Charles that woman cracked me up.\n\nThis was also a mainly clean read, Bar a couple of heated kisses this was PG rated all the way.\n\nSo Once upon a time travel really does do what it says on the tin, its a feel good delightful fun read that I really loved.\n\nSo now for my negatives and I really hate to do this as I really did enjoy this story very much,\n\nSo here goes,\n\nfirst, I didn't like the introduction of magic into the story, I think it was just put out there to help explain the time travelling nature of this tale, I don't think it added much overall and I would have preferred it not to have entered the equation at all as this was such a lovely tale and it was managing just fine without its inclusion.\n\nThat brings me to my second gripe the time travelling itself.\n\nI kept waiting for someone to explain how the dress with the note got into the closet, and waiting and waiting some more, I finally assumed Emma had put it there at some point but this was never actually clarified for me.\n\nThen there were a lot of things that came out of Emma's mouth that I felt people in the 1800's would have been much more shocked by, she didn't have a filter, I myself found her extremely amusing but I felt The aristocracy of the nineteenth century would have been outraged.\n\nMy final issue was When the real Miss Emily Blythe reared her little head.\n\nIt was brushed away so easily and I found the events just a little convenient and a trifle unbelievable in their content.\n\nSo, Now that nasty business is over with, let me just say that this was such an entertaining read.\n\nI found Once Upon a time travel very amusing and I would so recommend this to others no issue.\n\nSo lastly just want to say thank you to NetGalley and the author for providing me with an ARC\n\nThis is my own unbiased and honest opinion.\n\nReviewed By Beckie Bookworm\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/beckiebookworm/\n\nwww.beckiebookworm.com\n\nSeptember 16, 2020\n\nSuper fun!\n\nI had been recommending this book to a few friends, and decided to give it a re-read! Just as fun the second time around.\n\nFrom the synopsis you already know that Emma gets transported back 200 years to 1816. It's always fun to think about time-travel, wondering what it would be like to go back in time, or jump 200 years in the future! I can't even imagine what the world will be like in 2220! I think going back in time would be a little easier since we have so many books about the time period and would sort of know what to expect. I thought Ms. Wilson did a great job showing the differences between the time periods and how hard it would be to acclimate to such different customs, etc.\n\nI loved the characters, Emma, Hartley and Aunt Charles as well as the other supporting cast. Emma is a likable heroine who is struggling to adapt to 1816 norms and give up all our modern conveniences. Hartley was a great broody regency hero. There's lots of tension and chemistry between the two and of course some swoony kisses! One thing I liked that sets this apart from other regencies, is I just didn't know how it would end. The time-travel element leaves things up in the air as you read so you're never really sure if Emma will stay or go or what will happen. I liked being kept on my toes, but knew Ms. Wilson would find a way for them (and me) to get a HEA.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this one and would definitely recommend to any contemporary/regency fan! I hope Ms. Wilson writes more in this genre, and I think we need books for some of the side characters from this story!\n\nContent\n\nRomance: Clean - a few steamy kisses, but stays clean\n\nLanguage: None\n\nViolence: Very mild\n\nSimilar Books You May Enjoy...\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nI received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\nThis review contains some spoilers for the book.\n\nIn Once Upon a Time Travel, Emma, a recent college graduate (in 2017) spending the summer working at a museum (formerly the home of the Portwood family) in England, accidentally finds herself time traveling to 1816, where she is mistaken to be a Miss Emily Blythe, whom the lord of the house (Hartley) is intending to have marry his brother, James. However Emma and Hartley quickly develop feelings for each other, even though Hartley is determined to marry her off to his brother, and Emma is determined to get home to 2017.\n\nWhile this book was enjoyable enough to keep reading, there were a few things that really stuck out to me that lessened my enjoyment of the book.\n\nFirst, Emma mentions multiple times that she studied American history in college, and yet she seems to have no idea whatsoever what life in 1816 is like. I understand that English history is not the same, and while my own knowledge of history is lacking, I cannot imagine that America and England in 1816 were that incredibly different for her to understand NOTHING of the time to which she travelled.\n\nAdditionally, I understand that when she woke up and initially thought she was dreaming, that it made sense for her to continue speaking as if it were the 21st century. And even once she realized it wasn't a dream, it would be totally understandable if she slipped up occasionally. However, she didn't seem to make any effort whatsoever to actually acclimate her speech and mannerisms to the 19th century. She continually made references to things that didn't exist, and then was put off when people didn't understand what she was referring to.\n\nAlso, there seemed to be things thrown in for the sake of convenience, such as the whole existence of magic, which seemed pretty inconsequential to the story, except to give a reason why the time travel even happened, but the fact that witches exist was basically glossed over. Additionally, she didn't have to convince the Duchess that she was worthy of her attention because conveniently, the Duchess's daughter started to choke and she gave her the Heimlich maneuver and suddenly the Duchess wanted to be her BFF.\n\nThere were some things that I liked. I liked the slow burn romance. I liked most of the characters, especially Charles. And I liked the happy ending.\n\nI don't really recommend this book unless you want something fluffy/light and can get past all the negatives I mentioned above.\n\nOne last thing. James mentioned that his brother never loses his temper, and Emma says that he always loses it around her. Is that supposed to be romantic? Because it actually really bothered me that they acted like it was, when it seemed really problematic that he loses his temper around her when normally he's more composed.\n\nUpdate (12/31/17): Changed my rating to 2 stars. The more I thought about this book, the more I realized there were more things I disliked than liked.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nNovember 19, 2017\n\nOh heavens! That was fun! I think several people might give this a 4* rating rather than a 5* if they're getting technical or looking for a strict regency read and all proper characters but that's not what this is at all. I so did not expect some of the twists and turns that were in this book. But I loved it! I laughed out loud, got a little frustrated at some characters, aka Hartley, got a little emotional along with them (tears, anger, some swoony sighs), but overall just kept turning the pages and having a grand ol' time while reading! And yes, I was highlighting like crazy!\n\nWe've got contemporary time, England, time travel, Regency time, magic, unconventional moments and lots of laughs packed into this story.\n\nEmma cracked me up! When she's transported back in time and finds herself completely out of her element, she steps up to the plate and delivers. Could you imagine finding yourself in the Regency time period without knowing about the customs and societal expectations? Well that's exactly what happens to Emma. And her little quips...definitely kept the Regency characters on their toes trying to figure out what she was saying to them. I had to laugh when she first thought she was dreaming and starts talking to Lord Hartley as if he was her dream man. Oh heavens...open mouth, insert foot! Especially when she discovers she's not dreaming. Ha! Talk about getting into some interesting conversations when what she thought was being said was not what someone else thought was being said. Her giggles over a whist game, or riding horses, or being name-ist (because the name Kitty was definitely a little bit or a lot a bit used for similar characters).\n\nOk, maybe those few references won't mean anything to you if you haven't read the book, but those of you who have, you totally understand. Those of you who will be reading it, you'll know soon enough.\n\nHartley, well he may be a little slow in my book because of his whole, \"you're going to marry my brother\" attitude. But I think I might forgive him when he comes to his senses...finally! And what brings him to his senses, fun, fun, fun. Gotta love family and plans and plots and being too absorbed to see what's right in front of you. Ok, I guess I loved Hartley too!\n\nSeriously this was just fun from the get go. Charles...yep loved, absolutely loved and adored Charles! By the way, Charles is the aunt and the best aunt EVER! She had me laughing and cheering her on at all of her fun antics and sly ways.\n\nAnd Cinderella, yes it has always been one of my favorite fairy tales and I'll just say that the whole usage of it in this story only had me loving it more.\n\nIf you're looking for prim and proper and dead on the money type Regency read, keep looking. But if you want something that will just be pure fun and laughs and such, grab this one!\n\nThere were a couple times though that I felt like Emma and Hartley were being a little repetitive in their back and forth but even with feeling that way I think it worked for the storyline. I can see some readers possibly thinking some of that could have been shortened or his referencing a past love and heartache a few more times than necessary. But like I said, I think it worked and kept the tension and angst flowing in the story.\n\nI really want to share lots of my quotes with you but after I scrolled through them I think they'd be spoilerish and I just can't do that, so you only get one quote that I hope you'll enjoy!\n\n\"I would suppose that every time period would have their advantages or disadvantages. No place would be perfect,\" he mused. \"That what would matter would be the people you chose to pass it with.\" That drive I felt to go back to my own time? That was about being timesick, not homesick. He was right. The people who loved you mattered. I felt more at home here than I ever had anywhere else.\n\nThis book was seriously just what I needed the last two days. Life has been super busy culminating with all these projects finishing up this week and weekend. And little sleep and emotions high as well as the anniversary today of a tragic and shocking death of a loved one that just still hurts. So to say that I needed something lighthearted and distracting and that this completely delivered is absolutely true! Thanks Sariah Wilson for a fun escape from everything while I dove in and enjoyed your book!!! Many thanks and many hugs!\n\nContent: Clean. There is some mild innuendo scattered throughout the book. Some more intense kissing scenes but nothing more than kissing. Some talk about sex, nothing graphic, mostly at the beginning that the main character doesn't want to have sex before marriage and has been pressured by dates to do so.\n\nI received a copy from the publisher, Kindle Press, via NetGalley. All thoughts and opinions in the review are my own.\n\nHappy Reading!!!\n\nApril 8, 2018\n\nCould have been a great read\n\nWhy the author decided the main character Emma had to be an idiot, I have no idea. Why would you set the character up as having a college degree in America history and then have her go back in time and not understand ANY of the cultural references. So disappointing. Their was nice background development for the characters and why they were an emotional wreck but if you want your heroine to be a clueless imbecile don’t give them a college education and an internship in an 19th century museum.\n\nJanuary 20, 2018\n\nThis was quite an enjoyable light read.\n\nEmma is an American who travels through time from 2017 to 1816 through a house, that is now a museum, in England where she is working with her friend Bex, a fellow historian, for the Summer.\n\nShe meets Hartley, who seems to think she is someone else, and of course they fall in love throughout the book after a series of mishaps.\n\nWhile I did enjoy the story, I thought it was too drawn out. Also Hartley, while being portrayed as some kind of demi-God, was actually quite annoying at times. He was a bit thick about his feelings for Emma and was a bit sickeningly self sacrificing for the 'good of the family' etc.\n\nAbout a third of the way into the book I seriously considered DNF'ing the book as magic came into it and I can't stand magic in stories. It didn't seem to serve any purpose either other than to make Aunt Charles ready to accept Emma's story as soon as told. For me it spoiled the story. Having said that, Aunt Charles was a wonderful character and I enjoyed her machinations very much. It's credit to the author that I continued on because I needed to know how it ended.\n\nThe ending was lovely and the epilogue was perfect.\n\nSo if you like your Time Travel with a dash of magic then you'll certainly enjoy this.\n\nJuly 9, 2022\n\nThis book was both adorable and hilarious!\n\nDecember 15, 2017\n\nThis book was highly entertaining to me. I smiled a LOT and I even giggled out loud a few times. I love when books amuse me. Then you add in the ever growing attraction and tension between Emma and Hartley and I was completely hooked. There were a few times I was mentally pulling my hair out and yelling, \"Oh, COME ON!\" only to be right back to giggling the next minute. So fun.\n\nThere is a great cast of characters in this book and I loved the touch of the magical here. I'd love to see this book grow into a series with some back stories about Hartley's sisters.\n\nSariah Wilson is a go-to author for me. This book is not like her others but it is surely one of her most amusing. This is the perfect book for a romantic escape. It will lighten your day and bring a smile to your face.\n\nContent: some kissing, making out that gets a little steamy but stays clean\n\n- I received a copy of this book, per my request, from the publisher via NetGalley. All opinions expressed are my own.\n\nMarch 30, 2022\n\nThe number of time travel romances I've been reading lately...and they've all been clean too 😭😭😭 Since I'm not getting any (at the moment), I need to be reading about it. I've been reading a lot of TT lately because they're all on my t0-be-read list from when I was 17. This one was the best of the time travel romances I've read lately.\n\nI feel badly giving this 3 stars, when it was written like a 5 star book. It's just I didn't really like it enough to give 4 stars. The humor, however, was excellent. Finally, a heroine who is not boring!! I had been talking about that with my friends Ainhoa and Irunía how most heroines in romance novels are a little on the boring side. In fact, if I had to choose, the heroine was a lot more interesting than the hero. When she realized she had fallen in love with him (which thank god took a lot longer than the other books I've been reading lately!), I was thinking to myself how then he had definitely fallen in love with her already (because she had an interesting personality).\n\nYes, part of the heroine's humor relied on pop culture references, but it was still all amusing. Later on this evening, after finishing the book, I second guessed myself messaging my friend because it wasn't \"interesting\" or \"funny\" enough. This book gave me a little bit of an inferiority complex.\n\nAnd then when it was revealed in the book that magic existed and the hero's aunt and other female family members were all witches...I was like don't we have enough going on here with time travel 😂\n\nIt didn't seem to serve so much of a purpose in the story (besides a magic spell bringing Emma 200 years to the past) unless Aunt Charles (loved her) was really controlling the weather after all & making thunderstorms happen to put Emma and Hartley together?? And making the servants disappear another time? However, since it was in the story, I would have liked to have known more about their powers and what they could do. It would have better if it was fleshed out a little more.\n\nEmma's question what should I do all day was so relatable, because when I read regency romances, I'm always wondering what these upper class women do all day, when they have servants to look after most of their needs. I was surprised that she didn't know that the original fairy tales weren't happy (rather, they were slightly gruesome) or what being compromised meant (but I guess she hadn't read regency romances like I have).\n\nI thought the appearance of the real Miss Blythe (they thought Emma was this lady) was a hoot, and I'm glad the author had the courage to add that part. I was thinking that Emily could be James's bride and Emma could be Hartley's. Though I don't think Emma ever told him what happened to the original girl (?). But I kept wondering why Hartley's brother James, who Hartley wanted Emma, or Miss Blythe, to wed, still hadn't shown up for most of the book. In other romance novels I've read where the hero/heroine is supposed to marry the other sibling, the other sibling is there for most of the book.\n\nHartley was also super stubborn at the end. It took him a while to realize his feelings of love for Emma.\n\nAlso, it's kind of weird how we'll never think of the hero by his first name LOL...literally no one called him Jaxon. Not even his brother.\n\nAbout it being a clean read: their kisses were so steamy & they were going at it so intensely, you could tell even the characters wanted to have sex 😂\n\nApril 9, 2021\n\nAmerican Emma Damon has recently taken a job at Hartley Hall in London. One day she decides to check out a part of the house that is off limits...and ends up time-traveling back to Regency England. The Earl of Hartley, Jackson Portwood, is not surprised when Emma ends up on his doorstep. Since he has sworn off women and will not be marrying, Hartley has made a pact with a Mr. Blythe that his daughter, Emily, will visit their estate with the intent of marrying Hartley's younger brother. Hartley has been told that Emily is a quiet woman with an interest in botany which should please his brother. But the woman who is now living in his home is anything but quiet. She makes confusing statements and challenges him at every turn. Hartley didn't expect to become enamored with this beautiful woman and plans to marry her to his brother as soon as possible.\n\nI've always found time-travel stories entertaining and this one is no exception. Yes, the time-travel story doesn't offer us anything new. The hero who falls in love with the woman he has picked for his brother has been told time and again. But I had so much fun listening to this audiobook, I didn't care that there wasn't anything original. Emma is a great heroine who misses her junk food and computer. But she finds that Hartley is more than enough to keep her interested in staying in Regency England.\n\nThe conversations between the Emma and Hartley were sometimes hilarious. The secondary characters, especially Aunt Charles, were fun. Each chapter opened with Emma listing \"Things I'm going to invent if I'm ever stuck in 1816.\" The narration by Ann Marie Gideon was perfect. I highly recommend his audiobook if you're looking for a light story to while away the time. My rating: 5 Stars.\n\nApril 2, 2018\n\nIf you want some \"laugh-out-loud\" moments this would be a great book to pick up. It features a young woman who has time traveled to the Regency Period. The descriptions of the stark differences in luxuries remind me how grateful I am to be here in this time period. The way of life, mannerisms, and language are very different. The descriptions of putting on a corset: NO THANK YOU!\n\nThe book is full of sarcastic humor that helped make it fun to read. There were a few moments when I felt it lagged, but overall, it has a good pacing.\n\nThe book contains some pretty intense kissing and a ton of innuendo.\n\nSource: Kindle Unlimited.\n\nOctober 26, 2017\n\nWhat would you give up for your one true love? Well Emma Damon finds that when she travels from 2017 back to 1816 she has to give up modern conveniences to be in the arms of Hartley. Hartley is a man who has closed off his heart and hardened his soul against romance because of the loss of a women. Emma knows that she must adapt to her new age in order to survive but is she willing to be wed to a man she has not met? This story revolves around a group of many unique characters that the reader wishes to know more about. Wonder if Wilson intends to explore them in a series? Amusement and paranormal surprises make this glued to your hands read not to be missed. \"A copy of this book was provided by Kindle Press via NetGalley with no requirement for a review. Comments here are my honest opinion.\"\n\nNovember 12, 2018\n\nI didn’t like this book at all. I finished it, but there wasn’t anything I liked. Mostly because the main character was just...stupid.\n\nIf you had traveled back in time to the 19th century - would you try to adjust your language ... or at the very least not mention modern events like cell phones and WWII? Not in a - you’ll never believe the future kind of way but in a just dropping into regular conversation kind of way. No you wouldn’t.\n\nFor someone who “specialized” in the time period - this character seemed surprised by the gender norms? And the fashion? And the way things were? BS - I don’t buy it for a second.\n\nNot to mention there were soooo many inconsistencies. Soooooooo many.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nOctober 24, 2023\n\nTime travelling fun! 5 stars!\n\nLoved it. I was definitely in the mood for this!\n\nYou could tell the author was having such fun with this and with the stoic grump, Hartly... so if you are willing to suspend belief and just accept that this is pure fun and fantasy (and not a deep dive into accurate 1816 historial fiction), if you like time travel madness and regency romance manners, then this is definitely a rec for you!\n\nLoved the audio version too.\n\nNovember 18, 2017\n\nHilarious and romantic slow burn\n\nEmma Damon falls in love with a painting then falls into the past to meet the man himself. He’s handsome, annoying, and seriously weakening her resolve to get back to the 21st Century.\n\nJaxon, Earl of Hartley, is trying his hardest not to fall for his brother’s mail order bride (it makes sense in context) as he tries to make her acceptable to polite society, but her unconventional ways are making it difficult and it seems like his entire family are bent on playing matchmaker for the wrong brother.\n\nThis book is hilarious. I laughed out loud at several pieces of dialogue, from walking into the linen closet to kicking over an urn. Emma is so delightfully awkward and perfectly made to drive Hartley up the wall. I did feel that the constant dissection of modern slang got a little wearying, especially when it didn’t seem that obscure (seriously, a 21st Century co-worker would understand ‘hang out and hook up’, even if she’s British, right?).\n\nI loved how the relationship grew from a mutual attraction to a genuine connection over time; the scene where Hartley is praising Emma to his brother is really sweet. While I don’t normally go for jealousy as a dating tactic, it was handled deftly enough to be endearing than infuriating.\n\nThe mystical element came a little out of left field, but hopefully there will be more books to explore it a little further. Hartley certainly has enough siblings for a series and we see just enough of them to be interested. Aunt Charles is also, hands-down, the best, even if her matchmaking was so blatant it makes Hartley look oblivious.\n\nI received a copy of this story from the author through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\nAugust 17, 2018\n\nI like this author, but this book needed some work.\n\nThe main character, a student of history working in a museum in London, was constantly perplexed by cultural mores of the past...something she should have been well aware of.\n\nAnd a big gripe from me is that there are a lot of thunderstorms in this version of London. Which is supposed to be reality, where there aren't a lot of thunderstorms in London. There's lot's of drizzly rain, maybe some windy showers, but not a lot of storms. Especially storms with thunder. And that's a fact that could have been easily verified.\n\nAnd there are some major plot holes... I won't go into detail, but sometimes I wanted to bang my head against a wall.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that while this is an enjoyable light read, there were some tactical errors that could have been easily fixed, and weren't.\n\nNovember 27, 2018\n\nI loved the premise of this novel but my god did I find Emma annoying. She was so annoying that I had to stop reading, despite wanting to know more about the time travel and about Hartley.\n\nEmma had supposedly spent time reviewing regency letters and was a history graduate, yet she was absolutely clueless about regency life. The encounters where she messed up in the regency period were more eyeroll than enjoyable. Given her career history, she should have at least been able to badly fake it. Instead she ran around with her annoying American slang and putting her foot in it and I just gave up.\n\nLove the idea but not the end product.\n\nNovember 12, 2017\n\nFrom the moment I began I fell in love with this book! Usually I am not as big a fan of time travel, but this book really did it for me. The author did such a great job in her characterization, I found myself laughing at many parts and tearing up at others.\n\nI loved loved LOVED our main character, Emma. She was spunky and fun and said exactly what she thought. I enjoyed her foray into the Regency era, where she did not quite fit in or know what to do. I loved how she was always true to herself -even after learning all the mannerisms and rules of etiquette, she never truly lost who she was or her quirky mannerisms.\n\nThe romance between her and Hartley was so adorable. I loved how they quarreled and bantered back and forth. It was a clean romance, but with lots of swoon-worthy moments (my favorite kind).\n\nThe author made it so easy to fall in love with the many characters in this book, and I ate up the pages in less than two days. I truly hope the author plans to write more books in this era. I have really enjoyed each book she has written!\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nMy brain…I can feel it seeping out of my ears.\n\nIn all seriousness, I need time to digest the past week of nonsense I suffered through. So stay tuned, I’ll be back to go over this hot mess of a book.\n\n11/08/23 addition: What do I even say about this? It was unpleasant and repetitive and all-around nonsensical. I was so excited for a time travel story a la Kate and Leopold but instead I got Not Like Other Girls™ quirkiness and a love story that was so unhealthy.\n\nTHINGS THAT MADE ME GO \"HUH\"?\n\n•Plenty of people have pointed out that Emma has an American history degree, and while this takes place in England, I doubt America and Great Britain had enough differences in 1812 to warrant her reacting to things the way that she did. Her education went out the window in favor of her being Zany and Quirky and \"Feminist\", almost as if the author was worried we wouldn't like Emma if she didn't put up a fight and go against social norms - and failing to realize that making her so Zany and Quirky and \"Feminist\" made her all the more irritating and obnoxious. Even if she didn't have a degree, she had no excuse after the first few times she slipped up and referenced modern things, because any normal person would (hopefully) try to blend in and not draw unwanted attention to make their time in the past a bit more bearable. Not Emma, because normal is a dryer setting and it's so much better that she's ZANY AND QUIRKY AND \"FEMINIST\". Because that's what makes a good protagonist, right?\n\n•Side note: I put feminist in quotes because for someone who claims to be one, Emma sure did a lot of needless slut-shaming for someone from the year 2017. And again, her education should have prepared her for the restrictions women had to endure in 1812, instead of her acting surprised and irate every time she encountered them.\n\n•It was way too convenient that Emma only had one person she was attached to in 2017. Aside from giving up modern conveniences (which I doubt she would have been able to believably live without for how much she complained), having little to no ties to anyone other than Bex ensured that her choice to stay in 1812 wouldn't be a difficult one. It would have been far more interesting if she had trouble choosing, or even if there were a time frame where she needed to make a decision after a certain amount of time. As is, she just kind of hems and haws about it before accepting life in the past...which, again, given how her character is written, it wasn't believable to have her give up modern hygiene and women's rights.\n\n•Hartley was thoroughly unlikable and gave the likes of Rochester and Heathcliffe a run for their money. He's uptight and rude and he can't even bother to know the names of his staff, yet he's supposedly this secret romantic who just needs the right girl to come along and melt his freezer-burned heart. Spare me. All he and Emma did were argue and belittle each other (and throw things, in her case), which is a horrible foundation for a lasting relationship.\n\n•The whole \"the women in our family are witches\" surprise was out of nowhere and never given a good explanation. It felt like a story from the Episode app with how juvenile the concept was and how poorly integrated it was into the plot - especially when it wasn't even that important or consequential. And going off of that, the magic that got Emma to the past in the first place is never explored further than passive curiosity. Why have an explanation when she's not even going back to the future?\n\n•Normally I put writing techniques in the Nitpick Corner, but the dual POV was distracting with how the author chose to approach it. Emma's POV is first person, while Hartley's is third person limited...an odd combination, but not uncommon in stories I've read over the years. What makes this jarring and unbearable is the way the page breaks signal a POV shift WITHIN THE SAME CHAPTER. It's not as if they don't have their own individual chapters, because they do, but as the story goes on, there were more POV switching in the middle of a chapter and it ground things to a halt. Amateur writing tip: please never do this; there's a reason authors usually pick one kind of POV, even for multiple characters.\n\n•The confused reactions to Emma's vernacular and tendency to reference modern things got old incredibly fast. I hope you enjoy \"I don't understand how x can be related to y\" sentences, because they show up all the time. I'm going to wake up in the night mumbling these in a cold sweat for how much they haunt me.\n\n•The miscommunication got more contrived near the end of the book. The scene where Hartley declares he doesn't love Emma and won't marry her or whatever made me groan out loud, because of course she's there listening and of course it makes her suddenly doubt all that they've been through and now she has no reason to stay in the past if he doesn't love her the way she loves him. Again: spare me. Miscommunication comes with the romance genre, but for the love of God, it's possible to make it relatively painless, or at the very least make sense with the narrative. It was not utilized well here (surprising, I know) and it just dragged the pointless conflict out even longer.\n\nNITPICK CORNER\n\n•The Godwins were a red herring if I've ever seen one. Does James end up with what's-her-name even after Hartley's scheming? Does George screw off after getting his face pounded in? I guess they're not important beyond plot obstacles.\n\n•The 1812-equivalent of a Twinkie wedding cake. You read that right. A wedding cake in 1812 made from imitation Twinkies. What a world.\n\nI'm never forgiving myself for spending money on this. Maybe I just don't get it, because a lot of reviews like this author and her other works, and it's possible I'm just getting more jaded and cynical the older I get. But I'm fine with being more jaded and cynical in this case, because wow. Not worth the money and certainly not worth the energy I wasted reading this.\n\nOctober 28, 2017\n\nEmma Damon, a recent graduate, received a scholarship to study in London. Working in Hartley Hall, Emma knows the Rose Room is off limits but she just can’t resist. Finding a hidden room behind a portrait adds to Emma’s excitement. Unfortunately, she finds herself trapped and loses consciousness. Waking up confused and shocked in 1816, all Emma wants is to return home.\n\nHartley is a man who has closed off his heart and hardened his soul against romance because of the loss of a woman. He is determined this unusual woman marry his brother despite his own growing attraction. Enlisting the help of his Aunt Charles, he seeks to make Emma the toast of the ton.\n\nI hope Ms Wilson intends to develop this into a series as she created an interesting mix of characters and word building that deserve to be explored.\n\nI received a copy of this book from the publishers via netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\nFor my full review please see my blog\n\nhttp://wonderfullyweird88.com/?p=324\n\nOctober 31, 2017\n\n-‘“Toto, I don’t think we’re in the twenty-first century anymore,” I whispered... Somehow, I had time traveled. I had gone back two hundred years.’-\n\nI snort-laughed more times than I could count reading this. As always when it comes to Sariah Wilson’s work, I was well entertained and had a very hard time putting the book down. I am not usually a fan of time-travel books or paranormal romances but when I saw who the author was, I immediately requested to read this on NetGalley and it certainly was not a disappointment. I loved every moment. I highly recommend this book. Excellent, as always. This was my favourite book of hers (yet). It’s soooo steamy (but she still keeps it clean, no worries there), like toe-curling stuff - and that ending! -Magical!\n\nOctober 24, 2017\n\nWhat a darling book! I loved Hartley and Emma, but Charles stole the show. She was fantastic. The story was wonderful and loved the deep, rich, characters. Emma never failed to crack me up and Charles' conniving was so much fun. Especially loved the epilogue. Another Sariah Wilson book I found very hard to put down.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nI can't even imagine waking up to a life 200 years in the past, but that's just what happened to Emma. A spell thrusts her from 2017 to 1816 in the blink of an eye--can you imagine?\n\nI've often thought the Regency time period would be a wonderful time to live in, but watching Emma navigate the differences between these two time periods was quite eye-opening. Giving up modern conveniences, such as flushing toilets, internet, and smart phones, for corsets, balls, and completely different social norms would be quite an adjustment and it was pure entertainment to watch.\n\nHartley is determined to marry Emma off to his brother, to keep the family line going, but there are some magical sparks that are undeniable. I laughed so hard at some of the things that came out of Emma's mouth and the way she caught Hartley off guard so often. Their interactions and banter were the best, as she's so excited to enjoy every new thing and he's a crusty grump, with a hard shell around his heart. Sariah Wilson writes such swoony scenes and I loved the kisses, as well as the awesome cast of characters. Aunt Charles was especially delightful!\n\nI was completely captivated by the way everything tied together. In fact, after I finished the book, I had to go back and read the first chapter again. I would be more than happy to read more about this intriguing family.\n\nContent: mild+ romance (swoony kisses and light innuendo)\n\n*I received a complimentary copy through Netgalley. All thoughts and opinions are my own and were voluntarily given.*\n\nOctober 10, 2020\n\n3.5 stars rounded up to 4. This was a fun book that didn’t take itself too seriously, and it was very entertaining. Audio narration was great.\n\nSeptember 26, 2021\n\nAt this point, I seriously considering if I should continue reading this book? it feels like the author needed excuses to proceed with the story and so do I, to continue reading it!\n\nNovember 8, 2017\n\nI recieved a copy of this book from Netgalley and Kindle Press in exchange for an honest review.\n\nWhen I put in a request for a copy of this book I was honestly a little worried... ANOTHER time travelling romance?? Been there. Done that. TO DEATH!! What a breath of fresh air this book was!! Lighthearted, entertaining and I LOVED that the 19th century male romantic interest wasn't your typical broody Darcy/Hearhcliffe character. (not that I would EVER bad mouth Darcy!.. But there can only be one!) I loved that Hartley had his own personality and wit. Sure, he had a little of the brood. But, it was broody with a twinkle. Lol!\n\nMy only complaint would be Emma's incessant propensity to throw around 21st century colloquialisms even when she had been in the 19th century for a while. I can understand them slipping out, but she talked like she wasn't even trying to stop them and make sense. In reality she probably would have been thrown out or burned at the stake or something.. Not had some handsome count fall in love with her. But, a little suspension of belief is never a bad thing for a cute, entertaining read!\n\nNovember 16, 2017\n\nEmma, a 2017 recent college grad, finds herself in 1816. Mistakenly believed to be Miss Emily Blythe, who is coming from America to wed the Earl of Hartley's brother, Emma goes along with the mistaken identity while she tries to figure out how to get back to 2017!\n\nThe more time she spends with the Earl of Hartley, the less motivated she is to leave 1816. There are lots of secrets in the Earl's family and a lot of fun family members - hopefully we will get some of their stories in future books!\n\nI felt like the pacing in this book was a little slow at times, but overall I thought it was a fun read! It was easy to like Emma and Hartley and to cheer for their HEA!\n\nContent: Clean\n\nSource: Netgalley (opinion is 100% my own)\n\nJune 29, 2022\n\nThis book is one of the funnest I've ever read! The author took a premise, realized it was ridiculous, and just ran with it. This book is clearly just meant to entertain and I respect that. Everything about the story was over the top and silly. You could tell that the author had a blast writing this and in turn that made me really enjoy it. I bet this is riddled with historical inaccuracies but that doesn't matter at all since the purpose of this book was to entertain and not educate.\n\nI'm sure I'll read this again in the future. It is the perfect book to just turn off your brain and enjoy the story.\n\nNovember 21, 2017\n\nEmma Damon has no family so when she has an opportunity to go to London and work at Hartley Hall. She loves the history of it all. Temptation is just too great so Emma falls asleep in the Rose room and wakes up in the 1800s in Hartley Hall when it was a home for the Portwood family. The Earl thinks she is the young lady from America he was expecting to marry off to his brother. Emma decides for now she will pretend she is who he thinks she is. Eventually she tells his Aunt Charles what happened but the aunt can see there are some sparks between them. The brother isn't expected yet so we''ll see what happens in the mean time. This is a feel good story for anyone."
