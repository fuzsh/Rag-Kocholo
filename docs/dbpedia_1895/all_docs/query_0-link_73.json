It can be played with a large cast or (as in the original West End production) with a total cast of 18 (10 men and 8 women). Many of the secondary characters listed are \"walk-on\" non-speaking roles only, and as such can be expanded/eliminated as the director wishes. For example, the Three Blind Mice would most likely be cast from the chorus of villagers, and with the aid of appropriate props would \"act out\" the actions indicated in the lyrics at that moment.\n\n10 female, 14 male\n\nMain Characters\n\nSecondary Characters\n\nAristocratic Pussy Cat\n\nClown\n\nCockney Pussy Cat\n\nDaddy, Mummy and Baby Bear\n\nDandyish Pussy Cat\n\nDragon\n\nGoldilocks\n\nJack Frost\n\nKing and Queen of Hearts\n\nLittle Boy Blue\n\nLittle Bo-Peep\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\n\nOgre\n\nOwl and the Pussy Cat\n\nSnowman\n\nTown Crier\n\nTeacher\n\nWitch\n\nWolf\n\nBaker's Man\n\nBlackbird\n\nDaffy Down Dilly\n\nFarmer\n\nFarmer's Wife\n\nGeorgie Porgy\n\nGoosey Gander\n\nGrandmother\n\nKitty Fisher\n\nKnave of Hearts\n\nLady on a Cock Horse\n\nLittle Miss Muffet\n\nLittle Tommy Tucker\n\nLittle Tommy Flynn\n\nLittle Tommy Stout\n\nLucy Locket\n\nMaid\n\nMary\n\nOld King Cole\n\nOld Mother Hubbard\n\nDog\n\nPercy Pig\n\nPiggy-Wig\n\nRingmaster\n\nRobin Redbreast\n\nThree Blind Mice\n\nThree Fiddlers\n\nTom, the Piper's Son\n\nTurkey\n\nTweedledum and Tweedledee\n\nTwo Soldiers\n\nChorus of Schoolchildren\n\nChorus of Villagers\n\nCircus Animals (Optional)\n\nThe doublings for the original West End production\n\nMale\n\nClown\n\nTom, Tom the Piper's son, The Owl, Jack Frost, Villager\n\nGeorgie Porgy, Dragon, Piggy-Wig, Villager, Schoolchild\n\nLittle Tommy Tucker, Little Boy Blue, Puss in Boots, Knave of Hearts, Ringmaster\n\nCockney Pussy Cat, Wolf, Fiddler, Schoolchild\n\nSoldier, Fiddler, Dandyish Pussy Cat, Schoolchild\n\nDaddy Bear, King of Hearts, Farmer\n\nTown Crier, Old King Cole, Schoolchild\n\nTweedledum, Turkey, Ogre\n\nAristocratic Pussy Cat, Soldier, Fiddler, Snowman, Villager\n\nFemale\n\nRed Riding Hood, Villager, Schoolchild\n\nTweedledee, Baby Bear, Grandma\n\nPussy Cat, Villager, Schoolchild\n\nMummy Bear, Witch, Farmer's Wife, Teacher\n\nLady on a Cock Horse, Old Mother Hubbard, Blackbird, Schoolchild\n\nMiss Muffet, Daffy Down Dilly, Villager, Schoolchild\n\nMary, Little Bo-Peep, Goldilocks\n\nGoosey Gander, Villager, Schoolchild\n\nInstrumentation:\n\nWoodwind I\n\nFlute\n\nClarinet in Bb\n\nAlto Saxophone in Eb\n\nWoodwind II\n\nClarinet in Bb\n\nBass Clarinet in Bb\n\nAlto Saxophone in Eb\n\nTrumpet in Bb / Flugelhorn in Bb (Flugelhorn optional)\n\nElectric / Acoustic Guitar (both optional)\n\nAcoustic Piano / Electric Piano (Electric Piano optional)\n\nBass (String or Electric)\n\nPercussion I\n\nTimpani (2)\n\nXylophone\n\nVibraphone\n\nGlockenspiel\n\nTambourine\n\nMaracas\n\nCastanets\n\nSuspended Cymbal\n\nBell Tree\n\nSleigh Bells\n\nPercussion II\n\nStandard Drum Kit\n\nTriangle\n\nTemple Blocks (2)\n\nWoodblock\n\nFinger Cymbals\n\nMouth Siren / Whistle\n\nVocal Score and Libretto available on hire only\n\nÂ"
