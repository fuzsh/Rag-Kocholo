        "text": "Introducing the first ILLUSTRATED series from Stuart Gibbs\n\nTim is just a peasant, but he dreams big. He wants more out of life than to grow up to be a woodsman like his father. Unfortunately, the only route to success in the kingdom of Merryland is to be born a prince. Still, Tim is determined. He is brave and clever and always tries to do the right thing—even though he rarely gets the credit for it.\n\nThen news spreads that Princess Grace of the neighboring kingdom has been abducted by the evil Stinx and Prince Ruprecht needs a legion of knights to join him on his quest to rescue her. Tim finally has the lucky break he’s been waiting for, the opportunity to change his station in life. And even though he doesn’t know how to ride a horse or wield anything more deadly than a hoe, he’s going to do whatever it takes to make sure his dream becomes a reality.\n\n“A charming take on the traditional knightly adventure… The book’s fun comes from Gibbs’s deployment of deadpan humor and boisterous slapstick.” – The New York Times\n\n“This giddy romp through a medieval setting, complete with menacing trolls and gigantic, bloodthirsty butterflies, is the start of a promising series.” — Booklist\n\nClick here to order it!"
