        "text": "February 22, 2021\n\n(B-) 68% | Satisfactory\n\nNotes: Its supporting characters are undeveloped, the story is unremarkable, and it expects familiarity with previous books.\n\nJanuary 2, 2021\n\nThe fact that I completely forgot to review this is very telling.\n\nAfter trying to read the new companion series to His Dark Materials, I was very disappointed. I still wanted to get more from this world and decided to try this prequel. You finally get the story of how Lee Scoresby and Iorek Byrnison became friends... and it was a let down.\n\nBig meh.\n\nOctober 27, 2017\n\nI'm currently re-reading Northern Lights, the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy. Not too long ago I also found out about the two companion books and this is the first.\n\nThis little cloth-bound beauty tells the story of Lee Scoresby, the hot-air balloonist that helps Lyra in the first volume, and how he became friends (the best of friends in fact) with Iorek Byrnison, the panserbjørn. It tells of old rivalries and a conspiracy that Lee has to fight and although we already know the ending to this story, it is very fast-paced and thrilling.\n\nMaking this little book even more special are the illustrations\n\nas well as the board game that is included in a back pocket\n\nPeronsally, I love it when an author has his whole world shaped and fleshed out, filled with loads of interesting places and characters and Philip Pullman proves here that his world is indeed very much alive and detailed.\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\nThis is a prequel novella to His Dark Materials series, following side-character and aeronaut, Lee Scoresby, on his adventures prior to those that occur during the central trilogy.\n\nLee pilots his hot air balloon to a secluded Arctic community and, upon looking for temporary employment there, discovers a dark figure from his past and becomes embroiled in darker political scheming instead.\n\nWhilst it was unrelated to the main story-line in any other way than featuring some of the same characters, I found it both a fun and fascinating tale in its own right, with plenty of bloody action scenes and underhanded tactics taking place.\n\nThis beautiful, little hardback book also came with illustrations peppered throughout, some mock documents at the close of it, and even a fun little game for the reader to play upon completion.\n\nNovember 14, 2015\n\nIt's been ages since I reread His Dark Materials, so I don't have a clear image of Lee Scoresby in my head - and I don't remember his, surprisingly kickass, daemon Hester at all. I'm ashamed of this, she is an energetic, cussing delight.\n\nI do remember being incredibly intrigued by Iorek and the whole idea of armored bears, and of course, I think we all wondered how on earth those two ended up as friends. This story does it justice, I think.\n\nIt's very short, but it tells a fulfilling and engaging story, with a lot of really nice moments for the various characters.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's too short. Not because it rushes anything (it's perfectly paced - any rushing is Lee's fault for apparently being a firm believer in not doing tomorrow what you can do today), but because Lee is a proper adventurer, a good man and a ridiculous risk taker - a worthy combination - and I'd read countless books about his adventures if they existed, but alas. I'm happy we got this much.\n\nOctober 20, 2018\n\n‘Once Upon a Time in the North’ by Philip Pullman (2008) – with striking illustrations by engraver John Lawrence is a lovely and very well presented hardback book, which also includes the ballooning game – ‘Peril of The Pole’ tucked into the back cover.\n\nIn ‘Once Upon’ Pullman revisits the universe of ‘His Dark Materials’ – the main protagonist here being the wonderful character that is Texan balloonist/aeronaut Lee Scoresby and is concerned in part at least, with his first meeting with the armoured bear that is Iorek Byrnison.\n\nOstensibly Pullman’s book is on one level a relatively straightforward thriller, a classic cowboy adventure story or ‘ripping yarn’ even - except that being set in the world of ‘Dark Materials’ or course it’s not. ‘Once Upon’ is placed firmly in the world of daemons and of talking bears and in a world that is not unlike our own – but then again so very different.\n\nEven though ‘Once Upon’ comes in at a very compact 100 pages – as well as being a very well written and solid ‘Dark Materials’ story, Pullman has managed to work in underlying themes concerning corruption, power and lies – forces excerpted by powerful corporate organisations over the political and legal landscape for economic and political gain, power and ultimate control. Linked in with this theme is that concerning the marginalisation and demonization of a minority population, the engendering of prejudice – in this case concerning the bears…being a clear metaphor for similar portrayals and treatment of many minority populations in the non-Dark Materials world.\n\nSo whilst a book as compact as this cannot hope to pack the same literary punch as the original ‘Dark Materials’ trilogy – ‘Once Upon’ is a very strong book and a more than worthy addition to Pullman’s ‘Dark Materials’ canon.\n\nApril 6, 2012\n\nSo that's it. I've read every bit of writing that exists in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. It's a sad day for me. I loved the whole thing, and I wish there was more to it. I've seen the movie (regrettably), read the original three books, and now these two side-stories. I cannot recommend the series highly enough. To me it's superior to Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Narnia, ect. The whole concept of this universe fascinates me. Books like these are why I fell in love with reading. Thanks Mr. Pullman.\n\nMarch 14, 2020\n\nI really enjoyed this little prequel! I haven’t read the main books yet (they’re next) but I have seen both the movie and the t.v. show, so I had all the info I needed not to be completely lost... and it was really cool seeing some major characters meet for the first time.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend starting with this one if you have no prior knowledge of this world, though; you’d be wondering what the heck all this ‘dæmon’ business was, for a start, as there’s no explanation here...\n\nMay 6, 2016\n\nA nice short story to remind about the prehistory of \"His Dark Materials\"\n\nRead\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nThis is one of those times when “second star-to-the-right-and-straight-on-‘til-morning” is simply too complicated.\n\nPhilip Pullman’s Once Upon a Time in the North calls for dead reckoning at an elemental level. In this prequel to His Dark Materials trilogy, there is no golden compass (a.k.a. alethiometer) and no Lyra Silvertongue. In a time before her birth, Lee Scoresby has just come north from the Dakotas, where he won a navigable ballon in a questionable card game. The fact that he is missing vital pages from the Elements of Aerial Navigation manual that came with the balloon has not stopped him from turning aeronaut and somehow, finding the Barrents Sea Company Depot in a storm. It does, however, provide unnecessary challenges for his proposed landing, as does the lack of a wrench to use on the stuck gas-valve.\n\nUnholstering a rusted-up revolver, Scoresby bashes the valve into submission and negotiates a plunge-to-earth-style landing, which also serves to get the opening pages subtlety out of the way allowing Pullman to range freely and directly in a book that is little in size only. This is Pullman’s own antidote to complexity. Good is good and bad is mostly anything that deals with Larsen Manganese, an arctic mining company.\n\nNot that everything is exactly straightforward. The belle of the boarding house dinner table is not the local schoolmarm but the local librarian, and why wouldn’t she be? Moreover, Lee Scoresby’s daemon has been wrong about her own identity for her entire life heretofore. Iorek Byrnison and Lee Scoresby meet and become friends in the course of mispronouncing each other’s names as well as saving each other’s lives. Name mispronunciation appears to have been the bigger issue for them. And Scoresby breaks his own heart losing any chance he may have had (slim to none) in wooing said librarian by trying to provide sage advice.\n\nIt is about as unexpected a Pullman story as an aeronaut or any of us could ever expect. One of those books you read twice in a row because how could you not. Comes complete with a Pullman created board game in the back pocket and a series of end notes that are a story in themselves. – Steven S.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the North is an accelerated reader appropriate for middle grades.\n\nLexile measure: 900L\n\nRead\n\nMay 20, 2008\n\n\"Nice piece of oratorical flamboyancy.\" (--Hester)\n\nThis book was a gift. I *love* the size and shape of it, its compactness, the cloth cover, the way it fits so perfectly with its companion book, Lyra's Oxford, which I perversely keep with my guidebooks rather than my other Pullman novels.\n\nI am almost certain I would have liked the actual text better had I not been consumed with jealousy over the presentation. The story is less than 100 small pages long, directed at no obviously definable reader of any age, and is surely nonsensical in places to anyone who doesn't know His Dark Materials. For all the story's artistry it would not be considered publishable if it hadn't been written by, well, Philip Pullman. Yet because it is Pullman's, it is illustrated with beautiful woodcuts and appended with faked photographs of newspaper clippings, letters and an actual board game folded in a paper envelope in the back. I know that this beautiful little book was expensive to put together.\n\nLucky book. I am jealous.\n\nIt is mean and childish of me. And reduces my own pleasure in the reading, which should be great--I adore Pullman and this world of his. In spite of my jealousy, I want about five more of these beautiful little books with their discrete tales from the world of His Dark Materials so I can stack them up with the rest of my guidebooks.\n\nNovember 7, 2015\n\nAh so many distractions - especially when really I should be getting on with reading books I set out to read, but I guess when books like Once Upon A Time in the North come along you can sort of forgive me.\n\nThis is another short special set in the world of His Dark Materials. This time it introduces us to Lee Scoresby and how he started on the path that would eventually lead him to Lyra.\n\nThe story is short not reaching 100 pages however it does set the tone for what is to follow. He is a man on principles if prone to gambling (after all that is how he won the balloon that got him to this point) and this is something that earns him the respect and support you will see being drawn upon in the Dark Materials books.\n\nFor a story this short as you can imagine it is not very deep or challenging but it is a fun read and is what it is - if you enjoy the series then this is a fun distraction.\n\nJune 10, 2019\n\nParecía ilógico no leer este pequeño volumen después de haberme introducido en todo lo relacionado con La Materia Oscura, y una vez más quedé encantada. Estas novelas de Pullman son tan atractivas, que te llevan de vuelta a este mundo enorme y complejo. Agregue a esto que Lee Scoresby y su daemon Hester siempre han sido mis favoritos, y es un ganador. Fue genial descubrir que él era el personaje central de uno de los libros. Con aventura, viajes fantásticos y magia impredecible, este libro es una de las mejores novelas cortas de fantasía que jamás haya leído.\n\nEl material extra al final le da otra capa a la historia, conectando a Lyra con esta narrativa y ofreciendo algunos detalles de su vida desde los eventos de la trilogía. ¡Encantador!\n\nNovember 15, 2017\n\nIt seemed illogical not to read this small volume after having consumed everything related to His Dark Materials, and once again I was charmed. These novellas from Pullman are so compelling, pulling you back into this huge and complex world. Add to this that Lee Scoresby and his daemon Hester have always been favourites of mine, and it’s a winner :O)\n\nThe extra material at the end gives another layer to the story, connecting Lyra to this narrative and offering some details of her life since the events of the trilogy. Lovely! I cannot wait to see what Pullman gives her in the second Book of Dust.\n\nDecember 11, 2021\n\n3.5 stars\n\nIorek and Lee are two of my favourite characters, and I loved this story of how they met. It's the perfect meeting for these brave, adventurous people. My favourite part is how much they keep messing up each other's names. It's so annoying that characters in books always understand and remember names perfectly, which is so inconsistent with reality.\n\nThis story is short but exciting and a fitting meeting for two great adventurers.\n\nReview originally posted here on Britt's Book Blurbs.\n\nOther books in the His Dark Materials series:\n\n#0.6: The Collectors ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n#1: Northern Lights ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n#2: The Subtle Knife ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n#3: The Amber Spyglass ⭐⭐⭐\n\n#3.5: Lyra's Oxford ⭐⭐⭐\n\n#3.6: Serpentine ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nBlog | Bookstagram | Reddit | Twitter\n\nJanuary 20, 2017\n\nA novella that introduces the characters used in the series. This makes me want to read the rest of the series. I hadn't realized it would be so interesting.\n\nOctober 4, 2011\n\nThis short, little tale is a prequel to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, set decades before the events in Northern Lights. Here we meet Lee Scorsesby and the armored bear Iorek Byrninson, and learn how they came to know each other.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the North is a lovely story, and the title suggests a homage to Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West.\n\nBut the influence does not end there. Pullman's writing is fantastic and he conveys the steampunk atmosphere of a small port town perfectly; at such little amount of pages he is able to convey excellent descriptive narrative, fast-paced action and the development of many characters. Not a word seems to be missing, and the story is an adventure! Everybody loves an adventure, and there certainly is one here.\n\nThis short tale is signature Pullman, and reminded me a lot of Northern Lights, my favorite of his trilogy, in the sense of adventure and wonderful atmosphere. On such small amount of pages the novella manages to encompass everything important; the plot might sound simple, but it works on multiple levels. The story is a standalone which can satisfy both fans of His Dark Materials and newcomers to Pullman's world.\n\nPullman's writing draws the reader into the story, and its lenght is perfect for an evening reading session, in a warm chair, with milk and cookies. It was good to feel the cold winds of the north again; it made me want to read Northern Lights again. The volume is beautifully illustrated and contains a number of bonuses, such as photographs of Lyra's Oxford disseration and a board game, Peril of The Pole. Pullman has taken his time with writing this story, but he delivered splendidly.\n\nJuly 16, 2014\n\nA nice arctic Western. I'm totally down with authors of popular series publishing little related books like this, when they're such good stories.\n\nJuly 21, 2017\n\njust incredible;\n\nthe fantasy elements are a bit too much for me, though\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nWOW, now I'm hooked and need more of this stuff!\n\nSeptember 24, 2017\n\n3.5\n\nNO LEER ANTES DEL LIBRO #2\n\nUna aventura de Lee Scoresby de jovencito, en la época en que recién comenzaba sus andanzas como aeronauta...y aún no sabía aterrizar el globo.\n\nTiene su primer encuentro con Iorek, –aunque realmente interactúan bastante poco– y vemos un poco más su personalidad de aventurero temerario, siempre cerca de la quiebra y desoyendo los buenos consejos de su daemon.\n\nAhora lo vi como una una mezcla de Cowboy con Indiana Jones y un extra de embaucador, pero un embaucador con buenas intenciones y un alto sentido de la justicia. Sería un lindo personaje para que tenga su propia saga sinceramente.\n\nJuly 4, 2008\n\nDo yourself a favor, and read this quick little story.\n\nA fantastic little read in a very well presented format. Pullman has a command of language not to be missed. In this little tale we get a beguiling introduction to Lee Scoresby and his dæmon Hester, and who doesn't love Lee and Hester--a wry Texan with a heart of gold and his delightfully sarcastic companion.\n\nA sample-- after crash-landing his newly acquired air ballon:\n\nThe pilot gingerly untangled his fingers from the rope he'd been holding on to, worked out which way up he was, shifted the tool box off his legs, wiped the oily water out of his eyes, and hauled himself upright.\n\n'Well, Hester, looks like we're getting the hand of this,' he said. His dæmon, who looked like a small sardonic jackrabbit, flicked her ears as she clambered out of the tangle of tools, cold-weather clothing, broken instruments and rope. Everything was saturated.\n\n'My feelings are too deep to express, Lee,' she said.\n\nApril 13, 2008\n\nShort and sweet. It was nice to read about Lee Scoresby and Iorek Byrnison again. This time around, Scoresby seemed a bit brash and more quick-witted than I remembered but he was 30 something years younger so that might have something to do with it.\n\nI’m sure everyone’s main complaint will be that the book is too short (and I admit I was hit with a ting of dread around page 50 knowing that I was already closer to the ending than the beginning). However; just like Lyra’s Oxford, Scoresby’s story is the perfect length. It’s nice, and a rare thing, to find a book that can be read in one sitting and leave you with a smile when you are finished. It’s like receiving a letter from an old friend. You’re just happy to hear from them again.\n\nNow we sit and wait to hear from Will.\n\nAugust 29, 2024\n\nNajlepsza nowelka Pullmana i najlepszy dodatek, jaki powstał do Mrocznych Materii. Nie dość, że zawiera pierwsze spotkanie herosów tej serii, pewnego teksańskiego aeronauty i pancernego niedźwiedzia (kocham cię, Iorek 💙), to mamy jeszcze wysoką stawkę, ciekawą scenografię dalekiej Północy, porywy serca i cudowne potyczki słowne z dajmonami. Mamy też same dajmony, które są takim genialnym konceptem, że w czymkolwiek by się nie pojawiły, ma to od razu wielkiego plusa. Aha, no i wybitne tłumaczenie na język polski. Nie wiem, w którym wydawnictwie pracuje ten Maciej Bogdan, ale nikt inny nie potrafi tak dobrze uchwycić ducha oryginału.\n\nSeptember 21, 2008\n\nI cannot quite figure out who would enjoy this volume: for those who have never read the His Dark Materials Trilogy, daemons and the world around them might be too odd, without explanation at all. I like the \"western-gunslinger\" flavor but don't see how that can hold the interest of most young readers. Then, it is not enough, not meaty enough, not enough Iorek, at least, for a fan like me. I wanted to know MORE about their past and their earlier personalities and hardship/happiness -- this does not really supply. Have to say that I am quite disappointed."
