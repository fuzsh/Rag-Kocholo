        "text": "The Evil Queen rules with an iron fist every Sunday night on ABC's Once Upon a Time, and she's going to be doing the same in the pages of a new Marvel Comics graphic novel.\n\nAvailable Sept. 4 in comic shops, bookstores and digitally, Once Upon a Time: Shadow of the Queen is a tie-in to the world of familiar characters on the ABC series (now in its second season), both in the fabled Fairy Tale Land as well as the small-town real-world analogue of Storybrooke.\n\nThe graphic novel is written by Daniel Thomsen, the show's co-producer and former executive story editor, and Star Wars Legacy scribe Corinna Bechko. The five chapters in the book will be drawn by five different artists, including Nimit Malavia, Vasilis Lolos, Mike Del Mundo, Stephanie Hans and Mike Henderson.\n\nThomsen says Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis had been wanting to find a creative way to bring back the Huntsman (Irish actor Jamie Dornan), whose Storybrooke counterpart of Sheriff Graham was killed off early in the first season.\n\nShadow of the Queen takes place mostly in Fairy Tale Land and is set during a period begun in one episode, where the Huntsman is ordered by the Queen (Lana Parrilla) to kill Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and bring back her heart. He lets Snow go instead, and the Queen rips out the Huntsman's heart, which she then uses to control him.\n\nThe graphic novel explores the Huntsman's forced servitude to the Queen against his will, and how complicated that relationship can be when, during an especially harsh winter, the Queen schemes again to get Snow.\n\n\"Would he be able to temper the queen's evil impulses at all? Would she make him evil?\" Thomsen says.\n\n\"He's an interesting character to tackle in that way,\" Bechko adds. \"He's very noble and he has a code, but he can't always stick to that code. The tragic part for him is he knows that. That's kind of an interesting dichotomy and makes him a really succulent character to write for.\n\nShe says that the dynamic between the two isn't as simplistic as one might think, and that the Queen maintains a constant presence, even when she's not in a panel. \"No matter what, her personality shines forth. Even if she's barely in a scene, you're going to notice her.\"\n\nThe adventure also involves other characters familiar to the show's fans, Thomsen says, including Snow, who's living as a bandit during this point in the timeline, as well as Red Riding Hood. Plus, he promises a few new faces, too.\n\nAnd in terms of the overall plot, \"I was able to go wild and not have to deal with the repercussions of ordering up millions of dollars' worth of visual effects and locations we don't have,\" says the co-producer.\n\nThe most difficult part thus far for Bechko has been capturing the show's distinct tone in her writing, but watching episodes has been key for finding the Huntsman and Queen's voices.\n\n\"You can imagine what they're saying actually coming out of that character,\" Bechko says. \"It's very helpful and a lot of fun, too, if you understand who the character is ahead of time and then get to play with that a little.\"\n\nWorking on Star Wars Legacy and Planet of the Apes with artist Gabriel Hardman has taught her how important matching a property's authenticity really is in comics, especially on something like Once Upon a Time with a fervent fan base.\n\n\"People have such deep love and expectations for Star Wars, and you have to really try to get that tone right,\" she says. \"If they're coming to a property that already has a following, they want to recapture that tone because that's what they love about it.\"\n\nThomsen looked at an array of writers to work on the project, and Bechko jumped out for him due to her dark graphic novel Heathentown.\n\n\"I really liked how being able to incorporate (the horror) genre into small town reminded me a lot of what we do in Storybrooke,\" Thomsen says.\n\n\"And she's a huge animal lover, and the Huntsman's backstory was he was raised by wolves and has a particular sensitivity to nature. It seemed like a perfect fit.\"\n\nThere is a corporate synergy with the project for sure, since ABC and Marvel are both owned by Disney. However, Once Upon a Time has had a connection with comics before — young Henry Mills (Jared Gilmore) has been spotted reading Marvel books in episodes — and Thomsen feels there's a definite fit between fan communities.\n\n\"At its core, much of the first season – and the entire series, too – is about literature in many different forms, and one of the things I've loved about the show is exploring the storybook that Henry has,\" he says.\n\n\"This property is rife for exploring in different mediums like this and crossing over.\""
