        "text": "One of the most daunting things about fantasy literature is its scale. Fantasy authors find it difficult to conceive of a story that runs for a single volume — and a novel-length one, at that — as opposed to their usual penchant for churning out multi-entry 1000-page brick tomes.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they never attempt to do it. In fact, if you’re not on the hunt for lengthy series that stretch several installments and require a long-term commitment, there are practically dozens of standalone books that can serve as a gateway into these imaginative worlds.\n\n15. The Midnight Library by Matt Haig\n\nTelling the tale of a 35-year-old woman named Nora who finds herself in the Midnight Library, this book by Matt Haig is about reflection and second chances. Nora feels like her whole life has been a string of missed opportunities and regrets, but when she unexpectedly wakes up in the mysterious library, she learns that the books therein are a window to parallel worlds where she can change the past.\n\n14. Witch King by Martha Wells\n\nThe first fantasy novel by Martha Wells after the huge success of her Murderbot Diaries series, Witch King tells the tale of a demon named Kai who gets resurrected centuries after his death to find the world a different place. But why was Kai killed and imprisoned in the first place? Wells’ deft prose, combined with her amazing storytelling chops, has turned Witch King into a sensational new debut for the community.\n\n13. American Gods by Neil Gaiman\n\nOne of the most beloved works by Neil Gaiman, American Gods is a blend of different mythologies and folklore both from ancient times and the modern day. These strands of myth ultimately revolve around a character named Shadow, whose wife, Laura, mysteriously dies at the start of the story. American Gods is a must-read for Gaiman fans, but even beyond that, the book has achieved cult status due to its many clever allusions to different mythological tales from around the world.\n\n12. Babel, or the Necessity of Violence by R.F. Kuang\n\nR. F. Kuang wrote one of the most acclaimed fantasy series in recent memory, The Poppy War, but she is not done by a long stretch. Babel, or the Necessity of Violence is set in an alternate reality in the 19th century, depicting a world where Britain’s global supremacy is upheld through the use of magic. Oxford University has created an institute named Babel, where translators harness the power of meanings that are “lost in translation” to fuel the empire’s power. Babel, or the Necessity of Violence is a brilliant study of human nature and its grim history.\n\n11. The Stand by Stephen King\n\nWhile Stephen King is not necessarily known for his contributions to fantasy, his book The Stand remains one of the best standalone novels the genre has to offer. The Stand takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a pandemic of influenza has destroyed civilization. The remaining humans band together in different factions, each a personification of either good or evil, and clash in a seemingly endless conflict.\n\n10. Circe by Madeline Miller\n\nWritten by Madeline Miller and published in 2018, Circe is a retelling of Greek mythos, especially The Odyssey, from the perspective of the witch Circe. This child of gods is not destined for greatness but finds her own power by turning to the world of mortals and discovering her talent for witchcraft. The gods of Mount Olympus won’t leave things be, however, and so Circe is swept into a domain of intrigue and danger as she fights for her survival as well as the fate of the world.\n\n9. Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik\n\nSpinning Silver is one of the most unique fantasy books out there. Taking place in a fictional eastern European kingdom called Lithvas, the story follows several heroines as they fight against evil forces. At the center of this story is Miryem, the daughter of a poor Jewish moneylender who inherits his father’s business and attracts the attention of a mysterious king. Miryem is joined by Wanda and Irina, a peasant girl and the daughter of a duke, respectively, who have to fight their own battles and overcome their own challenges in this unique, Slavic-inspired fantasy world.\n\n8. Good Omens by Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett\n\nWhat if characters and figures from the Bible could conceivably be among us even today? Good Omens is a classic of fantasy literature, telling the tale of Aziraphale, an angel, and Crowley, a fallen demon, who form an unlikely friendship amidst an enmity that stretches onto eternity. The end of the world is at hand, and it all hangs on the whims of an 11-year-old boy who has been chosen as the Antichrist to bring about the apocalypse… but not if Aziraphale and Crowley have anything to say about it. Good Omens has also been adapted to live-action by Gaiman for Prime Video with an acclaimed series spearheaded by David Tennant and Michael Sheen.\n\n7. The Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang\n\nWhat fantasy always distinctively lacks is more diversity. Conventionally, fantasy worlds are based on a model of medieval Europe, not even daring to push the envelope beyond the conceived setting of some of the most popular works. Well, The Sword of Kaigen finally breaks away from that tradition by visiting the Far East. The story follows Mamoru, a young warrior, and her mother, Misaki, a former warrior herself, who have to traverse the treacherous pitfalls of destiny and kindle their warrior’s spirit to defend their homeland against an impending invasion.\n\n6. One Thousand and One Nights by Richard Francis Burton\n\nAlso known as Arabian Nights, this is a collection of Middle Eastern folktales collected across centuries and set mostly during the Islamic Golden Age. While the mythos and their underlying themes are enough to warrant this anthology a place on this list, it’s worth noting that One Thousand and One Nights is an important work of literature even beyond the bounds of the speculative landscape. If you’re looking for an exotic fantasy anthology peppered with real-world history, then you should definitely give Arabian Nights a read.\n\n5. Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson\n\nThis book was released as part of Brandon Sanderson’s record-breaking Secret Projects initiative, and though it’s technically a part of the author’s larger Cosmere universe, you don’t have to know anything about those other books and their stories to be able to enjoy Tress of the Emerald Sea. Tress lives on an isolated island in relative peace, but things take an unexpected turn when her love interest is taken by an evil sorceress, compelling her to set out on a daring rescue mission.\n\n4. The Princess Bride by William Goldman\n\nThere are great stories, and then there are great stories. William Goldman’s The Princess Bride is among the archetypal tales that have fashioned pop culture, the entertainment industry, and even many other contemporary authors. You could opt to watch 1987’s cult movie adaptation, too, but the book is a more comprehensive and enjoyable take on Westley and Buttercup’s timeless adventure. The Princess Bride is the book you read when you’re craving a swashbuckler but don’t want to necessarily approach some of the classics in European literature.\n\n3. Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay is one of the most underrated and unsung authors in Epic Fantasy. Taking huge inspiration from J.R.R. Tolkien and even working with his son Christopher on The Silmarillion, Gavriel Kay began his career with The Fionavar Tapestry, which is a well-received series in its own right. His earlier novels certainly showed the community a hint of the genius that could blossom into a masterwork, but it wasn’t until Tigana that that masterwork became manifest. Taking place in a world beset by the cruelties of a sinister king, a band of rebel heroes emerge to not only supplant this tyrannical regime but also learn the truth about their forgotten and erased history.\n\n2. The Once & Future King by T.H. White\n\nAlmost the entire Epic Fantasy genre traces its mythos to the Arthurian Legend and the Matter of Britain. Yet finding a source to read those stories in compelling form could be tricky. You could approach Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae or Sir Thomas Malory’s Morte d’Arthur, but if you’re looking for a more modern adaptation and prose, you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone better than T.H. White or any book more comprehensive than The Once & Future King. Read the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table in full through this timeless book, now itself considered a source of reference for the study of the Arthurian Romance.\n\n1. The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle"
