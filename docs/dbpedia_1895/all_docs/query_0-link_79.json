        "text": "Ooh, you want to know how to write an adventure story!\n\nYou want to write the kind of tale that gets their hearts poundingâa novel that keeps readers up until the wee hours, whispering, âJust one more chapter,â until their eyes dry out.\n\nI donât blame you. Adventure is fun. And if youâre up for taking on the challenges that come with writing this genre, I think youâll find that writing adventure is every bit as fun as reading it.\n\nSo what are those challenges? How do you conquer them?\n\nYouâre about to find out. Iâll take you through the steps for how to write an adventure story one by one. Youâll learn how to create great characters, how to think about the structure and pacing of an adventure, and how to keep readers on the edge of their seats.\n\nYouâll also find that writing this genre isnât wildly different from writing any other genre. Itâs just a matter of learning how to draw out the thrills and perils of the unknown.\n\nReady to answer the Call of Adventure? Letâs start with the most important step.\n\nRead Adventure Stories\n\nIf youâve been hanging around DabbleU, youâve probably heard this before:\n\nâWriting great books begins with reading great books. Especially books in your chosen genre.\n\nI always suggest prioritizing:\n\nCurrent bestsellers to learn what todayâs readers look for in an adventure story\n\nEnduring classics to get familiar with the tropes that have stood the test of time\n\nA few adventure novels that simply intrigue you, just so you donât lose your artistic enthusiasm as you analyze successful books to see âwhat sellsâ\n\nAs you read, note the moments that get your heart pounding. Ask yourself what the author did to manipulate you so effectively. Also notice how each book tackles everything else covered in this article.\n\nSelect a Structure Designed for Adventure\n\nIf this isnât the first time youâve sought advice on how to write an adventure story, youâve probably already heard about the Heroâs Journey. This story structure is the go-to in the adventure genre.\n\nAs one of the more detailed structures, the Heroâs Journey outlines your protagonistâs action-packed odyssey from reluctant adventurer to, well, hero.\n\nYou can learn more about the Heroâs Journey here or check out this article to explore other great story structures. The Fichtean Curve is also ripe for adventure, as is Dan Harmonâs Story Circle (basically a less-detailed version of the Heroâs Journey).\n\nChoose an Intriguing Setting\n\nIn adventure stories, setting is everything. You want to put your protagonist in a world that is:\n\nEndlessly fascinating\n\nUnfamiliar to them\n\nInherently packed with threats and obstacles this character has never had to navigate before\n\nAlso look for ways to continually change the setting. You could do that by making the entire plot a journey across continents and over changing landscapes.\n\nOr you could make sure your plot ushers the protagonist through the abandoned factories, bustling marketplace, overgrown forest, and underground lairs of a single geographic location.\n\nIf you need help building a fictional world for your adventure story, this article has your back.\n\nOne word of warning in all this: as you take your protagonist through unfamiliar settings, be careful about stereotyping.\n\nAsk yourself things like:\n\nAm I using the language, accent, food, traditions, or appearance of an existing culture to create a sense of danger? (The answer should be no.)\n\nHave I researched this setting and sought a local perspective of it, or am I drawing inspiration from stereotypes and pop culture references?\n\nHave I created a fictional race thatâs 1) homogenous and 2) resembles a real-world ethnic group? (You want to avoid this.)\n\nHow do I present the locals in this story? Do I rely on a lot of race or culture-centered descriptions to make them seem more dangerous, exotic, or magical?\n\nYour adventurer can be at odds with unforgiving landscapes, terrifying technology, corrupt systems, and villains who do bad things for their own individual reasons. If you find yourself positioning an entire culture as a threat to your protagonist, scrap the plan and start again.\n\nIntroduce an Adventurer\n\nEvery adventure story needs a fascinating protagonist. You want to create a well-rounded human beingâsomeone with strengths and flaws, dreams and fears.\n\nTheir adventure should be riddled with obstacles that would terrify anyone, as well as challenges that hit on their own insecurities and weaknesses. So make sure you give them a good internal conflict to heighten their external conflict.\n\nYou probably want to set your protagonist up with a transformational arc, too. While some adventurers are heroic from page one, most earn that impressive status because of their quest.\n\nThatâs part of the charm of the genreâwatching a common person find the champion within.\n\nIf you could use help crafting your protagonist, I highly recommend checking out these articles:\n\n14 Common Character Archetypes You Should Know\n\nThe Best Character Template Ever\n\nThe Character Development Worksheet Youâve Been Looking For\n\nEstablish a Captivating Quest\n\nEvery protagonist is on some kind of mission. But weâre talking about how to write an adventure story here, which means your protagonistâs mission should include:\n\nExtraordinary circumstances\n\nThe threat of physical danger\n\nA ton of action\n\nDestroying the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom is a great adventure quest. (And Iâm sure Tolkien would be relieved to know he has my approval.)\n\nA rich guy trying to get his old girlfriend back by impressing her with nice shirts and pretty lies might make for great literature. But itâs not exactly an adventurous quest.\n\nCreate an Unforgettable Sidekick\n\nA sidekick can make your protagonistâs adventure more exciting, more meaningful, and even sometimes more difficult. If you think of your favorite adventure stories, odds are good that a sidekick was involved.\n\nIn fact, characters like Samwise Gamgee (The Lord of the Rings), Ford Prefect (The Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy), and Short Round (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) can often become our favorite part of the story.\n\nSo whoâs your protagonistâs right-hand person? And what do they add to the story?\n\nIs the sidekick good-natured and loyal? Reckless and self-centered? Are they the angel on your protagonistâs shoulder? Or are they the devil? How did they get roped into this adventure? Do they have their own character arc?\n\nClearly, thereâs a lot to think through here. This article can help you flesh out a sidekick your readers will remember forever.\n\nCreate a Multi-Dimensional Villain\n\nYou knew no guide to how to write an adventure story would be complete without mentioning the villain.\n\nYour protagonistâs foe does so much more than create conflict (though thatâs already a pretty important job).\n\nDone well, this character can also show your reader who your hero(ine) is. The villain can force the protagonist to face their greatest weaknesses or deepest fears. They can create dangers your main character can only overcome by conquering their flaws and growing as a person.\n\nA great villain can even reflect the hidden darkness within the protagonist.\n\nBut to accomplish any of these, youâve got to give some thought to who your baddie is, how they came to be so terrifying, what they want, and what motivates them. In other words, they need a deeper personality than just âevil.â\n\nâThese tips will help you get started on creating a villain that keeps your protagonistâand readersâon their toes.\n\nShake Things Up With the Inciting Incident\n\nIn the Heroâs Journey, the inciting incident is known as the âCall of Adventure.â Thatâs a great way for an adventure novelist to think about it. This beat doesnât just kick off the story. Itâs adventure itself beckoning the protagonist, tempting them to take a daring step into a bold new world.\n\nA wizard shows up at Bilboâs door with a bunch of dwarves and a literal invitation to adventure.\n\nThe U.S. government asks Indiana Jones to please find the Ark of the Covenant before it lands in the hands of Nazis.\n\nAfter battling MâBaku, TâChalla becomes king of Wakanda.\n\nWhen adventure calls, it asks your protagonist to abandon everything familiar and charge into the unknown, often with a target on their back.\n\nTo really raise the stakes and drive home the danger, create an inciting incident that forces your main character to make a decision they canât unmake. Shove them across a point of no return, like Katniss volunteering for The Hunger Games.\n\nSet the Clock\n\nItâs true in life and itâs true in fiction: nothing induces rapid heartbeats and sweaty palms like a looming deadline.\n\nThatâs why a ticking clock is one of your most powerful tools as an adventure writer.\n\nMake sure your reader knows how much time your adventurer has to reach a goal or escape a situation. And make sure they know what will happen to their hero(ine) if they fail.\n\nIndy has to get to the Ark before the Nazis do. Katniss has to kill before sheâs killed. MacGyver has thirty seconds to disarm the bomb before this whole place blows.\n\nYou can (and probably should) apply the ticking clock to your protagonistâs quest. But donât forget that this tool can also be used to add tension to individual scenes.\n\nThey have to escape the car thatâs rapidly filling with water. They have to learn how to operate a wand before the big battle. You get the idea.\n\nRaise the Stakes\n\nThis is everything when it comes to writing adventure stories. Itâs essential for any story, really, but you especially donât want to skimp on heightened tension when it comes to adventure. Your readers chose your book trusting it would continuously stress them out.\n\nAnd to keep them stressed, you have to make the quest increasingly dangerous for the adventurer.\n\nIntroduce new antagonists. Stir up a storm or some other natural disaster. Break your hero(ine)âs bow or sword or ankle. Let the villain take a hostage.\n\nMake the danger greater and the potential consequences more horrifying than they were when your protagonist first pranced across that point of no return.\n\nKeep it Moving\n\nWhen you write an adventure story, you want to avoid lengthy inner monologues, introspection, and long flashbacks that dig into your protagonistâs psyche.\n\nThatâs not to say your characters shouldnât have an inner life. They absolutely should! Your protagonistâs background, inner conflict, and emotional baggage are key for building tension.\n\nBut as an adventure writer, your first priority is action. Let your charactersâ inner lives come through in dialogue, fight scenes, and big decisions. Go ahead and reveal their thoughts from time to time, but drop it artfully into scenes where theyâre actually doing something.\n\nComplete the Transformation\n\nFinally, when you wrap up your great adventure story, donât forget to show your readers how the protagonist has changed. How has their quest forced them to grow into someone as extraordinary as the situation they just survived?\n\nYou might start by asking yourself what you think it means to be a hero. Are heroic people exceptionally brave? Calm and cool-headed? Driven by integrity or compassion? Willing to ask for help? Good at swordplay?\n\nHow could your definition of heroism inspire your adventurerâs arc? What would it look like for them to discover and adopt the qualities that make them exceptional?\n\nFor more help creating a character arc, I recommend checking out these articles:\n\nCreating Character Arcs: Torment Your Hero in Eight Steps\n\nA Whole Bunch of Character Arc Ideas for Your Story\n\nA Character Arc Template for Crafting Riveting Transformations\n\nHow to Write an Adventure Story With Dabble\n\nWriting an adventure story isnât that different from writing any other kind of story.
