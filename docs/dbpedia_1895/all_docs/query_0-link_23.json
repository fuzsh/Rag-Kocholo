        "text": "Experience this classic tale like never before—as fun, adventure and excitement unfold all around you.\n\nThe Enchanted Storybook summons you. The Magic Mirror welcomes you. Now step inside Snow White’s world of fantasy to become part of a story others have only seen or read.\n\nMarvel as a magical forest seems to grow around you. Talk and interact with animated creatures and help them tidy the Seven Dwarfs’ cottage. Wave goodbye as the Dwarfs head off to work. Confront the Evil Queen as she plots her wicked scheme.\n\nWhile the action of the story plays out, you become part of the fun, villainy and romance. And when this exciting tale finally ends “happily ever after,” it’s sure to live on as an experience you’ll never forget!\n\nIn the place where Disney Princesses celebrate their stories, be part of a fairy tale come to life! Come see why the one-of-a-kind magic of Enchanted Storybook Castle makes it the perfect setting for “Once Upon a Time” Adventure.\n\nWithin its confines, make your way past the incredible mosaics in the Grand Rotunda and beneath a dazzling chandelier in the vaulted Great Hall. Overhead, our storybook Princesses are represented with regal banners.\n\nThen, enter the chamber where the Enchanted Storybook summons you to be part of Snow White’s adventure. A trail of pixie dust leads you up a spiral staircase to a great room lined with columns.\n\nHere, you’ll find the Magic Mirror. Call upon the spirit of the Mirror, and it will beckon you inside—through a portal to the fairy-tale world.\n\nInteracting with the characters and story of a legendary tale? It’s magic that could only become real inside Enchanted Storybook Castle.\n\nThe original Disney Princess premiered in Walt Disney’s Animated Classic, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nAs innovative as it was imaginative, Snow White wasn’t just Walt Disney’s first full-length animated feature film; it was the first film of its kind ever made! Premiering in 1937, it went on to become one of the most successful cinematic releases of all time, both theatrically and on home video too.\n\nIn 1955, Disneyland Park in California first opened its gates, and prominently featured the original Disney Princess and her Dwarf friends in the attraction “Snow White and Her Adventures.” Since then, the film has inspired experiences at Disney theme parks all across the planet—a tradition that continues at Shanghai Disneyland to this very day!"
