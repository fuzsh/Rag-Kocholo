A Game Of Thrones by George RR Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2012 (A Dance With Dragons), 1997 (A Game of Thrones) | British Fantasy Award Nominee: 2012 (A Dance With Dragons), 2006 (A Feast for Crows) |\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire is the history lesson you wish you’d had in school. An immense, incredible work of epic fantasy written by a hugely talented author who has created an effortless, enchanting read that is rich, rewarding and completely enthralling.\n\nPublished: 1996\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n2. The Colour Of Magic by Terry Pratchett (The Discworld Series)\n\nCarnegie Medal Winner: 2002 (The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents)\n\nIn his Discworld Series, Terry Pratchett, one of Britain’s best and funniest authors created a true delight of modern fiction. Satirical, clever and hilarious the forty-one books that make up the series are a pure and fantastic joy.\n\nPublished: 1983\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n3. The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien\n\nInternational Fantasy Award Winner: 1957\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is unquestionably one of the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century. J. R. R. Tolkien’s epic, written using a beautifully descriptive narrative, tells an enchanting tale of friendship, love and heroism. Steeped in magic and otherworldliness, this sweeping fantasy is beautiful, perfect and also timeless. A must read for every fantasy fan.\n\nPublished: 1954\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n4. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2005 | British Fantasy Award Nominee: 2005 |\n\nJonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is a genuinely original story, beautifully told. The Telegraph succinctly says it all with 'an elegant and witty historical fantasy which deserves to be judged on its own (considerable) merit'. It is unquestionably one of the finest historical fantasy books ever written.\n\nPublished: 2004\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n5. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (The Kingkiller Chronicle)\n\nDavid Gemmell Award for Fantasy Winner: 2012 (The Wise Man’s Fear)\n\nThe Name of the Wind and Wise Man’s Fear are the very finest examples of first-person storytelling. It’s comparable to sitting across from someone, in a comfy chair, before a log fire, listening to them recount one of the most intricate and fascinating stories you’ve ever heard. To quote Ursula Le Guin: “It is a rare and great pleasure to find a fantasist writing... with true music in the words”.\n\nPublished: 2007\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n6. The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch (The Gentleman Bastard Sequence)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2007 | British Fantasy Award Nominee: 2007 |\n\nScott Lynch’s trilogy features wonderful characters, plot and camaraderie, all set within a setting beautifully inspired by ancient Venice. It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, often shocking but ultimately – and frequently - heart-warming. If you are looking for fantasy novels with relatable thieves and rogues then the Gentlemen Bastards are perfect for you.\n\nPublished: 2006\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n7. American Gods by Neil Gaiman\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2002 | British Fantasy Award Nominee: 2002 |\n\nAmerican Gods manages to broach several genre barriers all the while making it look as if Gaiman was creating his own genre. The end result is very much like creating a new species of rose; you take those qualities from other roses that you want, and then splice them all together. The outcome is beautiful.\n\nPublished: 2001\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n8. The Fifth Season by NK Jemisin (The Broken Earth)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2017 (The Obelisk Gate), 2016 (The Fifth Season) |\n\nReading the Broken Earth trilogy can be a brutal, painful experience. There is much tragedy, despair and the characters’ futures often look nothing but bleak. But these ambitious, heartbreaking books mark a new stage in the evolution of the fantasy genre and their complexity, world-building and themes break new ground.\n\nPublished: 2015\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n9. The Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin (Earthsea Saga)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2002 (The Other Wind) |\n\nThe Earthsea books can be read by children and enjoyed simply for the magic, wizards, adventure and beautifully imagined world. They can also be read by adults and enjoyed for the thought-provoking ideas and themes that the books conjure. They are truly timeless, exploring human behaviour without being preaching or judgmental, encouraging readers to think deeply and form their own opinions. To quote a reader review: “The wisdom and the quiet ancient beauty of these books grow every time I reread them.”\n\nPublished: 1993\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n10. Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb (The Farseer Trilogy)\n\nBritish Fantasy Award Nominee: 1997 |\n\nThe Realm of the Elderlings is a glorious, classic fantasy combining the magic of Le Guin's The Wizard of Earthsea with the epic mastery of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is a master class of characterisation, imbued with the richest of narratives, all combining to produce one of the very finest fantasy series ever written.\n\nPublished: 1995\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n11. Gardens Of The Moon by Steven Erikson (A Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2000 (Gardens of the Moon) |\n\nThe ten novels that make up A Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen are works of great skill, imagination, ambition, depth and beauty. But not for the faint-of-heart, Erikson throws you in at the deep end and encourages you to swim. This series is one of the greatest fantasy literature achievements of the past one hundred years.\n\nPublished: 1999\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n12. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (His Dark Materials)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2001 (The Amber Spyglass) |\n\nCarnegie Medal Winner: 1995 (Northern Lights)\n\nImagine a world that is as alike as it is dissimilar to our own. Where huge zeppelins litter the skyline and a person’s soul is a living breathing animal companion, or 'daemon'. This is the wonderfully engrossing world of Lyra Belacqua. Although written for children it is equally as absorbing for any adult reader, enthralling from its very first page.\n\nPublished: 1995\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n13. Perdido Street Station by China Mieville (New Crobuzon)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2005 (The Iron Council), 2003 (The Scar), 2001 (Perdido Street Station) | British Fantasy Award Winner: 2003 (The Scar), 2000 (Perdido Street Station) |\n\nPerdido Street Station is a work of art. At times horrific, beautiful, tragic, comic and even uplifting, with a plot which takes unexpected turns and twists and revelations, one of the most unique settings imaginable and above all a style of dark poetry that is truly exceptional.\n\nPublished: 2000\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n14. Lord Foul's Bane by Stephen Donaldson (Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2005 (The Runes of the Earth), The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever (1978) | British Fantasy Award Winner: 1979 (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever) | British Fantasy Award Nominee: 1981 (The Wounded Land) |\n\nThomas Covenant is arguably one of the most famous characters in fantasy, but not all who know it love it. Whether it is due to the Covenant character himself, or simply as a response to the series as a whole, readers find themselves divided in their opinions: Some love it, some hate it. But few dismiss it. The Chronicles are a very complex piece of work but at heart a good old-fashioned tale of epic fantasy deserving of being labelled classic.\n\nPublished: 1977\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n15. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by JK Rowling (Harry Potter)\n\nNestlé Smarties Book Prize Winner: 1999 (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), 1998 (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), 1997 (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone)\n\nThe seven Harry Potter books are very well-written and laugh-out-loud funny, and it makes for an intoxicating combination. The Philosopher’s Stone is where, for young Harry Potter, it all begins. The Potter books are infused with charm and wit and adored by readers of all ages, the wizarding world a wonderful place for any reader, of any age, to escape to.\n\nPublished: 1997\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n16. The Gunslinger by Stephen King (The Dark Tower series)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2005 (The Dark Tower) |\n\nMany who have read and enjoyed the Dark Tower series have found a companion for life. The journey for many has been one of years, if not decades. And many will have found within the series parallels to their own lives: It’s not always gone the way they would have liked, many parts were better than others (though upon re-read these conceptions can change). This is King’s magnum opus, he poured everything into its writing and it is a towering achievement.\n\nPublished: 1982\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n17. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson (The Stormlight Archive)\n\nWith The Stormlight Archive, Brandon Sanderson clearly stamps his authority as the master of the \"Hollywood\" style of epic fantasy. It is hard to comprehend just how much stuff is going on and how this book impacts the wider Cosmere (the universe that ties all of Sanderson's books together). Big action set pieces of extraordinary people doing extraordinary things is exactly what many want from their epic fantasy.\n\nPublished: 2010\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n18. The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe by CS Lewis (The Chronicles of Narnia)\n\nCarnegie Medal Winner: 1956 (The Last Battle)\n\nWith the Chronicles of Narnia, Lewis cemented himself as a master story teller and perfected writing novels that would survive the test of time and still entertain and educate children and adults everywhere to this day. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is arguably one of the finest stories in English literature from the 20th century.\n\nPublished: 1950\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n19. The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie (The First Law)\n\nThe First Law trilogy was a real game changer for the fantasy genre. It worked in shades of grey. It makes the reader like characters they should possibly, really dislike. And dislike characters they should possibly, really like. The dialogue is witty and often the cause of out-loud laughter. It’s a captivating read and has everything a fantasy fan could wish for. Any books that can add humour to torture scenes has something special going on.\n\nPublished: 2006\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n20. The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time)\n\nThe Wheel of Time is one of the most popular and influential fantasy epics ever written. It puts the epic into epic fantasy, a hugely ambitious undertaking that redefined a genre. This skillfully written fourteen book series is filled with unforgettable characters and set in a world steeped in rich history and legend.\n\nPublished: 1990\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n21. Good Omens by Terry Pratchett\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 1991 |\n\nGood Omens is one of the funniest works of fiction ever. Pratchett and Gaiman have managed to create a story that weaves together large doses of satire, cynicism, slapstick and wacky unconventional humour into a cohesive yet surprisingly accurate observation of human life all over the world. The characters, one of the biggest strengths in this book, bring a lot of charm and humour to the book. This collaboration between two fine fantasy authors is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nPublished: 1990\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n22. The Once And Future King by TH White\n\nOnce upon a time, a young boy called “Wart” was tutored by a magician named Merlyn in preparation for a future he couldn’t possibly imagine. A future in which he would ally himself with the greatest knights, love a legendary queen and unite a country dedicated to chivalrous values... The Once and Future King is a serious work, delightful and witty, yet very sombre overall. The volume published as The Once and Future King is actually four works separately composed over about 20 years.\n\nPublished: 1958\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n23. Under Heaven by Guy Gavriel Kay\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2011 |\n\nUnder Heaven, inspired by the Tang Dynasty of Ancient China, is as beautiful and enriching a novel as you could possibly wish for. Kay is an expert storyteller, his writing style strong and fluid, his exposition always necessary and worked seamlessly into the narrative. He has successfully re-imagined Ancient China in the same accessible and absorbing way that he previously achieved with medieval France, Ottoman Spain and Renaissance Italy.\n\nPublished: 2010\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n24. The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms by NK Jemisin (The Inheritance Trilogy)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2011 (The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms) |\n\nN.K. Jemisin has won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, Nebula Award for Best Novel, Audie Award for Science Fiction and the Crawford Award. Enough said. You want more? Okay, every now and again books comes out that deserves all the hype they get. N.K. Jemisin writes books that are at times smart, at times funny, and at times downright heartbreaking, all wrapped up in the the most original stories. This is a must for your bookshelf. This book is flat out 10 out of 10.\n\nPublished: 2010\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n25. The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn)\n\nIn his Mistborn series Brandon Sanderson has written one of the seminal fantasy stories of his generation. Compelling and flawlessly executed with exquisite skill, the enormous magnitude of the story being told showcases the breathtaking imagination at work here. Themes like religion and death are dealt with, power and helplessness, corruption and goodness. Weaved together like a master basket maker, this story lets you grow attached too, love, and lose, characters that you never thought would be lost.\n\nPublished: 2006\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n26. The Shadow of the Torturer by Gene Wolf (Book of the New Sun)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 1983 (The Sword of the Lictor), 1982 (The Claw of the Conciliator), 1981 (The Shadow of the Torturer) | British Fantasy Award Winner: 1983 (The Sword of the Lictor) |\n\nThe Book of the New Sun is a science fantasy classic that improves with every read. Too often overlooked, possibly due to being dense in allegory and symbolism, the joy of coming to understand Wolfe’s craft is part of the joy of reading it. The lead character Severan, is an unreliable narrator, and this adds another layer of complexity. If you’re a fan of both science fiction and fantasy, it is a must-read.\n\nPublished: 1980\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n27. Jade City by Fonda Lee (The Green Bone Saga)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2018 (Jade City) |\n\nEmotionally shocking moments, intricate and otherworldly fight scenes, and lots of loyalty, honour and tradition. Jade City is an epic, unique and often unforgiving gangster fantasy narrative intertwined with glimpses of hope and goodness. The haunting nature of the world is also mixed with betrayals and a huge death toll. Recommended.\n\nPublished: 2017\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n28. Magician by Raymond E Feist (Riftwar Saga)\n\nFeist's Magician is one of the best known and well read fantasy books; it is a powerful and memorable book that any reader who derives pleasure from reading epic fantasy should read being classic fantasy imbued with many elements of originality. The character development is excellent and the reading experience effortless. In 2003 Magician was voted the 89th most popular book of all time in the BBC's Big Read Top 100. I found the first read of this book to be one of those special moments when you are reading a book that has shaped the fantasy fantasy landscape as it now appears.\n\nPublished: 1982\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n29. Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 1991 |\n\nTigana is an immense achievement: an enchanting, complex, loving and deeply moving piece of writing about a people struggling to be free. A people so cursed by the dark sorceries of the tyrant King Brandin that even the very name of their once beautiful land cannot be spoken or remembered.\n\nPublished: 1990\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n30. The Last Unicorn by Peter S Beagle\n\nThe Last Unicorn is one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time. Its lyrical writing, it’s memorable and very human characters, and its exploration of mortality, immortality, and the meeting of the two never fail to move. The novel deals in a very deep and profound way with love, and loss, and the value of love; which in the case of the unicorn becomes important enough to surrender immortality to possess. There are also recurring themes of loss and grief, and the contemplation of the meaning and purpose of life (and death).\n\nPublished: 1968\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n31. Watership Down by Richard Adams\n\nWatership Down is a book which will always hold a special place in my heart. It has captivated and moved me for over three decades and I do not believe this will change for what I hope will be a further three. It has all the elements that I enjoy in a story: a quest, a journey, bravery, belief and the inability to accept defeat. The rabbit characters are glorious: the nervously intelligent Fiver and his kind, loyal brother Hazel. The no-nonsense Bigwig, the controlling Woundwort and the ingenious Blackberry - all rich and wonderful to spend time with.\n\nPublished: 1972\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n32. The Magicians by Lev Grossman (The Magicians series)\n\nThe fantasy genre always needs an author to come along a show it in a different light and this is exactly what has Grossman has done with The Magicians. He has injected sexual tension and questionable morals into a school for wizards and the result is a rousing, perceptive and multifaceted coming of age story. The Magicians is perfect fantasy for older teens that will find that the author understands them, and their feelings, possibly better than they themselves do.\n\nPublished: 2009\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n33. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll\n\nAlice in Wonderland was Lewis Carroll’s first novel and its fantasy plot, humorous rhymes and brilliant use of nonsense was revolutionary. Nineteenth-century children’s writing usually served moral or educational purpose, but Alice was written firmly and purely for the amusement of children. Critical response was lukewarm, but the book was still a great success, and remains a hugely influential classic of children’s literature.\n\nPublished: 1965\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n34. The Princess Bride by William Goldman\n\n\"One of the most laconic, tightly-plotted tales of mythical morality you'll ever read, an anti-establishment satire disguised as a love story, more of a scary tale than a fairy tale\" Uncut\n\n\"There's nothing fluffy about The Princess Bride. The rocket-powered narrative tricks you without being merely tricksy, and is both modern and timeless\" Neon\n\n\"A funny thriller for readers who are about ten years of age or wish they were ... Readers of a nervous disposition should be prepared to skim rapidly over the Zoo of Death episode or stick to fiction meant for grown-ups\" Spectator\n\nPublished: 1973\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n35. Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey (Kushiel's Legacy)\n\nWithin Jacqueline Carey’s Kushiel’s Legacy books we find a complex, refined work of fantasy. This skillfully written trilogy stars an unforgettable heroine who finds herself mixed up in a dangerous world of politics, magic and romance. The trilogy begins with Kushiel’s Dart, a tale that will enthrall readers of fantasy fiction.\n\nPublished: 2001\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n36. The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern\n\nYou have to ask yourself… Wouldn’t it be great to believe in magic? I found this book extraordinary, with so much thought put into the story which unfolds like a carefully constructed maze.\n\nPublished: 2011\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n37. Dune by Frank Herbert\n\nHugo Award Winner: 1966\n\nNebula Award Winner: 1966\n\nOne of the most layered works of fiction produced during the twentieth century. If you are a fan of epic fantasy or large-scale science fiction (and are not afraid to examine weighty issues such as religion and politics) Dune cannot be strongly recommend enough. Anyone who considers themselves a fan of this genre must read it at some point in their lives.\n\nPublished: 1965\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n38. Sailing to Sarantium by Guy Gavriel Kay (The Sarantine Mosaic)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2001 (Lord of Emperors), (1999) Sailing to Sarantium |\n\nThe Sarantine Mosaic and Lord of Emperors, inspired by ancient Byzantium, tell a magnificent, sweeping story of empire, conspiracies and journeys, both physical and spiritual. One of the very best examples of alternate history merged with fantasy.\n\nPublished: 2000\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n39. City of Stairs by Robert Jackson Bennett (The Divine Cities)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2015 (City of Stairs) |\n\nThe Divine Cities trilogy is quite unlike anything I’ve ever read before. It treats its audience with the same respect and consideration as it shares with its cast. It is a rich, lovingly-crafted world that is both thematically complex and wonderfully entertaining. Shara, Mulaghesh and Sigrud have all been ensconced in my personal Fictional Character Hall of Fame, and I will miss them dearly. If you’re looking to discover something new, something original, and something memorable, then this is the series you’re looking for.\n\nPublished: 2014\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n40. The Golem and the Djinni by Helene Wecker\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2014 |\n\nHelene Wecker writes elegantly and fluently, her characters are constantly fascinating and exploring their histories is a joy. The main setting and the narrative evoke wonderful images of nineteenth century New York and we, as the fortunate reader, get to experience Jewish and Arabic folklore fundamental to the book’s being. Many authors have written about a golem, many have written about a djinni, but few have brought them both together in a story so seamlessly. The Golem and the Djinni is first rate historical fantasy fiction that consistently delights; a charming love story with pleasing emotional depth.\n\nPublished: 2013\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n41. Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey (The Dragon Rider's Saga)\n\nIf you want to see how the Pern saga began, and indeed see how a young writer converted two Hugo winning novellas to form her first steps into a historical world of alien dragons, Dragonflight is for you. Wonderfully descriptive narrative, impressive world building and above all a great story.\n\nPublished: 1968\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n42. The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2015 |\n\nOne drowsy summer's day in 1984, teenage runaway Holly Sykes encounters a strange woman who offers a small kindness in exchange for 'asylum'. Decades will pass before Holly understands exactly what sort of asylum the woman was seeking....\n\nPublished: 2014\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n43. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien\n\nOne of the best known and best loved fantasy books, J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit introduced the reading world to the unforgettable hobbit Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard, and Smaug the dragon.

The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams (Memory Sorrow and Thorn)\n\nEpic, traditional fantasy of a high standard. At nearly 800 pages it is excellently paced and brings together all the elements that are found in many a fantasy book and re-produces them in a beautiful and endearing way.\n\nPublished: 1988\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n45. The Black Company by Glen Cook (Chronicles of the Black Company)\n\nThe Black Company by Glen Cook is the first book of the nine that make up The Black Company series. First published in 1984 this book was responsible for taking the fantasy genre and turning it on its head with his introduction of realistic characters and its complete disregard for fantasy stereotypes and the age-old battle of good versus evil.\n\nPublished: 1984\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n46. The Silmarillion by JRR Tolkien\n\nIf you've not read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings this may not be for you. But I honestly don't know, it's such a brilliant book, a book about creation really, that maybe it will work for you regardless. But if you have read Tolkien's masterpieces this is a must-read. If you are as captivated by them as most of the reading world is – the Silmarillion will give you the extra information you crave and answer the questions that the two prior books threw up – Who exactly are Gandalf and Sauron? How did the Orcs come into being? Why are the Elves leaving Middle-earth and where are they going?\n\nPublished: 1977\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n47. Titus Groan by Mervyn Peake (The Gormenghast Trilogy)\n\nDeliciously dark, Titus Groan is the first book of the Gormenghast trilogy. The book is written in the third person, which allows the characters and events unfold simultaneously. The land of Gormenghast is described in enough detail for you to realise that this is a land unlike any other.\n\nPublished: 1946\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n48. The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks (The Shannara Trilogy)\n\nLong ago, the world of the Four Lands was torn apart by the wars of ancient Evil. But in the Vale, the half-human, half-elfin Shea Ohmsford now lives in peace - until the mysterious, forbidding figure of the druid Allanon appears, to reveal that the supposedly long dead Warlock Lord lives again. Shea must embark upon the elemental quest to find the only weapon powerful enough to keep the creatures of darkness at bay: the fabled Sword of Shannara.\n\n\"And while I will agree that Brooks draws inspiration from Tolkien, he doesn't copy him. The reason I linger on this is to hopefully, impress upon you an open mind to reading this book. Do not cross this book off your “to read” list because you've heard people knock it. Similarly, do not go into reading this book attempting to cross reference everything back to some other work. This is a book that deserves being critiqued on its own merit.\"\n\nPublished: 0000\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n49. Circe by Madeline Miller\n\nA 10/10 book. Sean: ‘This is a beautiful book; it is flawless and intelligent. I do not have a single criticism for this fantastic piece of writing. I loved it! I could not recommend it more highly.

The Way of Shadows by Brent Weeks (The Night Angel Trilogy)\n\nAnother reader favourite, The Way of Shadows is one of the most entertaining fantasy books available, a rich, engrossing and creative novel. The action sequences are awesome and the plot and characterisation also. If you're looking for all of the above within the framework of a great story, look no further.\n\nPublished: 2009\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n51. Storm Front by Jim Butcher (The Dresden Files)\n\nTake your standard noir detective with a sarcastic frame of mind and a weakness for helping damsels in distress, add in wizardry, vampires, werewolves, talking skulls, pizza loving fairies and all things paranormal and this is what you get. A quirky, fast paced and thrilling ride through a Chicago you never thought possible. Great characters, a mystery that twists and turns like a corkscrew and above all, Harry, a wizard with a world weary sense of humour, who takes life on the chin.\n\nPublished: 2000\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n52. Rivers of London by Ben Aaronovitch (Rivers of London series)\n\nThere is something eminently satisfying about coming across a new author and finding that he is utterly brilliant. That is exactly what happened when I received Ben Aaronovitch’s book ‘Rivers of London’. You have to read this book. Whether you like good writing, good fantasy or urban fantasy, good characters, or simply a breath-taking story set in a breath-taking world, this book is for you. Because it is all of those things, and much much more. Aaronovitch has written a book that will surely become a favourite on many shelves the moment they’ve finished it at 3 in the morning.\n\nPublished: 2011\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n53. James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl\n\nWorld Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement: 1983\n\nWhen Dahl made up James and the Giant Peach as a bedtime story for his daughters Olivia and Tessa, little could he have know that half a century later millions of parents would have read exactly the same story to their own children; a book that fully deserves the accolade of children’s classic.\n\nPublished: 1961\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n54. Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence (Broken Empire)\n\nPrince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence was a book steeped in controversy - a book that seemed to have divided the Science Fiction and Fantasy community with regards to what is acceptable for people to like and enjoy. A confronting story, deliberately so, that follows a 13 year old boy named Jorg who leads a gang of marauders as they pillage their way across the countryside. Jorg is a sociopath, a willing participant, and readers get to experience the world through his damaged viewpoint. Readers get to see, through Jorg's eyes, the cold apathy with which he dispatches his enemies. It is discomforting. But Prince of Thorns is a fantastic tale of one boy’s fight for control in a world threatening to engulf him.\n\nPublished: 2011\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n55. Swan Song by Robert McCammon\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 1988 |\n\nI would give it a 12 out of 10 if I could. If you could only read one book about the apocalypse this should be it. I have read every post apocalypse book I could get my hands on, old ones, new ones, Kindle only ones. Nothing compares to Swan Song. The hardest part of reading Swan Song was the knowledge that there was no book to follow. But it didn't need one. Thank you Robert, it is the best book I ever read, and about every 5 years I pick it up ad read it again... (Reader review by Lisa from Canada)\n\nPublished: 1987\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n56. The Stand by Stephen King\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 1979 |\n\nIf you call yourself any kind of reader of speculative fiction and can appreciate a truly rich and complex book, The Stand is a must read. Even if you’ve never read Stephen King before, even if neither horror nor post-apocalyptic are your usual genre choice, you won’t be disappointed. The writing is excellent, the imagery horrifying and the atmosphere hypnotic. After the first few pages you will either find yourself hooked or repelled… it’s that kind of book. But if you want to read one of the greatest examples of dystopian fiction with a healthy dose of fantasy thrown in then look no further.\n\nPublished: 1978\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n57. The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2014 |\n\nRyan: An intimate trip down memory lane to a time when things were much more fantastical than what they are now. This a story that is simple on the surface, but with a depth of immersion that depends entirely on how much you connect with the story. My guess is that the further you are away from your childhood, be it through age or experience, the more you will connect with this story and the more you will fall in love with it.\n\nPublished: 2013\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n58. All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders\n\nAll the Birds in the Sky is an intense emotional roller-coaster that flits between genres, using both sci-fi and fantasy to get its message across and although it does pit them against each other, the novel never says one is better than the other, each has its place in this story and it is by both of these working together that the best outcome will be found. All the Birds in the Sky is also a very human story focusing on the confusion and mistrust that can come from not understanding the unknown.\n\nPublished: 2016\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n59.

In the storm drains and sewers \"It\" lurks, taking the shape of every nightmare, each one's deepest dread. As the children grow up and move away, the horror of \"It\" is buried deep - until they are called back.\n\n\"As an exploration of childhood, growing up, friendship and facing both real and supernatural fears I still hold It up as a great book. But the ending, and the book’s length in general, will be unpalatable to many readers.\"\n\nOne of the greatest storytellers of our time - The Guardian\n\nA writer of excellence...

The Ninth Rain by Jen Williams (The Winnowing Flame Trilogy)\n\nJen Williams “The Ninth Rain” is unlike anything I have ever read.

The Poppy War by R F Kuang (The Poppy War)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2019 |\n\nSimply put, R.F. Kuang’s The Poppy War is a towering achievement of modern fantasy. Kuang writes in a descriptive and narrative style that presents many sides of an issue without trying to persuade the reader into thinking which path is the “correct” one, if one such exists. As the book descends into its bleak final act, the connection we’ve built with Rin and her companions is put to the test. It is a testament to Kuang’s skill as a writer to establish such a strong connection with her protagonists that the impact of the events in third act hit as hard as they do.\n\nPublished: 2018\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n62. A Brightness Long Ago by Guy Gavriel Kay\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay’s A Brightness Long Ago is a masterpiece; perhaps the finest work of one of the world’s greatest living storytellers.

The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon\n\nThe “feminist successor to The Lord of the Rings” - Laura Eve. The Priory of the Orange Tree is a story told with grace and infused with rich history and lore in its gloriously huge scope: it is magnificent in every regard. It’s all about the girl power here! I recommend this to readers who enjoy female driven fantasy that is also carefully paced like the works of Robin Hobb, Tad Williams and Chris Wooding.\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n64. The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2020 |\n\nAnother 10/10 book and the most recently published book to appear on this list, published as it was in 2019. Ann Leckie first came to our attention with her highly-regarded science fiction books. When she turned her hand to fantasy she produced, in the words of the book's reviewer, Joshua: A magisterial tour de force of subverted narrative expectations that wrestles with what it means to find identity as a human, and as a god. Unlike anything being written, Ann Leckie will likely be remembered as a literary pioneer, and not as similar to someone else. A masterpiece of storytelling that leaves a willing reader humbled, The Raven Tower is quite simply the best book of the year – mighty, subtle, captivating, unputdownable.\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n65. The 10,000 Doors of January by Alix E Harrow\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2020 |\n\nIt is a rare thing to relate to a book’s character in such a way that similar situations evoke empathy across your lives. Enough parallels can be drawn to feel almost as if the book is catered specifically toward you in some existential way. I have not read much portal fantasy, but I have always felt a feeling of smothered repression through my youth that has tamped down my will to explore. Instead, my portals to elsewhere revealed themselves in books and stories at an early age, and they’ve been with me ever since. Alix Harrow captures this feeling of finding oneself through the stories we share in her stunning and unforgettable debut novel The 10,000 Doors of January. It is a beautifully written and lovingly crafted adventure about the strength of love, the importance of stories, and the timeless power of words.\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n66.

Extensive searches and police investigations find no trace and her family is forced to accept the unthinkable. Then on Christmas day Tara arrives at her parents' door, dishevelled, unapologetic and not looking a day older than when she left. It seems like a miracle and Tara's parents are delighted, but something about her story doesn't add up. When she claims that she was abducted by the fairies, her brother Peter starts to think she might have lost her sanity. But as Tara's tale unfolds, those who loved and missed her begin to wonder whether there is some truth to her account of the last two decades.\n\nPublished: 2012\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n68. Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir (The Locked Tomb Trilogy)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2020 (Gideon the Ninth) |\n\nThe Emperor needs necromancers.\n\nThe Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.\n\nGideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead nonsense.\n\nTamsyn Muir’s Gideon the Ninth unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as arcane revenants. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.\n\nBrought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won’t set her free without a service.\n\nHarrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon’s sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.\n\nOf course, some things are better left dead.\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n69. The Book Thief by Markus Zusak\n\nAlthough The Book Thief is set in such dark times, when almost unimaginable atrocities were being commited, it manages, by its end, to be an uplifting, life-affirming book due to the kindness, love and bravery of its many characters.\n\nPublished: 2005\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n70. The Forgotten Beasts of Eld by Patricia McKillip\n\nThe characterisation is excellent, creating well-formed, sympathetic and most importantly, realistic characters. The Forgotten Beasts of Eld is reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea masterpiece, the writing of this generation contains a magic that few modern authors have managed to successfully retain. This is a beautiful, thought-provoking book that will stay with the reader forever.\n\nPublished: 1974\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n71. Duncton Wood by William Horwood (The Duncton Chronicles)\n\nSome authors write beautifuly and can induce an almost meditive state in the reader. Tolkien, Hobb, Le Guin, Martin can achieve this, and so can William Horwood. There are two books on the site that generate an effusive outpouring of love from readers, two books which will be well know to some but perhaps not as widely known as many books on this list, they are Swan Song by Robert McCammon and Duncton Wood. It is the moving love story of Bracken and Rebecca and the trials they must face and overcome to be as one. It is unfortunate that this work must be compared to Watership Down but that is the only book with which I can really compare it to in terms of story-line and excellence. Read my review and the reader reviews below it if you want to get a real sense of how highly this book is regarded.\n\nPublished: 1980\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n72. Legend by David Gemmell (The Drenai Novels)\n\nDavid Gemmell is unquestionably one of my favourite fantasy authors. For the past 30 years his books have been read and re-read and I am still not weary of them, and I hope that will always be the case. I personally do not think that this is Gemmell's finest but it surely has to be his most important, as without it nothing may have followed. Legend is a great place to start if you have not read any of his work before and a great blend of sword, sorcery and heroism. A MUST read for any heroic fantasy fans.\n\nPublished: 1984\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n73. Wizard's First Rule by Terry Goodkind (The Sword of Truth Series)\n\nTerry Goodkind has created a consice, intelligent book that is believable from the start. This is fantasy that is definately aimed at the adult. It is evident that Terry Goodkind has strong political and social views that he is keen to get across in his books. Rather than finding this spoilt the narrative, I found it healthy reading a book that makes you think about what the author is trying to say. I found that Ursula Le Guin's works had the same effect on me.\n\nPublished: 1994\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n74. Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman\n\nIf you are a fan of trains, history, or London, then this book is definitely for you. Gaiman once again, just like he did in American Gods, shows an uncanny research ability, matched with his inimitable writing style. We are soon introduced to a mass of underground railway stations, and a group of people that, unbeknownst to London Above, are living rather content lives beneath their feet. A bit of mythology, a bit of fantasy, a bit of urban drama and a whole lot of London makes this book a definite must read.\n\nPublished: 1996\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n75.

But the real world cannot be denied forever and when the barrier between the two worlds begins to break down, Liga’s fiery daughter, Urdda, steps across it…\n\n\"Tender Morsels never once tries to show that life has a happily ever after ending. It shows that life is full of hardship; you will experience hurt, you will watch loved ones die and you will often be afraid. It also shows that live can be full of love, caring and kindness and that it is better to experience something, be it good or bad, than to experience nothing at all.\" Fantasy Book Review\n\nPublished: 2008\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n78. Palimpsest by Catherynne M Valente\n\nSei, November, Ludov, and Oleg -- four people unknown to each other but united by grief and their obsession with the city of Palimpsest. Located beyond the human realm, Palimpsest is accessible only by those who sleep after generating the energy which comes from sex. Once anyone arrives in the city, they indulge in sense pleasures and are able to obtain their innermost desires -- two things which ensure that Palimpsest visitors return.\n\n\"Like other Cathryn Valente books (Orphan's Tales, In the Garden of Coin and Spice), this poignant poetic work is a feast for the mind.

The book pulls you in, keeps pulling you, yanking you, in fact, but you never feel anything but a slight trace of a tug. So familiar is he with his world - the south shore of western Suffolk County (NY) in the late sixties - and so skilled is he at drawing you into it, that you scarcely notice the creepy, dark water leaking in under your mental door.\n\nPublished: 2008\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n80.

The Yiddish Policemen's Union by Michael Chabon\n\nThe leading man, one Meyer Landsman, is a festival of flaws and possibilities. The characters are alive, dynamically three-dimensional, and refreshingly complicated. Chabon’s world and its collapsing-star reality you completely buy. The analogs of human behaviour are poetic, tenderly ironic and brilliantly designed. Chess is key, but not in such a fashion that it bans the non-chess playing reader. And there is a seemingly self-perpetuating sense of devilish humour that had me choking every other page.\n\nPublished: 2007\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n82.

Anne Rice's compulsively readable novel is arguably the most celebrated work of vampire fiction since Bram Stoker's Dracula was published in 1897.

When Alif meets the aristocratic Intisar, he believes he has found love. But their relationship has no future - Intisar is promised to another man and her family's honour must be satisfied. As a remembrance, Intisar sends the heartbroken Alif a mysterious book. Entitled The Thousand and One Days, Alif discovers that this parting gift is a door to another world - a world from a very different time, when old magic was in the ascendant and the djinn walked amongst us. With the book in his hands, Alif finds himself drawing attention - far too much attention - from both men and djinn. Thus begins an adventure that takes him through the crumbling streets of a once-beautiful city, to uncover the long-forgotten mysteries of the Unseen. Alif is about to become a fugitive in both the corporeal and incorporeal worlds. And he is about to unleash a destructive power that will change everything and everyone - starting with Alif himself.\n\n\"I would highly recommend this book to anybody who like a ripping yarn, whether they are into fantasy or not because this is more of a thriller with echoes of the computer acrobatics seen in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, which I find really interesting, but set against an exotic landscape that really comes to life. You can feel and smell the duststorm as it sweeps over the houses, seeping its way in through the cracks, the panic as The Hand, an unbending, alien force, closes in, and the awkwardness of a young American scholar who tries to help Alif but is so clearly out of place.

Weaveworld by Clive Barker\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 1988 |\n\nWeaveworld is a true epic of a story – a whirlwind of base instincts and heights of imagination that brings together fantasy and horror, whilst grounding the fantastical in a recognisable, mundane, suburban England.\n\nPublished: 1987\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n93. A Darker Shade of Magic by VE Schwab (A Darker Shade of Magic)\n\nMost people only know one London; but what if there were several? Kell is one of the last Travelers - magicians with a rare ability to travel between parallel Londons. There’s Grey London, dirty and crowded and without magic, home to the mad king George III. There’s Red London, where life and magic are revered. Then, White London, ruled by whoever has murdered their way to the throne. But once upon a time, there was Black London...\n\n\"Like the best books I have read, V. E. Schwab has left me wanting to read more about these characters that have come alive in my mind.\"\n\nPublished: 0000\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n94. The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Nominee: 2015 |\n\nFrom the quietly sad story of a lonely young man out of his depth, to the equally quietly triumphant story of a hero who has accepted himself, learned to cope and promises to do a great deal of good for others, this is a story with magic, airships and elves set around a very ritualistic royal court. In some ways The Goblin Emperor is one of the most grittily hopeful books I’ve read for quite a significant while, and one I’d definitely agree deserves its accolade.\n\nPublished: 2014\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n95. The Sudden Appearance of Hope by Claire North\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2017 |\n\nThe Sudden Appearance of Hope is an excellent novel, one that looks at complex themes with much more depth before providing a biased social commentary. There is barely any escapism to be found here. This book will engage you with the prevalent social issues of today (mid-2016), making you pause and think about our pursuit of perfection as defined by Hollywood and the mainstream media.\n\nPublished: 2016\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n96. Blackwing by Ed McDonald (The Raven’s Mark)\n\nThis is quite a dark story full of gritty and macabre deaths aplenty with a good, but not an overwhelming amount of adrenaline fueling action. Certain sections are superbly intense though and this book is highly unpredictable. It features twists, betrayal, political disputes and half the time when I thought I had analysed where the story was going, I was then blindsided or completely shocked by a revelation. The publisher stated that this as being \"gritty epic fantasy for fans of Mark Lawrence and Scott Lynch\" and I cannot disagree.\n\nPublished: 2017\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n97. Foundryside by Robert Jackson Bennett (Founders)\n\nIt’s rare that a story catches me off guard with so many inventive and thrilling ideas, yet still only scratches the surface of the directions it could take. The potential here is so vast; I see these ideas as prime material to turn into its own RPG world, or spinoff novels, or fill-in-the-blank. Great writing, characters of substance, and thoughtful exploration of original ideas elevates Foundryside into rare territory.\n\nPublished: 2018\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n98. The Chimes by Anna Smaill\n\nWorld Fantasy Award Winner: 2016 |\n\nThe Chimes is one of the most difficult, and yet most rewarding books I’ve read for quite some time. Breaking so many rules of writing to explore its central premise, yet blending together dark poetry, a truly unique post-apocalyptic world, love, music and memory into one great symphonic whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts, and an experience which you won’t easily forget.\n\nPublished: 2015\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n99. The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter (The Burning)\n\nThe Rage of Dragons explodes at a breakneck pace. Complex characters, dragons, revenge, ALL THE STABBY-STABBY-STAB-STAB. I adored everything about this book! The cover, the chapter titles, the maps, the wee dragon on the spine, the notes from Winter at the back.,. it was just phenomenal. Truly. What a brilliant debut!\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n100. Middlegame by Seanan McGuire\n\nAlternate timelines, manifestations, Hands of Glory, alchemy, Doctrine of Ethos and immortality and and and GODDAMN. McGuire provides a clinic in storytelling with Middlegame. This is her magnum opus (so far!) It’s magical... truly magical. I could not love it more!!!\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nBuy on Amazon"
