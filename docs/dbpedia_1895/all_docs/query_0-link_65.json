        "text": "Probably to no one’s surprise reading this site, one of my favorite current television shows is the ABC fantasy series Once Upon a Time.\n\nAnd not just because Sebastian Stan was (if only briefly, prior to his Marvel role) one of the best Mad Hatters ever! I actually wasn’t that big a fan of spinoff series Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, however – although I was happy that its best character, the Knave, appeared recently on the flagship series, and I hope he returns with a good storyline.\n\nWhat I really like is how Once manages to incorporate both Disney fairy tales and other classic stories yet twist them a bit into entirely new adventures. (Last season of course, it synergetically utilized Frozen’s Anna, Elsa, Kristoff and even Sven in its storyline!)\n\nPlus, it has two of the greatest (villain? hero?) characters on television in Rumplestiltskin and Regina!\n\nBut what some folks may not realize is that Once Upon a Time has a presence at both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts!\n\nIn Hollywood Land in Disney California Adventure, there has regularly been a window next to the Off the Page store filled with different costumes and props from the show.\n\nAnd recently, its East Coast cousin park, Disney’s Hollywood Studios, added a facade to their Streets of America area modeled after Rumplestiltskin’s shop with its sign and display for “Mr. Gold Pawnbroker & Antiquities Dealer”. Behind the window here you’ll spot various items inspired by the stories and characters from the show. Sadly, you cannot actually enter and shop here – but wouldn’t that be awesome if you could?\n\nCurrently Mr. Gold’s “shop” is overlaid with decorations for the final season of The Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights.\n\nIt’s so nice to see such a very Disney TV show given attention in both Resorts!"
