        "text": "I believe there are far more possibilities than happily ever after or a tragedy. Every story has the potential for infinite endings — Stephanie Garber\n\nStephanie Garber, who had previously captured readers’ interest with her first published book series, Caraval, successfully delivered a romantic fantasy book that got great praise from both fans and critics. Like the Caraval series, Once Upon a Broken Heart was also successful in collecting many prestigious awards, which encouraged Stephanie to release more books as her popularity skyrocketed thanks to her books. Both books contributed to her being the #1 Sunday Best-selling author.\n\nWhat the book is about?\n\nOnce Upon a Broken Heart tells the story of Evangeline Fox, an unfortunate woman who believed in true love, fairy tales, and happily ever after. But Alas, the man she thought was her true love, Luc Navarro, left her to marry her step-sister, Marisol Tourmaline, which destroyed her dream of having a happily ever after life. However, Evangeline believes Luc has been cursed and manipulated into marrying Marisol. Desperate in searching for a solution, she looks for the door to the Prince of Hearts, which is said to be lost due to magic.\n\nGrew up with her father, who always spoke of magic, and her mother, who came from the magnificent north that believed fairytales were a part of history, leads her to believe the rumor about the missing door of Prince of Heart’s church is true and the fact that it is the Prince of hearts is her only hope to stop Luc and Marisol’s marriage.\n\nDesperate for help, she will grant anything he wants in exchange for his help, in which he asks for three kisses. Little did she know, the Prince of Heart wants more than she’s pledged. He has plans for Evangeline that will either end in the greatest happily ever after or the most exquisite tragedy.\n\nMy review, Beware of spoiler!\n\nYou know what to expect, yes I am absolutely in love with the book! I’m originally not into fantasy books much, even if they include romance, which I like it to be. I tend to feel overwhelmed with the world that fantasy books have. y’know, with the names, with the maps, it felt too complicated for me to memorize all of it. I didn’t even read Harry Potter for the same exact reason, despite how intriguing its narrative is after I watched the movie.\n\nBut After seeing it trending on TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) with readers promising an enchanting love story convincing me much, I decided to purchase the book. And WOW! This book made it a lot easier for me to enjoy, the world building is vast but I felt it was easy to understand as I read it chapter by chapter. As simple as I said it to be, Stephanie still manages to make a detailed magical world without making it too hard for the reader to comprehend. The narrative was so exciting and engaging that I couldn’t turn away from the book and blink.\n\nThe book really intrigued me, making me feel a whole emotional rollercoaster throughout the chapters. I laughed, gasped, giggling and kicking my feet, everything! I can’t tell you how much I love Stephanie Garber for this masterpiece, how could she write this book so beautifully that it made me feel things.\n\nOne thing you should know about Stephanie Garber is her writing techniques that kept readers mesmerized in her book. Once Upon a Broken Heart is a 400-page book which sounds like it will take a long time to read, but with Graber’s writing style, you won’t even notice. This book — no, maybe all of her book is truly a page-turner. I’ve seen many positive comments about all of her works that say her writing is wonderful, managed to capture the reader’s interest.\n\nMany people believe that page-turner books are only for fast-paced books, but this is not actually the case. To be honest, Once Upon a Broken Heart has a rather boring beginning and the plot is quite slow, given that the first half of the book provides an introduction to Garber’s vast world building and, of course, each of the characters’s introduction. But what strikes readers is that, despite the fact that the plot is slow, this book succeeds in keeping fans flipping page after page without them recognizing it.\n\nWhy?\n\nGarber succeeded in giving complexity to the characters she has, such as Jacks, who appears mysterious but has characteristics that can invite enthusiasm from readers, making them wonder what plans he has for Evangeline Fox or other characters that will make readers question if this character is either good or evil. Furthermore, a plot that tells an intriguing story throughout time will keep readers glued to the book.\n\nThanks to Garber’s wonderful writing technique, Once Upon A Broken heart was absolutely enchanting and magical, it made me forget that I was actually reading because it felt like I was being teleported and live in The Magnificent North. It really is giving much magical fairytale experience to read this book, it was terrific.\n\nI also love the character Jacks. I think, besides his psychotic personality, he’s every girl’s dream man, or maybe your typical rom-com man if he was not in the fantasy genre book. He’s very sly, cheeky, a bit wicked, and very handsome, according to what Garber has described in the book. I mean, look at him!\n\nDare I say that Jacks is the most intriguing character among other young adult fantasy books?\n\nI am absolutely in love with the character; the depth in Jacks’s character makes him more compelling, and the realism in Evangeline Fox’s character makes us relate and sympathize even more with her. it feels like I forgot I was reading and that I am not Evangeline Fox. I kept my expectations partially low because I didn’t want to be disappointed in the end, but this book managed to surpass my expectations and eventually raise the bar for me.\n\nAlthough the story may appear to be fairly slow and boring at the beginning of the book, with its character being seemingly dry and dull even for Jacks, who is said to be such an interesting character, the rest of the book is fast-paced, fascinating, and full of amusing plot twists, which made the book gradually enjoyable over time.\n\nIts sequels and what is it about\n\nAfter telling about Evangeline Fox’s journey to stop Luc and Marisol’s wedding with Jacks’s help in the first book, which ended in a cliffhanger, Stephanie made sequels to finish the romantic tale between Evangeline Fox and the Prince of Hearts, Jacks.\n\nThe Ballad of Never After\n\nNot every love is meant to be — Stephanie Garber\n\nAfter Jacks, the Prince of Hearts betrays her, Evangeline Fox swears she’ll never trust him again. Now that she’s discovered her own magic, Evangeline believes she can use it to restore the chance at happily ever after that Jacks stole away.\n\nBut when a new terrifying curse is revealed, Evangeline finds herself entering into a tenuous partnership with the Prince of Hearts again. Only this time, the rules have changed. Jacks isn’t the only force Evangeline needs to be wary of. In fact, he might be the only one she can trust, despite her desire to despise him.\n\nInstead of a love spell wreaking havoc on Evangeline’s life, a murderous spell has been cast. To break it, Evangeline and Jacks will have to do battle with old friends, new foes, and a magic that plays with heads and hearts. Evangeline has always trusted her heart, but this time she’s not sure she can…\n\n2. A Curse of True Love\n\nTwo Villains, one girl, and a deadly battle for Happily ever after\n\nEvangeline Fox ventured to the Magnificent North in search of her happy ending, and it seems as if she has it. She’s married to a handsome prince and lives in a legendary castle. But Evangeline has no idea of the devastating price she’s paid for this fairytale. She doesn’t know what she has lost, and her husband is determined to make sure she never finds out . . . but first, he must kill Jack, the Prince of Hearts.\n\nDoes it connect to the Caraval Series?\n\nAfter being immersed in the narrative, I tried looking for other books by Stephanie Garber, and I found out that the Caraval series and the Once Upon a Broken Heart series are in the same universe. Consisting of 4 books, Caraval, Legendary, Finale, and the upcoming final book titled Spectacular, will tell the story of Scarlett Dragna, who has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful and cruel father. Now, Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval — the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show — are over.\n\nPrince of Hearts, Jacks, is told more clearly there, so if you read the Caraval series first, you will be more familiar with the world created by Stephanie Garber. Though as it may, it is also possible to read Once Upon a Broken Heart without reading Caraval. Once Upon a Broken Heart can be considered a stand-alone book as reading the previous series, Caraval, is optional to comprehend its narrative.\n\nHowever, readers stated that in the Caraval series, there are so many backstories and more characters to acknowledge before proceeding to Once Upon a Broken Heart, which recommends reading the Caraval series beforehand. Here are a few of the testimonials from people who have already read the series on Goodreads:"
