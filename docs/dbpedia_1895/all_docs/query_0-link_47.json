        "text": "Once Upon A Curse is a series of fairy tale retellings all set in the same fantasy universe!\n\nThe first book, Gathering Frost, is a USA Today \"Must-Read Romance\" and retells the story of Sleeping Beauty. The second book, Withering Rose, retells the classic story of Beauty & The Beast. The third book, Chasing Midnight, is a twisted take on Cinderella. The fourth book, Parting Worlds, retells The Little Mermaid. And don't miss the bonus novella, Granting Wishes, which is a twisted take on Aladdin.\n\n***\n\nOnce Upon a Curse: The Complete Series of Fairy Tale Retellings\n\n**A USA Today \"Must-Read\" Series!**\n\nOver 1400 pages of magic, adventure, and fairy tale romance. This box set includes all four full-length books in the Once Upon a Curse series, plus the prequel novella.\n\nOn a Saturday in spring, an earthquake strikes the entire globe. Cities disappear, replaced by villages that seem torn from storybooks—horses and carriages, cobblestone streets, towering castles, and, most importantly, magic. A world that was once dominated by devices goes dark and a new power rises. What happens when the fairy tales become real? What's stronger, magic or modern technology? What's more powerful, a curse or true love?\n\nIf you like charming trickster princes, avenging fairy godmothers, and princesses who save themselves, don't miss the Once Upon a Curse series!\n\nSave when buying this box set compared to the individual books!\n\n***\n\nGathering Frost (Once Upon A Curse #1)\n\n**A USA Today Must-Read Romance!**\n\nWill the prince's kiss be enough to revive her frozen heart? Don't miss GATHERING FROST, a fantasy romance from bestselling author Kaitlyn Davis that reimagines the classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty.\n\n\"I wish I could say I was the hero of the story. A resister. A rebel. Someone who lived to bring an end to the queen who stole my childhood--my mother, my life, my very world. But I'm not. I'm not the good guy. I'm the one who puts the good guys in their graves.\"\n\nJade was only a little girl when the earthquake struck. Before her eyes, half of New York City disappeared, replaced by a village that seemed torn out of a storybook. Horses and carriages. Cobblestone streets. A towering castle. And, above all, a queen with the magical ability to strip emotions away.\n\nTen years later and Jade has forgotten what it is to feel, to care...even to love. Working as a member of the queen's guard, she spends most of her time on the city wall staring at the crumbling skyscrapers of old New York. But everything changes when the queen's runaway son, Prince Asher, returns. Under his relentless taunts, her blood begins to boil. Under his piercing gaze, her heart begins to flutter. And the more her icy soul begins to thaw, the more Jade comes to question everything she's ever known--and, more importantly, whose side she's really on.\n\nRAVE REVIEWS for Gathering Frost!\n\n\"My favorite thing about this book is the action. Jade isn't a sleeping princess. She's the best fighter and so fierce in her \"empty\" state. I felt like this was an urban fantasy with all the steam of a romance, and it was almost perfect for me.\" - Jessie Potts, USA TODAY Happy Ever After Blog\n\n\"Davis writes with confidence and poise, and the story's many twists and turns stave off predictability and allow readers to become immersed in a starkly magical world filled with last hopes.\" - Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Gathering Frost is just awesome in every way. Beautiful prose, lots of heart-wrenching emotion, action and romance, a great, unstoppable villain, and a smart, tough heroine who will fight for what she wants.\" - Geeks in High School\n\n\"The writing is flawless as always and I must say, way to take a classic and make such a creative and wonderful twist to it...It's well thought out and it unbelievably magnificent. I seriously couldn't put it down. Wait I never actually put it down. I started and finished in one sitting because it's just that good. This one is a MUST READ.\" - Happy Tails and Tales Blog\n\n\"I loved everything about this book! The different take on Sleeping Beauty, the strong female characters, and the overall vibe of the book/series to come. Jade is amazing and leaped off the page...This is not just a romance! It has great action scenes where Jade is kicking some major ass and there are surprises at every corner.\" - Hooked In A Book\n\n\"I loved this book. To me is it a very loose reimagined world of Sleeping Beauty, but that is a good thing. It kept me guessing and really kept me on the edge of my seat. I stayed up late reading as I just had to know what happens next.\" - Michelle's Paranormal Vault of Books\n\n***\n\nWithering Rose (Once Upon A Curse #2)\n\n**A USA Today Recommended Series!**\n\nBeauty is cursed, and only the Beast can save her... Don't miss WITHERING ROSE, a fantasy romance from bestselling author Kaitlyn Davis that reimagines the classic fairy tale of Beauty & The Beast. This is the second book in Once Upon A Curse, a series of interconnected stand-alone novels all set in the same fantasy universe.\n\n\"As the heat finally disappeared, I felt the bloom blossom in the very core of my soul, a rose just like my name--a ticking clock hidden behind a façade of beauty. From that moment on, my life would become a countdown, and all I could do was wait and watch as the petals of time slowly started to fall.\"\n\nOmorose Bouchene has a secret--magic. There's only one problem. At the age of seven, an earthquake struck, catapulting her into a new world. A land made of skyscrapers and cell phones. Fast cars and fluorescent lights. A land where magic isn't supposed to exist and anyone who wields it is the enemy.\n\nBut after ten years of hiding, she's desperate to find a place where she can be free. Because all magic comes with a curse, and her curse is time--every ounce of power she uses strips days off of her life. The clock is winding down, and the only option left is to escape to the realm of the Beast. But the king of monsters isn't what he seems. And the more Omorose opens her heart, the more she comes to realize that the only person she may need to fear is herself.\n\nBuy now for:\n\n***\n\nChasing Midnight (Once Upon A Curse #3)\n\n**A USA Today Recommended Series!**\n\nThis faerie godmother has an agenda of her own... Don't miss CHASING MIDNIGHT, a fantasy romance from bestselling author Kaitlyn Davis that reimagines the classic fairy tale of Cinderella.\n\n\"I could redeem myself if I wanted to. I could help them. But I won't. I'm the villain of their story, because it's the only way to be the hero of mine.\"\n\nHundreds of years ago, humans learned the secret to sealing magic beneath their skin and stole it from the world. Faeries reverted back to flowers. Shifters remained trapped in their animal forms. Mermaids turned to foam. And the magical creatures who survived vowed revenge.\n\nNymia is one of those survivors, a faerie brought back to life by the return of her magic. When she finds a human girl named Ella with her sister's power trapped beneath her skin, she'll do anything to get her back, including kill.\n\nThere's only one problem.\n\nThis isn't the world she remembers. Humans here have a power all their own--technology. And when a human prince sees her using magic, he'll use every invention at his disposal to track her down. The countdown is on, and time is running out. Nymia needs to find Ella, take back her sister's magic, and escape the determined prince before the clock strikes twelve, or she might not make it out of his city alive...\n\nBuy now for:"
