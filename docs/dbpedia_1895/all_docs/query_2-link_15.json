Even loud laughter could conceal a plot to topple. I can sleep as long as I like. People keep on changing their face mask like dresses. We don’t know who are our real friends. If we are frank, we gain real enemies and false friends.\n\nSamacheer Kalvi 11th English Once Upon A Time Textual Questions\n\n1 Based on your understanding of the poem answer the following questions in one or two sentences each:\n\nOnce upon a time, son\n\nThey used to laugh with their hearts\n\nAnd laugh with their eyes:\n\nBut now they only laugh with their teeth\n\nWhile their ice-block-cold eyes\n\nSearch behind my shadow.\n\nThere was a time indeed\n\nThey used to shake hands with their hearts\n\nBut that’s gone, son\n\nNow they shake hands without hearts\n\nWhile their left hands search\n\nMy empty pockets.\n\n“Feel at home!”, “Come again”\n\nThey say, and when I come\n\nAgain and feel\n\nAt home, once, twice\n\nThere will be no thrice For then I find doors shut on me.\n\nSo I have learned many things, son\n\nI have learned to wear many faces\n\nLike dresses – home face\n\nOffice face, street face, host face\n\nCocktail face, with all their conforming smiles\n\nLike a fixed portrait smile.\n\nAnd I have learned too\n\nTo laugh with only my teeth\n\nAnd shake hands without my heart\n\nI have also learned to say “Goodbye”\n\nWhen I mean “Good-riddance”\n\nTo say “Glad to meet you”\n\nWithout being glad; and to say “It’s been\n\nNice talking to you”, after being bored.\n\nBut believe me, son\n\nI want to be what I used to be\n\nWhen I was like you.

Those who were once so genuine, warm and sincere, have now suddenly turned cold and hostile towards him. He realizes that the early values in African society like sincerity, good-naturedness, simplicity, whole-heartedness, hospitality, friendliness, originality, and uniqueness have now drastically changed. The earlier warmth and heartfulness has gone. He finds himself behaving the same way as those around him. He has learnt to wear different faces for different occasions. He wears faces like dresses. He says not what his heart tells him. His smiles are also fake. He smiles only to be socially accepted. He has learnt to say “Goodbye”. After being bored, he brings a fake smile and says “It’s been nice talking to you” when he meant “good-riddance”.\n\nQuestion (ii)\n\nThis poem is nothing but criticism of modern life. Justify this statement.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe poet’s understanding of adult society is extremely negative. The poet distinctly portrays how people in modem times have become hypocrites and fake emotions to be socially accepted. The phrases of hospitality they use “feel at home” and “come again” are fake that a third visit would be disallowed by the hosts. In modem times, people don’t value real emotions instead they value positions and possessions. Even while shaking r hands, they try to assess the material worth of a person. People don’t laugh with heart, Their ice-cold block eyes search the person they talk to. Most of them have acquired the skill of wearing a standard, deceitful, artificial smile on all occasions, i.e., “portrait smile”. Thus the poem is nothing but criticism of modem life.\n\nQuestion (iii)\n\n‘Face is the index of the mind.’ Does this adage concur with the views of the poet?\n\nAnswer:\n\nUnlike the people of the past, people in modem times “laugh only with their teeth” while their ice-block cold eyes search for something. Now, people shake hands without hearts. There is no human warmth in social relations. While they shake hands, they look for. evidence to judge the financial status of a person. People say ‘feel at home’ and ‘come again’.\n\nBut if a person visits a third time he is not welcomed. They all have cocktail faces ready for all occasions. Their conforming smiles are like fixed portrait smile. They wear standard, deceitful, artificial smiles for all occasions. They have faces like masks. The poet has learned from them how to use faces like dresses, home face, office face, street face, host face, etc. Their faces, like the teeth of the elephant, show only what is accepted. The ugly side of their personality is cleverly hidden behind their deceitful smiles and polite words. So, the poet’s views do not concur with the adage “Face is the index of the mind”.\n\nAdditional Questions\n\nQuestion (i)\n\nDiscuss the central theme and tone of the poem “Once upon a time”.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe poem has mixed feelings of childhood, regret, and innocence. The child (son) in the poem is a symbol of innocence, purity, enthusiasm, happiness, and genuineness which are lacking in modem society. The child also represents a group of people not affected by western culture and abides by their own culture. Innocence is a fading aspect of man’s society. People always appear deceitful and cunning. The child acts without any malice. The poet finds himself behaving the same way others behave. He is also wearing faces like dresses. He has lost his true cultural identity. He does possess a different portrait smile, the fixed look for different occasions, the unnatural smile plastered across his face. The poet is struck by a sense of self-loathing and regret turns to his son to help him unlearn all unreal things and help him regain his child-hood innocence.\n\nlistening Activity\n\n(5) First read the questions given below.

His poems have been translated into many languages. Before establishing himself as an accomplished writer in 1960 he had written poems for Black Orpheus. He has conferred the best award for Literature at the Nigerian Festival of Arts in 1953. He was also honoured with the Commonwealth Poetry. Award. Okara’s specialty is that his poems emerge from everyday reality, merge with moments of delight and move back to reality making a complete circle. His prose and poetry were infused with African thought, folklore, and imagery. Okara’s poems show great sensitivity, perceptive judgments, and tremendous energy. This poem “Once Upon a Time” reminds one of William Wordsworth’s “Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollection of Early Childhood”. Okara illustrates the changes a father has seen in him throughout his life which have been influenced by the way the society has changed.\n\nOnce Upon A Time Summary\n\nPoet Okara condemns false appearances projected by people to safeguard their own interests. He bemoans the loss of genuine laughter and deep relationship between friends when he was a kid. He is saddened by the inconsistent nature of people and how successfully they take emotions to suit their convenience and personal ends. They show false warmth during daily exchanges of courtesy and wear masks to prevent the discovery of their real feelings. The poet admits that he had also become a hypocrite like the rest and his reflection in the mirror does not reflect the warmth of human love but the fangs of a snake deadly enough to kill fellow humans. So, he requests his son to teach the forgotten art of spontaneous and genuine laughter similar to his boyhood days.\n\nOnce Upon A Time Glossary\n\nTextual:\n\ncocktail face-face showing mixed emotions conforming smiles like a fixed portrait smile – wearing a standard deceitful artificial smile on all occasions\n\nfangs – teeth of a venomous snake, used to inject poison\n\ngood-riddance – an expression of relief at being free of an unwanted person\n\nice-block-cold eyes – eyes lacking a feeling of warmth or endearing expression\n\nlaugh with their teeth – to fake a laugh, laugh without associated emotions\n\nsearch behind my shadow – people are hypocritical and they don’t mean what they say\n\nwhile their left hands search my empty pockets – evaluating the narrator’s worth and power or calculating how he could be exploited"
