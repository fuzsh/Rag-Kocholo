        "text": "I’m a reformed science fiction/fantasy snob: I stubbornly refused to try the genre for years. I falsely believed that books had to teach me something in order to be worth reading and didn’t think SFF had anything for me. But when our lives crashed down around us in 2020, I found respite and escape in worlds that were not real. SFF also allowed me to imagine that things could be different, better than what I was currently experiencing. The most powerful thing you can do is imagine how things can be different, believes SFF author Ursula Le Guin. What would the world be like if the founding fathers hadn’t imagined a new country, or Martin Luther King, Jr. hadn’t imagined equality for all? That’s the gift of science fiction/fantasy. And while the genre can be intimidating for beginners to start reading (it was for me), here are the tips and strategies that helped me make SFF one of my favorite genres.\n\nFirst, what exactly is SFF? There are a number of articles defining these terms and the difference between science fiction and fantasy has been argued ad nauseam. But here’s how it was simply explained to me using two popular franchises, both set in space: science fiction stories lean into the science, something that could be real because there is a scientific-backed explanation for it existing. Because of this, science fiction is generally set in the future (from the writer’s perspective). Think Star Trek: technology has advanced to the degree that we can separate our atoms and put them back together in another location. Beam me up, Scotty! Fantasy is not that: it is magical! Unexplainable! Fantastical! Think of George Lucas’s self-described space fantasy, Star Wars, “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away”. What is the Force? No one knows but “may [it] be with you”.\n\nHow to start reading Science Fiction/Fantasy\n\nThere is a book for you.\n\nTo begin reading science fiction/fantasy, look for topics and genres that you love. Sci-fi/Fantasy spans it all, including romance, horror, and literary fiction. If you’re into historical fiction, in The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, Addie never dies so the novel spans generations, including the French Revolution. Love the exquisite writing and character development of literary fiction? Pick up anything by Emily St. John Mandel. I love reading about books, words, and language, so the historical fantasy work Babel by R. F. Kuang is right up my alley. Are you wanting to explore other cultures? Binti by Nnedi Okarafor, an Afrofuturistic novella, fits this bill.\n\nStart small and gentle.\n\nThe easiest way to enter SFF is to start small: short stories and novellas are great to step into a different world without having to put a lot of energy in. Do not start with a doorstop, as I falsely believed most fantasy to be because those tomes seem to get top billing in the genre.\n\nI also don’t recommend beginners start with stories about bleak dystopian futures unless sad and depressing is your jam. Hopeful and gentle fantasy describes kinder futures. If you want this feeling at the end of the day, read anything by Becky Chambers, one of my favorite SFF authors.\n\nLook for an accessible option.\n\nSci-fi/Fantasy is known for its extensive world-building. It can take the reader some time to get acclimated to a new world and the technology or creatures in it. I hate being lost during the entire first third of a book wondering what is going on. Counteract this potential pain point by reading a story where things are only slightly different than the real world.\n\nMagical realism, a term originally associated with Latin American literature which used magical elements as political critique, is now a term generally used to describe a story where a little bit of magic slips into everyday life. These books can be a great starter point on your fantasy journey. Midnight at the Blackbird Cafe by Heather Webber is one of my favorites; there is something interesting going on with those blackbirds that surround the cafe. Another worth mentioning is Zakiya Dalila Harris’s The Other Black Girl. In this thriller, you have to be paying close attention or you will miss the magical element entirely.\n\nAlternate histories and retellings also make good entry points into the genre because you are already familiar with what actually happened. These books change a few of the details, asking “what if?” Stephen King’s 11/22/63 is the story of a man who goes back in time to save John F. Kennedy from assassination. Black God’s Drums by P. Djèli Clark imagines that the American Civil War stalemated and New Orleans is a neutral territory for the North and the South. Cinder, from The Lunar Chronicles series by Marissa Meyer, is a retelling of the story of Cinderella—with cyborgs.\n\nYou’ve done the work. Now enjoy!\n\nOnce you find an author you like, check their backlist. There are often sequels, prequels, and other books in the same universe. This is to a beginning reader’s advantage because once you have read one novel, you are already familiar with the world. When I finished The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers (and it took me a while to get acclimated) it was easy to read the other three books in the series.\n\nDNF or try another format.\n\nIt has taken me a year or so to figure out what SFF reads work for me. And I continue to DNF (that is, Did Not Finish), usually when I don’t take the above criteria into consideration. Sometimes the world-building is taking longer than I want. In the case of one specific buddy read with team member Donna, I did not understand what was going on and I didn’t even care. Recently, team member Brigid suggested that if I was really interested in a SFF book, to give it a try on audio. She said that it might be easier to visualize when I’m not also having to focus on reading the words (like, “how do I pronounce that?”) on the page. This makes sense to me.\n\nIf you’ve had an interest in SFF, I hope these recommendations have shown how you can give it a try yourself. If you enjoy science and the natural world, science fiction may work for you. On the other hand, if you love the mysterious and magical, fantasy may be more your speed. I tend to enjoy and read both equally and adding SFF to my reading rotation has enriched my life in so many ways. Below is a short book list to get you started. Some I already read and loved; some are on my TBR. Which titles caught your eye? I’d love to find out in the comments.\n\nScience Fiction/Fantasy for Beginners\n\nSome links (including all Amazon links) are affiliate links.
