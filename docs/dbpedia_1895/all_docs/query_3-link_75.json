        "text": "Fantasy books offer an escape from everyday life, combining elements of magic, excitement and adventure that make readers’ pulses pound. Whether the main character heads off on a quest to save their civilization or is forced to confront a terrifying truth about their own powers, fantasy novels always explore larger themes that resonate in our own magic-free world as well. Fantasy book series keep the intrigue going with multiple volumes, giving readers a chance to immerse themselves in another dimension. Indeed, world building is an incredibly important part of fantasy—creating a world with its own history and traditions that propel readers into another time and place. This list of best fantasy books and series compiles classics and newer, innovative works that have made a big impact in a short time.\n\nTop Fantasy Books\n\nFantasy novels include anything set in an imaginary world, which often exhibits elements of magic. While some fantasies use real locations, they are somehow changed from real life. Some fantasies take place in the past, while others are set in the future.\n\nSome popular fantasy series include C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia, J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings and J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series.\n\n30.

This is best for those who love fantasy steeped in mythology. Isabel Ibañez’s Woven in Moonlight series is available from publisher Macmillan.\n\n28. Binti by Nnedi Okorafor (2015-2019)\n\nWhen math genius Binti has the chance to study at the prestigious Oomza University, she and her family are thrilled.

Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1915)\n\nThis is probably the most obscure book on the list, yet it’s worthy.

Cypher series by Daniel José Older (2015-2020)\n\nThis book is set in Brooklyn, but it’s not the one you’re used to. In this Brooklyn, zombies crash parties and graffiti murals cry real tears. Teen Sierra gets sucked into a plot by a Shadowshaper named Wick to eliminate his competition, and only she can thwart his plan.\n\nThe series has earned universally glowing reviews from readers.

It features excellent world building and relatable teenage angst.\n\nThe series is popular on Booktok, and it spawned a Netflix series that recently finished its run. This series is best for those who enjoy immersing themselves in another world. Leigh Bardugo’s Shadow and Bone series is available from publisher Macmillan.\n\n20. The Once & Future King series by T.H. White (1938-1958)\n\nThe first of two Arthurian fantasy works on the list, this historical novel recounts the legend of King Arthur, beginning with the sword in the stone and going through the final days of his reign and his fraught relationship with his son, Mordred.

It also prompted the musical adaptation Camelot. The book series is best for monarchy lovers. T.H. White’s The Once & Future King series is available from publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n19. Earthsea Cycle series by Ursula K. Le Guin (1968-2001)\n\nImagine a world of islands where much of the land is uncharted, and magic is a part of daily life. Ursula K. Le Guin created a world filled with diverse people with different complexions—a departure from most traditional fantasy to that point, where the default was white characters.\n\nYou can’t make a list of best fantasy books without Ursula K. Le Guin, one of the most revered fantasy writers of all time. The series won a slew of awards, including a Newbery Honor. The book is best for young readers starting their fantasy journey. Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea Cycle is available from publisher HarperCollins.\n\n18. Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Salman Rushdie (1990)\n\nA 12-year-old boy named Haroun goes on a quest to heal the sea of stories, which proffers the power of storytelling. While this is a children’s book, author Salman Rushdie’s sophisticated approach makes it just as readable for adults, even with the magical animals.\n\nThe critically lauded Haroun and the Sea of Stories spawned a sequel, Luka and the Fire of Life, about Haroun’s brother. Salman Rushdie’s Haroun and the Sea of Stories is available from publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n17. Dark Star series by Marlon James (2019-present)\n\nAuthor Marlon James tells the story of a young boy’s capture and death with an intriguing twist.

The series is best for those interested in learning more about African history or who love creative storytelling.

His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman (1995-2000)\n\nOne of the most popular young adult fantasy series of recent years, the trilogy begins with The Golden Compass and functions as a retelling of John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It interrogates the notion of original sin while sending characters through parallel universes.\n\nPullman won the Carnegie Medal and the Whitbread Book of the Year. The trilogy became a successful HBO miniseries as well. Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials series is available from publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n13. The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson (1990-2013)\n\nRobert Jordan originally envisioned this as a six-book series, but the high fantasy saga eventually ballooned to 14. The Hugo-nominated series focuses on a world where the Wheel of Time maintains the cosmic order, which is threatened by the reappearance of the evil Dark One.\n\nJordan passed away in 2007 while working on the 12th book.

The book, often compared to a Grimm’s fairy tale, has a surreal edge.\n\nIt became a pop culture touchpoint, and musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno named their 1981 album after the book, which made Time’s list of 100 greatest fantasy novels. This book is best for those who enjoy dark fairy tales. Amos Tutuola’s My Life in the Bush of Ghosts is available from British publisher Faber and Faber.\n\n10. Legends of the Condor Heroes series by Jin Yong (2019)\n\nAlready a sensation in China, Jin Yong’s series about the quest to become the ultimate kung fu master became an instant American hit. The book is set in ancient China, where Guo Jin seeks assistance from Genghis Khan to avenge his father’s murder. He trains for a showdown in the Garden of the Drunken Immortals.\n\nTranslated by Anna Holmwood, the book series was originally published as a serial in Hong Kong from 1957-1959.

Jin Yong’s Legends of the Condor Heroes series is available from publisher Macmillan.\n\n9. A Song of Fire and Ice series by George R.R. Martin (1996-current)\n\nYou may not know it by the Fire and Ice moniker, but you definitely know of George R.R. Martin’s high fantasy series, which begins with a little book called Game of Thrones. The series will eventually consist of seven novels, but only five have been published so far, the most recent in 2011.\n\nIt follows the charged battle for power in the nations of Westeros and Essos, and it explores themes of morality vs. violence, loyalty and pride. Martin draws on real historical events, like the War of the Roses, for inspiration. He has won literary prizes like the Locus Award for the novels, which of course inspired HBO’s smash Game of Thrones. The series is best for fans of the show or Lord of the Rings lovers. George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Fire and Ice series is available from publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n8. The Changeling by Victor LaValle (2017)\n\nIt’s certainly no coincidence that this dark book came out after Donald Trump’s rise to political prominence. Victor LaValle reinterprets the classic fairy tale for the modern age, focusing on two new parents whose lives suddenly fall apart—and the quest to save love and a seemingly doomed marriage.\n\nLaValle’s novel earned a spot on Time’s and USA Today’s top 10 of the year. This book is best for those who love fairy tale retellings. Victor LaValle’s The Changeling is available from publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n7. The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern (2012)\n\nLe Cirque des Rêves is a nighttime circus that arrives suddenly, and it’s the place where Celia and Marco fall in love. Unfortunately, the two performing magicians are also involved in a nightly competition, and neither knows that only one of them can win. They may just take down circusgoers and other performers with them.\n\nThe Night Circus became a New York Times bestseller, receiving glowing reviews and earning a place among the best romantic fantasy books. This book is best for romantasy devotees. Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus is available from publisher Penguin Random House.\n\n6. The Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien (1937-1950)\n\nThe best-known high fantasy series of all time, the Lord of the Rings series has sold more than 150 million books and is one of the top-selling series of all time. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote it as a sequel to The Hobbit, and it follows several hobbits on a quest to destroy the One Ring.\n\nWizard Gandalf, brave Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli aid on the quest as the hobbits are pursued by the evil Sauron, a Dark Lord trying to reign over Middle Earth. The books became a top-grossing, Oscar-winning movie trilogy as well. This series is best for anyone interested in high fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings series is available from publisher HarperCollins.\n\n5. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (1865)\n\nWhen Alice follows a white rabbit down a rabbit hole (just one of the expressions credited to Carroll), she emerges in Wonderland, where everything inspires awe but nothing is as it seems. Alice faces trial after trial as she attempts to find the rabbit and then escape from the not-so-wonderful land.\n\nCarroll delivered clever social commentary through a book ostensibly meant for children—despite sophisticated messaging. Disney turned the book into a popular animated film in 1951 and a quirkier live-action version in 2010. This book is best for those who revel in absurdity. Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland is available from publisher Simon & Schuster.\n\n4. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series by L. Frank Baum (1900-1920)\n\nThe wonderfully weird Wizard of Oz series begins with a girl named Dorothy Gale, who is accidentally whisked to a faraway fantasyland after a fight with her family. Her adventures with Oz residents help her realize there’s “no place like home”—but the book series goes on for 13 more volumes.\n\nThe books bring to life magical characters who we never even meet in the popular 1939 film, such as The Soldier With the Green Whiskers, Patchwork Girl and Woggle-Bug. They are truly a delight of imagination and writing. This series is best for anyone who loved the movie Wizard of Oz and wants more. Frank Baum’s Oz series is available from publisher HarperCollins.\n\n3. Watership Down by Richard Adams\n\nAuthor Richard Adams has long claimed he wrote his acclaimed story of anthropomorphized rabbits forced out of their longtime warren in search of a new home not as a parable or allegory but as a story for his daughters. Still, it’s impossible to miss the greater themes in this Carnegie Medal- and Guardian Prize-winning book.\n\nIn addition to garnering critical acclaim, the bestselling book about exile and survival has also prompted multimedia adaptations, including an animated movie and a TV show. This book is best for children and teens just delving into fantasy. Richard Adams’ Watership Down is available from publisher Simon & Schuster.\n\n2. Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling (1997-2007)\n\nJ.K. Rowling’s storytelling abilities are without peer. From the moment Hagrid swoops in to rescue Harry Potter from his tedious muggle life to the series’ final confrontation with Voldemort, she keeps readers on the edge of their seats awaiting the exciting conclusion. The Christ story parallels are unmistakable, but the writing never feels stale.\n\nRowling’s politics have justifiably brought her more attention in recent years than her creativity. But Harry Potter remains the bestselling series of all time and inspired a hugely successful movie franchise as well. This book is best for reluctant readers and adults who have somehow avoided reading the books. J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series is available from publisher Scholastic Press.\n\n1. Broken Earth series by N.K. Jemisin (2015-2017)\n\nN.K. Jemisin’s unrivaled prose puts her atop the list for her trilogy beginning with the beautifully rendered Hugo Award-winning opener, The Fifth Season. It tells the story of a girl, a young woman and a desperate mother navigating life in a volatile world torn apart by geographic catastrophes.\n\nJemisin uses fantasy and metaphor to explore the issues of prejudice and oppression. She tackles big issues while also telling a compelling story in an impressive feat of world building. This book is best for fans of science fiction and fantasy. N.K. Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy is available from publisher Hachette Book Group.\n\nBottom Line"
