        "text": "Once upon a time, in a land far far away (not really – its only a short drive into New Jersey!), there is a magical place called Storybook Land. And quite a story it is, the family run amusement park is based on nearly all of them. Welcome to Storybook Land – a whimsical amusement park based on Nursery Rhymes and Classic Children’s tales, located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. A short drive from the city – this fantasy of characters, rides, animals and roadside attraction-esque figures needs to be placed on your family’s must-visit list.\n\nBehind the Story\n\nFor over 60 years, Storybook Land has been keeping the spirit of childhood alive in an entertaining and educational atmosphere. In 1955, John and Esther Fricano created their vision of entertaining children with storybook characters and rides. Mr. Fricano, a war veteran, father, and a house painter, was frustrated by the lack of activities for his young children, and decided to create an amusement park for them. He purchased five wooded acres and cleared much of the land by hand. He also created all the early attractions, while Esther decorated them. It started as a fairytale themed playground, and slowly grew into a tale of attractions, rides and more…\n\nToday over 15 rides preside on 20 shady acres of Storybook Land. it remains a family business, as the next generation of Fricanos continue to keep Storybook Land a wonderful place for families to visit.\n\nThe Mother Of All Amusement Parks\n\nUpon walking in you are greeted by the grand dame of them all – Mother Goose. And grand she is, at over 20 feet tall with enlarged namesake goose by her side, there’s no question who presides over this park. Be sure not to miss the large book throne for the perfect photo opp.\n\nMother Goose is only the beginning! Visiting is a bit like stepping into a fairy tale: as you walk through the beautiful wooded grounds, you encounter characters from nursery rhymes and classic children’s tales. If you can name it, its represented here – either by show, ride or attraction; such as Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Jack & Jill with their hill, and Humpty Dumpty before he takes his spill. Nostalgia-inducing and wildly enchanting – this land of fantastical stories can easily put you under its spell.\n\nThe attention to detail throughout Storybook land in general, is incredible. Someone took great care to create the park and it shows. Every design element was thought about, meticulously created and chosen, and incredibly maintained. The level of detail makes these stories come alive and seem real.\n\nEven more – the park is SPOTLESS. The rides, attractions, bathrooms, everything – Its shockingly clean! It is absolutely the cleanest amusement park I have ever seen by far.\n\nWhat makes Storybook Land unique is the animated scenes that are speckled throughout the park. Perfect for those who are hearing the tale for the first time (our little guy) and also for those who need a refresher course (me) these mini theaters are quite amazing. You simply push a button and watch a puppet-style show (similar to that seen in the older days of Chuck E Cheese) where characters sing and dance with movement. Our little guy LOVED these attractions and we stopped at many of them throughout the park.\n\nA few Fairytale highlights:\n\nThe Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe. Such incredible craftsmanship – this walk-through shoe is much bigger than our NYC apartment!\n\nThe Three Little Pigs and their amazing homes: Brick, sticks and straw.\n\nMoby Dick – walk all the way into the mouth for a fun surprise!\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nBilly Goats Gruff – where you can place food in the pail and the talented goats use their mouths to pull the food up to the platform\n\nSanta Baby\n\nIt isn’t all about the Queen Mother, Storybook Land also has the King of all Children’s Lore – Santa Claus. In an incredible, ornately decorated gingerbread house, kiddies and the young at heart alike can feel Christmassy all year around by peering into the windows to see Santa and his Elves. Further in the park you will find all of Santa’s Reindeer, the North Pole, and even some frosty friends. Tip – touch the North pole! Its actually ice. (How’d they do that?!)\n\nTick Tock Clock Drop\n\nStorybook Land Rides\n\nWith 17 rides there’s no shortage of thrills at Storybook Land. No need for ride tickets here – the price of admission includes all activities and attractions. Adults are allowed on all rides, and can accompany the children if needed. The best part – even on the busiest days the waiting time is minimal – allowing for kids to ride multiple times in a row easily, and see many of the attractions in a single day.\n\nThe rides range from carousels and low thrill construction rides, to small roller-coasters and spinning creatures best for older toddlers. Storybook Seaport – a small spray ground, is open in the summer. A few of our favorites: Bubbles the Roller Coaster, Tick Top Clock Drop, Whirly-Bug Ferris Wheel, Alice’s Tea Time, and the Turtle Twirl (similar to that of a tilt-a-whirl). There are also flying elephants and dragons which are classic favorites. J&J Railroad and the Work Zone construction-themed rides are extremely gentle.\n\nA few highlights:\n\nBubbles the Coaster\n\nWhirly Bug Ride offers a great view of the park\n\nThe Out on a Limb swing ride\n\nWork Zone Ride\n\nBeanstalk Bounce\n\nCharming train ride around the park"
