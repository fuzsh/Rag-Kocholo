        "text": "After sharing the Petite Noir-featuring \"Rolling Stone\" last week, Danny Brown is back with another taste of his forthcoming record, Atrocity Exhibition. While \"Rolling Stone\" was somewhat of a more relaxed affair for the rapper, \"Really Doe\" sees Danny coming in with everything he's got. Accompanied by three incredibly talented rappers, it certainly makes sense that Danny would be eager to prove just how great a rapper he is.\n\nFeaturing Kendrick Lamar, who provides a hook and a verse, Earl Sweatshirt, and Ab-Soul, \"Really Doe\" is a star-studded track that puts an extra emphasize on the talent involved. Everyone brings their unique element to the song, but it's Earl's verse that really hits the hardest, coming right in during the last stretch. After Danny shared a clip of the track on his Instagram, Hot 97's Peter Rosenberg premiered the highly anticipated track.\n\nListen to \"Really Doe\" below."
