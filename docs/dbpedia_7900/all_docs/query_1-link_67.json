        "text": "Turns out, it is as dangerous to be a person in “House of the Dragon” as it is “Game of Thrones.”\n\nThe new HBO series is set 200 years before the events of “Game of Thrones” and provides the backstory for the Westerosi world viewers first fell in love (and anguish) with in 2011.\n\nIt tracks the prelude to, and resultant horror, of the Targaryen war of succession, nicknamed the Dance of the Dragons.\n\nThe Targaryen family is pulled apart by which of King Viserys I Targaryen’s (Paddy Considine) children should succeed him: his firstborn, daughter Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy), to whom he promised the throne when she was young, or his son Aegon II Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney), born from a marriage with Rhaenyra’s former best friend, Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke). The realm is now divided, with the Blacks supporting Rhaenyra and the Greens championing Aegon.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin’s “Fire & Blood,” published in 2018, may shed light on which deaths are around the corner. If the book is to be our guide for the show, then there is bloodshed ahead.\n\nWho dies in 'House of the Dragon' Season 2?\n\nRhaenys Targaryen (Season Two, Episode Four)\n\nWho is she? Nicknamed the Queen Who Never Was because she was passed over the throne, Rhaenys (Eve Best) was a supporter of Rhaenyra and her bid for queen. She and Lord Corlys Velaryon had a son and a daughter, Laena and Laenor.\n\nHow did she die? Her dragon, Meleys, was killed in a battle with Aemond and Aegon Targaryen. She fell to her death.\n\nLord Gunthor Darklyn (Season Two, Episode Four)\n\nWho is he? Head of House Darklyn\n\nHow did he die? Lord Darklyn (Steven Pacey) refused to bend the knee to Aegon II after a fight. Criston Cole (Fabian Frankel) beheads him.\n\nDavos Blackwood, Aeron Bracken and the Battle of Burning Mill (Season Two, Episode Three)\n\nWho are they? The heads of rival houses. The Blackwoods support Rhaenyra and the Brackens support Aegon.\n\nHow do they die? At the battle of Burning Mill along with many of their fighters.\n\nErryk and Arryky Cargyll (Season Two, Episode Two)\n\nWho are they: Twin brothers who are members of the Kingsguard for opposing sides. Arryk (Luke Tittensor) is a member of Aegon II's Kingsguard and Erryk (Elliot Tittensor) is Rhaenyra's.\n\nHow do they die? They fight to the death. Arryk is stabbed by Erryk, who then impales himself on his weapon out of grief.\n\nBlood and Cheese (Season Two, Episode Two)\n\nWho are they? Jaehaerys' assassins.\n\nHow do they die? Blood (Sam C. Wilson) is bludgeoned by Aegon II Targaryen. Cheese (Mark Stobbart), a rat catcher, is hanged along with the other rat catchers of King's Landing.\n\nJaehaerys Targaryen (Season Two, Episode One)\n\nWho is he? Jaehaerys is the 6-year-old son of Aegon and his heir.\n\nHow did he die? The Season Two premiere adapted one of the most dreaded and anticipated moments from “Fire & Blood.” Nicknamed “Blood and Cheese,” the scene refers to the moment two intruders force Aegon’s wife (and sister), Helaena (Phia Saban), to choose which of her children to kill.\n\nOnline, fans of the book called the scene “underwhelming,” and critics said it should have been “nastier.” But the plot’s result was the same: Jaehaerys was killed.\n\nIn the show, Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), Rhaenyra’s husband (and uncle), hired the assassins to target Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell), Viserys and Alicent’s second son. Aemond was responsible for the death of Rhaenyra’s second son, Lucerys (Elliot Grihault). Daemon’s plan went awry, however, and young Jaehaerys ended up dead instead.\n\nArryk and Erryk Cargyll (Season Two, Episode Two)\n\nWho are they? Arryk and Erryk are twins who served in the Kingsguard. After Vyseris’ death in Season One, the brothers’ allegiances were split: Arryk sided with Aegon and remained at King’s Landing, while Erryk kept loyal to Rhaenyra and went to Dragonstone with the Blacks.\n\nHow did they die? In Season Two, Episode Two, Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), now commanding Aegon’s Kingsguard, tasks Arryk with sneaking into Dragonstone — disguised as his twin — to target Rhaenyra in revenge for Jaehaerys’ death. Arryk begrudgingly accepts the order, makes it into Rhaenyra’s chambers but is confronted by brother Erryk. They brawl. Erryk eventually slays Arryk but then turns his blade on himself.\n\nWho died in 'House of the Dragon' Season 1?\n\nQueen Aemma Arryn (Season One, Episode One)\n\nWho is she? The first wife of King Viserys and Rhaenyra’s mom.\n\nHow does she die? Queen Aemma (Sian Brooke), pregnant with a son, has complications during her birth. Viserys is called into the room and told he can either save her or cut the baby out. Though the latter would result in Aemma’s death, he opts for the chance at a male heir. Aemma dies — but so does their baby a day later.\n\nRhea Royce (Season One, Episode Five)\n\nWho is she? Rhea Royce (Rachel Redford) is Daemon’s first wife. They become estranged during their arranged marriage.\n\nHow does she die? In the show, Daemon finds her out on her horse and kills her with a stone. It’s more ambiguous in Martin’s book, where he writes, “Lady Rhea Royce, fell from her horse whilst hawking and cracked her skull upon a stone.”\n\nJoffrey Lonmouth (Season One, Episode Five)\n\nWho is he? Joffrey (Solly McLeod) is Laenor Velaryon’s (John MacMillan) knight and lover.\n\nHow does he die? Laenor and Rhaenyra have agreed to wed by Season One, Episode Five, but made a pact to continue their own affairs. At their wedding, Joffrey, who has learned of Laenor and Rhaenyra’s agreement, quips about it to Criston and alleges he and Rhaenyra are involved. (They were, but that relationship broke down with when Rhaenyra rejected Criston’s offer to run away together.) Criston proceeds to beat Joffrey to death. Laenor later names one of his sons after him.\n\nLaena Valeryon (Season One, Episode Six)\n\nWho is she? The daughter of Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and Princess Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best). She becomes Daemon’s second wife and they share two daughters, Baela (Bethany Antonia) and Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell).\n\nHow does she die? By Season One, Episode Six, Laena is pregnant with her third child but the baby was stillborn. In her grief, she commands her dragon to burn her alive.\n\nHarwin Strong (Season One, Episode Six)\n\nWho is he? Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr) is a knight of House Strong and the heir of Harrenhal. He serves as commander of the City Watch of King’s Landing. He also fathered Rhaenyra’s three oldest sons, Lucerys, Joffrey and Jacaerys.\n\nHow does he die? Harwin’s brother, Larys (Matthew Needham), lights a fire that kills Harwin and their father in a strategic effort to advance his own station with Alicent.\n\nVaemond Velaryon (Season One, Episode Eight)\n\nWho is he? Vaemond (Wil Johnson) is the brother of Corlys Velaryon and a commander in the Velaryon navy.\n\nHow does he die? Daemon decapitates Vaemond after he says Rhaenyra’s children are bastards. He had been pleading to the king that he was the rightful heir to Driftmark and the title Lord of the Tides, not Rhaenyra’s son.\n\nViserys Targaryen (Season One, Episode Eight)\n\nWho is he? Viserys is the king prior to the crisis of succession.\n\nHow does he die? Viserys dies a slow death of the rot. On his deathbed, he mistakes wife Alicent for daughter Rhaenyra and proceeds to continue an earlier conversation between himself and Rhaenyra about King Aegon I and his prophecy about a sovereign meant to unite the realm. “You are the one. You must do this,” he says.\n\nAlicent believes Viserys tells her their son Aegon is the rightful heir to the throne, and this very unfortunate misunderstanding becomes the spark that launched the civil war.\n\nLyman Beesbury (Season One, Episode Nine)\n\nWho is he? Beesbury (Bill Paterson) is Lord of Honeyholt and Master of Coin on King Viserys’ Small Council.\n\nHow does he die? After Viserys’ death, he pleads in a Small Council meeting to keep Rhaenyra on the throne in line with his late friend’s wishes. Criston chides him, then smashes his face into the marble table.\n\nLucerys Velaryon (Season One, Episode 10)\n\nWho is he? Lucerys is the second son of Rhaenyra and Laenor, though by blood, he and his two brothers are actually the children of Harwin Strong.\n\nHow did he die? Lucerys is killed in the Season One finale. This is largely considered the inciting moment of the civil war.\n\nLucerys had just traveled with his dragon, Arrax, to Storm’s End to see if the Baratheon family will pledge allegiance to Rhaenyra. He encounters Aemond there. The two have history: Lucerys blinded Aemond in one eye during a fight when they were kids.\n\nAemond, on his dragon named Vhagar, chases down Lucerys and Arrax and kills them. Aemond seems anguished, though briefly, as Vhagar acts on his behalf."
