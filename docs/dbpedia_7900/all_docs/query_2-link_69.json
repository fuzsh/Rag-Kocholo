        "text": "Photo by Kris Lenz\n\nAtrocity Exhibition is the forthcoming fourth album from Danny Brown, due to drop next week on September 30th. Just two days after unveiling the massive posse cut “Really Doe”, featuring Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt, and Ab-Soul, Brown returns with “Tell Me What I Don’t Know”.\n\nFeaturing production from longtime collaborator Paul White, the track sees Brown “talkin’ that old school Detroit shit,” rhyming about neighborhood raids, court dates, and losing friends to street violence. “It’s like a cycle,” he reflects on the endlessness. “You get out, I go in this is not the life for us/ Tell me what I don’t know.”\n\nStream it below.\n\nRelated Video\n\nBrown also talked to Zane Lowe about “Really Doe”, his favorite songs on the new album, and the state of his voice after concerts. Check out excerpts from those discussions."
