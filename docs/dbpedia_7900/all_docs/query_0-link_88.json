        "text": "What happens when you get Danny Brown, Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, and Earl Sweatshirt all on one track? Pure magic. Coming as unexpected but welcomed news, it was shared hours ago that a record that included all four gentlemen would be premiered at midnight. Sticking to the promise, we now have ‘Really Doe’ and it’s just as exciting as anyone would ever think.\n\nWith the four gentlemen getting in line and spitting some of their best rhymes that 2016 has to offer, if you’re looking for a record that’s radio friendly, ‘Really Though’ is everything but that. Taken from Danny’s forthcoming studio album, Atrocity Exhibition , this new record will spark plenty of interest in the upcoming body of work, without a doubt. Take a listen to ‘Really Doe,’ in full, below."
