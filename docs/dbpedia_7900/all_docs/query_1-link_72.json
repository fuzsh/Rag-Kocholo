        "text": "What is popcorn lung?\n\nPopcorn lung (bronchiolitis obliterans) is an uncommon type of lung disease. It’s caused by a build-up of scar tissue in the lungs, which blocks the flow of air. Popcorn lung isn’t cancer.\n\nWhat causes popcorn lung?\n\nAround the year 2000 a group of popcorn factory workers in the USA developed the condition, leading to the name ‘popcorn lung’. Diacetyl was a flavouring in the popcorn and so the workers breathed it in. It was not related to use of e-cigarettes.\n\nAlthough bronchiolitis obliterans is sometimes called ‘popcorn lung’, it can be caused by a number of different things. For example, if the lungs are damaged by an infection. Or after breathing in chemicals that irritate the lungs and cause damage.\n\nWhat are the facts about e-cigarettes and popcorn lung?\n\nThere have been no confirmed cases of popcorn lung linked to e-cigarettes. Some of the liquids in e-cigarettes used to contain diacetyl. This led to the idea that e-cigarettes might cause popcorn lung.\n\nIn the UK, diacetyl was banned in e-cigarettes and e-liquids under the EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) in 2016. So, legal e-liquids sold in the UK aren’t allowed to contain diacetyl. Only use legal e-cigarettes from a reputable retailer.\n\nAre e-cigarettes harmful in other ways?\n\nE-cigarettes are a relatively new product – they aren’t risk-free and we don’t yet know their long-term effects. Children and people who have never smoked shouldn’t use them.\n\nBut research so far shows that vaping with legal e-cigarettes is less harmful than smoking, and they are an effective stop smoking tool.\n\nYou can find further information on our webpage about using e-cigarettes to stop smoking."
