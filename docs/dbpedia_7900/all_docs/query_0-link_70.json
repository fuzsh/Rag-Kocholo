        "text": "This morning Danny Brown dropped “Really Doe,” the fourth single off his forthcoming album Atrocity Exhibition.\n\nFeatures from Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul made “Really Doe” one of the LP’s most heavily anticipated songs, and it doesn’t disappoint. Bells clang in a coarse groove while the rappers trade off blustering verses. Earl closes the track with the excellent wisecrack, “I’m at your house like, ‘Why you got your couch on my Chuck’s?’”\n\nIt’s an instant hit of a track, yet the hook—sung by Kendrick—is humble: “They say I got the city on fire / I ain’t boomin’, that’s a goddamn lie.” Really, doe?\n\nMake no mistake: though Danny Brown only handles the first verse, he’s in charge here. Discussing the song with Rolling Stone, he said, “I’m pretty much the main star of this show, as always.”"
