        "text": "Weirdly obsessed with Daemon Targaryen on House of the Dragon despite the fact that he’s low-key unhinged and also married to his niece? And currently on his own side quest with seemingly no ability to actually help Team Black? Same! But don’t get too attached. Thanks to spoilers, we know exactly what happens to Daemon on House of the Dragon, and—hate to say it—he’s not exactly long for this world. However! There’s a lot of room for the show to take some creative liberties.\n\nGonna go ahead and assume you’re down with spoilers if you ended up reading this article, but just in case you aren’t…turn back now because SPOILERS ABOUT HOW DAEMON DIES ARE AHEAD!\n\nDaemon and Prince Aemond Battle It Out\n\nAccording to (the extremely lengthy source material for House of the Dragon), Daemon dies after an epic dragon fight with Prince Aemond…who also dies, womp. TL;DR: Daemon’s spending his time trying to find/kill Aemond, and they eventually have a confrontation. Aemond’s iconic words upon seeing his uncle? “You have lived too long, Nuncle.” (Also: \"Nuncle\" is just an old-fashioned way of saying \"uncle,\" stemming from \"mine uncle.\") Me personally? I'm considering tattooing it.\n\nAnyway, Daemon and Aemond hop atop their respective dragons, Caraxes and Vhagar, and proceed to battle it out in the sky. But it doesn’t go great for our buddy Aemond thanks to Daemon stabbing a sword into his eye “so hard, the point came out the back of the young prince’s throat.” Truly, Aemond’s eyeballs cannot catch a break on this show!\n\nDaemon Is Presumed Dead\n\nEmphasis on presumed. Basically, Caraxes and Vhagar crash into a lake mid-fight with such force that local fisherman declare “neither man nor dragon” could survive. Poor Vhagar straight-up sinks, and considering Prince Aemond’s “armored bones” are eventually found chained to her, gonna assume he drowns too.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Daemon’s body isn’t found. And while there are rumors he somehow survived and lived out the remainder of his life with Nettles (a dragonrider he starts having an affair with), the book says historians give “the tale no credence.”\n\nOf course, the show could take some creative liberties and keep Daemon alive, so…guess we’ll see what happens?\n\nWhen will this happen on the show?\n\nGreat question! If the show follows the book, we still have a bit of time with Daemon and Aemond. There's a lot of battling and plot that needs to happen before this ^. But again, the show could take liberties. We do know, though, that the show is already renewed for season 3, so it would make sense to keep both characters around for the time being. Here's hoping Daemon at least makes it out of Harrenhal sometime soon."
