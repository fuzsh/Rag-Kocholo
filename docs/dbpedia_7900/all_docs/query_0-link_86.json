        "text": "If for some reason, you had the nerve to believe lyricism is dead in 2016, then Danny Brown, Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, and Earl Sweartshirt have arrived to prove you wrong. Coming from his long awaited forthcoming album, Atrocity Exhibition, the Detroit emcee have come to deliver a fire collaboration titled “Really Doe”\n\nREAD: Danny Brown Reveals Title Of New Album\n\nBrown and company each lay lyrical waste to the sinister and smoked out production from fellow D-Town producer, Black Milk, as they come in like the rap Avengers. To put in the proper perspective how crazy this track is here are the some examples of some of the insane bars from each of the artist.\n\nDanny: “Rolling up them vegetables/Rapping with that special flow/Only way you’re next to blow if you be strapped with C4”\n\nThe Black Lipped Bastard: “Second grade, took my mama weddin’ ring, took that bitch/To show-and-tell, now I’m married to the game to no avail”\n\nK.Dot: “I chewed the face off the laces/I moved the weight from the waitress/I chef the pot that made poison/I cooked then tipped all the patients”\n\nEarl: “So disrespect and gettin’ checked like the top of the month/I was a liar as a kid so now I’m honest as fuck/And I never passed my mama no blunt, it kept my head straight/Less than deadweight, never been a problem to dump”\n\nWith each emcee giving their own amazing performances, its highly debatable on who gave the best verse ala classics like “Renegade” or “4, 3, 2, 1,”. However, Earl Sweatshirt in particular is letting the world know that he will not be denied as a highly gifted lyricist as his delivery and no nonsense bars make him stand out the most."
