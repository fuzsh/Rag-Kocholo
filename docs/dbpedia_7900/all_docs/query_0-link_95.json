It opens the film and serves as the motif.\n\n...Baby One More TimeBritney Spears\n\n\"Baby One More Time\" was originally offered to TLC but they passed on it. The R&B trio felt uncomfortable singing the line \"hit me baby one more time.\"\n\nIrreplaceableBeyonc√©\n\n\"Irreplaceable\" wasn't specifically penned for Beyonce - in fact, Ne-Yo wrote it more as a country song and had Faith Hill and Shania Twain in mind.\n\nJetPaul McCartney & Wings\n\nThe Australian band Jet took their name from the 1973 song of the same by Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\nPrivate DancerTina Turner\n\nMark Knopfler of Dire Straits wrote \"Private Dancer,\" which went to Tina Turner when he realized it wasn't a song for a man to sing.\n\nTake On Mea-ha\n\n\"Take On Me\" was just a minor hit in Norway until a new version was released with the iconic video, making it a global smash.\n\nTimothy B. Schmit of the EaglesSongwriter Interviews\n\nDid this Eagle come up with the term \"Parrothead\"? And what is it like playing \"Hotel California\" for the gazillionth time?\n\nDick Wagner (Alice Cooper/Lou Reed)Songwriter Interviews\n\nThe co-writer/guitarist on many Alice Cooper hits, Dick was also Lou Reed's axeman on the Rock n' Roll Animal album.\n\nGraham NashSongwriter Interviews\n\nGraham Nash tells the stories behind some of his famous songs and photos, and is asked about \"yacht rock\" for the first time.\n\nMike Scott of The Waterboys - \"Fisherman's Blues\"They're Playing My Song\n\nArmed with a childhood spent devouring books, Mike Scott's heart was stolen by the punk rock scene of 1977. Not surprisingly, he would go on to become the most literate of rockers.\n\nDavid Paich of TotoSongwriter Interviews\n\nToto's keyboard player explains the true meaning of \"Africa\" and talks about working on the Thriller album."
