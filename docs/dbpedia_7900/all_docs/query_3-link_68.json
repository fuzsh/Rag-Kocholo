        "text": "The New Jersey Department of Education does not mail official transcripts or diploma verification. Test Takers are only issued one original diploma. A duplicate diploma can be obtained once you have your access code. The verification process explained below is how test takers will verify the test was passed.\n\nPlease note that it takes anywhere from 5–7 business days for new tests results to be received by the State from the Test Vendor, and 3–5 business days to process and mail the diploma and transcript. If you know that you have passed one of the tests and have not received the diploma yet, you must contact the State within six months of it being passed that your diploma was not received. If you do not notify the State that it wasn't received in that time period, you will have to obtain your access code and download a duplicate diploma from our website.\n\nIf you took the GED, HiSET or TASC test(s) after January 1, 2014 the access code, verification code and this webpage link appears on the diploma and transcript you were issued. If you have that info on the diploma or transcript you can enter it into the link below. and print your official transcript or just give the codes to any school or employer and they can access it themselves.\n\nPlease note that if you have your test vendor ID number and not your access code, you may still be able to access your official record by clicking the \"here\" button on the diploma verification link below and entering the test vendor ID number and your last name at time of testing. If you just recently took one of the three tests (GED, HiSET or TASC), please wait at least 10 business days before trying to access your test records using the test vendor ID and last name.\n\nOnce you have your access code, these are the instructions to obtain your transcript and/or duplicate diploma\n\nIf you do not have your access or transcript verification code and tested at a state-approved test center and are looking to obtain your official transcripts/diploma verification, federal law requires that the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) receives a signed request from the test taker. Please complete and submit the access code request form to the NJDOE. The access code request form must be mailed to the following address:\n\nNew Jersey Department of Education\n\nOffice of Career Readiness\n\nAdult Education\n\nPO Box 500\n\nTrenton, New Jersey 08625-0500\n\nIn lieu of the form you may also request your High School Equivalency Access Code by writing a signed letter to the address above and include the following information:\n\nFull Name\n\nName at time of test (if different from above name)\n\nSocial Security Number, Tax Payer ID or other government issued identification number\n\nDate of Birth\n\nPhone Number\n\nEmail Address\n\nRequest High School Equivalency Access Code\n\nWritten Signature\n\nThe access code will then be provided to your email or over the phone, whichever you specified in the signed request. This code can be entered at the links above labelled Access to Official Records. Please note that this is to access only the official transcript and verification of diploma."
