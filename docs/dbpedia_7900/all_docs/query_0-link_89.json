        "text": "Your rap nerd wet dreams just came true. Danny Brown has recruited Kedrick Lamar, Ab-Soul and Earl Sweatshirt to get on the same track, “Really Doe.”\n\nDanny Brown spent $70,000 to clear samples for his new album Atrocity Exhibition. This track alone sounds worth it alone.\n\nThe track was debuted on Peter Rosenberg‘s late night Hot 97 show and currently, the radio rip is the only thing available. All four MCs leave their mark on the grimy track with each coming through loud and clear with distinct flows. K. Dot stans will say he stole the show but Brown did not get “renegaded” on his own song. He raps first and sets the tone.\n\nThis the second Kendrick feature we’ve got in a month. The other being his showing on Isaiah Rashad‘s “Wat’s Wrong.”\n\nBrown’s album drops on September 30 but is available for pre-order right now.\n\nCheck out the radio rip here."
