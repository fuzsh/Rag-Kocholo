The track follows Brown’s previous singles ‘Pneumonia’ and ‘Rolling Stone’, which will also appear on the new record. You can listen to it below.\n\nThe album, which follow’s 2013’s ‘Old’, marks his debut for electronic label Warp Records. ‘Atrocity’ – which draws inspiration from Raekwon, early Björk, Joy Division, Talking Heads and System Of A Down’s ‘Toxicity’ – also features production from Kanye West collaborator Evian Christ and South African songwriter Petite Noir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“At the end of the day, its just something that I really took my time with,” Brown told Rolling Stone of the album. “I know this day and age, a lot of artists can’t really take time off to make music … they’ll get replaced. With me, [I’m] somebody that’s able to sit down and be able to take my time, ’cause aint nobody gonna be out here sounding like me, ain’t nobody gonna be out here doing what I do.”\n\nOf the albums title’s connection to the 1980 Joy Division song, Jones’ recently said: “That song, [Ian Curtis is] pretty much talking about how he feels like he’s part of a freak show almost. People just wanna come see him and they just wanna see him be a certain type of way. I totally relate to that. That’s just how I felt with this album, ’cause a lot of people expect for me to be some crazy drugged-out I-don’t-know.”\n\nRecommended\n\nThe tracklisting for ‘Atrocity Exhibition’ is:"
