Some of us will have to dig back to our childhoods, others will have to go back a few weeks but let’s share our earliest silent film memories.

When I was a kid, I had a VHS tape of the silent Mutt and Jeff cartoons, which were redrawn in the 1960s or 1970s and had a groovy soundtrack added. For some reason, it never really occurred to me that these were silent films.

My first official silent film was Sparrows (1926) and… I hated it. The tape was faded and the organ score was warped and droning. (Don’t worry, I like it now. You can read my review here.) It taught me very early that who releases a silent film is almost as important as the movie itself.

Fortunately, I followed up with Charlie Chaplin’s City Lights and the rest is history.

So, what about you? Do you remember your first silent? Please share!
