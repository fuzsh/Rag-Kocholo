We know: sometimes, romantic comedy movies can feel a little cheesy. Not everyone is so embracing of the inherent optimism that comes along with a good old romcom. But we have good news—not everything in the ever-so-wide-ranging world of romantic comedies is lovey-dovey mushy-gushy. Sure, that's the genre, so that stuff is always going to be in there somewhere. But it's one of the most loved and frequently-visited genres for a reason, and many of those people visiting are actually quite funny. That can include actors, writers, writers who act, actors who write, and everyone else involved in making something that might culminate in us laughing aloud if everything goes according to plan.

Sometimes, that means visits from people you'd think of as just, well, funny—that means Seth Rogen, Kristin Wiig, and Billy Crystal, for some. Other times, that means some of the best TV shows you may or may not have seen (HBO and Hulu come in handy there). And other times you'll find romcom laughs even in places you're not looking. Whether you're looking for the perfect Valentine's Day movie, or are aimlessly scrolling for something on Netflix, we've got you covered.
