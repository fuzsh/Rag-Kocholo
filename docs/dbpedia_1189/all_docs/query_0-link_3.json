UOW many times have you — like members of the ordinary public — recognised faces on the screen without knowing the names of the players ? PRODUCING organisations are often in the same position. They know the stars of the first and second magnitude, but they cannot remember the names of half the Milky Way of smaller part players ■ — although their faces are quite familiar. When they do remember the names, they usually want the addresses as well. \\\\7E have frequently heard producers and casting assistants trying to recall the names or addresses of experienced people, -and vainly seeking them. A PRODUCER may know every one of his small part people on the floor, but be unable to get them again when he wants them. OF course, every firm should keep thousands of ^ photographs systematically filed — but how many firms maintain this once universal practice ? \\\\7E have lately heard complaints from actors and ’ * actresses that they have lost work because they could not be found. I S there a moral ? 'T'HERE is.

No. Ill. July 21, 1923 More Film “ Schools ” S it coincidence, or can it be cause and effect ? Within a fortnight of the booming of Margaret Leahy (a stunt now deservedly dead let us hope) three new film “ schools ” sprang up in the West-End of London, and we hear of others in the provinces. It would almost seem that the promoters of at least two of these precious concerns for fleecing the public are awake to the opposition which this journal and the Kinema Club are offering to their licences ; for they are at the present moment (unless, indeed, their activities have been curtailed by the authorities) carry¬ ing on illegally without that necessary formality — a cool procedure which we do not think will last long, in any event. Presumably they are alive to the risk they are running, but hope to make hay while the heat-wave lasts. * * * Fleeced and Deluded Girls N the last few days we have spoken to several young girls who have parted rather trustfully with sums ranging from five to thirteen guineas for alleged “ tuition at one of these parasitic institutions which subsist (at the expense of the Industry’s prestige) on the credulity of the uninformed public. How long this sort of thing is going to last it is impossible to say. There is no possible way of preventing screen- smitten girls from parting with their savings to these gentry. All that can be done is to scotch the activities of these schools as quickly as they become known ; and as the promoters must now be pre¬ pared for opposition to their licences, they are evidently out to snatch as many fees as possible before exposure and cessation of operations. It is really abominable that they should find it possible to carry on even for a brief period. The public are the sufferers. Their excusable lack of ac- 1 quaintance with the real conditions of the film industry makes them the easier prey. The specious and flagrant lies they are told by glib rogues would be ludicrous if they were not at the same time heartless, and we shall continue to use every effort to stem the growth of all quack schools with every weapon m our power, confident in the sup¬ port not only of our readers, but of every section of the Industry. * * * ^HOSE who advocate (and practise) the inclusion of an American staj; in British pictures in order to sell the finished production in the Transatlantic market have been criticised adversely in several quarters, and have also stated their case for what it is worth — and it certainly is a case. We would suggest to them for con¬ sideration, however, a growing tendency in American pictures to do without the magic of the star’s name. There is no sign which would lead one to believe that the booming and exploitation of big players’ names and personalities is on the road to extinction. We do not think this will ever come about, any more than it will eventuate in the world of the theatre. But there is certainly a tendency to make “ no-star ” pictures in America — even if some of these pictures are called “ all star ” ! In the face of this, and of the sale of “ This Freedom,” it does not appear to us that the starring of an American player is a sine qua non for the success of a British production on the other side. We never thought that it was — and we think still less that it is now. Jfc 5*C 'THEORETICALLY, we believe in the abolition of stars altogether — but that is when we are merely considering a film as a medium of story-expression. The proper casting of a well-written scenario should take no account whatever of any qualifications other than suitability of the players for the parts. But it is useless to pretend that the commercial success of films does not depend to a large degree upon the exploitation of personality, and that the name of a star does not mean more to the potential spender of ninepence than does the title of the picture. At the same time we welcome the starless picture. It gives other players a chance to become known — and perhaps become stars them¬ selves, because they will not, under such conditions, be subordinated to one or two dominating personalities who use most of the available footage. The star-less film is likely, indeed, to afford more scope for varied, sound and all-round acting than the picture which is little more than a flimsy vehicle for a big name. It wants much more careful casting, too ; and we should like to see an improvement on thi head in many British pictures. * * * lately had occasion to criticise the British Broadcasting Company over their lending themselves to the furtherance of the Leahy stunt — a lapse from their wise policy of discouraging wireless ad¬ vertising which could only arise from their being unaware of the nature of the interlude. It is, therefore, with more than formal pleasure that we congratulate them upon securing for future talks on film-topics that excellent discourser, G. A. Atkinson, the capable and often pungent film-critic of the Daily Express and Sunday Express. His appointment is at least a guarantee against the future uninformed misuse of wireless on film subjects. * * * \\S a refreshing set-off to the inordinate vanity of certain producers — English and American — who take unto themselves the supreme credit and responsibility for the moral uplift alleged to be due to their pictures, and who would rather perish than admit any ideal or goal in film-making higher than their last picture, it is good to listen to M. L’Herbier. This thoughtful and capable French director says : “ We are spectators ourselves, learning something every day.” He scouts the theory that the film theatre is essentially a relaxation for the least cultured portion of the masses, and contends, with some justice, that the popular taste can be catered for side by side with the artistic requirements of the more exacting sections of the public. It is, indeed, the masses themselves who are much more susceptible to really artistic ideas than many producers — and show¬ men — are apparently willing to believe. Of all the mentalities in filmdom, save us from the man who regrets the avowed necessity of “ playing down ” to the gallery. * * * Another Fraudulent “ Producer ” ^OUNTLESS people in the Industry will learn with something more than equanimity of the conviction and imprison¬ ment of Sydney Webber Northcote, reported on another page. This adventurer has had too long a run, and owes money to more people than we have the space to enumerate, both among the trade and the outside public. Such persistent and heartless adventurers are a blight on our social fabric and a danger to the Industry to which they 1 have little or no claim to belong. The Play’s the thing , but — Broadcasting on Films Fewer “ Stars ” Healthy Dissatisfaction 3 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO July 21, 1923 HIGH LIGHTS Intimate Studio and Club Gossip /^aptain C. C. Calvert starts for Scot- land this week-end to commence the first exterior scenes of the new Gaumont production of “ Bonnie Prince Charlie.” His two principals have names to conjure with, being none other than Ivor Novello, recently returned from his engagement in America under D. W. Griffith, and Gladys Cooper in the opposite role of Flora Macdonald. The company will first proceed to the Isle of Arran. Cinclair Hill is to direct the George ^ Robev picture which will follow “ Don Quixote.” The subject is entitled \" Widow Twan-Ivee,” which sounds strongly suggestive of “Aladdin.” The word Twan-Kee, by the wav, does not appear in the Arabian Nights version of the famous pantomime tale, but I think I am correct in stating that it was invented by that fertile burlesque writer of the ’eighties, Henry J. Byron, in an “ Aladdin ” travesty. Sinclair Hill, by the way, wrote the scenario of “ Don Quixote,” now being actively directed by Maurice Elvey. A rthur Rooke is now on the final scenes of the new Granger- Davidson picture, “ M’Lord of the White Road.” The story, which is set in the vivid days of the Regency, is adapted by Kinchen Wood from the novel by Cedric Fraser. Victor McLaglen has one of the finest parts he has ever played, and Marjorie Hume, who has now completed all her scenes, tells me she has never been so satisfied with a part before. Leslie Eveleigh has managed to get some unusually effective pieces of double¬ exposure work into the picture. /graham Cutts, now returned from ^ some carefully chosen Con¬ tinental locations, began the interior scenes of “ Children of Chance ” the title of which is now “ The Awakening, ” at Islington this week. The picture, as my readers know, is the second pro¬ duction featuring Betty Compson, and the supporting cast is an unusually powerful one, including Clive Brook, Henry Victor and A. B. Imeson. rPhat excellent comedian Donald A Searle tells me he has been en¬ gaged for a part in the new George Clark picture, “ Diana of the Islands,” to be directed by F. Martin Thornton, who is commencing work very shortly. Come really unique scenes were ^ witnessed at the Islington studios the other day. The occasion was the “ shooting ” of a series of big scenes in “ Squibs, M.P.,” in a set representing the interior of the House of Commons. Seldom has so striking a set been seen, even at Poole Street. In its preparation the utmost care was taken to ensure the making of an exact replica of St. Stephen’s historic chamber. Moreover, in matters of parliamentary procedure George Pear¬ son had taken care to obtain the authoritative guidance of the Serjeant- at-Arms himself. “ Members,” care¬ fully chosen, sat and lolled on the benches in traditional parliamentary style. Hphe feature of the day was the A attendance of several live M.P.s, notably Sir William Bull, Hammer¬ smith’s popular representative, who entered into the spirit of the pro¬ ceedings to the extent of being in¬ cluded — unless I am mistaken — in some of the shots ! Betty Balfour, attired in what now seems to be a sort of parliamentary ladies’ uniform of black, with white neck and cuffs, was brisk and terse. She made a fervent and racv speech with defiant aggressiveness, the subject of which seemed to be “ Babies before Battle¬ ships ! ” Its effectiveness may be fairly judged by the fact that the Government were shortly afterwards defeated as the result of a division (without re-takes), and the enthusiasm of the august assembly was well caught by Percy Strong at his camera. T could not help thinking that this A authentic piece of staging was an agreeable contrast to a filmed House of Commons scene described to me by Dennis Eaclie not so long ago, when the Italian producer directed the actor p laving the Speaker to clap his hands vigorously at the end of a speech ! Pearson is, I gather, well satisfied with the day’s work, and “ Squibs, M.P.” is now well on the way to com¬ pletion. 1 hear it is to be the last of the “ Squib? ” series; but I hope not. A/faurice Tourneur, by the way, recently spoke of Betty Balfour. “ There is no one like her,” he said. “ In my opinion she is a perfect artist.” And so say all of us. It is agreeable to hear testimony to a British -'tar’s genius from such a source. HPhe Ideal studios at Boreham Wood A are far from idle these days. Thomas Bentley is now on the final scenes of the Bairnsfather comedy, “ Old Bill Through the Ages,” and will probably have completed them by the time these lines are published. Denison Clift is working assiduously on “ Mary Queen of Scots ” with Fay Compton, Ivan Samson, Gerald Ames, John Stuart, Lionel d’Aragon and other members of his powerful cast. I should not be very astonished, by the way, to have further news of Henry Kolker’s future activities. A thene Seyler, according to some remarks published in the S/age, is far from satisfied with current methods adopted in our studios to get the best results from players. She complains that she is tolol only how to look, and not what to feel. This grievance is, unfortunately, not con¬ fined to Miss Seyler, by any means, and as she rightly observes, thorough rehearsals, with complete understand¬ ing on both sides, would be more calculated to get better acting results. She believes also in speaking real lines before the camera, and pleads for less verbal instruction during the actual “ turning,” a practice which she finds distracting. It is quite true, of course, that actors are less likely to appear automatons if left to themselves — especially experienced trained people. At the same time, there are, I am thankful to say, a fair number of pro¬ ducers who fully recognise this fact, and act accordingly. TlTenry Edwards, who recently com- pleted “ Boden’s Boy,” based on the novel by the late Tom Gallon for the house of Hepworth, is building and furnishing a model cottage some distance from Walton in a style en¬ tirely his own. I should not be sur¬ prised to learn that the energetic and versatile producer and actor had evolved a new school of architecture and founded a new period of interior decoration ! Come successful London street ex- ^ teriors were taken on Sunday within a short radius of the Kinema Clubby Manning Haynes. Johnny Butt and Moore Marriott were the chief players, and Frank Grainger obtained some useful footage for “ An Odd Freak,” the new W. W. Jacobs two- reel corned)'. 4 July 21, 1923 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO A/C ore visits from American stars ! Pauline Frederick will shortly arrive, and Rodolph Valentino is also due very soon. Anita Stewart, I am told, will come over before long and enact several scenes in “Vendetta,” a forthcoming Cosmopolitan production. ‘C'rom Los Angeles I learn officially -*• that Evelyn Brent, who lately created a mild stir by her dramatic relinquishment of the leading female part opposite Douglas Fairbanks, has just finished work with Monte Blue, and is now at work in “ Held to Answer,” opposite House Peters. This is a Metro picture directed by our old friend Harold Shaw. Tt is Walter West’s new picture (not the recently completed and untitled one) which is to be called “ What Price Loving Cup ? ” The story is by Campbell Rae Brown, the author of the famous “ Kissing Cup’s Race,” and if you make a wild guess and describe it as a racing picture, you will not be very far wrong. TlJroward Gaye, who played Byron in the Gaumont picture “ A Prince of Lovers,” is starring in the new Hollywood production, “ Tutankhamen of Luxor.” nphe Bishop of Stepney said last week A at a deaf-mutes home that “ we sometimes heard clergy and other people speak slightingly of the ‘ pic¬ tures,’ but he thought it was a kind of enjoyment which really gave the deaf and dumb some sort of compensating advantage which they could thoroughly enjoy.” Now and again even normal people have been known to enjoy films. By the way, I have often wished in a kinema that I was deaf and that some others near me were dumb ! FEATURETS Series One-Reel Novelties. First-Run Bookings : Rialto, Rivoli Broadway.

Elvey on New Stoll Subjects Tireless Producer Talks of Future Plans JN the course of a friendly chat with Maurice Elvey at Cricklewood, during brief intervals of directing George Robey, I learned some details of the unusually at¬ tractive plans, not only of Elvev himself, but of the house of Stoll as a whole. I promised that certain of their projected activities should not yet be made public. For instance, a very well-known actor will probably figure in Elvey’s next pro¬ duction, in a wonderful part which seems an irresistible proposition — but more of this anon. For the present, Elvey’s plans are almost entirely for big pictures with costume settings. “ I was interested in your article on the ‘ costume boom,’ ” he confided to me, “ and a little error of date is the only correction I would make. It is surely more like 1917 than 1920 when the cos¬ tume slump existed ? I was making costume plays here in 1920, and some of the others you mention were also of that date ! ” I admitted the lapse. “ Otherwise I am in hearty agreement with every word of it. As you know, I have always been a firm believer in the historical picture, and have made them whenever possible. What success I have achieved I consider indeed due to that fact. ‘ Maria Martin,’ ‘ The Wreck of the Birkenhead,’ ‘ Black-Eyed Susan,’ £ Grip,’ ‘ Florence Nightingale,’ ‘ Nel¬ son,’ and many others are part of my record from 1915-1917. I have a firm faith in the public appeal of real history, which has, as a rule, a definite romantic value besides.” “ Do vou think one nation should film another nation’s history? ” “ Why not? The perspective is prob¬ ably different, but usually more accurate. I honestly think ‘ Robin Hood,’ legen¬ dary as the subject partly is, was done better than it could have been done on this side.” “ But there is a difference between official history as taught and the same history as seen from overseas, and the choice is a great responsibility for the film-maker.” “ Exactly. But let us have the truth about our own history, without any sin¬ cere but mistaken patriotism to distort it. If historical films all did this they would be much more authentic than half our history books.” “ I hear that many of Stoll’s coming productions will be, at any rate, costume, and sometimes historical, too? ” “ Very largely. I am now engrossed in ‘ Don Quixote,’ in which George Robey is certain to score heavily. We are working excellently together, and our suggestions have been in a mutually help¬ ful spirit which is making it a pleasure as well as a privilege to direct him. Sinclair Hill’s script is not a burlesque, but the story of Cervantes treated in a novel way. Robey’s next picture, by the way, will be directed by Sinclair Hill, and Maurice Elvey is called ‘ Widow Twan-Kee.’ Is it any¬ thing to do with Aladdin? Well, it sounds like it, doesn’t it? “ I shall probably start on a very big subject with a very great actor, who has never yet appeared for Stoll. The secret is a dark one, but you may mention it next wpek, perhaps. Then there are two special subjects which I am looking for¬ ward to. Both will star Matheson Lang, who is under contract for them. The first is a version of ‘ Henry, King of Navarre ’ — the same Henrv that the late Lewis Waller found such a popular stage character. Isobel Elsom is playing oppo¬ site to Mr. Lang. “ Then there is ‘ The Wolf,’ with a scenario by Leslie Howard Gordon, as another Lang subject. Later on, of course, ‘ The Tower of London ’ will be directed by yours truly. ‘ Guy Fawkes,’ by the way, the other Harrison Ainsworth picture, is now being edited by Challis N. Sanderson, and I boldly predict that you will like it immensely. “ George Ridgwell will be busy on ‘ Becket ’ in the near future, and I think very soon that even four producers, work¬ ing simultaneously, will not be enough to carrv out Stoll’s projected production program.” Dewhurst Returning laf Hytten, just back from Berlin, tells me that George Dewhurst, who is cutting the negative of his new production, “ The Little Door into the World,” at Rheinsberg, Prussia, ex¬ pects to return to London within the next two or three days. >5 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO July 21, 1923 Prison for a “Producer” Curtailment of Northcote’s Activities on the South Coast: Full Report of Proceedings On Monday last, the elusive Sydney Webber Northcote, known only too well by numbers of our readers, was sen¬ tenced to three months’ imprisonment at Swan age. We append a report of the case, for which we are grateful to the Dorset Daily Echo, which published it on ^Tuesday. IMPRISONMENT FOR A FILM PRODUCER. Company of 18 “ Now. Existing on Charity.” Debts at Bournemouth and Studland. “ A Butterfly Going From Flower to Flower.” Sydney Webber Northcote, described as a film producer, of the “ All British Film Productions,” was at a special Petty Sessions at Swanage yesterday sentenced to three months’ imprisonment in the second division on a charge of that 11 being an undischarged bankrupt, who had, therefore, to wit, on August 18, 1920, been duly adjudged bankrupt, he unlaw¬ fully did obtain credit to the extent of upwards of g(io, to wit, ^117 12s., from Edith Gertrude Link, of Studland, hotel proprietress, on June 30, 1923, without informing her of the fact that he was an undischarged bankrupt. The magistrates present were : Messrs- L E. Hewick, Wm. Collins and A. G. Howell A Studland Hotel Bill. Mr. Miller again appeared for the pro¬ secution, and Mr. Lewis for defendant. Defendant appeared on remand, and the chairman of the Bench (Mr. J. E. Hewick) said as the magistrates who sat on the case last week were not present, it would be necessary to have the evidence then given repeated P.C. Galpin thereupon gave his evid¬ ence of arrest, as appeared in last week’s Echo. Defendant pleaded not guilty, and elected to be dealt with summarily. Mr, Miller, in opening the case for the prosecution, said on June 30 Mr. North¬ cote called on Mrs. Link at Fairfield. Studland, with regard to taking her rooms there. The terms agreed upon \\vere 16 guineas per day for 18 persons- I he original period mentioned was three weeks, but this was eventuallv altered to one week. Phe total amount of de¬ fendant's debt to Mrs. Link, with extras, was £ 123 os. 3d. She had presented the account to Mrs. Northcote, and had sent a ^ copy to Mr. Lewis, defendant’s solicitor. The contract was made, and the party left after one week. Mr. Northcote did not inform her that he was an undischarged bankrupt. Mr. Arthur Malcolm Lander, from the Official Receiver’s department of the High Courts of Justice, produced the file of proceedings against defendant. The petition was filed on January 22, 1920, on a creditor’s petition, the receiving order was made on August 18, 1920, the public examination took place on Septem¬ ber 1, 1920, and was adjourned, and was concluded on February 17, 1923. The bankrupt had not applied for his dis¬ charge. By Mr. Miller : I know the defendant, as I had personal conduct of his case, and he is the same person as is now before the court. By Mr. Lewis : It is not usual to tell the bankrupt of the penalties attaching to the failure of acquainting persons of the fact that they are undischarged bank¬ rupts before obtaining credit, as that is provided for in the documents the bank¬ rupt has to sign, where it is all set out. The Week’s Bill. Mrs. Edith Gertrude Link, of Fairfield, Studland, gave evidence in support of her solicitor’s statement. 'She said she was the proprietor of a private hotel at Stud¬ land. S'he saw defendant on Saturday, June 30, and he asked if she could find him accommodation for 18 people and asked her terms. She told him 16 guineas a day, and he said they would come in on the Monday, which they did. Witness thought they were coming for three weeks. On Wednesday she told him she could not accept a cheque, and ‘he then said thev would leave at the end of the week. He said he was expecting a large amount in cash. He gave her the card (produced) on which were the words, “ The All British Film Production : pre¬ sented by Mr. Sydney Webber North¬ cote.” The whole of the arrangements were made bv defendant. She presented the account for £123 9s. 3d. to Mrs. Northcote. He did not inform witness at anv time whilst making the arrange¬ ments of the fact that he was an undis¬ charged bankrupt. Questioned by Mr. Lewis, witness said she opened her boarding-house last year. Came from Bournemouth. Who was the first person you saw? — I saw the advance agent on Thursday, and I discussed terms with him. I ’phoned to the Manchester Hotel, Bournemouth, to know if they were coming. The final arrangements were made between Mr. Northcote and myself. There were 18 persons, including two small children. I saw Mr. Northcote the following morning with Mr. Clark, whom he introduced as his secretary. By Mr. Miller : Mr. Northcote did actually make all the arrangements, and my impression Was that “ The All British Film Productions ” was represented by Mr. Northcote. Mr. Lewis said he proposed to only call defendant as a witness. There was no doubt that he was an undischarged bank¬ rupt, but he had not the slightest inten¬ tion to defraud. Defendant was a per¬ son of good repute as a film producer for the past 18 years. When he took the rooms they were for the purpose of tak¬ ing films in the neighbourhod which he thought would provide good films. Hp had been promised an amount of money, and he thought it would be forthcoming. The account for the rooms was extremelv heavy, but he would have been in a position to pay if the money had come. Company Stranded. They would have finished the films if the prosecution had not instituted these proceedings. The arrest was made on the 7th, which was before the week was up. The bill was not presented until after the arrest, and the result had been ruination to the company, who were stranded without a home. If the film had been finished it would have been a marketable commodity. At the present time the company were existing on charity. Sydney Northqote (sworn) said he had been a film producer since 1905. The advance agent, Mr. De Vere, went to Studland to find rooms for his party, and on his return said he had arranged at Fairfield. Witness went over to Stud¬ land with Mr. Clarke on Saturday and saw Mrs. Link. When he was leaving she said her terms would be 16 guineas per day, to which he made no reply. He discussed the terms with Mr. Clarke, and they decided he could not pay so much. Mrs. Link wired witness that she would take legal proceedings if they did not take the rooms as agreed. They came over into occupation on the Monday. 1,100 Feet of Film. By the Magistrates : If he had not re¬ ceived Mrs. Link’s message he would not have come. Mr. Lewis : I agree that the terms were exorbitant. Mr. Miller objected to this remark. Mr. Northcote, continuing, said they had taken about 1,100 feet of film, and he was expecting £200 from a certain gentleman. He had been promised £300 in all, but did not receive anything. He was to secure a commission on the sale of the film. They were unable to com¬ plete through Mrs. Link’s action. He had no money of his own. By Mr. Miller : You say you had no fraudulent intent, and that you were in good repute as a film producer. Do you recognise a difference between a good man and a good film producer? Were you recentlv staying at the Manchester Hotel, Bournemouth? — Yes, about a month. Other Debts Incurred. Did you leave there owing g?200? — About that. Did you tell them you were an undis¬ guised bankrupt? — No reply. Did vou hire a motor launch from a Mr. Harvey and run up a bill of £30 without disclosing the fact that you were an undischarged bankrupt? — I owe him £30, and the Manchester Hotel, Bourne¬ mouth, £ 200 . It would have been all 6 July 21, 1923 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO right had I received the money from the gentleman mentioned. You know nothing about this person, and yet you trust him for ^6500 ! You now say you did no work at Studland. The Chairman : What did you mean when you said at the last inquiry that it was hard lines after working so hard all the week? — -The work was all done at Bournemouth. Mr. Miller : Then the work was not stopped by Mrs. Link. Mr. Lewis : Who is the All British Film Production ? — Mr. Carter and my¬ self. Mr. Miller: Is he a partner?— No, he financed the start, and he and I receive 50 per cent, of the profits. There is only a verbal agreement. A Speculation. The Bench said they had carefully con¬ sidered the evidence, and they had come to the conclusion that defendant had no backing whatever. He appeared to be a butterfly, going from flower to flower. The business was a speculation, and de¬ fendant had1 incurred debts in the locality for ^200, ^30, and the one to which the charge related. It was a great pity fie had not disclosed the fact of his being an undischarged bankrupt, which he should fiave done. Defendant was then sentenced to three months’ imprisonment in the second divi¬ sion. Mr. Miller was granted an order for costs in relation to witnesses and advo¬ cates’ fees. A Notorious Adventurer How The Motion Picture Studio and Roy Calvert Helped Justice ^J'HERE are few more unpopular figures on the fringe of the film Industry than Sydney Webber Northcote. Although now a guest of His Majesty, convicted of a flagrant offence, we should be rather surprised if some of his many vic¬ tims, both in and out of the Industry, do not think seriously of formulating some other charges of various kinds %gainst him. In the public interest it is undesirable that such an irresponsible and cruel fleecer should be punished simply for one offence out of many. His career of trickery has extended for some years, in various parts of the country, and this journal and John Bull (which has at intervals exposed his nefarious tactics) possess a formidable array of evidence, documentary and other¬ wise, from his numerous victims in London, the provinces, and the Isle of Man. A man who defrauds ex-soldiers of their gratuities, and young women of their savings under the cloak o£ specious promises, deserves little consideration in spite of the fact that he has a wife and family. Some weeks ago we inquired into an obviously dishonest film-face compel it ion conducted from the Manchester Hotel, Bournemouth, and wre were not surprised to discover that Northcote was at the bottom of it. The Bournemouth public C Some people in this Industry manage without the Kine Year Book But it is very difficult. Have you a copy of the 1923 Edition? It is 5s., post free were impressed by his bluff, and he con¬ ducted some “ production ” on the sands, the local Press giving him publicity. His funds were provided by several girls and men who wrere ill-advised enough to “ invest ” in his “ produc¬ tion ” ; but they soon gave out, and, owing money right and left, he trans¬ ferred his activities to Studland, together with his company, recruited from amateurs, semi-professionals, and one or two concert-party and revue artistes. He omitted to pay rent for a bungalow and bathing tents, and his wife left a tem¬ porary maid without wages. The husband of a Southampton lady had parted with ^'300. At Studland they met with more than one kind of bad luck. Financial liabilities kept mounting. Cottagers of humble station were de¬ frauded of board and lodging ; restaurants and hotels declined to give further credit, and the company and cameraman (a member of the K.C.S.) were oured much money. Miss Edith Lvnmore, a profes¬ sional screen artiste, of Kennington, was paid a guinea for a fortnight’s work, and others were even less fortunate. An unlucky circumstance was the fact that the son of the proprietress of the hotel was none other than Roy Calvert, a well- known player in British studios, who speedily found an opportunity of consult¬ ing us as to the proper steps to take. Mr. Calvert, acting in conjunction with ourselves, set the machinery of the law in motion, and the result was that No**th- cote was arrested on Saturday, July 7, on a warrant by the Swanage police. A little bluff on Northcote’s part was treated as such, and he was remanded in custody; and on Monday last a represen¬ tative of John Bull attended the court, furnished with plenty of evidence regard¬ ing the prisoner’s past. Most of this, of course, was inadmissible on the charge preferred The plight of the stranded company wras an acute one. After leaving the hotel, they slept, some in the open and some in the village hall, opened for the purpose by the local authorities. A big- hearted clergyman finally obtained, bv subscription, a sum sufficient to enable those who lived in London to get back. The thanks of the Industry are due to Mr. Calvert for his instrumentality in bringing Northcote at last within the reach of the lawT, and we shall be glad to be of whatever service possible to anv of our readers in a position to formulate • any further proceedings against this pre¬ cious fleecer, who certainly merits punish¬ ment on manv other charges than the one for which he has iust been convicted.

Now they have re¬ turned for a brief space to their former policy by a picturisation of the first novel ever written — nothing less than Cervantes’ deathless “ Don Quixote.” This tremendous subject is so monu¬ mental a piece of literature — a landmark in the art of writing, in fact — that prob¬ ably not one person in fifty among the average _ kinema-going public has ever read it. That, it is to be feared, is the common lot of masterpieces of fiction. But then Stolls do not rely for the appeal of the picture solely upon the close familiarity with the original which all civilised persons are supposed to possess. They have therefore cast the most famous and popular comedian in the world in a principal part. George Robey, the inimit¬ able terse taradiddler of our halls for a quarter of a century, is playing Sancho Panza. Some of my readers may prefer it put another way, and, in accoidance with my grievously accommodating policy of try¬ ing to please everybody, 1 have much pleasure in alternatively expressing it. George Robey is a great comedian whose tremendous personality has made him a national institution for many years. But then Stolls do not rely for the appeal of the picture soley upon the favour in which Robey is deservedly held. They have therefore cast him in one of the most famous stories in the world, namely, “ Don Quixote.” Boiling it down (if the vulgar expres¬ sion may be permitted) Robey is playing Sancho Panza, and let there be no miscon¬ ception — he is enjoying it thoroughly. I found that briskest and most persua¬ sive of directors, Maurice Elvey, con¬ trolling a series of scenes on one of the largest portions of the Cricklewood floor. The set was an exterior depicting a corner in the rambling streets of an old mediaeval Spanish town. Although Mr. Grossman had warned me that there was no “crowd” in the day’s scenes, 1 discovered about fifty players being manipulated, rehearsed and coaxed. '1 here was, for instance, the inimitable “ G. R.” himself, looking much more spherical than usual in the quaint romantic trappings of the bucolic henchman of the Mad Knight. He had no beard, although I had read about his face-foliage, in print. Apparently the topicality of “ beavers ” has waned — or has the recent heat wave something to do with it ? Then there was Don Quixote himself. Jerrold Robertshaw seemed to have stepped straight out of the pages of the book. In sombre garb, lean, tall and dis¬ tinguished, with quizzical melancholy and fanatic integrity written all over him, he appeared to be the very .incarnation of pathetic, half-crazy chivalry. Bertram Burleigh, as Carrasco, a dash¬ ing figure in green, was also a prominent figure, in the shots that followed. A few indolent inhabitants were grouped around. How, then, were there fifty performers? A very natural inquiry. The balance were composed of our (so-called) dumb friends. There was the donkey — a splendid animal of a nice neutral tint, well-groomed, self- possessed and on excellent terms with her fellow-players. I have the best of reason for suspecting that her tractability was not unconnected with a certain pleni¬ tude of carrots ; but her absence from stage-fright was praiseworthy in a com¬ parative amateur. At the back, confined by a rough low rail, were a posse of pigs, grunting gut- turallv, and evidently thinking about the agent’s commission. In the open street and about the doorways and steps, strutted a collection of fowls, secure in the know¬ ledge that Rolls Rovces were unknown in the Middle Ages. There was thus a fine collection of the animal kingdom, completed bv a tethered goat of dignified demeanour, who ever and anon strained at his chain in an obvious effort to get at a copv of the script with the object of assimilating same. Like all good actors, he wanted to devour his part. A light interlude was rehearsed and taken. Sancho Panza entered upon his donkey, descended carefully, and stole to a table in the open. On a bench dozed the oldest inhabitant of Old Castile — the septuagenarian of Seville (Tom Waters). Sancho’s unerring instinct guided him to some pots of liquid on the rough board, and he softly sat himself beside the drowsy denizen of the village. Encouraged by the latter’s oblivion, he sampled the fluids before him with the gusto of a Brighton motor-coach passenger, until they were empty, and presently, at the old man’s awakening, simulated a snor¬ ing almost indistinguishable from the natural conversation of the adjoining swine. The venerable gentleman, misled by the snoring, discovered the absence of the pots’ contents, and Sancho, waking in a good temper, apologised for the pigs, rose,, and was assisted on the donkey’s back with some difficulty by Carrasco, now re¬ turned. As if this were insufficient in¬ sult to add to injury, the owner of the purloined cooling draughts had to endure the mortification of a close-up! Jack Cox “ turned ” on these drinking shots with a look which may have been either envy or conscientiousness. Mv attention was presently directed, however, to a regrettable action on the part of Mr. Elvey. For some reason (no doubt warranted by the exigencies of the scenario) he took pains to secure a near shot of the pigs grunting in unison. The process took some little time, and it pains me to state that the producer, in his en¬ deavours, went from persuasion and coax¬ ing to browbeating and something akin to bullying by shouting. As Bertram Bur¬ leigh, who voiced my views, pointed out, it is a matter of grave concern when a British producer, who is known to have a very proper prejudice against all film “ schools,” actually conducts one upon his own studio floor, and without an L.C.C. licence, too ! I must keep an eye on this encouraging of screen-struck animals, es¬ pecially as the Zoo now has a film studio of its own. Sancho’s ride off on the donkey, with his face to the tail, and in a state of nebulous bewilderment, would have de¬ lighted Walter West, who is always on the look-out for new racing film “ stunts.” I said as much to A. G. Poulton beside me, but I don’t think he took me very seriously. I had the privilege of a chat with 8 July 21, 1923 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO George Robey, C.B.E., in the staff can¬ teen, and while his curiosity and zest dur¬ ing the shooting were very evident, it was also interesting to learn how the popular mirth-monger is now studying films at first hand. Before departing, I discovered a curious and hitherto unsuspected department of the Stoll organisation — a crepe-hair section under the control of that experienced hirsute specialist and actor, Rolf Leslie, known to many of my readers as a sound player and deft beard-grafter, and now wisely retained for the purpose of make¬ up. When I want to fly the country I shall take the precaution to enlist Mr. Leslie’s- aid in the matter of disguise. By the way, the pigs set an example to many human players. When their day’s work on the set was over, they had to be forcibly removed, squealing loudly. Money to Burn ! Weird Effect of Mark’s Slump he wild slumps in the value of the German mark have caused many piquant incongruities, but it would be hard to beat an instance of the topsy¬ turvydom just to hand. In the studio of a well-known Berlin film producing company the story of the picture being made included a scene depicting an old miser with a pile of banknotes, which are burnt by his careless wife. The property-master used real 100-mark notes for the purpose, as it would have been much dearer to use imitation money ! Enough of Psychology. “ The world is sick of its twenty years’ surfeit of psycho-analytical literature, the morbid tyranny of sex-dissection which prevails in Great Britain and America, the farmyard philosophy of the Continental schools, and all the multi-headed forms of imaginative ugliness called Realism. It is doubtful if the world in general was ever in love with Realism. Realism is a symptom of disease in the body artistic.” — G. A. Atkinson- An Artistes’ Organisation ? rpHE feeling in favour of some associa¬ tion of film-players was certainly never stronger than at the present time. Such an association, it is safe to say, has for some time received some general sup¬ port in theory, and it is the practicability of its effectiveness and control which seems the principal obstacle. It is not the present mission of The Motion Picture Studio to take a stand for or against such a step, but whether any organisation of artistes becomes a reality or not, all artistes may be assured that we are always at their service for the expression of their views, whether indi¬ vidually or concertedly. Queenie Thomas, whose appearance as Lady Teazle in “ The School for Scan¬ dal ” is shortly to be made, is on a short holiday before commencing work on a new production.

Said the director at the sight Of heaving clothes and battered flesh, “ Now you must make up afresh.” Wanda Hawley Sails. As Capt. Calvert finished producing “Lights o’ London ” for Gaumont last week, Wanda Hawley sailed on Saturday for America and her home in Hollywood. It was hoped that she would have been able to stay to play in another film for the Gaumont Company, but pressing business in connection with the formation of her own producing company made her immediate re¬ turn necessary. Miss Hawley has been studying three stories whilst in this country, and production will be commenced on the first as soon as she gets back. Miss Hawley’s going was as swift as her coming. When she arrived here at the beginning of the yeai* she had just two. days in which to buy dresses and get ready for Egjrpt to play in “Fires of Fate.” Last week she finished working in “ Lights o’ London ” on Thursday, packed on Friday, and sailed on the Baltic on Saturday. Meanwhile, Nigel Barrie has also completed his engagement in “ Lights o’ London,” and his last scene should be a palatable reminis¬ cence. A visit to the docks concluded with a dive into the Thames, and Barrie had the unexpected luck to bite on a dead, black cat. When we saw him, three days later, he was still trying to get rid of the taste. 9 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO July 21, 1923 Where They Are — and What They Are Doing IVTARJORIE HUME has completed her part for “ M’Lord of the White Road ” (Granger-Davidson).

Craftsman v. Laboratory. A grievance among cameramen generally is the lack of co-operation and co¬ ordination between the photographer and the laboratory. Film-making is, after all, dependent upon good camera work, and if an experienced man is at the mercy of a firm of printers or a laboratory with no real reliability he often gets blamed for bad results which are not his fault at all. Cameramen are willing to be judged by the negative. Why should they be asked to run the risk of damaged nega¬ tives and inferior prints and incur the disapproval of those employing them in consequence ? It is well that in many cases the dark room is able ta co-operate with the cameramen. In our view such co-opera¬ tion should be recognised as an indis¬ pensable rule of picture-making. Suggested Change of Name ? 1 he name ** cameramen ’ ’ seems a mis¬ leading designation to some craftsmen we have lately spoken to. The complaint appears to be that it suggests a semi¬ casual labourer, instead of a skilled tech¬ nician, and that the status of camera experts suffers, both in repute — and finan¬ cially. G.

Elsie Ferguson Arrives Big Offer from British Company Reported Refused. rpHAT charming American star of world repute, Elsie Ferguson, has just ar¬ rived in this country. If rumour is true, she has already declined an offer of ,£,1,000 per week to play in a British picture. While admiring her talent and beauty, it seems rather an ironical situation that many British stars, whose gifts are surely not disproportionate, would jump at an offer of 1,000 shillings per week! 11 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO July 21, 1923 George Pearson to His Players An Unusual Procedure — and an Effective One /^HATTING with George Pearson the other day upon the big Islington floor, between shots of “Squibs, M.P.,” we were privileged to a peep at the script, and could not help being much struck by a characteristic expression of the pro- ducer’s personality in the form of a pre¬ liminary] prefatory foreword. Pearson informed us that he read the two pages aloud to his large assembled] company- before shooting the first foot. With some diffidence we begged leave to give them wider publicity, and Pearson at once, with a courteous alacrity, un¬ loosed the two pages, which are here re¬ produced for the benefit of our readers, who can hardly fail to> appreciate the help¬ ful .sincerity of their matjter and the thoughtful introspection of their sponsor. “Two Thoughts that came from desul¬ tory reading. “ I am a great believer in desultory reading. I often take a book at random, from my shelves and open at a random page with the avowed intention of finding one piece of wisdom that might assist me in the future — either in my life or my production, work. “As I finished1 the last page of this scen¬ ario', I turned in sheer desire for relief to' St. John Ervine’s article on Duse . . . and read . . . written by that professed hater of all things kinematic, these self- condemnatory words : “ * There are periods in this play when she enabled us to dispense with language. It was not necessary 'for uis to understand what she was saying, because we under¬ stood what she was feeling. MAY WE SAFELY ASSUME— That Maurice Elvev has never directed any donkeys until “ Don Quixote?” That Sidney Webber Northcote has at last achieved a definite release date? That German film-critics have a system of “ marks ”? That Elsie Ferguson will accept ^fio,ooo per week to star in British pic¬ tures ? That the heat wave may affect the “ costume ” boom? 1 hat Percy Nash has no connection with the Nashional film week? That Herbert Wilcox wishes the title “ Tons of Money ” had not been used? That the producers who go north have the laugh on those that go west? That producers will one day realise that casting is a trained man’s job? That Pauline Frederick is not making a trip to England for her health? “ ‘ The greatest feat which an actor can perform is to take an audience beyond the barriers of speech. ” “Is not this the task of the kinema, artiste all the time? “Again I picked up a book. It was Tolstoy’s ‘ Twenty-Three Tales.’ My fin¬ gers opened! a random page — the eye went to the last paragraph of the Tale of the Three Questions. I read : “ ‘ Remember then : there is only one time that is important — NOW ! It is the miost important time because it is the ONLY time when we have any power. “ ‘ The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with anyone else : and the most important affair is to do him good, because for that purpose alone was man sent into this life.’ “ Curious message from dead1 Tolstoy to us who stand1 at the threshold of a new film ! “ And surely we can take i't with us into each scene, even if it only be a close-up of five seconds. “ NOW is the most important moment in your life — you do not know if you will ever play another scene— and it is your duty to do it WELL.” (The following is a separate exhortation, delivered on the floor to the players at the outset of the day’s work.) The Characters of the Play. Beyond brief! v indicating my own con¬ ceptions of the characters, I do not wish to go. If I tell you the broad general character¬ istics of the type represented, I have done my part. To you as artistes, there comes your own interpretation of the niceties, the subtleties, the light and shade of the part. It is for you to give of your own genius. You have not only to be a mechanical interpreter or a puppet acting under guidance. Of all the questions that drive me to profanity is the one I so often hear in the studio — I think it comes often without thinking from the artiste — but come it does — “What do you want me to do?” When 1 hear that I feel limp. My courage goes. I know I have got to work a marionette, or inspire an artiste to endeavour by sheer education in film, appreciation- Obviously there are matters of time and movement, of tempo' and force that only the producer has the opportunity of know¬ ing, but if the artistes fully appreciate the full Contents of the little scene to be enacted — the things that have preceded the scene — the stage of development reached in the story, then surely that one little scene, even if but thirty seconds long, can become a little play by itself — if the ACTOR will rise to the part — and cut out of his phrase-book that terrible question : “What do you want me to do? ” The Producer is the man who -probably knows best how much or how little of the actor’s work is needed — he should know best whether the actor is handling his work in terms of screen language or forgetting in his enthusiasm that hi's future audience, for want of a better word,, will have ears but will hear NOT — but ^yes that will see all — mistakes a,s well as inspired effort. So, with this little foreword to the actors, I will read the play — in words — that you will PLAY to a DEAF theatre— and you will appreciate the individual characters by my reading — and you wi’I then mould them in the making by your own art — and I shall watch and guide and help, and never allow you to play to people WHO CAN HEAR AS WELL AS SEE. A Popular Novelist Gently Protests rpHE following are the views of Mrs. C. N. Williamson, whose novels have formed the basis of more than one film play. It represents an attitude with which we have (with a few reservations) the most cordial sympathy, and we can assure Mrs. Williamson that the condi¬ tions of which she reasonably complains are fortunately not universal, even in Eng¬ land : — “ I have no grudge against critics; far from it. I think they are splendid, long- suffering and patient men, so long-suffei- ing that their objection to ‘ happy end¬ ings ’ as being unnatural isn’t to be wondered at. But just now I think that most authors whose books are being filmed (myself among the number) have a grievance against the critics of moving pictures. As they know the game very well, surely they must know that the directors’ and scenario writers’ and ‘ con¬ tinuity writers’ one aim is to change the book they have bought for filming ; to take out all drama, naturalness and con¬ struction, to alter all motives __ and obliterate character, except, possibly in the ‘ star ’ part. Yet the critics will criticise the book as well as the play (though they may never have read the book) and con¬ demn it as being entirely unfit to be made into a motion picture. If the companies who buy the rights to film a book would ask the author to write out a rough idea of a scenario (not continuity, as that needs a trained specialist), might there not be some hope that now and then the author would be able at least to give a good idea for certain scenes and treat- ment for the trained scenario writer to work in? I quite admit that often the author’s stuff might be useless, but, on the other hand, there ought to be a few plums in it. And if critics knew that the authors had some hand in the game, then it would really be more fair to con¬ demn them for what was wrong — rather than now, wThen, as a rule, the only hand they have in the business is to wildly tear their hair with anguish. Don’t the moving picture critics know this, or is it iust that they suffer so much, they wish to make some Casually innocent creature also suffer? ” 12 July 21, 1923 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO That “Perfect Film-Face” Millimetres that Make Pretty TN an age of standardisation such as this, is it altogether surprising to find that beauty itself can be codified and reduced to terms of mathematical exacti¬ tude ? Some months ago we dealt with a re¬ markably candid outburst on the part of the exTlack-and-white artist, Penrhyn ■Stanlaws, now a picture director of repute who declared that every picture star fell short of beautv in some important feature •or other. He had the courage to name a large number of actual stars, with their respective shortcomings. Such hardihood is certainly lacking on the part of the author of a recent article in the Daily Graphic. The article is by “A Producer.” Who are these ‘‘pro¬ ducers ” who write articles in the lay Press? Whv don’t they sign their names? Or are they as shadowy as “A Hariev Street Physician ” and “ An M.P.,” who are always accessible to reporters ? These things are indeed mysteries. In any case there is no evidence that the article is not meant to be taken .seriously. If, indeed, it is intended facetiouslv, then •one may well be excused for not perceiv¬ ing any marked trace of humour in it. If the writer feels that our “ legs have been pulled ” by our taking it too seriously, we must content ourselves by the reflection that his own readers not only share our discomfiture, but are more likely to be affected by it than ourselves. We therefore will assume that he means what he says. Listen to him : “ Beauty alone is insufficient. A girl may be pretty and yet not be the owner of a photographic face, for there are cer¬ tain elements of bone-structure which the ■camera calls for that are missing in the faces of many beautiful women. As Per Specification. “ This is the formula : The lines of the chin must, when looked at squarely, form an obtuse angle. The distance from the point of the chin to the base of the nose must equal the distance from the tip or the nose to a point exactly between the eyebrows. Further, the distance from ear to ear over the forehead — measured with a tape measure — must equal the distance from the apex of the chin to the crown of the head. “ The nose should not protrude more than three-quarters of an inch, at the very outside, and the mouth, when in smile, should never be more than a fifth larger than the mouth in repose. The measure¬ ment of one eye should be the distance between the eyes, and the distance from the tip of the chin to the eyes should be equal to that from the eyes to the crown of the head. “ The top of the ear should be even with the evebrow, and the ear itself should be in such a position that a line drawn from the top of the head, straight down¬ ward, should indicate plainly where the ear joins on to the head. “ If you are so fortunate as to possess all these facial qualities, you will assuredly do well on the film— if vou can act.” An Impossible Ideal. We should think so, indeed. If every film-beauty had to fulfil these require¬ ments it would be almost impossible to tell one from another, and all personality as expressed Th individual beauty would be lost. However, if such a test for can¬ didates for stardom were in operation to-day, the screen would assuredly be without a single star. And this is the advice and information tendered to those readers of a daily newspaper who want to know the qualifications for a film-face ! The absurdity of the whole thing may be well demonstrated bv the imaginary conversation of two film magnates dis¬ cussing stars. First Magnate : “ What a jolly pretty girl Fruitie Marshmallow is ! The dis tance between her ears is only a sixteenth of an inch less than the distance between the apex of her chin to the crown of her head.” Second Magnate : “ She is certainly beautiful, but give me that little Helen Dammett — now, there’s a really charming face. I tested the top of her eyebrows with the tips of her ears with a spirit- level only yesterday, and she signed a year’s co.ntract this morning.” First Magnate: “Good1! By the by, have you seen the latest picture of Poor- lean Passay? She’s finished. Audiences have got wise to the fact that her mouth is 28 per cent, \"bigger when she smiles. Rome Off to Berlin Stewart Rome “ TM-IE Shadow of the Mosque ” is the title of a new picture to be made in a Berlin studio by Wainwright Pro¬ ductions, who have taken the interesting step of securing that very well-known British star, Stewart Rome, who thus will play in his second Continental picture since “ The Fires of Fate.” Rome seems indeed more of a meteor than a star these days, filming in Iceland,. Egypt, France and Germany ! The leading lady in the new picture is, as announced ex- clusivelv by us lately, Mary Odette. Maidens I’ve seen them taking observations in the theatre with sextants.” Second Magnate: “ Some of these girls nearly get away with it at times. One called on me on Friday. 1 thought she was the loveliest thing 1 had ever set eyes on, and full of character, too — until 1 got my tape-measure. Will you believe me when I tell you that that girl, who had the impudence to ask me for a part, measured from the point of the chin to the base of the nose over a quarter of an inch more than from the tip of the nose to a point exactly between the eye¬ brows? ” And so forth, and so on. Wny harp on this “ perfect-features ” obsession? Personality is as valuable an asset as in any other human qualification ; and what does personality imply if it excludes the idea of difference? There is at least one bright side to all this “ hokum,’ however. It may, after all, induce a certain number of screen- struck people to go over their noses and chins and temples with callipers and foot rules, only to conclude that they are un¬ suitable for the screen. It will probably not have this effect at all ; but let us hope that it may ! Kinema Club News Malcolm Tod was at the drums last Saturday, which was a French night (le quaiorze juillet).

The energetic new Secretary of the Kinematograph Spgrts Association, Mr. C. G. H. Ayres, of Wardour Films, 173, Wardour Street, is anxious to rope in Club members singly and in teams, and it is to be hoped that the Entertainments Committee and the Club will rise to the occasion.

Samuel- son — Scenario by Walter G Sum¬ mers — Photographed by Sydney Blvthe — Leading Plavers : Henry Vibart, Lilian Plall-Davis, Francis Lister. ri^HlS Samuelson picture is of the “ problem-play ” order, and its theme, althougn undoubtedly possessing strong dramatic values, fairly well ex¬ ploited, has a certain unsavoury side which makes it unsuitable as entertain¬ ment for every audience. Emphatically unfit for children to see, it has also a certain additional suggestiveness in its title, which (in a mucn less degree, of course) must be legarded as a bait for the prurient-minded, as in the case of “ Married Love,” recently made by the same organisation. Apart from this criticism, however, it has many indisputably good points. Its story is not watertight, its acting is not all good, and the characters not thoroughly sympathetic; but :ts dramatic strength is often most impressive ; it is capably directed through most of its footage, and the sequence flows smoothly. The story centres round a doctor who holds that the confidences of s patients are professional secrets to be held invio¬ late. He risks the powers of the law by stoutly refusing to disclose them as evi¬ dence in court. Shortly afterwards a girl comes to him in trouble, and he places her in his nursing-home until after her baby is born. After the baby’s death the girl begins life afresh. The doctor has a son who is the apple of his eye. Nothing pleases him more than the news one day that he is to meet the girl his son has decided to marry; and he wishes his dead and revered wife were alive to welcome her to their seaside home. The girl arrives with her lover, and instant recog¬ nition is mutual. The doctor has a pri¬ vate talk with her during the young man's absence. His public ideals are in danger of weakening, as he cannot bring himself to accept as a daughter-in-law the girl who has had a “ past.” She must tell the boy— or he will himself. A poignant scene ends in the girl rushing out of the house to the sea, where the young man presently rescues her after exciting and perilous efforts. The doctor has refrained from telling his son, who seems to suspect, but is happy with both girl and ' father. Much of the dramatic power lies in the preliminary court scene, the girl’s first trouble, and the recognition and following scenes. The improbability is the surprise recognition of the girl’s, as she surely must have been aware of the iclen t ity of her lover’s f Either. Her violent and heartless outburst against the doctor’s hypocrisy, and *he insult to his wife’s memory are also out of keeping with the girl’s nature, as previously shown. The story of her betrayal has two faults ; first. it is absurdly crude and unnatural for a I girl to marry such a bestial ruffian even to save a bad brother; and, secondly, her narrative, or most of it, must surely have been told the doctor when she first went to him in her trouble. The end is very conventional melo¬ drama, with an excessive footage of sea- rescue material on the baldest lines, but fairly well carried through. Nothing can be urged against the con. tinuity of Walter G. Summers. It is very even and capably balanced. A very sugary and tawdry senti¬ mentality creeps into the sub-titles at times, which must nauseate all but the “This persistent under¬ estimation of the perceptions and deductive powers of ordinary kinema-goers is keeping back the development of films. Producers should rely on the imagination of their public.” E. A. BAUGHAN. penny-novelette class of the public — and perhaps even ttiem. The word sub¬ poenaed ” is twice misspelt. Some good locations of land and sea¬ shore have been employed. The studio scenes, although not striking, except the law-court, are well mounted and staged. The photographs is good throughout. By far the finest performance is given by Henry Vibart, always a sound and restrained actor, who makes the very most of his opportunities in a very big part. His distinction lifts the whole pic¬ ture above ordinary melodrama. The other players suffer from the lack of moderation and U rung-down, probably on the part of the director.

Francis Lister is a natural and pleasant young lover, without any real chance for showing his capabilities. The court scene would have been perfect if Jerrold Robertshaw’s over-acting and mouthing, quite unnatural in a counsel, had been stopped by the director; when properly handled he is a splendid actor. Bert Darlev gives a good, brief perform¬ ance ; Moyna McGill is also good in a small part — but here again exaggerated sighs of relief in close-ups are annoying, though not her fault. Hugh Dempster’s is the best of the other performances. SUMMARY Direction : Good. ’Story : Strong and not too pleasant ; but not so suggestive as the title. Un¬ convincing in several places.

Is it carping to object to the Press reports of the conviction of Sydney Webber Northcote (reported elsewhere) in one little detail ? He is described as a “ film-producer.” This should be corrected. He has never made a pic¬ ture yet, and the industry disclaim him as a member of it. The title is ob¬ viously his own description of himself, which the authorities and Press ap¬ parently accept with the same readiness as they do that of other criminals who describe themselves as ” actors ” and “ film-actresses.” Can you Afford to miss ‘ The Motion Picture Studio ’ ?
