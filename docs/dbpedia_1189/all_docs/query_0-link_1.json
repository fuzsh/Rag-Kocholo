June 3, 1922 TO drop the editorial plural for a moment I wish personally to thank those numerous readers who have written or spoken their congratulations on the MOTION PICTURE STUDIO being in the position to celebrate its first birthday. Their kindly wishes and generous tributes to the work of this journal are keenly appreciated. It is exceedingly encouraging to know that the work done in this office is so highly valued, and I take this opportunity of assuring all that we shall spare no endeavour to contribute as largely as possible to the success of the kinema profession. * * * One Year Od. IT may sound rather egotistical but we cannot refrain from expressing our personal pride in the achievement of which the Motion Picture Studio can now boast. This journal is one year old ; and — we are proud to think — it is a sturdy, robust youngster, with all the enthusiasm, energy and initiative of youth. During the past year we may have been guilty of errors of judgment or in tactics — but youth is also the period of indis¬ cretions. One thing that will be allowed by even those few unimportant enemies that we have, and that is that the mis¬ takes in the past year were not due to wrong intent ; we have always tried to do what is best for the industry, and if we have failed in achieving any victory we have the consolation of knowing that we put up a good fight in the effort. * * * For the British. '\"THERE has never been — and this is another of our boasts — any possi¬ bility of doubt as to our policy. Firstly, we stood for the British film producing industry and its best interests. And this we never construed to mean that we should be for ever kicking the shins of the American and Continental film industry. We have always been con¬ vinced of the internationalism not merely of films, but also of the art of acting and film making. There are American directors in this country at this moment making films, but we do not conceive it our duty to do anything but give the Welcome Hand to such. There are British actors going to work in Swedish, French and German studios ; there may be Continental artistes come over here. This is not a matter for surprise or in¬ dignation. For the art of mime-acting is international. But this, notwith¬ standing, the Motion Picture Studio has been first, foremost, and fundamentally the official organ of the British industry. Such a journal has never before existed. Directors, artistes, scenarists, cameramen, and every other studio worker right down to the girls in the cutting room have hitherto been powerlessly inarticulate. FROM OUR NO. 1 ISSUE. Q \" The ' Motion Picture Studio ' will be the mouthpiece of all those concerned immediately in actual productions. It will devote itself solely to furthering their in¬ terests, and will in no way concern itself in the commercial side of the film industry. It is a paper for film artistes in the very widest sense of the word, and for them only. To help them, to make them more widely known to the producing industry, to watch their interests and to give them an outlet for their ideas and opinions.\" But for twelve months they have had a medium for expressing their ideas, aspira¬ tions or grievances. And this is all to the good of the industry. * * * Overcoming Difficulties. V2ECONDLY, we have made no ^ secret of our unbounded belief in the profession. The very act of starting this journal was a gesture of confidence. A year ago the business was in its darkest days — June, 1921, seemed the most in¬ appropriate date to launch a paper in the interests of the British film producing in¬ dustry. But the parent-journal — the Kine~ matograph Weefly — knew, by reason of its years of keen study of the business, that there were vast possibilities for success in the industry. And so the MOTION Picture Studio was bom. For the first few months even our inherent optimism was sorely tried. We were faced with an initial difficulty of our own creating, for we decided on a policy of making the Motion Picture Studio a professional paper solely. We were convinced that it is not good for the profession to let the public know too much about the inner workings of the craft. The charm of the film lies in its illusion. That charm must be preserved. A great blow was struck at the popularity of the stage when the public was let into “ Behind the Scenes ” secrets. The film must steer clear of that danger. And while we knew (from experience of the “ fan ” papers that are published from this building) that the public would eagerly buy the Motion Picture Studio if we gave it the chance, we deliberately decided not to give the paper a public sale but to keep it within the profession, That meant a somewhat restricted circulation (howbeit a more valuable circulation to our adver¬ tisers, who knew that they were adver¬ tising straight to the people they wanted), and so we had to base our hopes of success on advertisements. And near the end of the year we were in the enviable position of reporting that this policy was a success. To-day the MOTION PICTURE Studio is stronger and more powerful than ever. 5fC * A Valuable Goodwill. IN the brief space of a year we have 1 not only achieved success but have established a reputation that in itself is highly valuable. Those who know us and our methods best are the readiest to declare that the MOTION PICTURE STUDIO takes great care to be scrupulously honest. Our film reviews have spoken the truth about British pictures without having regard to the fact that those who merited adverse criticism ought be ad¬ vertisers in the paper. Nor have we hesitated to attack and condemn any element that we honestly believed could work to the hurt of the British industry. We have, we admit, been well established in our good position by the good fortune of having the unique organisation of the Kine. Weekly at our back. Because of this the Motion Picture Studio has been able to submit to its readers and its advertisers an excellent news and interest service together with an ideal adver¬ tising medium. And we may be forgiven from pointing out that if the MOTION Picture Studio had done nothing during its first year other than launch the Kinema Club, it would have fully justified its existence.

Edward staff of the “ Kinematograph Weekly and it is his daily duty to judge the W. A. Freshman, who has played so successfully in several British SOME time ago, in company with other film pressmen, I had to sit and listen while a prominent member of the Trade took ns severely to task for our prejudice against British Films. The burden of his complaint was that because a film was British therefore we handed out more than usually severe criticism ; whereas in his view the fact that a film was British ought, ipso facto, to ensure for it preferential critical treatment. Now both these views are fundamentally unsound. Anyone who thinks thus can take it from me that we are overjoyed if we see a good British film, and we lose no time in handing it bonquets. Watching as we do the unending flood of rubbish that passes across the modern screen we are delighted to be able to praise a good film at all ; but we are inclined to overpraise a good British film because, to tell the truth, we are getting a little tired of America, American stories, American atmosphere and American types. The British atmosphere is not a little refreshing to the somewhat homesick critic. But to pretend that all British geese are swans would, in the long run, do a grave disservice to the Industry we all want to help and foster. Why is it we see so few British films we can honestly praise ? It is not at all that we can’t make pictures here. “ Carnival,” ‘‘ The Adventures of Mr. Pickwick,” “ Demos,” \" A Romance of Wastdale,” '* The Fifth Form at St. Dominic’s,” are a few that occur to me at random, equal in every way to anything America has sent us, and far more welcome because of their British atmosphere and characterisation. Nor were the critics anything but lavish in their praise. Nevertheless let us remind ourselves of a few facts. Not long ago the boast was made that a Director had completed 65 reels in 65 weeks. When I see them projected I find no diffi¬ culty whatever in believing it. Again, it was acclaimed as something to be proud of that a full- length continuity had been written well inside 23 hours, 5 minutes and 2J seconds, or thereabout. Ye gods ! I’d have believed it if I’d been told he’d written it in the odd minutes and seconds. One could quote many similar facts, each of them pregnant with meaning in view of the question at the head of this article. The brutal truth is that there is less care and real workman-ship being put into 5-reel features to-day than went into the 2-reelers of ten years ago. In fact, most of the so-called “ features ” are only the 2-reelers inordinately ex¬ panded, and they don’t stand the strain. Choose your story on Friday, write the continuity on Saturday, cast on Sunday, start work on Monday, finish as soon as you can — or sooner — that, more or less, seems to be the rule. Can anyone wonder that something goes wrong ? Footage takes precedence over dra¬ matic values, economy is a cult instead of a virtue, and craftmanship is replaced by what is in reality mass production. These are some of the things that are wrong. Finance is regarded from the wrong end. The vital question seems to be ‘‘If we spend threepence in this scene will it show on the screen ? ” And if it can’t be seen by the spectator then the threepence is not spent. This is all wrong. The most valuable expenditure is, not infrequently, on things that are only seen indirectly by their general con¬ tribution to the whole result. , Far better to pay a long price for a sound, dramatic story, make it really worth an expert’s while to write a continuity that is something more than a mere sequence of events, allow a director sufficient time in which to exploit all the dramatic possibilities of his material and ACCORDING TO /\"HAT is wrong with British produc¬ tions? In the first place — story. It is noticeable that, in proportion to output, Britain uses more adaptations of novels and plays than any other country, and, even making allowance for material having run short, it is fairly evident that the in¬ dividuals who select the subjects for adapta¬ tion are not by any means experts at their job. The great majority of the subjects chosen for adaptation by British producing com¬ panies are almost totally unsuitable for screening and, even in the hands of expert scenario writers such subjects can only result in more or less strained and uncon¬ vincing picture-plays. Secondly— continuity. There are not, at the present time, more than three or four really expert continuity writers in this country, and these, having spent lean and laborious years in learning their business, not unnaturally expect a fair remuneration for their work. But there are a host of what one might describe as “half-baked” scenarists who, while understanding the elementary principles of continuity writing are not sufficiently expert to turn out anything like first-class work. But, since they only ask about one third (or even less) of the fee demanded by the expert, the producing concerns, from 'a totally mis¬ taken sense of economy, employ them in preference to the more expensive and more competent writers. This results in ragged continuity and loss of dramatic values through inefficient exploitation. Thirdly — casting. In casting a production the British producer is almost invariably actuated by three motives — cheapness, name, and suitability of type. A player with a name is cast for a character totally unsmted to his talents; another player is selected for a part, suitable or otherwise, solely because the salary expected is small; another is given a part because he or she '°°t* the type, entirely irrespective of capability to -play it! 1 4 A SCENARIST Fourthly — hurry. A subject is selected, talked over, and discussed for months. Then (if, as is often the case, it is not scrapped at the last moment and another one selected) it is suddenly decided that it must be done at once , and, without any apparent reason, everything thereafter is done with a rush. The scenarist gets a week or ten days to do a month’s work, the casting is rushed through in a couple of days, the location man is lucky if he gets as long to do his “spotting ” in, and the actual pro¬ duction is scheduled out so that so many hundred feet of good, bad, or indifferent material must be shot each day — thus a production which might be efficiently done from A to Z in three months is slap-dashed through in one. That it is more or less spoiled in the doing does not appear to matter one iota! Fifthly— cutting. Injudicious cutting will spoil the most painstaking efforts of even the most expert scenarist, director and players, and yet almost every British pro¬ ducing firm is apt, usually at the last moment (after the director’s official cut), to hand the film to their junior office boy with instructions to cut so many feet out, with the natural result that what may, up to then, have been a reasonably good pic¬ ture, emerges from the operation a ragged and often almost meaningless jumble of fragmentary episodes, loosely connected by (usually) hastily and badly written titles! (I could name some notable instances of this sort of thing which have occurred in connection with my own work.) To sum up. The key-faults in British producing are carelessness and extrav¬ agance. As an example: to spend a thou¬ sand pounds on the rights of an unsuitable story and fifty pounds on an inefficient scenario is the grossest form of extrav¬ agance, and to allow anyone but the director . or the scenarist to make the smallest cut m the completed film is sheer carelessness. The British producing organisations should adopt and take to heart two mottoes: A thing worth doing is worth doing well ! ” and “Never spoil the ship for a ha’porth of tar. — Wm. J. Elliott. June 3, 1922 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO — W R O N G WITH FI L M S ? so ; so it must be so. And if it is so it is wisest and best for the of the trouble. The truth can never harm. And it is best to know Paradise. To this end we have invited three gentlemen to record their Thompson, who writes the first article, is a Press critic on the review values of films. William J. hlliott, the well-known scenarist, and films, write from the angle of the scenarist and artiste respectively. give some attention to character drawing, than to fling money away on lavish sets that in most cases means pinching and scraping on everything else and which emphasise this false economy when the film is complete. Now all these are things that can be remedied, granted a little foresight and imagination. “ Nothing Else Matters ” showed what could be done by simply studying detail, characterisation and atmosphere. What money was ex¬ pended on “ Four Men in a Van,” was given to essentials and not for the sake of giving work to carpenters. And for sheer poignant drama and true comedy no country has ever excelled these two productions. Let us dig still further down and tell the truth though the Heavens fall. While good directors are handicapped on every side by the films they are called on to direct and the conditions under which they have to work, a good many stories are equally handicapped by the fact that their Directors are men who would be much better employed in weighing out sugar and cutting up bacon. And between the upper and the nether millstone many otherwise competent actors and actresses are ground into mediocrity. What is wanted more than anything else is the infusion of real artistry and dramatic understanding into British film production ; not the mere artistry of technique and mechanical detail, but the vision of artistic conception and treat¬ ment of an idea. Not the mere dramatic exploitation of incident, but the true drama of character with incident as a moulding force. The tragedy is that Briti h film production is in the main fatally content to remain in the rut. The hope for the future arises from the fact that there is no real obstacle in the way of success. I mean no real obstacle in an artistic sense. As I have implied, there is an obstacle, and a big one, commercially. It is obvious in British films themselves, even to those who dp not know the fact firsthand, that the financial control of British productions is very largely in the hands of men who have only the faintest conception of the nature of the business they are engaged in. It is obvious in continuities which with one eye shut, one can see to be the work of inadequately paid and badly hurried scenarists, in details of production which simply shout false economy to the spectators, and in stories which only too plainly have been screened for any reason but the only one that should count- — the fact that they are really suitable to screen presentation. So that when I say that the infusion of real artistry and dramatic under¬ standing into British productions is a vital need, though I seem to be blaming all the craftsmen directly engaged in production for the present general lack of these qualities I am quite prepared to admit that perhaps the real responsibility should be placed on the shoulders of the man further back — the commercial chief who decides what shall be filmed, at what cost and under what conditions. In order to get better directors and better artistes — or the best out of the directors and artistes already in the business — it is probable that we should first concentrate on getting better managing directors. Certainly a fundamental change in the whole attitude of the business chiefs of the industry is necessary if we are ever to see production in this country rise even to the same level as in America — which is by no means the highest possible, or even the highest attained by present day producing concerns. They have got to learn real values and to sacrifice some cherished illusions in the process. ACCORDING TO 1Y/TAINLY I would suggest a lack of esprit A de corps in those brought into contact with each other in course of film produc¬ tion — a spirit which characterises Swedish productions more than any others of which I can think — the art of directing for art’s sake, and acting so that one’s portrayal of a character blends with the remaining characters, making the film move more smoothly towards its ultimate end. The director should be at heart an actor, so that, while allowing his artistes to characterise their own parts, he would be able to prevent them from just overdoing therm. He should have the eye of an artist, and with an artist’s ready perception be able to appreciate the light and shade, the delicacy of pathos, the immensity and grandeur of drama, or the light and airy gracefulness of easy moving comedy in each scene, and yet keep that scene in subordina¬ tion to the whole, and, in so doing, obtain that smoothness of action so necessary to the perfect film. He should have the brain of an architect, so that the composition of each scene would be perfect, that there would be nothing to detract the attention of the viewer from the action, that there would be nothing out of place on a set, and so that the set would be a reflection in itself of the char¬ acter of the man supposed to live in it. He would, further, endeavour to get con¬ trast for the force of contrast is a far greater weapon than any sub-title. Take, for example, a masterpiece by a man who is generally regarded as the world’s greatest director — D. W. Griffith’s “ Orphans of the Storm.” Griffith will cut from a great ballroom scene to different views of the architecture of the set, showing the richness of the mouldings or the hang- AN ARTISTE ings, all to illustrate how the aristocracy spend their money whilst the poor starved In this way he gets his contrast. Yet Griffith does this without seeming to interrupt the progress of his film, because he makes it part and parcel of the film; there is no sudden break to detract from the full story value ; always first in his mind he seems to keep the theme. Therein lies the secret of his greatness as a director, to my mind : the mental capacity for grasping the actual truths of the idea involved and the ability to introduce the unexpected without a sudden jar to thp continuity and without a nasty shock to the spectators’ run of thought. Now as regards the artistes, I would like to suggest that the perfect film will not be created on the star system. No one character should be brought to the fore and kept there merely because he or she possesses a well-known name. An artiste should hold the centre of the screen only so long as is absolutely necessary to the action of the story; so also should the length of each part be deter¬ mined; also the degree of strength with which it is acted. Wherefore everything should be decided by the story, or more especially the theme of the film. Let it be like some great pivot, with all else revolving around it and yet in ratio to it — scenarist, director, artiste and cameraman, the four people who make the film. For the theme of a film, is of greater value than the star. Do not think for one moment that I am suggesting that British directors and artistes lack the foregoing virtues (for virtues they most certainly are), that is not meant. What I am driving at is, that all must work together to form one harmonious whole; all must accommodate themselves to the main theme before we can hope to attain the millennium of film production. — W. A. Freshman. 5 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO June 3, 1922 defying comparison by Henry Victor. DURING the existence of the Motion Pictuke Studio a good many dis¬ cussions have taken place, and a recurring subject has been the British film artiste in comparison to his cousin, the American. Why and how is it the American film stars are generally considered our superiors? Is it brains, ability, temperament, or the money behind them? Most people put it down to one or two of these reasons, but as far as the artiste is concerned the cause is attributed to temperament. It deserves ridicule to state that we lack temperament or ability or brains. What we do not consider sufficiently is finance on a commercially good and sound basis. If the right and proper people, artistes in their art, were only supported adequately, assisted by business peqple, who are far-sighted enough and do not wish art absolutely sacrificed to commercialism, then the whole outlook would be brighter. The completed work would benefit as much as the artiste concerned. To return to the subject of my article, I will endeavour to convince with facts, which severe critics almost continuously overlook, why it is so unfair to compare British with American artistes on the same hard and critical lines. It is a well-known fact that in the States stars are created by sheer force of support. The finest and best talent is first discovered and then treated and nursed. Let us take our eternal master and tutor— Nature — as an example. The seed of an orchid is to look at, presumably, a most insignificant object, but what wonderful, and to us, mysterious, powers are hidden within — only to be brought out by a force adequate to its properties. Plant it in the surroundings demanded by nature, give it the chances essential to its natural de- velopment and you will bring forth the beauty and glory, which even the eye of the most unobserving and phlegmatic in¬ dividual cannot pass without being drawn to it with admiration. Transplant this same seed into a soil, contrary to the demands prescribed by nature, do not observe all the rules laid down for its progress, and what do you get? So it is with the human being in every case and in every sphere of life. Talent in artistes is a mysterious and hidden power and necessitates the same mysterious power — talent — to be brought out to the utmost. In this way the American star is created and nursed; the director, the cameraman, the scenario department, as a matter of fact all concerned, are working hand in hand and are guided by the one aim, to create and to let the subject of their creation shine to the best advantage. If I could onjy say that we had the same basis to work on in England, there would be no reason why forty to fifty per cent, of American stars — Englishmen — were made in the States and not in their own country. Give us the same chance, facilities ' and support and then compare. STORY VERSUS STAR b'j Muriel Alleyne. LL the money lavished on production will not improve the British photoplay, if co-operation is not the first and foremost factor in the making of them. The war has set the clock back in the British Industry, and it is for all of us in every branch of the Trade to put our shoulders to the wheel and work hand in hand to make our pictures the best in the world, and to capture the markets in our vast Empire, getting the capitalists in our Overseas Dominions to interest themselves in showing British films to British subjects, but these films will have to be of a high standard, and aim still higher at perfection, to hold the position they have obtained. We have a beautiful country for our back¬ grounds, and we are rich in history and noble ideals, we have produced writers and poets of great literary talent, but in the words of our immortal Shakespeare, we must realise that “the play’s the thing.” A good story is worth more than a good star or a much advertised director, but how are the Scenarists treated by the Industry? They have been made the Cinderellas long enough, their works in many cases have been tampered with by the director and mutilated in the cutting-up room, and the door of the studio is barred against them. Original scenarios submitted to firms are in most cases never seen by the heads of those firms or intelligent directors. I know of one film director who has done excellent work, who told me that when a few scenarios had been selected by the reading staff, they were put before the board of directors (men finding the money but with no film knowledge at all), yet if this film director, with his experience and judgment, could have selected a play, it would have been of benefit to the firm and their pockets. We know quite well that there are hun¬ dreds of badly written and impossible scenarios submitted to firms and it is necessary to separate the goats from the sheep, but when they have properly written work sent in, it should at least be read — not the synopsis only, but the finished scenario — by the man at the wheel. Money spent in buying a good story is worth more to a firm than a good star, and as Mr. Smith, of Goldwyn’s, says, “You can always put over a picture directed by an unknown and not featuring any big names, if the story is good.” But how is the screen play writer treated to-day? He is kept in the background, and, alas, often robbed of his ideas. For Heavens sake, let us have co-operation. Bring the most promising free lance scenario writers together, let a director of experience and sound judgment, a man who has really done something, tell them what is wanted, let the heads of firms say what they want and' I believe they will have a response. Don’t try to copy other countries, have the courage as they say in Lancashire to “stand on your own pins,” be original, and re¬ member that the director cannot make a good picture if the story is bad. The artistes can do -their best but will not save it. The cameraman may give us quality but he is helpless. Encourage your scenario writers, treat them like white men, pay them well because it will pay you, because you are going to make them co-operate in your great work. Indifferent treatment of the backbone of the Film Trade, the scenario writer, is, I think, what is wrong with British productions, and remember “The Play’s the thing-” THE YEAR’S LESSON by Challis N. Sanderson. DURING the last twelve months many producing organisations have begun to realise that a film from the time of pass¬ ing the scenario must be a commercial proposition. British productions with very little exception have had, and continue to have, a limited market, and a certain nominal figure is the most that can be obtained in the United Kingdom. Here arises the question of foreign sales. Yes, surely, but how many British pro¬ ductions have been sold to America or anywhere else? A very small percentage on our gross output. A very few years ago it was considered wise to expend as much money as possible, and to advertise your result as a “so many pounds ” production, plus so many artistes, etc., etc. This may have been all right from an American point of view, where all sales outside the U.S.A. are net profit, but when you estimate a British super production with its sales say limited to the United Kingdom where there are only 5,000 theatres, you will have to book your subjects to every hall, and at a good price to guarantee a return or even a covering. So much for big stuff. Producing companies are, therefore, be¬ ginning to revert back to making the short subjects which placed the kinematograph Trade on the high plane it was, until the craze brought in hundreds of people who knew little or nothing about films (and did not want to know), but who imagined that Wardour Street was a second Klondike. These people with their pig-headed inex¬ perience are partly responsible for the slump, and for keeping out the capital which the pioneers used judiciously. Another reason for making shorter sub¬ jects is that the two-feature program, which is so prevalent at many houses, is not liked by the public. Out of seven picture palaces which I have attended during the last fort¬ night, the most interesting item was the news gazette. The five and six reelers could easily have been cut down to one or at the most two reels, without injuring the story; in fact, it would have improved it. Occasionally one sees a big picture which justifies the amount of footage, but again the most successful of these are eighty per cent, action, with the other twenty per cent, pictorial and effect, the latter carefully intermingled so as not to be boresome. “Way Down East,” and “Orphans of the Storm,” are examples, and in neither of these does one find high-brow matter. The public is tired of seeing a person walkifig aimlessly along, for, say, fifty feet. The majority want melodrama and good comedy, although they will not admit it. Take the most successful pictures (from a commercial point of view) analyse them, and you will find they are melodramas and comedies. You certainly cannot estimate as much profit on a one-reeler as on a five, but in most cases where a contract is arranged with a renting house beforehand, the returns are quicker and more certain. Also any real investor would rather have fifty pounds profit guaranteed than five thousand pounds probable, which has been “promised” on more than one occasion. We, in the film Trade, do not get our capital from Wardour Street, and we there¬ fore must show our prospective investors more than a gilt-edged security; that is if we want to continue and not close down altogether. The most beautiful and artistic picture in the world is no earthly use unless you can sell it. Money is to be made out of films for the investor as well as the producer, and I think I am right in saying that more money has been spent on films during the comparatively short time they have been in existence, than in any other business. I. myself, have only directed a few pic¬ tures, but I guarantee that not one of them has been a loss to the investor. I am out to make money for myself and for the people who employ me. ' If you play fair with your investor, he’ll remember you; if you don’t, he’ll certainly remember you but there won’t be “another time.” Do not cease making big pictures altogether, as many stories justify and de¬ mand five or six thousand feet, but do carefully consider your scenario and market beforehand.

It is more than double tiie usual size, and I strongly advise readers to be sure to read every page, including the advertisements. You will find much interest and valuable information in the announcements in the advertising pages. Last week I referred to Hal Martin’s accident, and Victor McLaglen, who has returned to London after finishing the sea scenes in “ A Sailor Tramp,” writes to give me fuller details. He says : “ During the closing scenes afloat I had to chase one of the crew (a part which was played by Hal Martin) up the rigging to a yard-arm, from which position he had to jump1 eighty-six feet into' the sea. Hal Martin bravely volunteered to do' the jump instead of an actor whose courage failed him at the last moment. Martin jumped, but unfor¬ tunately seriously hurt himself on striking the water. We rescued him and brought him back to the ship, and made a hasty return to Falmouth, where he now lies in a serious condi¬ tion at the Nursing Home. This is the: first bad accident I have witnessed during my film career, and I assure you it was a very unpleasant one.” Qn this page is a photo of H. B. Parkinson, managing director of Master Films, Ltd. Under his management Master can show an out¬ put for the last year of sixty reels, including the now famous “ Tense Moments ” and “ Song Pictures.” These struck a new and wise note in film production, and it is to the credit of H. B. that a British firm was far¬ sighted enough toi see that the kine- golng public would demand short films. In addition to guiding- the destinies^of the company Mr. Parkinson has directed the production of most of the firm’s output; he is one of the few who are a; successful combination of artistic and commercial faculties. w illiam Fox, the famous American film magnate, is over in this country and has purchased the rights of the popular novel “ If Winter Comes,’’ which will be made into a film for the Fox people. All the exteriors will be made in this country, and so deeply interested is Mr. Fox in the filming of “If Winter Comes ” that he himself will confer with Mr. Hutchinson, its author, on the scenario, and will make a personal visit to all the locations which he plans to utilise for backgrounds in this pro¬ duction. The1 film rights of this novel were purchased by William Fox for what is estimated to be a record figure for a novel.

The past week has been considerably brightened by the fact, that several artistes have been cast to play in “ Rob Roy,” the next big Gaumont film. David Hawthorne is to be Rob Roy, Wallace Rosco has one of the leading parts, Olaf Hyttem is also in H. B. Parkinson. the cast, together with Alec. G. Hunter (the typical Scot !) who- is to play the picturesque part of the Dugaf Crater. Maurice Thomson, who has appeared with, success in a number of leading boy parts, is wondering if he has to wear kilts for his part in the film, for although he has been booked for the film the details of his dress have not yet been given him. Think of little Maurice, David Hawthorne and Alec. G. Hunter as a group of kilties! I understand that the remainder of the cast will be fixed within a day or two, and the whole company will go to Scotland at the beginning of June. It is interesting to> note that in the selection of David Hawthorne for Rob Roy Gaumont is evidently determined upon making Rob Roy as heroic and physically attractive a person as possible. The real Rob Roy, with his short body and long arms which reached below his knees, was not at all attractive, but the part has always been played on the stage, even in Scotland, by a big handsome man, and Will ’ Kellino, therefore, has theatrical tradition to support his departure from history. The choice is wise from the entertain¬ ment point of view. The builders have been hard at work for over a week erecting the various buildings which will be required for the produc¬ tion in Scotland, and the only reason that the company1 is not going- up earlier is that it will take a full month to get the buildings erected. I learn that the: castlei will be quite an imposing affair about, 90 ft. long by- over 40 ft. high, and 30 to> 40 ft. deep. 1 h is is, of course, considerably larger than the original Inversnaid Fort, which it is to represent. The enlarge¬ ment has been decided upon lor photo¬ graphic: effect and so that the building shall not be too much dwarfed by the surrounding1 hills. Owing to the extra pressure: on our space, due to the importance of this Anniversary Double Number, we have been compelled to hold over the f opr th article of the “ Saving the Situation ” series and the second of /Colonel Barron’s series on “ Histrionics as a Science.” Both these series will be resumed in our next issue, together with the “ Where they are and what they are doing ” feature, which has had to be suspended this week for the same reason. Adrian Brunei and Miles Mander wish me to state that it was not owing to' events in Morocco that they severed their connection with Solar Films (as suggested in last week’s Motion Picture Studio), but owing to events A which took place in England | whilst they were in Morocco. 7 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO June 3, 1922 the two new WALTER WEST PRODUCTIONS “ Scarlet Lady” By J.

There’s a shadow right across the top, but yet it’s not alto¬ gether a shadow. Seems to have a shape. In fact, it seems to be shaping ■ Let’s try a bit more.” Presently, another half-dozen pictures de¬ veloped, he looked again, and gave a loud shout. “Good God, Guv’nor,” he said, “it has got a shape. It’s a sled crossing a snowheld. There’s one man walking by .the dogs and another. . . .” He broke off and passed the strip to the director, who held it to the faint red light. As he lifted his eyes and looked to the cameraman, his hands shook and his face was very grey. Ik /W eoffrey Weis ton was more pitied than liked by his fellow artistes. Pie was an exceptionally fine actor, but he was sombre and apt to fall into fits of moroseness. Then, too, he had a queer habit of glancing swiftly over his shoulder which was rather discon¬ certing at times. His sombreness was excusable, aird it was because of the reason for it that he was pitied. Many years before he had taken to film-playing he had adventured about the world with a friend, and they had been inseparable. There was a very deep affection between, them, and a mutual love of the wilds and of roving. They had gone into the Alaskan gold rush, these two, and, at the end of their hope and their resources, had made a big strike. In a few weeks, from hapless adventurers they became rich men — so wealthy that they were scarcely able to calculate how much they possessed. So they set out for civilisa¬ tion and home. With dog-sled and all their new-won gold they set out to cross the snow desert that linked the bitter struggle of the mining camp with the sweet softness of white lights and fair towns. But Welston came back alone — with his feet frostbitten, half his dogs gone and a strained, broken look behind his weary eyes. It was a heartbreaking story he had to tell, but a story that was only too common cn that cruel trek. They1 had struck blizzard upon blizzard ; their food had given out ; they had killed most of the dogs for food — • but Welston ’s partner had not been able to struggle through. Cold, hunger, snowblind- r.ess, fever — and a little mound above a hol¬ low scraped in the frozen snow. That was the story of the journey, save that Welston did not tell the rest : how he had stumbled, dazed and weary, on and on till he won through, almost too late. * * * “ \"YXHiat do you think it is? ” said the cameraman to the director, as they sat the next morning in the latter’s room examining the complete take. “There are more things • . .” began the director, then paused. “There is an explana¬ tion, if you believe in the genuineness of spirit photogtaphs. Not the spiritualist ex¬ planation, but the idea that strong thought produces actual forms that can only be seen FROZEN by FRANK by psychics . . . and the lens of the camera.

If it makes no impres¬ sion on him beyond arousing his interest and curiosity, we shall know. But if it produces another effect we . . . shall also know.” Later in the afternoon the star, with his director and the cameraman, was seated in the little projection room attached to the studio. It was not unusual for Welston to be invited to see shots run through, so he accepted as a matter of course when he had been asked over lunch to see this one. Through the dead blackness of the room shot the violent ray from the projector, and with a soft purr the picture rippled on the screen. It was a series of close-ups, pictures of varying shades of emotion as the character — played by Welston — was falsely accused, and later tried, for murder. But presently across the clearness of the picture, across the hunted eyes of W elston and his wrinkled brow there came a shadow — a shadow that moved and became more distinct till it was a dog-sled crossing a waste of snow. Up at the head of the dogs one man plunged and stumbled, with head bowed to the whirling blizzard. Upon the pile on the sled lay another man, very still. But pre¬ sently he moved, slowly and deliberately till he was almost sitting. Somewhere in his bundled and shapeless clothing he fumbled, then\" raised his right arm. A puff of smoke swirled away just beyond his hand ■ . . and the man leading the dogs stumbled more heavily for a moment, then fell headlong across the foremost dog. Down from the sled jumped the other figure, and after a glance at the fallen man began feverishly to scratch a hole in the snow. Larger the hole grew till it looked like a grave. Then he turned back to the sled and to what had once been his partner. . There was a strangled scream, and Wel¬ ston stumbled across the darkness to the screen, tearing and clawing feverishly, furi¬ ously at the wall. '“I didn’t — I didn’t — you — why have you come back? ” The light came on with a snap, and the director anpl cameraman were on their feet. Welston turned, and the final evil of guilty madness was in his face. He made a rush, and the director swung a chair above his head in readiness. But Welston halted, as a pointer halts— suddenly and stiffly. “Go back,” he screamed, “I know what vou have come for. All the time, ever since 1 killed you and buried you in the frozen snow you have waited. But you shan’t do it, you shan’t” .... And his hand fumbled at his vest pocket. Suddenly he threw his head back and struggled with his shoulders and tore at his collar. His breath came in strangled gasps, and his face grew livid. It was as if he fought with Something — Something which the others could not see. Then slowly he crumpled into a heap on the floor and lay very still. * * * “ TJeart failure, undoubtedly,” said the doctor, “but I have never seen the face so congested before. It is almost as if he had been strangled. And those five curious marks round his throat. Quite like spots of frost-bite. A most unusual case. Great pity . . . Clever fellow, wasn’t he? ” The director and the cameraman looked at each other and shuddered— even though the film had already been put deep into the studio furnace- 9 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO June 3, 1922 WE HAVE PRODUCED 60 FIVE MONTHS ALL OF WHICH 1C ONE-REEL SONG STORIES, 1U “FAMOUS SONGS OF LONG AGO.” Acquired by BRITISH EXHIBITORS FILMS, LTD., 8-9, Long Acre :: :: LONDON, W.C. 2. 1 O ONE-REEL DRAMAS, 1 * “ TENSE MOMENTS WITH GREAT AUTHORS.” Acquired by BRITISH EXHIBITORS FILMS, LTD., 8-9, Long Acre :: :: LONDON, W.C. 2. 1 9 ONE-REEL MODERN SONG STORIES.

(“ Motion Picture Studio ANGLO- SWEDISH CO-OPERATION by JOHN TORNEQU 1ST When the Swedish film industry looks to England to establish a co-operation of producing films, it is nothing to be astonished about; it is just England which Victor' Seostrom has been thinking of wnen he. while still maintaining the national character, wants to give the Swedish film a super-national character and in some way internationalise it. We are of the opinion that the English¬ men's view of things is the same as cur own, and we stand in a closer contact with the island people than with, for instance, the Germ;ans. It is ‘the responsibility, the seriousness, and the. correctness of the Eng¬ lish character which attracts us and which always has served as a model for the Swedes in general. W hat here is said about the English nation may just as well apply to the English actor. He has something in his appearance which makes a sympathetic impression on a character like ours. About six months ago the English film “Carnival” was given, with Matheson Lang as leading man. It was a piece of acting standing on a high level, which was very much appreciated. His Othello was human and intelligent, and when we later saw the prominent German actor, Emil Jannings, in the part of a Moor in a German Othello film we were unable to avoid making comparisons, which are absolutely to the favour of the English actor. Matheson Lang is this summer going to play the leading man in a great film directed by Victor Seostrom. It is a film with points cf contact with “ Carnival,” a drama of jealousy. The acting artistes may belong to any nation. When Matheson Lang now, for the first — let us not say the last — time nuts his talent in the service of the Swedish film, on Swedish ground (as the film is going to be played in Sweden) he plays a part which is worthy of him. Matheson Lang is the first instance of the co-operation which the Swedish film trade wants to establish more and more intimately with England. In the summer we trust to be able to engage another artiste — an Eng¬ lish actress. SEAL FILMS PROGRAM The Seal Company’s intention is to pro¬ duce, approximately, four features during inis year. They will be on the lines of the last three productions, “ Dick’s Fairy,” “ Jessica’s First Prayer,” and “ Little Meg’s Children.” Bert Wynne is convinced that the morbid type of film now being pro¬ duced and shown in this country must ulti¬ mately harm ihe British Industry, and with this in mind W. Millward and T. H. Davies are determined to place on the British screen stories that will appeal to all classes and ages. It is the intention of Seal to engage legiti¬ mate screen actors only for forthcoming pro¬ ductions, as it is convinced that they have a much ’ greater appeal to the provincial audi¬ ence, who, in Seal’s opinion, are the best judges of the British films to-day. JJjXCEPTINCi through the medium of the Press, in the form of Trade news and occasional notes, not very much is known to British studio- Workers of what goes on amongst their very near¬ est foreign neighbours and friends. Film importers and dealers generally know most; but British directors and artistes know practically nothing, owing to lack of contact. There could be nothing more desirable in the interest of kinematc- grapihy in Europe, than something in the nature of a rapprochement between the British and the French film indus¬ tries. It is safe to affirm that such would be welcomed on both sides. The possibility of such a union of com¬ bined interest and action could only come about if it were found that effective com¬ mercial relationships could be estab¬ lished. Mutual interest in kinema, art 'alone would (no* ble effective . The whole-hearted support of the great financiers on both sides of the Channel is needed, and they, as business men, would Want to know the possibilities, and profitable ones at that, of an interchange of British and French films, of “cross- 0, vers” and mutual workings between directors, artistes, cameramen and all concerned on both sides. Sometimes the wail is sent up, both in England and in France, that the film industry does not receive the financial support that it ought to have. This is rather a digression from the main theme of this article, but it will serve to show that conditions in France are similar to those in England. Both countries are working in film production under diffi¬ culties. The big financiers, always ready to put money into profitable enterprises -rather than ventures of a speculative nature, re¬ main practically unmoved. The reason that the British financiers remain impas¬ sive may probably be because they think that, even on a small scale (as one judges a cloth by examining a little sample), the films produced by the various companies in the industry do not appear to have a quality likely to bring adequate returns for a heavy financial outlay. The brilliant exceptions are few and far between. The British film, judged ’’ Representative in Paris) by the standard of production of other nations, is regarded by these financiers as being very largely in the experimental stage, and, in the meantime, they know that they can place their money more profitably in other industries. They are not patrons of art, but money-makers. Such, at any rate in France, is prob¬ ably the real explanation of the lack of financial support. Financiers have not yet sufficient faith in the film producers’ genius, capability as producers, and head for business. They know that .the direc¬ tors’ idea is generally to spend money. A financier never spends money ; he makes use of it. Financial embarrass¬ ment curtails expansiveness, and tends to conservatism. So the French industry keeps much to itself. In P'rance, the general situation is much the same as in England, only that there would appear to be rather more activity. PYench business men in the film industry (I am not thinking of big financiers) are rather mono speculative than the English, and, when they pull through, their reward is great. One of them has recently given his orders for the production, and that on a generous scale, of (about a /dozen films, jail of which will probably be finished this year. It is a large and risky outlay; but the chances are much more for than against success. It is the practice of several of the French film producing companies to make the director (or directors) take a percentage of his, or their, earnings out of the profits on the exploitation of the film or films. They sometimes leave the entire work of ordering the construction of settings, the hiring of costumes and properties, etc., to the producer; and he is made responsible for his opinions upon the selection of artistes and their con¬ tracts with the producing company. Thus the director’s inclination (very strong in an artist, as such is credited with being), to “ splash about ” with other people’s money, is curtailed ; for he knows that if the company should lose upon the nroduction, so does he himself. His artistic soul is kept to earth by busi¬ ness conditions, and, while he really has a free hand, less money is wasted. FLORENCE WOOD Now at Liberty for Sta&e or Kinema.

TITLES Are printed or hand-written the best ? by FRANK KEYES 7\"HY this mistaken idea that the printed letter is so infinitely superior to hand¬ lettering by a competent man? It does not seem to be generally realised that every drawing, design and letter which appears in print first has to be drawn by hand. (There is no machine that will design and draw.) The drawing or lettering has then to be reproduced by a more or less mechanical process, usually involving photography (process reproduction). Modern process reproduction has attained a very high level of quality. It is possible, nowadays, to reproduce a design very faith¬ fully — in fact, the reproduction in some cases may be almost as good as the original. With a printed title you have all the lack of elasticity which is inseparable from a mechanically repeated form — and a more or less imperfect reproduction of what is originally a hand-drawn type. In other words, your lettering is second-hand, with the following handicaps (among others) : — (1) Each letter, being on its own piece of type, makes any “ locking ” or overlapping of the type almost impossible, and severely limits the employment of decorative flourishes or other ornaments. (2) Uneven “ spacing,” both in (a) the body of individual words, and (b) in the general “ layout ” is almost inevitable. Obvious examples of -(a) occur always in such words as : BUILT AVAILABLE VACCINATION when set in capitals. Minor instances are just as jarring to a discerning eye. (3) It is a very difficult matter to obtain a really good “black and white” from a printed title, because : (a) In the case of using the negative as the positive, and taking a black on white title, the “ halation ” and “evening lighting” difficulties crop up; (b) the titles must be printed on boards owing to the pressure required to transfer the white lettering ; (c) it is not yet possible to print a really clean-edged, photographically white letter on a matt black ground. Do not, readers, think that printed titles are a weak link in the chain of a production. They’re not even cheaper !

It is rather a question of ‘.lie existence of a series of delinquent features and the paucity of other necessary attributes. Let us briefly outline the position. It must be admitted that the Americans have always specialised in various forms of public entertainment. Although kinemato- graphy was invented by an Englishman and first exploited by the French, the Americans were not slow to see the tremendous com¬ mercial possibilities in this new form of en¬ tertainment. Financial support for public entertainment was never lacking in the States, as has always been the case in this country. With the methodical tenacity born of |a cosmopolitan 'blooded population, and an admixture of Latin art assimilation, the Industry increased by leaps and bounds until the war gave them their chance to forge well ahead of competitors. It is probably a fact that, if it had not been for the war, the Germans would be leading the world in the matter of film pro¬ duction to-day ; indeed, even as it is, I know no film like the German for spectacular effects. The praiseworthy effort^ of the Italians cannot touch them. Although the British public is now tiring of the ordinary American feature film, it still looks to them for the majority of big super -features. The Yankee partiality for ostentation and the in¬ correctness of their English scenes, are be¬ ginning to irk a trifle, but I do not think that we can hope to compete with them until production over here is properly organised. “Jimmy ” White recently described the Trade in this country admirably when he said we were living from hand to mouth. At various centres in America there exist film colonies, the inhabitants of which are continually and for ever in the environment of motion picture production. They talk films all day and they dream of films all night, and it is only natural that they have reduced film production to a very fine art. These film colonies have developed into vir¬ tual schools of production, not the pernicious kinema academies that we know over here, but little worlds where each member of the community is imbrued with the studio atmosphere. Here in England we have no such natural school. To attempt to learn anything about production in this country is like going to a school of cookery to learn Latin. Film production cannot be acquired by rote, but essentially from -a process of absorption by an artistic, imaginative and preferably emo¬ tional temperament, blessed with immense sensibility, and by \\he serious study of aestho-physiology. Again, until the Kinema Club was formed a short time ago, there was no institution in this country at which members of the profession could meet. Artistes have rarely had any support from producing companies. You must create popular stars before you can make popular pictures. To make stars popular they must have wide publicity com¬ bined with beauty and screen talent. Wide publicity means spending money, and “there’s the rub,” but by no means the only one. As the English artiste usually has to pay for his or her own publicity, and as the majority of artistes in this country are impecunious people, it is obvious that the struggle to get on as an artiste over here is an extremely difficult one. The Americans went through a phase of boosting the author, as someone conceived the idea that it would be cheaper and per¬ haps as efficacious as paying enormous sums advertising the various stars. I notice that they have recently come to the conclusion, which should have been obvious, that the personality of an author cannot hope to get over like the personality of the artiste. The same lack of cohesumTapplies also to the directors, who, until quite recently, were scattered broadcast over England, and only met if they happened to be working in the same studio. The much vaunted question of finance has of course, a great deal to do with the in¬ feriority of English pictures, but there have been several instances which I could quote where unlimited m.oney has been forth¬ coming. In these cases, unfortunately, the directors have failed for the most' part to come up to scratch ; imagination, education or ability has been lacking. A union of the right man and the right money has still to be effected. It is proverbial that the English are not an artistic race as a whole, and this, I am afraid, is indisputable. A people that wdl feign, appreciation or even tolerate clas¬ sical music whilst they are feeding must be despaired of in art. Underlying the average American character is a partiality for what we English call “sloppy” sentiment. Sen¬ timent may be sloppy ; it may be anything you like to call it. It is,' nevertheless, founded on heart lure, which is present in the composition of most of the peoples of the. world, although perhaps less markedly so in the stoical Anglo-Saxon. Cut out Mel- villian sentimentality, but let us have refined sentiment. Italian, French and Swedish pictures have not as yet cut much ice outside their country of origin. Although some very fine produc¬ tions have been made in these countries, their psychology and the unmanly gestures of the male actors do not present an attractive appearance to the English. Personally, I have never yet seen a French picture which I found pleasing, although -the acting is usually good from the French standpoint. I may be quite wrong, but it always ap¬ peared strange to me that the majority of directors should be allocated their subject and should then employ another man to write the scenario, which may be totally unsuited to the director’s temperament I know if ever I go in for production I shall not try to elaborate ideas which are con¬ ceived in someone else’s brain. Undoubtedly directors are, as a whole, badly served. Although our cameramen have a lot to learn, they in turn are handi¬ capped by the inadequate lighting arrange¬ ments that exist in most English studios. When w-e do see a pretty English girl on the screen she is invariably wrongly lit. Heavy eyes, wrinkled features, etc., appear the order of the day, chiefly owing to bad lighting, and her right and wrong photo¬ graphic angle is rarely studied. Casting is another direction in which we go astray ; it is so often faulty and some¬ times mars an otherwise creditable film. Colleagues of the studio, we have a long way yet to go. The way is arduous, and those that cannot rise to the occasion must fall out. Give the financier who next ap¬ pears on the horizon a run for his money, and you will find he’ll come again. The industry has no place for incompetency. The game is sufficiently speculative without that element, which has for so long been sapping its vitality. 15 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO June 3, 1922 A QUESTION OF FAITH by CHRISTABEL LOWNDES-YATES IIS number completes the first year | of the Motion Picture Studio — a paper that stands firmly for British films. From its first number it has steadily and wisely upheld the British Screenplay. It has given encouragement and, when necessary, criticism, but it has always had the essential fire of faith in the future of the British film. Of how many other journals can that honestly be said ? Most of those published to-day are extra¬ ordinarily international. Nearly all publish, as a matter of course, interviews and articles in which the foreign film is upheld more from the fact that it is foreign than from any technical ex¬ cellence. So many people think that it is clever to extol work because it bears the imprint of a country not their own. The general public is beginning to see through such futilities. It wants to see good, clever, unhackneyed work of any and every type ; but had England put out work of the character one constantly sees praised in the Press because of its foreign origin, then the English picture trade would not have so many faithful believers as she has even to-day. However, some of her own people are not blind to what is happening to-day in the film trade in this country. The com¬ pany directors, the film directors, the writers, the star artistes and the rank and file have been for some time slowly and steadily evolving the essentially British picture — a complete thing that can come from no country but this, and is as decisively national as the Swedish picture is of Sweden. The British Trade has so far produced no more than the germ of the great thing that will come to life in the future ; but so far, in spite of the pessimists, it is vitally alive. When it is fully developed the British picture will be something new in the Art of the Screen and far bigger than anything we have seen yet from any source. I can see the men who think in dollars and bank drafts smiling at such a statement, but I am not speak¬ ing primarily of dollars, though the type of picture I have in mind will bring both money and power and other things in its train. But the greatest thing in the world to-day is not money ; it is the force behind the money. But while some of the men and women have been evolving the germ of the British Film, working bravely and courageously as all pioneers must, other noisy people have been talking. The world has always had its builders and its destroyers, but surely the latter gentry have never been so much in evidence as to-day. These destroyers are great talkers. Some of them are outsiders whose words carry no weight with people who matter. Others are men of importance, men with great names who will be quoted far and wide as disparagers of British films. Such men are so obsessed by the comparatively advanced state of the kinema in other lands, that they cannot see the excel¬ lencies of production in their own. It is said that in the great reign of Victoria it used to be the fashion to disparage the young merely because they were young, and as such could never be the Great Men their fathers were. Yet these young people, slighted then, are the great men of to-day, and we, from the vantage point of this age, have relegated many of these old men’s theories to the scrap-heap. To those great men who disparage British films on public occasions, at dinners and other meetings where their speeches are reported in the Press, I would say : “ Have faith in your own work. If it isn’t worth it, make it so. If you can’t, throw it up altogether.” The general public is weary of hearing of the greatness of America on the grounds that it can afford to wreck real trains or can build studios into which the sun never enters, and then fake it with such cleverness that it appears like real sun¬ shine to all but experts. Such things are not Art. They have nothing to do with the real making of greatness. The great pictures they have made in America are not dependent on things like that. It is the man behind the picture, not the machinery that makes or mars it. There are plenty of people to-day who believe in British pictures both over here and in other countries. If they did not they would not fight so hard to keep her out of the world markets. Of the great American picture organisations, how many of those that have made Screen history would have attained their present position without English brains and English organisation ? You who are not behind the scenes have no con¬ ception of how much America owes to these islands. You, gentlemen, who are reported in the Press as belauding foreign efforts, have faith — faith in your own pictures— faith in your own screen future. You cannot expect people to invest money in a commercial proposition if your friends after dinner are busy telling them that what you are offering is no good. What is wanted in the British Trade is faith. A man can survive hard times, hard luck, anything and every¬ thing until he loses faith in himself. But to lose faith is to lose all. What is true of the man is true of the Trade. Let the British Film Trade believe in its future and all will be well. It is entirely a question of faith. REMOVING OBSTACLES IN PAST YEAR by J. Stuart Blaekton. THERE are many obstacles in the path of progress, but the greatest that confronts the British Film Industry is' a general lack of confidence. The average British director lacks confidence in his own product. He would like to sell his films in every country in the world, but does not really believe that he can sell them anywhere outside of the United Kingdom. He therefore invests in his productions only as much capital as can be returned to him, with a small profit, out of the United Kingdom. The head of a large British film producing company recently stated to me that this was the policy of his company. From a strictly business point of view such a policy may be very wise, but it does not tend towards an international market for British films. The banks, financial jnterests and investors of capital, knowing full well that this “ lack of con¬ fidence ” exists, are not disposed to risk their money in what appears to be a half-hearted enterprise. In a recent interview, “ Jimmie ” White speaks of the “ hand to mouth ” way in which the British Film Industry is carrying on, and makes the statement that “ the financial position of the Trade is pathetic.” The financial position of the Trade in England is, indeed, sadly different from existing conditions in France, Italy and Germany. Since November, 1918, these three countries have been forging steadily ahead, and their picture producing has been financed by big banking institutions and, in some cases, by Government subsidies. In America the banks have been financing the Moving Picture Industry for the past ten years. Until the British directors demonstrate to the investors that they can turn out pro¬ ductions that will successfully compete with the films of other countries in the world’s market, the investors will “ lack the confidence ” to put their money in films. Until film directors receive the necessary financial support they cannot produce films which will successfully compete with other countries for the world’s market. The obstacle is apparent. How is the obstacle to be removed ? It has been demonstrated during the past year that outstanding film productions can be made in England by British directors. It has been demonstrated that these super-films are welcomed in the American market and the other markets of the world, and hold their own with the best of the world’s product. These productions were not cheaply made. They were financed in most cases by individuals or the directors themselves. I have been told that British financial interests are waiting to have demonstrated to them that British-made films can be marketed at a profit in other countries ; and I believe that when the facts concerning the few recent internationally successful British productions are brought by responsible parties to the direct attention of reliable investors, the “ lack of confidence ” will be overcome and the greatest obstacle removed. I am more optimistic than ever about the future of British films. Their production, sale and exhibition constitute one of the greatest industries of modern times, and the fourth greatest industry now in America. In the interests of British commerce, British capital cannot much longer afford to ignore the opportunities the kinema offers. 16 June 3, 1922 THE MOTION PICTURE STUDIO WALTER WEST AT WORK AN ANGLO-ITALIAN COMBINATION J-pOR the last (few months the Prince’s Studios at Kew have been a veritable hive of industry. Early in the New Year the studio was taken over by Walter West Productions, since when no less than three five-reel films have been made. The first, entitled “ Scarlet Lady,” was a rac.ng film founded on an original story, in which Violet Hopson played the leading part with Lewis Willoughby opposite her. This added yet another to the long list of sporting films which Mr. West has produced, a British type of production in which he has special¬ ised. On the completion of this film he turned his attentions once more to the industrial world as a background for an interesting love story^ written by Paul Trent, in “When Greek .Meets Greek.” Violet (Hopson plays the heroine in this production, with Stewart Rome co-starring. Following this, Mr. West once more sought the racecourse as an inspiration, and has Just completed “ Son of Kissing Cup ” — a sequel to his previous success, “ Kissing Cup’s Race.” Starring Violet Ho.gson and Stewart Rome, this film will contain an uninterrupted film representation of this year’s Derby. The story has a novel turn, which is warranted to prove a big surprise to the most hardened kinemagoer, for the horse which is favourite for the big race is lost on the road to the course, despite the fact that the motor conveyance is carefully guarded and no one sees the disappearance of the precious cargo Walter West Productions (which for the next two years will be distributed by Butcher’s Film Service) announce a big pro¬ gram, on which iMr. West will be engaged in this country until October. His next vehicle will be a film version of “The White 'Hope,” from the novel by W. R. Trouibridge, with Violet Hopson and Stewart Rome as stars. This novel was first filmed in the early days of the British Industry, and, strangely enough, both Violet Hopson and Stewart Rome appeared in the same parts as those in which they will play when Mr. West directs the new version. It will be interesting to compare the two renderings. Following this, Mr. West announces “The Hornet’s Nest,” “The Pruning Knife,” and “In the Blood,” all of which are from the pen of Andrew Soutar. This program Mr. West hopes to have completed by October, when he leaves for the south of France, where he will direct during the winter months. The studio at Kew Bridge, the actual floor space of which measures 117 ft. by 75 ft., is one of the most satisfactorily equipped in England. Mr. West has had installed every modern device which can help towards the technical perfection of a film. The organisa¬ tion is probably equal to that obtaining in any Amer#:an studio. Although not of the magnitude of some of the larger studios, equip¬ ment for every possible set is at hand. The property room contains almost everything from a fountain pen to a Persian prayer mat, whilst the lighting installation is the most modern, and probably the best, in any English studio. Situated as the studio is, almost every type of English scenery is available within a few hours’ car run, and in his two latest productions Mr. West has introduced the English countryside and glimpses of our foremost industries. “When Greek Meets Greek ” is due for Trade showing early this month. by CH IkVALIER ARRIGO BOCCHI, Motion Picture Studio Representative for Italy HAVE always advised the English film director and everybody interested in the British film industry that a. new outlay for their productions, is in this country. They have the advantage to-day of the public over (here being tired and very bored with the American films that have flooded this country. If the Americans had not rushed in and sold films at any price just f.o take the country and market by storm they would not have bored the public to desperation. To-day the English artistes were to appear in the various productions. I thought that this would have been grasped as a great opportunity offered to the British industry; but, alas, all my efforts were in vain. The English artistes would have been received in quite a royal way here, as the .Italians have the greatest regard for all that is English, although several English papers try to tell the public otherwise.
