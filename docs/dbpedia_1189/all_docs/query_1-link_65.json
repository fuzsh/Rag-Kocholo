        "text": "4 stars out of 4\n\nThere's a scene fairly early in \"The Artist\" where sound is introduced into the movie. A drinking glass landing on a table. The wind in the palms. A dog barking, a phone ringing, women laughing.\n\nBy then though, the movie should have you fully in its thrall. And so you will wish, deeply, that it will revert back to silence, that beautiful, evocative silence. It does, and you will be happy.\n\nYes, \"The Artist\" is a silent film. In black and white. With title cards for its few lines of dialogue and a sprightly score to accompany the action.\n\nI walked into a screening thinking it sounded enjoyable, a bit of a novelty, a nice gimmick. I walked out thinking it's my favorite movie of the year: It's imaginative, gorgeous, witty and even kind of sexy (in a chaste way that only adds to its sex appeal).\n\nFor many of you movie lovers, it'll be heaven - and why aren't you in line already?\n\nFilmmaker Michel Hazanavicius has created a loving tribute to the movies of old, but it goes beyond imitation or gentle spoofing: He's all in, for all the romance and glamor and pathos of his story, and so are his extraordinary stars.\n\nJean Dujardin is George Valentin, the hammy, dashing, mustachioed star of \"A Russian Affair,\" \"The German Affair,\" etc. Accompanied on screen and off by his little dog, he's a silent film legend who's fading away as the talkies come in.\n\nBerenice Bejo is Peppy Miller, a vivacious good spirit who's first noticed when she inadvertently horns in on some publicity shots of Valentin. She gives him an impulsive peck on the check - and now the papers want to know: \"WHO'S THAT GIRL?\"\n\nShe and George have some heavy chemistry, wonderfully displayed - just watch the two of them when they're required to dance together in one scene; they forget all that's going on around them.\n\nBut she's moving up in Hollywood, from an extra to one of \"The Beauty Girls\" to \"The Maid\" to the star. And he's dropping fast, as talking infiltrates movies and old stars like him seem, suddenly, superfluous.\n\n\"The public wants fresh meat,\" says studio honcho John Goodman. \"And the public is never wrong.\"\n\nValentin tries to make a silent movie on his own, but finds himself sinking into quicksand, both in his flop of a film and on the streets of Hollywood. But in Hazanavicius' big-hearted story, he finds that, even after he drowns, he has people watching out for him.\n\nIt's a true delight to see how that works out.\n\n1 hour, 40 minutes. PG.\n\nmatt.soergel@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4082"
