        "text": "Steamboat Bill Jr.: A silent comedy in which the well-bread son of a burly riverboat captain must prove his worth by taking over his father's old Mississippi steamboat. In the process he and falls in love with the daughter of his rival.\n\nThe boat: Another movie of seemingly endless disasters as master 'craftsman' Keaton builds, launches and sails his boat Damfino - complete with family, a bathtub for a lifeboat and an anchor that floats! [...] the wife and two children remain amazingly stoical and 'under-whelmed' by all the incredible calamities that continually happen around them. Unusually, for a silent film, there are two verbal plays on the name of the boat; the second, in the final sequence, requires the watcher to have just a little expertise in lip-reading!"
