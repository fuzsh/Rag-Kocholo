        "text": "Steamboat Bill, Jr. Is not only the final genuine classic from Buster Keaton’s independent production team but it also stands, in many ways, as one of his most unparalleled silent films. Keaton showcases his incredible and extraordinary talent for timing and physical comedy alongside his capabilities as a stuntman as he plays college student William Canfield, Jr who enrols with his father's crew aboard the paddle steamer, Steamboat Bill.\n\nIt's now rightfully applauded and frequently heralded as one of Keaton's masterpieces, it astonishingly missed the mark at the box office when it was initially released and sadly proved to be his last film as a self-reliant artist, and as he was mainly self-financing his movies, the financial loss enticed him…\n\nThere’s a marginally interesting plot to “Steamboat Bill Jr.,” but whatever drama it supposes is minimal compared to the actual great dilemma of the film:\n\nWhen will someone please bring Buster Keaton a helmet?\n\nThe setup to “Streamboat” feels more laborious than Keaton’s best efforts. Partially, because it takes the man himself a long while before he finally strolls onscreen.\n\nPossibly he was too humble to admit it, but the draw of Buster Keaton films was - naturally - Buster Keaton. So, to spend a half hour watching old riverboat men bicker is a half an hour without seeing one of the best faces in all film history.\n\nBut when Keaton does appear, “Steamboat” chugs along at a steady pace until…\n\nMuch like the Harold Lloyd vehicle, Safety Last, this silent comedy is known purely for its final sequence. And, like the aforementioned film, it is built around leading up to it.\n\nHowever, Steamboat Bill Jr. just doesn’t deliver for far too long. Much of the film is titter or smile worthy, but some is just flat out uninvolving. We do get to the majestic finale with the legendary falling house stunt but the film built around it is not a great facilitator. Safety Last has a sense of cohesive escalation, and underpins the climax, this is just a film waiting to unleash a set piece.\n\nAlso, the re-issue available on the BFI Player has a rather irritating commissioned soundtrack. At…\n\nThe secret sauce to Keaton, for me, has always been the pathos. Every time - every time - my heart aches for him, not just for all the broken bones and near misses but because I don't think anyone ever played the poor sap who just doesn't measure up in this man's world like he could. It's gotten so I make sure to watch Keaton flicks especially when I'm feeling maudlin, the tears come early on and you know it's OK 'cause he'll send you home happy.\n\nThis one for me was a doozy early on, I mean have you ever seen a more heartbreaking scene than the father encountering a son who meets exactly none of his expectations, the…\n\nPart comedy, part romance, and part disaster-movie adventure, \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" is an uproariously entertaining genre mash-up from cinema's early days. Directed by Charles Reisner and, though uncredited, Buster Keaton, the film weaves a classic narrative together with hilarious comic beats and breathtaking set-pieces. It is a well-assembled, handsomely visualized, and wholly satisfying experience.\n\nBuster Keaton stars as the son of a steamboat captain whose shipping lanes, not to mention entire town, are being taken over by a competitor. The story finds Keaton's character falling for the competitor's daughter, alienating his father, and trying to save dear old dad's ship from a terrible storm. It is a classic star-crossed lovers tale punctuated by clearly communicated themes and comic bits that…"
