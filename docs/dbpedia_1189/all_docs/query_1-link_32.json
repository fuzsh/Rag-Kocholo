His interest/obsession with movies (especially silent films) started during his youth when his father was a movie theater manager in the 1950's and 60's. Bill's silent movie exposure came in the form of films created by Robert Youngson, whose feature films used great clips from a huge number of silent film classics. These movies (When Comedy was King, Days Of Thrills & Laughter, Four Clowns, etc.) were even more fun than the sound films with color and CinemaScope.\n\nShaffer explored this further by buying Super 8mm editions of Keaton and Chaplin films among many others. When the KSFF began in 1996, Shaffer was recruited as a projectionist and then moved up from year to year, doing promotion, fundraising and recruiting volunteers for the KSFF Board.\n\nIn his working life, Bill was a producer/director and studio manager at KTWU/PBS on the Washburn University campus for almost 40 years.
