        "text": "As with every other human emotion, love, and the romantic expression thereof, is subjective. For some, it’s flowers and chocolates that get the heart fluttering; for others, it’s a pair of exit visas.\n\nSo, with all due respect to the classic love stories that didn’t make this list, here is one heart’s picks for the 10 most romantic movies to ever kiss the silver screen.\n\n10. “WALL-E” (2008): As far as Pixar movies go, the first 10 minutes or so of “Up” are romantic perfection, an entire relationship mapped from childhood to old age to widowerhood that got dust in just about every eye that witnessed it. But what the fabled animation company did with robots WALL-E and EVE is even more impressive. With handicaps that include a main character whose vocabulary is limited to his own name, and nary an eyebrow or mouth between the pair to form facial expressions, Pixar’s storytellers managed to create what’s essentially a silent-film love story between two machines roaming the wastelands of an abandoned Earth that’s as affecting as any flesh-and-blood union.\n\n9. “Lost in Translation” (2003): Sofia Coppola’s minimalist love story treads lightly but hits hard. Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, the disillusioned wife of a photographer on assignment in Tokyo. There, she meets Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a past-his-prime American actor in a lackluster Stateside marriage. Lonely and bemused in a foreign country, the unlikely couple bond in the neon glow of Tokyo, their aching connection culminating in an infamously ambiguous ending. Johansson doesn’t say much, but she doesn’t need to. The look on her face tells you everything you need to know about what Murray whispered in her ear.\n\n8. “The Road Home” (1999): Stateside, Chinese director Zhang Yimou is better known for his action-heavy wuxia films such as “Hero” and “House of Flying Daggers.” But his most affecting work is this simple romantic drama in which a grown son, on the heels of his father’s death, recounts the story of his parents’ relationship. She’s a beautiful country girl, he’s a young teacher newly arrived to her rural village, and their courtship, based largely on an exchange of longing looks, is threatened when he’s called away by the government. Their determination to be together is moving, but what really hits hard is the realization that this — building a life together, growing old, someone dying first — is the happiest possible ending.\n\n7. “Harold and Maude” (1971): It’s been more than 40 years since Hal Ashby’s taboo-courting romance paired teenage Harold (Bud Cort) with 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), and despite all the political and social progress that has transpired in the interim, their unlikely union still has the power to challenge and shock. They’re unlikely but wholly organic soul mates, sweetly shattering every social edict in their path. He’s a death-obsessed child of privilege set existentially adrift in a classist world of rank and appearance, and she’s the fearless, flower-loving free spirit with one ultimate life lesson to impart: “Go and love some more.”\n\n6. “A Matter of Life and Death” (1946): David Niven is a WWII British pilot plummeting to certain fiery death; Kim Hunter is the American radio operator who intercepts his distress call. That would be the end of most love stories, but it’s only the beginning of this Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger love-conquers-all fantasy in which the death-cheating Niven must argue his case before a celestial court to stay on Earth with the woman he fell in love with as he fell from the sky. It’s a fanciful romance beautifully rendered by master cinematographer Jack Cardiff, whose monochromatic afterlife is trumped by the earthly delights of brilliant Technicolor.\n\n5. “Brief Encounter” (1945): Sometimes the romance is in what doesn’t happen. And it never didn’t happen more heartbreakingly than in this David Lean-directed and Noel Coward-written love story in which a mild-mannered housewife and doctor resist the urge to cheat on their spouses after a chance encounter leaves them smitten. They conduct their not-quite-affair over a series of stolen Thursdays, emotions playing out violently in secret, their stiff British upper lips quivering with desire. They’re ultimately unable to break social decorum, even when their final moments of perfect misery before parting forever are interrupted by a chatty acquaintance. You’ll never root so hard for two people to do the wrong thing.\n\n4. “The Apartment” (1960): The premise is salacious even by today’s standards: Bachelor office drone C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) rises up the ranks by lending out his cozy New York apartment to his higher-ups to conduct their extramarital liaisons. Things get complicated when he realizes his boss is wooing Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), the spunky elevator girl of his dreams. That’s the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Lemmon is at his Lemmoniest as the sweetly neurotic pushover and MacLaine is at her MacLaineiest as the heartbroken pixie, and leave it to the acerbic brilliance of writer/director Billy Wilder to find twitterpation in the seediest of circumstance.\n\n3. “In the Mood for Love” (2000): Wong Kar-Wai’s sensually lensed film centers on a man and woman (dapper Tony Leung and elegant Maggie Cheung) in neighboring apartments in 1960s Hong Kong. The pair bond when they begin to suspect their often-absent spouses of cheating on them with each other, and the two fall in love in spite of themselves as they playact how their spouses’ affair may have started. It’s an impressionistic masterpiece, its longing and loneliness translated through mood and movement: the swish of fabric and pops of color, the aching wail of violin, the graceful slow-motion that makes each moment of connection linger for an eternity in the slowed frame rates. There’s no movie that moves more like love’s intoxication.\n\n2. “City Lights” (1931): Most of the world had already turned to talkies by the time Charlie Chaplin made his ultimate silent-film masterpiece, in which his iconic Tramp character falls in love with a poor blind flower girl who mistakes him for a wealthy man. After acquiring the funds to pay for her operation (and getting arrested for it), he encounters her again months later. The girl, sight restored, now runs a prosperous flower shop. It’s a wrenching sequence as they exchange looks, one knowing the truth, the other not, and and the slow dawning of revelation on the girls’ face as she takes the Tramp’s hand and realizes he’s her “wealthy” benefactor. Chaplin chooses just the right moment to bow out, fading to black on a note of uncertainty and a smile that seems to contain every possible emotion.\n\n1. “Casablanca” (1942): It’s a short list, the one of flawless films. And by all rights, “Casablanca” shouldn’t be on it — it’s just another factory film with too many writers churned out on the Warner Bros. production line. But some magic, unduplicable alchemy is achieved when nightclub owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) lays eyes on old flame Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) on the arm of renowned resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), the pair needing his assistance to flee to America and continue the fight against Nazi Germany. Bogart is the most affecting of reluctant heroes, who ultimately does the right thing at the expense of his own desires. There’s no amount of booze in the world that can drown the heartbreak and resignation in his voice when he says, “Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.”"
