        "text": "The barque Derry Castle was wrecked on Enderby Island, the northernmost of the Auckland Islands group, in March 1887. Eight of the 23 men aboard got ashore alive, and lived as castaways for four months until they were rescued. Five of the victims of the sinking were buried near the reef where the Derry Castle foundered. This report considers the grave of the victims within the wider geographical and historical contexts, including all of the places that the castaways lived during their sojourn ashore.\n\nThe schooner Grafton was wrecked in Carnley Harbour, Auckland Island, in 1864. The five crewmen all got safely ashore and built a hut (which they named ‘Epigwaitt’) from materials salvaged from the wreck. The men resourcefully survived for eighteen months during which time they modified the ship’s boat. In July 1865 three of the men (including the Captain Thomas Musgrave) made a daring voyage back to Stewart Island. The remaining two men were rescued several weeks later. This was the earliest and most successful of the various Auckland Island castaway stories and was significant in prompting the New Zealand Government to provide castaway depots on the subantarctic islands. The site is a Department of Conservation Actively Conserved Historic Place. This heritage assessment summarises the Grafton story and provides a physical description of the site including the remaining archaeological evidence of the wreck and the hut site and associated structures (such as the boat run up the beach and the site of the forge). It also assesses the place of the site within the context of shipwrecks on subantarctic islands and New Zealand and the significance of the site in terms of its cultural associations, history and archaeological fabric. The site is seen as having high significance based on its uniqueness in subantarctic shipwreck history and influence on Government policy, its detailed first-hand documentation and its influence on other writings of the late 19th century, including those of Jules Verne.\n\nThe wreck of the Grafton and the associated site of the castaway’s hut ‘Epigwaitt’ are located in Carnley Harbour at the southern end of Auckland Island. The Grafton was wrecked in January 1864, and is the great success story of the Auckland Island shipwrecks as all of the crew survived and eventually got back to civilisation, in stark contrast to some of the other wrecks on the island where many people died both in the sea and on land. The publication of the accounts of both the captain (Musgrave 1866) and first mate (Raynal 1892) have ensured that the events surrounding the castaways’ time on the island are well documented. This report describes the history, archaeological evidence and historical significance of the site.\n\nThe New Zealand Subantarctic Islands, emergent remnants of the Campbell Plateau, were given World Heritage status in 1998 in recognition of their importance to global biodiversity. We describe the flora and fauna of these islands and discuss the results of recent phylogenetic analyses. Part of the New Zealand Subantarctic biota appears to be relictual and to be derived from west Gondwana. The relictual element is characterized by genera endemic to the Campbell Plateau that show relationships with taxa of the southern South Island, New Zealand, southern South America, and the north Pacific. In contrast, a younger, east Gondwanan element is composed of species that are either taxonomically identical to widespread mainland species, or endemic species with close New Zealand relatives. Area cladograms support the inclusion of the southern South Island, New Zealand and Macquarie Island (although this is separate geologically) as parts of the Campbell Plateau, but suggest the Chatham Rise and Torlesse terranes of the eastern South Island, New Zealand were originally parts of east Gondwana. East and west Antarctica acted as independent plates during the breakup of Gondwana, and were separated by oceanic crust until a compressive phase sutured them along the trace of the trans-Antarctic mountains during the early Tertiary. The Campbell Plateau microcontinent was connected to west Antarctica until its separation at 80 Mya, contemporaneous with the separation of the southern portion of the Melanesian rift from east Gondwana. Presently the Campbell Plateau is joined to the Melanesian Rift along the Alpine Fault. Cenozoic plate tectonic reconstructions place the Campbell Plateau adjacent to the Melanesian Rift throughout the rift–drift phase, relative motion being confined to strike–slip movement over the last 20 Myr. Our synthesis of phylogenetic and plate tectonic evidence suggests that the Alpine Fault is the most recent development of a much older extensional rift/basin boundary originally separating west and east Gondwana. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 86, 95–115."
