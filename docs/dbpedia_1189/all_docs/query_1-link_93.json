        "text": "The Art Of Accompanying Silent Films\n\nHome\n\nPress Room\n\nSound Samples\n\nYouTube Videos\n\nCD & DVD Store\n\nSchedule of\n\nAppearances\n\nBiography\n\nRepertoire\n\nRecordings\n\nSilent Films\n\nBlog\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nLinks\n\nContact\n\nOne of my most cherished musical pleasures is accompanying silent films. My drive for complete\n\nauthenticity when creating silent films scores is motivated by my deep love, appreciation, and\n\ncommitment to the artistic and musical culture of the silent film era.\n\nTo create my authentic silent film scores, I draw upon my library of over 20,000 vintage pieces\n\nof photoplay music composed for the purposes of perfectly accompanying any scene of any silent film.\n\nThe experience of watching a silent film today is enhanced when the accompaniment reproduces\n\nto the greatest extent possible the style of accompaniment that the film in question would have\n\nreceived in its day by the best cinema musicians.\n\nAccordingly, a film that was released in December 1926, for instance, deserves to have a musical\n\naccompaniment that is exactly like the accompaniment that a fine cinema pianist or organist would\n\nhave given it in December 1926. This means that all the music used in compiling the score will have\n\nbeen published prior to December 1926. I find this approach deeply satisfying because it honors the\n\nsilent film and shows the deepest respect for the era in which the film was produced. This approach\n\nenables modern audiences to imagine that they have been transported back in time. Thus, not only\n\ncan they enjoy the film on its own merits, but they can experience the added richness of a live\n\nmusical recreation.\n\nI compile scores for silent films exactly the same way that cinema pianists and organists compiled\n\nscores back in the days of silent films. The first step is to screen the movie carefully to create a cue sheet.\n\nThis is a breakdown of the film into individual scenes that have a unique emotional component.\n\nThus, in one film, there might be a love scene, followed by a chase scene, then a comedy scene, followed\n\nby a scene of anguish, then of joy, and so forth. Each scene requires appropriate music that matches and conveys\n\nthe emotional contend of each scene.\n\nin the 1920s, independent companies such as the Cameo Music Service Corporation of New York hired composers and\n\narrangers to produce ready-made thematic cue sheets for new movies. These thematic cue sheets told the pianist\n\nwhat to play and when to play it. The \"cue\" in \"cue sheet\" was a point in the film that signaled the musician that it was time to\n\nchange the music in order to support effectively the shifting action on the screen. I am very fortunate\n\nto have a large collection of original cue sheets for silent films. In those instances where I do not have\n\nan original thematic cue sheet for a film that I have been hired to accompany, I create my own cue\n\nsheet modeled on the same pattern used for published sheets, using a mixture of photoplay music, classical music,\n\nsemi-classical, and popular songs.\n\nHere is an example of the first page of a thematic cue sheet for the Paramount film The Popular Sin,\n\nwhich was released on 22 November 1926.\n\nPopular songs in the compiled score had an added significance because mass audiences during the\n\nsilent era would have been expected to recognize the song's title and to know its lyrics. The musician\n\ncould convey additional information to the audience through the clever selection of a popular tune for\n\na particular moment in the film. For instance, if the pianist starts to play the hit song \"Too Many\n\nParties and Too Many Pals\" when a particular lady enters the scene in the film, the audience instantly\n\nknows what sort of lady this is.\n\nMusic publishers made the job of the cinema accompanists simple by publishing each year great volumes\n\nof generic film photoplay music to fit a variety of scenes and moods.\n\nComposers who published such photoplay music include J.S. Zamecnik, Dr. William Axt, Irenée Bergé,\n\nDavid Mendoza, Erno Rapee, Hugo Riesenfeld, Gaston Borch, Maurice Baron, and Albert W. Ketelbey.\n\nMany of these composers went on to compose scores for talking pictures and were considered the best\n\nin the business. My music library includes almost everything published of this nature. It is enormously useful\n\nin compiling authentic silent film scores.\n\nIn addition to these musical sources, music publishers published songs that were intended to commemorate,\n\npopularize, and figure into the accompaniment of silent films. Many of these songs were written by the\n\ncomposer of the published compiled score. For instance, J.S. Zamecnik wrote the compiled score for the\n\n1927 Paramount film Wings and also the popular song commemorating the film. When I accompany a\n\nsilent film, I always work into my compiled score any popular songs written for the film. These songs make\n\nwonderfully appropriate opening numbers for the title sequence of a film.\n\nThese then, are the musical sources that I use to compile an historically accurate, respectful, and exciting\n\nscore for the silent films that I accompany.\n\nWings Restoration Project\n\nI am very proud to have worked on the restoration of the J.S. Zamecnik full score for Paramount's 1927 feature Wings.\n\nIn 2012, Paramount Studios undertook a massive restoration project of this important film and contracted me to be part\n\nof the team preparing the original symphonic score for recording and synchronization with the picture. The other leading\n\nmembers of the musical restoration team were Paramount Studios archivist Jeannie Pool, film composer Dominik Hauser,\n\nand Academy Award winning sound designer Ben Burtt. Our work was made easier because not only did I make my vast\n\nlibrary of photoplay music available for the project, I owned a copy of the 1927 conductor's part for the score that J.S.\n\nZamecnik composed and compiled for the original \"road show\" release of the film, and a copy of the original cue sheet issued\n\nfor the general release print of the film.\n\nThe print of the film that survives today is actually the reissue print from 1930 that was so significantly re-edited that\n\nthe original Zamecnik score no longer synchronizes with the film. Our task was to adjust the score to fit the existing print\n\nin a way that honored the original score while simultaneously synchronizing perfectly with the film.\n\nI was also honored to serve as the pianist on the symphonic sound track for the film.\n\nIn addition being heard on the DVD and Blu-ray release of the restored film, the entire soundtrack has been issued on CD:\n\nLa-La Land Records LLLCD 1206\n\nThe film is available on DVD and Blu-Ray through Amazon and all other retails of classic films.\n\nHere is a short list of some of the films that I have accompanied since 2009:\n\nFeature Length Film Scores\n\nThe Ace of Hearts (1921)\n\nThe Adventures of Tarzan (1921)\n\nAelita Queen Of Mars (1924)\n\nAlmost A Lady (1926)\n\nAre Parents People (1925)\n\nArms and the Girl (1917)\n\nAtlantis (1913)\n\nThe Bargain (1914)\n\nThe Battle of the Sexes (1928)\n\nBattling Bunyan (1924)\n\nBed and Sofa [Третья Мещанская] (1927)\n\nBehind the Front (1926)\n\nBehind the Scenes (1914)\n\nThe Beloved Rogue (1927)\n\nBen-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\n\nThe Big Parade (1925)\n\nBlackmail (1929)\n\nBlind Husbands (1919)\n\nBlind Wives (1920)\n\nBlonde or Brunette (1927)\n\nThe Blot (1921)\n\nBurglar By Proxy (1919)\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919)\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu (2008)\n\nThe Canadian (1926)\n\nCaptain January (1924)\n\nCastles for Two (1926)\n\nThe Cheat (1915)\n\nChicago (1927)\n\nThe Circus (1928)\n\nThe Circus Man (1914)\n\nClash of the Wolves (1925)\n\nCobra (1925)\n\nThe Coming Of Amos (1925)\n\nThe County Fair (1920)\n\nCourt Martial (1928)\n\nThe Covered Wagon (1923)\n\nThe Crackerjack (1925)\n\nThe Crowd (1928)\n\nCyrano de Bergerac (1925)\n\nThe Danger Game (1918)\n\nThe Deadlier Sex (1920)\n\nDestiny [Der müde Tod] (1921)\n\nThe Devil Horse (1926)\n\nThe Docks Of New York (1928)\n\nDollars and Sense (1920)\n\nDon Q, Son of Zorro 1925)\n\nDown to the Sea in Ships (1922)\n\nThe Dragon Painter (1919)\n\nDr. Jack (1922)\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920)\n\nDrop Kick (1927)\n\nThe Duchess of Buffalo (1926)\n\nThe Eagle (1925)\n\nEast Is West (1922)\n\nThe Eternal Grind (1916)\n\nThe Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks [Необычайные приключения мистера Веста в стране Большевиков] (1924)\n\nFather Sergius (Отец Сергий) (1918)\n\nFaust (1926)\n\nFlesh and Blood (1922)\n\nThe Flying Ace (1926)\n\nFoolish Wives (1921)\n\nThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921)\n\nFree to Love (1925)\n\nThe Freshman (1925)\n\nThe Garden Of Eden (1928)\n\nThe General (1926)\n\nGigolo (1926)\n\nGirl Shy (1924)\n\nA Girl's Folly (1917)\n\nThe Good Bad Man (1916)\n\nGrandma's Boy (1922)\n\nGrass (1925)\n\nThe Great K & A Train Robbery (1926)\n\nGreed (1922)\n\nThe Hands of Orlac [Orlacs Hände] (1924)\n\nHands Up!
