        "text": "Silent film buff Tracey Goessel, who has traveled the world to work with silent film collectors, has always had Kansas in the back of her mind.\n\nShe has interacted with people in Italy, Los Angeles and New York who screen silent films, but they all have a tendency to believe that if it has screened in one of these locations, it has been put out into the world, according to Goessel.\n\n“What about the person in Kansas?” Goessel said. “How is somebody who lives in Kansas gonna see this film if they don’t release it or make it available digitally? I’m from Wisconsin originally — I certainly didn’t have a lot of access to silent films when I was growing up.”\n\nSilent films have become somewhat of a niche area, and one that for the most part is inaccessible to the masses. They tend to be owned by collectors or divided up among such entities as the Library of Congress or the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nSo for Goessel, author of “The First King of Hollywood: The Life of Douglas Fairbanks” and president of the Film Preservation Society, coming to Topeka for the Kansas Silent Film Festival is exciting.\n\n“I am just thrilled to be in a room with fellow silent film buffs,” Goessel said. “The fact that people leave their homes and go out of their way to come and sit communally and watch silent movies together speaks to a level of enthusiasm and curiosity that I really welcome.”\n\nThis year’s Kansas Silent Film Festival will run Friday, Feb. 28, through Saturday, Feb. 29, at Washburn University’s White Concert Hall, 1700 S.W. Jewell Ave.\n\nFriday night kicks off at 7 p.m. with “A Smoked Husband,” a seven-minute D.W. Griffith film featuring Mack Sennett.\n\nOther films shown throughout the two days include “Why Worry?,” “Leap Year,” “Soul of the Beast,” “The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg” and “Underworld.”\n\nMusical accompaniment will be provided by Bob Keckeisen, Jeff Rapsis, Bill Beningfield and Marvin Faulwell.\n\nGoessel will speak at 5:15 p.m. Saturday during the cinema dinner about her book “The First King of Hollywood: The Life of Douglas Fairbanks.”\n\nTo hear Goessel speak, guests must reserve a spot at the dinner for $40 and email Bill Shaffer at bill.shaffer@washburn.edu.\n\nGoessel will also speak about her work on a restoration project of over 400 D.W. Griffith Biograph films.\n\nThe 20-year project is currently about five years in, according to Goessel, and they hope to complete 52 reels a year. So far, 19 have been restored.\n\nD.W. Griffith created the Biograph studio in the early 1900s, and between 1908 and 1913 created a new grammar of cinema.\n\n“Before Griffith, movies were pretty much film stage plays with the whole body showing, no cuts within a scene, no movement of the camera,” Goessel said. “It was just like watching the act of a play, and over the course of that five-year period Griffith started to move the camera.”\n\nBut there are challenges when it comes to restoring these films.\n\n“Up until mid 1912, film wasn’t something that could be copyrighted,” Goessel said. “It was a medium that hadn’t been thought of before so the only way you could copyright a film was to copyright every photograph, every frame within the film. So filmmakers would print their movie on a long roll of paper and turn it in to the Library of Congress as their copyright of the film.”\n\nBecause paper can’t be projected through a camera, Goessel and her team have to capture each frame, digitally put them in order and stabilize and clean them up.\n\n“Suddenly you’re seeing people move and you’re seeing a story play out that has been under lock and key for 112 years,” she said.\n\nOnce all 465 films have been restored, Goessel said, they will be made available through a public database.\n\n“People will be able to dip into this database and see these films where otherwise you would have to go to an archive and get special permission to get something screened,” Goessel said. “Now we are going to make this material available for everybody.”\n\nGoessel, who works as a physician, said watching a silent film is different from viewing a talking film.\n\n“You process a silent film with music in a different part of your brain than you process a sound film,” Goessel said. “Talking films — you are letting the voices and the music cue you to what’s happening. Think about how you sit and watch television — your eyes are not glued to the screen every second. You’re not watching with your whole eyes and your whole heart. Silent films require complete immersion into the experience.”\n\nGoessel said people process silent films in the mid-brain, where their emotional core is located.\n\n“It is in my mind a richer and deeper experience to watch a silent film than it is to see a talking film or television,” she said, “and to do it in a room full of like-minded people, to be laughing at a comedy or to be reacting to a tragedy with other people who are going through the same experience enriches it even further.”\n\nDenise Morrison, the festival’s mistress of ceremonies, hopes that experience transitions into a better appreciation of silent films.\n\n“I hope they continue to enjoy silent films,” Morrison said. “I hope they seek them out because the more people that want to see them on DVD or see them in festivals, the more they will be preserved.”\n\n7-10 p.m. Friday, Feb. 28\n\n• “A Smoked Husband” (1908)\n\n• “Why Worry?” (1923)\n\n• “Mr. Jones at the Ball” (1908)\n\n• “Leap Year” (1921/1924)\n\n9 a.m.-5:15 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 29\n\n• “The Adventures of Dollie” (1908)\n\n• “A Child’s Impulse” (1910)\n\n• “Soul of the Beast” (1923)\n\n•“The Student Prince of Old Heidelberg” (1927)\n\n• “Underworld” (1927)\n\n• “The Rivals” (1923)\n\n• “We Faw Down” (1928)\n\n• “Robin Hood” (1922)\n\nKANSAS SILENT FILM FESTIVAL SCHEDULE"
