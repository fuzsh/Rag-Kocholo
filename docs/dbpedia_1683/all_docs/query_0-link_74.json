        "text": "DJ Khaled is a man of many talents. Not only is he a world-renowned DJ and music producer, but he's also a record label executive, entrepreneur, and author. He's best known for his work in hip hop, but he's also dabbled in R&B, pop, and other genres. In short, he's what many would call a \"renaissance man.\"\n\nDid we mention he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?\n\nLet's start with the basics. DJ Khaled is a record producer and disc jockey who first rose to prominence in the 1990s thanks to his work as a radio host in South Florida at 99 Jamz. Around the same time, he was touring with Fat Joe's Terror Squad as their DJ. He has since gone on to executive produce records for some of the biggest names in music. Khaled served an executive role at Def Jam, for their Def Jam South label, as well as founding We the Best Music Group, which is currently under Epic Records (Sony). He's also released a number of successful albums and singles as a solo artist, featuring some of the world's most recognizable talents.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nIn addition to his musical accomplishments, DJ Khaled is also a dedicated entrepreneur. He's the founder of multiple businesses, as well as a published writer. His book 'The Keys: A Memoir' is even a New York Times Bestseller.\n\nTo fully understand DJ Khaled and his role in the modern era of music, you need to first familiarize yourself with what it means to be an executive producer.\n\nExecutive producers are responsible for curating a given musical work, as well as coordinating the business decisions surrounding it, and promoting it. Doesn't this sound like somebody you know?\n\nKhaled really is the best -- or at least, one of the best. Here's a look at some other notable executive producers you might recognize:\n\nJay-Z (Philadelphia Freeway by Freeway, Food & Liquor by Lupe Fiasco)\n\nKendrick Lamar (Redemption by Jay Rock)\n\nDiddy (Ready to Die and Life After Death by The Notorious B.I.G.)\n\nSwizz Beats (Exodus by DMX)\n\n50 Cent (Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon by Pop Smoke)\n\nJ. Cole (Milky Way by Bas)\n\nYoung Thug (Trapped on Cleveland 3 by Lil Keed)\n\nGunna (Top Chef Gotit by Lil Gotit)\n\nWestside Gunn (Pray for Haiti by Mach-Hommy)"
