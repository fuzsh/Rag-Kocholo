        "text": "DJ Khaled’s feature list is just absurd and grand in scale. Who thinks of putting Anthony Hamilton and Meek Mill on a song together, the same track that also has Scarface and Akon? Oh and while you are trying to put those four together, you might as well get Jadakiss and John Legend on there. I mean, why not? As weird and unorthodox this assemblage sounds, it pays off handsomely on his latest leak, “Never Surrender.”\n\nKhaled and Street Runner craft a shockingly low key beautiful track. It samples the same “A Legend in it’s Own Time” by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles. It is probably one of the most surprising tracks from him in awhile. Hamilton, Legend, and Akon all lace the track with their own unique brand of soulful crooning, which actually meshes really well together. Jadakiss and Scarface are proven greats, while Mill is closing has been dominating as of recent. Each emcee just murks the track, and bring an old school gangster feel to the track, especially Scarface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe video follows a man who goes from being well connected with street dudes, to becoming an informant. He eventually turns on all of his boys, who then plot to get him dealt with, which happens towards the end. All the artists are seen in different locales, alone, except for Meek Mill who is flanked by a group of famous supporters and friends. It is a rich, detailed video that is captivating.\n\nCheck it out below, and stay tuned for Khaled’s latest album, Suffering From Success, dropping soon.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lzySOfWHU38"
