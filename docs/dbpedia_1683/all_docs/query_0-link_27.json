        "text": "Apple Music has invited DJ Khaled to be its first \"Artist-in-Residence,\" Khaled announced today on his Instagram account (via Billboard).\n\nKhaled says that as Artist-in-Residence, he will be taking over \"the biggest playlists on the platform\" every month while also debuting new artists.\n\nKhaled called on record labels and artists to \"hit him up\" to collaborate, and he announced his first takeover playlist: Office DJ. Next month, Khaled says that he plans to debut a \"Gymflow playlist vibe.\"\n\nThe Office DJ playlist from Khaled includes songs from Jay-Z, Drake, Beyoncé, Buju Banton, Lauryn Hill, Rick Ross, Sam Cooke, Dr. Dre, and more.\n\nAny workplace could use a little pick-me-up. And few people are better at elevating heart rates and boosting productivity than DJ Khaled, Apple Music's first-ever artist in residence. He's staging a corporate takeover with this exclusive, handpicked playlist, serving up new and old classics from hip-hop, R&amp;B, reggae, and pop--Khaled's areas of expertise--specifically designed to carry everyone from opening bell through end-of-day air horn.\n\nKhaled's playlists are available for free to Apple Music subscribers.\n\nArticle Link: Apple Music Names DJ Khaled As First 'Artist-in-Residence'\n\nBetween each song this talentless hack adds...\n\n\"Another one...\"\n\nThen, after every 5 songs he adds...\n\n\"This here is the BEST music!...\"\n\nAnd during any song, you will get a random \"DJ Kalhed\", even if it is the them from Ishtar.\n\nAll that stuff is connected to Hip-Hop Radio culture. It's no different than any rock station's drops and station identifiers. He started off as a radio DJ and that's why he does that stuff. He is an extremely influential producer as well and really has helped dictate the sound of \"urban\" music for the better part of two decades. Those drops are more than just his signature but set his music up as sounding like its part of his radio broadcasts. Him being part of something like this is just bringing his career back full circle, programming a fluid radio broadcast.\n\nI can appreciate that this genre is not everyone's cup of tea — art is art and sometimes it just doesn't connect with everyone the same way — but for those of us who like it, this is great news.\n\nReally? Why not pick Taylor Swift while you're at it?\n\nBig pop stars hardly fit the tag \"artist in residence\". In the visual arts medium where the term originates from, these artists were more underground phenomenon, given a job to help support themselves as smaller yet high quality artists.\n\nInstead Apple give the gig to another rich mass selling pop star...how utterly boring.\n\nIndeed... Boring and as an independent artist (yes, some of my tracks are on Apple Music as well as the other streaming services) I’m insulted by the choice. LOL\n\n[doublepost=1564002645][/doublepost]\n\nAll that stuff is connected to Hip-Hop Radio culture. It's no different than any rock station's drops and station identifiers.

The best mixers/producers out there stopped doing the name drops ages ago.\n\n(Brian Transeau aka BT as an example)\n\nAll that stuff is connected to Hip-Hop Radio culture.
