        "text": "*** The Met Gala is a night to standout, to dress to impress and really make a statement. *** Who ended up getting most of the press, the woman of the moment, who can do no wrong, Zendaya! She knows how to grow her brand right!!! *** All the press and news focused on her OTT dress and look. And why wouldn't they? The more extreme, the more interest, the more people talk about you. *** Zendaya is a master of using fashion and costume to create attention. She did it at the Dune 2 Premiere in London and countless other times. By doing so it makes it more than her own beauty and looks, it is the theatre, the shock, the fun. *** She has grown her personal brand perfectly, and she does it with the intent to become the most bankable Hollywood actor. Studios know if they cast her she'll create a massive amount of 'free marketing' with all the buzz that she generates. *** This is an example to all those in business. Look to find ways to create attraction and attention. And don't be half-hearted about it as no one will notice if you do. #brandstrategy #brandcommunication #branddevelopment #brandadvice #branding #brand\n\nAh, THE MET GALA, 2024!üéâ What lessons can be learned from this annual invitation only costume party described by many as frivolous, elitist and over the top? Well here are a few: >CONFIDENCE AT ANY AGE - At 27 years old, Zendaya owns every room she enters. Just look. >PERCEPTION ISNT ALWAYS REALITY- 2 years ago while waiting to board a flight from NYC to Rome, a familiar face wearing a chic floral dress, trademark dark glasses and a warm smile scanned the empty seats around me then approached to ask politely if she could sit next to me. #annawintour -no devil, no prada- she was lovely. > ANYONE CAN HAVE A MISSTEP, ADDRESS IT QUICKLY Confusion over a clash between the gala theme, \"Sleeping Beauties, reawakening fashion\" AND the official dress code, \"Garden of Time\" caused a media uproar. Is it a #Disney theme? Is it a nod to #GrimmBrothers? What is it? Well, it was neither. Combined with an apology, Anna explained that it was meant to be a nod to florals and springtime. How could the leader at #vogue, a publishing organization with access to the best writers and editors anywhere, NOT catch this messaging mixup? It happens to everyone. Leaders apologize quickly, explain, move on. >IT'S OK TO HAVE FUN! Creative expression taps our joy center. Film, fashion, dance, music, art, comedy or any other form of creativity allows us to express ourselves joyfully which makes us better at our work. #leadership #metgala #fashion #thedevilwearsprada\n\nüñ§ Iconic Leadership in Branding - Nike‚Äôs Air Jordan üñ§ You may wonder how Nike won Michael Jordan‚Äôs business after competing against top athletic industry experts like Adidas and Converse. Here‚Äôs how Sonny Vaccaro succeeded in transforming Nike‚Äôs brand vision into a reality: 1. Faith + Passion: Deep belief and perseverance in Michael Jordan - He was the rising star that would significantly change Nike‚Äôs future and leave a legacy for us all to remember forever 2. Action: Took the initiative to visit Michael Jordan‚Äôs family at home in North Carolina to ask the question 3. Strategy: Catered the shoe design entirely to Michael Jordan, making it unique and original to him 4. Execution: Authentically and inspirationally spoke to the philosophical meaning this would have on all of our lives Tune in and listen to Matt Damon‚Äôs portrayal of Sonny Vaccaro‚Äôs inspirational speech here: https://lnkd.in/eBPghaq9 Sonny Vaccaro: [to Michael Jordan]: ‚ÄúForget about the shoes, forget about the money. You're going to make enough money, it's not going to matter. Money can buy you almost anything, it can't buy you immortality. That, you have to earn. I'm going to look you in the eyes and I'm gonna tell you the future. You were cut from your high school basketball team. You willed your way to the NBA. You're gonna win championships. It's an American story, and that's why Americans are gonna love it. People are going to build you up, and God are they going to, because when you're great and new, we love you. Man, we'll build you up into something that doesn't even exist. You're going to change the world. But you know what? Once they've built you as high as they possibly can, they're gonna tear you back down - it's the most predictable pattern. We build you into something that doesn't exist, and that means you have to try to be that thing all day, every day. That's how it works. And we do it again, and again, and again. And I'm going to tell you the truth. You're going to be attacked, betrayed, exposed and humiliated. And you'd survive that. A lot of people can climb that mountain. It's the way down that breaks them, 'cause that's the moment when you are truly alone. And what would you do then? Can you summon the will to fight on, through all the pain, and rise again? Who are you Michael? That will be the defining question of your life. And I think you already know the answer, and that's why we're all here. A shoe is just a shoe until somebody steps into it. Then it has meaning. The rest of us just want a chance to touch that greatness. We need you in these shoes not so you have meaning in your life, but so that we have meaning in ours. Everyone at this table will be forgotten as soon as our time here is up - except for you. You're gonna be remembered forever, because some things are eternal. You're Michael Jordan, and your story is gonna make us want to fly.‚Äù What moments stand out and completely changed everything in your life?\n\nCouldn't help but reminisce on 90's era GAP's brand experiences after watching this clip spotlighted by Charell Star. The whole vibe in this clip works. I'm getting a melding of the best of GAP's campaigns; from LL Cool, to their deep embrace of Urban Culture, break and swing dance. Lovin' this whole moment. 90's soul. At a certain point in time you could reliably expect that GAP would have a level of representation that wasn't all that common for mainstream brands of its size (obviously the actual urban/Black and brown brands were leading the way in this area), they weren't perfect, and across the broader stream of time, it didn't seem to hold onto that, but for some moments it was setting a pattern worth paying attention to: https://lnkd.in/eQkWWham GAP goes swing dancing: https://lnkd.in/esKacs6u It was clear at various points in time they had an understanding of the power of of urban culture, and that most importantly, without the people who created the culture, you've got no soul, just aesthetics: https://lnkd.in/eQkWWham LL bringing FUBU to the masses using GAP as the vehicle. Single-handedly keeping the GAP brand relevant. I spoke on this from a brand and differentiation perspective back in 2020 during my presentation at Owner Summit NOLA, it's one of those moments for the books. I still remember the feelin' I got when I saw it air for the first time all those years ago: https://lnkd.in/eE2gC5WC Generation GAP https://lnkd.in/ekp-4Nhd #brandexperiences #brandimpact #advertisingcampaign #gap\n\nIce Spice‚Äôs independent journey is one worth paying attention to. She‚Äôs a rapper who has encountered rapid success through her authenticity. It‚Äôs important to pay attention to independent artist cases like this, as it shows that her journey is replicable if you have the talent and determination. Let‚Äôs break down how she achieved this success: 1. Found Her Community There‚Äôs an underlying theme throughout her journey and that is authenticity. She found her fans and they supported her throughout. 2. Created a Viral Song Munch went viral and even had its own hashtag. This attention snowballed through the use of TikTok and Drake playing the song on his Sirius XM radio station, Sound 42. 3. Endorsements & Brand Deals Very quickly she was partnering with brands as she represented the idea of being unapologetically herself. Partnering with brands like Vogue, Marc Jacobs, and Ivy Park x Adidas gave her credibility. 4. Collaborations It‚Äôs possible to be a one-hit wonder and Ice Spice prevented that by continuously staying relevant. Collaborating with huge artists in different genres continued to increase her reach. 5. Superfans Many huge artists have a name for their followers, Swifties (Taylor Swift), Little Monsters (Gaga), The Horde (Deadmau5) and she has the Spice Cabinet or Munchkins. They identify with her and promote her message of inclusivity. It‚Äôs a lot of work as an independent artist, but with hard work comes a career that you‚Äôre in control of that authentically represents you. Authenticity is so important, it builds trust and loyalty. Create a strong bond with your superfans. #superfans #authenticity #independentartist"
