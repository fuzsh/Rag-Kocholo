        "text": "AUGUST 08 — the accomplished singer-songwriter behind hits like DJ Khaled’s “I’m The One,” Justin Bieber’s “Sorry,” and Sabrina Claudio’s “Orion’s Belt”— has died at age 31. A cause of death is currently unknown.\n\nThe tragic news was confirmed by Def Jam, the crooner’s label, in a statement. “The entire Def Jam family mourns the tragic loss of Ray ‘August 08’ Jacobs. A brilliant songwriter, an accomplished musician and a singular artist, August will remain in our memory as a beloved colleague and friend. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and loved ones.”\n\nHis sister wrote in a separate tribute, “As we all try to press through understand that we all come here to serve a soul purpose. I find comfort in knowing that my brother lived a full life of abundance. He was able to travel the world, and touch millions of people while fulfilling his soul purpose as a musician. I am proud to have a brother who lives on through music, and I encourage you all to keep streaming his records and telling everyone how great he is. 08/08 = infinity.”\n\nBorn Ray Davon Jacobs on January 2, 1991 in South Los Angeles, the artist earned his moniker from his father.\n\n“The reason my name is AUGUST 08 is because it’s my father’s birthday, his birth month is August. I did that because me and my father had a really rough relationship, and I’m named after him, so I kind of wanted to spite him, but also be a part of him,” he told DJBooth in 2018. His father’s infidelity led to a familial split at age 11, leaving AUGUST to be raised with his single mother and two older sisters before being sent to live with his uncle at age 14, according to a 2019 RedBull interview.\n\nAs a child, the Towards The Sun singer always had dreams of being a musician, and credited his eventual growth as an artist with signing with 88rising.\n\n“Everyone is a good person, so they helped me open up and become more in tune with what I want and who I want to be,” he expressed of his label. “They’ve created a lane where you can be who you are and not be afraid to let that shine. Musically, we just feed off each other.”\n\nHis breakout single, “Funeral,” from his Father EP served as a catalyst to mend the strain he had with his family — except for his father — and put him on the map as an artist on the rise.\n\nIn 2022, AUGUST signed with Jhené Aiko‘s Allel Sound imprint under Def Jam and the two released a duet, “Water Sign.”\n\nAt the time of signing, the Souled Out singer shared, “August is an incredible writer, singer and artist whose music speaks to me on so many levels. As a fellow Los Angeles native, I am so proud of him. August’s talent, love for songwriting and hands on approach with his art is something I can relate to and have a great amount of respect for. It was a natural evolution of our friendship and musical collaboration to have him become the first artist signed to Allel Sound. I couldn’t be more excited to work with August.”\n\nThe two just performed together three weeks ago and were planning to reunite again on tour.\n\nHis former label affiliate, 88rising, also honored AUGUST via Instagram on Tuesday (Aug. 29). “RIP August the kindest and most talented genius you will be missed beyond words. Thank you for being an amazing mentor and a steadfast friend through all these years. We are forever grateful to you and the joy you brought in every room, through every song. Your energy, guidance and care gave so much inspiration and strength that will be carried on always. Thank you for helping us be brave. We will miss you so much, love you August.”\n\nVIBE sends our deepest condolences to all those affected by this loss."
