Another Wing is available on three continents, across 18 states and in 150 locations as of Nov. 11.\n\n“Everything I do is big,” said DJ Khaled in a release. “My team and I are focused on launching new partnerships, new ideas and spreading love to my fans all around the world. Partnering with REEF for this launch is another new exciting venture which allows me to introduce some amazing wings, to everyone, everywhere.”\n\nThe menu features bone-in and boneless wings in eight colorful flavors named for DJ Khaled songs: Un Un Un Believable Buffalo, Suffering From Success Sesame Teriyaki, Korean Fried Chicken Teriyaki Glaze, Mogul Bourbon BBQ, Don't Quit Nashville Hot, You Loyal! Lemon Pepper, Honey! Honey! Hot Honey Siracha and They Don’t Want You To Win TRUFFALO (black truffle and buffalo sauce).\n\nPrices for wings range from $10.95 for four to $23.45 for 20; Prices for tenders range from $11.95 for four to $19.95 for 20.\n\nTenders are available in four-, six-, eight- and ten-piece combinations with one or two dipping sauces. Wings come in six-, ten-, 16- or 20-piece combos. Combos, which range in price from $23.95 to $35.45, include a side.\n\nSides include Spicy Togerashi Fries, Jalapeno Cheese Fries, Truffle Parm Fries, Onion Rings, and Chocolate Chip Cookies.\n\n“Another Wing is the result of DJ Khaled’s legendary creativity colliding with REEF’s best in class kitchens platform, the fastest-growing restaurant business in the world,” said Alan Philips, Reef’s chief creative officer, in a statement. “By launching on three continents and 165 locations at the same time, REEF is sharing with the world how brands can use our platform to scale with unprecedented speed and minimal capital investment. At REEF we are truly connecting the world to your block.”\n\nDJ Khaled joins the string of musicians partnering with delivery providers for virtual brands including Wiz Khalifa and Nextbite and Mariah Carey and Virtual Dining Concepts."
