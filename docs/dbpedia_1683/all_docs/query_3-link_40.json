        "text": "During hip-hop's golden era, DJs played a pivotal role in fueling the culture. As the preeminent voices of authority, breaking songs and introducing acts to the mainstream, being a DJ demanded far more than recording mixes and spinning vinyl. The position came with a responsibility to preserve the art form, champion great music, and be an advocate for movements that drive the genre forward. As a result, DJs were positioned as the gatekeepers, tastemakers and curators who ultimately set the standard.\n\nThe rapid rise of technology and digital media swiftly shifted the paradigm of modern music, consequently changing the dynamics and influence of being a DJ. As brands began making bigger spends for air space, radio shows became less about setting the trends and more about staying on top of them. DJs who also served as on-air personalities faced sudden restriction, as corporations further shaped what was played and spoken about. Although alternatives like Sirius XM emerged as successful hybrids, merging pirate and mainstream radio, the massive transition proved irreversible. Once a craft trademarked by two turntables, record crates and a microphone now included software, mobile apps and other devices that have made it much easier to be classified as a DJ.\n\nFor DJ Carisma, remaining true to her core and operating with a passion to progress the culture is an approach that has given her an unmatched advantage in a seemingly fading profession. Spearheading the resurgence of West Coast rap at Power 106 FM in Los Angeles, Carisma carved out a niche for discovering artists and untapped movements destined for the spotlight. To do so, she had to find unconventional ways of breaking new artists in order to acquire the influence needed to gain creative control. Even after seeing multiple successes, it took consistently taking risks and trusting her instincts to build a track record strong enough to be considered a credible purveyor of taste. Once she achieved such freedom, doors opened for Carisma to truly make her mark as a voice of the people.\n\nThroughout her career, the LA native was instrumental in giving stars like Tinashe, Dj Mustard, YG, Dej Loaf, Ty Dolla $ign, and Tory Lanez a major platform. In a time where West Coast music received very minimal exposure, Carisma spearheaded the Young California movement, which has grown to become a prominent pipeline for showcasing artists on the brink of breaking through. After recently announcing her move to Real 92.3, LA’s leading Hip Hop and R&B station, she’s also brought her Young California imprint to the mainstream.\n\nWinning Female DJ of the Year at the 2015 Global Spin Awards, an honor she’s earned two consecutive years, TIDAL also named Carisma as a key influencer in entertainment. Social media’s most beloved producer turned social media anomaly DJ Khaled ranked her on his list of today's most important DJs for her notable contributions to music.\n\nI spoke with DJ Carisma about her journey through the industry, being a voice for the West Coast, expanding her brand and the new role of DJ’s in today’s digitally dominated music business.\n\nHow important is it to see this shift where movements like Young California are getting a bigger platform to break local artists and introduce new sounds and trends to mainstream radio?\n\nIt’s huge, and very important. It’s also very hard. It’s very hard to get independent artists, unsigned artists, or even new artists signed to a major label in the game and give them a chance on mainstream radio programming. I’m excited that Young California will be able to lead the way for artists and hopefully inspire other stations across the country to do the same. We’re going to have a pick of the week, where we highlight a local song that is making noise in the streets and replay it. I’m blessed and thankful to have a show like this, especially with iHeart behind it.\n\nWho are some of the artists you’ve worked with from the start of their careers that you now see elevated to the spotlight?\n\nIt started with the New Boyz, then it went to YG, which also includes DJ Mustard and Ty Dolla $ign. Then it was TeeFlii, Tinashe, Mila J, Sage The Gemini, and many others. I was also a big West Coast player in Dej Loaf’s career. When there wasn’t much talk or buzz surrounding her, I was the one to really support her album on the West Coast. The list goes on and on. I was a huge champion of Eric Bellenger and Tory Lanez as well. I’ve known Tory Lanez for years and have been rocking with his music since the beginning. I hosted a lot of his mixtapes.\n\nHaving an early hand in the career of so many stars who are making great strides in music, what are the signs an artist is special and has what it takes to reach the highest level?\n\nThere are so many factors, and it depends on the type of artist. For example, there are artists like a YG and RJ. The streets champion them and everywhere you go, the people really want to hear them. Then, you have the trends and movements that come, like we saw with \"Cat Daddy\" or \"Teach Me How To Dougie\", which become fads, but you can’t deny the impact they have. Then, on the other hand, you have artists like Ty Dolla $ign who you recognize have a special gift. You watch them and see they’re so talented, and then you watch them grow and evolve into the star you always knew they would be. There are just so many ways to get noticed now, and different artists represent different waves or movements. The key is stay connected to the culture and be willing to listen to what the people are saying, not just relying on your own personal preferences.\n\nYou’ve always been very vocal about putting underground movements on a bigger platform and being a voice for the people — how important is that mindset and how has is that played a role advancing your career?\n\nFor me, it’s a passion thing. There was a point when there wasn’t any West Coast music on the radio, and this is where we’re from, but we’re not hearing that represented. So, when I got the opportunity to be a person who could use my voice, I noticed a lot of people were scared to vouch for something new. Everyone, from the labels to the DJ’s, were scared. Nowadays, people just watch you and try to hop on your movement if it’s successful. They just wait and wait until you build your own buzz and get big, then they step in. They’re scared to take that chance and put that vouch on people. That’s one thing I’m not afraid to do. I’ll put a vouch on artists I believe in. Some of them fail, some of them pop off, but you can’t be scared to stand up and say this is dope, give it a chance. Why only settle for what the label wants to put out or what the top 40 records are? That attitude and approach is what got me to where I’m at today. Staying true to me.\n\nThere’s the looming stigma that Programming Directors are controlled by corporations and only play the same popular set of songs — do you agree with this?\n\nThat’s exactly what it is. It’s a lot of politics. Overcoming the politics is about never giving up and having passion. All the songs that I break, it’s never an easy thing. It took a long time. Even the biggest songs, I had to take them to my bosses repeatedly and say look, you’re sleeping on these artists. There are thousands of kids going crazy for this, we need to tap into this. For me, passion and determination was always the key to getting the best music out, not just what’s popular.\n\nOf all the songs you’ve introduced to the masses — What was the hardest record you’ve ever had to break?\n\nYG’s “Toot It and Boot It”, by far. You have to remember, that song came out when the West Coast was non-existent on the radio, period. Except for The Game. It was really hard. Plus, I was a female telling these veteran radio executives and DJ’s that this is hot, and maybe they didn’t want to listen to me, or maybe they didn’t think I know what’s going on in the streets. So, it was really hard. Even after that one, or after breaking \"You’re A Jerk\", it never stopped. I constantly had to prove myself, and show people what they were missing out on.\n\nWinning the Global Spin Award two consecutive years, what does that really mean for both you and other DJ’s who play more of a tastemaker or curator role?\n\nI’m such a competitive person, and I really wanted to win. On top of that, I was the only West Coast female DJ nominated. More so, not many Hip Hop DJ’s get those types of looks, How many famous female DJ’s do you know that have really been in the spotlight and making their mark today? I had MC Lyte give me my award, and having that happen was a dream. Also, being Latina, I wouldn’t think that would ever happen. It’s usually either Black, Asian or White winners. I just took a lot of pride in winning. Then, winning two years in a row, that made it even more special and memorable for me.\n\nSeeing others like DJ Khaled become these massive brands and expand beyond the turntables — what does that say about the evolution of the DJ and what does the Dj Carisma brand represent?\n\nThe Dj Carisma brand is all about that — Charisma. Every element of the word. I have this charm and natural ability to influence people. I’m a leader and fearless trendsetter, and that’s what DJ Carisma is all about. It’s an energy, enthusiasm and hunger for breaking new trends. That’s something that is really lacking. I just want to remain focused on that and drop my own singles, continue Executive Producing projects and more. Big Boy taught me that early in my career. He would say the most important thing you’re going to have is your brand. If you keep your brand solid, you can leave and go anywhere you want. If you can make your brand bigger than the station, you’ve reached your goal. From that point forward, that’s what I wanted to do and I did it.\n\nYou’re looking to produce more music and put our more projects — What are some of the new collaborations you’re putting out?\n\nMy new single has Chris Brown and Dej Loaf, which was big. I’ve also got YG, Jeremih, Tinashe and Meek Mill. Who knows what’s going to happen next. People are hitting me more now to work because they’ve noticed this is what I’m doing, so right now it’s really spreading that word. Khaled has been doing this through his whole career. For me, I’m fairly new to this, so it’s about letting people know and staying consistent. I’m respected as a radio DJ, now it’s about getting the same respect in the other lanes I’m venturing into.\n\nMany argue that mainstream radio stations are becoming the dinosaurs of the industry — Do you see radio shifting back to independent and pirate stations to give DJ’s more creative control?\n\nI definitely think radio is going to change drastically in the next 10 years, and that’s a fact. I don’t know what is going to happen exactly, but once the average person has a car that can access the internet, it’s going to change everything. Reports are saying we’re only five years away from that. The oldest car will still have internet access. For so long, major radio stations and networks like MTV have made us to believe what they play is what you want to hear, and you want us to play it over and over again. But, I think today’s generation, with the internet, are showing that’s not true. People like Kehlani and Bryson Tiller are breaking through without radio, doing it the grassroots way. I feel like reality TV is very close to being burned out and it’s going to return to sitcoms, talk shows and classic music videos. They’re really going to start bringing that real and raw back. Too many fake people have been winning lately.\n\nWith all of your accomplish to this point — What is the ultimate end goal for you?\n\nI can’t say right now, because it always changes. Every two years my goals change. There could be something my sights are set on now, but that may shift once I get there. The end goal is always evolving. I may be running a radio station. I may be the next Doc Winters in the next 10 years, I’m not sure. I definitely know I’m blessed with a great programming mind. Who knows — I could end up putting labels out of business, who knows [laughs]? I’m tired of all the politics. I’m tired of the industry being ran by money and brands running things. I want to get back to grassroots. Just great talent. Great music. I’m just a fan of raw talent, I don’t like the fake. That’s what I want to focus on, changing the industry for the better.\n\nAs a woman and Latina, what are some of the things you’ve had to do to earn credibility and be taken seriously?\n\nI’ve had to do so many things. Lift dirty boxes. Clean dirty storage rooms. I’ve had to do all of these extra things, when I could’ve been focusing on shadowing or studying other DJ’s like my male counterparts got to do, I was stuck doing other things to earn the same amount of respect. I’ve had to DJ on everything from trash cans to washer and dryers. I’ve lifted record crates. I’ve done it all."
