        "text": "Last week Grammy-winning, global megastar, DJ Khaled hosted a press conference in his hometown of Miami, announcing an exclusive partnership with Def Jam Recordings for his We The Best record label, as well as his future releases as a multi-platinum recording artist.\n\nDJ Khaled, a celebrated artist, producer, DJ, and curator that has amassed global sales of over 20 million in singles, 6 million in albums, and 4 billion-plus in streams, will be joining the Universal Music Group in an executive role, serving as the Global Creative Consultant to Def Jam and UMG’s family of artists worldwide.\n\nThis major announcement serves as a homecoming for Khaled, who originally took on an executive A&R position at the label in 2008, developing hits for major stars like Rick Ross.\n\n“This new chapter marks a special time for me. The energy at this point in my career is at an all-time high and I’m grateful to Sir Lucian Grange for allowing me to join his empire at this stage in my journey,” says DJ Khaled. “Together, we will achieve even greater heights and take it to the next level. I feel blessed and so inspired with renewed energy. I’m excited to not only partner, with but to come back home to Def Jam. Tunji Balogun is not only an extraordinary A&R, but a true music-man and visionary who continuously is responsible for introducing the world to some of its next greatest superstars. I’m excited to join my sister and visionary executive LaTrice Burnette once again, as we have had tremendous success on every single project we have collaborated on in the past. Def Jam is the culture and together we will make history yet once again.”\n\nUniversal Music Group’s Chairman and CEO, Sir Lucian Grainge stated that “DJ Khaled is a great artist, hitmaker, mentor and cultural innovator. It gives me great pleasure to welcome him home to UMG where we look forward to working together to amplify his brilliant creative instincts and unique vision.”\n\n“Beyond a proven hitmaker, incredible producer, undeniable artist, and consummate showman, DJ Khaled occupies the rarified air of cultural icon,” said Chairman and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, Tunji Balogun. “His uncanny ability to continuously have his finger on the pulse of the culture, to reach audiences all over the world in innovative yet authentic ways, and his remarkable savvy for marketing, promoting and eventizing everything he touches is absolutely second to none. We are thrilled to partner with DJ Khaled and We The Best, both as a multi-platinum, award-winning artist and as a valued executive. Without a doubt, Khaled can only make us better.”\n\nJust a week prior, during the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, DJ Khaled was joined by an all-star cast including longtime friend, collaborator, and manager JAY-Z, rap superstars Rick Ross and Lil Wayne, and new Def Jam label-mate Fridayy, for a showstopping performance of his ‘Song Of The Year’ nominated smash “GOD DID”. This song was just one of his six nominations for the night, not including his ten Grammy nominations overall. Over the course of his legendary career, Khaled has been nominated for 15 BET Awards, an astounding 56 BET Hip-Hop Awards, 15 MTV Video Music Awards, and countless prizes and recognitions across the globe.\n\n“God Did” is the title track of DJ Khaled’s thirteenth full-length studio album, GOD DID, his fourth career #1 debut on the Billboard Top 200 and fifth straight #1 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. The album arrived with an unprecedent rollout of music videos, interviews and cultural conversation, and notched 10 entries on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAlong with this announcement, Khaled used this time to let the media and his fans know that he has once again joined forces Jordan for one of the most-anticipated sneaker releases, the ‘We The Best Air Jordan V.’ A proud member of the Jordan family of athletes, entertainers, and other collaborator. Khaled represents the overall spirit of the brand; dedication to greatness, commitment to excellence, a love for the culture, and a desire to have an impact for the community. With the company focused on “Self-Belief” f0r 2023, Khaled is proud to be among the standard bearers of this positive message. His We The Best Foundation will continue its partnership with the Jordan Brand Black Community Commitment which over the last two years has invested almost seventeen million dollars with 75 non-profits, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Ida B Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, and the Legal Defense Fund.\n\nKhaled also announced his partnership with streetwear retailer Snipes for a Miami location opening later this year. Serving as the Chief Creative Officers for Snipes, Khaled has partnered with the leading sneaker and streetwear retailer to bring this new and exciting retail experience to South Florida. The We The Best Snipes store, which will live in the heart of Collins Avenue will include Snipes apparel and exclusive co-branded merchandise. Visitors will be entertained by a live DJ, a sound booth for up-and-coming artists, and a showcase of the hottest apparel from local Miami fashion designers.\n\nAlso during this event, Khaled was honored with both a key to the City of Miami and a key to the City of Miami Beach in recognition of his ongoing work in the community. February 9th is now recognized by proclamation as We The Best Day in the city of Miami and November 26th is recognized as Khaled Khaled day in the City of Miami Beach.\n\nTweet"
