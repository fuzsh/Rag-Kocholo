        "text": "What is DJ Khaled's Net Worth?\n\nDJ Khaled is an American record producer, radio personality, rapper, DJ, and record label executive who has a net worth of $95 million. DJ Khaled began his career as a radio host on the urban music station WEDR-FM. He gained recognition for his work as a DJ and record producer, collaborating with numerous high-profile artists. Khaled founded his own record label, We the Best Music Group, and released several successful studio albums, including \"We the Best,\" \"We the Best Forever,\" and \"Grateful.\" His albums often feature an all-star lineup of guest artists, showcasing his ability to bring together top talent in the music industry.\n\nKnown for his infectious enthusiasm and motivational phrases like \"We the Best\" and \"Another One,\" DJ Khaled has become a cultural icon. His music often blends hip-hop, rap, and R&B with hit singles such as \"I'm on One,\" \"All I Do Is Win,\" and \"Wild Thoughts.\" Beyond music, Khaled has ventured into other areas, including writing a book, \"The Keys,\" which shares his insights on success.\n\nOutside of his music career, DJ Khaled has earned tens of millions from endorsement deals with companies like Weight Watchers, T-Mobile Ciroc, and Apple.\n\nEarly Life\n\nKhaled Mohamed Khaled was born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Palestinian parents who emigrated to the United States. He has described himself as a devout Muslim. His brother, Alec Ledd (Alaa Khaled), is an actor. His parents were musicians who played Arabic music. Khaled developed an interest in rap and soul music as a young boy, and his parents supported his interest. He worked in a local record store, which helped to lay the foundations for his music career.\n\nCareer\n\nKhaled first became known in the 1990s when he was a DJ on the Miami hip-hop radio station 99 Jamz. His job at the radio station is what led the group Terror Squad to hire Khaled as their DJ. Once he had a few credits to his name with Terror Squad, Khaled moved into curating albums and released his debut studio album \"Listennnâ€¦ the Album\" in 2006. Khaled went on to release \"We The Best\" in 2007, \"We Global\" in 2008, \"Victory\" in 2010, \"We the Best Forever\" in 2011, \"Kiss the Ring\" in 2012, \"Suffering from Success\" in 2013, \"I Changed A Lot\" in 2015, \"Major Key\" in 2016,\" \"Grateful\" in 2017, and \"Father of Asahd\" in 2019. His album \"Khaled Khaled\" was released in 2021, with \"God Did\" following in 2022.\n\nOne of Khaled's most successful songs is \"All I Do Is Win,\" which features Ludacris, Rick Ross, Snoop Dogg, and T-Pain. The song is off Khaled's 2010 album \"Victory\" and was the album's second single. The song has been certified three times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nBack in late 2015 and early 2016, some Snapchat videos of Khaled talking about his \"key to success\" got a lot of attention due to his larger-than-life personality. He became an internet star, and some people called him a \"living meme.\" Today, Khaled is one of the most sought-after producers in hip-hop and a very popular social media personality.\n\nIn 2018, he joined Demi Lovato as the opening act for her Tell Me You Love Me Tour, which kicked off in San Diego, California, in February 2018 and ran through July 2018.\n\nOn May 21, 2019, DJ Khaled shared a new video for \"Wish Wish,\" featuring Cardi B and 21 Savage. Directed by Khaled and Eif Rivera, the clip features lots of explosions, fire, and motocross riders, which looks like a B-level early-2000s street-racing movie raced into production to capitalize on the success of the first Fast and The Furious.\n\nKhaled wrote the book \"The Keys\" which made the New York Times Best Seller list. The book includes his opinions on success, recounts life stories, and describes contributions from other musicians.\n\nHe has also worked as an actor, starring in 2017's \"Pitch Perfect 3,\" 2019's \"Spies in Disguise,\" and in 2020's \"Bad Boys for Life.\"\n\nAwards\n\nIn 2008, he received the DJ of the Year awards both at the Ozone Awards and BET Hip Hop Awards. In 2016, he won the ASCAP Rhythm and Soul Awards for Best R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for \"Hold You Down\" and \"How Many Times.\" Both songs feature Chris Brown, August Alsina, Future, and Jeremiah. In 2017, he won the ASCAP Rhythm and Soul Awards for Best R&B/Hip-Hop Song for \"I Got the Keys\" (featuring Jay-Z and Future) and the Best Rap Song award for \"For Free\" (featuring Drake). Also in 2017, he won the award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Song at the American Music Awards for \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne). As of 2023, Khaled has won a total of 13 BET Hip Hop Awards, two BET Awards, one Soul Train Music Award, an MTV Video Music Award, an MTV Europe Music Award, and a Grammy.\n\nLegal Issues\n\nIn November 2018, Khaled agreed to a total settlement of $750,000 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose payments accepted from issuers of an initial coin offering, specifying a personal $50,000 promotional payment from beleaguered cryptocurrency firm Centra Tech Inc., whose co-founders were indicted for fraud in May 2018. According to the SEC, \"they are its first cases involving charges for violating rules on touting investments in so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs.\" Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was also implicated in this event.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nKhaled and his wife, Nicole Tuc,k had their first son, Asahd Tuck Khaled, on October 23, 2016. Khaled garnered national attention after streaming the birth live on his Snapchat account. On January 20, 2020, Tuck gave birth to their second son, Aalam Tuck Khaled.\n\nSalary Highlights\n\nBetween September 2017 and September 2018, DJ Khaled earned an impressive $30 million thanks to touring, producing, and, most importantly, endorsements. The vast majority of his earnings in a given year are from endorsements with companies like Ciroc, Apple, and even Weight Watchers. He is one of the highest-paid people in hip-hop and his money doesn't actually have that much to do with hip-hop or even music in general.\n\nDJ Khaled's Career Earnings By Year\n\n2014: $7 million\n\n2015: $8 million\n\n2016: $15 million\n\n2017: $24 million\n\n2018: $27 million\n\n2019: $39 million\n\n2020: $35 million\n\n2021: $35 million\n\n2022: $20 million\n\n2023: $15 million\n\nTotal (so far): $225 million\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn January 2017, Khaled purchased Robbie Williams's former house in Mulholland Estates, a gated community in Los Angeles, for $9.9 million. He sold this home in April 2021 for $12.5 million, $1.5 million over his original asking price!\n\nIn 2018, Khaled purchased a waterfront home in Miami for $25.9 million."
