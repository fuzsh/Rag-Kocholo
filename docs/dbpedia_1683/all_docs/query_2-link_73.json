When it comes to his discography, DJ Khaled has worked with the best in the business.\n\nEver since his debut studio album in 2006, the 42-year-old hip hop star has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music to put out his signature hits. Fast forward more than a decade later, he has amassed a celebrity roster of colleagues few in Hollywood can claim.\n\nFor the star, it comes down to maintaining his relationships and wanting the best. \"They know I'mma hit a home run. They know I ain't just coming with just a record and I don't want just a feature either,\" he previously told MTV of his collaborations. \"I want the best work.\""
