        "text": "A common criticism against artists—everyone from The Beatles to Pitbull—is that all their music sounds the same. With DJ Khaled, though, who released his 11th studio album, Father of Asahd, this morning, the homogeneity of his music is borderline impressive—mostly because he doesn’t really make his music.\n\nNo, lest you forget, Khaled doesn’t sing or rap. He hardly produces, and his DJing days are largely behind him. What he does do is act as a honking sort of inspirational wind-up doll. He assembles big skyscrapers of songs and signs them with garish catchphrases (“We the best music!”, “DJ Khaled!”, “They don’t want you to…”, “Another one”). His palette is gold. His message is one of self-belief, triumph over detractors, and money making; in short, winning. “They jealous, they want us to fold. That will never happen. They want us broke, so you know what we gonna do? We gonna become billionaires,” he bellows on 2016’s Major Key cut “Ima Be Alright.” His music, book, and social media feeds are littered with nearly identical pearls; they never get much deeper, more introspective, or less bombastic.\n\nThe theme of underestimated superiority and the presence of Khaled’s airhorn voice are, in part, what makes one Khaled song sound like the next. But sonically and structurally, his songs can also bleed into one another. More than simply dominating pop radio, Khaled’s catalog is pop radio. As on Father of Asahd, which features a murderer’s row of superstars—Cardi B, 21 Savage, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Big Sean (all within the first three songs)—Khaled has made a career of bringing music’s biggest stars together and dulling their edges. His songs tend towards tropical rhythms and emphatic sentiments, hip-hop done catchy and bright. Each one aims to be a club anthem; and indeed, they’re best experienced after a few strong fruity beverages.\n\nKhaled’s most impressive feat—and truly, it is impressive—is his ability to corral so many big names, so frequently, and get them to play nicely in his sandbox. If he were a superhero, he would be Nick Fury. And viewed from a remove, his universe resembles Marvel’s. His albums are based in primary colors, full of narrative cliches, and they prize starpower.\n\nThough Khaled hasn’t quite dominated music the way Marvel has dominated movies, he’s done better than DC. Despite how little he actually seems to do, the 43-year-old has seven top ten albums and 29 Hot 100-charting singles to his name. And to his credit, now and again, artists give genuinely dynamic performances on his songs. Kendrick Lamar spit absolute fire on 2016’s “Holy Key” and J. Lo arguably had the best song of the summer last year with “Dinero.” And Father of Asahd may be Khaled’s best effort to date. It, at least, features the most memorable moments. There’s Cardi B channeling some primo Pardison Fontaine bars (“Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted”) on “Wish Wish,” there’s a swag-dripping Bey-Jay (and Future) team-up on “Top Off,” and there’s a moving appearance from (and tribute to) the late Nipsey Hussle on the reverent gospel track “Higher.”\n\nMaybe it shouldn’t come as a surprise, but Khaled’s only been gaining steam these past few years. His last two albums, 2017’s Grateful and 2016’s Major Key, both went Number 1. (Despite Tyler, the Creator’s best efforts, Father of Asahd probably will, too.) And in 2017 he landed his first Number 1 single, bringing Chance the Rapper, Justin Bieber, and Quavo together for the candy-coated, “I’m the One.” Next week, there will be a Khaled documentary to accompany the album.\n\nKhaled’s momentum can be attributed in large part to the mythology he’s cultivated on social media. His Snapchat account, on which he espouses sage gems like “The key to success is using the right soap,” is one of the platform’s most followed, thanks to his relentless posting and his winking teddy bear hype man charm.\n\nBut in every other respect, Khaled’s persona and skillset would seem to be a poor fit for this moment. His hollow vision of success and self-worth is unmistakably Trumpian. And his conventionally buoyant, radio-friendly approach to pop music is out of step at a time when pop’s center is dissolving. It can feel as though he has us all—fans and artists alike—hypnotized, like he can bark “Another one” ad infinitum and we’ll all just keep nodding our heads. Certainly, it won’t stop with Father of Asahd. Sometimes the declaration of winning begets actual winning."
