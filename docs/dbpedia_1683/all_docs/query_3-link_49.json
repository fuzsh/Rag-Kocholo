        "text": "DJ Khaled has us all feeling “the best” this Friday (Aug. 11) as the Flordia native dropped a new single featuring “Supposed To Be Loved” with Lil Baby, Future, and Lil Uzi Vert. The Grammy-winning producer also released the trailer for his upcoming album Til Next Time. The promo features DJ Khaled’s sons Asahd and Aalam Tuck Khaled and his wife Nicole Tuck Khaled. The trailer shows the producer’s everyday life enjoying the beach and the basketball court.\n\nWhile the title seemingly suggests the producer will leave the booth for good, he assured fans that it’s not a “goodbye.”\n\n“The day I decide to walk away from the game you’re gonna know that very moment that you were witnessing the greatest to ever do it,” he wrote alongside the trailer. “This ain’t goodbye…it’s TIL NEXT TIME. Next chapter. Next blessing. Next level. Onward. This is my biggest album. I feel it. The recording process has been UNBELIEVABLE and I can’t wait to share it with the world. And remember…I’ll always be here if you need me…I’m only a phone call away.”\n\nRELATED: DJ Khaled, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross + More Perform 'God Did'\n\nThis upcoming album will mark the Grammy winner’s 14th studio album. He partnered with Def Jam earlier this year and it will also be a milestone project as it will be his first coinciding with his own We The Best Music Group and the label.\n\n“This new chapter marks a special time for me,” said Khaled in statement in February per Billboard. “The energy at this point in my career is at an all-time high, and I’m grateful to Sir Lucian Grainge for allowing me to join his empire at this stage in my journey. Together, we will achieve even greater heights and take it to the next level. I feel blessed and so inspired with renewed energy. I’m excited to not only partner but to come back home to Def Jam.”\n\nDJ Khaled has not announced a release date for Til Next Time.\n\nListen to “Supposed To Be Loved” with DJ Khaled, Lil Baby, Future and Lil Uzi Vert below:\n\nThe Best Hip-Hop and R&B Songs of 2023 (So Far)\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
