        "text": "Round Table Discussion: 10 Months and 35 days after Major üîë,DJ Khaled lets loose another album ,thoughts, and important questions we should ask ourselves.\n\nDJ Khaled is letting loose his 10th Studio album- Grateful, June 23rd. Members of the Urbancentral team discuss what this album could mean for the man born Khaled Mohamed Khaled, the effect of dropping two full‚Äã length Projects‚Äã within the same calendar year-if any in this playlist era, why that Cover art deserves an award, will first week sales matter?, the features, the length, while highlighting the collaborations that could take the cake. HI RIHANNA! üòâ\n\nClover ‚Äî Urban Central Writer and Resident P.R.O\n\nLol please, The last time I saw a cluster of stars like this in one collection was when Real Madrid signed Zidane, Figo, Raul, Beckham, Ronaldo de Lima and others to create the Galacticos. Well, Khaled has unleashed ANOTHER ONE and Lol, yes I‚Äôve always wanted to say that.\n\nWhen he released Major Key, I knew that was just the beginning of his ascent to great things and the outstanding effect on his son‚Äôs self esteem.\n\nHe has made history again by not just featuring the number one acts in the music industry but also having his son becoming the youngest music executive producer in history. Ashad literally has made millions without using any English or recognized language on earth-Massive. In my years of experience working with various djs across the country, what Khaled has done is on another level.\n\nI know Blue is the kid of the beehive Queen. But ask yourself this, do you really think you‚Äôd ever forget the name Ashad?. Khaled is officially the producer of the year and the father of the moment.\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid B.S. ‚Äî Urban Central Editor and Resident Hip-Hop Elitist\n\nIs there a regulation as to the duration within which an artist is to release successive albums? The answer is obviously a resounding ‚Äòno!‚Äô.\n\nPersonally, I don‚Äôt think that should even come up for discussion but rather, anticipation. I came across someone critiquing the album for featuring same old artists except for the few new additions: Mr & Mrs Carter, Rihanna, Bryson Tiller and others. He even went on to state that Rick Ross should have laid claim to the album as co-owner because of his numerous contributions (in terms of numbers of tracks featured) to the album. Allow me a glance at your playlist and I believe I will find multiple albums of similar artists; aren‚Äôt you tired of listening to different shades of Kendrick Lamar, J Cole, Drake, Rihanna, to name a few in the name of new albums? Why don‚Äôt you search for a new artist each time you feel like downloading a song/album? Well, if you‚Äôre not, neither are we. All we hope for is a shade of this repeated artists that‚Äôs different from that which they offered us in the last album.\n\nI‚Äôm already in love with the Rihanna & Bryson Tiller featured ‚ÄúWild Thoughts‚Äù, though I don‚Äôt hold similar confession for ‚ÄúTo The Max‚Äù featuring Drake (maybe with enough playbacks, I will get to love it).\n\nPlease, anticipate the album and make sure you buy and not bootleg it. A lot of work has been put into this by arguably the ‚Äòhardest working DJ‚Äô on planet earth (exaggeration is allowed).\n\nLet‚Äôs discuss the content of the album by 24 June. Till then, pre-order a copy on iTunes (mind you, stocks always last). Lol!\n\nNico ‚Äî Urban Central Editor and Resident Trouble Maker\n\nListennn‚Ä¶ Khlaed , a testament to progress, aptly described by the Joe Budden line ‚ÄúI made it right before their eyes, like I was Benihanas‚Äù he went from Leaning Back with The Terror Squad, holding an umbrella for Fat Joe, and crafting pristine Hip Hop club tracks with a stellar supporting cast to holding the keys for a vault of Chart toppers.\n\nGrateful may not be great ‚Äî pun intended ‚Äî but we can be assured to get the quality of sound associated with Khaled. 23 tracks seem like Overkill when you already have the song of the Summer, but then I realized that Mr Major üîë is hoping to take advantage of streaming and the playlist phenomenon,that being said I‚Äôm ready to break the piggy bank to get a sneak preview of track 15, i finally get to hear YUGGHCK and Eh-heeehh on a Khaled song, I finally get to cross an entry off my bucket list.\n\nKhaled told us in 2011 that he was taking over, he has successfully ascended the throne, that Time Cover is only heartbeats away.\n\nP.S Asahd call me, I can be your Lawyer.\n\nDumniyk‚ÄîUrban Central Writer and Resident Apologist.\n\nAm I happy for a new Dj Khaled Album? sincerely I am indifferent about it. Khaled knows how to put alot of strange artists together to get the sound he wants. However he has a penchant of repeating his favorite artists, and this unfortunately makes alot of his music wander into obscurity quickly. This tracklist may be eye catching at first sight but I believe we would be taken for the same ride again. Unnecessary repetitive features and music will make up this album. I don‚Äôt expect any suprise hits after the ones we have heard so far.\n\nKhaled may have the gift of making hit singles albeit for the radio but I‚Äôll be honest, he misses often in creating classic albums, considering the fact that he is opportuned to work with alot of artists.\n\nHe found a safe ground in hip hop and made it his fortress unlike most of his counterparts that delve and experiment with other genres that they are unfamiliar with.\n\nPennedMusingsNG A.K.A Weird Liberal ‚Äî Urban Central Editor and Resident Philosopher\n\nAn argument ensued between myself and Kwame a.k.a Nico on the encroachment of creative direction by Record Labels and the few artistes who enjoy creative freedom; DJ Khaled was at the centre of it all. Arguably, no artiste has both embodied and benefited from label influence like Khaled. He‚Äôs reworked, popularized and rode the wave of sounds and styles over the last 10 years, almost like no other barring Drake. One listen, you could imagine L.A Reid or whoever saying; Khaled, I need those radio hits‚Ä¶ Migos will probably do it while Khaled replies; I got you in typical Khaled style.\n\nI first encountered Khaled‚Äôs own music in 2006 or 2007 and it was We Taking Over. I remember falling in love with The Runners and Cool & Dre through Khaled especially. After then, I‚Äôve liked him; he‚Äôs a strong character and quintessential reworking agent of trendy, under-harnessed sounds, through his vision on song patterns and implementation, and ear for beats, into memorable sub-genres, then feed them to a larger audience, while propelled by an insatiable appetite for relevance. His morph into and consistency/relevance as one of hiphop‚Äôs household names and foremost hitmakers over the last decade is no coincidence because his vision rarely fails him. Now, he seems to be who he‚Äôs always wanted to be; a bonafide star and it‚Äôs been a long time coming.\n\nOne thing that surprises me is the respect and love Khaled gets from even the biggest artistes. He will probably never make a tide-turning album worthy of true hiphop royalty status but he will probably never drop a dour album with no impact on the culture either. He‚Äôs already garnered enough publicity with the Asadh Movement and the success of I‚Äôm The One. I think those settle it for Grateful; it will be a successful album and probably get platinum certification because due to streaming, ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù has seemed more achievable. lately ‚Äî Stoney and Culture got certified platinum.\n\nSo, be ready folks; be ready for hard hitting kicks and drums, memorable trap sounds, catchy hooks, repeated mumbles, pointless nothings and a rich ensemble. Oh, and the empty but classically orchestrated Khaled screams, vague rhetorics and Asadh wank-fest ‚Äî he is an adorable baby though.\n\nI‚Äôm particularly buzzed for On Everything, It‚Äôs Secured, Don‚Äôt Quit and Down For Life. Although, I think topping Victory, Kiss The Ring and We The Best Forever will be tough for Khaled.\n\nI‚Äôm probably stating the obvious but the album‚Äôs length might be an antithesis; 23 tracks is too much, that even Khaled‚Äôs direction of feeding the fans exactly what they crave might not save it. But has a risky move ever stopped Khaled from doing whatever he wants? No.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this please click on ‚ù§Ô∏è below so others can find it."
