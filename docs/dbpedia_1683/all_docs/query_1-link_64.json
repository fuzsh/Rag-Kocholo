        "text": "DJ Khaled won't let anything get in the way of his love of golf — not even a painful wipeout.\n\nThe music producer, born Khaled Mohammed Khaled, revealed in an Instagram post Sunday that he injured himself last week while surfing. Despite the injury, Khaled has continued his daily regimen of playing golf.\n\n\"I have to play golf for a lot of reasons, for my mind, my peace,\" said Khaled in an Instagram video from the golf course Tuesday. \"And I'm in pain, I can't even lie to y'all. But I feel like I’m supposed to fight through this pain. I’m going to smoothen out my swing.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about Khaled's surfing accident.\n\nDJ Khaled reveals surfing accident: 'I'm in so much pain'\n\nOn Sunday, Khaled, 47, posted a video of himself getting a massage, during which he revealed he injured himself while surfing Saturday.\n\n\"I'm getting a massage right now 'cause I hurt myself yesterday surfing,\" Khaled said. \"I actually have the footage of me falling, flying in the sky, hitting the board on my ribs and belly-flopping into the water. I don't know if I'm going show it to you, but I have it.\"\n\nKhaled also said the severity of the injury interrupted his golf-playing routine. \"I'm in so much pain, and I tried to golf this morning,\" Khaled said. \"I made it to the eighth hole, and then I had to stop myself.\"\n\nIn another video shared on Instagram Sunday, Khaled brought the injury up during his golf round. \"I want to show you the footage so bad, 'cause I have the footage of me hurting my ribs,\" he said. That was immediately followed by a quick clip of the rapper falling off an airfoil, and then more golf.\n\nDJ Khaled shares full video of surfing accident\n\nKhaled posted a longer video of the accident off the coast of a Miami beach Sunday. Khaled can be seen kneeling on a speeding airfoil — a motorized surfboard — and attempting to stand up before falling and striking the board on the way down.\n\nAfter posting multiple videos of more golf, boating and other activities – while still remarking about his constant pain – the \"All I Do is Win\" and \"Wild Thoughts\" hitmaker went in for an X-ray.\n\n\"I’m just hoping it's just a bruised muscle or just a bruise,\" said Khaled in an Instagram video Monday. “I just want to make sure the bone ain’t broken because I’ve been up 48 hours, and I haven’t slept. This morning, I tried to explain to (the doctor) that the pain is high-level.\"\n\nDJ Khaled says surfing injury gave him 'bad bruise'\n\nIn his Instagram video Tuesday, Khaled gave an update on the diagnosis of his injury.\n\n\"The doctor said I got a big, real bad bruise,\" Khaled said. \"They’ve seen a little line on one of the bones. They’re not sure if it’s a fracture, so I’m going to double check. So, I do need to rest it up, but I have to play golf.\"\n\nDespite the pain, Khaled revealed the accident might have helped his golf game. \"I got the big injury,\" Khaled said. \"But it's actually making my swing super smooth.”\n\nSurfing accident is DJ Khaled's latest water trauma\n\nThis isn't DJ Khaled's first water-based accident. It's his third.\n\nIn December 2017, the Grammy-winning artist was injured in a waterskiing accident that left him trapped in some tree branches. He videoed himself during the ordeal, cutting his leg while trying to get away.\n\nIn 2015, Khaled posted a Snapchat video of himself on a jet ski off the coast of Miami, lost in the dark, telling viewers, \"It's not easy to make it. The key is to win.\" He ultimately made it to safety.\n\nFrom 2015: DJ Khaled gets lost at sea, captures it all on Snapchat\n\nMore celeb injuries: Eugenio Derbez opens up about recent accident, says doctors 'needed to reconstruct my arm'\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra, USA TODAY"
