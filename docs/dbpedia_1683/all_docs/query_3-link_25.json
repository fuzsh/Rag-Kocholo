Billboard announced on 30 May that Tyler had debuted at number one with 165,000 albums sold, while Khaled had 137,000.\n\nBillboard has yet to make an official statement on the matter, but reports suggest the company found “strange anomalies in the data”, and that the decision was based on chart rules following discussions with Khaled’s management, Sony Records and Nielsen.\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music\n\nSign up now for a 30-day free trial\n\nSign up\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music\n\nSign up now for a 30-day free trial\n\nSign up\n\n“We dispute [Billboard’s] decision on behalf of DJ Khaled and, frankly, every artist who is forced to navigate bundling an album download with an inexpensive item that still effectively represents their brand,” Desiree Perez, chief operating officer at Khaled’s management company Roc Nation, told the New York Times over the weekend. “It’s confusing and demeaning to the art.”\n\n\"We’re obviously not fans of bundling, nor should anyone who cares about artists making music. But our hands are being forced by Billboard’s desperate, last-ditch effort to keep streaming from eliminating what’s left of music downloads.”\n\nBillboard has announced that it has reviewed its rules allowing artists to bundle albums with merch, and will outline a new policy for 2020.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
