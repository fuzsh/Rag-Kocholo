        "text": "Image via Complex Original.\n\n25.\"I'm the One\" f/ Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne\n\nAlbum: Grateful (2017)\n\nProducer: DJ Khaled and Nic Nac\n\nThe second single from DJ Khaled’s upcoming record, Grateful, features an all-star cast, including Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne. The video, executive produced by Asahd Khaled, a child, shows Khaled hanging out on the grounds of his lavish estate with a group of gorgeous ladies and his artist pals. “I’m the One” displays that cocky charm that Khaled and each featured artist is entitled to. Each is an icon in their own right and the ladies that happen to cross their path have to know: They’re the one. —Nora-Grayce Orosz\n\n24.“Take It to the Head” f/ Chris Brown, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne\n\nAlbum: Kiss the Ring (2012)\n\nProducer: The Runners, DJ Khaled\n\nYou can rely on Khaled to move between street-approved bangers and club-ready jams. The lead single for his sixth album stick is the latter, and finds Nicki Minaj making her We The Best debut on this sultry track. Nicki goes full E.L. James with fan fic about a sugar daddy, but Chris Brown steals the show with an earworm of a hook. Another Khaled layup.—Frazier Tharpe\n\n23.\"Jermaine's Interlude\" f/ J. Cole\n\nAlbum: Major Key (2016)\n\nProducer: Hollywood JB\n\nJ. Cole has turned his career into an island. Mr. Platinum With No Features, Cole’s retreated into his own sound, persona, and ideology. Which makes you wonder how Khaled, hip-hope’s great facilitator, get a track from him? That’s a question that’s best left unanswered; Khaled makes songs you never expected to hear—his truest skill. “Jermaine’s Interlude” is an unburdened, loose Cole—freed from the narrative weight of his own albums, he’s still recognizable, but a bit freer to try a more expressionistic delivery. The squawking chorus paired with a rough-edged marathon of a verse make for one of Cole’s most underrated songs. It’s a stylistic outlier in Khaled’s oeuvre, but one of his best. —Brendan Klinkenberg\n\n22.“Hold You Down” f/ Chris Brown, August Alsina, Future & Jeremih\n\nAlbum: I Changed a Lot (2015)\n\nProducer: Lee On the Beats, Bkorn, LDB, DJ Khaled\n\nThe most under-appreciated section of DJ Khaled's catalog is the smooth R&B songs, especially the 2015 jam \"Hold You Down\" featuring Chris Brown, Jeremih, Future, and August Alsina. The hook features some equally fire crooning from Alsina and Jeremih, while Breezy and Future provide standout verses; Future raps about traveling with ladies to Abu Dhabi and treating their bodies like new Bugattis. It doesn't get much realer than that. —Zach Frydenlund\n\n21.“I Wish You Would” f/ Kanye West & Rick Ross\n\nAlbum: Kiss the Ring (2012)\n\nProducer: Hit-Boy\n\nOver the course of his career, DJ Khaled has mastered the art of matching multiple artists with perfect production to make anthems. On \"Wish You Would,\" Kanye West and Rick Ross trade verses over a menacing Hit-Boy beat, resulting in a triumphant record about daring your haters to try it. \"Wish You Would\" won't rank near the top of Kanye and Rozay's catalog together, but it's a solid effort that stands out for a very good Ross verse: \"My money on another level, in the streets out here I'm hotter than the fucking devil.\" Kanye's hook keeps it simple and his crooning during the final section is enough for \"Wish You Would\" to qualify as \"another one\" for Khaled. —Zach Frydenlund\n\n20.\"Nas Album Done\" f/ Nas\n\nAlbum: Major Key (2016)\n\nProducer: DJ Khaled, 808-Ray, Cool & Dre\n\nWith a cigar in one hand and the elixir of life (read: Henny) in another, Nas brought that old feeling back on “Nas Album Done,” a standout cut off Khaled’s Major Key that doubles as a warning shot for those who may have forgotten how deadly he is with the pen. The first verse in particular captures this ferocity, which is reinforced by a nasty flip of Fugees’ “Fu-Gee-La.” Despite the title, Nas’ album technically isn’t done, but make no mistake; Escobar Season is on the horizon. When that time comes, neck meet foot. —Edwin Ortiz\n\n19.“For Free” f/ Drake\n\nAlbum: Major Key (2016)\n\nProducer: Ninteen85, Jordan Ullman\n\nIn 2016, we've seen Drake perfect a new pop style, a quest that began with “Find Your Love” in 2010, continued with “Take Care” and “Hold On We're Going Home,” and really took hold with his ubiquitous 2015 “Hotline Bling.” Tapping into that sound, Drake connected with DJ Khaled on “For Free,” a smooth summer anthem that finds Drizzy channeling Too $hort. He tries to project a carefree air while also wondering whether or not his sex game is good enough that he should charge. Bold move by Drizzy (or any man?), but it makes for a fun song, even if it feels minimal in terms of features, for a Khaled release. —Zach Frydenlund\n\n18.“Never Surrender” f/ Scarface, Jadakiss, Meek Mill, Akon, John Legend & Anthony Hamilton\n\nAlbum: Suffering From Success (2013)\n\nProducer: StreetRunner, DJ Khaled\n\nFlipping a sample popularized by J Dilla on his final album Donuts, \"Never Surrender\" is a melancholy showcase of bars. Smokey Robinson's otherworldly falsetto drives the song as Scarface kicks the song off, setting the bar insanely high for a posse cut. Everyone featured sounds like they've seen enough for two lifetimes. But, like the title says, that's no reason to give up. —Ross Scarano\n\n17.\"Holy Key\" f/ Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar, and Betty Wright\n\nAlbum: Major Key (2016)\n\nProducer: DJ Khaled, Edsclusive, Cool & Dre\n\nUnlike other Khaled collabos, \"Holy Key\" looks sensible on paper. Big Sean and Kendrick Lamar—differences aside—are both skilled, god-fearing MCs. And Betty Wright, well, she needs no introduction. The final product delivers exactly what was promised: an enormous display of power and piety. —Ross Scarano\n\n16.“They Ready” f/ J. Cole, Big K.R.I.T. & Kendrick Lamar\n\nAlbum: Kiss the Ring (2012)\n\nProducer: J. Cole, Canei Finch\n\nOne of the great pleasures of a Khaled album is checking out the lineup for a given song and imagining the thematic fun everyone featured will try to have with it. \"They Ready\" is clearly meant to be a look for the New School, with a freshmen-only casting call—at the time, good kid, m.A.A.d city hadn't dropped and Cole and K.R.I.T. were riding the waves of their studio debuts. All three of these Rap Twitter-certified new jacks turn in fun verses about how they're going to fuck the game up. Imagine how big the internet explosion would be if they did a follow-up today. —Frazier Tharpe\n\n15.“Welcome to My Hood” f/ Rick Ross, Plies, Lil Wayne & T-Pain\n\nAlbum: We the Best Forever (2011)\n\nProducer: The Renegades, DJ Khaled, DJ Nasty\n\nIt's five years, but the 2011 banger \"Welcome to My Hood\" still encapsulates what Khaled's career is all about. The track features energetic production, a fire hook from T-Pain, and stellar verses from Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, and Plies—before he found his perhaps true calling of \"Sweet Pwussy Satday.\" Listening to the song now, it's a reminder of a time when Wayne killed every feature he jumped on, and that T-Pain used to be the most reliable hook man in the game. —Zach Frydenlund\n\n14.\"Shining\" f/ Beyoncé and Jay Z\n\nAlbum: Grateful (2017)\n\nProducer: DJ Khaled, Danja\n\nI never want to hear questions about what DJ Khaled does, his impact, Asahd's skills as an executive producer, etc. Never again. Jigga and Beyoncé on the same fucking song, my G. Can your fave call in this favor? I think the fuck not. So it's not Beyoncé's best but what, did you think she was going to give Khaled Lemonade levels? Even when Bey's coasting, she's soaring. And your man Jigga took off the blazer after the Roc Nation brunch and somehow made Dad rap sound cool and charming while sonning Drake in the same breath? This is feel-good rap, that lost-the-Grammy-but-the-streets-know-what-the-Album-of-the-Year-was-anyway music. Only Beyoncé and Hov can drop a song about winning on a night they took a light L and have it still be factually accurate. It takes real skill—and perhaps, a Khaled top-edit—to make that perpetually good feeling most of us can't even fathom feel relatable. Let some love in your life and let the top down, if you hate this song you hate yourself. —Frazier Tharpe\n\n13.“I Got the Keys” f/ Jay Z and Future\n\nAlbum: Major Key (2016)\n\nProducer: Southside, Jake One, G Koop\n\nThis is Khaled's value to the game in microcosm. Poll even the most optimistic, open-minded music listeners and everyone would have agreed, pre-summer '16, that the idea of a Jay Z and Future collab sounded shaky at best. And yet here is “I Got the Keys,” which achieves the three-pronged marvel of having Future do what he does best, getting Jay Z to lyrically dazzle in ways that have proved inconsistent as of late, and then have both of these acts blend together seamlessly. With Khaled as the maestro, it's a thrilling success. Next time some lost soul asks “But what does DJ Khaled do?” point to this as a recent reminder. —Frazier Tharpe\n\n12.“No New Friends” f/ Drake, Rick Ross & Lil Wayne\n\nAlbum: Suffering From Success (2013)\n\nProducer: Boi-1da, Noah “40” Shebib, Vinylz, Alen Ritter\n\nIf \"I'm on One\" is Khaled's Jurassic Park (that is, a dominant blockbuster), then \"No New Friends\" is his Lost World: a repeat-what-worked sequel that's nevertheless much better than a cash-grab sequel has any business being. Once again, Drake gifts Khaled with a song he clearly had in his own stash that nevertheless didn't fit the plan for his forthcoming album. It's a heater without a home, and the actual sequel to \"Started From the Bottom.\" (Besides the obvious cues it takes from \"Bottom's\" refrain, the \"Started\" ad-lib is tucked ever so slightly in the background throughout \"NNF.\") So this really isn't a record Khaled put together from scratch, nor are the ingredients mind-blowing. But it was enough to sustain and stand out in the already packed summer of '13. Proof that Khaled had more than earned a rep for being the guy you entrusted your excess fire to. —Frazier Tharpe\n\n11.“I Wanna Be With You” f/ Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross & Future\n\nAlbum: Suffering From Success (2013)\n\nProducer: Lee On the Beats, DJ Khaled\n\nThe charged interplay between Nicki Minaj and Future on \"I Wanna Be With You\" is romantic enough to make the listener imagine a sort of Marvin Gaye-Tammi Terrell collaborative EP between the two. And then Rick Ross shows up declaring \"I'ma sex her harder\" before making some car noises. This doesn't lend itself to a great fantasy, but it does make for a fun love anthem. —Ross Scarano\n\n10.“Victory” f/ Nas & John Legend\n\nAlbum: Victory (2010)\n\nProducer: The Inkredibles, DJ Khaled\n\nThe world weary talents of Nas and John Legend are again united by DJ Khaled on the title track for Victory. The blend of soul and old-school rap creates a feeling of success, like you're standing with the three looking down from some great height at the rest of the game. The piano keys ring out, Legend's voice soars, and Nas brings out his Escobar side. It's so sweet. —Alexander Krinsky\n\n9.“Holla at Me” f/ Lil Wayne, Paul Wall, Fat Joe, Rick Ross & Pitbull\n\nAlbum: Listennn… The Album (2006)\n\nProducer: Cool & Dre\n\nThe first single from Khaled's first proper albums is a hyper-caffeinated posse cut fueled by a classic Cool & Dre beat and anchored by the unmistakable sound of Paul Wall's voice. Lil Wayne is in beast mode (check the date) and Pitbull won't let you forget Khaled's love for Florida. It turns out that Khaled's had the keys since day one. —Ross Scarano\n\n8.“Go Hard (Remix)” f/ Kanye West, T-Pain & Jay Z\n\nAlbum: N/A\n\nProducer: The Runners\n\nAfter DJ Khaled released “Go Hard,” it wasn’t long before Jay Z hopped on the track to breathe fresh life into an already great song. Featuring the tried and true Auto-Tune glory of T-Pain and the brash hunger of a young Kanye West, the remix to \"Go Hard\" had the ingredients for greatness that Hov unlocked. —Alexander Krinsky\n\n7.“Hip-Hop” f/ Scarface, Nas & DJ Premier\n\nAlbum: Kiss the Ring (2012)\n\nProducer: J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League\n\nNas, DJ Premier, and Scarface—that song title isn't lying. Nas and Face drop a generous serving of bars and DJ Premier ties everything up with a bow on the outro: “You say you wanna rap/To this bitch you must commit/I fuck hip-hop.” DJ Khaled knows. —Alexander Krinsky\n\n6.“Grammy Family” f/ Kanye West, Consequence & John Legend\n\nAlbum: Listennn… The Album (2006)\n\nProducer: Kanye West, Jon Brion\n\n“Grammy Family” is an aspirational G.O.O.D. music anthem, a declaration of purpose from Kanye West and friends, for whom awards have never been something to shrug off. Produced by Kanye West and Late Registration's secret weapon Jon Brion, this is a family affair to inspire action. —Alexander Krinsky\n\n5.“I’m So Hood” f/ T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross & Plies\n\nAlbum: We the Best (2007)\n\nProducer: The Runners\n\n“I’m So Hood” is for the boys, the kind of song where you can feel the friendly energy of making music with your homies. Trick Daddy, T-Pain, Rick Ross, and Plies all come together in the name of Florida to create a gangster-centric track to never let you forget about their roots. Bringing people together as they are, no matter the circumstance, is a skill DJ Khaled mastered early and continues to excel at to this day. —Alexander Krisnky\n\n4.“Brown Paper Bag” f/ Dré, Young Jeezy, Juelz Santana, Fat Joe, Rick Ross & Lil Wayne\n\nAlbum: We the Best (2007)\n\nProducer: Cool & Dre\n\nThe triumphant “Brown Paper Bag” is a collision of talent. Over a finessed sample flip of Yvonne Elliman’s disco classic “If I Can’t Have You,” prime Lil Wayne introduces himself, “My name is Weezy Y’all!” and drops the kind of bars that made him the greatest of all time for at least a few years. But there's just something about that chorus, a soaring, gospel approach to dirty money in a plain school lunch bag, that makes the song so beloved. The audacity. —Alexander Krisnky\n\n3.“I’m on One” f/ Drake, Rick Ross & Lil Wayne\n\nAlbum: We the Best Forever (2011)\n\nProducer: T-Minus, Noah “40” Shebib, Nikhil “Kromatik” Seetharam\n\nIt's Khaled's song but “I’m on One” was Drake's first step to a new level of stardom in 2011, kicking off the incredible run that culminated in Take Care. To this day the hook—\"All I care about is money and the city that I'm from\"—is central to Drake's legacy and image, and his smooth transitions from singing to rapping then back to singing conjure memories of the summer this song was inescapable. Rick Ross and Lil Wayne have solid contributions, in particular Ross' London reference, but this will always be a moment for the kid from Toronto—that Khaled was able to bring into the world. —Alexander Krinsky\n\n2.“We Takin’ Over” f/ Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman & Lil Wayne\n\nAlbum: We the Best (2007)\n\nProducer: Danja\n\nThe first single from Khaled's second album, We the Best, is one of the quintessential Khaled cuts. By bringing together Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne, it's clear that he's using the royal “we.\" Nearly 10 years later the track, has over 100 million views on YouTube—seems like the takeover was a success. Go to a sporting event or house party and just let the crowd get a taste of the beat's ominous electronic opening and the reaction will be clear. —Alexander Krinsky\n\n1.“All I Do Is Win” f/ T-Pain, Ludacris, Rick Ross & Snoop Dogg\n\nAlbum: Victory (2010)\n\nProducer: DJ Nasty & LVM, DJ Khaled\n\n“All I Do Is Win” is, hands down, the most DJ Khaled of all of DJ Khaled's song, an anthem for sports teams and a radio staple. That pause just demands crowd participation, whether you're in your car by yourself or in an arena with thousands of people—“Everybody hands go UP!...AND THEY STAY THERE.” DJ Khaled knew he could keep the crowd floating with the jubilant vocals of T-Pain, the raw swagger of Rick Ross, and the cool aloofness of legend Snoop Dogg. Six years later the stand out track of Victory continues to mirror Khaled’s rise. —Alexander Krinsky"
