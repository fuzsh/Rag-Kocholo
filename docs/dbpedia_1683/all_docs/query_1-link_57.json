        "text": "Since the release of his debut album in 2006, DJ Khaled has been creating waves in the music industry, particularly when it comes to working with other artists. Over the years, the producer has collaborated with some of the most coveted artists in hip-hop and R&B, including Nicki Minaj, Drake, and Future.\n\nThe man is on the move these days, and don't expect him to slow down anytime soon. In fact, his next wave of partnerships will be even bigger than before, proving that Khaled is indeed the best at what he does.\n\nKhaled and his We The Best team invited For(bes) The Culture to Miami for a press conference unveiling a few major announcements. The press conference, which took place inside Mr.Chows at The W Hotel South Beach, informed the media that Def Jam Recordings and We The Best have now entered into an exclusive partnership for all of Khaled's upcoming albums as a multi-platinum recording artist.\n\nDef Jam Recordings\n\nDiddy opened the conference up with a video tribute to Khaled, stating “ We're going to announce the next chapter which is the best chapter of DJ Khaled’s life. It’s gonna be inspiring and it's gonna be motivating.”\n\nThe acclaimed DJ, record executive, record producer, and rapper has joined the Universal Music Group Family as a global creative consultant, supporting its rapidly growing artist roster. In this new role Khaled will work closely with the UMG team to guide and develop new talent, foster partnerships and produce innovative album projects for the music industry's most exciting marquee artists. He will continue his current roles as label head of We The Best Music Group.\n\nKhaled, who joined Def Jam as an executive A&R in 2008 and worked on the development of records for major artists like Rick Ross and others, celebrated his return home with this significant announcement.\n\nKhaled states, “This new chapter marks a special time for me. The energy at this point in my career is at an all-time high and I’m grateful to Sir Lucian Grainge for allowing me to join his empire at this stage in my journey. Together, we will achieve even greater heights and take it to the next level. I feel blessed and so inspired with renewed energy. “\n\nJordan Brand Partnership\n\nAlong with the news of his new label home, Khaled took the opportunity to update media and fans on other exciting happenings in his career.\n\nFor one of the most eagerly awaited shoe launches of the year, the We The Best Air Jordan V, Khaled has partnered with Jordan once more. The partnership extends a long-standing relationship that began thirteen years ago, in 2010, and was announced to the market through an innovative, creative, and distinctive campaign on par with both firms' respective reputations.\n\nThe principles of the brand—dedication to greatness, commitment to perfection, love of the culture, and desire to make a difference in the community—are personified by Khaled, a proud member of the Jordan family of athletes, artists, and other partners.\n\nReggie Saunders, vice president of entertainment marketing of Jordan brand at Nike, stepped up to the microphone to talk openly about Khaled and their upcoming project, saying, “This is the largest launch with any collaborator we’ve ever worked with in the brand. It's the most unique and digitally innovative. It was really cool to see that for the We The Best Jordan V, and we are excited for what else is to come.”\n\nThe Jordan Brand Black Community Commitment and the DJ Khaled We The Best Foundation will continue their collaboration. Over the past two years, the Jordan Brand Black Community Commitment has invested nearly 17 Million dollars with more than 75 nonprofit organizations, including the Legal Defense Fund, Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nRoc Nation Scholarship\n\nIn keeping with Khaled's philanthropic spirit and dedication, the We The Best Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization devoted to uplifting people in underserved communities across the United States and supporting various non-profits, announced its first scholarship program in collaboration with Roc Nation.\n\nGimel Androus Keaton, better known by his stage name Young Guru, spoke on the project and said, \"Me and Khaled did a lot of music and it's interesting that the last song that we made was God Done, it's a special thing to me. I grew up in a family who said ‘those that know God have a duty and that duty is to teach what you know to those that don’t know.” Guru continues, “I took on the role of director of the Roc Nation school's Music Technology, Entrepreneurship & Production department last year. We believed that doing this was essential to imparting modern knowledge to the next generation. When you look at Dj Khaled, you can see how someone who began at a simple label as a dj and became a global brand, which is what we teach at our university.”\n\nFelisha Agenor has been given this year's 2023 scholarship grant. The senior in high school won a full scholarship to the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment at Long Island University (LIU) Brooklyn for the duration of her four-year program.\n\nSnipes Store Collaboration\n\nThere was more to come in terms of announcement rollouts. Khaled an avid shoe collector has a vast fondness for sneakers, amassing over 10,000 pairs in his collection. He will collaborate closely with the founder of Snipes, a retailer of sneakers and streetwear, in his capacity as Chief Creative Officer to introduce Miami to a brand-new and thrilling retail experience. By fusing the cutting-edge retail experience for sneakers and streetwear with the immersive social shopping concept, the venture aims to spark the retail revolution in Miami.\n\nWe The Best Snipes will be a true representation of South Florida's sneaker and streetwear culture when it opens its concept store later this year in the heart of Collins Avenue. This concept store will offer a one-of-a-kind shopping experience thanks to its selection of the newest SNIPES clothing as well as unique co-branded products. Visitors will be entertained by a live DJ, a sound booth for up-and-coming musicians, and a display of the newest clothing from Miami fashion designers.\n\nKeys To The City\n\nKhaled was also able to make a \"major key\" alert when he was recognized in his hometown with both the City of Miami and the Miami Beach keys to the city — a play on words from his 2016 single \"I Got The Keys\" featuring Future and Jay-Z. Both mayor Dan Gelber and mayor Francis X. Suarez thanked Khaled for his ongoing volunteer work in the community and declared November 26 as \"Khaled Khaled\" Day in Miami Beach and February 9 as \"We The Best\" Day in Miami.\n\nMayor Dan Gelber of Miami Beach stated at the press conference, “ I’m not giving this award to Khaled because of his celebrity, we’re giving it time him because he has taken his celebrity and done something extraordinary and special with it. It’s my honor as Mayor of Miami beach to give Khaled the key to the city of miami.”"
