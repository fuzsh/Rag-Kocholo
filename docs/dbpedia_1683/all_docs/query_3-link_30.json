The energy at this point in my career is at an all-time high and I’m grateful to Sir Lucian Grainge for allowing me to join his empire at this stage in my journey. Together, we will achieve even greater heights and take it to the next level. I feel blessed and so inspired with renewed energy. I’m excited to not only partner, but to come back home to Def Jam. Tunji Balogun is not only an extraordinary A&R, but a true music-man and visionary who continuously is responsible for introducing the world to some of its next greatest superstars. I’m excited to join my sister and visionary executive LaTrice Burnette once again, as we have had tremendous success on every single project we have collaborated on in the past. Def Jam is the culture and together we will make history yet once again.”\n\nSir Lucian Grainge, UMG’s Chairman and CEO, said, “DJ Khaled is a great artist, hitmaker, mentor and cultural innovator. It gives me great pleasure to welcome him home to UMG where we look forward to working together to amplify his brilliant creative instincts and unique vision.”\n\n“Beyond a proven hitmaker, incredible producer, undeniable artist, and consummate showman, DJ Khaled occupies the rarified air of cultural icon,” said Tunji Balogun, Chairman and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. “His uncanny ability to continuously have his finger on the pulse of the culture, to reach audiences all over the world in innovative yet authentic ways, and his remarkable savvy for marketing, promoting and eventizing everything he touches is absolutely second to none. We are thrilled to partner with DJ Khaled and We The Best, both as a multi-platinum, award-winning artist and as a valued executive. Without a doubt, Khaled can only make us better.”\n\n“DJ Khaled has been a dear friend and close collaborator of mine for over a decade,” said LaTrice Burnette, Executive Vice President, Def Jam Recordings/President, 4th & Broadway. “Throughout our years together at Epic, Khaled and I developed a special working bond and broke barriers through a united vision, focused partnership and hard work. I have a tremendous respect for Khaled’s artistry, creativity, work ethic, marketing savvy, and boundless positive energy. I’m thrilled to welcome him back home to Def Jam, and can’t wait to see what we cook up next.”\n\nLast week, DJ Khaled was joined by an all-star cast – including longtime friend, collaborator, and manager JAY-Z, rap superstars Rick Ross and Lil Wayne, and new Def Jam label-mate Fridayy – for a showstopping performance of his ‘Song Of The Year’ nominated smash “GOD DID” at the 65th Annual Grammys Awards – one of his six nominations for the night and ten Grammy nominations overall.

Friends and faculty refer to as “The Achiever,” and she lives up to this moniker with a 4.2 GPA and active participation in seven clubs and sports such as Student Government Association, National Honors Society, Volleyball, and Softball, to name a few few. She also works as a Youth Worker for OYC at another local elementary school.\n\nToday, DJ Khaled also announces his partnership with streetwear retailer Snipes for a Miami location.
