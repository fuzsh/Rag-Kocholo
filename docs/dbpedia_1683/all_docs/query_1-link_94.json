        "text": "Reggae musician Sizzla is not pleased with the gifts DJ Khaled sent his way.\n\nIn an Instagram video posted Thursday Sizzla, showed off two platinum RIAA certification plaques for his work on DJ Khaled's 2017 album \"Grateful\" and his 2019 album \"Father of Asahd,\" before burning them.\n\nThe plaques featured the album art of both projects which mostly pictured images of DJ Khaled, his name, or his son Asahd. Sizzla's name was featured on the plaque near the \"presented to\" tag, but he still felt it was an \"insult,\" without divulging more information.\n\n\"You insult me, DJ Khaled,\" he said in the video. \"You insult Jamaica.\"\n\nSizzla and his friends recorded themselves destroying and burning the plaques but salvaged the portion of the album art that featured Asahd because the \"baby is innocent.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to reps for DJ Khaled and Sizzla for further comment.\n\nOn \"Grateful,\" the musician was predominantly featured on the opening track \"I'm So Grateful.\" A sample of his song \"Woman I Need You\" was featured on the track \"It's Secured\" which features Nas and Travis Scott.\n\nDJ Khaled's 2019 \"Father of Asahd\" also featured Sizzla in the intro song \"Holy Mountain.\"\n\nThe producer, record executive and DJ's latest album \"God Did\" is nominated for several Grammys this awards season with the title track getting a nod for best song, best rap performance, best rap album and best rap song.\n\n\"God Did\" features Sizzla and several other Jamaican artists including Skillibeng, Buju Banton, Capleton and Bounty Killer on \"These Streets Know My Name.\""
