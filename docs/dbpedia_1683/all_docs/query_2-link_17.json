Born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Khaled is of Palestinian descent, as his parents moved to the U.S. years before. He comes from a family of artists, with his brother Alec being an actor and both his father and his mother musicians. Khaled developed an interest in music through them and worked in a Merry-Go-Round record store, strengthening his interests.\n\nBefore fame, Khaled was a radio host on 99 Jamz and worked with Terror Squad, Lil Wayne, and other big names. In 2006, he released his debut studio album, “Listennn… the Album.” It gained gold certification and was soon followed by the D.J.’s sophomore album, “We the Best” (2007), which rose to the top 20 charts. The single ‘I’m So Hood,’ which features huge industry names such as T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Plies, and Rick Ross, peaked at number 28 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and 11 on the U.S. Hot Rap Tracks chart. The D.J. released his third studio album, “We Global,” in 2008. It featured Akon, Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Lil’ Boosie, Kanye West, and many more. That year, Khaled won the D.J. of the Year award at the B.E.T. Hip Hop Awards and Ozone Awards. He was subsequently appointed the President of Def Jam South in 2009. Khaled released “Victory,” his fourth studio album, in 2010. It featured appearances from Drake to Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Nelly, and more. The single ‘All I Do Is Win,’ which features Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and T-Pain, was certified triple-platinum by the R.I.A.A. Throughout his career, Khaled has released 12 studio albums. His fifth one, “We the Best Forever” (2011), brought him international fame. This album featured ‘I’m on One,’ his first top ten hit. His ninth album, “Major Key” (2016), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was also certified gold and even received a Best Rap Album Grammy nomination.\n\nKhaled’s 10th studio album “Grateful” (2017) featured ‘I’m the One’ and ‘Wild Thoughts’ which topped the charts.
