Vory)” 3/5\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2022, “We The Best Music” artist DJ Khaled teamed up with 32 of the top rappers and singers from around the world to create his 13th album, “GOD DID.” The 18-song album is full of generational talents such as Jay-Z, Drake, SZA and Future. Khaled, who made his start in the music industry as a DJ in the 1990s, later released his first official album in 2006. Since then, he has published 12 studio albums and has produced 56 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 with songs including, “I’m the One (feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne),” and “All I Do Is Win (feat. T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross).”\n\nAccording to Khaled in an interview with Billboard, Jay-Z, one of Khaled’s idols, claimed the album “GOD DID” is the best album Khaled has ever produced. Khaled also claimed the rapper was responsible for choosing the album cover, which depicts Khaled looking up while shedding a tear, symbolizing his joy for God’s blessings.\n\n“To get to a 13th album is beyond incredible for me,” Khaled said to Billboard. “The greats that I look up to, when I see how many albums they put out; I’m on the right track. I know how hard it is to be in this game – some people can’t make it past their first single or their first album.”\n\nThree weeks prior to the album’s release date, Khaled dropped “STAYING ALIVE (feat. Drake and Lil Baby),” which symbolizes the life of a rapper in the U.S. The song shows how Drake, Lil Baby and Khaled are still alive despite the stereotypes against rappers and are surrounded by many women who are attracted to their success and fame. Though the song peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 the day it dropped, for an opening song, it is generic and flat. The rap verses sound as if both Drake and Lil Baby are mumbling the lyrics. The slower, basic beat is a letdown and makes the song monotone rather than uniform. Although Drake’s chorus is catchy and has more flow, both rap verses are somewhat of a disappointment. Compared to Khaled’s previous hits, many were expecting a more upbeat rap to get you up on your feet to dance and sing.\n\nThe second song of the album, “GOD DID (feat. Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy),” has a sensational compilation of artists. The eight-minute song provides a clear message of how God has guided all of them to success and proved their doubters wrong.\n\n“But look at us now, oh they counted us out/They didn’t think that we would make it/They didn’t believe in us, oh but I know God did,” the lyrics state.\n\nThe collaborators switch off rapping verses as the words “God did” play in the background. Jay-Z is the highlight of the song, rapping for four minutes straight, and the lyrical masterpiece is definitely worth a listen — but only if you have lots of time!\n\nAlthough the title track “GOD DID” is the face of the album, the best song is “BEAUTIFUL (feat. Future and SZA).” In this stunning song, you get the best of both the rap and R&B worlds. Future sings the majority of the song, saying he has found someone worthy to settle down with. The song is very upbeat and pairs perfectly with his voice; however, SZA’s vocals are electrifying. Her higher-pitched voice is euphonious and having a small part in the song makes her lyrics more powerful.\n\n“I took a chance, and you grabbed it, you said, ‘Don’t worry, I got it,’ you said. And you just make me feel so beautiful,” the lyrics state.\n\nThis unique rap-love song is a must-listen no matter what mood you’re in.\n\nThe rest of “GOD DID” features other star artists such as 21 Savage, City Girls and Roddy Ricch, all of whom produce songs on track to hit the Billboard charts. Khaled has provided these rappers not only a chance to work together, but an opportunity to spread positive messages. Though he had a poor choice in his early release song, the rest of the album made up for it. “GOD DID” is a must-listen for all rap lovers."
