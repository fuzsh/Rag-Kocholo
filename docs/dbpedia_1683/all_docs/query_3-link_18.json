        "text": "When my friends who are not in tech ask me to explain Product Management, I use DJ Khaled as a perfect example to simplify the role. Like Product Managers, the role of DJ Khaled in the music industry is widely misunderstood. 1. DJ Khaled thinks about his customers and what they want to listen to and pays close attention to popular culture (the market) and its demands. 2. He starts with the problem, forms a vision and then constructs a clear idea of what record he wants to create. 3. DJ Khaled then relies on a team to execute his vision. He obviously can't do it on his own (Since he has no technical skills)! He is known to reach out to other stakeholders to pitch his idea and get their buy-in before he begins. 4. He works with producers (they are kind of like UX Designers) and artists (most similar to Software Engineers) to bring his vision to life. 5. While making a song, DJ Khaled always loves to create a collaborative environment that encourages creativity. He allows everyone to do what they do best but influences them to iterate on their outputs. Similar to the product execution/agile development stage. 6. After a version of the record is done but the vision isn't quite complete yet, DJ Khaled often has to do additional tasks like shooting a video, promoting the song, and creating catchy phrases (GOD DID!) to ensure it all resonates with the intended audience. If you're a Product Manager, you're the equivalent of DJ Khaled, a force that's the voice of the customer and the one who does what it takes to deliver delightful experiences to them.
