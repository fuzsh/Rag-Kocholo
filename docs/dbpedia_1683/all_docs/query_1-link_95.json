        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nThe wait is finally over. Today (August 26), DJ Khaled has brought forth his 13th studio album, God Did.\n\nKhaled has long been hailed as one of the greatest of all time (GOAT) in the music industry and, at this point, it is undeniable.\n\nSince the release of his debut album, Listennn…The Album, back in 2006, the Miami-bred music icon has been supplying fans with hits on a consistent basis, almost year after year.\n\nHe’s been known to produce some of the hottest collaborations ever seen and many of them provided listeners with timeless classics.\n\nKhaled, known for his catchy tracks and star-studded features, has done it once again with acts like Jay Z, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Drake and Future lending their skills on this latest project.\n\nIt definitely comes as no surprise that, ahead of its release, his newest album had fans anticipating what was to come.\n\nIn the artwork for the album, the 46-year-old Khaled shows his face against a green background with a single tear.\n\nIn a tweet, Khaled wrote that the tear represents tears of joy, from God’s blessing.\n\nThe new project carries 18 tracks that feature a whopping 30-plus names, including several Jamaicans.\n\nKhaled, who refers to Jamaica as his home, has built close relationships with many Jamaican artistes over the years and, at this point, fans can always look out for a Jamaican or Jamaicans on his projects.\n\nTrack 14 on the album, titled These Streets Know My Name, features some of Jamaica’s veteran dancehall and reggae artistes. The vocals of the Grunggaadzilla Bounty Killer, the Fyah Man Capleton, Gargamel Buju Banton and Sizzla are those that you’ll hear on the track, along with popular dancehall artiste Skillibeng.\n\nBounty Killer, Capleton and Buju Banton also featured on the track, Where I Come From, alongside veteran Jamaican singer Barrington Levy, on Khaled’s last album, Khaled Khaled."
