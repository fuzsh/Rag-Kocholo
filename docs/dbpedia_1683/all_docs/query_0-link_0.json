        "text": "American DJ and record producer (born 1975)\n\nNot to be confused with American producer DJ Khalil, Algerian musician Khaled (musician) or American R&B singer Khalid (singer).\n\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled ( ; Arabic: خالد محمد خالد; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio hype man, Khaled has become known for his extensive curation of high-profile music industry artists and producers to record singles or albums. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as \"organization, direction, [and] promotion\".[4][5]\n\nKhaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by single \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nHis fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nHis tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song \"Higher\" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.\n\nOutside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, while has also Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others.\n\nEarly life\n\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled was born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Palestinian parents who immigrated to the United States;[8] his father was from Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, and his mother from Ramallah.[9] His brother Alec Ledd (Alaa Khaled) is an actor.[10]\n\nHis musician parents played Arabic music; Khaled started developing an interest in rap and soul music at a young age, and his parents supported his interest. He worked in a local Merry-Go-Round record store which helped to lay the foundation for his music career.[11][12][13]\n\nCareer\n\nDuring his early career, Khaled became acquainted with several young artists and helped them before their breakthrough; these include Birdman, Lil Wayne, and Mavado. One of his first jobs was at the New Orleans record store Odyssey where he met both Birdman and Lil Wayne in 1993.[14] After leaving Odyssey, he began DJing in reggae sound clashes, mixing dancehall and hip-hop. His first radio gig was on a pirate station. In 1998, he moved to Miami and co-hosted The Luke Show on WEDR \"99 Jamz\" with 2 Live Crew's Luther Campbell. In 2003, he started hosting a weeknight radio show on 99 Jamz called The Takeover.[7][13][14]\n\nDuring his career, Khaled has used many monikers, including \"Arab Attack\", \"Big Dog Pitbull\", \"Terror Squadian\" (used during his time with the hip hop group Terror Squad), Beat Novacane (a moniker under which he produces beats), The Don Dada, Mr. Miami etc. Khaled has stated that he used the moniker \"Arab Attack\" for music as in saying \"attack with music\", but it was soon discontinued by him after the September 11 attacks, since he felt that using it would seem disrespectful and offensive towards those who suffered due to the attacks.[15][16][17]\n\n2006–2008: Listennn... the Album, We the Best, and We Global\n\nOn June 6, 2006, his debut album, Listennn... the Album, was released by Koch Records; it premiered on the US Billboard 200 chart at number 12.[18] We the Best (2007) is his second album, with singles \"I'm So Hood\" (with T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Plies, and Rick Ross) and \"We Takin' Over\" (with Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne). \"We Takin' Over\" peaked at number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the US Hot Rap Tracks chart and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 20, 2007.[19] Khaled made a guest appearance on Birdman's 2007 album 5 * Stunna on the single \"100 Million\", which also features Rick Ross, Dre, Young Jeezy and Lil Wayne. That year, Khaled won two Ozone Awards: one for Best Video (\"We Takin' Over\") and another for Best Radio DJ.[20]\n\nIn 2008, Khaled's third album We Global came out with singles \"Out Here Grindin\" (with Akon, Rick Ross, Lil' Boosie, Trick Daddy, Ace Hood, and Plies) followed by \"Go Hard\" (featuring Kanye West and T-Pain). RIAA certified the single \"I'm So Hood\" Platinum on June 4, 2008.[19] That year, Khaled won DJ of the Year awards from the BET Hip Hop Awards and Ozone Awards.[21][22] He was appointed the president of Def Jam South in February 2009.[23] That same month, 50 Cent released a video titled \"A Psychic Told Me\" in which he spoke of harming Khaled's mother and showed alleged footage of Khaled's mother's workplace and his mother herself. Following this, Khaled refused to comment, not wanting to give 50 Cent the publicity, simply stating: \"I'm not gonna let him bait me\".[24]\n\n2010–2012: Victory, We the Best Forever, and Kiss the Ring\n\nHis fourth studio album Victory was released on March 2, 2010. The album featured guest appearances from Drake, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Nelly, and more. The single \"All I Do Is Win\" featuring Ludacris, Rick Ross, Snoop Dogg, and T-Pain was certified as a double-platinum single. Other singles include: \"Put Your Hands Up\" featuring Ross, Young Jeezy, Plies, and Schife, and \"Fed Up\" featuring Usher, Drake, Ross, and Jeezy.

After attending a doctor due to a bald spot on his beard, Khaled was told that he was \"suffering from success\", which inspired the album's title.[36] The first single from the album, \"No New Friends\", features Drake, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross, and was produced by Canadian producers Boi-1da and Noah \"40\" Shebib.[37] On April 14, 2013, Khaled released a promotional video for Suffering for Success, and the music video for the aforementioned single.[38] The single was premiered the following day and released to iTunes of April 19, 2013.[39][40] \"No New Friends\" has since debuted at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100.

He supported his offer with a 10-karat diamond ring from Rafaello & Co., valued at about $500,000.[42] Later, he reaffirmed his proposal in an interview with Power 106's DJ Felli Fel, stating: \"I ain't a young boy no more. I'm on my thinking the future. I just had to be honest. I always liked her. She's my friend, of course. And I like her. It's more than a crush.\"[43] On July 29, 2013, in an interview with Funkmaster Flex, Minaj denied Khaled's proposal, saying: \"Khaled is my brother and Khaled was not serious with that damn proposal, ya'll. Please let it go. He was kidding.\"[44] The same day, Flex premiered Khaled's new single, \"I Wanna Be with You\", which featured Minaj, as well as frequent collaborators Future and Rick Ross. This lead some to believe that his proposal was a \"publicity stunt\" to promote his new single.[45][46]\n\nOn April 28, 2014, DJ Khaled announced in an interview with MTV that Jay-Z would be featured on his new single. The interview was noted due to Khaled \"cursing, gesturing, and tossing the microphone to the floor in an effort to convey the importance and impact of the music he has coming this summer.\"[47] A few hours after that, he released the single called \"They Don't Love You No More\", also featuring frequent collaborators Rick Ross, Meek Mill and French Montana. The song will be on his eight studio album, I Changed A Lot, which was released in 2015.[48][49] The following day, \"They Don't Love You No More\" was serviced to mainstream urban radio in the United States.[50]\n\nOn July 1, 2014, Khaled announced that he has partnered with Danish audio company Bang & Olufsen to launch his own brand of headphones, titled \"We the Best Sound\".[51] The brand is advertised in the video \"They Don't Love You No More.\" On August 8, 2014, Khaled released the official artwork for the second single from I Changed A Lot entitled \"Hold You Down\" which features Chris Brown, August Alsina, Future and Jeremih, and is produced by Bkorn, Lee on the Beats and LDB.

That’s always been the dynamic, since “I'm So Hood,” and the list goes on.”[80] On their relationship, Khaled states: “Ross is my brother,” he said. “That’s Day 1. That’s family. Me and him come from the bottom, the mud, to marble floors. When he’s shouting me out on that record, that’s what you call a real friend, family. [He] loves me and I love him back. Me and him are forever. Music or no music.

Ross was a proponent of his own Rap Snacks whereas Khaled endorsed Cinnamon Toast Crunch.[85]\n\nDrake\n\nThe relationship between Drake and Khaled has been described as “uniquely fruitful”.[80]\n\nLil Wayne\n\nLil Wayne has stated: “DJ Khaled is one of one… He’s produced so many memorable tracks. There’s no one like him.”[80]\n\nPublic figure\n\nJeff Ihaza of the Rolling Stone has described Khaled thus: “Khaled wears a pristinely lined haircut. His beard follows sharp angles that enforce a perfect symmetry along his face. When he’s trying to muster up the right word, either for clarity or comedic timing, his eyes carry a piercing seriousness, like an athlete laser-focused on a play.
