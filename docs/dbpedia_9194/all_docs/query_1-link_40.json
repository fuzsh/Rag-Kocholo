        "text": "Not really, only the first two or three rulers claimed rulership over the Vlachs.\n\nAt my knowledge, only one claimed in his titulature the empire over vallachians and bulgars, mainly because of the growing influence of romance population in the empire : Ioanista I.\n\nNow, both in chronicles, in cultural references and even in para-historic sciences, it's accepted to see \"vallachian\" influence, a strong one equal to the bulgarian and roman (byzantine) one.\n\nJust an exemple, the two paws in the coat-of-arms (reconstitued or sourced) of many Asnen are a reference to the valachs and bulgarian origin and base of its empire, even for the \"Emperors of Bulgarians and Greeks\". Besides, the parenty with bessarabian coat-of-arms is really interesting.\n\nFor the pontifical sources, the chancelleries of the era are about a \"Kingdom of Bulgarians and Valachians\" (Bulgarorum et Blachorum)\n\nAnd it's not entirely clear what exactly was meant under Vlachs in this period; according to an alternative theory this was the name for Bulgarians in Moesia, in contrast to those in Macedonia.\n\nThis alternate theory is so littely supported that i'think it will disappear with its supporter's death.\n\nNow, if you're saying here that Bulgars of Mesia have been called Vallachs too during a short period, why not. Personally i doubt it as the sources are not that precise about it, and critically because this use of walh could be more about the farmers of Moesia (as in Bulgar, valach is a name for both romance people and goat-keepers) a romanized population that slowly dissolved itself within the turco-slavic higher classes (by the way the presence of it would probably helped to maintain a cultural continuation between bulgarians and moldo-valach that climaxed with the Second Bulgarian State).\n\nIt didn't avoid the fact that the walha of Dacia and Danube are named so by all their neighboors (after a contact with the germans expeditions) in earlier sources than XIII, mainly greeks-romanians and Hungrians.\n\nAnd the racin walh is clearly identied with romance-speaker peoples (or at least, peoples with a strong romance legacy as the welsh)\n\nAlso it seems likely, judging by their names, that the first dynasty (there were three major and a few minor ones) in the Second Bulgarian Empire was of Cuman origin.\n\nMaybe, but i think we can agree on this word : acculturation. It's how things always worked in the Balkan peninsula. And when other chronicles quote the Asen where Valachs, i don't see why it would be uncompatible.\n\nIn any case, any Vlach influence was probably minor and for most of the period they didn't control territories north of the Danube.\n\nThe capitals, except the latter was in regions inhabited by a very likely majoritary romance population, except for the latter (that would explain many things, see below).\n\nBasically, we could say that if the first part of SBS' history was undoutbly of both valach and bulgarian origin and basment (sources, both chronicles, or archeologies or even para-historic are clear on it), with the deplacment of the country towards South (where were its interests) concretized in other things by a capital in bulgarian lands, made of Vallachias a region of lesser importance.\n\nAt this moment, as the Cuman pressure was no more (and anyway more translated into a vallachisation of Cumans more than anything) the moldo-vallachs used this to gain more and more autonomy from the bulgarian Empire until its final disapperence.\n\nBut this is not at all contradictory with the important influence of romance culture and people in the formation of Bulgarian nation. For political and nationalist reason, it's often occulted in bulgarian and romanian historiographies but outside, it's common and recognized knowledge.\n\n-\n\nNow, for turning back into the subject of an AH, the \"royal way\" to have a surving bulgaro-valach state in the Balkans, is to lower the efforts and investment in southern business, and to make the tsars ready and able to fight Hungary and to expand their territories north, until the Prout.\n\nA good thing would be to butterfly the 1204 prise of Constantinople, or at the contrary to make the Bulgarian defeated by the Latins at the battle of Adrianople.\n\nA strong empire, Byzantine or Latin, in the southern Balkans would likely force the Asnen to search a benefit elsewhere.\n\nAt my knowledge, only one claimed in his titulature the empire over vallachians and bulgars, mainly because of the growing influence of romance population in the empire : Ioanista I.\n\nActually, it was the first three rulers who claimed that title.\n\nNow, both in chronicles, in cultural references and even in para-historic sciences, it's accepted to see \"vallachian\" influence, a strong one equal to the bulgarian and roman (byzantine) one.\n\nNot really, in fact many later chronicles omit this altogether.\n\nJust an exemple, the two paws in the coat-of-arms (reconstitued or sourced) of many Asnen are a reference to the valachs and bulgarian origin and base of its empire, even for the \"Emperors of Bulgarians and Greeks\".

There is not much evidence of a large surviving (from Roman times) Romance speaking population in today's Bulgaria.\n\nMaybe, but i think we can agree on this word : acculturation. It's how things always worked in the Balkan peninsula. And when other chronicles quote the Asen where Valachs, i don't see why it would be uncompatible.\n\nWell, the fact that they abandoned the Vlach claim rather quickly seeks to speak against it.\n\nThe capitals, except the latter was in regions inhabited by a very likely majoritary romance population, except for the latter (that would explain many things, see below).\n\nBasically, we could say that if the first part of SBS' history was undoutbly of both valach and bulgarian origin and basment (sources, both chronicles, or archeologies or even para-historic are clear on it), with the deplacment of the country towards South (where were its interests) concretized in other things by a capital in bulgarian lands, made of Vallachias a region of lesser importance.\n\nThe capital was always in Tarnovo, so I don't really understand what you mean here.\n\nBut this is not at all contradictory with the important influence of romance culture and people in the formation of Bulgarian nation. For political and nationalist reason, it's often occulted in bulgarian and romanian historiographies but outside, it's common and recognized knowledge.\n\nThe influence of the Romance culture and people on the Bulgarian nation is substantially less than of the Bulgarian culture and people on the Romanian nation. Compare the number of loanwords or toponyms, for example.\n\n-\n\nNow, for turning back into the subject of an AH, the \"royal way\" to have a surving bulgaro-valach state in the Balkans, is to lower the efforts and investment in southern business, and to make the tsars ready and able to fight Hungary and to expand their territories north, until the Prout.\n\nA good thing would be to butterfly the 1204 prise of Constantinople, or at the contrary to make the Bulgarian defeated by the Latins at the battle of Adrianople.\n\nA strong empire, Byzantine or Latin, in the southern Balkans would likely force the Asnen to search a benefit elsewhere.\n\nYes, but the Mongols would soon put an end to any such efforts, as happened in OTL (and with that remove any chance of forming a real Bulgarian-Vlach state. In any case, the south was more valuable than any potential northern expansion.\n\nActually, it was the first three rulers who claimed that title.\n\nNot really, in fact many later chronicles omit this altogether.\n\nYou said it, later chronicles. At this time, it's true, the SBS's valach influence have indeed been lowered by the autonomy (or quasi-independence) of its territories and nobles.\n\nAnd the bulgar and byzantine base was highlited, explaining the many omissions.\n\nBut historiography isn't History. Valach were a base of the state's creation, almost always quoted in contemporaries source.\n\nI don't see how this has anything to do with this.\n\nYou're confusing Bessarabia's coa and bessarabian's style of coa.\n\nFor an analog exemple : The modern coa of Montpellier have little to do with Aragon, but the historical one is very similar.\n\nYes, and that disappeared after the third ruler of the Empire.\n\nAnd, how it's prooving that the valach population wasn't a base of the creation of the SBS? The Asen dynasty claimed to be king of a romance people, and if the titulature changed after some time, it didn't proove the contrary.\n\nBy exemple, is the use of \"King of Hispania\" or \"King of Oriental Realm\" make the King of Visigoths no longer of german's legacy ?\n\nFurthermore the use of Balachorum continued in foreign chancelleries after the abandon of the titulature. It was not really for giggles.\n\nWhat is this supposed to mean?\n\nThat this theory is not supported by sources, but more about personal tendencies as all the ethymological fantaisies (XIX in the western world, XX and current eastern Europe) as the non-scandinavian Rus or the ligurian London.\n\nSo, when the fever would be down, i suppose that these theories would join the others in Oblivion. Now when i said \"in the same time of their authors\", i'm probably optimistic as the nationalistic historiography would continue to be promoted as the economical and political crisis wouldn't let the pudding cool.\n\nVlach does not mean goat keeper in Bulgarian. There is not much evidence of a large surviving (from Roman times) Romance speaking population in today's Bulgaria.\n\nVlach means shepherd in both Bulgarian and Macedonian. ANd where i said that is still a large romance population in today's Bulgaria? I said, you can check, that the use of vlach for call the shepherd would likely means that the romance population refugeed itself in the highlands (Rodhope, Balkans, etc) before being acculturated into a byzantino-bulgarian population.\n\nWell, the fact that they abandoned the Vlach claim rather quickly seeks to speak against it.\n\nRather quickly? 75 years is not really quick, you'll agree. Besides, it's a natural evolution for a kingdom to adopt a morre \"geographical\" name when the state is stabilized. Middle-Ages is full of exemples : Kingdom of the Franks and Aquitains -> Kingdom of France, Kingdom of the Lombards-> Kingdom of Italy, etc.\n\nThe capital was always in Tarnovo, so I don't really understand what you mean here.\n\nThe influence of the Romance culture and people on the Bulgarian nation is substantially less than of the Bulgarian culture and people on the Romanian nation. Compare the number of loanwords or toponyms, for example.\n\nAgain, you're confusing two things.\n\nYou could as well say that romance culture is less influencing Germany than France. But nobody would say seriously that Germany is romance culture-free.\n\nFor Bulgaria, it's quite similar, Romance influence is more about institutions and cadres than linguistic. But even here, some influence could maybe be discerned (i'm not at all specialized into balkanic linguistic so i can make errors) as the postposed article.\n\nFinally, the whole Bulgare culture as it exist today (not the old-bulgarian, nor the Simeon-era Bulgaria that didn't have a defined bulgarian culture) is the result of a fusion and acculturation of different cultures into a slavo-thracian base. Why the romance influence isn't more present while it was at the creation of this state? More probably because of strategic and political choices that axed Bulgaria's in the south.\n\nBut, how Bulgarian culture turned todays, is not at all uncompatible with the fact that Asen's Bulgaria was a valacho-bulgarian state and no a bulgarian state with a valach population.\n\nYes, but the Mongols would soon put an end to any such efforts, as happened in OTL (and with that remove any chance of forming a real Bulgarian-Vlach state. In any case, the south was more valuable than any potential northern expansion.\n\nI agree that a southern expansion would be more valuable. But with the presence of a strong state that would block the Egean sea and put a border on Balkan or Rodop, an ambitious ruler would have little choice but expand his power in the North, far from the power of Constantinople.\n\nYou said it, later chronicles.

Valach were a base of the state's creation, almost always quoted in contemporaries source.\n\nOf course that's if you accept the ethnic theory for the term Vlach.

The Asen dynasty claimed to be king of a romance people, and if the titulature changed after some time, it didn't proove the contrary.\n\nAs far as I know, the Asen dynasty claimed to be descended from the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire.\n\nAnd the fact that the title was abandoned, does suggest that the Vlachs were no longer considered an important part of the country. Which could mean that the kingdom no longer controlled any territories with significant Vlach population (though this was as its height, so it seems unlikely) or that the Vlachs were no longer distinguished from the Bulgarians.\n\nIncidentally, domestically the rulers of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom often omitted the Vlach part of their titles.\n\nThat this theory is not supported by sources, but more about personal tendencies as all the ethymological fantaisies (XIX in the western world, XX and current eastern Europe) as the non-scandinavian Rus or the ligurian London.\n\nSo, when the fever would be down, i suppose that these theories would join the others in Oblivion.

I said, you can check, that the use of vlach for call the shepherd would likely means that the romance population refugeed itself in the highlands (Rodhope, Balkans, etc) before being acculturated into a byzantino-bulgarian population.\n\nPlease don't lecture me on my own language. In Bulgarian Vlach means means a Balkan romance speaker, including Romanian in older usage.\n\nRather quickly? 75 years is not really quick, you'll agree. Besides, it's a natural evolution for a kingdom to adopt a morre \"geographical\" name when the state is stabilized. Middle-Ages is full of exemples : Kingdom of the Franks and Aquitains -> Kingdom of France, Kingdom of the Lombards-> Kingdom of Italy, etc.\n\nActually, about 20 years. This usage started to disappear after Tsar Kaloyan.\n\nAgain, you're confusing two things.\n\nYou could as well say that romance culture is less influencing Germany than France. But nobody would say seriously that Germany is romance culture-free.\n\nI didn't say that, I was comparing the relative effect.\n\nFor Bulgaria, it's quite similar, Romance influence is more about institutions and cadres than linguistic. But even here, some influence could maybe be discerned (i'm not at all specialized into balkanic linguistic so i can make errors) as the postposed article.\n\nThe postposed article also appears in Albanian and its origin is not well established. It could just as well have come from Thracian or even from Bulgarian.\n\nAnd I don't see what you mean by cadres and institutions.\n\nFinally, the whole Bulgare culture as it exist today (not the old-bulgarian, nor the Simeon-era Bulgaria that didn't have a defined bulgarian culture) is the result of a fusion and acculturation of different cultures into a slavo-thracian base. Why the romance influence isn't more present while it was at the creation of this state? More probably because of strategic and political choices that axed Bulgaria's in the south.\n\nBut, how Bulgarian culture turned todays, is not at all uncompatible with the fact that Asen's Bulgaria was a valacho-bulgarian state and no a bulgarian state with a valach population.\n\nIt's not incompatible, though it's not necessary to explain contemporary Bulgarian culture and it's not especially likely.\n\nI agree that a southern expansion would be more valuable. But with the presence of a strong state that would block the Egean sea and put a border on Balkan or Rodop, an ambitious ruler would have little choice but expand his power in the North, far from the power of Constantinople.\n\nThat was the situation in the second half of the 13th century, but no expansion was possible with the much stronger Mongols. In fact, the Kingdom had probably more influence north of the Danube during the height of its power.\n\nOf course that's if you accept the ethnic theory for the term Vlach. Which becomes a lot more doubtful when you consider that contemporary Byzantine sources confuse Bulgarians, Moesians and Vlachs and that their Wallachia was apparently the same as Moesia.\n\nThe theory of vlaha as \"romance people\" is virtually undisputed. Too many occurences from one point to Europe to another. You can say that the sense evolved from this racine, defining rural communauties because romance peoples were the archetyp of these; not that use is contradictory and critically more ancient than the ethnic usage.\n\nI repeat it, you can find \"Wallachias\" from the Antiquity (Volcos) to modern utilisations (Wales). Interestingly the use of the word as shepherd is mainly slavic (with the noted exception of Greek), and could show a dominance over a population.\n\nIn fact, i ask myself if the use in greek of valha for rural groups didn't came from slavic. It is true that slaves influenced the byzantine greek and that would explain a lot (both this use, and a \"corruption\" to deign non-romance people with), but as i said before i'm not linguist.\n\nWhat exactly is a Bessarabian style coat of arms?\n\nThere is no a \"bessarabian style\", i meant common references used. Choice of colors, of figures and of aspects.\n\nAs far as I know, the Asen dynasty claimed to be descended from the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire.\n\nAnd Medieval French Kings claimed to be Troyans. It's a little more prestigious to say \"I'm the heir of the former bulgarian Empire. So i've legitimacy to rule the Bulgarians, which i wouldn't have so easily if i was the desdendent of a romanized turk, that i am not at all.\"\n\nAnd the fact that the title was abandoned, does suggest that the Vlachs were no longer considered an important part of the country. Which could mean that the kingdom no longer controlled any territories with significant Vlach population (though this was as its height, so it seems unlikely) or that the Vlachs were no longer distinguished from the Bulgarians.\n\n1) I agree with you, as i said before, that the interests of the SBS allowed the Valachs to have more autonomy in the same time \"romans\" took a more important place within the society. It's not they didn't recognized the Turnovo's rule, but all the territories north of Danube lived their own, while the southern Wallachia were slowly absorbed. They were still dinstinguished tough, but something like \"ours\" vallachian, opposed to \"them\", less orthodoxized with less byzantine influence.\n\nIncidentally, domestically the rulers of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom often omitted the Vlach part of their titles.\n\nAs i said, it couldn't be in itself a proof of the disapprence of romance influence. It could be (attention, no affirmation here, just to point that others explanation are possible) 1)The affirmation of a power on a territory, not on a particular people 2)The fact bulgarian could mean slavic and romance, or something else.\n\nAs I pointed out above, one can't entirely dismiss this theory as nationalistic\n\nIt's a theory that is not supported by many people outside slavic Balkans, that didn't care about the ethymological, historical and archeological proofs on what you call \"ethnic\" theory and critically allow the historiography to claim a continuous presence of a bulgarian ethny that would have be the center of acculturation and not a part (even important) of a melting-pot.\n\nSo, it's maybe not a nationalistic theory, but as Granny said \"If it have the taste of, the smell of, then be careful because it have some odds to be one\".\n\nPlease don't lecture me on my own language. In Bulgarian Vlach means means a Balkan romance speaker, including Romanian in older usage.\n\nSo, why these many occurences of Vlaha as shepherd, particularly for countries where romance population indeed were formed by sheperding communities?\n\nActually, about 20 years. This usage started to disappear after Tsar Kaloyan.\n\nAdmitting that the title wasn't taken for giggles, and that it is admitted that Asen came from today's Romania (wallachian or romanized cumans), we could say that until the abandon of the title, the emperors were bulgaro-vallachian rulers.\n\nIn fact, you could even advance that taking the title of \"Kings of Vallachs\" could be a sign that this power began to vanish a little, and a recall was necessary to fortify it, but i'm the devil's advocate here.\n\nI didn't say that, I was comparing the relative effect.\n\nOkay, today's Bulgaria is less influenced by romance culture. But i don't see how it point something about the Asen dynasty and the cultures in the SBS?\n\nThe postposed article also appears in Albanian and its origin is not well established. It could just as well have come from Thracian or even from Bulgarian.\n\nAnd I don't see what you mean by cadres and institutions.\n\nWell, indeed we could have here a Thracian racine, but Bulgarian? Or the old-Bulgarian or the medieval slavic were related to thracian, so i can't see how it could have been come from.\n\nIt's not incompatible, though it's not necessary to explain contemporary Bulgarian culture and it's not especially likely.\n\nWow, i don't search to explain today's Bulgaria, i just point that what Bulgaria was (and so what it is today eventually) during this period more tied with romance people and influence that stated."
