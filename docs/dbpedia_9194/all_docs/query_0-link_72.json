        "text": "The Influence of Roman Law on Mediaeval Bulgarian Constitutionalism (Abstract) This work traces the impact of Roman law on institutions, statutes and legal proceedings during the First (680–1018) and the Second Bulgarian Tsardom (1185–1396). Mediaeval Bulgaria was characterized by legal dualism, a combination between customs and written laws which were greatly indebted to Byzantine jurisprudence. The influence of the latter increased tremendously after the pagan state adopted Christianity from Constantinople in 864. The Byzantine statutes which were translated and enforced in Bulgaria elaborated on the text of Corpus Iuris Civilis. The legislation in the First and the Second Bulgarian Empire heavily borrowed from the Roman archetypes but, as I demonstrate, it often did not follow them verbatim. It was common for Bulgarian jurists to omit passages, add, alter or completely modify the original texts. These changes were required by the specifics of the economy, social relations and traditions in Bulgaria. In the first part of the paper I explain how the Byzantine Ecloga and Farmer’s Law shaped the Slavic Ecloga and Zakon Sudnyi Liudem. I examine the connections between the Nomocanon and Kormchaia Kniga. As I indicate in the second part, dedicated to governance and institutions, the contradictory nature of the Roman law makes the assessment of its impact a challenging task. The position of the Bulgarian ruler towards the Church was even stronger than that of the Byzantine Emperor. The Council of the Great Bolyars (Boyars) was often instrumental in the selection, legitimation and even deposition of the Tsar (Khan, Knyaz). The third part explores the projections of Byzantine jurisprudence on the criminal law in Bulgaria. I juxtapose and analyze the vast catalogues of offences and punishments in the two countries. The mediaeval Bulgarian law distinguished between several main types of crimes against: state and faith, bodily integrity, honour and personal freedom, morality and property. I highlight the modus operandi of courts of law and the chief types of punishment – secular and spiritual. Key words: Mediaeval Bulgarian constitutionalism, Roman law, Corpus Iuris Civilis, Nomocanon, Slavic Ecloga, Kormchaia Kniga (Кормчая книга), Zakon Sudnyi Liudem (Законъ соудьный людьмъ)\n\nThe Galician-Volhynian prince Roman Mstislavich became the main military ally of the Byzantine Empire in the early 13th century. The circumstances and the time of Roman’s campaign in Niketas Choniates’ account are the same as in the Russian chronicles reporting the steppe campaigns of the prince. All the Byzantine sources name Roman Mstislavich the “igemon of Galicia”. The term igemon, unlike other Byzantine titles of Rusian princes, meant the Emperor’s ally and relative (or in-law). The alliance between Alexios III and Roman led also to more stable relations with the Rusian population of the Lower Dniester and the Lower Danube. The military aid that Roman rendered to Alexios III was guaranteed by Roman’s marriage to the niece of Alexios III, the elder daughter of the overthrown emperor Isaak II."
