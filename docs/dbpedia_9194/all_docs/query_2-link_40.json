        "text": "Experience the splendor of Bulgarian architecture and enjoy a journey into the past. Bulgaria’s remarkable structures have stood for centuries, from awe-inspiring fortresses to peaceful monasteries, seeing empires rise and fall around them.\n\nWith its stunning landscapes, wandering rivers, and ancient monuments and fortifications, it is easy to be enchanted by its beauty as you explore this incredible country. Read on as we explore the great strongholds that will surely ignite your inner explorer!\n\nPlovdiv, the oldest continually inhabited city in Europe\n\nPlovdiv\n\nWith over 6,000 years of history and being the European Capital of Culture in 2019, Plovdiv is a must-see destination in Bulgaria. The city boasts an incredible architectural heritage from the many cultures that have left their mark: this land has been home to Thracians, Macedonians, Romans, Ottomans, and Bulgarians – all throughout history.\n\nNestled on the banks of the Maritsa River and between the Rodopi Mountains and the Balkans, the picturesque “City of the Six Hills” authentically blends nature, history, art, and stunning architecture.\n\nWhile in Plovdiv, you must explore its rich history by visiting the almost 2000-year-old Ancient Theatre, the stunning Roman Stadium and Roman Basilica, and the Ancient Philippopolis, where you will see ruins of the ancient city’s Roman forum.\n\nStroll along the pretty cobblestone streets of the Old Town, where Roman remnants blend with traditional homes, all adorned in bright colors. Take a deep breath and let time slow down as you soak in the charm of this city.\n\nYou will learn about Plovdiv’s culture and traditions at the Ethnographic Museum. At the same time, St. Konstantin and Elena Church is a beautiful example of 19th-century Bulgarian architecture. Of course, no visit to Plovdiv would be complete without exploring the trendy Kapana district.\n\nHere, you will find some of the city’s most vibrant bars, cafes, and shops. Enjoy alfresco dining in the many outdoor restaurants, or shop for handmade souvenirs at one of the craft stores. You’ll get to know a different face of the city: dynamic, creative, and innovative.\n\nPlovdiv is conveniently located just 150km east of Sofia, an easy 2-hour drive by car.\n\nAs expected, the former Capital of Culture offers you unique places to stay, from 5 stars hotels to fancy hostels, so it all depends on your budget. We recommend trying Hotel Evmolpia, a perfect combination of local architecture, a good location, and excellent services. For a more luxurious 5 stars experience, definitely check out Gallery 37, BW Premier Collection. The interior design includes masterpieces created by Bulgarian artists. Overall it is an experience that will please all your senses.\n\nSee the historical and sacred Bachkovo Monastery\n\nBachkovo Monastery\n\nAnd if you’re visiting Plovidv, you must also see Bachkovo Monastery. It is located just 35 minutes drive away from the city. Nestled in the foothills of the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria, this architectural gem has stood the test of time, making it one of the oldest Eastern Orthodox monasteries in Europe. Stepping inside its walls is like returning to a long-gone era of elegant architecture and peaceful contemplation.\n\nThe monastery’s colorful frescoes, some dating back to the 1300s, and elaborate carvings are a testament to the impressive craftsmanship of the medieval period. As you wander through the courtyard and its chambers, you’ll feel a sense of serenity surrounding you. If you’re looking for a peaceful escape, then Bachkovo Monastery is a perfect place to visit.\n\nEscape the ordinary and explore Asenovgrad\n\nWelcome to Asenovgrad, a wonderful small town near Bulgaria’s Rhodope Mountains. If you’re looking for a European adventure that’s off the beaten path, this is the place for you. As soon as you arrive, you’ll be greeted with warm hospitality and a feeling of tranquility that will rejuvenate your soul.\n\nExplore the cobblestone streets, admire the ancient architecture, and indulge in the local cuisine. You won’t regret taking the time to discover this hidden gem, Asenovgrad.\n\nAsen’s Fortress, Asenovgrad\n\nAsen’s Fortress is an absolute must-see in Asenovgrad, so include it on your list. You’ll have to exit the city and see the Fortress built on top of a cliff on the left side of the Asenitsa River. Here you will find one of the oldest churches in all Eastern Orthodoxy. You’ll admire its tall tower, once used also as a watchtower.\n\nLocated just 30 km from Plovdiv, Asneovgrad is a destination worth adding to your list when visiting the city. Elevate your travel experience, and explore the charm of this nearby place! Being so close to Plovdiv, it’s an excellent choice to visit this town while staying in a hotel in Plovdiv.\n\nTake a spiritual journey to the Arapovo Monastery\n\nArapovo Monastery\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of Asenovgrad, you will find the Arapovo Monastery, a charming place to visit. Interestingly, this monastery was the only one built during the Ottoman domination.\n\nWalk around the impressive building, admire the wall paintings inside, and let your soul be surrounded by peace in this serene place. Legends say there is a holy spring with healing powers nearby. You’ll find it near the north gate of the monastery.\n\nExplore the Historical Sites of Vidin\n\nBaba Vida Fortress, Vidin\n\nNested northwest of the country on the southern Danube shores, Vidin is a city neighboring Romania and Serbia. It’s renowned for its rich cultural heritage and has existed for two millennia. When in town, visiting the Baba Vida Fortress is a must! Regarded as one of Europe’s best-preserved medieval fortresses, it’s a fascinating testament to a turbulent past.\n\nDating back to the 10th century, Baba Vida has loyally endured conflict and conquest in this tumultuous region. Yet, despite that, its structures remain incredibly well-preserved. As you cross the drawbridge on foot, you can almost hear the trampling of hooves, echoing with the footsteps of warriors long since passed.\n\nAt Baba Vida, the rich history of an ancient era is brought vividly to life before our eyes. And it’s not difficult as it stands proudly today before our eyes, almost in the same form as in those past times.\n\nOther attractions include the Cathedral of St. Demetrius, one of the biggest and most beautiful Bulgarian Orthodox Cathedrals, St. Panteleimon Church, the ruins of the Vidin Synagogue, the Memorial of Victims in Serbo-Bulgarian War, and many more.\n\nWhile there, you can’t miss the opportunity to stroll down the Danube’s picturesque promenade. Dine in one of the many boat restaurants while admiring the river’s vast expanse and islands, including the stunning New Europe Bridge, linking Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nThe drive from Sofia to Vidin takes around 3.5 hours.\n\nVisit Belogradchik Fortress – Bulgaria’s best-kept Secret\n\nIf you think Bulgaria can’t impress you with its natural, architectural, or historical wonders, then you’re wrong! And the Belogradchik fortress is living proof of the above statement, combining all three aspects. Hard to believe? The construction of Kaleto, as it’s called, it’s one of the most unique and beautiful gems that you can discover in the Vidin area and the entire country!\n\nBelogradchik Fortress\n\nTo arrive at the Belogradchik Fortress, you must do a short 1-hour drive from Vidin, so you can easily combine visiting the two in a 2 days trip. Once you get there, you just can’t miss it.\n\nIt’s said that Romans built it in the most inaccessible place in the area, on the slopes of the Balkan mountains. It was used as a stronghold and has been through many wars and foreign occupations before you can peacefully walk through its impressive gates today.\n\nOver the centuries, used by Romans to protect goods and gold transported from Thracian lands, occupied by the Ottoman Empire, and ruled by a Hungarian King, it was considered the second in importance after the Baba Vida fortress in Vidin.\n\nAs one can expect, being a key element during so many armed conflicts, it was destroyed and rebuilt until its current form. The last time the Fortress was used for a military purpose was in 1885 in the Serbian-Bulgarian war.\n\nThis is actually one of the most beautiful places in Bulgaria, where the natural “Fortress” of the Belogradchik Rocks combines just perfectly with the man-made Fortress built for defense and strategic military actions. The strange, almost vertical, reddish formations are entirely natural. They are situated on nearly 50sqm surface and measure from 250 to 650 meters in height.\n\nAnd for all of you nature lovers out there, we have a pleasant surprise. While in the area, you can combine visiting the stunning Belogradchik Fortress with the Magoura Cave! This is a fantastic place, boasting paintings dating from the Bronze Age, around 10.000 years old. It’s on the tentative list to be included in the UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES since 1984.\n\nYou’ll be in awe admiring the cave’s unique rock formations and the early humanity creations, depicting hunting scenes, rituals, and even a solar calendar.
