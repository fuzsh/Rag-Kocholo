        "text": "This article examines the question about the policy of honouring members of the Bulgarian imperial family and Bulgarian aristocracy with Byzantine honorific titles pursued by Emperor Basil II Boulgaroktonos (976–1025) in the course of the conquest of Bulgaria. It outlines the scale of this policy of Basil II – its goals and the reasons for adopting it. A review of the place and the importance of the particular titles in the rank hierarchy of Byzantium is presented. The comparison with other regions and cases of conferring Byzantine honorific titles clearly shows how crucially important the conquest of Bulgaria was: it is evident from the concessions the Emperor was ready to make to the Bulgarian ruling elite.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 10 c. the first Slavic collection of homilies of John Chrysostom was compiled. It was called Zlatostruy, which means Chrysorrhoas or Golden Stream. In previous studies the Zlatostruy was noted mostly for its Preface, whereby the Bulgarian Tsar Symeon (893-927) is named initiator of the gathering the initial Corpus Chrysostomicum and author of its name. The importance of the Zlatostruy collection is supported not only by the Preface, which may be considered of more or less ideological value. It is substantiated by means of a comprehensive text-critical and comparative analysis that endeavors to reconstruct the history of the collection and reveal further detail about the textual history of the homilies from the Byzantine originals to the later Slavic copies. In this paper I shift the focus to those features that are related to the flourishing of the 10 c. Bulgarian literary tradition and the successful adoption of Byzantine literary models.\n\nThe paper compares the content and the structure of the three extant South Slavonic Synodika: Boril’s Synodikon as preserved in the so-called Palauzov copy of the 14th century (НБКМ № 289); Drinov’s Synodikon (НБКМ № 432), previously considered to be a 16th century copy of Boril’s Synodikon, and the recently published South Slavonic Synodikon from the 16th century, kept in the library of the Romanian Academy of Sciences (BAR MS. SL. 307). The comparison is supported by a table showing the rubrics and their order in the three Synodika. It demonstrates that while Boril’s Synodikon is based on a translation of Comnenian version of the Synodikon of Orthodoxy, and while the South Slavonic Synodikon from Romania must be unequivocally attributed to the later Palaeologan version of the Greek text, the so-called Drinov copy represents a compilation of Boril’s Synodikon in its 14th version and the Palaeologan Synodikon. In fact, Drinov’s Synodikon contains all of the important interpolations and insertions of Boril’s Synodikon related to specifically Bulgarian circumstances and history, ranging from anti-Bogomilist anathemas to a list of Bulgarian rulers (comprising two historical accounts as well). Its initial part, however, follows the Palaelogan text preserved in BAR MS. SL. The unknown compiler obviously targeted a Bulgarian audience; in all likelihood, he was Bulgarian himself. Some textological features common to both Drinov’s and Palaelogan Synodikon suggest that the translated part of Drinov’s Synodikon and the Romanian Synodikon must have had a common antigraph. The latter fact allows us to conclude that the translation of the Palaeologan version of the Synodikon of Orthodoxy is an integral part of the tradition of the Bulgarian Synodikon; the presumed common antigraph was written in Bulgarian Tărnovo orthography, traces of which are found in Drinov’s text. As to the location of this translation, we can only speculate that it might have been completed in a monastic centre different than Tărnovo by the end of the 14th century. Keywords: Synodikon of Orthodoxy, Palaeologan and Comnenian versions of the Synodikon, Bulgarian translations and versions of the Synodikon.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire was the eastern portion of the greater Roman Empire which survived the fall of the western portion by nearly one-thousand years. Part of the reason for its survival was the fact that it was a centralised bureaucratic state initially characterised by a marked separation between the civil and military administrations. Later, during the sixth and early seventh centuries, especially in the empire's provincial administration, the distinction between the civil and military administration would begin to blur and in parts of the Empire to disappear altogether. These changes that occurred in the administration of the Empire were the result of external pressures that would force the emperor, and other officials of the empire, to adapt and change the structure of the state in order to survive. Herein the author will look at: The administrative structure of this empire, the changes said structure experienced over a three-hundred year period and with an emphasis on the impact of the broader historical setting on the Byzantine Empire's administrative and bureaucratic political structures. The focus of this work is threefold. First, it will serve as an introductory survey of the administrative history of the Byzantine Empire during a three hundred-year period. Second, it will illustrate the administrative structure of the Byzantine State. Third and finally it will offer a look at the changes in the administration during the period from the fourth century to the seventh century."
