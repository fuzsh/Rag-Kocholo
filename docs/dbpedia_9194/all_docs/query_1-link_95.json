        "text": "The article surveys in a comparative perspective the presence of the Cuman-Qïpchaqs in Crimea and the Balkans. The available historical and archaeological material is examined in the theoretical framework of the concept for the contacts between the nomads and the outside world. On the basis of general typology of the contact zones between the Cuman-Qïpchaqs and the surrounding sedentary societies the specific place of Crimea and the Balkans is emphasized. The initial appearance of the Cuman-Qïpchaqs on both peninsulas is traced and the profile of their further behavior is chronologically examined. The parallel analysis demonstrates that in Crimea the nomads were interested in commercial activities and even imposed their political supremacy over a significant part of the settlements along Crimean littoral, while on the Balkans they remained mainly interested in raiding. The higher priority of Crimea for the Cuman-Qïpchaqs is highlighted and juxtaposed to the priorities of the Byzantine Empire, for which the Balkan hinterland of its capital remained of primary importance.\n\nThis paper offers an English translation and a broad commentary of a chapter from the second defter (volume) of Kemālpaşazāde’s Tevāriḫ-i āl-i ʿOs̱mān (Histories of the House of Osman) relating a legendary history of medieval Bulgaria. It is argued that the main source that the Ottoman historian has utilized in composing this part of his Tevāriḫ was an unknown version of the so called Bulgarian Apocryphal Chronicle belonging to a cycle of eleventh-twelfth-century historical-apocalyptic works. An attempt is made to provide a partial reconstruction of this source by means of collating the Ottoman text with the only extant copy of the Apocryphal Chronicle titled Tale of the Prophet Isaiah of How He Was Taken up to the Seventh Heaven by an Angel as well as by taking into consideration other related works of medieval Bulgarian literature. Kemālpaşazāde’s interventions and additions to the narrative of his main source on Bulgarian history are highlighted and, where possible, explained in the light of his historiographic approach and the broader context of his Tevāriḫ. Special attention is paid to the manner in which the Ottoman historian has neatly complemented the information extracted from the Apocryphal Chronicle in order to link it to the main narrative line of the defter, relating the beginnings of Ottoman conquest in the Balkans. Finally, some observations and assumptions as to the place and the process of creation of the text under consideration are proposed, suggesting that Kemālpaşazāde became acquainted with an Ottoman Turkish translation of the Apocryphal Chronicle during his professorship at the Isḥāk Paşa Medrese in Üsküp (present-day Skopje). Another forthcoming paper is dealing with the cultural and intellectual background of the emergence of this peculiar text with a focus on the possible venues of interaction between the various strands of historiographic production in 15th and early-16th-century Ottoman Europe."
