        "text": "VIDIN is a Danube town that has many sites to be proud of. Located in the North-Western Bulgaria, on the border with Romania, it is often left under the radar for many travellers. Baba Vida is the most famous attraction in the city. However, if you decide to visit Vidin, you will be pleasantly surprised by all the other things you can see there.\n\nVidin is located 245 km from Sofia, well connected with regular buses and trains. It has a bridge connection with Romania and is a stop to many Danube cruises.\n\nBaba Vida Fortress\n\nThe symbol of the city is “Baba Vida” – the only fully preserved Medieval Fortress in Bulgaria. It is built on top of a Roman fortress during the Xth century. It has never been conquered by an enemy army. Baba Vida rises proudly next to Danube river and is often a first stop for the visitors of the town…\n\nIt was used for military purposes during the First and Second Bulgarian Kingdoms, the Ottoman Empire and all the way to 1958. Now, it is a famous tourist attraction and а movie scene. More than 50 movies were filmed in Baba Vida. There is a summer stage inside the walls where regular folklore events are organized.\n\nThe Fortress is indeed very well preserved. You can walk inside, visit one of the eight towers, the jail or just enjoy the view to Danube and Romania. “Baba Vida” has a square shape, and the 4 of its corners are oriented to the world cardinal points. The Fortress is surrounded by a 6m deep ditch which was filled with water.\n\nAn interesting legend is hidden behind the walls of the Fortress…\n\nBaba Vida was the oldest of three sisters who were unhappily married. She decided to give a vow to never get married and build the Fortress to spend the rest of her days inside. But, as faith often plays with us, Vida fell in love with the architect. Because of her vow, however, she ordered his death after the Fortress was built.\n\nBut let’s stick to the facts…\n\nBaba Vida Working Hours:\n\nOct 1 – Mar 30: 9:00-17:00 (Mon-Fri); 10:00-17:00 (Sat, Sun)\n\nApr 1 – Sept 30: 8:30-17:30 (Mon-Fri); 9:00-17:30 (Sat,Sun)\n\nTickets price: 4 BGN (Adults); 2 BGN (Students, Retirees); 20 BGN – Tour Guide /Last update: October 2016/\n\nThe Old Synagogue\n\nAbandoned, but still caught our attention! The Synagogue in Vidin is an impressive but almost destroyed building, unused since the 50s. Despite it is only ruins, it’s the second biggest Jewish temple in Bulgaria after the Synagogue in Sofia.\n\nThe interior was impressive, with rich ornaments, several archs and two towers. Inside, there were two marble stones with the names of the Vidin Jews that give their lives for the freedom of Bulgaria between the Liberation and the First World War. Now, all of this is left to our imagination…\n\nThe St. Dimitar Cathedral\n\nAnother stop on our day trip in Vidin was the Cathedral named after St. Dimitar. It is “hidden” in a park close to the city center. I was surprised to hear learn it is the second biggest in Bulgaria after St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia- another thing Vidin can be proud of.\n\nAnother interesting fact is, that this church is one of the few in Bulgaria where you can see a rare fresco with images of Bulgarian revolutionaries – Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev, Lyuben Karavelov and Georgi Sava Rakovski.\n\nAs any religious building in Bulgaria, there is no entrance fee for the Cathedral.\n\nThe Danube River and Park\n\nA walk along the Danube river in Vidin is also a preferred afternoon activity in the city. The park is rather small and can’t compete with my favourite Danube park in Silistra (on the other part of Bulgaria) but is also a nice place to be.\n\nSample Itinerary of Vidin\n\nVidin can be visited for a day trip from Sofia with bus or train. The town’s main sites are in short distances from one another. A sample itinerary would include:\n\nStarting point: Central Railway Station where you can see the Monument of the futility – dedicated to the futility and nonsense of the Seriban-Bulgarian war during 1885 in the form of a soldier with a sorrowful expression despite the victory.\n\nSt. Dimitar Cathedral;\n\nMosque of Osman Pazvantoglu with the Library;\n\nDanube Park;\n\nOld Sunagogue;\n\nEnd point: Baba Vida Fortress."
