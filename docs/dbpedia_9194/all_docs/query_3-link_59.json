        "text": "Dimitar Glavchev has been serving as Bulgaria's caretaker prime minister following the resignation of Nikolai Denkov's coalition government in March 2024.\n\nFollowing inconclusive elections in June 2024, Bulgaria is edging closer to its seventh election in almost four years after the GERB party's projected government failed to muster enough support in Bulgaria's parliament.\n\nInitial expectations following the June parliamentary elections and European Parliament elections were that GERB's victory in them, coupled with an increased showing for the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) would lead to them forming a coalition with a third partner, but this has not happened.\n\nGERB leader Boyko Borissov said the proposed coalition was a non-starter, and said: \"Let's forget about the vote, just return to campaigning and beg the citizens for their forgiveness.\"\n\nAfter GERB's failure to form a government, the mandate will now go to the MRF. In case of another failure, President Radev will opt for a party of his choosing.\n\nBulgaria's political crisis began in 2021 with the fall from power of then-prime minister Boyko Borissov and his GERB party. Observers says the prolonged political impasse makes Bulgaria - one of the EU's poorest countries - vulnerable to Russian influence and weakens Nato's eastern flank.\n\nThe democracy advocacy group, Freedom House, has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms and abuse of authority.\n\nSome key dates in Bulgaria's history:\n\n500BC - Thracian tribes settle in what is now south eastern Bulgaria. They are subsequently subjugated by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great and later the area becomes part of the Roman Empire.\n\n4th Century AD - Goths migrate to northern Bulgaria. The Gothic bishop Ulfilas translates the Bible from Greek to Gothic, creating the Gothic alphabet in the process - the first book written in a Germanic language.\n\n632 - Khan Kubrat unites the three largest Bulgar tribes, forming Old Great Bulgaria, which is located in what is now southern Ukraine and southern Russia. After his death and military defeat, many Bulgars move west into the Balkans.\n\n681-1018 - First Bulgarian Empire. After defeating a Byzantine army under Constantine IV, Bulgars secure recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube. They gradually adopt the region's prevailing Slavic language. Bulgaria becomes an important regional power. Bulgarians besiege Constantinople in 923 and 924. In 1014, under Byzantium's Basil II \"the Bulgar Slayer\", the Bulgarians are decisively defeated at the Battle of Kleidion.\n\n890s - The earliest form of the Cyrillic alphabet - later versions of which are now used in dozens of Slavonic languages - is created by Bulgarian scholars.\n\n1018-1185 - Bulgaria comes under Byzantine rule.\n\n1185-1396 - Second Bulgarian Empire. A dominant power in the Balkans, defeating the Byzantine Empire in several major battles. It reaches its peak under the 12th and 13th Century Tsars Kaloyan and Ivan Asen II before gradually being conquered by the Ottomans in the late 14th Century.\n\n1396-1878 - Ottoman occupation of Bulgaria. Often referred to as the \"Turkish yoke\". Following their conquests in the Balkans, the Turkish authorities destroyed most medieval Bulgarian fortresses to prevent rebellions. Large towns and the areas where Ottoman power predominated remained severely depopulated until the 19th Century.\n\nThe Ottoman system declines in the 17th Century and had largely collapsed by the end of the 18th Century. In the first decades of the 19th Centuries the Balkan Peninsula experiences widespread anarchy.\n\n1876 - April uprising: The nationwide uprising against Ottoman rule is violently suppressed, with thousands massacred by Turkish troops. The massacres aroused a broad public reaction among liberal Europeans such as William Gladstone, who launches a campaign against the \"Bulgarian Horrors\".\n\n1876-77 - Constantinople Conference. Following the 1875 Herzegovinian uprising and the Bulgarian 1876 uprising, the Great Powers call for political reforms in Bosnia and Ottoman territories with a majority-Bulgarian population. The Ottoman Empire refuses to accept the reforms.\n\n1877-78 - Russo-Turkish War. Following Turkey's refusal to accept reforms, Russian forces invade, with Bulgarians fighting alongside the advancing Russians - decisively defeating Ottoman forces at the Shipka Pass and Pleven.\n\n1878 - Treaty of San Stefano - Russia and Turkey recognise an autonomous Bulgaria\n\n1878 - Treaty of Berlin: fearing the establishment of a large Russian client state in the Balkans, the other Great Powers are reluctant to accept San Stefano and create a much smaller Bulgarian principality. Eastern Rumelia remains under Ottoman rule.\n\n1886 - Eastern Rumelia is merged with Bulgaria.\n\n1887 - Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha elected prince.\n\n1908 - Bulgaria declares itself an independent kingdom. Ferdinand assumes title of tsar.\n\n1912-13 - First and Second Balkan Wars Keen to revise the Treaty of Berlin, Bulgaria allies with Serbia, Greece, Montenegro to partition Turkish territory in Europe. After gains in the first war, Bulgaria is attacked by its former allies in the second war, and forced to concede some of its earlier gains.\n\n1914-18 - World War One. Bulgaria allies itself with Germany. There is significant fighting in northern Greece and in Macedonia against Allied armies. Some 100,000 Bulgarian troops are killed, one of the most severe per capita losses of any country involved in the war.\n\n1939-45 World War Two. Soviet army invades German-occupied Bulgaria in 1944. Soviet-backed Fatherland Front takes power.\n\n1946 - Monarchy abolished in referendum and republic declared. Communist Party wins election. Georgi Dimitrov elected prime minister.\n\n1954 - Todor Zhivkov becomes Communist Party general secretary. Bulgaria becomes staunch USSR ally.\n\n1971 - Zhivkov becomes president.\n\n1978 - Georgi Markov, a BBC World Service journalist and Bulgarian dissident, dies in London after apparently being injected with poison from the tip of an umbrella.\n\n1984 - Zhivkov government tries to force Turkish minority to assimilate and take Slavic names. Many resist and in 1989 some 300,000 flee the country.\n\n1989 - Reforms in the Soviet Union inspire demands for democratisation. Zhivkov ousted. Multiparty system introduced.\n\n1991 - New constitution proclaims Bulgaria a parliamentary republic and provides broad range of freedoms.\n\n1993 - Mass privatisation programme.\n\n1997 - Mass protests over economic crisis. Opposition boycotts parliament and calls for elections. Bulgarian currency pegged to German mark.\n\n1999 - Protracted demolition attempts on marble mausoleum of first communist leader Georgi Dimitrov become national joke.\n\n2000 - Post-communist prosecutors close file on Georgi Markov case. In December Markov is awarded Bulgaria's highest honour, the Order of Stara Planina, for his contribution to Bulgarian literature and his opposition to the communist authorities.\n\n2004 - Bulgaria joins Nato\n\n2007 - Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union, raising EU membership to 27.\n\n2008 - European Commission suspends EU aid worth hundreds of millions of euros after series of reports criticise Bulgarian government for failing to take effective action against corruption and organised crime.\n\n2010 - Boris Tsankov, a prominent crime journalist who specialised in reporting on the mafia in Bulgaria, is shot dead in Sofia.\n\n2012 - A suspected suicide bomber kills five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian driver on a bus in the Black Sea resort of Burgas.\n\n2013 - Government say Burgas suicide attack was most likely the work of the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Hezbollah denies the allegation.\n\nWeeks of protests over official corruption culminate in a blockade of parliament and clashes with police.\n\n2015 - Bulgaria says it will extend a controversial fence along its border with Turkey by 80km to help stem the flow of illegal immigrants.\n\n2022 - EU interior ministers accept Croatia into the 26-nation, border-free Schengen zone, but reject Romania and Bulgaria amid concerns that both are soft on illegal migration.\n\n2024 - Bulgaria and Romania join the EU's Schengen zone for air and sea travel."
