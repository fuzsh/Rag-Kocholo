        "text": "Region Vidin is with unusually rich history. Vidin has built its structure and appearance during centuries. Ancient Roman, medieval Bulgarian, Turkish after emancipation and new Vidin are piled up one on top of the other. During the first century B. C. were living Thracian tribes Mizi and Tribali, conquered and included in the Roman Empire during I century A. D. The numerous monuments, architectural fragments, sculptural figures, bronze casting and pottery products testify for the upsurge of antique Ratsiariya (Archar village) and Bononia (Vidin city) in the Roman epoch of domination.\n\nBononia continues its existence during the Middle Ages but as Bdin. During First Bulgarian country it is a centre of administrative region and bishop’s seat, Bulgarian stronghold defending Byzantium invasion in 1003.\n\nImpetuous and changing is the historical fortune of Bdin during Second Bulgarian country. In the 90s Region Bdin existed as independent feudal principality with despot ruler Shishman chosen for Bulgarian king in 1323. In 1371 ahead with king Ivan- Sratsimir Bdin became a centre of independent feudal principality.\n\nDuring XIII - XIV century Bdin was not only a political but also an important business centre of north- western Bulgarian lands with strong developed crafts and applied arts, large producer of cereals and along with these a literary centre. Bdin’s fortress was the last one that felt under Ottoman rule. Dedicated and heroic was the fight of Bulgarians from Vidin outskirts during second quarter of XIX century. Risings and rebellions aroused in the regions of Belogradchik, Vidin and Kula. Even if the rebellions were unsuccessful they show to the European public that revolutionary strength grows in Bulgaria capable of struggle for political liberation.\n\nDuring February 1878 Vidin was emancipated from Ottoman rule."
