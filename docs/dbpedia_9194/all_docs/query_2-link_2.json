        "text": "Vidin\n\nBulgaria\n\nVidin, port town, extreme northwestern Bulgaria, on the Danube River. An agricultural and trade centre, Vidin has a fertile hinterland renowned for its wines and is the site of an annual fair. A regular ferry service connects it with Calafat, across the Danube in Romania.\n\nVidin occupies the site of an old Celtic settlement, Dunonia, founded in the 3rd century bc and fortified by the Romans as Bononia. A Bulgarian fortress dating from the 13th century and called Babini Vidini Kuli (“Granny Vida’s Towers”) is well-preserved. The churches of St. Panteleimon and St. Petka have fine murals. During the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1396), when the town was known as Bdin, a brief revolt occurred there; later, as the empire under Ivan-Aleksandǔr was disintegrating, he gave a third of it to his son, with Bdin as the capital. In 1396 the Vidin kingdom fell to the Turks, who ruled it until 1878 except for a period of Austrian occupation from 1683 to 1690. Pop. (2004 est.) 53,488.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
