Biography

Conway (Jenkins) Twitty is Notable.

Parents:

Floyd D. Jenkins (1914 - 1969)

Velma McGinnis Jenkins (1912 - 1994)

The Jenkins family were of Welsh descent. (1)

Harold was born Sept 1, 1933. He was named by his Great Uncle, after the Uncle's favorite silent movie actor Harold Lloyd.

When he was 10 years old, the family moved to Helena, Arkansas. It was here that he had his first musical group, the Phillips County Ramblers. He also had a Saturday radio show.

Harold had a strong passion for baseball and he was good at it. He was so good that he was offered to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school; however, the United States Army drafted him into service before he could sign a contract.

Military Service

US Army: He served in the Far East and organized a group called The Cimmerons to entertain fellow GIs. (2)

In 1957, while Harold was traveling through the South between Arkansas and Texas, while looking at a road map when he spotted Conway, Arkansas, and Twitty, Texas, and decided to chose Conway Twitty as a more memorable name. (3)

Conway's first marriage was to Ellen Matthews, and lasted from 1953 to 1954. With Ellen, he had a son named Michael.

His second marriage, and longest, was to Temple "Mickey" Medley. Conway married Mickey in 1956 and had three children by her: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. Mickey and Conway had divorced in early 1970, and remarried again by the end of 1970. In 1984, after 28 years of marriage, the stress of her husband being away often, took its toll on Mickey and she and Conway divorced. It was said that the divorce was brought on because Twitty City was an open tourist complex, and that Mickey felt very uncomfortable with the fans around the mansion. She wanted to have it solely as a home.

In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores "Dee" Henry. They were married until Twitty's death.
