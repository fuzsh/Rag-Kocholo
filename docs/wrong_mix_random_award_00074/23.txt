Often the best place to find where someone was from is to start with where they died. I suggest getting death certificates and obituaries. Both should have parents' names and obit may have exact birthplace and surviving siblings which can be a BIG help. If you know where they married then get their marriage record. If you know what cemetery these people are buried in their headstones should give birth and death dates. If you know what church they were members of or where they are buried check with each to see what may be in their records on them.
