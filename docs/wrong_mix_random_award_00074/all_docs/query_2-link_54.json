        "text": "Calendar of Events\n\nMark your calendars for these fun events across the state of South Carolina.\n\nWeekends, May and June\n\nAg + Art Tour\n\nEach weekend in May and June, farms in South Carolina swing open their barn doors and artists welcome visitors to their workshops to showcase some of the cool innovations, artistry and foodways that are happening in the state’s rural areas. Each farm will offer a unique selection of food items along with art and crafts, all to a soundtrack of lowing cows and local bluegrass.\n\nMay 1–4\n\nArtFields\n\nEach spring, Lake City becomes a living art exhibit as more than 400 art installations are set up in impromptu galleries that range from shops and restaurants to a drive-in movie theater, renovated warehouses and outdoor gardens.\n\nMay 10–12\n\nArtisphere\n\nIt’s all about creativity at Greenville’s annual celebration of art, which turns 20 this year. Beyond stunning exhibitions of artworks, the city will be filled with live music performances, culinary demonstrations, lots of hands-on art projects for kids and shopping opportunities galore.\n\nMay 10–12\n\nSpecial Olympics 2024 State Summer Games\n\nFounded in 1968, Special Olympics supports more than 5 million athletes with intellectual disabilities around the world. Columbia’s Fort Jackson is the site for South Carolina’s 2024 State Summer Games. Events include bocce (over 21), bowling (under 21), gymnastics, swimming, track and field, powerlifting and softball.\n\nMay 18\n\nAll Saints Garden Tour\n\nJust in time for peak blooms, take a stroll through some of Hilton Head and Bluffton’s most elegant private gardens. Afterward, stop by the church, where you can purchase cookies, cakes and other goodies baked by parishioners. The annual event supports Lowcountry-area charities supporting hunger, homelessness, aging and literacy needs.\n\nMay 22–June 9\n\nSpoleto USA\n\nFounded in 1977 by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti, Spoleto has become one of America’s premier performing arts festivals. Each year, actors, musicians, poets, storytellers, dancers and other performers gather in Charleston for 17 days of performances in venues throughout the city.\n\nMay 23–26\n\nBlack Cowboy Festival\n\nHeld in Sumter, the Black Cowboy Festival honors the legacy of America’s African American frontiersmen with horsemanship exhibitions, historic programming, line-dancing lessons, equine workshops, mechanical bull rides, live music and food.\n\nMay 24–26\n\nThe Original Gullah Festival of South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina’s Gullah Geechee heritage is based in Beaufort, so it’s no wonder that this commemoration of language, food, dance, culture, crafts, storytelling and, of course, food, is celebrated there each year.\n\nJune 6–9\n\nFestival of Flowers\n\nGreenwood comes alive each June with group bike rides; garden and museum tours; theater performances; an auto show; juried art and arts and crafts shows and a street fair complete with live music. The setting, a downtown block planted with lush topiaries, couldn’t be prettier.\n\nJune 7–16\n\nChautauqua History Comes Alive Festival\n\nHistory is never boring during this five-day festival at Spartanburg’s main library, where storytellers will take on the personas of historical figures and share tales that didn’t always make it into the history books. Expect not just amazing performances but–thanks to Chautauqua’s goal of celebrating critical thought–stimulating conversation about legacies, lore and personalities.\n\nJune 14–19\n\nJuneteenth GVL Mega Fest\n\nThough you’ll find plenty of music, dancing, food and shopping at this special celebration in Greenville, the lineup also features inspiring speakers, poetry readings and more, in partnership with the Urban League of the Upstate, The Greenville County Section of National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nJune 15–Sept. 8\n\n(Un) Settled: The Landscape in American Art\n\nDrawing inspiration from the aesthetic romanticism of the Hudson River School, this exhibition at the Columbia Museum of Art showcases works by prominent artists such as Georgia O’Keeffe, Ed Ruscha and Ana Mendieta while delving into the evolving relationship between landscapes and cultural identity.\n\nJuly 4\n\nLexington County Peach Festival\n\nWhile Georgia may feature the peach in its state nickname, South Carolina outshines its neighboring state in shipping the juicy, fuzzy-skinned delights. Ending with fireworks, this fruitful fest in Gilbert comes complete with a peach parade, pageants, a car show and, of course, copious amounts of peach cobbler.\n\nJuly 4\n\nSalute From the Shore\n\nPrepare for a spectacular aerial display along the coast from Cherry Grove Beach to Bluffton as Independence Day beachgoers keep their eyes on the skies. Last year’s flyover highlights included F-16 Fighting Falcons from Shaw Air Force Base and a C-17 Globemaster 3 from Joint Base Charleston.\n\nJuly 11–13\n\nSC Festival of Discovery: BBQ & Blues\n\nUptown Greenwood harmonizes tender brisket cooked low and slow with boogie-woogie and 12-bar blues. Competition barbecue teams dish it out in a Kansas City Barbeque Society BBQ and Hash Cook-Off, while a lineup of blues bands set stages ablaze.\n\nJuly 12–21\n\nBeaufort Water Festival\n\nThe Lettuce City’s annual coastal fiesta is back for its 68th year. Between the children’s toad fishing tournament; the stunt plane air show; and the bed race, in which four runners push one rider on a gurney, there is loads of family-friendly fun on tap.\n\nJuly 20\n\nCharleston Caribbean Jerk Festival\n\nJamaican jerk seasoning takes center stage at Riverfront Park in North Charleston at the 9th annual celebration of the spice at the forefront of Caribbean cuisine. Who will claim the title of Top Jerk Chef 2024?\n\nJuly 27\n\nSweetgrass Festival\n\nMount Pleasant’s Memorial Waterfront Park hosts the 20th annual Sweetgrass Festival celebrating the history, traditions and culture of the Gullah Geechee people and highlighting their sweetgrass basket-making artistry.\n\nAug. 2–Sept. 28\n\nTell Her About It\n\nJeff Querin and Stephen Wayne, owners of 34 West Theater Company, star in their newest production, a comedy set to the tunes of Billy Joel, in which three actors play 25 characters. Children under 12 are not permitted in the theater. Performances run Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., and there’s a showing on Tuesday, Sept. 17, at 7 p.m.\n\nAug. 3\n\nRivals in Red\n\nPremier League soccer, which has been attracting a record television audience on this side of the pond, comes to the midlands as Manchester United takes on Liverpool in a friendly at Williams-Brice Stadium.\n\nAug. 6\n\nStraight No Chaser\n\nPredating Pitch Perfect and The Sing-Off, this nine-man contemporary a cappella group has been blending vocals for over 25 years since they came together in college at Indiana University. Greenville’s Peace Center hosts the lone South Carolina stop on their Summer: The 90s tour.\n\nAug. 8\n\nStick Figure\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Scott Woodruff and his band bring their unique brand of contemporary roots reggae to the Holy City as the Sacred Sands Summer Tour rolls into Charleston’s Credit One Stadium. SOJA and Little Stranger are the opening acts.\n\nAug. 14\n\nJoe Bonamassa\n\nThe virtuosic blues musician has been electrifying audiences since 1989 when the then 12-year-old budding guitar hero opened for B.B. King. Experience Bonamassa live at the North Charleston Coliseum & Performing Arts Center.\n\nAug. 30–Sept. 1\n\nWaves of Praise\n\nGospel fans flock to the Burroughs & Chapin Pavilion Place in Myrtle Beach to hear dozens of national acts as well as local and regional performers.\n\nSept. 1\n\nCook Out Southern 500\n\nThe NASCAR Cup Series regular season finale hits Darlington Raceway on Labor Day weekend as race fans find out which drivers make the round of 16.\n\nSept. 6–7\n\nAiken’s Makin’\n\nArea artisans’ wares take the spotlight at this two-day arts and crafts show in downtown Aiken.
