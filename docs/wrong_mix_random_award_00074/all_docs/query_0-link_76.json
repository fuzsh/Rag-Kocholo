He was found at his home on Feb. 11, 2017.\n\nQuincy, as he was known, was born in New York City on Sept. 11, 1947, to the late Timothy Smith, tailoring instructor, and Artisse Macomson Smith, teacher. He was the fourth of five children. A native son of Denmark, Quincy grew up on the campus of the SC. Area Trade School -- now Denmark Technical College -- and attended Voorhees Elementary School and Voorhees High School. He was a Boy Scout, and an active member and acolyte at St. Phillips' Episcopal Church. He received a certificate in barbering from the Area Trade School.\n\nQuincy was drafted into the U.S. Marine Corps in December 1968 and was stationed in Platoon 1064 at Parris Island (SC) and Camp Pendleton (CA) before being deployed to Vietnam. He had three occupational specialties: field radio operator, battery technician and helicopter support (shore party). He described his job: a helicopter dropped him off in the jungle, so he was the first person on the ground. Wearing a bright red jacket, he served an air traffic control function. He dealt with body bags, big cannons, etc., and was often the last person off the ground. Regrettably, he lost several platoon mates. Quincy received a medical discharge in 1970, but the war experience weighed heavily on him for the rest of his life.\n\nWhen Quincy returned from the military, he enrolled in a two-year industrial management program at the Ohio Mechanics Institute, University of Cincinnati. He returned to Denmark and graduated from Voorhees College with a BS degree in business administration in 1974. He worked in the industrial engineering field in Cincinnati, Ohio, Livonia, Mich., and Lakeland, Fla., before returning to Denmark in the 1980s. He worked in local schools and factories for the remainder of his career.\n\nQuincy was \"an original.\" An outdoorsman, an independent and opinionated thinker, he enjoyed a good joke. He was passionate about fishing and dreamed of establishing a program where he could teach children to fish. He cared deeply for animals, especially his faithful dogs. He was the volunteer caretaker at a local cemetery, he was attentive to the needy, he advocated for veterans. He loved and was very proud of his three sons.\n\nHe is survived by his sons, Rodrick Kendall Smith of Baltimore, Mark Anthony Smith of Alexandria Va., and Scott Anton Smith (Pauline) of Glen Burnie, Md. He also is survived by four grandchildren, Brooke, Antonio Quest, Olivia and James; his brothers and sisters, Ronald T. Smith (Elaine), Roulette Wm. Smith, Janet Dickerson Stephens (J. Paul) and Cheryl L. Blankenship (Ruby Sales); as well as two aunts, a host of nieces, nephews and cousins, and many good friends.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11 a.m. Friday, Feb 17, in the Denmark Chapel of Carroll Mortuary, 1646 Church St., Denmark.

George Ichael Parrott was born on March 31, 1964, in Charleston, SC, at the \"old\" Medical University Hospital.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, he was baptized in the \"new\" MUSC hospital, the Ashley River Tower (ART) by Chaplain George Rossi and he departed this life in the ART. Many of the nursing, technical and administrative staff who cared for him over the many years he was a patient at MUSC, mostly at ART, visited with him on Saturday. He fought a long, hard battle with many serious health issues. As was normal at any time George was in the hospital, his devoted mother, Betty, and Aunt Eva, were with him until he breathed his last breath.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his grandparents, Gordon Otto and Lottie Weatherford, his biological grandmother, Maggie Mae Singletary Grooms, his beloved uncle, Gilbert Weatherford, his biological father, Vernon Parrott and an aunt, Marie Grooms McCoy.\n\nHe is survived by his mother, Betty J. Weatherford Blankenship of North Charleston SC, his sister, Joyce Peggy Mae Gromely; four aunts: Ailene Fairburn (Thomas William), Eva Singletary Clement (Mommy #2), Jessie Parrott Allen (David), Dorothy Weatherford Smoak; an uncle, Nelson Weatherford; a dear friend, Elaine Erett (Mommy #3) and a number of cousins.\n\nGeorge graduated from R. B. Stall High School. George was a very sociable person. He never met a stranger and loved to talk to just about anyone! It didn't matter if it was at a rehab center or Walmart. He just loved people in general! He loved working with the elderly and those less fortunate. He adored children and animals. He will be remembered for his heart of gold, his great sense of humor, his love of fishing and hunting, the many nostalgic stories he told about his life adventures and those with best buds, Tavis Budzynski and James David Overstreet. He loved telling stories about his Uncles Gilbert and Smoak, and his two Grandmothers, Lottie and Maggie Mae! Gilbert was not only his uncle but his big brother, his father and his best friend. He taught him all he knew about cars and other manly things.\n\n\"Little April,\" he was there when you were born. You \"had\" him when you wrapped your little hand around his finger. He loved you like you were his own and so proud of your accomplishments. Reliving these memories brought him such happiness! George enjoyed many hobbies: He loved to fish! When he wasn't or couldn't fish, he'd spend time cleaning or rebuilding reels he'd bought at yard sales, which, by the way, was another of his favorite things to do. He also loved to hunt. Unfortunately, after he became disabled, he wasn't able to do much hunting but he could take his guns apart, clean/repair them and put them back together! He loved to cook. His mother taught him how to cook. She never had to worry about a dull knife in the kitchen because George was an expert at keeping knives sharpened to where \"they would shave the hair off your arms!\"\n\nOne of their favorite things to do was to hit the farmers market and meat market on Saturday morning. He loved to shop. His mother would say that he was worse than a woman because when he got in a store; he never wanted to leave! He loved music; everything from country to opera. He loved movies, specifically westerns and war movies. John Wayne was one of his favorite cowboys! He loved history: he liked nothing better than a good debate over American South History or the Civil War. Many people didn't know just how smart and talented a man he was.\n\nHe was a very talented carpenter who helped build Northwoods Apartments and he helped a neighbor build his house. He not only knew the carpentry aspect of building but knew plumbing, electrical, roofing, masonry and concrete work. One of his favorite jobs was at Customs. He also worked at Gore Manufacturing, where, unfortunately, he hurt his back and became permanently disabled at a young age. George wasn't just a laborer on all of his jobs, he was promoted to Foreman because of his excellent work ethics, ability to motivate other workers and his professional skills.\n\nLast but not least, George loved and adored his mother! Oh, yes, like all families, they would have their disagreements but they took care of each other. He was always picking up things for her on his shopping trips, hoping to make her smile. He loved to take his fingers and tickle her under the chin and go, \"Goochi-goo.\" He knew that would get to her! They loved to watch the Gathers Homecoming Gospel Show on Saturday evenings together. George was big in stature but he was a gentle giant and was quick to show simple acts of kindness when least expected. Sometimes the best witness is kindness. George Ichael Parrott may have been a simple man to some but was larger than life to many of us and will be missed by all of us who loved him so dearly.\n\nThe relatives and friends of George Parrott are invited to attend his funeral services on Saturday, July 07, 2018 at 1:00pm. Burial will follow at Carolina Memorial Park.\n\nFrom: Diane Renfrow dhrenfrow(at)yahoo.com\n\n+2018, Charleston, Charleston Co., SC, Obituary\n\nPublished in Charleston Post & Courier on Jan. 5, 2019\n\nBlanche Blankenship, age 94, widow of Tereance L.
