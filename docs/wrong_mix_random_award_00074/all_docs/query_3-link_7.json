He was named by his Great Uncle, after the Uncle's favorite silent movie actor Harold Lloyd.\n\nWhen he was 10 years old, the family moved to Helena, Arkansas. It was here that he had his first musical group, the Phillips County Ramblers. He also had a Saturday radio show.\n\nHarold had a strong passion for baseball and he was good at it. He was so good that he was offered to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school; however, the United States Army drafted him into service before he could sign a contract.\n\nMilitary Service\n\nUS Army: He served in the Far East and organized a group called The Cimmerons to entertain fellow GIs. (2)\n\nIn 1957, while Harold was traveling through the South between Arkansas and Texas, while looking at a road map when he spotted Conway, Arkansas, and Twitty, Texas, and decided to chose Conway Twitty as a more memorable name.

Conway married Mickey in 1956 and had three children by her: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. Mickey and Conway had divorced in early 1970, and remarried again by the end of 1970. In 1984, after 28 years of marriage, the stress of her husband being away often, took its toll on Mickey and she and Conway divorced. It was said that the divorce was brought on because Twitty City was an open tourist complex, and that Mickey felt very uncomfortable with the fans around the mansion. She wanted to have it solely as a home.\n\nIn 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores \"Dee\" Henry.
