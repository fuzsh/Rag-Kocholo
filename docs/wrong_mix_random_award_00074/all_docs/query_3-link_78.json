        "text": "Country Western Two-step Lessons\n\nThe Two-Step is the most popular Country Western partner dance, a staple in any country bar. Dancers follow a counter-clockwise line of dance, effortlessly spinning and weaving between other couples. Characterized by a straightforward rhythm and smooth, linear movement, this dance showcases exciting partner styling and rapid spins, reminiscent of a cowboy wielding his rope. Steps like the Lasso and the Lariat pay homage to the Western roots of this dance.\n\nCountry Western Swing Lessons\n\nThe Country Swing is a dynamic spot dance with partners in constant, electrifying motion. Couples tear up the floor with looping arms, thrilling dips and barrel-roll spins! Along with the Two-Step, Swing is one of the easiest and most essential dances with which to begin your country dance journey."
