        "text": "The secret of Loretta Lynn, historians Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann write, “is in her honesty. Her strength is in her womanhood. Her pride is in her working-class background.” She achieved a superstardom that no female singer before her – even her mentor Patsy Cline – had ever enjoyed and her sassy lyrics, earthy humor, and woman-focused perspective transformed country music, resulting in 79 charting records, including 52 Top 10s and 16 No. 1s.\n\nNamed for Loretta Young and delivered by “Old Aunt Harriet,” an 80-year-old blind midwife, Loretta was born in a two-room log cabin in a small coal-mining community of eastern Kentucky. She worked hard on the farm and in the house, singing old Appalachian ballads and story songs she’d learned from her mother, and on Saturday nights would listen to the Grand Ole Opry on a battery-powered radio. At 15, she married returning war veteran “Doolittle” Lynn, the first boy she’d ever kissed. The two moved to Washington state and within four years she’d given birth to three children.\n\nRecognizing the talent in Loretta’s voice, Doolittle bought her a guitar. Soon she was performing locally and, by early 1960, she had recorded her first record. To promote it, she and Doolittle sent copies, along with a photograph of Loretta, to radio stations around the country. They then set off to do it in person – sleeping in their car, living on baloney and cheese sandwiches, and stopping at every country station they could find. “Sometimes I’d sit there for three or four hours before they’d play my record,” Loretta laughs.\n\nOn July 25, 1960, the song hit No. 14 on the Billboard country charts and the two headed for Nashville. Loretta took Music City by storm, earning a contract with Owen Bradley as a Decca recording artist in September of 1961 and a spot in the Grand Ole Opry cast one year later. In 1964, Decca released Loretta’s first self-penned record — “Wine, Women and Song”/“Happy Birthday”— warning a man that he wouldn’t get away with cheating. Both sides went to No. 3 on the country charts. She came into her own between 1966 and 1968 with megahits “You Ain’t Woman Enough,” “Don’t Come Home a-Drinkin’,” and “Fist City.” Her most controversial song, “The Pill,” was recorded in 1972, though record execs waited two years before releasing it, concerned about what was considered risqué subject matter at the time. In a 1975 Playgirl interview, Lynn recounted that doctors frequently thanked her for the song, saying it had done more to highlight the availability of birth control in rural areas than their own literature.\n\nLoretta won CMA’s Female Vocalist of the Year awards in 1967, 1972, and 1973 and, in 1976, released her best-selling autobiography, Coal Miner’s Daughter, made into a hit movie four years later. In 1972, she was named CMA Entertainer of the Year, the first woman in history to be chosen for the award. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nBorn: April 14, 1932, Butcher Hollow, Kentucky"
