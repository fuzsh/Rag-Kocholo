        "text": "After graduating from the University of South Carolina Aiken, I was an assistant golf pro at Woodside Plantation for three years before moving back to Barnwell to work for Farm Bureau Insurance. I started my career as an agent with Farm Bureau Insurance on June 1, 2003. I reside in Barnwell with my wife Lindsay, and our sons, Cameron and Cayson. When I am not working, I enjoy playing golf and watching my sons participate in all of their activities."
