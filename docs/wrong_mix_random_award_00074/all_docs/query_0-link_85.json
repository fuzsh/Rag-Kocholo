And the said County Surveyors shall in six months after the passing of this Act make return to the Trustees hereinbefore mentioned of regular plats of all such tracts as shall be laid out and surveyed by virtue of this Act.\"\n\n4\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nIn pursuance whereof the eight tracts were laid out which are now included in the counties of Hancock, Oglethorpe, Greene, Clarke, Jackson and Franklin and still an other across the Savannah river in the State of South Car olina, which will be treated of hereafter. These tracts were known as the Fishing and the Falling Creek tracts in Oglethorpe, the Richland Creek tract in Greene, the Sandy Creek tract in Clarke, the Shoal Creek tract in Franklin, the Shoul der-bone tract i Hancock and the Keowee tract in South Carolina.\n\nThe following year, 1785, a bill was introduced to com plete the establishment of a \"public seat of learning,\" which was approved January 27, 1785, and constitutes the Char ter of the University of Georgia. It is as follows :\n\nTHE CHARTER.\n\nAs it is the distinguishing happiness of free governments; that civil order should be the result of choice and not neces sity, and the common wishes of the people become the law of the land, theirpublic prosperity and even existence, very much depends upon suitably forming the minds and morals of their citizens. When the minds of the people in general are viciously disposed and unprincipled, and. their conduct disorderly, a free government will be attended with greater confusions and evils more horrid than the wild unculti vated state of nature: it can only be happy where the pub lic principles and opinions are properly directed and their manners regulated. This is an influence beyond the stretch of laws and punishments, and can be claimed only by reli gion and education. It should, therefore, be among the first objects of those who wish well to the national prosperity to encourage and support the principles of religion and moral ity, and early to place the youth under the forming hand of society, that by instruction, they may be moulded to the love of virtue and good order. Sending them abroad to other communities for their education will not answer these pur poses, is too humiliating an acknowledgment of the igno rance or inferiority of our own, and will always be the cause\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n5\n\nof so great foreign attachments, that upon principles of policy, it is inadmissible.\n\nThis country in the times of our common danger and dis tress found such security in the principles and abilities which wise regulations had before established in the minds of our countrymen, that our present happiness, joined to the pleasing prospects, should conspire to make us feel our selves under the strongest obligation to form the youth, the rising hope of our land, to render the like glorious and es sential services to our country.\n\nAnd, whereas, For thegieat purpose of internal education, divers allotments of land have at different times been made, particularly by the Legislature at their session in July, 1783, and February, 1784, all of which maybe comprehended and made the basis of one general and complete establishment-' Therefore enacted,\n\n2. SEC. I. That the general superintendence and regulation of the literature of this State, and in particular of the pub lic seat of learning, shall be entrusted to one board, denomi nated ''The Board of Visitors,\" hereby vested with all the powers of visitation to see that the intent of this institution is carried into effect; and John Houston, James Habersham, William Few, Joseph Clay, Abraham Baldwin, Wil liam Houston, Nathan Brownson, John Habersham, Abiel Holmes, Jenkin Davis, Hugh Lawson, William Glascockand Benjamin Taliaferro, who shall compose another board, denominated the \"Board of Trustees.\" These two boards, united, or a majority of each of them, shall compose the \"Senatus Academicus of the University of Georgia.\"\n\n3. SEC. II. All statutes, laws and ordinances for the gov ernment of the University, shall be made and enacted by the two boards united or a majority of each of them, subject always to be laid before the General Assembly, as often as required and to be repealed or disallowed as the General As sembly may think proper.\n\n4. SEO. III. Property vested in the University shall never TDC sold without the joint concurrence of the two boards, and by an act of the Legislature; but the leasing, farming\n\n6\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nand managing of the property of the University for its con stant support,-shallbe the business of the Board of Trustees. For this purpose they are hereby constituted a body corpo rate and politic by the name of \"The Trustees of the Uni versity of Georgia,\" by which they shall have perpetual suc cession and shall and may be a person in law, capable to plead and be impleaded, defend and be defended, answer and be answered unto, also to have, take, possess, acquire, pur chase or otherwise receive lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, or other estates, and the same to lease, use, manage or improve, for the good and benefit of said Uni versity ; and all property given or granted to or by the gov ernment of this State for the advancement of learning in general, is hereby vested in such Trustees> in trust, as herein described\n\n5. SEC. IV. As the appointment of a person to be Presi dent and head of the University is one of the first and most important concerns on which its respect and usefulness greatly depends, the Board of Trustees shall first examine and nominate, but the appointment of the President shall be by the twro boards jointly, who shall also have the power of removing him from office for misdemeanor, unfaithfulness or incapacity.\n\n6. SEC. V. There shall be a stated annual meeting of the Senatus Academicus at the University, or at any other place or time to be appointed by themselves, at which the Gov ernor of the State, or in his absence, the President of the Council, shall preside; their records to be kept by the Secre tary of the University.\n\n7. SEC. VI. As the affairs and business of the University may make more frequent meetings of the Trustees neces sary, the President and two of \"the members are empowered to'appoint a meeting of the board, notice always to be given to the rest, or letters left at the usual places of their abode, at least fourteen days before the said meeting; seven* of the Trustees thus convened shall be a legal meeting. In case of the death, absence or incapacity of the President, the senior Trustee shall preside. The majority of the members\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,\n\n7\n\npresent shall be considered a vote of the whole, and whete the members are divided, the President shall have the cast ing vote; Provided, always that nothing done at these special meetings shall have any force or efficacy after the ris ing of the then next annual meeting of the Trustees.\n\n8. SEC. VII. The Trustees shall have the power of fillingttp all vacancies of their own board, and appointing profes sors, tutors, secretary, treasurer, stewards, or any other officers which they may think necessary, and the same to dis continue or remove as they may think fit; but not without seven of their number, at least, concurring in-such act.\n\n9. SEC. VIII. The Trustees shall prescribe the course of public studies, appoint the salaries of the different officers, form and use a public seal, adjust and determine the ex penses, and adopt such regulations, not otherwise provided for, which the good of the University may render necessary.\n\n10. SEC. IX. All officers appointed to the instruction and government of the University shall be of the Christian re ligion; and within three months after they enter into the exe cution of their trust, shall publicly take oath of allegiance and fidelity and the oath of office prescribed in the statutes of the University; the President before the Governor or President of the Council, and all other officers before the President of the University.\n\n11. SEC;. X. The President, professors, tutors, students and all officers and servants of the University whose office require their constant attendance, shall be and they are here by excused from military duty and from all such like duties and services, and all land and other property of the Univer sity is hereby exempted from taxation.\n\n12. SEC. XI. The Trustees shall not exclude any person of any religious denomination from free and equal liberty and advantages of education, or from any of the liberties, privi leges and immunities of the University in his education, ott account of his, her, or their speculative sentiments in religion, or being of a different religious profession.\n\n13. SEC. XII. The President of the University, -with the consent of the Trustees, shall have power to give and confer\n\nO\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nall such degrees, honors and licenses as are usually con ferred in colleges or universities, and shall always preside at the meeting of the Trustees and at all public exercises of the University.\n\n14. SEC. XIII. The Senatus Academicus, at their stated an nual meetings, shall consult and advise, not only upon the af fairs of the University, but also to remedy the defects and ad vance the interests of literature through the State in general. For this purpose it shall be the business of the members, pre vious to their meetings, to obtain an acquaintance with the state and regulations of the schools and places of education in their respective counties, that they may be thus possessed of the whole and have it lie before them for their mutual assistance and deliberation. Upon this information they shall recommend what kind of schools and academies shall be instituted, agreeably to the Constitution, in the several, parts of the State, and prescribe what branches of education shall be taught and inculcated. They shall also examine and recommend the instructors to be employed in them, or appoint persons for that purpose. The President of the University, as often as the duties of his station will permit, and some of the members, at least once in a year, shall visit them and examine into their order and performances.\n\n15. SEC. XIV. All public schools instituted or to be sup ported by funds or public moneys in this State, shall be con sidered as parts or members of the University and shall be under the foregoing directions and regulations.\n\n16. SEC. XV. Whatsoever public measures are necessary to be adopted for accomplishng these great and important designs, the Trustees shall, from time to time, represent and lay before the General Assembly.\n\nOn February 3, 1786, an act was passed requiring the trustees to meet and proceed to the transaction of the business for which they had been appointed.\n\nIn pursuance of this act, the first meeting of the trustees was held in Augusta, Georgia, February 13, 1786. There were present Abram Baldwin, William Few, William Glas-\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n9\n\ncock, John Habersham, Nathan Brownson, Hugh Lawson and Benjamin Taliaferro.\n\nAbram Baldwin was chosen president of the University and as such continued until the institution went into active operation in 1801.\n\nThe work of the trustees for the next fourteen years con sisted of the management of their lands with a view to ac cumulating a fund which could be used in erecting buildings and paying teachers. The scheme contemplated a long rentroll, according to the English ideas that prevailed at the time, which it was hoped would sustain the institution. But ex perience proved that rents of lands in this new country could not be depended on for a certain income.\n\n10\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nII.\n\nGreenesborough Laid Off--Senatus Academicus--First Organization of of the University--Location at Athens--Donation of Governor Milledge--The Keowee Tract--Appointment of Josiah Meigs-- Description of Athens in 1303--Report on the College.\n\n1798-1803.\n\n^ Y<\n\nOn one of the tracts in Greene county in July, 1798, the town of Greenesborough was laid off by the trustees, and one thousand acres of land were offered for sale or lease in the immediate neighborhood of the new town.\n\nIt was the desire bf some of the trustees to erect a build ing in Greenesborough and locate the college there; but there seemed to have been great difficulty in getting a quorum of the board together to act upon the suggestion. A meeting was appointed at the \"Coffee House\" in Louisville, then the capital of the State, in January, 1799. It took three suc cessive adjournments to get a quorum and then only seven were present. After the meeting of the board, the Senatus Academicus was formed and proceeded to business. This august body was composed of the Governor, the Senate, the President and Trustees of the University. They sat in sol emn state and confirmed or rejected the acts of the trus tees.\n\nOn November 28, 1800, the Senatus Academicus organ ized the college, by the election of a President at a fixed sal ary of $1,200 per annum and prescribed a curriculum of studies for six classes of students. The course of study began with arithmetic, geography, composition and \"speaking,\" and ended with moral philosophy, trigonometry, Latin and Greek, with the option of substituting the French language for either of the others, provided the tutor might be able to teach it.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n11\n\nIn addition to this, the trustees were directed to name a lo cation for the college. That body held a meeting and after repeated balloting decided upon Jackson county as the fa vored place. A committee was appointed, consisting of John Milledge, Abram Baldwin, George Walton, JohnTwiggs and Hugh Lawson, who should visit that section and select a site for the buildings.\n\nThe committe, in the latter part of June, 1801--there was no unnecessary haste made in those days--met at Billup's Tavern on the Lexington road and thence made tours of inspection to various localities.\n\nThe Augusta Chronicle of July 25, 1801, tells us that-\"the committee repaired to the county of Jackson and proceeded with attention and deliberation to examine a number of situ ations as well upon the tracts belonging to the University as upon others of private -individuals. ^Having completed their views, they proceeded by ballot to make the choice, when the vote . was unanimous in . favor of a place belonging to Mr. Daniel Easley at the Cedar Shoals upon the north fork o the Oconee river and the same was resolved to be selected and chosen for the seat of the Uni versity of Georgia. For this purpose the tract, containing 633 acres, was purchased of Mr. Easley by Mr. Milledge, one of the committee, and made a donation of to the trustees; and it was called Athene.\"\n\nWhat was the value of this gift of Governor Milledge at the time, we do not know--probably, a thousand or twelve hundred dollars. When the grants by the State were made, there being very much land and very few people in Georgia the 40,000 acres could not have been worth very much. Governor Wilson Lunipkin, in a letter published in 1859, said that his father was the grantee of a large tract of land in the middle part of the State; and in 1783, sold 400 acres for a rifle and another tract of 400 acres for a saddle horse. If this be taken as a criterion, the munificent gift of the State when the grant was made, was worth about fifty rifles and as many saddle horses, from which, however, twelve horses\n\n12\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nshould be deducted for the 5,000 acres lost in the adjust\n\nment of the South Carolina line. But coming out of the war of the Revolution, her people\n\nimpoverished, her commerce destroyed, her resources limited, the State had nothing else but land, and such as she had she freely gave. And though valueless, it may be, then, the lands afterwards yielded the University a permanent fund of one hundred thousand dollars, while the generosity of Governor Milledge brought her, first and last, thirty thousand dollars, and sustained her at sundry times when in dire distress. In recognition of her obligation to him, the University has called the chair of ancient languages \"The Milledge Chair of An cient Languages; \" and in other resolutions, from time to time, have the trustees testified their appreciation of the gift.\n\nReference has been made to the loss of 5,000 acres in the State of South Carolina. The line between Georgia and South Carolina was determined td be the northern bank of the Savannah river at high water; and where it forked, the larger of the two streams should be considered a continuation of the Savannah. The Tugalo and the Keowee or Seneca, formed the first fork from its mouth and it became a ques tion which was the larger. It was generally conceded that the Seneca was the principal stream and was therefore con sidered the boundary line between the States.\n\nThe lands between the rivers belonged then to Georgia, a part of which was the tract granted to the University, con taining 5,000 acres, both fertile and valuable. Subsequent surveys, pretending to be more carefully made, determined that the Tugalo was the larger stream and that became the boundary line, thereby taking from the University her valu able lands. A committee of the trustees was appointed to ascertain and report the facts in connection with the loss of this tract. They reported that the tract was conceded to the State of South Carolina under the treaty of Beaufort, dated April 28, 1787; one of the clauses of which declared void all grants under the State of Georgia which were not registered in the State of South Carolina within twelve months from the date of the treaty. This treaty was rati-\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\nIS\n\nfied by the State of South Carolina on the 29th day of Feb ruary, 1788, but such ratification wasnot communicated to the Governor of Georgia until May 26, 1788. The grant for the tract of land in question was sent to the proper office in South Carolina to be registered immediately after the re ception of such communication, but it was not recorded.\n\n.The committee held that the treaty did not begin to oper ate until after the exchange of ratifications between the two States, and that the grant was presented for enrolment in ample time.\n\nThey also held that the tract was the property of the Uni versity prior to the treaty of Beaufort, and no power was vested in the commissioners of Georgia to transfer its prop erty to any person whatsoever. The tract was at the time, (1799) reported to be settled by claimants under the State of South Carolina.\n\nThe trustees made every effort to retain their possession, employing lawyers to prosecute their claims before the Leg islature of South Carolina and in the United States Circuit Court, and appointing Thomas Peter Carnes, one of their number, a- commissioner, it is supposed, to lobby. Having spent about seven hundred dollars in this case, every effort to establish their title or effect a compromise having failed, after eight or ten years, the board abandoned the whole matter.\n\nThe year prior to the selection of a site for the college, to-wit, in November, 1800, Abram Baldwin, who had been a tutor at Yale College before his removal to Georgia, re commended for Professor of mathematics, Josiah Meigs, of Connecticut, whom he had favorably known as a scholar and a successful teacher.\n\nMr. Meigs was accordingly appointed \"upon examination\" (we suppose on probation) at a salary of fifteen hundred dollars and four hundred dollars to pay the expenses of re moval to Athens. The following year, upon his arrival and introduction to the trustees, Mr. Baldwin resigned the pres idency and Mr. Meigs was elected in his stead. The trustees directed Mr. Meigs to erect one or more log buildings for the\n\n14\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\ncollege, and requested him to teach until enough students should attend to authorize the employment of a tutor.\n\nThe surroundings were unpromising, but nothing daunted, President Meigs set to -work with zeal and vigor to organ ize a school in the woods.\n\nHe had a clearing made for the campus, a street was laid out, lots were staked off and a town projected. Several citizens from other parts of the State, among them the Rev. Hope Hull, came with their families and settled in the village.\n\nThe Augusta Chronicle thus describes .the place in 1802: \"The river at Athens is about 150 feet broad; its waters rapid in their descent and has no low grounds. The site of the University is on the south (?) side and half a mile from the river. About 200 yards from the site and 300 feet above the river, in the midst of an extensive bed of rock, issues a copious spring of excellent water, and in its meanderings to the river several others are discovered. On the place is a new, well-built frame dwelling house, entirely equal to the accommodation of the president and his family. Thereis also another new house equal to a temporary school-room. The square of the University, containing 36% acres, is laid off so as to comprehend the site, the houses and the spring. A street is laid off on the northern line of the square adjoining a village of lots in that direction. Besides the spring in the square, which is convenient to the village, there is one in the street and another back of the lots. \"Near Athens, Mr. Easley has an excellent flour mill, a saw and common grist mill with intention to add a cotton machine. To drive these, the rapids opposite Athens are slightly dammed, so as the ordinary supply of the river neither increases or diminishes the size of the pond. Besides the lesser fish of fresh waters, the shad, in their season, ascend the river as high as Athens in great perfection.\" In order to begin these improvements a loan of five thou sand dollars was asked of the Legislature, secured by mort gages on the Hancock county lands.\n\nUNIVERSITY OP GEORGIA.\n\n15\n\nMr. James Gunn, of Louisville, at this juncture, generously\n\ngave the University one thousand dollars, which, with a\n\nbalance in hand, made about seven thousand dollars with\n\nwhich to begin operations.\n\nThus re-enforced, the trustees ordered the erection of the\n\nbrick building which still stands, the earliest monument of\n\ntheir efforts, and known to everj' student as \"Old College.\"\n\nThe difficulties of building would now be thought almost\n\ninsurmountable.

Carnes and John Clarke were appointed a \"Prudential Committee\" of the trustees, a standing committee which has continued to the present day. Upon this committee devolved the duty of acting for the board in cases-of emergency and of advising with the president at all times in the interests of the college.\n\nA Grammar School was established too, with Rev. John Hodge as master, who was afterwards for a long time the secretary of the trustees. The grammar school was for many years a valuable adjunct to the college in preparing boys for the higher classes. It was the outcome of President Meigs'complaint that there were so few academies in the State which gave their pupils the preparation necessary for admission to college--a complaint which may with justice be made at the present day. In later years the grammar school became unpopular from a custom of the faculty sen tencing idle and refractory students to \"three months in the grammar school,\" and in 1829 it was discontinued alto gether.\n\nThe first commencement of the college occurred May 31, 1804. The president issued a \"diploma\" to Addin Lewis and others authorizing them to examine the senior class for degrees. Their report was presented to the trustees, who, thereupon directed the president to confer \"the degree of Bachelor of Arts upon Gibson Clarke, Augustin S. Clay ton, ThomasIrwin, Jeptha V.Harris, William H. Jackson, James D. JacVson, James Wayne, Robert Rutherford,Williams Rutherford and William Williamson, alumni of this Univer sity; and that Ebenezer H.

The board then returned to the college, where they declared that they \"have with pleasure and satisfaction beheld the great and rapid improvement in science of the students of the University and felicitate themselves on the prospect of the institution becoming conspicuously and eminently useful to the community.\" These commencement exercises, and so for several years afterwards, were held sub arboribus, in the open air. Dr. Henry Hull has left the following account: \"I have been present at every commencement of the college since 1804, though my memory only reaches back to that of 1806. On this occasion a large crowd of people of all sorts, fromthe country and from towns, male and female, old and young, in every variety of costume, were assembled under a large bush arbor in front of the Old College, supplied with seats made of plank and slabs borrowed for the occasion from Easley's saw mill, resting on blocks or billets of wood which raised them from the ground. The stage for the fac ulty, trustees and speakers was erected at the side of the college building and the speakers when called came out of the door at the east end. The whole was built mainly by the students. The poles and brush for the arbor were grow ing in less than two hundred yards from the place where they were wanted; the cutting and dragging them was a mere frolic, and as 'many hands make light work,' the affair once begun was soon completed. The intelligent portion of the audience were of course interested in the orations; but the greater part looked on in stupid wonder as if on a pageant, understanding about as much of the English as of the Greek and Latin speeches, but all wrapt in profound attention.\" A plat of the town and campus, made by Mr. Meigs and Mr. Hull, by direction of the board, shows at this time but few houses on the college grounds. The Old College, east of that the president's house, a story and a half frame dwelling which was afterward removed .to make room for the brick house now standing; the grammar school near the spot now occupied by Professor Willcox's house, and another\n\nwooden building on the present site of the Phi Kappa hall> the one spoken of in the Chronicle as \"equal to a temporary school-room\"--a single room twenty feet square, with a chim ney at one end, an unglazed window at the other and a doo*~ in each side--these comprised the improvements on the cam pus. No fence enclosed the area, but all was open, while Front street, now known as Broad, was a lane cleared through the woods and doubtless full of stumps.\n\nFRONT\n\nSTREET\n\nStoreI\n\nHotel\n\nSchool House\n\nRev.

Petit de Clairville, professor of French. Mr. Lewis was paid $800, and Monsieur Petit $400 per annum, which sug gests the belief in the board that a Frenchman could exist on one-half of what it took to feed the Yankee.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n21\n\nThe board further unanimously \"resolved that the present collegiate buildings at Athens be hereafter denominated and known by the name of FRANKLIN COLLEGE.\"\n\nThe record shows that on Sunday, July 6, 1806, the board met at 8 o'clock and transacted business, and I note with pleasure that the Rev. Hope Hull was not present.\n\nApplication was made to the Legislature for authority to establish a lottery to raise three thousand dollars for the pur chase of books. The request it seems, was refused--possibly because of the Sunday meeting--for lotteries were not condemred in that day, but on several occasions were legalized by the Legislature as late as 1865. Various donations, how ever, were made from time to time to the library, both in valuable books and in money.\n\nIt was the constant effort of the authorities to add to the .library of the University, and the wisdom of their action is proved by the number of valuable works now on its shelves, many of which cannot be duplicated.\n\nThe necessity for a chapel was growing more and more pressing, but no funds were available for the purpose. In 1808, Hope Hull offered that if the board would give one hundred dollars for a belfry, he would cause to be erected a chapel 40 by 60 and 18 feet high. The offer was accepted and several trustees at once contributed to the chapel fund\". Thomas Flournoy gave $32,GeneralTwiggs, $50, and Peter Randolph, $200.\n\nThe chapel was built on the spot where the present chapel stands and served its purpose for twelve years.\n\n22\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nIV.\n\nReorganization of Board of Trustees--Decline in Attendance--President Meigs' Resignation--Sketch of His Life.\n\n1811. .\n\nIn 1808, the Legislature declared that \"whereas the Board; of Trustees of the University consists of thirteen members,, which is deemed too unwieldly and expensive, vacancies which may occur shall not be filled until the number is re duced to seven.\"\n\nBut apparently the trustees did not die or resign rapidly enough, for by the act of December 16, 1811, the number was. reduced to five and the following persons were appointed: Peter Early, Edward Paine, Stephen Upson, John Griffin, William H. Crawford.\n\nIn 1816 the number was increased under another act by the appointment of David B. Mitchell, Thomas W. P. Charlton Nicholas Ware, Henry Kollock, Augustin S. Cla3^ton, James; Merriwether, James M. Wayne, John Elliott, John A. Cuthbert and George M. Troup. Afterwards Duncan G. Camp bell and Edward Harden were added and the board was authorized to fill its own vacancies.\n\nIn 1808 the board \"learned with sincere regret that the number of students in the college are reduced from thirty to thirteen, and in the grammar school from forty to twentyfive.\" A committee was appointed \"to enquire into thereports which affect the reputation of the president of the college as well as the moral character and discipline of the institution.\" What the result of this inquiry was, is not known, but two years later Mr. Meigs resigned the presi- dency, retaining the professorship of mathematics and nat ural philosophy. For the performance of these duties \"with attention and diligence\" he was to receivethe sum of $1,200 per annum.\n\nUNIVEKSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n23\n\nThis action of the trustees Mr. Meigs seems to have acceded to ex necessitate, but it embittered his relations with them as shown in the following affidavits found re^ corded in the minutes:\n\n\"Hope Hull, one of the members of this board, gives the following information and exhibits the same as charges against Mr. Professor Meigs, which charges should be inquired into by the board, viz.: That to the best of his recollection the day after the adjournment of the board in August last, and at the door of the printing office, he, Mr. Meigs, addressing himself to Mr. Htrll, uttered in substance the following words: 'You have appointed Camp bell your secretary. However, I suppose he will do well enough as a secretary for the TORIES !' Mr. Meigs has further said in the presence of Mr. Hull, that 'the State of Georgia had great reason to thank God for one honest man--Judge Early--if it had not been for him the lands belonging to the institution would have been sold and the money pocketed,' and many other expressions and observations of a similar import, but not now precisely recollected.\n\n\"(Signed) HOPE HULL. \"Sworn to before me, this 8th August, 1811, at Athens.\n\nROBERT WALKER, Judge.\"\n\nAnd the following :\n\n\" In a conversation with Mr. Meigs a few days after the adjournment of the board in August last, upon the subject of the congressional and county elections, he observed in substance as follows : 'You,' ad dressing himelf tome, 'can not think to gain the confidence of the people after your con duct relative to the college lan^s. The facts stated in the piece that appeared in the Express against you last week were furnished by me, and there are other facts which I in tend to communicate. But I cannot so muchblameyou; for you are a tool of other great men.' But for one honest man, or the only honest man among them, the board of trustees would have sold the college lands and would have squan dered the money away to their own uses. They were all a damned pack or band of Tories and speculators, and if they\n\n24.\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nhad have (sic) turned him out of his office, he would have published their villainy and dishonesty to the world and have shown them in their proper colors. They had made him professor of natural philosophy and chemistry and given him a poor pitiful salary of twelve hundred dollars-- damn them--he reckoned they would make him next professor of cabbages and turnips--and much more such conversa tion not now detailed, but the above is the substance of the conversation.\n\n\"(Signed) AUGUSTIN S. CLAYTON. \"Sworn to before me, this 8th August, 181i, at Athens.\n\nROBERT WALKER, Judge.\"\n\nMr. Meigs was given an opportunity for defense against these charges, but whatever he replied it was evidently not satisfactory, for \"having this day heard the defense of Mr. Professor Meigs and the affidavits exhibited in support thereof, and having maturely considered the same together with the charges and proofs exhibited against him, the board are of opinion that he hath been guilty of great mis conduct and ought to be removed from his office. Where upon, resolved, that Josiah Meigs be and he is hereby re moved from the office of professor of mathematics, nat ural philosophy and chemistry in Franklin College.\"\n\nJosiah Meigs, the first active president of the University of Georgia, was a native of Connecticut, the thirteenth child of his parents, born in 1757. His eldest brother, Colonel Return J. Meigs, was a distinguished officer of the Revolu tion and the father of the postmaster-general under Presi dent Monroe.\n\nJosiah Meigs graduated at Yale College at the age of twen ty-one. In 1781, he was appointed tutor of mathematics and natural philosophy and in 1794, professor in the same chair in that institution. In the meantime he was married to Miss Clara Benjamin and removed to Bermuda for the practice of law, a profession for which, however, he seemed to have but little taste. His tenure of office at Yale was brief. The Dwights made a bitter fight on him on account of his \"JefFersonian Democracy'' as we call it now--\"Republicanism 1 ' it was known then--and the trustees relieved him of hischairin 1798\n\nDR. MOSES PR. AI^ONZO CHURCH.\n\nUNIVERSITY OP GEORGIA.\n\n25\n\nUpon his acceptance of the presidency of the University of Georgia, he at once entered with ardor upon the work' and submitted a report to the trustees setting forth his views on the curriculum, the text-books, instruments and library necessary for the equipment of such an institution as was contemplated.\n\nA man of great energy, fearless, honest and pure, he gave all his abilities to the upbuilding of the college. In person he was tall and spare, with blue eyes and florid complexion, blessed with perfect health which was uninterrupted until his last and fatal illness. In manner he was affable and kind, but quickly aroused and especially excitable on the subject of politics. In fact, he suffered for his political views at Athens as he had at Yale, for it was the free expression of his opinions that brought about the immediate causes of his removalfrom the presidency and the loss of his professorship.\n\nLeft stranded by his dismissal, not only poor but in debt, Mr. Meigs remained in Athens until 1812, when Mr. Jefferson, to whom he was well known, secured for him the appointment of surveyor-general, with his office at Cincin nati. Two years later, he was made commissioner of the general land office and removed to Washington, where he lived until his death, which occurred September 4th, 1822. His widow, Dr. Charles D. Meigs, the distinguished physician of Philadelphia, Henry Meigs, a prominent lawyer of New York, and other children survived him. His daughter, Clara, married Mr. John Forsyth, one of Georgia's most honored sons. General M. C. Meigs, quartermaster-general of the United States during the Civil War, was his grandson, and many others of his descendants are now living in New York and Philadelphia.\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nV.\n\nPresident John Brown--His Weak Administration--Dr. Henry Jack son--Suspension of Exercises--Sketch of Dr. Brown.\n\n1811-1816.\n\nUpon the resignation of the presidency by Mr. Meigs, the Rev. Dr. Henry Kollock, of Savannah, was elected to the office, but declined.\n\nRev. Hope Hull, as chairman of the prudential commit tee, was appointed to act as president until the vacancy should be filled.\n\nIn 1811, Rev. John Brown, of Columbia, S. C.,was elected and accepted the appointment.\n\nMr. John R. Goulding, of the same city, was made professor of languages.\n\nDr. Henry Jackson, then a young man not long arrived in Georgia from England, having been recommended by the governor, was employed as an instructor in mathematics, \"for the expenses of his board and lodging until such time as the state of the funds shall authorize a competent salary for his services.\" That time came ere long when Professsor Meigs was removed and Dr. Jackson was appointed to succeed him.\n\nDuring President Brown's administration the fortunes of the college steadily declined. Much was no doubt due to the stringency of the times, the period of the war of 1812 being included in his incumbency. But the lack of discipline and the general laxity of the faculty in the discharge of their duties, brought upon them the censure of the board.\n\nDr. Jackson, who proved to be an able instructor, had gone as charge des affaires under Mr. Crawford, our minis ter to Paris. His place was temporarily filled by Professor William Green. Complaints were made of neglect by bothfaculty and students of the religious exercises of the college; of uncleanly rooms and slovenly habits; and even of offen sive immorality. A student, fearless of the consequences,\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEOEGIA.\n\n27\n\nhad the temerity to publish a libelous paper about the fac ulty, and the laws of the institution -were held in contempt.\n\nThe attendance of students fell off, the income of the col lege diminished, and as a necessary result, salaries were cut down--that of the president to $1,000, of professors to $700 and $600. To meet pressing demands, a loan of $5,000 was negotiated, and an effort was made to raise funds by the sale of lands. Lots in Athens, west of what is no w Lumpkin street were laid off in four-acre sections and offered for sale at a minimum -price of $15 per acre on two years' time.\n\nIn this desperate state of affairs it was thought best to suspend for a time the exercises of the college.\n\nPresident Brown and Professor Green resigned, leaving Mr. Goulding to comprise the faculty. That gentleman, as \"senior professor,\" took charge of the premises, and in the meantime taught a school for his support.\n\nThe fortunes of the college were at the lowest ebb in its. history, and its best friends almost despaired of any revival of prosperity.\n\nJohn Brown was born in County Antrim, Ireland, June 15, 1763, and came with his fathei to America, settling in Chester District, South Carolina. His educational advan tages were very limited, eighteen months covering the period of his schooling, part of which time he was the schoolmate of General Andrew Jackson.\n\nAt sixteen years of age, he volunteered under General Sumter and fought gallantly until the close of the war of the Revolution in the campaigns against Tarleton and Cornwallis.\n\nFeeling called to preach the gospel, Mr. Brown studied theology at Salisbury, N. C., under Dr. McCorkle and was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Concord in 1788.\n\nThe next few years were passed in preaching and Reach ing; then, being called to Waxhaw church, he served as its pastor ten years. Resigning this charge, he again took up the profession of teaching and achieved some literary repu tation. In 1809, he was called to the chair of logic and moral philosophy in South Carolina College, and two years\n\n^o\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nlater was elected president of the University of Georgia, which office he held until 1816.\n\nDr. Brown was distinguished for his great excellence of character, his humility and generosity. He was essentially a, good man. Rev. Dr. Talmadge used to call him \"Our Apostle John.\" He had a vigorous mind and a fine com mand of language, but though a man of great firmness of character,he was defective in some of the essential qualities of a teacher, especially failing both to excite the interest and to hold the attention of his students. Added to this, his want of the executive talent needful in the head of an institu tion of learning, made his administration a signal failure. Conscious himself of this, Dr. Brown resigned the presidency in 18-16, and retired to his home near Athens, where he lived for several years, doing good, and honored of'allmen.\n\nSubsequently, Dr. Brown served for twelve years as pastor of a church in Hancock county, and then removed to Fort Oaines, where he died in 1842, in the eightieth year of his age.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n291\n\nVI.\n\nThe Constitutional Debt of $100,000--Election of President Finley-- Improvements on the Campus--Dr. Finley's Death--Rev. Hope Hull.\n\n1817-1818.\n\nDuring the first thirty years of its corporate existence, the University had sold its lands except in Clarke county and had in hand $150,000 of notes, secured by mortgage, as the proceeds.\n\nUpon the interest collected upon these notes with occa sional encroachments on the principal as it was paid, the in stitution had erected its buildings and paid its current ex penses. There being no regular income, however, upon which it could rely, the Legislature passed the act of Decem ber 15, 1815, authorizing the Governor to advance to the board of trustees, two-thirds the face value of those notes upon their being deposited in the State treasury. No money was to be paid for them, but upon the organization of the Bank of the State of Georgia, the Governor subscribed for one thousand shares for the University of Georgia and upon the surrender of the notes and mortgages, transferred the stock to the trustees.\n\nThe trustees were prohibited by law from selling or other wise disposing of this stock, but the dividends could be used for the various requirements of the University.\n\nThe income from the investment was guaranteed by the State to amount to $8,000 per annum. For several years, during its most successful period, the bank stock paid annu ally ten thousand dollars, but with all other concerns of like character it was lost in the wreck of the Civil War. Despite this, however, the State never repudiated its obligation, but regularly and promptly paid the interest from the treasury.. The constitution of 1877 recognized the debt of one hundred thousand dollars and the annual interest has become a fixed charge upon the State.\n\n30\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nSttch is the history of the eight thousand dollars annuity. With the prospect of a stated income, a reorganization of the college was effected. Dr. Robert Finley,of New Jersey, was elected president and took the oath of office in May, 1817. Professsor Goulding retained his chair; Professor Jackson, having returned from Europe, was at his old post. Mr. James Camak, of Colum bia, S. C., and Mr. Asbury Hull, of Athens, were appointed tutors. The Legislature advanced the board ten thousand dollars on the pledge of its surplus bonds. Thus assisted, the trus tees appropriated une thousand dollars for the library, and made a contract for a home for the president to be built for. eight thousand dollars. This is the brick dwelling east of Old College, which replaced the old frame dwelling. The spirit of improvement defined the limits of the cam pus by. the street on the east leading to the graveyard and that on the west leading to the \"Tanyard Branch.\" A half acre of land was offered gratuitously to any religi ous denomination who should first apply, on condition they build a church thereon. President Finley entered upon his office with zeal and ability. Presiding at the commencement in June, he im pressed the audience with his ease and dignity. It was, however, a commencement only in name--there were in all but twenty-eight students in the college. After the closing exercises, Dr. Finley set out to make a tour of the State in order to become better acquainted with the people and to secure their patronage and their aid in restoring and rebuild ing the institution. In this tour he was remarkably success ful, but his usefulness was suddenly cut short by his un timely death. Returning home in September, he was pros trated with a bilious attack, common at that season, and lingering until October 3d, he sank in death. Robert Finley was born in Princeton, N. J., in the year 1772. His father, James Finley r a Scotchman, was the friend of President Witherspoon of Princeton, and himself a man of great probity of character. Robert Finley was in structed by Mr. Ashbel Green, tutor and afterwards presi-\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n31\n\ndent of the College of New Jersey, and was admitted to the freshman class in that institution in his eleventh year, re ceiving the degree of A. B. when he was sixteen. A youth of grave demeanor and force of character, he was appointed a teacher in the grammar school and at once manifested that peculiar talent for governing boys which made him famous in after years. Some of the pupils in this school, older than Finley, broke out into open rebellion against his authority, but he maintained the discipline of his room at the expense of several suspensions and had no further trouble from that source. At nineteen years of age he was invited to take a school in Charleston, S. C'., where he spent a year, returning to Princeton to accept the appointment of tutor in that college.\n\nIn 1794, Mr. Finley was licensed to preach the gospel by presbytery, and the following year was called to the church at Basking Ridge, N. J. Here he spent almost all the re mainder of his life, preaching and teaching. He conducted one of the best known grammar schools in the country.\n\nIn 1798, he was married to Miss Esther Caldwell, daughter of the \"Fighting Parson of the Revolution.\" With her and their nine children he removed to Georgia in 1817, after he had accepted the invitation of the trustees to preside over the University of Georgia, whose destiny seemed to be hov_ ering between life and death.\n\nDr. Finley was much discouraged upon his arrival at Ath ens, to find the college in such a woeful plight. He found, as he wrote to a friend, \"a new country suffering greatly for want of good mechanics and the comforts of life. The col lege is at its last gasp; the scorn of its enemies and the pity of its friends; forgotten in the public mind, or thought of only to despair of it; neglected and deserted, the buildings nearly in ruins and the trustees doubtful if it can be recov ered.\"\n\nDr. Finley's death, though following close upon so brief a connection with the college, was felt to be a public calamity. The trustees appropriated two hundred dollars to the erec tion of a monument over his grave, and resolved that his sons should be at no charge for their education at Athens.\n\n32\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nThey further ordered the president to make a title to Mrs. Finley to any two lots in the town of Athens she might choose, from the unsold lands of the University.\n\nThe following year, 1818, occurred the death of Rev. Hope Hull. The services of this staunch friend of the Uni versity make him deserving of more than a passing notice. Coming to Athens in 1803, he devoted himself with untiring industry to the material, intellectual and spiritual advance ment of the community, and perhaps no man contributed so much to stamp indelibly upon them the sober and religious character which the town and its vicinity have always borne.\n\nDr. Lovick Pierce said of him : \"He was the founder of Methodism in this section and in the vigor of his man hood his fame was almost world-wide. He used to be known under the coarse but graphic appellation of 'Broad Axe,' an honorary distinction conferred on him because of the mighty power that attended his ministry. My eyes first fell on him as he sat near the pulpit of a small log chapel near Athens, called 'Hull's Meeting House.' The wonderful reports which had reached me made me look upon him rather as an august than a fatherly being. His head was rather above the medium size, his black hair curling, just sprinkled with grey. His face was an exceedingly fine one-- a well-developed forehead, a small, keen blue eye, with a heavy brow, indicative of intense thought. His shoulders were unusually broad and square, his chest wide and his voice full, flexible and capable of every variety of intona tion, from the softest sounds of sympathy and persuasion to the thunder tones of wrath. Many ignorant sinners charged him with having learned their secrets, and using the pulpit to gratify himself in their exposure, and when convinced of their mistake doubted whether he were not a prophet.* His\n\n*A student in the senior class, during a sermon delivered by Mr. Hull in the collegechapel in 1812, was angered by what he believed to be a public exposure of his delinquencies, and afterwards meeting Mr. Hull on the campus, was very rude and insulting to him. The president reported the fact to the board then in session, and an order was passed with holding his degree from the young man, unless he should, in the presence of the trustees, the faculty and the body of students, read and subscribe to a written apology for the offence* This being done, peace reigned, and the degree was conferred-\n\nUNIVERSITY Or GEORGIA.\n\n33\n\noratory -was natural, his action the unaffected expression of his mind. He seemed in some of his finest moods of thought to look his words into you. He was one of na ture's orators. In many of his masterly efforts, his words rushed upon his audience like an avalanche and multitudes seemed to be carried before him like the yielding captives of a stormed castle. Grave and guarded as he was, there were moments when he entertained his friends with the recital of thrilling incidents in his history. He survived until 1818, when he died, saying, 'God has laid me under marching or ders. I am ready to obey.'\"\n\nThe following resolution was entered on the minutes of the trustees: \"The board, entertaining the highest sense of the long, zealous and distinguished usefulness of their fellowmember, the Rev. Hope Hull, and feeling the deepest regret for his loss, most unfeignedly sympathize with his family and friends for their afflictive bereavement, and cheerfully offer this public demonstration of their entire conviction of his worth and services.\"\n\n84\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nVII.\n\nPresident Moses Waddell--Professor James Oamak--Professor James Tinsley--Students Board in Commons--Hew College Built-- Sketch of Campus--Demosthenian and Phi Kappa Societies--Old Graveyard.\n\n1819-1822.\n\nUpon the death of President Finley, Rev. Nathan S. S.. Beman was elected to the vacant office. That gentleman at first accepted, but in deference to the wishes of an invalid wife, afterwards declined the appointment.\n\nThe nomination then, of Rev. Ebenezer Porter of Savan nah, was made, but he, too, declined.\n\nRev. Moses Waddell was next elected president. Mr. Waddell was born in Rowan county, N. C., July 29, 1770. He attended a neighboring school, studying with such diligence, that when he was but fourteen years of age, he was invited to take a school at a little distance from his home, with the stipulated remuneration of seventy dollars a year and his board. In 1786, he came to Greene county, Georgia, with his parents and opened another school. He was quite popu lar with the young people and was invited to all their \"par ties,\" at which dancing was the chief feature of amusement.\n\nMr. Waddell became so fond of this pleasure that his in dulgence in it brought him to the serious reflection that it was harmful. So great was the temptation to him to dance that he finally changed his place of abode, going to the house of a pious gentleman, where he assiduously spent his evenings in the study of the classics. In 1789, he professed conver sion and joined the Presbyterian church.\n\nSubsequently, in view of preparing himself to preach the gospel, he went to Hampden Sidney College, entering the senior class in 1791. For some years after he was licensed, he preached and taught at different places, finally locating at Willington, S. C. In the meantime, he had among his-\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n85\n\npupils, William H. Crawford and John C. Calhoun, men who in after life became the peers of any this country has\n\never produced. Mr. Waddell was married first to a sister of John C. Cal\n\nhotin, who survived her marriage but little more than a year. In 1800, he was married a second time to Miss Eliza Pleas-\n\nants of Virginia. At Willington, Dr. Waddell began a work of education\n\nwhich made him famous throughout the South. The school numbered at its maximum attendance, one hundred and eighty, comprising boys who afterwards became the most distinguished men of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nWhen the University of Georgia was lying prostrate un der the misfortune of President Finley's death, superadded to the distressing condition in which he found it, it was felt that Dr. Waddell was the only man who could undertake its resuscitation with any hope of success.\n\nThe trustees sent him an urgent invitation to assume the presidency. Though very reluctant to face the responsibil ity of such a task, he yielded to the arguments of the com mittee who visited him, and removed to Athens in 1819.\n\nThe reputation of Dr. Waddell, which had preceded him, added to his energy and high character, soon raised the en rollment of students from seven to more than one hundred.\n\nHis discipline was firm without severity and only those who trifled with him felt how severe he could be. No stu dent ever tried it twice, and one having come out from such an interview with him, said to a companion: \"When you hear a boy bragging how he bullied Dr. Waddell, you may know he is lying, for it can't be done.\"\n\nBut with all his firmness, Dr. Waddell had the tact to know when not to punish. One night he caught, as hebelievedvNed B---- playing cards. The next morning, overtaking him on the campus, the doctor said: \"Edward, I think I saw you playing cards last night.\" \"I reckon riot, sir,\" said the culprit. \"Yes, I am sure it was you,\" replied the doctor. \"It couldn't have been me,\" answered Ned, \"because I don't know the ace of jacks from the nine of deuces.\" Dr. Waddell smiled, but did not press the matter any further.\n\n36\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nWith Dr. Waddell's accession, Professor Camak retired from the faculty, and Dr. Alonzo Church, then teaching in Eatonton, Ga., was elected to the chair of mathematics.\n\nMr. Camak was a native of South Carolina. He was a professor in this University when Dr. Finley came to Geor gia, and after his resignation, was married to Miss Helen Finley, a daughter of the late president. Removing to Milledgeville. Mr. Camak engaged in business and was made cashier of the Central Bank. He acquired a fine property there and afterwards moved back to Athens where he dur ing his lifetime, and his family long afterwar'ds, were among the most prominent citizens of the place.\n\nUpon the resignation of Dr. Henry Jackson in 1820, Dr. James Tinsley was appointed professor of natural philoso phy. Dr. Tinsley had been a pupil of Dr. Waddell at Willington. He studied medicine and was admitted to practice, but being very erratic, he defied both the conventional rules of society and the ethics of practice. He was a man of re markable physical strength, though his weight never ex ceeded one hundred and sixty pounds. Dr. Tinsley was sub ject to violent and alarming hemorrhages from the lungs, and on account of this one weakness he exposed himself to the most inclement weather without overcoat or umbrella, with the collar and bosom of his shirt open and often with out a hat, in order to \"harden\" himself. He never kept any medicines, depending upon what he might find in the house of his patient, and his surgical operations were performed ;with whatever was convenient at hand.\n\nDr. Tinsley had no fitness either .by nature or education for the position to which he was elected, but his friends thought that the power of his intellect would overcome his want of training and enable him to sustain himself. Their mistake was soon apparent, and after two years of irksome, restraint, he resigned.\n\nThe problem of the disposition of the students had longexercised the faculty and trustees. At first they boarded anywhere in the neighborhood ofthe college; then they were required to room in the Old College. Later, by an act of the Legislature, they were permitted to \"board at any place\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n37\n\nwithin the town or vicinity of Athens, provided, they board with moral, respectable families, of which the president of the college shall judge.\" Then Commons were provided, a steward's hall established and maintained for a dozen or more years. By resolution of the trustees in 1820, the quality of board required was: \"For breakfast, a sufficiency -of^holesome cold meat with wheaten flour biscuit or loaf bread> butter, tea or coffee. For dinner, a course of bacon or salted beef, with a suitable proportion of corn bread and at least two kinds of vegetables, and on Wednesday, to have an after course of pies, puddings or pancakes. For each supper, a plentiful supply of tea or milk, with a sufficiency of wheaten flour biscuit and butter.\" Truly a substantial bill of fare and not open to the charge of extravagance.\n\nThe board also declared that \" students on Sabbath after noons must confine their walks to one mile, provided, this healthful and innocent indulgence is executed free from any violation of the laws of the college.\"\n\nIn 1822, a contract was let for the building of \"New Colege\" at $24,980 to John R. Goulding, quondam professor, and Thomas Moore. The Philosophical Hall had been com pleted a year before and was used for the college chapel. In the second story, the library was arranged, aud there the trustees held their meetings. There is a resolution extant, passed about this time, requesting the president to procure some more comfortable seats for the use of the board, which suggests visions of old split-bottom chairs and hard wooden benches on which were seated those grave and reverend seign iors.\n\nAfter the completion of New College in 182-3, the li brary and apparatus were transferred to that building.\n\n38\n\nFRONT\n\nSTREET\n\nPresbyterian ^^H Church Grammar School\n\nPrinting- Office and Demosthenian\n\nHall\n\nWooden Chapel\n\nI New College\n\nPresident's House\n\nOld College Chapel\n\nSteward's Hall\n\nard\n\nTHE CAMPUS IN 1821.\n\nWhile we are upon the subject of buildings, it may be said that the Demosthenian Society, which was organized in 1803. and had for twenty years been holding its meetings in the old school-room, now being in a flourishing condition, both as to members and funds, built the hall north of the chapel which for seventy years has echoed the clarion tones of im passioned speakers. A new stimulus was given this old mother of debaters by the organization of a rival, the Phi Kappa Society, by Joseph Henry Lumpkin in 1825. For many years these two vied with each other for the honors of the college, and swore their members with great and in violable oaths to secrets which might not even be thought of in the presence of another.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n39\n\nIn 1824, the Old College walls gave indications of weakness and were strengthened by the iron bars which have no doubt aroused the curiosity of many a student.\n\nThe campus, which seems to have been open at the time, was ordered to be closed \"with posts and plank in front, and common rails with stakes and riders on the other sides.\"\n\nInterment of corpses on the college hill, where persons had been in the habit of interring them, was prohibited in future, but the commissioners of the town of Athens were permitted and authorized to inclose a piece of ground not exceeding one acre as a burial ground.\n\nThe place of interments referred to, is now covered by the houses east of the campus, and the \"burial ground\" of one acre a little farther south, filled with the dead of a third of a century, still lies with its tall pines standing sentinel over its graves.\n\n40\n\nHISTOBICAL SKETCH\n\nVIII.\n\nDr. Waddell's Administration--Penalties--Militia Service--Professor Olds--Dr. Henry Jackson--Rev. Stephen Olin, D. D.\n\n1823.\n\nDr. Waddell's entire administration was one of strength and success. The college grew in influence and in public fa vor. The trustees gave their cordial support to the presi dent, who on his part, seemed to haveno other desire than to raise the institution which had been confided to his care, to the highest standard of morality and scholarship. In thi& he succeeded beyond the expectations of the most sanguine From theplane to which Dr. Waddell raised it, the University has never receded, and when the times and the circumstances, of the people are considered, it was hardly possible for any man to have done more.\n\nHis discipline was never relaxed. To the students he was kind, but always firm. He commanded their respect and de manded their obedience.\n\nThere were dissensions in the faculty--as will always be-- and there were resignations and re-elections, and complaintsand lawlessness among the students; but the policy of the president never wavered. The universal regret of trustees, faculty, students and citizens at his resignation attested their endorsement of his course. During Dr. Waddell's ten ure of office, the minimum age .of admission of students was fixed at thirteen for the freshman, fourteen for the sopho more, fifteen for the junior and sixteen for the senior class.\n\nIt was said that the president advocated administering discipline by flogging to the freshmen and sophomores, but the board thought that mode of punishment incompatible with the dignity of a great university. In deference to his. opinions, however, the faculty were authorized to remand refractory students to the grammar school, where the principal, Mr. Moses W. Dobbins, a nephew and namesake\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,\n\n41\n\nof the president, wielded the birch with skill and liberality. A student would submit to anything short of expulsion rather than be sentenced to the grammar school.\n\nA law was passed at one time that \"no student of the grammar school should engage in any dramatic perform ance in the town of Athens, either in term time or vacation.\"\n\nvVe do not know whether the board disapproved of theat ricals on moral and religious grounds, or whether the histri onic talent of the youths was at so low an ebb as to dis courage any hope of improvement. Under the laws of that day, students were subject to militia duty. They organized a company among thenlselves and made a great frolic of the whole affair. \"Muster day\" proved at last so disastrous to study and good order, that the governor was appealed to to withdraw the arms which had been furnished them.\n\nThe faculty being required to be at their recitation rooms during study hours attending to the behavior of the stu dents, Dr. Henry Jackson, who had succeeded Dr. Tinsley in his old chair, resigned a second time because he was unwilling to do police duty on the campus.\n\nGamaliel S. Olds, of Massachusetts, was elected in his place, who, in the brief space of one year, proved his utter unfitness for the position. Upon his retirement, Dr. Jack son was recalled and served until his final resignation in 1827.\n\nDr. Henry Jackson, a native of England, came to Georgia a youth, not long before the close of the last century, at the invitation of his brother, James Jackson, once governor of Georgia. Elected to a professorship in the University in 1811, he proved to be a valuable acquisition to the faculty, a scholar of great scientific attainments and a gentleman of many fine traits of character. When the Hon. William H. Crawford went as minister to the court of France, Dr. Jack son was invited to go with him as secretary of legation. Obtaining leave of absence from* the trustees, he went to Fiance and was in Paris during the \"hundred days reign\" after Napoleon's return from Elba.\n\nWhile passing through Washington on his wary abroad, he met a lady to whom he was singularly attracted, but the\n\n42\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nfact of her husband being very much alive was an insuper able objection to his making it known to her. On his return from Europe, he heard that she was a widow and so soon as propriety permitted, he paid her his addresses and was married to her. The lady was the widow of Ho well Cobb, a member of congress from Georgia and uncle to Governor Ho well Cobb.\n\nDr. Jackson was a conscientious teacher and was much ad mired by the students who were under his instruction. He passed his latter days at \"Halscot,\" his home near Athens, where he was wont to receive and entertain his friends Taoth young and old. His son, General Henry R. Jackson, is a distinguished citizen of this State.\n\nRev. Stephen Olin was a native of Vermont, and a class mate of Professor Alonzo Church, and through his efforts was invited to take the chair of belles-lettres and ethics, then newly established.\n\nDr. Olin had taught for several years, in South Carolina and lived for a time in Charleston. He was a man of im mense frame, tall and muscular, with large grey eyes and a magnificent head. He was unsurpassed as a teacher and ex erted great influence over the students. One of the students once asked another why he always recited well to Dr. Olin while he neglected his other studies so shamefully. \"Well/' said he, \"I can't stand the look of those eyes when I miss.\"\n\nAs a preacher he was gifted, in a remarkable degree, elo quent in delivery and great in thought. When he delivered his first sermon in Athens, Dr. Church asked Dr. Waddell what he thought of him. \"While he was speaking,\"said he, *'I thought anybody could preach as well; but after he had finished, I thought no one could preach so well.\"\n\nDr. Olin's health failed and he was forced to resign. He was recalled three years later, but again resigned, having served four years as professor here. Subsequently he trav eled extensively abroad, was elected president of Randolph Macon College in Virginia, and afterwards president of Wesleyan University, Connecticut, where he remained until his death.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n43\n\nIX.\n\nProfessor James Jackson--The Tariff--Presbyterian and Baptist Churches--Robert Toombs--Dr, Waddell's Resignation and Death.\n\n1824-1829.\n\nAnother well known member of the faculty tinder Dr. Waddell, was Professor James Jackson,electedinl823to the chair of chemistry and French. He was a son of Governor James Jackson and a member of the first graduating class of the University. He was generally known as \"Major\" Jackson and among the students as \"Old Take and Take\" from an expression that he used in the class-room until it became fixed upon him.\n\nHe was a most^ amiable man and the boys teased him with impunity. On one occasion a student who had some talent as a draughtsman, drew on the wall outside his recitation room, a monkey with the features of Major Jackson. Nat urally, he was very much irritated when he saw it and at once recognized the artist by his skill in drawing. The offen der was reported to the faculty and summoned to appear and make his defence. The accused, on hearing the charge, frankly admitted that he drew the monkey, but denied that he intended it for the professor. \"You lie, sir!\" said the infuriated major. \"You did intend it forme, for it is exactly like me.\" The absurdity of the situation was too much for the faculty, and the culprit was dismissed with the verdict not proven.\n\nMajor Jackson was a favorite with the students and dere lict boys looked upon him as their best advocate before the faculty. A kind-hearted man, a thorough gentleman and an earnest Christian, his tenure of office extended over twentyseven years, a longer period than any officer of the college had ever held his chair.\n\nIn 1827, the tariff\" was the all-absorbing political question of the day. In the board, Major Merriwether put himself on\n\n44\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nrecord by a proposition to adopt a uniform of domestic homespun for the students. The students, full of patriotic zeal, held a mass meeting and resolved to wear only home made goods. The trustees met them more than half way in adopting as the prescribed uniform for students, \"a frockcoat made of dark grey Georgia homespun, wool and cot ton, the seams covered with black silk cord or narrow braid, black buttons and pantaloons of same material, corded or braided in the same manner.\" An exception was made in favor of calico, for the reason that \"morning gowns\" of calico were quite fashionable, both students and professors wearing them on the streets. This garment-- which must have been a marvel to behold--consisted of two widths of calico gathered at the neck with a string, buttoned at the waist and reaching to the ankles, having loose, flow ing sleeves. The figure and color was left to the taste of the wearer, and there was as great a variety as can be seen at a county fair. Fancy the Chancellor of the University or the dignified Dean of the Faculty sailing down the street in a flowered calico morning gown!\n\nWith the reality of wearing the homespun, came a cooling of patriotic fervor and a petition went up from the boys to repeal the law, which, it seems, was cheerfully done .\n\nThe Presbyterian congregation which Dr. Waddell had org*anized, by permission of the board, built a house of wor ship on the campus, where the library building now stands. The door was towards the chapel and the high pulpit and the galleries around the sides are doubtless still fresh in the memories of old students.\n\nDr. Waddell ministered to this church until he left AthensThe Baptists also built a church on the northwest corner of the campus a few years later, in which Mr. Shannon preached, and afterwards, Dr. Brantly. Both these churches stood until about 1857, when the first was torn down and the other burned by an incendiary.\n\nSome of the most distinguished men of the country passed out of the University as pupils of Dr. Waddell. Eugenius A. Nisbet, George F. Pierce, John A. Campbell, Paul F. Eve, Nathaniel M. Crawford, Robert Toombs, John N.\n\n;\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n45\n\nWaddell, Charles J. Jenkins and many others of lesser note^ but of wide reputation in their own States, received the im press of his character while under his instruction at Athens.\n\nA stbry of Robert Toombs has swung round the circle of the papers of late years, which represents him expelled from college for gambling, standing beneath the old oak in front of the chapel at commencement, pouring forth such burning words of eloquence that the chapel is deserted and the speakers left to declaim to empty benches. And from this circumstance, the old tree has ever since been known as .the \"Toombs Oak.\" It has even been said that on the day of Mr. Toombs' death, the old oak was struck by lightning and destroyed.\n\nThere is not the semblance of truth in the story. It was a fabrication of Henry W. Grady, who, in an admiring sketch of the great Georgian, wrote charmingly of his overwhelm ing eloquence and pointed it with a story drawn from his own vivid imagination.\n\nThe facts of Robert Toombs' dismissal from college are of interest because of his own prominence in after life. They are taken from the record and are as follows:\n\n\"R. Toombs called J. H. a shameful name, which he ac knowledged to the faculty, and the said H. attacked him and beat him on Friday night. Toombs went to H.'s room with bowie knife and pistol, threw the knife at G. H. and pointed the pistol at J. H., which another student wrested from him. Afterwards Toombs attacked J. H. with a knife and hatchet, but students interfered, preventing in jury. Saturday morning, Toombs waylaid the H's. on their return to college, attacking J. H. with a club and pistol.\" .\n\nUpon his trial before the faculty, the facts being stated and not denied by him, Mr. Toombs was dismissed from col lege. At the following meeting of the faculty a letter from Toombs was read, acknowledging the impropriety of his con duct. Accompanying the letter were petitions from the Demosthenian and Phi Kappa societies asking, if not a re mission, at least a mitigation of the punishment. After due consideration, the faculty remitted entirely the sentence, but put him on probation for the remainder of the term. Subse-\n\n46\n\nquently---at the close of the term--Toombs withdrew from college and went to Virginia.\n\nIn 1829, Dr. Waddell sent in his resignation to the trustees. Efforts were made to induce him to withdraw it, but his determination was taken. Arrangements were made for suitable ceremonies of a public and final leave-taking at the close of the commencement exercises, and on the day of his departure from home, the faculty and students marched to his house in a body to bid him farewell.\n\nDr. Waddell went from Athens to Willington, where, with his son, James, he reorganized his old academy. His own time was chiefly occupied in preaching in the neighborhood. In 1836, he was stricken with paralysis from which he never recovered. Lingering nearly four years, almost helpless, he died July 21, 1840, at the home of his son in Athens, to which place he had been removed.\n\n'UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n47\n\n*\n\nX.\n\nPresident Alonzo Church--Loss by Fire of New College--Loan by Legis lature--Ivy Building--Botanical Garden--Professor M. A. Ward-- Professor William Lehmann,\n\n1829-1830.\n\nAlonzo Church, then professor of mathematics, was elected to succeed President Waddell.\n\nDr. Church was a native of Vermont and a graduate of Middlebury College. So<5n after his graduation he went to Eatonton, Georgia, to take charge of the academy at that place. He there met and married Miss Sarah Trippe, a lady of superior accomplishments and rare beauty. Coming to Athens in 1819, as professor of mathematics, Dr. Church conducted his department with eminent suc cess and so impressed the board by his force of character, that upon the retirement of President Waddell, he was at once unanimously chosen in his place.\n\nIn person, Dr. Church was tall and well-proportioned, of dark complexion, with lustrous black eyes and hair, graceful in carriage and dignified in bearing. He was of a quick tem per and absolutely fearless, but had great self-control. Well behaved students had respect and aifection for him, but the disorderly feared and avoided him more than any other member of the faculty. He was a rigid disciplinarian, prompt to correct and rebuke the slightest indication of disorder or inattention in his class-room; and yet in his kindness of heart, he would help along an ill-prepared student almost to the extent of reciting the lesson for him.\n\nAn incident related by Dr. John N. Waddell illustrates the promptness of Dr. Church to quell any disorder and the fear among the students of his displeasure.\n\n\"On the news of the birth of his son being learned by the students, a petition was presented to the faculty for holiday in compliment to the family and as a welcome to the advent of the young stranger. Just before eleven o'clock >\n\n48\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nthe hour of morning recitation, the petition was returned, having been granted. It so happened that just then were gathered in the room above Dr. Church's study, some dozen of the most orderly students preparing for the recitation. On learning the decision of the faculty, the news was re ceived with most exuberant joy and boisterous laughter. In a few minutes, to their utter discomfiture, Dr. Church ap peared, and on discovering who it was that was making such a disturbance, lifted his hands, exclaiming, \"Why, gen tlemen, I am more than astonished!\" The students had only time to say, ''Doctor, we have holiday,\" when he left them abruptly, and they expected nothing less than a sum mons before the faculty on the charge of disorderly conduct. But when the doctor, on going out to inquire the cause of the holiday, learned that it was on the occasion of the birth of his son, he returned immediately to the students, ex plained and apologized. Thus Alonzo W. Churqh was greeted on his arrival with a demonstration not usual among in fants in Athens.\"\n\nIt was the custom in that day to hold morning and even ing prayers in the chapel. Dr. Church always lead the even ing service, and it was expected that some other member of the faculty would conduct that of the morning. One morn ing the students were so disorderly that Professor Ward went after the president. Seeing him walking across the campus, the professor called to him, \"Oh, doctor, come here. We can do nothing with the students.\" ' Dr. Church walked at once into the chapel and looked around without speak ing a word. Death-like silence ensued. Taking up the Bi ble, he read a chapter, offered a prayer and without another word dismissed the students, who quietly made their exit. As an example of the discipline President Church exercised, may be mentioned the expulsion of eleven students in a bunch for riotous conduct on the campus one night. One of the condemned was Howell Cobb, who was reinstated upon the solemn declaration of -his mother that she had madehim retire and had afterwards seen him asleep in bed on the very night of the riot. Others who saw him on the campus, without disputing Mrs. Cobb's statement, suggested that\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n49\n\nhe might have dressed and slipped out of the window after his mother's visit to his room.\n\nDr. Church's family were remarkable for their personal beauty. He and Mrs. Church were a singularly handsome pair; his sons were all handsome men and the daughters were the toasts of every student of their time. Especially beautiful were Miss Julia and Miss Lizzie, afterwards Mrs. Croom and Mrs. Craig, and there no doubt lingers yet in the memory of many an old student of the forties, delightful recollections of evenings passed in their parlors. To the unremitting ministrations of Mrs. Craig, then Mrs. Robbe, many a sick and wounded Confederate prisoner during the war, owed such cheer and comfort as she was permitted to extend them.\n\nThe chair of mathematics becoming vacant by the promo tion of the incumbent to the presidency, Mr. George W. McGehee, of Tennessee, was appointed to the vacancy, .but on his way to assume its duties, was taken violently ill and died before reaching Athens. At their next meeting the board elected one of their own number, Dr. Henry Hull, professor of mathematics.\n\nJames P. Waddell, son of the late president, was elected pro fessor of languages, but declined, and Rev. James Shannon, of Augusta, was then appointed and held the office until 1836.\n\nDr. Olin having resigned, Rev.--afterwards Bishop--William Capers, of Charleston, was nominated, and he having de clined, the professorship of belles-letters and ethics was va cant until 1830, when Dr. Olin re-entered the faculty for a brief term of three years.\n\nIn 1830, the University sustained a serious loss in the de struction by fire of the New College, with the library, now a most valuable one, and all the scientific apparatus.\n\nIt was supposed to have caught in one of the dormitory rooms, and there being no means whatever in the town for extinguishing fires, it was a total loss excepting the walls.\n\nThere was nothing to be done but appeal to the State for help.\n\n50\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nThe Senattis Academicus sent up a memorial to the Legisla ture setting forth the fact that the forty thousand dollars of surplus bonds and mortgages deposited in the treasury in 1816 against the issue of one thousand shares of bank stock,, had been collected and covered into the treastKy to the credit of the State. In behalf of the University the Senatus asked that this sum be turned over to the trustees to be used in rebuilding the college, in purchasing new ap paratus and instruments, in refurnishing a librae and for 1 other wants of the institution. In response to this request the General Assembly appropriated six thousand dollars an nually from 1830 to 1841, and in addition thereto for im mediate use, loaned to the University ten thousand dollars' which was afterwards repaid in annual payments of one thousand dollars. With these funds the burned building was rebuilt at the cost of $12,349. The present chapel was erected on the site of the old 40x60 wooden one of 1808; the \"Ivy Building\" was built for a new library and cabinet of minerals; two new chairs were established--natural philosophy and modern languages--and a botanical garden was planned and planted under the care of John Bishop, gardener from England.\n\nDr. Malthus A. Ward of Salern, Mass., and Professor Wil liam Lehmann, a native of Germany, and a minister of the Lutheran church, were elected to the new departments.\n\nDr. Ward was a gentleman of fine education and an en thusiastic botanist. He laid out and planted the botanical garden, which became his especial hobby. Many an hour in that delightful resort of former days have students and townsmen whiled away, enjoying the dolce farniente under the willows from St. Helena, or stretched beside the little lake, or strolling along the shaded walks. That charming re treat, hallowed by many a whispered confession and bright ened by many a blushing admission, fragrant with flowers* tinted with the sunset's gold, and musical with the thrush and mocking bird, is now, alas! the washing-ground of the loud-mouthed colored laundress; and a few old cedars, a broken hedge of osage orange, a poplar, and mayhap, a wil low, are the sole relics of its ancient beauty.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n51\n\nNo one who ever saw Dr. Ward could forget him. Tall, thin and awkward, every handsome feature conspicuous by its absence, his appearance hardly failed to excite a smile; but a gentler, kindlier man never lived. In a recitation in botany, the professor asked a student how many species of a certain plant there were. The young man replied at a venture, \"Three, sir.\" \"Yes, yes,\" said the doctor, \"but there were formerly only two; and the same now is.\" The quaintness of his expressions seemed to impress his lectures on the students. He once said, \"Words, young gentlemen, are only pegs on which to hang our ideas.\" This struck the boys' fancy and ever afterwards the old professor was known as \"Dr. Pegs.\"\n\nAfter his connection with the college ceased, Dr. Ward lived for many years and until his death, at his home oh the hill beyond the branch, amid the flowers and fruits and many varieties of ornamental trees he had planted j-ears before.\n\nWilliam Lehmann, a German by birth, was a man of fine attainments. He was a good English scholar, a thoroughly competent linguist and an enthusiast in the ancient classics. It was a saying of the boys that when Professor Lehmann should reach the spirit world, the first question he would ask, would be, \"Where is Homer? I want to see him I\"\n\nMr. Lehmann was an excellent musician and a fine pian ist. On one occasion while visiting the dormitory rooms, he came upon a student playing the violin in study hours. At his citation, the delinquent appeared before the faculty and plead guilty. Some one proposed to fine the boy as a pen alty, when Mr. Lehmann seconded the motion, saying, \"Yes, Mr. President, fine him; hedo play so bad.\" Tall, of stal wart frame, and quite bald, Mr. Lehmann was an imposing man in appearance, but far too lenient with the students, who took advantage of his good nature and imposed upon him continually.\n\nBoth these gentlemen served the University faithfully until 1841, when the state of its finances demanded their retirement.\n\n52\n\nHISTOKICAL SKETCH\n\nXI.\n\nTroup and Clarke Parties--Board of Trustees Increased--Board of Visitors--Dr. Samuel P. Pressley--Professor Shannon--Professor James P. Waddell--Outrage on Professor McOay--Challenge to a Duel--Sketch of Mr. McOay. '\n\n1830-1840.\n\nDuring the intense political excitement between the Clarke\n\nand Troup parties, which perhaps was not surpassed by the\n\nantagonism of the Democrats to the Republicans in the hot\n\ntest days of reconstruction, serious complaints were made\n\nby the Clarke party of the vicious influence of the University.\n\nIt was charged that the trustees were all Troup men and\n\nthat only Troup men were put in the faculty, and worse\n\nthan all, that their boys went to college and came home im\n\nbued with the damnable heresies of the Troup party, and\n\nforsaking the principles of their fathers, deserted to the\n\nranks of the enemy.\n\n'\n\nThis was too grave a charge to be ignored. Consequently,\n\nin 1830, the Legislature enacted a law increasing the num\n\nber of trustees to twenty-eight, giving an equal representa\n\ntion on the board to the two political factions.\n\nThe new trustees appointed under this act were Ho well\n\nCobb, Daniel Hood, Angus McD. King, Wilson Lumpkin,\n\nThomas W. Murray, David A. Reese, James Tinsley, Stevens\n\nThomas, James C. Watson, Zachariah Williams, and Jacob\n\nWood.\n\nIn that day, far more than now, the young men of .Georgia\n\nwere deeply interested in the great questions which agitated\n\nthe country. It was no uncommon thing for a party of\n\nstudents to leave college to go to Watkinsville or Lexington,\n\nor some other neighboring town to hear Mr. Crawford or\n\nMr. Berrien, or Mr. Toombs or Mr. Stephens speak on the\n\nissues before the people, and on their return take their pun\n\nishment as became men.\n\n-UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.\n\n53\n\nFired with the enthusiasm of yonth, some did not hesitate to attack the opposite party in their college speeches. At the first meeting of the board after its increase, a resolution was passed requiring the faculty to exclude from the productions of the students at commencement, all political matter involving the party politics of the day. This, however, was a ghost that would not down at their bidding; for, from time to time, resolutions were adopted reiterating the opinion of the board that political speeches should not be permitted on the stage of the Univer sity. Doubtless it was a proper inhibition and the party attacked keenly felt its necessity; but, the other side secretly enjoyed the situation none the less. Indeed, it was due to this fact that the students dared to hand in one speech to the faculty and speak another on the stage, feeling sure of the support of his own side if the worst came.\n\nAt the request of the trustees in 1830, the Senatus Academicus appointed annually fifteen persons as a Board of Visitors to attend the examinations of the students preceding commencement and report to that body. The appointment of this board after the abolition of the Senatus Academicus was delegated to the Governor, and their powers were en larged.\n\nIt may be gravely doubted, however, if any practical good has ever resulted from their visitations. This is not necessa rily the fault of the gentlemen composing the board of visi tors. From the very nature of things, a committee of strangers cannot enter upon the premises of a college, take up its curriculum, inspect its class work, read its examina tion papers and investigate its internal workings, and learn enough about the institution in a week's time to report, with suggestions of any value, upon its faults or its necessities. Yet, year after year, the State pays the expenses of gentle men who faithfully, it is conceded, perform this duty and render their report to the Governor, which is acknowledged and duly filed away with other State papers.\n\nUpon the second resignation of Dr. Olin, Rev. Samuel . Pressley was elected professor of metaphysics.\n\n54\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\n\nIn 1836, Professor Shannon resigned. He was a man of great independence of thought. He declined the honorary degree of D. D., conferred upon him by the University, be cause he said a literary institution had no right to judge of the theological standing of a minister of the gospel--a thing of which it could know nothing. Mrs. Shannon was Meth odist ; he a Baptist. When it was suggested that Mrs. Shan non should join his church to be with him, he said he would vote against receiving her unless she sincerely believed in the doctrines of his church, and he didn't think she did.\n\nAfter Mr. Shannon's resignation, he was elected president of a college in Missouri, and removed to that State where he spent the remainder of his life.\n\nMr. Shannon was succeeded by Mr. James P. Waddell. Professor Waddell, known among the boys as \"Old Pute,\" was- a ripe classical scholar and a poet of merit. He had,, after his graduation, served as tutor in the University for two years, and marrying a daughter of Rev. Hope Hull> went to Willington to reopen the academy there with his father.\n\nProfessor Waddell had been elected to the chair of ancient languages in 1830. At that time no little excitement pre vailed throughout the State among the various Christian de nominations on the .subject of education, and some jealousy of the University was developed. It \"was charged that a monopoly of offices in the faculty was enjoyed by one de nomination. The administration of the affairs of the Uni versity had, in fact, been'in the hands of Presbyterian presi dents from its foundation. With perhaps one exception, the most important chairs had been filled by Presbyterians. It is absurd to suppose that this was due to any partiality for that denomination in a board of trustees, the majority of whom were not Pres"
