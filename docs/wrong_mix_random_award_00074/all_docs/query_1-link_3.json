        "text": "County in South Carolina, United States\n\nCounty in South Carolina\n\nBarnwell County is a county in the U.S. state of South Carolina. As of the 2020 census, its population was 20,589.[1] It is located in the Central Savannah River Area. Its county seat is Barnwell.[2]\n\nThe Barnwell District was created in 1797 (effective in 1800) from the southwestern portion of the Orangeburg District, along the Savannah River.[3] It was named after John Barnwell, a local figure in the Revolutionary War.[4]\n\nIn 1868, under the South Carolina Constitution revised during Reconstruction, South Carolina districts became counties. The government was made more democratic, with county officials to be elected by male citizens at least 21 years old,[5] rather than by the state legislature as done previously.\n\nIn 1871, the legislature took the northwestern portion of the county to form part of the new Aiken County, the only county organized during the Reconstruction era. In 1874, the border with Aiken County was slightly adjusted. Aiken and Barnwell, with nearly equal, populations of black and white people, had extensive violence in the months before the 1874 and 1876 elections, as groups of paramilitary Red Shirts rode to disrupt black Republican meetings and intimidate voters to suppress black voting. More than 100 black men were killed in Aiken County during the violence, especially at Ellenton, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1895, white Democrats in the state legislature passed a new constitution, disfranchising most blacks for more than 60 years by raising barriers to voter registration.\n\nIn 1897, the eastern third of the county was taken to form the new Bamberg County. In 1919, most of the southern half of the county was taken to form most of the new Allendale County, thus reducing Barnwell County to its present size.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 557.26 square miles (1,443.3 km2), of which 548.38 square miles (1,420.3 km2) is land and 8.88 square miles (23.0 km2) (1.59%) is water.[6]\n\nBanksia Hall\n\nBarnwell State Park\n\nLong Branch Bay Heritage Preserve[7]\n\nGeorges Creek[8]\n\nPar Pond[9]\n\nSalkehatchie River\n\nSavannah River\n\nSouth Fork Edisto River\n\nAiken County – north\n\nBamberg County – east\n\nOrangeburg County – east\n\nAllendale County – southeast\n\nBurke County, Georgia – southwest\n\nUS 78\n\nUS 78 Bus.\n\nUS 278\n\nSC 3\n\nSC 37\n\nSC 39\n\nSC 64\n\nSC 70\n\nSC 125\n\nSC 300\n\nSC 304\n\nBarnwell Regional Airport\n\nSavannah River Site (part)\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18007,376—181012,28066.5%182014,75020.1%183019,23630.4%184021,47111.6%185026,60823.9%186030,74315.5%187035,72416.2%188039,85711.6%189044,61311.9%190035,504−20.4%191034,209−3.6%192023,081−32.5%193021,221−8.1%194020,138−5.1%195017,266−14.3%196017,6592.3%197017,176−2.7%198019,86815.7%199020,2932.1%200023,47815.7%201022,621−3.7%202020,589−9.0%2023 (est.)20,447[1]−0.7%\n\nBarnwell County racial composition[15] Race Num.

The twenty years from 1948 to 1968 were a highly transitional time for the politics of South Carolina & Barnwell County, largely in part due to the Democratic Party's increasing support for African-American civil rights & enfranchisement. Segregationist candidates Strom Thurmond & George Wallace won the county in those aforementioned years, bookended by Democratic wins in 1952 & 1956 & Republican wins in 1960 & 1964. From 1972 on, the county has primarily Republican, but has become more of a swing county in recent years, backing the national winner in every presidential election from 2000 on except for 2020.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Barnwell County, South Carolina[21] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 5,492 53.21% 4,720 45.73% 109 1.06% 2016 4,889 51.54% 4,400 46.39% 196 2.07% 2012 4,659 46.95% 5,188 52.28% 76 0.77% 2008 4,769 48.67% 4,931 50.33% 98 1.00% 2004 4,606 53.03% 3,982 45.85% 97 1.12% 2000 4,521 54.63% 3,661 44.24% 94 1.14% 1996 3,808 48.98% 3,620 46.57% 346 4.45% 1992 4,026 49.24% 3,344 40.90% 807 9.87% 1988 4,467 63.14% 2,564 36.24% 44 0.62% 1984 4,346 60.45% 2,811 39.10% 32 0.45% 1980 3,228 48.14% 3,399 50.69% 78 1.16% 1976 2,569 38.62% 4,083 61.38% 0 0.00% 1972 3,955 71.71% 1,560 28.29% 0 0.00% 1968 1,849 31.25% 1,716 29.01% 2,351 39.74% 1964 3,670 72.64% 1,382 27.36% 0 0.00% 1960 1,842 58.05% 1,331 41.95% 0 0.00% 1956 520 17.28% 1,914 63.61% 575 19.11% 1952 657 29.14% 1,598 70.86% 0 0.00% 1948 28 1.36% 115 5.57% 1,921 93.07% 1944 8 0.53% 1,482 98.41% 16 1.06% 1940 13 0.70% 1,845 99.30% 0 0.00% 1936 2 0.09% 2,157 99.91% 0 0.00% 1932 15 0.79% 1,877 99.21% 0 0.00% 1928 34 3.20% 1,028 96.80% 0 0.00% 1924 23 2.64% 847 97.13% 2 0.23% 1920 25 3.35% 721 96.65% 0 0.00% 1916 21 1.42% 1,454 98.51% 1 0.07% 1912 15 1.29% 1,139 98.27% 5 0.43% 1904 35 2.44% 1,401 97.56% 0 0.00% 1900 57 4.03% 1,356 95.97% 0 0.00%\n\nIn 2022, Barnwell County's GDP was $556.3 million (approx. $27,018 per capita).[22] In chained 2017 dollars, its real GDP was $448.3 million (approx. $21,774 per capita).[23] From 2022 through 2024, the unemployment rate for the county has fluctuated from a high of 6.3% in January 2022 and a low of 3.2% in April 2023.[24]\n\nAs of April 2024 , Walmart is one of the largest employers in the county.[25]\n\nEmployment and Wage Statistics by Industry in Barnwell County, South Carolina[25] Industry Employment Counts Employment Percentage (%) Average Annual Wage ($) Accommodation and Food Services 372 7.8 16,900 Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services 83 1.7 54,080 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting 68 1.4 39,884 Construction 172 3.6 62,972 Educational Services 613 12.8 41,392 Finance and Insurance 64 1.3 40,716 Health Care and Social Assistance 715 14.9 36,296 Information 9 0.2 32,188 Manufacturing 1,039 21.7 59,956 Other Services (except Public Administration) 161 3.4 36,348 Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services 108 2.3 50,024 Public Administration 422 8.8 38,948 Retail Trade 797 16.6 26,624 Transportation and Warehousing 134 2.8 57,512 Wholesale Trade 33 0.7 47,164 Total 4,790 100.0% 41,546\n\nBarnwell (county seat and largest community)\n\nBlackville\n\nElko\n\nHilda\n\nKline\n\nSnelling\n\nWilliston\n\nJames Brown (1933–2006), singer\n\nRosa Louise Woodberry (1869–1932), journalist and school founder\n\nSarah Lowe Twiggs (1839–1920), poet\n\nList of counties in South Carolina\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Barnwell County, South Carolina"
