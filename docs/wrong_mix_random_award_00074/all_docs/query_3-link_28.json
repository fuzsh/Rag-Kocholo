        "text": "From the heart-pounding beats at The Carolina Opry to the legendary performances at the Alabama Theater, Myrtle Beach's streets have echoed with the soul-stirring tunes of country music for decades. Visitors and locals alike flock to these venues year-round, celebrating a musical legacy that has defined the town’s cultural fabric. But what makes this beach town a true haven for country music lovers?\n\nThe Academy of Country Music’s Recognition\n\nFor over 60 years, the Academy of Country Music (ACM) has honored the best in country music since its inception in 1964. Myrtle Beach became a part of this illustrious history in 2022 when the Carolina Country Music Festival (CCMF) was nominated for best country music festival in the country. Its prestige grew in 2023, earning a nomination for best country music festival in the world, and in 2024, it remains one of the world's top five.\n\nThe Rise of CCMF\n\nThe Carolina Country Music Festival (CCMF) made its debut in Myrtle Beach in 2015. Initially seen as a potential one-time event, ticket giveaways were common to boost awareness. However, the festival quickly gained momentum, attracting headliners such as Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert, and Carrie Underwood. Today, tickets sell out at least six months in advance, and the festival garners top accolades in the industry.\n\nA Tribute to the Bluegrass Festival\n\nIn 2019, the annual Bluegrass Festival celebrated its fiftieth anniversary at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. In its early years, Bill Monroe, known as the “Father of Bluegrass,” was the headliner. For their golden celebration, they brought in Rhonda Vincent, the biggest name in bluegrass today. Although the pandemic disrupted their annual gathering, there is hope that this cherished tradition will be reinstated in the future.\n\nRemembering the Coastal Country Jamboree\n\nIn 1981, the Fourth of July weekend saw the unforgettable Coastal Country Jamboree. Attendees brought blankets and beach chairs to a field, now the Surfside Walmart, for two days of music from forty performers, including Dolly Parton, Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Conway Twitty, and an up-and-coming band called Alabama. Helicopters shuttled stars from the Crescent Beach airport to Surfside, creating an event still remembered fondly today.\n\nDolly Parton’s Impact\n\nIn 1992, Dolly Parton opened Pirates Voyage Dinner & Show, a top attraction on the Grand Strand. Beyond entertainment, she brought her international charity, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, providing free books to over 7,000 children in the area. Her contributions continue to make Myrtle Beach an even better place.\n\nAlabama: From Local Band to Legends\n\nIn 1993, Alabama opened the Alabama Theater at Barefoot Landing. These cousins from Fort Payne, Alabama, started as the house band at The Bowery in Myrtle Beach, playing for tips and beer. Their perseverance paid off, leading to a stellar career and a return to the area in 2019 to perform at the CCMF. The Bowery's third owner, Victor Shamah, fondly recalls their early days and their rise to fame.\n\nThe Gatlin Brothers Theater and Beyond\n\nIn 1994, the Gatlin Brothers opened their theater in Fantasy Harbor, seeking a respite from years of touring. Their success added to Myrtle Beach’s reputation as a country music hub. The following year, the Ronnie Milsap Theatre opened next door. Milsap, despite being blind, found success and credits his late wife, Joyce, for his career achievements.\n\nKenny Chesney’s “Anything But Mine” Music Video\n\nBefore headlining the CCMF, Kenny Chesney filmed his \"Anything But Mine\" video at the Myrtle Beach Pavilion and Amusement Park. The song, about a summer romance in Myrtle Beach, resonates with locals and visitors alike. Its lyrics, penned by Scooter Carusoe, tell a story of love and longing.\n\nDarius Rucker: South Carolina’s Native Son\n\nDarius Rucker, frontman for Hootie and the Blowfish, transitioned into country music, earning a place in the Grand Ole Opry. He has performed at the CCMF and is honored in the South Carolina Hall of Fame and the Myrtle Beach Golf Hall of Fame. The Hootie and the Blowfish’s annual fundraising golf tournament, Monday After the Masters (MAM), has donated millions to charities and draws celebrities and spectators to the Grand Strand.\n\nWhether you're a die-hard country fan or just curious about its rich history, Myrtle Beach awaits with open arms and a melody in the air.
