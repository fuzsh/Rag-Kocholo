        "text": "Cody Johnson released his new song “The Painter,” the first single from his forthcoming album due out later this year. The song is written by Benjy Davis, Kat Higgins, and Ryan Larkins.\n\nEven though Cody did not write the song himself, it’s about his marriage. He said, “My favorite lyric in ‘The Painter’ is ‘For every wall I built, she saw a canvas.’ If there’s anything that describes my marriage with my wife, Brandi, it’s that line. And that’s why we’ve been together for 15 years.”\n\nJohnson added, “I hope my fans are encouraged to take the time to appreciate the people they have around them. The ones who make their life beautiful and bring all the beautiful colors to their world when it could just be black and white and dark. Remember them and tell them you love them.”\n\n“The Painter” is the follow-up to Cody’s career-making Grammy-winning (Country Song of The Year) two-week #1 single “‘ Til You Can’t.”\n\nRELATED: Cody Johnson And Jelly Roll: 'The Respect Is Mutual'\n\nJohnson is currently opening shows for Luke Combs in Australia with dates through August 26, when they wrap up the tour with a show in Perth, Australia. This is Cody’s first trip “Down Under,” and while he’d love to make it a family trip, his focus will be on making sure he’d giving his Australian fans the best shows possible.\n\nJohnson told us before he left for the adventure, “You know, my wife and my two daughters were going to come by at some point, and I was like, ‘Look, this is going to be set up shop, play two days in a row, get on a train, go down the road, set up shop, play two or three days in a row, get on a train or plane or bus and go do it again.’ It’s pretty much work.”\n\nWhile working hard, he was still excited before going about the fans there waiting to hear him sing live. He told us, “We know that those people are there, and you’ll be able to see the genuine thankfulness on my face whenever I get there, and I hear those people singing words to songs I wrote cause, I mean, as an artist, that’s what you do it for.”\n\nCody Johnson: A Texan On The Rise In Nashville And Beyond\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
