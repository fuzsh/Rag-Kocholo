        "text": "Marcus Rivera made history in 2019 by becoming the first African-American to be elected mayor of the City of Barnwell.\n\nWith February being Black History Month, Rivera’s achievement was celebrated during the Inaugural Mayor’s Gala on Saturday, Feb. 8. The sold-out event packed the Barnwell State Park’s community building with 270 tickets sold.\n\n“Thank you all for your countless hours of sacrifice and dedication,” said Rivera of everyone who played a part in electing him. “Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress and working together is success. Because of that togetherness and success we were able to awaken a city and make history, not once but twice in one year.”\n\nRivera was first elected in March 2019 during a special election to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor Ed Lemon. He was again elected in November 2019 for a full four-year term.\n\nRivera ran for mayor because he wants to help grow Barnwell, which is not only his hometown but also the place he chose to raise his family. His campaign slogan was “The Change We Need, The Voice You Deserve”.\n\n“I want to help develop the community and ensure that equal opportunity isn’t just some beautiful catchphrase someone used to get elected,” said Rivera. “All those who paved the way before us share one common denominator and that’s a love and passion to see City of Barnwell excel, a passion that I, too, share.”\n\nA desire to help his community isn’t something new for Rivera.\n\n“This man has been working for years on the needs he sees in the community,” said Williston native Adair Ford Boroughs, who is running as a Democrat against Republican Joe Wilson for South Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nEven before he decided to seek office, Rivera has been invested in the community as a high school basketball coach and mentoring teen boys through the Boyz2Men program he founded.\n\n“He’s building bridges for the next generation,” said Brian Gaines, who graduated from Barnwell High School with Rivera in 2000. Gaines made history of his own in 2017 when he became the youngest person and also the first African-American to become the Executive Budget Director for the S.C. Department of Administration.\n\nRev. Michael O’Neal, who is the Rivera family’s pastor at Trinity Outreach Ministries, said Rivera has always been ambitious and goal-driven. “Marcus is one who gives his all to everything he does,” said O’Neal.\n\n“Barnwell elected someone who truly cares about this community,” said Khaleef Brown, who is a member of the Barnwell High School basketball team that Rivera coaches.\n\nThe word “mayor” might evoke thoughts of sitting behind a desk, leading council meetings, cutting ribbons to new businesses, and shaking hands. However, Brown has a different view.\n\n“I think of a man of God, a husband, father, mentor and leader,” said Brown.\n\nBrown thinks of how Rivera engages with the youth and gives them a chance by pushing them to their fullest potential, instilling confidence and values, showing what it means to be a man by being a father figure and mentor, and providing new opportunities, such as a glimpse at corporate America by visiting businesses.\n\n“He doesn’t mind sacrificing his time for the benefit of others,” said Brown of his coach.\n\nBrown said Rivera also has the qualities to move the community forward because he understands what is not working and has a vision for the future.\n\n“There are no limits to what we can achieve as a community if we work hard and remain resilient,” Brown said.\n\nBoroughs said Rivera reminds her of the little blue engine in the popular children’s book, “The Little Engine That Could”.\n\nIn the story, several large engines pass by a long train that had its engine break down. They all made excuses about why they could not help. However, the much-smaller little blue engine came along and pulled the train over the mountain.\n\n“He didn’t have all the experience, power or money as the other engines, but he saw a need in his community and he hooked up his engine to that load and started pulling. He didn’t shoot to the top, but had to work for it. He pulled that load inch by inch,” said Boroughs of the blue engine.\n\nLikewise, Rivera “may not have all the individual wealth or have the most experience, but he sees the need and gets to work,” she said.\n\nThe road to becoming mayor was not an easy one for Rivera who endured a lot of negativity from some people. He had political signs stolen and some people yelled obscene comments at his volunteers.\n\n“The race was not always easy and not always fair, but he and his team reacted to it with integrity, honesty and love,” said Boroughs.\n\nWhile some thought Rivera’s campaign didn’t have a chance, he proved them wrong.\n\n“What this election represented is hope,” said Rivera.\n\nIt’s a hope that it does not matter what one’s race, sex or age is because everyone is capable of doing great things as long as you are “committed, make sacrifices and work together as a team,” he said.\n\nRivera said he is committed to doing everything he can to help Barnwell prosper, including putting in the work.\n\n“The dictionary is the only place where ‘success’ comes before ‘work’,” he said.\n\nGaines encouraged Rivera to put God first, serve from the front, and be open to doing things that have never been done before.\n\nHelping the community is not just the mayor’s job. Every citizen has a part to play.\n\n“We are all a piece of the puzzle,” Rivera said.\n\nThe mayor is especially grateful to his family, including his wife Shonda and their five children - Paisley, King-Aaden, Markel, Gage and Ziran. “They motivate me to be the best version of Marcus I can be,” he said.\n\nHe also acknowledged the roles his parents, grandmother, aunts, uncles and other relatives played in making him who he is today by instilling moral beliefs and core values.\n\nThe evening concluded with a toast to moving Barnwell forward."
