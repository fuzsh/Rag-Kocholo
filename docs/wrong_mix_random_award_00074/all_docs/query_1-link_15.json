He married Mary Gibbes 7 Apr 1738 in Johns Island, Charleston County, South Carolina. they had approx 14 children. He died Feb 1775 in South Carolina.\n\nA closer look at Colonel Nathaniel Barnwell of Port Royal Island and John Evans of St. Helena Island will illustrate the development of sea island indigo plantations during the colonial period. Colonel Nathaniel Barnwell (1705-1775) was the eldest son of Colonel John Barnwell (\"Tuscarora Jack\", the man most responsible for founding Beaufort. [1]\n\nHe built his fortune on indigo which allowed his sons, John and Robert Barnwell, to forge Beaufort’s most powerful political faction in the era of the American Revolution. It was this wealth which also allowed his two daughters, Ann and Mary to make very fortunate marriages. Ann married Colonel Thomas Middleton and Mary married William Elliot. When Barnwell died in 1775, his surviving children divided an estate which included eighty-nine slaves, more than 3,000 acres of land in the sea islands, and two substantial town housesThe History of Beaufort County, South Carolina: 1514-1861[1]\n\nNathaniel was listed as a supporter of the Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the poor in the 1779 report which the charity published. The report on page 11 recorded him as Col. Nathaniel Barnwell of Beaufort, South Carolina and that he had been a supporter since 1756.\n\nName\n\nName: Nathaniel Barnwell [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]\n\nBirth\n\nBirth:Born March 1705 to John and Ann Barnwell in South Carolina [1][9][10]\n\nMarriage\n\nWife: Mary Gibbes\n\nMilitary\n\nNathaniel Barnwell was a colonel in the militia, member of the Commons House of Assembly, justice of the peace, and vestryman of the St. Helen Church for most of his career. But he was less politically active than his father, and the family was never as influential during the colonial period as many of the Charleston based families.\n\nOccupation\n\nOccupation: Indigo Planter Date: 1750[1]\n\nProperty\n\nProperty: Date: 1752 Place: Purchased half of Parris Island[1]\n\n“Tuscarora Jack” Barnwell (John Barnwell the father of Nathaniel Barnwell of this profile) left his six daughters and two sons a considerable legacy of frontier land, but at this death he was not a wealthy man. The foundation of the family fortune was left to the venerable and persevering Colonel Nathaniel Barnwell (1705-1775) whose life spanned the entire colonial history of Beaufort. Nathaniel Barnwell inherited 1,400 acres on Port Royal. In 1752, Barnwell purchased the 1,520 acre Delebere tract on Parris Island. These two large plantations made him the most productive indigo planters in the Beaufort Districts.[1]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nResidence Date: 1740\n\nResidence Place: Saint Helena Port Royal Parish, South Carolina, United States[6]\n\nResidence Date: 1750\n\nResidence Place: Saint Helena Port Royal Parish, South Carolina, United States[11]\n\nResidence Date: 1760\n\nResidence Place: St Helena Port Royal, South Carolina, United States[4]\n\nResidence Date: 1775\n\nResidence Place: Will, Charleston County, SC[8]\n\nResidence Date: 1770\n\nResidence Place: Saint Helena Parish, South Carolina, United States[3]\n\nDeath\n\nDEATH 20 Feb 1775 (aged 69)[10]\n\nBeaufort, Beaufort County, South Carolina, USA\n\nBURIAL\n\nSaint Helena's Episcopal Churchyard[10]\n\nBeaufort, Beaufort County, South Carolina, USA\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina: 1514-1861By Lawrence Sanders Rowland, Alexander Muoore, George C.
