        "text": "Ronnie Milsap is not just headlining Sunday's concert at the City Bank Auditorium. He is the entire show. Don't walk in a half hour late, thinking you'll just be missing the opener.The show is really An Evening with Ronnie Milsap.How else does one treat an artist with 40 No. 1 country hits? That places him in third place, trailing only George Strait and Conway Twitty.A recognized superstar - the Academy of Country Music honored him as a music pioneer in 2002 - Milsap, 67, could choose to take life easy, enjoying visits at home from the grandchildren who call him Papa.But he pointed out, \"There is still nothing like the electricity of a live performance.\"There is no way he can play all of his hits in one concert. In an effort to make sure no one leaves dissatisfied, he leaves part of his show completely open so fans can shout out requests.He and his band have been together so long, noted Milsap, they can play any request.He said, \"Merle Haggard told me, 'Milsap, you better make sure you love these songs you're recording, because you're going to be singing them for the rest of your life.'\"Merle was right, but I generally love all the songs I recorded. But I might take seven or eight songs and link them in a nice medley, or I may play an old song a different way.\"His popularity has not waned. In 2007, recalled Panhandle-South Plains Fair general manager Herb Higgs, Milsap's appearance at the Fair Park Coliseum found \"traffic stacked up all along Avenue A and Broadway.\"He is a great individual, as well as a prolific artist who keeps his audiences satisfied.\"Painful childhoodMilsap was born in Robbinsville, N.C., almost completely blind from a congenital disorder. What little vision he had was completely lost as a child.His parents sought miracles at church revivals and, when none arrived, they believed it was because their young son lacked enough faith in God.He was given to his grandmother to raise and, at age 5, he was sent to live at the Governor Morehead School for the Blind in Raleigh, N.C.A developing blood clot found doctors diagnosing a need to remove Milsap's eyes.Yet throughout his youth, he discovered happiness in music.Milsap said, \"When I was 3 or 4, I already was listening to an old Philco battery radio and I discovered that, if I put some wire on what we called the aerial (antenna), I could pick up stations from as far away as Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\"Anyway, I could memorize songs after hearing them. I also knew the keys. I didn't know it at the time, but God had blessed me with perfect pitch.\"Instructors at the School for the Blind discovered Milsap's musical gifts when he was 7.He began piano lessons at age 7, and violin lessons a year later.\"But they didn't let me play no Flatt & Scruggs, no Bill Monroe,\" he said.Instead, he was trained to play only classical music.\"I had 12 years of classical music training,\" said Milsap. \"I was in their top three students, and I wanted to become a musician. But I was told over and over, 'No, you cannot do that because you will fail! You will fall flat on your face.\" 'And you will be a liability to the state of North Carolina.' \"From pre-law to topping chartsInstead, they encouraged Milsap to pursue academic studies. So for the next two years, he studied pre-law.But on weekends, music fans were becoming excited about a blind man who was playing all styles of music at the local clubs.Indeed, Milsap played a little of everything, including country, American pop and soul.After getting married, Milsap and his wife moved to Memphis, then Atlanta and finally, he said, \"to Nashville at just the right time.\"Milsap played piano for Elvis' recordings of \"Don't Cry Daddy\" and \"Kentucky Rain\" in 1969 and 1970, respectively.In Nashville, Charley Pride's producer, Jack D. Johnson, helped him land a contract with RCA Records in 1973.Within a year, Milsap was topping the charts.The hits kept coming, including seven straight No. 1 singles between 1976 and 1978.A stream of crossover country and pop hits flowed from 1979 to 1992, with four in the year 1983 alone - the fourth being \"Smoky Mountain Rain.\""
