        "text": "I am Nick Ellison. My college experience took me from Westminster, Maryland to Wilson, NC where I pursued my education and simultaneously played basketball as a full scholarship athlete. Standing at 6’9”, my nickname “Big Nick” has been with me my entire life as I have always been the biggest kid and now adult in the room. After college and having fallen in love with Wilson, NC, I decided to pursue real estate and become a Broker. Since 2018, I have been blessed to be a Top Producing agent every year of my real estate career. I have served as President of the Wilson Board of Realtors as well as serving on other local boards and community non-profits. They say if you love what you do you never go to work. Well, it is work I assure you, but I do love it!\n\nMy wife Laura, the love of my life, is a physical therapist and owns Mission Physical Therapy. Between the two of us, we pride ourselves on taking care of people. We enjoy our two dogs, Sable Bell, Husky Lab and Conway Twitty, a mixed breed with a personality as big as life itself. Church, family, golf and Carolina Hurricanes fill our down time.\n\nIf you want the Biggest Realtor to make big things happen for you and your family, give me a call at 252.289.3189."
