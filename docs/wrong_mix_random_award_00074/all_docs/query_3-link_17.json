        "text": "Conway Twitty’s bus – the one he died on in 1993 – has a new face.\n\nThe characteristic Tweety Bird wearing a cowboy hat has been replaced with a gospel musician’s smiling face, his arms spread wide, advertising for his ministry.\n\nBut that musician, Wilmington resident Derwin Hinson, couldn’t have predicted that back in 1984, when he met Mr. Twitty backstage at a Nashville concert hall.\n\nAfter he and his brother, Danny, sang harmony on Vern Gosdin’s hit I Can Tell By The Way You Dance, Mr. Twitty said, “That’s mighty fine harmony, boys.” They had been performing on a Crook and Chase special called the “Top 20 Songs of 1984.”\n\nFour years later, Mr. Hinson got his first glimpse of Mr. Twitty’s bus, which the musician had commissioned for his band and road crew, while visiting the Twitty City theme park outside Nashville. Mr. Hinson now calls that bus his “45,000-pound business car.”\n\nWhile Mr. Twitty was making it big with Hello Darlin’ and Tight Fittin’ Jeans, zooming around the country in his private coach, Mr. Hinson was picking and strumming his way through the Nashville gospel and bluegrass scene. He played the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville Now, Austin City Limits and in the first Farm Aid concert in 1985.\n\nHe sung backup vocals and played string instruments for country music legend Charlie Louvin, Vern Gosdin and Bill Monroe.\n\nIn 1993, when Mr. Hinson was playing banjo, guitar and Dobro for the bluegrass gospel group Special Edition, Mr. Twitty was on a concert tour in Branson, Mo. He fell ill and died on the floor of his bus, beside his bed in the back, of an abdominal aneurysm.\n\nHis beloved 9-bunk bus that had taken him on tours throughout the country was sold to the Lewis Family, a bluegrass gospel band. In their log book for the bus, the first entry reads: “Conway’s bus oil changed last trip mileage 57,432 in Springfield, Mo.”\n\nWhen things weren’t working out with his gospel band, Mr. Hinson moved his music back home to Wilmington.\n\nHeck with it, he thought: I’ll be my own band.\n\nThe trip home also reconnected him with his Christian faith. Mr. Hinson felt a need to “go out and tell about Jesus and what he’s done in our lives,” he said. “It was actually a call on my life. . . like a burning desire to go and do what you know you need to do – like a doctor who feels compelled to heal the world or a mountain climber who needs to climb.”\n\nNo longer the shy side man, the musician began the Derwin Hinson Music Ministries in 1996. He’s been most active in it for the past two years.\n\nBefore he bought Mr. Twitty’s bus, Mr. Hinson drove “Lazarus,” the nickname for his jalopy RV because “we kept having to raise it from the dead,” said his wife and manager, Alene. (Near the end of Lazarus’ many lives, Mr. Hinson had to run the heat, even in the summer, to keep the engine cool.)\n\nThis year, though, it was time for some new wheels. Through his contacts in the Lewis Family, Mr. Hinson learned about Mr. Twitty’s bus and bought it in August, just before the gas crisis. The bus runs like a dream, but the gas bill is a nightmare, costing them about $450 each time they fill up with a gas mileage of five miles to the diesel gallon.\n\nBut having a nice, comfortable ride that accommodates his whole family is worth the cost.\n\nThe Hinson’s five children sleep in the bunks (where members of the Lewis Family wrote their names on the curtains). It has a bathroom, shower, lots of closet space and the main bedroom, where Mr. Twitty died. And that, Mr. Hinson said, doesn’t bother him at all.\n\nThe license plate on the bus summarizes Mr. Hinson’s musical feat – “1MAN-BND.”\n\nHe pre-records tracks to take with him on the road, then performs the lead vocals and instrumental solos live.In his concerts, Mr. Hinson sings and plays nine instruments – acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, Dobro, fiddle, bass, autoharp, harmonica and electric guitar – and tells humorous stories of his own faith experience.\n\nHe’s written about 500 songs, released 10 CDs and knows the words and lyrics to about 1,200 songs.\n\nOn his CD, Favorite Hymns Volume 1, Mr. Hinson has a wide-ranging baritone voice that combines the twang of Randy Travis with the sincerity of George Jones. His version of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is arranged in movements as a 6-minute Western ballad and quick bluegrass reel. Mr. Hinson sped up the hymn He Leadeth Me with rollicking bluegrass rhythms.\n\nWhile Mr. Hinson lets the music do most of the talking to the hearts of churchgoers, the Hinson ministry claims to have converted 43 people to Christianity. The musician is not ordained.\n\nA church sign that he saw recently explains how he feels about that: “We can’t all be preachers but we can all be reachers.” He now drives the bus two or three nights out of the week singing in churches and at revivals and playing for his gas expenses and a “love offering.” (Sometimes his wife drives it, too. She drove a school bus as a teenager.)\n\nHe keeps the stories of the people he’s met and counseled in his memory, pulling them out like old songs he hasn’t sung in years.\n\n“I remember seeing this old man saved in one service, coming up front and saying: ‘I need Jesus,’” he said, “then the next year, I came back, and he’s singing in the choir and a is a different creature with a different glow to him.\n\n“There’s too many people just playing church. It’s about getting in there and making a difference.”\n\nAmanda Greene: 343-2365 or amanda.greene@starnewsonline.com"
