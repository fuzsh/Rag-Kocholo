This website is no longer being updated but will be available for some time as a public service.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, DHEC became two separate agencies â€” the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) and the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH). Additionally, DHEC's retail food program and milk and dairy lab moved to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. You can visit the linked agencies for your needs or visit the DHEC homepage to choose the correct agency website."
