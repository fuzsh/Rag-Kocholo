For the last 20 years, we’ve called South Carolina home and it is beyond belief to be honored with this award. Many thanks to the Carolina Country Music Association and everyone who has supported me throughout the years. But also I would like to say thank you to my bride Brandee and our three incredible kids, Courtney, Grayson, and Ashton for their support and sacrifice over the years. I would also like to that my Alabama Theatre family as well. My greatest thanks to God for the gift of music and using my gift to help others.”\n\nGreg Rowles has been an active musician since the age of twelve when he began playing in a band with his mom, dad, and brother.

Bush as Secretary of Veteran Affairs. Greg also performed numerous times as a solo artist on the Grand Ole Opry. This year marks his 40th year in show business and his 20th season here where he has been honored to be named as “Alabama Theatre’s Good Will Ambassador.” Greg’s latest CD, “Country & Gospel Special,” was recorded live at the theatre earlier this year.\n\nGreg served for over 14 years in Christian ministry as a music pastor and now consults with churches forming praise services.

The show’s Executive Producer is Sweet Tea, who is also the afternoon DJ on Carolina Country (100.1 WFAY in Fayetteville and 93.9 WMIR in Myrtle Beach). According to Sweet Tea, “I think there are a lot of great artists who aren’t typically heard on the Radio. The CCMAs give those musicians an opportunity to be recognized for their hard work.” She also says that country music fans aren’t neglected because the show is also a way for fans to connect with the musicians. “It’s a big party for both the artists and the fans. Everybody gets to enjoy some great ‘Carolina roots’ music.”\n\nTickets to the show are on sale now at www.CarolinaCountryMusicAwards.com.\n\nABOUT ANDRULONIS MEDIA\n\nAndrulonis Media Chairman/CEO Jeff Andrulonis is a well-known local entrepreneur with interests including real estate, broadcasting, and retail.
