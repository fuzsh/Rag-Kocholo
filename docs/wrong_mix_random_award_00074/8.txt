Colonel Nathaniel Barnwell (1705-1775) was the eldest son of Colonel John Barnwell ("Tuscarora Jack", the man most responsible for founding Beaufort. [1]

He built his fortune on indigo which allowed his sons, John and Robert Barnwell, to forge Beaufort’s most powerful political faction in the era of the American Revolution. It was this wealth which also allowed his two daughters, Ann and Mary to make very fortunate marriages. Ann married Colonel Thomas Middleton and Mary married William Elliot. When Barnwell died in 1775, his surviving children divided an estate which included eighty-nine slaves, more than 3,000 acres of land in the sea islands, and two substantial town housesThe History of Beaufort County, South Carolina: 1514-1861[1]

“Tuscarora Jack” Barnwell (John Barnwell the father of Nathaniel Barnwell of this profile) left his six daughters and two sons a considerable legacy of frontier land, but at this death he was not a wealthy man. The foundation of the family fortune was left to the venerable and persevering Colonel Nathaniel Barnwell (1705-1775) whose life spanned the entire colonial history of Beaufort. Nathaniel Barnwell inherited 1,400 acres on Port Royal. In 1752, Barnwell purchased the 1,520 acre Delebere tract on Parris Island. These two large plantations made him the most productive indigo planters in the Beaufort Districts.[1]
