Admittedly, what kind of day it is may determine what kind of comedy you want to watch, which is why it is so great that Netflix has as vast a content library as it does.\n\nFrom such original series as “Dead to Me” and “Dear White People,” to licensed content from “Community” to “Girlfriends” and the most recent launch of “Seinfeld,” there is something for everyone — and every mood.\n\nHere, Variety highlights the 30 best live-action television comedies you can currently stream on Netflix."
