He was announced by Hamilton star Anthony Ramos.\n\nOscars 2020: Best-dressed stars on the red carpet\n\nShow all 80\n\nSouth Korean black comedy Parasite was the evening's biggest winner, making history by becoming the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture.\n\nOther winners at the 2020 ceremony included Brad Pitt, who delivered an emotional acceptance speech that saw him praise Leonardo DiCaprio and criticise the verdict of Trump's impeachment trial, while Laura Dern took home the prize for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nAs expected, Joaquin Phoenix won Best Actor for Joker following which he criticised inequality and paid tribute to his brother River Phoenix, who died in 1993.\n\nMeanwhile, Olivia Colman had the audience in stitches before presenting Phoenix with his award.\n\nFind a full list of the 2020 Oscar winners here.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
