        "text": "There’s exciting news for fans of the hit show Girlfriends and Sister, Sister! Both shows are coming to Netflix this fall, according to Strong Black Lead’s official Twitter page. In addition to those two shows, Moesha, The Game, The Parkers, Half & Half, and One On One are also coming to the streaming behemoth.\n\nIn a quirky ad that features stars from all of those shows, including Tracee Ellis Ross, Tamera Mowry, Jill Marie Jones, Rachel True, Pooch Hall, Shar Jackson, Essence Atkins, Robert Ri’ chard, Jackee Harry, Persia White, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and Sherly Lee Ralph, among others, the news was announced.\n\n“Joan, Toni, Maya, and Lynn,” Ross says at the beginning of the ad followed by Mowry saying, “Go Home Roger!” which was a popular catchphrase on Sister, Sister, that was often said to Marques Houston, who portrayed the character of Roger.\n\n“Mo to the-E to the!” Jackson excitedly recites in the ad with a big smile planted on her face, teasing Moesha. Midway through the video, the stars all cohesively announce that their former shows are coming to Netflix.\n\nRobinson says that the opportunity is “giving new life and giving re-imagination to shows like this.” Brandy’s Moesha drops first on August 1. Check out when the rest of the shows will be available below.\n\nGlennisha Morgan is a Detroit-bred multimedia journalist and writer.
