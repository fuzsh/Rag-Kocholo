        "text": "Comedy does not, as a rule, age well. It's too precariously reliant on the subtle social bylaws of its time. If the way the characters speak has come to sound artificial, the joke is dead. If the punchline was transgressive then, but is no longer, no one will laugh. To understand a joke, we must be familiar with the serious rule set it is subverting. We need the context, the norms of the time. Which is why only total gits guffaw at Shakespeare plays.\n\nIt's also why I just don't \"get\" Tony Hancock. I can tell that, at the time, Hancock's Half Hour must have been hilarious. I can see why, if you watched it when it was broadcast, or within, say, the following decade, you might have chortled hot tea through your nose. But I find it hard to believe that there are those in their teens, 20s or 30s who could watch those shows now and not conclude: \"Eh, I guess you had to be there.\"\n\nSo I didn't think I'd go for My Hero – Ben Miller on Tony Hancock (BBC1). I figured I was in for a nostalgic hour of effusive praise and once-hilarious clips that would leave me cold. And I seemed to be right at first, when the show began with archive footage of a dated Hancock sketch, intercut with shots of Miller down in some dusty old graveyard for telly screenplays, reading along from the tatty hand-typed original, in a state somewhere between awe and rapture.\n\nBut this was not a simple celebration or sepia-tinted love-in. It was a psychological profile, a full portrait of the artist named Tony Hancock. Miller conducted his interviews with Hancock's old friends and colleagues with a quiet enthusiasm and a neat, Therouxesque eye for a gentle but probing question, and gave us a tour of the comedian's life, from his childhood in a Bournemouth hotel, to his death in a flat in Sydney, with a quite unexpected depth of insight.\n\nWe learned, for example, that Hancock's nerves were paralysing. He enlisted in the RAF aged 18, and failed two auditions to join Ensa, the military entertainers' association, after taking to the stage, announcing \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" and freezing on the spot. And later, when Miller interviewed writers who worked with him on Hancock's Half Hour, we learned that the terror of performance never left him. Even at his peak, he would retreat to the toilets and dry-heave before every show.\n\nThen there was his perfectionism, which alienated everyone who worked with him, best captured in his own confession, from an archive interview: \"The only happiness I could have would be to perfect the talent that I have, however small it may be.\"\n\nThe most telling of Miller's chats was with actress Sylvia Syms, who co-starred with Hancock in his heavily autobiographical film The Punch and Judy Man, about a washed-up seaside entertainer. She said the film was Hancock's way of telling people \"about the awfulness of comedy, and how it goes wrong, and how your life goes wrong, and how the marriage goes wrong\".\n\nWhat was left of the documentary was little more than the proof of that awfulness: Hancock's marriage crumbled, his drinking became disastrous and, after a couple more failed comebacks, he brought his life to an abrupt and early end. You didn't need to love his comedy to appreciate the tragedy.\n\nFew people, though, can possibly appreciate tragedy quite as much as classicist Dr Michael Scott, whose documentary Ancient Greece: The Greatest Show on Earth (BBC4) began with a shot of him sitting alone in a dingy cinema, watching a series of harrowing scenes from the film Trojan Women, and gazing at the screen, appropriately harrowed. His thesis: that drama as we know it was born in ancient Athens.\n\nHis methods: the usual. He sat for gorgeous wide-angle shots on the stone steps of ruined Greek amphitheatres and the rubble of forgotten temples. He met up with fellow academics for a natter in the sunshine, unpicking, for example, the purpose of Athenian theatre and its relationship with democracy. He filled us in on the details of the war with Persia, and the sophistication of the plays written afterwards, over archive footage and computer-animated re-enactments, in his best generic BBC voice. And he did it all with the contemplative pauses and poses of a young Richard Gere, making it seem as if his knowledge of ancient Greece was as much the product of wistful boyhood memories as of academic study. You half-expected him to round off sentences with a mournful sigh.\n\nBeneath the theatricality, though, this was informed and impassioned stuff. Scott has made five documentaries about the Greeks now for the Beeb, and on this evidence he will be making them for as long as he has facts – or boyhood memories, or whatever they are – to share.\n\nTV highlights"
