        "text": "Though Kyoko Hori and Izumi Miyamura seem like complete opposites, they have one important thing in common - both of them are hiding something important about themselves from their friends.\n\nHori can't live the carefree life of a regular high schooler because she's responsible for watching her younger brother, while Miyamura has a bunch of tattoos and piercings despite seeming like the quintessential nerd. The two quickly bond over this shared trait, and become a couple early in the series.\n\nAfter a painful breakup with a guy who thought her interests were weird, Narumi Momose wants to make sure the co-workers at her new job don’t find out that she’s an otaku.\n\nThis goal turns out to be easier said than done, because her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji is one of her new co-workers. She ends up deciding to date him instead of trying to hide her true self from someone else. Most of the series follows the ins and outs of their relationship, plus the relationship between two co-workers who are also already dating.\n\nShirayuki is living a peaceful life as an herbalist in Tamburan when the nation's prince tries to force her into becoming his concubine. She's rescued by Zen Wistalia, the second prince of Clarines. She soon ends up moving to Clarines and taking an exam to be a palace herbalist.\n\nThe two would probably have started dating immediately, but Zen is under a lot of pressure not to date a ‘commoner’ and Shirayuki doesn't want to be seen as a gold digger. But they can't help being attracted to each other, and by the middle of Season 1 it's obvious that they're meant to be together. By Season 2, they're an item - whether the rest of the royal family likes it or not.\n\nNot only does the main couple in Tonikawa: Over the Moon for You get together right away, they get married right away.\n\nAfter Tsukasa saves Nasa from getting hit by a truck, Nasa is so struck by her beauty that he asks her out on the spot. Tsukasa agrees, on the condition that Nasa marry her immediately. Despite this being totally unexpected, Nasa agrees, and the two begin their married life together.\n\nA Sign of Affection tells the story of Yuki Itose, a deaf college student excited to break out of her shell. A meet cute on the subway has her crossing paths with the handsome and adventurous Itsuomi Nagi. Itsuomi is immediately captivated by Yuki - who feels the same way about him - and they begin to learn more about each other as time passes.\n\nIt turns out that time passes a bit quickly, because by the sixth episode, the two are pretty certain about their feelings for one another. Itsuomi confesses in a romantic gesture and the two become a wholesome, heartwarming couple.\n\nAfter a painful and socially devastating bout with a mysterious supernatural illness called Puberty Syndrome, Sakuta Azusagawa has dedicated himself to helping others with the same condition.\n\nMai Sakurajima, the first person he helps, has become completely invisible to just about everyone except Sakuta. This is due to how hyper-visible she's been in the past as a child actress. Sakuta helps her work through her feelings about this, and eventually helps her become visible again. In the process, the two start dating, and Mai teams up with Sakuta to cure more victims of Puberty Syndrome."
