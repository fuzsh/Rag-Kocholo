        "text": "Would you like to see what the ladies of “Girlfriends” have been up to all these years?\n\nThe popular sitcom aired on UPN in 2000 and then eventually moved to The CW, the network’s successor, before officially ending in 2008. “Girlfriends” (initially) centered around the lives and friendships of four Black women, Joan (played by Tracee Ellis Ross), Toni (played by Jill Marie Jones), Maya (played by Golden Brooks), and Lynn (played by Persia White).\n\nDespite the series gaining a large fanbase, the fictional characters were never given a proper ending. According to reports, the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike and the high costs of production both played a major hand in “Girlfriends” ending abruptly. It was speculated that a retrospective episode was in the works to give viewers closure, but unfortunately, nothing was finalized and the series never returned after the 13th episode of season 8.\n\nHowever, fans of the show shouldn’t lose hope because it seems a revival still might happen. During a recent interview, the series executive producer Kelsey Grammer was asked to give an update on a possible “Girlfriends” reboot. He shared,\n\n“I would love to reboot Girlfriends. Of course, it would probably be a different kind of show, but we got The Game back on and that was wonderful. I don’t know if Paramount+ is gonna grab another season of that but you never know. I think they should because I know many people who love that show and love those characters and would like to see them continue. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nFor those who may be unaware, “The Game” is a spin-off of “Girlfriends.” Melanie Barnett (played by Tia Mowry) is Joan’s cousin. The fictional football series was first brought to life during a 2006 episode of “Girlfriends.” After being picked up by The CW, the sitcom officially premiered a few months later.\n\nKelsey Grammer continued, sharing that he’d love to see Tracee Ellis Ross step back into the role of Joan.\n\n“But yeah, I would love to reboot Girlfriends and I would love to see Tracee [Ellis Ross] in that role again. She was terrific in that. The show was a wonderful opportunity to see all those young women start out. It’s such a beautiful ensemble effort and I was very proud to be connected to that.”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this entire situation? Tell us in the comments below!"
