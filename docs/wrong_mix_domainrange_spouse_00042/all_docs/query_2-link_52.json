        "text": "YOLO has been termed the ignorant man’s carpe diem by people who snub their noses at the “The Motto” and the behavior it incentivizes.\n\nHowever, as a philologist (in training), I truly believe that we must admire “YOLO” for the fact that it articulated in perfect, acronymic brevity a theme that is so common in modern pop music and culture—party it up, be young and stupid, because it’s a fleeting state of being. [insert inspirational statement that doesn't remind you overmuch of your own mortality here]\n\nOh hey, look, a sunset... (this is me backtracking).\n\nTurns out, there’s a strong strain of the YOLO principle in Arabic poetry as well, but this is not something that intuitively makes sense at first blush. Even people who know next to nothing about Islam know that alcohol is anathema. Furthermore, like Christianity, Islam has a firmly and fully articulated eschatological model that indicates that you do not, indeed, only live once. Rather, there is a clear vision of afterlife that one may prepare for.\n\nBut, as in any religion, there are many differences between doctrine and practice, many loopholes, and many changes in interpretation over time. During the early period of the Umayyad caliphate, most specifically the reign of ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, the contours of the intoxicant ban in Islam were attemptedly cemented. This is evident in a rescript dispatched from the caliph that declared not only fermented dates but also fermented grapes to be off-limits. These debates preceded this rescript though, and continued for long after. Some endure to this day. Wine culture even persisted to the extent that it was formative of a genre of Arabic poetry, called khamriyyat, or wine songs, and mostly extant from the collections of court poets—meaning that wine was not only widely enjoyed, but it was enjoyed specifically by the religio-political elite that would have been in the position to enforce against such behavior in accordance with Qur’anic precedent. The drinking habits of various political leaders became fodder for the propaganda projects of their opponents throughout Islamic history, but that really doesn’t seem to have impeded interest much.\n\nLike most organizations loaded with cash and power, caliphal courts had their fair share of luxury and revelry. Fine food and drink, beautiful women and young boys (a post on homoeroticism in Classical Arabic poetry is forthcoming), and sometimes even beautiful women who dressed as young boys were all features in one way or another in Islamic court culture.\n\nBut how does this aspect of court culture get wrapped into a raison d’etre that parallels YOLO? Well, per the prior comment on Islamic eschatology, rather than abiding by the idea that you only live once, poets would often instead focus on the idea that you are only young once, or that you are only in a certain type of opportune social position to enjoy these things once. Court poets especially were often poignantly aware of how many people were competing for their spaces, which meant that not only was it ideal to cultivate the ruler’s view of you as an encouraging “boon companion” (drinking buddy), but also that this sense of impermanence could act as ample inspiration for the very wine songs that kept the rulers interested. There is perhaps no single poet more accomplished in this YOCO (you only court once) regime than Abu Nuwas, who is famous for his khamriyyat as well as for other poems about youthful abandon that are less focused on drank. Can he stand against Drake, though?\n\nAbu Nuwas:\n\nAbu Nuwas’ laqab, or nickname, means “Father of Curls,” which already disposes me to him as a fellow textured-hair-haver. He pioneered the genre of khamriyya, or wine poetry, as it took off during the ‘Abbassid caliphate. Ironically, a significant subset of this genre focuses specifically on drinking benders in Christian monasteries, mostly because Christians were often the proprietors of vineyards given their taboo in Islam (for more, see Robert Irwin's work, Night and Horses and the Desert, pp. 123). Not only would wine be acquired in these spaces, but, according to poetry from the mid-700s, it would also be enjoyed on the premises (as, sometimes, would the Christian boys).\n\nAbu Nuwas was born in Persia, likely sometime during the 750s, and lived until 814. His love of wine seems at times to go hand-in-hand with his love of Persia, which bore a long tradition of courtly wine poetry. Abu Nuwas wrote erotic poetry addressed to both male and female would-be-suitors. This didn’t carry much stigma, though, and can even be said to have been commonplace—so much so that mention of it is usually crowded out by his manifold miraculous literary accomplishments. In fact, Abu Nuwas grew to such notoriety that he appears several times among the stories of the 1001 Nights. Abu Nuwas’ past, both mythical and real, is highly contended (hence the 15-year span of possible dates of his birth). He briefly took political refuge in Egypt because he elegized the Iranian high-society family, the Barmakids, who drew the ire of Harun al-Rashid. After Harun al-Rashid’s rule ended and his son, Muhammad al-Amin, took the crown Abu Nuwas returned to Baghdad. Al-Amin had previously been his student, and favored Abu Nuwas among the poets in his court. In life and in death, Abu Nuwas has earned recognition as being the greatest poet of his era. He managed to display a surprising amount of versatility in spite of his rumored near-constant torpor and “libertinism.” He wrote about hunting, composed traditional elegies, and even addressed themes of asceticism and religiosity. Abu Nuwas’ poetry and poetic persona continues to be so relevant today that he merits mention in the Arabic novel that is perhaps the most widely read of our generation in the West (in translation),Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North, wherein the narrator analogizes his seductive power with the power of Abu Nuwas’ words.\n\nDrake:\n\nBorn Aubrey “Drake” Graham in Toronto to a Canadian Jewish mother and Tennessean African-American father, Drake grew up with what he calls a split life. His parents divorced when he was a child, leaving him caught between the upper-class environment of Toronto and the impoverished central Memphis. His mother’s sickness during his teenage years meant that the money he earned in his television roles constituted his family’s primary income. Like Abu Nuwas, Drake has displayed a rather dizzying amount of versatility in his meteoric rise from a lanky, adorable, paraplegic teenager in the Canadian teen soap Degrassi to a rap artist whose stylings strongly feature his love of women, money, his close-knit posse, his own comeback, and all things fancy. Like Abu Nuwas, his rap ranges from irreverent to esoteric, and tends to create interplays between addled mindsets induced by substances and addled mindsets induced by ambition and artistic ‘revelation.’ For example, he opens his song “Further,” which incorporates themes of drinking, drugs, and sex in the refrain, with the lines “Somewhere between psychotic and iconic/ somewhere between I want it and I got it/ somewhere between I’m sober and I’m lifted/ somewhere between a mistress and commitment.” With a few modifications, this could just as easily open onto an ode to wine’s ecstatically spiritual properties like the poetry of 1000 years ago that is up for discussion.\n\nUnlike Abu Nuwas, Drake does not elegize androgynous or male subjects, but he does often have a nameless female (or females) in the background of his songs, lurking as a presence providing fodder for his work. He elegizes a mythical woman in “Make Me Proud,” who is then given a responsive voice in a cameo verse by Nicki Minaj, and in other works often comments on the value of his unnamed woman over the other “quote unquote ‘bad bitches,’” who front in the club—often the locus for displays of pretention and fakery not unlike the false airs and backbiting social climbing that would occur in court settings, all thickly lubricated with wine, merriment, and commodified women who are at once prized and disposable (according to Drake’s rhetoric, not my view…). These club scenes are presided over by a celebrity set, who manage to attract the hangers-on that Drake so loathes. In fact, part of the YOLO principle involves not giving any time or energy to people who aren’t in your crew and haven’t seen you through from the beginning. “Started from the bottom now we here,” is at once an exclusive statement and an aspiration that can be coveted by a collective. The “we” is delimited by Drake and his closest friends who started from the bottom along with him, but the trajectory of “bottom to top” is as old and American as apple pie. It is at once a comfortable statement and a rebuff, and Drake often toes this line between throwing shade at his newer fans and patting his closer-knit crew on the back for propelling him into the spotlight.\n\nUnlike a medieval court poet, Drake already probably has more than enough to retire comfortably (he is, after all, “25 sittin’ on 25 mil”), so perhaps being a little bristly with his fan-base won’t hurt him too badly, and in the meantime he benefits from the fact that tearing down the fakes and the haters makes him a more relatable and on-trend figure. But ultimately, for both Abu Nuwas and Drake, the message remains the same: live it up because nothing lasts forever, whether it’s because of the vicissitudes of fame or the more active interference of a changeable patron.\n\nComparable Lyrics:\n\nAbu Nuwas (translation my own):\n\nI ran with youth with abandon,\n\nAnd it became easy for me to choose vulgar things\n\nI found the sweetest perfumes of the nights\n\nAre (contained) in the wedding of a trilling voice with an elegant chord\n\nDrake (Light Up):\n\nClubbing hard, f***in’ women, ain’t much to do\n\nWrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne\n\nStill getting brain from a thang, ain’t shit changed\n\nHow you feel? How you feel? How you feel?\n\nTwenty five sittin’ on 25 mil, uh\n\nI’m in the building and I’m feeling myself\n\nAbu Nuwas (Princeton Poetry Project Translation):\n\nForget all of that! Get on with yourself, and drink a fine vintage\n\nGolden-hued, it mingles water and froth\n\nAs it pours from the hand of a slim-waisted beauty\n\nWho resembles a willow-branch, flaunting its graceful bearing\n\nThe bartender saw that I’d been smitten\n\nHe greeted me, making sure that I am lavish in my giving\n\nDrake (Thank Me Now):\n\nMahalo from the hardest act to follow\n\nLately I’ve been drinking like there’s a message in a bottle\n\nAloha’s to women with no ties\n\nTo men that I know well\n\nThat way there are no lies […]\n\nRappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them\n\n‘Cause they think I can help them get back to where they fell from\n\nBut drink up because everyone here is good tonight\n\nExcept the n****s that I came with, they good for life\n\nAbu Nuwas (Anne Marie Flood translation):\n\nTell him who would preach to the world his ideals:\n\nSome things you may know, but others elude you.\n\nIf you take offense to my state, keep your silence.\n\nTo deprive [me of] my oblivion, that would be blasphemy.\n\nDrake (Lust for Life):\n\nBut you could miss me with all that\n\nDiss me then crawl back\n\nI really wish y’all would fall back\n\nRap Battle: Who would win?\n\nEhhhhh… gotta give it to the Classic here; Abu Nuwas takes gold. He has a much broader range of inspiration than Drake, needless to say. He loves all women, especially androgynous ones, and is so obsessed with the boys that he writes smitten, frank poems about seeing their trousers come off in the bathhouse. With that many muses running around (some buck-naked), how could he ever run out of ideas? Sure, they both have an alcohol induced joie-de-vivre and a penchant for flaunting their youth, but Abu Nuwas has managed to both delight and baffle interpreters for centuries with the mystical potential that his poetry may hold. I rather doubt that Drake’s lyrics open themselves up to similar probing. That said, only time will tell whether the YOLO principle lasts as long as Abu Nuwas’ poetic legacy. (If it makes it into any internationally acclaimed novels, I will eat my words....)"
