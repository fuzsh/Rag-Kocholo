        "text": "It’s been quite a journey in getting some of our favorite vintage sitcoms back on the screen. While we’ve seen reruns of A Different World, Living Single and The Fresh Prince on streaming platforms like Hulu and Netflix, a few underrated gems are still vied for.\n\nOne in particular is Girlfriends, the series which followed a group of successful women of color in California.\n\nWhile the series has come and gone, talks for a film adaptation haven’t. Speaking with the Breakfast Club recently to promote the UMC series Monogamy, actress Jill Marie-Jones says there is a strong possibility for a Girlfriends movie.\n\n“We definitely all [the cast] want to do it,” she said. Marie-Jones played the iconic and bold Toni Childs. “I think it’s a timing thing and also the legal stuff. You sell a script you don’t actually own it anymore so [it’s] whatever CBS and Paramount want to do.”\n\nThe series also starred Trace Ellis Ross as the very bubbly Joan, Golden Brooks as the comical Maya and Persia White as the free-spirited Lynn. Created by Mara Brock Akil (Being Mary Jane) in 2000, the series was a hit on The CW (formerly UPN) and spawned the uber successful spin-off, The Game.\n\nThe show continued for eight seasons but never gave us a clear series finale.\n\nWillingness for a film version of Girlfriends was reportedly prevalent in its heyday. Speaking to Madame Noire in 2012, Reggie Hayes, who played the role of William, shared how talks of a movie were happening.\n\nhttps://w3.cdn.anvato.net/player/prod/v3/anvload.html?key=eyJtIjoiQU5WIiwidiI6IjQyMDY2MTIiLCJhbnZhY2siOiIyNnFZd1FWRzlwMUJrczJHZ0Jja2pmREpPWE9BTWdHMSIsInBsdWdpbnMiOnsiZGZwIjp7ImNsaWVudFNpZGUiOnsia2V5VmFsdWVzIjp7InBvc3RJRCI6IjIxNDU0NSIsIlRlc3QiOiJObyIsImNhdGVnb3J5IjoiY2VsZWJyaXR5LWludGVydmlld3MsZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudCx0dix2aWRlbyIsInRhZyI6ImdpcmxmcmllbmRzLHdoZXJlLXlvdS1iZWVuIn0sInN0YXJ0VGltZW91dCI6MTAsImZ1bGxBZENsaWNrYWJsZU9uTW9iaWxlIjp0cnVlLCJhZFRhZ1VybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcHViYWRzLmcuZG91YmxlY2xpY2submV0L2dhbXBhZC9hZHM%2Fc3o9NjAyeDQwMCZpdT0vNDA1Mi9tYWRhbWVub2lyZS92aWRlb3ByZXJvbGwmaW1wbD1zJmdkZnBfcmVxPTEmZW52PXZwJm91dHB1dD12YXN0JnVudmlld2VkX3Bvc2l0aW9uX3N0YXJ0PTEmdXJsPVtyZWZlcnJlcl91cmxdJmRlc2NyaXB0aW9uX3VybD1odHRwJTNBJTJGJTJGbWFkYW1lbm9pcmUuY29tJmNvcnJlbGF0b3I9W3RpbWVzdGFtcF0mY21zaWQ9MjQ2MTI0OSZ2aWQ9QU5WX0FOVl80MjA2NjEyIn19fSwiaHRtbDUiOnRydWUsInRva2VuIjoiczRjQzRFTnJhcV9pa2NZRk1jelBzQ2dVMExKYjh4MVIzVVJjTXNDcDFWOH5NbjR3ZmcifQ%3D%3D\n\n“They were toying with the idea for a while,” Hayes said of Brock Akil and executive producer Regina Y. Hicks. “I don’t know what happened with that, maybe [the idea] ran out of steam. I think the community needed something like [Girlfriends]. It was very popular with it’s audience, including younger black women.”\n\nRelive some funny Girlfriends moments below."
