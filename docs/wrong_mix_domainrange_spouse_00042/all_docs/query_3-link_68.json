        "text": "Lynch has yet to be cast, but Billy Bob Thornton's name has been kicked around.\n\nMax Payne\n\nMax Payne, adapted from the 3DRealms game, hits theaters on October 17 courtesy of 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe story stars Mark Wahlberg as maverick cop hell-bent on revenge against those responsible for the brutal murder of his family and partner. His obsessive investigation takes him on a nightmarish journey into a dark underworld. As the mystery deepens, Max is forced to battle enemies beyond the natural world and face an unthinkable betrayal\n\nJohn Moore, whose most recent projects include WWII drama Behind Enemy Lines, horror remake The Omen and airborne adventure Flight of the Phoenix, directed.\n\nThe movie also stars Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges, and Chris Bridges.\n\nMetal Gear Solid\n\nKurt Wimmer, the filmmaker behind sci-fi actioners Equilibrium and Ultraviolet, is the latest name to be associated with the writing and directing gig on the game-to-film adaptation of Metal Gear Solid.\n\nWhat exactly would the movie be about? It's unclear, but for his part, game creator Hideo Kojima has hinted that it might be different from any game storyline. \"Things one can express in a game are different of those in a movie,\" he said in a 2004 interview with Variety. \"It would have to be a very different script, almost a different story.\"\n\nWhat we do know is that writer-actor David Hayter, who has provided the voice for Solid Snake, the game's protagonist for years, will likely not be involved in the movie version. Hayter had pitched his take on the project to Konami, but they passed.\n\nPrince of Persia\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire helmer Mike Newell is directing the live-action adaptation of Prince of Persia, starring Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nGyllenhaal will play Dastan, a young prince in sixth century Persia who must join forces with Tamina (Gemma Arterton), a feisty and exotic princess, to prevent a villainous nobleman from possessing the Sands of Time, a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world.\n\nBen Kingsley plays the evil Nizam, who plots to kill his brother King Shahrman, blame it Dastan, and then nab the Persian throne for himself.\n\nThe script was penned by Doug Miro & Carlo Bernard, Boaz Yakin, and the game's creator, Jordan Mechner.\n\nPrince of Persia had been set for release next year, but it's been bumped by Disney to 2010.\n\nSpore\n\nA film based on EA's popular sim could be coming to the big screen.\n\n\"With Spore, we're looking way outside the game space, such as TV, movies, etc. We're basically planting the seeds to spread Spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game,\" creator Will Wright told Reuters in an interview in August.\n\nSpore begins in the primordial ooze, as players create a character from DNA that will grow, survive, and mate as it evolves from a single-celled organism to a fully-formed member of an establishing species. As more and more creatures inhabit the world, and as evolution forms the future, your species will join herds, clans, even civilizations. The more advanced the creatures of the planet grow, the more complex the strife of survival becomes.\n\nIt's a hugely customizable gaming experience that would certainly be a challenge to bring to the big screen.\n\nSpy-Hunter\n\nSpy-Hunter has been in development for some time now, but things on the project based on Midway's hit game appear to have slowed to a crawl.\n\nThe latest is that Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat filmmaker Paul W.S. Anderson has been tapped to write and direct the movie for Universal. Anderson joined the project last summer and at the time he told industry insider mag Variety that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is not currently set to play the title role, as had been the case when the project was first setup.\n\nThe movie follows a fighter pilot turned intelligence agent who does battle with a nefarious terrorist organization from behind the wheel of his fully armed G-6155 Interceptor vehicle. From inside the car, which has morphing capabilities that allow it to change from a car into a motorcycle, jet ski and submarine, he hunts the dangerous spies and assassins of Nostra, who engage him in their own sophisticated vehicles.\n\nStreet Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li\n\n20th Century Fox will release the new Street Fighter movie, about female fighter Chun Li, played by Kirsten Kreuk, in February.\n\nKreuk stars along with, Neil McDonagh (M. Bison), Chris Klein (Nash), Michael Clark Duncan (Balrog) and Robin Shou (Gen). Actress Moon Bloodgood stars as a new character, Detective Maya Sunee.\n\nSo, what's up with the flick focusing on Chun Li and clearly not including some of the videogame's most popular characters? Screenwriter Justin Marks wrote on the movie's blog, \"\"Think of the X-Men franchise,\" he wrote. \"Think of the way it started with a simple story of Wolverine trying to find a place in the world. And then it spawned an entire universe of amazing characters. If we didn't keep this movie grounded, we would risk turning Street Fighter into a parody of itself. And to those of us who are fans of fighting franchises, the last thing we want is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously\"\n\nRomeo Must Die helmer Andrzej Bartowiak is directing.\n\nTekken\n\nTekken, based on the long running and highly successful Namco video game franchise of the same name, is written by Alan McElroy (Spawn, The Marine) and directed by Dwight Little (Anacondas, Murder at 1600). The flick's fight choreography is handled by Dion Lam (Spider-Man 2, Doom, Red Cliff).\n\nSet in 2039, the film tells what happens as the greatest fighters from around the world come to compete in the last and greatest sporting event of all time, the Fist Tournament. After World Wars destroy much of civilization as we know it, the remaining territories are no longer run by governments, but by corporations the mightiest of which is Tekken. In order to keep the masses down, Tekken sponsors the Iron Fist Tournament in which fighters compete to the death for ultimate glory and receive a lifetime of stardom and wealth.\n\nThe story follows Jin Kazama, a street fighter that enters the tournament in order to avenge the death of his mother that he blames upon Tekken's powerful and controlling Chairman, Heihachi Mishima. He knows that the only way to get close enough to Mishima to kill him is to win the tournament. With the help of Lucas, an ageing Iron Fist Champion and fight trainer, Jin makes his way through the tournament, but in doing so, he begins to uncover his own past and inner demons as well as exposing a dark underbelly to Tekken that threatens the very existence of humanity.\n\nSource: http://movies.ign.com/articles/911/911650p1.html"
