        "text": "Alec Baldwin recently filed a motion to dismiss the charges he’s facing in the 2021 shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, but here’s what we know. Behind closed doors Alec’s legal team is hoping to negotiate a plea deal involving no jail time, a clear record, community service and a HUGE donation. Alec is concerned that a jury found armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed guilty in the case, so he’s secretly done a 180 and instructed his high-priced lawyers to make a deal!\n\nLast Sunday Billie Eilish named dropped her former choir teacher, Mandy Bringham, when she won her second Oscar for Best Original Song for What Was I Made For, from the Barbie movie. Other media outlets tracked down the teacher but only WE will tell you that Billie personally reached out to Mandy days after the historic win, and the two are getting together in the near future. Our source says Billie plans to offer Mandy a job on her team as, what else, a vocal coach.\n\nFor reality TV fans, the buzz this week was the final reunion episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and the current state of OG star, Kyle Richard’s marriage to estranged husband Maurico Umansky. We can tell you this tidbit: Despite Kyle not revealing many deets on the reunion, our well placed source says that marriage is kaput and a very friendly divorce is being negotiated. If there’s any divorce drama it will only be manufactured for next season of RHOBH, but the soon-to-be exes have already decided who gets what and may plan to live together as friends for a bit until their youngest daughter Portia turns 18 in two years.\n\nMeghan Markle made headlines when she debuted a new website which she eventually will use to hawk merchandise. Way back in November, we told you that Meghan and Harry were looking at wineries to sell their own wine and this latest venture goes along with that. Meghan hopes to be the next Martha Stewart and build an empire based around her kitchen skills, including her own wine as well as olive oils, jams, cookbooks, etc. Our source adds this tidbit you will only read here – Meghan’s Montecito neighbor and good pal Oprah Winfrey is an angel investor in the project.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nWe were the FIRST to tell you Melania Trump renegotiated her prenuptial agreement with her husband Donald and now we will be the FIRST to tell you that Donald’s ex-wife Marla Maples is renegotiating their divorce settlement. Last June we reported that Donald was trying to get Marla to join him on the campaign trail, hoping to give the appearance that’s he’s not a misogynistic serial cheater. Well Donald might get his wish because as part of their divorce settlement Marla agreed to a strict NDA, so she used that as an excuse not to say anything (good or bad) about him in public. Donald’s agreed to cancel the NDA and renegotiate her somewhat measly settlement. (measly since he claims to be a billionaire) Talks are happening now and if they come to terms, expect to see Marla gushing over Donald in the coming months.\n\nPhoto: Instagram – Marla and daughter Tiffany Trump\n\nWe were the first to tell you about Chris Appleton and Lukas Gage having marital problems, and now that they’re officially splitting up, we will be the first to tell you the break up might not be as clean as Chris expected. Although they have a prenuptial agreement already in place, one thing that it doesn’t cover is an NDA. Chris does a lot of celebrity hair, with Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez being two of his biggest clients. Lukas hung out with almost all of Chris’s celebrity clients, so now Chris wants to make sure their secrets are safe. My source says that Chris plans on being nice and generous in the split if Lukas signs a non-disclosure agreement covering all of Chris’ celebrity clients as part of a compensation package. It seems Lukas can be somewhat of a loose cannon, and Chris doesn’t want to risk alienating any of his A-list friends and clients, so THAT’S why he’s willing to part with more cash.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nNick Jonas is working overtime to make sure the honeymoon doesn’t end for him and Priyanka Chopra. Nick is determined not to follow in his older brother Joe’s footsteps and end up in a divorce, so he’s putting in the work to keep his marriage fresh. According to a friend, Nick was jolted into action as he watched Joe’s once happy marriage to Sophie Tucker self-destruct into to an unexpected split. Now he’s romancing Priyanka more than ever before. In addition to flowers and gifts, Nick has initiated date night, where he and Priyanka leave their daughter Malti with a sitter and go out for a romantic excursion. On September 27, they were spotted at The Polo Bar in NYC where they only seemed to have eyes for each other. They just seemed to break their love trance briefly, when Martha Stewart and designer Donna Karan waltzed in -the Jonases went to their table to say hello.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA"
