        "text": "Canadian Tennis pro Daniel Nestor has been around for a long period of time, playing at the highest level and representing Canada with pride in the Davis Cup, Grand Slams and ATP events around the world. Nestor had a lot more success playing doubles than he did as a singles player and he has undoubtedly left his mark on Canadian tennis and serves as an inspiration to the younger generation.\n\nNestor turned pro back in 1991 and announced his presence in style the following year after he took out Sweden’s Stefan Edberg in Vancouver during a 5 set Davis Cup match. Over the years, Nestor has teamed up with a number of doubles partners but arguably his best match was Mark Knowles from the Bahamas. Nestor has won at least one doubles title during the last 23 years and was also the first Canadian tennis pro to make $1 million in a season.\n\nNestor realizes that it is getting harder as he gets older. The 45 year old tennis pro has announced that he plans to walk away from the game in 2018. His final tournament will most likely be at the Rogers Cup which takes place in Toronto, his hometown or at the 2018 U.S Open which could be his final grand slam appearance. Nestor has been ranked number one in doubles on different occasions and has a 91 doubles titles to his name, which puts him in third place on the Open era list.\n\nATPWorldTour\n\nIn a statement, Nestor said\n\nIt has been in the back of my mind for sure. I mean obviously I wanted to play as long as I could and I've been fortunate to play as long as I have. But this last year has been pretty revealing as far as capabilities and ongoing success on tour\n\nSince 2013, Nestor has changed doubled partners a lot more frequently and has partnered with the likes of Rohan Bopanna from India and Edouard Roger-Vasselin from France but the results have not been coming and Nestor has fallen to number 45 on the rankings. There’s not a lot left for him to do or prove in the sport as in 2016 he became the first player in Open era history to reach 1,000 doubles wins.\n\nNestor is scheduled to represent Canada in a Davis Cup tie against India later this week and it will be his 51st Davis Cup appearance."
