        "text": "Daniel Nestor is the oldest tennis player in the men’s draw at this year’s U.S. Open. On Sunday, he will turn forty-four—that’s nine years older than Roger Federer, who is recovering from knee surgery and will not be in Flushing.\n\nNestor, a Canadian, won the Open back in 2004. Name doesn’t ring a bell? That’s because Nestor is a doubles specialist, and, while it’s said that eighty per cent of those who play recreational tennis play doubles, the game doesn’t get watched. At tournaments, there is seldom a doubles match on one of the main show courts. On ESPN and the Tennis Channel, you rarely see the game.\n\nMen’s doubles did get a fair amount of broadcast time during the Olympics—as a result of the young American duo Steve Johnson and Jack Sock making a deep run. You might have caught a glimpse of Nestor on Bravo one afternoon. He and his teammate, Vasek Pospisil, lost to the eventual gold-medal winners, Rafael Nadal and Marc López, in the semifinals, and then to Sock and Johnson in the bronze-medal match. Nestor was the tall, left-handed, slim-shouldered, creased-cheek one, unflashy and steady-nerved. That’s how you expect someone to play, maybe, when he’s won more than a thousand pro matches, something very, very few players—Federer, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, and, in doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan—have done.\n\nNestor, as he will be the first to tell you, has always been a quiet presence—competitive and intensely focussed, as any pro athlete must be, but soft-spoken and a little shy. He took up tennis in Toronto not long after his parents emigrated there from Belgrade, when he was four. (Nestor was born in Serbia; Pospisil’s parents are from the former Czechoslovakia; Milos Raonic was born in the former Yugoslavia. Where would Canadian men’s tennis be without its influx from Eastern Europe?) He spent a lot of time hitting balls against a wall and imagining he was Connors or Bjorn Borg. Like almost all doubles players on the tour, he began his career playing singles, and managed, in 1992, shortly after turning pro as a willowy nineteen-year-old, to beat Stefan Edberg, then ranked No. 1, in a Davis Cup singles match. Nestor himself was ranked No. 238, and, while he did soon enough crack the top hundred, his was a body prone to injury, and he lacked the baseline power that the men’s game had come to demand. He transitioned to doubles in 1994, teaming up with Mark Knowles, of the Bahamas. They spent a dozen years at the top of the doubles game: three Grand Slam titles (and nine Grand Slam finals appearances over all); three dozen other winners’ trophies; and, in 2002, the No. 1 ranking.\n\nThey split in 2007, a break initiated by Nestor, who, at thirty-five, was already an old man in tennis years, and was looking for a harder-slugging partner to counter the big and dominating game of the Bryan brothers, identical twins who have ruled doubles for much of the past fifteen years. He found Nenad Zimonjić, a hulky Serb four years his junior who had been having a good deal of success in mixed doubles. They were barely getting used to playing together when they beat the Bryans, in Hamburg, early in 2008, and then went on to capture Wimbledon. (Nestor has earned more than twelve million dollars in prize money during his long career, nearly all of it playing doubles.)\n\nI saw Nestor and Zimonjić, a couple of middle-aged guys, play a match at the U.S. Open two years ago. It was an early Friday afternoon—hot, cloudless, breezeless—and the grounds were overcrowded with ticketholders getting an early jump on Labor Day weekend. I was with my own doubles partner, John—we had qualified for a national sixty-and-older grass-court championship that would be taking place in a few weeks, and thought it might be instructive, not to mention fun, to watch Nestor do his thing up close. (We lost in the first round, by the way: 6–2, 6–4.) Out on Court 6, one of a set of three small, newly constructed outer courts, the stands were only half-filled, which is typical for a doubles match. Those on hand appeared to be divided between aging doubles aficionados like me and those wanting to sit somewhere with their summery, vodka-laced drinks. Nestor and Zimonjić entered in stylish black kits to scattered applause, followed by their opponents, a pair of unseeded Colombians. It would be no contest (6–2, 6–2), but I didn’t mind: I spent the seventy minutes or so watching Nestor. His McEnroe-like serve begins with a low bow and a high toss, and is delivered with a sweeping slice that can jam the returner or take him out wide on the add side. His approach to the net is unhurried, and his volleys are almost tender—and often enough out of reach once they land. And I watched him between points, as he positioned himself at the net, half-swinging his racquet over and over, in a kind of tai chi, then settling himself in the ready position, arms extended, elbows out, coming to an alert stillness that had something almost aura-like about it. Little would get past him. Late in the second set, a hard-struck, topspin-laden forehand came diving directly toward his midsection. He was maybe three feet from the net, but somehow, in a trice, managed to extend his left arm sideways and tilt his racquet head down toward his thighs. The ball glanced off his strings and spun back across the net at an inside-out angle so severe that it landed in the doubles alley, just below the umpire’s chair: an astonishing winner.\n\nTennis magazine’s_ _Steve Tignor wrote earlier this month that, to attract fans and TV producers, doubles needs the participation of the game’s marquee singles players. And to achieve that, he suggested, there was a ready incentive: base the rankings on combined singles and doubles results.\n\nThe top singles players used to play doubles, but that was because the prize awards in singles were modest in the first years of the Open era, and players paired up to make extra cash. The money has grown considerably, and, particularly on the men’s side, the game has become more gruelling: players need more time to recover from their singles matches than they once did. Rather than playing doubles, they get massaged and rest. It was a blast to watch Nadal chasing down lobs in Rio. But don’t expect to see him or Andy Murray or Novak Djokovic with doubles partners at the U.S. Open, or most anywhere other than the BNP Paribas Open, at Indian Wells, where singles players have traditionally played in some doubles matches to sharpen their net play at the beginning of the season.\n\nLater this week, though, as doubles matches begin at the Open, you can—for the price of the least expensive grounds-admission ticket—watch Nestor (with Pospisil as his partner) work his magic on one of the outer courts. It could be your last chance. He has started talking about life after doubles (coaching, maybe). He and his hair-trigger-reflex volleys, acute angles, and sly point creation have been around forever. But even forevers end."
