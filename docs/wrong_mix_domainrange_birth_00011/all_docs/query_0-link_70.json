Have just finished entering a file that has some info, but no references as to facts. John is thought to be the father of Ephraim Goad born @1805 in Anderson Co. TN.. File has Amos and another Aaron also listed as sons. These are the only kids listed, I'm sure there must be more. Also looking for the line of Goads that Irvin Polk Goad that married Fannie Bell Park fits into, Samuel Goad @1841 that married Albina Condra, and Holland Layton Goad @ mid 1800's that married Flora Georgia Flemming. If anyone has info on these Goads, please post info. Thanks, Don E.

James died in 1850.\n\nJames Goad of Montgomery County, Virginia. p. 26 The 1771 will of John Goad of Bedford County, Virginia named his children and the presumably oldest son of each of his four sons. James Goad was named as Abraham's oldest son. James married Mary Collier on July 24, 1786 in Pittsylvania County and was apparently born about 1765 or earlier. Census records conflict. When James was over 75 years of age, he accompanied his grandsons, John and Aaron B. Goad, to Kanawha County, West Virginia (Then Virginia) in the early 1840's The census of 1850 Kanawha County shows him and John living with the family of Aaron B. and gives the age of James as 92. That would date the year of his birth as about 1758. Mary Collier, wife of James, was his second cousin as her parents are believed to have Aaron and Elizabeht Goad Collier, she being a daughter of Abraham Goad of Pittsylvania County. All six of their children remained in the Carroll-Floyd area in Virginia to raise large families whose descendants own a fair portion of that part of Virginia today.\n\nChildren:\n\n19 + Catherine Kate3 Goad b. 1779 d.

Thomas (Tommie) was married to Sarah Betts.\n\nThe father of this lady would greatly add to the proof that this is the brother that moved to Tennessee with Joseph. The Carroll 1765-1815 says clearly that \"Thomas Phillips married polly Goad in 1798 in Montgomery County and went to Tennessee with his father-in-saw, Abraham Goad. It says that little is known of Joseph. Mrs. Phyllis G. Phillips says of this same family that Thomas was married a second time to Sarah Betts and from that marriage lists 4 children. Polly would have had to have a son Johnathan because Jehu says that Tommie and his brother Joseph and Tommies son Johnathan, whether Johnathan is Tommies or Josephs I can't tell by the way this is phrased, moved from what is now (1904) Scott Co. VA and Josh Goad which could be Abraham Goad refered to in the Carroll 1765-1815 book. This is the proof positive I need.\n\n!Thomas Phillips married Polly Goad in 1798 in Montgomery County, VA and went to Tennessee with his father-in-law, Abraham Goad. (Carroll 1766-1815, p. 135) These are the things I think link this Thomas to the Tommie that Jehu Phillips talks about in \"Reminiscences of Pioneer Days in Scott County, Tennessee\" published in the Cumberland Chronicle in the Spring of 1904. About 1803 Tommie Phillips, his brother Joseph Phillips and his son Johnathan Phillips and Josh Goad all moved from what is now Scott County, Virginia (1804) and settled about two miles south of Huntsville on what is now known as the Vanderpool place. In part six of his article Jehu says \" My grandfather, Tobie Phillips lived in Virginia and owned about 60 negros at one time. After he died and when I was about 18 years old I went with my father (Joseph Phillips) and Uncle John Phillips to Virginia to see my grandmother Phillips. She then had 42 slaves on her plantation.\n\nChildren:\n\n36 + Johnathin3 Phillips b. 10 Oct 1800 d. 2 Jan 1893\n\n37 + E.

Ayers Airs died on 16 Sep 1855 at Scott Co., Tn. Edith died in 1859 at Indiana.\n\nAyers went to Anderson Co. later Scott Co. Tn. with his father.\n\nAyres Goad of Greene County, Indiana - p.30 It is said that Ayres Goad came to Indiana from Tennessee with the James Roach family about 1820. Margaret \"Peggy\" Goad, daughter of Ayres, married Joshua Roach, son of James, and this couple came to Indiana about 1829. All settled in the vincinity of what is now Walnut Grove. The burial place of Ayres Goad and wife Edith is not known, but at least three of their children and many, many descendants are buried at Walnut Grove. The Greene County Goads were marked by two strong proclivities: (1) A tendency not to go far out of the Goad family when choosing a mate, with a strong preference for first cousins and (2) a marked tendency to have twins, a phenomena. Littleton by 1860 had fathered three sets of twins. In Peyton's household in 1870 are ten children all under the age of ten. Some could be nieces/nephews or foster children as two are four years old and three are listed as being age nine. As to further intermarriage between these Indiana Goads and their kin, the records show as follows: Between 1833 and 1876, Goads four times chose mates named Jones, three times their mates had the last name of Roach. Clement Quillen Goad married four time, the last two wives both being daughters of his uncle, Peyton Goad. Margaret who he wed in 1869 and Sally in 1875. Aaron Goad married Fanny Jones in 1833. In 1837, Peyton married Sophia Jones. Henry's second wife was Mary Roach (m. in 1864). The above Clement, son of Littleton, took as his first wife in 1858, Lucy Roach. It goes on. Jordan Goad, son of Littleton, married his first cousin Lucinda, daughter of Peyton, in 1856. Littlebury, son of Peyton, married a widow Sophia Watson, daughter of Peyton's brother, Littleton. In 1865, Abraham Goad, another son of Littleton, married Sarah Goad. She was born in 1835 so could have been a daughter of Aaron and Fanny. In 1833, a Littlebury married in Greene County, Anne Jackson. Their wedding was on July 29, one day after the marriage of Aaron Goad. In 1850, Ayres and Edith Goad were living among their children and grandchildren in Greene County, Indiana, both age 70, both born in Virginia. Ayres died in 1855 and his amended will was filed with the Greene County court on September 16, 1855. Ayres left all his land to two sons, Henry and Peyton. These were the two younger sons and the older sons may have previously been given land by their father. Edith was still living at this time and was provided for in the will. She probably died during the next five years, as she is not found on the 1860 census.\n\nChildren:\n\n40 + Amos3 Goad\n\n41 + Robert Goad\n\n42 + Jacob Goad b. 1804 d. 31 Jul 1874\n\n43 + Ephriam Goad b. 1805\n\n44 + Aaron Goad b. 1806\n\n45 + Littleberry Goad b. 1810 d.b 1850\n\n46 + Margaret GOAD-78 b. 1811\n\n47 + Frances Goad b. 1811\n\n48 + LITTLETON GOAD-79 b. 1812 d. 1891\n\n49 + Henry Goad b. 1817 d. 14 Jun 1884\n\n50 + Peyton GOAD-80 b. 1818 d. 1878\n\n51 + Priscilla Goad b. 1824\n\n52 + Ayres Goad b. 1835\n\n53 + Martha J.

Abram was a widower from Floyd County and Rachel bore him eight children. Rachel was named as oneof theheirs in1869 and five of her children were named inher stead in1870; it may be she died about 1869.\n\n(21) Aaron 'Aser'3 Goad, (James2, Abraham1) was born in 1790 at Montgomery Co., Va, and in 1822, married (97) Eleanor Cock, daughter of Reuben Cock and Rhoda Rhoda, who was born in 1795 at Virginia.

Eleanor died on 5 Mar 1888 at Carroll County, Virginia.\n\nAaron Goad, Jr., of Carroll County, Virginia. p. 42 He was a farmer Aaron served in Eastern Virginia near Norfold in the war of 1812. In 1822, he married Eleanor \"Nelly\" Cock, likely a cousin to Aaron. This proved to be a tragic family as two of their sons were killed at Resaca, Georgia on the same date, 5-15-1864, trying to blunt Sherman's drive for Atlanta. Undoubtedly the Goad cousins from Indiana, Tennessee and elsewhere wore the blue on that same fateful day in north Georgia. The fatalities at Resaca were Hiram and Iredell Goad. Before the war, Aaron and Nellie lost another son, Aaron Richard, when the small boy crawled under a porch and his mother, trying to coach him out, used a stick to poke at him. The stick struck the lad in a vital spot, perhaps the temple and the boy died. Nellie survived into the 1880's and, in later years, drew a pension for Aaron's service in the War of 1812.\n\nChildren:\n\n98 + Hiram4 GOAD-177 d. 15 May 1864\n\n99 + Iredell GOAD-180 d. 1864\n\n100 + Aaron Richard Goad\n\n101 + Tyre William GOAD-178\n\n102 + Byrum GOAD-179\n\n103 + Clarissa GOAD-181\n\n104 + Henderson Goad b. 10 Sep 1825 d. 19 Oct 1919\n\n(22) Agnes3 Goad, (James2, Abraham1) was born about 1800 at Carroll Co., Va, and on 29 Feb 1816 at Patrick Co., Va, married (105) James Jennings, son of William Jennings and Elizabeth Ogle, who was born about 1794 at Carroll Co., Va.

Hughett (b. 1793). The John Hughett Hughett who married Elizabeth Howell was John W. Hughett, born 1797 in Montgomery County, VA, married Mellie Elizabeth Howell in 1815 in Indian Valley, Floyd County, VA, died 8/28/1854. He was the son of William E. Hughett (1758 - 1837) and Elizabeth Goad (1767 to about 1850). I believe that William E. Hughett lived in Floyd County until his death. Elizabeth might have moved on TN after William's death. I am a descendant of William & Elizabeth Goad Hughett (as well as John W and Elizabeth Howell Hughett). If you have any info on any of them, I'd love to have it, especially date of death on Elizabeth Goad Hughett.\n\nThe change in spelling from Hughett to Hewitt and back is fairly common. To make it more difficult, census takers and court reporters often switched it back and forth too. Makes tracking difficult.\n\nI am not descended from the Frank Hughett who married Amanda Robbins, but I have quite a bit of Hughett family info, even though much of it is only distant cousins.\n\nAs for Rachel Hughett, (b 3/20/1858, died 9/4/1940 (buried in Robbins Cemetery, Scott County)) I show her to have married John W. Newport on 1/3/1876 in Scott County. They had 4 children - Joe, K.K., Della, and Roena. I don't show Rachel with another spouse. I have no info on Joseph Goad.\n\nI'll be happy to send you a GEDCOM file of the Hughett descendants. There are a number of Phillips, Goads, Robbins and Sexton in it.

Aaron B. died on 5 Nov 1895 at Carroll County, Virginia.\n\nAaron B. Goad led a rather unconventional life. He had married and fathered a son in 1842 in Carroll county, had almost immediately deserted that family and presumably sired a second family in Kanawha County. There were four young children in the 1850 Goad household. On the eve of the Civil War, he had apparently deserted his second family, returned to Carroll County. Perhaps he planned to return to Kanawha but was prevented by the war. The Confederate Army early lost the Kanawha Valley to Union forces. Aaron returned to Elizabeth and John Henry after an absence of eighteen years and that very forbearing lady took him back and bore him two more children. They moved to Missouri after the war and presumably, Aaron never saw his Kanawha family again. The Confederate military records show that in 1864, Aaron was serving in Company F, 4th Virginia Reserves, a unit of home guards for young boys and men over forty. Letter copied from Ken's book: A letter which was penned by a George W. Goad, an elderly lawyer of Springfield, Missouri is as follows: Springfield, Mo. May 31, 1939 Mr. A.J. Goad Eagle Grove, Iowa \"Replaying to your letter 29th inst will state that I am the son of Aaron Goad who lived in Carroll County, Virginia and moved with his family to Missouri and settled near Appleton City sometime about 1870. He lived near Apleton City until his death on November 5, 1895. I was born in Carroll County September 19, 1863, and am still in fairly good health. I have practiced law since the Spring of 1887. I married June 26, 1890 and on August 6, 1890 came to Springfield where I still reside. Our family records were destroyed in a fire. However, I am of the impression that my father was about 70 of age at his death.

John died on 3 Jul 1887 at Roane County, Virginia. Mary Jane died on 29 Jun 1932 at Kanawha County, Virginia.\n\nJohn Goad of Roane County, West Virginia p. 41. The 1850 census of Roane County, West Virginia shows John living in the household of brother Aaron, but by 1860, he was the father of three sons and a daughter. His where-abouts during the Civil War is uncertain but he was not with his family in West Virginia. It is likely that he accompanied Aaron back to Floyd County and enlisted in the Confederate Army. After the war, John returned to Roane County and led an exemplary life including that of a school teacher and farming. In adition, he served as sheriff, court commissioner and justice of the peace. John migrated with his brother, Aaron B. and his grandfather, James Goad, to Kanawho County, Virginia about 1843. He married there to Mary Jane Taylor. The 1850 census shows John living in the household of brother Aaron but, by 1860, he was the father of three sons and a daughter. His where-abouts during the Civil War is uncertain, but he was not with his family in West Virginia. It is likely that he accompanied Aaron back to Floyd County and enlisted in the Confederate Army. It was often not difficult after the war to know the sympathies of families by how they named their children. Jackson was likely named for \"Stonewall\" Jackson, a native of nearby Clarksburg, West Virginia and Albert Johnson was almost certainly for General Albert Sidney Johnson who fell at Shiloh. John's children scattered into far-away states, Missouri, Minnesota, and even Canada.

As a member of Kemper's Brigade, Pickett's Division, participated on July 3, 1863 in the famous \"Pickett's Charge\" at Gettysburg and was captured by the Union forces. As a prisoner-of-war, he took the other of allegiance to the United States and became a \"galvanized rebel\", these being ex-Confederates who joined the Union Army with the proviso that they would not be compelled to face their former comrades in battle. These men were used against the Indians in the West, releasing other Union soldiers for battlefield duty in the South. They were scorned by the true \"Red\" purists but, considering the conditions and high mortality in Civil War prison camps, north and south, such a decision was understandable. After the War, \"Hen\" was apparently divorced from his first wife and he re-married Julia (Webb) Goad, widow of his distant cousin, Robert Goad, youngest son of Spencer Goad and grandson of Robert Goad of Grayson County.
