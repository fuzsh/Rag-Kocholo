        "text": "Bio Nestor’s achievements make him one of the most decorated doubles players in the history of the sport. Nestor was actually inducted into the Canadian Tennis Hall of Fame in 2018. In 2009, he became the first player – singles or doubles – to win all four Grand Slams as well as the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments. He won 12 doubles titles at Grand Slams, took part in six Olympic games – taking home a gold medal – and represented Canada during 52 Davis Cup ties.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2018, Nestor did not miss a single edition of the Rogers Cup. Throughout his time at the tournament, he was notably crowned doubles champion on two occasions in 2000 and 2008, reached the final three times – the last time being in Montreal in 2015 – and the semi-finals on eight other occasions. At the start of his career, Nestor also had some good success in singles. In fact, he managed to move past the first round five times. His best results came in 1996, in Toronto, when he reached the third round by defeating Austrian Thomas Muster, then world no. 2.\n\nNestor along with Aleksandra Wozniak were inducted on Centre Court at IGA Stadium during the Rogers Cup in Montreal in 2019."
