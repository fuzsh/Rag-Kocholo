        "text": "Profession: Tennis Player\n\nBiography: Goran Ivanišević is a Croatian tennis player, best known for being the only wildcard to win the Wimbledon men's singles championship. He was admitted to the competition in 2001 despite being ranked number 125 in the world, but this was because of his having suffered a shoulder injury.\n\nIvanišević had reached the finals at Wimbledon three times prior in 1992, 1994, and 1998. He was ranked world number 2 in July of 1995.\n\nSince retiring, Ivanišević has served as a coach for Marin Čilić (2013-2016) and, since 2019, for Novak Djokovic. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nBorn: September 13, 1971\n\nBirthplace: Split, Croatia\n\nAge: 52 years old"
