It was at this time that he met and fell in love with his future wife Beverly Ann Duerkop. They were married in 1958 and were with each other through all of life's ups and downs. After graduating college he got his first job as an Industrial Arts high school teacher in Hammond, Indiana. He loved it and would later accept a job teaching Industrial Arts in Montgomery County, MD. While teaching in MD, he earned a Master’s degree in Industrial Education from the University of MD–College Park and continued to teach in the Montgomery County Public School system for the remainder of his long teaching career up until retirement.\n\nIt was in Gaithersburg, MD where Pat and Bev would raise their three children, Daniel, Michael and Kara. Pat was a wonderful and devoted Christian, husband, father, teacher and friend. He always taught us to stay devoted to our faith, family and friendships, and supported his children throughout the many accomplishments and challenges of their lives. When he wasn't working, and after retirement, he could be found in his workshop at home working on his many woodcrafts for the family interior design business, or, as an active member of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, volunteering and participating in fellowship and service activities. If you know Pat, he genuinely loved hearing or telling a good joke.\n\nPat was predeceased by his parents, Patsy, Sr. and Angie, his step-mother Filomena “Fannie” Iannone and siblings Peter and Delores.

He was beyond proud of and dedicated his adult life to being a stay-at-home dad. On December 20, 1991 he married Ann Marie Zajdel. They raised three daughters, Sarai, Aja and Cayenne, and one son, Elijah.\n\nPeter was a history buff and lover of philosophy. His avid curiosity would always lead him to pick up the latest non-fiction book, and his eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge and truth would manifest itself in the conversations he had. He portrayed his love for music in his massive album collection. Often, the whole neighborhood would unwillingly indulge in The Beatles, Neil Young and JJ Grey & Mofro. He was known for his goofy dances, his boisterous laugh, and his uncompromising protection of his family.\n\nPeter was preceded in death by his father, Richard, his brother, Richard, and father-in-law, Thomas.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Ann, his four children, Sarai (Donald), Aja (Alex-Marie), Elijah, and Cayenne, his granddaughter Faye (Sarai), his mother Christine Matlock, his mother-in-law Mary Zajdel, his sisters, Tessa Hemmingway (Robert), Tiffney Martin (Austin), his brother Jarrod Matlock (Kim), and several cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.\n\nA celebration of life will be held on Saturday, June 18 at the Matlock residence at 2pm.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) and register to become a bone marrow donor at bethematch.org.\n\nMyrtle Lou Nestor, 86, of Beallsville, MD, was called home to Heaven on Wednesday, June 8, 2022.\n\nMarried for 61 years, she was the most beloved wife of E.

Singh, lovingly known as “Madam Singh” by many, was born in Agra, India on January 13, 1942. She completed her high school education from Howard Plasted Girls Higher Secondary School in Meerut. After her high school, she moved back to Agra to attend St. John’s College, where she completed her bachelor’s degree and later completed master’s in Education, Geography and Hindi from Agra University. Upon graduation, she started teaching at Air Force school in Agra and laid the foundation of the first Central School in Agra. Mom was an outstanding role mode, a brilliant student and a talented singer. She was an active member of her school and church choir and even sang the Indian National Anthem with the renowned singer Mrs. Lata Mangeshkar during her college years.\n\nShe married Gladwin Singh, our father on October 21, 1968, at Central Methodist Church in Agra. She took a teaching job at Central School, Andrews Ganj in Delhi and retired as the Principal of Central School, Rohini, Delhi. Mom touched lives of many young children with her practical, yet gentle disciplinarian approach. Some of her favorite quotes from her education career are – “Success must be continually won and not reaching a goal”, “Don’t let your past determine your future”, “Be Humble always, a tree that is loaded with fruits always bends towards the ground”, and one of her favorite verses is, “Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it.” Proverbs 22:6. Mom was a kindhearted, caring, loving and generous person. She truly enjoyed watching her students grow into young adults ready to embark on new journeys in colleges and different careers and fields. She developed a special bond with many of her students and remained in close contact with them. She supported many orphanages in India and brought several young people out of poverty and illiteracy.\n\nOur mom was a godly woman who loved the Lord and her family and set an example for her children and grandchildren. She was a true prayer warrior and loved attending and leading Bible studies. She graciously served many people through prayers and outreaches and nurtured the same spirit in her children and grandchildren. She was a source of blessing and encouragement for many who were in her sphere of influence with her unwavering faith in God. Another one of her favorite verses from the Bible is, “With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.” Matthew 19:26. Her love and devotion to the Lord and to her family was amazing to witness. Our mom was always a pillar of strength for our family. Mom loved to work in her yard and garden. She was a great cook and loved cooking for her family and friends, and trying new recipes. Her gentle approach to prayer, words of wisdom and glowing smile will always be remembered by all who knew her.\n\nMom was undoubtedly the best devoted wife, sister, mother, grandmother, friend, educator and a faithful follower of God. While mom’s body returns to dust at the Monocacy Cemetery, 19801 W Hunter Rd, Beallsville, MD 20839, we know as believers that she is absent in her body but very much present in her spirit before the Lord. Mom has now received her reward of eternal life, full of true joy, peace, and pure fullness of abundant life; enjoying the unexplainable joy of being with her living and loving Lord Jesus Christ forever!!!\n\nMom - we love you very much, and one day we'll be together with you in heaven. In Jesus’ name, Amen!\n\nFred Allen Swick, of Poolesville, a beloved Montgomery County teacher and coach, passed away at the age of 70 on June 29, 2021, after a courageous seven-year battle with multiple myeloma.\n\nFred was born on April 17, 1951, to Allen and Lou Swick in Winchester, VA. His parents predeceased him. The Swick family moved to Maryland, where Fred grew up in the Rockville- Twinbrook area with his three brothers, Mark, David and Todd. After graduating from Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville in 1969, Fred went on to play basketball and study physical education at Montgomery College and Frostburg State University.\n\nAn accomplished basketball player with a deadly outside shot (and remember, this was way before the three-pointer!), Fred was second team All-County at Richard Montgomery his senior year. Fred would go on to play at Montgomery College, earning First Team All-State Junior College honors, and at Frostburg, from which he graduated in 1974.\n\nIn the fall of 1970, while a student at Montgomery College, Fred met Donetta Hyre of Wheaton. They married on July 29, 1972. Fred and Donetta shared a love for family, especially enjoying their annual family beach vacations in the Carolinas and frequent trips to Disney World. During their 50 years together, they liked to take road trips to various cities and states, some of their favorites being trips to Hawaii, New Orleans, Memphis, and San Francisco, and finally made it to Italy in 2018.\n\nFred began his career in 1974 as an elementary physical education teacher at Garrett Park Elementary in Kensington. He then taught at North Bethesda and Randolph Junior Highs, followed by several years as a PE teacher and coach at Albert Einstein and Walter Johnson High Schools. A Poolesville resident since 1979, Fred was delighted when a physical education teaching position opened at Poolesville High School, and in 1983, he became the head boys basketball coach at PHS. By the time he accepted the Poolesville Athletic Director position in 2006, he was already the all-time winningest coach in both boys and girls basketball history at the school. He had similar success coaching baseball for 13 years, football for ten years, and softball for four years, all while teaching five classes a day.\n\nAfter retiring as the school’s Athletic Director, Fred returned to coaching in 2010. His girls basketball teams went 20-4 in 2015-16, 21-4 in 2016-17, 27-0 in 2017-18, 19-5 in 2018-19 and 20-5 in 2019-20. His undefeated team in 2017-18 would give him and Poolesville High School a long-awaited State Championship. As humble a man as he was, Fred would never flaunt that accomplishment, but that team and season was something of which he was immensely proud.\n\nFred loved and was devoted to teaching and working with children. When he wasn’t teaching and coaching as part of his employment, Fred ran basketball camps in Poolesville, including the Falcon Basketball Camp, and helped coach some of his grandchildren’s basketball and baseball teams.\n\nFred enjoyed Friday-morning breakfasts with his retired PHS buddies, and playing golf with them and many of his former players/students, so many of whom became life-long friends. He and Donetta kept busy in retirement attending and supporting their grandkids’ various games and performances.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Fred is survived by his children, Andy and his wife, Christina of Darnestown; Kelly and her husband, Ted Gardiner of Urbana, and his six beautiful grandchildren, Maddie, Brady, and Emmy Gardiner, and Lily, Rhett, and Wyatt Swick, all of whom he loved dearly and brought him great joy and pride.\n\nAn open-air service to celebrate Fred’s well-lived life will be held at Whalen Commons in Poolesville on Wednesday, July 7, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. Attendees are encouraged to dress comfortably and bring lawn chairs or blankets to sit on. A private inurnment will be held at a date to be determined.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be made to Girls on the Run (girlsontherun.org) or Good Sports (goodsports.org), a nonprofit organization providing lifelong benefits of sport and physical activity by providing equipment, apparel, and footwear to children in need.\n\nWinsome S. Brown, a homemaker and community volunteer, passed away on June 3rd in her sleep at home in Dickerson, Maryland at the age of 97.\n\n​\n\nThe former Winsome Sylvia Drage was born in Bozeat, England. She was the daughter of Cyril Neal Drage and Phyllis Scouse.\n\n​\n\nIn 1946 she married R. Edwin Brown whom she met in England when he was stationed nearby at the Poddington Air Base during World War II.\n\n​\n\nDuring WWII Winsome was a veteran of the British Land Army and a long- time member of the Daughters of the British Empire.
