        "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia – There was a chance at the beginning of the day Tuesday that the two best Canadian doubles players could face each other in the Australian Open men’s doubles semi-finals.\n\nWith most of the top seeds already gone home, the trophy is legitimately up for grabs.\n\nOne of the Canadians made the date – and it wasn’t young Vasek Pospisil, the 2014 Wimbledon champion with American partner Jack Sock.\n\nInstead, it was 43-year-old Daniel Nestor, playing what almost certainly will be the final full season of his career, and 37-year-old partner Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic.\n\nNestor and Stepanek, unseeded, defeated the No. 14 seeds Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Treat Huey of the Philippines, 6-4, 6-4 in their quarterfinal match Tuesday.\n\nHere's a look at how they did it.\n\nEarlier in the day, Pospisil and Sock, seeded No. 9, were upset by No. 16 seeds Marcel Granollers of Spain and Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 in a match that Sock probably wishes he could do over again.\n\nThey will now meet Nestor and Stepanek.\n\nIt was an opportunity gone by the wayside for Pospisil and Sock although it probably means a lot less to them than it does to Nestor and Stepanek, who have far fewer years in front of them to fight for doubles Grand Slam trophies.\n\nOf the top six teams, only No. 1 seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau even made it to the quarterfinals, and they lost to the unseeded French duo of Adrian Mannarino and Lucas Pouille.\n\nTo say those two, whose doubles rankings are both outside the top 200, were long shots to make it this far is to understate the case.\n\nThe other team in the semis is the No. 7 duo of Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares – a new team for 2016 – who now have to be considered the favourites.\n\n“The last nine straight Slams have had different winners in doubles, so it’s not that surprising,” said Nestor, who has made the semi-finals of a major just once since winning the 2012 French Open; that came two years ago here, with Nenad Zimonjic.\n\nThe man appears rejuvenated, due in no small part to the amusingly boyish enthusiasm of Stepanek,whose energy belies his years.\n\nNestor is chest-bumping, smiling constantly, pumping his fist more than we can ever remember seeing him – and playing good tennis although it was Stepanek who was the star of the team Tuesday with his strong return game.\n\nThe Canadian said that he hasn’t often played with that type of partner, one whose energy is so contagious.\n\n“He’s leading, he does that very well. When someone has that energy, it’s easy to feed off it. I haven’t really had partners like that over the years; that’s why I really enjoy the experience,” Nestor said. “It’s similar to playing with (Leander) Paes. We didn’t play as well, but I really enjoyed playing with him, because he’s really positive.”\n\nNestor had zero expectations coming into Melbourne; he and Stepanek were a new partnership, and they lost their first match in their first tournament together in Brisbane when Nestor was going for career victory No. 1,000 (He got it the next week, paired up with world No. 1 Marcelo Melo).\n\n“I’m obviously excited, I haven’t been in this situation in awhile. I’ll make the most of it,” Nestor said. “We’re at the stage of the tournament now where we have to just go for it, really swing away. We’re not going to win playing safe – especially not me, at my age. I have to be quite aggressive, and just go for my shots.\n\nNestor said that the vibe felt a little similar to when he played with Edouard Roger-Vasselin last summer; they had a good run before the Frenchman went back to countryman and regular partner Julien Benneteau, who had been injured.\n\nBut clearly the semi-final effort has exceeded his expectations.\n\nIt seems, in the end, to stem from good chemistry – and a low-maintenance relationship."
