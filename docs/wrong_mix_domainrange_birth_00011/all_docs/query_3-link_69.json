        "text": "The Masters is one of those sporting occasions that people eagerly anticipate. Which got us thinking: what Canadian tennis players have a version of themselves in golf? When it concerns personality, style, and efficiency, we can make a lot of great comparisons.\n\nSo here’s what the Tennis Canada team found.\n\nMilos Raonic/ Brooks Koepka\n\nWhen Milos Raonic and Brooks Koepka board a brief or a green, it’s serious. Both are very expert and can certainly be referred to as stoic. Calm and calm, they participate in their sport without excessive emotion.\n\nOne of the primary qualities of these high-performance athletes is their strength and large power. Everyone knows that Raonic has one of the– if not the most dominant services on the ATP Trip. The 28-year-old is presently ranked 4th for the largest variety of aces produced this year (341) and initially for the percentage of points Made on his first ball (83.8 %). Koepka, 28, double champ of the U.S. Omnium, looks a lot like him when he calms down on the starting Tertre, slapping the golf ball an average of 300.5 backyards, which puts him in the sixth put on the PGA circuit.\n\nEugenie Bouchard/ Michelle Wie\n\nIn addition to being excellent friends, they have experienced similar profession paths in their respective sport.\n\nBouchard increased to the top of the WTA standings thanks to a remarkable 2014 when she reached the semi-finals of the Australian and Roland-Garros Internationals in addition to the final of Wimbledon. As an outcome of these efficiencies, she became the top-ranked Canadian gamer in history, ending up fifth in October. Ever since the 25-year-old has been grappling with injuries that are destroying his consistency.\n\nWie attracted attention at the age of 10 when she became the youngest player to receive a USGA Amateur Champion. In 2005, she signed up with the pros just before her 16th birthday. The American has done wonderful things, including winning the U.S. Women’s Omnium and completing second at the ANA Motivation in 2014. Unfortunately, lots of injuries– mainly to the wrist-diverted his career.\n\nFélix Auger-Aliassime/ Rory McIlroy\n\nAt the age of 18, Rory McIlroy was referred to as the next fantastic golf enthusiast, and he didn’t disappoint. In 2009, when he was 19, he signed his first expert accomplishment at the Dubai Desert Classic. Northern Ireland’s first win in the PGA Champion goes back to 2011 at the US Open. What makes him so remarkable is his versatility. The abilities of Félix Auger-Aliassime are transferable to any surface and, like McIlory, has the possible to be a dominant force for several years to come.\n\nAfter winning the juniors, the 18-year-old Canadian has a record of 79 wins and 19 losses for the specialists. He won the leading honors of the United States Junior International and was a finalist in the junior events at Roland-Garros in 2016. Like McIlory, Felix made waves at the beginning of his profession. This year once again, he became the youngest finalist in an ATP 500 competition at the Rio Open, and a month later on, he was completing in the semi-final of the Miami Open. At 29, McIlory holds 24 expert victories and 4 significant champions, while Felix is on track for a similarly successful career.\n\nBianca Andreescu/ Brooke Henderson\n\nBianca Andreescu and Brooke Henderson are the same. These young Canadian women have rapidly entered the worldwide arena and seem determined to remain close to the summit for a very long time."
