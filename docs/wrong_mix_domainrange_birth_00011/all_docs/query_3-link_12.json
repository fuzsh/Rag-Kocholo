        "text": "In 1992, the year the Toronto Blue Jays won the first World Series in franchise history, the Australian Open was only four years into its new home, at Melbourne Park, and Daniel Nestor, a lanky left-hander from Toronto, made his debut in a Grand Slam. He is back this week, a quarter-century later, for what is almost certainly his last visit as a professional player. Nestor has announced this year will be his last on tour, so as the season begins, The Athletic examines the scope and context of his remarkable career.\n\nWait, why are we talking about Daniel Nestor?\n\nAt 45, Nestor is the oldest man still on the ATP Tour. He is also the elder statesman of Canadian tennis, and has been for some time. Nestor turned professional in 1991, eight years before Canadian wunderkind Denis Shapovalov was born. (Shapovalov turns 19 in April.)\n\nIn a September interview with Sportsnet, Nestor told Arash Madani he will retire after playing in either the Rogers Cup (his 30th), in August, or after the U.S. Open, the season’s final major, in September.\n\nNestor has been a doubles specialist for most of his career, which often pushes his accomplishments under the radar. Doubles, after all, does not earn prime court assignments, nor is it a ratings driver for broadcasters.\n\nSo, what’s he accomplished?\n\nAt the risk of getting too technical: A lot.\n\nNestor is the most decorated player in Canadian tennis history — man or woman — and he has won just about every significant event that can be won. He owns 12 Grand Slams titles (eight in men’s doubles and four in mixed) and an Olympic gold medal. He is a member of the elite Golden Grand Slam club, meaning he has won all four majors and an Olympic gold at least once in his career. Along with every Slam, he’s also won all nine Masters 1000 events at least once and the year-end ATP Tour Finals four times.\n\nHe has 91 men’s doubles titles, third-most in the Open Era, behind only Mike and Bob Bryan, the celebrated American siblings. He won those titles with 11 different partners, seeing most of his success with Mark Knowles, Nenad Zimonjić and Max Mirnyi.\n\nNestor first reached the No. 1 ranking in men’s doubles in August 2002, and has spent a combined total of 108 weeks as the top-ranked man over his career.\n\nAlong with his many trophies, Nestor also became the first doubles player in ATP history to win 1,000 career matches, reaching the milestone in January 2016 (his tally is now at 1,057). The only other singles players to reach 1,000 or more before Nestor are Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and Roger Federer. Meanwhile, the Bryan brothers have since achieved the feat after Nestor.\n\nYou mentioned an Olympic gold medal?\n\nWhy yes. In 2000, Nestor, along with partner Sébastien Lareau, won gold at the Sydney Olympics, the first — and only — medal Canada has won in tennis at the Summer Games.\n\nThe pair had played together before Sydney, but, at the urging of Lareau, joined up — and in turn split with their partners on the Tour — ahead of the Games in the hopes of making a run for gold. The bet paid off, with the Canadian pair upsetting the hometown favourites, Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde.\n\n“It did take me a little while to think about it because of my good relationship with Mark (Knowles),” Nestor told the Globe and Mail after the gold-medal win. “But once sitting down and thinking about it, it was obviously an easy decision.”\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of competing for Canada, Nestor has worn the maple leaf during a national record 51 Davis Cup ties, compiling a 33-11 record in doubles (and a 48-26 record overall).\n\nOutside of tennis accomplishments, Nestor has been appointed to the Order of Canada, he has a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame and he earned an honorary doctorate from York University in 2012.\n\nWhat about his singles career?\n\nNestor’s greatest success has certainly come in doubles, but the lefty still had a respectable singles career. He reached his career-high singles ranking of 58 in 1999, the same year he made the fourth round at Wimbledon, his best result at a Grand Slam. He lost to eventual champion Pete Sampras in straight sets.\n\nBut one of Nestor’s most memorable wins as a singles player came early in his career.\n\nIn 1992, a 19-year-old Nestor beat Stefan Edberg, the world’s No. 1 tennis player at the time, over five thrilling sets during a Davis Cup tie against Sweden. It was one of the most surprising upsets in tennis history at the time, and remains one of the best wins this country has ever seen.\n\nBack then, Nestor was a relative unknown outside of national tennis circles and his win made him the youngest Canadian to win a Davis Cup match (that feat now belongs to Shapovalov, who won a Davis Cup match in 2016 at 17 years, 156 days).\n\nWhile it was the biggest win of his career to that point, The Canadian Press reported the notably shy Nestor “showed little emotion during the monumental upset.”\n\nCanada would go on to lose the tie, but the victory made Nestor an instant star — something that proved daunting for the young player. A few days after his big win, along with his parents and brother, a media scrum was awaiting his arrival at home, inside Toronto’s Pearson airport.\n\n“Nothing like this has ever happened to us before,” he told reporters that day. “We’re all a little shy.”\n\nHow have his results on the tour been lately?\n\nWell, as the saying goes, in sports, Father Time is undefeated.\n\nHe had a tough season last year. It was the first time Nestor failed to win a title since 1993, ending a run of 22 years. Last year, Nestor lost more doubles matches (30) than he won (21) and after starting the year ranked 15th in the world, he fell to 56th by the end of the season.\n\nHe is currently ranked No. 55.\n\n“Not having the results I’m accustomed to is not that much fun either,” Nestor told Sportsnet in September. “I’m still very professional and will do the best I can until next summer, but after that, I think it probably makes sense to call it.”\n\nBut can he win another major?\n\nWhile he is a no doubt future Hall of Famer, Nestor will be in tough to win another Grand Slam. Perhaps, though, it’s a good omen that his last Slam title came in Melbourne in 2014. Playing with France’s Kristina Mladenovic, the unseeded pair won the mixed doubles title, defeating Sania Mirza and Horia Tecau in the final.\n\nHis last Slam final in men’s doubles came in 2016, also at the Austalian Open, when Nestor and partner Radek Stepanek (now retired and part of Novak Djokovic’s coaching team) lost to Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares. The last time Nestor captured a men’s doubles title was in 2012, when he won his fourth French Open title.\n\nOne thing that is different in the twilight years of his career versus his prime is that Nestor has not played with the same partner consistently. In 2017, as his ranking tumbled, Nestor played with 11 different partners. After playing with Austrian Philipp Oswald and American Donald Young to start this season, he will pair up with Israel’s Jonathan Erlich at the Australian Open, his third partner in as many events.\n\nNestor and Erlich will face Hyeon Chung and Radu Albot in the first round. Should Nestor-Erlich win, they could meet the second-seeded pair of Henri Kontinen and John Peers.\n\nSo what will Canada do without Nestor?\n\nWell, first, Canadian tennis fans can make sure to savor the last 12 months they have with him on tour (#NestorForever).\n\nThere’s no denying Nestor has been a mainstay of the doubles circuit for a long time, and he will be missed when he retires. Not only is he among the most revered doubles players ever, he may well be the best Canadian tennis player this country has ever produced (if Milos Raonic, Eugenie Bouchard, Denis Shapovalov, et al. go on to singles glory, we can open that up for debate) in terms of success on the tennis circuit.\n\nNestor helped pave the way for Canadian tennis, often leading the charge as the top-ranked Canadian on tour before the country’s young stars arrived on the scene.\n\n“Being from Toronto, the big guy there was always Daniel Nestor,” said Shapovalov at September’s Davis Cup tie in Edmonton, where he was teammates with the big guy.\n\n“Daniel would come and watch all of us play,” Shapovalov told reporters. “For me, it was so motivating to see Danny over there.”\n\n(Top photo: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports)"
