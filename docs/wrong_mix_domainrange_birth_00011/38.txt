Canada’s Daniel Nestor was one of the best doubles players of his era. In a 27-year career Nestor won all four Grand Slams, two mixed doubles Grand Slam titles, and Olympic gold, and was ranked the #1 doubles player in the world. He was the first player to win 1,000 ATP doubles matches.

Born in Beograd, Yugoslavia, Nestor moved to Toronto with his parents just before he turned four. He turned professional in 1991 and won his first ATP doubles title in 1994 at the Bancolombia Open in Colombia, with long-term partner Mark Knowles. From 1995 to 2016 Nestor won a further 90 ATP doubles titles, the majority with Knowles, as well as multiple titles with Sébastien Lareau, Nenad Zimonjić, and Max Mirny. At Masters 1000 finals Nestor won a further 28 titles, again the majority with Knowles.

Between 2002 and 2012 Nestor won the doubles title at all four Grand Slams. His first title came at the 2002 Australian Open with Mark Knowles. Nestor would again partner Knowles when they won the title at the 2004 US Open. He won back-to-back Wimbledon titles in 2008 and 2009 with Nenad Zimonjić. His most successful tournament was the French Open, where he won four titles; 2007 with Knowles, 2010 with Zimonjić, and 2011 and 2012 both with Max Mirnyi. In the mixed doubles Nestor won four Grand Slam titles. Three of them came at the Australian Open; 2007 with Yelena Likhovtseva, 2011 with Katarina Srebotnik, and 2014 with Kristina Mladenovic. The Nestor- Mladenovic partnership was also successful at the 2013 Wimbledon tournament.

Nestor competed at six successive Olympic Games from 1996 to 2016, competing in the doubles at all of them, and the singles at the 1996 and 2000 Games. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics Nestor and Sébastien Lareau won the doubles title to form part of Nestor’s Golden Slam, consisting of Olympic Gold and all four Grand Slam doubles titles. From April 1994 to April 2018 Nestor spent more than 1,100 consecutive weeks ranked in the top 100 doubles players. He retired at the end of the 2018 season with almost $13 million in prize money.
