NEW YORK (REUTERS) — The New York Knicks have acquired forward Tim Thomas and center Nazr Mohammed in a three-way trade that involves Keith van Horn leaving Madison Square Garden, the Knicks said Sunday.

Van Horn is heading to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Thomas, while Mohammed joins the Knicks from the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for New York center Michael Doleac and a 2005 conditional second-round draft pick.

“We are happy to be adding two players who address our most immediate goal of becoming more athletic,” Isiah Thomas, the Knicks’ president of basketball operations, said in a statement.

“Thomas is a young, versatile small forward who suits our style of play very well, and Mohammed is a strong front-court player who will help us with rebounding and defense.

“Although we had to part with two quality players and individuals, we felt this trade makes us better now and in the future.”

As part of the deal, which came four days before the trade deadline, the Hawks will also get Bucks center Joel Przybilla.

Isiah Thomas has transformed the Knicks’ roster and staff since taking over from Scott Layden in December last year.

He has been responsible for bringing in point guard Stephon Marbury and forward Penny Hardaway and replacing fired coach Don Chaney with Lenny Wilkens.

Since Thomas arrived, the Knicks (25-29) have played themselves into a playoff position in the Eastern Conference.

Van Horn, who joined New York last August, is averaging 16.4 points and 7.3 rebounds this season. Thomas has 14.1 points and 4.9 rebounds per game.
