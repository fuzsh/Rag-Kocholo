        "text": "“Derek can be a great coach because he’s always been a ‘glue guy,’ ”’ Reggie Miller told me the other day. “He’s had that influence in every locker room he’s ever been in. He’s seen everything there is to see in basketball and he’s been a champion. And he’s been under Phil Jackson’s tutelage.”\n\nIt is immediately unclear whether the fifth year is guaranteed or includes a team option. Fisher’s deal matches the five-year, $25 million agreement Kerr reached with Golden State, but is less of a commitment than what New York initially offered Kerr to become its coach."
