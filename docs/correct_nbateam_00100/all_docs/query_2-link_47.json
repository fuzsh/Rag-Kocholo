        "text": "Tom Thibodeau returning to the NBA is my “nature is healing” moment.\n\nThibs being the head coach of the Knicks? Even better.\n\nWill Thibs, the former New York assistant coach, lead the Knicks back into a spot among the elite NBA teams? Probably not. Will he get them back to the postseason? I think so, yeah, if he gets three or four years.\n\nThere has been a lot written about Thibs and I think this Jon Krawczynski piece summed him up well from his time in Minnesota.\n\nI covered Thibs as a columnist for five years at ESPN Chicago. That was a long time ago, but our memories of him remain vivid. His legend has only grown in Chicago, thanks to the mishaps and foibles here since he was fired in 2015.\n\nThe last time I spoke to Thibs, one on one, was after Jimmy Butler received the most improved player award during that 2015 postseason. By that point, we knew nothing short of an NBA Finals appearance, and maybe only a title, would save Thibs’ job in Chicago.\n\nBut Thibs sat next to Gar Forman that day and I mused that Butler represented everything that was good about the Bulls’ marriage with the feisty coach. The front office scouted and drafted Butler in 2011 with the last pick in the first round after their most successful season since Michael Jordan’s “last dance,” and Thibs developed Butler into a star on the rise.\n\nThat’s how it should work in the NBA, but in reality, egos get in the way. Still, when the Bulls fired Thibodeau, I could see the reasoning. He had a finite shelf life with a team, that was clear. A team has a window, and the Bulls’ was closing. That the Bulls canned him in such a graceless manner is something that bothered me then and now, but I’ve written about that enough. It’s not really that important how it ended.\n\nThe Bulls front office was always peeved that he got the lion’s share of credit for the team’s resiliency and success. They thought he hoarded it, cultivated it. Maybe he did. But not with me.\n\nI respected Thibs because I enjoy covering and talking to people who are dedicated to their craft. Thibs loved talking basketball and my biggest regret is that I didn’t try learning more from him in the early days when he was open and willing to talk on the side about minutiae like Omer Asik’s footwork. We got along well, and I appreciated his passion and his quirks. Of course, I didn’t have to work with him.\n\nThe Bulls obviously were the best situation he’s inherited in his three jobs, a team that was worth the long wait to get a head coaching job. They were a young, hungry, talented team that was under-coached by Vinny Del Negro. The Bulls whiffed on getting LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and/or Chris Bosh, but the front office did a good job of adding NBA veteran role players and a legit scorer/rebounder in Carlos Boozer.\n\nThibodeau’s foundation was built that summer at the suburban Berto Center. It was 10 years ago before every player had a workout guru in Los Angeles. The Bulls, by and large, hung around Northbrook and Thibs worked the hell out of them, hammering home his philosophies. Bulls like Luol Deng and Derrick Rose would go to the Berto to get shots up and would find themselves in a lather after an “informal” two-hour workout.\n\n“The magic is in the work.” That was one of Thibs’ favorite lines in Chicago and it was authentic, not one of those bullshit lines coaches glom onto. The guy loved to coach. He loved to prepare. The results were seen on the floor, night after night. You might outcoach him one night, but you couldn’t outwork him.\n\nWhen things got bad, he never made excuses. At least not in public. “More than enough to win” wasn’t just a joke we repeated in our faux Thibs voices. In each of his first two seasons, the Bulls had the best record in the NBA. In his third and fourth seasons, the Bulls won games they had no business winning, making the playoffs each time.\n\nBut the league has changed. I don’t know if Thibs’ defensive strategies work anymore like they did a decade ago. As Krawczynski wrote, his offense was much better than his defense in his short time in Minnesota. The game has evolved more in that time than it did in decades prior. Thibs seems to have recognized that and in his years out of the league, between jobs, he would visit progressive teams to pick up their tricks.\n\nI’ve seen his tenure in Minnesota written off as a failure, and I never, ever would’ve put him in a dual role as management and coach, but Thibodeau, after acquiring Butler from the Bulls, got the Wolves back to the playoffs. It’s the organization’s sole postseason appearance since 2004. It was their first winning season since 2005. That it ended poorly is on him, but in that one season, he did his job.\n\nThe Knicks aren’t a good team and obviously are a historically dysfunctional organization. Maybe new president Leon Rose (Thibs’ old agent) is a balm to all that ails it. But nothing bodes well for Thibodeau’s long-term future in New York.\n\nStill, the one thing you won’t get from him is excuses. I respected that about him too.\n\nThere was a love-hate relationship with Bulls fans, some media (mostly the talk-show host community) and Thibs after Rose’s ACL tear in the 2012 playoffs. His undeniable skill as a coach was counterbalanced by his monomania. The minutes police were often aided by snitching from the front office. But the complaints weren’t always wrong. He is a unique, difficult guy when he’s working.\n\nThe Bulls won one playoff series in the postseasons they played without Rose and that they won one at all was a testament to how Thibodeau operated. His “more than enough to win” ethos prevailed in that series against Brooklyn, in which the Bulls finished off the Nets without Luol Deng and Kirk Hinrich. The Bulls played nine guys in Game 7 of that series. Their bench was Taj Gibson, Marquis Teague, Daequan Cook and Nazr Mohammed. Nate Robinson and Marco Belinelli were starters.\n\nEven in the bad ol’ days of Rose’s absence, there were good ol’ days. You can root for underdogs.\n\nBy the end, it was the end. Thibodeau was a gloomy figure in that first year of the Advocate Center, a dark cloud. A basketball operations staffer who got along well with Thibodeau told me that during the following summer after Thibodeau was fired, he had “PTSD,” imagining that the glowering coach was always just around the corner.\n\nA few months into Fred Hoiberg’s first season, the same staffer texted Thibs that he missed him, that the team missed him. The Bulls missed the playoffs that year, eked into them the next season with “The Three Alphas.” And then they embarked on a half-assed rebuilding plan that has completely alienated the fanbase and finally caused a front-office shakeup.\n\nIt’s amusing how the Bulls, under John Paxson and Forman, have tried to replace Thibs with his opposite in Fred Hoiberg and then his Bizarro doppelganger in Jim Boylen. Boylen has a lot of the same attributes, but it’s just everything turns out wrong. Thibs would find a way to win, Boylen has done nothing but lose. At least he’s compliant and is nice to season-ticket holders!\n\nBulls players who tired of Thibodeau now speak reverently about him. They’ve since played for coaches who don’t prepare like Thibs prepared, who don’t give of themselves as much as Thibs gave. He’s not an easy person to work for or with, but the Knicks have hired someone who is going to give them a fighting chance.\n\nOn Thursday, ESPN 1000’s David Kaplan had about three times the audience of his morning 670 The Score competitor Dan Bernstein.\n\nSomeone alert Robert Feder, right?\n\nWell, I should clarify the audience was on Twitch and by three times the audience I mean that Kaplan’s stream was attracting around 100 viewers at a time, while Bernstein was in the 30s. Yes, 3-0.\n\nIn the afternoon, Waddle & Silvy were edging closer to 200 concurrent views. ESPN 1000 somehow has 3,200 followers.\n\nBoth ESPN 1000 and The Score are pushing Twitch streams for their shows, so far to very limited success. For The Score, which has around 400 followers, this is likely an Entercom brainstorm and you can expect the other shows to join Bernstein on the app. If it’s as successful as the national Radio dotcom lineup, watch out!\n\nESPN 1000 market manager Mike Thomas said they’ve opened up partnerships with Twitch in mind. Maybe they’ll get Kaplan’s viral “ReKap” rants on the stream.\n\nIt makes sense for the sports radio stations to try and find younger viewers in mediums like Twitch, but aside from ESPN national shows on the actual TV network, has anyone ever found that sports radio fans want to actually watch hosts in the studio? And would their natural audiences translate onto this platform?\n\nAs for other Chicagoans on Twitch, former Bears lineman/gamer Kyle Long has a big audience (nearly 38,000 followers) on the site, though he hasn’t been active in months.\n\nFurloughed SB Nation sportswriter Ricky O’Donnell created a modest stir by simulating seasons with a powerhouse Western Illinois squad on College Hoops 2K8. His viewership count isn’t that high, but it’s dedicated and the chat is always robust.\n\nBarstool Sports’ Dan Katz built a behemoth Twitch account by playing NCAA Football 14 as a fictional coach. The former Chicago resident (who has more than a million followers on Twitter) was getting around 100,000 people to watch at a time, along with actual athletic departments playing along (and in the case of the University of Tennessee, licensing its marks) to ride on his digital coattails.\n\nYou knew the Cubs bullpen was in trouble when … well, when you realized the Cubs didn’t have any money to improve it from last season.\n\nBut as they finally got ready to have a season, Cubs president Theo Epstein described it as having “power arms” with “upside potential.”\n\nWhenever a team tries selling the bullpen as having hard-throwing youngsters, you can be sure that’s another way of saying, “Buckle up.”\n\nCubs manager David Ross already sounds fed up.\n\n“I’m looking for somebody to get outs, throw strikes,” the former catcher said after the team’s 12-7 loss Wednesday night. “Way too many walks from down there. Some guys have gotta step up. That’s some of the stuff we’re finding out here early on is who’s a guy we can bring in in a big situation and pitch. We can match them up as much as we want, but guys still have to come in and throw strikes.”\n\nCraig Kimbrel has been a high-priced disaster since his late arrival last season, but watching the Cubs even get to him is a minefield of its own. In the team’s first six games, the bullpen has a 9.16 ERA with 9.64 walks per nine innings, according to FanGraphs. That’s 20 walks and 21 earned runs in 18 2/3 innings.\n\nWhen you look at the names on this list, well, it kind of makes sense the Cubs bullpen isn’t very good, doesn’t it? Not exactly the Nasty Boys.\n\nI remember buying into the “young fireballer” idea before the 2007 White Sox season, as the Sox upgraded their bullpen, which still sported a very effective Bobby Jenks as closer, with young guns like Andy Sisco and Nick Masset, while adding guys like Ryan Bukvich, David Aardsma and Mike MacDougal. Matt Thornton was there too.\n\nIt didn’t go well. The Sox, who had the worst season of the Ozzie Guillen regime, had a 5.49 bullpen ERA and just poor collective numbers all around. It was a mess. Shockingly, Kenny Williams didn’t fire the pitching coach.\n\n(I actually found a blog post mentioning that group’s stumbles by White Sox vice president of communications Scott Reifert, who used to blog about the team back in the day. It was a different time, worthy of a media column itself.)\n\nThe Cubs optioned Dillon Maples to South Bend on Thursday and called up Colin Rea. Don’t expect many trades as the Cubs try to utilize the South Bend camp as a one-stop shop for relief help. In a shortened season in a country where just about everyone and everything is broken, the Cubs bullpen should be the least of our concerns, even if, on summer nights on your TV, it feels like it’s the worst thing in the world.\n\n(Photo: Dennis Wierzbicki / USA Today)"
