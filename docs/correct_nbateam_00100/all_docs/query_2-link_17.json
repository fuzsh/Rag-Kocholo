Vote below and help decide the greatest Knicks centers of all time!\n\nBirthplace : Kingston, Jamaica\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Seattle Supersonics\n\nPosition : Center\n\nNew York Knicks: 1985–2000\n\nAs the first overall pick in the 1985 NBA Draft, Patrick Ewing quickly became a dominant force on the New York Knicks and is often considered one of the best centers of all time. Known for his exceptional shot-blocking ability and offensive prowess, Ewing was a perennial All-Star who led the Knicks to numerous playoff appearances during his tenure with the team. With various accolades under his belt, including being named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1986, All-NBA First Team in 1990, and capturing two Olympic gold medals, Ewing's impact on the franchise is revered by fans and analysts alike.\n\nBirthplace : Hico, Louisiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nNew York Knicks: 1964–1974\n\nServing as a powerful example of perseverance, Willis Reed's heroic return during Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals remains one of the most iconic moments in basketball history. Drafted by the Knicks in 1964, Reed developed a well-rounded game as an adept scorer and tenacious defender, earning him the accolade of NBA MVP in 1970. A seven-time All-Star, Reed led the Knicks to two NBA championships and became the first player ever to win the Finals MVP award twice before his eventual induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nBirthplace : USA, Florida, Lake Wales\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nNew York Knicks: 2010–2015\n\nSigned as a free agent in 2010, Amar'e Stoudemire played a pivotal role in revitalizing the Knicks franchise during his time in New York. Known for his explosive athleticism and exceptional pick-and-roll skills, Stoudemire earned an All-NBA Second Team selection in 2011 and was named an All-Star three times with the Knicks. Although injuries ultimately limited his time on the court, Stoudemire's impact during his tenure remains a bright spot in the team's recent history.\n\nBirthplace : Cleveland, Ohio, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nNew York Knicks: 1988–1998\n\nAcquired in a 1988 trade, Charles Oakley quickly established himself as the enforcer and ultimate team player for the Knicks. With his relentless rebounding, tough defense, and blue-collar work ethic, Oakley became a beloved figure among New York fans. A two-time All-NBA Defensive Team selection, Oakley contributed significantly to the team's deep playoff runs in the early 1990s, creating a lasting legacy for years to come.\n\nBirthplace : Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nNew York Knicks: 1976–1979\n\nAcquired by the Knicks in a 1976 trade, Bob McAdoo brought dynamic scoring ability to the team, averaging more than 26 points per game during his three seasons in New York. A versatile big man with excellent shooting touch, McAdoo was named an All-Star twice during his tenure with the Knicks and earned two NBA scoring titles before joining the team. While he did not win any championships with New York, McAdoo's impact on the team's offensive identity is still remembered by fans and historians.\n\nBirthplace : Hartford, Connecticut\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Portland Trail Blazers\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nNew York Knicks: 1998–2002, 2012–2013\n\nJoining the Knicks in a 1998 trade, Marcus Camby quickly proved himself as an integral part of the team's playoff success. In his four seasons with the Knicks, Camby provided a formidable shot-blocking presence in the paint, earning him a reputation as one of the league's premier defensive players. Although he never won an NBA championship with the Knicks, his contributions played integral roles in the team's deep playoff runs and endeared him to loyal Knicks fans."
