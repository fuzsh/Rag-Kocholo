        "text": "Happy NBA 2K23 Release Weekend to all those who celebrate. This year’s rendition of basketball’s premiere video game features Kentucky’s own Devin Booker on the cover. He joins Anthony Davis as the only other former Kentucky player to earn this prestigious honor.\n\nBooker is an avid gamer, not to mention one of the best players in the NBA, so he’s a perfect fit to grace the cover of NBA 2K. During the pandemic when ESPN reduced itself to broadcasting players playing NBA2K against each virtually, it was Devin Booker who took down his teammate, Deandre Ayton, to win the championship.\n\nBooker, whose overall rating is 91, is Kentucky’s top-rated player in NBA 2K23 just edging out Anthony Davis (90) and Karl-Anthony Towns (89).\n\nIn total, 35 former Wildcats made the initial launch of current NBA players, including a few available in free agency. More than a handful of their ratings leaked out in the last week or so, but some of those turned out to be more scuttlebutt than scoop. Now, the official ratings are here for our critical analysis.\n\nKentucky players rated surprisingly high\n\nWhile we can squabble about a point or two here and there, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns’ ranking as the top-3 Kentucky players is no surprise. However, the next tier down features a few players worthy of a Rock-quality eyebrow raise.\n\nMost notably, Philadelphia’s favorite young talent, Tyrese Maxey (85 overall rating), took a huge jump from last season, jumping five points from where he started in 2K22. He is a star in the making.\n\nTyler Herro (84 overall) also found himself rated higher than the average onlooker may have guessed. He ranks alongside max-contract guards, De’Aaron Fox and Jamal Murray, the latter of whom is setting aim for a big comeback season this year. To compare Herro to non-Kentucky players, his 84 overall rating ranks him higher than the likes of Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, and Klay Thompson to name a few.\n\nOft-injured yet athletic role player, Jarred Vanderbilt, also landed with a higher-than-expected rating of 78. That puts him one point higher than emerging sharpshooter, Immanuel Quickley, and on par with PJ Washington. The Utah Jazz may have gotten a steal by acquiring the man they call Vando in the Rudy Gobert trade.\n\nKentucky players rated surprisingly low\n\nThe two middle-of-the-road players who strike me as rated a little too low are Julius Randle and Keldon Johnson, both of whom landed an overall rating of 82. Randle has been an automatic 20 and 10 guy since he joined the Knicks three years ago and Johnson has made incredible strides since the Spurs drafted him, turning into the team’s best player.\n\nPJ Washington’s 78 rating also feels low. He is in line for a contract extension and while he may not be worthy of a max deal, the Hornets would be crazy to risk letting him explore free agency. He has been a solid contributor to a young and exciting team.\n\nAnother former Kentucky player coming in at a 78 overall rating is John Wall. This clearly reeks of, “We have no idea how to grade this perennial All-Star who hasn’t played in a few years so let’s just throw a dart and see where it lands.” I expect Wall to have a great year with the LA Clippers and if this happens, his 2K rating should climb.\n\nSpeaking of players difficult to evaluate based on lack of playing time, Shaedon Sharpe has a rating of 72.\n\nRookies always get a lower rating than what they might deserve; it also gives them room to improve and show their worth on the court. As such, TyTy Washington’s overall 71 rating has the potential to evolve as he grows in the league.\n\nKentucky’s best 3-point shooters\n\nOf course, it’s not just overall ratings worthy of discussion. 2K breaks down a variety of skill sets into their own categories, one of which being 3-point shooting.\n\nCover boy, Devin Booker, claims the top spot of former Kentucky players from shooting behind the arc with a rating of 87, but the best shooting big man in NBA history and only center to win the 3-point contest, Karl-Anthony Towns, is right on his heels with a rating of 86.\n\nTyrese Maxey (85), Jamal Murray (84), Tyler Herro (83), Keldon Johnson (83), Malik Monk (83), and PJ Washington (80) round out the top eight.\n\nThat’s right, PJ Washington ranks higher than Immanuel Quickley and Shai Gilgous-Alexander in this category. This jumped out to me as way off initially, but Washington has a better real-life career 3-point shooting percentage than both Quickly and SGA, so it is not unfounded.\n\nKentucky’s best dunkers\n\nWhile 3-point shooting can be rated fairly objectively based on stats, dunking is a much more subjective ranking, and I’m here for it.\n\nCare to guess which former Kentucky player is rated the best dunker in NBA 2K23? If you said, “Obviously it is Hamidou Diallo and there isn’t a close second,” then you’d be right.\n\nDiallo has been under the radar when it comes to his overall performance on the court, though he has carved himself into a nice niche with the Detroit Pistons. However, let us not forget he became the second former Kentucky player to win the NBA Slam Dunk competition in 2019 (John Wall did it in 2014) when he jumped over Shaq and put his elbow through the rim.\n\nDiallo has a dunk rating of 93, good for 8th best in the entire league. He is followed by Anthony Davis at 88 and Shaedon Sharpe at 85. Someone at 2K headquarters must have been watching some high school mix tapes.\n\nNext on the list is Jamal Murray at 82. Rating Murray, fresh off a severe leg injury, as a better dunker than notably bouncy guards like De’Aaron Fox (80) and violent rim-rockers like Julius Randle (80) seems like a leap, but here’s hoping the Blue Arrow lives up to the comeback hype.\n\nKentucky classic players\n\nDevin Booker might be the highest-rated Kentucky player currently in the league, but the highest-rated former Wildcat in the game is Dan Issel, who comes in with an overall rating of 92. You can play with the Kentucky legend on the All-Time Denver Nuggets team where he played from 1976-1985.\n\nSimilarly, you can play with Kentucky legend, Cliff Hagan (91 overall), when you select the All-Time Atlanta Hawks team, though they were the St. Louis Hawks back when he was with the franchise in the late ’50s and early ’60s.\n\nOther notable Kentucky blasts from the past who made the game include Kyle Macy (72 overall rating; ’85-’86 Bulls), Kevin Grevey (73 overall rating; ’84-’85 Bucks), and my personal favorite, Jamal Mashburn (80 overall rating; ’05-’06 Heat).\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few high-profile players who did not make it into the game. Tayshaun Prince, who is the Vice President of Basketball Affairs with the Memphis Grizzlies, has not given permission for the 2K series to use his likeness, joining a few other former players now in upper management or a prominent announcing role to opt out.\n\nYou also won’t find Twitter star Rex Chapman in the game, simply because the teams he was on were not chosen as included classics. If Twitter 2K ever comes out, though, look for him to be a top-rated tweeter.\n\nCurrent Former Kentucky NBA Player Ratings"
