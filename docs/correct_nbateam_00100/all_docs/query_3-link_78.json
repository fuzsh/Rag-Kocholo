        "text": "DETROIT (NBA) - If you're seeking signs that this NBA season will be different to last, look no further than Wednesday night when the bulk of the teams got their campaigns underway.\n\nIn Auburn Hills, there was a rare home defeat for the Detroit Pistons, while the New York Knicks began to put last year behind them with a triple-overtime win over Pau Gasol-less Memphis.\n\nComing just 24 hours after Chicago embarrassed Miami on the night they collected their championship rings, it all suggests there could be a new order in the NBA this season.\n\nThe Pistons dominated the regular season last year, winning 64 games despite easing up down the stretch.\n\nNowhere were they more dominant than at the Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nBut they were upstaged in this season's opener as Michael Redd scored 37 points to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 105-97 win.\n\nRedd, who has always performed well - but lost - against the Pistons, made 14 of 22 shots as the Bucks won in Michigan for the first time since January 2003.\n\n\"When we come into The Palace, where we were something like 0-5 last year, and play like this, it is going to build a lot of confidence for a young team,\" Bucks coach Terry Stotts added.\n\nFor Detroit, it's back to the drawing board\n\n\"We've had concern, as I said the last couple of weeks of our training camp, about our sense of urgency at times,\" Detroit coach Flip Saunders said.\n\n\"You have to play with emotion and we didn't play with that. It's like we got knocked out early and we never regained. It was like we were in a scramble type situation. We tried to catch up and never could get up over the hump.\"\n\nThe Pistons felt the absence of four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace, who signed with Chicago in the off-season. They struggled to the protect the interior, giving up 70 points in the paint with 40 coming in the first half.\n\nDetroit trailed by 10 points at the start of the third quarter but cut the deficit to 59-57 before their frontcourt took a hit as temperamental Rasheed Wallace collected his second technical foul and was ejected at the 7:03 mark.\n\nAustralia international Andrew Bogut, who had been expected to miss the start of the season injured, proved his fitness with 16 points for the Bucks, a tally matched by Charlie Villanueva.\n\nFor Detroit, Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton scored 25 points apiece and Tayshaun Prince added 16 and 11 rebound.\n\nNazr Mohammed, signed to replace Wallace, had eight points and 12 rebounds before fouling out.\n\nKnicks coach Thomas back in W column\n\nIn Memphis, Isiah Thomas collected his first coaching win in three years as the Knicks beat the Grizzlies 118-117 in dramatic fashion.\n\nJamal Crawford stole the ball from Chucky Atkins with 15 seconds left in triple overtime and Quentin Richardson nailed two free throws with 11 seconds to go for New York.\n\nKnicks president Thomas, coaching his first game since he was with Indiana in 2002-03, replaced Larry Brown in the off-season.\n\n\"It's a great way to start,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"It's tough to come in somebody's building on opening night and win a basketball game, especially a triple-overtime game. Guys showed great courage and great fight.\n\n\"They hung in there and they battled and they just found a way to win the basketball game, even on a night when some of our guys didn't shoot well.\"\n\nIt looked like being a familiar story of failure when the Knicks - who won just 23 games last season - let slip a 19-point fourth quarter lead to send the game to overtime.\n\nRichardson led New York with 31 points on 10 of 13 shooting.\n\n\"The only thing I kept telling myself constantly was, 'We're going to win it,'\" Richardson said. \"Even though I was disappointed we were going to go to overtime, the main thing I kept on my mind and kept telling my teammates was that we were going to win.\"\n\nAtkins led Memphis with 25 points off the bench, while Hakim Warrick had 22 points and rookie Rudy Gay 21.\n\nThey will have to get used to playing without Gasol, who is set to miss up to three months with a broken foot sustained playing for Spain in their victorious FIBA World Championship campaign.\n\nHoward's tricks lift Magic to victory\n\nChicago failed to build on Tuesday's win in Miami as they lost 109-94 to the Orlando Magic.\n\nTeam USA forward Dwight Howard scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Magic, who started the game on a 12-3 run and never looked back.\n\nJameer Nelson added 21 points, Grant Hill 19, while Turkey's Hedo Turkoglu had 11.\n\nSerbian star Darko Milicic added seven off the bench.\n\nFor Chicago, Ben Gordon scored 24 points in vain, while Howard's Team USA team-mate Kirk Hinrich had 14.\n\nSwiss rookie Thabo Sefolosha had another encouraging night with 13 points off the bench, but Argentina's Andres Nocioni was held to just three.\n\nToronto's international revolution will need time to take effect as they lost 102-92 to the New Jersey Nets in East Rutherford.\n\nAlthough they added a wealth of European talent over the summer, it was TJ Ford who was Toronto's best player who had 19 points, seven assists and five rebounds but ultimately came up short in his personal duel with Jason Kidd.\n\nThe Nets point guard registered a triple-double with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while Vince Carter collected 25, 11, and forward Bostjan Nachbar matched that tally coming off the bench.\n\nFor Toronto, Nachbar's international team-mate Rasho Nesterovic started but had only four points and three rebounds in under 10 minutes on the court.\n\nSpaniards Jose Calderon and Jorge Garbajosa had four and two points respectively in limited minutes off the bench, while Italy center Andrea Bargnani, the number one draft pick, managed only two points in nine minutes.\n\nTeam USA forward Chris Bosh also struggled with 14 points on five of 13 shooting.\n\nMarion, Nash too much for Clippers\n\nShawn Marion and Steve Nash teamed up to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 112-104 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nMarion scored 27 points and pulled down 10 rebounds while Nash collected 20 points and 11 assists, while France's Boris Diaw added 15 and Amare Stoudemire, battling back to fitness, scored 13 of his 15 points in the first half.\n\nFor the Clippers, Elton Brand scored 28 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and Cuttino Mobley and Sam Cassell added 17 points apiece.\n\nCarlos Boozer was on song as the Utah Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 107-97 in Salt Lake City.\n\nBoozer scored 24 points and grabbed 19 rebounds - two shy of his career high - while Deron Williams added 18 and 10 assists for the Jazz. Turkey's Mehmut Okur had 17 points.\n\nFor Houston, Tracy McGrady overcame Andrei Kirilenko's defending to score 25 points while Yao Ming added 22 and nine rebounds.\n\nAnother season, same old story in Philadelphia, as Allen Iverson was the dominant force for the 76ers.\n\nThe high-scoring guard opened his 2006-07 account with 32 in an 88-75 win over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nJames runs the show for Cleveland\n\nTeam USA star LeBron James was also up to his usual standards, scoring 26 points including a dazzling go-ahead score in a 97-94 win for Cleveland over the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe Boston Celtics held an emotional tribute to Red Auerbach before tip-off, but could not follow it with a victory parade as Chris Paul and the New Orleans Hornets took over.\n\nPaul scored 20 points and handed out 10 assists in a 91-87 win.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers got 47 points from their bench in a 106-99 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. With their big men in foul trouble, the bench kept Indiana in it until Jermaine O'Neal and Al Harrington closed the deal in the fourth quarter.\n\nTroy Hudson scored eight of his 15 points in the decisive final period to lift the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 92-83 win over the Sacramento Kings, while Zach Randolph's double-double got the Portland Trail Blazers off to a winning start, 110-106 over Seattle.\n\nRonny Turiaf had a career high in points and rebounds and Lamar Odom just missed a triple-double as the Los Angeles Lakers coasted to a 110-98 victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nTuriaf scored all 23 points of his points in the second half, while Odom had 22 points, nine boards and nine assists.\n\nPA Sport"
