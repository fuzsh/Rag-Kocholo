        "text": "DAME TIME…\n\nWOW! Hope you had a chance to watch the Portland Trailblazers play the Brooklyn Nets last night in the bubble. More on that below.\n\nTODAY’S SCHEDULE:\n\nNuggets-Raptors 1:30\n\nHeat-Pacers 4:00 (ESPN)\n\nThunder-Clippers 6:30 (ESPN)\n\n76ers-Rockets 9:00 (ESPN)\n\nI hate to admit this, but I have a few friends, and I have heard others say, “I’m not watching the NBA.”\n\nSorry, their loss.\n\nI think the games in the bubble have been off the charts. I don’t care what the haters say about the TV ratings; all I know is that I watch every single game.\n\nLast night Damian Lillard put on another outstanding show. This cat is amazing. The Blazers were facing a do or die situation; lose and they were packing up and heading home. Win, and they would face the Memphis Grizzlies in the play-in game on Saturday. There was no way Lillard was going home. The Weber State alum pumped in 42 points on 13-22 shooting from the field including 8-14 from downtown and 8-9 from the free-throw line leading the Blazers to the 134-133 win.\n\nDame dished out 12 assists and committed just 1 turnover. Think about that; 1 turnover. He’s got the ball in his hands 99% of the time and the Nets are double teaming him.\n\nC.J. McCollum, Lillard’s backcourt partner scored 25 points in the game. CJ played really well to start the game and added in 7 assists.\n\nPortland will face the Grizzlies on Saturday at 2:30.\n\nSpeaking of Memphis, Jonas Valanciunas recorded his first career triple-double yesterday in their win over Milwaukee. Jonas had 26 points, 19 rebounds and 12 assists. His point guard, rookie Ja Morant also had a triple double; 12-13-10. Don’t sleep on the Grizzlies when they play the Blazers on Saturday. Wish Jaren jackson Jr. was in the lineup; he’s out with an injury.\n\nThe Suns, despite going 8-0 in the bubble were watching the game with a huge interest. If Portland lost, it would be them that would have played the Grizzlies. The future is bright for Phoenix. Should be noted the Suns lead the league in assists per game with 27.1. And they also lead the league in free-throw percentage, .839 which happens to be the highest percentage in the history of the league. It’s the little things that matter.\n\nCaris LeVert put in work last night for Brooklyn. The former Michigan Wolverine dropped 37 points in 32 minutes on 16-on 16-29 shooting and 9 assists. LeVert did anything he wanted all night. The Nets had the last shot in the closing seconds but LeVert came up short. I love his game; he gets in the lane and utilzes the “Villanova” jump-stop well.\n\nCarmelo Anthony did not shoot the ball well (4-12, 9 points) but he did rebound it. Melo needs to stay inside and score from the block and get to the line; the former Syracuse Orangeman was 0-0 from the free-throw line.\n\nKenny “The Jet” Smith, former Molloy Stanner mentioned before the game that the Blazers would win because Brooklyn would not play hard. “There’s no doubt in my mind that the Portland Trailblazers will win this game. And they will win easy. The reason Brooklyn wins is they play hard. They’re not gonna play hard tonight. That’s an awful thing to say. The Nets pride themselves on playing hard and have a lot of competitors. Jacque Vaughn’s crew went out and competed all night. Come on Kenny, step up your game.\n\nI have watched every team in the bubble multiple times, no one plays harder than the Nets.\n\nTyler Johnson of the Nets put in a strong performance; 16 points on 7-13 shooting.\n\nNets will face the Raptors in the playoffs.\n\nThe Spurs will not be in the playoffs for the first time since 1996-97. Bob Hill was in his third season at the helm and started that season, went 3-15. Pop took over and went 17-47. David Robinson was hurt, played 6 games. Dominique Wilkins was on the team. Poor season enabled them to get Tim Duncan in the draft. Love what Stan Van Gundy said about the Spurs yesterday: “If you don’t have a great attitude you’re not gonna last long in the San Antonio Spurs organization.”\n\nBoban Marjanovic pulled down a career high 20 rebounds yesterday against th Suns.\n\nWhen Jevon Carter makes an outside shot, he runs and find his man to pick up fullcourt. he doesn’t run back and point up the sky, scream, or do something foolish with his fingers.\n\nZion Williamson did not record a single steal or blocked shot in 5 games in the bubble.\n\nMavericks are in the playoffs for the first time in four years.\n\nJim Boylen was fired by the Chicago Bulls.\n\nI am sure he’s a nice guy and all but why does Kevin Harlan of TNT have to scream and shout when someone does something well on the court?\n\nHappy birthday Magic Johnson, he’s 61.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY FROM GREGG POPOVICH:\n\n“I don’t dwell on the past. What’s important is the moment. You do what you gotta do and then you move on. Looking at the past doesn’t do much good.”\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY II FROM STAN VAN GUNDY:\n\n“A lot of people look at players and think it’s about athleticism and skills. But, basketball is a game of decisions; when to pass, when to shoot, when to dribble. The best players are the guys who can make decisions.”\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nE-Mail: Hoops135@hotmail.com\n\n“The reality is we fucking suck right now. We just not that good right now. I don’t know what better way to frame it. I can try in Spanish, but I ain’t really that good at Spanish.” -Draymond Green after the Golden State Warriors lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 120-92.\n\nGolden State is 0-2. The losses have been ugly. Besides Sunday’s defeat, they lost to the Clippers 141-22. Against the Thunder on Sunday, Golden State turned the ball over six times in the first five minutes of the game. (Golden State finished with 14 for the game) At one point in the first half O.K.C. led 70-35. Jordan Poole, a rookie from the University of Michigan is shooting 2-22 in the first two games for Golden State. He’s 2-12 from distance. With hard work in the gym, he will get it going.\n\nAt one point in the third quarter the Thunder led 95-56.\n\n“Everybody loved our offense, but it wasn’t our offense that was making us great,” Green said. ”It was our defense. I’ve said that for years. Our defense right now is nonexistent. I don’t even think we know what defense is right now.”\n\nD’Angelo Russell was ejected in the third quarter for screaming at an official. Russell drove to the goal, thought he was fouled. No call. He got in the official’s face, was T’d up. Russell kept on yelling, walking with the official, in his face. Ref T’d him up again and that was all she wrote. Russell, the former Ohio State Buckeye finished with six points on 3 for 10 shooting. This kind of behavior can’t happen.\n\nWarriors visit New Orleans Monday night to take on the Pelicans who are looking for their first win. No need to panic. There’s still 80 games to play.\n\nDraymond had another interesting post-game comment: “It sucks. But I guess just about everybody except Tim Duncan has been through it. But it sucks pretty bad.”\n\nOT\n\nOn Sunday the Brooklyn Nets lost in overtime to the Memphis Grizzlies, 134-133. It’s the second time this week Brooklyn has lost in OT. With the Grizzlies trailing by two, Jae Crowder hit a 3 from the top of the key at the buzzer. Kyrie Irving finished with 37 points. 7 rebounds and 7 assists. Crowder made two just baskets in 37 minutes of run. Both were 3’s. His first make came with 1:09 left in OT. Solomon Hill was 5-5 from the field for Memphis. Rookie Ja Morant had a very good game. 30 points on 13-22 shooting, 9 assists and he was the one who pitched it to Crowder for the game winner. Ja is fearless. Grizzlies had 33 assists on the day with just 12 turnovers.\n\nROCKETS VS THUNDER\n\nMonday night marks the return of Chris Paul to Houston. Will be interesting to watch the ex-Rocket go against Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Thunder head coach Billy Donovan on facing Westbrook: ”He was always a great guy to coach. The one thing I always admired and respected – and I told him this – that I never took for granted that he came ready to play and give his all every night.”\n\nSpeaking of Russ, on this date in 2016, he put up 51 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and dished out 10 assists leading the Thunder to the 113-110 overtime win over the Suns. The former UCLA Bruin took 44 shots in the game.\n\nUNDEFEATED\n\nAfter one week of play, five teams are undefeated. Timberwolves 3-0. Nuggets, Spurs, Hawks and 76ers all 2-0. Someone will get their first loss tonight; 76ers take on Atlanta.\n\nA LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN\n\nHigh school basketball players are going to have another option. Seems like there is going to be a new league for them. David West is involved. https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-10-26/historical-basketball-league-prep-athletes-pay-salary-hbcu-college-education-ncaa\n\nTo players and their families, the opportunity to professionalize at 18; receive a scholarship to a two-year or four-year college or vocational school that sits near one of the eight HBL cities (down the Eastern seaboard, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Va., Norfolk, Va., Raleigh, N.C., Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta); keep rights to their name, image and likeness for endorsement deals; and be trained in financial literacy and other practices that will help them navigate their careers in basketball or outside of it.\n\nTeams that have made more 3’s in a game are 18-16-6.\n\nHappy birthday Lenny Wilkens and Randy Wittman.\n\nBe a great teammate…\n\nTwo very good websites/resources for the NBA: Basketball-Intelligence http://basketballintelligence.net/ and Basketball-Reference https://www.basketball-reference.com/\n\nE-Mail: Hoops135@hotmail.com"
