        "text": "ATLANTA - Nazr Mohammed scored 24 points, and Shareef Abdur-Rahim added 20 as the Atlanta Hawks routed the New York Knicks 118-89 Wednesday night.\n\nJason Terry matched his season-high with 11 assists for the Hawks, who have won six of seven at home and five of six overall.\n\nNew York, which had won three of four, dropped to 8-24 on the road. Kurt Thomas led the Knicks with 19 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nAfter Latrell Sprewell hit an 8-foot jumper to cut Atlanta&#39;s lead to 62-52 early in the third quarter, the Hawks went on a 29-10 run that ended with Mohammed&#39;s reverse lay-up. New York followed Sprewell&#39;s basket by going scoreless on its next six trips, missing five shots and committing a turnover.\n\nMohammed, who scored 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting in the third quarter, had his best offensive game since scoring a career-high 30 in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 5.\n\nTerry hit a 3-pointer over Mark Jackson with 2.6 seconds left in the second quarter to give Atlanta a 62-48 lead, its biggest of the first half.\n\nAllan Houston was just 3-for-12 from the field, finishing with 10 points, and the Knicks got a combined 2-for-12 effort from reserve center Othella Harrington and reserve guard Charlie Ward.\n\nClarence Weatherspoon pulled down a game-high 12 rebounds for the Knicks.\n\nNotes: Abdur-Rahim left Philips Arena with 6:34 left in the third quarter to fly to California to be his wife, DeeDee, for the birth of their first child. ... The Hawks, who lost the first three games of the season series, haven&#39;t been swept by the Knicks since the 1974-75 season. ... Each team entered with a 26-40 record. ... The Knicks dropped to 0-17 this season on the road when trailing after the second quarter. ... Knicks guard Howard Eisley, in the second season of a seven-year, $42-million contract did not play for the second time in three games. After going scoreless in 10 minutes of the Knicks&#39; win over Memphis on Tuesday, Eisley questioned coach Don Chaney&#39;s decision not to play him."
