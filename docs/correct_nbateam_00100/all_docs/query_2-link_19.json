        "text": "Honorable Mentions\n\nAndrea Bargnani\n\nKnicks stats (71 games): 13.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.3 assists, .447/.302/.818\n\nBargnani’s inclusion on this list is not necessarily of his own doing, but he personifies so much of what has been wrong with the Knicks. The Knicks, of course, gave up a first round pick to acquire Bargnani, deciding that he would be a good fit and take some of the scoring burden off of Carmelo Anthony. All things considered, Il Mago was the exact player that the Knicks traded for. He sucked from three, was atrocious defensively, and missed a ton of games, but shot the basketball into the round opening on the backboard. He was bad, but he was who we thought he was. At least we’ll always have this:\n\nAnd also this:\n\nMy god, those videos never get old. I implore you to not go any further in this article without watching both of those videos.\n\nHave you watched?\n\nOkay, let’s move on.\n\nBeno Udrih\n\nKnicks stats (31 games): 5.6 points, 1.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists, .425/.425/.833\n\nBeno Udrih is not a bad basketball player. But his career as a ‘Bocker was short lived, mostly because Mike Woodson hated him. Like, REALLY hated him. There was the time when Udrih believed that he had help on the back end and allowed the game winning bucket. Mikey with the good goatee didn’t like that. There was the other time when he passed the ball to J.R. Smith, who proceeded to take a J.R. Smith-esque shot that cost the Knicks the game. Mike Woodson hated that. Remember this?:\n\nOne day, I would love to feel as passionately as Mike Woodson did about Beno Udrih’s general awfulness.\n\nEddy Curry\n\nKnicks stats (222 games): 15.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, 0.5 assists, .563/1.00/.621\n\nIt’s almost incredible that Curry managed to play over 200 games as a Knick. He is perhaps the main guy that sums up the struggles of the 00’s Knicks. They gave up a bevy of draft picks to get him (the two first rounders became LaMarcus Aldridge and Joakim Noah) only to see him put on so much weight by the end of his tenure that he played just 12 games in his last two years as a Knick. This weight thing is kind of a theme amongst Knicks big men, but we’ll get to that on the actual list. When Curry did play, he put up some nice numbers, but fell short of the lofty expectations set for him coming out of high school.\n\nMy favorite Curry moment by far is this:\n\nVery mature of you, Eddy. When asked his biggest regret, Curry said he would’ve loved to get a college degree. “It would be super dope to have a college diploma,” said Curry. Dope indeed, my man.\n\nLuc Longley\n\nKnicks stats (25 games): 2.0 points, 1.6 rebounds, 0.3 assists, .333/.000/.765\n\nAt this point in his career, Longley was a shell of his former, clinically average self. A big man that won three titles with Jordan’s Bulls, he played in the league for several years as a veteran, defensive minded player. After playing an abbreviated 2000–01 season with the Knicks, he hung up his shoes and retired. He also (this is true, Google it) bought the naming rights of a brand new shrimp species and named it after his daughter for her birthday. Could you imagine a cooler birthday present? I think the answer we’re looking for is, “yes, literally anything would be cooler.” Australians are awesomely terrible. Or terribly awesome. One of the two.\n\nAnd now, *drum roll please*…the worst 10 Knicks of the century, according to yours truly.\n\n10. Malik Rose\n\nKnicks stats (230 games): 4.0 points, 3.0 rebounds, 0.8 assists, .383/.231/.775\n\nRose was a player that I remember disliking so strongly when I was younger. I was born in 1995, so those mid-2000’s Knicks teams were the first ones I really remember watching and somewhat enjoying. And Rose received a lot of my ire. I feel bad about it now, considering that Rose was a veteran in his 30’s, but you really can’t speak logic to a 10-year-old kid.\n\nRose was a great role player for the San Antonio Spurs during the beginning of their dynasty, with a reputation as a tough nosed defender and strong rebounder. The Knicks actually (brace yourselves) got a good deal in acquiring Rose, netting two first rounders from the Spurs in a trade that essentially was Rose for Nazr Mohammed. One of those first rounders turned into David Lee, while the other turned into a player further down on this list, so classic Knicks, I suppose.\n\nAnyways, Rose was a classic case of a veteran player playing for too long and seeing his skills deteriorate progressively. He was a great leader and a good veteran to have in the locker room, but on the floor, he struggled in more ways than one. After his retirement, he carved out a successful career for himself, appearing on television for the Sixers before being named the manager of basketball operations for the Atlanta Hawks, a role he still serves. Thank you, Malik Rose, for teaching me how to dislike athletes on my own team.\n\n9. Steve Francis\n\nKnicks stats (68 games): 11.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists, .420/.395/.806\n\nStevie Franchise. The Knicks gave up Trevor Ariza and Penny Hardaway to acquire Francis in 2006, hoping that him and Stephon Marbury would work out as a backcourt with name recognition. The trade put the Knicks over the $130 million mark on their books, which no team had reached at the time. (Related: The Knicks won 23 games that season. Talk about bang for your buck.) To think that this swap made sense to anyone, and that the trigger was allowed to be pulled, is hilarious. What’s ineptitude if you can’t sit back and laugh though?\n\nAfter averaging at least 16 points for the six seasons prior to 2006, Francis saw his averages drop coming to New York, and before you knew it, he was out of the league. He lasted just a season and a half before being dealt for Zach Randolph. Let’s sum up this transaction in two, simple images:\n\nWay to go, Isiah. At least there’s this!:\n\n8. Renaldo Balkman\n\nKnicks stats (150 games): 4.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, 0.6 assists, .497/.180/.510\n\nWe are really getting into it now. Balkman is a doozy. I can remember being incredibly excited for this specific pick, eagerly awaiting to see what my favorite team would do as a youngster. When they took Balkman, nearly every pundit said it was an awful pick. The scene after the pick is infamous. He was regarded as a clear second round pick, and the Knicks had reached for him. Isiah Thomas compared him to Dennis Rodman and Ron Artest. Don’t worry though, Thomas and company had their reasons. There is a theory out there that the Knicks took him because he had the same agent as LeBron James. That worked out real nicely, guys.\n\nIf there’s one redeeming quality about Balkman, despite all of his basketball shortcomings, it’s his endearing qualities as a teammate:\n\nHe DID win the Baloncesto Superior Nacional last year while winning MVP of the finals, so there’s that.\n\n7. Michael Sweetney\n\nKnicks stats (119 games): 7.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, 0.5 assists, .522/.000/.744\n\nComing out of Georgetown University, Sweetney was a double-double machine, a Naismith Player of the Year Finalist, and a Wooden Award candidate. There were concerns about his weight, but as only the Knicks could do, they ignored the warning signs and took him anyways. There were no true standouts following Sweetney in his draft class, save for the likes of David West and Josh Howard, but looking at the top of the 2003 draft and then seeing the name “Michael Sweetney” is hilarious. Also, Sweetney looks like this now.\n\nYou hate to see guys that struggle with weight flame out, especially ones with a great skill set. Either way, Sweetney was one of the worst picks that the Knicks have made, and a huge disappointment. He lasted just two years in New York before being traded for Eddy Curry. The irony is thick with this one.\n\n6. Andy Rautins\n\nKnicks stats (5 games): 1.6 points, 0.2 rebounds, 0.6 assists, .429/.250/.500\n\nRautins played a total of 24 minutes as a Knick, recorded a negative PER, probably never should have been drafted in the first place, and was selected a pick ahead of this Knicks legend. In the first game of his career, on November 9, 2010, against the Milwaukee Bucks, he had three turnovers in eight minutes. He threw one of the worst passes I’ve ever seen in this game, too. I knew at the moment he entered the court that his career was over. Rautins may have been a New York legend due to his success at Syracuse University, but as a Knick, he was much like those that believed Cuse deserved a spot in this year’s tournament: a joke.\n\n5. Mardy Collins\n\nKnicks stats (107 games): 3.7 points, 1.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, .357/.256/.581\n\nCollins came to New York from Temple University as a heralded defender who could also lead an offense and facilitate. There is a certain level of hilarity in the fact that many of the draft picks from the Thomas era came in as defenders, but I digress. The 29th selection in the 2006 NBA Draft, Collins was one of those guys that my uncles would complain about every time we watched a game together. He struggled mightily from the floor as a Knick, and is remembered for one and one thing only: getting punched by Carmelo Anthony in the brawl at MSG:\n\n4. Cezary Trybanski\n\nKnicks stats (3 games): 0.3 points, 0.0 rebounds, 0.0 assists, .000/.000/.500\n\nWow, I feel genuinely awful about this one. But this is just too funny.\n\nTrybanski was the first Polish-born player to ever play in the NBA, a trail blazer for the international player field and role model for the likes of Marcin Gortat and Maciej Lampe (Editor’s note: LIGHT THE LAMPE). Trybanski played a total of five minutes as a Knick, missed both of his shots, and hit one of his two free-throw attempts. Cezary, you look so happy in that above photo, but you were not a good Knick. He does have a video on YouTube that has the word “megablok” in it though, so methinks he’ll be okay:\n\nMEGABLOK!!!!\n\n3. Jerome James\n\nKnicks’ stats (90 games): 2.5 points, 1.8 rebounds, 0.2 assists, .445/.000/.617\n\nAh yes, the crown jewel of the Isiah Thomas era. I like to think that the above picture was a snapshot of him at practice where Larry Brown said, “touch the baseline, we’re running suicides.”\n\nLet’s just say Jerome James was not about the “effort” life. James parlayed an 11-game stretch in the 2004–05 playoffs into a five year, $30 million pact with the Knicks. It, uh, didn’t work out, in case his spot on this list doesn’t make that abundantly clear. The last two seasons in New York, he played a total of four games while being paid nearly $6 million annually. FOUR. James, much like his predecessors Mr. Curry and Mr. Sweetney, struggled with weight issues and couldn’t ever seem to get himself into shape. Jerome kept getting them checks, and rode off into the sunset as the proud owner of one of the worst contracts given out in NBA history.\n\n2. Mike Bibby\n\nKnicks stats (39 games): 2.6 points, 2.1 assists, 1.5 rebounds, .282/.318/.750\n\nChris Webber. Peja Stojakovic. Vlade Divac. Doug Christie. And Mike Bibby. The Sacramento Kings had some awesome teams early in the 2000’s, and each of the above players had a decent amount of success in their respective careers. When the Knicks signed Mike Bibby, there were those out there that thought he could provide something to the team. He was coming off of a minor stint with LeBron’s first iteration of the Miami Heat, and he showed very small flashes of his younger self. These moments weren’t consistent, but it looked like he could still ball.\n\nHe had no such moments as a Knick. Unless you count this:\n\nI have tried like hell to find a quote, but I can’t seem to unearth it. I specifically remember Bibby saying something along the lines of “I may not be the same player I once was, but I’ll be able to shoot the basketball until I die.” He shot 28 percent during his lone season in New York. Some referred to him at the corpse of Mike Bibby during his Knicks’ tenure. Maybe he did die and played on the Knicks as a zombie, then? That’s the only thing that makes his quote ring true.\n\n1. Travis Knight\n\nKnicks stats (126 games): 1.5 points, 1.7 rebounds, 0.2 assists, .329/.000/.673\n\nHere he is, ladies and gents. The worst of the worst. Sure, the Knicks didn’t give him a bloated contract, he didn’t burn out due to weight issues, and he didn’t get punched in the face by Carmelo Anthony. There were players that did significantly more damage to the franchise overall. But by god, if he wasn’t awful. He started his career by being drafted in the first round by the Chicago Bulls, only to have his rights renounced. As a first round pick.\n\nHis 2000–01 season with the Knicks was the single worst season I found while I was scrounging around in the dirt. He played 256 minutes, attempting 53 shots. Only 10 of those shots found twine. His PER was 0.9, and his offensive rating was a 63. The worst offensive rating a team has ever had was an 89. Not only is he the worst Knick of the 21st century, he also arrived on the team as a part of the saddest exodus in Knicks history: Patrick Ewing’s departure. Nothing about Knight’s tenure as a Knick was positive.\n\nAt least he holds one record. He once fouled out in six (6!) minutes in a playoff game in 1999, the fastest a player has ever fouled out in an NBA playoff game. Hats off to you, Travis. You win."
