And I said, ‘Well, the only way you’re going to get that is, you prepare to lock us out for a year or two.’ And he’s indicated to me that they’re willing to do it.” —Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball Player’s Association\n\n“The players are negotiating to take less money & let’s be clear that’s not going to lower ticket prices, it just lines the owners pockets.” —Steve Nash, a point guard for the Phoenix Suns, on Twitter\n\n“Our view is that the current system is broken in that thirty teams are not in a position to compete for championships.” —Adam Silver, deputy commissioner of the N.B.A.\n\n“They say the system doesn’t allow every team to compete, and that’s just not true.” &#8212Mark Bartelstein, an agent for the N.B.A. and the N.F.L.\n\n“How many people would be perfectly fine with their boss saying they want them to take a 40% paycut cuz they want guaranteed profit yearly.” —Josh Childress, a shooting guard for the Phoenix Suns, on Twitter\n\n“It’s stressful. If it’s a dollar, if it’s ten dollars, losing money is losing money, regardless of how much you have.” —Carmelo Anthony, a small forward for the New York Knicks\n\n“If we don’t go to Europe, we’re going to start our own league.” —Amar&#8217e Stoudemire, a power forward for the New York Knicks\n\n“Dear NBA, You’re not just locking the players out. You’re locking out your fans, venders, arena workers, and more. #StandUnited #LetUsPlay” —Nazr Mohammed, a center for the Oklahoma City Thunder, on Twitter"
