        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Isiah Thomas made yet another move yesterday in his transformation of the New York Knicks, trading Keith Van Horn to the Milwaukee Bucks and acquiring Tim Thomas in a three-way deal that also involved the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nNew York also received center Nazr Mohammed from Atlanta, while the Hawks acquired Michael Doleac from the Knicks and Joel Przybilla from Milwaukee. New York also sent a 2005 second-round draft pick to Atlanta.\n\nIt's the third trade made by Thomas, who has also changed coaches, since taking over as team president in late December. Only seven players who were with the Knicks then remain on their roster.\n\nThis latest deal gives New York a new starting small forward in Tim Thomas, and a new backup center in Mohammed. Both could be in uniform tomorrow night when the Knicks play Detroit.\n\nVan Horn was averaging 16.4 points for New York, third on the team behind Stephon Marbur Allan Houston. He was acquired last summer in a multi-team deal that sent Latrell Sprewell to Minnesota.\n\nTim Thomas was averaging 14.1 points and 4.9 rebounds for Milwaukee, where the seventh-year forward had spent the past 41/2 seasons. Doleac was averaging 5.0 points and 4.1 points as the backup to Dikembe Mutombo, his role increasing after Lenny Wilkens replaced Don Chaney as coach.\n\nMohammed was averaging 6.5 points and 5.0 rebounds as the backup in Atlanta, which has undergone its own roster overhaul in the past week. The Hawks dealt Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau to Portland for Rasheed Wallace and Wesley Person.\n\nHO-HUM: LeBron James pulled off the best move of All-Star Saturday - leaving early.\n\nAfter seeing missed dunk after missed dunk and some highly questionable rulings in the final round, the 19-year-old rookie phenom uttered a dismissive \"no contest\" as he walked out of the arena before the night's final dunk - or dunk attempt, in this case.\n\nA missed dunk by two-time defending champion Jason Richardson on the final attempt of the night gave the title to Fred Jones of the Indiana Pacers, providing a disappointing finish to All-Star Saturday night.\n\nPeja Stojakovic of the Sacramento Kings also failed to become a third-time winner, missing his final attempt of the 3-point shooting contest - a shot that would have forced an extra round.\n\nThe miss made a winner of Voshon Lenard of the Denver Nuggets, who hit all five of his 2-point money shots using the red, white and blue ball that's shot last from each of the five designated perimeter spots.\n\nIn early events, Baron Davis of the New Orleans Hornets won the skills challenge, and Derek Fisher, Lisa Leslie and Magic Johnson - representing the hometown Los Angeles Lakers - won the inaugural skills challenge.\n\nREVENGE OF THE NERDS: The New Jersey Nets' Lawrence Frank, now 9-0, not only is the only NBA coach who didn't play college ball, he didn't make the Teaneck, N.J., High team, either. Actually, at 5 feet 8, 142 pounds, it's remarkable he went out in the first place.\n\nFrank, asked how he stays in shape: \"Stay awake long hours, drink coffee after midnight and just hope you have a quick metabolism.\""
