        "text": "After all of the moves the Nets have made since free agency began July 1, they have two roster spots left open.\n\nThey expect to fill one with veteran big man Nazr Mohammed, who is here visiting the team this weekend. The other? Well, Nets general manager Billy King would like to acquire Andrei Kirilenko.\n\nIn an interview on Fox Sports Radio Saturday, King said that the Nets have been talking with Kirilenko, who is preparing to play with the Russian National Team in the Olympics are starring last season for Russia’s top club team, CSKA Moscow.\n\n“He still can play,” King said of Kirilenko during the radio interview. “He would be a great piece to add to us, and give us more depth at the forward spot.”\n\nBut a source downplayed the Nets’ chances of signing the versatile forward, saying they would be “surprised” if Kirilenko chose to come play in Brooklyn next season.\n\nThe biggest thing working against the Nets is what they are able to pay him. Because they are now well over the salary cap and have used their “mini” mid-level exception to sign Bosnian power forward Mirza Teletovic, the Nets can only offer Kirilenko the veteran’s minimum. Kirilenko’s contract with CSKA reportedly is worth $4 million a year, with the option to leave for the NBA each summer if he chooses to do so.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Kirilenko’s name has been linked to joining the Nets in the past several months. Long considered on of the NBA’s most versatile players, the 6-foot-9 forward had a terrific season for CSKA, averaging 14.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.9 blocks in 17 games in the Euroleague.\n\nCSKA were eventually upset in the Euroleague Final in Istanbul, losing to Greek power Panathinaikos with King, Deron Williams and Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov all watching the game in person.\n\nKirilenko has extensive history with both Williams and Prokhorov. Kirilenko and Williams played together Utah from 2005 — when the Jazz drafted Williams — until the star point guard was traded to the Nets. Kirilenko also has a friendly relationship with Prokhorov, and endorsed the Russian billionaire’s failed presidential bid earlier this year.\n\nMohammed, who will turn 35 in September, has been expected to sign for some time. Assuming he does, he’ll become the primary backup to Brook Lopez at center for the Nets. Mohammed played in 63 games for the Thunder last season, averaging 2.7 points and 2.7 rebounds."
