        "text": "“Basketball is still (what I love). I want to teach the game,” McCarty said by phone earlier this week. “… I’ve always done music and been a fan of music. No matter what, it will always be a part of who I am and what I do.”\n\nMcCarty said he is planning to release a double-CD in October with new music that he has created during his time off from basketball packaged with “Emotionally,” the last album he dropped in 2011. McCarty’s first album, “Moment for Love,” came out during his time with the Celtics.\n\nFormer NBA player Walter McCarty doesn’t want to be known as a person to profit off his celebrity. So, with the launch of his second CD “Emotionally” a few weeks ago, McCarty has been focusing his interviews more on his music and putting his 10 years in the NBA in the rearview mirror. “People might think this is a gimmick, but it’s not. I’m not just another athlete doing music,” said McCarty, who won a college national title with Kentucky before playing with four NBA teams, mostly with the Boston Celtics. “I was that 6-foot-10 high school kid in the school choir. I sang in church. I write songs. I play piano. I’m really into this.”\n\nOne former UK basketball star is returning to Lexington, but he’s leaving his athletic skill at home. Walter McCarty, a power forward for the UK basketball team from 1992-96, will showcase his singing skills Friday evening at the Lexington Opera House. McCarty, who played in 103 games for UK and had a field goal percentage of 51.5 percent, was selected 19th overall in the 1996 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks. He played in the NBA for 10 years, for four different teams. Now at 37, McCarty is on his second album, titled “Emotionally,” and focusing on his career as an artist. Singing “has always been a passion of mine,” McCarty said. “I started singing when I was maybe 4 or 5 years old. I’ve sang growing up; it’s always been a part of my life.”"
