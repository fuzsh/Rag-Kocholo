While the Blazers didn't capitalize on acquiring Wallace, the Bobcats still couldn't obtain a lottery pick or some kind of decent prospect for Crash. Here's two fun facts: The 'Cats have gone 29-116 since trading Wallace, winning just 20 percent of their games. And none of the players acquired in the trade are on the Bobcats anymore.\n\nTrade: Boston Celtics get Jeff Green, Nenad Krstic, cash, and a 2012 1st Round Draft pick (Fab Melo); Oklahoma City Thunder get Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson.\n\nDate: 2/24/2011\n\nTrades where everyone loses are always sad, but this one takes the cake. Perkins and Jeff Green have both gotten individually worse since the trade, while their teams have generally played well, masking how bad this trade was. OKC traded Green along with a draft pick and cash for Perkins and overpaid Perkins in a four-year, $22 million extension. While Green had to get heart surgery causing him to miss the 2012 season. But Boston believes in him and gave him a four-years, $36 million. Pressure busts pipes, but also makes teams re-sign players at ludicrous prices.\n\nTrade: Milwaukee Bucks get Desmond Mason and Gary Payton; Seattle Supersonics get Ray Allen, Ronald Murray, Kevin Ollie and a 2003 1st Round Draft pick (Luke Ridnour).\n\nDate: 2/20/2003\n\nThis is a story of how trading two stars for each other doesn't always work out. Gary Payton was in the last year of his contract (and in the twilight of his career) when he was traded to Milwaukee. In free agency, he decided to join Karl Malone to form the \"Super\" Lakers. Since this trade, Milwaukee has never moved past the first round of the playoffs. Seattle didn't fare much better either, and they had Ray Allen for over four years. Outside of one random great season in 2005, Seattle never made the playoffs, eventually trading Allen to Boston in 2007. And GP had to follow the ring to Miami.\n\nTrade: Philadelphia 76ers get Jeff Malone and a 1994 1st Round Draft pick (B.J. Tyler); Utah Jazz get Jeff Hornacek, Sean Green, and a 1995 2nd Round Draft pick (Junior Burrough).\n\nDate: 2/24/1994\n\nBefore Jeff Hornacek came to Utah, they were already a good team. Karl Malone and John Stockton were the ultimate tandem, but the Jazz seemed to struggle in the playoffs only making it out of the first round five times in ten seasons. After acquiring Hornacek, they made it out of the first round six out of the seven seasons he was there, including two NBA Finals appearances against the Chicago Bulls. Jeff Malone on the other hand was on his way out of the league dealing with injuries and old age, and Philadelphia wouldn't make the playoffs again until 1999. Guess that face rub Hornacek did during free throws worked.\n\nTrade: Atlanta Hawks get Toni Kukoc, Nazr Mohammed, Theo Ratliff, and Pepe Sanchez; Philadelphia 76ers get Dikembe Mutombo and Roshown McLeod.\n\nDate: 2/22/2001\n\nWhen the 76ers acquired All-Star center Dikembe Mutombo, you would've thought they had to give up a lot to acquire the veteran. But they gave up perennially injured Theo Ratliff, the past-his-prime Kukoc, and a young Nazr Mohammed. With the acquisition of Mutombo the Sixers found themselves with the best record in the Eastern Conference and in the 2001 NBA Finals, while Atlanta didn't make the playoffs again until 2008.\n\nTrade: Dallas Mavericks get Nick Van Exel, Avery Johnson, Raef LaFrentz, and Tariq Abdul-Wahad; Denver Nuggets get Juwan Howard, Donnell Harvey, cash, and a 2002 1st Round Draft pick (Frank Williams).\n\nDate: 2/21/2002\n\nWhen Dallas acquired Nick The Quick, no one could've imagined Van Exel becoming the dominant sixth man that he became. In the 2003 playoffs, Van Exel torched Sacramento in a seven-game playoff series averaging 25.3 PPG—OFF THE BENCH. Denver could've gotten a young player or a draft pick in return, but they decided to go cheap which is disappointing,\n\nTrade: Miami Heat get Marcus Banks and Shawn Marion; Phoenix Suns get Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nDate: 2/6/2008\n\nShaq was already way over the hill by the time Phoenix acquired him for All-Star Shawn Marion and salary cap fill-in Marcus Banks. Acquiring Shaq was essentially the death knell of the Mike D'Antoni \"seven seconds or less\" era Phoenix Suns. Shaq's style of play conflicted with the rest of the Phoenix roster and their record suffered. The only full season Shaq was with Phoenix they missed the playoffs (with 46 wins in a loaded conference), and as soon as they traded the Diesel, they made it to the Western Conference Finals the next year. That's what we call an \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" trade.\n\nTrade: Philadelphia 76ers get Chris Webber, Matt Barnes, and Michael Bradley; Sacramento Kings get Brian Skinner, Kenny Thomas, and Corliss Williamson.\n\nDate: 2/23/2005\n\nC-Webb was a dynamic force in the NBA helping lead the Sacramento Kings to many successful seasons. However, after microfracture surgery, Webber lost a considerable amount of his athletic abilities and the Kings dealt him to Philadelphia in a six-player deal. Many people thought that pairing Webber and Allen Iverson together would put Philadelphia at least in the playoff conversation. After a first round loss to Detroit in 2005, the Sixers couldn't make the playoffs in 2006. They bought out Webber in 2007. Sacramento didn't fare much better either, with no playoff appearances since 2006.\n\nTrade: Chicago Bulls get Travis Best, Norm Richardson, Jalen Rose, and a 2002 2nd Round Draft pick (Lonny Baxter); Indiana Pacers get Ron Artest, Brad Miller, Ron Mercer, and Kevin Ollie.\n\nDate: 2/19/2002\n\nDivision trades are always interesting because rivalries are involved. When the Bulls traded Ron Ron, could they ever have imagined him turning into the Defensive Player of the Year and an All-Star? The Bulls traded two players who would make All-Star teams with the Pacers, and got a good player in Rose, but nothing else of real value. This trade played a significant role in helping the Pacers have the best record in the NBA and make the Eastern Conference Finals, but took a turn for the worst when Artest and Malice in the Palace became a thing.\n\nTrade: Denver Nuggets get Vincent Askew, Eddie Johnson, a 1997 2nd Round Draft pick (Jason Lawson), and a 1998 2nd Round Draft pick (Tremaine Fowlkes); Indiana Pacers get Mark Jackson and LaSalle Thompson.\n\nDate: 2/20/1997\n\nWhile Reggie Miller stole the headlines for upsetting the Knicks in that infamous 1995 playoff series between Indiana and New York, it was the steady play of former Knicks guard Jackson that helped key the Pacers to a series victory. After a few good years with Indiana, Jackson was traded to the Nuggets during the '96 offseason for reasons we'll never understand. After a lackluster 25-27 start the Pacers decided to re-acquire Jackson and barely gave anything up to get him. Denver could've at least asked for a first rounder or a young player. After Jackson came back, the Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals twice, finally reaching the Finals in 2000. Mama there goes that man!\n\nTrade: Golden State Warriors get Baron Davis; New Orleans Hornets get Dale Davis and Speedy Claxton.\n\nDate: 2/24/2005\n\nBaron Davis has been injured for what seems like virtually his whole career, so it was no surprise that New Orleans traded their all-star point guard. The problem is they got a backup guard in Claxton and an over the hill big man in Dale Davis. They couldn't even get a draft pick for Baron? After B-Diddy was sent to Golden State, he spearheaded an uptempo offensive attack and surprised everyone when they knocked off the first-seeded Mavericks in the first round. While the trade, wasn't championship altering, this dunk instantly puts this trade on the list.\n\nTrade: Golden State Warriors get Bimbo Coles and Kevin Willis; Miami Heat get Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling.\n\nDate: 2/22/1996\n\nIt's safe to say that anytime you trade for someone named Bimbo, it's probably going to be a lopsided deal. Tim Hardaway came to Miami after a few down years in Golden State and made Miami an Eastern Conference powerhouse while helping ignite a rivalry with the New York Knicks. Golden State though? The Warriors continued a stretch of not making the playoffs until 2007. That's just harsh.\n\nTrade: Boston Celtics get Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk; Phoenix Suns get Joe Johnson.\n\nDate: 2/20/2002\n\nMortgaging your future is cool and all, but is it really worth it? Back at the '02 deadline, Boston was a fringe contender and saw a chance to make it to the NBA Finals in a very weak Eastern Conference. They traded then-rookie Joe Johnson to Phoenix for Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk at the deadline. Boston went to the Eastern Conference Finals, but blew a 2-1 lead to the New Jersey Nets. Rogers left in free agency and Delk left a year after, while Johnson blossomed into a 6x All-Star. We think the Celtics would've been a little better pairing Paul Pierce with Johnson rather than Ricky Davis or Wally Szczerbiak.\n\nTrade: New York Knicks get Maurice Cheeks; San Antonio Spurs get Rod Strickland.\n\nDate: 2/21/1990\n\nRod Strickland and the New York Knicks seemed like the perfect marriage. The Bronx native was playing for his hometown team, but he wanted to start, and that position was locked up by fellow city native Mark Jackson. Strickland demanded a trade and the Knicks oblige, shipping the 23-year-old to San Antonio for an old Maurice Cheeks. To top it off, former Knicks coach Stu Jackson (and current guy that hands out suspensions for the league) made the decision to start Cheeks over Jackson. No wonder Stu isn't coaching anymore.\n\nTrade: Cleveland Cavaliers get Baron Davis and a 2011 1st Round Draft pick (Kyrie Irving); Los Angeles Clippers get Jamario Moon and Mo Williams.\n\nDate: 2/24/2011\n\nWe understand that trading Baron Davis cleared cap room, but wow. The draft pick the Clippers sent to Cleveland in this deal became the first pick in the 2011 NBA Draft aka Kyrie Irving. Irving is balling, and if the Clippers would've drafted Kyrie, then Chris Paul probably wouldn't be wearing the red and blue in Staples. We guess the easy question is, who would you take? Kyrie or CP3?\n\nTrade: Cleveland Cavaliers get Larry Nance, Mike Sanders, and a 1988 1st Round Draft pick (Randolph Keys); Phoenix Suns get Kevin Johnson, Tyrone Corbin, Mark West, a 1988 1st Round Draft pick (Dan Majerle), a 1988 2nd Round Draft pick (Dean Garrett), and a 1989 2nd Round Draft pick (Greg Grant).\n\nDate: 2/25/1988\n\nTrading young for old is always cool. Your team is younger, faster, and more hip. That's what happened to the Phoenix Suns when they acquired Kevin Johnson by trading veteran Larry Nance in a multi-player deal. Phoenix also acquired a draft pick that turned into \"Thunder Dan\" Majerle. Put those pieces together with Charles Barkley years later and that's how you build a contender. What were you thinking, Cleveland? Maybe a different trade would've helped them beat Michael Jordan.\n\nTrade: New York Knicks get Steve Francis; Orlando Magic get Anfernee Hardaway and Trevor Ariza.\n\nDate: 2/22/2006\n\nThe Isiah Thomas era in New York is pretty awful, but the Steve Francis trade has to be one his more bizarre deals. Francis was owed $49 million over three seasons, adding to the Knicks payroll which reached upwards of $130 million. The bottom line is that the Knicks were even worse with Francis while the Magic were able to free up some money to sign Rashard Lewis and build the foundation to their 2009 Finals appearance. We think Stevie Franchise might've gotten his nickname for killing NBA franchises. Burn!\n\nTrade: Atlanta Hawks get Chris Mills, Zeljko Rebraca, Bob Sura and a 2004 1st Round Draft pick (Josh Smith); the Boston Celtics get Chucky Atkins, Lindsey Hunter, and a 2004 1st Round Draft pick (Tony Allen); Detroit Pistons get Rasheed Wallace and Mike James.\n\nDate: 2/19/2004\n\nWhen contenders make deadline deals, it usually doesn't work out, but in one of the more unique situations, Sheed was the perfect fit for Detroit. He added to the Pistons already staunch defense, while giving them an offensive post presence that the team had been lacking. A 2004 NBA championship, as well as five Eastern Conference Finals appearances in a row doesn't sound that bad.\n\nTrade: Houston Rockets gets Clyde Drexler and Tracy Murray; Portland Trail Blazers get Otis Thorpe, Marcelo Nicola, and a 1995 1st Round Draft pick (Randolph Childress).\n\nDate: 2/14/1995\n\nWhen you look at today's stars getting traded, the team trading the star has gotten a serious haul. The Knicks traded for Melo and threw the entire kitchen sink at Denver to get him, and when the Nets acquired Deron Williams, it was exactly the same situation. After winning a championship in '94, you would think Houston would have to give up a lot to get Clyde Drexler, but truly they gave up an aging expiring contract in Otis Thorpe along with a late first rounder. Cap space is great and all, but you couldn't get a better player for Clyde? At least Portland gave him that championship he was waiting for.\n\nTrade: Los Angeles Lakers get Pau Gasol and a a 2010 2nd Round Draft pick (Devin Ebanks); Memphis Grizzlies get Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Marc Gasol, a 2008 1st Round Draft pick (Donte Greene), and a 2010 1st Round Draft pick (Greivis Vasquez).\n\nDate: 2/1/2008\n\nThis trade is easily the steal of the century. We may never see a trade like this ever again. The Lakers gave up two low draft picks, a young Marc Gasol, and only had to give up Kwame Brown?!?!?! The Grizzlies couldn't take Andrew Bynum or Lamar Odom off of LA's hands? This trade has become less historically awful due to the rise of Marc Gasol, but it's still cringe-worthy if you're a Grizzlies fan. The Lakers have two championships to show for it, and Memphis once had to give Kwame money to play basketball. Were they paying attention?"
