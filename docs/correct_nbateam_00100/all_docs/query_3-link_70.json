        "text": "The Washington Wizards aren't the only surprise team in the NBA. The Chicago Bulls, who last competed in a postseason game when Michael Jordan led them to victory in the 1998 NBA Finals, are giving Chicago fans something to get excited about once again -- and the rest of the league is starting to notice.\n\nThe worst team in the NBA over the past five seasons, the Bulls (17-19) shook off an 0-9 start and are creeping toward the .500 mark following a seven-game winning streak.\n\nIt might be a bit premature to get worked up over a club that wins half of its games, but this team has given Chicago what it has lacked since Jordan stole the ball from Utah's Karl Malone in the 1998 Finals and scored the championship-winning basket: hope.\n\n\"It doesn't even feel like the same organization,\" said forward Tyson Chandler, who sealed a Bulls victory last Saturday by blockinga shot by New York Knicks center Nazr Mohammed in the closing seconds. \"Winning does wonders for the players, and even for the city. It's like a whole different aura.\"\n\nThe franchise is led by a bunch of rookies and virtual unknowns who are nothing like the crew that won six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998, featuring Zen master/coach Phil Jackson, the outrageous and tenacious Dennis Rodman and perhaps the best pairing of NBA athletes ever -- Jordan and Scottie Pippen.\n\nThe new Bulls are polite, shy away from the spotlight and are much younger than the experienced players of the Jordan era.\n\n\"We look like a college team out there,\" joked rookie swingman Luol Deng.\n\nThe 2004-05 Bulls, dubbed the \"Baby Bulls\" by the Chicago media, grind out victories by defending the basket and sharing the ball on offense.\n\n\"We don't really have anybody that scores 30 or 40 points a game,\" said Deng, the seventh overall pick in last June's NBA draft. \"But we're playing together. We share the ball like a college team.\"\n\n\"We went from virtually last in the league to first in one major defensive statistic,\" said Coach Scott Skiles. The Bulls have held opponents to a 41.2 field goal percentage. They have also held their opponents below 100 points for the past 23 consecutive games.\n\n\"We'd have to be nuts not to think that's not a major reason why we've won games.\"\n\nAnother reason is the unexpected development of 6-3 rookie Ben Gordon, the third overall pick in last year's draft.\n\nAfter a rocky start, in which he shot 34.4 percent and averaged 10 points during the club's nine-game losing streak, Gordon has raised his numbers to 43.9 percent and 13.4 points respectively.\n\nDuring his ups and downs, Gordon has been noted for keeping his head in pressure situations. The latest example came on Monday, when he tossed in a running floater with one second left to give the Bulls a 88-86 victory over the Knicks. (Their seven-game win streak ended two days later in Boston.)\n\nDoes Gordon or his teammates feel any pressure to match the accomplishments of Jordan's Bulls?\n\n\"I don't think people are comparing this team to one of the dynasty teams,\" said Gordon, who helped lead Connecticut to the NCAA championship last year. \"I don't really feel any pressure as far as playing for the franchise where the greatest player played.\"\n\nThe cornerstones of the Bulls are 7-1 Chandler and 6-11 Eddy Curry, who jumped straight to the Bulls from high school in 2001.\n\nChandler, who is averaging 9.4 rebounds and 1.78 blocks, anchors the team's defense, while Curry has emerged as the Bulls' strongest inside scorer with 15.7 points per game.\n\nThey were supposedly the prizes of the 2001 draft, handpicked by the Bulls' former general manager, Jerry Krause. He talked up the pair, and the franchise was supposed to be headed back to the NBA Finals.\n\nBut when the teenagers struggled their first three seasons, the long period of rebuilding continued. Fans grew restless and took it out on Curry and Chandler.\n\n\"Those were hard times,\" Chandler recalls.\n\nWhile he takes some of the blame, Chandler said the Bulls were already in disarray when he and Curry arrived.\n\nHe pointed a finger at the club's underachieving roster and at Tim Floyd, the former college coach Krause hired to replace Jackson. How bad were the Bulls back then? Over the five previous seasons, the Bulls amassed a 106-304 record (.259), and Floyd compiled a record of 49-190 (.205), the NBA's worst ever.\n\n\"We haven't had a stable team since I got here,\" said Chandler, 22. \"It's a matter of settling in and having a little comfort. At least now we have a few key players who are going to stick around a few years.\""
