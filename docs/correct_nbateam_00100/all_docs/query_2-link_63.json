        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – It looks more and more like Jalen Rose will not be coming to Detroit. The lack of available playing time and money have Rose, who was waived by the New York Knicks Monday, seeking a better situation. Miami Phoenix and Los Angeles are also interested in him and can offer him more playing time. Rose, who did not contact the Pistons Wednesday afternoon, cleared waivers but did not make a final decision where to play this season.\n\nThe Heat can use him at both guard positions and at small forward, while the Suns are willing to give him a role similar to the one Tim Thomas filled last season. Phoenix forced teams to use smaller lineups to match up with Thomas, a forward adept at hitting the 3-point shot. Los Angeles has a thin bench which could use Rose’s experience and shooting ability.\n\nDetroit can only give Rose the veteran’s minimum of $1.178 million since it has already used its two free agent exceptions to sign Nazr Mohammed and Flip Murray. The Heat could give Rose more money because it didn’t use the mid-level exception this summer. However, Miami is dangerously close to the luxury tax, so any salary it offered Rose would virtually double when the tax is factored in.\n\nDelfino gets his second wind\n\nCarlos Delfino said fatigue was the reason his shot faltered in the preseason.\n\nDelfino felt worn down after playing for the Argentinian National Team this summer at the World Championships in Japan. He made just 30 percent of his field goal tries.\n\nThe past week has helped Delfino recharge his internal batteries.\n\n“After that fi rst week (of training camp), my energy level dropped,” Delfi no “Day by day, I’m slowly getting my rhythm back.”\n\nFlip: Division stacked\n\nMilwaukee was a playoff team last season but is picked to finish last in the Central Division by many prognosticators. That’s a testament to the strength of the division, rather than an indictment of the current Bucks lineup.\n\n“When you look at the division from top to bottom, it’s blood and guts,” Flip Saunders said. “A team that no one talks about is Indiana and I think they’re pretty good. Everyone talks about Cleveland and everyone else. It’s a very difficult division.”\n\nDavis explains his side to NBA\n\nDale Davis met with NBA officials earlier this week regarding his arrest in Miami this summer. The meeting was a formality, though it caused Davis to miss two days of practice. He was charged with five misdemeanors during an altercation with South Beach police and is scheduled to go on trial Tuesday.\n\nWeek off sharpens Pistons\n\nPlayers and coaches naturally get antsy in the week leading up to the regular season. The week before the Pistons’ season opener Wednesday night was enough to drive them through the walls of their practice facility.\n\nThey played three preseason games in four days, then had six days off before opening night fi nally arrived. At times, the wait seemed endless.\n\n“We’re just ready to go,” Chauncey Billups said. “We’re ready to start it up for real.”\n\nFlip Saunders didn’t seem to mind the long layoff. He kept the players’ attention with four hard practices that included a lot of scrimmaging.\n\n“The last week has been very good for us,” he said. “We’ve really become a lot sharper defensively and offensively. Our guys are playing a lot better together right now than they were a week ago. From a coaching standpoint, I have more of a comfort level today than maybe a year ago and defi – nitely more of a comfort level now than I did a week ago.”\n\nSaunders also has the advantage of working with a veteran group that has changed very little in recent years. Other than Nazr Mohammed, the starters have played together since the Pistons traded for Rasheed Wallace in February 2004.\n\n“They have a comfort level and it’s good and bad,” Saunders said. “It’s good because they’ve been there, they know they can turn it on and they can do it, and they have a tendency sometimes to wait to do it. That’s the negative part. But as players and coaches, it’s always good to have someone that you’ve been through some battles together and you know how they’re going to react in pressure-type situations.”"
