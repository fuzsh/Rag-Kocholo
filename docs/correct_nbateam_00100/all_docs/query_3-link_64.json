        "text": "A few days ago Derek Fisher was an active player. The veteran point guard, at 39 years old, was playing in the Conference Semifinals against the Spurs, but in just a few hours his course in the NBA has taken a 180-degree turn.\n\nFisher, a disciple of Phil Jackson, has agreed to take over the New York Knicks bench for the next 5 seasons at a cost of $25 million.\n\nThe player, who has hung up his boots to accept a demanding position in the Big Apple, has shown throughout his career that he has been a good teammate. Numerous former colleagues have congratulated him through social networks for his new job.\n\nKevin Durant: «Very happy for my brother @DerekFisher. I can speak for the entire State of Oklahoma when I say that you will be missed and that we love you. Good luck coach.\n\nMagic Johnson: \"New York Knicks fans around the world should be excited that Derek Fisher has been named Head Coach. The man who knows how to win!\n\nNazr Mohammed: «@DerekFisher gave me one of the most motivational speeches I have ever heard from a basketball player. A born and well-deserved leader.\n\nBrian Cardinal: «Congratulations to my friend @DerekFisher on his new position. Can. Make it happen. \"New York City.\""
