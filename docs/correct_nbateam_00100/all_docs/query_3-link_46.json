        "text": "Fan reaction on social media to the hiring of former Kentucky player Mark Pope to be the next men’s basketball coach for UK was mixed at best, but he definitely has some fellow former Wildcats in his corner.\n\nHere’s a sampling of reaction from X (formerly Twitter) after Pope’s hiring was reported Thursday night:\n\nFormer UK basketball player Rex Chapman: “If Mark Pope is hired at Kentucky I just feel compelled to say that Mark is one of the best people you could ever know. Fierce competitor. Man of character and integrity. Someone you feel comfortable sending your son to play for. A GREAT player. Better coach.”\n\nChristian Rich (@christianrich1)‘s response to Rex Chapman: “stop rex. stop. it’s the wrong hire. it just is.”\n\nAndrew “Arbitrage” Jackson (@TheGrainiac)‘s response to Rex Chapman: “All that may be true but as a fan it’s puzzling why they wouldn’t hire one of a dozen names that have accomplished more. I hope it works is all I can say.”\n\nFrank Heinrichs (@heintime65)‘s response to Rex Chapman: “I am going to support Mark like I would any other coach. I’m a 40+yr fan and I’m not going to throw any shade or disrespect with this hire. Let’s see what happens. Go Cats”\n\nRick Kennedy (@rkken2902)‘s response to Rex Chapman: “Not remotely enough coaching success on resume to show as ready for the UK job. Love him as a player, but 5-7 years away from qualifying for this job.”\n\nFormer Kentucky star Nazr Mohammed on Thursday night: “Not sure what’s going on, I’m getting excited if it’s true that Mark Pope is in consideration for @KentuckyMBB HC position. Amazing coach, great person … battled w him daily as a Freshman & he taught me the level of intensity that the game needs to be played at. #BBN #GoBigBlue”\n\nKristin York (@xKSYorkx)‘s response to Nazr Mohammed: “If Nazr is on board, I’m on board! Let’s go, Coach Pope!”\n\nNikki Price (@SuperUKfan1990)‘s response to Nazr Mohammed: “I completely agree. He gets the UK tradition. He understands because he lived it. He will work hard and give Kentucky everything he has. I like this choice.”\n\nTyler Daugherty’s response to Nazr Mohammed: “That doesn’t mean you’re ready to take over the winningest program in college basketball. It’s not his fault, he’s a good dude and a good coach, but this is the big leagues.”\n\nFormer Kentucky basketball player Cameron Mills: “Get ready to re-meet @CoachMarkPope, BBN. Rhode Scholar Candidate ... Left his last year of MD school at Columbia & decided he wanted to be a coach. Motivating, Positive, knows the game inside & out. & 96 National Champion. Changes coming. And good ones for @KentuckyMBB”\n\nFormer Kentucky baseball coach Keith Madison: “It’s amazing … people who have never even played high school basketball are disagreeing with Rex Chapman on this hire. Come on, Kentucky fans, get behind Mark Pope and support him. Be a great fan here!”\n\nFormer Kentucky basketball player Chuck Hayes: “Great hire… like the fact we kept it ‘Kentucky’ #BBN”\n\nFormer Kentucky basketball player Mark Krebs Jr.: “Former Cat. Understands and adores the program. X/Os guy. Too many are quick to judge. Thought everyone was tired of the one and done 5stars and lack of coaching/caring? Nothing but support and encouragement for a guy who could be embarking on his dream job.”\n\nFormer Kentucky basketball player Oliver Simmons: “The dude can flat out coach. High character. Runs modern offense. Has won with less talent everywhere he’s been. In it for the long run. Understands what @KentuckyMBB is all about!”\n\nFormer Kentucky basketball player Tom Heitz: “Come on #bbn? Mark Pope is part of a National Championship team here at UK and he has had success coaching. Drew and Hurley are great coaches but this was not for them.”\n\nShane Pirtle (@shanepirtle)‘s response to Tom Heitz: “You don’t run off a HOF coach for Mark Pope. Plain and simple. Glad he’s an alum be that doesn’t qualify him to take over this program. We aren’t in the OVC”\n\nKen (@kemios)‘s response to Tom Heitz: “A part of me feels bad for Mark. We all want him to succeed, just not many believe he will. Prove everyone wrong Mark.”\n\nJeff Sheppard ‘pumped up’ for the Mark Pope era to begin. ‘This is going to be awesome.’\n\nMark Pope confirmed as Kentucky’s basketball coach. ‘Hanging a banner is the expectation.’\n\nWhat to know about new Kentucky basketball coach and 1996 national champion Mark Pope\n\nMark Pope might not be the coach Kentucky fans wanted, but he might be the coach UK needs\n\nAnalysts weigh in on UK hiring Mark Pope: From ‘great move’ to fans aren’t ‘gonna go wild’"
