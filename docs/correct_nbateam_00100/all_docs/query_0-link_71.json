        "text": "The Hornets moving on from Mitch Kupchak was the worst kept secret in the NBA. So much so, discussions over who would replace Kupchak have been prevalent in league circles all season. After speaking to multiple sources around the NBA, below are the most frequent names that come up, in order of which I hear most often first.\n\n1) Jeff Peterson – Brooklyn Nets Assistant GM\n\nCurrent assistant GM with the Brooklyn Nets, Peterson was linked to the Hornets front office job in July of 2023. Peterson has emerged as “One of the most respected” young executives in the NBA due to his strong communication skills. Peterson is another candidate who came up through the Atlanta Hawks front office, acting as assistant GM between 2014-19 before moving to Brooklyn. Peterson crossed over with current lead Hornets owner Rick Schnall in Atlanta, it is thought they have kept in touch since Peterson moved to Schnall’s home city of New York. Sources inside the Hornets believe Peterson has already held explorative discussions with the Charlotte Hornets new owners.\n\n2) Elton Brand – Philadelphia 76ers GM\n\nAfter finishing his playing career in Philadelphia, Brand became a player development consultant and went onto become GM of the Sixer’s G-League team. In 2018 he was promoted to general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, but after a tumultuous two years he was demoted from lead decision making duties due to the arrival of the newly appointed President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey. Jake Fischer reported in July 2023 that Brand is expected to draw consideration from teams looking for a new front office.\n\n3) Marc Eversley – Chicago Bulls GM\n\nEversley was in the final shortlist of candidates in 2018 when Kupchak was eventually appointed. One of the more experienced candidates likely to be considered, he’s held roles as assistant GM in Toronto (2006-13), VP of Player Personnel in Washington (2013-16), VP of Player Staff with the Sixers (2016-20) and is currently the General Manager of the Chicago Bulls, working under Arturas Karnisovas. From his time working\n\n4) Trajan Langdon – New Orleans GM\n\nA former overseas player, Langdon broke into the front office side of the NBA as a domestic and international scout for the San Antonio Spurs in 2012. In 2016 he was appointed as assistant GM with the Brooklyn Nets under Sean Marks before being appointed general manager of the New Orleans Pelicans in 2019. Although Langdon is second in command to VP of basketball operations David Griffin, he is well viewed as one of the league’s next lead decision makers of an NBA franchise. Many attribute New Orleans' success in the draft to Langdon.\n\n5) Travis Schlenk – Washington Wizards VP of Player Personnel\n\nSchlenk is currently VP of player personnel with the Washington Wizards, but more importantly was the president of basketball operations with the Hawks between 2017-2022. Before Atlanta, he spent 16 years in Golden State's front office. Schlenk has experience building teams around all-star point guards with defensive question marks in Steph Curry and Trae Young, something that could prove useful in Charlotte. Schlenk has ties back to owner Rick Schnall from his time in Atlanta.\n\n6) Donnie Nelson – Former Dallas Mavericks GM\n\nLongtime Dallas Mavericks GM between 2005-2021, Nelson has been unemployed since parting ways after a fallout with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Nelson, the son of former NBA coach Don Nelson earned a reputation as a strong international scout, having drafted Nash, Nowitzki, Doncic trading for Porzingis and pushing for the drafting of Giannis Antetutkounmpo. Since leaving Dallas, Nelson has not held an official position within the NBA.\n\n7) Nazr Mohammed – Oklahoma City Thunder Director of Team Personnel\n\nOnce a former Charlotte Bobcat, Mohammed has worked for the Oklahoma City Thunder since December 2017, learning under the renowned Sam Presti. He has held roles as General Manager of the OKC Blue and most recently in summer 2023 was appointed as Director of Team Personnel.\n\n8) Mark Hughes – LA Clippers Assistant GM\n\nA former assistant coach with the Orlando Magic (2002-04) and Sacramento (2006-07), Hughes moved into the NBA front office in 2007 as a scout for the New York Knicks. He worked his way up to become Director of Player Personnel, before leaving in 2017 to become assistant GM of the LA Clippers. Hughes has worked closely with fellow candidate Trent Redden in the Clippers front office.\n\n9) Trent Redden – LA Clippers GM\n\nFollowing Michael Winger’s departure to the Wizards, Redden was appointed as General Manager of the LA Clippers in the summer of 2023. Redden is known to be an impressive strategic thinker and has so far taken the difficult decision not to extend George and Leonard with the Clippers.\n\n10) Mike Zarren - Boston Celtics VP of Basketball Operations\n\nThe Boston Celtics have long been known to be at the forefront of analytics, using a blend of data-driven insights and a holistic understanding of the game. Zarren, the Celtics’ Vice President of Basketball Operations and team counsel, has risen through the ranks due to his expertise in this area."
