        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Dikembe Mutombo was traded from the Atlanta Hawks to the Philadelphia 76ers in a six-player deal yesterday just hours before the NBA trading deadline.\n\nMutombo and Roshown McLeod go to the 76ers, who have the NBA's best record, for Theo Ratliff, Toni Kukoc, Nazr Mohammed and Pepe Sanchez.\n\nSixers coach Larry Brown said the trade was designed to help lift a team that has struggled with injuries throughout the year through the rest of the regular season and into the playoffs.\n\n\"We're trying to get out of the East, and I think it's imperative for us to win as many games as we can right now to position ourselves so we can get out of the East,\" Brown said.\n\nThe 76ers beat out several teams - including the Knicks, Mavericks, Trail Blazers and Suns - who were also in the hunt for the 7-foot-2 Mutombo, the league's leading rebounder and three-time Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nPhiladelphia ended up paying a high price - they traded away Jerry Stackhouse and Larry Hughes in recent seasons to acquire Ratliff and Kukoc - but the Sixers decided it wasn't too much for a center who they believe will enhance their chances of winning a championship.\n\nThe Sixers believe Mutombo, 34, will match up well against the Western Conference's big, elite centers - particularly Shaquille O'Neill of Los Angeles, San Antonio's David Robinson, Portland's Arvydas Sabonis and Sacramento's Vlade Divac. The Sixers had originally pegged Ratliff as a power forward, not a center.\n\n\"I'm going to Philadelphia to play with a great player, Allen Iverson, a scoring machine who plays with tremendous energy,\" he said in a statement read by Brown. \"The opportunity to win a championship is certainly there.\"\n\nKings 115, Wizards 110\n\nWASHINGTON - The Sacramento Kings didn't have Chris Webber, which was no bid deal because the Washington Wizards were without six players after one of the biggest trades in franchise history.\n\nOn a night when the game seemed secondary, Doug Christie matched his season-high with 32 points and Vlade Divac added 27 points and a season-high six blocks to lead the Kings to a 115-110 victory last night.\n\nMinutes before the game, the Wizards traded Juwan Howard, Calvin Booth and Obinna Ekezie to Dallas for Christian Laettner, Courtney Alexander, Loy Vaught, Hubert Davis, Etan Davis and $3 million.\n\nWashington also waived Felipe Lopez, Gerard King and rookie Mike Smith and activated Leron Profit, leaving the Wizards with just eight players in uniform. They also placed malcontent point guard Rod Strickland on the injured list with sore hamstrings.\n\nAll this hit at 6 p.m. - the NBA's trading deadline - when Howard was called out of the locker room by assistant general manager Rod Higgins. Howard's stunned teammates had no choice but to go ahead with the game, but it wasn't easy.\n\n\"You've still got to go out and play. We wish it was under better circumstances, but, man,\" said guard Mitch Richmond, stopping and shaking his head. \"We never thought in a million years it would be Juwan.\"\n\nHornets 93, Warriors 91\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. - David Wesley hit a 3-pointer with 17 seconds left last night to lift the Hornets to a 93-91 victory over Golden State and give Paul Silas his 100th coaching victory with Charlotte.\n\nP.J. Brown led the Hornets with 18 points. Jamal Mashburn had 16 points and 12 rebounds. Elden Campbell, Wesle Baron Davis all scored 14.\n\nPISTONS, RAPTORS DEAL: The Detroit Pistons traded Jerome Williams and Eric Montross to the Toronto Raptors for Corliss Williamson, Tyrone Corbin, Kornel David and a future first-round pick.\n\nIt was the second trade of the day for the Raptors, who also acquired point guard Chris Childs from the New York Knicks for Mark Jackson and Muggsy Bogues."
