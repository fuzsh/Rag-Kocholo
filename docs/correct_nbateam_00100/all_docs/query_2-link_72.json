        "text": "Steve Masiello, 36, is in his third season as head coach at Manhattan, where he led the Jaspers to the best turnaround in Division I in his first season, before taking the team to the MAAC Championship game last year. Just before his most talented team makes a run at its first NCAA Tournament berth since 2004, Masiello allowed The Post an inside look at what game day looks like for one of the country’s best mid-major teams.\n\nWednesday, Feb. 19, early morning\n\nAfter a night film session with the team — when the players are given a 15-question test on the next day’s opponent, in this case Monmouth, which is graded in front of them — Masiello watches more tape until 1 a.m.\n\nIt’s the fifth full game of Monmouth he’s seen in the past two days, a team the Jaspers defeated, 75-66, at home Dec. 8. After a mandatory episode of “Law & Order: SVU” on his DVR and four-plus hours of sleep, the coach awakes to game day.\n\nAfter dawn\n\nMasiello takes the morning slow, watching TV — mostly sports highlights — and hanging around the house, clearing his mind. The time for preparation has passed. The test is today. You either know it or you don’t.\n\nVery little changes on game day, outside of calls he always makes to a select circle. He’ll stop at Starbucks and check in with his assistants, before packing and making the 20-minute drive through the rain from his house in White Plains to The Bronx campus by noon.\n\n“Day of the game, all I care about is that we’re in harmony, that we’re loose and we’re in a good place,” Masiello said. “Sometimes you forget the impact you have on young men. If you’re uptight, they’re gonna be uptight.”\n\nEarly afternoon\n\nThe team is unique, successful and senior-laden, so Masiello allows them to determine whether a shootaround or walkthrough is necessary. They decline. Draddy Gymnasium is occupied at 2 p.m. anyway, when it would’ve taken place, with a press conference introducing Noah LeFevre as the new athletics director.\n\nMasiello attends, then heads upstairs to his office, which is adorned with a virtual timeline of his life — via framed photos of Charles Oakley (Masiello’s time as a Knicks ballboy), Nazr Mohammed (playing at Kentucky),\n\nLuis Flores (an assistant at Manhattan) and Rick Pitino (an assistant at Louisville).\n\nThere is a dry-erase board with next season’s projected players, and another with the MAAC standings, showcasing the success of a team Masiello thinks could win multiple NCAA Tournament games, if it can get there.\n\nThe latter is more difficult, he says.\n\nThe season had been different, a little more exhausting after being picked as the preseason favorite.\n\nSitting at his desk, Masiello recalls when everything changed.\n\nDuring a late-January skid, his friend, Brian Urlacher, was in town for the Super Bowl. The former Bears linebacker wouldn’t stop talking about how confident he was that the Seahawks would win, citing how much Seattle embraced and enjoyed its identity of defensive dominance.\n\nIt was that simple. It was that powerful.\n\nMasiello watched the game unfold as his friend foretold, and the mantra of Manhattan’s defense-fueled championship run had been built:\n\nThis is who we are. This is what we do. Let’s have fun doing it.\n\nAfternoon road trip\n\nMasiello prefers the road, and not just because the team has the most wins away from home in the country. There’s less distraction. There’s no chance his car gets locked in the parking lot, since employees at mid-major schools aren’t always aware there’s a game.\n\nThe 80-minute bus ride through New Jersey is fairly quiet. Various music plays through various players’ headphones, but the assistants are busy — Matt Grady is watching film of Siena, which would defeat the Jaspers, 67-63, two nights later, while Rasheen Davis handles recruiting.\n\nMasiello is in the front row, trading good-natured barbs with the team’s bus driver, Tony, while his mother, Kit, sits across the aisle. His late father is saved an empty chair on the bench at every game, next to Masiello’s.\n\n110 minutes until tip-off\n\nThe players grab their bags and head inside the Multipurpose Activity Center, kicking off the well-rehearsed routine. Players get dressed in a tight locker room, preparing to warm up, while the assistants set up film, draw plays and write scouting reports of each opposing player.\n\nMusic is playing. It almost always is. Masiello likes because it relaxes the players, an idea he took from Nick Saban. One rap song precedes another, playing in the background until Masiello brings it to the forefront, screaming with excitement when “Worst Behavior” by Drake comes on. The team gets excited because the coach gets excited, playing the song to witness that reaction.\n\nTip-off seems scheduled for sometime next week. Masiello hates the wait.\n\nHe breaks it up with a quick shower and a five-minute radio interview, getting by on sips of Coke since his customary Mountain Dew wasn’t available.\n\nMonmouth coach King Rice comes by for a rare locker room catch-up with the opposing coach, leaving as the players re-enter to watch film 40 minutes before the tip. The assistants run much of the meeting, with Masiello interjecting important points until taking over completely:\n\n“I want to see a genuine enjoyment on the defensive end, where you’re truly having fun, locking people up and letting them know they have no f—ing shot when the ball goes up,” Masiello yells. “Do what the f— we do and let’s get [win] No. 20.”\n\nProfanities fly from time to time, only when emphasizing a larger point. It’s used in motivation, never to demean.\n\nThe team rises, clapping before their common chant:\n\n“1, 2, 3, together! 4, 5, 6, championship!”\n\nWith the arena music seeping in, Masiello changes from sweatsuit to suit, his pockets holding a pouch of rosary beads and a picture of his grandfather. After more warm-ups, the team’s return is revealed by a steady stream of claps and yells.\n\n“That’s a good sign,” Masiello said. “That’s what I want to hear.”\n\nMore film is shown, featuring scenes from their season, as Al Pacino’s “Game of Inches” speech from “Any Given Sunday” plays in background.\n\nIt ends and Masiello begins, reiterating what he’s written on a dry-erase board:\n\n“We’re trying to hang banners, get rings, leave a legacy. If your mind is made up to what I think it is, there’s no stopping us.”\n\nMasiello stops swingman George Beamon before he leaves the locker room. On a conference call the previous day, the coach was stunned to be asked if the star senior was still in the running for MAAC Player of the Year.\n\nMasiello points out, “The writer who said that is here.”\n\n“Yeah? OK,” Beamon said, nodding, never smiling.\n\nGame time\n\nThe Jaspers jump out to a 31-15 lead and Beamon has 22 points, hitting 6-of-6 3-pointers. At halftime, Manhattan leads 41-31.\n\nThe team enters the locker room, with RaShawn Stores and Beamon pleading for better defense.\n\nMasiello enters next: “Guys, great playing. That’s Manhattan basketball.”\n\nThe players’ cheers are cut short as Masiello focuses on freshman Rich Williams.\n\n“Do you know how good you are?” the coach asks, following with a stare louder than the words.\n\nWilliams doesn’t look sure. Masiello asks again.\n\n“Do you really know how good you are? If you’re open, shoot the ball. You put too much time in your craft not to come out here and be confident. Just play.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Williams says multiple times.\n\nAfter watching film from the first half, the second half starts worse. The lead is trimmed to seven. The score has no effect on Masiello’s mannerisms, the moments do.\n\nAlmost always standing, his pacing speeds and stalls with no common thread. Often, his hands are in his pockets, as if he’s patiently waiting for a bus. But a poor possession sends his hands into the air, turning his silence into screams, as if the bus driver blew right by.\n\nGood offense gets nods of approval, but good defense gets him jumping. Up 14 with 11:47 left, Manhattan forces a shot-clock violation, sending Masiello into a fury, shouting in the face of Mike Bramucci, the director of basketball operations:\n\n“That’s who we are! That’s what we do!”\n\nThe Jaspers win, 75-61, their sixth straight victory.\n\nWho’s next?\n\nAfter briefly being locked out in the hall, the players file into the locker room with increased chatter, but aren’t overly exuberant.\n\nMasiello storms in.\n\n“Great win, guys! Congratulations on a 20-win season.”\n\nAfter praising a few players, the celebration is over in seconds, as talk turns to Siena.\n\nMasiello is also peeved that Stores, the team leader, wasn’t entirely focused during a timeout, with the team up 23 and eight minutes left. After addressing it with the team, Masiello talks to Stores alone.\n\n“Do you understand what I’m saying? I’m counting on you,” Masiello says.\n\n“Yes, yes, my bad. I was ready today, though,” Stores says.\n\n“I thought you played great. I was fine until …” the coach begins before being interrupted.\n\n“I know, I know, my fault,” Stores says.\n\n“I’m trying to get a killer instinct on this team,” Masiello says.\n\n“We’ve got a killer instinct,” Stores says. “I understand. … And T.O.E. [team over everything]. Thank you.”\n\n“You should’ve just said that,” Masiello says with a smile.\n\nAfter another quick shower, the coach overhears Davis talking about the tirade in the final minutes, when Masiello stormed after a referee following a no-call against Beamon.\n\n“Timeout! You don’t think I should’ve gone after him?” Masiello asks.\n\n“I do. I just didn’t want you to get a tech,” says Davis, who attempted to restrain him but was pushed aside. “These guys are just standing there scared to death, and I take the brunt of the punishment.”\n\nLooking at his phone, Masiello yells to the players to shut the door and get dressed. His mother is coming in to congratulate him.\n\nBack on the bus\n\nIt’s nearly 9:30 p.m. when the team heads outside. Masiello quickly converses with Rice, then reaches his seat on the bus, finding a long-elusive Mountain Dew, while pizza and sandwiches are passed around.\n\nThere’s more business conducted after the game than on the way to the game.\n\nMark Wahlberg’s “Shooter” plays on the bus TVs, but “sucks” according to Masiello, who opts for film of the game. Almost every play necessitates a pause, rewind and comment to Grady, who is sitting behind him, charting shots of Siena’s film.\n\nAfter second-guessing himself about playing Mike Alvarado too many minutes, Masiello asks Bramucci, two rows behind, what’s wrong with Rhamel Brown’s free throws (2-of-8). Bramucci says Brown is bringing it to his cheekbone, not his eyebrow.\n\n“Did you tell him?” Masiello asks. “It’s your fault if you didn’t. You got to tell him.”\n\nMasiello takes a break from the box score to look at Instagram and Twitter, then gets a text from Brown’s girlfriend, congratulating them on the win and letting him know that “Jasper nation is ready” for a run.\n\nMasiello goes to show the text to Brown, whose fallen asleep in the back of the bus, with his hood up and headphones on. Masiello takes a picture that soon hits the social networks:\n\n“Hard days work for my big fella @rhamelbrown, got him,” Masiello writes.\n\nHome again\n\nThe bus finds 244th Street and Tibbet Avenue at 10:45 p.m. and the players head into Draddy. Masiello instructs the team to rest, hydrate and go to class, adding to be smart and safe, in reference to the arrests of St.\n\nFrancis Brooklyn players facing sexual assault allegations.\n\nThe coach finally shows Brown the post, with Brown confused, then amused upon realizing who it’s from. Masiello heads upstairs to his office and asks the staff to meet for two minutes.\n\nOver the next 17 minutes, Masiello gets health updates from the trainer on the players (treatment is scheduled for 10:45 a.m.) and the staff goes over the next game’s referees, the hotel and what food to bring on the bus, which leaves in 13 hours.\n\nMasiello, still upset about Stores, asks Roberto Colonette — his former player and current strength-and-conditioning coach — to explain to the players that they can’t underestimate the game at Siena, where the team has not won in Masiello’s tenure.\n\n“The older guys already understand, it’s the younger guys …” Colonette says, prior to what became a four-point loss.\n\nAt 11:20 p.m., Masiello finally leaves the office to head home, getting picked up by his girlfriend, who asks detailed questions about the game, with Kit and his aunt in the backseat. When Masiello states he wasn’t thrilled with Brown’s performance, his mother is stunned, defending the senior as if it was her son:\n\n“You didn’t think Rhamel played great tonight? I thought he was great.”\n\nFriday, they followed the Siena loss with a win over Iona, raising the Jaspers’ mark to 21-7. Today, they play host to Canisius in their regular-season finale.\n\nNext stop: the MAAC Tournament, where an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament is on the line, in Springfield, Mass., beginning this coming Friday. That is where Masiello knows the legacy of the senior-laden squad ultimately will be weighed.\n\nHe is confident in what will happen if his players do what they do — and have fun doing it."
