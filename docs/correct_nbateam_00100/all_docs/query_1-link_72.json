        "text": "Marcus Camby's time as a Toronto Raptor appears like it will be very short-lived, as the Raptors are expected to buy out the final two years of his contract. Camby has about $8.5 million left on his deal, although the second year isn't fully guaranteed.\n\nCamby was recently traded to Toronto as part of the Andrea Bargnani deal. However, the Raptors have little use for a 39-year-old big man with foot problems who's owed over $4 million next season. Hence the talk of a buyout. If this goes as expected, several contenders have expressed interest in Camby, including the Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets.\n\nThe Clippers and Bulls make some sense for Camby, as both teams are looking for some center help. Blog a Bull says that while Camby may be a little too similar to current backup center Nazr Mohammed, Camby could have more upside if he stays healthy:\n\nSo yeah, this search wasn't ever going to get the cream of the crop. Camby's last season could've been just an aberration and he has another good one left. Or he could finally be toast. Given that Nazr Mohammed is signed under a similar perspective, they may not want to give this roster spot to someone quite so similar, but I'd say the upside for Camby is higher if he can regain his form.\n\nCamby played just 24 games last season for the New York Knicks due to recurring plantar fasciitis. And when Camby did play, he played very little.\n\nThe Rockets' interest stems from the fact that Camby lives and trains in Houston.\n\nBucks amnesty Gooden\n\nDrew Gooden has played for nine different teams over the course of his 11-year NBA career, and that could soon reach double-digits. The Milwaukee Bucks amnestied Gooden on Tuesday, wiping his salary off the books to help create a bit more cap flexibility.\n\nGooden was set to earn about $13.3 million over the next two seasons from Milwaukee. The veteran will still get his money, but anything the Bucks pay won't count against their cap. Gooden must now go through the amnesty waiver process, where teams under the cap get their first shot at bidding on him.\n\nGooden barely played last year, seeing the floor just 151 minutes total and spending most of his time on the bench in a suit. The Bucks tried to move him throughout the season, but were unable to get the right deal.\n\nBobcats, Henderson still discussing new deal\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats are still having ongoing discussions with restricted free agent Gerald Henderson, but the two sides are still not close on money, according to Yahoo! Sports' Marc Spears.\n\nIt was reported last week that the Bobcats were seeking out potential trade partners in order to execute a sign-and-trade, but nothing has come to fruition.\n\nHenderson has spent all four of his NBA seasons in Charlotte, averaging 11.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists. He averaged a career-high 15.5 points in 68 games last season.\n\nLucas agrees to join Jazz\n\nThe Utah Jazz needed a point guard to back up Trey Burke, and they have found one in John Lucas III, who has agreed to sign with the team.\n\nThe terms of the deal are unknown, but Bill Oram of The Salt Lake Tribune reports that Lucas will receive more than the five-year minimum salary of $1.03 million.\n\nLucas averaged 5.3 points and 1.7 assists in 13.1 minutes per game last season with the Toronto Raptors, but he may get a bigger opportunity being the primary backup to Burke.\n\nRaptors amnesty Kleiza\n\nIn addition to likely buying out Camby, the Raptors have wiped Linas Kleiza's $4.6 million salary off their books by using the amnesty provision on the small forward. Kleiza had picked up his option for the 2013-14 season.\n\nKleiza played just 376 minutes last season. If Kleiza clears through amnesty waivers, there's a chance that the 28-year-old will head overseas to play in Europe.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Flannery: The Kings start over\n\n• Ziller: Fighting over Rockets fans’ money\n\n• The Lakers' weird season, as seen from the end of the bench\n\n• Kent Bazemore, more than a hype man| Warriors committing to defense"
