        "text": "It’s fairly pointless for me to link to this, as I’m sure anyone who reads this site also reads KSR, probably with a much, much higher frequency than they do Lexpats. But here is Matt Jones’ recent piece on Rick Pitino, which is definitely the best thing I’ve read on Pitino and the current state of his program in a good while. Jones hits the nail square on the head with this one. For anyone that grew up watching Kentucky play in the early to mid-90’s, the current state of mediocrity that Pitino and Louisville find themsevles in seems unfathomable. For people my age, it’s impossible to forget the times when Pitino was considered the hottest commodity in the sport. He was labeled a genius and an innovator, a guy who’d changed the landscape of college basketball with his novel style of play and masterful motivation techniques. Those days are long gone, and for people who only know the Pitino that failed miserably with the Celtics and/or has been wildly inconsistent with the Cardinals, this piece is a must-read.\n\nFiled under: Links, Rick Pitino | Tagged: Matt Jones | 2 Comments »\n\nYesterday, my cousin and I had an email exchange discussing Adrian Wojnarowski’s Twitter Page, which at the time was doubling as a tool to publicly crucify Rick Pitino. Some of Woj’s gems from 24 hours ago included:\n\n“What kills Pitino are the stories are of him courting NBA teams, not them courting him. That’s the embarrassment for him. He’s desperate.”\n\n“Pitino saying he hasn’t had direct NBA conversations in 9 years is false, but mostly he uses 3rd parties. That’s what he’s using with Nets.”\n\nAnd my personal favorite (even though I hope to God it doesn’t become a reality):\n\n“Here’s Pitino’s nighmare scenario: Gets Nets job, puts Commonwealth in rear view and …LeBron decides to take Cal to the Knicks with him.”\n\nThe email exchange concluded with an agreement that instead of cranking out 8,000 tweets in a single afternoon, Woj’s energy may be better spent writing a column on the whole matter.\n\nWell, consider those prayers answered. Wojnarowski’s column appeared on Yahoo today under the headline: From Russia, with love: Nets eye Coack K? But all the Pitino despisers out there will be happy to learn that Woj didn’t lose an ounce of that Pitino trashing zeal he showed flashes of yesterday in his tweets:\n\n“Pitino understood that new Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, the Russian billionaire, wants to hire an immense figure to coach the franchise. Pitino mistakenly believed he could still be packaged as a transformative A-list hire in the New York market. Those days are over, and Pitino is seen as something of a desperate and diminished figure. Everyone knows he wants out of college and treats his denials for what they are: a mechanism to protect his recruiting, to deflect the embarrassment of appearing unwanted.”\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski: From Russia, with love: Nets eye Coach K?\n\nFiled under: Links, Rick Pitino | Tagged: Adrian Wojnarowski, Rick Pitino | Leave a comment »"
