        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Don't look now, but the Thunder is getting old(er).\n\nThe franchise that relocated from Seattle four seasons ago quickly became the new kids on the NBA block.\n\nLocated smack-dab in the middle of a college-crazed state, Oklahoma City finally turned pro and had done so with a bunch of college-aged kids.\n\nGone are the Thunder's growing pains of youth. As sole owners of the NBA's best record at 16-3, the time has come to reap some rewards.\n\n\"I knew we were going to be young for a lot of years,\" OKC coach Scott Brooks said. \"Any team with an excuse, they're going to use it. We never used our age as an excuse and we never will.\"\n\nThe longer the current Thunder roster remains status quo, the more steadily the franchise will evolve from young to old.\n\nKevin Durant and Russell Westbrook have signed five-year extensions. Kendrick Perkins and Nick Collison have four-year deals, and OKC is hoping James Harden and Serge Ibaka will soon accept four-year extensions themselves. Perhaps Eric Maynor also will stick around. Thabo Sefolosha is signed for two more seasons after this. Rookie guard Reggie Jackson is just getting started.\n\nIf all the aforementioned remained on the roster through the 2014-15 season, the Thunder's average age would be roughly three years older than what it is now (depending on the status of veterans Nazr Mohammed and Royal Ivey). That would rank OKC as the league's sixth oldest team rather than the sixth youngest, which is where it currently ranks (see chart).\n\nIf you think other NBA franchises are envious of what the Thunder has right now — and they are — imagine the fawning three or four years down the road if these guys are still teammates in OKC.\n\nLike a fine wine, the Thunder has gotten better with age, although they're still a solid decade away from being considered \"aging.\" Durant and Westbrook recently turned 23, while Harden and Ibaka are still 22.\n\nGolden State coach Mark Jackson frequently shook his head while discussing the Thunder before and after Friday night's 120-109 loss to OKC at Oracle Arena. Jackson wasn't just shaking his head about the present, but also the potential future.\n\nNo matter what average age the OKC roster is three or four years from now, if Scott Brooks also has remained on as coach, he'll treat them the same way he has the past three-plus seasons.\n\nBrooks insists he doesn't coach youth any differently.\n\n\"I never did,\" Brooks said. \"To me, you sign up for the NBA, you have to be treated like an NBA player. You have to take yourself out of the equation and think about the team. If you're working as hard as you have to work, your team is going to get better. Young players, old players, they all want to be put in a position for success.\"\n\nThe OKC roster is so revered, the San Francisco Chronicle on Saturday ran a story involving Thunder backups who rarely leave the bench.\n\nOn Jan. 4, the Warriors signed reserve guard Nate Robinson, who had little chance at playing time in OKC this season and was waived Dec. 24. Robinson has excelled for Golden State, just as Byron Mullens and D.J. White have performed commendably for Charlotte since being traded there by the Thunder.\n\nIf those OKC table scraps are that good, the Chronicle suggested Golden State might consider acquiring players like center Cole Aldrich and forward Lazar Hayward, who are averaging roughly 6.0 minutes per game so far this season.\n\nIs the Thunder simply better at helping draft choices reach their potential?\n\n\"I don't look at it that way,\" Brooks said. \"I don't compare our organization with other teams. We have to do what works for us and what we do. I like what we do. I believe in developing players. If you don't, you're not doing your job, I don't think. I've always believed that coaching is working your players every day to get their maximum potential out.\n\n\"I think the best coaches work their players every day. You're fair. You're demanding. I just feel if you've got a team that wants to be coached, you have a better chance of improving. (Thunder general manager) Sam Presti has done a great job of drafting players who want to be coached.\"\n\nAverage age of NBA rosters\n\nTwo seasons ago, OKC had the NBA's youngest roster and at one point was only slightly older than Butler's roster at that year's Final Four. The Thunder has since aged to become the sixth-youngest group.\n\nTEAM; AVG. AGE\n\n(AS OF JAN. 26)\n\n1. Sacramento Kings; 25.039 years\n\n2. Minnesota Timberwolves; 25.341\n\n3.
