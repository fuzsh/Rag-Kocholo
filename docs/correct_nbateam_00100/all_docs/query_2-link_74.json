        "text": "Over the past several weeks, the Lakers have looked into available wing talent that features Quincy Miller. The Lakers came out of last week’s free agency workouts without delivering a deal, and while no deal has been reached yet with Clark, they are expected to have an elevated urgency due to the recent season-ending injury to Xavier Henry.\n\nClark, 26, had his most productive NBA run with the Lakers in the 2012-13 season. He was an afterthought in the franchise’s trade for Dwight Howard, but averaged 7.3 points and 5.5 rebounds per game and secured a multi-year contract in the 2013 offseason.\n\nClark lasted half of last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers before signing a pair of 10-day contracts with the New York Knicks. He averaged 4.8 points and 2.6 rebounds in 54 total games. […] Clark was the 14th overall draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in 2009 out of Louisville. He has played five NBA seasons with Phoenix, Orlando, the Lakers, Cleveland and New York."
