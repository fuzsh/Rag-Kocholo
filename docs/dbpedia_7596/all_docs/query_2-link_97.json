        "text": "Barcelona and Real Madrid have won most Supercopa de Espana\n\nFour of the five years of the Supercopa de Espana have been hosted by Saudi Arabia, with the coronavirus pandemic of 2020–21 providing the lone break.\n\nAll of this is part of a plan to transform the Kingdom into a destination for sports, complete with world boxing championship matches, WWE PPVs, a boxing fight between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou, and eventually the 2034 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe Spanish Football Federation oversees the tournament, and each team are Spanish. However, since this is contemporary football, things are not so easy.\n\nSince money talks in sports, the Saudi Arabians have agreed to pay the Spanish federation €30 million for each tournament edition till 2029.\n\nTop four players with most goals in 2023\n\nTop six players with most assists in 2023\n\nBest goals scored in football in 2023: Ranked\n\nTop 10 best footballers of 2023: Ranked\n\nBest football matches of 2023: Ranked\n\nAlthough the federation has benefited financially from it, players and supporters did not agree with the choice. Raul Garcia, a midfielder for Athletic Bilbao, called it “complete nonsense” and maintained that “fans have been forgotten” since “football now is all about making money and finding sponsors.” In 2022.\n\nImmediately after the decision was made, the now-disgraced Luis Rubiales defended it, saying, “We took a game that was forgotten in the middle of summer and made it into an international event.”\n\nAlso Read: Where and how to watch Supercopa de Espana 2023-24?\n\nHeld at the Al-Awwal Stadium, home of Cristiano Ronaldo‘s Al Nassr, is the 2023–24 edition.\n\nSimilar to Spain, Italy has made progress in that three of the next five Supercoppa Italiana editions will be held in Saudi Arabia, according to an agreement inked in 2018 with the General Sports Authority.\n\nThe 2023 Supercoppa, which will follow Spain’s structure, will take place in January 2024 and be the inaugural event to have four teams.\n\nThe Copa del Rey winners and the LaLiga winners were both in rivalry for the majority of the previous 40 years, but in recent years, modifications have been made.\n\nThe defending Liga and Copa del Rey winners, together with the runners-up in each competition, have faced off in the semifinals since the conclusion of the 2019–20 season.\n\nAlthough the competition began in 1982, a comparable competition was held in Spain from 1940 to 1953, and it constitutes one of the most coveted domestic trophies that may be won."
