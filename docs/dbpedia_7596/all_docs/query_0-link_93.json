It has historically been one of Europe's absolute top teams and remain so today.\n\nThe club was founded by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan men in 1899, and were one of the founding teams of La Liga in 1928. Along with Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao, they have never been relegated from La Liga.\n\nThe club motto is més que un club, which means more than a club, and if any of Europe's top team deserves that motto, it is FC Barcelona.\n\n© footballticketsbarcelona.com\n\nFC Barcelona logos\n\nIn more than 100 years of existence, FC Barcelona has had 12 different versions of his logo. All of them feature the Catalan flag, the English flag, and the Blaugrana (Red and Blue) stripes. The changes only affected the design and shape of the crest. One can note that during the rule of Franco, from 1939 up until 1974, the initials FCB, catalan for Futbol Club Barcelona, were changed to CFB, Spanish for Club de Futbol Barcelona.\n\nFC Barcelona anthem : El Cant del Barça\n\nThe official anthem was commissioned in 1974 to celebrate the club's 75th anniversary. It is known as the \"Cant del Barça\" and was written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.\n\nTot el camp És un clam\n\nSom la gent blaugrana\n\nTant se val d’on venim\n\nSi del sud o del nord\n\nAra estem d’acord Estem d’acord\n\nUna bandera ens agermana\n\nBlaugrana al vent\n\nUn crit valent\n\nTenim un nom que el sap tothom BARÇA BARÇA BARÇA!!!\n\nJugadors Seguidors\n\nTots units fem força\n\nSón molts anys plens d’afanys\n\nSón molts gols que hem cridat\n\nI s’ha demostrat s’ha demostrat\n\nQue mai ningú no ens podrà tòrcer\n\nBlaugrana al vent\n\nUn crit valent\n\nTenim un nom que el sap tothom BARÇA BARÇA BARÇA!!!\n\nVideo Cant del Barça Clasico FC Barcelona - Real Madrid\n\nMore on the FC Barcelona anthem : translation\n\nFC Barcelona in recent years\n\nFC Barcelona is the first Spanish team to win the treble : Spanish League, Champions League and Spanish Cup during the 2008-2009 season with their new coach Pep Guardiola, former FC Barcelona captain in the 90's.
