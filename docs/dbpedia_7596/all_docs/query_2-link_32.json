However, the Blaugrana have lost six of their seven Super Cup finals against Real Madrid and are still to win a title after the new four-team format was introduced.\n\nReal Madrid and Barcelona booked their places for the first El Clasico of 2023 by beating Valencia and Real Betis in the semi-finals, respectively.\n\nReal Madrid, who are one shy of equalling Barcelona’s record of 13 Super Cup titles, won their semi-final 4-2 in the penalty shootout after Karim Benzema’s first-half goal from the spot was cancelled out by Valencia in the second-half.\n\nBarcelona, meanwhile, took the lead twice against Real Betis through Robert Lewandowski and Ansu Fati but had to win the match through penalties.\n\nBoth coaches - Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti and Barcelona’s Xavier Hernandez - are expected to field full-strength sides with no injury concerns reported ahead of the final, which will be played in front of over 60,000 fans in attendance.\n\nIt will also be the first Real Madrid vs Barcelona final in a knockout tournament in over five years.\n\nIn the Spanish Super Cup 2021-22 final, Real Madrid defeated Athletic Bilbao 2-0 courtesy of goals from Luka Modric and Karim Benzema.\n\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona Spanish Super Cup 2022-23 final live India start time"
