        "text": "FC Barcelona will not be in the round of 16 of the Champions League. The last time the Catalan club did not pass the group stage was in the 2000/2001 season, shortly before the current president Joan Laporta began the most glorious period of the club. For the last 20 years, Barcelona fans have become accustomed to winning to the point of considering a failure not to reach the Champions League final. No wonder. Shortly after being eliminated by Milan and Leeds United in 2001, FC Barcelona experienced an unprecedented revolution. In just a few years, its budget doubled, an increase unmatched by any other European club. The club would attract players the size of Ronaldinho, Henry or Deco, with whom it would win four Champions Leagues in ten years.\n\nNow, with the new situation - a discreet classification in the Spanish league and the elimination in Europe - everyone has hurried to look for culprits. It has not been very difficult to find some. The mismanagement of Josep Maria Bartomeu’s previous board of directors has been one of the main triggers for this crisis. But we would be wrong if we think that the main cause is to be found in the people who run the club. If so, a new president or a new coach might be enough to reverse the situation. Nor it seems that the situation can be addressed through relying on a certain style of play and certain values, a factor that has been considered key to explaining the club’s recent successes. The current problem is much deeper and goes beyond managers and philosophies. There are structural factors, eradicated in the recent political economy of Europe, which can explain more accurately Barça’s rise in the early 2000s and its decline in recent years."
