        "text": "Jason Pettigrove@ @jaypetti1971Contributor I\n\nPicking a Best Barcelona XI from the 1990s\n\n0 of 11\n\nCESAR RANGEL/Associated Press\n\nBarcelona have been lucky down the years to have squads that have rivalled the best in the world.\n\nWhether homegrown at La Masia or bought in from elsewhere, the cream of footballing talent has graced Camp Nou.\n\nAnd Barca continue to be the household name that is a huge pull for any professional footballer.\n\nBack in the 1990's, Barca's \"Dream Team\" ran riot. Even as that team eventually broke up, there were some huge international names to make their living in Blaugrana.\n\nLet's take a look at a \"Best XI\" from that decade and remember to leave your comments in the section below as to whether you agree or not with the selections...\n\nAndoni Zubizarreta\n\n1 of 11\n\nBOZIDAR VUKICEVIC/Associated Press\n\nTo criticise Andoni Zubizarreta for a number of Barca's recent failings is to conveniently forget the excellence he provided between the sticks in the 90's.\n\nA former record-appearance holder for his country, \"Zubi\" was Barca's custodian for eight years, straddling both the late eighties and early nineties.\n\nWhen Barca purchased him from Athletic Club de Bilbao for the equivalent of €1.6m, it was for a then world-record fee for a goalkeeper.\n\nAnd Zubi repaid the fee in droves and with astonishing consistency. In the four title-winning seasons, the keeper missed just four games in total.\n\nAs team captain, he was a calming presence despite the pressure of playing for one of the best teams in the world. FCBarcelona.com's own tribute on their official website reads:\n\nHe was also captain of the club for several seasons, and was noted both on and off the pitch for his serenity and psychological balance, which he was constantly able to transmit to the other players in order to get through the most difficult of match situations.\n\nAlbert Ferrer\n\n2 of 11\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nAlbert \"Chapi\" Ferrer owned the right-back slot at Barca for the best part of the decade.\n\nAfter an education in Barca's B side, he was given a chance at senior level and never really looked back.\n\nAnother key member of the Dream Team, Ferrer was small, tough and disarmingly quick. As an attacking wing-back, his style was perfectly complementary to those around him.\n\nNo circus or fanfare about him, he just took care of business with great diligence.\n\nOver 200 games played for the Catalans gives an indication of how highly thought of he was.\n\nFrank De Boer\n\n3 of 11\n\nFiro Foto/Getty Images\n\nAn accomplished defender schooled in the Ajax way, Frank De Boer was always going to settle in at Barca without any problems whatsoever.\n\nEqually comfortable in the left-back or centre-back roles, De Boer and his twin brother Ronald were signed by their old Ajax manager Louis Van Gaal in a joint £22m move.\n\nStrong in the air and quick over the ground, with supreme passing ability and the occasional eye for goal, De Boer was a brilliant all-round talent.\n\nPep Guardiola\n\n4 of 11\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nWho else could be captain of this XI than Pep Guardiola.\n\n\"Mr Barcelona,\" Pep's distinguished service throughout the years to the club of his life is an example to future generations.\n\nJoining the club at 13, he rose up through the various ranks of La Masia before becoming a regular in the senior side at 20.\n\nTactically astute even at such an early age, he became Johan Cruyff's general on the pitch.\n\nThe embodiment of the Dream Team era, Pep's role as pivot was instrumental in the successes of the team at that time.\n\nA natural captain and leader, it can't be a surprise to anyone that Guardiola has gone on to enjoy such wonderful success as a manager.\n\nRonald Koeman\n\n5 of 11\n\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nRonald Koeman will always be remembered as the man who scored \"that\" goal.\n\nA thunderbolt of a free-kick during extra-time at Wembley that would win Barcelona their first-ever European Cup.\n\nIndeed, that strike meant he became the first player to score in consecutive European finals, having netted a consolation for the Catalans in the 2-1 defeat in the 1991 European Cup Winners Cup Final against Manchester United.\n\nFor a player in his position, Koeman would score a hefty amount during his Barca career. A defender-cum-midfielder by trade, goals were also unusually his forte. Getting 67 in 192 appearances is a super return.\n\nYet, we shouldn't stray too far away from his primary role. Koeman was a fearsome competitor who was combative in the tackle and was never one to pull out of a challenge.\n\nSolid and dependable.\n\nGheorghe Popescu\n\n6 of 11\n\nCESAR RANGEL/Associated Press\n\nNot one of the names that would perhaps readily spring to mind, but the unheralded Gheorghe Popescu certainly deserves his place in this line up.\n\nSigning from Tottenham Hotspur in 1995, Popescu succeeded Ronald Koeman in the side and would be made captain not long after joining.\n\nA masterful tactical brain with a solid defensive ethic, allied to an ability to bring the ball out of the defence is what set the Romanian apart from his contemporaries.\n\nThe Catalans won the Copa del Rey and UEFA Cup Winners Cup under his captaincy, before Popescu departed to Turkey after two seasons.\n\nGheorghe Hagi\n\n7 of 11\n\nCESAR RANGEL/Associated Press\n\nGheorghe Hagi is widely considered to be the best Romanian footballer of all time, and his moniker of \"The Maradona of the Carpathians\" was well deserved.\n\nDespite an earlier association with Real Madrid, Hagi's incredible skill set soon won Barca's fan base around.\n\nAlthough he only spent two seasons in Catalonia, signing directly after the 1994 World Cup, Hagi became a crowd favourite well before he moved on to new pastures with Galatasaray.\n\nArguably one of the most skillful players to pull on the Blaugrana.\n\nHristo Stoichkov\n\n8 of 11\n\nDENIS DOYLE/Associated Press\n\nHristo Stoichov was loved by the fans as much for his temper as his prowess in front of goal.\n\nA spiky character, the Bulgarian was a fearsome striker with a cannonball-shot.\n\nHe reached his zenith while at Barcelona and at the same time on the international stage.\n\nIn the space of four seasons in the early 90's, he was a regular in the side that won four La Liga titles and a European Cup, Barca's first, at Wembley in 1992.\n\nOn a personal level, he was top scorer at the 1994 World Cup, winner of the European Golden Shoe and a Ballon d'Or winner.\n\nHe will live long in the memories of cules everywhere.\n\nRonaldo\n\n9 of 11\n\nDENIS DOYLE/Associated Press\n\nUntil Lionel Messi arrive on the scene, no one had ever come close to matching the numbers produced by Ronaldo in the mid-1990's.\n\nSigning from PSV Eindhoven, big things were expected of the 20-year-old and he didn't disappoint.\n\nStocky and powerful, opposition sides simply couldn't live with him and 47 goals in 51 appearances speaks volumes.\n\nWhat a shame that Barca fans only got to see him for a solitary season because of a fall out with club directors, per FC Barcelona.com.\n\nHis most memorable strike remains the one he scored at Compostela, and his goals helped the Catalans to hoover up the Spanish Super Cup, Copa del Rey and Cup Winners' Cup in that 1996-97 campaign.\n\nRomario\n\n10 of 11\n\nMichael Laudrup\n\n11 of 11\n\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nOne of a handful of players to play for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Michael Laudrup is still held in the highest esteem by both clubs and both sets of fans.\n\nBarcelona even refer to him on their official website as:\n\nThe artist of the Dream Team, a creative striker of such elegance that it was often joked that he was the kind of player that could play in a coat and tails.\n\nHe seemed able to effortlessly and seamlessly produce skilful play after skilful play.\n\nFor reasons unknown, Laudrup hadn't settled at Juventus and Barca stepped in to sign him in 1989. He would go on to be as important as any other in the Dream Team.\n\nHis range of passing was a delight and accuracy in successfully completing long or short ball, unsurpassed.\n\nA creator supreme, his goals-to-games ratio wasn't too shabby either. 93 in 288 games is virtually one goal in every three games.\n\nAn excellent return for a player who was as far removed from a natural striker as it's possible to be.\n\nX"
