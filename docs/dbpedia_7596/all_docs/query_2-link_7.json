        "text": "A new edition of the Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona will take place on Sunday when the two teams meet in the Spanish Super Cup final.\n\nThe King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, will be the venue for this match, the 16th meeting between the two sides in this competition.\n\nThis makes 2022/23 the ninth edition of the Spanish Super Cup to feature a Clasico.\n\nHow many times have Real Madrid and Barcelona met in the Spanish Super Cup?\n\nLos Merengues and Los Cules have met in eight editions of the Spanish Super Cup previously, seven times in the two-legged format and once in the final-four format.\n\nFrom those eight ties, Real Madrid have dominated their opponents in by emerging victorious seven times and being beaten just once, in 2012.\n\nHistory of Spanish Super Cup Clasicos\n\nIn 1988, the first Clasico was played in a Super Cup as Real Madrid ended up beating Barcelona 2-0 at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe return leg at the Camp Nou gave the title to Real Madrid as Barcelona came back from Emilio Butragueno's strike to win 2-1 on the night, but to still be beaten on aggregate.\n\nIn 1990, the two teams met again in the tournament, and this time the scoreline was even more emphatic, with Los Merengues winning by a 4-1 scoreline in the capital after a 1-0 win in Barcelona in the first leg.\n\nThree years later, another Clasico took place and the score was 4-2 on aggregate in favour of Los Blancos, with a 3-1 win at the Bernabeu followed by a 1-1 draw at Camp Nou.\n\nIn 1997, Real Madrid and Barcelona also featured in the season curtain-raiser and the Catalan side were in control after a 2-1 win in the first leg, but Real Madrid won the second fixture 4-1 in Madrid.\n\nIn 2012, Barcelona were finally able to beat Real Madrid with three goals from Lionel Messi across the two legs, first in a 2-2 draw at the Bernabeu and then in a 3-2 win for the Catalans at Camp Nou.\n\nA year later, the aggregate score was 4-4, but with a Real Madrid victory, due to the double value of goals scored away from home after a 3-2 win for Barcelona in Catalonia and a 2-1 win for Real Madrid in the capital.\n\nThe year 2018 was the last time it was held with the home-and-away format, without semi-finals, and it would also be the last one played on Spanish territory.\n\nIn that edition, Real Madrid were once again victorious with a 5-1 aggregate win as they won both legs, 3-1 at Camp Nou and 2-0 at the Bernabeu.\n\nThe last Saudi Arabian Clasico\n\nIn January of last year, Los Cules and Los Merengues met in the semi-finals on Saudi Arabian soil.\n\nThe match was a semi-final, rather than the final as it will be this year and has been for all previous meetings."
