        "text": "Barcelona Events 2024\n\nSpanish Super Cup - Supercopa de España 2019\n\nSevilla - FC Barcelona\n\nDate of game: 8th to 12th January 2020\n\nKick-off time: KO time\n\nStadium: Saudi Arabia\n\nTeams: Valencia, FC Barcelona. Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid\n\nWhere to watch in Spain:\n\nUntil 2019 Spanish Supercup was played in August every year and was traditionally a two match encounter between the winners of the previous Spanish seasons league and cup called La Liga and the Copa del Rey.\n\nThe 2019-20 Supercopa de España will be the 36th edition of the Supercopa de España\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the competition format would be changed from a two-team format, to a four-team \"final four\" format which would include a semi-final round.\n\nThe first round will be two semi-finals which will be played on January 8th and 9th, 2020\n\nThe final will be January 12th 2020. There will not be a third-place game.\n\nThe four teams in the Spanish Super Cup - Supercopa de España 2019-20 are the finalists from the 2018–19 Copa del Rey match and the remaining highest ranked teams from the 2018–19 La Liga that had not already qualified through the cup final.\n\nThis means that in 2019-20 the 4 teams are Valencia, FC Barcelona. Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid\n\nAll three games will be in the same city in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFormer way Supercopa was organised\n\nThe Supercup winners are the Superchampions of Spain - supercampeones de España.\n\nIf the same team wins both titles - as FC Barcelona did in 2017/18 season - then the runners up of the Copa del Rey final play the Liga winners in the Supercopa de España final.\n\nIn 2018, for the first time ever, the Spanish Super Cup was not played in Spain but in Tangier, Morocco. Also in 2018, for the first time ever, the Spanish Super Cup was not played over two legs but in one final match.\n\nIt was also the first official game in a Spanish football competition in which video-arbitration technology ( VAR ) was used.\n\nThe Supercopa de España 2018 match kick off was at the Stade Ibn Batouta in Tangier on Sunday, 12 August at 21:00 BST - 10pm Spanish time\n\nshortlink bit.ly/mEzKxz\n\n© Copyright Barcelonayellow.com\n\nDo not copy any text on this page without permission\n\nAll rights reserved."
