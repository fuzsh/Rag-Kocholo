        "text": "Football, known as The Beautiful Game has had its’ fair share of superstars. Below, I’ve compiled a side from 11 of these players, whom, I believe at their peaks form the greatest team you could assemble throughout the history of the game.\n\nThe side will play in a 3–4–2–1 formation, in the style of Johan Cruyff when he managed Ajax and Barcelona. This formation will allow the team to play a high tempo attacking game with control exerted from the midfield. A strong, mobile defence will back up a blistering strike force, that should overpower even the greatest sides throughout history.\n\nThe below, is of course, my opinion and open to debate.\n\nWhilst listing the trophies won by each player, I have given the current name of any competitions that have been renamed and given translated names of competitions that are less well known or don’t have a self evident translation.\n\nI have not included any players still currently playing, as of course, it is easier to reflect on a players’ career after it is finished.\n\nGK- Lev Yashin\n\nNation — USSR\n\nClubs — Dynamo Moscow (1950–1970)\n\nHonours — Soviet Top League (1954, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1963), Soviet Cup (1953, 1967, 1970), Olympic Gold (1956), European Championship (1960).\n\nThe only goalkeeper to win the Ballon d’Or, Yashin saved over 150 penalties in his career. Nicknamed “The Black Spider”, the Soviet stopper was the first recognised sweeper-keeper, coming out to meet attackers and dictate play. Possessed cat like reflexes and won the inaugural European Championships, four years after winning Olympic gold and impressing audiences at the 1958 World Cup. Also won the Soviet ice hockey Cup as a goaltender for Dynamo Moscow’s team in 1953, honing his shot stopping ability in another sport. Named by IFFHS as best goalkeeper of the 20th Century.\n\nYashin passed away in March 1990, aged 60, after a battle with stomach cancer.\n\nCB — Alessandro Nesta\n\nNation — Italy\n\nClubs — Lazio (1993–2002), AC Milan (2002–2012), Montreal Impact (2012–2013), Chennaiyin (2014).\n\nHonours — Serie A (2000, 2004, 2011), Coppa Italia (1998, 2000, 2003), Supercoppa Italiana (1998, 2000, 2004, 2011), Canadian Championship (2013), Champions League (2003, 2007), UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup (1999), UEFA Super Cup (1999, 2003, 2007), FIFA World Club Cup (2007), World Cup (2006).\n\nAlessandro Nesta broke into the Lazio team at just 17 and would be named captain at just 22 in 1998. A big money move to AC Milan followed where Nesta showed his ability as a fine defender, with excellent tackling and reading of the game. Called up as part of three World Cup squads but injuries meant he never played a knockout game. Having faced 11 major surgeries in his career, his class still shone through. In 2012, Nesta faced Lionel Messi, 11 years his junior, who was on his way to hitting 93 goals in a calendar year. In a tight Champions League match a 35 year old Nesta put the Argentine firmly in his back pocket at the Camp Nou. His pace may have begun to leave him, but Nesta was always an elegant defender and a tight marker.\n\nCB — Bobby Moore\n\nNation — England\n\nClubs — West Ham United (1958–1974), Fulham (1974–1977), San Antonio Thunder (loan, 1976), Seattle Sounders (1978), Herning Fremad (1978), Carolina Lightnin’ (1983).\n\nHonours- FA Cup (1964), UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup (1965), World Cup (1966).\n\nThe only English captain to win the World Cup, Moore was a complete defender with excellent vision and exceptional reading of the game, always seeming two steps ahead of the opposition. An early pioneer at ball playing defending under the tutelage of Malcolm Allison in his early days at West Ham, he got two assists in the 1966 World Cup final. His 1970 tackle on Jairzinho is regarded as the best of all time, showing calmness and precision. Also lauded for great leadership skills and professionalism.\n\nMoore passed away in February 1993, aged 51, following a battle with bowel cancer.\n\nCB- Paolo Maldini\n\nNation — Italy\n\nClub- AC Milan (1985–2009)\n\nHonours- Serie A (1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004), Coppa Italia (2003), Suppercopa Italiana (1992, 1993, 2004), Champions League (1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007), UEFA Super Cup (1989, 1990, 2003, 2007), Intercontinental Cup (1989, 1990), FIFA World Club Cup (2007).\n\nThe son of another AC Milan legend, Cesare, Maldini broke into the Rossonieri at the age of 17 forming a formidable partnership with Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta, and remaining a mainstay for 24 years, going onto make over 900 appearances for the San Siro club and 126 for Italy. Originally a right back, Maldini played a significant portion of his career on the the left, such was his athleticism and ability with both feet. Full of energy and stamina, Maldini was an excellent crosser of the ball, who moved back to primarily playing centre-half in the late stretches of his career, showing his tackling ability and reading of the game. A strong defender, he would form another formidable partnership with Nesta. His longevity allowed him to develop excellent leadership and use his experience to help younger squad members.\n\nDM-Fernando Redondo\n\nNation- Argentina\n\nClubs- Argentinos Juniors (1985–1990), Tenerife (1990–1994), Real Madrid (1994–2000), AC Milan (2000–2004).\n\nHonours- La Liga (1995, 1997), Serie A (2004), Coppa Italia (2003), Champions League (1998, 2000, 2003), Intercontinental Cup (1998), Confederations Cup (1992), Copa America (1993).\n\nAn obscure choice perhaps, but that is due to the player being underrated as he went about his game expertly with minimal fuss. That Real’s demanding fans deemed fit to nickname him El Principe (The Prince) is testament to Redondo’s ability. Excellent defensively and offensively, a tough marker (just ask Rivaldo who played against him for both Brazil and Barcelona) and possessing a fantastic range of skills, Redondo was an expert at transition defence to offence. Sir Alex Ferguson remarked he must have “magnets” in his boots after an impressive performance for Los Blancos at Old Trafford on their away to the 2000 Champions League, where Redondo was voted Player of the Tournament. That performance will be remembered for a ridiculous piece of skill to back heel the ball around Henning Berg to set up Raul. His departure lead to protests outside the Santiago Bernabeu. Injuries meant he only made 16 Serie A appearances for AC Milan and none in his first two seasons, he suspended his salary and attempted to return the car and house the club bought for him, reflective of the modesty that he showed in many a professional performance.\n\nCM- Zinedine Zidane\n\nNation- France\n\nClubs- Cannes (1989–1992), Bordeaux (1992–1996), Juventus (1996–2001), Real Madrid (2001–2006).\n\nHonours- Serie A (1997, 1998), Supercoppa Italiana (1997), La Liga (2003), Supercopa de Espana (2003), UEFA Intertoto Cup (1995, 1999), UEFA Super Cup (1996, 2002), Champions League (2002), Intercontinental Cup (1996, 2002), World Cup (1998), European Championship (2000).\n\nA relative late bloomer, Zidane was the most creative player of his generation. Possessing elegant control, almost an art form in itself as well as excellent vision, skills and dribbling ability. Tall and strong too, Zidane produced on the big occasion, scoring twice as France won the 1998 World Cup on home soil, having not qualified in the previous two editions and a fantastic volley to win the 2002 Champions League. Despite his controversial sending off in the final, Zidane was unplayable at the 2006 World Cup, his performance against Brazil, despite being 34, has to be one of the greatest individual performances of all time.\n\nCM- Laszlo Kubala\n\nNations- Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Spain.\n\nClubs- Ganz (1944), Ferencvaros (1945–1946), Slovan Bratislava (1946–1948), Vasas (1948–1949), Pro Patria (1949–1950), Hungaria (1950), Barcelona (1951–1961), Espanyol (1963–1965), Zurich (1965–1967), Toronto Thunder (1967).\n\nHonours — La Liga (1952, 1953, 1959, 1960), Copa del Rey (1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959), Europa League (1958, 1960), Latin Cup (1952), Copa Eva Duarte (1952, 1953).\n\nNamed ahead of Lionel Messi as Barcelona’s greatest player of all time, Kubala who played for three international teams was a superstar, possessing pace, composure, being a fantastic dribbler and powerful finisher, a fierce man who was popular amongst his peers, Kubala was the best player in the world during the early 1950s and being placed in political limbo preventing him asserting his dominance on the international scene. Was the catalyst for the Blaugrana’s first spell of domestic dominance, in a difficult period due to Franco’s control over Spain. Was awarded a testimonial match for the Catalan XI aged 65 in 1993.\n\nKubala passed away in May 2002, after a long illness, a few weeks short of his 75th birthday.\n\nAM- Pele\n\nNation — Brazil\n\nClubs — Santos (1956–1974), New York Cosmos (1974–1977).\n\nHonours — Brazilian Serie A (1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1968), Sao Paulo State Championship (1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1973), Torneio Rio-Sao Paulo (1959, 1963, 1964), NASL Atlantic Championship (1977), NASL Soccer Bowl (1977), Copa Libertadores (1962, 1963), Intercontinental Cup (1962, 1963), World Cup (1958, 1962, 1970).\n\nPele was a perfect attacker, able to play in any forward position or in midfield, he was prolific with both feet and was fast and read the game perfectly, a fine header of the ball at just 5ft8 inches, he was the also one of the first to use now common Samba style tricks, an early pioneer for the style of play. He refused to take penalties, regarding it as a cowardly way to score. His power, skills, trickery, vision, composure and anticipation wowed fans at Vila Belmiro for nearly two decades, his loyalty to Santos resulting in him turning down several big moves, including to Inter Milan and Juventus. Had a final swansong in America with New York Cosmos, helping the game reach new levels of popularity in the States. All time leading goalscorer for both club and country, statistically being the most successful goalscorer of all time.\n\nRF- Johan Cruyff\n\nNation- The Netherlands\n\nClubs- Ajax (1964–1973, 1981–1983), Barcelona (1973–1978), Los Angeles Aztecs (1978–1979), Washington Diplomats (1980–1981), Levante (1981), Feyenoord (1983–1984).\n\nHonours — Eredivisie (1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1982, 1983, 1984), KNVB Cup (1967, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1983, 1984), La Liga (1974), Copa del Rey (1978), Champions League (1971, 1972, 1973), Intercontinental Cup (1972).\n\nCruyff, who has a string of things named after him, will be regarding forever as a fine footballer, manager and ideologue. He was influential in turning the Dutch nation from a backwards football country to a powerhouse, Ajax from semi — pros to a team who won three European Cups on the bounce. It may have been the tactics of Rinus Michels, but Cruyff was the man who led Total Football on the field. Playing in a free, false nine role, the first to do so, Cruyff ran the show, acting as a coach to his teammates. He played football with his mind, understanding the game like no other, using his brains and vision and using skills not to entertain or humiliate, but to get the job done as easy as possible. It was simple and beautiful. He did much the same at Barcelona and is credited as helping the club realise their massive potential, after coming out of retirement in the US, Cruyff returned to Europe and Ajax winning more trophies and transitioning into a fantastic manager.\n\nCruyff was a heavy smoker from boyhood and had heart bypass surgery in 1991, forcing him to quit and became an anti-smoking advocate. His health forced him to quit full-time coaching in 1997. He died after a five month battle with lung cancer, in March 2016, a month short of his 69th birthday.\n\nCF- Ronaldo\n\nNation- Brazil\n\nClubs- Cruziero (1992–1994), PSV Eindhoven (1994–1996), Barcelona (1996–1997), Inter Milan (1997–2002), Real Madrid (2002–2007), AC Milan (2007–2008), Corinthians (2009–2011).\n\nHonours — Minas Gerais State Championship (1994), Sao Paulo State Championship (2009), Copa do Brazil (1993, 2009), La Liga (2003, 2007), Supercopa de Espana (1996, 2003), KNVB Cup (1996), Johan Cruijff Shield (1996), Copa del Rey (1997), UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup (1997), Europa League (1998), Intercontinental Cup (2002), World Cup (1994, 2002), Copa America (1997, 1999), Confederations Cup (1997).\n\nThe man they nicknamed El Fenemono, Ronaldo was the perfect striker. Bursting on to the scene showing strength, pace, skills, flair, he could do anything and score any type of goal. Named World Player of The Year twice by the age of 21, for comparison Messi and CR7 were 22 and 23 when they first won the award. Did well to come back from a serious injury at PSV, and his season at Barcelona and first at Inter showed him in his greatest form, his legendary strike against Compostela, showed all his fine attributes. In the 1998 UEFA Cup Final, he tore apart Nesta, then considered the finest centre-back in the world, Nesta did little wrong, Ronaldo was just too good. His signature move was get the ball outside the box, use his pace and strength to burst forward and feign the ‘keeper before rounding him and slotting into an open net. Injuries and a suspected seizure lead to four years of hell and a whole missed 2000–2001 but he returned in 2002 to score eight goals and win Brazil’s fifth World Cup. Continued to score goals, but put on weight and his body was never the same again, but when you can finish like he could, you don’t really need to be able to move. Ronaldo captured the imagination of a generation of fans, as his movement his fluidity it wasn’t artificial, it was natural, and it was unpredictable, truly beautiful to watch and football at its’ finest.\n\nLF- Ferenc Puskas\n\nNations- Hungary, Spain\n\nClubs- Budapest Honved (1943–1955), Real Madrid (1958–1966).\n\nHonours-Hungarian League (1950, 1950 [League changed from winter calendar to summer, so two seasons were contested, 1949–1950 and 1950], 1952, 1954, 1955), La Liga (1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965), Copa del Rey (1962), Champions League (1959, 1960, 1966), Intercontinental Cup (1960), Olympic Gold (1952).\n\nThe 20th Century’s top goalscorer. An absolute machine for the Mighty Magyars and Budapest Honved, Puskas spearheaded an attack and scored 84 in just 85 for Hungary, as the side lost just once in over sixty games, a shock World Cup Final defeat to West Germany in 1954. the Hungarian Revolution saw the break up of the national side, and Puskas was without a club for three years. He returned aged 31 and overweight in 1958, but continued to score goals for fun and played four matches for Spain. This goal record of 156 league goals in 180 games and 35 goals in 39 European Cup games is an impressive record, better still considering they came from initially being deployed deep behind Alfredo di Stefano. He won the La Liga golden boot four times despite his advancing age and the award for FIFA’s goal of the year and Hungary’s national stadium is named after him. If Di Stefano was an unstoppable force, Puskas was the immovable object, turning up with goals, especially on the big occasions with seven goals in his first two European Cup finals.\n\nPuskas, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2000, passed away in November 2006, from pneumonia aged 79.\n\nClubs Represented\n\nAC Milan and Real Madrid — 4\n\nBarcelona — 3\n\nAjax, Argentinos Juniors, Bordeaux, Budapest Honved, Cannes, Carolina Lightnin’ , Chennaiyin, Corinthinas, Cruziero, Dynamo Moscow, Espanyol, Ferencvaros, Feyenoord, Fulham, Ganz, Herning Fremard, Hungaria, Inter Milan, Juventus, Lazio, Levante, Los Angeles Aztecs, Montreal Impact, New York Cosmos, Pro Patria, PSV Eindhoven, San Antonio Thunder, Santos, Seattle Sounders, Slovan Bratislava, Tenerife, Toronto Thunder, Vasas, Washington Diplomats, West Ham United, Zurich — 1\n\nNations Represented (Players)\n\nBrazil, Hungary, Italy, Spain — 2\n\nArgentina, Czechoslovakia, England, France, The Netherlands, USSR — 1\n\nNations Represented (Clubs)\n\nUSA — 6\n\nHungary, Spain — 5\n\nBrazil, The Netherlands — 3\n\nCanada, England, France — 2\n\nArgentina, Denmark, India, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland — 1\n\nCombined Honours\n\nDomestic Titles — 54\n\nDomestic Cups — 28\n\nDomestic Super Cups — 13\n\nRegional Championships — 15\n\nMain Continental Championships — 17\n\nSecondary Continental Championships — 6\n\nMinor Continental Championships — 3\n\nContinental Super Cups — 9\n\nIntercontinental Tournaments — 9\n\nWorld Cups — 8\n\nEuropean Championships — 2\n\nCopa America — 3\n\nConfederations Cups — 2"
