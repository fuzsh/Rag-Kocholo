        "text": "The Spanish Super Cup victory came with a plethora of all-time firsts and new records. Perhaps the most important is that it was the first major trophy of the Xavi Hernández era, but that was just the start of the stat-fest associated to the game.\n\nIt also extended what was already a record haul of Super Cup wins. The team has now won the title 14 times, although this was the first since the introduction of the 4-team format. And it was also the first time in 18 years that Barça won a trophy without the services of Leo Messi.\n\nHistory in the making\n\nAnd it was the first time that Barça have won a competitive match on neutral territory against Real Madrid since April 1990, when goals from Guillermo Amor and Julio Salinas won the Copa del Rey Final in Valencia.\n\nIt was also the biggest win in a single-match final in the whole history of El Clásico. And the 2-0 lead at half-time was the first time in 16 games against Madrid in the Super Cup that Barça went in at the break with a lead of two or more goals.\n\nIt also meant that Barça have scored 10 goals in the first four games with Real Madrid under new coach Xavi Hernández. Only one manager has ever led the side to a higher goalscoring start in his first four Clásicos. That was Pep Guardiola, who saw his side score 11 goals in for games in 2010.\n\nSuperb Lewandowski, Pedri and Gavi\n\nIt was a truly immaculate performance from the blaugrana, who were the better side from start to finish. Lewandowski, Gavi and Pedri got the goals, but the whole team shone in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWith a goal and two assists, Gavi becomes just the fourth player to be involved in three goals in his first two Clásico appearances. Deco had three assists in 2005, Ruud van Nistelrooy scored three goals in 2007 and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice and gave one assist in 2022."
