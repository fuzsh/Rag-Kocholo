        "text": "Real Club Deportivo Mallorca, is a Spanish soccer club from the city of Palma (Balearic Islands), which was founded on March 5, 1916, under the name of Alfonso XIII Football Club. After also being called Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII Football Club and Club Deportivo Mallorca, in the 1949-1950 season, it was renamed Real Club Deportivo Mallorca. It is, officially, the best club in the history of Balearic soccer.\n\nOrigins and early history\n\nOn March 5, 1916, a new club, the Alfonso XIII Football Club, was registered with the Spanish Football Federation. A day later, the Board of Directors was constituted, headed by Adolfo Vázquez Humasqué and eight other people. On March 25, the first stadium, the Buenos Aires field, was officially inaugurated with a match between Alfonso XIII and FC Barcelona, with a victory for the visitors (0-8). In June of the same year, King Alfonso XIII de Borbón honored the team with the name of Real Sociedad, and the club was renamed Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII Football Club.\n\nIn 1917, the Catalan Federation admitted Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII to take part in the Catalan Second Division Championship, as the unofficial champion of the Balearic Islands. The club grew little by little and in 1931 changed its name to Club Deportivo Mallorca, due to the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, which caused the suppression of all all allusions to royalty. After the end of the Civil War in 1936, the Second Division was formed, with 5 groups of 8 teams, in which Mallorca was included.\n\nOn September 22, 1945, while in the Second Division, Es Fortí, the Balearic club's new stadium, with a capacity for 16,000 spectators, was inaugurated. Several months later, the stadium was renamed Lluis Sitjar, the person who three years earlier had promoted the construction of the new field. In the 1949-1950 academic year, the club regained the title of Real, changing its name to Real Club Deportivo Mallorca for the first time in its history.\n\nThe 1960s: Longed-for promotion to the First Division\n\nIn 1960, RCD Mallorca reached the Division of Honor for the first time in its history. Under the guidance of Juan Carlos Lorenzo, the team achieved promotion to the First Division on April 17, 1960, beating Levante UD (1-2) with goals by Julià Mir and José Rodríguez. The first season in the First Division ended with the team in ninth position, with Joan Forteza going down in history for scoring RCD Mallorca's first goal in the top flight. The first trip to the First Division lasted three seasons, falling back to the Second Division in the 1962-1963 season.\n\nThis decade was completed with two more promotions to the First Division, but relegation the following season. The first came in the 1964-1965 season, after beating Valencia Mestalla (1-0), with César Rodríguez as coach. The second was achieved at the end of the decade, in the 1968-1969 season, with the tandem formed by Juan Carlos Forneris and Sergio Rodríguez on the bench. Both of them were short-lived in the First Division.\n\nThe 70s: A fateful decade on the island\n\nAfter relegation to the Second Division in the 1969-1970 season, the 1970s proved to be a turbulent period in the club's history. They quickly tried to put together a team to return to the top flight, but the club's financial debts were attenuating the club. So much was the pitcher to the source, that in the 1974-1975 season, the Vermilion team was relegated to the Third Division. The financial situation was so bad that the club was on the verge of disappearing and in November 1977 the players staged the first lockout in the history of soccer due to non-payments. In the 1979-1980 academic year, Mallorca was proclaimed champion of its Third Division group and was promoted to Second Division B, a newly created category.\n\nThe 80's: Promotion and relegation\n\nRCD Mallorca began the decade of the 80's, playing in Second Division B, leaving behind some years of critical situation. The decade could not have started better, with promotion to the Second Division in the 1980-1981 season with Antonio Oviedo on the bench, without losing a single match at the Lluis Sitjar stadium. In its second year in the silver category after promotion, Mallorca achieved its fourth promotion to the First Division on May 22, 1983 with Lucien Muller as coach. The return to the First Division was again a failure, and they were relegated the following season.\n\nThe 1985-1986 season also went down in history for several reasons. The first and most important was the fifth promotion to the First Division, under Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, achieving an agonizing promotion on May 18, 1986 in Las Gaunas, with a goal by Luis García in the 85th minute of the match (1-2), in front of thousands of fans who had travelled from the island. For the first time in years, Mallorca managed to stay in the category the following season, having a spectacular season, becoming one of the revelations, finishing sixth, one step away from playing in the UEFA Cup.\n\nNothing foreshadowed the outcome of the following season, in which the team was relegated after losing in the promotion against Real Oviedo. The passage through the Second Division was ephemeral, as the promotion was achieved, the sixth, in the 1988-1989 season, again with Serra Ferrer and after beating Espanyol in an agonizing promotion with a packed Lluis Sitjar. Goals by Miguel Ángel Nadal and Gabi Vidal, certified the promotion (2-0).\n\n1990s: First title in history\n\nUnder Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the \"bermellones\" remained in the First Division after the promotion and in the 1990-1991 season, they disputed for the first time in their history a final, that of the Copa del Rey (King's Cup). After eliminating Gimnástica de Torrelavega, Sabadell, Oviedo, Elche, Valencia and Sporting de Gijón, Mallorca lost in the final against Atlético de Madrid, with a goal by Alfredo Santaelena in extra time. After this historic season, in 1991-1992, the Balearic team was relegated to the Second Division after a disastrous campaign.\n\nThen began the darkest five years of this decade with five consecutive seasons in the Second Division, always forming good teams but staying far from the objective or at the gates. He even played two promotions, without luck, first in 1993 against Albacete and later in 1996 against Rayo Vallecano. Precisely against Rayo Vallecano, one season later, in 1996-1997, the islanders achieved their seventh promotion to the First Division, with Bartomeu Llompart on the bench.\n\nAfter the promotion, Héctor Cúper arrived on the bench and in his first season, he led the islanders to their second Copa del Rey final, after eliminating Sóller, Las Palmas, Celta de Vigo, Athletic Club de Bilbao and Alavés. In the final, the all-powerful FC Barcelona awaited, who won the final in a penalty shootout after the match and extra time ended 1-1. In addition, a creditable fifth place was achieved in the league championship.\n\nOn August 22, 1998, RCD Mallorca won the first title in its history, beating FC Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup, winning in Palma (2-1) and at Camp Nou (0-1). The runner-up in the Spanish Cup the previous season gave them access to the European Cup Winners' Cup, a tournament in which they reached another final. Heart of Midlothian, Genk, Varazdin and Chelsea were eliminated before facing Lazio in the decisive match for the title. The Italians won 2-1 and left the Vermellons without the long-awaited dream. The campaign was rounded off with the club's first-ever qualification for the Champions League, thanks to a third-place finish in the league championship, although they failed to advance from the qualifying round. It was the last season at the Lluis Sitjar stadium, which became Son Moix, the new home of RCD Mallorca.\n\nDecade 2000-2010: Always in the First Division and another title.\n\nWith the entry into the new millennium, the team achieved the record score (71) in its history, with Luis Aragonés, achieving a new qualification for the Champions League. It was a historic season, with a record number of goals (61) and victories (20). Before the start of the following season, Luis Aragonés left for Atlético de Madrid and his place was taken by Bernd Krauss, with whom he managed to get through the qualifying round against Hadjuk Split and on September 11, 2001, Mallorca made history and played its first Champions League match against Arsenal, winning 1-0 with a goal by Vicente Engonga.\n\nA year later, another historic milestone was reached. After two lost finals, the third time was the charm and the Balearic team won the Copa del Rey, with Gregorio Manzano on the bench. Gramanet, Hercules, Valladolid, Real Madrid and Deportivo de La Coruña, fell along the way, and in the final, Recreativo de Huelva (0-3). Pandiani and Eto'o, twice, brought the title to Palma. Two seasons after the title, a real miracle took place, achieving salvation under the guidance of Héctor Cúper, when with seven rounds to go they were eleven points away from salvation.\n\nSeveral years flirting with relegation, but always avoiding it, until the 2007-2008 season, when Dani Güiza was proclaimed top scorer with 27 goals and the team achieved a creditable seventh place. Two seasons later, they were fighting until the last matchday to enter the Champions League, but had to settle for fifth place, which gave them a place in the Europa League, a competition they never played due to financial problems.\n\nDecade 2010-2020: a roller coaster ride\n\nAfter 16 consecutive years in the First Division, Mallorca returned to the Second Division in the 2012-2013 season. José Luis Oltra was in charge of leading the project to recover the First Division, but the team never managed to fight for promotion. After several years of failure, came the most resounding one, with relegation to Segunda División B in the 2016-2017 season, with the worst season in the recent history of the Bermellón squad.\n\nVicente Moreno took the helm of the islanders' ship, to get the club out of the Segunda División pit and managed to make history. First, by being promoted to the Second Division in Anduva, after a great season, and then, in his second year, achieving promotion to the First Division in the promotion playoff. The \"bermellones\" had a brilliant campaign, finishing in fifth place and then in the promotion playoffs, beating Albacete and Deportivo de la Coruña, in the final, with a historic comeback. After losing at Riazor (2-0), Vicente Moreno's team won 3-0 at Son Moix, with goals from Budimir, Salva Sevilla and Abdón Prats, achieving the second consecutive promotion.\n\nUnfortunately, the new journey in the First Division lasted only one year, as the club returned to the Second Division, after losing at home to Granada (1-2). Luis García is the new coach for the 2020-2021 season, after the departure of Vicente Moreno to Espanyol."
