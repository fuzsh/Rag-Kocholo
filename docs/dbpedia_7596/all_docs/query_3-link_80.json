        "text": "Real Madrid vs Barcelona is the biggest derby in Spain as well as arguably the biggest rivalry on the planet and we can reveal their head-to-head record, as well as some great stats around the El Clasico.\n\nThe La Liga is a great division; however, without these two European giants, it would definitely not be as entertaining as it is now.\n\nOneFootball Videos\n\nWith such a fierce rivalry, there is no doubt a hatred between the two sides that stems from the players on the pitch for both sides as well as both fan bases.\n\nDue to this, we have seen massively entertaining spectacles when the two have met on the pitch, which has included last-minute goals, some amazing screamers and of course some red cards as well.\n\nBarcelona vs Real Madrid History\n\nThe crazy thing about this El Clasico rivalry is the fact that the two have been battling each other for over 100 years. The two have always been very strong sides in Spain ever since the start of the 1900s, and this has made every match more and more exciting as they continue to create history every time they play each other.\n\nWhy are Real Madrid and Barcelona rivals?\n\nThere is quite an interesting backstory around the history of the two sides being rivals, and it isn’t all about what has happened on the pitch.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons behind Real Madrid and Barcelona’s bitter rivalry. One of them is due to Madrid and Barcelona being the two largest cities in Spain. This, combined with the fact that they have completely opposite political views (Barcelona represent Catalan nationalism whilst Real Madrid represents Spanish nationalism), has seen the two form this hatred over each other.\n\nLuis Figo and the pigs head at the Nou Camp\n\nThere have also been some events on the pitch and between the two clubs that have added fuel to the fire. One that did this and also shows the bitter rivalry is the incident of Luis Figo when he visited the Nou Camp for a match with his team Real Madrid.\n\nIt all stemmed from Barcelona fan favourite Figo leaving Barca in 2000 to join Madrid. He then returned to the Nou Camp in 2002 for the first time since he joined Los Blancos. The Portuguese international went to take a corner and was bombarded with lots of items chucked at him from the crowd. One of these items was a real pig’s head. He was also booed the whole time, and incidents like this caused even more heat between the two clubs.\n\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona stats\n\nOver the last century, the two sides have managed to play each other 285 times in all competitions, according to fcbarcelonalatestnews.com. These competitions include La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League.\n\nWho has more wins? Real Madrid or Barcelona\n\nCatalan side FC Barcelona currently hold the bragging rights as they have won the most El Clasico matches. Real Madrid have won 105, Barcelona have won 118, and there have been 62 draws (fcbarcelonalatestnews.com). The first recorded match was back in the 1901/02 season. (Transfermarkt).\n\nWho is the king of El Clasico?\n\nThis is a question many ask as there have been many players who have dominated multiple matches between Real Madrid and Barcelona, and to decide who we believe is the king of El Clasico, we have looked at who has scored the most goals.\n\nThe current top goalscorer of this derby is former Barcelona legend and now Paris Saint-Germain star Lionel Messi. The Argentina international has scored 26 goals in all competitions against Real Madrid. Second on the list is tied between Alfredo Di Stefano and Cristiano Ronaldo; the two have 18 goals. (Footballtransfers.com).\n\nBoth the Real Madrid and FC Barcelona websites show the amount of trophies either side has one. This has revealed that Barcelona have won the most tophies out of the two Spanish sides. Madrid have currently won 122 trophies, whilst Barcelona have won 128 trophies throughout their history.\n\nWhat trophies has Barcelona won?\n\nThese are all the main trophies that Barcelona have won.\n\nChampions League: (1991-92, 2005-06, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2014-15)\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: (2009-10, 2011-12, 2015-16)\n\nEuropean Cup Winners’ Cup: (1978-79, 1981-82, 1988-89, 1996-97)\n\nEuropean Super Cup: (1992-93, 1997-98, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2015-16)\n\nLatin Cup: (1948-49, 1951-52)\n\nLa Liga: (1928-29, 1944-45, 1947-48, 1948-49, 1951-52, 1952-53, 1958-59, 1959-60, 1973-74, 1984-85, 1990-91, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1997-98, 1998-99, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2012-13, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2017-18, 2018-19)\n\nCopa del Rey: (1909-10, 1911-12, 1912-13, 1919-20, 1921-22, 1924-25, 1925-26, 1927-28, 1941-42, 1950-51, 1951-52, 1952-53, 1956-57, 1958-59, 1962-63, 1967-68, 1970-71, 1977-78, 1980-81, 1982-83, 1987-88, 1989-90, 1996-97, 1997-98, 2008-09, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2020-21)\n\nSpanish Super Cup: (1983-84, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1994-95, 1996-97, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2013-14, 2016-17, 2018-19, 2022-23)\n\nSpanish League Cup: (1982-83, 1985-86)\n\nCatalan League Championship: (1901-1902, 1902-03, 1904-05, 1908-09, 1909-10, 1910-11, 1912-13, 1915-16, 1918-19, 1919-20, 1920-21, 1921-22, 1923-24, 1924-25, 1925-26, 1926-27, 1927-28, 1929-30, 1930-31, 1931-32, 1934-35, 1935-36, 1937-38)\n\nCatalan Super Cup: (2014-15, 2017-18)\n\nCatalan Cup: (1990-91, 1992-93, 1999-00, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2006-07, 2012-13, 2013-14)\n\n(FC Barcelona)\n\nWhat trophies has Real Madrid won?\n\nThese are all the main trophies that Real Madrid have won.\n\nChampions League: (1955-56, 1956-57, 1957-58, 1958-59, 1959-60, 1965-66, 1997-98,1999-00, 2001-02, 2013-14, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2021-22)\n\nFIFA Club World Cups: (1959-60, 1997-98, 2001-02, 2013-14, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18)\n\nEuropean Super Cups: (2001-02, 2013-14, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2021-22)\n\nUEFA Cups: (1984-85, 1985-86)\n\nLa Liga: (1931-32, 1932-33, 1953-54, 1954-55, 1956-57, 1957-58, 1960-61,1961-62, 1962-63, 1963-64, 1964-65, 1966-67, 1967-68, 1968-69, 1971-72, 1974-75, 1975-76, 1977-78, 1978-79, 1979-80, 1985-86,1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90, 1994-95, 1996-97, 2000-01, 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2011-12, 2016-17, 2019-20, 2021-22)\n\nSpanish Cups: (1904-05, 1905-06, 1906-07, 1907-08, 1916-17, 1933-34, 1935-36, 1945-46, 1946-47, 1961-62, 1969-70, 1973-74, 1974-75, 1979-80, 1981-82, 1988-89, 1992-93, 2010-11, 2013-14)\n\nSpanish Super Cups: (1988-89, 1989-90, 1993-94, 1997-98, 2001 -02, 2003-04, 2008-09, 2012-13 2017-18, 2019-20, 2021-22)\n\nLeague Cup: (1984-85)\n\n(Real Madrid)\n\nWhat is the biggest win in El Classico?\n\nReal Madrid managed to pick up the biggest-ever win in El Clasico, and it was a thrashing of Barcelona that they achieved back in the 1942/43 season.
