        "text": "Full match player ratings below:\n\nAndriy Lunin—9: The Ukranian should be the outright #1 in Thibaut Courtois’ absence. Played a phenomal match — made mutleiple crucial saves, inclduing an early kick save on Ferran Torres. Distribution both with his feet and his hands were quick and efficient.\n\nDani Carvajal—8: Shut down Barcelona’s left flank and was rarely tested.\n\nToni Rudiger—7: Ruffled Lewandowski and remained composed under the Barcelona occasional press.\n\nNacho—7: Solid showing for the captain who had the opportunity to raise his first bit of silverware with the armband.\n\nMendy—7: Nothing got past Mendy all night — neither Ferran or Lamal had much luck against the Frenchman.\n\nTchouameni—7.5: Man-marked Sergi Roberto and nullified his impact. Worked well in the middle with Kroos and allowed Valverde to hedge higher when Madrid were defending.\n\nFede Valverde—7.5: Never stopped running or working both on and off the ball. Caught Balde sleeping in possession on more than one occasion. Played a lofted cross to Vinicius that helped create the fourth goal for Rodrygo.\n\nToni Kroos—7: Another day at the office for the German who stayed in control throughout the match and put his teammates in good spots with the ball.\n\nJude Bellingham—9: Did not manage to score but did everything else. A fanatasic player, a joy to watch. Provided the opening assist depsite being pressed by two Barcelona players. His technique and silky skills were on display throughout the match. Put in equally as impressive effort defensively as he did offensively.\n\nVinicius Junior—10: Statement match from Vinicius Junior. This can be the kick-starter to his season and to a strong 2024. Scored two goals within the opening 10 minutes and got the hat-trick via a well-taken penalty. Completely dominated Araujo and Kounde and got the Uruguayan sent-off.\n\nRodrygo—8.5: One goal and one assist — the Brazilian continues his fine run of form. The trio of Rodrygo-Bellingham-Vinicius came alive tonight and found a lot of success against Barcelona’s weak press and high defensive line.\n\nSubstitutions:\n\nBrahim—8: What a player to have off the bench, immediate spark once again and nearly scoring Madrid’s fifth.\n\nLuka Modric—6: 14 touches and 11/12 passes during his 10 minutes on the field.\n\nEduardo Camavinga—7: Some silky touches and fouls drawn, mostly from Fermin, to rile up the Barcelona team.\n\nJoselu—N/A: Played the final four minutes of the match for Jude Bellingham."
