        "text": "Early life and career as a player\n\nGuardiola was born and reared in the small town Santpedor, just north of Manresa, in northeastern Spain. His father was a bricklayer, and his mother was a homemaker. He had two elder sisters and a younger brother. From an early age Guardiola was obsessed with football, and at age 13 he was transferred from a local team (Club Gimnàstic Manresa Youth) to FC Barcelona’s under-age-16 squad. After progressing through Barcelona’s youth system, he joined the main squad in 1990, going on to make 479 appearances for the team. By the end of his playing career he had tallied 16 goals for “Barça.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAmerican Sports Nicknames\n\nGuardiola was part of a Barça side that became known as the “Dream Team” under the guidance of legendary Dutch player-turned-manager Johan Cruyff. After having been a linchpin as a player of the “total football” style of play with which the Dutch club Ajax and the Netherlands national team revolutionized the game in the 1970s, Cruyff employed that style at Barcelona. (Total football emphasized one-touch passing, ball possession, fluidity of positions, and pressing defense.) Guardiola played under Cruyff from 1991 to 1996.\n\nDuring the period from 1991 to 1994, Barcelona won the championship of La Liga, the top Spanish football league, four consecutive times. Guardiola also contributed to Barcelona’s capture of four Spanish Super Cups (a tournament among the winners and runners-up of La Liga and the Copa del Rey, Spain’s leading national football tournament), one European Cup (now known as the Union of European Football Associations [UEFA] Champions League, a tournament among European national league champions and some runners-up), and one European Super Cup (now known as the UEFA Super Cup, a competition that matches the winner of the Champions League and the winner of the Europa League). Guardiola’s teammates during this time included renowned footballers Ronald Koeman, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.\n\nCruyff was fired before the 1996–97 season, but Barcelona and Guardiola went on to win two more La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, a Spanish Super Cup, a UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, and a European Super Cup. Guardiola was also named the captain of Barcelona, a position that he held until he left the club in 2001. After leaving Barcelona, he played for several other clubs, including Brescia Calcio (Italy), AS Roma (Italy), Al Ahli SC (Qatar), and Dorados de Sinaloa (Mexico) before retiring as a player on July 1, 2006. Throughout his career, Guardiola also made more than 40 appearances for the Spanish national team.\n\nCareer as a manager\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007–08 season, Guardiola made his managerial debut for Barcelona B (now known as Barcelona Atlètic), an under-age-20 squad that develops players for FC Barcelona. The previous season, Barcelona B had been relegated from the third division of Spanish football to the fourth division. Characteristically, Guardiola instituted strict discipline and professionalism among the players, introducing fines for those who did not follow his rules. He also merged the team with the Barcelona C squad and allowed a number of more experienced players to join the team. At the end of a successful season, Barcelona B had won the league and was promoted back to the third division.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

During his four years managing Barcelona, Guardiola built upon the possession-based style of play that Cruyff had pioneered. Guardiola’s version of the strategy was branded “tiki-taka,” a label that he never embraced. During his first season in charge, Barcelona won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League, becoming the first Spanish club to accomplish the so-called “treble” (winning three major trophies in a single season). Over the course of his next three seasons, Barcelona claimed two more La Liga titles, another Copa del Rey, three Spanish Super Cups, two Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Club World Cups, two UEFA Super Cups, and one more Champions League trophy. Among the notable players whom Guardiola managed at Barcelona were Lionel Messi, Xavi, and Andrés Iniesta.\n\nA year after his final season at Barcelona, Guardiola took the helm of German powerhouse Bayern Munich for the 2013–14 season, winning the Bundesliga (German first division) title in all three of his seasons with the club. Under Guardiola’s tutelage Bayern Munich also won the German Cup twice, the UEFA Super Cup once, and the FIFA Club World Cup once. However, it failed to win the UEFA Champions League, reaching the semifinal in each of Guardiola’s three seasons before being knocked out. The list of star players managed by Guardiola at Bayern Munich includes Robert Lewandowski, Arjen Robben, and Philipp Lahm.\n\nAfter leaving Bayern Munich, Guardiola became manager of the English Premier League team Manchester City FC for the 2016–17 season. Following a disappointing first season and an overhaul of the squad, the 2017–18 season was much more fruitful. In addition to winning the English League Cup, Manchester City won the Premier League. Guardiola’s side finished with 100 points, setting a Premier League record for most points in a season (standings in the Premier League are determined on the basis of three points for a win, one point for a draw, and none for a defeat). In the following seasons, Guardiola led Manchester City to multiple Premier League titles, League Cups, FA (Football Association) Cups, and FA Community Shields. Manchester City won its first Champions League title in 2022–23, and it won its fourth consecutive Premier League championship in 2023–24, the first time a club had done so. Notable players that Guardiola has managed at Manchester City include Sergio Agüero, Kevin De Bruyne, and Vincent Kompany."
