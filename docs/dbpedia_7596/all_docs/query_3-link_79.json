        "text": "James, I think once again you have your timelines mixed up. Albertini didn't play for Milan side in 89 which is used for this comparison. He played for Milan under Capello. The legendary back 4 of Milan (Tassotti, Costacurta, Baresi and Maldini) were not \"dirty\" per se, but they definitely had their dirty tricks from time to time. They would see a lot more yellows/reds and fouls called against them now, then back in their actual time period.\n\nIn general, this comparison is a bit wrong and confusing. While Baresi is better than Pique and Costacurta is better than Mascherano (not a natural defender), I think that Pique is better than Costacurta and more appropriate comparison due to role in defense. And where is Puyol? Why is he not used instead of Mascherano? At Barca, Puyol/Mascherano is more of the covering defender (Libero functions - Baresi), while Pique is the stopper role (which was Costacurta's role). However, I agree with Maldini > Abidal and Alves > Tassotti.\n\nI would compare Pedro with Donadoni instead and it's a toss up - the Italian was more creative and skillful, while the Spaniard is more of a goal threat. Then it gets more confusing....who do you compare Messi with, Gullit or Van Basten? Either way, Messi wins the comparison IMO, while Villa looses to either remaining player.\n\nBut here is the problem, at least one of them. Milan used a 4-4-2 formation, while Barca uses a 4-3-3 formation. The roles and functions of the midfielders and forwards were different between the two teams and therefore required different type of players. Also, there is a difference in the way both teams played. The common thing is the high pressure defending. I don't agree with the opinion that this Milan side would have more possession against Barca than their modern day opponents.\n\nAlbertini started playing for Milan since 88 to 98. But you're right he only became a good DM in early 90 onward! At 89 he was just a sub\n\nThis is a fantasy thing as it'd never exist - just for fun and discussion purpose. It's neither wrong nor right ... by any means.\n\nnow for fun discussion\"\n\n- Compare player vs player is purely to show of the quality of each team (sometimes it does not mean much, like galacticos Real with big names but way off in conceding goals in center.\n\n- Milan were a great team for they built up with same core (like Barca now) from DF to attack\n\nSo as a WHOLE team (names + team cohesion)\n\n1- In defense (DM+DF): Milan > Barca no doubt\n\n2- Midfield: Barca > Milan\n\n3- Attack: Milan = Barca\n\nCoach: Sacchi > Pep (in tactics and strategy)\n\nIt's a 5050 call\n\nI thouh you're a fan of Basten and Gullit? If so you should have known:\n\n1- SerieA in 80-early 90 were pure defensive (some said ugly playing style or \"anti football\". On top of the fact Sacchi was KING of catennacio as their coach - so what you listed out is just aftermath results for their 'negative ' playing style.\n\n2- In attack, (note that I said as a WHOLE TEAM in COHESION) not solely by names or individual. So Basten + Gullit + Donadoni + Ancelotti = Messi + Villa/Pedro + Iniesta/Cecs\n\nThe latter names looked more inpressive in goals for their whole team well in sync perfectly and enjoy most possession time (easier to create chances). But Basten + Gullit were very efficient in finding goals despite of much less chances.\n\nLook Basten + Gullit + Donadoni + Rijkaard > 60% team goals\n\nwhile Messi + Villa + Pedro covered 75% of team goals (thanks to the possession) might look better but in reality, it may not mean much as the case of historical game Brazil82 lost to Itlay 82?\n\nW\n\nWe could do the same thing cherry picking poor results for Barca in Europe. They just lost to Celtic, lost to a very poor Chelsea team in both legs etc.\n\nLate 80s Milan has all the attributes of teams that have consistantly gave Barca trouble, size/physicallity and a well orginized defence, as seen with Chelsea and Inter. But Milan has all of these attributes even more so than 09/10 Inter or 08/09 Chelsea. It would be a very interesting matchup.\n\nNone of these two options. Just that it was a different time. I think the legendary status of Milan is deserved (by the playing style and at that time it was truly very dominant - few others in the 'old' European Cup achieved a better record) but I put it in a context. I'm not sure whether it were categorically tougher opponents but, for what it is worth, I do think that Bulgaria, Belgium, Yugoslavia etc. were comparatively in a better state as nowadays.\n\nThat said, I don't see how Barcelona attack is historically better. The Milan attackers Gullit and Van Basten were at worst seen as two of the best five attackers of the world at that time, according to some they were even #1 and #2 attackers of the world. Don't see how Pedro and Villa compare with that. Milan also had Donadoni who could legitimately claim to be the best winger of the world at that time (he was anyway in contention).\n\nPedro and Villa are in status better comparable with Evani and Colombo TBH.\n\nIf you use a time machine Barcelona easily wins but that is another thing.\n\nWell it's a close call yes and no ...\n\nYes, as I had said Messi + Pedro + Villa looked \"better\" in attack for their stats (just by number)\n\nNo, if we take into consideration of few things below, then they might not be \"that better\" to the pair VanBasten + Gullit\n\n- The time (and era) is different and for that their team playing style is also different. Milan 89 were not an \"OUT and OUT attacking team\" like Barca now. They play even slower in rythm in midfield but very quick in counter - quicker and more efficient than Barca (for they got much less chances than the Barca trio)\n\n- As mentioned above, if we have to convert the goals (from this liga) back to SerieA then Barca number might not be that big any more. On top of the fact that Messi+ Pedro+ Villa (2011 specifically) got big help from Dan Alves, Xavi and Iniesta (which I had already given a plus) . So another plus for the attackers would be like DOUBLE UP in redundancy?\n\nAnyway this is just purely speculation of the matter of discussion - no more no less!\n\nThis is where it starts, the difference between the old European Cup and the modern day Champions League. The champions of Bulgaria, Belgium and Yugoslavia might've been better then than they are now (no doubt about it), but the question is were these team better than the teams Barca had to playing against during the 2010/11 season?\n\nThe European cup was modified into becoming the Champions League precisely to include more of the better teams from the better leagues, thus becoming a better/stronger competition. And while not all teams are necessarily the champions of their countries (as they we all in the past), they are still better teams than some champions from some other leagues/countries.\n\nI agree that at the time Van Basten and Gullit were considered amongst the best attackers, especially since that was right after the Euro88 Holland victory. But at the same time Messi is considered the best player for a number of years and Villa was considered (in 2011) one of the best goalscorers coming of his 5 goals at WC2010. Add to that the fact that Barca's attack includes a third attacker in Pedro. I'm not saying we should necessarily compare the attackers individually, but more as unit. Barca's attacking strata includes 3 attackers, while Milan's attacking strata includes only two attackers - that should be taken into consideration.\n\nInterestingly in both EC/CL finals in 1989 and 2011 respectively, Milan's attackers scored all the goals (Van Basten 2 and Gullit 2) and Barca's attackers scored all the goals (Pedro, Messi and Villa scoring each).\n\nBut James this is exactly the interesting part in comparing the two legendary teams, precisely because their styles were different and the times were different. If you think that certain aspects of Barca gave their players advantages and made them look better, then they were better in attack. Similarly certain aspects gave Milan's defense advantages and makes them look better than Barca's defense. So if we say Milan was better in defense, then Barca was better in midfield and in attack.\n\nAnd if we even think deeper and analyze more carefully, it wouldn't be far fetched to say that Barca 2011 is a sum and evolution of Ajax from the 70s, Milan from late 80s/early 90s under Sacchi and Barca's \"dream team\" from early 90s under Cruyff.\n\nI disagree that Milan were quicker and more efficient on the counter than Barca is. How often have you seen Barca on the counter? Pedro, Villa, Messi, Iniesta and Alves are quicker players than what Milan had - they play quicker and they run quicker."
