Real took an early lead after a Vinicius Jr cross deflected off defender Ronald Araujo and went inside his own goal. But Barcelona hit back on half time with a tidy finish by Sergi Roberto from close range.\n\nBarcelona kept pushing for the winner after the break and finally got it in added time when Alejandro Balde raced down the left channel and crossed to Franck Kessie who unleashed an unstoppable first touch strike to give Barca the win.\n\nEl Clasico highlights\n\nGOAL!

No penalty.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 21:09 , Marc Mayo\n\n47 mins: No surprise to see Real getting off to a bright start having no doubt been given a dressing down by Ancelotti at the break.\n\nVinicius Jr gets down the left and beats Araujo for pace... but not enough to keep the ball in play and his cross is shot wide by Valverde anyway.\n\nKick-off!

A central shot, easy enough for Courtois, but on target nonetheless.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:37 , Marc Mayo\n\n33 mins: A yellow card for Raphinha after sticking a late one on Kroos.\n\nA few crunchy tackles flying in during this first half, the derby tension gently simmering away.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:35 , Marc Mayo\n\n31 mins: Araujo bombs forward to win a corner and its played short before a wicked ball into the near post... Christensen heads it low and straight at Courtois!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:32 , Marc Mayo\n\n29 mins: For all their patient possession, it is high crosses into the box creating the biggest threat for Barcelona.\n\nHaving said that, the ball statistics are almost exactly even so far.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:31 , Marc Mayo\n\n27 mins: A delightful piece of skill from Vinicius Jr beats Kounde and Araujo all ends up... and Ter Stegen gets off his line well to gather and end his run.\n\nBarcelona chance!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:27 , Marc Mayo\n\n24 mins: Christensen pops up at the near post and, unmarked, doesn’t make enough contact as his header flies wide!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:26 , Marc Mayo\n\n22 mins: Sleek counter-attack from Los Blancos as Valverde is released with a sweet ball in behind.\n\nHe cuts it back to Benzema but his first touch isn’t great from the overhit pass, leading to a lay-off for Carvajal that the right-back stumbles over. Goal kick.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:25 , Marc Mayo\n\n21 mins: Nacho sends Raphinha for a churro with a delightful flick on the touchline, but Barcelona get back to deal with the threat.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:23 , Marc Mayo\n\n19 mins: Araujo makes a dart into the box and looks to get onto the end of Raphinha’s dink to the back stick.\n\nMilitao shepherds the defender away from the ball and it drifts into touch.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:21 , Marc Mayo\n\n17 mins: And now a yellow card for Nacho after sending Araujo to the ground with a late stud to the heel.\n\nThere was not much in that compared to Sergi Roberto’s tackle moments ago! Real are protesting exactly that...\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:19 , Marc Mayo\n\n15 mins: Sergi Roberto lucky to dodge a booking for a very late slide tackle on Nacho.\n\nAncelotti breaks from his usually calm demanour to demand a card.\n\nBarcelona chance!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:16 , Marc Mayo\n\n12 mins: Lewandowski spins in the box and prepares to shoot - just as Carvajal lands a vital tackle in to allow Real to scramble clear!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:15 , Marc Mayo\n\n11 mins: Madrid now have the possession with that goal really coming against the run of play.\n\nBig test of Barcelona’s mettle now.\n\nGGGOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! Barcelona 0-1 Real Madrid\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:12 , Marc Mayo\n\n9 mins: VINICIUS JR’S CROSS DEFLECTS IN!\n\nWriggling down the left, the Brazilian’s cross is deflected in by Araujo’s head! He knew very little about that...\n\nVinicius celebrates right at the home fans - they’re stunned!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:10 , Marc Mayo\n\n7 mins: Rudiger rockets a shot from absolutely miles out but Ter Stegen watches it all the way, catching on his line.\n\nThat would quite possibly have been the most audacious Clasico goal ever!\n\nBarcelona chance!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:09 , Marc Mayo\n\n5 mins: Madrid right under the cosh now as Raphinha latches onto a far-post cross and forces Courtois into a fine diving save!\n\nAnother effort from distance flies over as the locals ratchet the volume levels right up.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:06 , Marc Mayo\n\n3 mins: Barcelona settle into a possession rhythm since that early moment in their own half.\n\nLewandowski spins 25 yards from goal and forces a fine save by Courtois!\n\nOne he’ll expect to make but a good effort from the Pole.\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:04 , Marc Mayo\n\n1 min: Early intent from Benzema, who fires a shot on target that Ter Stegen falls on smartly.\n\nEl Clasico kick-off!\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:03 , Marc Mayo\n\nRicardo de Burgos Bengoetxea blows his whistle and away we go!\n\nIt’s Barcelona vs Real Madrid in LaLiga...\n\nBarcelona royalty in the stands\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 20:01 , Marc Mayo\n\nPep Guardiola is in the ground to watch tonight’s game as he begins a week off for Manchester City.\n\nHe greets Johan Cruyff’s widow, Danny Coster, to big cheers around the Camp Nou as the images appear on the screen.\n\nEl Clasico countdown to kick-off\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:59 , Marc Mayo\n\nHere come the players!\n\nCamp Nou, naturally, is packed to the rafters for this clash with only a tiny visiting allocation tucked away in the top corner.\n\nMadrid eyes on these two\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:56 , Marc Mayo\n\nVinicius Jr has enjoyed a fine season and has arguably already taken up Karim Benzema’s mantle as Real’s leading light.\n\nCan he fire Madrid back into the LaLiga title picture?\n\nKick-off coming up!\n\nNo Florentino Perez at the Camp Nou\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:54 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe Real Madrid club president has rejected the customary luncheon with his Barcelona counterpart, Joan Laporta, today and will not be at the Camp Nou for the game.\n\nHis decision is part of Real’s anger over their rivals’ Negreira Case allegations over the club’s alleged corruption of refereeing officials.\n\nEl Clasico countdown to kick-off\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:51 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe warm-ups are done and atmosphere bubbling away in Catalonia.\n\nKick-off in ten minutes!\n\nEl Clasico throwback: Gavi leads Barcelona to a Supercopa win\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:47 , Marc Mayo\n\nThese two sides are sick at the side of each other.\n\nThey’ve already met in LaLiga this year plus the Supercopa de Espana final - and they’re in the middle of a Copa del Rey semi-final.\n\nBarcelona are 2-1 for wins.\n\nSome optimistic Barcelona fans in the Camp Nou\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:40 , Marc Mayo\n\nXavi speaks out amid Negreira Case\n\nSunday 19 March 2023 19:36 , Marc Mayo\n\nBarcelona’s role in alleged historic corruption of referees will not impact their gameplan tonight, Xavi has asserted.\n\nHe said: “They won't destabilise us with all this that's happening.
