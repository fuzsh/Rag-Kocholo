        "text": "The rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona could be labelled as the most intense in European football, with fights, gestures and provocations on and off the pitch very frequent.\n\nHere, we take a look back through the history of El Clasico to outline the top 25 gestures that have been made in this fixture.\n\n1. Mourinho's finger\n\nIn one of the most intense periods for the rivalry, Jose Mourinho poked Barcelona's assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye with his finger during the second leg of the 2011 Supercopa de Espana.\n\n2. Schuster's bras d'honneur\n\nMarcos Alonso's last-minute goal in Barcelona's 2-1 victory in the 1983 Copa del Rey final was followed by Bernd Schuster's bras d'honneur gesture.\n\n3. Stoichkov and Sanchez\n\nIn the second leg of the 1990 Supercopa de Espana, Hristo Stoichkov stamped on Urizar Azpitarte and Hugo Sanchez had an argument with the Camp Nou crowd.\n\n4. Raul's shushing\n\nIn October 1999, Real Madrid drew 2-2 with Barcelona thanks to Raul's goal.\n\nThe Spanish striker put his finger on his lips to silence the home fans.\n\n5. Bruins Slot's first 'manita'\n\nThe first 'manita' came in 1994 with Barcelona beating Los Blancos 5-0.\n\nJohan Cruyff's assistant Toni Bruins Slot raised his hand to show his five fingers, each of them representing a goal.\n\n6. Pique's version of the 'manita'\n\nIn 2010 Barcelona triumphed 5-0 against Real Madrid in Jose Mourinho's first game against Pep Guardiola.\n\nAnother 'manita' followed, this time from Gerard Pique.\n\n7. Giovanni's 'up yours' gesture\n\nGiovanni netted Barcelona's third goal in a 3-2 win at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu in 1997 and did an 'up yours' gesture to the home fans.\n\n8. Tarradellas's peace\n\nCatalan politician Josep Tarradellas attempted to restore the peace between the two rivals in February 1980 when their relationship was tense.\n\nHe set up a meeting on the day of the Clasico and it ended with a historic handshake.\n\n9. Cristiano Ronaldo's 'calma'\n\nCristiano Ronaldo netted Real Madrid's second goal in their 2-1 victory over Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012.\n\nFollowing his goal, he did the famous 'calma' gesture asking the home fans to calm down.\n\n10. Pique's handcuffs\n\nIn 2013, Barcelona protested for a penalty that was not given and Pique did the handcuffs gesture to the referee Perez Lasa.\n\n11. Luis Enrique's celebration\n\nOn the same day when Giovanni did the 'up yours' gesture, Luis Enrique scored Barcelona's second.\n\nThe former Real Madrid player was whistled at by the fans and celebrated by stretching his jersey a few metres away from the fans.\n\n12. The ovation for Ronaldinho\n\nRonaldinho's exhibition in a 3-0 win away at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu led the Real Madrid fans to applaud the Brazilian, recognising his outstanding performance.\n\n13. Whistles for Figo\n\nLuis Figo's return to the Camp Nou as a Real Madrid player in 2000 marked one of the loudest boos in the history of this fixture.\n\nThe Portuguese covered both his ears in the centre of the pitch.\n\n14. A lap of honour at the Camp Nou\n\nIn 1990, Real Madrid decided to do a lap of honour at the Camp Nou after winning the Supercopa de Espana.\n\nAs a result, dozens of objects were launched on to the pitch.\n\n15. A guard of honour for Barcelona\n\nReal Madrid performed a guard of honour for Barcelona at their home ground after the Catalans won the 1990/91 league title.\n\n16. A guard of honour for Real Madrid\n\nBarcelona also did the guard of honour at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu after Real Madrid secured the 2007/08 league title.\n\n17. Rivaldo's whistles\n\nAfter being whistled at throughout the game, Rivaldo celebrated a goal at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu by whistling the home fans.\n\n18. Carvajal's middle finger\n\nSergio Ramos had just netted Real Madrid's equaliser at the Camp Nou in 2016, when Dani Carvajal decided to give Barcelona fans the middle finger.\n\n19. Suarez mocks Reguilon\n\nSergio Reguilon left crying from one match last season and Luis Suarez mocked the Spaniard with a gesture simulating wiping tears with his hand.\n\n20. Pepe's bras d'honneur\n\nPepe gave a bras d'honneur to Barcelona fans while celebrating Cristiano Ronaldo's decider in the Copa del Rey final in 2011 at Mestalla.\n\n21. Messi's shirt celebration\n\nIn 2017, Lionel Messi netted a late winner, took off his shirt and showed the back of the jersey to the home fans at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n22. Ronaldo consoles Messi\n\nRonaldo missed the 2014 Copa del Rey final due to an injury, but after the game he went on the pitch to greet and console Messi.\n\n23. Alexanco and Spasic\n\nPredrag Spasic's own goal gave Barcelona a 2-1 win at the Camp Nou against Real Madrid in January 1991.\n\nInstead of celebrating the goal, Alexanco consoled his opponent.\n\n24. Puyol's armband kiss\n\nIn Barcelona's famous 6-2 away win in 2009, Carles Puyol celebrated a goal by taking off his captain's armband and kissing it while looking at the direction of the travelling Barcelona supporters.\n\n25. Sergio Ramos' armband kiss\n\nSergio Ramos also kissed his captain's armband after scoring on home soil in the 2013 league derby."
