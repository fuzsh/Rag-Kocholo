        "text": "After an entertaining 2-2 draw in Sunday's first leg at the Bernabeu, Barcelona and Real Madrid head to Camp Nou for the finale, Wednesday at 5 ET on ESPN3.com and ESPN Deportes. Here's what you need to know about this annual showdown between last season's league and cup winners.\n\n• This is the 28th Spanish Super Cup, 17 of which have been won by Barcelona or Real Madrid. Barca has won a record nine times, and Madrid is one back with eight titles. With three trophies, Deportivo is the only other club with multiple titles.\n\n• After winning the past two Super Cups, Barcelona seeks to be the second team to win three straight. The only club to do so was Real Madrid from 1988 to 1990, a stretch that included a title won by default after Madrid won both the league and cup titles the previous season.\n\n• This is the fifth time that Barcelona and Real Madrid have met in the Super Cup, and Madrid has lifted the trophy in all four previous meetings, most recently in 1997.\n\n• Only twice before Sunday has the first leg been a tie. Both times, the home team won the second leg and the title. In 2000, Deportivo won 2-0 at home after a scoreless draw at Espanyol. The next year, Raul scored a hat trick as Real Madrid trounced Zaragoza 3-0 at home after a 1-1 game at La Romareda.\n\n• If Real Madrid is to pull the road upset, Jose Mourinho's side likely will need possession in line with the first leg, when Madrid had the ball 48 percent of the game. That's in sharp contrast to last season, when Madrid averaged 31 percent possession in the teams' five meetings."
