Currently the Catalans have 73 in their trophy cabinet, whereas the Madridistas have 74.\n\nThe clubs have contested the deciding leg of the Super Cup at the Bernabeu only three times in the past, with Barca winning there in 1968 but Real victorious in 1990 and 1997 – when Jose Mourinho was the Blaugrana's assistant Coach.\n\nBarcelona are unbeaten in their last seven visits to the Bernabeu however, a run stretching over four years."
