Barcelona eventually lifted the league title and defeated their rivals in the Supercopa de Espana final, but Madrid got their revenge by winning the two-legged Copa del Rey semifinal tie.\n\nThe two clubs have met each other in 256 competitive matches, with Real Madrid winning 105, Barcelona 100, and the teams sharing the spoils 52 times. Former Barca star Messi is the all-time highest goalscorer in El Clasico's history and the Argentina great is behind only Sergio Busquets in appearances (48) in this fixture.\n\nMORE: How the first Clasico of 2023/24 played out\n\nEl Clasico head-to-head record\n\nHere, we take a look at all the records of this classic encounter between the two Spanish giants.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti vs Xavi head to head\n\nXavi finds himself battling against Ancelotti in the dugout following his return to Barcelona in 2021, with Ancelotti making his own La Liga comeback in the same year.\n\nAs a player, Xavi faced Ancelotti teams three times in his early career as the fulcrum of Barcelona's midfield against AC Milan.

Madrid beat Barca in the Supercopa de Espana final last season, but Xavi turned the tables in the 2023 final.\n\nLast season, Barca and Madrid won one game apiece in league play, with the Catalans winning the Supercopa final and the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinal tie before Madrid romped to a 4-0 victory in the second.\n\nIn the first meeting of 2023/24, Madrid came from a goal down to win 2-1 in Catalonia thanks to two more strikes from Jude Bellingham. In the second, Vinicius Jr scored a first-half hat-trick as Madrid won 4-1 to win the Supercopa in Saudi Arabia.\n\nXavi then announced he would step down at the end of the campaign. Barca's form picked up and they headed into El Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu with an outside chance of the title.
