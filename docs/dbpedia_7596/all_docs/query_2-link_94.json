        "text": "The four-team Spanish Super Cup kicks off on Wednesday, with a potential El Clasico final on Sunday - in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHow does it work? Why have they changed it so much? BBC Sport has the answers to those questions, and more.\n\nThe Spanish Super Cup had the same format from 1982 until last year. The La Liga champions would meet the Copa del Rey winners over two legs at each club's ground before the start of the season.\n\nIn the early days double winners would automatically be given the Super Cup, but in recent years the cup runners-up would play the champions.\n\nLast year still saw the winners of league and cup meet before the start of the season, but over one leg in Tangier, Morocco. Barcelona won the double so they met beaten Copa del Rey finalists Sevilla - and won 2-1 thanks to goals from Gerard Pique and Ousmane Dembele.\n\nBut that format has been ripped up, for the next three years at least.\n\nThe tournament now takes place in January - in Saudi Arabia - and features four teams: the top two in the previous season's La Liga, and the winners and runners-up from the Copa del Rey. If those teams are the same, then the next highest La Liga team get in.\n\nThis year the teams in action at the 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Sports City stadium in Jeddah are Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Valencia.\n\nValencia will take on Real Madrid on Wednesday, 8 January, with Barcelona facing Atletico Madrid the next day - both games are at 19:00 GMT (22:00 local time). The finalists meet on Sunday at 18:00 GMT.\n\nÂ£Â£. Or to be more accurate â¬â¬. Or to be even more accurate, the Saudi riyal.\n\nThe Spanish FA has not confirmed any financial details but Spanish media are reporting it is worth 40m euros (Â£34m) a year.\n\nThis is the latest big sporting event to be held in Saudi Arabia, following the recent Anthony Joshua-Andy Ruiz Jr boxing match, the Italian Super Cup between Juventus and Lazio last month and a friendly between Brazil and Argentina.\n\nThe kingdom has sought to stage sporting and entertainment events in a bid to attract visitors and move away from its oil-dependent economy.\n\nThe Spanish Super Cup has been moved from the summer so it does not disrupt clubs' lucrative pre-season summer tours.\n\nPlenty of organisations and people are not happy with the decision to host the event in Saudi Arabia - a nation with many human rights issues.\n\nThe deal was only signed after Saudi Arabia agreed women would be able to attend the games.\n\nHuman rights organisation Amnesty International has highlighted the country's \"abysmal\" human rights record. Heavy restrictions on freedom of expression and women's rights have been raised, as has the use of the death penalty for offences not recognised as crimes under international law.\n\nSpain's acting junior minister for sport, Maria Jose Rienda, said in November the government would not support holding the competition \"in countries where women's rights are not respected\".\n\nLa Liga boss Javier Tebas is angry for another reason. Broadcaster beoutQ illegally shows matches - mainly in Saudi Arabia - despite the rights to show games in the region belonging to Qatari company beIN Sports.\n\n\"Anywhere except Arabia would be best, as there they are pirating the signal of the entire football industry and world sport,\" said Tebas previously.\n\nOne of the teams are not happy either, although not for human rights reasons. Valencia have criticised the fact they will only earn 2m euros, compared to six million for Barcelona and Real Madrid, and three million for Atletico.\n\nIt is hard to say for sure, because this tournament is new. But with all clubs bringing strong squads, it is likely the stars will be on show.\n\nHowever, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema are both missing for Real Madrid because of injury, and Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also sidelined.\n\nThe travelling is not ideal for any of the clubs, but they will not have any La Liga games to catch up on when they get back, as there is a break in the league until 17 January.\n\nCopa del Rey games are currently taking place, but the four Super Cup teams have a bye to the last 32."
