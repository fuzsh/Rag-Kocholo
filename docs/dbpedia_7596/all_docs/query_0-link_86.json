        "text": "Quietly and proudly, Barcelona sits between the mountains and the sea. It is a city where nature and man-made structures blend together in glorious harmony, leaving its visitors breathless and its citizens, the strong-willed and passionate Catalans, with a strong sense of national pride.\n\nAmong one of its main attractions and an iconic landmarks is the world-renowned football club that bears the same name as the city, and will in fact pop up higher than the city itself in search engine results pages.\n\nThe Swiss, English and Spanish footballers’ group leader, Joan Gamper, founded the Barcelona Football Club on the 22nd day of October, 1899. He did this after he had cited a public notice in a local newspaper, Los Desportes (The Game) reporting his desire to establish a football club.\n\nAfter one month, with some good feedback, on November 29, 1899, a meeting was held at the office of Gimnasio Sole. This meeting was attended by eleven players. The Football Club Barcelona was conceived after the meeting. The motto of FC Barcelona is “Mes que un club”; more than a club in Spanish. After the successful Catalan legacy was born, there have been multiple ups and downs and enough controversies to challenge the fame of the club.\n\nA major crisis was the dictatorship under both Primo de Rivera and Francisco Franco, but in spite of all these setbacks, the fans of Barcelona never left their club in disdain. Undeniably, Barcelona is the most successful club in Spain, despite their strong rivalry with Real Madrid. The club has won many trophies that will be discussed later. Believe it or not, Barcelona has one of the largest fan bases of all the other Spanish clubs.\n\nClub Presidents/Directors/Founders/Coaches\n\nJoan Gamper – Founder of FC Barcelona\n\nJosep Lluís Núñez – First President elected for FC Barcelona (1978)\n\nJoan Gaspart – President\n\nWalter Wild – First Director of the club\n\nCarles Comamala – Founder of the club’s crest and First Full-Time Coach\n\nJosep Samitier – Coach(1945)\n\nFernando Daučík – Coach (1952): won trophies including Copa Martini Rossi, La Liga, Copa Del Generalissimo, Copa Eva Duarte, and Copa Latina.\n\nHelenio Herrera – Coach (1959-1968): won trophies like La Liga, Fairs Cup, and Copa Del Rey.\n\nSalvador Artigas – Coach (1968)\n\nCésar Luis Menotti – Coach (1983)\n\nJohan Cruyff – Manager (1988): won 11 trophies including UEFA Cup final, Copa Del Rey, European Super Cup, and Supercopa de España.\n\nBobby Robson (1996-1997): won trophies counting Copa Del Rey, UEFA Cup, and Supercopa de España.\n\nLuis Van Gaal – Coach\n\nLlorenc Serra Ferrer – Coach (2000)\n\nCarles Rexach – Coach\n\nRadomir Antić- Coach\n\nPep Guardiola – Coach\n\nGerardo Martino – Manager (July 22,2013)\n\nSandro Rosell – President\n\nTito Vilanova – Coach\n\nJosep Maria Bartomeu – Acted as President\n\nBarcelona FC Overview – Major Events That Have Taken Place from the Club’s Inception to the Present Day\n\nYear after year, new developments occurred, which eventually led to this present Barcelona FC that we all know and love. In this section, I will take you through the major changes or developments that took place in this great club. We shall begin from its very beginnings to the present day:\n\nJoan Gamper founded Barcelona on October 22nd, 1899, after Hans Kamper had placed a public notice in a bestselling newspaper, claiming that he will create a football club for the Catalans;\n\nAfter FC Barcelona was formed, it took part in an unprofessional regional football gala that sojourned until the following year, 1910;\n\nIn the same year, the club took part in their first UEFA competitions, which surprisingly scored them multiple trophies;\n\nThe club emerged as the winner in their first appearance in the Copa Del Rey final, where they were honored with the Copa Macaya trophy;\n\nSpain was politically distressed in the year 1925, when hostilities towards the central government erupted;\n\nBarcelona FC went bankrupt and could not purchase players in 1905;\n\nJoan Gamper officially became the club president in 1908, which white-painted the club from a state of liquidation;\n\nThe club relocated to new surroundings, Camp de la Indústria on March 14th 1909. This camp came with a stadium that could care for 8,000 fans;\n\nBased on a winning contest submission by Carles Comamala, the club got its still-in-use crest with only a few changes as of 2012;\n\nThe first testimonial competition was held on February 4, 1917 in honor of Ramón Torralba. Torralba had played for the club from 1913 to 1928;\n\nGamper was asked to renounce his position as the president of the club on June 14, 1925. In the same year, the club was to graduate into a professional football club. The relinquishing, however, slowed down the full-time transition to the following year, 1926;\n\nOn the broad-spectrum, Barcelona FC graduated from its amateur level into a full-time professional football club in 1926;\n\nGamper, after suffering some periods of misery as a result of his withdrawal from his position as president of the club, killed himself on July 30, 1930. The investigation determined that his death had something to do with his declining finances and various difficulties in his personal life;\n\nThe world’s third largest sports stadium, Camp Nou in Barcelona, was first completed in 1957.\n\nOutstanding Identities of Barcelona FC – the Crest and Jerseys and Stadium\n\nThe FC Barcelona Crest\n\nFC Barcelona has its own unique crest that most people around the world are now familiar with. The crest was largely inspired by historical motifs related to Catalonia. Since the formation of FC Barcelona, from 1899-1910, the club has maintained and used the same basic crest. Although the crest has undergone a few changes, its basic form and meaning remains almost the same.\n\nBarcelona FC’s innovative crest in 1899 had a central placed rhombus shape with a crown sitting at the upper tip, with a bat on top of it. This is the Crown of Aragon and King James’ bat. To both sides of the middle shape were two different branches. One of these was the branch of a palm and the other of a laurel tree. They both cross over each other at the lower end.\n\nAlterations were made to the crest after 1899 and, from 1910, the changes took effect with the ST. George Cross found in the upper-left corner. Immediately to the right is the Catalan flag.\n\nThe middle zone had the shorthand writing F.C.B, which only had some minor background changes over the years. The club’s colors are found at the bottom middle, with a football right in the center of it, representing the very soul of the team. The entire crest is finely contoured.\n\nThe FC Barcelona Kit\n\nOn the field, Barcelona stands out in its unique team colors arranged in vertical stripes. Right from 1899-1910 through to 2015 and the present day, the team has used the same kits with only a few minor changes. In 1899-1910, the club had used a long sleeve jersey with light caramel shorts, which have seen some color changes from 1910 to 1998.\n\nIn the early 2000, the club had multiple sponsorship proposals, and all required them to place an additional logo on their jerseys. The club had refused several of them, but eventually agreed to be sponsored by UNICEF.\n\nThe UNICEF logo started appearing on the jersey of the club, and on July 14 2006, the club officially signed a five year agreement with UNICEF with their logo on their jerseys. As part of the sponsorship, Barcelona spent €1.5 million per annum on UNICEF donations.\n\nAfter the five year agreement with UNICEF, in the early 2011 season, they opted for a new sponsorship with QATAR Sports Investment for another 5 years for €150 million. Most recently, the QATAR Foundation logo on their jersey has been replaced by QATAR Airways. Presently, this logo is being used by the club.\n\nHistory of the FC Barcelona Grand Sports Stadium – the Camp Nou Stadium\n\nAfter its inception in 1899, the Barcelona FC didn’t have its own stadium to play on, until moving to the Camp de la Indústria in 1909. The stadium had a modest capacity of around 6000-8000 spectators, but the club would eventually get a new stadium to call its home a little over a decade later.\n\nLes Corts Stadium\n\nLes Corts Stadium, otherwise known as “the Cathedral of Football” was opened on May 20, 1922. The stadium initially had an a total seat capacity of around 20,000 and later grew in capacity to 60,000, as the number of supporters and eager spectators quickly grew. By 1924, the club had amassed roughly 20,000 members through smart campaigning and marketing efforts, and the numbers just kept growing over the years. A need for an even bigger and more glamorous stadium emerged.\n\nCamp Nou Stadium\n\nCamp Nou Stadium (New Stadium), the first stadium of FC Barcelona, was built in 1957. Currently it has a total seat capacity of 98,000 and has been declared the 3rd largest Sports Stadium in the world. Currently the world’s largest stadium, with a total seat capacity of 120,000 is the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\nThe Camp Nou stadium is in a rapid race with the Maracana Stadium to provide the highest capacity of any football stadium in the world, and have scheduled a renovation, which is estimated to increase seat capacity to 103,000. Not only would the drastic change affect the capacity, but there will also be a glass roof that will concentrate the appropriate amount of sunlight onto the playing field. It will also be well-equipped with all manner of gadgets modern technology has to offer. This project, as reported by architect Norman Foster, would require an investment of €300 million.\n\nThe Club’s Reputations List"
