        "text": "RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will next year host the Spanish Super Cup for the fourth time, from Jan. 10 to 14, the Ministry of Sport announced on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, and Atletico Osasuna will take part in the tournament.\n\nAl-Awwal Park in Riyadh will host matches in the knockout stage. Real Madrid will face Atletico Madrid on the evening of Wednesday, Jan. 10, and Barcelona, which holds the last edition’s champions title, will take on Atletico Osasuna the following day.\n\nThe two winners will advance to the final match on the evening of Sunday, Jan. 14.\n\nIt will be the fourth time the tournament has been hosted by the Kingdom, the first being in Jeddah in 2020, when Real Madrid won the title. The second staging of the contest, in Riyadh in 2022, saw Real Madrid again lift the trophy, and the third edition held in the country at the beginning of this year, witnessed Barcelona secure the championship trophy.\n\nBarcelona will participate in the upcoming edition as the champion of the Spanish LaLiga with Real Madrid taking part as the winner of Spain’s Copa del Rey football competition.\n\nOsasuna will be debuting in the Spanish Super Cup as runner-up in the Copa del Rey, and Atletico Madrid will complete the line-up of qualifying teams after coming third in the LaLiga season 2022 to 2023.\n\nInternational TV channels and platforms will cover the event, including the Movistar network which will broadcast live.\n\nHOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA: The Professional Fighters League continued the 2024 PFL Global Playoffs on Friday night with four bouts across the Light Heavyweight and Lightweight divisions at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nIn the main event of the evening, Impa Kasanganay and Josh Silveira battled with a spot in the 2024 PFL Light Heavyweight Championship on the line.\n\nAfter three full rounds, Kasanganay earned the unanimous decision victory and now has the opportunity for a second straight $1 million check and world title belt.\n\nIn the co-main event of the evening, Rob Wilkinson earned a unanimous decision victory against Dovlet Yagshimuradov to advance to the 2024 PFL Light Heavyweight Championship, while becoming the first fighter representing Turkmenistan to qualify for the PFL World Championship.\n\nTo kick off PFL Playoff action in the Lightweight division, Brent Primus overcame 2023 PFL Lightweight finalist Clay Collard to clinch his spot in the 2024 PFL World Championship via unanimous decision.\n\nFurther Lightweight action saw Gadzhi Rabadanov defeat Michael Dufort via second-round knockout, earning a spot in the 2024 PFL World Championship. Rabadanov secured his ninth straight victory and will face Brent Primus for the 2024 PFL Lightweight World Championship.\n\n“Tonight, MMA fans around the world witnessed four remarkable fighters continue their million-dollar PFL dreams,” said PFL CEO Peter Murray. “The 2024 PFL Playoffs have showcased the very best in MMA and we look forward to the third PFL Playoff event on Aug. 23 to determine the remaining matchups in the 2024 PFL World Championship.”\n\nPFL President of Fighter Operations Ray Sefo said: “The PFL provided fans with can’t-miss action in another entertaining PFL Playoff thriller this evening. Congratulations to the four athletes who punched their tickets to the 2024 PFL World Championship.”\n\nOpening the main card, Biaggio Ali Walsh, the grandson of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, returned to the PFL SmartCage for the second pro fight of his budding career against Brian Stapleton. The Las Vegas native showcased his skills and quickly finished Stapleton via first-round knockout just 55 seconds into the fight.\n\nA Bantamweight showcase bout featured Danny Sabatello and the undefeated Lazaro Dayron. The opening frame saw Dayron nearly finish “The Italian Gangster,” but Sabatello used his grappling skills to rebound throughout the bout. In the end, a third-round fence grab by Dayron docked him a point on the scorecards, resulting in a majority draw.\n\nThe 2024 PFL Playoff action continues from The Anthem in Washington, DC for the final playoff event on Friday, Aug. 23. Eight fighters across the Welterweight and Featherweight divisions will enter the PFL SmartCage in pursuit of a 2024 PFL World Championship opportunity.\n\nKlaipeda, Lithuania: Following a setback in Saturday’s qualifying rounds, Team Abu Dhabi’s Rashed Al-Qemzi is facing a big test in Sunday’s Grand Prix of Lithuania as he battles to protect his lead in the 2024 UIM F2 World Championship.\n\nThe four-time F2 powerboat champion, whose victory in Klaipeda last season was his third in the Baltic country, will start from seventh place in the third round of the series as Britain’s Matthew Palfreyman claimed pole position.\n\nThe Emirati driver looked to be moving through to the six-boat shoot-out before he was eliminated by a dramatic final lap from Lithuania’s Edgaras Riabko, who is a single point behind him in the championship standings.\n\nThere was disappointment also for his Abu Dhabi team-mate, Mansoor Al-Mansoori, who failed to progress to the second phase of qualifying and will start tomorrow’s grand prix toward the back of the field.\n\nFresh from a victory in Norway that gave him the championship lead two weeks ago, Al-Qemzi is chasing a fourth career win in Lithuania and a second in succession, and he arrived in Klaipeda full of confidence.\n\nThis season’s F2 championship is shaping up to be one of the most closely fought on record, and there was more evidence of this in the morning free practice session when just 0.219 seconds separated the top three of Finland’s Jarno Vilmunen, Riabko and Al-Qemzi.\n\nIt was a similar story in the opening qualifying session, with Sweden’s Mathilda Wiberg setting the fastest lap ahead of Vilmunen and Portugal’s Duarte Benavente, and Al-Qemzi in sixth spot.\n\nAfter producing a superb performance in Norway to finish second behind Al-Qemzi, Al-Mansoori was unable to reproduce that form and dropped out.\n\nWith only seconds remaining in Q2, Al-Qemzi looked to be progressing before Riabko produced a fine last lap to edge him out of the top six, as Monaco’s Giacomo Sacchi went quickest.\n\nIn the shoot-out, first-round winner Palfreyman, placed third in the championship, saved his best to last to snatch his first F2 pole position from Vilmunen at the death.\n\nWHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W. Virginia: Neither Smash GC captain Brooks Koepka nor teammate Talor Gooch have been happy with their individual results in 2024.\n\nBut with plenty at stake down the stretch in the LIV Golf season, they may be ready to make serious noise.\n\nGooch, the 2023 individual champion, grabbed a share of the first-round lead Friday at LIV Golf Greenbrier, shooting a bogey-free 7-under 63 that was matched by Smash teammate Jason Kokrak and Torque GC’s Sebastian Muñoz.\n\nKoepka is in a five-way tie for fourth, just one stroke back after his 64 on a day in which play was suspended for 80 minutes due to inclement weather.\n\nWith Gooch, Kokrak and Koepka providing the contributing scores, Smash opened up a four-shot advantage over Ripper GC and Legion XIII on the team leaderboard.\n\nSmash’s 20-under total matches the lowest counting score by any team this season in either of the first two rounds in which three scores count.\n\n“It’s always good to have a day where golf is easy,” said Gooch, who hit all 18 greens in regulation while holing out for eagle at the par-4 fifth. “Golf hasn’t been as easy this year as it was last year, so hopefully we can have a couple more easy days coming up.”\n\nGooch won three tournaments last season en route to the season-long championship. His best finish this season is a tie for second at Las Vegas in the second event of the year.\n\nHe hasn’t held the solo lead after any round, and Friday is just the second time he’s shared the lead.\n\nWhile mathematically eliminated from defending his individual title, he still has an outside shot of playing his way into the top 3. He entered this week ranked 11th in points.\n\n“It’s been a bit of a disappointing year, but you’re just trying to get better,” Gooch said. “You’re trying to capture the good golf and make it last as long as possible. We haven’t been able to capture much good golf this year, but that’s why you’ve got to put the work in and just know that it’s going to pay off.”\n\nKoepka won LIV Golf Singapore in May for a league-best fourth career LIV title. But the five-time major winner did not contend in any of this year’s majors.\n\nLike Gooch, he also has no shot at the individual title, as he’s ranked 10th in points, but can still move into the top 3. The individual championship standings will be finalized next month at LIV Golf Chicago.\n\n“This year has not been great,” said Koepka, who was also bogey-free on his round. “This year has been actually very disappointing. I haven’t played anywhere what I want to play. Played absolutely horrible in all the majors and only won once out here, so that’s not anywhere where I want it.”\n\nSmash has one team victory this season, in Las Vegas, but started this week ranked seventh in points. They could still play their way into a top-three seed that will receive a bye for the Dallas Team Championship.\n\nHaving a solid third performance will be key, and Kokrak provided that Friday with his 63. The non-counting score was supplied by reserve John Catlin, who shot 66 in place of Graeme McDowell.\n\n“Golf is a fickle game,” Kokrak said. “It’s hard to be consistent all the time. This year I kind of started off … solid but not great, and then kind of just fell into a little bit of a slump. I think I found something nice in my golf swing the last week or two.”\n\nOnly one team has ever swept the podium in LIV Golf history, during the inaugural 2022 event in London with Stinger GC.\n\nFriday’s round marked the 100th competition day in LIV Golf history, and many of the faces have changed since then, but Smash would love to match that kind of achievement\n\n“These are the types of days you wish you could have more of,” Gooch said. “Hopefully we can have another couple easy days this weekend.”\n\nTEAM SCORES\n\nStandings and counting scores for Friday’s opening round of the team competition at LIV Golf Greenbrier:\n\n1. SMASH GC -20 (Gooch 63, Kokrak 63, Koepka 64)\n\nT2. RIPPER GC -16 (Jones 64, Leishman 65, Smith 66)\n\nT2. LEGION XIII -16 (Rahm 64, Hatton 65, Surratt 65)\n\n4. TORQUE GC -14 (Muñoz 63, Pereira 66, Niemann 67)\n\n5. CLEEKS GC -12 (Bland 64, Meronk 66, Kaymer 68)\n\n6. IRON HEADS GC -11 (Vincent 65, Kozuma 66, Lee 68)\n\n7.

RANGEGOATS GC -3 (Uihlein 68, Wolff 68, Pieters 71)\n\n13. 4ACES GC -2 (Perez 68, Reed 70, Varner III 70)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tennessee: Hideki Matsuyama and Denny McCarthy combined to make nearly 300 feet of putts Friday, so it was no surprise to see them sharing the lead going into the steamy weekend of the FedEx St. Jude Championship.\n\nMatsuyama recovered from a shaky start — he missed a 4-foot birdie putt on No. 2 and put his tee shot into the water on the par-3 fourth — with two long birdie putts and a 3-wood to about 12 feet on the par-5 16th for one of his easier birdies. He had a 6-under 64.\n\nMcCarthy, with a reputation for a smooth putting stroke, put that to good use on the smooth greens of TPC Southwind. He holed three birdie putts from about 25 feet or longer to offset a pair of bogeys in his round of 63.\n\nThey were at 11-under 129, one shot ahead of another great putter, Sam Burns, who shot 29 on the front nine before cooling slightly. He had a 63.\n\nScottie Scheffler got on track late with three straight birdies for a 65 and was two back.\n\nThe first PGA Tour postseason event is the most consequential. The points are quadrupled, and the top 50 players in the FedEx Cup advance to the BMW Championship next week and are assured of playing in all the $20 million signature events next year.\n\nJordan Spieth moved closer to the end of his year. He had a pair of double bogeys on the par 3s, one from the water on No. 4, another by taking two shots to get out of bunker on No. 14, and posted a 75 that left him in a tie for 65th.\n\nSpieth has talked about the possibility of wrist surgery in the offseason, and he could have the next three months clear barring two of his best rounds of the year.\n\nOthers who had better seasons could afford a spotty performance. Rory McIlroy is the No. 3 seed going into the postseason and turned in a lackluster performance on another day when the heat index was in the range of 110 degrees (40 degrees Celsius). He played the two par 5s in 3 over and shot 73, leaving him in a tie for 58th.\n\nThis is a big week for McCarthy, who has never won on the PGA Tour and is at No. 45. A victory would move him into the top five in the standings and secure a spot in the Tour Championship for the top 30.\n\nDitto for Justin Rose, who is outside the magic number at No. 55. He had another 66 and was tied for fifth with Nick Dunlap (65)\n\nAmazingly, McCarthy is doing this with what he described as a torn labrum without getting into too many details.\n\n“I don’t want to divulge too much. It’s bothering me, and I’ve been able to do enough the last few days to push through it,” he said. “The heat helps it. Yeah, looking forward to a challenge on the weekend.”\n\nMatsuyama doesn’t divulge too much on any topic, and he summed up his round thusly: “I missed a short putt there at 2, knocked it in the water at 4, but from that point on, I really played well and putted well.”\n\nAs for the hot weather?\n\n“Today was nice and cool,” the Japanese star said, smiling as it was translated to English.\n\nMatsuyama was in good spirits about his game. He is coping with having a bag stolen last week in London while at a restaurant that included his wallet and the passports of his caddie and coach. They are in Japan trying to get new passports. He’s tied for the lead in Memphis.\n\nPlayers will go off both sides in groups of three Saturday to cope with thunderstorms expected in the morning.\n\nScheffler and Xander Schauffele generated the most interest from a gallery that was subdued by the scorching heat, a pairing that combines three of the four majors and $44 million in earnings on the PGA Tour this year.\n\nSchauffele started well until running into trouble on the tough 12th — water off the tee, and then after a penalty drop, a shot that hit off the cart path and bounded over the green near a bush. He did well to make double bogey from there, shot 69 and was six shots behind.\n\nScheffler played bogey-free but didn’t look to get much out of his round until the very end when he stuffed a wedge on the 15th for birdie, got up-and-down for birdie on the 16th and holed a birdie putt from just inside 25 feet on the 17th.\n\nMost curious about his day is seeing caddie Ted Scott walk all the way up to the green on the second hole (from 71 yards) and the ninth hole (102 yards) to make sure the yardage was accurate. And then he jogged back to Scheffler’s shot — in severe heat.\n\n“As he was running up to the ninth green, I was thinking to myself, ‘Why is he doing that? I’m in the rough.’ He wanted to make sure the number was correct on the green,” Scheffler said. “He did that twice today. And I guess he got tired because he didn’t do it the rest of the day.”"
