        "text": "Vinicius Junior scored a first-half hat-trick as Real Madrid were crowned Spanish Super Cup champions after a 4-1 demolition of rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Brazilian twice exploited Barcelona's lackadaisical high line to put Real 2-0 up within the first 10 minutes before Robert Lewandowski halved the deficit just after the half-hour mark.\n\nBut Vinicius completed his hat-trick from the spot in the 39th minute, having been hauled down in the area by Ronald Araujo, before Rodrygo completed a one-sided win after the interval.\n\nTo compound a miserable evening in Riyadh for Barcelona, Araujo was dismissed in the 71st minute for another foul on Vinicius.\n\nHow the teams lined up | Match stats\n\nLaLiga table | Fixtures | Results\n\nGet Sky Sports | Download the Sky Sports App\n\nHow Real marched to Super Cup glory\n\nReal, who trailed 3-2 with just five minutes remaining against Atletico Madrid in the semi-final on Wednesday before triumphing 5-3 after extra-time, continued their recent dominance over their rivals.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's side prevailed in October's El Clasico meeting and are seven points ahead of Barcelona at the halfway point of the LaLiga campaign.\n\nThis latest encounter marked a chance for Barcelona to land a blow of their own but Xavi's decision to employ a risky high defensive line backfired spectacularly as Real hit the front after seven minutes.\n\nJude Bellingham - who at the final whistle celebrated winning his first trophy with Real - split the defence with a sublime pass that allowed Vinicius to round Inaki Pena and slot into an empty net.\n\nReal and Vinicius capitalised again on plenty of space being left in behind as the 23-year-old slid in to convert Rodrygo's cross.\n\nBarcelona responded well to the double blow as Ferran Torres' snapshot cannoned against the bar before both he and Lewandowski forced Andriy Lunin into important saves to keep Real two ahead.\n\nLewandowski's thunderous volley from the edge of the area after 33 minutes dragged Barcelona back into the contest but the Catalans were the architects of their own downfall moments later.\n\nAraujo paid the price for having his arm around the neck of Vinicius, who went down which saw a penalty awarded and the Barcelona defender booked.\n\nVinicius made no mistake from 12 yards to re-establish Real's two-goal lead at half-time.\n\nXavi made a triple substitution as Joao Felix, Fermin Lopez and Lamine Yamal were introduced just after the hour mark but it did not have the required impact as Real went further ahead in the 64th minute.\n\nVinicius was involved again as his poor cross was tamely cut out by Jules Kounde straight into the path of Rodrygo, who drilled beyond Pena from inside the area.\n\nMatters worsened for Barcelona as Araujo missed an attempted clearance and instead brought down Vinicius, with the Uruguayan having to trudge off the pitch for a second bookable offence.\n\nAncelotti was able to withdraw Vinicius and Bellingham in the closing stages with the job done and attention fast turning to Thursday's Copa del Rey showdown against Atletico.\n\nXavi: I'm embarrassed - worst performance yet\n\nBarcelona head coach Xavi:\n\n\"I think it's been one of our worst performances of the season so far. We played well for a while until Robert scored, but that wasn't enough. We need to do a lot of self criticism, a lot.\n\n\"I'm ready for the criticism. Actually there was criticism already before this game, there's always been. That is not a problem for me, I believe in the project, I believe in myself, I believe in our players and I think we're capable of reversing the situation starting next Thursday.\n\n\"There are three titles left and we need to fight for them. I feel strong, I feel calm despite this is a step back for this project and this is a blow.\"\n\nAncelotti hails 'extraordinary' Vinicius\n\nReal Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti:\n\n\"We deserved to win. We started very well. We made the best of our players in the beginning of the game. Vinicius was extraordinary, he played an extraordinary game. But after that it's been a whole different game where Barcelona took control over the ball and they took their chances.\n\n\"We've struggled to take it back. Vinicius just needs to do his job and he said it perfectly earlier: he needs to bring joy to the people and titles to Real Madrid.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nReal Madrid are back in action on Thursday when they make the trip to city rivals Atletico Madrid in the fourth round of the Copa del Rey; kick-off 8.30pm. Carlo Ancelotti's side then host Almeria in LaLiga on Sunday; kick-off 3.15pm."
