        "text": "You are obviously someone who has never seen the \"Madrid of Hierro and Zidane\" you picked the two of the wiliest characters ever to play for Madrid. Hierro is a classy guy but I have so many memories of him getting up in Barcelona players' faces, the same goes for Zidane.\n\nThat red card Marcelo picked up was deserved but his tackle wasn't malicious. It was pure frustration borne out of wanting to retrieve possession with so little time left on the clock. The brawl that broke out afterwards... Well it takes two to tango. I don't understand how you coach your team not to pick up red cards players are going to mistime tackles and pick up bookings... That's a FAKHT as my friend Rafa would say.\n\nAs far as playing football... maybe you could complain over last season's performances vs. Barcelona. But the Supercup? Football was played and Barcelona escaped very narrowly with the tie.\n\nIf that performance disgusts/shames you then you have a problem with club football in general... not with Real Madrid.\n\nlets be realistic, we are doing too many dumb-unnecesarry tackles. classless.\n\nUgh.. Messi burried 3 & assisted 2?\n\nWe played well, very well.. Well enough to win, but we needed to keep our heads and compose ourselves at the back & infront of goal.\n\nCoentrao impressed me, he's a fighter and I liked what he brought in our midfield.\n\nRonaldo needs to step it up massively against these suckers, how can someone with a straight face say he's better than the little sh!t is beyond me.\n\nUnlucky overall, but they won the way we wanted to win last season. Hurts eh? Less chances, better efficiency.\n\nDam Aguero would've been epic playing on the left with Ronaldo in his ManU role upfront.\n\nPepe was huge, but that yellow card he got was nasty. Elbow to the chest was it? Went unnoticed, im glad. Marcelo's foul was understandable but inexusable and Mourinho is making a mockery of this great club.\n\nWe have found at way to better them ( atleast equal them ), we need to make it count. Overall, things shouldve been different. But this is football, the slightly better side doesn't always win.\n\nOur performance for the most part was something to be proud of, i'd be more worried had I been a Cule and my team lost the Cup with performances like that over the 2 legs.\n\nThey hate our guts, which makes them play better, it makes us play worse.\n\nRonaldo is fast running in a straight line. Too bad Alves is just as quick.\n\nOver & out.\n\nGG bitches, till the next time.\n\nOuch that was gutting. OUCH! To concede like that after equalizing..\n\nMourinho is putting more and more pressure on him with his antics and it's getting frustrating. Our players lose focus too many times and this brawls are hurting us much more than cules.\n\nI know some of you believe you have to defend his actions just because he is Real Madrid coach, but enough is enough. Read Relano's column in AS and his thoughts about what image Real Madrid is creating under Mourinho. Yes we are better than two seasons ago, but at what cost?\n\nI would really like to know what Perez is thinking at this moment. My bet is that he knows Mourinho is damaging the image of this club, but is powerless to stop him. He gave him all the control in the world and now all he can do is wait.\n\nNobody is without the sin, but Mourinho is the total opposite of elegance, high class and moral values that Madrid represents. His only attribute is the fact that he knows how to win titles, so he better wins one this year.\n\nWhat's happened has happened.. we need to move on.. I believe we are improving and will only get better with Sahin, Altintop to come back injury, I think our signings have been superb with Coentrao being the most impressive, wasn't sure on the Callejon signing but he has also been impressive with his movement and adds something different to our team.\n\nI believe we are getting closer and Barcelona know this too.. yes we have our fair share of clumsy/hot tempered players but so do Barca.\n\nI also don't agree with the stuff said about Benzema on here.. he has carried on his form from pre season 2 assists and 1 goal is it over the two legs? I do think he needs to improve on his finishing but \"useless\" he is not.. far from it.. I think he will have a great season with us this year.\n\nRonaldo kind of disappointed me over the two legs.. he feels its necessary to take on the whole Barcelona defence by himself and that was frustrating to watch, what was even more frustrating was Mourinho not doing anything about it or changing anything with him.\n\nfwiw I think if we had Ade on loan today and he was on the pitch I believe he would've made a difference (in my opinion)\n\nOverall i'm not too bothered by the result.. don't get me wrong I hate losing to Barcelona but it's a minor cup if this was copa/la liga then I'd be extremely upset/angry.. I also think the performance was brilliant by our players especially in the first leg.. onwards and upwards.\n\nRacists chants from cules, shocker .\n\nI loved the game, i love the team and the attitude. I loved the brawl, i loved Marcelos tackle. I loved Pipita looking like he's about to kill someone in the brawl, i loved how he celebrated Benzema's goal.\n\nTough luck that we lost, we deserved more but good job anyway. We need to focus on beating everyone else in La Liga and CL, when it comes to El Classico, the difference between the 2 sides will be even smaller, or non existing by then.\n\nOne more thing about the brawl. They jumped on Marcelo, their whole benchtards stood up and run towards him like he just killed someone and they were cops. When you start it, you better be men enough to take it. I don't buy this image bullshit, especially when it's being sold by Xavi...\n\nHe always does that when a important goal is scored. Remember him doing it in the Copa final and two years ago against Sevilla at home. This guy is just a real Madridista.\n\nBtw guys I think we would have won in the Bernabeu with Adebayor. Just saw how much headers Benzema missed. Too much, he did get sht load of chances and with his second goal he even missed the first attempt. He better steps his game up or else Pipita is gonna take over.\n\nHe even celebrated though Benzema is his rival. This guy just has a great heart for the club.\n\n1. Real Madrid can be proud as they are the only team to have gone toe to toe with Barcelona in a long time (probably not since Chelsea in 2009). The difference between the two teams was minimal and you could call it luck, Messi or poor finishing. The fact is that Madrid could have easily walked away with a hatful of goals and Messi or no Messi Barca could have been soundly beaten.\n\nMadrid have nothing be ashamed of.\n\n2. Why do Barca fans continuously moan about Madrid playing rough? Yes, they were physical. But this is football, not figure skating. Madrid outplayed them for vast spans of the tie, but all I constantly hear is that Madrid played rough. Almost no-one congratulates Madrid for actually being Barca's equal.\n\n3. Why does Barca always have to have an excuse? Even this time around when Real turned out to be Barca's equal we hear them trying to downgrade this. The first leg they said Barca wasn't fully fit and stressed that this wasn't a full team. In the second leg Barca played the full team (except for Puyol) and they still keep saying Barca wasn't fully fit. But who says Madrid is fully fit? Yes, they had a great preseason, but Madrid is not fully fit either. The league hasn't started yet.\n\nNo respect whatsoever for their opponents.\n\n4. Why is it that Barcelona still get away with all the diving and flopping? It really is downgrading them as a team.\n\n5. I really think Madrid need to buy a good finisher as both Benzema and Higuain miss way too many chances. That is the only missing link to Madrid reclaiming Spain and maybe even Europe. That and Ronaldo being more of a team player when playing Barca.\n\nMessi definately has the perfect team auround him which makes his job easier. But this Ronaldo plays great despite his poor utilisation is laughable. Did you see the game? I lost count how many times Ronaldo made stupid decisions with the ball. DiMaria is pretty much the same but at least his dribbles are more successful. It's Ozil you should be feeling sorry about because he's the only one of the attacking four who's a team player and has a football brain .. Benzema to a lesser extent as well.\n\nIt isn't so much about the amount of goals but the timing of them. Yes we scored four times but three of those goals were to equalize. The chances we had early on should have been capitalized on not for the sake of scoring but for the sake of ensuring that the momentum stayed with us and that we always maintained the upper hand.\n\nThe one thing I must say though is that Barca's performance over the two legs is exactly what we needed to do in many of the previous matchups. They went into a game and were dominated, conceeded many opportunities and ultimately goals but they knew they would get a few chances, even two or three and if they capitalized on that they could get something out of the game. When they dominate, they tear teams apart and when they are dominated they are clinical enough to still pull through. We're close but not quite there as yet.\n\nAgreed. People always complain Madrid needs a new striker that can actually score goals, or another midfielder to breakaway faster and built attacks better, but there were at least four or five situations in these two games, where Ronaldo had the ball in 4 on 4 breaks or 3 on 3 breaks, and Ronaldo put his head down and simply ran into the defender in front of him, instead of looking for a sharp pass into a gap, or a give and go with a teammate. If some unnamed midget has the ball in these situations he makes something happen. That´s the difference, but the gap is closing.\n\nMourinho needs to calm the F*** down before all players become paranoid and land in a mental asylum. Pepe and Marcelo clearly went nuts. They were targeting players.\n\nHe probably didn't notice him. His objective is to degrade Madrid, so he wouldn't be focused enough to see his team is doing no differently.\n\nUh, what the hell are you talking about? When our players (Xabi, Coentrao) get targeted where are you to cry out for \"teh justice\"?\n\nWhere are you to cry out that Valdes, Pinto or Villa need to calm down? That busKKKets, alves and Ineista should stop the diving?\n\nIt's a one way street for some of you because it is as if you're blind to all they do but have heightened senses and see everything a Madrid player does."
