        "text": "FC Barcelona will receive a much-needed cash windfall from Saudi Arabia, as highlighted by Spanish publications such as MARCA.\n\nXavi Hernandez's troops head to the Middle East this week to get the defense of their Super Cup underway.\n\nThe first piece of silverware in Xavi's reign was granted this time last year, when the Blaugrana beat bitter rivals Real Madrid 3-1 in the final thanks to a goal-and-assist masterclass from Player of the Match Gavi.\n\nAnd while the youngster won't be on hand to try and help his team reclaim the title, thanks to an ACL tear picked up on international duty, Barca could once again meet Madrid for a Saudi episode of El Clasico in the last dance.\n\nThis is because Barca has been pitted against 2022/2023's Copa del Rey runners-up Osasuna in the semi-finals on Thursday, with an all-Spanish capital derby between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid scheduled the day before that.\n\nMore than the chance for bragging rights is up for grabs, however.\n\nAs pointed out by SPORT, the Spanish football federation known as the RFEF receives a handsome $43.8 million (€40 million) annually from the Saudis for having its competition played in their kingdom.\n\nThis time round, for the Super Cup's 40th edition, just over half of that sum at $23 million (€21 million) will be distributed among the four teams taking part.\n\nAs the two biggest clubs in Spain - if not the world - who are pretty much guaranteed to participate every year if they win or finish runners-up in either league or the Copa del Rey, Barca and Real Madrid will be paid $6.6 million (€6 million) each.\n\nIn comparison, Atleti is due half that amount and Osasuna a paltry $880,000 (€880,000).\n\nThere is also an extra $1.1 million (€1 million) on the line for the two teams that reach the final, with $821,000 (€750,000) going to the outfits that are sent home early.\n\nAfter that, at least a further $550,000 (€500,000) can be claimed by the winner.\n\nAnd if Barca can repeat their success of 2023 and go all the way, they will earn a much-needed $8.5 million (€7.8 million) in prize money that would greatly help them navigate Financial Fair Play and perhaps make summer signings."
