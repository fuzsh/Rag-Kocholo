        "text": "Real Madrid - FC Barcelona: Super Cup slips away (2-1) | FC Barcelona\n\nBarça lost the Spanish Super Cup in Madrid by the narrowest of margins after they were defeated 2-1 and with the 3-2 win in the Camp Nou last week lost on the away goals rule. The team could walk away with their heads high though, as they came back from a poor start, finding themselves two down and with just ten men within the first half hour.\n\nVilanova: \"I'm so proud of my players\" | FC Barcelona\n\n\"Throughout the first minutes of the game Madrid created chances thanks to either our defensive errors or by using long balls, and they scored twice. This is the proudest I’ve been of my players, they played the whole second half down a man, and in the second half we created up to five very clear chances to score against an opponent that didn’t leave their own half of the pitch.\"\n\nXavi: \"We could have won the Super Cup\" | FC Barcelona\n\nThe FC Barcelona vice-captain, Xavi Hernández, who played the entire match at the Santiago Bernabéu, said that the \"two errors and the red card\" were key in his team’s defeat this evening. On the other hand, Barça’s number 6 noted that \"we bounced back well and we could have won the Super Cup. We kept on playing football and we were true to our style of play despite playing down a man. In the second half we created enough chances to win the title.\"\n\nChampions League group stage draw | FC Barcelona\n\nTito Vilanova and his men are well aware of who their rivals could be in the Champions League group stage. A total of 22 teams could be paired up with FC Barcelona in the first phase of the continental competition. The draw to determine the teams in each group will take place this Thursday at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco at 17.45.\n\nMessi and Iniesta, both of whom are up for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, travel to Monaco | FC Barcelona\n\nLeo Messi and Andrés Iniesta will attend UEFA’s Champions League group-stage draw this Thursday in Monaco. The ceremony starts at 17.45. The two Barça players are on the shortlist for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award 2012. The winner will be announced during the ceremony. Messi, the winner of the inaugural edition of the award, and Iniesta, are competing with Cristiano Ronaldo for the accolade.\n\nAlex Song debuts for Barça | FC Barcelona\n\nEven though it probably wasn’t the dream debut Alex Song was hoping for, the Cameroon international played his first official game for FC Barcelona. The midfielder, who started the match on the bench at the Santiago Bernabéu, trotted out onto the pitch on 75 minuted for Sergio Busquets. In total, the player played 19 minutes - as a center back - seeing that Piqué was moved farther up the pitch.\n\nModric and Song arrivals indicate Barcelona and Real are thinking about each other’s style | Zonal Marking\n\nReal dominated the game in the opening period when the match was frantic and direct. Constant long balls in behind the Barcelona defence produced numerous chances and a red card for Adriano, and Real could have been 4-0 up before Barcelona had even started playing.\n\nScrimmage against Santboià ahead of Sabadell clash | FC Barcelona\n\nBarça B scrimmaged against FC Santboià this morning at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper ahead of this weekend’s Liga Adelante match. The reserve side will face Sabadell this Sunday at 18.00 at the Miniestadi. This morning’s training match allowed Eusebio Sacristán to field players that have yet to get consistent playing time in official games.\n\nJavi Martinez joins Bayern Munich - Yahoo! Eurosport UK\n\nBilbao, who had earlier claimed that Martinez had left to discuss terms and undertake a medical in Munich without their permission, will receive a £32 million fee from Bayern which matches the buyout clause in the player's contract. Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed that the player helped push the move through by accepting a lower salary than he might have otherwise expected.\n\nAthletic Bilbao lack options in the transfer market - ESPNFC\n\nAthletic's Basque-only policy means the club's transfer options are limited, but Malaga left-back Nacho Monreal, Granada midfielder Mikel Rico, Atletico Madrid midfielder Raul Garcia, Real Sociedad attacker Antoine Griezmann and Real Betis playmaker Benat Etxeberria are all potential targets ahead of Friday's transfer deadline, according to reports in Bilbao and Madrid.\n\nAthletic Bilbao’s wantaway stars | Pitchside Europe - Yahoo! Eurosport UK\n\nBarcelona fans are happy with their 100 per cent winning start to the season, more so because Real Madrid fans are bewildered why their side has managed just a draw and two defeats from their first three games. The champions hope that new signing Luca Modric will add an incisive touch and speed of thought absent in their performances so far.\n\nSwans agree Hernandez deal | Sky Sports\n\nSky Sports understands Swansea have reached an agreement with Valencia to sign Spanish winger Pablo Hernandez in a €7million (£5.5m) deal. The 27-year-old, who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, is set to sign a three-year contract at the Liberty Stadium."
