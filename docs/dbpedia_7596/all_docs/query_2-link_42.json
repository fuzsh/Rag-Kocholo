        "text": "REAL MADRID were winners on penalties over rivals Atletico in the Spanish Super Cup final.\n\nFederico Valverde was the key man for Los Blancos as he cynically scythed down Alvaro Morata with five minutes left to pick up a red card but, crucially, keep the scores level.\n\nIn a competition that is normally played by the Spanish league and cup winners, Real Madrid overcame Atleti in a battle between two teams who were trophyless last season.\n\nWhy are there four teams in Spanish Super Cup?\n\nUp until now, the Spanish Super Cup - or Supercopa de Espana in its native tongue - was contested between two teams.\n\nBarcelona are the current reigning champions, having extended their record to win a 13th title by beating Sevilla in Morocco last season.\n\nThis was also the first time it had been a single-legged affair and based outside of Spain, with the two participants traditionally playing home and away fixtures.\n\nBut the new format has been seen as a money-making deal, with the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) receiving 120million euros (£102m) over three years to host the competition at the King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe previous format would also have seen Barcelona face cup winners Valencia in the final, while the new format means Real Madrid's marketable Galacticos will still participate.\n\nWith the tournament being spread out over several days, and the searing heat of the Saudi summer, the Spanish Super Cup has also been moved to January - as opposed to its previous dates in August.\n\nThe move has been heavily criticised by La Liga president Javier Tebas and Spanish TV broadcasters RTVE for their decision to host the match in Saudi Arabia due to the conutry's human rights record, in particular surrounding women.\n\nBut RFEF president Luis Rubiales insists women would be able to attend the matches without restriction.\n\nWhat teams are involved?\n\nThe teams selected are the top two in La Liga and the Copa del Rey finalists from the previous season.\n\nIn the case that one team can enter through both competitions, the remaining place goes to the next highest in the league.\n\nThe 2019-20 teams are:\n\nValencia (Copa del Rey winners)\n\nBarcelona (La Liga champions and Copa del Rey runners-up)\n\nAtletico Madrid (La Liga runners-up)\n\nReal Madrid (La Liga third place)\n\nThe semi finals are decided in a draw with no restriction, with the winners facing each other in the final.\n\nThe 2019-20 fixtures are:"
