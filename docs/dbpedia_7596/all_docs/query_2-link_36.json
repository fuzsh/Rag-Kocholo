        "text": "Vinicius Junior scored a historic hat-trick as Real Madrid battered Barcelona 4-1 in Sunday's Supercopa de Espana final in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHis three goals all came inside the opening 39 minutes at the King Saud University Stadium before Rodrygo wrapped up an emphatic victory in the second half.\n\nRobert Lewandowski netted a superb consolation goal for Barca, who ended the game with 10 men after Ronald Araujo was sent off once the scoring had been completed.\n\nVinicius opened the scoring in the sixth minute when he raced onto a through pass from Jude Bellingham before dribbling around Barca keeper Inaki Pena and shooting into the net from eight yards.\n\nWith the game being played at the home of Al Nassr, Vinicius decided to celebrate his early strike by performing Cristiano Ronaldo's famous 'SIU' routine.\n\nVinicius scored again to make it 2-0 less than three minutes later with a slick sliding finish after fellow Brazilian Rodrygo had exposed Barca's high defensive line.\n\nBarca hit back in the 33rd minute when Lewandowski netted his second goal in four days with a rocket volley from 20 yards.\n\nBut Vinicius restored Madrid's two goal lead with a penalty in the 39th minute. He had won the spot-kick himself when he was fouled by Ronald Araujo.\n\nVinicius is now the first Brazilian player to score a hat-trick against Barcelona for Real Madrid. He is also the first player to score a Clasico hat-trick in the Supercopa de Espana.\n\nBarcelona never look likely to fight back from two goals down and their hopes of a turnaround were killed completely in the 64th minute when Rodrygo guided home a fine low shot from 13 yards.\n\nAraujo was then dismissed in the 71st minute when he was shown a second yellow card. Both of Araujo's bookings were for fouls committed against Vinicius.\n\nHighlights: Real Madrid 4-1 Barcelona"
