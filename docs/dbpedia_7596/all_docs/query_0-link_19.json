        "text": "Barcelona's 6-2 win over Real Madrid\n\nTen years since the Iniestazo\n\nBack on 27 May 2009, Barcelona conquered both Spain and Europe to become the fifth club to ever clinch the treble, and the first Spanish side to do so.\n\nPep Guardiola's squad deployed a unique style of football, based on the ideals of Johan Cruyff's side in the 1990s which was subsequently perfected by the Catalan following his appointment as Blaugrana head coach.\n\nA team consisting of players such as Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Thierry Henry, Sergio Busquets and Pedro Rodriguez dominated against Manchester United in the Champions League final in Rome as they lifted Europe's greatest prize.\n\nThis team would then go on to win the European Super Cup, the Supercopa de Espana and the Club World Cup, making Barcelona the first team in history to win all six trophies they competed for in a single campaign.\n\nIn the same season, the Catalan side beat Real Madrid 6-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu, while they finished nine points ahead of Los Blancos as they won the title in LaLiga Santander."
