Second-half goals from attacker Ferran Torres and German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan secured the win for Barcelona. Forward Munir El Haddadi scored the goal for Osasuna, who had Dutch midfielder Daley Sinkgraven sent off late in the second half.\n\nOsasuna, on the other hand, beat Almeria 1-0 in their most recent league game. A first-half goal from Croatia international Ante Budimir sealed the deal for Osasuna.\n\nBarcelona take on Osasuna in the second Supercopa de Espana semi-final on Thursday night as they aim to retain their crown.\n\nAn emphatic victory for the Catalans over Real Madrid in this competition last season set the tone for their eventual La Liga title triumph, although their title defence has so far been a pretty shoddy one. Xavi's side depart for Saudi Arabia seven points adrift of the current joint leaders.\n\nThe Catalans take on a middling Osasuna side who qualified for this four-team competition by virtue of their Copa del Rey run last term. Los Rojillos were eventually downed by Rodrygo and Real Madrid after reaching the final for the second time in the club's history. Nevertheless, Jagoba Arrasate's side are huge underdogs to taste silverware in the Kingdom.\n\nThursday's winner will take on one of the Madrid giants in Sunday's final.\n\nHere's 90min's preview of Barca's Supercopa de Espana semi-final against Osasuna.\n\nWhat time does Barcelona vs Osasuna kick-off?\n\nLocation: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nStadium: King Saud University Stadium\n\nDate: Thursday 11 January\n\nKick-off Time: 19:00 GMT / 14:00 ET / 11:00 PT\n\nReferee: Alejandro Muniz Ruiz\n\nVAR: Carlos del Cerro Grande\n\nBarca's injury woes worsened at the start of 2024 when Joao Cancelo picked up a knee injury in the last-gasp win over Las Palmas.\n\nThe dynamic full-back has been included in the squad for Thursday's game, as have Pedri and Inigo Martinez. Yet, there are doubts over whether any of these stars will feature in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMarcos Alonso and Marc-Andre ter Stegen are recovering from back injuries, while Gavi is out for the remainder of the season. Vitor Roque should once again earn minutes off the bench.\n\nOsasuna predicted lineup vs Barcelona\n\nOsasuna predicted lineup vs Barca (4-3-3): Herrera; Areso, Catena, D. Garcia, Pena; Munoz, Moncayola, Oroz; Avila, Budimir, Gomez.\n\nBarcelona vs Osasuna score prediction\n\nVery little has come easy for Barcelona this season, and that was the case when these two sides met for the first time this season. Barca eventually prevailed 2-1 after Osasuna were reduced to ten men in the closing stages of the September league game.\n\nJust three Spanish clubs have conceded more league goals than Osasuna this season, with Arrasate's side particularly porous on the road. Osasuna's only victory away from home since the first weekend of October was against third-tier Castellon in the Copa del Rey.\n\nThus, while Xavi's Barca have been struggling after they were stunned by Girona before Christmas, they could enjoy a more comfortable outing on Thursday and set up a blockbuster final.\n\nFollowing a hard-fought Copa del Rey win against fourth tier Barbastro at the weekend, Barcelona have made the long trip to the Middle East for this yearâ€™s edition of the Spanish Super Cup as the defending La Liga champions take on last seasonâ€™s Cup runners-up Osasuna on Thursdayâ€™s second semi-final at the Al-Awwal Park Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nReal Madrid beat AtlÃ©tico Madrid in a semi-final for the ages on Wednesday and now await the winner of Thursdayâ€™s clash for what will either be a repeat of last seasonâ€™s Copa del Rey Final against Osasuna or another El ClÃ¡sico in a rematch of the 2023 Supercopa Final against BarÃ§a.\n\nLATEST VIDEO FROM SB NATION\n\nBrandi Chastain: cut from USWNT, bad role model â€¦ Icon\n\nYou know that expression \"a picture is worth a thousand words\"? That started because of Brandi Chastain. Probably. You know the picture I'm talking about. She had just won the '99 World Cup with a penalty kick, and in a moment of unfiltered elation fell to her knees, ripped her shirt off, and screamed with a joy most of us can only hope to one day feel. Today, it's universally regarded as a symbol of women's strength, and fearlessness, and ability. And while some saw it that way at the time... many, very loud people, did not. Let's view this photo, and Chastain herself, through the prism.\n\nVIEW MOREVIEW LESS\n\nThat 2023 Super Cup title game was one of the highlights of last season for the Blaugrana, with a dominant win over their biggest rivals in a game that gave Xavi HernÃ¡ndez his favorite starting XI and tactics that would build the foundation for a comfortable La Liga title run.\n\nIt was also that victory over Madrid that started a seven-week period of breathtaking football, with some of the most beautiful stuff the Catalans had played in virtually half a decade. They were destroying everyone in front of them before injuries and a painful Europa League exit against Manchester United derailed what could have been a great finish to last season, but itâ€™s easy to forget just how well BarÃ§a played in January and February of 2023 beginning with that special ClÃ¡sico victory.\n\nBut in order to set up another ClÃ¡sico and give themselves a chance to defend their Supercopa crown and maybe start another great run, BarÃ§a must overcome the big obstacle that is Osasuna. And as crazy as it may sound, beating Osasuna might be tougher than beating Real Madrid. The team from Pamplona have been a thorn on BarÃ§aâ€™s side for several seasons now, and even though they havenâ€™t beaten the Blaugrana in 12 years they have almost always found a way to play highly competitive, extremely close matches despite the gap in talent.\n\nOsasuna donâ€™t get a chance to play for trophies very often, and after a heartbreaking Cup Final loss last season they are hungry for another shot at Real Madrid and already know they are more than capable of causing BarÃ§a enough problems to give themselves a real chance to finally win this time. They are healthy and having a solid season in the league, and it took BarÃ§a a Robert Lewandowski penalty in the 85th minute to beat an Osasuna side that outplayed them for the entire game when these two first met last September.\n\nThis will be tough, physical and very competitive, and BarÃ§a are not even close to their best. This is Osasunaâ€™s best chance to beat the Blaugrana in literally a decade, and this game means everything to them. If BarÃ§a arenâ€™t ready for war from the start, theyâ€™ll go home three days earlier than expected.\n\nBarcelona look to defend their Supercopa de Espana title as they match up against last year's Copa del Rey runners-up Osasuna in the semifinals from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe expanded four-team competition features the league and domestic cup title winners from the previous year, in addition to the cup finalists and highest league finisher otherwise unqualified. With Copa del Rey winners Real Madrid and La Liga third-place finishers Atletico Madrid meeting in the other semifinal, these two clubs will battle for the other spot in Sunday's final.\n\nBoth Barcelona and Osasuna are having down years by their own standards. Barca won the league title last season and Osasuna finished in a European qualification position as well as reaching the Copa del Rey final.\n\nThis season, however, Barcelona sit third in the league, a full seven points adrift of those above, while Osasuna reside in 12th and narrowly survived a lower-league opponent in their Copa del Rey Round of 32 matchup over the weekend.\n\nUSA: Click here to see the latest odds for Barcelona vs Osasuna and bet Spanish Super Cup matches\n\nBarcelona vs Osasuna prediction, odds\n\nMoneyline lean: Barcelona (-285)\n\nScore prediction: Barcelona 2-0 Osasuna\n\nThere's an expectation that Barcelona will open the floodgates against Osasuna in the semifinal, as they have created the most chances of any team in Spain this season. Yet they struggle to finish those opportunities as Robert Lewandowski flounders in front of goal.\n\nWith Pedri out injured for another few weeks and Gavi out for the season, the Barcelona midfield lacks the creativity to pummel teams and may have to grind this one out against an Osasuna side sure to be defending in numbers.\n\nBarcelona vs Osasuna match facts\n\nDate: Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024\n\nKickoff Time: 9 p.m. local (2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT)\n\nLocation: King Saud University Stadium (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia)\n\nReferee: Alejandro Muniz\n\nLast meeting: Osasuna 1-2 Barcelona (Sep. 3, 2023 | La Liga)\n\nBarcelona vs Osasuna best bet\n\nPick: Under 2.5 goals\n\nOdds: +130 (DraftKings)\n\nBarcelona have not defended well this season compared to their record-setting performances last campaign, but they remain a force at the back on the whole. They have conceded in four straight league matches since holding Atletico Madrid off the scoresheet, but in two of their last three they held their opponents under 1.0 expected goals.\n\nA big issue for Barca has been the injury to regular goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, and his backup Inaki Pena has been poor. Yet Barca still concede the third-fewest expected goals in the Spanish top flight, and Osasuna do not create many chances themselves.\n\nThe only real question is whether Osasuna can keep a lid on the match, and with Barcelona holding the third-worst finishing mark in the Spanish top flight thanks to Robert Lewandowski's miserable season in front of goal continues, there's a decent chance of Barcelona ending this match frustrated even in victory.\n\nBarcelona vs Osasuna prop bet\n\nPick: Raphinha to score or assist a goal\n\nOdds: -130 (FanDuel)\n\nThe struggles of Robert Lewandowski in front of goal have been well publicised, but Ferran Torres is mired in a similar goal scoring slump. That leaves one Barcelona forward to carry much of the load in recent weeks â€” Raphinha.\n\nAfter the Brazilian was heavily criticized last season for his own struggles in the attacking third, he's been the most influential Barcelona forward over the past few months in both the creativity and finishing departments.\n\nRaphinha pulled assists in four straight league games through December, an impressive feat on a team sporting such poor finishing throughout, indicating Raphinha's propensity to create easily finished opportunities. He scored in the 3-2 win over Almeria in late December, and again in the past weekend's Copa del Rey victory. Raphinha is critical to this Barcelona side as they otherwise struggle in front of goal.\n\nLa Liga champions Barcelona will face off against Copa del Rey runners-up Osasuna in the second semi-final of the Spanish Super Cup at Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nBarcelona versus Osasuna Spanish Super Cup semi-final match will kick off at 2 pm (ET), on Thursday, January\n\nSpanish Super Cup semi-final match between Barcelona and Osasuna will be live telecast on ESPN 2 and ESPN+ The live streaming will be available on fuboTV. fuboTV offers free-trial.\n\nBarcelona is aiming to defend their Super Cup title after securing victory against Madrid in the previous year's final, marking their first triumph since the expansion of the event to four teams.
