Where to watch in Spain:

Until 2019 Spanish Supercup was played in August every year and was traditionally a two match encounter between the winners of the previous Spanish seasons league and cup called La Liga and the Copa del Rey.

The 2019-20 Supercopa de España will be the 36th edition of the Supercopa de España

In February 2019, it was announced that the competition format would be changed from a two-team format, to a four-team "final four" format which would include a semi-final round.

The first round will be two semi-finals which will be played on January 8th and 9th, 2020

The final will be January 12th 2020. There will not be a third-place game.

The four teams in the Spanish Super Cup - Supercopa de España 2019-20 are the finalists from the 2018–19 Copa del Rey match and the remaining highest ranked teams from the 2018–19 La Liga that had not already qualified through the cup final.

This means that in 2019-20 the 4 teams are Valencia, FC Barcelona. Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid

All three games will be in the same city in Saudi Arabia.

Former way Supercopa was organised

The Supercup winners are the Superchampions of Spain - supercampeones de España.

If the same team wins both titles - as FC Barcelona did in 2017/18 season - then the runners up of the Copa del Rey final play the Liga winners in the Supercopa de España final.

In 2018, for the first time ever, the Spanish Super Cup was not played in Spain but in Tangier, Morocco. Also in 2018, for the first time ever, the Spanish Super Cup was not played over two legs but in one final match.

It was also the first official game in a Spanish football competition in which video-arbitration technology ( VAR ) was used.

The Supercopa de España 2018 match kick off was at the Stade Ibn Batouta in Tangier on Sunday, 12 August at 21:00 BST - 10pm Spanish time
