        "text": "Three moments that changed Martin Lawrence's life\n\nThe American actor, humorist and producer looks back on his career for Brut.\n\nDo the Right Thing\n\nâIt was my first movie, so it was great to be in any movie! But this one was special because of its message. The message of âDo the Rightâ Thing is to do what is right. It's simple, it's all in the title. On a hot summer day, your spirits warm up and you have to stay patient and calm at all times.â\n\nâMy first meeting with Spike Lee was in California. He was considering a friend of mine, the tall and late Robin Harris. He was planning to cast him, but Robin Harris told him about me, and Spike auditioned me. Spike made a great movie. Working with Danny Aiello and Samuel L. Jackson and all these guys was great, a very good experience for me.â\n\nThe discovery of Richard Pryor\n\nâI stayed awake and listened to Richard Pryor's albums. I watched it on television: that's when I knew I wanted to become an actor. I figured that's how I was going to do it, doing what Richard Pryor was doing, doing stand-up. So, I started the stand-up, like Richard Pryor did.â\n\nAudition for Star Search\n\nâWhen I auditioned for âStar Searchâ, I was taken. I was able to join the show. I won once, and then I lost. But âStar Searchâ allowed me to be recognized as an actor, and then I had a streak. And that's how my film career started. I didn't know that this moment would change my life, but I was very enthusiastic and very happy with this opportunity that was offered to me. I wanted to get the best out of it, so I worked hard to capitalize on everything I did from that point on.\n\nThe Martin series\n\nâDid I know that âMartinâ would be a turning point in my career? At first, I didn't know it until the series aired. There I knew we had something. We had big audiences every week and the series was popular, people liked it and talked about it. That's when I knew we had something special. When people approach me on the street to ask me for photos and autographs, I love it, because without them, I would not be here. So, you know, you have to take the time and do as much as you can. You can't do everything but try to do as much as possible.â\n\nThe Bad Boys Trilogy\n\nâI don't know if it changed my lifeâ¦ But I'm better known, and I think more people know me thanks to âBad Boysâ. Itâs in this sense that it changed my life. I don't think I can tell you anything about Will Smith that you don't already know, because he tells you everything on his social networks!â\n\nBrut."
