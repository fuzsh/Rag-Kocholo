        "text": "Martin Lawrence is making his way back to the televised stage.\n\nThe renowned comedian has set his first stand-up special in 14 years, “Martin Lawrence Doin’ Time: Uncut,” which will air Friday, Sept. 9 at 9 p.m. on Showtime.\n\n“I look forward to having my third concert film premiere on Showtime. Fourteen years is a long time between concert specials and I am excited to know that my TV audience will be able to enjoy this show as if they came to see me live,” said Lawrence, who’s coming off of a sold-out national tour.\n\nThe Showtime special will feature Lawrence’s impressions and insights, covering everything from sex and relationships to President Obama, Bill Cosby and Hollywood.\n\nLawrence rose to fame in the 1990s with his self-titled Fox series “Martin,” and box office smashes including the “Bad Boys” and “Big Momma’s House” franchises.\n\nLawrence serves as an executive producer on his Showtime special, “Martin Lawrence Doin’ Time: Uncut,” which is directed by David Raynr. Other exec producers are Studio71’s Gary Binkow and Michael Green. Producers are Barry Ehrmann, Robert Lawrence, Rae Proctor, Sean Lampkin and Michael Hubbard of You So Crazy and Studio71."
