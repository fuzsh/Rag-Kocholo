        "text": "Martin Lawrence started doing comedy almost 30 years ago, and it didn't take all that long to establish a following for his raucous, irreverent humor.\n\nWithin five years of his debut at The Improv in New York and strong showing on \"Star Search,\" Lawrence had his own hit series, \"Martin.\" From 1992 to 1997, the Fox sitcom more than held its own against NBC's \"Must See TV\" lineup on Thursday nights.\n\nHe found success on the big screen, too, appearing in blockbusters such as \"Blue Streak,\" \"Big Momma's House\" and \"Bad Boys.\" Fans have been asking Lawrence and co-star Will Smith about a third installment ever since \"Bad Boys II\" scored at the box office in 2003. (The latest: A screenplay is in the works, and there could be a \"Bad Boys III\" in 2018.)\n\nLawrence, now 51, took a four-year break from standup comedy before going back on the road again last fall with his Doin' Time tour.\n\nHis performance at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles resulted in the Showtime special \"Doin' Time: Uncut,\" which premiered in September and has just come out on DVD. It's his first comedy special in 14 years.\n\nYou can see Lawrence live in Jacksonville on Friday when he brings his act to the Times-Union Center. He talked about comedy, touring and his lengthy break from standup in a recent telephone interview from Los Angeles.\n\nWhy so long between comedy specials?\n\nBecause it's not that easy to get material, new material all of a sudden. It takes time to build material. After you've done one concert, to go on to the next concert you have to have time in between. So it just took some time.\n\nIt's not like you haven't been doing other things and staying busy in the meantime.\n\nYeah, exactly - television and movies and raising a family.\n\nYou started touring again after a four-year break. Did you stay off the stage completely during that time?\n\nI hadn't been on stage in four years. When I came back is when I started for the Doin' Time tour - doing more shows and going to smoke-filled comedy clubs.\n\nYou hear a lot of comedians talk about how tough life can be on the road.\n\nYeah, it can be. It can be draining, and tiresome, and everything else.\n\nSo is the reward when they laugh, and let you know they're glad you're there?\n\nExactly. That's the reward, them coming out, showing you love and energy and just laughing, and saying, \"Hey, you delivered us a good show.\" That's the reward.\n\nA lot of actors who do standup say they have to keep that skill set working, and will go back to doing live shows periodically. Did you find it was fairly easy to go back to standup?\n\nI don't like to call it easy, because standup is not easy by no means. But I think it might have come a little easier to me to get back on stage because of my experience.\n\nWhat's behind the title, \"Doin' Time\"?\n\nThat's just a metaphor. It's just me doing time, working out, putting in work.\n\nYou'll play Augusta, Ga., the day after you're in Jacksonville, and two weeks later you'll be in Canada. Do you feel the need to adjust your material, based on where you are?\n\nSometimes, but I would hope I don't have to. I hope that it reaches everywhere, that it translates everywhere, so that I don't have to adjust anything.\n\nYour appearance on Big Boy's radio show is on YouTube. You come across as kind of quiet and modest. How do you transform yourself into the guy we see on stage?\n\nWell, it's confidence. It's what I do, when I transition on stage, I turn into that guy. The ego, the rock star, the whole thing - that's the image. But when I'm offstage, I don't feel like I have to prove something all the time, to be funny. I'm not joking 24/7.\n\nDo you have an \"on\" switch, where you take on that persona between the time you leave the dressing room and walk onto the stage, or is it a lengthier process?\n\nIt's an all-day process, and I do get in the right frame of mind. But I have been blessed to be able to go and when I need to turn it on, I turn it on.\n\nYour stand-up material is not G-rated. It's not PG-rated. Do you allow your daughters to see your shows?\n\nMy oldest girl. She'll be 21. Yeah, so she's come to my show.\n\nWhat has she said to you about it?\n\nShe loves it. She thinks it's funny, and she realizes it's language and everything, but she doesn't have too much to say because it puts her through college.\n\nWhat do it is about the \"Bad Boy\" movies that has created such a devoted following? The demand by fans for another film hasn't seemed to have lost any momentum after all this time?\n\nI just think because they're great films. They're well put-together, and well-written, well-cast, and they just had all the elements, all the ingredients you need to make a good film.\n\n\"Uncut\" was directed by David Raynr. You guys go way back. He directed you in your 2002 comedy special, \"Runteldat.\" What makes you such a good team?\n\nHe respects me, I respect him. And he knows my show, he knows where I'm coming from. He knows me as a person. I know him as a person, as a director. And because we just have good chemistry. We work well together.\n\nDo you ever get to keep the clothes your wear in your movies?\n\nUh, no. [He laughs.] I used to, but no.\n\nThat question was just a way to get around to asking you how many \"Big Momma\" dresses you have in your closet?\n\nNone!\n\nDavid Crumpler: (904) 359-4164"
