        "text": "Y'all Know What It Is! Tour\n\nMartin Lawrence, the original Bad Boy of comedy, is gearing up for the release of his long-awaited sequel 'Bad Boys: Ride or Die' with Will Smith, set for general release in summer 2024. But the actor/comedian/singer isn't resting on his laurels until that happy day, as he's hitting the road this year for the 'Y'all Know What It Is! Tour,' his first tour in 8 years. Outspoken on subjects such as relationships, family, and vocal opposition to police brutality, Lawrence's raw style shows no sign of mellowing as we head into the new year. Be warned - this comic takes no prisoners at his shows!\n\nActor/comedian Martin started the 21st century off with a bang, starring and executive producing Big Momma's House, the story of an FBI agent posing as a corpulent Southern matriarch, which went on to gross more than 100 million dollars, despite universally negative reviews. The success of this film pushed Lawrence ever closer to joining the much-coveted $20 million club, cementing his reputation as one of the biggest comic stars for years to come."
