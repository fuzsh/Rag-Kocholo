        "text": "Background\n\nMartin Lawrence is the fourth of six children and was born in Frankfurt, Germany on April 16, 1965. His parents divorced when he was just eight years old and Lawrence rarely saw his father, John Lawrence, who worked as a police officer. His mother, Chlora (whose given name is Bailey), had to work several jobs to support her family.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Lawrence excelled a lot in boxing. At that time, he lived in Queens, New York, and Landover, Maryland. He attended the Thomas G. Pullen School of Creative and Performing Arts, Fairmont Heights High School, and Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Fort Washington, Maryland, where he won the Golden Gloves in boxing. He was serious about pursuing a professional career in the ring until he had an accident, which caused him to reconsider.\n\nLawrence then moved to New York, where he went on to star in “The Improv.” After that, he was on “Star Search” and did well on the show. While Lawrence made it to the final round, he didn’t win the contest. However, Columbia Pictures Television executives saw Lawrence’s performance and offered him the role of Maurice in the television series “What’s Happening Now!!” Some of the popular movies in which he acted were “Bad Boys” and the “Big Momma’s House” trilogy."
