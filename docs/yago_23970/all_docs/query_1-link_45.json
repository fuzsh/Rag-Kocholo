        "text": "Back by popular demand, comedian, actor, director and producer Martin Lawrence has added 19 more dates to the LIT AF Tour. Lawrence stars as the high-powered host of 2018's hottest comedy event, presenting a fire lineup of comedians including DeRay Davis, Rickey Smiley, Michael Blackson, and Benji Brown. Coming off the 20th anniversary of Def Comedy Jam, where he is known for his legendary hosting, Lawrence has made a triumphant return to the stand-up stage wowing audiences with his signature style of hilarious stories, social commentary and more.\n\n“Being on the road with this group of funny AF comedians is a blast,” says Lawrence. “No two shows are the same and we all bring something different to the party.”\n\nMartin Lawrence started in stand-up comedy at the legendary The Improv, where he honed his talents until he was asked by Russell Simmons to host his groundbreaking comedy series \"Def Comedy Jam\" on HBO. From there, Lawrence became a household name after his hugely popular self-titled TV show, \"Martin,\" was an instant hit with TV viewers. He starred for five years as not only the title character, but other support characters like the sassy Sheneneh and Mama Payne, who became comedy classics. Lawrence would later go on to star in comedy blockbusters like \"Bad Boys\" 1&2, \"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate,\" which he also directed, and \"Big Momma’s House,\" 1, 2 & 3, where he once again proved his talent for creating and acting as multiple characters in one storyline.\n\nFor more information, visit MartinLawrence.AEGpresents.com\n\n*Lineup subject to change"
