        "text": "Exclusive: Charlie Sheen Pursues a Return to Two and a Half Men\n\nAs Anger Management nears the end of its 100-episode order, Charlie Sheen is bracing for what may be the FX sitcom's wrap. Simultaneously, his previous series, Two and a Half Men, is also about to end &mdash; and Sheen would like to be a part of that send-off. Sheen tells TV Guide Magazine that he has approached Two and a Half Men with an idea about how he could make a return to the sitcom. \"I've reached out to them and they've reached back,\" he says. \"We're trying to figure out what makes the most sense.
