        "text": "Comedy legend Martin Lawrence announced he will headline a national arena tour – his first comedy tour since 2016 – kicking off Saturday, July 20th. The “Y’all Know What It Is!” tour will head to nearly 40 cities across the U.S. through April 2025, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Vegas, Dallas, Brooklyn, and Washington, D.C. The tour is set to launch soon after the June 7th release of the highly anticipated Bad Boys: Ride or Die feature film, co-starring Will Smith. Tickets go on sale Friday, May 17th at 10 am local time. To purchase tickets, visit this link.\n\n“Y’all Know What It Is!” is an all-new stand-up show and fresh one-hour set where Martin brings the real talk and finds the funny in everything from family to culture as only he can. Special guests have been personally handpicked by the comedy maestro. They are some of the hottest comedians on the mic, including Adele Givens, B. Simone, Chico Bean, DC Youngfly, Deon Cole, Desi Banks, Gary Owen, Jess Hilarious, Mojo Brookzz, Ms. Pat, Rickey Smiley, and more. Guest comedians vary by city.\n\nCommenting on the tour, Lawrence says:\n\n“Comedy gives me that instant gratification. Seeing the fans up close and in person, making people laugh, doing what I love most, this is what it’s all about for me. But hey… y’all know what it is!”\n\nLawrence, hailed by fans worldwide as one of the greatest comics of all time launched his comedy career in New York City at the Improv Comedy Club. His breakthrough film role came from Spike Lee in the classic Do The Right Thing! Other film roles followed, including House Party and Boomerang.\n\nHe soon captured the attention of mega producer Russell Simmons, who tapped Lawrence to host the groundbreaking HBO series Def Comedy Jam. In 1992, Lawrence landed his hit series, Martin. The ratings juggernaut single-handedly elevated FOX to a major contender against network television stations. Following the finale of his self-titled comedy series, Lawrence starred in a string of top-grossing films, including Life, Big Momma’s House, and the Bad Boys franchise.\n\nTour Dates:\n\n07/20 – Chandler, AZ, Gila River Casino\n\n08/02 – Pittsburgh, PA, PPG Paints Arena\n\n08/03 – Cleveland, OH, Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse\n\n08/09 – Jackson, MS, Mississippi Coliseum\n\n08/10 – Biloxi, MS, Mississippi Coast Coliseum\n\n08/17 – Highland, CA, Yaamava’ Resort & Casino\n\n08/30 – Detroit, MI, Little Caesars Arena\n\n08/31 – Grand Rapids, MI, Van Andel Arena\n\n09/06 – Raleigh, NC, PNC Arena\n\n09/07 – Columbia, SC, Colonial Life Arena\n\n09/20 – Louisville, KY KFC Yum!
