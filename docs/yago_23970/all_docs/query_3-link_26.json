        "text": "Martin Lawrence is the latest star to receive a star. The actor received the 2,753rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at an event on Hollywood Boulevard featuring guest speakers Steve Harvey and Lynn Whitfield. Lawrence, a comedian best known for the TV show Martin, truly paved the way for other shows and comedians in the ’90s.\n\nAna Martinez, Producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, shared about Lawrence, “Martin Lawrence has been a staple in pop culture for more than 30 years. This comedic genius has made many of us laugh for decades and he will continue to do so with his creative television and film moments.” Lawrence began his career in Washington D.C., doing comedy shows, and later moved to New York City to perform at the Improv Theatre.\n\nMartin Lawrence gets a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nHe soon won a performance spot on Star Search, which launched his career as an actor as he got discovered by executives at Columbia Pictures TV. He was offered the role of Maurice Warfield in What’s Happening Now!! After beginning to act, he was selected as a host on the HBO series Def Comedy Jam. This led to his own show called Martin on FOX. The show, which ran from 1992 to 1997 was a smash hit.\n\nAfter Martin ended, he began appearing in comedy films including Nothing to Lose, Blue Streak, Big Momma’s House, and National Security. More recently, he reprised his role as Detective Marcus Burnett in the third installment of the Bad Boys franchise, Bad Boys for Life. When he is not making movies, he often goes on tour with his hilarious comedy shows.\n\nNot only is Lawrence an impressive actor, but he donates to many charities including In School of Los Angeles, Providence Trinitycare Foundation, and Stand Up 2 Cancer. Everything combined led to Lawrence receiving the highly-coveted star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During the ceremony, Lawrence also gave an update on his friend and fellow actor Jamie Foxx. Foxx was hospitalized after suffering from an undisclosed “medical complication.”\n\nLawrence said, “I hear [Foxx] is doing better… My prayers go out for him every night, and just wishing the best for him, one of the best that we got in Hollywood. Not only one of the best entertainers but a good person.”\n\nWhat is your favorite film or television show starring Martin Lawrence?"
