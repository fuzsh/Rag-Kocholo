        "text": "Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence[2] (born April 16, 1965) is an American actor, film director, film\n\nproducer, screenwriter, and comedian. He came to fame during the 1990s, establishing aHollywood career as a leading actor, most notably the films Bad Boys and Bad Boys II. Lawrence has acted in numerous movie roles and starred in his own television series, Martin, which ran from 1992 to 1997 on Fox.\n\nLawrence was originally attatched to play Damon Henderson , the Green Galaxy Ranger, in the 2013 Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy (film) reboot but that reboot was cancelled and instead as another Green Galaxy Ranger Browne Jones in Power Rangers LG: Galactic Underground .\n\nEarly life[]\n\nLawrence was born Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany on April 16, 1965 to American parents. He was given his first name after civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and his middle name after U.S. President John F. Kennedy.[2] His father, John Lawrence, served in the U.S. Military.[2] After his parents divorced when he was eight,[3]Lawrence rarely saw his father, who worked as a police officer at the time.[4] His mother, Chlora (née Bailey), began working several jobs to support her family.[5][6] During his teen years, Lawrence excelled at boxing.[2] He lived in Maryland, and attended Thomas G. Pullen School of Creative and Performing Arts (Landover, Maryland), Fairmont Heights High School (Fairmount Heights, Maryland), Eleanor Roosevelt High School,[2] and also Friendly High School in Fort Washington, Maryland, becoming a Mid-Atlantic Golden Gloves boxing contender.\n\n[edit]Career[]\n\nLawrence moved to Los Angeles and found his way to the legendary Kings Wood comedy club. Shortly after appearing at the Wood, he won a performance spot on Star Search, a popular show in the United States.[2] He did well on the show and made it to the final round before ultimately losing. However, executives at Columbia TriStar Television saw Martin's performance and offered him the role of \"Maurice\" on the television sitcom What's Happening Now!!; this was his first acting job.[2] Upon cancellation of that show, Lawrence found bit parts in various films and television roles. His breakthrough role was as Cee in the Spike Lee film Do the Right Thing. Other roles followed in films such as the House Party series and the Eddie Murphy vehicleBoomerang. During this period, entertainment mogul Russell Simmons selected him to host the groundbreaking series Def Comedy Jam on HBO. Def Comedy Jam gave many comedians (including Chris Tucker, Dave Chappelle, Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer) mainstream exposure.\n\nDuring his stint with Def Comedy Jam, Lawrence appeared in his own hit series, Martin, which aired on Fox TV.[2] The show ran from 1992 to 1997 and was an enormous success. \"Martin\" was the flagship of Fox's Thursday-night line-up, which drew millions of viewers away from NBC's \"Must See TV\" line-up. He hosted Saturday Night Live on February 19, 1994, where he made crude remarks about women's genitaliaand personal hygiene; the monologue was completely edited out of NBC reruns and syndicated versions, and Lawrence was banned from the show for life. \"Martin\"'s ratings continued to skyrocket so much that Fox became more of a contender against NBC and came closer to being considered among the top television networks.\n\nLawrence's Martin co-star, Tisha Campbell-Martin, filed a lawsuit against Lawrence and the show's producers for sexual harassment and verbal and physical assaults. HBO Studios settled the lawsuit so the show's final season could be completed. Campbell-Martin agreed to complete the season on the condition that she not appear in any scenes in the last two episodes with Lawrence.[7] No criminal charges were ever filed and the accusations were never brought to court.\n\nAfter Martin ended its run, Lawrence found ample work in comedy films. He often starred as the second lead opposite actors including Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, and Tim Robbins.[2] Many of his films were blockbusters at the box office, including Boomerang (1992), (also with him again in \"Life\") Bad Boys (1995), Blue Streak (1999), Big Momma's House (2000) and Bad Boys 2 (2003). He also starred in critical and box office failures including Black Knight (2001) and National Security (2002). Regardless, his salary steadily increased to over $10 million per film role. He continues to work in film, with such films as Big Momma's House 2, which opened #1 at the North American box office and grossed almost $28 million its first weekend,[8] and Wild Hogs (2007), in which he plays a bored suburbanite seeking adventure on the open road in a biker comedy alongside John Travolta, Tim Allen and William H. Macy.\n\nIn 2006, Lawrence appeared on Inside the Actors Studio, during which Lawrence briefly brought back to life some of the characters he'd portrayed on Martin.\n\nIn 2008, Lawrence starred in Disney's College Road Trip co-starring with Raven Symone. This particular film was his first G-rated film. Even though it was his first film to be G-rated, it is not his first time appearing in a children's film. He previously starred in Rebound (2005), as well as a voiceover role in Open Season (2006) opposite Ashton Kutcher.\n\nAt the 2009 BET Awards he appeared in a spoof movie trailer with Jamie Foxx for a fictitious movie titled The Skank Robbers that featured, respectively, their TV characters Sheneneh Jenkins and Ugly Wanda. in 2010, Fox announced that it was producing a film based on the sketch, featuring Foxx, Lawrence, and actress Halle Berry.[9]\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Lawrence would reprise his role as FBI Agent Malcolm Turner in Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son, the third film in the Big Momma's House series, which was released in 2011.[10]\n\n[edit]Personal life[]\n\nIn the mid-1990s, during the filming of A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, Lawrence lashed out in a violent outburst on the set. He became increasingly erratic and was arrested after he reportedly brandished a pistol and screamed at tourists on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles.[2]He was also arrested at Burbank Airport for carrying a loaded gun in his suitcase. In March 1997, Lawrence was arrested again after assaulting a man in a Hollywood nightclub.[2]\n\nDuring August 1999, Lawrence slipped into a three-day coma after collapsing from heat exhaustion while jogging in 100-degree heat while wearing several layers of heavy clothing.[2] He recovered in the hospital after nearly dying from a body temperature of 107 °F (41.7 °C), his breathing assisted by a respirator.\n\nOn July 10, 2010, Lawrence married longtime girlfriend Shamicka Gibbs at Lawrence's Beverly Hills home. The couple's daughters, Lyana and Ameria (then aged 9 and 7), served as flower girls. Actors Eddie Murphy and Denzel Washington were among the 120 wedding guests;[11] Shanice serenaded the couple by singing the Minnie Riperton classic Lovin' You.[12]\n\n[edit]Filmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Note 1989 Do The Right Thing Cee 1990 House Party Bilal 1991 Talkin' Dirty After Dark Terry 1991 House Party 2 Bilal 1992 Boomerang Tyler 1994 You So Crazy Himself Stand-up acting\n\nExecutive producer and writer\n\n1995 Bad Boys Marcus Burnett 1996 A Thin Line Between Love and Hate Narrator/Darnell 'Deeny/'D'/D.W.'
