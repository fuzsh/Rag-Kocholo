Whitfield was the female lead in \"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\" and guest-starred in two episodes of \"Martin.\"\n\nThe star is the 2,753rd star since the completion of the Walk of Fame in 1961 with the initial 1,558 stars.\n\nBorn April 16, 1965, in Frankfurt, West Germany when his father was serving in the U.S. Army, Lawrence was raised in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Landover, Maryland.\n\nLawrence's comedy career began in clubs in the Washington area. Performances in New York City led to a spot on \"Star Search,\" where he impressed Columbia Pictures Television executives, leading to his first acting job, joining the cast of the syndicated comedy \"What's Happening Now!!\" in 1987 for its third and final season.\n\nLawrence's breakthrough role came in his film debut, the 1989 Spike Lee-directed comedy-drama \"Do The Right Thing,\" playing Cee, a teen from the neighborhood who talks with a lisp.\n\nLawrence then appeared in the 1990 film comedy \"House Party\" and its 1991 sequel \"House Party 2,\" the 1991 comedy \"Talkin' Dirty After Dark,\" the 1992 Eddie Murphy-starring comedy \"Boomerang,\" and hosted the groundbreaking HBO comedy series, \"Def Comedy Jam.\"\n\nLawrence's other film credits include \"Nothing to Lose,\" \"Life,\" \"Blue Streak,\" \"Big Momma's House,\" \"Black Knight\" and \"National Security.\""
