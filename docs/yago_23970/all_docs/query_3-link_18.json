It was his first major film and stand-up act. Lawrence wears a black, leather suit in the film similar to the wardrobe worn by Eddie Murphy in his films Delirious and Raw.\n\nDuring the routine, Lawrence comments on various topics such as his success, growing up, sexual acts and racism. The concert was filmed at the Majestic Theatre in 1993 in New York City before a sold-out crowd. Martin followed You So Crazy up with Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat in 2002.\n\nYou So Crazy helped Lawrence breakout during the early 1990s. The film went on to become a success for Lawrence, generating over $10 million at the box office. The film also gained popularity thanks to late night airings on HBO and Cinemax.\n\nThe film originally received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, causing Miramax (the film's original distributor) to sell it to Samuel Goldwyn, which released it unrated.[2]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 50% based on reviews from 10 critics.[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
