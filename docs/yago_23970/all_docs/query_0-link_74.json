        "text": "Martin Lawrence is not running quite like he used to, but he’s feeling just fine.\n\nThe comedian and actor pulled a muscle shooting a footrace with Will Smith in their new movie, “Bad Boys for Life,” the third in a hit buddy-cop franchise that was birthed 25 years ago. This installment, not surprisingly, has a number of jokes about its leads getting older.

And so it just was a time for me to take to myself, spiritually, and reconnect and just get through.\n\nThe idea of making another “Bad Boys” sequel had been under consideration for a while. What ultimately brought you back?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
