        "text": "Martin Lawrence started in stand-up comedy at the legendary The Improv, where he honed his talents until he was asked by Russell Simmons to host his groundbreaking comedy series Def Comedy Jam on HBO. From there, Lawrence became a household name after his hugely popular self-titled TV show, Martin, was an instant hit with TV viewers. He starred for five years as not only the title character, but other support characters like the sassy Sheneneh and Mama Payne, who became comedy classics. Lawrence would later go on to star in comedy blockbusters like Bad Boys alongside Will Smith, A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, which he also directed and Big Mommaâ€™s House, where he once again proved his talent for creating and acting as multiple characters in one storyline. Lawrence currently is busy interacting with fans on his new Runteldat app, an interactive, subscription-based app that gives fans access to live streams, exclusive videos and photos, and even personal messages or texts from Martin himself."
