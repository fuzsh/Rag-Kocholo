        "text": "Although he got his start as a stand-up comedian, Martin Lawrence found his greatest fame as an actor, and in recent years, much to the disappointment of his stand-up fans, he hasn’t spent as much time onstage as he has in front of the camera. So his new Doin’ Time tour is the first chance fans have had to see Lawrence live since 2011, and with big film projects like the third Bad Boys movie on the horizon for the star, it may also be the last chance for a while.\n\nAfter stints on Star Search and Def Comedy Jam and supporting movie and TV roles, Lawrence became a huge star thanks to his Fox sitcom Martin in the 1990s, and the two Bad Boys action movies he co-starred in (alongside Will Smith) for director Michael Bay in 1995 and 2003. His stand-up concert films You So Crazy and Runteldat established him as a top comedian with his high-energy style, and he’s continued to work as an actor (in movies like the Big Momma’s House series) and a comedian since then. For people who’ve only watched Lawrence on TV or in movies, this is their chance to see him completely unfiltered, doing what he’s done best since those early days: making people laugh."
