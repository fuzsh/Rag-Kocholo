        "text": "It's pretty well accepted that Richard Pryor is one of the pillars of modern comedy. Those who have followed in his path generally fall into one of two categories:\n\nGuys who took his \"white people do things like this...black people do things like THIS\" schtick at face value, and guys who looked deeper into it to see the clever social commentary embedded in his jokes. Martin Lawrence, oddly enough, is somewhere between the two, and nowhere is this more evident, than with his 1993 concert film, You So Crazy.\n\nThe Movie\n\nIn the 80¿s and early 90¿s, standup comedians had become mainstream enough to the point where it was feasible for the best of them to do theatrical full-length films of their standup routine, which typically could only be viewed live or in an HBO special. Unfortunately, the quality of most of these efforts was a mixed bag veering from the superlative Delirious, by Eddie Murphy, to the mundane Dice Rules, a lame effort from Andrew Dice Clay.\n\nMartin Lawrence¿s You So Crazy came in at the tail end of this era and at a time where Martin was at the top of his game, so to speak. He had his hit self-titled TV show on Fox, a hosting gig on HBO¿s Def Comedy Jam, and a hit comedy album (Talkin¿ Sh*t) to boot. The film had a scandalous buzz building before it was even released, Samuel Goldwyn had decide to release it unrated due to the extremely explicit material that was to be featured. Tongues wagged, and even though the movie would only have a limited release, it seemed destined to be a classic. Then, it was actually released, and never before has a man, to paraphrase the James Brown slogan, talked so loud while saying absolutely nothing.\n\nLawrence is actually a very insightful and capable comedian, but if you were trying to convince someone of that, this film would be poor evidence. For the length of the film, Lawrence seems unfocused and unsure, veering from half-done joke to half-done joke. One segment, wherein he rants about how differently women react when they say they will leave a man who has a nice house than when they say they¿ll leave a man who lives like a slob, has a setup that goes on for a while only to sputter out with a quick and lethargic punchline. And then it¿s off to the next joke. Even when Lawrence really connects with the audience on a few good jokes, he just keeps rambling from topic to topic, seldom giving the audience time to really get into the flow.\n\nAs for the subject matter, while he does the obligatory ¿white people/black people¿ slant on topics like relationships, family, and racism, Lawrence occasionally gives a little depth and heart to his material. But those moments are far outnumbered by the occasions where he shamelessly mugs or keeps riding a barely funny joke until its annoying. As such, you¿ll find yourself wincing more than laughing over the course of the 85 minute film. Anyone who's seen his standup on Def Comedy Jam or some of his better movies (Bad Boys, Boomerang) knows Lawrence can see be so much funnier, and it¿s a mystery why this standup film, his one and only, isn¿t representative of that.\n\n5 out of 10\n\nThe Picture\n\nEven for a older transfer from a visually mundane film, the picture quality seems below average. Grain is noticeable at all times, and having seen how decent it looks on digital cable, I was very disappointed in the lifelessness in the color composition. The last thing you need when watching a dull film is a dull picture to accompany it.\n\n4 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nDone in decent Dolby Surround, you at least get a feeling that the audience is actually there. However, they seem rather distant and subdued, and no amount of pumping up the volume really helps. Lawrence comes through crystal clear on the center channel, but his audio is similarly subdued.\n\n6 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nYeah, right. Like so many DVDs based on older material that isn¿t especially popular, this one is barebones. Aside from a perfunctory text ¿biography¿ and a trailer, you won't find much else here. But why would you want to watch more about this movie anyway?\n\n2 out of 10\n\nTOTAL: 3 out of 10\n\nCatch it on cable."
