Coming off the 20th anniversary of Def Comedy Jam, where he is known for his legendary hosting, Lawrence has made a triumphant return to the stand-up stage wowing audiences with his signature style of hilarious stories, social commentary and more. The LIT AF Tour stars Lawrence as your high-powered host who presents a fire lineup of comedians including Rickey Smiley, Jay Pharoah, Bruce Bruce, and Adele Givens.\n\nMartin Lawrence started in stand-up comedy at the legendary The Improv, where he honed his talents until he was asked by Russell Simmons to host his groundbreaking comedy series Def Comedy Jam on HBO. From there, Lawrence became a household name after his hugely popular self-titled TV show, Martin, was an instant hit with TV viewers. He starred for five years as not only the title character, but other support characters like the sassy Sheneneh and Mama Payne, who became comedy classics. Lawrence would later go on to star in comedy blockbusters like Bad Boys 1&2 A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, which he also directed and Big Mommaâ€™s House, 1, 2 & 3 where he once again proved his talent for creating and acting as multiple characters in one storyline."
