        "text": "Martin Lawrence has announced his first comedy tour in eight years, including a show in Alabama. The famed comedian and actor, 59, is set to appear in Birmingham on Jan. 18, 2025, at the Legacy Arena at the BJCC, with Rickey Smiley as the opening act. Loni Love and Benji Brown are on the bill, as well, according to the BJCC.\n\nTickets for the 8 p.m. show go on sale on Friday, May 17, via Ticketmaster. Prices haven’t been announced. Pre-sales start on Tuesday, May 14, at 10 a.m. CT, and end on Thursday, May 16, at 10 p.m., according to the Ticketmaster site.\n\nMore than 35 dates were confirmed on Wednesday for Lawrence’s “Y’all Know What It Is!” tour, which runs from July 20 through April 5, 2025. Birmingham is the only Alabama stop on the tour right now, but Lawrence is set to appear in Southern cities such as Jackson, Mississippi (Aug. 9, Mississippi Coliseum); Biloxi, Mississippi (Aug. 10, Mississippi Coast Coliseum); Nashville (Jan. 19, Bridgestone Arena); Atlanta (March 7, State Farm Arena); and Savannah, Georgia (March 8, Enmarket Arena).\n\nSee the full tour schedule here.\n\n“Comedy gives me that instant gratification,” Lawrence said via a press release. “Seeing the fans up close and in person, making people laugh, doing what I love most, this is what it’s all about for me.”\n\nThe release promises fans “an all-new stand-up show and fresh one-hour set where Martin brings the real talk and finds the funny in everything from family to culture as only he can. Special guests have been personally hand-picked by the comedy maestro and are some of the hottest comedians on the mic, including Rickey Smiley, Loni Love and Benji Brown.”\n\nLawrence, who starred in the popular sitcom “Martin” in the ‘90s, has a long list of TV and movie credits, including “Do the Right Thing,” “Boomerang,” “Blue Streak” and the film franchises for “House Party,” “Bad Boys” and “Big Momma’s House.” His new tour is linked to the June release of the next installment in the “Bad Boys” saga: “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” also starring Will Smith.\n\nLawrence, who started his career in stand-up comedy, has continued to work in that arena, performing on tour and appearing in specials. He hosted HBO’s Def Comedy Jam for six seasons in the ‘90s and made a splash in the 1994 stand-up film “You So Crazy.”\n\nLawrence has earned a BET Comedy Award, two NAACP Image Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has 19 million followers on Facebook, nearly 10 million followers on Instagram and 4.2 million followers on TikTok.\n\nLawrence has made appearances in Birmingham before, headlining a show at the BJCC Concert Hall in June 2011. Lawrence also has hosted the “LIT AF Tour” at the BJCC in the past, with acts such as Smiley and Jay Pharoah on the bill."
