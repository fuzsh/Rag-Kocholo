        "text": "I didn't know what to expect when first watching this, and was at first surprised at it wasn't just a compilation of comedy sketches. In fact, this movie was way more than I expected. Extremely interesting. it was even more interesting to learn about Lambchop, as I had watched that in my youth. I thought that part of the documentary was really great. The art of ventriloquism is extremely beautiful and misunderstood, i wish more people would see this movie so that they could really appreciate ventriloquism. I know a lot of Jeff Dunham fans were disappointed in this film because they thought he would be more involved with it, but I thought it was wonderful nonetheless. Not what I expected, but better. For such a mainstream comedian like Jeff Dunham, his art is very underrated and unnoticed. I think once people watch this DVD they will feel more familiar with ventriloquism and it will bring light to many ventriloquists and their talent. Ventriloquism will still be a mystery to all of us that don't know how to do it, but this film makes it very interesting to learn about those who can."
