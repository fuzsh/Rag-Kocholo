Here's some of the “official” ad copy: “Whimsical and insightful, this film examines the fun and entertaining world of ventriloquist comics including two-time Comedian of the Year Jeff Dunham, Tony Award-winner Jay Johnson ( 'Soap' ) and cruise and college entertainer Lynn Trefzger. Full of hilarious stand-up routines, 'I'm No Dummy" shows audiences that ventriloquism is not just a novelty act but a world-renowned art form enjoyed by people of all walks of life.”

But it's so much more than just the above. You'll see vintage film clips of the legendary vents of yesteryear. You'll see up-and-coming vents...the stars of tomorrow. You'll even see a bit of the fantastic Vent Haven Museum! And you'll learn lots of fascinating, little-known facts about vents and ventriloquism. How can you lose?

Several years in the making, this is “the little documentary that could.” We had wonderful showings at several film festivals where it was always extremely well-received.
