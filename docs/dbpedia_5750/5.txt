Description

HEY I'M TALKIN' HERE tells the fascinating story behind the making of the comedy documentary, I'm No Dummy, which stars Jeff Dunham, Jay Johnson, and Lynn Trefgzer, and is the first feature film examining the art of ventriloquism. Making movies is extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. While pulling back the curtain on how this particular film was made, the book also provides many illuminating insights about filmmaking in general.
