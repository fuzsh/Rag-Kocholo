Kudos to SIFF (Seattle International Film Festival) for programming the World Premiere of I'm No Dummy. I'm sure there are those that would say "Why a doc on ventriloquism?" I say, "Why did it take so long?" This smart, insightful and very funny documentary is carefully crafted to allow us to discover there is so much more to this misunderstood art and those that practice it. Tony Award winner and star of TV sitcom Soap, Jay Johnson steals the film with his intellectual comedy and flawless technique. Lynn Trefzger and her family friendly puppets are just delightful and Comedy Central star Jeff Dunham believe it or not fills huge auditoriums. Building on the work of those before them, such as Jimmy Nelson, Senor Wences and Paul Winchell, these modern "vents" have reinvented and reinvigorated this much maligned act. As an avid doc watcher it was refreshing to see an intelligent and fun documentary that had real depth. A wonderful doc where the "vents" vent about their work.
