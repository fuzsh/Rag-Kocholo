        "text": "(IDG) -- Lucent Technologies is about to get the entree it needs into the networks of new carriers and Internet service providers.\n\nThe company has announced it will merge with Ascend Communications in a $20 billion deal that will fill some gaps in its product line and bring it customers outside the traditional voice carriers.\n\nWith competitive service providers trending toward data-switch backbones, Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent had to acquire a stronger data product line and a stable of customers among new providers, according to Matt Barzowskas, vice president of First Albany Corp., an investment firm in Boston.\n\nAscend provides both. With its core ATM switches, hybrid frame relay-ATM switches, and access concentrators, Ascend has found its way into the networks of major Internet service providers, data service providers and regional Bell operating companies.\n\n\"Lucent just had a really big hole in its product line,\" says Liza Hendersen, director of consulting for TeleChoice, a Boston-based consultancy. \"Its (Globeview 2000 switch) was simply too big for carriers to deploy.\"\n\nMORE COMPUTING INTELLIGENCE IDG.net home page Network World Fusion home page Free registration required to access Network World Free Network World Fusion newsletters Get Media Grok and The Industry Standard Intelligencer delivered for free Reviews & in-depth info at IDG.net IDG.net's bridges & routers page IDG.net's hubs & switches page IDG.net's network operating systems page IDG.net's network management software page IDG.net's personal news page Questions about computers?

The SS7 Gateway translates back and forth between the signaling system for voice circuit switches and frame relay and ATM addressing.\n\nAscend also brings key service-provisioning capabilities with its Navis management software.\n\nCombined with Lucent's strong dense wave division multiplexing technology, the merger gives Lucent an imposing collection of high-speed backbone technology, says John Morency, vice president of network solutions for Renaissance Worldwide in Newton, Mass.\n\nAscend's Professional Services group also brings network integration, operations, engineering and marketing skills to carrier customers and is stronger than the similar group within Lucent, Hendersen says.\n\nThe deal puts Lucent on better footing to compete against the two other major networking giants, Nortel and Cisco. Lucent's deal with Ascend mirrors last year's purchase of Bay Networks by Nortel, which gave Nortel needed data networking expertise and customers to add to its voice-carrier portfolio.\n\nCisco lacks pure voice switching but that technology is not necessary, Barzowskas says. Most new purchases by carriers will be of data gear, which Cisco already offers. Cisco's challenge is to expand further into carrier networks, he says.\n\nLucent will have to integrate its product lines and solve technical problems such as developing a common management platform, Morency says. Ascend's MAX TNT access concentrators overlap with Lucent's Portmaster line and one will have to be weeded out, he says.\n\nLucent now faces the challenge of merging the two companies. Ascend is based in Alameda, Calif., so Lucent will have to deal with a bicoastal merge.\n\nThat period of integration will open a window for competitors to make inroads because mergers unavoidably absorb the attention of top management, Barzowskas says.\n\nLucent paid premium price for Ascend, according to Barzowskas. The $20 billion stock swap is about 18% higher than Ascend's market capitalization. The deal is expected to close about mid-1999.\n\nTim Greene is a senior editor at Network World.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nNetworking trends emerge for '99 - January 6, 1999\n\nAT&T Labs cooks up voice-data mix - December 21, 1998\n\nIP telephony is the \"in\" thing these days, but should it be? - October 19, 1998\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nPakistan begins troop withdrawal from Indian border\n\nWhite-collar workers in Jakarta join anti-Habibie chorus\n\nVeteran politicians hand over EU reform blueprint\n\nKlan rally in New York fizzles under counterprotests\n\nFalwell hosts summit with gay minister\n\nCritics assail plan to give women addicts money to use birth control\n\nChemical that could power microbes is found at Jupiter moon\n\nTexas downs No. 3 Huskers, continues hex\n\nIllinois stuns No. 9 Michigan 35-29\n\nAgilent plans $1.1 B IPO\n\nAgents boycott United for slashing commissions\n\nAdvocates assail legislation encouraging mergers\n\nToday on CNN\n\nRelated IDG.net stories:\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nLucent on the prowl?
