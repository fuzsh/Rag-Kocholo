        "text": "We are contacting you as the current employer for NES Foundation Year Trainee Pharmacist(s) in the 2023-24 training year.\n\nAs per the Employers agreements with NES for the Foundation Training Year, for all NES funded training posts, we stipulate some set terms and conditions which need to be included in the trainee pharmacists’ contract of employment with yourselves. This is to ensure consistency between training providers in all sectors, and these are set based on the Agenda for Change levels.\n\nNHS Circular PCS (AFC) 2024/2 (attached) was published on the 22nd of March and details an agreed reduction in the working week for Agenda for Change staff. This change is from 37.5 hours per week to 37 hours (pro rata for part time staff) effective from the 1st April 2024.\n\nNote that this is the first step to ultimately reducing the working week to 36 hours by 1st April 2026 as detailed in the circular.\n\nTherefore, can we please request that you apply this change to any contracts of employment for NES funded Foundation Year Trainee Pharmacists. There is no change to the current arrangements where we do not stipulate how these contracted hours are worked and they are agreed between employer and employee across the normal working hours of the training site.\n\nThe salary remains at the current level which is £30,229 per annum as the reduction in hours is to be applied without loss of earnings. Note that the circular also confirms that the 2024-25 pay settlement has not yet been agreed. We will advise of any changes when notified.\n\nWe will advise NES funded FTY Trainee Pharmacists w/c 1st April that this change is being implemented and that employers have been requested to action but will also request they remain patient whilst employers are dealing with the change. We appreciate this is being implemented at short notice and as per circular there is recognition that there may need to be flexibility initially.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact us on nes.ftypharmacy@nhs.scot"
