        "text": "Followings are testimonies given by some of our leaders and regular participants:\n\n“Stephen is a gifted educator and entrepreneur with a rare combination of patience, spunk and linguistic competence. I have been an active participant of his intercultural activities for over half a year. I have seen Stephen go above and beyond in organizing classes of over seven languages. Stephen knows multiple languages, and is a patient educator who made his weekly Korean class very enjoyable to students with various linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Because of his “student” mindset, he’s also eager to learn new languages, and that’s how the highly diverse and international members came together every weekend. Like many others, I certainly miss attending Stephen’s multicultural activities. I have only optimistic predictions for his career trajectory. Best,” – Milon Au Yeung (Former Participant and Multi-languages Teacher)\n\n“When I was a new mother Davis Mosaics connected me and my kids with a diverse, supportive and caring community. I am forever thankful that my kids and I got to experience languages, cultures and food from around the world.” – Amy Corona (Leader and Accountant)\n\n“In Davis Mosaics I have found a collaborative space where we all support each other to be better human beings. In this group, we share music, food, knowledge and especially kindness. Stephen has been the leader that makes it possible. Overcoming many obstacles and always finding the way of keeping this running. And for that, I’m greatly thankful.” – Carlos Andres Perez (Leader and Musician)\n\n“Davis Mosaics allowed me to study French, Spanish, and American Sign Language, and also gave me the opportunity to teach German. It was great to share my language knowledge with others and explore the German culture as well. Eating dinner afterwards with many new friends helped me feel part of a community. I know Mosaics helped people feel less alone and feel more hope. I run into people I met there often, and we still share tips with each other and have a kinship that will continue. Mosaics is a unique program that is irreplaceable. You can go there and learn new skills, like drumming, learn languages, try new foods, sing, dance, or just relax and meet new people. Stephen invites everyone to share their talents and knowledge with the group, and it is this exchange that makes Mosaics dynamic and exciting. Stephen and Grace create such a welcoming environment, that when you go there, it is hard to leave, and when you finally go home, you feel happier, smarter, and less alone. Thank you!” – Honna Steissberg (Leader, German Teacher and Bible Study Student)\n\n“Grace and Stephen Moon have given to me and to the community of Davis the highest gift of love. It is through the action of selfless service and dedication do they demonstrate their faith in the gospel of Jesus and the sacrifice of their personal free time do they graciously share this faith with the Davis community through the Mosaics. I feel very blessed to be a participant of such a beautiful network of friends and families where everyone is welcomed to contribute or receive knowledge and wisdom or find support and encouragement. Thank you and God Bless~” – Amber Weber (Regular Participant and Babysitter)\n\n“The first time I came here, I was surprised by the warm welcome of the members of Davis Mosaics. I soon realized that this is the place where people of many different cultures can spend time together and help others in need like a big family almost without any barrier. Although my time there was short, it was a new and pleasant experience that gave an introvert person such as myself different, positive ways of seeing other people.” – Hung Pham (Former Participant)\n\n“The Fellowship of Mosaics is a unique and diverse group with strong spiritual community and family values that respect all individuals. It has brought our family closer together and serves as a model for successful fellowship.” – The Clark family (Former Leader and Former Japanese Teacher)\n\n“As a Malian (a West Africa country), I came in Davis with different cultures and beliefs. Mosaics helped me to interact with people and to see the beauty of the cultural difference. With Mosaics, I learnt that kindness is the best way of communication between humans. I know that many are going through life challenges but they smile, sing and talk when they get together. Mosaic is family, there communication support which is important in difficult moments. May God bless our mosaic meetup where everyone from everywhere is accepted.” – Aïssata Sow (Regular Participant and Former French Teacher)\n\n“The Mosaics fellowship has been a wonderful gathering for language learning, cross cultural exchanges and sharing, as well as friendship building for my family. My husband, 2 young children, and I have all been greatly blessed by the fellowship that Dr. Moon and Mrs. Moon created and lead weekly for the 3.5 years that we’ve been attending Mosaics. It is a great place for the intercultural minded community to connect on a personal level. We’re thankful for the opportunity to be part of this fellowship and to see God’s blessings upon this group.” – Joyce L. (Regular Participant)\n\n“Pastor Stephen Moon, the driving force behind Mosaics, a faith-based meetup, has been a mentor and teacher to many in the community. Mosaics holds open meetings for a range of topics from language classes in ten different areas to music and guitar lessons to my favorite, Bible Study. Dr. Moon has a tight grip on the meaning behind the stories and always offers a fresh, modern perspective on these old stories. He also sheds new light on the meanings of some of the different translations through the use of his understanding of ancient languages. Another great thing about the Mosaics group is their dinners. Grace Moon and a few others come early to make delicious food every Saturday and Sunday night in Davis and Greenhaven respectively. In the past few months, the Greenhaven group has been closed down due to budget concerns, but hopefully it can be rekindled in the near future. I would recommend Mosaics to anyone who wants to feel a strong sense of community. The newest exciting addition is Tai Chi classes held after dinner. I hope to see more people there in the future.” – Mike Lewis (Regular Participant and Bible Study Student)\n\n“Thanks to Pastor Stephen and his wife Grace for opening the Mosaics group. This has helped many people come together to make new friends, learn new languages, take guitar lessons, cook, and learn tai chi. This group not only keeps young people out of trouble but also helps expose to new cultures, foods, and friends. I’m in the Bible study group, and I really enjoy reading and learning new things in the Bible. It helps me to stay motivated and faithful to God. I’m glad there’s a group where you can learn new languages, skill-guitar, and good food. Also, thanks to Grace for her time and energy cooking delicious foods.” – Katrina Tran (Regular Participant, Vietnamese Teacher and Bible Study Student)\n\n“Find a friendly face in the crowd” is said to many when they are scared to give a public speech. I was asked to be a Spanish substitute teacher at Davis Mosaics by my sister-in-law. I have battled with anxiety my whole life, so this would be a good challenge for me. I agreed, although I have never taught before. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by Stephen and Grace with open arms as if I were a family member who they missed and had finally come home. I stood in front of the class, all eyes on me. I could barely breathe. I looked up to see Stephen smiling at me, with his thumb up. I took a deep and started my lesson. By the end I was given feedback by those who attended my class that they enjoyed it. Soon enough I was the regular Spanish teacher. This was the first step to my life changing. During this time of my life, I didn’t have a place to call home for my two children and me. I was lucky enough to have a brother who allowed my little family borrow their space until I figured out what to do next. I found an apartment in Davis after much research and comparison of nearby schools and communities. In my opinion, a good education and love are two of the best gifts a parent could give their children. I was giving this to them but was struggling financially. I needed to find a less expensive home in Davis or move somewhere different where my kids’ education and peace of mind would be at stake. The Cannery was being built and they were building affordable apartments where rent amount would be based on income. It was a long shot!! They called it “A lottery system.” To even be part of the lottery system they wanted proof that one already belonged to the community and were ranked by points. I turned to Stephen. Who, made it possible for me to participate in the lottery giving my little family a chance to keep what was so important to me. “I was chosen!!!” Soon after I was hired at a local credit union and promoted to management after being there for only 8 months. My best friend asked me to be his wife and after saving for over a year we have purchased our home, here in Davis. They say find the “friendly face in the crowd” but I found more than that. I found a friend who was willing to help me pick myself up when I couldn’t see past what was in front in me. Thanks to Mosaics where my life was changed and I will forever be grateful. Davis Mosaics felt like home from day one and to many is a place to find peace while is rearranging itself.” – Rocio Corona (Regular Participant and Former Spanish Teacher)\n\n“Although I am not religious, Mosaics has been truly rewarding due to its commitment towards accomplishing the altruistic goal of caring for the community and its members. I have seen first-hand how your cause has changed the lives of so many people, including mine, and I could not have better sent my donation elsewhere. Thank you, Stephen and all the members of the church.” – Brandon Yuok (Former Participant)\n\n“I joined the Mosaics in 2015 and have had wonderful experiences with them since then. Not only is Paster Stephen Moon a faithful servant of the Lord and full of spiritual energy, but he is also a warm and caring person. The interactions with fellow members in this group have greatly deepen my understanding of different cultures in the world. The group activities are always well designed and appealing to attendees. Moreover, Mosaics provides many opportunities for community contribution and service. For example, I have offered a series of talks on Chinese history and culture, both online and face to face, to fellow group members, and such talks have been well received by the audience. – Dr. Feng Liu (Leader and Chinese History & Culture Teacher)\n\n“My name is Stephanie, I am a long-time Davis resident, paraprofessional, artist, musician, and nanny. I started taking classes at Mosaics before Covid hit in March of 2020. It was absolutely amazing being able to take various language classes that were offered for free to the community, and then join everyone for a delicious meal prepared by Grace and other volunteers. I met Stephen and Grace the first week that I came to Mosaics, and they were so incredibly kind, gracious, welcoming, and loving. They have truly created a beautiful environment with Mosaics, one in which people of all walks of life come, learn, laugh, play music, and feel accepted. Mosaics has created real community, and is one of the most treasured resources in our city, in my opinion. One can take a class in Portuguese, then a class in Japanese, then a class in Hebrew, Spanish, French, Mandarin etc. I have met so many interesting people while attending classes and dinners at Mosaics, I have learned new languages, and have made lasting friendships. Because of Stephen and Grace’s kindness, generosity, and commitment to community and creating a more equitable, just, loving and kind world, Stephen and Grace were nominated to have their portraits drawn in a series I created of community members who give back. They were two of 20 community members who were nominated for the project, the culminating show of which just transpired. I am so glad I know Stephen and Grace Moon, and I hope you will consider them for this grant. They are truly making a difference in this world, and will be able to do even more with your generous grant. Thank you!” – Stephanie Thayer (Leader and Arts & Music Teacher)\n\n“Mosaics has been a wonderful group. I have been coming to Mosaics with my 5 year old daughter. When I first came, I thought of it only as language classes. But I quickly came to realize the group is much more than that. It’s very welcoming, and Stephen and Grace are so kind and friendly, and make you feel included. The community feels like extended family. We enjoy being able to do classes like Drum and Tai Chi, the special events like cooking classes and holiday gatherings and celebrations, and having dinner together. I have gotten to know people and make friends, and I appreciate the sense of belonging and community in this group.” – Gene Wong (Regular Participant)\n\n“During the pandemic, we all felt the hardship of being socially isolated and the boredom of staying home on our own. I was very happy to find the Mosaics group on Meetup.com and connect with like-minded people from all over the US and abroad. Stephen Moon, pastor, teacher, and organizer of the group, made me feel welcome by being very kind, introducing me to other students and by showing interest in me and my culture. Stephen is a very positive person and he is eager to share his knowledge with everyone who attends the classes and Bible study sessions. I am studying Korean and it’s really hard to do it on my own where I live. Classes at Mosaics help me stay motivated and connected with some really awesome people who have the same passion: learning languages and living a meaningful life. Every week I look forward to connecting with everyone on Zoom, study together, and listen to Stephen’s funny and insightful stories about his life in South Korea and the United States, about things that are important in life. I also started teaching Russian at Mosaics thanks to Stephen’s idea and that helped me see how many people are interested in learning Russian. I am happy to be helping the community of online learners, just like Stephen does. Mosaics classes helped me stay positive and kept me socializing with nice, kind, and passionate people. I’m very happy that Stephen pushed forward and kept the classes going throughout the pandemic. He makes lessons very engaging and weaves kindness and spirituality into every one of his stories. Spirituality is something many of lack without realizing how important it is for our well-being. All in all, I think that fate led me to the Mosaics group and brought so many wonderful people from this fellowship into my life!” – Olya Iliuk (Regular Participant, Russian Teacher and Bible Study Student)\n\n“Intercultural Mosaics has blossomed into something far greater than I could have ever expected. I began as a participant shortly after relocating to Davis for a new job. My college degree in French ignited a passion for foreign languages, and I focus most of my time learning Spanish now, which is what lead me to Intercultural Mosaics. The Spanish classes have been an incredible additional to the studies that I pursue on my own time. I’ve learned new concepts and phrases thanks to the classes. However, the value of Intercultural Mosaics is far greater than the language instruction component. It’s become a group of friends. I knew few people when I arrived in Davis, but now I can say that I have a broad network thanks to Intercultural Mosaics. Our shared enthusiasm for foreign languages connects us all. I have even met up with my fellow participants outside of class time more than once. This group embraces members who come from different faith backgrounds and is eager to learn about new cultures and religions- my own, for instance, as a Jewish person. I have expanded my involvement as the French teacher. Teaching is one of the most rewarding experiences that anyone can have. One of the students is pursuing her own degree in foreign languages, and I have helped her with homework. Helping someone else achieve their professional goals is a truly empowering feeling. Intercultural Mosaics is more than classes; it’s a community.” – Seth Browner (Leader, French & Hebrew Teacher)\n\n“I have been attending classes and events from Intercultural Mosaics weekly for over a year now, and it has been an amazing experience. I am able to meet so many people of different backgrounds who are all excited to share their cultures and languages and also learn from others. I had just moved to Davis when I started attending classes, and due to the pandemic it was difficult to meet people, and Mosaics has helped me connect with like-minded individuals from the area. Everyone is incredibly welcoming and as somebody who loves learning languages, it’s so exciting to be able to attend casual courses in Korean, Spanish, Chinese, and more! I’m grateful to have also been a substitute German teacher and it was a great experience to give back to the community. Classes and events are reliable and well-organized, though each teacher has a lot of freedom in terms of format. Overall, I’m so deeply glad I found a community like Intercultural Mosaics and am looking forward to continuing to be a part of it in the future!” – Hanna Francis (Regular Participant and Assistant German Teacher)\n\n“My name is Ying Chih Lin. I joined Intercultural Mosaics in September 2020. At that time, I was looking to connect with people and join groups that shared my interest – learning Korean. I’m very glad I had found Intercultural Mosaics on the platform Meetup. Currently, Intercultural Mosaics offer many language classes via Zoom, and also a Bible study session. During the pandemic period, it’s very easy for people to feel isolated as there were quarantine restrictions and many of the usual personal interactions were limited. Mosaics provide a safe online platform for people who share the same interests to gather together and stay connected. It’s great to be able to learn, laugh, and share our lives during classes. We have students from all over the world, it’s quite amazing. After months of participating in the Korean class, I myself volunteered to be a Chinese Mandarin conversation facilitator for Mosaics. It’s really great to be able to meet and connect with people from different backgrounds and all parts of the world. I sincerely hope that Mosaics would be able to continue to offer the classes so we can bring everyone closer together!” – Allie Lin (Regular Participant, Conversational Chinese Teacher and Bible Study Student)\n\n“I joined Intercultural Mosaics since the end of 2020. By attending the weekly meeting of the Spanish class and the English learner group, I felt connected with people from different countries, enjoyed my reading time with my group, as well as had a good time with Linda, Chad, Stephen, and many other people. I really appreciate Intercultural Mosaics as it created a platform and an opportunity for me to virtually meet with people with various culture and languages, which means a lot to me especially during the pandemic. The weekly meeting became part of my life because it brings me joy and plays an important role in maintaining my mental health with its strong social support. Thank you, Intercultural Mosaics!” – Huiyan Wu (Regular Participant and Chinese Teacher)\n\n“I’m writing this testimony on behalf of Pastor Stephen Moon. Prior to meeting him and his ministry, I would describe myself as a do-it-yourself Christian. I rarely attended church and had very little contact with other Christians. In June of 2019, I began attending Mosaics Bible study class every Sunday. Since then, I have gained a deeper understanding of the Bible and the teachings of our Lord and Jesus Christ. I also enjoy meeting other like-minded Christians where we each take turns reading from the Bible and pray for one another. In addition, I really enjoy the dinners that the Pastor’s wife makes and the wide variety of food we get to sample every Saturday. Having no family of my own, Pastor Steve and his wife Grace has always made me feel welcome and part of the Intercultural Mosaics family. Graciously,” – Robert Richardson (Leader and Bible Study Student)\n\n“Mosaics has been providing free language classes, cooking classes, music classes and the Bible reading class. People who attend the classes come not only from Davis but also from nearby cities. Mosaics has also been providing free meals during the events and the classes. During the pandemic, Mosaics has been offering classes on Zoom and the participants are not only from California, but also from other states and even other countries, such as Japan, China, Korea, Italy, Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia, Morocco, Iran, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Germany, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Taiwan, Malaysia, Mongolia, India, Colombia, Russia, France, UK. Mosaics also organizes social events such as picnics, hiking, karaoke, Christmas celebration and birthday parties. Mosaics is connecting more and more people in the Unites States and the world.” – Pavel Shabunin (Founding Leader, Musician and Russian & French Teacher)\n\n“I look forward to the events with Mosaics because the group is welcoming and provide wholesome experiences and learning opportunities. The language classes promote cultural understanding and easier communication with those who speak a different language, and the cooking events, BBQs, hikes, and other events let us practice our language skills as well as connect with those in our community.” – Diana Mau (Regular Participant)\n\n“I’ve been a volunteer as Spanish teacher with Intercultural Mosaics for four years, and it has been the most fulfilling experience in my life. Every time we meet for classes, I have the opportunity to learn from my students at the same time they learn from me. The best part of the group’s gathering is when we get together to eat the delicious food Mrs. Moon prepares and shares with everybody. We get to try food from all parts of the world and learn about other cultures as well. During our online classes we also welcome students from different countries who share with us our passion for learning and coming together as an international community dedicated to assist each other.” – Viviana Hernandez (Leader and Spanish Teacher)\n\n“My name is Henry and I have been part of Davis Mosaics since 2017. I joined Mosaics to learn new languages and connect with other people from different backgrounds and cultures. My experience has been positive and gratifying. I have been able to learn new aspects of different languages and cultures. I have made friends that I continue to connect with and learn from. I am grateful that Davis Mosaics is there for people to learn, help and contribute with one another. It’s a very positive environment that encourages harmony, respect and friendship.” – Henry Carpio (Regular Participant)\n\n“The Intercultural Fellowship of Mosaics has been a support network where I always feel welcome. Participating in weekly meetings is a way to glean from different perspectives and offer up my own so all parties involved have a chance to learn from one another. Personally, I am not the most outgoing person, so small groups work well for me and I feel valued with the opportunity to share my experiences. Meeting new people is necessary, though facilitated in a wholesome and friendly environment. An underlying basis of faith and cultural/language exchange keeps everything light-hearted. Achieving the proper balances of social interaction helps everyone’s mental health and morale in these trying times when the world needs more harmony.” – Nathaniel Ridad (Regular Participant)\n\n“I am a retired MD and my wife is a retired teacher. We have been going to Mosaics for 6 years. I started because of a Russian class and then also became involved with a guitar singing group and then Japanese language for the last 2 years. This group has been a nice place to meet people. It is a ministry where people feel the love of Christ. There is no doubt that many people who come are not (yet) believers and who would not be likely to attend a “normal’ church service. People of different faiths or no faith feel loved and accepted and I am sure there is some lasting impact. Through Mosaics, I have met and become friends with people from many countries including Japan, China/Taiwan, South Korea, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, India, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Israel, Iran, Mexico, Togo and Vietnam to name a few. For about two years, we have been doing an English conversation group. We started in person and when Covid hit we switched to zoom which gave the added benefit of meeting people who are currently not in America but living in some of the countries listed above. Steve and Grace Moon do a great job of leading and hosting this event and also keeping it alive with the challenges of the pandemic. Sincerely,” – Dr. Chad Andrews (Founding Leader, Acoustic Music Group and English Learners Group Co-Leader)\n\n“My experience with intercultural Mosaics has been very rewarding. I have attended for almost 6 years and have learned so many different things! I started by speaking Spanish and beginning Russian, and eventually added on elementary French and Portuguese. Along with learning languages, Mosaics offers wonderful opportunities to connect with people from many different countries around the world. We are enriched with intercultural conversations, singing, music, cooking, crafts, and even hiking! People connect in a loving, non-judgmental environment and make friends for life! Mosaics really helps people in our community love, care for and appreciate each other. I am proud to belong to such a worthwhile group!” – Linda Andrews (Founding Leader, English Learners Group Co-Leader)\n\n“My name is Jenny Zambrano. I’m originally from Colombia and moved to the USA in 2016. Some months later, I joined the Intercultural Mosaics program as a Spanish teacher. I taught Spanish and shared about the Latino culture, and my beautiful students helped me improve my English and learn about the American culture. So, this community has tremendously supported me in the process of adapting to a new country. In addition, I found acceptance, generosity, and much love. And those values come from the Intercultural Mosaics founders Grace and Dr. Moon. They always lead by example and keep us together as a family. I’m very grateful and feel blessed for that.” – Jenny Zambrano Bermudez (Leader and Spanish Teacher)\n\n“My wife and I found Davis Mosaics several years ago while looking for a place to learn the Korean language. What we found is so much more than we could have hoped. The opportunity to spend time with Dr. Moon and other like-minded individuals over the years, albeit only via Zoom lately, has made all the difference before and during this long-lasting pandemic. Even while “socially distancing” and unable to meet in person, we were continuously exposed to a diversity of cultures that kept us growing. With all the contention and uncertainty during the pandemic over the last nearly two years, Davis Mosaics has provided my family and I a stable, welcome, and consistent source of community, education, cultural experience, and enjoyment. The services provided are well planned and truly benefit the participants, spiritually, physically, and educationally. I believe Davis Mosaics is an exceptional organization and highly beneficial to the community at large and look forward to being able to return to in-person activities, both indoor and outdoor.” – James R. & Tibbie Ballou Mountjoy (Regular Participants)\n\n“I have enjoyed how Stephen Moon and his Intercultural Mosaics has impacted myself as well as the community and people in need of supportive friends, fellowship and sharing a learning capacity for languages, culture and music around the world. I will always treasure Stephen’s programs with forever memories in my heart with laughter, a sense of belonging and a purpose to help and support people. Stephen gives the community an opportunity to be heard, involved and have fun together. I would like to see Stephen’s ministry grow in helping those in need especially during these trying times of the Covid pandemic.” – Rebecca Shepherd (Regular Participant and Former English Teacher)\n\n“I joined the Mosaics back in August of 2014. At that time Stephen Moon and his wife Grace were holding meetings in his home in Elk Grove on the weekends. Stephen has a way of making people feel welcome. His group is open for anyone with an interest in learning foreign languages and other subjects. Most of the meetups are informal classes taught by volunteer teachers. He also has periodic hikes, dinners and other outings. His wife Grace cooks wonderful delicious food which keeps people coming back for more. By profession Stephen is a Christian clergyman but people of all religions or no religions are welcome to attend at no cost. I have attended meetups over the years and have been a substitute teacher for Spanish and Guitar when the regular instructors weren’t available. Over the years the meetups have moved out of his house to church buildings and now in the era of Covid online. Being a part of Mosaics has given me an opportunity to meet and to help other people that I might not have met. May God continue to bless the Moons and the Intercultural Mosaics.” – Mike Rhymes (Regular Participant and Music, Spanish & English Substitute Teacher)\n\n“Intercultural Mosaics has played a significant role in the upbringing and multicultural learning for my children. The free multiple language classes provide a chance for my children to learn about other cultures and engages them with people of different backgrounds. This gives my children and I the ability to connect with others through lessons, songs and fellowship. We realize it’s a big world out there, but Intercultural Mosaics helps to make it small and very enjoyable. It provides a great avenue to connect with community in these uncertain times.” – Mabel Joy (Regular Participant)\n\n“My name is Yao Yao, I am a physics Ph.D. student at UC Davis. As an international student whose life is mostly tied to study and research, Mosaics provides me an amazing chance to create connections to the local community and diverse cultures. I joined Mosaics in 2016. At first, I just came for learning Japanese, but soon I realized that Mosaics is more than just language classes. I met with many interesting friends who share their cool stories and precious experience about life, and they are all inspiring. Mosaics has participants from different generations, fields, and cultures, which makes communication never tiresome. Mosaics is so far the most inclusive place I’ve been to, and many thanks to the great organizing jobs done by Stephen and Grace.” – Yao Yao (Regular Participant)\n\n“Mosaics Fellowship is awesome. When you come to Mosaics you see people from different ethnic, social, economic and age groups. Even though Mosaics is Christian ministry, people from different faiths or non-faith attend the classes. Besides learning a new language, other skills are taught such as drumming and guitar. The best part of Mosaics fellowship is Grace’s cooking. What is great about Mosaics fellowship is that you learn new things and you meet new people.” – Chris Horsting (Regular Participant)"
