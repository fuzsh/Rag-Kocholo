        "text": "1 John 4:9-10 This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.\n\nWhy should the most powerful, majestic and holy being in the entire universe love us lowly, sinful, little rugrats? (Rugrat is a small child who is learning to get around by crawling and eventually walking on their own. They are very short on social skills and are trying to grow and develop. They are rude, whinny and very temperamental and sometimes straight up bad. With time and good training they can mature and become a great asset to society.) I hope you’re not insulted that I called us rugrats but we are like young children to God and we have to spiritually grow up and mature. We are created beings who sinned from our very beginning and who were disobedient, lied, cheated and killed. (Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel.) We all are sinners and fall far short of the holiness of God. But as bad and as flawed as we are our creator has crazy love for us!!! He surely doesn’t have to love us. But why does He?\n\nIf you see God only as starting in Genesis 1, you will not get the whole picture about how much God loves you. His love for us did not start with creation…it goes further back than that! If people understood this concept there would never be any abortions. Life doesn’t start in the womb…it starts in God’s mind! This is where the thought of our existence was first conceived by God’s love. God loved you before any of this thing called creation was solidified. We are not an after effect of 2 humans uniting. Nobody’s life is unplanned or unexpected. Nobody is a mistake or happened by accident. Romans 8:29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.\n\nSatan tries to get you to believe the lie that you’re nobody. He even tries to get you to believe in evolution or that there is no God so he can cover up God’s love for you. This is one of his greatest deceptions. The devil tries to get you to believe that God doesn’t love you because of all the struggles and turmoil’s in your life. It’s all lies I tell you it’s a lie!!!!!\n\nEvery year millions of kids are told a big lie that there’s a man name Santa Claus who will bring you good things. Let’s not forget about the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny! Not only did we believe it ourselves, but we fed this lie it to our own children. You’re an adult now and although you were manipulated to believe these lies you now know the truth and nobody can ever get you to start believing in Santa Claus again. Well the devil feed us all a pack of lies our whole life until we got saved. We know the truth now but let’s get the whole truth which is just how much and why God’s loves us so much. Ephesians 1:4 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love\n\nYou see when you know and understand how much God really loves you won’t be affected by life’s natural daily struggles. This is why Job said “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.”( Job 13:15) He couldn’t have dealt with such tragedy if he was sure of God’s love for him.\n\n1 John 4:16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.\n\nJeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\n\nSo you see God had plans for you all along. These are good plans too. One day while in my deep prayer closet time with the Lord I asked Him why did He create us. He asked me why did I want children. I told Him that I wanted someone to love that was a part of me and He said to me, that’s why I wanted children, I wanted someone to love that was a part of me”. Knowing God… I’m sure God has created many different galaxies and other beings. But I think that creating someone and calling them your children then coming up with a plan to redeem them made us more special than any other of His created beings.\n\nI think God has a lot of feelings when it comes to you and me. He greatly humiliated Himself when He came down from Heaven in the form of a man and let the beings He created tortured Him and then murder Him. God put the 3rd person of the trinity in the people who accepted His Son Jesus so that He can be in constant communication with them. If that ain’t love I just don’t know what is!!!! He will also one day take away all of their sadness and wipe away all their tears!!! Then He makes a great home for them to live in and they will reign and rule with Him forever!!!\n\nI never thought that anyone could love me this way. At first I didn’t know how to receive God’s love for me. I had been programed my whole life to be in a low self-esteem mode to the point of trying to commit suicide. I didn’t even let my husband love me back then. I just thought I was not worthy of that kind of love. But over time I began to feel the power of God’s love. The more I learned God’s word I began to understand why God really created me. I started to feel really special. I now go around saying to myself….”I’m God’s girl”!!! I know this full well now!\n\nPsalm 139:13 -14 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.\n\nGod even reassures us that nothing will remove His love for us…. Romans 8:37-38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Now this is some really deep love. We haven’t even always acted right ya’ll! You know we must get on God’s nerves sometimes but nothing…I said nothing will ever separate us from this love from our Father God! This is why Jesus and the Holy Spirit is working overtime to get us to live a holy life in preparation for eternity with the Father. God thought of everything!\n\nIn light of the holiness of God that can bring on the wrath of God if you have not accepted the gift of God which is JESUS…you can tell just how much God loves us. Read these scriptures and see what we were spared from.\n\n(Nahum 1:2-6) 2The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and vents his wrath against his enemies. 3The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.4He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade. 5The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it. 6Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.\n\n(John 3:16) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\n\nRomans 5:8 makes me wanna cry….” But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” It makes me wanna cry out for joy! Jesus death was a demonstration of God’s love for me! He not only loved me but did something to prove it. A powerful God humiliated Himself because He loves me so. And He saved me from ever experiencing the wrath of God! Now that is really powerful!!!\n\nThis is what makes me want to get on my face before the throne of God and kiss His feet for the rest of my life. Sometimes I just randomly just start crying because I’m overwhelmed that God loves me that much.\n\nGod loves me because He is love as it says in the bible. 1 John 4:8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. God is love and when I die I’m going to experience the incredible full blast power of this love on me. I feel a microscopic amount of this now…can you imagine feeling 100% of God’s love? This is why I’m not worrying about my mom and brother who is with the Lord in heaven receiving all that goodness right now. I’m so happy for them.\n\nI really hope that my blog today in some small way has helped you ponder the love that God has for you. I feel this is so important in a Christian’s life and can motivate you to make your life a living sacrifice to God for His kingdom.\n\nEphesians 2:4-5 But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions–it is by grace you have been saved. THANK YOU GOD FOR YOUR WONDERFUL AMAZING GRACE AND FOR YOUR GREAT LOVE FOR US!\n\n1 Samuel 2:2 There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.\n\nTo try to understand the holiness of God on your own is like trying to hold water with your hands. It’s like trying to understand the trinity…it just makes your brain work overtime. To understand some of the bibles mysterious information you have to have the Holy Spirit and study the bible. (1 Corinthians 2:10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.) We need to get some understanding about the holiness of God because this is how we will see and experience God in our lives now and this is how we will see God face to face one day.\n\nRecently when I was in my prayer closet time with God I could sense a small drop of His holiness and I became terrified of it. (Psalms 33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.) I told God that I was scared of His holiness and I really am! I experienced a little of His greatness for a brief moment and I really couldn’t deal with it because of dread. The dread comes from seeing my own heart in light of God’s holiness. This experience also shows me another side of God and that is of His love and grace for which I’m so grateful for. It’s amazing to me that a being with so much power can also be so loving and caring. Look how man acts with a microscopic amount of power.\n\nWe humans can’t get the scope of God’s holiness because our own world seems so large to us and we can’t see much beyond it.\n\nGod has MANY attributes but His holiness to me is the most magnificent part of His character. It’s played a major role in humanities creation, separation and salvation.\n\nThere is a movie called Avatar and in the movie the two lead characters were experiencing a touching moment. They were from 2 different cultures/worlds. As the man was dying he looked at the being a woman and said “I see you” She looked at him and she said to the man “I see you”. That meant that they could see each other’s true inner selves. I can really see and experience God in unusual ways in prayer. I too have told God “I see you”. I see Him in my spirit. It’s during these deep times of prayer that I see more of God than at other times but it doesn’t last long. I can’t hold on to it, again it’s like holding water in my hands. So I depend on the word of God…His holy book. My bible study updates and refreshes me.\n\nThe holiness of God makes me so grateful to Jesus. He took on our sin so that we would no longer be an enemy of God. Jesus helps us to live a holy life now and one day He will present us faultless before our holy God. Just writing these precious words does not give it the glory that Jesus act of love and sacrifice deserves. 2 Timothy 1:9 He has saved us and called us to a holy life–not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,\n\nIf I want to see the power of God in my life I need to be holy!! My heart has got to be clean! I need to be right with God! God commands that we be holy like He is. 1 Peter 1:16 because it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy\n\nEverything that affects us humans is a result of the holiness of God. People have cheapened the word holy by using in phrases like holy cow, holy moly, holy smoke and so on. Man describes the word holy as being set apart, deity, consecrated, hallowed, sanctified, sacred, separateness and divine. I see the word holy like this…. backing up in time and before the creation of the earth and imagining in your mind an awesome being who always existed and who is so unique that there is nothing to compare Him with. Ephesians 1:4 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love. Our lives began way back before creation and His existence goes back into infinity. When you are so glorious, majestic and powerful that you refer to yourself as “I AM”… I just have to say…..WOW!\n\nGod is a spirit being that has great powers to be able to create universes, people, others beings and billions of other unique things. He is so perfect and has never done anything wrong because He is so very holy. Nobody can even see Him unless they are holy…100% clean. Ephesians 5:25-27 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 26 so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 27 that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.\n\nThe whole concept of God being holy can’t possibly be easy for us to understand in our natural state. We need the power of the words from the holy bible, the power and anointing of the Holy Spirit and the blood of Jesus to get this knowledge and understanding into our spiritman. Job 11:7 Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?\n\nRight now we see God through the fullness of Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. But one day soon we will able to partake, experience and enjoy God’s full holiness!!! Revelation 22:4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. Matthew 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. I think about this all the time. It helps me get through life’s difficulties to have this blessed hope in my heart and mind.\n\nWe must ponder on the holiness of God whose image we were made in and what he’s requiring us to be like. Holiness is who God our father is. This is a really big thing! It puts who we are and how we are to be in total perspective. Our lives are all about God. We are supposed to be like our creator….holy. How can we possibly do this if we don’t try to understand the holiness of God? My pray for you today is that you will be able to say to God in your prayer time….”I see you”.\n\nGenesis 1:27 So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\n\nOh my Lord! What a privilege it is to be made into the image of God. He is the I Am! Holy and set apart. I’ve been adopted into His family. I’m so scared of who He is, His holiness because I recognize His power and authority… but at the same time I know He loves me so very much and that everything in my life is being done for my BEST interest!\n\nPhilippians 3:20-21 But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who by the power that enables Him to subject all things to Himself, will transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body.\n\nSo… we have a spirit like God AND our bodies are going to be transformed to be like Him also. WOW!\n\nNow lucifer knew what God was planning for mankind so he got really arrogant. Isaiah 14:13-14 You said in your heart, “I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. 14 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.” You see satan thought he was all that and a bag of chips! God so doesn’t like prideful thinking at all!\n\nWhen lucifer realized that we were going to be created he came up with a big plan of attack. Hebrews 1:14 Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation? satan didn’t want to serve us…he wanted to be served!\n\nHe wants us to crash and burn. He wants us to shove God’s gift of salvation back at him. Satan has been trying to get us to reject God’s gift of Jesus Christ for a great part of our lives but the Holy Spirit kept revealing Jesus to us. We all finally broke down and accepted Jesus Christ as our Savior when we realized our empty, sorrowful and sinful heart needed so much more. We found that relief, peace, joy, love and forgiveness through Jesus.\n\nsatan hates me and you!!! He tries to get us to shame God. satan also doesn’t want us to share the good news of Jesus Christ. I know he doesn’t want me to share how to get a closer walk with God with you all. satan also doesn’t want you to know about his sly tricks to deceive you. He wants you ignorant to who he really is.\n\nHe also wants us to hate each other. We need to stop judging the sinner and recognize who the real enemy and trouble maker. We are supposed to be trying to help the sinner, show them love and shine our light so they can follow the light to Jesus. We’ve gotten use to focusing on the different types of sin to the point that we have ignored our true calling to make disciples. We must passionately go after the lost. Satan’s got his plans and we’ve all got to get with God’s plans.\n\nDo you know why satan hates us so?\n\nWe have a soul and a spirit! He doesn’t have those!\n\nWe are going to reign and rule with the Lord.\n\nWe all are more special to God than the angels.\n\nWe were bought with a price. We are redeemed and He can never be!\n\nGod Himself came down and saved us.(Emanuel-God with us)\n\nGod pays us a lot of attention!\n\nThe Holy Spirit lives in us.\n\nGod calls us His children and we are.\n\nHe is identified as our Abba Father Abba is a relationship based word meaning daddy.\n\nGod loves the mess out of us!!!!!! ( John 3:16)\n\nThis relation with God could not be any closer for a child of God than this.\n\nDo we really know and understand this unique relationship of being adopted into God’s family? Shouldn’t we be going all out for our Father God? Should I be trying to work my butt off for the kingdom? Shouldn’t I know how to put satan in his place because of what Jesus has already accomplished for me on the cross? (The how is to put on the whole amour of God)\n\n3 things I really need to be accomplishing in my life:\n\nI need to work at getting my faith at a premium level by filling up on God’s word.\n\nI need to take advantage of the 24 hour a day 7 days a week access I have to God.\n\nMaking sure I have on the whole armor of God.\n\nThis is the time for all who call themselves a Christian to be 100% one! 99 ½ won’t do in these days and times. We must be deeply committed to the Lord and to the work for the kingdom of God. People are being plucked from this earth at an alarming rate. Tragedy and catastrophic events are increasing. We are all in the path of storms and we need Jesus in our boat. The forecast has been issued and the hurricane has been named. Hurricane satan. He is coming ashore and will land in your town soon. Be ready, be vigilant and have your amour on.\n\nThis blog today is not to scare you but to give you the heads up on where all the evil and hate is coming from. I’ve share how it started and where we can go from here.\n\nGod has a great plan for our lives! We ARE blessed! Meditate on the following scripture.\n\nEphesians 1:3-5 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. 4 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love 5 he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—\n\nYOU ARE SO BLESSED! YOU NEED NOT BE STRESSED!\n\nJESUS CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN SO OUR LIVES WOULDN’T END UP A MESS!\n\nSO STUDY YOUR BIBLE AND PRAY A WHOLE LOT!\n\nBECAUSE JESUS HAS FOILED satan’s EVIL PLOT!\n\nONE DAY YOU’LL BE IN HEAVEN IF YOU CAN JUST ENDURE!\n\nGODS WORD IS TRUE AND IN THIS YOU CAN BE SURE!\n\nP.S.- I don’t capitalize satan name because he doesn’t get that honor from me!!"
