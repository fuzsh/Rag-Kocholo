        "text": "New building offers full financial services and six interactive teller machines\n\nTULLAHOMA, TN (October 5, 2020) — Ascend Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in Middle Tennessee, opened a new branch in Smyrna today. The state-of-the-art building, located at 769 Nissan Drive, replaces the original structure. The third branch opening this year, Ascend has 28 total full-service financial centers throughout Middle Tennessee, with six located in Rutherford County.\n\nThe full-service branch offers checking, savings, money market and certificate of deposit accounts. Other products include mortgage, auto and recreational loans, credit cards, signature loans, signature line of credit loans and business accounts and loans. It also features six interactive teller machines (ITM), where a service representative is available via video to provide a full suite of services.\n\n“We are so thankful to members and community partners throughout Rutherford County for their patience as we razed our old Smyrna branch and constructed a new financial center in its place,” said Ascend President and CEO Caren Gabriel. “The bright, beautiful new building offers the latest technology, along with an expansive and inviting customer service experience.”\n\nThe lobby’s hours of operation are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. Please visit ascend.org/covid19-updates for Saturday lobby availability due to COVID-19. Three ITMs are available inside the building during lobby hours. Three drive-up ITMs are also available with extended hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Plus, outdoor ITMs can be used as ATMs around-the-clock to make withdrawals, deposits and balance inquiries. The branch also has a CoinStar machine and night-drop capabilities.\n\nTo help protect against COVID-19, Ascend is limiting the number of individuals inside its lobbies to adhere to social distancing recommendations.\n\nAbout Ascend Federal Credit Union\n\nWith more than 243,000 members and more than $4.4 billion in assets, Ascend Federal Credit Union is the largest credit union in Middle Tennessee and one of the largest federally chartered credit unions in the United States.
