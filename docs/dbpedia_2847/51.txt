At the first meeting of the Corporation that would run the new college, members were sworn in and the business of fundraising rose to the fore. Among the organizationâs members were Nicholas Brown, one of four Brown brothers and father of future college namesake Nicholas Brown, Jr. At the meeting, Rhode Island Governor Stephen Hopkins (who would be a signer of the Declaration of Independence) was elected Chancellor. The selection of a college president would not be addressed until their second meeting.
