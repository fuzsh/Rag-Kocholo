        "text": "Bobby Brown Jr. dies at 28\n\nBobby Brown’s son, Bobby Brown Jr., has been found dead at age 28. CBS reports police officers responding to a medical emergency found Brown Jr.’s body Wednesday afternoon at a home in Los Angeles. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A cause of death has not been announced, but police said no foul play was involved. Brown Jr. was the son of singer Bobby Brown and Kim Ward, and the half-brother of Bobbi Kristina Brown, whose mother was Whitney Houston. Drug abuse was involved in the death of both Bobbi Kristina and Houston.\n\n‘Name That Tune’ returns\n\nAnother classic game show is getting a revival. Billboard reports Fox is bringing back “Name That Tune” in January, testing contestants on their music knowledge in a variety of challenges (similar to “Beat Shazam”). “30 Rock” star Jane Krakowski will host the reality competition with “American Idol” star Randy Jackson serving as band leader. “Name That Tune,” which originally began as a radio program in 1952 before moving to television, will be paired with “The Masked Singer” when its fifth season premieres Jan. 6.\n\nNew Daisy Ridley movie\n\n“Star Wars” actress Daisy Ridley is moving on from Rey Skywalker in the first trailer for “Chaos Walking.” The new sci-fi film from Doug Liman follows Tom Holland (”Spider-Man”) on a planet where all women have disappeared and their inner thoughts are always audible. Chaos ensues when a woman (Ridley) crash lands on the planet and he vows to protect her. “Chaos Walking,” also starring Mads Mikkelsen, Cynthia Erivo, Nick Jonas, Kurt Sutter, and David Oyelowo, is scheduled for release Jan. 22.\n\nMORE BUZZ:\n\nBruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart do Stand Up for Heroes benefit (RS)\n\nTory Lanez pleads not guilty in Megan Thee Stallion shooting case (ET)\n\nEzra Miller cast in Stephen King’s ‘The Stand’ (SF)\n\nTikTok users creating ‘Ratatouille: The Musical’ (RS)\n\nWill Smith, original Aunt Viv make amends during ‘Fresh Prince’ reunion (E!)\n\n‘Scream 5′ officially titled ‘Scream’ (ET)\n\n‘Sharkboy and Lavagirl’ are grown up in Netflix sequel ‘We Can Be Heroes’ (SF)\n\nThe Postal Service releasing live album (RS)\n\nLil Baby, Taylor Swift win big at Apple Music Awards (BB)\n\n‘The Masked Singer’ unmasks two more celebrities (E!)\n\n‘Minions’ holiday special coming to NBC, Peacock (SF)\n\nMatthew McConaughey says he’s not running for Texas governor (ET)\n\nLil Pump drops pro-Trump song ‘Lil Pimp Big MAGA Steppin’ (BB)\n\nAni DiFranco announces new album (RS)\n\nTed Danson doing ‘Cheers,’ ‘Three Men and a Baby’ reunions (SF)\n\nDemi Lovato shaves her head during makeover (E!)\n\nSia announces new ‘Music’ album (BB)\n\nEddie Vedder releases two new songs (RS)\n\n‘Lethal Weapon 5′ still in works, according to Mel Gibson (SF)"
