        "text": "Nickolas Brown, 23, of Joliet, IL went to be with the Lord on Wednesday, July 3, 2019. He was born January 4, 1996 to Angela Brown (Andre Brown, step-father) and his biological father, Albert Washington.\n\nNickolas graduated from Joliet West High school where he received his diploma. He had a fond love for wrestling, weight lifting, and animals. He assisted in the care of his grandparents Mr. and Mrs Robinson. His smile would light up any room and his personality was enlightening. Tuesday’s were reserved for dinners/movies with his special cousin that’s more like a brother, Kent Robinson Jr.\n\nNickolas is survived by his maternal grandparents Theola and Roscoe Robinson; paternal grandparents, Dent Moffett and Barber McCampble; mother, Angela Brown; brother, Eric Brown; step-sister, Keyonna Williams; aunts, Tenisha Travis, Diana Robinson, Joan Watkins, Enid Jackson, Hilary Robinson and Marsha Moore; uncles, Kent Robinson, Ernest Robinson, and Becarr Washington; special cousins, Richard Robinson, Shaquaya Robinson, and Zaria Travis and biological father, Albert Washington."
