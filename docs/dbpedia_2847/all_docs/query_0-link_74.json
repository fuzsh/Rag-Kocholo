        "text": "NICK FURY JR.\n\nRaised by a single mother and living a normal life as a U.S. Army Ranger, Marcus Johnson only began using his current moniker when he discovered that his birth father was none other than legendary super-spy Nick Fury. Already a trained combat veteran with a host of covert experiences under his belt, Nick Fury Jr. claimed his birthright and started a new life in espionage, following in his old man’s footsteps as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nA New World\n\nMarcus Johnson’s life used to make sense. He grew up a bright, gifted young man in Atlanta, Georgia who could have gotten a full ride to any university he wanted, but instead, he chose to enlist in the army first. After a tour in the Middle East, he got his Bachelor’s Degree in Philosophy from the University of Georgia, before enlisting again. He served in Afghanistan as a Ranger, alongside his best friend Phil “Cheese” Coulson—a man who saved his life more times than he could count. Like any soldier, he missed home, but didn’t think his mother would have to die for him to see it again…\n\nTo Johnson, his mother Nia had always been a compassionate woman; a social studies teacher with a heart as warm as her mind was sharp. But after her funeral and the subsequent attempt on his life by Orion (Victor Uvarov) and his underlings from the terrorist organization known as Leviathan, Johnson discovered that his mother had lived a different life before his birth. After having his own life saved by the one and only Captain America, Johnson uncovered Nia’s secret history as a CIA agent. With that piece of crucial information came another bombshell revelation: his father was none other than Colonel Nick Fury, the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nOrion targeted Johnson’s mother and Johnson himself in an attempt to harvest his father’s Infinity Formula from his blood. With the help of Coulson, his father and the Avengers, Johnson was able to defeat Orion and get revenge for his slain parent. Having lost an eye in the process, Johnson answered his father’s challenge to protect the world, embracing his birth name Nick Fury Jr. and joining S.H.I.E.L.D. in a uniform gifted to him by Captain America. Coulson joined as well, helping him along the way in the transition from soldier to super-spy.\n\nFurious Might\n\nThanks to his father’s Infinity Formula, which also flows through his veins, Nick Fury Jr.’s aging process has slowed to a crawl. The compound also provides him with sped-up healing abilities and has enhanced his physical attributes to peak human levels. He’s also a fully trained former Army Ranger and current S.H.I.E.L.D. agent well-versed in military strategy, espionage, subterfuge, and various forms of weaponry and hand to hand combat.\n\nInternational Enemies\n\nAs the son of a legendary superspy, Fury Jr. has had to contend with Orion (Victor Uvarov), HYDRA and other enemies of S.H.I.E.L.D. inherited from his old man. He’s also done battle with the Masters of Evil and Leader, a rogue Life Model Decoy of his father.\n\nVital Allies\n\nAs an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury Jr. has counted the entire agency as his compatriots, but he’s worked most closely with Maria Hill and his best friend-turned-colleague Phil Coulson. His first adventure was with his estranged father, and he’s since teamed up with other allies of his pops, like Captain America and Wolverine. He’s also been a member of the Secret Avengers, alongside heroes like Hawkeye and Spider-Woman.\n\nPatching Life Together\n\nEarly in his career with S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury and Coulson were conscripted into a new team of Secret Avengers by Acting Director Maria Hill. The parameters of the team’s status quo were that each member of the squad would have their memories erased after each mission. On one of those brainwashed field outings, Fury led the team in preventing an assassination attempt on the President and recruited Taskmaster (Tony Masters) to work undercover inside the organization known as Advanced Idea Mechanics, A.I.M.\n\nLater, then Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Daisy Johnson was suspended after a failed Secret Avengers mission involving A.I.M. Scientist Supreme Andrew Forson, leaving teammate Mockingbird (Bobbi Morse) stranded on A.I.M. Island. Maria Hill was promoted to Director, with Fury becoming her right-hand man. Acting on intel from alleged A.I.M. defector M.O.D.O.K. (George Tarleton), the Secret Avengers ended up being captured in their attempt to rescue Mockingbird, though their mission was merely a sideshow in a strange, one-sided romance between M.O.D.O.K. and Director Hill.\n\nFury also befriended Wolverine, helping him stop a sentient virus of the Microverse from possessing and destroying Earth. He also welcomed the original Human Torch (Jim Hammond) into S.H.I.E.L.D. Later, he fought the Fury, a super-weapon on Misericordia—a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite—where he almost died in space when Coulson inadvertently stranded them in orbit. Though they’d already been very close friends for a long time, this near-death experience brought them even closer.\n\nOn another adventure, Fury was hypnotized by Dr. Mindbubble (Weapon LXI) into stealing the S.H.I.E.L.D. Hellicarrier Gungnir—which also turned into a giant robot—for the Iron Nail (Ran Shen), who used the mechanical monstrosity to try to spark an international war. Luckily, Fury’s old friend Captain America was there to stop Nail and help Fury break free from the spell.\n\nDuring Civil War II, Fury infiltrated a HYDRA cell posing as a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Going off of an interpretation of Inhuman profiler Ulysses Cain’s predictions, the cell’s attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. could have proven fatal. Fury wound up being attacked by fellow soldiers, who turned out to be agents loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. and not HYDRA deep cover as he originally thought. They weren’t double agents, just traitors. To figure out the source of their betrayal and to save himself, Fury faked his own death so he could continue his investigation without knives at his back.\n\nFury interrogated crooked S.H.I.E.L.D. benefactor Elton Blake and was directed to an abandoned base called Ulu, in Alaska. He wasn’t able to capture the mastermind there, after being caught off guard by the mystery villain’s speed, but he was able to infiltrate another base, where he downloaded massive quantities of data to figure out the enemy’s next move. He ended up at the Kratos underground base, where the Leader was revealed to be a rogue Life-Model Decoy of Fury’s father. The Leader revealed that the interpretation of Ulysses’ prediction wasn’t correct. It wasn’t about a rogue HYDRA cell, but that Fury’s next mission was going to cost him his life and if he decided against taking the mission it would end up with S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. The Leader intended to take Fury out, then take over the organization to reinvent it. Fury risked his own life to destroy the base."
