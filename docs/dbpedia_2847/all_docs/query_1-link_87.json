        "text": "Archbishop Vigneron to ordain transitional Deacons Ryan Asher, Tommy Ngo, Nicholas Brown, Matthew Kurt and Stephen Moening\n\nDETROIT — Five young men from the Archdiocese of Detroit will become the local Church's newest priests when Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron ordains them during a special liturgy at 10 a.m. May 18 at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDeacons Ryan Asher, 27, Nicholas Brown, 31, Matthew Kurt, 28, Stephen Moening, 27, and Phuc (Tommy) Ngo, 31, have completed their seminary studies and are prepared to receive the indelible mark of priesthood.\n\nDon't miss another story\n\nDid you know you can get Detroit Catholic's latest daily or weekly articles delivered to your inbox? It's easy and free to sign up.\n\nFour of the five transitional deacons finished their studies at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, while Deacon Asher has completed his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. The soon-to-be new priests' first assignments, recently announced, will begin July 1.\n\nThe ordination Mass, on the vigil of Pentecost, will be livestreamed on the Archdiocese of Detroit’s Facebook page, the cathedral's Facebook page, and at www.aod.org/livemasses.\n\nTo help the faithful of the Archdiocese of Detroit get to know them better, each of the men responded to a series of questions from Detroit Catholic, below.\n\nDeacon Ryan Asher\n\nAge: 27\n\nParents: Roy and Judy Asher\n\nEducation: University of Detroit Jesuit High School, Detroit; Hillsdale College, Hillsdale (B.A. in Mathematics); Sacred Heart Major Seminary, Detroit, (B.Phil); Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome (STB)\n\nHome parish: Our Lady of Good Counsel, Plymouth\n\nMasses of Thanksgiving: Our Lady of Good Counsel, Plymouth (Sunday, May 19, 12 p.m.); Most Holy Trinity, Detroit (June 9); Basilica Ste. Anne, Detroit (June 16)\n\nFirst assignment: Full-time priest support at Our Lady of Refuge Parish, Orchard Lake; Our Lady of Sorrows Parish, Farmington; Prince of Peace Parish, West Bloomfield; St. Andrew Kim Parish, Northville; and St. Fabian Parish, Farmington Hills; that form South Oakland Vicariate Family 7, effective July 1, 2024, serving primarily at Our Lady of Sorrows through the summer months, after which I will return to Rome in the fall to complete my final year of studies.\n\nHobbies: Playing and listening to music; reading; hiking; camping; road trips\n\nWhat were you doing before you entered the seminary?\n\nI entered seminary directly after undergrad at Hillsdale College. At Hillsdale I studied the liberal arts and received a mathematics degree, but committed most of my time and energy to campus ministry. On summers I waited tables and bartended at the now-closed Box Bar in Plymouth.\n\nWhen did you first start to think about the priesthood?\n\n“Knowing Jesus is the greatest gift we have ever received, that we have encountered him is the best thing that has happened in our lives, and making him known in word and deed is our greatest joy.” Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis) said that once, and I still think it is the best way to sum up my sense of God’s calling. I fell in love with the Mass in junior high when I would periodically go with my father to daily Mass. I had a deep sense from that age that something significant was happening in the Eucharist. I had a set of powerful experiences of faith in high school with the LifeTeen group at Our Lady of Good Counsel and weekend retreats with Eucharistic adoration and group sharing and discussion. These experiences convinced me that life without Jesus is dark and bleak, but that life with Jesus is another story. He changes everything by forgiving our sins and bearing our burdens. It was not until Hillsdale College where I had such joyful experiences doing campus ministry that I really sensed a call to the priesthood. My years in the seminary have confirmed God’s calling for me.\n\nWhat pastoral learning experiences made the greatest impact on you?\n\nCampus ministry in college, nursing home ministry and Communion visits while in seminary in Detroit, three weeks with the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India, and prison ministry. My time in India is probably still the most impactful, as I watched, learned, and was inspired by the Missionaries of Charity in how they went about their ministry with compassion, zeal, and strength of heart.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to after being ordained?\n\nTo worship Christ the Lord, especially in the mysteries of his Body and Blood, which we venerate at Mass. I pray that through my priesthood God will draw others into deeper love for the Eucharist. God has been so good to me by revealing His love, goodness, and power to me through the ministry of his priests. I pray that God might do the same for others through the gift of the priesthood.\n\nWhat do you think is the greatest challenge facing the Church today? What do you see as the solution to that challenge?\n\nPerhaps in the busyness of our lives, we have lost a sense of how to be human — truly human. St. Irenaeus says that the glory of God is man fully alive. That means that to be a saint is, on some level, simply to be fully alive, to be fully human, to be fully myself, in Christ, as he created me. We have to slow down a bit and acknowledge God’s presence.\n\nWhat kind of priest would you like to be?\n\n“I love you, O my God, and my only desire is to love you until the last breath of my life. I love you, O my infinitely lovable God, and I would rather die loving you, than live without loving you. My God, if my tongue cannot say in every moment that I love you, I want my heart to repeat it to you as often as I draw breath.” (St. John Vianney)\n\nDeacon Nicholas Brown\n\nAge: 31\n\nParents: Mark and Marla Brown\n\nEducation: Salem High School, Canton; Saint Louis University (B.A. in Theology and Computer Science); Sacred Heart Major Seminary, Detroit (B.Phil., hopefully M.Div. and STB)\n\nHome parish: St. John Neumann, Canton\n\nMasses of Thanksgiving: St. John Neumann, Canton (Sunday, May 19, 10:30 a.m.); St. Patrick, White Lake (Sunday, June 2, 12 p.m.); St. Isaac Jogues, St. Clair Shores (Sunday, June 16, 9:30 a.m.)\n\nFirst assignment: Priest in solidum at St. Damien of Molokai Parish, Pontiac; Sacred Heart Parish, Auburn Hills; St. Benedict Parish, Waterford; St. Hugo of the Hills Parish, Bloomfield Hills; and St. Thomas More Parish, Troy, that form South Oakland Vicariate 3, serving primarily at St. Damien of Molokai.\n\nHobbies: Reading, chess, sports\n\nWhat were you doing before you entered the seminary?\n\nI was a software engineer and a volunteer for my parish's youth group.\n\nWhen did you first start to think about the priesthood?\n\nI thought I might have a vocation to the priesthood after college, but I lacked confidence in that due to my belief that I would not be good at counseling people. Eventually in adoration I heard the Lord tell me, \"I want you to be my priest.\" I was overwhelmed by that moment thinking about the privilege of celebrating Mass, freeing people from their sins, baptizing them, etc. It was an incredible joy until I looked at everything I would leave behind. I doubted again. From that time I struggled to pray or hear anything from God. From the advice of my spiritual director, I went to a discernment weekend, but stopped asking whether I was called to be a priest or not. That lowered my guard enough so that when I walked on the track I heard the Lord tell me, \"The reason you have not heard anything from Me is you did not want to hear what I had to say.\" I knew I had to apply at that point, and I am overjoyed that I did. There have been many challenges, but my life has never been more blessed.\n\nWhat pastoral learning experiences made the greatest impact on you?\n\nGoing to St. Augustine-St. Monica while Msgr. Daniel Trapp was still alive and pastor was the most impactful experience for me. It was there I learned how to evangelize and that the Lord provides in all circumstances.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to after being ordained?\n\nI am most looking forward to celebrating Mass. The Eucharist is the source and summit of the faith, and what a great privilege to be the minister to make Christ's very substance present in the Eucharist!\n\nWhat do you think is the greatest challenge facing the Church today? What do you see as the solution to that challenge?\n\nI think the greatest challenge facing the Church is the massive number of people leaving the Church. I think broadly the answer is living a strong faith life and recreating a culture of evangelization in our parishes. As Archbishop Vigneron reminds us, God always gives us what we need. If we rely on God, all those things sort themselves out in time.\n\nWhat kind of priest would you like to be?\n\nI would like my priesthood to follow what St. John the Baptist said, \"[Christ] must increase. I must decrease.\" I want people to encounter Christ and for me to simply do my part as a member of the Body of Christ.\n\nDeacon Matthew Kurt\n\nAge: 28\n\nParents: Dan and Kris Kurt\n\nEducation: Salem High School, Canton; Michigan State University (Bachelor of Arts with a major in political theory and constitutional democracy); Sacred Heart Major Seminary (Bachelor of Philosophy, Master of Divinity and STB)\n\nHome parish: St. Thomas a’Becket, Canton\n\nMasses of Thanksgiving: St. Thomas a'Becket, Canton (Sunday, May 19); St. Fabian, Farmington Hills (Sunday, May 26)\n\nFirst assignment: Priest in solidum at St. Fabian Parish, Farmington Hills; St. Andrew Kim Parish, Northville; Prince of Peace Parish, West Bloomfield; Our Lady of Sorrows Parish, Farmington; and Our Lady of Refuge Parish, Orchard Lake, that form South Oakland Vicariate Family 7, serving primarily at St. Fabian.\n\nHobbies: Disc golf and laying outside on my hammock\n\nWhat were you doing before you entered the seminary?\n\nI entered seminary right after I graduated from Michigan State University.\n\nWhen did you first start to think about the priesthood?\n\nI first thought I might have a vocation around my senior year of high school and freshmen year of college. Going to daily Mass and adoration and also a priesthood discernment group helped. The associate pastors at St. John Student Center in East Lansing (especially Fr. Dan Westermann and Fr. Ryan Riley) helped me to see that priests are (relatively) normal and that the priesthood was a real option for me.\n\nWhat pastoral learning experiences made the greatest impact on you?\n\nBeing at St. Fabian the past two years and helping out at a local nursing home during that time. Also being in the Army Reserve as a chaplain candidate the past six years.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to after being ordained?\n\nCelebrating the sacraments.\n\nWhat do you think is the greatest challenge facing the Church today? What do you see as the solution to that challenge?\n\nIndifferentism. People seeing the radical love Jesus has for them.\n\nWhat kind of priest would you like to be?\n\nOne that reflects the love and care of our heavenly Father.\n\nDeacon Stephen Moening\n\nAge: 27\n\nParents: Mark Moening and Joanne Moening\n\nEducation: Livonia Stevenson High School, Michigan State University (1 year), Sacred Heart Major Seminary (Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Master’s of Divinity)\n\nHome parish: St. Kenneth, Plymouth\n\nMasses of Thanksgiving: St. Kenneth Parish, Plymouth (Sunday, May 19, at 2 p.m.); St. Frances Cabrini Parish, Allen Park (Saturday, May 25, at 5 p.m.); St. John Vianney Parish, Shelby Township (Sunday, May 26, 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.); St. Genevieve-St. Maurice Parish, Livonia (Saturday, June 8 at 5 p.m.); St. Cyprian Parish, Riverview (Sunday, June 9 at 9 a.m.)\n\nFirst assignment: Priest in solidum at Our Lady of the Lakes Parish, Waterford; St. Daniel Parish, Clarkston; and St. Rita Parish, Holly, that form the Northwest Oakland Lakes Vicariate Family of Parishes, serving primarily at Our Lady of the Lakes.\n\nHobbies: Hiking, camping, and bike riding\n\nWhat were you doing before you entered the seminary?\n\nBefore the seminary I was attending Michigan State University studying political theory. I had worked at a restaurant for five years and had been engaged in many activities at my home parish. I loved serving the less fortunate around me, especially with PBJ Outreach. Overall, I was slowly praying more, recognizing that I needed God in my life and that I loved spending time with Him.\n\nWhen did you first start to think about the priesthood?\n\nThe first time I felt a tug on my heart to consider the priesthood was when I was an altar server in the fourth grade. I saw the amazing work the priest could do — baptize, celebrate Mass and forgive sins — and I desired to do that, too. The thought quickly went to the backburner, and it was not until my freshman year at Michigan State that I actually began discerning this call. At Michigan State I felt that something was missing, that God was calling me to something different. I began to attend a group of other young men discerning the priesthood, and it was great to know I was not alone in this journey. It was through time in adoration and prayer that I heard God’s voice clearly calling me to check out the seminary and continue my discernment there. I also began to read the lives of some of the saints, specifically Blessed Solanus Casey, and I saw that these saints were normal people who simply followed God’s call for their lives. After some encouragement by some priests, I entered the seminary, and it has been a great journey with Jesus.\n\nWhat pastoral learning experiences made the greatest impact on you?\n\nThe pastoral experience that had the largest impact on my vocation was bringing Holy Communion to a homebound parishioner near the seminary when I was in my second year as a seminarian. Mrs. Lee was a very faithful and devoted woman who quickly became my adopted grandma and friend. I continued to visit her almost every week for an additional five years until she passed away. She became such a close friend that I actually preached her funeral as the deacon. To bring Jesus to someone who was truly alone, to bring our Savior to Mrs. Lee, was a profound gift.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to after being ordained?\n\nI am most looking forward to offering the sacrifice of the Mass. To unite all of our prayers and bring them to Jesus in union with His sacrifice is something so powerful. I still have not wrapped my head around it completely, and I probably never will. The Mass is the source and summit of our life, and to be able to preside in this moment is something I am very excited about.\n\nWhat do you think is the greatest challenge facing the Church today? What do you see as the solution to that challenge?\n\nI believe the greatest challenge facing the Church today is a misconception about holiness. Holiness is living out our vocation with God. It is not saying a certain formula of prayers or doing specific acts of devotion. Holiness is clinging to Jesus, walking with Him through our daily life and work. A solution to this is simply talking about our regular interactions with God. To speak of God as friend helps one understand how close He wants to be to us.\n\nWhat kind of priest would you like to be?\n\nI would like to be a priest who is available — a priest who is accessible to the faithful and who is able to walk with them through the great joys and the great struggles of life. I hope that my own love of Jesus is attractive to others, and that it helps people see that they, too, want a relationship with our Lord.\n\nDeacon Phuc (Tommy) Ngo\n\nAge: 31\n\nParents: Thoi Ngo and Tinh Phan\n\nEducation: Prospect High School, Saratoga, Calif.; UCLA (Bachelor in Biochemistry); Sacred Heart Major Seminary\n\nHome parish: St. Anthony, Belleville\n\nMasses of Thanksgiving: Our Lady of Grace, Warren (Saturday, May 18 at 6 p.m.); St. Daniel, Clarkston (Saturday, June 1, at 5 p.m.); St. Anne, Ortonville (Sunday, June 2 at 10:30 a.m.); St. Anthony, Belleville (Sunday, June 9 at 10:30 a.m.)\n\nFirst assignment: Associate pastor of Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish, Plymouth\n\nHobbies: Listening to music, reading Christian novels\n\nWhat were you doing before you entered the seminary?\n\nAfter college, I entered the trading market for a while, then I worked as a nail technician for a year.\n\nWhen did you first start to think about the priesthood?\n\nWhen I was 14, I was living in a Catholic boarding school. One person in charge of us asked me if I wanted to be a priest, and I said “yes,” but it was not for a good reason. I thought becoming a priest would be cool, and I would have a lot of privileges. However, when I came to America, the idea was no longer in my mind. After college, I was not happy with my life. I woke up every day feeling down, without a purpose. Long story short, one day a priest suggested that I should give priestly vocation a try. I ended up coming to a discernment weekend, and kneeling in front of the Eucharist one night there, I asked the Lord to help me with my prayer life because I did not like to pray at all. He struck my heart immediately, and I kept praying because it felt good. After a while, I realized what I felt was the love Jesus had for me, so I decided to follow Jesus from then on. From then, I was no longer lost because I have a clear purpose for my life.\n\nWhat pastoral learning experiences made the greatest impact on you?\n\nAll of my internships at the parishes had been very good for my priestly formation. It just shows how the Holy Spirit put us where we need and are needed most.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to after being ordained?\n\nJust to be with the flock Christ has given me to take care of.\n\nWhat do you think is the greatest challenge facing the Church today? What do you see as the solution to that challenge?\n\nI do not know what the greatest challenge is, but one of the big challenges is that people do not see what they are facing. A lot of them do not know that they are in pain, and they need to know that there is a Person who loves them just the way they are. Before, struggles such as war and famine were more real, and people felt the need to cling to God. Now, especially in the West, people do not feel the need for God. So, they are fighting something somewhat invisible.\n\nWhat kind of priest would you like to be?\n\nI want to be a fatherly shepherd that God created me to be. That is to serve people with my strengths and even my weaknesses.\n\nShare:\n\nCopy Permalink\n\nVocations"
