Her death was ruled a homicide as the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office found injuries resulting from an assault.\n\nThe case took a bizarre turn as videos emerged from an Instagram account linked to Mr Brown. Authorities had said they were investigating the authenticity of the posts, in which a man identified as Mr Brown claimed he was kidnapped by the FBI and that his mother was on vacation.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Maywood police determined that one of the videos was recorded in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. But when reached by The Independent, the department said that it had “no new details to share.”\n\nMr Brown’s brother Nick Brown announced on Facebook that their mother will be laid to rest on Friday, 29 September.\n\nSergio Brown burned mother’s clothes before she was found dead and he went missing, neighbour says\n\nThursday 21 September 2023 10:00 , Andrea Blanco\n\nFormer NFL player Sergio Brown allegedly burned his mother’s clothes before her body was discovered behind her Illinois home over the weekend, a neighbour has claimed.\n\nCarlos Cortez, a neighbour of Myrtle Brown’s, told WBBM that he had given authorities Ring doorbell video in which Mr Brown is allegedly seen burning his mother’s clothes.
