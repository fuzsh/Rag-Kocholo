        "text": "Former NFL player Jerry Brown Jr.'s mother said she is \"very happy\" the league reinstated Josh Brent after Brown Jr. died in a 2012 accident while Brent drove his car intoxicated, The Dallas Morning News' Brandon George reports.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NFL announced Brent has been conditionally reinstated and will be suspended for 10 games. He was convicted in January of intoxication manslaughter for the December 2012 car accident that killed his Cowboys teammate. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years' probation.\n\nStacey Jackson said she supports Brent's return to the NFL.\n\n“I’m very happy Josh has been reinstated with the Dallas Cowboys!” Jackson said. “My beautiful son is in Heaven now, and Josh has to be given a chance to live his life and do something for someone else! We all make mistakes, and we all have an entrance date and an exit day. Although I miss Jerry every day, I know he would be very happy that Josh has another chance to play football!”\n\nBrent will be eligible to practice after Week 9 and play in Week 11.\n\n- Paul Palladino"
