She worked at Subway and truly enjoyed it. Sarah would always have a smile on her face for every customer that walked through the doors and would always have compassion for her customers. She had a passion for animals, no matter what the breed or where Sarah would see them, she always had to love on them. Sarah especially loved her cats, Bella, Ezra, and Whiskey. Sarah loved board games and just driving around and exploring new things with her friends and family. Sarah’s most precious joy in life was her son, Jesse. She will be missed by all who had the pleasure of meeting her.\n\nSarah was preceded by her father, Frederick R. Brown, Jr.; sister, Freda Gayle Brown; grandparents, Clarence and Aulene Herron, Bill and Bell Kimbrough, and Frederick R. Brown, Sr.\n\nLeft to cherish the many memories include her loving husband of 4 years, Aaron Pierre; her adored son, Jesse Frederick Pierre; beloved mother, Gaytha Brown; brother, Nicholas Brown, mother-in-law, Marcy Pierre. A host of family and friends also survive.\n\nFamily and friends will gather from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday, October 4, 2022, at Higgins Funeral Home and from 1:00 p.m. – 2:00 p.m. on Friday, October 7, 2022, at Collins Burke Funeral Home in Jasper, Alabama.\n\nA Celebration of Life service will be conducted at 2:00 p.m. on Friday, October 7, 2022, in the chapel of Collins Burke Funeral Home.
