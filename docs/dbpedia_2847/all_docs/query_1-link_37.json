        "text": "My name is Nick Brown. I graduated from Florence High School in 2013, located in Florence Arizona. A Grey Shirt for Arizona State University. I was a 4 year starting Varsity All Purpose Athlete. I started on the Varsity Team in my Freshman year and worked hard ever year to maintain my spot on the team and eventually becoming The Captain. I was recognized in my Freshman year as 2nd Team All Region Honorable Mention, Most Valuable Player Underclassman and Best Athlete Award. My Sophomore year I was recognized as 2nd team all state RB and in the AZ Republic as Game Ball Player of the week and Most Valuable Underclassman. My Junior year, I was awarded Team MVP, 1st Team All State DB/RB and 2nd Team All Arizona-All Purpose Player and the highlight was I was the first commit to Arizona State University under Todd Graham. Finally in my Senior year I was recognized as All Arizona, 1st Team All State, MVP and was afforded the opportunity to play in the Canyon Coast Classic Game, Arizona vs California.\n\nI began playing competitive football at the age of 7 for NYSP (National Youth Sports Program) as well as ACYFL (Arizona Competitive Youth Football League). That is when I fell in love with football and each time I step on the field it happens all over again. My GPA was average but I put in work every day to improve. I believe it is important to be excellent in the classroom as well at on the field.\n\nI am a recent High School Graduate of 2013 Class, 5 feet 9inch, 190 pounds and still have a lot of growing to do. I am the younger of 2 siblings. I have very supportive parents and an entire village of family and friends that keep me grounded and focused. My best compliment given to me by others: \"Nick is a respectful and courteous gentleman both on and off the field\". Today I look forward to competing at the next level. I have worked hard to perfect my skill on the football field and I would like the opportunity to play at the next level .\n\nI anticipate football will be apart of my college life, as I am working hard towards that goal. Please consider my film and bio as you search for your next student/athlete. I am eager to make contact with you SOON!\n\nNick Brown #25"
