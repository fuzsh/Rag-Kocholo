        "text": "Bobby Brown has broken his silence in the wake of his 28-year-old son Bobby Brown Jr.'s death, after Bobby Jr. was found in his Encino, California home on Wednesday.\n\n'Please keep my family in your prayers at this time,' the Every Little Thing singer said in a press statement Thursday. 'Losing my son at this point in our lives has devastated my family. There are no words to explain the pain.'\n\nBobby Jr.'s death came about five years after the death of his half-sister Bobbi Kristina and eight years after his stepmother Whitney Houston drowned in a bath.\n\nPolice rushed to a 'medical emergency' at his home at 1.50pm on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear Thursday what the cause of death was or who called for help but police say they do not think foul play was involved.\n\nBobby Jr. is the second child R&B singer Brown has lost after the death of his daughter with ex-wife Houston, Bobbi Kristina, who was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2015 at the age of 22.\n\nBobby Kristina's 'adopted brother', Nick Gordon, with whom she had a controversial relationship before her death, also died in January this year.\n\nThree years before their daughter's death, Houston drowned in a bathtub after taking cocaine and Xanax.\n\nShe and Brown had a tempestuous 15 year marriage that was plagued by drug abuse, violence and infidelity.\n\nBobby Jr. is one of Brown's seven children. He has not commented on his son's death.\n\nHe was his second child with Kim Ward, with whom he had an 11-year relationship around the same time he was with Houston.\n\nShe tweeted today: 'The heavens gained an angel but I lost my soulmate.'\n\nBobby Jr. was Brown's second child with Kim Ward, a childhood friend with whom Brown had a tumultuous 11-year relationship.\n\nWard gave birth to Bobby Jr. less than a year before Brown and Houston had their daughter Bobbi Kristina in 1993, their only child together.\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Ward had complained that Houston never liked Bobby Jr. because of how close together their children with Brown were born.\n\nShe told the Boston Magazine that Houston 'has a problem with little Bobby.'\n\n'There'll be times she'll call me,' Ward said. 'She'll be like, 'Oh, well, can LaPrincia come down to spend time with Krissy (Bobbi Kristina) while we go to such and such?' Hello?\n\n'No! He has another kid here, too.' Ward said.\n\nWard's relationship with Brown was fraught over child support payments before the deaths of Houston and Bobbi Kristina.\n\nIn 2007, Brown was sentenced to 30 days in prison for failing to pay $20,000 to Ward for their two children, LaPrincia and Bobby Jr.\n\nHe spent three nights in a cell before a radio station paid the debt.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Brown was also sentenced to jail in Massachusetts for failing to pay child support. In both cases he paid up.\n\nFollowing his half-sister's death in 2015, Bobby Jr. reacted furiously to those who started following him on social media.\n\n'People really don't give a f**k about you unless you're relevant,' he wrote in a since-deleted tweet. 'And they don't love you till you're famous or gone. I don't want these follows. Your follows ain't gonna fill the hole in my heart, and y'all gon unfollow me once you stop caring.'\n\nBobby Jr's death is the latest tragedy to befall 51-year-old Brown whose marriage to Houston from 1992 to 2007 was plagued by drug abuse, domestic violence and infidelity.\n\nHouston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in February 2012.\n\nThe 48-year-old had drowned as a result of cocaine use and heart disease, the coroner wrote.\n\nAlso in her system were Benadryl, Xanax, cannabis and Flexeril.\n\nThree years later, the couple's 22-year-old daughter Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in the bathroom of her home in Georgia.\n\nShe died in a hospice six months later following catastrophic brain damage from being submerged in the water.\n\nIt was suspected that Bobbi Kristina may have been injured by her ex-boyfriend Nick Gordon during a domestic argument, but he was never charged with anything related to the incident.\n\nThe Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office later determined that she died from being immersed in water and drug intoxication that led to pneumonia, however, medical experts were unable to rule whether her death was 'due to intentional or accidental causes.'\n\nBobbi was buried two days later next to her legendary mother at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey.\n\nIn late 2016, Gordon was found liable in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the conservator of Bobbi Kristina's estate, Bedelia Hargrove, and was court-ordered to pay a total of $36 million in the case.\n\nIn January 2020, Nick Gordon died from a heroin overdose.\n\nLast year, Brown paid tribute to Bobbi Kristina while touting the foundation launched in honor of her death.\n\n'Today we recognize the first annual Bobbi Kristina Day - July 26th, 2019. We miss you so much Babygirl,' he captioned post.\n\n'Every day I hold you close to my heart,' Brown began in the message that was illustrated with a picture of Bobbi Kristina and some butterflies.\n\n'I think about so many of the things you used to do, from a little girl to a beautiful young lady. I just smile! It reminds me of how much I miss my little girl more and more every day.\n\n'So loved and so missed.'\n\nThe former New Edition star then shared about his family starting The Bobbi Kristina Serenity House, a non-profit that offers resources to victims of domestic violence, and how it's 'doing great things to help others in need, the way you would have if you were here.'\n\n'Krissi, on this special day, we honor you, we love you and we shine a light on your memory,' he concluded.\n\nBrown, a Boston native, reached fame with the group New Edition and for his 1988 solo album 'Don't be Cruel.'\n\nHe starred in his own television show, 'Being Bobby Brown,' but the show was cancelled in 2007 after Houston stopped appearing.\n\nLast year, it was reported that Brown had been removed from a JetBlue flight at Los Angeles International Airport for 'being drunk.'\n\nBrown was allegedly involved in an altercation shortly before takeoff to Boston while the plane was still at the gate.\n\nEveryone was asked to deboard and Brown was pictured speaking with police officers in the terminal."
