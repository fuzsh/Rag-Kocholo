        "text": "Serving Portsmouth, Chesapeake, Suffolk, VA & Surrounding Areas\n\nWelcomes You\n\nWelcome and thank you for visiting Sturtevant Funeral Home's website. We hope this allows you to get to know a little about us and how we have been serving the community for over 130 years as an independent, family owned and operated business. Our family understood in 1883 the need to have family by your side, and it's been a tradition that's been passed down five generations. At Sturtevant, we haven't forgotten what families need in times of loss.\n\nWe adhere to the highest standards and offer affordable services. Whether families choose traditional services or cremation, we try to give families many different options. We have our own crematory. It is important to us that your loved one is never out of our care as opposed to those who don't do the cremation themselves.\n\nWe also offer receptions with different levels of food service in our new offsite Event Center just steps away. We constantly strive to provide services to meet the needs of the families we serve.\n\n- William R. Gardner\n\nOwner, William R. Gardner and son, Robie Gardner"
