        "text": "Biographical Notes:\n\nThe best history of the Brown brothers, particularly John and Moses, is captured by author Charles Rappleye in his new book Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the Revolution (Simon & Schuster, 2006). Another useful source book regarding John Brown and his brothers is The Browns of Providence Plantations-Colonial Years, by James B. Hedges. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1952.\n\nThere were six children of James Brown (1698-1739) and Hope (Power) Brown (died 1792);\n\nJames Brown II (1724-1751),\n\nNicholas Brown (1729-1791),\n\nMary (Brown) Vanderlight (1731-1795),\n\nJoseph Brown (1733-1785),\n\nJohn Brown (1736-1803), and\n\nMoses Brown (1738-1836)\n\nAccording to Rappleye (p17) their father James Brown, a sea merchant, was grievously injured during a weight lifting contest and died of his wounds a year later in 1739. After the death of their father the five boys were tutored in aggressive business tactics by their paternal uncle, Obadiah Brown (1712-1762), who owned a successful chocolate factory, candle factory, and was heavily involved in coastal merchant trading. During the 1750s, he became the first Providence merchant to trade directly with England, bypassing the traditional mercantile cities of Boston and Newport. The oldest of the five, James, Jr, died in 1751 at the age of 27 of undetermined causes while in York, Virginia.\n\nThe four surviving Brown brothers (Nicholas, Joseph, John, and Moses) were jingled as \"Nick and Josie, John and Mosie\". The initial key to the Browns' business success was a spermaceti candle works; such candles being popular at the time as burning cleaner and brighter than other candles of the day. According to William Arnold Greene in The Providence Plantations for 250 Years (1886), p.53, Dr. Vanderlight, who had married their sister Mary, had introduced to the Brown family the Dutch process of extracting spermecetti from the brain matter of whales. Using capital provided by Obadiah, Dr. Vanderlight and the Browns developed this thriving chadelry industry. After the death of their Uncle Obadiah in 1762, they also formed Nicholas Brown and Company for their shipping and commercial activities. That was the business that grew large and complex, and quickly became one of the most successful businesses in the English colonies. Rappleye's book chronicles an unsuccessful slaving venture sponsored by the Browns with the Sally in 1764. Details of the voyage of the Sally, as well as original source documents, and more information about the Brown brothers' involvement in slavery are found at Brown University's Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice. John split off from this company in 1771 and went independent of his brothers in the shipping-mercantile trade, but he continued in shared business interests with his brothers, one of which was a iron foundry called the Hope Furnace. From: http://web.bryant.edu/~history/h364proj/sprg_97/pease/millhist.htm (Link Stale 2006)\n\nFounded [in 1765] by the Brown Brothers (Nicholas, Joseph, John and Moses) and co-partners in the business, Stephen Hopkins, Israel Wilkinson, Job Hawkins, and Caleb Arnold. This was an iron furnace producing, initially tea kettles, hollowware, nails, hinges, and iron hoops; but in 1775-1783 produced guns and canons cast for the Revolutionary War. The furnace structure was hearth and stack made of stone and located on the Pawtuxet River south of Salmon Hole. The river provided power for bellows and the surrounding woodlands were used for charcoal. Local farmers provided the stone that was heated and melted with the ore that came from the Oaklawn Avenue area in Cranston. The ore, charcoal, and limestone were carted uphill in horse-drawn wagons.\n\nAbout 75 men were employed there as founders, colliers (coal miners), wood choppers, molders, firemen, carters and coalers of wood, diggers and carters of ore. These workers were paid poorly receiving about 1/4 of their pay in goods from the company store. By 1768 the Furnace was producing pig iron which was sold in England in exchange for English goods. 76 cannons were cast for the war effort. One remains in front of the Hope Library. In 1806 the furnace mill was sold at auction to Silvanus Hopkins and Jabez Bowen and became the Hope Manufacturing Company, a cotton spinning mill. This mill was located in the village of Hope, at the southwestern corner of Cranston with Scituate to the west, and West Warwick to the south.\n\nAccording to a letter between his grandsons, from John Brown Herreshoff to John Brown Francis 2Apr1939, these cannon were then transported to John Brown's boring mill at India Point in Providence for finishing. Brown provided some of his cannon at the beginning of the Revolution to local militia groups, such as the Pawtuxet Rangers, to provide artillery power at land fortifications designed to protect against an anticipated British assault up the river to Providence\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, John Brown continued his mercantile business, but we do have references that he was more active in the patriot cause than heretofore has been popularly surmised. We know he was an active member of the Providence branch of the Sons of Liberty (See Lovejoy, David S. Rhode Island Politics and the American Revolution, 1760- 1776, p120-121), and of course was also involved in cannon manufacturing at the Hope Furnace in Scituate. In January of 1774 he was appointed to the Committee of Correspondence for Rhode Island. In 1775 John Brown sold his 110 foot sloop, Katy, to the fledgling Rhode Island Navy, with which, fellow Gaspee raider Abraham Whipple harassed British ships in Narragansett Bay. When the succeeding Continental Navy was formed, the Katy was it's first ship, renamed the Providence. Brown's shipyards apparently also received contracts to provide some ship building for the Navy, at which some young men were apprenticed when they took part in the attack on the Gaspee. He's also noted to have been running a fleet of privateer ships from Providence out along the East Coast during the Revolution. Field, Edward, State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations at the End of the Century: A History. Boston, Mason Publishing Co. 1902., Vol II p 424 cites John Brown as the owner of the privateersmen Hawke, Polly, Diamond, Sally, Favorite, and Retaliation in 1776; Providence, Happy Return, and Friendship in 1779; Argo, Adventure, Betsey, Harbinger, and General Washington in 1780; Brig Hope in 1781; Sally and Insurance in 1782; and Snake Fish in 1783. According to William P. Sheffield, An Address Newport, Sanborn, 1883, p60, he also owned the Marlborough in 1777\n\nDon D'Amato, writing in the Warwick Beacon, February 24, 2005, \"Rogues, Rascals, & Gallant Heroes: John Brown (2): Revolutionary leader\", relates that John Brown was unhappy with the lack of success of American General John Sullivan during the 1778 Battle of Rhode Island, and publicly criticized him. This led to a scalding rebuttal by General Nathanael Greene:\n\nAccording to The Papers of General Nathanael Greene, edited by Richard K. Showman, Greene, in defending the action on Aquidneck Island in 1778, wrote, I cannot help feeling mortified that those that have been at home making their fortunes, and living in the lap of luxury and enjoying the pleasures of domestic life, should be the first to sport with the feelings of Officers who have stood as a barrier between them and ruin. Brown quickly apologized to General Sullivan, saying, Disappointed persons will always, especially at the moment of misfortune, say harder things than they would at any other hour. Brown, according to editor Showman, more than made up for the criticism by serving on the committee of the Assembly and the Town of Providence to thank Sullivan for his efforts.\n\nAccording to D'Amato, in Warwick Beacon, March 3, 2005, \"Rogues, Rascals, & Gallant Heroes: John Brown (3): So very clever\"\n\nBrown also had the keen business sense to realize that war was imminent and that whoever supplied war materials would make a great deal of money. Brown was a master at this. He had built up reserves of gunpowder and had his Hope Furnace produce materials necessary for war.\n\nCharles Rappleye in his new book Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the Revolution (Simon & Schuster, 2006, p210), concludes that:\n\nAs the war progressed, many fortunes were lost in Providence and throughout America, but John only prospered. At the outset of the war he owned or shared interest in more than seventy-five ships, and while many were lost to the enemy-ten were seized in 1777 alone-John more than covered his losses with prize ships and returns from trade. Combined with earnings from the Hope Furnace and from his contracts with Congress, John managed to turn the war into a personal bonanza.\n\nWhile John Brown seemed to have profited quite nicely from the Revolution, in all fairness, one cannot easily extract the patriotic interests from the economic interests back in that time. They often were one in the same, and there really wasn't a sense of unity or country to be Patriotic to, until after the Revolution was completed.\n\nThere were, in fact, several John Browns that were prominent in the patriot cause There was also a John Brown 1744-1780 that actually studied law for a time in Providence, but returned to the Berkshire region and became an active patriot. In late February 1775, this John Brown was dispatched by Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren, and others as a secret emissary to Quebec and Montreal with letters inviting the Northern provinces to join with the unifying 13 colonies to the South. Upon his return south, this John Brown fell in with Ethan Allen, Benedict Arnold, and the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont and helped plan and lead the attack on Fort Ticonderoga at the very beginning of the Revolutionary War on May 10th, 1775. We conclude, however that William Wells in his book Life and Public Services of Samuel Adams, (1888, p 276), wrongly attributed the actions of this John Brown to our John Brown of Providence that we speak of here. Also, there was no relationship between our John Brown, and the more famous John Brown who was hung for his abolitionist raid at Harper's Ferry prior to the Civil War.\n\nOf the four Brown brothers, it was John, whose picture is shown to the left, whose wealth showed the most. The picture of John Brown is a miniature by Edward Greene Malbone, and is the only known likeness of John. However, some of the clothing he wore survives, and from this we can estimate him as being over six feet in height and over 250 pounds in weight. Both items can be seen in the John Brown Mansion tour. See http://www.rihs.org Donaldson in A History of the Adirondacks writes that John Brown was known to be of average height, but to weigh in at a portly 300 pounds. Former Mayor of Providence Walter R. Danforth writing in \"Pictures of Providence Past, 1790-1890\" edited by Clarkson Collins in Rhode Island History, January 1951 recounted:\n\nIn stature, John Brown was of medium height, but when I knew him was fleshy and rather unwieldy in movement and might be observed riding daily in all the business portions of the town in a one horse sulky, driving bargains and personally superintending all the branches of his affairs at the counting house, at his stores, at the shipyard, on the wharves, at the bank, and wherever his business operations called. He had a peculiar voice....[sometimes imitated by employees].\n\nHe was the most conspicuous of the brothers in terms of being known as a merchant. He concentrated on the shipping trade, and his wealth was built partly on the triangular trade involving slaves and trade with the West Indies islands. John Brown's long career as an entrepreneur, privateer, and China trade merchant made him one of the most prominent men in Providence. He owned large rum and gin distilleries located at India Point, which name is taken from the 'India trade' he developed, (see RI History article on this). His purchase of a large tract of land in the Adirondack area of Northern New York after the Revolutionary war was part of a vision of what could be done by investing in land, but it eventually cost his children their wealth.\n\nHis work in the slave trade, also known as the Triangle trade, caused dissension within the Brown family. It is important to remember that younger brother, Moses Brown, the famous abolitionist and Quaker leader, converted to Quakerism and the antislavery philosophy later in life. The Brown brothers were all born as Baptists. Also, there is no connection between our John Brown of 1736-1803 and the more famous abolitionist John Brown of the pre-Civil war era. In fact, our John Brown was well known to have been engaged in the slave trade as part of his business pursuits. There is evidence that John Brown personally held slaves employed at his spermiceti works, his distillery, the Hope iron works, and in his residence. John also is noted for his spirited defense of slavery in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, to which he was elected in 1800. \"We want money; we want a navy; we ought therefore to use the means to obtain it....Why should we see Great Britain getting all the slave trade to themselves?--Why may not our country be enriched by that lucrative traffic?\" The American Slave Trade, p116.\n\nhttp://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt3.html\n\nIn the economic realm, the famous Brown family of Providence rose to new financial, commercial, and industrial heights, surpassing in stature even the celebrated merchants Aaron Lopez, Joseph Wanton, and Christopher Champlin in Newport and James D'Wolf of Bristol. The resourceful Brown brothers -- Nicholas (1729-91). Joseph(1733-85), John (1736-1803), and Moses (1738-1836)- guided by uncles Obadiah (1712-62) and Elisha (1717-1802), laid the groundwork in this turbulent age for the remarkable commercial and industrial advances of the early national period.\n\nFrom: Papers of the American Slave Trade, Series A: Selections from the Rhode Island Historical Society\n\n<http://www.lexisnexis.com/academic/guides/Aaas/amsltr0102.pdf> Page 7:\n\nOn August 5, 1797, John Brown, the premier merchant and first citizen of Providence, Rhode Island, reluctantly entered federal district court in his hometown and became the first American to be tried under the U.S. Slave Trade Act of 1794. After months of out-of-court wrangling with the plaintiffs, officers of a state abolition society, it appeared that Brown would now stand trial for fitting out his ship Hope for the African slave trade. The voyage had concluded profitably a year earlier in Havana. Cuba with the sale of 229 slaves.\n\nBrown's accusers included his younger brother, Moses, a tireless opponent of both slavery and the slave trade...\n\nAccording to D'Amato, in Warwick Beacon, March 3, 2005, \"Rogues, Rascals, & Gallant Heroes: John Brown (3): So very clever\", however, \"a sympathetic jury refused to convict such an 'eminent citizen and noted patriot'\" During his dealings in this detestable trade, John Brown apparently used some of the same tactics of intimidation previously used during the attack on the Gaspee. <Ibid, Page 8>:\n\nAfrican merchants and their influential supporters simply intimidated all potential bidders and then repurchased their ships for a fraction of their assessed value. To end such bogus sales-at-auction. the government in 1799 sent Samuel Bosworth, surveyor of the port of Bristol, to bid for the D'Wolf family's recently condemned schooner Lucy. Twice within twenty-four hours of the scheduled sale, John Brown and two D'Wolf brothers, the country's largest slave traders, visited Bosworth at home to dissuade him from his duty. Despite a threatened dunking in Bristol harbor, Bosworth \"with considerable fear and trembling\" arrived at the wharf on auction morning where he was met by a party of local \"Indians'' in unconvincing native garb and with faces blackened. No Bristol version of the patriotic tea party ensued, fortunately. Instead, Bosworth's captors hustled him aboard a waiting sailboat and deposited him two miles down the bay at the foot of Mount Hope. The government never employed that strategy again.\n\nIn his book, The Browns of Providence Plantations-Colonial Years, James B. Hedges professed the belief that the John Brown and his brothers had largely given up running the triangular trade by the time of the attack on the Gaspee in 1772 and the subsequent Revolution. But given Brown's continued activities in sending ships to Africa, intimidation of Federal agents enforcing anti-slavery laws, and his ardent defense of slavery through his term in Congress, this is an erroneous assumption. Perhaps Hedges may have been handicapped by a destruction of records associated with Brown's involvement with slavery trade in an effort to make such information undiscoverable during his trial in the 1790s. Letters have resurfaced, now kept at the Brown University Library/Brown Digital Repository that make clear his continued role in the slave trade. John Brown was a distiller of both rum and gin, which makes economic (but not moral) sense of his continued involvement through 1795.\n\nThe Providence Gazette on June 12, 1772 printed a list of appointments to various city positions and we find the name of John Brown assigned as one of four \"Valuers of Estates\" (A position he held through 1801) and also to Fire Engine Co. No 1, along with his brother Joseph and others. In June of 1777 he was elected under the Whig Party to the Rhode Island General Assembly as a Representative from Providence and served until 1787. He was later appointed as President of the Ftd. In 1787 he was appointed as one of the \"Overseers of the New Hospital\".\n\nRappleye in Sons of Providence relates that in May of 1784 John Brown was elected to Congress, but chose not to serve. Instead he invested heavily in a cod fishing fleet.\n\nIn June 1788 he was on a committee formed to celebrate the Independence Day, and to further promote the adoption by Rhode Island of the US Constitution. Rappleye (p276) indicates John Brown used outright bribery to influence the adoption by Rhode Island of the new Constitution in 1790. We note from the Providence Gazette of Sept 1, 1798 that John Brown handily defeated his opponent Thomas Tillinghast for the position as a US Representative to Congress. From: Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774-1949, page 900\n\nBROWN, John (uncle of Benjamin Brown and grandfather of John Brown Francis), a Representative from Rhode Island; born in Providence, R.I., January 27, 1736; engaged in mercantile pursuits; one of the party which destroyed the British sloop of war Gaspee in Narragansett Bay June 17, 1772; sent in irons to Boston for trial, but released through the efforts of his brother Moses; laid the cornerstone of the first building of the College of Rhode Island (now Brown University) May 14, 1770; trustee of Brown University, Providence, R.I., 1774-1803; treasurer 1775-1796; member of the State house of representatives 1782-1784; chosen as a Delegate to the Continental Congress in 1784, but did not serve; elected as a Federalist to the Sixth Congress (March 4, 1799-March 3, 1801); resumed his former business pursuits; died in Providence, R.I., September 20, 1803; interment in the North Burial Ground.\n\nAccording to First Baptist Church historian Dr. J. Stanley Lemons, John Brown was an original member of the Charitable Baptist Society, agonized c 1770 to fund and build the First Baptist Church meeting house that still stands today. He was a pew owner, but never a baptized member of the Church as was his father and brother Joseph. The First Baptist Church at this time was of the Particular Baptist variety, and one had to undergo a revelation into the faith, something John never experienced, or never bothered to experience. He resigned his membership in the Charitable Baptist Society after a falling out over the adoption of abolitionist principles by fellow church members in 1790.\n\nJohn Brown was intimately involved with Rhode Island College, now Brown University. The land where the college is situated was all originally owned by Chad Brown, John Brown's great-grandfather. From Bayles, Richard M. History of Providence County, Rhode Island, New York, 1891. Page 518: \"In 1770 the foundation of University Hall, the oldest of the college buildings, was laid. The ceremony of laying the corner stone was observed on the 14th of May, the honor of placing it being conferred upon John Brown.\" In August 1776 he was elected Treasurer of the College. He also donated some 1400 volumes to the original library at the College, and gave dinners to students during commencement activities (ibid pg 517). This was all when the original institution was still named Rhode Island College. It was later renamed Brown University in 1804 in honor of the philanthropy of the Brown brothers John, Joseph, Nicholas and Moses, as well as nephew Nicholas Brown. John Brown was treasurer of the University between 1775 and 1796.\n\nWe also note that it was John Brown who was the founder and first president of Providence Bank in 1791, which later grew through many mergers and acquisitions to become banking industry giant, Fleet Bank (recently acquired by Bank of America)-Providence Journal, October 28, 2003, p1. In 1795 he was the largest stockholder in a new theater venture in Providence. According to claims put forth by the Masonic Order, John, Joseph, and Moses were all active members of the St. John's Lodge Number 1 Providence Free and Accepted Masons (Providence Evening Bulletin, Letter to the Editor, June 7, 1966). It should be pointed out that the Masons make many such claims of leaders of the American Revolution.\n\nRight: Sailing of the General Washington, 1787, by R. H. Ives Gammell, mural c1950. Click to enlarge.\n\nFrom Bayles, Richard M. History of Providence County, Rhode Island, New York, 1891, page 393: Brown Street on the East Side of Providence was named in honor of John Brown. John Brown greatly revered the American leader George Washington, naming at least two ships for him as well as the bridge, which in later reincarnations, and to this day, carries the first President's name. From the same source, page 400:\n\nWashington bridge crosses Seekonk river at India point, and is supposed to have derived its name from a wooden statue of (George) Washington that adorned a bridge occupying this site, which was built by John Brown in 1793. The bridge and statue were carried away by a freshet in 1807. (See RIHS artifact description)\n\nBrown's admiration of Washington extended to almost unbelievable heights. One of the rooms in John Brown's mansion house was (and still is) decorated in wallpaper depicting scenes of Washington's inauguration in New York in 1789. Only six prints of this wallpaper were ever made, one of which is displayed at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. According to Capt. Nat Herreshoff--the Wizard of Bristol by L. Francis Herreshoff, (1953), John Brown contributed substantially enough to the Revolution that George Washington presented Brown a portrait of the General and Martha Washington that later hung in Nate Herreshoff's house.\n\nLeft: Eliza of Providence, a ship owned by the firm of Brown & Ives.\n\nFrom: Ships and Shipmasters of Old Providence, Providence Institution for Savings, 1920, p19:\n\nThe Duke of La Rochefoucauld-Llancourt in waiting of his travels through America in 1795-97 said: \"The richest merchant in Providence is John Brown, brother of Moses Brown, the Quaker. In one part of the town he has accomplished things that, even in Europe, would appear considerable. At his own. expense he has opened a passage through a hill to the river, and has there built wharfs, houses, an extensive distillery, and even a bridge by which the road from Newport to Providence is shortened by at least a mile. ... At his wharfs are a number of vessels, which are constantly receiving or discharging cargoes. .\n\nAccording to Herreshoff, (1953), John Brown's original home at 37 South Main Street was the site of a lavish dinner held in the honor of General Nathanael Greene in 1787. The October 11, 1788 edition of the Providence Gazette carries an account of a fire, that had started in the kitchen of his house, completely consuming the that had been occupied by four families. Luckily, only one person was slightly injured when jumping our a window. Not the John Brown would ever have been put out on the street in the event of this fire for he owned several houses at the time.\n\nThe John Brown Mansion (shown at right) is the centerpiece of the RI Historical Society holdings. This brownstone-and-brick mansion, was designed by his brother Joseph Brown (1733-1785) for John, and was built between 1786 and 1788 and has been restored as a museum. Note that Power Street, at which the house stands, was on land owned and named after John Brown's mother's Power family. According to Don D'Amato, Brown cleverly cashed in on some hard-to-collect debts owed him by advertizing to his debtors the ability to pay of their notes by furnishing lumber and other building materials for the mansion. From: Historic Houses of Early America by Elise Lathrop. New York: Tudor Publication Company, 1927. Page 237:\n\nJohn Quicy Adams called this \"the most magnificent and elegant private mansion that I have ever seen on this continent.\" The house is substantial, three stories in height, built of bricks brought from England in the builder's own ships, and finished with mahogany from San Domingo. His architect brother, Joseph, planned it. Set high above the street, with lawns shaded by great elms, and a terrace extending along one side, solid mahogany gates admit to the grounds, and the handsome main entrance with its portico is surmounted by a beautiful window on the second story.\n\nFrom the 1770 List of Providence Taxpayers we get the following long list of Brown families:\n\nBrown Allin I A 1\n\nBrown Chad III D 5\n\nBrown Esec III A 2\n\nBrown George I A 2\n\nBrown George XI D 4\n\nBrown Elishas Brick House VI C 4\n\nBrown Elishas Home VI C 4\n\nBrown Elishas Mill VI D 1\n\nBrown Hope III B 3\n\nBrown Isaac VI C 2\n\nBrown James Widow Hope III B 5\n\nBrown John III B 5\n\nBrown John III B 6\n\nBrown John VI B 4\n\nBrown John VI C 4\n\nBrown John VI C 4\n\nBrown Joseph III B 5\n\nBrown Molly III A 4\n\nBrown Moses III A 3\n\nBrown Moses III B 5\n\nBrown Nathaniel House see William Brown III B 1\n\nBrown Nicholas III B 5\n\nBrown Obadiah, Widow III A 4\n\nBrown Richard, Jr. VI C 5\n\nBrown William III B 1\n\nBrown Zephaniah XI B 5\n\nAccording to Capt. Nat Herreshoff--the Wizard of Bristol by L. Francis Herreshoff, (1953), he owned the six properties at that time; three on North Main Street on the East Side and three just north of that location. The waterfront estate on Bristol's Poppasquash Point was acquired by John Brown in 1781 through the previous Vassall family having been of the Tory persuasion during the Revolutionary War. The Rhode Island Assembly had confiscated the property and transferred title to John Brown in payment for funds he had fronted for the Revolution.\n\nFrom John Brown's Tract: Lost Adirondack Empire by Henry A. L. Brown and Richard A. Walton, Rhode Island Historical Society, 1988, we also know that he also held other impressive farm lands, including a home in Gloucester, RI, and his country residence at Spring Green Farm in Warwick. The 640 acre waterfront farm at Spring Green, purchased from the Greene family estate in 1782, just so happened to include Gaspee Point, where the infamous Gaspee had run aground and was burned by John Brown et al. in 1772. In talking (2004) to descendant and historian Henry A. L. Brown, however, it is very much doubted that this fact inspired John Brown to buy the land. Rather, it was a case where the Greene family had become destitute, and Brown was able to obtain the valuable land at a bargain price.\n\nJohn Brown's children all became accomplished. According to Donaldson in A History of the Adirondacks the daughters Abby, Sally, and Alice were all versed in harpsichord, and later in piano when John Brown bought the first such instrument to be seen in the State. His grandchildren referred to John Brown as \"Old Thunder.\"\n\nIn the twilight of his life, John Brown got caught up in land speculation in the Adirondack area of Upstate, New York. Despite intense efforts on his part, John Brown and his sons-in-law were never able to turn a profit and the affair ended in misery for those involved See John Brown's Tract: Lost Adirondack Empire, by Henry A.L. Brown and Richard A. Walton, RI Historical Society, 1988 and also A History of the Adirondacks by Alfred Lee Donaldson, Vol 1 New York: The Century Company, 1921. According to Clarkson Collins in \"Jame's Brown's Dairy\" Rhode Island History, [October 1947], John Brown and his family owned 20 shares in the Ohio Company, a land speculation and settlement investment group for the Ohio wilderness. His ex-apprentice, Elkanah Watson, may have tipped him off to this investment, for the purchase of land along any envisioned construction of the Erie Canal serving Lake Erie would've tied into nice profits. He was grievously injured in a carriage upset late in his life, and required many months to recuperate. After failing health, John Brown died on his Spring Green estate on 20Sept1803 of \"dropsy\", now known as congestive heart failure.
