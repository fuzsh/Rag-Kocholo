This includes mistaking his wife for Elizabeth Leids.\n\nMany genealogies have claimed that Nicholas married second Frances (Unknown) Parker. This seems to originate from a mistranscription of \"Brown\" instead of \"Bowrn\" in Austin's 1887 Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island, which is likely a spelling of \"Bourne\". Instead Frances looks to have married Jared Bourne. See the Research Notes below, the Research Notes on Frances' page and the G2G discussion.\n\nBiography\n\nNicholas Browne was born about 1615, giving his age as \"sixty five or thereabouts\" in a deposition dated March 31, 1680.[1] He first appeared on Aquidneck Island in 1638, and would have been about 23 by this approximate birthdate.\n\nHe was presumably born in England. His origin is currently unknown.\n\nHe was described as \"Husbandman\" in his will, and was probably primarily a shepard. At the time of his death he had, among a few other types of livestock, 57 sheep and 23 lambs.[Inventory]\n\nPortsmouth\n\nNicholas was admitted to Aquidneck Island on 27 June 1638 (27th: 4th 1638) as \"Nicholas Browne\".[2] The first record of him at Portsmouth specifically was on 30 April 1639, when he put his mark next to \"Nicholas Brownes\" on the Compact of Loyalty.[3] Later that year it was recorded that \"Nicholas Browne doth dismisse himself of [hi...] the government heare\"'.[4][5] His name is partially crossed out on the Compact of Loyalty, perhaps related to this.\n\nIt's evident that Nicholas did not leave Portsmouth, or if he did, then not for long. On 4 November 1640, John More was granted eight acres adjacent to Nicholas Brown, and on 7 April 1641 John sold all his land at Portsmouth to Thomas Burton. Nicholas Browne witnessed this deed, signing with his mark. On 31 March 1680, Nicholas Browne (\"of Portsmouth\") testified that he was the subscribing witness to this 1641 deed, and that his land was adjacent to John More.[1] Futhermore, when earmarks were recorded in 1668, Nicholas' earmark was recorded stating that it was \"twenty Nine yeares standinge\".[6]\n\nNicholas probably married his wife about the time he arrived in Portsmouth, say betwen 1638 to 1641, and had his children at Portsmouth.[Family]\n\nNicklus Browne of Aquidnecke sold to John Wickes land next to Samuel Hutchinson, possibly sometime before 3 March 1640[/1] when John Wickes sold land to Samuel Hutchinson. Those records were recorded in 1703 and the first deed was not dated.[7] On 1 March 1643, the town of Portsmouth made order that Nicholas Browne was to receive 20 acres of land, possibly due to a previous grant being lost - the page is partly distroyed.[8] At a quarter session held at Newport, 3 December 1643, \"Nicholas Brown paying Chardges is acqted his Indicment\".[9] On 4 Februray 1646, 20 acres was granted to him by the town adjacent to his other 20 acres.[10]\n\nOn 1 March 164[9]/[50] (the date is \"sixtene hundreth fortie n[ ]\" - probably 1649, and probably old style), Nicholas Browne of Portsmouth sold to John Woode Senior of Portsmouth, 45 acres lying in Portsmouth on the border with Newport.[11]\n\nNicholas Browne appeared on the roll of freeman at Portsmouth in 1655.[12]\n\nNicholas Browne of Portsmouth sold to Thomas Wood eight rods of land on 6 Februray 1656[/7].[13] Ten (and more?) acres of his land were mentioned in a 1657 record. Though that record is damaged, it was probably a list of lands owned at Portsmouth.[14] It may be related to the 10 December 1657 meeting when 300 acres of the town were divided. Nicholas \"Brownes\" recieved 6 acres at that time.[15]\n\nOn 29 July 1659 Nicholas Browne of Portsmouth sold to William Cadman five acres.[16] At a meeting at Portsmouth 8 August 1659, it was \"Ordered that Jeames Badcooke shall be paid nine shilenes and six penc out of the Treshrey for Charges in the Case of Nicholas Browne\".[17] Recorded on 13 November 1668 was \"The Eare mark of Nicklas Browne Senyor his Cattell is a slitt downe one both Eares and no more of twenty Nine years standing\".[6]\n\nGeorge Parker had sold Nicholas Browne 20 acres of land at Portsmouth, however had died before the deed was written. His son Joseph Parker, acknowledging this, wrote the deed on 28 December 1669. Notably he mentions \"with the consent of my mother Frances Bowrn [sic] who was the Wife of my Deceased Father George.[18]\n\nOn 31 March 1680, Nicholas Browne of Portsmouth made a deposition (age given as \"sixty five years or therabouts\") with regards to witnessing a 1641 deed.[1] On 23 April 1693/4, Nicholas (or perhaps his son) was granted 12 acres of land by the town, and he paid £4-20 for it on 15 March 1693/4.[19]\n\nNicholas Brown, husbandman of Portsmouth, made his will 16 November 1694.[20] He died a month later, 17 December 1694 at Portsmouth.[21]\n\nProbate\n\nNicholas Brown made his will 16 November 1694, and named his grandson Tobias Brown as executor.[20] He died 17 December 1694 at Portsmouth.[21] An inventory of his personal estate was taken 26 December 1694,[21] and his will was recorded 27 December 1694.[20]\n\nHis personal estate was valued at £104-14-02, and was sworn to by Tobias Brown, grandson and executor on 27 December.[21]\n\nRecord of the payments Tobias made to the other heirs was recorded. On 3 July 1701, Martha \"Recieved of my brother Tobias Brown executor to my Grand father nicholas Brown... the full and just sum of Thirteen pounds current money of new England and About Twenty pounds of feathers.[22] On 29 October, Jane Rogers (and her husband John Rogers) quitclaim unto Tobias any amounts owed them from the estate.[23] About the same time his \"Aunt Jane Babcock\" recieved ten pounds from him.[24]\n\nWill\n\nThis transcription of Nicholas' will was transcribed from the copy written in the Portsmouth Land Evidences book:[20]\n\nIn the name of God Amen this sixteenth day of november in the year of our Lord one Thousand six hundred nintie four: I nicolas Brown of the Town of Portsmouth in Rhode Island in the colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations a husbandman: being but weakly in body but of perfect mind and memory praised be God, and calling unto minde the mortality of my body, and knowing that it is appointed for man to dye to make and ordaine this my Last Will and Testament in a manner and form following, that is to say, first and principally I give my Soul into the hands of God who gave it me: and for my Body I command to the Earth to be buried in decent manner: nothing doubting but at the generall Resurrection I shall Receive the same againe by the mighty power of God And as touching such wordly Estate wherewith it hath pleased God to bless me in this Life I give bequeath and dispose the same in manner and form following:\n\nFirst I give and bequeath to my Eldest son nicolas Brown five shillings silver money.\n\nItem I give and bequeath to my son Abraham Brown five shillings silver money.\n\nItem I give and bequeath to my Daughter Jane Badcock ten pounds silver money.\n\nItem I give and bequeath to my two Grand Daughters martha and Jane Browne being the Daughters of my son William Brown (Deceased) to Each of them ten pounds silver money and to Each of them A bed and blankets: All which aforesaid Legacies to be faithfully and truly paid by my executor hereafter named, and within three years after my Deceas.\n\nItem, I give and bequeath to my Grand Son Tobias Brown son to my aforesaid son William Brown Deceased, All my Lands and houses which I have on Rhode Island and Collony aforesaid to him his heirs and Assignes forever\n\nItem I give and bequeath to my said Grand Son Tobias Brown all my neat cattle, all my sheep horse kind and hogs, And also I give him all my carts plows chains and Implements Likewise\n\nItem I give and bequeath to my said Grand son Tobias Brown all my corn and hay: and also all my pewder brass Iron provissions aparrell and beding that is not before disposed of: and whatsoever else that is properly mine And of this my Last Will a̶n̶d̶ ̶T̶e̶s̶t̶a̶m̶e̶n̶t̶.\n\nI make and ordaine my said Grandson Tobias Brown my full and whole Executor: and I do hereby utterly Revoke and annull all and Every other Testaments Wills Legacies bequeaths and Executors by me in any wise before this time named Willed and bequeathed Ratifirring and Confirming this and none other to be my Last Will and Testament In witness whereof I have hereunto Set my hand and seal the day and year above mentioned.\n\nsigned and sealed in the presence of\n\nthe mark\n\nof Nathaniel [his mark] Potter,\n\nthe mark\n\nof John [his mark]Baley\n\nElias Williams\n\nnicolas [his mark] Brown [seal]\n\nInventory\n\nNicholas' original inventory survived and was placed into the Portsmouth Scrapbook. His inventory was taken 26 December 1694, and stated that he died 17 December 1694.[21] A summation of the estate comes to a total of £111-14-2, £7 more than the official tally.

He and his wife married probably about the time he arrived at Portsmouth in 1638. It's unknown if his wife was related to any of the other colonists, or if they married in England.\n\nThe order of his children is taken from his will, and the ages are approximate guesses. William was presumably the youngest, as his children are mentioned last in Nicholas' will, though this isn't necessarily the case. William was at least 21 in 1669 when he was a freeman. Presumably Nicholas Jr. and Abraham were both over 21 when they settled in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. It's probable that some or all of them were a year or more older then below listed:\n\nNicholas, eldest son, b. say 1642, settled in Shrewsbury, N.J. 1665\n\nAbraham, b. say 1644, settled in Shrewsbury, N.J. 1665\n\nJane, b. say 1646, m. James Babcock (b. 1641) bef. November 16, 1694\n\nWilliam, b. abt/bef. 1648, freeman 1669, d. bef. March 1681\n\nIt does not appear that Nicholas married second Frances (unknown) Parker, the widow of George Parker. See notes below.\n\nSome printed genealogies / pedigrees claim, without source, that Nicholas was the father of Thomas Brown. While Thomas was the right age to be such a son, he would have been Nicholas' oldest son and heir; yet no such son is named in Nicholas' will.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nA brief biography and genealogy about him appears in Historical and Genealogical Miscellany, and Little Compton Families.\n\nThe records at the town of Portsmouth were damaged some time before the transcription made in 1901. As such a number of records from there relating to Nicholas are incomplete.\n\nFor Future Investigation:\n\nA \"Tobias Brown\" with no further record is mentioned as member of a Jury at Portsmouth in Februray 25, 1642[/3].[25] Nicholas had a grandson name Tobias, though it's unknown if there was any relation between Nicholas and this older Tobias.\n\nNicholas may have been influenced by Quakers, as his sons Nicholas Jr, and Abraham removed themselves from Portsmouth to early New Jersey Quaker Colonies.\n\nAt a General Court of Tryalls held at Newport May 6, 1667: \"An Answer to the peticon. of Elizabeth Browne wife of Nicholas Broune the Court doe advise Mr William Baulston and Mr Samuell Wilbur or Either to take course in the matter according as it shall be further made apeere for the maintaininge of the sayd Elizabeth out of her husbands Estate soe as the Toune of portsmo may be freed of charg\".[26] This Elizabeth was either the wife of Nicholas Sr. or Nicholas Jr. - both of their first wife's name is unknown, and may have been living at this time. Considering that Nicholas Jr. was a colonist in Shrewsbury, N.J. about this time, it's probable that this was a record of his first wife.\n\nDiscrepancies with Prior Information:\n\nNicholas' date of death is recorded on his original inventory.[21] The day is written numerically, and has been transcribed elsewhere as \"14\". A comparison of the numbers of the page to this date show that it was actually a \"17\". The 7's on the page have a hook on the top left edge, and are written in a single motion. The 4's on the page have an open top, and are written in two motions.\n\nThe only (known) primary source that Nicholas married second Frances Parker was the deed by Joseph Parker to Nicholas Brown. Austin, in his Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island, wrote that Joseph Parker \"[mentioned] his mother as Frances Brown\".[27] An examination of the 1669 deed copied into the Land Evidence (the whereabouts of the original deed is unknown, if it still exists) mentions Nicholas as \"Browne\" in all three occasions that his name is written (the record was copied into town record on December 15, 1704 along with other records to do with Nicholas' estate - in the other copied, records all dated 1701, the name is always \"Brown\"). However the line Austin refers to was actually recorded in the town book as: \"Joseph Parker with the consent of my mother frances Bowrn who was the wife of my Deceased father George\".[18] Notably one of the deed witnesses was signed (with a signature) by \"Jared Bourne\", who was a resident at Portsmouth. It's more plausible that \"Bowrn\" was a spelling of \"Bourn\" by the clerk (the letters \"u\" and \"w\" often being interchangeable in contemporary writing) than the clerk making a typographical error (misplacing the 'r' and omitting the 'e' compared to all other \"Brown\"s on the page). Notably Jared Bourne was married to a Frances by 1665, suggesting that it was a spelling of \"Bourne\".
