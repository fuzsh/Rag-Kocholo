Brown, Sr. and Thelma Mae Brown.\n\nA private memorial is planned for a later time. The family is especially grateful for the outpouring of care and love Jay D. received from Specialty Services staff: Tina Hillis, Michael Vaughn, Heather Evans, Kelley Atchley, DJ Dennis, and Scottie Hunt. The family requests your continued prayers."
