        "text": "KALAMAZOO, MI -- The man who shot his 4-year-old son and then his ex-girlfriend before turning the gun on himself was bringing the boy back home after an overnight visit, family members told police.\n\nNicholas Mitchell Jr. shot his son, Nicholas Mitchell Jr., 4, then shot his ex-girlfriend and son's mother, Julina Gibson, in the early morning of Nov. 9 before shooting himself. Police responded to find the three lying on the sidewalk in front of 117 E. Emerson St., where Gibson and her son lived with Gibson's family. Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety officers found a .22-caliber pistol in Mitchell Jr.'s right hand.\n\nDetails of the murder-suicide are included in more than 70 pages of police reports the Kalamazoo Gazette received Friday from the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nGibson and Mitchell Jr. died shortly after the shooting, and the boy died later that day after undergoing surgery at Bronson Methodist Hospital.\n\nA neighbor told police he saw two people arguing on the sidewalk in front of the home as he drove by minutes before the shooting.\n\nDistraught family members arrived at the scene. At the hospital, family members of Julina Gibson were screaming and threatening police, said KDPS PSO Ernst Knauf.\n\nLinda Newkirk, Julina Gibson's mother, told police Mitchell had kept his son the night of Nov. 8 and refused to give him back to his mother. He arrived at the Emerson Street house with his son early Nov. 9 because the boy had to go to school.\n\nNewkirk's boyfriend, Robert Simpson, said he heard gunshots, then heard Julina Gibson yelling \"Help.\" He told police he looked out the window and saw Gibson holding her son, then saw Mitchell shoot her about three times from two feet away. He said about 30 seconds later, Mitchell shot himself.\n\nAutopsies showed Gibson was shot three times in the torso and Mitchell shot himself twice in the head.\n\nSimpson said Gibson and Mitchell had dated for a long time but the relationship turned bad about two years ago. He said Mitchell had threatened to kill Gibson and her brothers. Simpson acknowledged the custody dispute Gibson and Mitchell had where Gibson was given full custody and Mitchell was given visitation rights.\n\n\"Since that time things had settled down and Simpson believed everything was 'fine,'\" KDPS Det. Jon Schipper wrote.\n\nWhen asked why Mitchell would do this, Simpson said \"he owes back child support and probably thought that if he couldn't have them then no one could.\"\n\nOne of the bullets pierced a window in the first floor of the house.\n\nKalamazoo public safety officers interviewed Mitchell's father, Nicholas Allen Mitchell Sr., and his girlfriend, Laurie Brown, whom Mitchell had been living with on Carr Street in Kalamazoo. They told police Mitchell and Gibson had not been getting along and said Mitchell was upset about the child custody arrangement because he was only allowed to see his son once a week."
