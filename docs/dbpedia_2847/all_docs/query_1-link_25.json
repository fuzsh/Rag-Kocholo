        "text": "Although I have no definitive proof, I feel I have come across enough evidence through documents and shared family papers (thanks to the generosity of various Brown researchers) that I can piece together a family of siblings whom I believe to be children of Nicholas Brown, Jr. and his wife Eleanor (maiden name unknown) of St. Mary's County, Maryland.The children were born in the 1770's through the 1780's, to the best of my knowledge, and all seem to have migrated to central Kentucky in the early years of the 1800's, settling in Bullitt, Nelson, and Shelby Counties.I feel that the father Nicholas (s/o Nicholas Brown, Sr. of SMC) may also have lived in Kentucky for a few years, but again, have no definite proof that the Nicholas Brown I have encountered there ca. 1809-1810 is the right man.The following listing is a grouping of the individuals I believe to be members of this family.I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has further information to help prove, or even disprove, these relationships.The information I have is too lengthy to include with this posting, but I would be glad to discuss it with anyone who is interested or has questions:\n\nDescendants of Nicholas Brown, Jr.\n\n1 Nicholas Brown, Jr. b: in St. Mary's County, Maryland d: Aft. 1798\n\n.. +Eleanor --\n\n.. 2 John Barton Brown b: 06 Mar 1775 in St. Andrew Parish, St. Mary's County, Maryland d: Oct 1842 in Shelby County, Kentucky\n\n...... +Malinda Neale b: Abt. 1779 m: 23 Oct 1801 in Washington County, Maryland d: Aft. 1860 in Kentucky\n\n....... 3 Elizabeth Eleanor Brown b: Aft. 1801 d: 1849 in Cooper County, Missouri\n\n........... +Preston H.
