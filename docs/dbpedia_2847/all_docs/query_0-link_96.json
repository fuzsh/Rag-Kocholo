(Elliker #214) The new publisher, EFM speculates, is Rev. Alexander Clark who edited Clark's School Visitor. This magazine had been published in Pittsburgh during 1859 and part of 1860 before removing to Philadelphia in spring 1860. Clark had previously republished \"Massa's in de Cold Ground\" (Dec.1859) and tried to republish \"Gentle Annie\" with permission of Firth, Pond. They also published a nostalgic school lyric to \"Uncle Ned\" and one to \"Nelly Bly\" (EFM 523ff)\n\nMay 31 Bank draft \"$50. Warren, O, May 31, 1860 / One day After Sight / Pay to the order of M.

New York.\" (Elliker #171).\n\nJune Clark's School Visitor issue prints letter from Stephen, dated May 2, 1860, Pittsburgh. (The May issue was published in Pittsburgh by J.W. Daughaday & Co. The June issue was published in Philadelphia by Daughaday, Hammond & Co). Foster's letter is a contract for a one-year arrangement, renewable, for songs for each alternate issue of the School Visitor. (EFM 526f)\n\nJuly Clark's School Visitor publishes \"Jenny's Coming O'er the Green,\" the first song Stephen wrote for them under contract (EFM 527)\n\nJuly 1 Stephen drawn ahead at Firth, Pond, & Co. $1,396.64 (JTH)\n\nJuly 21 \"Jenny's Coming O'er the Green\" entered for copyright by Lee & Walker, Philadelphia (CE II 427). Song first appeared in Clark's School Visitor vol.4 no.10 (July, 1860) published by Daughaday & Hammond but not entered for copyright. This issue begins an association between the publisher and Foster.CE: It seems unlikely that the O'Henry like twist at the end of the third verse is Foster's idea. His ms book shows no revisions & he sold the song outright so there was little incentive to revise it after publication.\n\nAug Clark's School Visitor announces Lee & Walker's reprint of \"Jenny's Coming O'er the Green. John Mahon later recalls Stephen telling him about its history, alluding to a 17-year old girl, and Jane's objections that caused him to change the first line and title (EFM 527)\n\nAug. 9 Expiration date of Feb. 9, 1858, contract with Firth, Pond & Co. (JTH), providing that Stephen should publish exclusively with that firm. Under this date Stephen sold all his rights in songs published under that contract (16) for $1,600, thus repaying the amount drawn ahead ($1,396.64) and gaining a credit of $203.36. \"He had agreed to publish exclusively with Firth Pond until that date, but the royalties coming from his songs were so small that Stephen was anxious to have other publishers also produce his music. Perhaps he felt that Firth, Pond were not giving his songs sufficient backing and advertising.\" Stephen kept \"very accurate accounts\". He was overdrawn and in debt \"for no other reason, in my opinion, than because he had practically abandoned the type of song he was best equipped to write, the Southern Negro melody.\" (EFM 520)\n\nAug. 10 Stephen apparently still in Warren. Presumably took his wife and daughter to New York after this date (JTH). \"Before leaving for New York, he sent to Firth, Pond in 1860, \"Poor Drooping Maiden,\" \"None Shall Weep a Tear for Me,\" \"The Wife; or He'll Come Home,\" \"Under the Willow She's Sleeping,\" probably \"Cora Dean,\" and one good song, \"The Glendy Burk\" (EFM 520)\n\nAug.25 \"Beautiful Child of Song\" entered for copyright by Daughaday & Hammond, Philadelphia (CE II 428) [see also Oct.6, 1860]\n\nSept Clark's School Visitor carries ad writer's \"raptures\" over Stephen's \"None Shall Weep a Tear for Me,\" published by Firth, Pond, and plumping \"Glendy Burk\" (EFM 527f)\n\nFall Mary Wick weds Lieutenant George H.
