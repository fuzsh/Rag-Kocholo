        "text": "Bobby Brown’s 28-year-old son, Bobby Brown Jr., has died.\n\nBrown Jr. was found dead at his Los Angeles-area home Wednesday, according to TMZ. Foul play was not suspected, the outlet reported.\n\nThe younger Bobby was the son of Brown, 51, and Kim Ward, with whom Brown had an 11-year off-and-on relationship.\n\nThe loss is another tragedy for the New Edition star, who lost 22-year-old daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown in 2015, three years after her mother, Whitney Houston, was found dead in a hotel bathtub.\n\nBobbi Kristina’s ex-fiancé Nick Gordon, who was found legally responsible for his former partner’s death, also died earlier this year.\n\nThree days after his sister’s death, Brown Jr., also an aspiring musician, spoke out on Twitter about people who flocked to follow him.\n\n“People really don’t give a f–k about you unless you’re relevant,” he wrote in a since-deleted thread, “and they don’t love you till you’re famous or gone. I don’t want these follows. Your follows ain’t gonna fill the hole in my heart, and y’all gon unfollow me once you stop caring.”"
