        "text": "Raise your hand if you've tied your personal identity to your work üôã‚ôÇÔ∏è Ok, lower your hand. Raise your hand if you've seen a colleague/peer/friend/classmate etc doing well and start to question if you're doing enough in life üôã‚ôÇÔ∏è Ok, lower your hand again... Tomorrow we're doing a session on mental health with Kara Hardin (hosted by Daniel J. Murphy) in Exit Five - specifically your professional identity vs. who you are outside of work. Kara Hardin is the Founder and CEO of The Practice Lab. She is a mental health educator, Registered Psychotherapist, and former practicing corporate and securities lawyer. We are going to discuss: ‚û° How we come to treat our work as our identities ‚û° Ways to separate and ground your sense of worth (regardless of your productivity) ‚û° Practices to navigate the emotional ups and downs of being between jobs, overworking in your role and feeling the need to be perfect in your life To attend, you need to be an Exit Five member, but if you‚Äôre interested in joining, you can use the code ‚ÄúKARA‚Äù when you sign up for a membership. DM/comment if you have questions.\n\nThis May, as we observe Mental Health Awareness Month, I encourage you all to take a moment to pause and reflect‚Äînot just on your well-being but also on that of your friends, loved ones, colleagues, and even those you may not know well. It's important to remember that we each face our challenges, and a little support can go a long way. Arianna Huffington once said, \"We need to accept that we won‚Äôt always make the right decisions, that we‚Äôll screw up royally sometimes - understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it‚Äôs part of success.\" This is a vital reminder as we navigate the complexities of the workplace and our careers. For those of us on LinkedIn, whether you're in the throes of a job search, navigating challenges at work, or just starting in your career post-graduation, remember to prioritize your mental health. To anyone currently unemployed, keep faith‚Äîthere truly is light at the end of the tunnel. If you're feeling stuck in your current role, remain persistent in seeking opportunities that fulfill you more deeply. And to the recent graduates stepping boldly into your careers, prioritize your mental well-being from the start. Together, let's support one another, foster resilience, and build a community that recognizes the importance of mental health in every aspect of our professional and personal lives. Please feel free to share this message or repost it within your network. By spreading awareness, we can help destigmatize mental health issues and support each other in more meaningful ways. Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going‚Äîyour share could be the sign of support someone needs today. #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawarenessmonth\n\nIn the world of high-flying careers, there's an untold story. On the surface, things might look impeccable: promotions, business successes, and a polished professional image. But what's happening behind closed doors? In recent times, I've come to realise that the pressure to maintain this facade is immense. Leaders are often seen as infallible figures who navigate through challenges without breaking a sweat. However, beneath this veneer of success lies a reality faced by many‚Äîa battle with mental health issues. It's important for us to acknowledge that mental health struggles do not discriminate based on one's professional achievements or status. From directors to interns, the burden of mental health can weigh heavily on anyone. The stigma attached to these issues only exacerbates the problem, making it difficult for individuals to seek help or even talk about their experiences openly. I firmly believe it's time we changed this narrative. We need to create environments where transparency about mental health is encouraged and supported. Let‚Äôs advocate for mental well-being in our workplaces and communities by initiating open discussions and providing access to resources. It‚Äôs crucial we understand that acknowledging vulnerability isn't a sign of weakness but rather an act of courage. Remember, it's perfectly human to seek help and support when you need it most. Let us strive towards fostering a culture where no one has to suffer in silence because they're afraid of judgment or repercussions at work. It‚Äôs about time we normalised conversations around mental health in every boardroom and break room across industries.\n\nThis might surprise you, but after nearly two decades juggling career and family, I still don‚Äôt have all the answers. It‚Äôs rarely about being physically present; the real juggle is mental, especially when facing setbacks. Despite now building my own dreams as an entrepreneur, the mental load can still weigh heavy. Yet, embracing new beginnings, igniting creativity, and showing my kids the realm of possibilities make it easier to lift that weight and share open, heartfelt talks with my amazing children. It‚Äôs perfectly okay not to have it all figured out. If the weight of your work‚Äôs mental load is becoming too much, maybe it‚Äôs time for a change. Let‚Äôs explore how you can lighten that burden. üîî RIng the bell on my profile and follow for insights on transforming your professional path and embracing the joy in every step. I‚Äôm Carrie Lahr, former Nurse and Healthcare Executive, here to help professional women whose work has taken over their life. Let‚Äôs find freedom and flexibility creating a dream life. I coach women to make choices that serve them and their values, building additional income streams to stop trading their time for money.\n\nI never thought a trip to see my therapist would turn into a lesson on survival and intuition, but life has a funny way of teaching us when we need it most. You won't believe what happened to me yesterday. There I was, stopped at a red light, and out of nowhere, the car in front of me decided to reverse right into me. Before I could even process what happened, one two three four... five men got out and began circling my car. I knew there could be damage. I should have gotten out and at least asked for a driver's license or taken a picture of the license plate. But something didn't feel right. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I had at least a dozen cars around me, but in an instant, the road was empty. No one stopped; no one helped. Great time to feel completely isolated. Right? And something inside me just said; \"Drive. Don't stop\" As I raced from the scene, feeling like I had committed a crime, I kept an eye out to make sure I was not being followed. Then the weirdest thing happened. A black butterfly danced past my windshield. You see I have been struggling with my mental health a lot lately. It's ironic because I promote mental health awareness to all my candidates who are battling through the job search. I am deeply passionate about helping people find work. Yet I have been grappling with the feeling that I am just giving false hope. Despite my best efforts, I can't secure jobs for everyone who needs one and that reality weighs down on me. Am I even making a difference at all? It's strange, but having to make that split-second decision... it showed me that sometimes you have to trust that little voice in your head. It's there for a reason. It‚Äôs all about the unexpected challenges, isn‚Äôt it? How we handle them, what we take from them, that‚Äôs what defines our path forward. But seeing that butterfly, it gave me the thought that maybe I‚Äôm on the brink of something new. Just maybe I can allow myself to have hope. After what happened, it felt like a sign, of new beginnings or some kind of change perhaps? Guess only time will tell.\n\nIt‚Äôs what I fear most right now: A collective loss of compassion In my conversations this week with clients and organizations I work with, there was a resounding familiar refrain: ‚Ä¢ What do we do? ‚Ä¢ Should I approach our CEO? ‚Ä¢ What should our email say ? ‚Ä¢ Should we post about this? ‚Ä¢ Should we give people time off? Each and every one of these well meaning wonderful humans had one thing in common: they all expressed to me that were not in any way personally affected and didn‚Äôt know anyone affected by this. 1) There is only one playbook here - be a good human. Do what FEELS RIGHT and do it quickly. 2) Check with your employees in a human way. Meet with them in the smallest of groups and create opportunities for 1:1‚Äôs 3) Approach Ownership & CEO‚Äôs ‚Äî they must step up as leaders and stand up, stop waiting for the RIGHT thing to say or do, focus on compassion. 4) Communicate - town halls, emails of support; remind everyone of your support channels, link mental health support systems AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT: üòû Ignore this. üòû Assume everyone is okay because YOU haven‚Äôt heard anything yet. üòû Insist on business as usual. üòû Wait for your competition to show you the way ‚Äúwhat has ___ done/said?‚Äù ü§¶üèº‚ôÄÔ∏è üòû Tolerate ANY lack of compassion by ANY member of your organization. By contrast the conversations I am having with clients, businesses and friends who ARE affected is this: We need awareness. We need support. We need to know our organizations care and are trying to understand. And the most heartbreaking conversation came from a C level HR: ‚ÄúI am Jewish and I am afraid LA. No one in my organization is speaking about it, they are looking at me differently, acting differently around me and at the same time asking ME what we should do. Our whole organization rallied around BLM, Ukraine and 911 in hours, I didn‚Äôt have to explain why or how, we just all understood the need for compassion. I‚Äôm broken.‚Äù üíîüíîüíîüíîüíî Your people are not ok.\n\nHaving a clear vision for your life is essential to achieving your goals and living a fulfilling life. Without a vision, you may find yourself wandering aimlessly without direction, feeling unfulfilled or stuck in an unsatisfactory situation. In contrast, having a clear vision for your life provides a roadmap for where you want to go and what you want to achieve. A clear vision helps you identify your priorities and focus on what is truly important to you. It allows you to make decisions that align with your values and goals, and avoid distractions that can lead you off course. Furthermore, a vision provides motivation and inspiration to keep you going, even when faced with obstacles or setbacks. However, developing a vision for your life can be challenging. It requires self-reflection, careful planning, and a willingness to take risks. It may also involve making difficult choices and sacrifices along the way. But the reward of living a life that aligns with your vision is well worth the effort. In conclusion, having a vision for your life is crucial to achieving your goals and living a fulfilling life. It provides clarity, direction, motivation, and inspiration to help you stay on track and achieve your dreams. So take the time to reflect on what's important to you and create a vision that will guide you towards the life you truly desire.

Being able to intersect my passion and background in mental health advocacy with my knowledge of adventure disciplines, preparation, and outreach was a dream I hope to continue pursuing. Here are some takeaways: 1. Our brains are meant to keep us alive, not to keep us happy. When we are out in nature, we are encountering situations that our brains and nervous systems are evolutionarily more programmed to confront. 2. Our brains and nervous systems have not yet evolved to cope with the level of technology we use on a daily basis. Our stimulation levels are being overwhelmed by stimuli to which we're trying to adapt, but it's still crucial to maintain a balance of stimulation as it originates from the natural world around us. 3. You might feel extra pride when you complete a challenging work project, or get that raise. Have you ever felt pride, though, at hiking to the top of a mountain or being able to think clearly while witnessing a bear cross your path? The latter forms of challenge, I would claim, are more generalizable to improving your confidence and resilience levels versus the other way around. Starting a fire in the rain? Navigating off-trail with a map and compass? Facing these kinds of adversities make that excel sheet then feel like a piece of cake. 4. Nature can provide immense grounding opportunities. Again, with the amount of technology consumption, our nervous systems and brains can feel very frayed. While nature can incorporate stressful situations, in can conversely provide us with the emotional regulation we need. Barefoot on the grass, the sound of water, hugging a tree. Connection to the earth is connection to ourselves, really. 5. There are so many metaphors that include nature and adventure, and activities that can derive from these. If you were a season, what would you be? What animal or element? What does your favorite national park say about you? Hoping for more of these presentations in the coming year. To more adventure!"
