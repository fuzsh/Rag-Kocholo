Nicholas BROWN (1601 – 1694) was Alex’s 10th Great Grandfather; one of 1,024 in this generation of the Miller line.

We have five separate Brown lines and seven different Brown immigrant ancestors, by far the most of any surname. When the surname is of English origin it is derived from a nickname concerning the complexion of an individual, or the colour of their hair. Brown is derived from the Old English brun, brūn; Middle English brun, broun; or Old French brun.

Nicholas Brown was born in 1601 in Inkberrow Parish, Wychavon, Worcestershire that is often thought to be the model for Ambridge, the setting of the long running radio serialisation or soap opera The Archers. In particular ‘The Bull’, the fictional Ambridge pub, is supposed to be based on a very real pub, the Old Bull, in Inkberrow. It is at this historic public house or wayside inn, a black and white half-timbered building, that William Shakespeare is reputed to have stayed while on his way to Worcester to collect his marriage certificate. His parents were Edward BROWN and Jane LEIDS. He married Elizabeth LEIDS in 1624 in England. After Elizabeth died, he married widow Frances Parker. Nicholas died 16 Nov 1694 in Reading, Middlesex, Mass

Elizabeth Leids was born in 1605 in Malford, Worchester, England. Her parents were Thomas LIDE and Jane GIBBS. It’s not known what exactly was her relationship with Nicholas’ mother Jane Leids. Some sources say that Elizabeth’s older sister married the father of Elizabeth’s husband which sounds incestous to me, even if Jane was Edward’s second wife. Other sources say that Thomas Lide and Jane Gibbs were Jane’s parents and Nicholas’ grandparents. Elizabeth died 1 Nov 1674 in Reading, Middlesex, Mass.

Children of Nicholas and Elizabeth: I don’t have documentation of the location of the births of these children. It appears Nicholas maintained a connection to both Lynn and Reading in the 1640’s.

Nicholas Browne of Reading is not the same person as Nicholas Browne of Haverhill nor Nicholas Browne of Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

Nicholas a native of Inkberrow, Worcestershire, England. He may have come to Lynn as early as 1630, but he first appears in New England records in March, 1638, when he is one of the 100 planters who received grants of land in the “Six-mile Grant”, of Lynn, Massachusetts.

Nicholas received 210 acres, one of the largest grants. Many of the grantees did not occupy the land, but sold it to others. Nicholas did live on his land however, and he was active in the affairs of Lynn until 1649. He served as Lynn’s representative to the General Court, on various juries, and on the Essex County Grand Jury from 1641 to 1649.

Sometime during those years, he moved his family to Reading, where he had also received several grants of land. His last two children are recorded in Reading, in 1640 and 1647, although Nicholas and his wife belonged to the church in Lynn until 1663. From 1651 on, Nicholas also took an active roll in Reading. He was chosen to fill various rolls such as selectman, commisioner “to try small causes”, and tax collector. Nicholas and Elizabeth had six children, the first four probably born in England, or possibly Elizabeth, thought to have been born about 1639, was born in Lynn, but not recorded there. The last two children are recorded as having been born in Reading.

In 1660, Nicholas granted his son John power of attorney, as John was traveling to England. John was to attempt to recover whatever he could of the estate that his mother inherited from her father, Thomas Lide. Nicholas made his will on March 29, 1673 and died on April 5th. His estate was probated on April 17, 1673, it was valued at over 1200 pounds, a large estate in those days. Elizabeth died in Reading on November 1, 1674.

7 Sep 1638 – Freeman in Lynn

1641 – Representative to the General Court

1644- Removed to Reading

1655 – 1658 to 1661 – Deputy from Reading

1660 – Sent his son John to England to look after the property of Thomas Leide which he had inherited as next of kin.

Nicholas’ will was dated 9 Mar 1673, proved 17 June 1673. He bequeathed to children: John, Josiah, Edward, Joseph, Cornelius, and Elizabeth, and to his wife Elizabeth.

Many of the Massachusetts Bay Colony‘s original settlers arrived from England in the 1630s through the ports of Lynn and Salem. In 1639 some citizens of Lynn petitioned the government of the colony for a “place for an inland plantation”. They were initially granted six square miles, followed by an additional four. The first settlement in this grant was at first called “Lynn Village” and was located on the south shore of the “Great Pond”, now known as Lake Quannapowitt. On June 10, 1644 the settlement was incorporated as the town of Reading, taking its name from the town of Reading in England.

The first church was organized soon after the settlement, and the first parish, later known as “South Reading”, became the separate town of Wakefield in 1868. Thomas Parker (Elizabeth Brown’s father-in-law) was one of the founders of Reading. He also was a founder of the 12th Congregational Church (now the First Parish Congregational Church), and served as deacon there. He was a selectman of Reading and was appointed a judicial commissioner. There is evidence that Parker was “conspicuous in naming the town” and that he was related to the Parker family of Little Norton, England, who owned land by the name of Ryddinge.

A special grant in 1651 added land north of the Ipswich River to the town of Reading. In 1853 this area became the separate town of North Reading. The area which currently comprises the town of Reading was originally known as “Wood End”, or “Third Parish”.
