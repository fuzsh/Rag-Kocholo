Inception writer-director Christopher Nolan's made Batman, The Joker and a Scandinavian film noir his own. With Inception, Nolan returns to his roots, bringing an original script to the big screen.

Nolan talks about why his new film was ten years in the writing; his conversations with Leonardo DiCaprio and Guy Pierce about their about their roles in the film; the influence of such British directors as Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne, Nic Roeg and Ridley Scott; and why Inception, which he originally envisioned as a small production, needed a large canvas on which to be painted.
