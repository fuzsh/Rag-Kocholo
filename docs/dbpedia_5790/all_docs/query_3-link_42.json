        "text": "You’ve seen the Oscar-nominated Oppenheimer, now here’s where to watch the rest of director Christoper Nolan’s films on streaming and VOD.\n\nBy Bill Frost\n\nMar 6, 2024 | Share\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has been nominated for over a dozen Academy Awards this season, including Best Picture. Longtime fans of Nolan’s work wouldn’t expect anything less, but newbies to his more-is-more style of filmmaking might be curious as to what came before the juggernaut historical drama of summer 2023.\n\nLet’s take a look at Nolan’s 22-year directorial filmography and where you can stream all of his movies. (Though he’d prefer you see them in a theater.)\n\nDon’t let your internet take you back in time\n\nIs your home internet so slow you may as well be living in a bad ’90s AOL dream? Enter your zip code below to see faster internet providers in your area.\n\nPlease enter a valid zip code.\n\nChristopher Nolan–directed films and where to stream them\n\nOppenheimer (2023)\n\nThe story of Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb,” is up for several Oscars across all categories this year, including Best Actor for titular star Cillian Murphy. Oppenheimer is also now the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, beating out 2018’s barely factual Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nWhere to stream Oppenheimer\n\nTenet (2020)\n\nNolan’s divisive sci-fi action thriller Tenet was the first big-hype movie to premiere during the COVID-19 pandemic and his most expensive, with a $200 million budget. The time-travel saga has since amassed a cult following that will argue with you over its genius for hours on Reddit.\n\nWhere to stream Tenet\n\nAll about the Oscars\n\nThe 96th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, March 10. Prep yourself for the glitz and glamour with our Where You Can Watch Oscar-Nominated Movies and How You Can Watch the Oscars guides.\n\nDunkirk (2017)\n\nDunkirk, a relatively straightforward Nolan film about the Battle of France during WWII, is one of his most unifying works: Nolanheads and normies love it. Its grand scale on land, sea, and in the air made Dunkirk the biggest WWII-related box office success until Nolan’s own Oppenheimer came along.\n\nWhere to stream Dunkirk\n\nInterstellar (2014)\n\nBefore Tenet, Nolan took his time-travel curiosity to space with Interstellar, a science-fiction epic that’s as heavy on science as it is on fiction. With humankind facing extinction on dying Earth, a NASA team travels through a wormhole to find a habitable planet, and things just get gnarlier from there.\n\nWhere to stream Interstellar\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n\nEven though the bar is lower than Aquaman’s bathroom floor, The Dark Knight Rises has been called the greatest DC superhero movie ever made. Nolan’s brutal Batman trilogy also had its critics, which led to Rotten Tomatoes shutting down its comments section after Bane-level fanboy backlash.\n\nWhere to stream The Dark Knight Rises\n\nInception (2010)\n\nThe detractors who complained about Tenet‘s density had apparently forgotten about Inception, which twisted minds into subconscious pretzels 10 years earlier. Nolan’s trippy tale about corporate espionage via dream infiltration is a cerebral and visual marvel, even if you’re never quite sure what’s really real.\n\nWhere to stream Inception\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nIf nothing else, Nolan’s second Batman movie gave us the most indelible Joker in the history of the brand: Heath Ledger. His chaotically committed performance eclipses everyone else on the screen—even Aaron Eckhart’s malevolent turn as villain Two-Face. The Dark Knight perfectly sets up Rises.\n\nWhere to stream The Dark Knight\n\nThe Prestige (2006)\n\nCasting Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as warring magicians in 1890s London was already a fantastically preposterous choice, but then Nolan added David Bowie to play real-life inventor Nikola Tesla. The Prestige is so engaging that you’ll forget you’re watching Batman beef with Wolverine.\n\nWhere to stream The Prestige\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\n\nAfter the camptastic Batman & Robin ground the franchise to a halt in the ’90s, there was only one way to revive it: Go dark and deadly serious. Batman Begins nailed it with Nolan at the helm and Christian Bale in the Batsuit—even Tim Burton, who directed 1989’s definitive Batman, hailed it as a triumph.\n\nWhere to stream Batman Begins\n\nInsomnia (2002)\n\nInsomnia is the only movie here that Nolan didn’t also write and direct—it’s a remake of a Norwegian film. Two Los Angeles detectives (Al Pacino and Martin Donovan) head to Alaska for a murder investigation, and things go south quickly. Insomnia is one of Nolan’s best-reviewed movies.\n\nWhere to stream Insomnia\n\nMemento (2000)\n\nA man (Guy Pearce) out to find his wife’s killer suffers from an acute form of amnesia—he’s unable to sustain memories, so he uses a system of photos, notes, and tattoos to stay on track. The brain-bending Memento unfolds in forward and reverse order and remains one of Nolan’s most fascinating films.\n\nWhere to stream Memento\n\nFollowing (1999)\n\nNolan’s directorial debut Following was shot for just $6,000 and went on to gross over $126,000—he had the magic touch from the jump. The London-set crime-noir movie clocks in at just over an hour, a storytelling shortfall that Nolan obviously spent the rest of his career correcting.\n\nWhere to stream Following"
