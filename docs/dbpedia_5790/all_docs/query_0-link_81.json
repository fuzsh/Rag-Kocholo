        "text": "\"In terms of sitting with a crowd and experiencing the end of the film, 'Inception' was a very unique type of ending,\" Nolan told Insider.\n\nThe ending to \"Inception\" is one of the most memorable in recent movie history because it befuddled so many.\n\nThe story follows a thief named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who works within people's dreams to steal or insert specific information into their minds. After finishing his latest job, he's able to return to see his children at the end of the movie.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBefore seeing them, Cobb spins a small top, a totem he uses to know he's not dreaming and is in reality. But before he can see the top stop spinning, his kids run into his arms. As they embrace, the camera turns back to the top, which is still spinning. Or is it about to stop before the picture fades to black? We'll never know.\n\n\"If I would sneak into the back of the theater when it was playing, and we would get to the end, there would be a tremendous sort of gasp, groans, frustrations â€” it was an incredible mixture and I would feel very much like I need to get out of here before anybody notices I'm there,\" Nolan said with a laugh.\n\n\"So that was a pretty remarkable ending to sit through with audiences over the years. But to single one out beyond that is like asking which of the films is my favorite, and that's certainly not something I'm qualified to say.\"\n\nNolan went on to say that movie endings are \"very, very important\" to him. He revealed that he won't even fully commit to a movie until he's figured out the ending.\n\nSo did he know the ending of \"Inception\" before figuring out the rest of the movie?\n\n\"Saying it that extremely is not quite accurate,\" he said. \"But certainly as I'm planning a project, as I'm starting to write, I spend months writing notes and thinking about the thing before I'm really ready to start the business of actually writing the script. And I certainly have always felt with movies it's very important to know the final destination before you really commit to the project.\"\n\nNolan's next movie, \"Oppenheimer,\" which also has a powerful ending, opens in theaters on Friday."
