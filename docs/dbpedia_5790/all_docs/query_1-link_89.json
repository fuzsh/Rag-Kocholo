        "text": "In the film industry, there are directors who merely take someone else’s vision and express it in their own way on film, then there are those who take their own visions and use any means necessary to express their visions on film. The latter of these two types of directors are called auteurs. Not only do auteurs write the scripts from elements that they know and love in life, but they direct, produce, and sometimes act in their films as well. Three prime examples of these auteurs are: Kevin Smith, Spike Lee and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nLukas Hamlescher Dr. Neuendorf COM 320 Preliminary Draft Wes Anderson is a staple in the independent film community. He writes, directs, and produces most of his films. He takes time to develop stories unique to him and from each other. Nonetheless, all of Anderson?s films have an undeniable familiarity between them as he imprints his style on everything he creates. However, if he did not have inspiration or influences for his films, his creativity and artistic flair may not have a proper way to be displayed.\n\nAn auteur is a filmmaker whose movies are characterized by their creative influence. Garry Marshall is an American filmmaker, he has directed more than 15 films in his career. Garry Marshall’s films The Princess Diaries, Valentines Day and Overboard share a common theme of love and a genre of romance and comedy, he likes to use the same actors in his films and have the common plot of a double twist. Garry Marshall likes to keep to the same character persona and film techniques but these generalized similarities are not obvious to the audience, therefore Garry Marshall is not a recognizable Auteur.\n\nNolan creates an atmosphere where one scene will move steadily to the next, building anticipation until all hell breaks loose. Nolan has really done his research with this film as he explores a deeper meaning in good vs. evil. It makes the film seem so real life unlike most fantasy superhero movie. For some reason, the viewer can actually imagine this happening in real life. The lights and effects are very promising.\n\nThe absolutely stunning film, Citizen Kane (1941), is one of the world’s most famous and highly renowned films. The film contains many remarkable scenes and cinematic techniques as well as innovations. Within this well-known film, Orson Welles (director) portrays many stylistic features and fundamentals of cinematography. The scene of Charles Foster Kane and his wife, Susan, at Xanadu shows the dominance that Kane bears over people in general as well as Susan specifically. Throughout the film, Orson Welles continues to convey the message of Susan’s inferiority to Mr. Kane. Also, Welles furthers the image of how demanding Kane is of Susan and many others. Mr. Welles conveys the message that Kane has suffered a hard life, and will\n\nTheir traditional instruments create the mood of the film, having some of the best musical scores that I’ve heard in a film. Zhangs use of instrumental music throughout his scenes create a sense of intensity and mood. At the beginning of the scene the music starts with a soft tune and slowly increase in volume as Broken Sword walked through the hall ways. The scene used more of a strings melody that created a calmer, more intimate scene. This is then followed by a dynamic transition into the following fighting scene. As the film progresses though the fighting scenes, the score evolves into a more epic and intense melody which uses the sounds of objects in movement, accompanied by a percussion that creates an intense mood, and the soft vocals of a female to create a more elegant melody. Dun Tan, the composer of the score used more traditional forms of instruments to create a feeling of immersion in the time period chosen. The music is one of the strongest elements in the film really creating the\n\nI think the top stopped spinning at the end of the movie and Cobb was awake. Firstly, in almost all of his dreams, Mal would always appear and sabotage his plans because she was still alive in Cobb’s memories. However, in the scene at the end, Mal did not appear and did not try to sabotage anything, which proves that the top had stopped spinning and he was awake. Also, I believe in the pragmatic view that “we should not doubt things that we seem to just intuitively know and would otherwise accept without a question”; Cobb being in reality was one of them (Miller, 59). The audience and Cobb himself just know that he is in reality therefore, we shouldn’t doubt it and accept it. I also agree that if we are unable to figure out what\n\nInception is a science fiction thriller film, directed by Christopher Nolan, which describes the complex idea of entering dreams. A cast of character are presented near the middle of the poster in an environment where the town curving upwards in the background, displaying that the film will defy logic. The poster directly shows a scene from the movie, which grabs the attention of the viewer and makes them curious. The repetition of the cast holding guns shows that there will be action and violence within the movie.The bright red colors contrast the plain colors that are presented throughout, adding suspense and tension to the situation. Furthermore, the lines “Your mind is the scene of the crime” is written. This gives a dark tone to the situation,\n\nThe director is responsible for overseeing creative aspects of a film. They develop the vision for a film and carry the vision out, deciding how the film should look. The director may also be heavily involved in the writing and editing of the film, as well as managing the script into a sequence of shots, coordinating the actors in the film and supervising musical aspects. The Auteur Theory suggests that films contain certain characteristics or ‘signatures’ that reflect the director’s individual style and give a film its personal and unique stamp. Hayao Miyazaki is one such auteur whose entertaining plots, compelling characters\n\nInception is a Sci- fi film that talks about some people who go into people’s dreams, stealing ideas/secrets from unconscious minds by pretending that the “mark”’s*(the person who they are trying to steal the idea from) dream is a reality. This changes when a business man, Saito hires them from stealing ideas to instead planting ideas inside the “mark”’s head. The mark this time is another businessman named fischer who inherited his father’s fortune after his death. Saito wants fischer to break up his business because they are competitors. This requires planting an idea in Fischers head that his father wants him to break up his business, also known as inception.\n\nThe intention of this essay is to discuss the romantic notion of a film director who has etched their own cinematic vision into the body of their film work, and whether the theory and practice is dead and an infringement of the spectator’s imagination and is it the spectator who finds meaning in the film. I will be closely looking at critical material, primarily André Bazin and Roland Barthes and applying them to several case study films directed by Christopher Nolan including The Following (1998), The Prestige (2006) and Inception (2010), to examine whether Nolan possesses the qualities of an auteur and if so, does that imply an ideological view of what the auteur resembles or an artistic one.\n\nAlthough many people know Christopher Nolan for his more recent films “The Prestige”, “Dark Knight Trilogy”, “Interstellar”, “Inception”, and now most recently the war film “Dunkirk”. Although each of these films are amazing we should never forget one of Christopher Nolan’s first great directed films “Memento.” Memento is a uniquely structured psychological thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Christopher Nolan is an English film director, screenwriter, and producer. He is one of the highest-grossing directors in history and among the most acclaimed filmmakers of all time. He made his directorial debut with the “Following” in 1998 Christopher Nolan has continued to turn out great movies that have received multiple Academy Award nomination. He found further popular and critical success with The Dark Knight Trilogy beginning in 2005 and Inception in 2010, which received eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. He has produced and directed several other notable films and his films have grossed over four billion dollars worldwide and garnered a total of 26 Oscar nominations and 7 wins. The Screenplay was written by Cristopher Nolan himself and his brother Jonathan Nolan who has co-written several films with Nolan r over the years and has produced and created several films and tv shows. He is most known for being the creator of television series Person of Interest and Co-creator of Westworld. The film was\n\nThe vision Christopher Nolan had for The Prestige (2006) was to add to the outbreak of street magician film, whilst playing a large dramatic subplot equal in grandeur to the magical performances within the film. In the final sequence of the film, I will analyse how the cinematography and sound resolves the plot so that it summarises the themes present in the film, whilst also invoking a response from the audience. Nolan predominantly uses close up shots, non-diegetic sound (music) and dialogue collaboratively to convey the dramatic, personal subplot of the characters and their relationships, whilst appealing to the audience bringing forth an emotional response from the audience. The heavy, slow, dramatic atmosphere of the ending sequence uses various techniques to summarise and uncover the underlying mysteries of the events throughout the film and consolidate themes introduced during the exposition.\n\nIn this film the director used diegetic sound combined with digitally added music to emphasize the chaos of what the Nazi soldiers were doing. The soldiers shouting out and screaming in German over top of the Requiem Mass which was playing loudly in the foreground accompanied by the exaggerated sound of shovels breaking through the ground, and the hissing sound of the fire together created thick polyphonic sound. This overwhelms us, and emphasizes the action, and the severity of what they are doing, attempting to wipe a whole race from history. The soldiers in this scene are chaotic, desperately attempting to hide what they have done, and the loud, screaming song of the Requiem Mass adds to this. This chaos and desperation also suggests that they knew what they were doing was wrong as if they felt it was completely justified they wouldn’t have attempted to hide it.\n\nThe characters in “Inception” are masters of altering and changing reality through the dream world which is somewhat similar to Dorian Gray ability to defy reality and have eternal youth. In “Inception” there is one place that is not one of the three dream levels but is described as a place of “Just raw, infinite subconscious” were people who die inside of a dream are placed and in most cases trapped unaware that they are still in a dream. Now in Dorian Gray there is not a definitive limbo like in “Inception” but Dorian Gray is still supernatural while the rest of reality is still considered to be normal. But in both cases they still have supernatural occurrences involving dream travel and special abilities, and obstacles that you face when"
