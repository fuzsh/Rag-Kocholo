        "text": "Fresh off big-time Oscar wins, Christopher Nolan is reportedly already toiling away on his next movie script. The Oppenheimer filmmaker just received golden statues for Best Picture and Best Director at the 96th Academy Awards over the weekend.\n\nAccording to Puck.news, Nolan is busy penning the screenplay to his next film. Previously, the Dark Knight Trilogy director provided clues about what's next for him, noting it won't be small. \"I'm drawn to working at a large scale because I know how fragile the opportunity to marshal those resources is,\" he said earlier this year to Time Magazine.\n\nOppenheimer ended up becoming the highest-grossing biopic ever at the box office, in addition to Nolan's biggest non-Batman movie in the US. The drama won seven Oscars over the weekend, as it was the big winner of the night.\n\nIn February, Nolan expressed interest in exploring a new genre for himself: horror. The director openly discussed that \"a really exceptional idea\" is needed to make a horror movie work, and he hadn't quite put his finger on a narrative to pull it off.\n\nThere is also the James Bond reboot. Nolan is an unabashed fan of the film franchise and chatted last year about whether he would tackle a 007 project--though later said \"no truth\" to rumors he's attached to Bond. And then, if you really want to think outside the box, Nolan has admitted to loving the Fast & Furious movies. With the filmmaker now working with Universal, the studio behind that franchise, maybe anything is possible."
