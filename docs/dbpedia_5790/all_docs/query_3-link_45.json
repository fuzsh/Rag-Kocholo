        "text": "Christopher Nolan landed his first ever Oscar in March 2024, winning Best Director as part of Oppenheimer's multiple Oscar wins.\n\nIt was his second nomination for Best Director, following Dunkirk, but is Oppenheimer really the best movie of Nolan's career to date? The one that was most worthy of winning him his Oscar, and also all those other awards?\n\nSince we've got a while to wait to find out how Nolan will follow up his record-breaking biopic, we thought we'd take a look back at his career to date to rank all of his 12 movies.\n\nIt's not easy to order Christopher Nolan's movies from worst to best, given some of them are among the best movies of the last twenty years. Also, Nolan's movies have a common ability to always surprise viewers, usually thanks to time-twisting stories that are never what they seem.\n\nThat's true for his latest movie Oppenheimer, a huge box-office hit that has arguably been the most talked-about of his career to date, even ahead of his excellent Batman trilogy. It grossed nearly $1 billion at the box office worldwide and, as well as the Oscars, has won numerous awards.\n\nThe three-hour biopic about the life of J Robert Oppenheimer is Nolan's third highest-grossing movie ever, behind only The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nBut enough about the box office. The only ranking we care about is the quality of the movies.\n\nSo in light of Oppenheimer's success, we've taken on the frankly impossible task of ranking all 12 of Nolan's movies from worst to best. (When it comes to Nolan, it's more from 'good' to 'masterpiece', if we're being honest.)\n\nWe know you'll almost definitely disagree with this list, but hey, that's the fun of cinema."
