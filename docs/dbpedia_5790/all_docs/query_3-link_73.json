        "text": "Best Christopher Nolan Movies Ranked\n\nThe Best Christopher Nolan Movies\n\nChristopher Nolan movies are great for filmmakers to study because he is one of the few directors who understand both how to craft a compelling story, and then support that story through very precise cinematic techniques.\n\nWhich Christopher Nolan movies do this the best?\n\nChris Nolan Films\n\n11. Following (1998)\n\nChristopher Nolan’s first feature film is a 69 minute Film Noir suspense thriller. The film was predominantly hand-held, shot on an Arri BL and a Bolex (both 16MM) and the entire movie is in black and white.\n\nThe film was made in 15-minute stints over the course of a year due to Nolan’s financial and production constraints. And you see early signs of Christopher Nolan’s directing style and cinematic values in this film.\n\nThe story is great, and the chief reason the film lands at the end of our Christopher Nolan movies list is purely the technical quality. Nolan was just getting started and his directing style was just maturing.\n\nSome of these cinematic techniques used by Nolan include extreme close-ups of insert shots, cross cutting scenes, and a non-linear story structure.\n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nChris Nolan Films\n\n10. Tenet (2020)\n\nWith Tenet, Christopher Nolan took a huge swing. In fact, most would agree this was his biggest swing yet and we can't help but applaud him for doing so. Much respect also given to Warner Bros. for allowing an auteur like Nolan to continue making massive tentpoles with original content. However, if we can conclude our baseball analogy, despite the monstrous swing, it did not connect.\n\nSince Day One, Nolan movies have been pushing the boundaries of how intellectually challenging blockbusters can be. In this case, we apparently found the breaking point. Tenet is basically unintelligible — from the headache-inducing plot to the sound mixing that made the dialogue in certain scenes impossible to hear.\n\nThat being said, just because Tenet is hard to understand, it is still fun to watch. The cinematography is moody yet precise, the forward/reverse action sequences are surely impressive, and the score by Ludwig Göransson is an absolute banger. It will be interesting to see how Nolan returns from this one. His batting average (here we go again) is still unbelievably high, especially working at the peak of the Studio System. Everybody strikes out sometimes.\n\nChristopher Nolan Movies\n\n9. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n\nWe said we'd judge each film as an individual, and I believe it is still safe to say the The Dark Knight Rises would not have been met with the same positive reception if it had not been for the critical acclaim of The Dark Knight.\n\nYou get the distinct feeling that this third film was highly compromised by the studio, and overly complicated even for Christopher Nolan.\n\nDid we really want a Joseph Gordon Levitt Nightwing sequel? Probably not, but I'd like to know why we needed all of these new characters.\n\nWhy were they all basically just dead ends?\n\nThere are some amazing scenes which include a mid-air hijacking by a rather buff Sean Connery impersonator, but the various contrivances, plot holes, and the film’s ending were not what viewers expected from Nolan. It fell flat.\n\nNolan Movies Ranked\n\n8. Interstellar (2014)\n\nThis list becomes increasingly more difficult from here on out. Interstellar has some of the greatest scenes set in outer space since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nMany of the visual effects in the film were created beforehand so that the filmmakers could later capture them “in camera.” This allowed actors to react to their surroundings without the use of a green screen. Watching Matthew McConaughey mow through an okra field with a pick-up or slip into a black hole are just some of the great moments in the film.\n\nIt’s true that our own mind and ideas can be our worst enemy, but much of Inception seems to suffer from the same pitfall as many Marvel films.\n\nHordes of faceless enemies become boring after a while.\n\nWithout a doubt, there are some amazing and iconic moments in Inception. The film grammar is very strong, the core idea is inventive, the kicks are visually stunning, and the complex ending scene is absolutely superb. All of these achievements solidify Christopher Nolan as a truly unique filmmaker.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NOLAN All Movies Ranked\n\n6. Batman Begins (2005)\n\nBatman Begins is truly a standalone film. It’s the origin story that Marvel and the other DC films have been chasing for a while now.\n\nThe reason they struggle to capture what Christopher Nolan was able to achieve is because they’re unwilling to admit that a human story is what superhero films require to become truly immersive experiences.\n\nConsider how he used a training montage in Act One to give us backstory, characterization and the beginnings of Wayne's character arc. Here's a video on Nolan's approach to montage.\n\nBruce Wayne is a flawed person. He is haunted by his guilt, consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. Bruce is impetuous, and corrupted by his own fear. He is someone who needs to be redeemed.\n\nAnd he’s sort of a brat.\n\nThis makes his transformation that much more effective, and Nolan takes advantage of Joseph Campbell’s mono-myth, but with his own twist.\n\nThe monastery in the eastern mountains, the psychotropic blue flowers, the sword training scene on the ice, the notorious pick-the-ninja game. How about Bruce snagging Ducard as he slides off the snowy precipice?\n\nThese remarkable moments kept us on the edge of our seats.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NOLAN Movies List\n\n5. Insomnia (2002)\n\nInsomnia is one of the most haunting detective films of all time. Why?\n\nBecause Detective Dormer is another flawed, Nolan-esque protagonist. He is compromised from the start, and the entire film gains a layer of constant logical suspense and drama.\n\nThere are no super gadgets, fantasy elements, or space travel...just a really sleepy detective. Haunted by his deeds, but still has a killer to catch.\n\nThere is a great personal relationship between the hero and villain (the late-great Robin Williams), and the lines blurred more than usual.\n\nNolan’s film grammar is at the height of its effectiveness, and this is because he hit the perfect balance between a professional budget, and reasonable limitations. He had enough rope to climb, but not hang himself.\n\nHow do I mean?\n\nWhen Christopher Nolan has a huge budget, he will often try to lace together visual spectacle with many of the Christopher Nolan techniques, which can betray his own carefully crafted narratives from time to time.\n\nIt’s not as if we hate the spinning hallways, but sometimes Nolan is at his best when his stories are more contained, more human, more relatable.\n\nThis film has some of the best performances of any Nolan film.\n\nBest Nolan Movies\n\n4. The Dark Knight (2008)\n\nNow I know what you’re thinking…\n\nHow could The Dark Knight not make it into the top three?\n\nBut before you hurl your collectable Batman sippy-cup into that mint condition Gotham lunch box (complete with Victor Fries ice pack) remember this:\n\nWe’re not ranking the best Batman films, or even the best superhero movies...\n\nWe're ranking the best Christopher Nolan movies.\n\nThere is some truly clunky dialogue, as well as some pretty cringe inducing moments in The Dark Knight, and while I can’t be sure this was Nolan or Warner Brothers, we can’t ignore these really odd choices.\n\nHeath Ledger as The Joker may go down as one of the greatest performances of all time. And while Bob Kane crafted this timeless character, Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger did an incredible job of bringing him to life.\n\nChristian Bale isn't too shabby either.\n\nThe Dark Knight has some truly unforgettable moments, and some of the best performances in a superhero film. The film is all about chaos and the battle, not between good and evil, but Nolan’s take on natural conflict.\n\nWhat happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, and how every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nRanking Nolan MOvies\n\n3. Dunkirk (2017)\n\nChristopher Nolan mentioned that he intentionally built Dunkirk to play like the third act of any other war film, just stretched out across 106 minutes. This is despite the fact that the script for Dunkirk was only 76 pages.\n\nIt’s very similar to Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nA fantastic visual achievement that shows... rather than tells.\n\nDunkirk is one of the most authentic and suspenseful films ever crafted, and it puts the viewer inside the boots of the soldiers on Dunkirk beach.\n\nNolan also uses his favorite cinematic device — cross cutting.\n\nThe entire film’s structure was influenced by The Shepard Tone, which allows the film to continually rise in suspense throughout. The use of vintage aircraft, lighting, special effects, and lack of dialogue win the day.\n\nLeonard Shelby’s world is accessible, even if his condition is abstract. The way Nolan shot and cut the film together shows us the pinnacle of intentional filmmaking and non-linear story structure.\n\nYou can see the matured forms of his signature storytelling techniques like time jumps, inserts, Dutch angles, and a convergent narrative.\n\nThere is something to be said about Nolan’s smaller films. They are often more grounded, because they have to be, and that really helps to make Nolan’s complex ideas a bit more palatable. Not to mention the structure of the film places us in a very similar situation to that of Leonard Shelby.\n\nLess is more… as they say.\n\nBest Christopher Nolan Movies\n\n1. The Prestige (2006)\n\nThe Prestige is one of the great modern films, and has the best script of any Nolan film. Nolan found what worked so well with Memento and took that electricity a step further. His pacing improved as well.\n\nThe theme is carefully intertwined with the subject matter, the world of magicians, the act of filmmaking, and Nolan’s personal style."
