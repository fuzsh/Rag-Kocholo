        "text": "“I specialize in a very specific type of security. Subconscious security.”\n\nAs it is with all the films that shape our lives, I can vividly remember the first time I saw Christopher Nolan’s Inception. After months of hype and cryptic marketing materials, I eagerly sat down in the theater with my father on a warm night in mid-July and was not prepared for what my eyes and brain would take in onscreen.\n\nThe novel premise about a group of dream thieves led by Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb delivered a refreshing blockbuster that wasn’t based on an existing franchise or IP. The groundbreaking visuals, ensemble cast, heart-thumping score by Hans Zimmer, and multi-layered storytelling that didn’t spoon feed the audience all combined into a watershed moment for what was possible in the realm of movie-making.\n\nBy the time the credits rolled around two-and-half hours later, I could barely put my excitement into words, my thoughts swirling like the ephemeral mist of what the character of Saito (played by Ken Watanabe) might describe as “a half-remembered dream.” High on Nolan fumes, I got home and stayed up late into the night, listening to the soundtrack and trying to relive what I had just experienced.\n\nIt was on that fateful night when a wide-eyed camp counselor from New Jersey decided to pursue a career of entertainment. I didn’t yet know the path I’d take to get there, but one thing was for certain: I wanted to be immersed in the intoxicating world of cinematic storytelling.\n\nI’d go so far as to call Inception the Star Wars of my generation. Not only did everyone go to see it (and multiple times at that), but it’s all anyone could talk about afterwards. If you weren’t debating every detail of the movie that summer, then you were probably living under a rock.\n\nFor months, it was all I could think about; Nolan had planted an idea in my head and its roots were growing stronger every day. It prompted a desire to create and when Hanukkah rolled out later that year, I recreated the ending with a little orange dreidel.\n\nWith the film celebrating its 10th anniversary this week, I wanted to revisit the wondrous project that lit the raging creative fire in my belly. I tracked down as many key crew members as I possibly could and when these surreal interviews began to take place, no somnambular extraction was necessary on my part. The folks who had helped craft Nolan’s ambitious vision were only too happy to reminisce about their involvement with a culture-defining movie that was (and is) — to quote Detective Sam Spade — the stuff that dreams are made of.\n\nIn Part 1, I chat with Supervising Music Editor Alex Gibson, who has been working with Nolan since 2002’s Insomnia. Here, he reveals some secrets about Zimmer’s horn-filled (and Oscar-nominated) music, as well as the movie’s famous manipulation of Edith Piaf’s “Non, je ne regrette rien.” The 1960 recording is used to indicate when the dozing heisters are about to be jolted out of a dream with a specially-timed “kick.”\n\nJosh Weiss: What did you think of the premise of Inception when it was first described to you?\n\nAG: First of all, its relationship with time is always hard to follow. But the whole concept was very exciting, like a dream within a dream. It was exciting from the very beginning. The scripts are [always] great.\n\nJW: Did you have to read it a few times to truly understand it?\n\nAG: I think I was allowed to read it once and then I started on it. It was early on and they hadn’t quite finished their cut, so I got to see it as it was getting finished up, editorial-wise. I had the luxury of being able to look at things over and over and over if I wanted to ... It definitely took more than one pass or one read.\n\nJW: What were some of your duties as supervising music editor on the film?\n\nAG: On Chris’s films, he wants the composer to write a lot of music before it even starts shooting. The composer usually writes to the script, no one gets to keep the script. You can read it once and then you don’t have it. You have to kind of remember it or [just go off] an idea from Chris. I’m brought on to help Chris figure out what we’ve got and where it should go and things like that. And then we build it from what was already recorded.\n\nJW: How did you go about placing the music?\n\nAG: Chris, of course…it’s his tastes first and then I try to squeeze in things that I think he’d like. But he usually has a good idea, even while he’s shooting, because he’s listening to the music over and over [deciding] what goes where, and I just have to make it all work.\n\nJW: Do you have a favorite cue from the score?\n\nAG: I really like the final cue [“Time”] when they’re on the airplane and he’s going through the airport. That one is great.\n\nJW: That’s my favorite track, too. It’s so emotional. Can you elaborate on it a little?\n\nAG: That was just one of the many cues that Hans had written and then Chris would ask him to ‘make it a little bit bigger here, let’s crescendo here.’ He shaped it and then we started adding guitars to it: Johnny Marr guitars. And it just took off.\n\nJW: The score does have a bit of a rock quality to it in places.\n\nAG: That was a Hans call and I think it stayed in because of the guitars they brought in to do it. I think Chris really liked [it], so it was kind of an honor to have the guitarist play on it.\n\nJW: There’s only one piece of licensed music in the movie, and it’s by Edith Piaf. How did you go about incorporating that song into the film?\n\nAG: It’s in the script. And that was fun working with it because on different dream levels, we got to slow it down immensely. It was pretty cool how it played at different [speeds].\n\nJW: What was that process like?\n\nAG: A good question because we kind of did a cheat ... if you measure the time shift of the scenes, the difference is a lot more drastic, story-wise, than the stretch we did. For example, the time difference between the reality and dream state could be 25 times slower for the timelines, but only 4-6x slower for the Piaf song. If it literally followed the timeline and played 25x slower, it’s unrecognizable. It would be a single note through the whole scene. I used a program called PaulStretch and I just had made a whole bunch of different ones and Chris picked what he liked.\n\nJW: Any other fun, behind-the-scenes anecdotes from the musical process that stick out in your mind?\n\nAG: All the high-perk, like sticks and symbols and high hats — anything high that was in a rhythm, Chris wanted to take those and what he called “world-ize” [them]. That means someone plays them through a PA system outside; just the individual tracks, so it has all this air and ambiance; that is pretty cool. He started it on that movie and we did it a little on Interstellar as well … That was kind of cool because they pumped into it into the air on the Warner Bros. lot on a Sunday.\n\nJW: I’m not too music savvy. What exactly is the purpose behind “world-izing”?\n\nAG: For Chris, it just gave him a texture that he liked better than regular reverb.\n\nJW: The score is also notable for having those big horns. What’s the story behind them?\n\nAG: Chris latched onto it; it was just a little thing on all the stuff we recorded early. They started playing it really loud and it was just very effective and dramatic and we just slowly peppered throughout where we thought it would [work nicely]. But it is iconic now, everyone uses it.\n\nJW: Do you have an interpretation of the film’s ending?\n\nAG: We did talk about it. Chris just left it up to the audience to decide. It didn’t matter either way because it will fall at some point. But it’s kind of fun just to see, ‘Oh man, [is this a dream?’]\n\nJW: In those final moments before we cut to black, the score itself seems to wobble.\n\nAG: Actually, we just came upon that accidentally. The music that we used for the big ending wasn’t quite long enough, so I played around with making it longer by repeating one element or something and it got down to the screechy violin harmonics. That got refined as we finished, but it just came out of, ‘This cue isn’t long enough, I need to stretch it.’ Once we start putting it to picture, that’s when Chris has his ideas. Often, when we’re doing the final mix, it’s just the creative process at that point, so a lot of things happen on the final mix stage. Because you need to see how it plays and stuff.\n\nJW: Did Chris suggest anything during the final mix that hadn’t occurred to you?\n\nAG: It’s hard to remember anything. There’s not only years in between, but there are other films … Chris has photographic hearing; he can remember every tiny detail of the music that’s written for the movie. I mean every detail. So, as we’re going along and Hans is writing updated versions of what we’ve put in there, Chris would not like the new versions in a lot of areas and wanted to go back to the demo. Chris is like that, whatever is really working for him, it doesn’t matter if it’s a two-track stereo, he’ll play it in a gigantic scene because it has a sonic quality only he can probably hear, but that was pretty cool.\n\nJW: Did you work with Hans directly?\n\nAG: Although he wrote a lot of the music early, it was constantly being refined to Chris’s desires. And that was frustrating for [Hans] because it was just so much work for him. It lasted all through the dub and little minor things changed. He was always upbeat and he really enjoyed the time aspect and he had all these ideas — he often has 10 ideas and there only has to be one, but a lot of great ideas concerning differences in time and Edith Piaf stretching. He may have been involved with that with Chris, I’m not quite sure. But I’m involved with him and I’m involved with Chris. I kind of am the conduit between them by the end. Chris will tell me, ‘Tell Hans to do this.’\n\nJW: What was the most challenging aspect of working on the movie’s soundtrack?\n\nAG: I think it was the size, the scale of what we were bringing music-wise. The amount of tracks we had to manage. I mean, it was hard to keep track. That was the first time because The Dark Knight had a normal amount of tracks.\n\nJW: What are you most proud of when it comes to your work on Inception?\n\nAG: I’m proud of the Edith Piaf song slowed-down. Plus the score, technically, it was something no one had done before. We had so many audio tracks, I mean hundreds. That was exciting to have the most-ever and it seems like [for] each film, we keep doing more. That was exciting and interesting.\n\nJW: How would you describe the music of Inception in a sentence or two?\n\nAG: I find the music is often very seductive and moody in [terms of the] relationship with Mal. Those cues are just really really good. They're on the beach; her in the apartment in those dreams; and her jumping. That was the second-best moment for me, musically. At the jump, just the heartbreak. It was just very emotional when it needed to be; deeply emotional, I think, and sad. It was great.\n\nJW: What are your thoughts on the movie’s enduring legacy 10 years later?\n\nAG: It’s great, of course. We’re always rooting for it on opening weekend and then, ‘Yay!’ But the chatter online, everyone has their theories and it’s pretty cool. A lot of people got into it deep, and that was great. What more could Chris want? He’s got everyone thinking.\n\nJW: What have you learned about Chris Nolan as a director?"
