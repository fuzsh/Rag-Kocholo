        "text": "This post is a part of a series exploring the creative elements of the filmmaking process of Christopher Nolan. For thou knowest not, Nolan is a film director and screenwriter who has directed several early 21st-century super hit movies, including Following, Memento, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk and Tenet— to name a few.\n\nA master storyteller and an accomplished director of his generation. His movies deploy plot, theme, and character with a finesse a few other directors in Hollywood could manifest into celluloid. He is best known for his record-breaking Dark Knight trilogy. His rise to unprecedented heights of mainstream Hollywood and then financial and cultural success has established him as one of those rare and extraordinary filmmakers who can harness the full power of the Hollywood studio system and large-scale budget to his benefit.\n\nNolan received attention for his early films, Following (1998) and Memento (2000). It was sort of a precursor to what lay ahead and what the audience will soon experience in his subsequent films. After directing Insomnia, Nolan’s next film was Batman Begins, a re-launch of the comic-book franchise that became a worldwide hit. The film’s sequel, The Dark Knight, broke box office records. Nolan’s heady sci-fi thriller, Inception, became another blockbuster two years later. In 2012, he produced the third film of his Batman saga, The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan followed with Interstellar in 2014, then World War II based-film Dunkirk in 2017 and Tenet in 2020.\n\nCinematic Sensibilities\n\nNolan’s movies are known for their intellectualism, psychological depth and unorthodox storytelling process. Both Following and Memento had a unique non-chronological narrative structure. Most notably, the story of Memento unfolded episode by episode in backward time. Inception has a sequence of stories that exist within other stories, dream within a dream, as the characters explore the realm of a person’s highly layered unconscious mind.\n\nThe director’s work has also focused on male protagonists who try to overcome the obstacles in their past while working through complex challenges. Women in his films are sometimes portrayed as allies, supporting protagonists, heroes, and romantic interests. Ironically, some became casualties.\n\nInspiration & Influence\n\nChristopher Nolan draws inspiration from several classic-era films. He owes a lot to 1977: Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and The Spy Who Loved Me — three movies he often cites as major influences in his filmmaking career. More importantly, 1977 was when his dad took him to the theater to see ​2001: A Space Odyssey. The precocious kid instantly fell in love, and a career was born. “Movies become indistinguishable from our memories,” Nolan says. “You file them away, and they become very personal.”\n\nHe is a longtime fan of detective novels, often employing flashbacks and other time-shifting devices. Some of his favorite books are The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks, Gravity’s Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, Emma by Jane Austen and The Stand by Stephen King. Selected Poems by T. S. Eliot and A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle.\n\nThe Dark Knight Saga\n\nTo Nolan, time is not an unstoppable, forward-marching force beyond our control. It is merely another storytelling tool, a dimension that can be stepped outside and manipulated to his will. The Dark Knight frequently uses this technique, structuring its story around several action scenes, like the opening bank heist, the Hong Kong extradition, or the hostage situation in the unfinished tower. Then, subsequently compressing time and space into tidy narrative blocks that each build to a cathartic emotional release. This batman trilogy remains so successful also due to how much reality Nolan gave to this comic-book franchise.\n\nInception: Designing Dreams\n\nInception is a story about a thief who steals corporate secrets through dream-sharing technology. In Nolan's words, the movie is structured as a great heist set within the architecture of the mind. At the same time, the story is packed with incredible imagery and the presence of an experimental military technology that allows people to enter and act within an individual’s dreams. The film’s story focuses on a rogue group that has repurposed this technology to extract secret information from a target’s subconscious.\n\nInception had a lot of science intertwined: A rigid set of rules, mathematical and geometrical in nature, define that script. They’re not real science, but they have that quality and substance. It’s a cheat in a cinematic narrative, which they tried to do as little as possible and in a way that doesn’t violate the pact with the audience. In Inception, the geometry is pretty solid. This narration style afforded Nolan an opportunity and canvas to thoroughly explore the mechanics of time– befitting their place in a heist film.\n\nInterstellar: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe phrase “Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here” is the fundamental sentiment that drives Nolan’s ninth feature film, ‘Interstellar.’ The film dares to show the last frontier as an experience beyond the limits of our wildest imaginations and scientific breakthrough.\n\nInterstellar goes to great lengths to explain how black holes entwine time and the forces of gravity, using the relativity of time as a major source of emotional conflict and human saga. Each time the Endurance mission (inter-galactic spaceship) led by Cooper, the lead character (played by Matthew McConaughey) faces a delay, years or decades go by on Earth– and his chance of ever seeing their family again drops precipitously.\n\nScientific Edge\n\nNolan worked with a scientist to develop the story of Interstellar. To make sense of this innovative research, it will help to glance through the science behind the story, what they achieved, and how they found common ground when the story sought to break the rules of reality or rule of physics really.\n\nWhen Christopher Nolan signed up to direct Interstellar and started rewriting its script, he met Kip Thorne. Thorne was not an average astrophysicist. He was a famous theoretical physicist known for his contributions to gravitational physics. Not many people know that Thorne was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for his work on the LIGO detector (gravitational wave detection) and gravitational waves.\n\nInitially, Nolan hoped to get a broad-stroke sign-off on things he wanted to do with time and gravity. Later Chris brought him in as a critical partner on the same level as a cinematographer or production designer. His math guided the movie’s enthralling visual effects, especially a massive black hole called Gargantua that spins at the speed of light — the most accurate simulation of what a black hole would like. This simulation plays a central role in the movie.\n\nWhen Chris and Thorne met, they quickly found common ground: Thorne wanted science in the story. Nolan wanted the story to emerge from science. So, in Interstellar, time dilation — the passing of time at different rates for different observers — became an emotional obstacle between a father and his daughter. Quantum gravity, the reconciliation of relativity and quantum mechanics, became the plot’s central mystery.\n\nDouble Negative, an Academy Award-winning visual effects company in London, collaborated with Thorne to ensure their depictions of a black hole were accurate and elegant. Chris wanted a planet with time dilation exceptionally greater than that anyone has ever seen in physics. Interstellar is the first Hollywood movie to attempt to depict a black hole as it would be seen by somebody nearby. The visual effects team even published a scientific paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03808) on their work visualizing Interstellar’s wormhole.\n\nChris and Thorne discussed moving forward and backward in time and that physicists don’t yet know for sure what the laws of physics allow and forbid. So Chris came up with his ruleset, and Thorne came up with a way to fit it into what he thought physicists knew.\n\nIn the interview, Thorne remarks he felt Chris had somehow extracted an essential piece of physics that is not generally known. The idea is that gravity can reach multiple dimensions while none of the other physical fields can. In Kip’s writing, Chris found the question of whether a singularity, the heart of a black hole, is always hidden or whether you can have what’s called a naked singularity.\n\n“If we knew what was going on there, we would understand a lot more about reconciling quantum physics with larger physics. I grabbed that like a magpie. It’s one of the greatest mysteries in the universe”.\n\nChris was determined to have a character travel faster than the speed of light. Thorne laid out the reasons why it couldn’t work. Chris later backed down on his idea. That was the point he finally grasped the concept of relativity and conceded nothing could travel faster than light. That moment was ephemeral. He said, “It’s like a little window opening up. That’s why the relationship between storytelling and the scientific method fascinates me. It wasn’t really about an intellectual understanding. It was a feeling of grasping something”.\n\nThorne calculated and found that if you have a black hole that spins rapidly enough and a very close planet to the last stable circular orbit, you could get the time dilation he wanted.\n\nChris took an artistic approach to the key visual element for the climax scene. The whole tesseract scene. The geometry the crew constructed is an honest attempt to explain to the audience that our world would look very different from a higher dimension. His team tried to build a rigid geometrical idea, thinking about Escher’s work or any number of artists, and build a set that could demonstrate it. Chris came up with an array, a matrix representing all the information of a four-dimensional world in three dimensions or a five-dimensional world in four, depending on where you count time.\n\nStyle & Writing Process\n\nMany scriptwriters begin writing with an outline or a storyline. Nolan’s writing process is entirely non-linear. He doesn’t outline anything. He starts with page one and writes it very linearly, especially if it is not linear. Nolan prefers to go with the flow of the narrative. He tends to write them a very free form and in great length. He will write three or four pages and then spend days just editing it.\n\nNolan’s films are known for their unconventional structures and tight plots. Instead of using outlines to organize and keep track of the story, the director has an alternate means to maintain the order. “What I do is draw many diagrams — particularly if there’s a type of structural complexity. I’ll sticky stuff all over my walls,” Often, these diagrams are shelved or ignored when a more exciting order arises. If he discovers a mathematical or a scientific model, he draws pictures that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that he is after.\n\nWhen he did his first film — Following, Nolan decided to write it as a chronological story and then edited it to make all the non-linear divisions. He found it very difficult because he then had to do an enormous amount of rewriting to make it flow for the audience.\n\nDirectorial Style\n\nNolan prefers to shoot without a planned list of shots or storyboards and still keeps track of everything happening in the scene. In his head, he has always been able to visualize what he wants mentally, and he can lie there at night and cut the film in his head, one shot at a time, all the way through the whole thing.\n\nNolan decided not to shoot The Dark Knight Rises in 3-D to be stylistically consistent with the first two films and push the IMAX capability to create a high-quality image. He found stereoscopic imaging too small scale and intimate in its effect. He thinks films are already 3-D. Stereoscopic imaging gives each audience member an individual perspective and unique experience. It’s well suited to video games and other immersive technologies, but stereoscopic is hard to embrace for the audience's experience. So he prefers the big canvas, looking up at an enormous screen and at an image that feels larger than life."
