He then appeared in films like \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), \"The Aviator\" (2004), and \"Shutter Island\" (2010).\n\nActors like Brad Pitt and Will Smith were reportedly offered the role of Dominick Cobb before DiCaprio was cast as the \"Inception\" lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's an Academy Award-winning actor who's played the lead in several box-office hits.\n\nAfter his role in \"Inception,\" DiCaprio took on ambitious Hollywood projects like \"Django Unchained\" (2012), \"The Great Gatsby\" (2013), and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013).\n\nIn 2015, he starred in the survival drama \"The Revenant,\" winning his first Academy Award for his performance as a frontiersman navigating brutal conditions in the wild.\n\nIn 2019, he gained attention for playing a washed-up actor named Rick Dalton in Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood.\"\n\nMost recently, DiCaprio's been working on Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" a drama set among the Osage tribe in Osage County, Nebraska. The film will be released in October 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt played Arthur, Cobb's right-hand man.\n\nAs a child, the actor appeared on the television series \"3rd Rock From the Sun\" before moving into film. Gordon-Levitt then matured into challenging projects like \"Latter Days\" (2003) and \"The Lookout\" (2007).\n\nHis performance as a heartbroken romantic in the 2009 indie hit \"(500) Days of Summer\" gained attention from critics, and he also played The Doctor/Rex in \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\" (2009) before working on Nolan's film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's appeared in numerous critically acclaimed films in addition to proving his ability behind the camera.\n\nGordon-Levitt worked with Nolan again as Blake in \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012).

Cotillard also starred opposite Adam Driver in \"Annette,\" a 2021 musical that kicked off the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nOutside of filming, she's been the face of luxury advertising campaigns for brands like Dior and Chanel. Cotillard has also used her platform for environmental activism, serving as a longtime spokesperson for the NGO Greenpeace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCillian Murphy played Robert Fischer, the heir to a multi-billion dollar fortune.\n\nBefore taking on the role of Robert Fischer in \"Inception,\" the Irish actor caught his big on-screen break in the post-apocalyptic film \"28 Days Later\" (2002).\n\nHis other early credits included \"Intermission\" (2003), \"Red Eye\" (2005), and \"Breakfast on Pluto\" (2005).\n\nMurphy worked with Nolan for the first time as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in \"Batman Begins\" (2005).

Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliot Page played Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing dreams.\n\nPage appeared in a series of television shows like \"Pit Pony,\" \"Trailer Park Boys,\" and \"ReGenesis\" before his breakthrough role as a pregnant teenager in the romantic comedy \"Juno\" (2007).\n\nHe also had parts in \"Smart People\" (2008) and \"Whip It\" (2009) before being cast as an intelligent, curious architecture student in \"Inception,\" which was his first time working with Nolan.\n\nPage admitted in his 2023 memoir \"Pageboy\" that he came down with a case of shingles while shooting \"Inception\" because he was suffering high levels of stress while working on the project and trying to navigate \"chaos\" in his personal life.\n\n\"Despite everyone being delightful to work with, I felt out of place,\" he wrote of the Christopher Nolan-directed movie, adding: \"In a cast full of cis men, I did not understand the role I found myself in.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's played a wide range of characters and is a cast member on Netflix's \"The Umbrella Academy.\"\n\nPage has proven his on-screen versatility since filming \"Inception\" in 2010.\n\nHe's appeared in films like the romantic satire \"To Rome With Love\" (2012), the action-packed \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" (2014), and the drama \"Tallulah\" (2016).\n\nMost recently, he starred on Netflix's \"The Umbrella Academy,\" a series based on Gerard Way's comic book series of the same name.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Page came out as transgender and said he uses both he/him and they/them pronouns.\n\nIn 2023, he released his memoir, \"Pageboy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Caine played professor Stephen Miles, the protagonist's father-in-law and mentor.\n\nLong before he played Cobb's father-in-law, the British actor was an icon in the film industry.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor — for his roles in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"Cider House Rules\" — has been acting since the '50s and gained attention for breakthrough performances in films like \"Alfie\" (1966) and \"The Italian Job\" (1969).\n\nHe worked with Nolan for the first time in \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and has appeared in over 100 films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor had a role in Nolan's 2020 film \"Tenet.\"\n\nCaine has established a strong partnership with Nolan since their first collaboration in 2005 and has since been cast in eight of the filmmaker's projects — including \"Interstellar\" (2014), \"Dunkirk\" (2017), and \"Tenet\" (2020).\n\nThe actor has also stayed busy with roles in a variety of other films, such as \"Twist,\" an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel \"Oliver Twist,\" and \"Now You See Me 3,\" the third installment of the popular heist franchise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKen Watanabe was cast as Saito, a wealthy business mogul who hires Cobb to plant an idea in his rival's subconscious.\n\nWatanabe had a long film career in Japan before Western audiences were introduced to him in \"The Last Samurai\" (2003).\n\nTwo years later, he worked with Nolan for the first time as Ra's al Ghul in \"Batman Begins.\"\n\nNolan had such a positive experience working with Watanabe that he wrote the character of Saito with the actor in mind.\n\n\"I wrote the part specifically for Ken because I wanted to work with him again. I enjoyed directing him so much on 'Batman Begins,' but his role was smaller and we didn't have a lot of time together,\" Nolan told Warner Bros.\n\n\"This time I made sure he had a bigger part. Ken is an extremely charismatic performer, a true movie star. He is a consummate actor who knows how to get the most out of every scene. It's just a pleasure to watch him work,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's been in several major blockbuster films and the Max series \"Tokyo Vice.\"\n\nAfter \"Inception,\" Watanabe appeared in \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" (2014), \"Godzilla\" (2014), and a 2018 revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \"The King & I.\"\n\nMore recently, he's appeared in \"Pokémon:Detective Pikachu\" (2019) and \"Godzilla: King of Monsters\" (2019).\n\nWatanabe then appeared as a detective in the Tokyo Police Department in Max's 2022 series \"Tokyo Vice,\" inspired by American journalist Jake Adelstein's 2009 memoir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDileep Rao appeared as Yusuf, a man who concocts the drugs needed to enter the dream state.\n\nBefore playing Yusuf in \"Inception,\" Rao starred in the supernatural horror film \"Drag Me to Hell\" (2009) and also appeared in the James Cameron hit film \"Avatar\" (2009).\n\nIn a 2020 interview with Film Companion he said, \"I think we knew we were working with Chris on something original. You have to believe you can reach the audience in a special place. I think people love it because it's unlike anything else and it has shading and ambiguity in it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe reprised his role as Max Patel in James Cameron's \"Avatar\" sequel.\n\nFollowing his role in Nolan's film, Rao made appearances on several TV series including \"Z Nation,\" \"Con Man,\" and \"Mr. Robot.\"\n\nIn 2022, he reprised his role as Dr. Max Patel in Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and is also set to appear in the upcoming films in the franchise. \"The Way of Water\" is the third highest-grossing film of all time, bringing in more than $2.3 billion at the box office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Hardy played Eames, who can transform into different people while inside of dreams.\n\nBefore he played the master impersonator in \"Inception,\" Hardy was introduced to audiences as Twombly in his first film, \"Black Hawk Down\" (2001).\n\nThe British actor also landed roles in \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" (2002) and \"RocknRolla\" (2008).\n\n\"Inception\" marked Hardy's first collaboration with Nolan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued to work with Nolan and joined the Mad Max franchise.\n\nThe relationships that the British actor formed while filming \"Inception\" carried over after the film wrapped.\n\nHardy went on to star in Nolan's \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) and \"Dunkirk\" (2017).
