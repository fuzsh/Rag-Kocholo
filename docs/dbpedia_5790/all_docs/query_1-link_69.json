Gordon-Levitt then matured into challenging projects like \"Latter Days\" (2003) and \"The Lookout\" (2007).\n\nHis performance as a heartbroken romantic in the 2009 indie hit \"(500) Days of Summer\" gained attention from critics, and he also played The Doctor/Rex in \"G.I.

I enjoyed directing him so much on 'Batman Begins,' but his role was smaller and we didn't have a lot of time together,\" Nolan told Warner Bros.\n\n\"This time I made sure he had a bigger part. Ken is an extremely charismatic performer, a true movie star. He is a consummate actor who knows how to get the most out of every scene. It's just a pleasure to watch him work,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's been in several major blockbuster films and the Max series \"Tokyo Vice.\"\n\nAfter \"Inception,\" Watanabe appeared in \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" (2014), \"Godzilla\" (2014), and a 2018 revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \"The King & I.\"\n\nMore recently, he's appeared in \"PokÃ©mon:Detective Pikachu\" (2019) and \"Godzilla: King of Monsters\" (2019).\n\nWatanabe then appeared as a detective in the Tokyo Police Department in Max's 2022 series \"Tokyo Vice,\" inspired by American journalist Jake Adelstein's 2009 memoir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDileep Rao appeared as Yusuf, a man who concocts the drugs needed to enter the dream state.\n\nBefore playing Yusuf in \"Inception,\" Rao starred in the supernatural horror film \"Drag Me to Hell\" (2009) and also appeared in the James Cameron hit film \"Avatar\" (2009).\n\nIn a 2020 interview with Film Companion he said, \"I think we knew we were working with Chris on something original. You have to believe you can reach the audience in a special place. I think people love it because it's unlike anything else and it has shading and ambiguity in it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe reprised his role as Max Patel in James Cameron's \"Avatar\" sequel.\n\nFollowing his role in Nolan's film, Rao made appearances on several TV series including \"Z Nation,\" \"Con Man,\" and \"Mr. Robot.\"\n\nIn 2022, he reprised his role as Dr. Max Patel in Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and is also set to appear in the upcoming films in the franchise. \"The Way of Water\" is the third highest-grossing film of all time, bringing in more than $2.3 billion at the box office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Hardy played Eames, who can transform into different people while inside of dreams.\n\nBefore he played the master impersonator in \"Inception,\" Hardy was introduced to audiences as Twombly in his first film, \"Black Hawk Down\" (2001).\n\nThe British actor also landed roles in \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" (2002) and \"RocknRolla\" (2008).\n\n\"Inception\" marked Hardy's first collaboration with Nolan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued to work with Nolan and joined the Mad Max franchise.\n\nThe relationships that the British actor formed while filming \"Inception\" carried over after the film wrapped.\n\nHardy went on to star in Nolan's \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) and \"Dunkirk\" (2017).
