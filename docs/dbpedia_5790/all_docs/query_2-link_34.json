        "text": "This is the first film I’ve watched off a DVD since the end of January. For the next few weeks I’ll be watching the most recent films to have been accumulated over that six month period, in order of purchase.\n\nThat starts with Christopher Nolan’s highly-regarded 2010 production, Inception. Why I chose that I’m now uncertain: you may recall that my penultimate film before going over to Youtube was the same writer/director’s later effort, Tenet, about which I was not impressed. But Inception had a better reputation, and it was dirt cheap too, so that explains it.\n\nImmediately, I’ll say that I didn’t like it. Not one bit. The film had too large strikes against it before i started to watch it. One was that I am very much out of practice at films that are not straightforward and simple, telling a story in clear and undisguised terms and another that I started watching the film early on, after two successive nights of very little sleep. These factors shouold be borne in mind as influencing what I have to say.\n\nBut the film took a decisive hit in its opening scenes, which were not only deliberately obscure but took place in that special film lighting that leaves you constantly straining to see just what is happening. Why this is such a modish thing now, I cannot understand. Perhaps it makes Directors think that their films are automatically dark and mysterious on a conceptual level, as a result of it being physically impossible to see what’s happening.\n\nMy reaction to this is that if the Director doesn’t want you to see what people are doing, why the fuck should I care what people are doing?\n\nThe effect of this was to detach me from the story the moment I realised what Nolan was doing. I couldn’t form any kind of attachment to the characters nor the story after that, which was the biggest single factor in making the film fail for me on every single level because there was no human element. Even the daylight scenes looked washed out, as if they were taking place just before dawn, when the sun is not yet up but it’s pre-light is scrossing the sky.\n\nGiven that the story is literally fantastic, being based upon the notion of being able to enter into a person’s dreams to steal information from them or, in this instance, plant a sub-conscious impulse into them, to do what you want them to do, the story needed to be grounded in human characters, recognisable to use even in the most implausible of settings. Instead, Nolan indulged himself, far too much, in SFX, including CGI, to create events that were conspicuously not real (unlike the CGI of a Marvel film, which is intent on convincing you that what is happening is real. It was spectacle for the sake of spectacle, showing off because Nolan could do it and overdone every single time. Every such aspect went on and on, stretched out beyond its own effectiveness into an end in itself: enough, already, we got it!\n\nAn hour in, it was as if Nolan had decided the film was being too cerebral, so he abrupty and without warning switched the film over to be an all-action extravaganza of car chases, crashes, guns and bullets, explosions, insanity. We were deep in the dream now, and just when one scenario was getting stale (or rather about fifteen minutes after that point), videogame style we would drop another level into something completely different and proceed to wring every drop of moisture out of that before we did exactly the same kind of thing again.\n\nFrankly, Inception was an insanely long film, 142 minutes that literally felt like twice as long to get through. It felt as if Nolan, like many other modern Directors, simply could not bring himself to end it but kept on adding more false endings, one, two, a dozen, stacked up in a landing pattern, before finally reaching what to, implausibly, had to reach the ground in the slowest, most portentous and frankly risible ending of them all, an attempt to add depth and significance that was absent all along but which allowed him to end the film on a note of ambiguity that was no ending at all: the audience had to pay its money and make its choice as to which of the two scenarios were implied, that is if, like me, they weren’t halfway across the foyer by that time, deciding that standing in the rain waiting for a bus wasn’t the better option.\n\nI’m sorry, but to me this film was a disaster, simply because it was over-developed. It had an intriguing idea behind it, done to death by the failure of Nolan to resist throwing in more kitchen sinks than Bill Forsyth had in That Sinking Feeling. Just because you can present the impossible plausibly on screen doesn’t mean that you have to. As for that ambiguous ending, I found it ironic and amusing that the best and most psychologically accurate response to it’s choice of two opposing options, coming from Nolan’s wife and co-Producer Ellen Thomas was almost literally, ‘So what?’"
