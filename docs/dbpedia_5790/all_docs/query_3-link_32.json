        "text": "At the risk of obscene reductionism—but in the interest of quickly categorizing his diverse filmography—we might say this: Every Christopher Nolan movie is about Time. Of course, time is the basic engine of suspense; give a hero a deadline (a bomb, a military evacuation, a dying Earth, an answer hidden in memory), and we have drama. But Nolan is interested in time less as a narrative device and more as an impressionistic tool. He wants to manipulate how a viewer experiences time, which tends to be the goal not just of his own movies, but rather the enterprise of his medium. And so, time, depicted on screen, becomes itself a window into something else: cinema.\n\nMovies are manipulations of time. Editing, cinematography, sound—these techniques capture less an absolute time than a time relative to the viewer. If Roger Ebert’s definition of cinema is a machine that generates empathy, Nolan’s take seems to be more formalistic. For Nolan, a movie is a magic trick. It accomplishes something seemingly impossible, something we want to try and figure out. His movies then become puzzles that invite the viewer to participate in the artform. We ask ourselves, “how did he do it?” And more importantly: we rewatch.\n\nIt makes sense that Nolan wants his viewers to engage so closely with the medium. He shoots on film. He extols the virtues of cinema as a theater-going experience. He is particular (pedantic, really) about sound and aspect ratio and the technicalities of watching a movie.\n\nThis kind of meta reflection on film, however, never detracts from the basic joy of watching, and more than any other contemporary filmmaker (save for, perhaps, James Cameron), Nolan understands that for all its technical brilliance, a film still needs to put asses in seats. And thus, he has become king of the indie blockbuster—if we can call it that—a cinematic experience that unites both film nerds and popcorn-stuffing masses. Which is why all he needs to do is slap his name on a film and the people will see it.\n\nNow with his twelfth film, Oppenheimer, likely ballooning like a mushroom cloud over the Oscars themselves, we figured it's a good time to take stock of Nolan’s filmography. Every movie about time and cinema and good old fashioned Hitchcockian suspense.\n\nHere is every Christopher Nolan movie, ranked."
