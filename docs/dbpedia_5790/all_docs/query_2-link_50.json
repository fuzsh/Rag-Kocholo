        "text": "Hi, I’m Eric!\n\nFirst, the miscellaneous stuff. I am a big music and film fan, am married to a talented artist named Lynette, have one cat (or she keeps us, not sure which), no kids, and consider myself a regular kind of guy. I work a little too much, supported by an overactive sense of purpose, and coffee. I’m a classic self-starter that doesn’t know he can’t do something until it’s too late. I do not have a degree in writing, did not originally intend to become an author, and honestly, I’ve had to train myself to sit still long enough to write for any length of time. I’m based in Maui, Hawaii, and divide my time between assisting all of my clients in the synergizing of their creative energy, the elimination of fears, and developing a greater understanding of the forces that shape their consciousness; and, writing the growing Inception Publishing catalog. Suffice it to say, I do not have any time for hobbies, but I do like to stare off into the sky for extended periods whenever I’m not sure what my next move is.\n\nWhat do I do exactly?\n\nI’m an author, personal development trainer, and I lead this publishing and social transformation group we call Inception Publishing. I’m the community originator and lead author for Inception Publishing, and we specialize in energetic research, fear elimination, and the training of Coherence Verification for personal and social improvement.\n\nSince 2002 I have been professionally focused on training individuals and organizations how to eliminate the perceived limitations in their ability to consciously create their lives and careers. I’ve combined my extensive research in the developing field of consciousness studies with my experience in creative business development, personality type identification, philosophy, alternative health modalities, stress reduction, and the liberal arts, to create practical methods to this end.\n\nThe result of this work has been a depth and breadth of training materials that I’m now putting into books and self-guided educational processes. This is the author portion of what I do. With the help of my best friend and wife, artist Lynette Pradiga, and a few super amazing friends, we are turning that educational process into something much larger. Voila, Inception Publishing. My next major goal is to start small Coherence Verification practice groups throughout the world so that individuals are equipped to influence their communities in significant ways that reach far beyond what we can accomplish with some books and words of wisdom. That is the “community originator” part of my job.\n\nWhat’s all this stuff about Coherence Verification, Truth, and Inception?\n\nCoherence Verification is a process of using the brain and body to identify and delineate the information and energy that makes up you, and everything else in the universe. In other words, you are like a computer monitor that can ‘show’ all the processes and information that is happening in you, and around you. Everything is a combination of energy and information, kind of like the binary code in a computer. Coherence Verification is a process we go through to read that code, and because everything has a code, we can now discover just about anything in the universe that is important to us.\n\nOne of the most important things we’ve discovered is that everything is built on a few dozen rules, or laws, if you will. Some of these laws you already know a bit about like gravity, and the fact that the biological world is always replicating itself, but with slight modifications.\n\nStated differently, there are universal laws that govern everything, and the scientific community is aware of some, but there are more we have found. We call these universal laws, Truths (always with a capital ’T’) because they are reliable and virtually permanent. They are just the way things are. When human decision making is based on Truth, things turn out well, and we are considerably happier. When we make decisions in opposition to the Truth, we are swimming against the current, and so life gets kind of crappy.\n\nNow, I know that many of us have heard talk about this whole truth thing being kind of flexible, and that no one has cornered the market on the truth. However, these ideas about truth always come down to the basics of what we can consistently and repeatedly confirm to be the case. We can now consistently confirm that there are some basic, reliable facts and functions that make it all go ‘round, and we simply haven’t been aware of those Truths until recently. Now that we are aware of them, it makes perfect sense to adjust course and make the journey more effective, healthy, and enjoyable.\n\nOne of the most important Truths in human experience is that everyone is a valuable, creative participant in the ongoing making of the universe. When we are choosing to be fearful, we aren’t really making anything but a mess. When we are definitive in our intentions, and those intentions are aligned with Truth, then we are creating things and experiences of value. In those moments, we are being “inceptional.” It’s our job at Inception Publishing to show you how to become more inceptional than you are at the moment, and also how to avoid making life unnecessarily difficult.\n\nHow do you get involved? Well, let me tell you…\n\nFirst, if you like the idea of learning more about how the universe works, how to eliminate obnoxious fears, how to have a greater sense of purpose, or how to tell the difference between truth and falsehoods with ease, then we are the folks to help you with that. In the coming months and years we will be publishing many books on these subjects, creating an online academy to help you teach yourself, and establishing a network of similarly minded people for you to connect with. There will be many ways to get intellectually and practically involved, and supporting us on Patreon is step one."
