        "text": "Every Christopher Nolan movie is a major event for the film industry. From 'The Dark Knight' to 'Tenet', and others like 'Inception', all of the releases have attracted millions of viewers around the world.\n\nThe filmmaker captivates audiences with his peculiar way of working, and for 'Oppenheimer', he followed a traditionally unique creative process.\n\nFor the famed director, there are few things more distracting during the scriptwriting process than smartphones, something he recently addressed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"My kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite,\" said Nolan. \"I would actually resist that description.\n\n\"I think technology and what it can provide is amazing. My personal choice is about how involved I get.\"\n\n\"It's about the level of distraction. If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me.\"\n\nWhat was Nolan's writing process for 'Oppenheimer'?\n\nNolan also spoke about the process he went through with his most recent script, which was done in the first person.\n\n\"I actually wrote in the first-person, which I've never done before,\" he added. \"I don't know if anyone's ever done it before.\n\n\"But the point of it is, with the color sequences, which is the bulk of the film, everything is told from Oppenheimer's point of view - you're literally kind of looking through his eyes.\"\n\nSpeaking about his objectives for the film, Nolan continued: \"I wanted to really go through this story with Oppenheimer; I didn't want to sit by him and judge him.\n\n\"That seemed a pointless exercise. That's more the stuff of documentary, or political theory, or history of science.\n\n\"This is a story that you experience with him - you don't judge him. You are faced with these irreconcilable ethical dilemmas with him.\"\n\nFinally, Nolan spoke about how artificial intelligence can be used for good, although he did remind people of the danger of giving the technology the same value as humans.\n\n\"The rise of companies in the last 15 years bandying words like algorithm - not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense - these guys don't know what an algorithm is,\" Nolan said.\n\n\"People in my business talking about it, they just don't want to take responsibility for whatever that algorithm does.\n\n\"Applied to AI, that's a terrifying possibility. Terrifying. Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately.\n\n\"They'll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we're doomed.\n\n\"It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.\""
