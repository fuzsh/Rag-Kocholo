        "meta_description": "Acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in an original sci-fi action film that travels around the globe and into the intimate and infinite world of dreams. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb’s rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.",

        "text": "Leonardo Dicaprio plays an expert in dream extraction in this film, a man who enters people’s dreams and captures their secrets. The plot is intriguing and the story is executed with a lot of violence with surprisingly little blood. Although many of the characters who are shot are “dream” characters, it still seems very real. The acting is solid and the director manages to convey an atmosphere in which the viewer may sense the “delirium” of some of the characters including Dom Cobb (DiCaprio).\n\nHowever, with several scenes of people being shot and stabbed, explosions and fights, we have a bit of, if you will excuse the expression, overkill. Throw in the car crashes too and you have a lot of on screen action but much of it violent in its expression. The movie will make you think, and there certainly is nothing wrong with that. Anyone who has had a secret unwillingly revealed will relate to this movie on some level. It is too bad that both the violence and language content is too strong for us to award our Dove “Family-Approved” Seal to this movie as a family-friendly film."
