        "text": "Inception (2010) is one of those movies that you can’t quite seem to shake, even days after you’ve watched it. Director Christopher Nolan beautifully and uniquely crafted this enticing, captivating Sci-Fi film with actor Leonardo DiCaprio being the face of it all.\n\nInception follows Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who has the ability to enter people’s dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. In that, he is given the chance to perform a nearly impossible task: plant an idea in someone’s mind—inception. In attempting this, however, he puts himself and his loved ones at risk of critical damage.\n\nI will be honest, this isn’t the first time I’ve watched this movie. However, the reason I chose this movie is because of its effect. I’ve rewatched this movie over 4 times, and each time I’ve watched it, I come out thinking of a new theory. Now, I won’t get into all the theories, but all of the one’s I’ve seen across Reddit just go to prove how much of a genius Christopher Nolan is. The ambiguous ending had our minds twisting and turning, making me dissect this movie to the seconds every time I rewatch it.\n\nBeyond that, the performances of the actors are what make this movie so intriguing and real; specifically the performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt (portrays Arthur) and Cillian Murphy (portrays Fischer).\n\nThis movie is not one that you can just sit back, watch, and enjoy; you must pay it your full attention and truly think about what’s happening. Many critics condemn this movie for being “confusing,” but it really isn’t as long as you pay close attention. That being said, if you are looking for a movie that doesn’t require much brain power, I would stray away from this one. On the contrary, if you are looking for a movie that gets you thinking and will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time, Inception is the movie for you."
