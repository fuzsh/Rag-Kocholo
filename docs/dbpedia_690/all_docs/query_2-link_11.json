        "text": "What does the IFSC Code Stand for?\n\nIFSC is a short abbreviation of the term “Indian Financial System Code.” IFSC code is a standardized code facilitated by The Reserve Bank of India for identifying a particular branch of any bank. It is a unique, 11-character-long alphanumeric code that streamlines the online fund transaction by fetching any bank details.\n\nWith an IFSC code, it is possible to make any online transaction successful in India. As we know that NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), and RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) systems are three mainstream digital fund transfer systems in India that are frequently used by most millennials and Gen-Z. It is essential to learn more about IFSC.\n\nUnderstand the Format of the IFSC Code\n\nIFSC code is an 11-character-long code. In this, the first 4-characters are alphabetic, depicting the bank code assigned by the government authority of India. The next character is zero, reserved for future usage. And the last 6-characters are usually numeric (can be alphabetic also), depicting the branch name of that particular bank.\n\nFor example- The IFSC code for Axis bank, Ambikapur, is UTIB0000041.\n\nPerks of Using IFSC Code\n\nQuick & secure payment transfer\n\nFacilitates online banking or net banking operations\n\nInstant money transfer\n\nError-free money transactions\n\nInstant transfer of funds via NEFT and RTGS\n\nImmediate payment validation and reconciliation\n\nPaperless cash transaction\n\nHow to Know the IFSC Code of Your Branch?\n\nYou can fetch your IFSC code details from the following locations:\n\nPassbook\n\nCheque leaf\n\nOfficial bank website\n\nRBI website\n\nAside from the above stated, try typing IFSC code Axis bank, Ambikapur in Google. The tech giant brings you back with an immediate result i. e. UTIB0000041. In case you want to file your ITR online, you can use this code to process your internet transactions.\n\nWhat MICR Code Stands for?\n\nMICR code is another popular acronym used for representing “Magnetic Ink Character Recognition” technology in the financial industry. It is a unique code that is universally accepted for sending or receiving money from one bank to another bank located abroad or anywhere in the globe. It makes the sorting, processing, and clearance of any transaction via cheques, a hassle-free task. MICR code works on character recognition technology that enables faster processing of cheques and other banking documents.\n\nSome primary tools, such as MICR readers, identify the particular branch details of the payee’s bank by scanning the MICR code printed on the cheque. Here, MICR readers magnetize the code and read the deployed character on it. The only drawback with this useful technology is that it strictly requires expensive iron oxide ink entailing in MICR printing."
