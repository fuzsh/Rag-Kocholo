        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Election 2024 Phase-3: In the upcoming third phase of Assam's Lok Sabha Elections on May 7, 61 candidates, including sitting MPs, former MPs, ministers, and MLAs, vie for victory. Key battles include contests in Silchar, Karimganj, Nagaon, and Darrang-Udalguri. Meanwhile, the first phase saw a robust voter turnout of 78.25 percent across five constituencies. With diverse candidates and intense campaigning, Assam's electoral landscape is primed for a dynamic contest.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Election 2024 Phase-2: Assam plays a pivotal role in Indian politics, especially during Lok Sabha Elections, owing to its proximity to Bhutan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. Traditionally, Congress dominated the Lok Sabha seats in the state, but the BJP's emergence since 2014 has reshaped the landscape, resulting in a decline in Congress's influence and the ascent of BJP as a formidable presence in Assam.\n\nIn the upcoming second phase of polls for five Lok Sabha seats in Assam on April 26, a total of 61 candidates are in contention, including notable figures such as sitting MPs, former MPs, ministers, and MLAs. With the stage set for the second phase, the electoral landscape in Assam is marked by a diverse array of candidates and intense campaigning efforts by various political parties.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections Phase 3: Contestant Breakdown\n\nConstituenciesCandidatesKokrajharGorjan Mashahary (Congress-INDIA) vs Jayanta Basumatary (UPPL-NDA)DhubriRakibul Hussain (INC-INDIA) vs Zabed Islam (AGP-NDA)BarpetaDeep Bayan (INC-INIDA) vs Phani Bhushan Choudhury ( AGP-NDA)GuwahatiMira Barthakur Goswami (INC- INDIA) vs Bijuli Kalita Medhi (BJP-NDA)\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections Phase 3: Key Battles\n\nAssam Minister Parimal Suklabaidya, representing the BJP, is facing off against TMC's Radheshyam Biswas and Congress' Surya Kanta Sarkar in Silchar. Meanwhile, sitting MP Kripanath Mallah of BJP is contesting against Congress' Hafiz Rashid Ahmed Choudhury and AIUDF's Sahabul Islam Choudhury in Karimganj.\n\nIn Nagaon, sitting Congress MP Pradyut Borodoloi is up against BJP's Suresh Bora and AIUDF's Aminul Islam. In Darrang-Udalguri, BJP's Dilip Saikia competes with Congress' Madhab Rajbangshi and BPF's Durgadas Boro.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections Phase 3:\n\nThe third phase of polls for four parliamentary constituencies, including Dhubri, Kokrajhar, Barpeta, and Gauhati, will be held on May 7th.\n\nVoter Turnout\n\nMore than 77.26 lakh voters across the five seats are expected to exercise their franchise on April 26, contributing to the democratic process in the state.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections: Previous Elections and Current Scenario:\n\nIn the 2014 elections, the BJP secured seven out of the 14 seats, a number that rose to nine in 2019, marking their highest tally yet. With the upcoming 2024 elections looming, the BJP aims to further strengthen its position, while Congress is determined to make a significant resurgence. The elections are expected to be fiercely contested, reflecting the evolving political landscape in Assam.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Phases\n\nThis marks the first election in Assam following last year's delimitation exercise. Voting will take place on April 19, April 26, and May 7. Despite the BJP-led government in Assam requesting the Election Commission (EC) to hold the polls before the Bohag Bihu celebrations, the EC decided to conduct the elections in three phases in the state, commencing on April 19, right after the festival.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Constituencies\n\nAssam holds the 14th position among states with the most Lok Sabha seats, boasting 14 constituencies. Of these, 11 are unreserved, while two seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST) and one for Scheduled Castes (SC). In 2019, the BJP emerged as the dominant party in the state, winning nine seats, while Congress secured three.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Outlook for the 2024 Elections\n\nIn the upcoming 2024 elections, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is hopeful of increasing its share of seats compared to 2019, citing its expanding influence in Assam's political arena. Conversely, Congress, supported by the newly formed I.N.D.I.A alliance, is preparing for a robust electoral performance, aiming for a significant turnaround in the national political landscape.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Candidates\n\nList of constituencies and elected members from the 17th Lok Sabha Elections in Assam:\n\nNoConstituencyElected MembersParty1KarimganjKripanath MallahBJP2SilcharRajdeep RoyBJP3Autonomous DistrictHoren Singh BeyBJP4DhubriBadruddin AjmalAIUDF5KokrajharNaba Kumar SaraniaIND6BarpetaAbdul KhalequeINC7GauhatiQueen OjaBJP8MangaldoiDilip SaikiaBJP9TezpurPallab Lochan DasBJP10NowgongPradyut BordoloiINC11KaliaborGourav GogoiINC12JorhatTopon Kumar GogoiBJP13DibrugarhRameswar TeliBJP14LakhimpurPradan BaruahBJP\n\nIn the upcoming 2024 elections, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is optimistic about increasing its seat share compared to 2019, citing its growing influence in Assam's political landscape. However, the Indian National Congress (INC), with the support of their newly formed I.N.D.I.A alliance, is gearing up for a strong electoral performance, aiming for a historic turnaround in the national political scenario. The elections are expected to be fiercely contested, with both alliances vying for a significant share of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in Assam.\n\nAssam Lok Sabha Elections: What Happened in 2019 Lok Sabha elections\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
