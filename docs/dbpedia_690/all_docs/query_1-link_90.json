This loss can be adjusted against income from other heads in the current year subject to the limit of Rs. 2 lakh.\n\nI. Tax benefit in case you have the self-occupied property (SOP):\n\nThe maximum interest of Rs. 2, 00, 000 is allowable in case a loan is taken for the purchase or construction of your house.

Provided you take a certificate of interest from the person to whom you had paid interest.\n\nWhere a loan is taken from your friends, relatives, or any money lender i.e. other than banks the repayment of principal is not eligible for deduction under section 80C.\n\nThis part of the form may take more time to finish if you are claiming maximum tax benefits. If you do not have any deductions to make, you can then move on to the last section.\n\nV. Deductions under Chapter VI-A\n\nChapter VI-A covers income tax deduction under various sections like 80C, 80D (Medical insurance) 80G (Donation), etc. To claim the deduction, evidence of investment made or expenditure incurred is required.
