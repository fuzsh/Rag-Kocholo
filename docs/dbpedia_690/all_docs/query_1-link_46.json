        "text": "United Bank IFSC code in silapathar\n\nUnited Bank IFSC code in silapathar is an 11 digit code used in online fund transfers. All the banks have number of branches spread across the country. It is not always feasible to wait for United Bank India physical cheques to travel across the country to transfer funds. Internet banking provides a solution to this. To carry out online transactions using RTGS, IMPS or NEFT, each bank branch needs to be identified individually. IFSC codes for United Bank in United Bank India are used for the same purpose and hence are unique. NOTE that not all branches support electronic fund transfer, only those approved by RBI can provide such facility. The United Bank IFSC code list for silapathar is provided by RBI."
