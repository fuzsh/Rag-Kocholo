We're not a store, and by we I mean me.

I'm just one guy üö∂ who has owned most of these shirts. i have hoarded, collected and displayed them all on Minorthread.com. Now it's time to purge, and let it all go. I am trying to release a new batch at least once a week and chip away at the entire collection little by little.

ALSO: üê∂ Very sorry if a dog hair gets in the package, i can't help it. i try my best though.
