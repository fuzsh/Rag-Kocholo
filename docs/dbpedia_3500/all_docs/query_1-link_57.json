        "text": "When I first saw Hard Boiled it was between two life altering chapters in my life. I broke up with this chick I was dating on Christmas Day 1992 (yeah, can you believe it, of all days to have a relationship end) and in October 1996 I got into a near fatal car accident thanks to an old lady running a stop sign (head on collision too). So, in those four years as I was mostly trying to come to grips with the emotional grief of one extreme, while about to head into the physical turmoil of another, I made some “memory movies,” and this is the review of one of them. I’m not sure when exactly I saw Hard Boiled though. I can narrow it down to either spring 1995 or spring 1996. But, yet, I’m also not sure if I saw it from the VHS I bought or from a cable airing that prompted me to buy it, or if I’m just confusing that purchase with Woo’s The Killer (1989) that I saw around the same time and that I can remember vividly watching and then hitting the store to buy it.\n\nThere was a couple of months in that spring ’95/’96 where cable aired a couple of director John Woo’s movies. This is how I first saw A Better Tomorrow (1986) and The Killer (1989), and, just, maybe, Hard Boiled. I was fully aware of who John Woo was, though, thanks to Fangoria magazine, which is kind of odd, if you’re aware Fangoria is a horror movie magazine, but there was some article in that magazine that mentioned him and his movies. Fangoria covered movies from all over the globe, so all I can guess is there was an article covering some Asian horror, or something Asian related that brought up something connected to Woo. I also have a memory of catching a scene from The Killer on TV. From what show I couldn’t tell you. It was a clip from the shoot-out in the church, where two of the main characters are about to engage in some gun-fu, and they both switch weapons by tossing them to each other, and the way it was filmed, and that particular action, I had never seen in a film before. I remember thinking I need to see that movie!\n\nBefore those spring airings I remember it was his movies he made between 1986 and 1992 that I occasionally came across in Fangoria (?) and other magazines: A Better Tomorrow (1986), A Better Tomorrow II (1987), The Killer (1989) Just Heroes (1989), Bullet In The Head (1990), Once A Thief (1991) and Hard Boiled (1992). For the longest time I thought this was the entire list of his movies, until I got on IMDB at some point and realized he was making movies all the way back to 1968. I always thought he was a relatively new director. I may have seen A Better Tomorrow II and Once A Thief, but I can’t recall now. Of those three I did see my favorites were The Killer and Hard Boiled.\n\nThankfully, I have pictorial evidence I once owned The Killer and Hard Boiled on VHS. I knew for a fact I did with Hard Boiled, but until I came across this photo a year ago in an old photo album, I had totally forgotten I also owned The Killer. This image is actually in the background. This photo was one I took of a cat I had at the time, she was walking through my room and when I snapped the photo one of the side doors of my TV stand/entertainment center was cracked open and you can see the movies.\n\nAgain, I wish I could remember where I bought those two movies from. I had to be either from a catalog, or at the store at the mall. It was called Saturday Matinee and I loved that damn store. Yet, still, I have this thought they may have been ordered from this place out of New Jersey that used to specialize in anime and live action flicks. And, yes, I did see Woo’s American movie debut, Hard Target (1993), when it first came out. Funny, how I saw his first American movie before his Hong Kong ones.\n\nLet’s start with the basic plot first, Hard Boiled is an action crime thriller in the grand ol’ tradition of cops versus gangsters (Triad specifically). We get to know the cops first, specifically the movie’s hero Tequila Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) and his ill-fated partner, Benny Mak (Bowie Lam), who in the opening, like, I’m talking right after the title credit, end up in the middle of a massive shoot-out in a tea house the gun-runners they’re after are doing secret business in. This insane action scene sets the tone for what’s about to come throughout the rest of the flick, and what kind of boundary pushing cop Tequila is. By the way, cool ass name for an action hero, Tequila!\n\nMak is killed by this one particular gangster and Tequila seeks immediate revenge, successfully I might add, by ramming a bullet straight through his skull right between the eyes after a maddening burst of machine gun fire he crazily dodges while doing a roll over a table.\n\nThe next dude we get introduced to is Triad assassin Alan (Tony Leung). He looks much younger than Tequila. He’s on very good terms with Triad boss, Mr. Hoi (Kwan Hoi-shan), but is being pressured by another Triad boss by the name of Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong) to turn traitor on Hoi and be part of his gun smuggling business. But Alan’s got a secret, he’s really an undercover cop, who may have gotten too undercover for his own good. The question is, is he more gangster than cop? He genuinely seems to like Hoi and we can see the pain he’s going through when push comes to shove at the outset of the film’s next insane action piece to pick a side. He eventually chooses Wong’s, and kills Hoi and his man. But I got the impression he felt he had to do this to show Wong his loyalty, and if he did, he’d be able to get closer and arrest him.\n\nTequila has, or had, a girlfriend. She’s Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo); mostly office oriented, and has a rather small role in most of the film until the finale set piece in a hospital where Wong is secretly storing his arms in a specially constructed “bunker” underneath and accessible by a secret passage in the morgue. She’s also integral for communication between Alan and Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan), since no one on the force knows Alan’s undercover, and he routinely sends white roses to Chang with a line from a song that once deciphered on the computer by Pang yields whatever cryptic message Alan wants to send. Naturally, Tequila thinks she’s got an admirer and he’s jealous. The particulars of their relationship were mostly cut out at the script level, but there’s just enough left to let us know they were once an item and are broken up now. Recently broken up I felt.\n\nAlan and Tequila don’t formally meet until the warehouse shoot out, and an interesting shoot-out in that a second shoot-out happens in the same location moments later. I don’t think I ever seen that before in any other action movie. The first action set piece involves Wong and Alan hitting Hoi’s warehouse of arms, killing everyone and essentially taking it over, with the anticipation Hoi will show up in a short while, snd that’s when Wong and Alan can then take them out, thus owning Hoi’s operation. The “lull” in between is taken up nicely with Alan’s struggle with his conscience on what the hell to do about Hoi when he shows. Meanwhile, Tequila and the police have shown up during this “lull” and after Alan offs his old boss and the rest of his man, the second action piece begins where Tequila and Alan come face-to-face. At gun point I should stress. Tequila doesn’t yet know Alan’s an undercover cop, and Alan views Tequila’s constant butting in as a sign he’s going to fuck up his whole eventual takedown.\n\nWhat I loved about their meeting is it’s at the end of a gun in a Mexican standoff, with Tequila clearly intent on ending this perceived assassin’s life; he pulls the trigger on his revolver only to find he’s empty, but Alan does something he never expected, he smiles and takes off instead putting a bullet in Tequila’s neck. Ah-ha! Tequila is tipped off by this odd turn of events, confronts Pang and learns he’s an undercover cop.\n\nThe rest of the movie is watching Tequila and Alan form a truce and go after Wong and his operation, while suddenly dodging the possibility some of Wong’s man suspect Alan’s a cop, putting those rumors “out to pasture” and nailing Wong at the hospital. It would appear this has a downbeat ending, as you naturally assume if either of these men are going to die it’s going to be Alan, and he does, or does he? Final scene is Alan sailing away on his boat to possibly Alaska. He tells Tequila he’s always wanted to go there.\n\nIf I’m counting right there are four major action scenes in the movie, each one more explosive than the next, save for the ambush on Alan’s boat, which happens before the final act’s action, which I think runs a decent 20 or so minutes, with bad guys blowing away fleeing patients (don’t ask me why they did that. I couldn’t find any reason for it, until they learn, after the police show up, they can instead use them as hostages); Tequila and Alan double teaming the bad guys as they go through the hospital killing off Wong’s men; a personal vendetta shoot-out between Mad Dog (Philip Kwok) (one of Wong’s gunmen) and Alan; and Tequila and Teresa saving the babies in the maternity ward before Wong detonates his C-4 and levels the entire fuckin’ building.\n\nJohn Woo’s crime thrillers pretty much redefined the action genre in Hong Kong, and it would soon influence filmmakers here in the America. He’s kind of like George Romero in that he managed to create a whole subgenre—Gun-Fu, I call it. Trademark Woo action scenes involve characters using two handguns at the same time, and/or leaping into the air with said handguns blazing; select moments of slow motion during the action scenes; characters coming to Mexican standoffs, general close quarters gun play, with incredible Jackie Chan level stunt work (as in it appears the actors themselves are performing these insane stunts right next to the pyrotechnics). Check out 5-minutes of the hospital scene below.\n\nHard Boiled was his last Hong Kong made flick before he came to America to unleash his style on us using American stars. I consider his first three the best: Hard Target (1993), Broken Arrow (1996) and Face/Off (1997). In fact there’s a couple of action scenes in Hard Boiled he “reboots” in Hard Target and Face/Off respectively. One spectacular scene in Hard Boiled involves a shoot-out with Alan and Mad Dog. Alan is racing down a hallway shooting at Mad Dog who’s doing the same but from the adjacent office spaces, keeping pace with him with plate glass windows separating the two exploding as each one tries desperately to kill the other; Hard Target has a similar scene of two characters following each other with a barrier in between their shooting. At the end of the movie Tequila is in the process of cradling a baby he’s trying to rescue, cradling him as he’s blowing away Wong’s men, but he doesn’t want the kid to get traumatized, so he puts cotton in his ears and sings him a song as he’s killing guys. The similar scene in Face/Off involves one of the bad guys putting head phones on their kid, and turning the music up as a shoot out occurs around them and we get this “against type” music playing over the action scene, giving it a rather surreal vibe.\n\nI know of at least one flick that got the “Woo touch.” I recommend checking out the werewolf cop movie, Full Eclipse (1993)—yes, such a flick exists and it’s actually good—Mario Van Peebles plays the lead and it’s an action horror film that in the beginning has a couple of shoot-outs that has Peebles leaping into the air Woo style firing two handguns at the same time, in slow motion.\n\nDie Hard (1988) was a movie that came close to Woo’s style of insane action before it was popular, but the only flicks I’ve seen these days that manage to match and even go beyond John Woo’s Gun-Fu are the John Wick films. And, I think, we may have to thank Woo for that. I’m going to go out on a limb and say someone connected with those films had to be a Woo fan, and made either the conscious or unconscious decision to see if they could take cinema gun play to new unseen levels.\n\nI forgot to mention a couple of things: I love the music in this film (by Michael Gibbs) and that Woo has a cameo in a couple of scenes as a bartender Tequila talks to on occasion.\n\nHard Boiled (1992) has gotten many versions released on DVD and Blu-Ray here and abroad, some are out of print. If you’re looking to compare versions check out dvdcompare and DVD Beaver. This latest one comes from Hong Kong Rescue, (not a legitimate distributor); it’s one guy restoring the flicks the best he can on BD-R. If you plan to order from him you need to know waiting for your order to ship can entail months. I’ve heard some have had shorter delivery times, others longer, mine took exactly eight months. Emailing him does no good. He doesn’t reply. You just have to wait until he gets to your order.\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO/SUBTITLES: 1080p 1.85:1 high definition widescreen—2.0 Original Cantonese LPCM (Criterion Laserdisc), 5.1 Cantonese surround remix DTS-HD Master Audio (Dragon Dynasty Blu-Ray), 5.1 English Dub Dolby Digital (Dragon Dynasty Blu-Ray), 5.1 Mandarin Dolby Digital (Kam And Ronson Blu-Ray)—English subs only\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the transfer, clarity and color looked great! According to Hong Kong Rescue’s page they occasionally do their own tweaking:\n\nLittle known to most people, a couple of years ago there was an obscure Japanese release of this film that featured a true high definition transfer that far exceeded any other release anywhere in the world in terms of picture quality. It lacked English subtitles so it has remained unknown in the English-speaking world. Our release uses this exact same source, except with the addition of new color grading for an even more accurate picture. You won’t find better picture quality for this film anywhere in the world. Guaranteed.\n\nEXTRAS INCLUDED . . .\n\nDISC #1 (Theatrical Cut Runtime: 2:07:37):\n\nAudio Commentary With Director John Woo, Producer Terence Chang, Filmmaker Roger Avery & Critic David Kehr (Criterion DVD)\n\nAudio Commentary With John Woo & Terrence Chang (Fox Lorber DVD)\n\nAudio Commentary With Bey Logan (Dragon Dynasty BD)\n\nPodcast on Fire, “Criterion Podcast” Commentary (HKR Exclusive)\n\nDISC #2 (Extras w/Extended Cut Runtime: 2:11:36):\n\nTaiwan Extended Version (un-remastered w/burned-in English subs)\n\nThe Making Of Hard Boiled (2002) (1:15:4)\n\nBody Count (10:44)\n\nBreak-Down Analysis (5:50)\n\nJohn Woo Interview (38:22)\n\nChow Yun-Fat Interview (19:49)\n\nTony Leung Interview (11:01)\n\nTerence Chang Interview (24:57)\n\nPhilip Chan Interview (15:17)\n\nKwok Choi Interview (24:03)\n\nAlternative Opening Scene (11:32)\n\nTrailer Gallery ( 25:53)\n\nLocation Guide (8:28)\n\nHerd Boiled Vs.

I couldn’t see anything different. Movie-censorship.com breaks down the differences, which sound noteworthy, but, I tell you, I didn’t notice anything new.\n\nAt any rate I liked that Hong Kong Rescue sought to make the definitive version by porting over various extras from the different releases, even doing the same with the audio options. The best extra, outside of the commentaries, is the ‘Making Of.’ Participants here are director John Woo, producer Terence Chang, editor David Wu and actor/stuntman/choreographer Philip Kwok (he played Mad Dog). One of the things I always wondered about gets answered, Die Hard was an influence. According to Woo it was mostly the relationship between Chow and Teresa, but Terrence freely admits the whole hospital scene at the end is essentially Die Hard in a hospital, and he urged Woo to look at it that way. (This reminds me I simply need to review Die Hard at some point, since that was such a turning point for action movies in the late 80s). All four do a great job breaking down the creation and filming of the movie. Not to mention the stunts. One thing I was at awe by was how they did the hospital shoot out, particularly that one scene where Chow and Tony need to go up to another floor to continue the action, and the impression you’re supposed to get is they did indeed go to another floor. They didn’t. Once the elevator doors shut the crew quickly redressed the entire set to look like another floor all within the time the two actors took to deliver their dialogue to one another before they open again.\n\nI got a kick out of the ‘Body Count’ extra, it’s 10-minutes of action scenes with an onscreen counter tallying up how many people were killed in the film, 320 ended up kicking the bucket from “lead poisoning.”\n\nThe rest of the interviews are very enlightening, especially Terence Chang where he talks about the original plot that revolved around a psychopath killing babies by poisoning baby food, before they realized no one in America would watch a flick about a baby killer, so it was reworked. And that the opening shoot out in the tea house was filmed even before a script was ever written, basically because it was going to be torn down in a few days and Woo wanted the opening scene to happen there. This was when they still had plans to shoot the original storyline. Some of this is also touched on in Chang’s interview in the ‘Making Of’ doc.\n\nUntil a new blu-ray comes around, preferably a UHD (fingers crossed), I recommend getting this version, if you don’t any of the (legit) others."
