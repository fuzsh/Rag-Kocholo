        "text": "Fairly often the whites of my hardboiled eggs turn out flabby, soft and mealy. I have Googled this a few times and never found an answer. It happens regardless of the age of the egg, and regardless of the egg vendor, though my eggs are always farmer's-market, organic, local etc. My cooking method is to put the eggs in with the water, bring it up to a boil, and then turn off the heat and let sit for 10 min. Then douse with cold to stop the cooking. When the eggs don't turn out mealy, this is perfect. I've seen recipes saying to put the eggs in at the point the water boils, then let sit for 17 min but A) I find it hard to get eggs into boiling water gently and B) that sounds annoyingly long. I've also possibly noticed a correlation with leaving the eggs out on the counter after cooking and mealiness, but am not sure."
