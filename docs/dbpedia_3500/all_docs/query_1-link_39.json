A quiet half hour (or however long you can stick it out for) watching the seasons change. Read on if it sounds like your cup of tea...\n\t\n\tStill is a large-scale projection of 700 images taken in a forest by a solar-powered camera and constantly reordered through computer software. Commissioned by Stour Valley Arts in 2011, Still captures a year in the Kent woodland showing the ever-changing sequence between dusk and dawn; an ebb and flow of time through which the viewer is as likely to witness the passing of a single day as the turning of the seasons.\n\t\n\tIn Still, Finer extends a new art form, lying somewhere between photography and film – a still image in a state of constant flux. What seems static is actually an endless series of transitions, both subtle and dramatic. No two viewings of the work are ever the same as the film continually finds new and different paths through the days, weeks and months. The project reflects Finer’s interest in designing intricate programs and complex structures that encourage perception of the macro, the cosmological and the infinite. In Still, we are simultaneously drawn to consider our relationship to the natural world and its processes.",
