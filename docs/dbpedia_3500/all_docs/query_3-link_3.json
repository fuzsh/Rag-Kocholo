They're a great ready-made snack and a good way to use up eggs that might be nearing their expiration date.\n\nMy go-to method has always been to drop eggs into boiling water, reduce the heat to simmer, and let them sit for about 13 to 15 minutes, but there are so many ways to make eggs. Doing some research, I found endless lists from home cooks and celebrity chefs suggesting a myriad of methods.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTo see how eggs would turn out when cooked in different ways, I set out to test three cooking methods at four cook times.\n\nFor each combination, I made two eggs, putting one in a 10-minute ice bath before peeling. An ice bath stops the egg from continuing to cook after it's removed from the water and is also meant to make peeling easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn each photo below, the egg on the left was peeled while warm, and the egg on the right was peeled after an ice bath. It's worth noting that I used large eggs for this experiment, so the results may not look the same for you if you're using another size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the first method, I dropped the eggs in boiling water, reduced the heat, and let them simmer. After five minutes of simmering, the eggs were runny.\n\nAfter researching ways to cook an egg, I saw that placing it in a 10-minute ice bath was supposed to make the egg contract inside the shell, making it easier to peel. In this case, though, the ice bath didn't seem to make too much of a difference. Both eggs were difficult to peel, and pieces of shell clung to the whites for dear life.\n\nThe egg that was put in the ice bath was much runnier than its non-iced counterpart. That makes sense, though, since the ice water stops the cooking process.\n\nIn the case of the ice-submerged egg, the whites were runny, which isn't ideal. While they weren't cooked through, they were mostly solid in the egg that didn't receive an ice bath.\n\nI couldn't fully bite into these, as they were, well, mostly raw. But, if I let them sit out of the water and cook in their own heat just a few minutes longer, the white would have continued to cook, leaving me with what would resemble a poached egg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing the same method and letting them cook for 10 minutes gave the yolks an unpleasant texture.\n\nThe whites were perfectly cooked here, and I was able to see the huge difference that just five more minutes in the pot can make.\n\nBoth yolks kept their bright-orange color for the most part, but some bits were starting to become more of a pale yellow.\n\nWhen I bit into them, I found the texture to be slightly gummy. I thought the consistency of the whites was great — solid but not rubbery.\n\nBoth eggs were easy to peel, regardless of the ice bath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimmering for 15 minutes left me with delicious, hard-boiled eggs.\n\nBoth of these eggs were easy to peel; I didn't end up losing any of the whites.\n\nThe yolks of both eggs were dry, but the one without the ice bath felt a little creamier in its texture.\n\nI was nervous I had overcooked the eggs, but there was no gray ring around the yolk; that's typically how you can tell if you've overboiled your egg. The whites were also fully cooked and didn't feel too rubbery.\n\nWhile the yolk and white felt like one cohesive piece in the egg on the left (which didn't get an ice bath), the two components separated and fell apart easily after taking a bite of the egg on the right (which did get an ice bath).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI simmered the eggs one last time for 20 minutes, which didn't make much of a difference from 15 minutes.\n\nAgain, both eggs were easy to peel and had the same color of yolks.\n\nThe yolks were slightly more dry than the ones cooked for only 15 minutes, but the one without the ice bath stayed mushier in its consistency than the more-solid iced egg. I was able to tell the difference when I slid my knife through each of them; the one in the ice bath was easier to cut.\n\nIn terms of mouthfeel, though, the two were nearly identical.\n\nI think this cooking method and timing combination is perfect if you're looking to make egg salad or slice eggs for a sandwich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the next method, I started the eggs in a pot of cold water, brought it to a boil, covered the pot, and removed from the heat. Letting the eggs sit in the pot for five minutes after taking it off the heat cooked them rather thoroughly.\n\nIn peeling both of these eggs, I lost some of their whites.\n\nAfter sitting in the hot water for just five minutes, the yolks were a beautiful pale yellow and the whites weren't runny at all.\n\nWhile both were fully cooked, the egg that went into an ice bath came out of it with a firmer white. It also had less of an overall sulfur taste than the egg without the ice bath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter 10 minutes of sitting in the pan, the egg that didn't have an ice bath had a silky-smooth yolk while the other was firmer and more rubbery.\n\nUnexpectedly, the egg in the ice bath was a lot harder to peel, while its uniced counterpart peeled quite easily.\n\nIn terms of the yolks, the egg on the left had a really silky consistency, which was awesome. I think this method without the ice bath is great for an egg you just want to bite into as a snack.\n\nThe egg on the right, though, was firm inside and felt rubbery. It clumped together when I tried to take a bite.\n\nThe whites on both were cooked well, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd after 15 minutes of sitting in the pot, both eggs had that rubbery consistency.\n\nAfter cooking for five more minutes, the egg that came out of the ice bath was much harder to peel. I ended up peeling off a lot of the white with the pieces of shell.\n\nBoth yolks, regardless of the ice bath, were weirdly solid and gumlike. They were a bright-orange color, which looks delicious, but I wouldn't eat these whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a full 20 minutes, the yolks separated from the whites.\n\nAfter cutting them both open, I thought they looked equally rubbery. But, the egg without an ice bath actually had a yolk with a velvety texture.\n\nAfter the ice bath, the white and yolk seemed to have pulled away from each other. Even still, both whites were soft and enjoyable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast, I tried starting the eggs in boiling water, turning off the heat right after I dropped them in, and let them sit covered. Sitting for just five minutes caused an egg explosion.\n\nThis was a disaster. I was able to peel both eggs at first, but it turned out that only the outermost layers of the whites were cooked; everything else was raw.\n\nOf course, I wasn't able to taste these, but I did learn that every minute counts when it comes to cooking eggs. At least, the next batches got better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 10 minutes total, this method yielded some decadent eggs.\n\nTen minutes was the sweet spot for me with this cooking method. Both yolks were super velvety and tasted rich and decadent.\n\nThe whites were fully cooked, though I lost a good amount of them in the peeling process that stuck to the shell.\n\nThe two eggs, regardless of an ice bath, tasted the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLetting the eggs sit in the water for 15 minutes made the yolks solid and rubbery.\n\nThe egg that cooled on its own without an ice bath was nearly impossible to peel. Its white was semi-runny still, and I lost almost all of it in the peeling process. The yolk was cooked through, but it was rubbery.\n\nThe egg in the ice bath was easy to peel, and the white was cooked well. Its yolk was somewhat velvety, but it was also kind of gummy and rubbery.\n\nI wouldn't recommend using this cooking method for any reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter 20 minutes, both whites were cooked and the eggs were easy to peel.\n\nI was able to easily peel both these eggs after they had cooked for 20 minutes.\n\nWhen I got them out of their shells, I saw the whites were cooked perfectly. Both yolks looked the same, but the one that had been in an ice bath was much creamier and the one without the ice bath was solid and chunky.\n\nIf I used this method again, I would definitely use the ice bath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery minute counts when you're boiling eggs.\n\nAfter making two dozen eggs each in their own way, I found that the ice bath doesn't really make much of a difference.\n\nI learned that it's not just the length of cook time that matters when it comes to hard-boiled eggs. It's the combination of cooking methods and timing that can yield drastically different results.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the eggs I made when using the third cooking method at the 10-minute mark. I would definitely try making these again, especially if I'm making a snack on the spot. In terms of making eggs for later, though, I'll most likely stick to what I know and simmer for 13 minutes.\n\nAnd if it goes wrong, don't beat yourself up. It's hard to cook a perfect egg, especially when the success of your finished product is hiding behind a shell. Ultimately, you won't know how it turned out until you crack it open.\n\nRead next\n\nFood Recipe For Success Eggs\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
