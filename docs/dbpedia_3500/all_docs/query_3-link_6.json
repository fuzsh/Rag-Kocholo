        "text": "You’ve got this! Perfect hard boiled eggs - every single time. Here’s the method.\n\nHard boiled eggs are a frequent ingredient in many meals and recipes. They're foundational for countless cooks, and much-loved for being portable, filling, protein-rich, and adaptable. Once peeled they can be sliced, grated, smashed, or pureed. The key is landing on a cooking method that delivers perfect eggs every single time. So, let's talk it through.\n\nWhat Makes A Perfect Hard Boiled Egg?\n\nThe goal here is to cook fully set, smooth, eggs. That when cut open reveal a creamy, well-set, bright yellow yolk with no grey ring or discoloration. A lot of divots from peeling aren't ideal, but there are methods to achieving divot-free eggs, no worries!\n\nThe Method\n\nThere are a few key steps here. Let's go through them with photos.\n\nFirst, gently place your eggs in a saucepan.\n\nNext, cover the eggs with water by about an inch.\n\nAfter that, bring everything to a boil over medium-high heat (uncovered). Once the water reaches a boil, when the eggs start to tap a bit against the bottom of the saucepan, turn off the heat, cover, and set a timer for exactly 10 minutes.\n\nIn the meantime, prepare a medium bowl with water and some ice cubes. Once your timer goes off, use a strainer, spider, or slotted spoon to move the eggs into the ice water. This is one of the steps a lot of people get wrong (or skip). You really want to cool they eggs down entirely. Peeling warm eggs is much more difficult than peeling cold one, and patience is king here. The quick cool-down also helps keep the eggs bright, yellow, and ring-free.\n\nHow To Best Peel a Hard Boiled Egg\n\nThis is something people really struggle with. Peeling an egg is actually trickier than you think, especially if you don't want to lose a good amount of the egg along with the peel. We've all been there. Keep in mind that fresh eggs are always trickier to peel than eggs that are a bit older, but this is a method that helps remove the egg shell in strips and avoiding divots in the eggs. Here’s the technique:\n\nCrack the shell all over. One end of the egg (bottom) will vibe more hollow than the other, tap this end on your countertop. Then gently tap, tap, tap all around the egg to crack and loosen the entire shell. Some people will tell you to gently roll the egg on your countertop, and I'm not a fan of that technique. I've had eggs split around the circumference while carefully rolling, so tap, tap, tap it is.\n\nStart peeling. The hollow end (bottom) is where you want to start. Depending on the egg, you might be able to softly work your thumb under the membrane, pushing the shell away from the egg. If you're lucky it will peel in long strips. If not, keep trying to get under that membrane and peel from there.\n\nRinse. Give each egg a quick rinse and pat dry. This gets rid of any crunchy peel residual that might still be clinging to the egg.\n\nHow Long Can You Store Hard Boiled Eggs\n\nSome say hard boiled eggs will last up to a week, but I try to use them within 4 days or so.\n\nWhy I prefer This Method For Hard Boiling Eggs\n\nThere are a number of other approaches to hard boiling eggs out there, but I always come back to this one. Common sense would have you boil the water first, drop the eggs in and continue to boil for a set amount of time. This minimizes the variables, because you're dealing with constants - the temperature of boiling water and a set time period. But this method has you add a towel to your pan to keep the eggs from breaking as they boil, and tbh, I don't love the cleanup from that.\n\nThe method I use here is gentle with the eggs from the start, and it's reliably good. The only wild card I've run into is using an induction stove burner. It boils the water SO FAST, the eggs end up needing a slightly longer time under cover. If you're using induction, bring them to a boil a bit more slowly, a 6 setting works well.\n\nWooohoo!

Here are a few other ideas.\n\nMake deviled eggs\n\nMake a Niçoise salad\n\nMake an assortment of homemade spice blends to use on them.\n\nMake shredded egg salad\n\nMake a classic egg salad sandwich\n\nAdd them to a bento with other feel-good lunch ideas\n\nMore Egg Recipes\n\nPickled Turmeric Eggs\n\nScrambled Eggs with Cream Cheese\n\nSheet Pan Frittata\n\nSkinny Omelette\n\n101 Cookbooks Membership\n\nPremium Ad-Free membership includes:\n\n-Ad-free content\n\n-Print-friendly recipes\n\n-Spice / Herb / Flower / Zest recipe collection PDF\n\n-Weeknight Express recipe collection PDF\n\n-Surprise bonuses throughout the year\n\nbrowse more:\n\nHard Boiled Eggs\n\n4.50 from 2 votes\n\nThere are some extra pro-tips in the post up above.\n\nIngredients\n\n4 eggs\n\nInstructions\n\nPlace the eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by an inch. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. If you’re using induction, setting number 6 is good. Any higher and the water boils too quickly.\n\nOnce the water boils and the eggs are just starting to jump around a bit in the pot, turn off the heat. Cover the pan, and let sit for ten minutes.\n\nIn the meantime, fill a bowl with water and ice cubes. When the eggs are done cooking, place them in the ice bath long enough to cool completely - ideally 7-10 minutes.\n\nCrack and peel each egg. Give a quick rinse to remove any residual shell bits.\n\nNotes\n\nMakes four eggs.\n\nServes\n\n4\n\nPrep Time\n\n5 mins\n\nCook Time\n\n10 mins\n\nTotal Time\n\n15 mins\n\nRelated Recipes\n\nDeviled Eggs\n\nA beautiful and delicious deviled eggs made with an herb-flecked filling and topped with toasted almonds.\n\nNiçoise Salad\n\nEveryone can find ingredients to love In this vegetarian take on Niçoise Salad!

It means that most days, at one point or another, I find myself standing in the middle of San Francisco's Chinatown. This is a shredded salad inspired by the neighborhood - lots of cabbage and scallions, tossed with soy sauce, honey, and cilantro, and amount of crunch toasted peanuts, and celery."
