        "text": "Welcome back! I am cooking my way through the 1929 Photoplay cookbook (recipes of the stars!) and you are invited to tag along. (I have listed all the recipes that I have tested on this dedicated page. Check back often.) This time, we are trying a recipe from a pioneering screenwriter.\n\nAgnes Christine Johnston may not have the name recognition of Frances Marion or Anita Loos but her thirty-five year career as a screenwriter is a testament to her talent and popularity. Her career started with penning shorts for Mutual and Vitagraph and continued through the silent feature era, the talkie revolution and television.\n\nJohnston’s career took off when she was still a teenager and she was only twenty-three when she adapted the novel Daddy Long Legs for Mary Pickford. (She was given the curious title of “special scenario editress” for Pickford at this time.) However, Johnston’s finest contribution to silent film fans is probably her work for Marion Davies at MGM. Among other titles, Johnston penned The Patsy and Show People, two of Davies’ most popular films.\n\nJohnston’s talent for humor and family-friendly entertainment meshed well with the philosophy of MGM in the post-Code world and she penned a number of entries in the Andy Hardy series.\n\nIn addition to writing, Johnston was an advocate for women in Hollywood. She was on record as stating that more women needed to direct pictures. It must have been frustrating to see the pioneering women of the silent days pushed aside as the movie industry became more and more of a boy’s club.\n\nJohnston felt that a balance between family and work was the key to happiness, which was a pretty revolutionary concept in the early twentieth century. While contemporary reports were incredulous that she could “have it all” Johnston viewed her family and her work as complements to one another. She felt that her writing career made her a better mother and kept her from burning out.\n\nSo, Agnes Christine Johnston was a remarkable talent and a fascinating person but what about her Scenario Salad? Will it be legendary or a bomb?\n\nThis recipe is significant as it is the only one in the book that claims to help its creator get his or her job done. Johnston is quite specific on the the efficacy of this salad in her recipe description. It’s light and nutritious and will make an excellent luncheon for a mental worker. Okay, let’s try this sucker out!\n\nI started with a hard-boiled egg. Eggs with green shells are tastier. It’s a scientific fact. (My friend keeps chickens. There are advantages.)\n\nNext, I gutted a green pepper, removing the core, seeds and any extra pith from the inside.\n\nI was surprised by how well the egg balanced inside the pepper. I was expecting to have to use toothpicks.\n\nThis is the point where I started getting nervous. Aspics and savory gelatins are not exactly the big culinary thing these days.\n\nI filled the pepper to the brim with the gelatin.\n\nAnd into the fridge it went! I took it out after three hours and it was firmly set. Now for the moment of truth. Would the salad slice?\n\nA problem became clear early on. You can only get two, maybe three attractive slices out of each pepper. The ends are quite homely and the whole thing starts to separate the more you slice.\n\nIt looks pretty on the plate…\n\nBut how does it taste?\n\nMy taste test video:\n\nFinal Score: 1 out of 5. This was so gross! The slimy tomato gelatin is to blame. I don’t even like gelatin to begin with so it was doubly nasty. Basically, I was okay until I tried to swallow and then my body simply refused to ingest. Can you blame it?\n\nI think Johnston used this as a working meal because it gave her impetus to finish her scripts so that she could eat some real food."
