        "text": "Tips\n\nFor easiest peeling, use eggs that have been in the refrigerator the longest. The less fresh the egg, the easier it is to peel.\n\nTo peel a hard boiled egg, crackle the shell all over by tapping the egg on a hard surface, then roll the egg between your hands to loosen the shell. Begin peeling at the large end. Hold the egg under cold running water or dip it in a bowl of water to help remove the shell.\n\nHard boiled eggs with the shell on and kept in a sealed container will keep for 1 week in the fridge.\n\nTo determine whether an egg is hard boiled or raw, spin it! If it spins round and round evenly, it is hard boiled. If it wobbles while spinning, it is a raw egg.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow much time is needed to make hard boiled eggs?\n\nHard boiled eggs should be cooked for about 10-12 minutes. This timing avoids a powdery, dry yolk that comes from overcooking while keeping it solid enough for applications like devilled eggs or egg salad.\n\nWhat is the best method for peeling hard boiled eggs?\n\nTo peel hard boiled eggs, start by tapping the eggs gently on a hard surface to crack the shell. Roll the egg gently on the surface to loosen the shell. Then, peel the egg starting at the larger end, where the air pocket is located. For more in-depth instructions, check out our guide on how to peel a hard boiled egg.\n\nHow long do hard boiled eggs last in the refrigerator?\n\nHard boiled eggs stored in the refrigerator can last for up to 1 week, as long as they are stored in an airtight container. For best results use them within a day or two. For more information on how to safely store eggs, check out our guide to egg storage and food safety.\n\nWhat are some ways to use hard boiled eggs?\n\nHard boiled eggs can be used as an addition to almost any salad, to add protein to a potato salad, or as a topping for sandwiches or burgers. They can also be sliced and used as a garnish for soups, stews, or curries. Doro Wat, a chicken stew that is commonly known as Ethiopia's national dish, is a perfect example of how hard boiled eggs can be added to a dish. Enjoy them with a little salt and pepper for a quick and nourishing snack. Hard boiled eggs are one of the most versatile ingredients to have on hand and an easy way to make a simple dish special.\n\nCheck out our uses for hard boiled eggs in our Recipe Category: Hard Boiled Eggs.\n\nCan hard boiled eggs be frozen for later use?\n\nHard boiled eggs are not recommended for freezing because the texture of the egg white can become rubbery and unappetizing.\n\nWhat is the difference between a soft boiled egg and a hard boiled egg?\n\nA soft boiled egg is boiled for a shorter amount of time, typically 4-6 minutes, so that the yolk remains runny while the white is only partially set. A hard boiled egg is boiled for a longer amount of time, typically 10-12 minutes, so that both the yolk and white are fully cooked and solid.\n\nExplore our comprehensive guide to soft-boiled eggs for more information visit out how-to on soft boiling eggs.\n\nHow can I avoid the green ring around the yolk of a hard-boiled egg?\n\nThe green ring around the yolk of a hard boiled egg is caused by a reaction between the iron in the yolk and the sulfur in the egg white. It’s not harmful to eat, just maybe not as appetizing as a nice yellow yolk. To prevent this from happening, make sure to avoid cooking the eggs at a full rolling boil, and reduce your cooking time. We also recommend cooling the eggs quickly in ice water after cooking to avoid carryover cooking.\n\nAre older eggs better for hard-boiling?\n\nIt’s widely said that older eggs are easier to peel after being hard boiled, but using less-than-fresh eggs comes with other problems. You can use older eggs for hard-boiling, but they may end up misshapen due to the air pocket inside the egg increasing with age. Not a problem for egg salad, but not great for devilled eggs. Older eggs are also more likely to form a green ring, even within recommended cooking times, because the egg white becomes more alkaline over time, which makes the chemical reaction happen faster. If looks matter, fresher eggs are better, but they all taste great.\n\nWhat is the ideal texture of the yolk in a hard-boiled egg?\n\nThe ideal texture of the yolk in a hard-boiled egg is firm, but not dry or crumbly. The yolk should not be fully set but should not be runny either.\n\nCan I use my Instant Pot to make hard-boiled eggs?\n\nYes, you can use an Instant Pot or any pressure cooker to make hard-boiled eggs, even quicker than in a pot, which is perfect if you need to make them for a crowd. Simply place the eggs in a steaming basket or on a trivet in the Instant Pot, add 1 cup of water, and cook on high pressure for 5-6 minutes. Quick release the pressure and transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool."
