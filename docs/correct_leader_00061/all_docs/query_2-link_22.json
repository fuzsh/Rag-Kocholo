        "text": "Charles-Alexandre Dupuy (born November 5, 1851, Le Puy (now Le Puy-en-Velay), France—died July 23, 1923, Ille-sur-Têt) was a French political figure whose governments during the period of the Dreyfus Affair failed to cope successfully with critical issues arising from the political and social tensions that emerged during the long controversy.\n\nA philosophy professor before his election to the Chamber of Deputies (1885) from the Haute-Loire département, Dupuy joined Jules Ferry’s moderate republicans. He served as minister of education from December 1892 to April 1893; he then formed his own government in April 1893 but resigned at the end of November and on December 5 was elected president of the Chamber. During his first week of office the anarchist Auguste Vaillant threw a bomb at him, and Dupuy’s calm words, “The debate continues, gentlemen,” won him much credit. He became premier and minister of the interior in May 1894 and was by Pres. Sadi Carnot’s side when the latter was assassinated at Lyon in June."
