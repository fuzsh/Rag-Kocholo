        "text": "10 February 1859\n\nÉtienne Alexandre Millerand was born in Paris.\n\n1881\n\nAfter earning a degree in Law, he joined the Paris Bar and became an important business attorney. He also worked as a journalist, collaborating on Clemenceau’s newspaper, Justice, and as a politician.\n\n27 December 1885-1919\n\nHe was elected the Radical Deputy for the Seine Department.\n\n22 June 1899-6 June 1902\n\nHe became Minister of Trade, Industry and the Post and Telegraphs in Waldeck-Rousseau’s Government. He had social-oriented laws passed (work duration, weekly breaks, retirement).\n\n1904\n\nHe was excluded from the Socialist Party for being in a “bourgeois” Government and started his move towards the Right.\n\n24 July 1909-2 November 1910\n\nHe served as Minister of Public Works, the Post and Telegraphs.\n\n14 January 1912-12 January 1913\n\nHe served as Minister of War.\n\n17 February 1913\n\nRaymond Poincaré was elected President of the Republic.\n\n26 August 1914-29 October 1915\n\nAs Minister of War, he had to deal with the beginnings of the First World War.\n\nDecember 1918\n\nHe was elected member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences because of his many political publications, which were focused on labour conditions.\n\n1919\n\nHe served as Commissioner-General of the Republic in Strasbourg in charge of re-organizing the three former Departments of Alsace-Lorraine.\n\n20 January-23 September 1920\n\nHe served as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\n23 September 1920\n\nHe was elected President of the Republic when Paul Deschanel was incapacitated.\n\nHe did not settle for being President in name only and wanted to be given real powers, including the power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies. He was against the détente with Germany advocated by Aristide Briand, the Prime Minister at that time, which was why Briand resigned on 12 January 1922.\n\nMay 1922\n\nHe visited Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.\n\n14 October 1923\n\nHe gave his famous speech in Evreux where he declared his intention to reduce the role of Parliament. With a view to 1924 elections, he took a position in favour of the Bloc National (political grouping of moderates and conservatives established after the First World War).\n\n11 June 1924\n\nHe was forced to resign after the victory of the Cartel des Gauches in the general election. Gaston Doumergue was elected President of the Republic.\n\n5 April 1925\n\nHe was elected Senator for the Department of Seine.\n\n30 October 1927\n\nHe was elected Senator for the Department of Orne, then re-elected on 14 January 1936."
