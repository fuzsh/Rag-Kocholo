        "text": "The decade that followed the First World War witnessed an unprecedented expansion of the works of humanitarian and international organisations.Footnote 1 Rich scholarship documents the role of these organisations, including, but not limited to, Save the Children, the International Labour Organization, the League of Nations, the European Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The perspective of how national societies interacted with international organisations has, however, been less prevalent in the literature, given the legitimate focus on internationalism and transnationalism. This article considers how the Central Committee of the French Red Cross navigated a postwar environment increasingly dominated by transnational humanitarian organisations. It looks at how the French Red Cross strived for its independence while learning how to engage with international and humanitarian organisations and, in particular, the newly-born League of Red Cross Societies (LRCS). Crucially, it explores a contrast between the national-patriotic character of the French Red Cross and the transnational humanitarian agenda of the broader Red Cross movement, especially as that contrast arose around the question of the democratic character and representative protocols of humanitarian organisations.\n\nIn doing so, this article argues that in the 1920s, under the presidency of General Paul Pau, the French Red Cross, a traditional auxiliary of the French army, became an arm of the French Foreign Office, a semi-official and semi non-official channel through which to advance French diplomacy. The national-patriotic make-up of the French Red Cross was not a new post-First World War phenomenon and had already been observed during the Franco-Prussian war. Furthermore, the growing authority of the state in its affairs had increased since the Paris Commune of 1871.Footnote 2 The aftermath of the First World War was, therefore, a culminating process for the French Red Cross's patriotism and proximity to the state and its foreign policy, rather than a starting point. This is documented through an analysis of the French Red Cross's ambivalent relationship with the LRCS that nourished what Irène Herrmann has referred to as a concurrence humanitaire between the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the nascent LRCS in order to advance French interests.Footnote 3 Analysing this ambivalence reveals that the French Red Cross's trajectory in the uncertain waters of the postwar humanitarian world was one of autonomy vis-à-vis the LRCS, the ICRC and transnational humanitarianism more broadly. This trajectory was a learning process for the French Red Cross. Through shifting partnering and collaborating with the LRCS and the ICRC, the French Red Cross tried to discover which body was better constituted to support French national interests in the postwar world. This points to a key issue for transnational humanitarian organisations and how they could attempt to practise forms of democratic representation while aggregating and mediating between sovereign interests of national organisations. To begin with, the article paints the postwar landscape within which the French Red Cross operated and considers its contribution to the creation of the LRCS. It then establishes how animosity toward Germany guided its stands on various matters that pertained to the organisation of the Red Cross movement at an international level. The article then investigates why the LRCS relocated its headquarters from Geneva to Paris and how the French Red Cross sought to align its international activities to French foreign policies. Finally, this article examines the French Red Cross's position on the proposed fusion of the LRCS and the ICRC through the 1920s.\n\nWhile this article uses the terminology ‘French Red Cross’, it must be acknowledged that this space was a heterogeneous grouping of associations. Although the term Croix-Rouge française was used to speak about the Red Cross movement in France before the First World War, the French Red Cross as an institution was not formalised until 7 August 1940.Footnote 4 Prior to that date, three associations – la Société de secours aux blessés militaires (SSBM), l'Union des femmes des France, and l'Association des dames françaises – made up the French Red Cross movement and were represented in a body called the Comité central de la Croix-Rouge française. The SSBM, as an auxiliary to the French army, held moral ascendency over the other two associations, with high-profile members within its ranks (army generals, aristocrats, diplomats). While women had a central role in both l'Union des femmes des France and l'Association des dames françaises, the central committee of the SSBM was male-dominated; it formed the core component of the Comité central de la Croix-Rouge française, presided over by General Paul Pau, also the president of the SSBM from 26 February 1918.Footnote 5 The Central Committee – referred to as the French Red Cross (FRC) in this article – was the body in charge of representing and leading the many branches and associations that were part of the French Red Cross movement. In this role, the FRC also dealt with matters relevant to the international organisation of the Red Cross movement. As a caveat, and based on files consulted in French departmental archives documenting the activities of local branches of the FRC's three associations, it must be noted that such branches were mostly concerned with local programmes of work (tuberculosis, milk for the newborn, the poor, reconstruction works, etc.) and often did not think of their mandate as one of global humanitarianism.Footnote 6 As the saying goes: charité bien ordonnée commence par soi-même (charity begins at home), and there was much to do in post-First World War France. In turn, this local and national focus meant that while the Central Committee was the voice of the French Red Cross on international Red Cross matters, its clout over such matters and its ability to see them being transposed at local level was limited. In addition, the Central Committee – itself mostly an emanation of the SSBM – also primarily conceived its role as a national auxiliary to the French army and to the French state."
