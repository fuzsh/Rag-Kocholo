        "text": "The purpose of this paper is to reintroduce certain dimensions of policy analysis into the study of institutional change, and to demonstrate how this helps us to better understand the process of state transformation. We look here at the role of political-administrative elites in decision-making for social welfare policy France since the beginning of the 1980s, employing a method that combines the sociology of actors (looking at social background and professional trajectories) and the analysis of ideas (the cognitive and normative representations held by actors). We begin by observing that, as far as social welfare policy is concerned, the electoral program of the victorious French leftwing coalition in 1981 proved impossible to implement. Of neo-Keynsian inspiration, and symbolized by the pronouncement of Miister for Social Affairs Nicole Questiaux that she did not propose to act as \" minister of accounts, \" the so-called \" common program of the left \" was based on massive spending increases seen as an intrinsic good. The budget crisis that ensued, and the move to a politics of austerity in 1983, ensured that this policy never had a chance to be applied. If this were the whole story, we could invoke a change of systemic framework, from a Keynesian to a neo-liberal model of economic and budget policy as a seeping overall explanation. Indeed, the idea that an external constraints such as the internationalization of the economy, the advent of EU controls on national budgets, and the development of neo-liberal ideology might seem to provide a sufficient explanation for policy, if it is considered a-historically. A closer look, however, and a restoration of historical process, tells a more complex story. By means of a close analysis of the actions of senior civil servants who actually directed French social welfare policy in the 20 years following 1980, we show the endogenous impact of this group and its ideas on the evolution of policy. Far from abandoning state intervention, as the neo-liberal model might suggest, this group of actors strengthened it. This result is paradoxical, since we observe that the general faith in state intervention inherited from the earlier period of postwar growth was increasingly contested throughout this period. (Suleiman, 1995; Muller, 2005; Jobert, 2005) In the social welfare sector, nevertheless, what we see is a re-legitimization of state action through the close control of social accounts by the state. Having observed this, it becomes important to seek the elements that allowed this policy change to evolve from the creation of\n\nThe present chapter aims at bringing about a change of perspective regarding French NPM-inspired reforms by paying attention to ‘small’ evolutions and subtle changes. By investigating more extensively the reform process of a merger in French high civil service, this chapter will explore change which occurs out of the blue, in the discretion of administrative offices and the privacy which characterizes negotiations between mandarins. By shedding light on the part played by top bureaucrats in public administration reforms and by paying attention to the setting up of such a reform, this chapter will question the widespread and oversimplified idea of French administrative inertia and resistance to change. But rather than focusing on an extensive empirical description per se, I aim at highlighting the links between specific configurations and wider institutional features. Even though this case study is undoubtedly micro-focused and pertains to an empirical description, it allows analyzing the effects of globalizing forces and external pressures on specific configurations and the ways and means in which they interact with administrative legacies. This chapter will proceed in four steps: first, clarifying the jigsaw puzzle of the public management reform concerned given the peculiar historical structure of French senior civil service; second, analyzing its managerial phrasing before; third, going behind the scenes of the reform in order to weigh up the ins and outs at stake in the mounting of the merger’s narratives. Fourth, attention will be paid to the results of the reform and its effects on the reproduction of senior civil servants’ power.\n\nThis article combines the methods of institutionalist analysis and the soci- ology of elites to look inside the black box of the French state. We identify key groups of policymakers in the social policy sector and track both their policy preferences and the results of their efforts from the mid-1980s through the late 1990s. Our conclusion is that budgetary and ideological challenges to existing policies led to the consolidation within the Ministry of Social Affairs of what we label a “programmatic elite,” whose influence derived less from the positions held by its members than from the coherence and applicability of its state-centered policy model. The competition for legitimate authority between such programmatic elites, we conclude, is an important but often overlooked endogenous source of policy change in situations of institutional stability"
