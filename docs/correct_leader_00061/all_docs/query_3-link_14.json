        "text": "About:\n\nMarjorie M. Farrar and Lancelot L. Farrar\n\nMarjorie Milbank Farrar (1935 - 2000), esteemed historian of modern France, was the author of the definitive biography of France’s first Socialist Prime Minister, Alexandre Millerand, and an authoritative study of the strategy, politics, and diplomacy of the French blockade, 1914–1918. A native of New York City, Professor Farrar was educated in high schools in New York and Virginia, graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1957, received her Masters from Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1958, and her PhD from Stanford University in 1968. A student of French history, politics, and diplomacy, Professor Farrar received a Fulbright grant to complete her dissertation research in Paris, which resulted in the 1974 publication of her first book, Conflict and Compromise: The Strategy, Politics and Diplomacy of the French Blockade, 1914-1918. She taught French history at the University of Washington, Reed College and finished her teaching career at Boston College. Thereafter, as an independent scholar, she completed her second book, Principled Pragmatist: The Political Career of Alexandre Millerand, for which she was later granted a significant honor by the French government.\n\nLancelot Leighton Farrar (1932 - 2010) was a New York native, graduating from high school on Long Island, receiving his BA from Princeton in 1954, a Masters from the University of Göttingen in Germany, and his PhD on German foreign policy from Oxford. After Oxford, Professor Farrar taught at Stanford, where he was the assistant director of the Western civilization program, and at the University of Washington. Although for much of his career, Lance Farrar did not have a permanent position, he was an enthusiastic and gifted teacher at Stanford, Washington, and later at Trinity, Brown and Wellesley Colleges, Boston and Northeastern Universities, where he held visiting appointments. Farrar’s scholarship focused on the origins and significance of the Great War. His first book, Divide and Conquer: German Efforts to Conclude a Separate Peace, asserted the importance of foreign policy and the international system. His second book, Arrogance and Anxiety: The Ambivalence of German Power, 1848–1914, examined the decisions of German statesmen, arguing that it is the international system which shapes men’s choices and limits their possibilities. In addition to these two academic books, Farrar wrote a memoir of his family’s many experiences living in Paris, An Apartment in Paris, a text that spotlights the quirks and charms of Paris in his wry, witty and thoughtful voice.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Professors Farrar moved to Boston where they both taught, researched, and wrote. Eventually they both became independent scholars, living without the support of a university but still deeply engaged in research and writing and active in organizations like the Society for French Historical Studies. Marjorie Farrar died in 2000, and Lance Farrar in 2010. They are survived by their two daughters and two granddaughters, all of whom have continued Marjorie and Lance Farrar’s heritage by seeking higher degrees, and devoting their lives to research and academia. In their honor, this scholarship fund has been established to support the work of future generations of scholars.\n\nElizabeth Shepard Farrar and Olivia M. Farrar, Their Daughters\n\nThe Farrar Memorial Awards\n\nLire en français\n\nNext Award Deadline: 1 January 2025\n\nThe Society for French Historical Studies offers The Marjorie M. and Lancelot L. Farrar Awards to support one or two outstanding in-progress dissertation projects on any period of French history by students enrolled in a doctoral program at a university in the United States or Canada. Up to two annual awards of $5,000 each have been made possible thanks to the generous donations of the Farrars' family, friends, and colleagues. When two awards are made, the committee will give strong preference to studies that relate the history of France to another European country or part of the worldWinners will be announced at the annual meeting of the Society for French Historical Studies. The awards may not be shared. Please direct inquiries to the chair of the committee.\n\nTo apply: please submit the following as email attachments (word or PDF) to the chair of the committee:\n\n1. Project Proposal: In no more than two pages (single-spaced), the applicant should outline the nature and scope of the project and the archives and libraries to be consulted;\n\n2. Current Curriculum Vitae;\n\n3. A completed cover sheet, available here.\n\n4. One confidential letter of recommendation of no more than 400 words. Recommenders are kindly asked not simply to summarize your project, but to describe for the committee aspects of the applicant’s background, achievements, and research that might not be otherwise evident from the proposal and c.v. Reference letters may be sent to the chair of the committee electronically; make sure that the scanned copy is signed.\n\n2024 WINNERS\n\nWinner: Olivia Cocking, \"Droits assurés, droits bafoués: Race, Nationality, and the Right to Living Well in France After Empire.\"\n\nWinner: Richard Todd Yoder, “Unorthodox Flesh: Gender, Religious Convulsions, and Charismatic Knowledge in Early Modern France”\n\nThe Awards committee congratulates Richard on his award. Richard’s work attends to queer “horizons of the possible” in the practice of the convulsionnaires, religious ecstatics who, as Richard stated in his proposal, “used their bodies to disrupt gender binaries and open up new ways of knowing, modes of speech, healing practices, configurations of gendered authority, and moral imperatives— in short, new “horizons” of the possible (Munoz).” Richard will examine archival testimonies from medical professionals, religious, and town authorities, to tell a story of disenchantment with catholicism from the marginalised, to narrating the entanglement of Enlightenment medicine with aberrant performances of gender and ability, and to understanding pre-Revolutionary French Catholicism from its peripheries. Some of us were able to hear him speak at this annual meeting, and we look forward to hearing more about his research in SFHS meetings to come.\n\nPast Winners:\n\n2023:\n\nMarie Robin, Columbia University, “Managing Sex Overseas in the French Army: Bordel militaire de campagne, Sexual Violence and Decolonization in Algeria and Vietnam (c. 1940-1960s)”\n\nAlex Zivkovic, Columbia University, “Ambient Empire: Ecologies, Colonies, and Nature Vivante in Modern Paris, 1860-1940”\n\n2022:\n\nEthan Mefford, University of California, Los Angeles, “Olives, Environment, and Resistance in Moroccan Jbala”\n\nLouise Moulin, Yale University, “Why Print Drama in Early Modern France?”\n\n2021:\n\nJohn Joseph Dieck, University of Minnesota, “The Contentious Commodity: The Cannabis Trade in Colonial and Post-Colonial Morocco, 1912-1962”\n\nGlauco Schettini, Fordham University, “The Catholic Counter-Revolution: A Global History, 1780s-1840s”\n\n2020:\n\nNathan Grau, Harvard University, “France’s Forgotten Soldiers: Local Paramilitaries on the Frontlines of Decolonization, 1945-1962.”\n\nHaley E.
