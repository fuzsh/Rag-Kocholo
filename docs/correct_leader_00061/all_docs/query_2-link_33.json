Etienne Alexandre Millerand, a prominent French politician who served as Minister of War from 1912 to 1915, is seen alongside General Philippe Petain on the front lines in 1915. The image showcases their strong camaraderie and shared determination amidst the chaos of war. Both men are dressed in military attire, donning hats that symbolize their roles as leaders in the armed forces. Their expressions convey a sense of seriousness and resolve as they navigate through the challenges presented by this devastating conflict. Etienne Alexandre Millerand's tenure as Minister of War coincided with some of the most crucial years of the war, making this photograph all the more significant. General Philippe Petain would later go on to become one of France's most renowned military figures. The photographer behind this remarkable image remains unknown, but it has found its place within a private collection where it continues to serve as a poignant reminder of those who fought bravely during World War I. Stefano Bianchetti's expert preservation and presentation have allowed us to glimpse into this historical moment with clarity and depth. Through his lens, we can appreciate not only the political significance but also the human aspect captured within this powerful portrait.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
