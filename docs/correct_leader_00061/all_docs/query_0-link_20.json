        "meta_description": "Born in Paris, Millerand was educated for the Bar, and made his reputation by his defence, in company with Georges Laguerre, of Ernest Roche  and Duc-Quercy, the instigators of the strike  at Decazeville in 1883; he then took Laguerre's place on Georges Clemenceau's paper, La Justice. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Seine département in 1885 as a Radical Socialist.

His programme included the collective ownership of the means of production and the international association of labour,",
