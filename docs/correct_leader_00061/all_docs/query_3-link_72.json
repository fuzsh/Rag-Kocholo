        "text": "Senior Global Futures Scientist,\n\nGlobal Futures Scientists and Scholars\n\nOther ASU affiliations\n\nAssociate Center Director and Professor, School for the Future of Innovation in Society\n\nAffiliated Faculty, Center for Biodiversity Outcomes\n\nAffiliated Faculty, Humanities for the Environment Global Network, North American Observatory\n\nAssociate Center Director and Professor, Affiliate Faculty, Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict\n\nLong Bio\n\n​Clark A. Miller is a theorist and designer of techno-human futures. His work aims to improve people's ability to design and operate technological systems and navigate technological change in ways that cultivate human thriving and justice, not least by understanding how techno-humans imagine, know, and construct their technological instruments and environments and, in the process, their techno-human selves and the technological Earth.\n\nClark's most recent books are all related to his current research enterprise focused on the social drivers, dynamics, and consequences of energy system change and the imagination and construction of human-centered global energy futures. You can download all of them for free:\n\n\"Cities of Light: A Collection of Solar Futures\" - a collaborative exploration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the very different kinds of future cities and communities that we might build with solar energy.\n\n\"Accelerating Decarbonization of the US Energy System\" - a report from the National Academies on what it will take, technologically, societally, and in terms of policy, for the United States to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n\"The Weight of Light: A Collection of Solar Futures\" - a book of science fiction, art, and reflection on why we should think very hard about the techno-human design of solar futures ... and offering up some amazingly cool stories of what different possible solar futures might look like.\n\nHe is also the co-author of \"The Practices of Global Ethics\" (with Frederick Bird, Sumner Twiss, Kusumita Pedersen, and Bruce Grelle). He is the editor of \"Changing the Atmosphere: Expert Knowledge and Environmental Governance\" (with Paul Edwards); \"Arizona's Energy Future\" (with Sharlissa Moore); \"Nanotechnology, the Brain, and the Future\" (with Sean Hays, Jason Robert, and Ira Bennett); \"Science and Democracy: Making Knowledge and Making Power in the Biosciences and Beyond\" (with Stephen Hilgartner and Rob Hagendijk); and \"The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies\" (with Ulrike Felt, Rayvon Fouche, and Laurel Smith-Doerr).\n\nEducation\n\nClark A. Miller received his BS in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois ('90) and his PhD in electrical engineering from Cornell University ('95). From 1995-1999, he held postdoctoral positions in the Department of Science & Technology Studies at Cornell University and the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. He has previously held faculty positions at Iowa State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he taught for six years in the Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs, the Robert and Jean Holtz Center for Science and Technology Studies, and the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies.\n\nVideo\n\nAudio\n\nResearch Interests\n\nClark A. Miller is a global leader in the field of carbon-neutral energy transitions.\n\nHe is a co-author of the National Academies' study \"Accelerating Decarbonization of the US Energy System\" (2021), which documents how the US can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, as well core policies and principles for ensuring that the US energy transition is just and equitable.\n\nHe has recently published two books on the design of future solar-powered societies, \"Cities of Light: A Collection of Solar Futures\" (2021) and \"The Weight of Light: A Collection of Solar Futures\" (2019), both co-edited with Joey Eschrich and free to download from ASU's Center for Science and the Imagination.\n\nHe is also the co-author of, with Tischa Muñoz-Erickson, \"Designing Knowledge,\" a guide for organizations to better construct and deploy knowledge to advance their goals and operations.\n\nClark A. Miller's research interests focus on processes of scientific and technological change in the U.S. and around the globe. He writes about the design and critical analysis of knowledge systems in support of US and global policymaking, about the governance challenges posed by new and emerging technologies, and about the social sustainability of transitions in complex, large-scale, socio-technological systems. He has published numerous articles on science and technology policy, studies of science and democracy, international relations, and energy policy. He currently leads a major research effort focused on the social drivers, dynamics, and consequences of energy system change. He is the co-author of \"The Practices of Global Ethics\" (with Frederick Bird, Sumner Twiss, Kusumita Pedersen, and Bruce Grelle). He is the editor of \"Changing the Atmosphere: Expert Knowledge and Environmental Governance\" (with Paul Edwards); \"Arizona's Energy Future\" (with Sharlissa Moore); \"Nanotechnology, the Brain, and the Future\" (with Sean Hays, Jason Robert, and Ira Bennett); \"Science and Democracy: Making Knowledge and Making Power in the Biosciences and Beyond\" (with Stephen Hilgartner and Rob Hagendijk); and \"The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies\" (with Ulrike Felt, Rayvon Fouche, and Laurel Smith-Doerr). He leads research initiatives in the Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies Engineering Research Center, the Person-Centered Technologies and Practices for Individuals with Disabilities IGERT, the US-Pakistan Centers for Advanced Studies in Energy, and the Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network.\n\nPublications\n\nSaurabh Biswas and Clark Miller, “Deconstructing knowledge and reconstructing understanding: Designing a knowledge architecture for transdisciplinary co-creation of energy futures,” Sustainable Development, 2021, in press.\n\nClark A.
