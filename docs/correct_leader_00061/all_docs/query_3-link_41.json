He moved to the University of Washington in 1984 as Professor and, for 15 years, Director of the Department of Energy’s Institute for Nuclear Theory. In 2009 he joined UC Berkeley as Professor of Physics and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as Senior Faculty Scientist. His research interests include neutrino physics, nuclear astrophysics, tests of fundamental symmetries, and many-body theory. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Washington State Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Physical Society. He received the Hans Bethe Prize from the APS in 2004. He has held visiting Fellowships from the Guggenheim, Miller, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundations and the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Research: Neutrino and nuclear astrophysics, fundamental interactions\n\nResearch Interests\n\nThe Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries (N3AS) is a multi-institutional collaboration dedicated to recruiting and training postdoctoral researchers interested in neutrino physics and astrophysics, nuclear astrophysics topics ranging from supernova and neutron star modeling to dark matter, and fundamental symmetries. The collaboration is funded by the National Science Foundation and the Heising-Simons Foundation.\n\nN3AS hosts a paid undergraduate mentorship & research program. Visit our website for details."
