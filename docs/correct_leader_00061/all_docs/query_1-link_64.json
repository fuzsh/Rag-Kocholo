        "text": "1990-2015\n\nThe following entries constitute an online addendum to the 2009 published piece in Prologue, which spotlights examples of \"acknowledgments\" to archivists working at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), as found in various works of nonfiction. Although all of these acknowledgments (and many more) deserved inclusion in the piece, not all could be due to space limitations in Prologue’s printed edition. Here we have listed the acknowledgments to NARA and its archival staff in fuller form, so that the reader might gain a better understanding of the scope of NARA’s influence on the type of work produced by authors and historians over the years. Time and resources permitting, the present list will be supplemented with additional entries as they become known. Readers should feel free to contact Chief Librarian Jeffery Hartley at alic@nara.gov with additional suggestions for inclusion on this list.\n\nSee Also:\n\nAcknowledgements, 2016-\n\nAffection and Trust: The Personal Correspondence of Harry S. Truman and Dean Acheson, 1953-1971 (2010).\n\n\"Clifton Truman Daniel, Thomas W. Daniel, and Harrison Gates Daniel would like to thank Dr. Raymond Gesselbracht, Special Assistant to the Director of the Harry S. Truman Library, for his work in providing the President’s letters used in this book and providing some of the explanatory headnotes, and Kacie Perna, assistant to Dr. Gesselbracht, for typing and formatting parts of the manuscript.\"\n\nAckerman, Kenneth D. Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties (2008).\n\n\"My two principal research homes for Young J. Edgar were the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., and the National Archives in Washington and College Park, Maryland. Both institutions once again proved themselves to be true national gems...At the National Archives, archivists including Fred Romanski, Alan Walker, and Marian Smith came through for me time after time when I needed help in deciphering the complex systems of records from the era.\"\n\nAhlberg, Kristin L. Transplanting the Great Society: Lyndon Johnson and Food for Peace (2008).\n\n\"I have benefited from the assistance of many presidential, state, and university archivists, including Claudia Anderson, Jennifer Cuddyback, Laura Harmon Eggert, Regina Greenwell, Shannon Jarrett, Philip Scott, Linda Selkee, and John Wilson (Lyndon Baines Johnson Library) ....\"\n\nAid, Matthew M. The Secret Sentry: The Untold Story of the National Security Agency (2009).\n\n\"...I would also like to extend his most heartfelt thanks to the staff of the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, for helping me conduct my research over the past two decades. I will always remain deeply indebted to the late John E. Taylor, the doyen of military archivists at the National Archives, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the records based on his fifty years at the archives was unparalleled anywhere. His passing in September 2008 at the age of eighty-seven marks the end of an era. The staff of the NARA Library at College Park, especially its amiable head Jeff Hartley, helped me work the CIA’s CREST database of declassified documents through many trials and tribulations, and stoically processed the vast amount of declassified documents that I brought to their desks day after day without complaint. They are wonderful people.\"\n\nAiken, Charles. The Cotton Plantation South since the Civil War: Creating the North American Landscape (1998).\n\n\"I thank William Creech of the National Archives in Washington who spent hours reading Office of Economic Opportunity documents that I sought and took an enlightened attitude toward what should be available to researchers.\"\n\nAldrich, Mark. Safety First: Technology, Labor, and Business in the Building of American Work Safety, 1870-1939 (1997).\n\n\"Many staff members at the National Archives helped me through various research collections, but Jim Cassedy's assistance with Bureau of Mines materials was invaluable.\"\n\nAlgeo, Matthew. Harry Truman’s Excellent Adventure: The True Story of a Great American Road Trip (2009).\n\n\"Special thanks to Liz Safly and her colleagues at the Truman Library, who made my time there so productive and pleasurable....\"\n\nAllen, Susan Heuck. Classical Spies: American Archaeologists with the OSS in World War II Greece (2011).\n\n\"I should like to thank John Taylor and Lawrence MacDonald at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland....\"\n\nAnderson, Edgar Leo. 50 Days of War and Peace, July 16 to September 3, 1945, or Why Harry Dropped the Atomic Bomb! (2003).\n\n\"There is one man, John E. Taylor, who gave me the impetus to persevere over the years and complete this manuscript. I had run out of research material at the libraries of UCLA and other colleges. After introducing me to all the material in the Los Angeles public library system, Glen Creason, History Librarian, suggested that I continue at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. I made the first of a dozen trips to Washington, D.C., from my home in Los Angeles.\"\n\n\"It was in the National Archives that I met John E. Taylor. He had begun in the military section in 1946 and was still there in the late 1990s. When I met him he mentioned that that Archives would not let him retire, and the reason was that he knew where every document was located. Over the years, he had assisted tens [of] thousands of researchers from around the world. When I outlined my goal of writing a book using documents, rather than interviews, John told me that such a publication was necessary. He said that he would help me in every way. (The Los Angeles Times devoted a half page [page 5a main section] and a picture of John in its January 9, 1995 edition.)\"\n\n\"John, at our first meeting, telephoned the FBI office and said that he was sending Dr. Anderson over and for them to assist me in every way. They were most co-operative and I searched through many boxes and located all the confessions of the spies who stole atomic bomb secrets for the communist Soviet Union. With the assistance of an agent, I was also offered a great deal of other formerly secret documents which are also included in the book. John also telephoned Dr. Dean Allard at the United States Navy Operational Archives and asked him to open the files to me. Each time I entered Dr. Allard’s office, he assigned a yeoman to assist me and said that I was to be given whatever I wanted. He also asked the yeoman-librarian to suggest anything that he might believe would be useful to me, because there were no limits. Every military and archival agency has co-operated with me fully because I assured them that my book would not stress a point or belief.\"\n\nAnderson, Scott. Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East (2013).\n\n\"While these are just a fraction of all those who helped me, I'd particularly like to thank...Liz Gray, David Pfeiffer, and Eric Van Slander at the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C....\"\n\nAndrade, Allan. S.S. Leopoldville Disaster, December 24, 1944 (1997).\n\n\"Others who assisted in my research are gratefully acknowledged:...Elizabeth Safly, Truman Library, Independence, Missouri...\"\n\nAnthony, Carl Sferrazza. First Ladies: The Sage of the President’s Wives and Their Power, 1789-1961 (1992).\n\n\"I also want to especially thank the dedicated staffs of the presidential libraries.\"\n\nArnold, James R. Jeff Davis's Own: Cavalry, Comanches, and the Battle for the Texas Frontier (2000).\n\n\"It was a pleasure renewing acquaintances with the research staff at the National Archives. Mike Musick was particularly helpful at pointing me in the right direction.\"\n\nAron, Cindy Sondik. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Civil Service: Middle-Class Workers in Victorian America (1987).\n\n\"While I was still a graduate student at the University of Maryland, Ira Berlin introduced me to the treasures of the National Archives...Rene Jussaud of the Natural Resources Branch of the National Archives used her extraordinary knowledge of the records to direct me to a wonderful cache of documents. Her efficiency and professionalism made years of research considerably easier. Terry Matchette of the Fiscal and Judicial Branch was also enormously helpful in keeping me supplied with records. This project owes much to the staff at the National Archives who searched for, delivered, and Xeroxed truckloads of documents.\"\n\nAronson, Schlomo. Hitler, the Allies, and the Jews (2006).\n\n\"My archival research greatly profited from several generations of archivists at the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) starting with the late John Mendelsohn and the very much alive Robert Wolfe, to the indispensable John Taylor and Lawrence MacDonald of the Military Branch, and to Dr. Greg Bradsher, the Director of the Holocaust Era Assets Records Project at NARA, all of them walking mines of knowledge and immense personal support, which culminated in Dr. Bradsher’s help in making me a NARA fellow in 2001-2002 and in transforming my fellowship into a very fruitful one.\"\n\nAtkinson, Rick. An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942-1943 (2002).\n\n\"At the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, I thank John W. Carlin, Archivist of the United States; Michael J. Kurtz; Richard Boylan; Timothy Mulligan; and especially Timothy K. Nenninger, who is also president of the Society for Military History. As chief of modern military records, Tim has been an extraordinary guide in the deep woods of the federal archives. He was also kind enough to read the galleys and to offer suggestions. This would be a lesser book without him.\"\n\nAtkinson, Rick. The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944 (2007).\n\n\"At the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, I thank Richard Boylan, Timothy Mulligan, Larry McDonald, and, most particularly, Timothy K. Nenninger, the chief of modern military records and former president of the Society for Military History. Virtually every page of this book bears Tim’s imprint, and I am deeply grateful for his expertise, humor, friendship, and willingness to read a portion of the manuscript...At the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas, I am grateful to the director, David D. Holt, for his help and hospitality, and to archivist David J. Haight. Similarly, at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library in Hyde Park, New York, I thank the director, Cynthia M. Koch, and archivists Robert Parks, Alycia Vivona, Mark Renovitch, and especially Robert Clark, who also helped to have various Secret Service records declassified.\"\n\nBaime, A.J. The Arsenal of Democracy: FDR, Detroit, and an Epic Quest to Arm an America at War (2014).\n\n\"Special thanks go to Greg Bradsher at the National Archives for his work on my behalf and for his great company during the days I spent in College Park.\"\n\nBaker, Horace L. Argonne Days in World War I (2007).\n\n\"This book owes a great deal to the people who helped ... to Mitchell A. Yockelson and Timothy K. Nenninger of the National Archives...\"\n\nBarbier, Mary Kathryn. D-Day Deception: Operation Fortitude and the Normandy Invasion (2007).\n\n\"I would like especially to thank Mitchell Yockelson at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. Mitch made my research at the National Archives easy.\"\n\nBarde, Robert Eric. Immigration at the Golden Gate: Passenger Ships, Exclusion, and Angel Island. (2008).\n\n\"Neil Thomsen, former head archivist at the National Archives and Records Administration, San Bruno, actually launched this book by introducing me to the case file of Quok Shee, the 'Alleged Wife.' Bill Greene, Dan Nealand, and the staff at NARA/San Bruno have been patient and supportive in helping me wade through NARA’s enormous collection and retrieve from it glimpses of our past.\"\n\nBarlow, Jeffrey G. From Hot War to Cold: The U.S. Navy and National Security Affairs, 1945-1955 (2009).\n\n\"Those who deserve particular thanks are: James Leyerzapf and David Haight of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas; Bob Clark and the other archivists of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New York; Dennis Bilger of the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Missouri...John Taylor and the present and former archivists of the National Archives and Records Administration facilities in Washington, D.C., and College Park, Maryland, including Richard von Doehnhoff, Barry Zerbe, Sandy Smith, Wilbert Mahoney, Richard Boylan, Dr. Cary Conn, Dr. Timothy Nenninger, and Richard Myers; Velecia Chance and Michael Waesche of the Reference Service Branch of the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland...\"\n\nBarnett, Louise. Atrocity and American Military Justice in Southwest Asia: Trial by Army (2010).\n\n\"I have incurred many debts in writing this book. First and primarily, to the National Archives and its staff for the trial records and collateral material that are the documents central to my investigation. In particular, I wish to thank Mitch Yockelson for friendship and sustained help over the long course of this project.\"\n\nBarr, Niall. Eisenhower's Armies: The American-British Alliance during World War II (2015).\n\n\"I have been assisted greatly by many librarians and archivists without whom such a work would be impossible...I would also like to thank...Dwight Strandberg at the Eisenhower Library...\"\n\nBarrier, Michael. Funnybooks: The Improbable Glories of the Best American Comic Books (2014).\n\n\"I am also grateful to...Martin Gedra of the National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, Maryland...\"\n\nBarry, John W. The Midwest Goes to War: The 32nd Division in the Great War (2006).\n\n\"Mitchell Yockelson, an archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland, is the person to see regarding the American Expeditionary Forces. He provided invaluable assistance in locating and reviewing 32nd Division files and determining other sources of information. The after-action reports for the 32nd, for example, do not reside in the 32nd Division files but are in the materials pertaining to the American Expeditionary Forces. Kate Flaherty of the Still Photo Section of the National Archives provided considerable assistance in locating many of the photographs used in this book.\"\n\nBarry, Steven Thomas. Battalion Commanders at War: U.S. Army Tactical Leadership in the Mediterranean Theater, 1942-1943 (2013).\n\n\"Dr. Tim Nenninger dedicated his precious time to help locate critical documents in the massive National Archive collections. Without his efforts, I could not have located the information required for a few sections of this book.\"\n\nBartky, Ian R. One Time Fits All: The Campaigns for Global Uniformity (2007).\n\n\"At the National Archives and Records Administration, Sharon Thibodeau continued her decades of outstanding assistance by guiding me through the vast files of U.S. Hydrographic Office maps and State Department correspondence. The archivists Richard Peuser and Rebecca Livingston were instrumental in making my search of nineteenth-century Navy ship logs profitable.\"\n\nBartky, Ian R. Selling the True Time: 19th Century Timekeeping in America (2000).\n\n\"Prior to this research effort, my professional world had never intersected the archival one. First contact came with Sharon Gibbs, then at the Polar and Scientific Archives Branch of the National Archives. Her successful search for materials became the foundation for several articles on time balls. Later, as Sharon Thibodeau, she encouraged my expanding archival efforts. Marjorie Ciarlante, also at the National Archives, gave me much guidance on making efficient use of the many science collections.\"\n\nBaseler, Marilyn C. \"Asylum for Mankind\": America, 1607-1800 (1998).\n\n\"During my research trips I encountered many individuals who went far beyond the call of duty on my behalf. James Owens, director of the National Archives and Record Center in Waltham, not only helped me track down elusive records, but also was there with a set of jumper cables when my car battery went dead. Robert Plowman, former director of the National Archives and Record Center in Philadelphia, went out of his way to accommodate my needs....\"\n\nBass, Gary J. The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide (2013).\n\n\"In California, my gratitude to Timothy Naftali, Paul Wormser, Jon Fletcher, and the other helpful staff at the Nixon Presidential Library. I'm also grateful to the hardworking staff at the U.S. National Archives.\"\n\nBass, Jack. Taming the Storm: The Life and Times of Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. and the South’s Fight over Civil Rights (1993).\n\n\"I remain impressed with the unfailing courtesy and efficiency of the many employees of the National Archives ... whom I called upon for assistance.\"\n\nBatvinis, Raymond J. Hoover's Secret War against Axis Spies: FBI Counterespionage during World War II (2014).\n\n\"Our world could not function without the selfless dedication of archivists and librarians. I start with the staff of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library for their remarkable generosity of time and infinite patience guiding me through FDR's wartime life in papers and photos: senior archivist Robert Clark, the late Karen Anson, who sadly succumbed to cancer in 2010, Virginia Lewick, and Matt Hanson. Elsewhere, I was ably assisted by Alicia Vivona and Spencer Howard, archivist technician at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Museum and Library...\"\n\nBeasley, Maurine H. Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media: A Public Quest for Self-Fulfillment (1987).\n\n\"I also want to acknowledge, with gratitude, the assistance of William R. Emerson, director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and his staff, especially Frances Seeber, Joseph Marshall, Emily Williams, Robert Parks, and Mark Renovitch...Dale C. Mayer, archivist at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library.\"\n\nBeatie, Russel H. The Army of the Potomac: Birth of Command, November 1860-September 1861 (2002).\n\n\"The largest, indeed numberless, group is the legion of thoughtful, helpful, patient archivists at the many great libraries and historical societies that house the life-giving collections of private papers beyond the Official Records:...Michael Musick at the National Archives - than whom no man knows more about the subject and whose willing assistance is truly encyclopedic and always available....\"\n\nBeck, Alfred H. Hitler’s Ambivalent Attaché: Lt. Gen. Friedrich von Boetticher in America, 1933-1941 (2006).\n\n\"Among the staff of the National Archives, William Cunliffe, Richard Boylan, and Dr. Timothy Nenninger deserve special mention for their assistance in locating American G-2 and Federal Bureau of Investigation records that made research on the German attaché complete from the American side. Milt Gustafson led me unerringly to individual pieces of paper in the mountain of wartime State Department records. George Wagner gave me considerable guidance in the use of captured German materials at the National Archives; John Taylor, a legend in his own right at the archives, shared with me his incomparable knowledge of American military intelligence records for the period before World War II. Robert Wolfe remains the indispensable source on the organization and content of the German microfilmed material in the American archives. His work in the field earned him a \"Verdienstkreuz\" from the German government.\"\n\nBelmonte, Laura A. Selling the American Way: U.S. Propaganda and the Cold War (2008).\n\n\"This project would not have been possible without the aide of a small army of archivists and researchers. At the Truman Library, Liz Safly’s lovely demeanor and Dennis Bilger’s incomparable skills made each day in the research room a pleasure...At the National Archives at College Park, Cary Conn and David Pfeiffer provided insightful and good-natured assistance through my efforts to amass my own personal version of RG 306...At the Eisenhower Library, David Haight and Bonita Mulanax’s heroic declassification team made a cold winter in Abilene worthwhile.\"\n\nBennett, M. Todd. One World, Big Screen: Hollywood, the Allies, and World War II (2012).\n\n\"Archivists and librarians facilitated access to the records on which this book is based ... David Langbart and his coworkers at the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration ... and the helpful staffs of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum...\"\n\nBerry, Mary Frances. And Justice for All: The United States Commission on Civil Rights and the Continuing Struggle for Freedom in America (2009).\n\n\"Without the assistance of Walter Hill at the National Archives and the presidential library archivists and their staffs, and staff at a number of other archives and collections, this history would not have been possible. I owe a special debt of gratitude to Deborah Leff, who was the director of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library and to archivists Jennifer Sternaman at the Ronald Reagan Library, Jennifer Evans at the Nixon Presidential Materials, Deborah Wheeler at the George Bush Library, Morgan Blue at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, Kathie Struss at the Eisenhower Library, and Sara Saunders and James A. Yancey, Jr., at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.\"\n\nBeschloss, Michael R. The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman, and the Destruction of Hitler’s Germany, 1941-1945 (2003).\n\n\"During the course of almost eleven years, I have incurred many debts. At the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, Verne Newton gave excellent advice and shared his own work on FDR and the Holocaust. I renewed my old acquaintance with the Library’s chief archivist, Raymond Teichman, always a superb guide to the documentary record of FDR’s diplomacy. In the latter stages of research and writing, I benefited from the help of the capable Bob Clark, as well as Alycia Vivona, Karen Anson, Mark Renovitch, and Robert Parks, and the Library’s new director, Cynthia Koch. At the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, I was aided by Larry Hackman, George Curtis, Michael Devine, Philip Lagerquist, Dennis Bilger, Pauline Testerman, and Elizabeth Safly. At the National Archives, I thank Archivist of the United States, John Carlin, and the redoubtable John Taylor.\"\n\nBeschloss, Michael R. Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964 (1997).\n\n\"From Harry Middleton and his colleagues - Patrick Borders, Tina Houston, Barbara Biffle, Juanita Hannusch, Yolanda Boozer, Claudia Anderson, Regina Greenwell, Linda Hanson, Mary Knill, Philip Scott, Ted Gittinger, and others in the Johnson Library - I have for three years experienced nothing but high archival professionalism. Processing a collection with such complex demands as the five years of Johnson tapes would strain the resources of any presidential library. Throwing these conversations open would almost certainly irritate some of those around LBJ who would have preferred distant, embellished memories of what he said and what others said to him, instead of reality. There is no better evidence of Middleton’s commitment to openness than his insistence on opening all of the recordings as quickly and fully as possible. A different kind of library director might have attempted to hide behind LBJ’s spoken instructions to keep the tapes under seal until at least 2023 and used lawyers to thwart whatever legal challenges historians might have raised to their closure.\"\n\nBeschloss, Michael, ed. Reaching for Glory: Lyndon Johnson’s Secret White House Tapes, 1964-1965 (2001).\n\n\"I first went to the Johnson Library when I was twenty-two and had the pleasure of lunching with its courtly chief, Harry Middleton. Harry is the Joe DiMaggio of presidential library directors...part of Harry’s legacy is the superb staff of the Johnson Library. I thank Patrick Borders, Tina Houston, Linda Seelke, Claudia Anderson, Regina Greenwell, Phillip Scott and their colleagues for help on this project.\"\n\nBest, Gary Dean. Herbert Hoover: The Post-Presidential Years (1983).\n\n\"I gratefully acknowledge the contributions made to my research [at the Hoover Library] by Thomas T. Thalken, director, Robert Wood, assistant director, Dwight Miller, senior archivist and all the other employees who make working there such a delightful experience.\"\n\nBinder, Sarah and Forrest Maltzman. Advice & Dissent: The Struggle to Shape the Federal Judiciary (2009).\n\n\"Jessie Kratz at the Center for Legislative Archives at the National Archives provide invaluable assistance in seeking out archival records related to Senate blue slips....\"\n\nBird, Kai. The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms (1998).\n\n\"A legion of archivists helped me to unearth thousands of pages of Bundy correspondence, diary items, and other primary sources for this book. I am grateful to Stephanie Fawcett, Suzanne Forbes, Maura Porter, June Payne, William Johnson and Allan Goodrich at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library...Regina Greenwell, Linda Hanson and Mary Knill at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library...David Haight at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library...Wilbur Mahoney and David Langbart of the National Archives...and finally, Dwight M. Miller and Dale C. Mayer at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library.\"\n\nBird, Kai and Martin J. Sherwin. American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (2005).\n\n\"Many dedicated archivists went out of their way to guide us through many thousands of pages of official documents and private papers. We wish to thank in particular...John Stewart and Sheldon Stern at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library....\"\n\nBlack, Conrad. Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full (2008)\n\n\"Robert Nedelkoff of the Nixon Presidential Materials Project in College Park, Maryland, has been selfless, tireless, and invaluable in providing access to original documents and arranging photographs. He has shown Job-like patience in receiving telephone calls at home at odd hours, and Samaritanly goodwill in assisting in many vital areas.\"\n\nBlair, Bobby C. and John Peter DeCioccio. Victory at Peleliu: The 81st Infantry Division’s Pacific Campaign (2011)\n\n\"I am indebted to Theresa M. Roy, Gregory Tavormina, and Erika Thompson in the Still Pictures Unit of the National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, Maryland, for their help in obtaining many of the photographs used in this book.\"\n\nBlair, Dale.

Cook. They Fought Like Demons: Women Soldiers in the American Civil War (2002).\n\n\"Michael Musick, who knows more about the Civil War and its sources than anyone else on earth, kindly and continually passed leads our way. We also thank David Wallace, Jo Ann Williamson, Lisa Miller, Dick Higgins, Jeff Hartley, William Dobak, David Langbart, Karen Stefanik, Michael Meier, Stuart Butler, Cynthia Fox, Mary Kay Schmidt, and Rebecca Livingston.\"\n\nBolster, W.

John Deeben, my former student, helped, too, as did Richard Peuser, Trevor Plante, and D’Ann Blanton.\"\n\nBowers, William T., ed. The Line: Combat in Korea, January-February 1951 (2008).\n\n\"At the National Archives, Tim Nenninger, Rich Boylan, and Mitch Yockelson, all of the Modern Military Records, provided invaluable assistance as I tracked down unit records and award recommendations.\"\n\nBoylston, James R. and Allen J.

Christine also located Crockett’s letter to Senator David Barton. Thanks to Kenneth Kato, also an archives specialist in the Center for Legislative Archives, for help in understanding how early nineteenth-century congressional sessions were recorded.\"\n\nBradley, Mark A.

Lichtman. FDR and the Jews (2013).\n\n\"Helpful and knowledgeable archivists contribute heavily to successful research. At the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, we benefited greatly from our conversations with Deputy Director Robert Clark and the assistance of Mark Renovitch, Virginia Lewick, Matthew Hanson, and in earlier years, Robert Parks.

They were wonderful custodians of the raw materials of history and biography.\"\n\n\"At the National Archives, William Cunliffe, Greg Bradsher, and David Langbart all aided us in our search for relevant materials in a vast archive.\"\n\nBreitman, Richard, Barbara McDonald Stewart, and Severin Hochberg, eds.

Confronting America: The Cold War between the United States and the Communists in France and Italy (2011).\n\n\"All three archives also must be recognized for their remarkably helpful staffs, comparable to that I once experienced at the Eisenhower Library. The Ford Library offered perhaps the most enthusiastic support, showing me the treasure of material on international relations in this frequently overlooked archival source. The Carter Library, too, should be noted for its prompt and effective release of material through its electronic resource access. My research experience in the United States also bears the memory of the iconic archivist at the National Archives and Records Administration, Sally Kuisel. I concur with the list-server H-Diplo, who recently so admiringly paid homage to Sally’s memory.\"\n\nBrown, Marilyn. Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans (1994).\n\n\"I also want to thank Barbara Rust of the National Archives, Fort Worth Branch...\"\n\nBrowning, Robert M., Jr. Success Is All That Was Expected: The South Atlantic Blockading Squadron During the Civil War (2002).\n\n\"The staff of the National Archives and in particular John and Angie Van De Dereedt and Rick Peuser all helped tremendously with many of the primary documents. Michael Musick was extremely helpful in locating Army records.\"\n\nBudreau, Lisa M. Bodies of War: World War I and the Politics of Commemoration in America, 1919-1933 (2010).\n\n\"I also owe a special word of thanks to Mitchell Yockelson for drawing my attention to the bountiful Gold Star Mothers material at the National Archives. Mitch’s perpetual encouragement, generous spirit, and superb wit helped to make this book a reality.\"\n\nBugliosi, Vincent. Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy (2007).\n\n\"There simply is no way that this book ended up being the book I think it is without the wonderful cooperation I received from Steven D. Tilley, up until April of 2004 (he has since been elevated) the chief person in charge of these documents (the JFK Assassination Records Collection) at the Archives, and his staff, particularly his able assistant James R. Mathis. Tilley and his staff, more than once, went above and beyond the call of duty to locate obscure but important documents for me. My requests for specific documents, several of which alone contained over a hundred pages each (e.g., the testimony of a witness before the HSCA), were continuous. I kept wondering whether I'd soon be getting a letter from Steve or one of his assistants saying, \"Vince, please. Enough is enough,\" but I never did. What I always got, never accompanied by a complaint, was a very large envelope in the mail containing everything I had requested that they could find. I of course am very grateful to Steve and his staff for all the tremendous assistance they gave me.\"\n\nBurk, Robert Frederick. The Eisenhower Administration and Black Civil Rights (1984).\n\n\"In the course of my study I accumulated a great many obligations. The staff of both the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas, and the State Historical Society of Wisconsin were models of professionalism and friendly assistance.\"\n\nBurr, William and Jeffrey P. Kimball. Nixon's Nuclear Specter: The Secret Alert of 1969, Madman Diplomacy, and the Vietnam War (2015).\n\n\"One of the pleasures of completing this book is that it provides us the opportunity to thank those who helped along the way and over the years. Among them are the dedicated archivists and staffers at the US National Archives, the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library...In particular, we thank Patricia Anderson; Edward Barnes;...Christine Jones; David Langbart;...John Powers; Sam Rushay; and three archivists who have since passed on: Milton Gustafson, Sally Marks, and John Taylor.\"\n\n\"Staffers with US government archives and government agencies were tremendously helpful in making documents available and processing or otherwise facilitating declassification requests for records at the Department of State, the Nixon library, and the National Archives. They include Jay Bosanko, David Fort, Kathleen M. Grant, Thomas Haughton, Dorothy Johnson, and Kenneth Stein.\"\n\nBush, George W. Decision Points (2010).\n\n\"I am indebted to the professionals at the National Archives and Records Administration for their assistance on this book. I am grateful to Alan Lowe, director of the George W. Bush Presidential Library, and Supervisory Archivist Shannon Jarrett for making this project a top priority. Archivists Brooke Clement, Matthew Law, and Jodie Steck tracked down thousands of documents and photographs that helped refresh my memory and confirm details in my account. Sarah Barca, Tally Fugate, Peter Haligas, Neelie Holm, Bobby Holt, Elizabeth Lanier, David Sabo, and Ketina Taylor helped as well. I also thank the Presidential Materials staff of the National Archives in Washington - especially Nancy Smith, John Laster, and Stephannie Oriabure - who made many important, highly classified documents available for my use.\"\n\nButler, Stuart. Real Patriots and Heroic Soldiers: General Joel Leftwich and the Virginia Brigade in the War of 1812 (2008.)\n\n\"Much of this book could not have been written without access to the voluminous military records of the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C. Accordingly, I wish to express my deep appreciation to my former boss and current Chief of the Old Military and Civil Branch, Cynthia Fox. Without her generous assistance and permission to use the relevant War of 1812 military records, this book would not have been written; at a minimum, it would not have been written in the time that it was. For this, I will always be indebted for her kind permission to use the records as I did, more, perhaps, than she will ever know. Also, my sincere thanks and appreciation to my former colleague and friend, Mr. Robert Matchette, who often facilitated my access to the records and retrieved often obscure and difficult to locate items. In addition, my thanks to my former colleagues, Assistant Branch Chief, Richard Peuser, and fellow archivists, Trevor Plante, DeAnne Blanton, Michael Pilgrim, Mitchell Yockelson, and John VanDerredt.\"\n\nButtenweiser, Ann L. Governor’s Island: The Jewel of New York Harbor (2009).\n\n\"The search for unusual photographs led me to a variety of fascinating institutions ... Mitchell Yockelson at the National Archives and Records Administration...helped mightily to fill in the rest of the pieces.\"\n\nByerly, Carol R. \"Good Tuberculosis Men\": The Army Medical Department's Struggle with Tuberculosis (2013).\n\n\"I relied on the expertise of many archivists and librarians to negotiate such a rich and varies historical record and thank the following navigators: Mitchell Yockelson, Rich Boylan, and Trevor Plant at the National Archives I and II in the Washington, DC, area; Eileen Bolger and Marene Baker at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Regional Branch in Denver, Colorado; staff at the NARA regional branch in Fort Worth, Texas...\"\n\nCahill, Cathleen D. Federal Fathers & Mothers: A Social History of the United States Indian Service, 1869-1933 (2011).\n\n\"This book also could not have been written without the resources of our nation’s archives and their guardians. To the archivists and staff at the National Archives and Records Administration branches in Washington, D.C. (especially Mary Frances Ronan), San Bruno, Chicago (particularly Scott Forsyth), and Denver, as well as to the staff at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis (especially Lisa Boykin), I am eternally grateful.\"\n\nCalhoun, Frederick S. The Lawmen: United States Marshals and their Deputies, 1789-1989 (1989).\n\n\"In any undertaking such as this, a good archivist is essential. I was fortunate to work with Cynthia G. Fox, who is quite simply the best archivist at the National Archives. She guided me through the maze of judicial records, suggested other sources, conducted research, commented on drafts of the manuscript, and became my friend. She first suggested using the implementation of the Constitution as a theme, then waited patiently for me to discover it on my own. The book could hardly have been started, much less completed, without her.\"\n\n\"Other archivists helped. Clarence Lyons, Ron Swerczek, Mary Ronan, and John Roberts of the National Archives were invaluable.\"\n\nCalifano, Joseph A., Jr. Inside: A Public and Private Life (2004).\n\n\"The Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Texas, the finest of the presidential libraries thanks to Harry Middleton, was unfailingly cooperative.

These include...Bob Clark, Supervisory Archivist, Dr. Raymond Teichman, Director of Research, and Clifford Laube of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library...\"\n\nCarlson, Elliot. Joe Rochefort's War: The Odyssey of the Codebreaker Who Outwitted Yamamoto at Midway (2011).\n\n\"Most of the documents used for this book reside at three sites of the National Archives. At the Archives II I benefitted from the assistance of Barry Zerby and Patrick Osborne. Rebecca A. Livingston solved my archival problems at Archives I in downtown Washington, D.C. Robert E. Glaass did the same at the Archives' Pacific Region branch in San Bruno, California, setting before me more than forty boxes of material.\"\n\nCaro, Robert A. Master of the Senate (2002).\n\n\"For me, during the past twelve years, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library has meant a single person: Claudia Wilson Anderson....\n\n\"Claudia is a Senior Archivist at the Library - a title which does not adequately do justice to her abilities, or to her significance in the study of American history. Like Dick Baker and Don Ritchie, she is an historian in the highest sense of the word. She knows - she has made it her business to know - the archival material in her charge as thoroughly as it is possible for a single human being to know those thousands of boxes of documents. And she wants historians - and through them history and the world - to know that material. And in addition to this motivation - the motivation of the true historian - there is about her work a rare integrity and generosity of spirit. I can’t even imagine how many questions I have asked of Claudia (Where could I find material on this senator or that issue? Didn’t I once, years ago, see a piece of paper somewhere in which George Reedy was advising Johnson not to keep ignoring Hubert Humphrey? What file might that be in?). No matter how many questions I asked her, however, I cannot remember one on which she didn’t make as much of an effort as possible to answer it. And beyond such help on individual inquiries, her overall expertise - her guidance through the Lyndon Johnson Archives - has been the guidance of a perceptive and discriminating expert. I notice that every other biographer of Lyndon Johnson has thanked Claudia for help. They should have. History’s knowledge of Johnson will be the richer for her help. I can’t imagine any biographer who owes her more than I do.\"\n\n\"At the Johnson Library also, Linda Seelke, E. Phillip Scott, Ted Gittinger, and Kyla Wilson have been of help with this volume.\"\n\nCaro, Robert A. Means of Ascent (1990).\n\n\"The Staff of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library have been, over many years now, of more help to me than I can easily express.\"\n\nAs always, Claudia Anderson has been of particular help because of her historian’s instinct and the depth of her knowledge of the contents of the Johnson archives. Tina Houston, the Library’s supervisory archivist, and Mike Gillette, Linda Hanson, Ted Gittinger, David Humphrey, Joan Kennedy, E. Phillip Scott, Nancy Smith, Robert Tissing, Shellyne Wucher, Regina Greenwell, Irene Parra, and Kathy Frankum deserve - and have - my deep gratitude for years of help.\"\n\nCarter, David C. The Music Has Gone Out of the Movement: Civil Rights and the Johnson Administration, 1965-1968 (2009).\n\n\"Underneath every historian’s solo voice one ought to be listening for a muted chorus of archivists, many of them ripe for canonization given all the ways we test their patience. A Moody Grant funded my first visit to the LBJ Library in Austin, where Michael Parrish smoothed my transition into the collections. Linda Seelke set the bar of professionalism impossibly high, but directed a staff committed to clearing it. At the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, Walter Hill and Fred Romanski cheerfully cast me into the labyrinth of Great Society bureaucracy.\"\n\nCarter, James M. Inventing Vietnam: The United States and State Building, 1954-1968 (2008).\n\n\"At the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library, John Wilson and Linda Hansen Seelke were always ready to help and willing to share their considerable knowledge and understanding of not only the archives, but also the era of the Johnson presidency.\"\n\nCasey, Steven.

The Chinese in America: A Narrative History (2003).\n\n\"In Washington D.C., John Taylor, a friend and cherished fixture at the National Archives for more than half a century, was one of the best allies an author could hope for. Compassionate and knowledgeable, profoundly wise and endlessly helpful, John Taylor played a special role in helping me research this book, just as he did for my first two books, and my research benefited from his vast experience...\"\n\n\"Neil Thomsen, formerly of the National Archives and Records Administration at San Bruno, gave me copies of the most intriguing historical documents he had found during his long career there.\"\n\nCheevers, Jack. Act of War: Lyndon Johnson, North Korea, and the Capture of the Spy Ship Pueblo (2013).\n\n\"Any book is, of course, the child of its author, but this one was born and raised with the help of many people. In particular I'd like to thank...Stuart Culy, who provided box upon box of key documents from the National Archives in College Park, Maryland; and William J. Bosanko, director of the Information Security Oversight Office in Washington, D.C., who worked diligently over several years to help declassify revealing documents from the CIA and National Security Agency....Senior archivist Rebecca Greenwell and others at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, assisted me in declassifying scores of documents that had been locked in the library's files, unavailable to the public, for years.\"\n\nCheney, Lynne.

James Madison: A Life Reconsidered (2014).\n\n\"At the National Archives, another of the nation's great treasures, I was aided immeasurably by Jacqueline Budell, who helped me find my way to documents on the archives' Web site, such as letters written by high officials, and to items as yet undigitized, such as an account written by a clerk, Mordecai Booth, who in 1814 helped burn the Washington Navy Yard before the British could seize it. I thank her and also David Langbart for his help. My gratitude as well to Nancy Smith, who was kind enough to arrange for me to bring my grandchildren to the archives so that we could all marvel over the Constitution of the United States, the world-changing document on display there.\"\n\nChisholm, Donald.

Silent Coup: The Removal of a President (1991).\n\n\"During years of investigation and research, we found the Nixon Presidential Materials Staff, an arm of the National Archives, located in Alexandria, Virginia, to be an invaluable resource. We gratefully acknowledge those staff members who assisted us. Supervisory Archivist Dr. Byron A. Parham deserves special recognition for his professionalism, thoroughness, and ever-present good humor. Audiovisual archivist Dick McNeill and photo specialist Mary Young provided materials from which we selected a number of photographs for the book.\"\n\n\"At the Center for Legislative Archives, also part of the National Archives, Robert Coren, chief of the reference branch, his predecessor, David Kepley, and archivist Rodney Ross were extremely helpful over the years in providing and interpreting the files of the Senate Watergate committee. Similarly, David Paynter of the archives’ textual reference division, and his predecessor Steve Tilley, provided documents from the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and tracked down those that had been difficult to find. In sum, all of the professionals with whom we dealt at the various archives branches contributed greatly to our research efforts.\"\n\nConverse, Elliott V., III. Rearming for the Cold War, 1945-1960 (2012).\n\n\"My research for this volume took me to more than a dozen archives and libraries. There I found professional historians, archivists, and librarians always willing to go out of their way to help me locate source materials. I spent most of my time at the National Archives and Records Administration's outstanding facility at College Park, Maryland. Over the course of several years I received assistance from literally dozens of its staff members, but especially from Dr. Timothy K. Nenninger, Chief of Modern Military Records, who became familiar with my subject and was able to identify and make available documents that I would not have found on my own.\"\n\nCorke, Sarah-Jane.

I am deeply indebted to David Haight from the Eisenhower Library, who was relentless in his pursuit of documents, which I absolutely had to take a look at, if not for this project then the next. His energy and wealth of knowledge made my job a lot easier. I would also like to thank...Larry MacDonald, Ken Schlesinger and John Taylor from the National Archives in Washington. Finally, I wanted to gratefully acknowledge the support I received from the staff at the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.

Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power (2007).\n\n\"At Archives II in College Park, Maryland, where the Richard Nixon presidential materials are housed, the archivists John Powers and Samuel Rushay were indispensable in helping me find my way through the millions of pages available to researchers studying the Nixon presidency. Michael Hamilton was especially helpful in dealing with the 2800 hours of tapes currently available for study. Allen Rice greatly facilitated the search for photographs.\"\n\nDallek, Robert. An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963 (2003).\n\n\"The staffs of the various libraries and archives cited in the notes were uniformly helpful, but none was more essential to the study of Kennedy’s personal life than the exquisitely located John F. Kennedy Library at Columbia Point, overlooking Boston Harbor. The staff was consistently helpful, but I am particularly grateful to Megan Desnoyers, who worked so diligently to arrange my access of Joseph P. Kennedy’s papers and, most importantly, the Janet Travell collection of medical records that had been unavailable to biographers until the donor committee agreed to open them to me in 2002.\"\n\nDaniel, Pete. Dispossession: Discrimination Against African American Farmers in the Age of Civil Rights (2013).\n\n\"One of the delights of historical research is relying on archivists. Joe Schwarz at the National Archives and Records Administration has over the years patiently guided me to both obvious and obscure sources. He good-naturedly shrugged his shoulders and smiled when I sent numerous Smithsonian fellows to him, and he gave them all careful attention.\"\n\nDaum, Andreas.

Nenninger, the head of the Modern Military Branch, who when the other Tim, Tim Frank, the freelance researcher, sought him out at once went up into the stacks to find the file in question. The individual who found it, all of us knowing it was there, was the former World War I archivist Mitchell A. Yockelson, who remembered a small collection of cards in the Department of the Inspector General. He experimented with different words in the file’s long title, and an unlikely word opened the file. It was a feat of archival investigation.\"\n\nFerren, John M.

Among the professionals, I owe immense thanks to several archivists who took a personal interest in this project. While researching in the Washington, D.C., National Archives, I met Richard Boylen, who helped me locate some valuable information on tribal resources. Unfortunately we were unable to locate any information in the Federal Employment Practices Commission that summer. A couple of years later, I received an unexpected package from Richard containing information on an unfair employment complaint from a Native American. Because Richard was gracious enough to remember my research, this information became a vital aspect in the chapter on Indian laborers.\"\n\nFrankum, Ronald Bruce, Jr. Vietnam's Year of the Rat: Elbridge Durbrow, Ngo Dinh Diem and the Turn in U.S. Relations, 1959-1961 (2014).\n\n\"I am indebted to Herb Pankratz, Michelle Kopfer, and Chalsea Millner at the Dwight D.

The Contender: Richard Nixon, The Congress Years, 1946-1952 (1999).\n\n\"...the National Archives and Records Administration, Pacific Southwest Region, houses the Richard M. Nixon Pre-Presidential Papers. Diane Nixon, the regional director, has made certain that anything that can be made available has been, and Paul Wormser, the principal archivist in charge of this collection, has been exceptional. I cannot thank them and the other members of the staff enough for their kindnesses; they represent professionalism at its best. Milton Gustafson, senior specialist, at the National Archives in College Park, has been a valued resource since I first started writing.\"\n\n\"Various presidential libraries were obvious stops. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Library holds a wide variety of manuscripts, and archivist James Leyerzaft ably provided direction while Kathleen Struss, audiovisual archivist, showed me film and photographs. The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library had a wide range of material dealing with Hoover and his relationship to Nixon that archivist Dale Mayer culled out for me. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Library holds the Drew Pearson collection, and Claudia Anderson, senior archivist, supplied me with his files. At the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library, archivist Raymond Teichman and Robert Parks assisted me with Laurence Duggan's correspondence with Sumner Welles. Randy Sowell and Dennis Belger, archivists at the Harry S. Truman Library, provided me with material relating to the president's connection to Nixon, and Pauline Testerman, audiovisual archivist, showed me film of the president's conversation with Pearson.\"\n\nGellman, Irwin F. The President and the Apprentice: Eisenhower and Nixon, 1952-1961 (2015).\n\n\"Along with advice from the above scholars, I have depended upon exceptional archivists. This volume primarily relies on the millions of documents housed at the Nixon and Eisenhower libraries. I spent more than seven years examining documents at the Nixon presidential library in California. Susan Naulty went far beyond the call of duty preparing documents for me to examine; her assistant Beverly Lindy rose to the same level. Gregory Cumming later assumed command and provided additional assistance. Loie Gaunt, who had worked for Nixon since the early 1950s, was a valuable source of information. Diane Nixon and Paul Wormser, who managed the National Archive's regional office in Laguna Niguel, could not have been more gracious. Diane reviewed more than a hundred boxes of documents and declassified them for me. Without their diligence, I would not have seen thousands of Nixon documents that I needed to complete this study.\"\n\n\"Karl Weissenbach directs the Eisenhower presidential library in Abilene, Kansas, and he has welcomed me as a serious scholar, as had his predecessor Dan Holt (his wife Marilyn has written on Mamie and shared the results of her research with me). For years until his retirement, James Leyerzapf served as my guide to the Eisenhower manuscripts as few could do. Timothy Rives followed the high standard that Jim set, and Chelsea Millner could not have been more helpful.\"\n\n\"The Truman presidential library also provided crucial material. Sam Rushay, Ray Geselbracht, and Randy Sowell are models for archivists. Bob Clark, at the Franklin Roosevelt presidential library fits in a similar category. Claude Anderson at the Lyndon Johnson presidential library took me through the exhaustive oral history collection and other documents that were essential for this volume. Jeff Hartley at Archives II in College Park, Maryland, provided documents from CREST.\"\n\nGendzier, Irene. Dying to Forget: Oil, Power, Palestine, and the Foundations of U.S. Policy in the Middle East (2015).\n\n\"The archivists and specialists at the Harry S.

Mike and Howard were especially helpful in finding Meigs items, and providing citation information. Dale Floyd, of the National Archives and Records Administration, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers shared information on fortifications and pontoon bridges. Patricia Eames, formerly of the National Archives and Records Administration, assisted with early document transcriptions and Meigs's genealogy.

I owe special and long standing gratitude to William R. Emerson, retired director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, New York. Under his guidance at Yale I took my first plunge into military and diplomatic history with an audacious undergraduate thesis on the Herron-Lammasch talks of 1918 - little knowing that this \"covert operation\" would appear again in my later life.

Truscott, Jr. (2010).\n\n\"It is always a pleasure to visit the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, and work with the thoroughly professional archivists there. I should like to extend special thanks to Mitchell A. Yockelson, archivist nonpareil, respected military historian in his own right, and colleague and friend. Lawrence H. McDonald was particularly helpful and patient as he introduced me to the CIA Research Tool during my research on General Truscott's CIA years. William B. Mahoney, Timothy K. Nenninger, John E. Taylor, and Carolyn Gilliam were on hand to lend aid.\"\n\nHeide, Lars. Punched-Card Systems and the Early Information Explosion, 1880-1945 (2009).\n\n\"At the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and in New York, I received extensive help from Greg Bradsher, Marjorie H. Ciarlante, Tab Lewis, and Fred Romanski.\"\n\nHerf, Jeffrey. Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World (2009).\n\n\"With pleasure, I acknowledge the people and institutions that supported the research and writing of this book. Thanks are due to archivists at the United States National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland, for their assistance in locating relevant files of the United States Department of State. Lawrence MacDonald, in particular, helped unravel some of the complexities of the World War II-era American intelligence files. My fellow historian Richard Breitman, himself a pioneer in the scholarly use of American intelligence and diplomatic files in the United States National Archives regarding the Holocaust, shared both his deep knowledge of them as well as encouragement for this project. His assertion that our National Archives contain a great deal of material of interest to historians of modern European history has turned out to be even more accurate than I anticipated.\"\n\nHerken, Gregg.
