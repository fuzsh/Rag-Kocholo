        "text": "REVISED PROOF Historical legacies, institutional change, and policy leadership: the case of Alexandre Millerand and the French factory inspectorate Frieda Fuchs # Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009 Abstract Focusing on Alexandre Millerand’s reform of the French factory inspectorate, this article highlights the dilemmas of mezzo-level administrative leadership and policy reform in states that have strong administrative capacity, but low public trust and weak associational life. Building on the insights of theories of political and bureaucratic entrepreneurship derived from studies of American political development, the article challenges their taken-for-granted assumptions and comparative applicability, and demonstrates the explanatory potential of the older sociological institutionalism exemplified in the work of Philip Selznick. In particular, the article highlights the unintended consequences of the formal and informal cooptation of targeted social groups for the reputational autonomy of administrative leaders, the (re)definition of institutional mission, and organizational success or failure. This article examines the impact of state legitimacy and public trust in political institutions on the leadership potential of politicians and civil servants through a historical case study of the creation and evolution of the French factory inspectorate in the Third Republic (1870–1940). More specifically, it focuses on the efforts of Alexandre Millerand (1859–1943), the first Socialist (after Louis Blanc in 1848) to hold a ministerial post in any European country, 1 to advance the cause of protective labor legislation through the institutionalization of the factory inspectorate and the partial cooptation of organized labor. I argue that the case of Millerand’ s reform of the French factory inspectorate represents an excellent illustration of the historical- institutional constraints on leadership and policy innovation in a state with high administrative capacity, but low in public trust and with a weak associational life.

Fuchs (*) Department of Politics, Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH, USA e-mail: frieda_fuchs@hotmail.com\n\nREVISED PROOF the broadest sense, therefore, this article challenges the emphasis of traditional historical institutionalism on state capacity as the independent variable that enables or constrains political and administrative actors in their efforts to forge coalitions, shape policy, and engage in state-building. 2 By contrast, in line with some more recent works on the problematic of legitimacy, trust, and consent, 3 I argue that the French case illustrates the importance state legitimacy and institutional trust-building for effective policy-making even in a democratic state with strong administrative capacity. In this respect, the contrast between the success of the nineteenth-century British state in implementing a centralized model of factory inspection and the relative failure of reformist politicians and administrators in France’ s Third Republic to replicate Britain’ s success in this area of welfare state development is most telling. Despite their conscious adoption of the British model of factory inspection, strong administrative capacity, and efforts to coopt key social groups, reformist French elites failed to garner sufficient elite and mass support for protective labor legislation. I argue that one of the main reasons for this failure lies in the different degrees of legitimacy enjoyed by the British and French states. Traditionally defined as administratively “weak” in comparison to its French counterpart, the British state was characterized by a significant degree of legitimacy (despite serious working class challenges to the state until the second half of the nineteenth century); a legacy of parliamentary centralization that facilitated policy implementation; shared informal norms governing elite political and administrative behavior (personal integrity based on “gentlemanly qualities”); and a tradition of cooperation between central and local political and administrative elites. 4 Although these background factors did not automatically ensure institutional success, they facilitated adminis- trative leadership tasks by providing the British factory inspectors with a degree of institutional autonomy that proved indispensable for institutional reputation-building and policy implementation. 5 By contrast, overcoming the historically-rooted distrust of different social groups (workers, but also employers) towards the state was one of the broader goals of reformist social policy in the French Third Republic, forcing political elites to develop strategies better suited to a hostile environment. 6 Rather than engaging in formal coalition-building, a taken for granted strategy in more legitimate and institutionally stable states with a strong associational life, reformist political elites in the Third Republic attempted to garner support for their policies through the formal 2 For more on the “state capacities” approach, see Evans et al.
