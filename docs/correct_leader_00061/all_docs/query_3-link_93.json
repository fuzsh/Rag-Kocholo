The era of the privileged French presence in Palestine and more specifically in Jerusalem – the seat of the most venerated Christian Holy Places – had come to a close. For French diplomacy, this failure signaled its ultimate defeat in the battle against the English begun as of late 1915 for the pos...",

        "text": "2To date historical research has neglected this feature of the Palestinian settlement and has focused on the main outcomes, the British victory and the French defeat; namely, aside from the local power play between the two powers, their variable success in handling the nationalistic Zionistic and Arab factors. Nevertheless, this diplomatic battle which ended in April 1920 at San Remo, left two totally or partially unresolved issues: the fate of the religious protectorate and the setting of the Syrian-Palestinian border. These were doubtless secondary issues, but their solutions have direct bearing on current issues – the regime of the Holy Places and control of water in the region.\n\n4First and foremost however, we need a better picture of what this centuries-old institution of the protectorate stood for in 1917, when General Allenby's army, dutifully escorted by the diplomat Francois Georges-Picot, the French High Commissioner, made his formal entry into Jerusalem liberated from the Turks.\n\nThe protectorate and the Powers at the end of 1917\n\n6Since 1535, the date of the well-known agreement between Suleiman and Francois 1st, the “Elder Daughter of the Church” was granted the right to protect its subjects residing in the Empire. This protection was expanded in 1740 both individually and collectively to cover all the members of the clergy adhering to the Latin rite settled in the Levant, regardless of nationality or institution. These legal privileges were extended by custom to Orthodox Christians.\n\n7Three “paradoxes” can account for the birth and the longevity of the complex protectorate system, as well as its devolution to France. Moslem domination, which was Arab from the year 638 and then Ottoman from the years 1516-1517 over the Christian Holy Places, the sanctuaries and their dependencies created numerous problems which made the intercession and the protection of a Christian power desirable. Since the head of the Vatican State and Christianity, the most directly affected was forbidden to have contacts with the Infidel, a secular branch capable (depending on the era) of flattering or standing up to the Turks was hence indispensable. Similarly, an arbitrator capable of policing the sanctuaries was needed, in particular after the eleventh century when the rites and churches resulting from successive schisms jostled viciously to officiate. This peace-keeping mission was held for many years by Byzantium, and then Venice. Beginning in the sixteenth century France, the “Elder Daughter of the Church” but also the ally of the Turks because of its hereditary rivalry with Austria, took over this role with the blessings of the Vatican.\n\n10Nevertheless the protectorate abolished by the Turks in 1914 had already lost some of its former splendor. Even though the position of France had been recognized by the European Powers in 1878, its protectorate over individuals and non-French establishments weakened progressively through efforts of competitive nations, who were concerned about protecting their citizens and obtained the necessary Capitulations from the Sublime Porte. Russia, which as of the end of the 18th century and even more so after 1820 created the first breach, by positioning itself as the protector of the Orthodox. Others such as Germany followed suit, and ultimately Italy who had signed an agreement with France in 1905 allowing Italian institutions that so desired to withdraw from French protection. Data qre scarce on the real decline of the French protection of Catholics in Palestine but it was felt, especially after the break in diplomatic relations between France and the Vatican and the separation of Church and State in 1904-1905. In addition the consuls expressed their regret that aside from French institutions the protectorate had been reduced to Franciscan institutions of the Custody of the Holy Land and the Latin Patriarchate. However the Custody, theoretically an international institution, but primarily Italian in reality, was no longer as secure a support as in the past.\n\n12How did the French diplomacy respond to these inroads and petty quarrels? The tradition of the protectorate continued to be used as one of the arguments supporting France's imperialistic designs on the Middle East, above all in Syria.\n\n14The system was thus already in decline, its foundations shaken by the broken alliance between France and the Vatican when it ceased to function in October-November of 1914. Abolished legally by the unilateral decision of the Sublime Porte, the protectorate ceased to function on paper while its real reasons for being vanished in part after the expulsion by the Turkish Authorities of the Consuls and clergy belonging to the Allied nations. There was however no official declaration on the part of France or the Allies on this subject, doubtless because they initially hoped to prevent Turkey from joining the Central Powers, and later hoped to have Turkey (who entered the war on November 2) agree to a separate compromise peace treaty.\n\n16Collusion between Britain and Russia made the move to internationalization inevitable, and was associated with a geographic extension which the French had not predicted. The Sykes-Picot Agreement of May 1916 lay the groundwork for a yet unspecified form of “international administration” over most of Palestine described as a “brown zone”. As soon as Italy, which had entered the war the previous year, obtained a copy of this agreement in October 1916, it wasted no time proclaiming that it was “directly concerned by the governing of the Holy Places” and stating its desire to terminate the French protectorate through internationalization, the solution which Sydney Sonnino, the unflinching Italian Foreign Minister would support until the end.\n\nThe first battle is lost: the end of the principle of the traditional French protectorate (1918-1920).\n\n18Although tightly linked to the Franco-British negotiations on the political future of Palestine, the negotiations concerning the protectorate operated from their inception on a fairly autonomous basis. First, unlike the political discussions which were voluntarily frozen in May 1916 at the start of the Peace Conference in January 1919, the battle over the protectorate started at the end of 1917 as soon as Palestine was occupied. Secondly, they involved players aside from Zionists and Arabs, namely the Vatican and Italy. Paradoxically, this interference, more than the British factor, fueled France's ambition to restore its protectorate whatever the price.\n\n19British bad faith was obvious in this area as it was for Palestine as a whole, which it viewed as its private hunting ground since Lloyd George became Prime Minister in December 1916. But in the transitional phase of British occupation, it did not dare take radical initiatives as regards religion. Relying solely on its customary pragmatism, it clearly placed the problem of the Holy Places low on its list of priorities. The temporary maintenance of the protectorate may have been seen as a means of satisfying its French ally's disproportional aims, in a context of growing tension, while avoiding a delicate duty even though Turkish defeat was still not complete. Allenby thus solemnly promises to respect the customs of Palestine and let Georges-Picot enter in full dress uniform into Jerusalem as did the Consuls of France in by-gone years to take office or welcome civil or religious dignitaries. Although it is doubtless excessive on the part of the representative of France to claim as he did in December 1917 that there was an agreement among the Powers that France could continue to exercise its religious protection, there was something of a tacit agreement that the right to domination was not enough to seal the fate of the Middle East in general. Lastly, as the mighty Protestant Power supporting the Zionist enterprise, Britain was interested in not obfuscating the Vatican. London however also knew it could count on the Vatican's wish to see the Christian Holy Places finally attributed a permanent international status to undermine the weak reestablished French protectorate as well as Italian ambitions.\n\nThe Finalization of the French Defeat (1920-1924)\n\n29Over the next four years, France used the full bag of tricks and quibbles possible to preserve certain religious privileges in Palestine, either by saving some of the outward manifestations of the former protectorate or by obtaining a predominant role in the Commission on the Holy Places. This was a game it could not play without some kind of support from the Vatican which like the other Powers involved, sparked rivalries to achieve its own ends.\n\n37Thus after six embattled years, the French defeat was complete. The clearly disproportional investment of French diplomacy in the defense of the protectorate, an outdated form of influence, is hence highly comparable to the irrational attitude of the Italians as S.I. Minerbi shows in his analysis. The French diplomats, like the Italians, were unable to rise above beliefs and antiquated conduct and devise a new and more reality-based strategy of influence.\n\n38With doubtful value as to rival national interests, the struggle was for many years an obstacle to religious peace in the Holy Land. By taking over the religious protectorate, Britain deliberately chose not to apply an international decision, by a kind of “right of occupation”. This was clearly a pernicious example. The Mandatory and Protector Power was soon required to cope with disturbances affecting not only the Christian Holy Places but also and above all the Jewish and Moslem sanctuaries. This led to an increasingly inextricable situation. Nevertheless the Catholic Powers also bear heavy responsibility in this state of affairs. Unable to quell the rivalries of the past, they contributed to the failure of the first of many forms of internationalization of the Holy Land envisaged to this day."
