He arrives with his ADC Colonel O A FitzGerald and Brigadier-General the Honourable H Yarde-Buller (not Major-General as in the captions), and inspects the guard of honour. The party, led by Kitchener and Joffre, walk through a wood towards a slit trench. They observe practice manoeuvres (not seen) from this trench, which is clearly in a safe area but is described by the caption as \"the front line trenches\". Lord Kitchener reviews French colonial troops. Millerand gives Yarde-Buller, and FitzGerald (not seen) the Legion of Honour, and Joffre decorates men of a colonial division for bravery.\n\nPhysical description\n\n35mm\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nFilm\n\nRelated period\n\nFirst World War (production), First World War (content)\n\nProduction date\n\n1915\n\nPlace made\n\nFrance\n\nDimensions\n\nwhole: Number Of Items/reels/tapes 1\n\nCatalogue number\n\nIWM 1062-20\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.

The most important of these was the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA), passed on 8 August 1914 ‘for securing public safety’.\n\nFirst World War\n\n8 Celebrity Air Aces Of The First World War\n\nAviation was one of the most romanticised elements of the First World War. 'Air aces' in particular achieved celebrity status both during and after the war and their photographs regularly appeared in newspapers. Of the eight aces listed here, seven were killed in action between 1916 and 1918 or died in flying accidents during or after the war.\n\nFirst World War\n\nWhizz Bangs And Wind-Ups: 10 Tommy Slang Terms\n\nDuring the First World War, British soldiers used language in inventive and often humorous ways. The words and phrases they used reflected everything from the dull routines of service to the traumas of front line action, often tinged with characteristic black humour and irony.\n\nShare this"
