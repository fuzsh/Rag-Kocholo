        "meta_description": "Key decision-makers on both sides of the Channel agreed that an alliance between Britain and France in the aftermath of the First World War would represent a major step towards securing their hard-won victory and achieving European stability. Yet negotiations during and after the 1919 Paris Peace Conference failed to conclude terms satisfactory to both states. This paper investigates British attitudes towards a possible pact with France, concentrating in particular on the discussions that occurred in late 1921 and early 1922 which revealed much about the perceptions and objectives of the two powers now most responsible, in the absence of the United States, for executing the Versailles settlement with Germany. Although personalities may have played a minor role in the failure of these negotiations it suggests that the more fundamental missed opportunity was the inability of both states to recognise that a ‘return to normalcy’ was not a viable option.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n1In December 1921 George Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, advised the Cabinet,\n\n1 Memorandum, 28.12.21 in W.N. Meddlicott, Douglas Dakin and M.E. Lambert (eds.), Documents on Britis (...)\n\nAs a result of the war there remain only two really great powers in Europe - France and ourselves.... For a considerable period, therefore, a combination of Great Britain and France would be so strong that no other likely combination could successfully resist it. It follows that a definite and publicly announced agreement between the two countries to stand by one another in case either were attacked would offer a guarantee of peace of the strongest kind.\n\nThe 1919 British Guarantee\n\n5Clemenceau, who attached great significance to maintaining the war-time alliance, dropped the French Rhineland demand, despite the bitter opposition of his compatriots, President Raymond Poincaré, and Marshal Ferdinand Foch, commander-in-chief of the allied forces. He did so after negotiating the Rhineland’s permanent demilitarisation and, despite Lloyd George’s opposition and Wilson’s reluctance, an Allied military occupation of at least fifteen years. With these hurdles surmounted the conference moved ahead and, on 7 May, the Germans were presented with a draft treaty. Clemenceau believed he had obtained not only continuing Anglo-American engagement in French security but also the physical guarantee of the Rhineland occupation, which could be extended if Germany did not fulfil its treaty obligations, offering France the opportunity to persuade the inhabitants of the advantages of a more permanent union.\n\nContinuing British Debate about a Guarantee, 1920-1921\n\n8Curzon’s predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, was less sure, declaring in March 1919 that the French,\n\ndraw a lurid picture of future Franco-German relations. They assume that the German population will always far outnumber the French; that as soon as the first shock of defeat has passed away, Germany will organise herself for revenge; that all our attempts to limit armaments will be unsuccessful; that the League of Nations will be impotent; and consequently, that the invasion of France, which was accomplished in 1870, and partially accomplished in the recent War, will be renewed with every prospect of success.\n\n9He concluded\n\n11 Balfour Memorandum, 18.3.19, Balfour Papers, Add Mss 49751, British Library.\n\nThey may be right; but if they are, it is quite certain that no manipulation of the Rhine frontier is going to make France anything more than a second-rate Power, trembling at the nod of its great neighbours on the East, and depending from day to day on the changes and chances of a shifting diplomacy and uncertain alliances.’\n\n13 Robert Graves, Goodbye to All That (London, Penguin Edition, 1963) p. 240.\n\nAnti-French feeling amongst most ex-soldiers amounted almost to an obsession. Edmund, [Blunden] shaking with nerves, used to say at this time: “No more wars for me at any price! Except against the French. If there's ever a war with them, I'll go like a shot.”...Some undergraduates even insisted that we had been fighting on the wrong side: our natural enemies were the French.\n\n16 CID paper 251-B, 10.7.20, CAB 4/7, TNA.\n\n..the events of the last twenty years have shown that we cannot be free to carry out our main objects which are Indian and Colonial, unless we are safe in Europe, and it will be many years yet before we can free ourselves of responsibility for Europe.\n\n13In discharging this responsibility the relationship with France was pivotal.\n\n15The British Cabinet Secretary, Sir Maurice Hankey, differed. On 25 June 1921 he told Lloyd George,\n\n..that our experience of the past does not lead us to think that she would be more tractable after such a guarantee has been given. The guarantee to France was signed at the end of June, 1919. After that date the French Government was in fact no easier to deal with than it was before. In fact it is not unlikely that France would be more pugnacious than ever. We should constantly be in the dilemma of having to choose between breaking off an Alliance and associating ourselves in a policy utterly distasteful to us and liable to lead to a breach of the peace.\n\n17Arthur Henderson for the Labour Party shared these concerns, writing to Lloyd George on 7 January 1920,\n\n20 Henderson to Lloyd George, 7.1.20, F/27/3/39 LGP.\n\nwe hold most decidedly that a commitment of this kind is unnecessary, since the Covenant of the League of Nations imposes already the obligation to defend the territorial integrity and independence of all its members. Further, although this alliance may be in form defensive, it must have the effect of diminishing the motives which would otherwise incline French policy to courses of prudence and conciliation.\n\nA Channel Tunnel?\n\n30 Undated memorandum endorsed by Curzon, minute 1.5.20, 187042/183192/17 in FO 371/3765, TNA.\n\nThe whole question is dependent upon the stability of friendly relations between France and this country…our relations with France never have been, are not, and probably never will be, sufficiently stable and friendly to justify the construction of a Channel tunnel.\n\n32 CID Paper 96-A in FO 371/3765, TNA. See Alan Sharp “Britain and the Channel Tunnel 1919-1920” in Au (...)\n\nIt may of course be said that the unknown dangers which I fear, may possibly be of a kind which will put an end to our position as an island Power, and make the command of the sea useless as a means of defence. It may be so: but let us wait till it is so, and as long as the ocean remains our friend do not let us deliberately destroy its power to help us.\n\nAn Uneasy Anglo-French Relationship, 1920-1921\n\n25The debates about an Anglo-French pact continued sporadically and inconclusively throughout 1920 and 1921. Meanwhile there were serious pressures on the relationship between the two states left as the main executors of a treaty that neither would have negotiated but for the influence of Woodrow Wilson, whose signature the United States Senate refused to honour. This responsibility would have posed significant challenges even if France and Britain agreed on their goals and the best way to achieve them but they did not. Faced with German failures to fulfil the terms of the treaty, particularly in the sensitive areas of reparations and disarmament, the French tended to believe Germany would not meet its obligations, the British that it could not. The French leaned towards coercion as the best way to encourage the Germans to find the will to comply, the British preferred persuasion and were sympathetic to the idea of treaty revisions. French suggestions that further occupations of German territory would ensure treaty execution fuelled British suspicions about their annexationist ambitions.\n\nThe Price of an Alliance?\n\n30Although the Tory ministers remained remarkably loyal, there was growing pressure from Conservative constituency associations to end the coalition, fearing that Lloyd George’s hopes for ‘fusion’ between his Coalition Liberals and themselves would wreck their party. They disliked the March 1921 Anglo-Soviet trade treaty and the Anglo-Irish treaty of December 1921 partitioning the island between a Free State in the south and six of the nine counties of the historic province of Ulster, which remained part of the United Kingdom. His Egyptian and Indian policies were deeply resented, as was the dismissal of General Dyer by Edwin Montagu, the Liberal Secretary of State for India, after his troops fired, without warning, on an assembly at Amritsar in the Punjab on 13 April 1919, leaving at least 379 Indians dead and over 1,500 wounded. Montagu was a Jew which, given the anti-Semitism prevalent in the Tory right wing, added fuel to the fire.\n\n33Lloyd George knew the French had deep reservations about dealing with the Soviets. The Italian Prime Minister, Francesco Nitti, recorded an earlier attempt to persuade the French premier. Alexandre Millerand.\n\n40 Francesco Nitti, The Decadence of Europe: The Paths of Reconstruction (London, Fisher Unwin, 1923) (...)\n\nDuring the sitting of the Conference of London in 1920, Millerand made a violent attack on the Bolshevik Government, which, he said, was composed of criminals and assassins. At the next meeting, Lloyd George, with subtle irony, had a collection of English writers on the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic period lying on the conference-table before him.\n\n46 Curzon, minute, 29.4.22, C6200/6200/18 in FO 371/7567, TNA.\n\nM. Poincaré is to threaten isolated action..the French Govt. is to behave..either with insolence or treachery in respect of Tangier, Tunis, the Near East etc. etc. but we are going to run around and conclude our Treaty of Guarantee and all will be well.\n\nEt alors...Poincaré!"
