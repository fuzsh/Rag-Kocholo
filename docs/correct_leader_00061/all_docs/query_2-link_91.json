Alexandre Millerand, born February 10, 1859 in Paris and died April 6, 1943 in Versailles, is a French statesman. He was President of the Council from January 20 to September 23, 1920, then President of the Republic from September 23, 1920 to June 11, 1924. Lawyer and journalist for the daily La Justice by Georges Clemenceau, he first became involved with the radicals. He was elected municipal councilor of Paris in 1884 and deputy for the Seine in 1885; constantly re-elected, he sat for 35 years in the Chamber of Deputies. During the Boulangist crisis, he moved away from the radicals, maintaining his desire to revise the constitutional laws of 1875 and his social demands. In the 1890s, having become the main figure of independent socialists, he advocated reformist socialism. From 1899 to 1902, in the Waldeck-Rousseau government, he was Minister of Commerce, Industry, Posts and Telegraphs: first socialist minister in France, he regulated and reduced working hours, guaranteed weekly rest in establishments dependent on the State and voted on a project on workers' pensions. But considered too moderate, he was excluded from the French Socialist Party in 1904. Minister of Public Works in the first Briand cabinet, he had to manage the flooding of the Seine and a major railway workers' strike. He was then Minister of War in the first Poincaré government and in the second Viviani government: he then reversed the liberal measures of his predecessors, supported General Joffre and adopted resolutely nationalist views, thus definitively breaking with the left. In 1919, appointed Commissioner General of the Republic in Strasbourg, he administered the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine to France. After the victory in the 1919 legislative elections of the National Bloc, which brought together the center and right-wing parties supporting the Sacred Union, he became President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs. With a large parliamentary majority, he stood firm against strikes and communism, while passing social measures. He managed the start of the application of the Treaty of Versailles, engaged in the Soviet-Polish and Franco-Syrian wars – which ended in a French victory – and launched the reestablishment of relations with the Vatican. Following the resignation of Paul Deschanel due to illness, Alexandre Millerand was elected President of the Republic against the socialist Gustave Delory. Defending a letter application of constitutional laws, he is quite actively involved in the affairs of the country, contrary to the practice in force under the Third Republic, and continues to call for a constitutional revision aimed at strengthening the prerogatives of the head of the state. But with the legislative elections of 1924, which ended in the victory of the left cartel - opposed to his practice of power -, he was forced to leave the Élysée, almost four years after his election. Wishing to unify the center and right groups (including its most nationalist fringe), he founded the National Republican League, which mainly brings together the PRDS and the Republican Federation. Between 1925 and 1940, he was a senator (of the Seine then of the Orne), but did not find any major office. Warning against Germany's desire for revenge and the possibility of a new major military conflict, he opposed in particular the pacifist ideology, in Vogue at the dawn of the Second World War. Personal situation Origins View of Roche-et-Raucourt (Haute-Saône), where the Millerand family lived. The Millerand family comes from the small town of Roche-et-Raucourt, in Haute-Saône2. The first known ancestor of Alexandre Millerand is Nicolas Millerand (1602-1689), merchant and landowner: “the heritage of this important man from Roche is known thanks to the terrier of 1665-1666: he owns three houses […], three hemp groves of 38 cuts, 80 logs of land (approximately 40 hectares), […] »2. The Millerands, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were among the “good, respected […] families” of the village of Roche(-et-Raucourt)2. However, the Revolution and the Empire led to a downgrading of the Millerand2. Alexandre Millerand's paternal grandfather was a Bougnat and settled in Paris during the Restoration3. On his mother's side, Alexandre Millerand has Alsatian Jewish origins - which will be used against him by his anti-Semitic adversaries during his political careerb,2,5, even if his Jewish mother converted to Catholicism6. Born on February 10, 1859 at 5, boulevard de Strasbourg, then located in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, Étienne Alexandre Millerandc was the son of Jean-François Millerand (1826-1897), a small cloth merchant8,9 working rue de la Jussienne ( 3rd arrondissement), and Mélanie Caen (1835-1917)1011. She was baptized in 1860 at the same time Société de construction des Batignolles, Commander of the Legion of Honor); Alice (1902-1980), remained single; Jacques (1904-1979)20, lawyer, then magistrate, married to Marie-Christine “Miquette” Lazard (daughter of Christian Lazard, partner of the Lazard bank, and granddaughter of Ernest May); Marthe (1909-1975), married to Jean-Paul Alfassa, doctor of law21, grandson of Eugène d'Eichthal. Professional career On May 16, 1881, a month after leaving university, he was sworn in as a lawyer at the Paris Court of Appeal. The following year, having placed in the first twelve in the eloquence competition organized by the Paris bar, he became secretary of the Conference of Bar Lawyers and vice-president of the Molé-Tocqueville Conference14. Such functions are generally considered to be a prelude to entry into Parliament22. Profile caricature of a man with white hair and mustache and thick black eyebrows, wearing glasses, dressed in a lawyer's robe and holding a sheet in his right hand Caricature of Alexandre Millerand during a pleading (Jean Prunière, 1920s). He is close to Georges Laguerre, with whom he pleads in several high-profile trials23. With a cold eloquence similar to that of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, he defended miners in the years 1880-1890, in correctional courts and at assizes, following strikes like those of Montceau-les-Mines, in Decazeville (he pleads thus for Ernest Roche) or to Carmaux24. In their defense, he adopted a sociological approach, emphasizing their difficult living and working conditions, and obtained relatively lenient verdicts25. Although he became a deputy, he continued to practice and had as clients the socialists Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue and Jean Baptiste Clément26. He is also the lawyer for members of the Russian terrorist organization Narodnaïa Volya appearing in criminal court in Paris on July 5, 1890 and some of whom were sentenced to three years in prison. At the same time, in 1882 he began a career as a journalist by participating intermittently in the legal chronicle La Justice, where his political director, Georges Clemenceau, called him because of his resolute opposition to any compromise with moderate republicans. After Laguerre's election as deputy, Alexandre Millerand became the main contributor to the newspaper's legal column, where he expressed his social and anticlerical convictions16. He continued to write for the daily newspaper until 1889, dealing with more varied subjects after his election to the Chamber of Deputies28. Subsequently, he collaborated on La Voix (1889), La Petite République (1893-1898) and La Lanterne (1898-1899)24. He also writes occasionally in the radical regional newspaper Le Petit Troyen29. After an interruption during his functions within the Waldeck-Rousseau government (1899-1902), he resumed his activity as a lawyer, but turned to business law, which allowed him to develop a new network and build up a reputation. personal wealth30. At the outbreak of the Great War, his office had eight colleagues30. He practiced again after his presidency, although pleading less than before, and was elected a member of the council of the Paris Bar Association two weeks after his departure from the Élysée31. Due to his notoriety as a former head of state, he participates in the board of directors of several companies, such as the Grands Magasins de La Samaritaine, gives conferences and writes for French and foreign newspapers, mainly on external issues, notably in the New York Herald Tribune and La Liberté32. Political rise From radicalism to socialism Radical activist and elected official in Paris (1883-1885) He expressed his first political considerations in 1870, when he was indignant at the acquittal of Pierre-Napoléon Bonaparte and was enthusiastic about the proclamation of the Republic. His legal pleadings and his writings in La Justice subsequently placed him among the most left-wing radicals. At the beginning of the 1880s, he joined a radical movement, the Republican League for the revision of the Constitution, of which he became one of the secretaries while Georges Clemenceau was vice-president16. Following the resignation of the moderate deputy Pierre Marmottan, he was campaign secretary for the radical Jehan de Bouteiller in the legislative partial election of May 1883 in the 16th arrondissement of Paris33. But the radical candidate was implicated in financial scandals and had to face a dissident candidacy in the second round, which Alexandre Millerand tried to discredit34. Jehan de Bouteiller was ultimately beaten by 37 votes by the conservative Louis Calla34. This electoral campaign, however, allowed Alexandre Millerand to gain notoriety. Subsequently, he campaigned for municipal autonomy in different countries. With René Viviani, he founded the Seinek Republican Socialist Federation in 1893,77. Alongside Jean Jaurès, he then established himself as the main figure of socialism in France78. Encouraged by their growing electoral power, the different socialist currents are considering an attempt at a common programl,80. On May 30, 1896, after the good scores of the socialist candidates in the municipal elections, he spoke at a large banquet organized at the Porte Dorée: in this speech, known as de Saint-Mandé, he called for the union of the socialists and the development of a common reformist program81,82. This defense of republican socialism arouses concern among moderates, who fear the rallying of the middle classes to its cause78. Although he received the strong support of Jaurès, Alexandre Millerand was not unanimous among the socialists. Jean Allemane criticizes him for being skeptical on the question of the general strike, while Édouard Vaillant opposes the withdrawal in the second round of the socialist candidates who arrived behind another republican83. During the international socialist congress of workers and workers' union chambers of 1896, Millerand and his supporters were outvoted by the French delegation84. Moving away from collectivism and defending the Franco-Russian alliance, he was then suspected by some of his allies of wanting to seduce the middle classes and of establishing a rapprochement with the Republicans located further to the right of the political spectrum83. He gradually lost his ascendancy within the independent socialists to the benefit of Jaurès and did not hesitate to display his hostility towards the revolutionary socialists79. During the legislative elections of 1898, the only candidate in his Parisian constituency, he was re-elected to parliament in the first round with 89% of voters voting and 72% of those registered85. With the defeats of Jules Guesde and Jaurès, Millerand strengthened his position at the head of parliamentary socialism86,87. During the first meeting of the socialist group following the elections, he adopted the proposals formulated in his speech in Saint-Mandé86. He was then elected president of the House Grants Committee88. In the process, he left La Petite République, considering that he no longer had sufficient freedom in the writing of his editorials, and succeeded Aristide Briand as editor-in-chief of La Lanterne, where he defended patriotic socialism86. By calling for the gathering of republican forces from the beginning of 1899, Alexandre Millerand seemed to put aside the project of uniting the socialists in order to favor a dialogue with the radicals89,90. Minister in the Waldeck-Rousseau government (1899-1902) Related article: reduction of working hours in France. On June 23, 1899, after the agreement in principle of the socialist group of the Chamber to ministerial participation, he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau government as Minister of Commerce, Industry, Posts and Telegraphs. This is the first appointment of a socialist figure to a government under the Third Republic91. Although Millerand specifies that his decision does not engage the collective responsibility of the socialists, several of his allies consider this participation in a “bourgeois government” as contrary to the class struggle and denounce the appointment to the Ministry of War of General de Galliffet , nicknamed “the executioner of the Commune”92. The first congress of French socialist organizations, which was held in December 1899 at the Salle Japy, however authorized the principle of government participation in the event of “exceptional circumstances”93.

Alexandre Millerand (c. 1900). If the scope of his ministerial department includes industry, internal trade, customs, the merchant navy, technical, industrial and commercial education or exhibitions, it is on the condition of workers that Alexandre Millerand focuses his action. . In a context of fears of an increase in social conflicts, it broadens the scope of competence of the Labor Office95, sets up a ministerial department responsible for social insurance and welfare94, facilitates workers' access to positions of deputy labor inspectors96 as well as the creation of industrial tribunals96. To avoid parliamentary debates with uncertain outcomes, he issued a series of decrees and circulars, in particular to strengthen the missions of the inspection. August 26, 1914, during the formation of the second Viviani government, shortly after the start of the world war. , Alexandre Millerand returned to the War Ministry, when he once again requested the Foreign Affairs portfolio156. The following month, as part of the government's departure for Bordeaux, his ministry moved to the city's faculty of letters157. For security reasons, he remained there until January 1915, one month longer than the rest of the executive158. Intermediary between the General Headquarters and the political power, Alexandre Millerand leaves the army great freedom of action, essentially relaying the will of General Joffre159. In private, President Poincaré then spoke of a “military dictatorship”160. In September 1914, Millerand satisfied the generalissimo's request to replace the war councils with special war councils, with restricted composition, not conducting investigations and rendering decisions not subject to appealq,162. Joffre also obtained the strengthening of censorship, which led to a temporary suspension of the publication of Clemenceau's newspaper, L'Homme libre161. Nevertheless, especially at the end of the ministry, the Generalissimo had to bow several times, notably during the Battle of the Dardanelles, Millerand seeking to counter the accusations of passivity aimed at him161. At the start of the conflict, when France lacked weapons and manpower, the Minister of War favored 75 mm weapons, asked private companies to provide 100,000 shells per day and recalled workers from the front. to ensure industrial effort158,163. But while production turned out to be insufficient and its management was called into question by a report from Senator Raphaël Milliès-Lacroix, Alexandre Millerand refused to take sanctions against the manufacturers and indicated to the Senate that it was necessary to “sacrifice quality » in favor of “quantity”164. With the emergence of trench warfare, he opted for the development of heavy weaponry, but his orders were considered late and insufficient158,165. If its action in terms of the organization of aeronautics is also criticized, the situation is considered satisfactory for the production of rifles158. Alexandre Millerand rarely goes to combat zones, preferring to sign numerous circulars from Paris161. To increase the number of people at the front, he strengthened controls on \"sneaks\", reviewed the status of reformed soldiers and established commissions of three doctors in place of review boards, which he considered too cumbersome166. It also reduces the delays between the call of an age class and its effective mobilization, and maintains the 1887 and 1888 classes167 in service. While the logistical conditions for the incorporation of the 1915 class were criticized, he took measures in favor of the combatants (relaxation of the leave regime, increase in pay, possibility of advancement without seniority requirements, etc.). )168.

During his first months in government, he did not have to justify himself before the parliamentary committees due to the adjournment of the chambers. Subsequently, he sought to reduce the control of Parliament, which intended to exercise its prerogatives of examination and control over almost all questions related to the armies169,170. Parliamentarians protested that the contracts awarded by the Ministry of War, particularly in terms of supplies, were carried out in a certain haste and resulted in prices that they considered too high161. On the religious question, under pressure from socialists and radicals, Millerand had to reverse his decision to authorize chapels in hospitals and moderate the circular assigning members of the clergy to the army health service, which was seen as a Preferential treatment granted to ecclesiastics161. Also mishandled within the Council of Ministers, the Minister of War was forced to bring back undersecretaries of state171,172. On October 29, 1915, following the resignation of the Viviani ministry, Aristide Briand formed a government of which Alexandre Millerand was not part173. Criticized by left-wing figures for his unwavering support for Joffre, the role of General Baquet at his side, the arms crisis and his lack of transparency, Millerand saw his action praised by the centrist and right-wing press. In Le Figaro, Alfred Capus wrote: “For more than a year, Mr. Millerand has handled this formidable national defense organization with a strength, a precision, a dedication for which all patriots will be eternally grateful to him”174. For his part, Jacques Bainville suggests the idea of saying Following the resignation of the moderate deputy Pierre Marmottan, he was campaign secretary for the radical Jehan de Bouteiller in the legislative partial election of May 1883 in the 16th arrondissement of Paris33. But the radical candidate was implicated in financial scandals and had to face a dissident candidacy in the second round, which Alexandre Millerand tried to discredit34. Jehan de Bouteiller was ultimately beaten by 37 votes by the conservative Louis Calla34. This electoral campaign, however, allowed Alexandre Millerand to gain notoriety.
