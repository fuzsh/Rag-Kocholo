Edouard Herriot, the esteemed politician, is depicted in the office of French president Alexandre Millerand at the iconic Elysee Palace in Paris on June 5, 1924. This image was skillfully drawn by Louis Sabattier, showcasing his talent for capturing the essence of this significant event. The atmosphere in the room seems charged with tension as Herriot prepares to resign from his position just days after this meeting. The expressions on both men's faces hint at the gravity of the situation and the weight of responsibility they carry as leaders of their country during a tumultuous time. As we gaze upon this historical photograph, we are transported back to a pivotal moment in France's political landscape during the Third Republic. The intricate details captured by Sabattier's drawing bring to life the elegance and grandeur of Elysee Palace, serving as a backdrop for these two influential figures making decisions that would shape their nation's future. This image serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and challenges faced by those who hold positions of power, offering us a glimpse into a world where politics and leadership intersect with history.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
