        "text": "Discussion\n\nChanges in blood gas concentrations during storage have been evaluated in many studies under various conditions, hence resulted in different suggestions (19-21). According to our findings, BGA results were clinically acceptable in samples stored at room temperature for up to one hour, unexpectedly. However, contamination with air altered blood gases, especially the pO2, as expected.\n\nThe practice of keeping glass syringes on ice is an old practice to slow down the metabolism and is no longer recommended for plastic syringes (1, 3). The rate of cellular metabolism is much faster in patients with very high leukocytes or platelet counts (3, 22). The cells in the whole blood use glucose and O2, produce CO2, hence decrease the pH and increase lactate due to continued glycolysis. In this study, we used fresh blood samples to demonstrate cell metabolism. And we kept the syringes in the refrigerator in order to ensure homogeneous cooling at the specified degree. The small oxygen molecule (O2) is more vulnerable than larger CO2 molecules to diffuse across the plastic wall (13). The pores of the plastic syringe wall enlarge in the cold due to molecular contraction (23, 24). Cooling the samples causes an increase in Hb’s affinity for oxygen to bind to deoxyhemoglobin, which promotes greater exogenous oxygen flow (24). This might result in the release of oxygen from the Hb when the sample is heated to 37 °C while analysis causes falsely increased pO2 (12, 25).\n\nIn a study by Pretto and Rochford, plastic and glass syringes were compared for their gas preservation capacity (14). Glass syringes were found to be superior to plastic ones in preserving blood. As they observed similar increases in pCO2 accompanying a decrease in pH in both syringe types, they considered that these changes were due to cellular metabolism rather than diffusion through the syringe wall. In this study, we observed increases in pCO2 over time with a corresponding decrease in pH, possibly due to ongoing cell metabolism.\n\nIn an old study by Mahoney et al., 30 min delay in analysis of arterial blood in plastic syringes caused pO2 increases when iced (21). In the current study, at room temperature, pO2 stayed stable for 120 min, however, showed significant increases (from 7.3% to 26.7%) when chilled, beginning from 30 min. We can attribute the increases observed in the pO2 to the diffusion of oxygen through the plastic wall of the syringe and decreases to the continuing metabolism of the cells.\n\nThe lactic acid values are important, especially for critically ill patients which have been shown to correlate with the prognosis in the setting of sepsis (26). Under anaerobic conditions, lactate is the degradation product of the metabolism and in erythrocytes, glycolysis always terminates in lactate. Keeping the plastic syringes at low temperatures increases the gas permeability that causes O2 supply and limit the anaerobic metabolism hence minimizes lactate production. In this study, lactate increased more at room temperature with a concomitant acidosis, and with a corresponding pO2 decrease, and pCO2 increase. As expected, in cooled samples, both with the effect of slowed down of the metabolism and the air diffusion through the syringe wall, lactate production was lesser.\n\nHemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO2) indicates the percentage of the Hb binding sites that actually bind to oxygen molecules, and O2Hb indicates the oxygen carrying form of hemoglobin in relation to the total hemoglobin which is approximately equal to the oxygen saturation in healthy individuals (15). Oxygen saturation is an important variable in determining blood oxygen delivery in the body. In a study by Arbiol et al., where they stored samples in either iced water, at 4-8 °C and at 25 °C with a baseline sO2 > 95%, the samples were found as stable for sO2 for over 60 min (27). Smajić et al. stored plastic syringes at room temperature for 60 min and observed significant decreases in sO2 (-1.24%) (28). In our study, the sO2 changes were clinically insignificant with a baseline > 98%. And no clinically meaningful deviations were observed for O2Hb.\n\nThe partial pressure of oxygen required to achieve 50% hemoglobin saturation is represented as p50, which reflects the hemoglobin oxygen affinity and tissue oxygenation. This parameter is calculated by the blood gas analyser from oxygen tension (pO2) and saturation (sO2). In state of acidosis, p50 increases. In this study, we observed increases in p50, decreases in pH, which can be explained again with the continuing cell metabolism.\n\nSophisticated new blood gas devices made it possible to measure electrolytes and glucose in a short time, along with BGA in emergency and ICU units. Serial blood gas measurements allow serial electrolyte and glucose monitoring. This helps physicians in the diagnosis and monitoring of the blood gas and electrolyte imbalances. In this study, sodium, potassium, and glucose gave clinically acceptable results, irrespective of the storage conditions.\n\nAs expected, samples contaminated with air interfered pO2 quickly, similar to previous studies, and was greater in cold (29, 30). However, blood pH stayed stable for over 90 min in all conditions. The stability of pH might be explained by the tight control and buffer capacity of blood (6). Bicarbonate was stable over two hours, unexpectedly, similar to a study (25). In a study by Toffaletti and McDonnell, adding air showed different effects on pO2 depending on the initial pO2 values even with small amounts of air (20 and 40 µL) (20). The direction of the changes in pO2 was very different with very low (< 9 kPa) and very high (> 24 kPa) initial values.\n\nAs a limitation of our study, for the air contaminated samples, the direction of change would be different according to the initial pO2, however, we did not experiment such extreme values (20). Besides, the results we obtained were for a type of plastic syringe, therefore the ingredients of different types of the syringe wall might affect the permeability variously.\n\nFor good laboratory practices, the laboratory technicians and health personnel have to be educated about the importance of this hardly obtained test material (1, 4). They have to be warned about the air bubbles that should be expelled after withdrawing the sample as soon as possible and to transport without cooling samples.\n\nIn conclusion, correct BGA results are essential, and the arterial sample is precious. Therefore, if immediate analysis cannot be performed, up to one hour, syringes stored at room temperature will give reliable results when care is taken to minimize air within the blood gas specimen."
