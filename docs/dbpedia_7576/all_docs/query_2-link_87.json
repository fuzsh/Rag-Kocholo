        "text": "This post summarizes the July weather in New York, with tips on what to wear, as well as things to do.\n\nAs local tour guides, we know that July is one of the best times for walking tours, because there's usually a lot of great, sunny weather.\n\nAnd I am not just a tour guide. I'm also a retired meteorologist who has found a new way to put my experiences to work.\n\nAverage Temperatures\n\nHow Much Rain?\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nThings to Do in July\n\nThings to Do Any Month\n\nSeasonal Outlook\n\nNYC HOTEL DEALS ON TRIPADVISOR - If you haven't already booked your accommodations.\n\nAVERAGE TEMPERATURES\n\nThe month of July is characterized by warm temperatures, sometimes hot and humid with daytime average high temperature in the low to mid-80s F (26-29 C).\n\nExpect overnight lows mostly in the mid to upper-60s F (17-21 C).\n\nHow Hot Does NYC Get in July?\n\nAbout 6-7 days this month will see afternoon high temperatures at 90 F (32 C) or higher while a few of the cooler nights can dip down into the upper 50s F (14-15 C).\n\nIn the past, July has seen extremes here as high as 106 F (41 C) and as low as 52 F (11 C).\n\nHUMIDITY\n\nHigh temperatures aren't the only thing making NYC feel hot in July. Humidity is arguably more important.\n\nNew York City can get very humid in the summer months, and in July, you can expect a daily average of around 70% humidity.\n\nThis means that the heat index is often much higher than the recorded temperatures and you are likely to feel sweaty outdoors.\n\nNew Yorkers refer to this as muggy weather.\n\nDOES IT RAIN MUCH IN JULY?\n\nAbout 21 days this month will see either sunny skies or at least partly sunny skies.\n\nSome rain or showers can be expected on about 10 days this month, however, only about 3 of these record significant rainfalls of 1/2 inch (13 mm) or more.\n\nMost of the rain this month comes in the form of showers and thunderstorms which can be accompanied by strong gusty winds.\n\nDue to the level of relative humidity, the weather forecast might show potential rain each day, but this doesn't actually happen in reality.\n\nSEASONAL OUTLOOK - June to August 2026 New York City\n\nThere is a 76% chance for normal to above normal temperatures and a 72% chance for normal to above normal rainfall.\n\nWHAT TO WEAR IN JULY\n\nWith warm, humid weather in New York in July, it is best to dress for summer.\n\nWe've made a list below of what to pack when visiting New York in July:\n\nDisclosure: While our recommendations are always unbiased, we may receive a small share of sales through some of the links as an Amazon Affiliate below at no cost to you. See the full text.\n\n1. Light-Weight Summer Clothes\n\nSummer in New York is very warm, so you want to make sure to pack light!\n\nThink cotton tops, shorts, skirts, and summer dresses. Be sure to pack sunscreen as well!\n\n2. Comfortable Shoes\n\nJuly is great for walking tours in New York!\n\nBe sure to pack comfortable shoes like these from Saucony for the long days you'll be spending on your feet.\n\n3. Umbrella\n\nThere will be a number of rain showers in July, so you will want to be prepared.\n\nWhile it's too hot to pack a rain jacket, an umbrella will be perfect, like this compact umbrella by LifeTek.\n\nTHINGS TO DO IN JULY IN NYC\n\nBelow is the top 10 list from our post on things to do in NYC in July.\n\nJuly is one of the best times to visit NYC because warm weather, early sunrise, and late sunsets mean it's a great time for outdoor activities.\n\nSee our full post on things to do any time of year in NYC for even more ideas.\n\nSeveral of the items below are already included for free with the purchase of a tourist attraction concession pass.\n\nSummerstage Concerts in Central Park\n\nSee Moulin Rouge on Broadway\n\nStroll the High Line\n\nWatch a Yankees or Mets Baseball Game\n\nAttend Shakespeare in the Park\n\nSee a Rock Concert\n\nGo to the Beach\n\nEnjoy a Great Meal during Restaurant Week\n\nTake a Free Food Tour\n\nSee the Fireworks on the 4th of July\n\nGet more ideas on our full post of things to do in July.\n\nIf you are coming at the start or end of the month, be sure to check out our guides for June and August and see our full post on things to do any time of year in NYC for even more ideas."
