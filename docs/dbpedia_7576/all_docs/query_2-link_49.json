        "text": "How Far is Split from Zagreb?\n\nWhile planning a vacation to Croatia, many wonder how many miles there are between Zagreb and Split, in the hopes of squeezing both destinations into one fun-filled trip. The good news is that there are only 161 miles between the destinations.\n\nThis means that traveling from Zagreb to Split and vice versa only takes a matter of hours.\n\nHow can you go from Zagreb to Split?\n\nThose looking to travel between the cities will be pleased to hear that there are several different ways to do so. The first option is by train, which takes you on a scenic route through the Velebit Mountains.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to rent a car, which will give you the flexibility to explore stunning landscapes and charming towns in the beautiful Croatian countryside at your own pace along the way.\n\nYou can also catch a flight between Split and Zagreb. Both cities have their own airport and a number of different airlines operating this route. If you’re strapped for time and set on squeezing both destinations into your visit, this might be the best option for you.\n\nHowever, the easiest way to travel from Split to Zagreb is as part of a private tour. This option allows you to tick off both destinations and other magnificent sites along the way, all without having to sort any of the logistics yourself.\n\nFor a truly magical experience, ascend the mountain in the late afternoon and sit hand-in-hand with your new life partner, gazing over the city as a mesmerizing blend of oranges, yellows and reds take over the sky around you.\n\nSometimes, working out the best time to visit each city can help you make your decision. While there is no ‘wrong’ time to visit Split or Zagreb, the weather conditions during each month of the year sometimes align better with the attractions in one destination more than the other.\n\nZagreb\n\nZagreb in Spring (March to May)\n\nSpring is a delightful time to visit Zagreb. The weather is mild, and the city comes to life with colorful blossoms in parks and gardens. You can explore all of the outdoor attractions that the destination has to offer in comfort, such as Ban Jelačić Square and Dolac Market.\n\nAnother benefit to going to Zagreb in Spring is that the city’s vibrant café culture starts to thrive again, after tapering off during the winter months. While temperatures remain pleasant, with highs of 69.8°F, you may also experience the occasional showers.\n\nSummer (June to August)\n\nWith the summer comes the peak tourist season in Zagreb. The city begins to turn up the heat during this period, with average temperatures of 77.9°F. To accompany the sunshine, many outdoor activities and festivals are held.\n\nIn addition, you’ll be able to dine al fresco in peak comfort, soaking up some rays while digging into delicious local dishes. The streets are also busier during this time of year. On the downside, you’ll come across more fellow tourists and higher airfares.\n\nAutumn (September to November)\n\nAs we transition into autumn, the weather stays pleasant, and the number of tourists begins to decrease. With a delightful blend of sunshine and reduced crowds, many consider autumn the ideal time to explore Zagreb.\n\nAnother advantage of visiting the city during this season is the transformation of its parks, including Park Maksimir, which put on a stunning autumnal display, providing picturesque backdrops for photographs. You will also be pleased to hear that prices for accommodations and activities are also slightly lower during these months.\n\nWinter (December to February)\n\nZagreb turns into a winter wonderland during the holiday season. Zagreb’s Christmas Market is said to be one of the best in Europe, featuring festive decorations, ice skating rinks and various holiday events. The city’s cozy cafes and hearty Croatian cuisine provide respite from the cold. While winter in Zagreb is charming, it can be quite chilly, so prepare for colder temperatures if you plan to visit during this time.\n\nSplit\n\nSpring (March to May)\n\nSpring is a fantastic time to visit Split. The weather is pleasantly mild with average figures of around 59 ° F. These comfortable temperatures offer the perfect conditions to discover many of the best things to do in Split, such as visiting Diocletian’s Palace and hiking Marjan Hill.\n\nWhile you may experience the odd rainshower in Spring, they tend to only last for a small portion of the day. This means that they are unlikely to curtail any outdoor activities. One thing to note about visiting in Spring is that sea temperatures can be a little cool towards the beginning of the season. By May, figures rise to 62.6°F, offering brilliant swimming conditions.\n\nSummer (June to August)\n\nSplit comes alive during the Summer.

All of the city’s attractions and restaurants are open for the whole of the summer, so you will have plenty of things to do.\n\nAutumn (September to November)\n\nAutumn is an excellent time to visit Split for those who prefer milder weather and are wanting to beat the crowds. The sea is still warm enough for swimming in September, and you can explore the city’s historic sites comfortably.\n\nPrices for accommodations and flights start to drop during this period.
