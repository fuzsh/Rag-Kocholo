        "text": "Planning a vacation is always fun, the weather conditions will be important to decide when to go to Split Croatia.\n\nThe coastal regions enjoy a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers (average temperature is around 26Â°C/79Â°F) and very mild winters (minimum temperatures are around 4Â°C/39Â°F).\n\nInland parts of Croatia have a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Don’t forget to check current local time in Split when when coming from different time zones. (Canada, Australia, California, China).\n\nWhen is the best time to visit Split from the point of weather conditions? If you are not tied to school holidays, the best time to visit Split Dalmatiain is during the âintermediate periodâ in months of May/June and September/October.\n\nIn these months you can expect pleasant sunny days ideal for swimming and sunbathing, with all the tourist services fully operational but without the crowds.\n\nItâs also the perfect time for outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain-biking, rafting and sea-kayaking. Find out all reasons to visit Split in spring or in winter period!\n\nI do prefer to talk about Split weather on wider geographic scale including the whole Split-Dalmatia County is case you are interested in Dalmatia islands hopping, where the climate conditions are more or less equal.\n\nI really don’t give much importance to official statistics and I rather use my personal experience.\n\nIf you really need to know about Split’s county climate data than the best resource is Wikipedia website.\n\nTo be informed on weather conditions in almost every part of Croatia I recommend Meteorological and Hydrological Service of Croatia (DHMZ). Check the weather webcam in Split to have a weather forecast in real time!\n\nDHMZ website is useful to check sea temperatures and sunrise and sunset day by day along the whole Adriatic coast from Istria to Southern Dalmatia.\n\nSplit Weather Forecast Month By Month\n\nThese data will be of a great help to decide which month or season is the best for visiting Split and its islands.\n\nJanuary is the coldest month, with an average low temperature around 5Â° C (41 Â° F).\n\nJuly is the hottest month with an average temperature around 30 Â° C (86 Â° F) and also the driest with rainfall around 26 mm (1-02 in).\n\nNovember is the wettest with nearly 113 mm (4.45 in) rainfall and nearly 12 rainy days. Snow is rare in Split and particularly on some islands like Hvar. December and January have 1 snowy day on average, while February has 2.\n\nBrowsing through Split weather data another factor is very suggestive. It indicates annual sunshine hours in Split and some islands. Split boasts over 2.633 sunshine hours annually (almost 110 days) while the absolute champion is Hvar island (town) with 2.800 hours (116,66 days).\n\nConsidering all above data, from climatic point, the best months to visit Split town and county islands are May, June, July, August and September. But looking at this data in terms of price, the number of tourists, things look different.\n\nTo plan your holidays in Split or on one of nearby islands, it’s useful to know average travel costs during the year, which are closely linked to the tourist season.\n\nWithout thinking twice I would recommend, late spring or early autumn followed by summer, while winter is good in Christmas time, Carnival in February and March around Easter.\n\nWhen planning your visit in August be ready to face rather chaotic situation in Split and nearby islands. It’s hot, beaches are full.\n\nSplit looks like in a rush hour with countless ferries embarking or disembarking. Don’t try to depart for any island without previous reservation or you may find yourself on the next ferry back.\n\nMy favorite months are May and June (tourist season getting warmed up, prices are affordable, days are getting long and progressively sunny).\n\nSeptember and October is another beneficial period, when the number of visitors significantly reduces but the days are still favorable for swimming or cruising. My swimming season usually starts on 1st of May and ending in late October."
