        "text": "Although Croatia is a small country, there are two climates. The continental climate prevails in the inner parts of the country. Coast and islands have a typical Mediterranean climate.\n\nIn this blog, we will focus on the weather conditions in the coastal parts of Croatia, from Dalmatia to Kvarner and Istria.\n\nAir Temperature in Croatia\n\nIn general, Croatia has warm and dry summers and pleasant winters. There are no extreme weather differences and temperatures are moderate all year round. Average temperatures vary from 5 to 10° C (41 - 50 ° F) in winter, and from 26 to 30° C (79 - 86° F) in summer.\n\nThe coldest month is January. But even then, the temperature doesn’t go below 0° C (32° F). On the other hand, the hottest month is July. Days are hot with balmy evenings, with the average maximum going up to 31° C (88° F).\n\nTo sum it up, pack light and cool clothing if you’re traveling for a vacation in one of our Croatian villas.\n\nWeather in Dubrovnik (South Dalmatia) by Month\n\nDubrovnik, South Dalmatia - Average air temperature in ° C by month\n\nWeather in Split (Central Dalmatia) by Month\n\nSplit, Central Dalmatia - Average air temperature in ° C by month\n\nWeather in Zadar (North Dalmatia) by Month\n\nZadar, North Dalmatia - Average air temperature in ° C by month\n\nWeather in Pula (Istria) by Month\n\nPula, Istria - Average air temperature in ° C by month\n\nSea Temperatures in Croatia\n\nThe Adriatic Sea is beautiful, clear, and warm. It’s perfect for swimming all summer long. The swimming season opens in mid-June. Needless to say, most locals are still at the beach in September.\n\nSea temperature ranges from 12° C (54° F) in February to 25° C (77° F) in August. It depends on your destination as well. The sea is warmer in Dalmatia which is in the south compared to Istria and Kvarner in the north.\n\nSea Temperature in Dubrovnik (South Dalmatia)\n\nDubrovnik, South Dalmatia - Average sea temperature in ° C by month\n\nSea Temperature in Split (Central Dalmatia)\n\nSplit, Central Dalmatia - Average sea temperature in ° C by month\n\nSea Temperature in Zadar (North Dalmatia)\n\nZadar, North Dalmatia - Average sea temperature in ° C by month\n\nSea Temperature in Pula, Istria\n\nPula, Istria - Average sea temperature in ° C by month\n\nSun, Rain, and Snow in Croatia\n\nThanks to its Mediterranean climate, Croatia is a very sunny country. It has about 2.700 sunny hours yearly, significantly more than most European countries. However, rain is common in fall. Rain showers usually start in late September. The rainiest month is November. Nevertheless, there are numerous activities you can try in the autumn or even in winter time.\n\nTypical Autumn activity in Croatia - Visiting National Park Plitvice Lakes\n\nIn coastal Croatia, snow is rare. You can only see it every few years, it’s very light and doesn’t last long.\n\nWinds in Croatia\n\nWinds are important components of the coastal climate. If you’re planning island-hopping, you should look at the wind forecast before booking a boat.\n\nLuxury Boat tour in Croatia\n\nYou should know the following three winds: Bura, Jugo, and Maestral.\n\nBurais a north-east cold and dry wind. It blows from the mainland in sudden and powerful gusts. Bura brings dry air and cooler temperatures. Since it’s often unpredictable, avoid going to the sea during Bura.\n\nJugois most frequent in Dalmatia. It comes from the south-east toward the mainland. Jugo is most common in autumn and winter. It brings warm air with low pressure, clouds, and rain, so often locals blame their bad mood on “južina”. Unlike Bura, Jugo is very steady and predictable.\n\nFinally, Maestralis a pleasant summer wind. It blows from the sea, usually in the afternoon, and brings much-needed refreshment in the hot summer months.\n\nWindsurfing activity on Peljesac from pixabay.com\n\nWhat is the Best Time to Visit Croatia?\n\nBecause the temperatures are moderate, you can visit Croatia all year round. However, the weather in Croatia is the best from May to September so that time is the most popular.\n\nThink about your preferences before choosing a time to travel to Croatia. Is it important for you to go swimming, snorkeling, and trying out water sports? Do you prefer fewer crowds? There are many factors to consider.\n\nDiving in Croatia\n\nWeather in High Season in Croatia\n\nThe high season in Croatia lasts from late June to early September. The weather in Croatia from late June to early September is the warmest, and the chances of rain are extremely low. It’s definitely the most fun time to be in Croatia, but expect all popular tourist sites to be crowded with people.\n\nDubrovnik beach Banje in High season\n\nWeather in Shoulder Season in Croatia\n\nDon’t write off the shoulder season for your vacation in Croatia. From mid-May to June and from September to early October you can get an incredible mix of good weather and temperatures in Croatia and fewer crowds. It’s not completely empty, though. On weekends, crowds consist of mostly locals enjoying their time off.\n\nWine and Dine Tour in Dalmatia\n\nWeather in Off-season in Croatia\n\nWhat if you visit Croatia in the off-season? From mid-October to mid-May, days are shorter. Weather in Croatia from mid-October to mid-May can be cool and dreary, but it’s still warmer than most European countries.\n\nAdvent in Zagreb"
