        "text": "When is the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nThe best time to visit Croatia is during the summer months, from June to September, when sunlight is plentiful and temperatures are warm, between 66°F and 86°F. These conditions are ideal for boating and swimming in the blue waters around the islands.\n\nThe cooler conditions of April, May and October lend themselves to a wide range of other outdoor activities, from hiking to kayaking.\n\nIn November to March, Croatia’s winter, you can focus on Zagreb or Split when they’re at their quietest and most relaxed.\n\nCreating tailor-made tours for over 25 years\n\nMonth-by-month guide for traveling in Croatia\n\nVisiting Croatia in November - April\n\nAs winter begins in Croatia, many island hotels close for the season to make their refurbishments. But, although the beaches and boat trips are off-limits, you’ll still find plenty of cultural experiences, and those hotels that stay open offer exceptional value. The winter months also present a great opportunity to enjoy the country almost exclusively with the locals.\n\nEvents & Festivals\n\nCarnival (January 17): Costumes ranging from medieval garb to futuristic visions are on display at this international festival celebrated in various Croatian cities, most notably Dubrovnik and Rijeka. Parades take place next to street parties, food stalls and sporting competitions.\n\nFeast of Saint Blaise (February 2): Dubrovnik pays tribute to its patron saint with a day of music, parades and festivities.\n\nEaster (March/April) is celebrated throughout the country with parades and traditional costumes, as well as decorated pisanica eggs.\n\nVisiting Croatia in May - June\n\nAs spring begins, so does the visitor season, with temperatures rising throughout the country. With little rain and long daylight hours, this is an excellent time to visit Croatia to take advantage of fewer crowds and ideal hiking conditions.\n\nEvents & Festivals\n\nSaint Domnius Day on May 7 sees Split celebrate its patron saint with a daytime procession through the streets and promenade, followed by traditional klapa music, a rowing contest and a street fair throughout the afternoon and evening.\n\nStatehood Day on June 25 marks the date Croatia claimed independence from Yugoslavia with celebrations across the country, ranging from cultural events to lively street parties and live music.\n\nVisiting Croatia in July - August\n\nThe summer is peak season in Croatia, as visitors and locals alike enjoy the dry, hot weather. Outdoor venues host music, food and cultural events on a weekly basis, offering an entertaining and lively experience. This time of year also brings larger crowds, longer lines and increased prices at most hotels.\n\nEvents & Festivals\n\nZagreb’s International Folklore Festival in July celebrates traditional Croatian culture and customs through music, dance and theater, drawing visitors from across the world.\n\nThe Alka in the town of Sinj is held on the first Sunday of August — a uniquely Croatian festival celebrating a military victory over Ottoman forces in 1715 in which horsemen in full costume compete to lance a small metal ring for the accolade of top knight.\n\nNight of the Full Moon in Zadar (July/August): The waterfront promenade in Zadar is illuminated with torches and candles in this festival of regional culture and food.\n\nThe International Puppet Theatre Festival takes place in Zagreb at the end of August or beginning of September, when professional puppeteers converge to show off their mastery in the artform.\n\nVisiting Croatia in September - October\n\nThe temperatures begin to recede during September and October, when the summer break has also come to an end. These months offer you great value with reduced crowds, enjoyable weather and plenty of cultural events taking place throughout the country. Most hotels and boat operators on the islands remain open until the end of October, and locals and visitors enjoy the quieter beach atmosphere.\n\nEvents & Festivals\n\nThe International Puppet Theatre Festival takes place in Zagreb at the end of August or beginning of September, when professional puppeteers converge to show off their mastery in the artform.\n\nNights of Diocletian (September) in Split is a weekend of Roman re-enactments where toga-clad performers pay their respects to the city’s ancient history in addition to parades, street food and live music.\n\nTruffle Days (September/October): Each autumn, the small Istrian town of Livade celebrates the local delicacy, the truffle, over 10 weekends with cooking contests, demonstrations and tastings.\n\nCroatia Climate Guide\n\nDestination Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Dubrovnik 45°F 6\" 48°F 5\" 54°F 5\" 61°F 4\" 70°F 3\" 77°F 3\" 82°F 2\" 82°F 2\" 75°F 4\" 66°F 5\" 55°F 7\" 46°F 7\" Hvar 48°F 4\" 50°F 3\" 55°F 3\" 63°F 3\" 70°F 2\" 77°F 2\" 82°F 1\" 82°F 2\" 77°F 3\" 68°F 4\" 59°F 4\" 52°F 5\" Korčula 50°F 4\" 52°F 4\" 55°F 3\" 63°F 3\" 72°F 2\" 79°F 2\" 84°F 1\" 82°F 2\" 77°F 3\" 68°F 4\" 59°F 5\" 52°F 5\" Plitvice Lakes 34°F 4\" 37°F 4\" 46°F 5\" 54°F 5\" 63°F 5\" 70°F 5\" 73°F 4\" 73°F 5\" 66°F 5\" 57°F 5\" 46°F 7\" 37°F 6\" Rovinj 46°F 3\" 50°F 3\" 55°F 3\" 63°F 3\" 70°F 3\" 77°F 3\" 82°F 2\" 82°F 3\" 75°F 4\" 66°F 4\" 55°F 4\" 50°F 3\" Šibenik 48°F 3\" 50°F 3\" 57°F 3\" 64°F 3\" 72°F 2\" 79°F 2\" 84°F 2\" 84°F 2\" 77°F 3\" 68°F 4\" 59°F 5\" 50°F 4\" Šolta 52°F 3\" 54°F 3\" 57°F 3\" 64°F 2\" 72°F 2\" 79°F 2\" 86°F 1\" 84°F 2\" 79°F 3\" 70°F 3\" 61°F 4\" 54°F 4\" Split 46°F 4\" 50°F 3\" 54°F 4\" 61°F 3\" 70°F 3\" 77°F 3\" 82°F 2\" 82°F 3\" 77°F 3\" 66°F 4\" 57°F 5\" 50°F 5\" Zagreb 37°F 4\" 43°F 3\" 52°F 4\" 63°F 3\" 70°F 4\" 75°F 4\" 79°F 4\" 77°F 4\" 72°F 4\" 61°F 4\" 48°F 4\" 39°F 4\"\n\nWhy travel with Audley?\n\n100% tailor-made tours\n\nFully protected travel\n\nEstablished for over 25 years\n\n98% of our clients would recommend us\n\nRequest our brochure\n\nCovering all seven continents, The World Your Way shows you how you can see the world with us.
