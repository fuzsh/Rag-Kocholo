The water starts to sparkle in shades of sapphire and emerald when it is set in opposition to a stunning white pebble beach.\n\nThere are rocky and sandy stretches as well that are ideal for idle days spent lying around and reading your favorite novels. If this sounds too resting and comforting, you can indulge in water-based activities such as diving, kayaking, snorkeling, sailing and windsurfing.\n\nIn short, Croatia In June is a favorable time to visit and enjoy a refreshing beach vacation. You will definitely enjoy the European beach atmosphere!\n\nWeather In Croatia In June\n\nImage Source\n\nCroatia is one of the sunniest spots in Europe.
