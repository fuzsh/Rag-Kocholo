        "text": "Overseas travel is easier than ever. Low airfares drive experiential consumption and even middle-class American families and students can afford to splurge on an international trip every once in a while.\n\nThe social effects will be mixed — “overtourism” is a problem in some locales — but several developments will make American travel even more common the future. The rest of the world is becoming more accessible on several dimensions.\n\nThe Internet’s reach accelerates media and design trends and local tastes will increasingly give way to global tastes. As one travel editor recently remarked,\n\nToday’s trends circle the world with viral efficiency, borne by ever growing numbers of travellers but more importantly by Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and Tumblr.\n\nAnother ancillary benefit (for Americans) of the Internet is that it’s helped make English the lingua franca in much of the world. Supersonic air travel will make it more convenient to jetset across the world and eVTOL will make travel between cities less painful. Further, many telecommuters will take advantage of real estate arbitrage, whereby a worker for a Chicago startup can have Chicago wages and Peoria (or Phnom Penh) home prices.\n\nAll of these trends suggest Americans will travel and live overseas more frequently, searching for authenticity and comfort.\n\nThis got me thinking: Where can Americans travel to find a similar climate but a totally different culture? Taking a page from Nolan Gray’s map of global cities where the climate is comfortable year round, I used climate information for 30 national capitols and global cities and matched them as close as possible with 30 US “climate sister cities.” A climate sister city is one that shares, within a couple degrees Fahrenheit, the same annual range of average high temperatures.\n\nFor instance, in Washington, DC the average daytime highs peak in July at 88 degrees and fall every month until January, when the average daytime high is 43 degrees. The range for DC, then, is 88 to 43 degrees. After some search, I found that DC’s climate sister city is Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan (range: 87° to 44°).\n\nUsing daytime highs seems like the decent proxy for climate similarity. Some caveats: This method doesn’t account for differences in precipitation, humidity, altitude, or sunlight hours, which can make seemingly similar cities feel very different. I limited my non-US sample to national capitals and global cities. In some cases I probably could have found a town or village somewhere in the world with a closer climate resemblance, but a comparison with major international cities seemed more interesting.\n\nSome results surprised me. The climate in the eastern half of the US resembles two areas most: central Europe and east Asia. So, for instance, Raleigh (90° to 51°) has a climate sister city in Kyoto, Japan. Chicago’s (84° to 31°) range is nearly identical to Pyongyang, North Korea. And Portland, Maine’s (76° to 33°) sister city is Warsaw, Poland.\n\nWhile doing this, I found that almost no capital city or major global city had a climate like that found in America’s Deep South or Great Plains.\n\nSome intriguing pairs:\n\nNew York City (84° to 38°) and Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nPortland, Oregon (81° to 46°) and Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nDenver (88° to 43°) and Tbilisi, Georgia.\n\nPhoenix (106° to 66°) and Baghdad, Iraq.\n\nOthers have noted the many cultural and geological similarities between San Francisco and Wellington, New Zealand. Funny enough, I found that they are climate twins as well.\n\nOn the map, the city pairings go both ways. Many non-Americans likely have little intuition about how they should pack, say, for a roadtrip across the Midwest in April. This map might help.\n\nFor me, knowing that Moscow’s climate resembles Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, a place I’ve visited, is more enlightening than reading a dozen travel blogs. Further, the placement of Beijing and Bucharest near Cincinnati and Columbus — climate-wise — is jarring but it makes the world seem smaller."
