        "text": "February in Croatia\n\nFebruary is another winter month with slightly warmer temperatures than January, although it’s certainly still chilly at around 9°C (48.2°F) on the coast. Towards the end of the month the temperatures can start to climb marginally with a hint of spring on the horizon. You could expect around 11 or 12 days of rain in Split during the month of February, its also the month to visit to witness the annual sailing regatta.\n\nAugust in Croatia\n\nAugust is another hot summer month, very similar to July in terms of temperatures, although it can be ever so slightly cooler at around 28°C (82.4°F). You can visit Plitvice Lakes to cool down in August, as the temperatures inland feel a little more comfortable at around 23°C (73.4°F). At this peak travel time it can feel very busy in the main cities such as Split and Dubrovnik so now is a great time to visit lesser-known spots such as Rovinj.\n\nNovember in Croatia\n\nTemperatures drop again in November and the rainfall starts to significantly increase. In some areas such as Dubrovnik and Zagreb this is the wettest month of the year. There’s a wintery feeling in the air but Split, Hvar and Zadar stay mild at around 16°C (60.8°F). Overall, the north, south and inland divide becomes more noticeable in November in terms of temperatures with the south feelling mild and the northern and inland areas feeling colder.\n\nThe best time to travel to Croatia’s beaches is during the peak summer months of July and August. Summer in Croatia means the sunshine is glorious and the water temperatures can reach a very comfortable 25°C (77°F). It’s important to remember that July and August can get very busy, and hot. To avoid the crowds and peak temperatures June and September can confidently be considered as alternative months to enjoy beach activities.\n\nCroatia’s coastline is dominated by idyllic rocky swimming coves and pebbly beaches, and it’s this geology that makes the waters here so stunning; crystal clear and sparkling. There’s a long list of stunning sandy beaches as well as stone ones. We love the long stretches of sand on the Croatian islands of Hvar and Korčula. The best time to visit Hvar is between June and September, to explore expanses of white sandy beaches and wander the historical highlights in the warm, dry weather.\n\nThere’s hundreds of protected natural areas in Croatia, displaying the country’s outstanding beauty and natural diversity. By setting out on hikes, bikes, boat trips and scenic tours you can find the cascading waterfalls of Krka National Park, dramatic canyons in Paklenica National Park and sail the 14 stunning islands that make up Brijuni National Park.\n\nThe best time to visit Croatia’s national parks is March to June and September and October. During Croatia’s spring, March and April, temperatures are perfect for hikes as it’s not too hot. By early summer, May and June, you can hike in shorts and a t- shirt, enjoying the warmer temperatures. The spectacular burning orange and bright yellows of the autumn (late September and October) leaves make this time of year a truly beautiful time to explore the national parks while temperatures remain warm.\n\nThe best time to visit Plitvice National Park, situated further inland than Croatia’s other 5 national parks, is between May and September, when temperatures are at their warmest. It’s cooler here than the coastal areas and even during the peak summer months of July and August, while the Dalmation coast swelters at 30°C (86°F), Plitvice National Park stays closer to 20°C (68°F).\n\nCroatia's waters are peppered with hundreds of islands. Some are remote, rugged and pristine, while others are full of culture with historical towns and pretty ports. These islands, along with the stunning mainland coast, twinkling waters and calm conditions, make Croatia a wonderful place to go sailing and island hopping on private, luxury yachts.\n\nThe best time to go sailing in Croatia is the summer season of July and August for optimum, sunny conditions and warm water temperatures – perfect for jumping off the boat and swimming. The waters, islands and coastal hubs will be busy at this time so June can be a lovely alternative month to sail and avoid busy crowds. In September the winds start to pick up for sailing conditions that are a little more exciting.\n\nMost of Croatia’s cultural highlights and cities are year round destinations. Having said that, for cities on the Dalmation coast such as Dubrovnik it’s best to avoid the peak summer months of July and August. The best time to visit Split is May to June and September and October, avoiding peak summer. By skipping Croatia’s hot summer months you can avoid the intense heat and also avoid the cruise ship crowds that can make the pretty little city feel rather congested.\n\nExploring Croatia’s history and culture is an enriching way to get to know the country and its people. There’s no shortage of historic highlights to visit with Roman ruins in Pula and Split, mediaeval architecture in Dubrovnik, and the foodie scene in Zagreb is not to be missed. The best time to visit Zagreb is between June and September, always bearing in mind that July and August will be warmest and busiest. And, the best time to visit Split is May to June and September and October, avoiding the hot and busy summer season of July and August."
