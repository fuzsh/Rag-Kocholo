        "text": "Croatia has vibrant cities, tumbling waterfalls and rolling vineyards.\n\nBut most visitors are here for its 1800km (1120 miles) coastline, which tumbles down the Adriatic like a glorious, half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Here you’ll find idyllic coves, sophisticated ports and ferries that glide from island to island.\n\nChoosing the best time to go to Croatia depends on what you want from your visit. High season brings high temperatures and a party vibe, particularly on the Dalmatian Coast, home to highlights like walled Dubrovnik, its hip cousin Split, and Hvar Town’s classy waterfront. Shoulder season is quieter, and great for hiking and watersports, while winter lets you experience culture and festivals at off-season prices in the capital, Zagreb.\n\nThe south of Croatia is a little warmer than the north, but the main difference in temperature is between the coast and the interior. By the sea, summers are warm and winters relatively mild, while in the interior, temperatures are more continental, with slightly warmer summer temperatures and colder winters.\n\nOur guide to what's happening throughout the year in Croatia will help you plan the perfect vacation for your needs.\n\nJune to August’s high season is the hottest time to visit\n\nCroatia’s tourism peaks between June and August, when the Adriatic’s warm waters charm countless visitors. There are boat parties and medieval fairs, the booze flows freely, and the smarter resorts fill with yachters. It’s great fun, though afternoons are roasting hot, the lines at attractions are at their longest, and accommodation costs rise. Inland, temperatures are higher, but crowds are less noticeable and Zagreb empties as locals head for the coast.\n\nJune is the quietest month of high season, but with clear skies, music festivals and the promise of early summer, it's a strong contender for Croatia’s best month. Ferries move on to their summer schedule, which makes heading out to islands such as pristine Cres, happening Hvar and forested Mljet a breeze. The cities are buzzing, and the LGBTIQ+ community lights up the streets during Zagreb Pride.\n\nVisitor numbers really ramp up come July – you'll need to arrange accommodation well in advance and work harder to find a sunbathing spot. If the bustle gets too much, try touring the quieter Kornati Islands, hopping on a sea kayak from Dubrovnik, or exploring the vineyards and hills of the interior. The Dubrovnik Summer Festival kicks off in early July, and the International Folklore Festival brings a celebration of traditional culture to Zagreb.\n\nThe sea is warmest in August, beach bars hum with revelers, Zagreb empties out and festivals salute high summer. Sonus is a techno party on Pag, Špancirfest brings music and culture to Varaždin, there’s a fair dating back to Venetian times on Krk, and jousting in Sinj. Bookings are essential everywhere on the coast – festival-goers who try and make do with a tent will swelter.\n\nMay and September to October have sunshine and fewer crowds\n\nLate spring and early fall are arguably the best times to visit Croatia. Sea temperatures are pleasant, and there’s plenty of sunshine, but the country’s pebble beaches and rocky coves are relatively quiet. With endless still seas, May and September are great times to sail in Croatia. Onshore, these are the best times to cycle, hike or visit the national parks. Better still, accommodations are also easier to come by than in high season.\n\nThe resort towns are warming up for the summer in May, making this a splendid month to wander squares and promenades and take short dips in the cool sea. Accommodation prices are lower, and bays and coves that are packed in summer have a tranquil feel. Rafting on the Cetina River or the Zrmanja (just east of Zadar) is also a highlight. The summer party season starts to gear up at the Sea Star Festival.\n\nThings start to quiet down a little in September after a hectic summer season, but there are still plenty of ferries and cultural events to transport body and soul. This is another great time for a Dalmatian beach trip, while truffle season comes to Istria.\n\nBy October, Croatia is in shoulder season proper, with kids back in school and some ferry services and hotels closing over the course of the month. The coast is fairly warm with cool evenings and a mellow vibe, and you can still get anywhere and do just about anything, whether it's feeling tranquil on the islands or exploring Dubrovnik’s walls.\n\nAccommodations are cheapest from November to April\n\nThere’s a reason the crowds stay away between November and April. The interior can be freezing, and while the coast is milder, it’s still affected by the bura wind that whips across the European plain, canceling ferries and snatching hats off heads. But if you’re here for food and culture, you can still have a fine time. Rates at hotels and other accommodations are at their lowest, and you’ll be sharing the galleries and backstreets with locals.\n\nTemperatures can still be pleasant in November, but hotels and restaurants on the coast may be closed, and the waters are chilly. Instead, treat any sunshine as a bonus, use the lower prices and shorter lines to tour cultural sights, celebrate the silver screen at the Zagreb Film Festival and watch as the last leaves (and potentially the first snow) fall.\n\nThere's no way to sugarcoat it – December is cold, many tourist businesses are shut, and snow settles on high ground. It’s a good time to experience Dubrovnik's local life: bars and galleries are open, while the run-up to Christmas brings mulled wine and DJ sets to those prepared to brave the winter streets.\n\nThe mercury is still low in January, so why not stay indoors and discover Zagreb’s lively cafes, impressive galleries and museums – and you can get a late-night culture fix at the annual Night of Museums. Sljeme (near Zagreb) or Platak (near the coastal hub of Rijeka) offer reasonable skiing.\n\nThe days get a little longer in February, but tourists are rare, and accommodations remain heavily discounted. It’s an intriguing time to tour the coast – focus on sights like Trogir’s richly carved cathedral rather than the beaches. Rijeka’s carnival is Croatia’s biggest and wildest, with a costume parade, bell-ringing and bands. Brighter, drier weather makes March a good bet for mixing visits to churches and galleries with outdoor exploration. You can hike along the coast or hills, or take in the Krka and Plitvice national parks, where wooded slopes wind between lakes and waterfalls that thunder with meltwater.\n\nThe sea hasn’t yet warmed up in April, but trees are bright with blossom and sunshine is never far away – try Istria’s hill towns (where asparagus season is in full flow) or the Samobor Hills near Zagreb. Parades liven up many towns over Easter and music fills every corner of Zagreb at the Music Biennale.\n\nJanuary\n\nNew Year’s Concert, Dubrovnik.\n\nDubrovnik ushers in the new year with a traditional annual concert by the Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra on the Stradun at noon.\n\nInternational Percussion Ensemble Week, Bjelovar.\n\nBjelovar resonates to the rhythms of percussion instruments during this three-day festival featuring ensembles from across Croatia, Europe and further afield.\n\nMuseum Night, various cities.\n\nOn the evening of the last Friday in January, museums across Croatia throw open their doors to visitors free of charge.\n\nFebruary\n\nFeast of St Blaise, Dubrovnik.\n\nDubrovnik’s patron saint is celebrated with much pomp on February 3rd with a procession of the saint’s relics through the city streets and other ceremonial rituals recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\nRijeka Carnival, Rijeka.\n\nOn the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday, Rijeka hosts Croatia’s biggest carnival with a grand colorful parade.\n\nSplit Marathon, Split.\n\nOn the last weekend in February, running enthusiasts flock to Split to join in a 5k or 10k (3-mile or 6-mile) race starting from the seaside promenade through the streets of the old town and forested Marjan Park.\n\nMarch\n\nOyster Festival, Mali Ston.\n\nThe Pelješac peninsula’s local shellfish specialty has its own festival in March when restaurants serve up fresh platters of oysters accompanied by crisp Pelješac wines.\n\nLife on Mars Trail Race, Pag.\n\nAvid trekkers can explore Pag Island’s stark landscapes via three different trails of varying difficulty, including a 100m-long (328ft) Via Ferrata trail for climbers.\n\nZagreb Festival of Lights, Zagreb.\n\nLight installations illuminate the capital’s upper and lower towns during this five-day festival combining art, design, architecture and spectacle.\n\nApril\n\nWeekend Food Festival, Rovinj.\n\nLovers of fine food and wine come together for three days to explore Croatian gastronomy via masterclasses and gala dinners with top chefs.\n\nMusic Biennale Zagreb, Zagreb.\n\nEvery two years Croatia’s biggest contemporary music festival draws lovers of melody with an eclectic program of contemporary opera, jazz, electronic music, chamber ensembles, symphony orchestras, as well as multimedia installations and contemporary dance.\n\nIstria 100, Istria.\n\nThis annual trail race across Istria’s sublime landscapes draws runners from around the world who can choose from five scenic routes of different lengths and difficulty levels.\n\nMay\n\nSea Star Festival, Umag.\n\nThis four-day beachside music festival is one of Croatia’s biggest with an eclectic lineup of some of the top names in electronic, techno, and trap music.\n\nSudajma, Split.\n\nSplit celebrates its patron saint, St Domnius, on May 7th with a procession along the seaside promenade, open-air concerts, and a grand fireworks display.\n\nSpring Procession, Gorjani.\n\nOn Pentecost Sunday girls dressed in colorful traditional costumes sing and dance in a springtime procession through the village of Gorjani near the town of Đakovo.\n\nJune\n\nZagreb Pride, Zagreb.\n\nOn the second Saturday of every June, the capital’s LGBTIQ+ community takes over the streets with a colorful march and street celebration.\n\nInternational Children’s Festival, Šibenik.\n\nChildren are at the center of this week-long event filled with music, dance, theater, craft workshops, film, puppets and parades.\n\nSword Dance Festival, Korčula.\n\nStarting in June and continuing until September, visitors to Korčula island can witness performances of Moreška, a 17th-century mock battle tradition performed with swords by costumed participants.\n\nJuly\n\nZagreb International Folklore Festival, Zagreb.\n\nPerformers from across Croatia and around the world gather in Zagreb to present concerts and performances, as well as workshops on folkloric traditions.\n\nDubrovnik Summer Festival, Dubrovnik.\n\nIn 2024, this cultural festival will celebrate its 75th year with 47 days of theater productions, concerts, and dance and folklore performances.\n\nPula Film Festival, Pula.\n\nOver nine days every July, Pula’s first-century Roman amphitheater as well as other venues across the city host Croatia’s oldest film festival.\n\nAugust\n\nSinjska Alka, Sinj.\n\nOn the first Sunday of August, the 1715 victory over Turkish invaders is commemorated with a series of games played by costumed knights on horseback.
