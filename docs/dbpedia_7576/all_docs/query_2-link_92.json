        "text": "Croatia is one of the most beautiful Balkan countries to visit. It has a pleasant Mediterranean climate for most of the year. The 2000 km of coastline and an array of beautiful islands give you enough options for sun, sea and sand. For the culturally inclined, there are lovely old towns of Split and Dubrovnik to walk around. Not to miss out on the picturesque Plitvice National Park.\n\nWe went for a 2-week trip to Croatia and Slovenia in early June. Croatia weather in June was pleasant. It was also less crowded than in the summer months of July and August which are high season and can be very hot in the afternoons. If you are looking for weather, travel tips, best places to visit, things to do in Croatia in June, you have come to the right place.\n\nIt is a small country. And yet, we had to skip the Istrian peninsula during our 15-day holiday. There is so much to experience. The warmth and genuine hospitality of Croatians makes it decidedly suitable and enjoyable for families.\n\nWeather in Croatia in June\n\nIn June, Croatia enjoys comfortable temperatures throughout the country. The coastal regions, including popular destinations boast average daily temperatures ranging from 23°C to 28°C. Dubrovnik weather in June is comfortable, perfect for outdoor activities and enjoying the stunning coastline.\n\nThe hours of sunshine remain pretty constant, with an average of about 15 hours per day. In June, the sea temperatures climb above 20 degrees and become nice for swimming. But for as Asian like me, it was still cold to swim. And I found it quite chilly on my dive beyond 10-15 meters even in a wetsuit.\n\nWhat to wear in Croatia in June\n\nThe weather is pleasant to warm throughout the country in June. It is best to pack lightweight clothing for your trip.\n\nYou should wear breathable fabrics like cotton and linen to be comfortable. Carry enough summer dresses and T-shirts / shorts for the day. For city sightseeing and national parks, make sure to carry comfortable walking shoes. Do pack a few dresses for evening wear, but nothing fancy is needed.\n\nDon’t forget your swimsuit and beachwear for the beaches – especially if you are going to a Croatian island. Sunglasses and sunscreen are essential for sun protection, an integral part of beach vacation packing checklist. Croatian beaches are rocky, so taking water shoes is helpful.\n\nWhat to expect regarding crowds and cost\n\nJuly and August is peak season in Croatia. These months are when most of the cruise ships are docked in ports. The crowds are unbearable in popular spots like Dubrovnik old town, Split and Plitvice Lakes. The hotel prices match the high demand.\n\nHigh season starts in June itself in the Dalmatian coast and continues until September. We found the crowds manageable in early June. You can expect an uptick in prices as all hotels and restaurants are open for business.\n\nShoulder season in Croatia is spring (April to May) and autumn (late September to October). During this time you have decent prices, few crowds, and zero cruise ships.\n\nBest places to visit in Croatia in June\n\nAll of the country is open for exploring in June. The problem for you would be what to include and what to leave out in your Croatian itinerary.\n\nThe Adriatic Sea is warm, the sun is shining, and the days are long, making June a great time to explore the Dalmatian coast and its many islands. The weather is good for sunbathing, and the sea is finally warm enough for swimming and all other water-related activities (kayaking, sailing, snorkelling).\n\nYou can make either Split or Dubrovnik as your base for few days. These 2 cities are well connected to several Croatian islands like Brac, Korcula, Hvar, Mljet via ferry routes. After exploring Split in a day or two, it can be used as a base for day trips to Plitvice or Krka national park. With access to a long coastline across the Adriatic Sea and about a 1000 islands, your itinerary is bound to take you off the mainland.\n\nAdd a national park like Plitvice Lakes or Krka definitely on your Croatia summer itinerary. For those interested in hiking, cliff-enclosed gorges and striking ridge-top trails in the Northern Velebit and the Paklenica national parks. Our hiking was limited to the time spent at Plitvice Lakes and climbing the walls at Ston on our way to Dubrovik.\n\nWe could not make time for Istrian Peninsla but that’s a lovely area to visit in Croatia as well. Istria boasts a lovely coastline with pretty beaches and a crystal clear sea. The countryside has several fortified hilltop towns, olive groves and vineyards, and several hiking and biking trails. Much like Tuscany in Italy.\n\nThings to do in Croatia in summer\n\nHere are some of the best things to do in Croatia during spring or summer months.\n\nTake a road trip to enjoy the best of summer time in Croatia. And even though I would recommend leaving behind a car for trips to the Croatian islands, it is good to rent a car on the mainland. There are many advantages of a car holiday, but you should consider some points when traveling by car in Croatia.\n\nIsland hopping: If you are visiting Croatian islands by yourself, pick no more than 2 to 3 islands to explore. The islands are scattered across Adriatic Sea, and you need to understand the ferry system to reach them. You can also opt for a sailing trip across the Adriatic Sea.\n\nHiking: The best thing to do in summer is to go on a hike. Some of the famous hiking trails in Croatia are Krka national park, Paklenica national park and Plitvice lakes national park. We really enjoyed our overnight trip to Plitvice Lakes and spent exploring both the Upper and Lower Lakes at a lesiurely pace.\n\nKayaking / snorkeling and other water activities: With its long coastline and clear water, kayaking is a must-do in Croatia. And there are hordes of companies that can organise the kayaking experience for you, from most cities (Zadar, Split, Dubrovnik) and most large islands (Hvar, Vis, Brac, Korcula etc). We enjoyed our sunset kayaking experience in Dubrovnik.\n\nWine tasting tours: Croatia has been producing authentic wine for more than 2400 years. Istria wine region is of course the main location for wine tasting in Croatia. There are nearly a 100 wineries on this little peninsula.\n\nThere are wineries near Zagreb to make use of the cold continental climate, perfect growing temperature for grapes to make sparkling wine. Not too far from the city of Dubrovnik is the Peljesac peninsula that has many wineries. You can visit one of these if you are spending more than a day in Zagreb.\n\nFestivals and Events in Croatia in June\n\nThere are many events that take place in Croatia in the month of June. Take a look!\n\nOn 25 June, Croatians celebrate their national day or Independence Day, also known in Croatian as ‘Dan državnosti’. This state holiday commemorates Croatia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991.\n\nIt’s worth stopping in at Korčula Island in June for their annual Sword Dance Festival. Since the 17th century, two dance groups have kept this traditional battle dance alive. With the aim of preserving the heritage of this dance for future generations, onlookers are treated to performances in traditional dress and are told tales of victory through the dance’s dynamic movements.\n\nMystic Mountain Festival: Croatia’s unique boutique festival returns in June, at a location near the Plitvice Lakes. Mystic Mountain Festival has music, dance, workshops, seminars, lectures, group meditations, creative art and guided hiking tours. Hideout Festival returns for 5 days and nights partying at five open-air venues on Zrće beach on Pag.\n\nINmusic Festival is a wholesome vibe with extravagant activities, dance shows and musical plays. This biggest Croatian open-air event takes place for 3 straight days in Zagreb. The capital city also holds a Dance Week Festival, likely in June.\n\nInternational Children’s festival is a 3-week festival that starts in late June. There are many art and craft workshops, music shows, dance shows, documentaries, movie screenings and puppet shows just to entertain and celebrate the kids. This is a super fun festival to participate in if you are travelling with your kids!\n\nMy first Impressions of Croatia\n\nCroatia – the name conjures something far away and exotic. My first trip to East Europe. A visit to Diocletian Palace and King’s landing!\n\nThe immigration officer at the Delhi international airport, however shrugged when we told him our final port of destination, and added, “But why is everyone going to Croatia these days!”\n\nUmm, not that exotic. But wait, the connect between Croatia and India is quite interesting.\n\nIn Zagreb, an elderly taxi driver, while dropping us from our hotel to the car rental pick-up centre, said to us, “Ah, you are Indian. Indira Gandhi, very good leader.” As an Indian travelling across the globe, it has never happened that I get multiple references of Nehru and Indira Gandhi from foreigners.\n\nWhile reading more of the country’s history and discussing it extensively during the Military tour we took in Vis, the triumvirate of Tito, Nehru and Nasser that had become a famous world icon came up. The history of the Non-alignment movement during the Cold War was closely connected with the evolution and performance of countries like Yugoslavia, India and Egypt.\n\nSummary: Pros and Cons of visiting Croatia in June\n\nHave I convinced you to visit Croatia in June?
