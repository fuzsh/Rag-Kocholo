        "text": "Croatia is a beautiful country with so much to offer visitors, from stunning architecture and Mediterranean beaches, to incredible food and wine. And while the summer months are the busiest time to visit, there are plenty of reasons to put Croatia on your radar for a fall or winter getaway in Croatia.\n\nWe’ve lived in Croatia since March and are now going into December and I really want to share why I think visiting Croatia in November is a great idea!\n\nHere's everything you need to know about visiting Croatia in November, from the Croatia climate in November to the events you might want to check out on your trip!\n\np.s. every photo in this article is taken in November 2022!\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something. While clicking these links won't cost you anything, they will help me to keep this site up and running! Check out the full disclosure policy for more details. Thank you so much!\n\nI feel like major tourist spots like Split, Dubrovnik or Zagreb get a second life in November. The cities come alive with locals, everything is cheaper, everyone is celebrating a successful season and looking forward to the Christmas festivities.\n\nExploring the cities in November feels like you’ve discovered a hidden destination because they feel nothing like the bustling tourist season in the summer, in fact you can go days without hearing an international language - the complete opposite of the summer months! It feels like a more authentic and also more relaxed experience in Croatia in November.\n\nCroatia in early November was still hitting a very pleasant 22oC (72oF). Towards the end of the month, it became rainier and the days were shorter, but still nowhere near as chilly as I’d expect at this time of year in the UK!\n\nAs long as you’re not coming to Croatia in November and expecting a beach holiday, here’s what you’ll find instead:\n\nMild temperatures, you’ll still need jeans and a coat, especially for the evenings but it doesn’t drop below 10oC during the day\n\nCheaper prices for food, drinks and accommodation - the tourist season is over, now you’ll be paying local prices!\n\nA more local, friendly atmosphere in hubs like Split, Dubrovnik, Zagreb - after avoiding the city full of tourists for the summer months, the locals can enjoy their towns and cities without the high prices and packed crowds of visitors\n\nAdvent starts in the last week of November - Croatia starts decorating for Christmas in mid-November and the Christmas Markets start towards the end of the month - Christmas markets and palm trees anyone?!\n\nThe Croatia weather in November can be quite variable, but overall it's still mild and sunny, especially along the coast.\n\nThe Croatia temperature in November hovers around 10-15oC (50-60F) during the day for most of the month, although during our November here, we saw temperatures in the 15-22oC range for most of the month except when it because rainy towards the end of the month and returned to around 10-15oC.\n\nSome parts of the country, usually inland, can see temperatures dipping to 0-5oC (30-40F) at night, but on the coast it’s usually warmer. Our experience living in Split, Croatia in November is that it’s never dropped lower than 8oC at night and we only saw that a couple of times around the 25th November.\n\nWhile you're unlikely to see much snow in November, it's not unheard of for there to be a light dusting in some inland parts of the country, we experienced a significant amount of snow in Plitvice Lakes National Park in winter.\n\nGenerally, Croatia in November weather is much milder than most of Europe is experiencing at this time of year!\n\nBecause of the variable weather, it's important to pack layers when visiting Croatia in November.\n\nI would recommend a sweater and a light jacket such as a windbreaker or waterproof which will be handy for cooler nights or days spent exploring inland towns away from the coast. It can also get quite breezy on the coast or if you decide to head out on the water for a day.\n\nComfortable shoes are also a must - you'll be doing a lot of walking!\n\nI can’t promise you that there will be beach weather in November in Croatia, however in early November this year, we were still at the beach! Also the water is warmer in November than it is in April/May because it’s been warmed up all summer by the sun, so if you’re brave enough and the weather looks good, you might want to bring a swimsuit!\n\nHere’s the full list of must-haves that I’d recommend:\n\nShort sleeved and long sleeved shirts and tshirts for layering\n\nA sweater\n\nA light jacket (ideally windproof or waterproof)\n\nA hat (either a cap to block the sun or a warmer hat if you’re prone to cold ears like me!)\n\nJeans or longer skirt/dress/tights to cover your legs\n\nComfortable shoes - trainers or sneakers are fine\n\nA swimsuit if you’re brave!\n\nYou’ll see a pattern emerging here… there are significantly less flights to Croatia in November compared to during the summer.\n\nIn fact to give you an example, there are only around 5-7 international flight arrivals a day into Split airport, whereas this is quadrupled during the summer season.\n\nThere are almost no direct flights from the UK to Split in November, the last direct flight I could find this year was 5th November. However there are direct flights from London to Zagreb. So if you’re visiting Croatia from the UK in winter, I suggest a flight into Zagreb and a domestic flight (or renting a car!) if you want to explore elsewhere in the country.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit Split, Dubrovnik or Rijeka, you’ll find Croatia in November travel is possible from these airports in Europe with a direct flight:\n\nMunich\n\nFrankfurt\n\nDusseldorf\n\nZurich\n\nAmsterdam\n\nRome\n\nDublin (Dubrovnik only)\n\nLondon (Zagreb and Dubrovnik only)\n\nThere are also international flights into Dubrovnik from Korea and Turkey.\n\nFor any other flight routes, I recommend flying into Zagreb and taking a domestic flight.\n\nFlights to Croatia are widely available in November, although you may have more luck finding deals from European airports rather than flying from the US. I recommend flying into Frankfurt which is a large European hub which is serviced by Delta and Virgin Airlines. (we’ve flown from Ft. Lauderdale and Detroit into Frankfurt before).\n\nPrices will also be lower than during peak travel season, making it a great time for budget-minded travellers. When booking accommodation, keep in mind that prices will also be lower than during peak season - another perk of travelling during the off season!\n\nDubrovnik in November is unrecognisable without the crowds, Split is a thriving local city, Hvar, Pula, Makarska, and Rijeka - all these places are free of the summer tourists and you’ll experience a more relaxed and authentic Croatia.\n\nDespite being the most famous destination in Croatia, Dubrovnik is actually really small with a population of around 30,000 people (Split is around 170,000) so seeing Dubrovnik without the crowds is a very quiet city indeed!\n\nIn Dubrovnik and some of the islands you might find that a lot of restaurants and attractions are closed as they only open for the season. But visiting Split, Zagreb or other larger cities like Rijeka or Pula will still have plenty to do.\n\nLocals live on the islands so the ferries continue to run all year round. While the sailing trips and boat tours aren’t really as prevalent in November, the ferry is cheaper and very reliable. Plus if you have a rental car you can go across to some islands like Brac and Hvar and enjoy an island road trip, hopping between island towns and off the beaten path destinations.\n\nMy favourite island day trip from Split is Brac Island and the ferry is only about 1 hour.\n\nThere is also a catamaran ferry from Split to Hvar although that doesn’t carry cars but it does drop you right into the port at Hvar Old Town."
