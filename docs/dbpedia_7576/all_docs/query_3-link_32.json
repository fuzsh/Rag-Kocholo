        "text": "When thinking about what to pack for a summer trip to Croatia, focus should be on classy but comfortable outfits that can take you from lunch to sunset drinks, from walking in cobblestone streets to visiting a winery or going to the beach, and that can adapt to the hot temperatures.\n\nWhen it comes to footwear, Croatia is filled with old cobblestone streets, narrow alleyways and stairs, and this means wearing the the right shoes is essential.\n\nIf you plan to participate in adventure activities such as rafting, hiking in the mountains or the like, add the necessary outdoor gear.\n\nSee our Amazon Croatia & Montenegro Packing list with all the product recommendations mentioned here.\n\nWhat to expect in the summer months in Croatia\n\nSummers in Croatia are warm and the sun stays up until late. However, not all summer months are made equal.\n\nJune sees long days where the sun is up until past 9pm and summer solstice celebrations abound. It is a wonderful month with warm temperatures, beautiful evenings, but slightly cooler sea temperatures. It is a month we love because it is the beginning of summer and spirits are high with anticipation.\n\nJuly and August are hot and sticky and temperatures can make sightseeing unpleasant in the heat of the day. To add to that, the never ending stream of cruise goers will make visits to smaller towns like Dubrovnik, a challenge.\n\nSeptember is similar to June in temperatures and the days are still long, rains are low and it is the wine harvest season. The sea remains warm from the summer and the crowds start to dwindle.\n\nWeather in Croatia in the summer\n\nSummertime in Croatia runs from June to September, officially, from the 23rd of June until the 23rd of September but each month is slightly different.\n\nThe weather in July and August is hot, with temperatures well above the 30 degrees Celsius (86 F) and humidity levels approaching 100%. In the peak hours of the day, you can’t do much, which is why everyone heads to the beach or takes a break.\n\nAlthough both June and September share a similar weather outlook, there are also some differences; one is at the beginning of the summer while the other is the end of it, so the atmosphere varies and the climate is slightly different.\n\nThe weather in June and September in Croatia\n\nJune is a beautiful month to visit Croatia, perhaps my favorite, and September is a close second.\n\nTemperatures in both months are mild and range from 18 to 25 degrees Celsius or 64 to 77 Fahrenheit. Rainfall is lower in June though, which is why we prefer it. Both months have plenty of sunshine with 12h and 10h respectively a day.\n\nEvenings can get a bit chilly so a light jacket is welcome if you plan to eat at the many terraces or enjoy a stroll back to your accommodation. The sea temperature is lower in June than September.\n\nThe weather in July and August in Croatia\n\nIn July and August, temperatures rise considerably approaching 30 Celsius and 85 Farenheit, which make sightseeing during the peak hours of the day unpleasant.\n\nDays are longer, the humidity goes up, rainfall drops and there is a bit more sunshine than in June and September.\n\nThe probability of rain remains very low and showers are quick and short and the sea temperature is higher than in June.\n\nPacking tips for summer in Croatia\n\nWith the above weather conditions in mind, it is important to pack accordingly for a trip to Croatia in the summer, not so much for cultural reasons but to make sure you are comfortable.\n\nFootwear for stairs and cobblestone streets\n\nAlmost all the towns and villages you will visit in Croatia are old and made of uneven cobblestone streets that are shinny and slippery from the constant foot traffic walking on them.\n\nThe are also lots of stairs in narrow alleyways, and buildings in the old towns do not have lifts, that means more stairs.\n\nSome of the sightseeing, like the Dubrovnik Walls, means more stairs, ramps and rock surfaces and the beaches are not sandy, but rocky or made of pebbles.\n\nWhat this means for your trip to Croatia and your packing list:\n\nLots of stairs, ramps and streets that may be hard to climb but even harder on your knees to descend.\n\nCobblestone streets with uneven surfaces and rocky, sometimes slippery, surfaces that make it easy to sprain an ankle or slip and fall.\n\nHiking gravel paths with lots of stairs to get to hidden beaches, around fortified walls, to monasteries, etc.\n\nRocky coast and pebble beaches.\n\nHigh-heels or very flat shoes without grip or support will make your feet tired and walking the wonderful villages more challenging, even dangerous.\n\nA pair of cute sneakers like the ever present Italian brand Superga or any other pair of sturdy shoes that provide support (aka holds your foot in place) and cushion (for the long days of walking) like these ones are a great idea.\n\nFor the beach, the coast and the boat trips, reef shoes or closed waterproof sandals like the ones from Teva (which by the way last a lifetime) are essential because beaches are made of pebbles. A proper pair of lightweight sneakers (I have these ones from Salomon) will come in handy for hiking.\n\nCroatians are not big fans of AC\n\nWhile the weather will be hot outside, many restaurants and bars are open air and rely on the sea breeze.\n\nPublic indoor spaces such as hotel receptions, restaurants and museums, will have AC, though it is not something readily available and when it is, it will not be as strong as in the US or parts of Asia.\n\nThis means that, if heat is not your thing, you should bring your own portable AC unit. Yes, that is very much a thing. Many of our guests bring this one.\n\nBeware of pickpockets\n\nEurope is generally a very safe continent for solo female travelers but popular tourist destinations such as London, Paris, Milan or Florence are magnets for pickpockets who, believe me, are absolute pros.\n\nWhen walking the many touristy towns or wandering the streets of Dubrovnik, you should be extra alert to anyone trying to distract you, asking something from you, etc. who may have hidden intentions. Never leave belongings unattended or in plain sight and keep everything inside a zipped handbag.\n\nA cross-body bag that is always zipped and in front will help but the best safeguard is a slash-proof, anti-theft bag, designed for extra safety. There are a few anti-theft bag models that we specifically recommend because Meg and I, our team or many of our guests have used on our European tours:\n\nOur photographer uses this backpack from Pacsafe for all her photographer equipment and highly recommends it.\n\nMeg has this larger cross body bag that even fits her laptop and can also expand (think shopping).\n\nMany of our guests have this one from Travelon that comes with a compartment for the water bottle. This has to be the most commonly used by our guests.\n\nAnother classic coss-body bag from Travelon that is smaller so many of our guests love it because it is lighter.\n\nA waist bag option from Travelon that you can wear on your waist or across your chest like I always use mine. This makes it much more convenient to reach out for things and much closer to your body, so harder to steal from.\n\nFor shorter trips to the beach, or a half day excursion, a simpler water bottle with a compartment for some essentials is usually enough. Meg likes to use this one, to the amusement of her nephews who think she is “not cool enough”.There are so many easy targets available in crowded places that, as soon as you make yourself a more difficult one, you raise the barrier for the average thief.\n\nEverything goes, but locals like it stylish\n\nIn Croatia you can dress however you like with the weather and geography in mind. There are no restrictions, cultural or otherwise, on what clothes you should or should not wear.\n\nModesty is only required in religious buildings where you should cover knees and shoulders and a shawl is usually enough.\n\nCroatians dress up nicely and are very tall, in fact, some of the tallest in Europe. Large brim hats, flying dresses, oversized earrings, accessories, and outfits that are well put together are the norm in the fashionable marinas, the higher end hotels and restaurants and the stylish bars.\n\nHow to dress at the beach\n\nWhile comfort trumps style at the beach, people still dress nicely, and good appearance will get you far, especially at the posher beach and pool clubs.\n\nCut denims, flip flops and oversized clothing that doesn’t fit your shape easily distinguishes tourists from locals.\n\nCroatian men are known to favor Speedos and you will see many older men wearing them. Women prefer bikini although fashionable one-piece swim suits are more common these days.\n\nGoing topless is not frowned upon and you’ll see plenty of bare chested women. Nudism is not usually allowed but on the nudist beaches, and there are plenty of those, ask around.\n\nWhile you can pretty much put on whatever on the beach and adjacent areas, do not take the beach attired to a restaurant unless it is one on the beach. Covering up, even if just throwing on a dress, is expected.\n\nWhat to pack for summer in Croatia\n\nNow that you understand the weather and the fashion sense in Croatia, it’s time to have a look at what to wear in the summer.\n\nLinen shirts and slacks\n\nLinen is a great material for the hot summer weather and I love to wear it, especially in loose fitting shirts over leggings or as a pair of long trousers.\n\nThe main issue with linen clothing is that it requires ironing and I don’t like to iron when I am on holidays. To minimize creasing, check out our packing hacks and roll the clothes.\n\nDresses\n\nThe best thing to wear during a Croatian summer is a light, comfortable, flowy dress. It can be long or short, mini or maxi, in a solid color or patterned, but generally, it is loose and not tight.\n\nThink wrap-around dresses, spaghetti strap dresses, florals, etc. if they are below the knee you’ll be sure to be allowed into churches so bear that in mind.\n\nFor the night, a cute short or long dress in a solid color paired with a nice accessory will help you blend in. I love this V-neck one and this statement tunic dress or this great summery option one of our guests wore.\n\nYou should carry a cardigan in the evenings, even in the summer months, in case it get chilly.\n\nSkirts\n\nSkirts, of all lengths. Long skirts with a cute top, three quarter length with a blouse, tule ones, lace skirts, plated, etc.\n\nSkirts are a girl’s best friend in and all the skirts from ChicWish are the PERFECT chic style. I have and wear three of them in all our summer European trips to Barcelona & Costa Brava, Tuscany, Amalfi Coast, Venice and Greece.\n\nCrop pants\n\nI am a big fan of crop pants because they can be really cute, come in a variety of materials and are fun yet conservative and cover me from the sun, plus they fit my silhouette.\n\nA pair of light crop denims like these ones in aqua or linen pants will come in handy. You could also opt for jumpsuits or rompers. This cute romper would fit right in.\n\nCute t-shirts and tops\n\nEuropean women we like to wear comfy but cute tshirts, sleeveless, strapless or tank tops and blouses that may be floral, with a design or have details that make them a bit more than just a white tshirt. Materials such as cotton and silk can dress you up and are light and fresh, linen works great in the summer.\n\nCrop tops, spaghetti strap tops and other clothes that show a lot of skin are certainly worn by teenagers (like everywhere else) but you will not generally find a local woman dressed like that.\n\nSwimwear\n\nWhether you prefer a bright bikini or a swimming suit, you can’t visit Croatia in the summer without bringing appropriate swimwear with you, not just for the beach but for the hotel’s pools and boat rides.\n\nTo complement that, bring a pair of water / reef shoes or plastic sandals from Crocs that will make it easier for you to walk on the pebble beaches and the rocky bays.\n\nA kaftan\n\nChannel your inner goddess and Croatian chic style with a flowy kaftan or coverup for poolside chilling, we will have many occasions to wear them, at beach and pool clubs, at our hotel and on our private yachts.\n\nPretty and comfortable shoes\n\nAs we said, comfortable shoes will be your most important item in your packing list. During the day, when wandering the colorful villages, a cute pair of casual sneakers such as the omnipresent and Italian-made Superga, are a good idea.\n\nYou can also wear espadrilles, like these flat ones, these flowery summery ones or these ankle wrap strap ones that can go from day to night, but they are less comfortable for all day walking and could be slippery on the cobblestones, so they are for shorter evening walks. The brand Toni Pons from Barcelona has many models and styles.\n\nFlip flips or other open sandals that do not keep your foot in place will not protect your feet from twisting you ankle and are a bad idea. They are also not good at the beach where all the small pebbles and rocks make walking painful. You could consider a pair of jelly sandals that can go from day to beach if that is your style.\n\nIn the evening, a pair of wedge espadrilles like these pretty ankle strap ones or these ivory flatter ones will take you to the nicer restaurants.\n\nA pair of walking shoes\n\nA pair of walking shoes are a must for hiking Dubrovnik’s walls or exploring in general.\n\nYou do not need to bring hiking shoes but a good pair of sports / tennis shoes / sneakers that have grip and are comfortable are strongly recommended.\n\nYou can wear Amazon Best selling cork sandals, Italian cotton trainers Superga, a pair of comfy Dr. Scholls sneakers, Sketchers walking sneakers that have been specifically designed for touristing.\n\nI have a pair of these New Balance sneakers when I need to properly exercise or be comfortable, and I wear Anothersole shoes on all our tours, they are fantastic. Want something fancier, opt for a pair of golden sneakers.\n\nA cute evening outfit\n\nCroatians like to dress up, we’ve mentioned that, and for dinner, they dress up extra nicely with pretty accessories, nice flowy dresses and perfect hair and makeup.\n\nYou don’t have to follow local attire but if you like to, this is when you should bring out your most elegant and fashionable outfits.\n\nStatement accessories\n\nOne of the best ways to take an outfit from day to night is by accessorising it. Pack a couple of pieces of jewellery, a cute clutch or tote bag, earrings, a scarf or even just an oversized pair of sunglasses or hat to show off your style.\n\nA light jacket\n\nEven though the temperature during the day is warm, it does drop at night and having dinner outside, and in front of the sea, means the sea breeze can make you feel chilly, bring a light cardigan, jacket or pashmina for the evenings.\n\nOther things to pack for Croatia\n\nBesides clothing, there are a few other things worth packing for your trip to Croatia in the summer.\n\nWhat not to pack for summer in Croatia\n\nThere are also a few things we do not recommend you bring to Croatia if you are coming in the summer, mainly, because you won’t need them.\n\nHair dryer: Most hotels have them and if yours is old, you’ll also need to carry a converter or make sure it works with double voltage so that it does not get fried by the Croatian 220V.\n\nHand bags that don’t close: You know the ones, the basket-style ones that don’t have a zipper to close them are a big no-no in Croatia’s most popular tourist sights, unless you want to make pickpockets happy.\n\nExplorer clothing: I find it hilarious when I see tourists dressed like they are in the Serengeti, with khaki clothes, trousers that unzip to shorts and trekking boots, everyone will know you are a tourist and didn’t get the memo on dressing up. Plus it is completely unnecessary."
