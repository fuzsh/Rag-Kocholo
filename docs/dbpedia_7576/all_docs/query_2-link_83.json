        "text": "September is my personal favourite time to visit Croatia. You’ll find warm (sometimes hot) temperatures, lashings of sunshine and warm seas. The summer crowds have melted away and prices of flights and accommodation are considerably lower than in peak summer. Sightseeing is comfortable in the mornings and late afternoon, but be prepared for the odd hot day over 30°C, especially early in the month.\n\nSeptember offers ideal conditions for activities such as mountain biking, sailing and short hikes in the countryside. Sea temperatures of 21-24°C are perfect for swimming and water sports. Grape harvest season means wine festivals and tastings. Watch out for local events such as harvest festivals, historical reenactments, and food tastings.\n\nFor detailed suggestions, see the best holiday destinations in Croatia plus our expert guides to the Dalmatian coast, and the beautiful unspoilt region of Istria. For a different experience, you could join a gulet cruise along the Adriatic coast, or check out these singles holidays in Croatia.\n\nSee the latest holiday deals to Croatia.\n\nDubrovnik\n\nAverage temperature in September: 25°C\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 10\n\nMonthly rainfall: 48mm\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 30 mins\n\nSeptember offers a perfect combination of warm weather, fewer crowds, and lower prices in Dubrovnik. Stroll the historic city walls in peace and take scenic boat trips to forested Mljet Island. Visit Pelješac Peninsula for wine tasting amid vineyards and olive groves. Enjoy swimming and kayaking around hidden coves and uninhabited islands nearby.\n\nSplit\n\nAverage temperature in September: 26°C\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 10\n\nMonthly rainfall: 52mm\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 30 mins\n\nThe crowds dissipate in September, making it easier to explore historic Split. Wander Diocletian’s Palace and climb the campanile bell tower for views over the city and coastline. Take ferries to nearby islands such as Brač and Hvar for hiking, cycling, and sampling fresh seafood. Inland, visit Krka National Park to see its lakes and waterfalls framed by autumn foliage.\n\nZagreb\n\nAverage temperature in September: 22°C\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nMonthly rainfall: 91mm\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 20 mins\n\nSeptember heralds cooler temperatures and vivid autumn scenery around Zagreb. Explore Upper Town’s museums and sample seasonal dishes at outdoor cafes. Nearby Plitvice Lakes National Park should be ablaze with autumn colours towards the end of September. Or visit the wine region of Samobor an hour’s drive west of Zagreb.\n\nPula\n\nAverage temperature in September: 23°C\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 10\n\nMonthly rainfall: 58mm\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 20 mins\n\nQuieter than summer, September is ideal for exploring Pula‘s Roman ruins and historic harbour. Nearby, the hilltop towns of Motovun and Grožnjan host film and music festivals. Visit the seaside villages of Fazana and Rovinj, cycle through vineyards, and tour Poreč‘s 6th-century Euphrasian Basilica.\n\nZadar\n\nAverage temperature in September: 24°C\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 10\n\nMonthly rainfall: 55mm\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 30 mins\n\nSeptember is a wonderful time to experience Zadar‘s historic charm along its seafront promenade and Roman Forum. Nearby Paklenica National Park offers rock climbing amid dramatic peaks and canyons. Or relax inland at Plitvice Lakes, surrounded by vivid autumn foliage.\n\nVarazdin\n\nAverage temperature in September: 21°C\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nMonthly rainfall: 84mm\n\nWith its Baroque architecture and riverside cafes, inland Varazdin comes alive in September. The mild weather creates pleasant conditions for cycling, walking, and exploring nearby castles and villages. Don’t miss the Spancirfest street performers’ festival in early September.\n\nHoliday weather in Croatia in September\n\nDestination Average highs Average hours of sun Average rainfall (mm) Dubrovnik 25°C 10 hours 48 Split 26°C 10 hours 52 Zagreb 22°C 8 hours 91 Pula 23°C 10 hours 58 Zadar 24°C 10 hours 55 Varazdin 21°C 8 hours 84\n\nCompare months\n\nWeather in Croatia in March\n\nWeather in Croatia in April\n\nWeather in Croatia in May\n\nWeather in Croatia in June\n\nWeather in Croatia in July\n\nWeather in Croatia in August\n\nWeather in Croatia in September\n\nWeather in Croatia in October\n\nWeather in Croatia in November\n\nAlso see our expert guide to where’s hot in September in Europe.\n\nExtreme weather in Croatia in September\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in September in Croatia was 39.6°C (103°F) in Ploče on the southern coast in 2016. The lowest temperature was -8.6°C (16°F) in Zagreb in 1940. Hard to believe if you visit Zagreb now in September!\n\nThough September brings warm, settled conditions to much of Croatia, extremes can still occur. Hot southerly winds may push temperatures above 35°C, particularly along the coast and islands. Meanwhile, early cold snaps can blanket higher ground with snow, especially in interior mountain towns. And remnants of late summer storms may bring intense rainfall, lightning, and hail, causing isolated flooding.\n\nLast updated: 26 February 2024\n\nSave up to 40% on your next holiday"
