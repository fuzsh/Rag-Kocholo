        "text": "Interior Croatia includes places like Zagreb and Slavonia. Summers can get very hot in the interior regions with temperatures often hitting the mid to high 86째Fs. However, it often feels warmer because of the lack of sea breeze. Similar to the coast, rainfall is low to none in summertime.\n\nWinter in the interior regions is cold. Temperatures hover between 23째F and 41째F and moderate to heavy snowfall is common, particularly at higher elevations.\n\nIf you're travelling to Croatia for snow, then you're in luck! Interior regions get copious amounts of snow during winter, including Motovun, Gorski Kotar, Sljeme, Plitvice Lakes National Park and the Hrvatsko Zagorje region. Winter temperatures usually average 32째F so the ground is cold enough for snow to stick for an extended period. Although temperatures are conducive to frequent snowfall, it's unlikely to be extremely heavy, so if you're interested in skiing or snowboarding, travel to the ski resorts in the height of winter (January) to enjoy the best powder."
