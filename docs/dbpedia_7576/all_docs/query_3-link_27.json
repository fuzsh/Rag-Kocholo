        "text": "Choosing Croatia for your Fulbright grant offers you the chance to work in the European Union's newest member state and enjoy life in a beautiful country with a historically rich culture. Croatia, located in the center of Europe, declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, making it one of Europe's youngest nations. Croatia joined the European Union in July 2013. Zagreb's capital has all the characteristics of a historic and modern central European city. Zagreb is a university center — home to 40 graduate and undergraduate institutions and over 80,000 students. Zagreb University opened in the latter half of the 17th century and is one of the oldest universities in Europe. The cities of Split, Zadar, Osijek, Dubrovnik, Pula, Koprivnica, Varazdin, and Rijeka also have universities.\n\nFulbright grantees in Croatia select from a variety of programming that includes an in-country orientation program, invitations to Embassy events, and opportunities to participate in educational programs and activities around Croatia. There are five American Corners in public and university libraries in Croatia – in Zagreb, Zadar, Osijek, Vukovar, and Rijeka. The Embassy encourages and facilitates Fulbright grantees' participation in American Corner programs. Croatian alumni of exchange programs and institutions are eligible to compete for small grants through the Embassy's Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs), and Fulbright grantees often work with host institutions and partners to propose follow-on projects.\n\nCroatia is rich in cultural programs, culinary events, and outdoor activities (Official website of the Croatian National Tourist Board | Croatia.hr). Most major cities boast summertime cultural and food festivals and winter advent holiday markets. Zagreb won the award for the best advent market in Europe for many years. The Adriatic Coast is famous for its Mediterranean landscapes and climate. Istria, the peninsula just south of Trieste in Italy, offers many lovely weekend getaways only a 2-3 hour drive from Zagreb. Dalmatia is Croatia's most famous vacation area. Historical relics abound in towns like Zadar, Split, and Dubrovnik. Croatia's city of Dubrovnik in southern Dalmatia is often called the Pearl of the Adriatic and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Northern Dalmatia boasts several gorgeous coastal cities, such as Zadar and Šibenik. A warm current flowing north along the coast keeps the climate mild. The sea temperature is warm enough for swimming until the end of September and beginning again in May.\n\nThe academic year runs from October until June, with semesters running from October until January, and March until June. Research grants require language fluency commensurate with the requirements of the proposed project.\n\nAverage housing expenses in Croatia are estimated between 750 and 1000 USD, depending on the type of accommodation (student dorm or privately rented housing) and the city in Croatia. Larger cities like Zagreb or Split, as well as popular tourist destinations, are generally more expensive. For more information on average prices in Croatia, please visit Numbeo. Please note that Croatia joined Eurozone on January 1, 2023. The official currency of the Republic of Croatia is the Euro. Foreign currency can be exchanged in banks, currency exchange offices, post offices, or at some hotels' reception desks. Major credit cards (Visa, Diners Club, Mastercard/Eurocard) are widely accepted in shops, hotels, and restaurants. ATMs (\"bankomats\") are also widely available across the country. Banks are generally open Monday to Friday from 8 am to 7 pm and on Saturdays from 8 am to 12 pm, but office hours may vary, especially in smaller towns. Banks are closed on Sundays and national holidays. For a list of licensed banks in Croatia, please consult the database of the Croatian National Bank."
