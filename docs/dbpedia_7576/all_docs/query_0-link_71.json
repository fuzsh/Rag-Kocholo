The aim of the present study was to assess outpatient utilization and rationality of cardiovascular drug prescribing in the City of Zagreb and Republic of Croatia based on the generic to original drug prescribing ratio. Data on the financial indicators and number of cardiovascular drug packages issued in 2008 were obtained from the Croatian Institute of Health Insurance. These data were used to calculate the number of defined daily doses (DDD) and number of DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/1000/day). The index of generic/original drug utilization was determined for Zagreb and Croatia as a measure for assessment of prescribing rationality; the significance of difference was determined by X2-test. The rate of prescribing original cardiovascular drugs was significantly higher in Zagreb as compared with Croatia as a whole. The index of prescribing generic versus original drugs was 1.20 (249/208 DDD/1000/day) in Zagreb and 1.65 (249/151 DDD/1000/day) in Croatia. Difference in the utilization of generic drugs between Zagreb and Croatia as determined by X2-test (the level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05) was statistically significant (P=0.021). The highest differences were recorded in the most widely prescribed drug groups, i.e. ACE inhibitors with the generic/original drug index of 1.38 in Zagreb and 2.02 in Croatia; and hypolipemics with the generic/original drug index of 0.96 in Zagreb and 1.34 in Croatia. According to financial indicators, the generic/original drug index was 1.44 in Croatia and only 0.96 in Zagreb. The significantly greater influence of pharmaceutical industry marketing in Zagreb entailed the significantly higher rate of original drug prescribing, which is associated with considerably greater drug expenses. Measures to stimulate prescribing generic drugs should be\n\nLearning Wellness: A Water Exercise Class in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRoberson, Donald N., Jr.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe research reported in this article investigated the dynamics of a water exercise class with older adults in Zagreb, Croatia.

Data on drug utilization from Zagreb Municipal Pharmacy and Sarajevo Public Pharmacy were used to calculate the number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID) using the WHO Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical methodology. Total utilization of psychopharmaceuticals increased in both cities; however, it was higher in Zagreb than in Sarajevo throughout the study period. The utilization of psycholeptics increased in Zagreb by 2.4% (from 74.5 to 76.3 DDD/TID) and in Sarajevo by 3.8% (from 62.4 to 64.8 DDD/TID). The utilization of anxiolytics decreased in Zagreb by 2.1% and in Sarajevo by even 18.7%. The utilization of antidepressants increased in both cities with predominance of SSRI over TCA utilization, greater in Sarajevo (96.6%) than in Zagreb (10.2%). The anxiolytic/antidepressant ratio decreased by 11.1% in Zagreb (from 2.87 to 2.55) and by 58.7% in Sarajevo (from 5.66 to 2.34). Outpatient utilization of antipsychotics increased significantly in Sarajevo, predominated by typical ones, whereas in Zagreb the utilization of antipsychotics was stable, predominated by atypical ones. In Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina, there was an obvious tendency to follow western trends in drug prescribing, as demonstrated by the increased use of antidepressants and reduced use of anxiolytics. Despite some improvement observed in the prescribing quality, high use of antipsychotics with dominance of typical antipsychotics in Sarajevo points to the need of prescribing guidelines for antipsychotics.\n\nInternship workplace preferences of final-year medical students at Zagreb University Medical School, Croatia: all roads lead to Zagreb.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolasek, Ozren; Kolcic, Ivana; Dzakula, Aleksandar; Bagat, Mario\n\n2006-04-01\n\nHuman resources management in health often encounters problems related to workforce geographical distribution. The aim of this study was to investigate the internship workplace preferences of final-year medical students and the reasons associated with their choices. A total of 204 out of 240 final-year medical students at Zagreb University Medical School, Croatia, were surveyed a few months before graduation. We collected data on each student's background, workplace preference, academic performance and emigration preferences. Logistic regression was used to analyse the factors underlying internship workplace preference, classified into two categories: Zagreb versus other areas. Only 39 respondents (19.1%) wanted to obtain internships outside Zagreb, the Croatian capital. Gender and age were not significantly associated with internship workplace preference. A single predictor variable significantly contributed to the logistic regression model: students who believed they would not get the desired specialty more often chose Zagreb as a preferred internship workplace (odds ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.86). A strong preference for Zagreb as an internship workplace was recorded. Uncertainty about getting the desired specialty was associated with choosing Zagreb as a workplace, possibly due to more extensive and diverse job opportunities.\n\nCreating an Intercultural Learning Opportunity: Zagreb, Croatia and Plattsburgh, New York\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMountcastle, Amy\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the spring of 2009 I embarked on a teaching experiment in which I joined an online SUNY-Plattsburgh class taking my Anthropology of Human Rights course with a conventional class at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, where I was a visiting professor teaching the same course.

So far 30 mosquito species have been detected in the city area. Culex pipiens form molestus is the dominant mosquito species in indoor breeding sites. In forested areas and areas exposed to flooding, the active period is early spring and the dominant species are Ochlerotatus sticticus, Ochlerotatus cantans, Ochlerotatus geniculatus and Aedes vexans. The eudominant mosquito species found in the artificial breeding sites are Culex pipiens and the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. Invasive Ae. albopictus, present in the Zagreb area since 2004, has expanded to a larger area of the city during the last three years. The recent emergence of the human West Nile virus and Usutu virus neuroinvasive disease in Zagreb and its surroundings highlighted the role of mosquitoes as vectors of emerging arboviruses. The paper focuses on mosquito species and arboviral infections detected in humans and animals in the Zagreb area, Croatia.\n\nCorrelation between Annual Corn Crop per Hectare in Croatia and Drought Indices for Zagreb-Gric Observatory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPandzic, Kreso; Likso, Tanja\n\n2017-04-01\n\nCorrelation coefficients between annual corn crop per hectare in Croatia and 9-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for Zagreb - Gric for August are shown as significant. The results indicate that there is also a significant correlation between those drought indices and drought damages. Thus a forecast of the indices for August could be used for estimation e.g. annual corn crop per hectare in Croatia. Better results could be expected if statistical relationship between annual corn crops per hectare will be considered on county level instead the whole Croatia and indices calculated for weather stations for the same county. Effective way for reduction of drought damages is irrigation which need to be significantly improved in future in Croatia\n\nSecular trend of menarche in Zagreb (Croatia) adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nVeÄek, Nenad; VeÄek, Andrea; Zajc PetranoviÄ, Matea; Tomas, Zeljka; Arch-VeÄek, Branka; SkariÄ-JuriÄ, Tatjana; MiliÄiÄ, Jasna\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo study the secular trend of menarche in high-school urban adolescent girls (Zagreb, Croatia) over the last two decades, and to evaluate the possible impact of worsening of socio-economic conditions on age at menarche during the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995). Three surveys of female adolescents aged 15-19 years: (a) 523 girls interviewed in 1990, (b) 888 girls interviewed in 1997, and (c) 399 girls interviewed in 2010. Self-reported age at menarche (in decimal years) was presented by age groups and year of interview. Differences in mean age at menarche between adolescent age groups as well as between surveys were tested using One-way ANOVA. The mean age at menarche was 12.82 years in 1990, 12.92 years in 1997 and 12.31 years in 2010. It increased by 0.10 years from 1990 to 1997 (p=0.290) and then declined by 0.61 years from 1997 to 2010 (p<0.001). Over the 20-year period, the overall mean age at menarche declined by 0.51 years (p<0.001). The age at menarche in Zagreb adolescents continued to decline significantly from 1990 to 2010 (p<0.001), in spite of a statistically insignificant initial increase between 1990 and 1997. When put in broader context, age at menarche mirrored socio-economic changes in the war period. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Over the 2002-2009 period, daily pollen data collected in Zagreb were used to identify two periods of high pollen concentration (> 600 grains/m(3)) for our analysis: period A (3-4 September 2002) and period B (6-7 September 2003). Synoptic conditions in both periods were very similar: Croatia was under the influence of a lower sector high pressure system moving slowly eastward over Eastern Europe. During the 2002-2009 period, this type of weather pattern (on ~ 70% of days), in conjunction with almost non-gradient surface pressure conditions in the area (on ~ 30% of days) characterised days when the daily pollen concentrations were higher than 400 grains/m(3). Numerical experiments using a mesoscale model at fine resolution showed successful multi-day simulations reproducing the local topographic influence on wind flow and in reasonable agreement with available observations. According to the model, the relatively weak synoptic flow (predominantly from the eastern direction) allowed local thermal circulations to develop over Zagreb during both high pollen episodes. Two-hour pollen concentrations and 48-h back-trajectories indicated that regional-range transport of pollen grains from the central Pannonian Plain was the cause of the high pollen concentrations during period A. During period B, the north-westward regional-range transport in Zagreb was supplemented significantly by pronounced horizontal recirculation of pollen grains. This recirculation happened within the diurnal local circulation over the city, causing a late-evening increase in pollen concentration.\n\nAtmospheric conditions during high ragweed pollen concentrations in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPrtenjak, Maja TeliÅ¡man; Srnec, Lidija; Peternel, Renata; MadÅ¾areviÄ, Valentina; Hrga, Ivana; StjepanoviÄ, Barbara\n\n2012-11-01\n\nWe examined the atmospheric conditions favourable to the occurrence of maximum concentrations of ragweed pollen with an extremely high risk of producing allergy.

This topic is important for public health as 137Cs is highly toxic due to its long half-life of radioactive decay and chemical similarity to potassium. 137Cs concentrations in fallout were much greater than in soil, but remained present longer in the latter. While being detectable in our measurements, 137Cs did not spread through the food chain in amounts exceeding the maximum allowed level of radioactive food contamination. However, more thorough and consistent measurements need to be done in order to establish the precise activity trends of 137Cs in Zagreb soil and fallout.\n\nFrontal sinus osteoma in a 16th century skeleton from Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nPubMed\n\nPremuÅ¾iÄ, Zrinka; RajiÄ Å ikanjiÄ, Petra; MaÅ¡iÄ, Boris\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe analysis of 16th century graves from Zagreb, Croatia, revealed a case of frontal sinus osteoma in a middle-aged female. This lesion was discovered during visual examination, due to postmortem breakage of the frontal bone. The significance of this finding is based on the fact that frontal sinus osteomas are very rarely reported in the palaeopathological literature, despite the fact that they account for 80% of all paranasal sinus osteomas in modern populations. This paper presents results of macroscopic and radiographic analyses of the lesion, accompanied by a detailed differential diagnosis. Although tumours are commonly considered diseases of modern lifestyles, the described case confirms their occurrence in the past. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

MeS increases the risk of developing various diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral angiopathy and type 2 diabetes. In our study, the subjects were 561 persons, residents of 11 homes for the elderly in Zagreb, Croatia. There were 160 men (28.5%) and 401 women (71.5%), aged from 56 to 96 years (the average being 79 years). Physical examination was conducted, which included blood pressure measurement, and body height and weight. Blood samples were taken for biochemical analysis. Along with other biochemical parameters, the levels of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol (LDL, HDL-C) were also measured. The results have shown the prevalence of MeS in the elderly instutionalised people to be in the range of 20.8%, according to WHO criteria. The most common MeS component was hypertension, and it was significantly more frequent in women than in men; also, the elevated triglyceride levels were more often found in women; the difference between men and women was also statistically significant. MeS is a serious and growing health problem not only in Croatia but worldwide as well. Further studies are needed to verify the prevalence of MeS in Croatia, as it is a major risk for CVD and many other severe diseases.\n\nAcademic profile of students who transferred to Zagreb School of Medicine from other medical schools in Croatia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDusek, Davorka; Dolovcak, Svjetlana; KljakoviÄ-GaspiÄ, Marko\n\n2004-02-01\n\nTo assess the academic performance of students who transferred to the Zagreb School of Medicine from other three medical schools in Croatia. Academic performance of medical students who moved from Rijeka, Osijek, or Split University Medical Schools to the Zagreb University School of Medicine at the second or third year was compared with academic performance of students enrolled at the Zagreb University School of Medicine. Using the Zagreb Medical School's registry, we made a list of 57 transfer students to Zagreb Medical School in the 1985-1994 period. Control group was formed of students enrolled at the Zagreb School of Medicine in the same period, whose names followed in alphabetical order after the names of transfer students. Students' performance was analyzed according to their grade average before transfer, grade average in the first year after transfer, total grade average after transfer, overall grade average, and duration of studies. We also analyzed the proportion of students in each group who did not pass the admission test at the Zagreb School of Medicine in the year before the enrollment in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka, and Split Medical Schools. Nineteen transfer students, transferred between 1985 and 1988, and their controls were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete data. Transfer students had significantly lower grade average before transfer (3.2-/+0.6 vs 3.5-/+0.7, p=0.03, Student t-test), lower grade average in the first year after transfer (3.2-/+0.6 vs 3.5-/+0.7, p=0.03), lower total grade average after transfer (3.6-/+0.5 vs 4.0-/+0.6, p<0.001), and lower overall grade average (3.5-/+0.5 vs 3.9-/+0.6, p<0.001) than control students. Median time to graduate for transfer students was 7 years (range, 5-9) and 6 years (range, 5-9) for control students (p=0.375, Mann-Whitney test).

Sociodemographic and clinical data on 11680 ambulatory patients, treated between January 1 and of December 31, 2011 were retrieved from the hospital database using a specific protocol. The obtained data were subsequently analyzed in order to assess the frequency of diagnoses and differences in sex and age. The most common ambulatory procedure was tooth extraction (37.67%) and the most common procedure in ambulatory operating room was alveolectomy (57.25%). The test of proportions showed that significantly more extractions (P<0.001) and intraoral incisions (P<0.001) were performed among male patients, whereas significantly more alveolectomies and apicoectomies were performed among female patients (P<0.001). A greater prevalence of periodontal disease was found in patients residing in Zagreb than in patients residing in rural areas. The data from this study may be useful for planning of ambulatory oral surgery services, budgeting, and sustaining quality improvement, enhancing oral surgical curricula, training and education of primary health care doctors and oral surgery specialists, and promoting patients' awareness of the importance of oral health.\n\n[Cycling in Zagreb].\n\nPubMed\n\nMatos, Stipan; Krapac, Ladislav; Krapac, Josip\n\n2007-01-01\n\nCycling in Zagreb, as means of urban transport inside and outside the city, has a bright past, hazy presence but a promising future. Every day, aggressive citizens who lack urban traffic culture mistreat many cyclists but also many pedestrians. Sedentary way of living, unhealthy eating habits and inadequate recreation would surely be reduced if Zagreb had a network of cycling tracks (190 cm) or lanes (80 cm). Main city roads were constructed at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the lack of cycling tracks is particularly evident in terms of missing connections between northern and southern parts of the city. Transportation of bikes in public vehicles, parking of bikes as well as cycling along the foot of the mountains Medvednica and Zumberacko gorje is not adequately organized. Better organization is necessary not only because of the present young generation but also because of the young who will shortly become citizens of the EU, where cycling is enormously popular. Cycling tourism is not known in Zagreb, partly due to inadequate roads. The surroundings of Zagreb are more suitable for cycling tourism and attractive brochures and tourist guides offer information to tourists on bikes. Professional, acrobatic and sports cycling do not have a tradition in Zagreb and in Croatia. The same holds true for recreational cycling and indoor exercise cycling. The authors discuss the impact of popularization of cycling using print and electronic media. The role of district and local self-government in the construction and improvement of traffic roads in Zagreb is very important. It is also significant for the implementation of legal regulations that must be obeyed by all traffic participants in order to protect cyclists, the most vulnerable group of traffic participants besides passengers. Multidisciplinary action of all benevolent experts would surely increase safety and pleasure of cycling in the city and its surroundings.

Green leafy vegetables and soil samples were taken from the gardens located in the outskirts of the city. Concentrations of Pb, Cd, As and Hg were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry; showing that average concentrations of metals and metalloids in vegetables and in soil, regardless of the location of sampling were below the maximum allowed concentration (MAC). The analysis determined that metal concentrations in only nine vegetable samples (9%) were above maximum allowed values prescribed by national and European legislation (three with higher concentrations of Pb, one with a higher concentration of Cd and five with higher concentrations of Hg). Concentrations of contaminants present in the analysed samples, in general, are lower than the ones published in similar studies. The final distribution and concentration of contaminants in vegetables of Zagreb, besides industry and traffic, is affected by the dominant wind direction.\n\nZagreb Regimen, an Abbreviated Intramuscular Schedule for Rabies Vaccination\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRen, Jiangping; Yao, Linong; Sun, Jimin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Zagreb regimen, an abbreviated intramuscular schedule for rabies vaccination, was developed by I.

Since the establishment of the Network in 1997, several series of precise GPS measurements have been conducted on specially stabilized points of Geodynamical Network of City of Zagreb with purpose of investigation of tectonic movements and related seismic activity of the wider area of the City of Zagreb. The Network has been densified in 2005 in the most active region of northeastern Mount Medvednica. Since then, several GPS campaigns have been conducted including the last in summer 2009. The paper presents latest results of geodynamic movements of the network points.\n\nReport of the Third Heart Surgery Forum Scientific Sessions: Zagreb, Croatia December 6-8, 2017: Conference Highlights.\n\nPubMed\n\nFirstenberg, Michael S; Nguyen, Tom C; Roberts, Harold; Levinson, Mark M; Rudez, Igo\n\n2018-02-26\n\nThe Heart Surgery Forum is an online community dedicated to topics related to all aspects of cardiothoracic surgery. It consists of an informative website (www.hsforum.com), a traditional indexed journal both in print and online, and an email-based \"list-serv\" for discussion of surgical cases and techniques. The email list-serv, \"OpenHeart-L\" (The Forum) is composed of surgeons and allied specialties (perfusion, anesthesia, nursing). Dr. Mark Levinson (USA) started The Forum originally in 1995. He also served as the first Editor-in-Chief of the print journal for many years. Coinciding with the popularity of The Forum, and the desire by many members to meet in person, the First Heart Surgery Forum Conference (#1 HSF) was held in Savudrija, Istria, Croatia in 2010. The overwhelming success of this meeting, in terms of attendance and scientific content, resulted in #2 HSF being held in Split, Croatia in 2014. Recently, the #3 HSF meeting was held in Zagreb, Croatia on December 6-8th, 2017. This report highlights the scientific events of this meeting, and more importantly aims to inspire greater involvement by the international cardiothoracic community. Substantial increasing attendance was seen at each subsequent meeting, not only in terms of the number of participants and lectures, but also in the number of countries represented.\n\nFORENSIC SCIENCE:: 20 YEARS OF FORENSIC DENTISTRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAGREB, 1994 - 2014.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrkiÄ, Hrvoje\n\n2014-06-01\n\nData from available literature point to an early beginning of Forensic Dentistry in Croatia relating to a post-mortem examination of a female patient after a dental procedure in the 1930s. Later on, there were several mass casualties due to collisions and airplane crashes and a railway accident at the Zagreb Main Railway Station wherein the identity of the victims was established based on dental features. Foreign experts in forensics helped identify those victims, particularly forensic dentists because this specialty was almost unknown in our region at the time. During the twenty-year period of the development of Forensic Dentistry at the University of Zagreb, the School of Dental Medicine, the city of Zagreb and Croatia have become internationally recognised on the forensic map of the world.\n\n[Usutu virus: a novel flavivirus in Croatia].\n\nPubMed\n\nVilibiÄ-Äavlek, Tatjana; BarbiÄ Ljubo; StevanoviÄ, Vladimir; MlinariÄ-GalinoviÄ, Gordana\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUsutu virus (USUV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis serocomplex. The virus was discovered in 1959 in South Africa and has emerged since 1996 causing epizootics with high avian mortality in Europe. The importance of USUV in humans is not fully understood. However, several human clinical cases of USUV infection described so far indicate the role of this virus as an antropozoonotic agent. In Croatia, serologic evidence of USUV was first documented in 2011 in two horses from Zagreb and Sisak-Moslavina County. In 2012, USUV neutralizing antibodies were found in one human sample from a resident of a Vukovar-Srijem County. Human clinical cases of USUV infection were detected for the first time during the West Nile virus outbreak from July to September 2013. Three patients with USUV neuroinvasive disease were detected in the City of Zagreb and Zagreb County. Our results indicate USUV circulation in Croatia. Further human cases could be expected in the next transmission seasons.\n\nTrends in incidence of lung cancer in Croatia from 2001 to 2013: gender and regional differences\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSiroglaviÄ, Katarina-Josipa; PoliÄ ViÅ¾intin, Marina; TripkoviÄ, Ingrid; Å ekerija, Mario; Kukulj, Suzana\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAim To provide an overview of the lung cancer incidence trends in the City of Zagreb (Zagreb), Split-Dalmatia County (SDC), and Croatia in the period from 2001 to 2013. Method Incidence data were obtained from the Croatian National Cancer Registry. For calculating incidence rates per 100 000 population, we used population estimates for the period 2001-2013 from the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. Age-standardized rates of lung cancer incidence were calculated by the direct standardization method using the European Standard Population. To describe incidence trends, we used joinpoint regression analysis. Results Joinpoint analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in lung cancer incidence in men in all regions, with an annual percentage change (APC) of -2.2% for Croatia, 1.9% for Zagreb, and -2.0% for SDC. In women, joinpoint analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence for Croatia, with APC of 1.4%, a statistically significant increase of 1.0% for Zagreb, and no significant change in trend for SDC. In both genders, joinpoint analysis showed a significant decrease in age-standardized incidence rates of lung cancer, with APC of -1.3% for Croatia, -1.1% for Zagreb, and -1.6% for SDC. Conclusion There was an increase in female lung cancer incidence rate and a decrease in male lung cancer incidence rate in Croatia in 2001-20013 period, with similar patterns observed in all the investigated regions. These results highlight the importance of smoking prevention and cessation policies, especially among women and young people.

The purpose was to evaluate the situation and propose the public health preventive measures. The study population were Zagreb citizens aged 0-64 according to the 2001 census. Total Zagreb population was 779145, making 17.6% of total Croatian population. Data from the Croatian Bureau of Statistics and Dr Andrija Stampar Institute of Public Health were used. The standardized 0-64 mortality rates of the selected diseases 2006-2010 were used in the analysis. In 2010, the standardized mortality rates of all analyzed diseases were significantly higher in Zagreb population aged 0-64 than the EU averages except for cervical cancer. In 2010, the mortality rates in Zagreb population aged 0-64 were as follows: circulatory system diseases 61.22, ischemic heart disease 28.99, cerebrovascular diseases 12.51, malignant neoplasms 94.69, tracheal and lung cancer 24.92, breast cancer 21.08 and cervical cancer 2.05. Standardized mortality rates in Zagreb population aged 0-64 for circulatory system were lower than for Croatia (61.22 vs. 63.25), but higher for malignant neoplasms (94.69 vs. 91.2), except for cervical cancer (2.05 vs. 3.14). High standardized mortality rates for the selected diseases in the City of Zagreb, Croatia, were observed. The rates were higher in Zagreb population compared to EU averages except for cervical cancer. This situation urges revision of the public health strategy and implementation of more intensive preventive and screening measures to reduce the risk factors.\n\nFrequency of tuberculosis at autopsies in a large hospital in Zagreb, Croatia: a 10-year retrospective study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPaviÄ, Ivana; RaduloviÄ, Petra; Bujas, Tatjana; PeriÄ Balja, Melita; OstojiÄ, Jelena; BaliÄeviÄ, Drinko\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAim To assess the frequency and forms of pulmonary tuberculosis at autopsy in a high-traffic hospital in the capital city of a country with a low tuberculosis incidence. Methods We performed a retrospective search of autopsy data from the period 2000 to 2009 at Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Center, Zagreb, Croatia. We also examined patientsâ records and histological slides. Results Of 3479 autopsies, we identified 61 tuberculosis cases, corresponding to a frequency of 1.8%. Active tuberculosis was found in 33 cases (54%), 23 of which (70%) were male. Of the 33 active cases, 25 (76%) were clinically unrecognized and 19 (76%) of these were male. Conclusion Clinically undiagnosed tuberculosis accounted for a substantial proportion of active tuberculosis cases diagnosed at autopsy. Autopsy data may be an important complement to epidemiological data on tuberculosis frequency.

The aim of this paper is to define the frequency of allergic disturbances brought by ragweed pollen in the period between 2002 and 2004, and to devise an action plan for its eradication in the area of Zagreb, as well as in Zagreb County. Thanks to the analysis of common methods of ragweed eradication, even by stating biological ragweed eradication, the best efficiency in ragweed eradication would be achieved through a method that combines several common methods, i.e., a mixed method. In its order on taking measures for obligatory eradication of ragweed, it has stated that the Ministry will ensure funds so that Plant Protection Department in Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Croatia, and Department of Herbology of the Faculty of Agriculture of Zagreb could observe the beginning and continuity of ragweed blossom, make an evaluation on the degree of weed overgrowth, establish how widespread it is in the Republic of Croatia, inform the public via the media on control measures and some other duties, but there is no financial help to those who are selected to eradicate ragweed.\n\nOutpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals: comparison between the cities of Zagreb and Sarajevo (2006-2009).\n\nPubMed\n\nCatiÄ, Tarik; Stimac, Danijela; ZivkoviÄ, KreÅ¡imir; ZeliÄ, Ana\n\n2012-08-01\n\nTo determine the real outpatient utilization of psychiatric drugs in Zagreb (Croatia) and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and to compare the outpatient utilization of psychiatric drugs between this two cities. Data on the outpatient utilization of psycholpetics and psychoanaleptics (N05 and N06) in both cities were received from pharmacies and collected during 2006-2009. Based on the data obtained, a number of DDD and DDD per 1000 inhabitants perday (DDD/1000/day) has been calculated. The data in Zagreb were received from all pharmacies in Zagreb, whereas only 50% of pharmacies in Sarajevo participated, thus an extrapolation of data for Sarajevo was required and accomplished. All drugs were classified according to the ATC system. Based on the data obtained, a number of DDD and DDD/1000/day was calculated for all N05 and N06 drugs. Overall utilization trend was similar between the cities Sarajevo and Zagreb and followed trends in other neighbouring countries. Total consumption of psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics in Sarajevo was 22.6% (on average) lower than in Zagreb, during the 4-year period. During the 2006-2009 period the total consumption of psychopharmaceuticals showed increasing trend with peak in 2008 with similar trend between Zagreb and Sarajevo. It is necessary to implement systematic approach to drug utilization monitoring in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina in general in order to improve prescribing quality as it is done in Croatia.\n\nGenetic characterization of L-Zagreb mumps vaccine strain.\n\nPubMed\n\nIvancic, Jelena; Gulija, Tanja Kosutic; Forcic, Dubravko; Baricevic, Marijana; Jug, Renata; Mesko-Prejac, Majda; Mazuran, Renata\n\n2005-04-01\n\nEleven mumps vaccine strains, all containing live attenuated virus, have been used throughout the world. Although L-Zagreb mumps vaccine has been licensed since 1972, only its partial nucleotide sequence was previously determined (accession numbers , and ). Therefore, we sequenced the entire genome of L-Zagreb vaccine strain (Institute of Immunology Inc., Zagreb, Croatia). In order to investigate the genetic stability of the vaccine, sequences of both L-Zagreb master seed and currently produced vaccine batch were determined and no difference between them was observed. A phylogenetic analysis based on SH gene sequence has shown that L-Zagreb strain does not belong to any of established mumps genotypes and that it is most similar to old, laboratory preserved European strains (1950s-1970s). L-Zagreb nucleotide and deduced protein sequences were compared with other mumps virus sequences obtained from the GenBank. Emphasis was put on functionally important protein regions and known antigenic epitopes. The extensive comparisons of nucleotide and deduced protein sequences between L-Zagreb vaccine strain and other previously determined mumps virus sequences have shown that while the functional regions of HN, V, and L proteins are well conserved among various mumps strains, there can be a substantial amino acid difference in antigenic epitopes of all proteins and in functional regions of F protein. No molecular pattern was identified that can be used as a distinction marker between virulent and attenuated strains.\n\nCaries prevalence among schoolchildren in Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDukiÄ, Walter; Delija, Barbara; LuliÄ DukiÄ, Olga\n\n2011-12-15\n\nTo investigate the prevalence of dental caries and treatment needs in schoolchildren aged 7-14 years from Zagreb. Dental examinations based on the World Health Organization criteria were performed on 1168 children in the period 2009-2010. The teeth were clinically examined with standard dental instruments using visual-tactile method under standard dental light. We recorded the clinical indexes of decayed, missed, and filled teeth (DMFT and dmft; upper-case letters refer to permanent and lower-case letters to primary teeth) and decayed, missed, and filled surfaces (DMFS), as well as the significant caries index (SiC). The median DMFT and DMFS of all children were 3 and 4, respectively. The median DMFT and DMFS of 12-year-old children were 4 and 5, respectively. The highest median DMFT score of 7 was found among 14-year-old children. There was a significant difference between age groups (7-10 years and 11-14 years) in DMFT and DMFS. Among 8-year-old children, the median dmft index was the highest (5.5) and SiC index was 7.4. As far as the location of caries on the surface of the first permanent molar is concerned, caries occurred mostly in the central occlusal surface (27.6%). Our results showed a high caries prevalence among schoolchildren in Zagreb, indicating a need for an extensive program of primary oral health care.\n\n[Croatian Medical Association--Branch Zagreb].\n\nPubMed\n\nKaiÄ, Zvonimir; Sain, Snjezana; GuliÄ, Mirjana; MahovliÄ, Vjekoslav; KrznariÄ, Zeljko\n\n2014-01-01\n\ninevitably reflected in their overall function.

In each park, the samples were taken from several points-at various distances from the roads. The samples were taken at two different depths: 0-5 and 30-45Â cm. Composite samples were done for each sampling point. Microwave-assisted wet digestion of the soil samples was performed and the determination by ICP-AES technique was done. Results obtained for Al, As, Ba, Mn, Ti, V, and K are in a good agreement with the results published in the scientific literature so far. The mass fraction values of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn are somewhat higher than the maximum values given in the Croatian Directive on agricultural land protection against pollution. Be, Mo, Sb, Se, and Tl in the samples were present in the concentrations that are lower than their method detection limit values.\n\nCaries prevalence among schoolchildren in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDukiÄ, Walter; Delija, Barbara; LuliÄ DukiÄ, Olga\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAim To investigate the prevalence of dental caries and treatment needs in schoolchildren aged 7-14 years from Zagreb.

After the Chernobyl accident, D increased steeply by a factor of 3.5, but this is the only prominent feature in the D versus time (t) curve. In the absence of accidental conditions, the D(t) is flat and amounts to 30-35Â pGy/s. Despite the apparent plainness of D(t), its Fourier transform reveals several periodic modulations hidden in the noise. Some of the corresponding periods (6 and 12 months) can be related to seasonal atmospheric changes but this is not the case with the other periods identified (9.3, 13.7, 15.7, 20, 31, and 39 months). These are found to agree well with literature data on periodicities in solar activity, which implies that they are most probably linked to variations in the atmospheric production of (7)Be by cosmic rays.

First-draw and flushed samples of tap water were collected in the morning and total copper concentration was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman-effect background correction. We also estimated the contribution of plumbing material to copper concentrations in tap water. In households with copper pipes, median and range copper values were 310 Î¼g L-1 [(27 to 632) Î¼g L-1] in first-draw samples and 16 Î¼g L-1 [(5 to 52) Î¼g L-1] in flushed samples. Corresponding values for households with galvanised pipes were 140 Î¼g L-1 [(11 to 289) Î¼g L-1] and 8 Î¼g L-1 [(1 to 42) Î¼g L-1], respectively. Copper concentrations in household tap water in Zagreb were far below the proposed safe limits set by the Croatian and WHO regulations and EPA standards, and drinking water in Zagreb is not a significant source of copper exposure.\n\nMicrobiological analysis of a mummy from the archeological museum in Zagreb.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavka, Mislav; GlasnoviÄ, Anton; JankoviÄ, Ivor; SikanjiÄ, Petra RajiÄ; PeriÄ, Berislav; BrkljaciÄ, Boris; MlinariÄ-Missoni, Emilija; Skrlin, Jasenka\n\n2010-09-01\n\nIn this paper we report the results of the microbiological analysis of the samples taken from the mummy from the collection of the Archaeological museum in Zagreb, Croatia.

The analysis indicated that all of the found organisms were non-primary pathogenic and are not harmful for healthy humans. Isolated microorganisms mainly belonged to the group of saprophytic fungi as listed: Monilia spp., Penicillium spp., Alternaria spp., Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Rhizopus spp. and Chrysosporium spp. and to the genus of saprophytic bacteria, Bacillus spp.\n\nOral health attitudes and behavior of dental students at the University of Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBadovinac, Ana; BoÅ¾iÄ, Darko; VuÄinac, Ivana; VeÅ¡ligaj, Jasna; VraÅ¾iÄ, Domagoj; Plancak, Darije\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate oral health behavior and attitudes of dental students in years 1 to 6 at the University of Zagreb, Croatia. The Croatian version of the Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioral Inventory (HU-DBI) was administered to predoctoral dental students, and collected data were analyzed. A total of 503 students (22.3 Â± 2.6 mean age) completed the questionnaire. The response rate was 85.1 percent, and 72.4 percent of the respondents were female. These dental students' answers to eleven out of twenty HU-DBI items differed significantly by academic year. The mean questionnaire score was 6.62 Â± 1.54, and the highest value of the HU-DBI score was in the fourth year (7.24 Â± 1.54). First-year students were most likely to have a toothbrush with hard bristles and felt they had not brushed well unless done with hard strokes. Students in the sixth year were least worried about visiting a dentist and most frequently put off going to a dentist until having a toothache, indicating that rise of knowledge contributes to higher self-confidence. The mean HU-DBI score for these students showed average value, pointing out the need for a comprehensive oral hygiene and preventive program from the start of dental school.\n\nCorruption in the Balkans: An Examination of the Ties Between Government and Crime in Several Southeast European Countries\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-12-01\n\nMatakoviÄ, Transparency in Funding Political Parties: Croatia 2011 ( Zagreb : Transparency International Croatia, 2011), 7, 19; Stevan DojÄinoviÄ et al...compulsory measures that could have forced Zagreb to further reduce its corruption have now been removed.

The study was carried out at three inland sites in Croatia during four years (2003-2006). A number of 2,192 patients have been tested for allergy skin prick tests over the same period. The majority of patients allergic to pollen allergens were sensitized to allergens from the plant pollen which belong to the botanical family of grass 46.91%, ambrosia 42.07%, birch 25.66%, hazel 15.19% (with symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis (42.5%), conjunctivitis (28.3%) and rhinitis (23.9%). Increased symptoms in patients allergic to pollen allergens in the entire study period coincided with the presence of pollen in the air. Patients sensitized to dust mites have symptoms throughout the year with a slightly increased number of cases in April and June. In patients sensitized to fungi and mold spores and animal hairs, the number of cases with worsening of symptoms is equal during the same year.\n\nBla g 1 allergen levels in Zagreb area household dust.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrester, Ljerka; Macan, Jelena\n\n2011-03-01\n\nCockroach allergy is a health problem in many parts of the world. In urban environments, indoor exposure to cockroach allergens involves a risk of asthma. The aim of this study was to measure the mass fraction of Bla g 1, a major allergen of the German cockroach (Blatella germanica) in 30 house samples, collected at random from Zagreb area households, Croatia. Dust samples were collected on cellulose filters by vacuuming living rooms floors. After extraction, Bla g 1 was detected using the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Only four of the thirty households had detectable Bla g 1 levels, and only in one was its concentration higher than 2.0 U g(-1), the threshold associated with sensitisation. The Bla g 1 ELISA proved highly sensitive, with the detection limit of 0.12 U g(-1). The within- and between-assay imprecision was 8.9 % and 14.4 %, respectively, and accuracy 85 % to 120 %. Low Bla g 1 levels in the household dust support previously reported low prevalence of skin sensitisation to B. germanica among Zagreb residents. Further monitoring should reveal if there are differences in cockroach allergen exposure and sensitisation between households from other geographic areas in Croatia.\n\nFactors predisposing to early childhood caries (ECC) in children of pre-school age in the city of Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuliÄ-DukiÄ, O; JuriÄ, H; DukiÄ, W; Glavina, D\n\n2001-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate factors predisposing to early childhood caries (ECC) in pre-school children in the city of Zagreb, Croatia. The investigation was carried out on the sample of 145 children (77 boys and 68 girls) aged between 2 and 5 years, including clinical examination of dental status and survey on the habits among the parents. The overall prevalence of ECC was 30%: in girls it was 25%, and in boys 48%. The study on the risk factors was designed as a classic case-control study. The mean value of dmfs index among the cases amounted to 8.6, in comparison to 5.2 in the control group (p<0.05). Bottle-feeding did not represent a significant risk, but night consumption of sweet beverages after first 24 months and the lack of introduction of teeth-brushing habit after first 24 months did (p < 0.001 for both predictors).

Based on specific questions from available literature, a questionnaire was designed and a total of 270 questionnaires were distributed to the first year students during 2013, 2014 and 2015. A total of 206 students responded, for a response rate of 76.3%. 26.9% of students enrolled in dental studies because it was their first career choice; 16.4% of them believed that it is easy to find a regular job in dentistry. 9.9% of students thought that salaries are high in the field of dental medicine. 45.4% of the first year students were interested in a career in private practice after graduation. These results provide interesting clues to motivation and give additional insights into the expectations of students regarding their studies and profession. The obtained data can be used for the further improvements in the quality of dental study curricula and teaching process.\n\nA six decades long follow-up on body size in adolescents from Zagreb, Croatia (1951-2010).\n\nPubMed\n\nZajc PetranoviÄ, Matea; Tomas, Å½eljka; Smolej NaranÄiÄ, Nina; Å kariÄ-JuriÄ, Tatjana; VeÄek, Andrea; MiliÄiÄ, Jasna\n\n2014-03-01\n\nMost studies analysing the influence of socioeconomic deterioration on body size focus on the impact of food shortages and diseases on the growth in early childhood. To evaluate how socioeconomic conditions influence the growth during the adolescence, we tracked the body size of 15-19 year-olds over the last sixty years covering the socialist period (1951-1990), the war (1991-1995) and the transition to capitalistic economy. This study of Zagreb, Croatia, adolescent population provides information on the secular trend in height, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) and examines their relation with Real Gross Domestic Product. From 1951 to 2010 the girls' height approximately increased by 6.2cm and weight by 6.8kg, while the boys' height increased by 12.2cm and weight by 17.3kg. Prior to 1991 mean BMI in girls was higher than in boys, but from 1991 on, the interrelation between the sexes has been opposite, possibly mirroring the cultural trends that started in mid-1970s and reflecting higher sensitivity of boys to the socioeconomic changes. In conclusion, the secular trend in body size over the investigated period reflects the positive economic trends interrupted by the war. The recent increase in BMI corresponds to the country's economic recovery and indicates the \"nutrition transition\". Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The five contact cases were parents of the vaccinated children and presented with parotitis and in one case also with aseptic meningitis. The etiology of the contacts' illness was determined by viral culture, genomic sequencing, serology and epidemiological linking. Two of the vaccinated children developed vaccine associated parotitis as an adverse event three weeks following immunization. Symptoms in contact cases developed five to seven weeks after the vaccination of the children. The five contact cases, as well as the three children with adverse events recovered completely. The children had been vaccinated with MMR vaccine produced by the Institute of Immunology Zagreb, each of them with a different lot. One of the possible explanations for these adverse events is that the very low levels of wild mumps virus circulation in the last decade, combined with waning immunity in those who received one dose of vaccine or suffered from mumps in childhood, resulted in susceptible young adults and that this unique epidemiological situation allows us to detect horizontal transmission of mumps vaccine virus.\n\nThe profile of scabies patients in Zagreb.\n\nPubMed\n\nKosanoviÄ LiÄina, Mirjana Lana; Quiaios, AndrÃ©; TeÅ¡iÄ, Vanja; Domingues, JosÃ©; SÃ¡, Nelson\n\n2014-12-01\n\nScabies is a mandatory notifiable disease according to Croatian law. Due to an increased reports of scabies within a couple of years in Zagreb, we decided to present epidemiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with scabies in Zagreb. A retrospective survey was carried out in county Public Health Institute \"Dr. Andrija Stampar\" in Zagreb and analysis was performed for the period of 2010-2013 upon individual notifications on scabies cases. The patients are presented by sociodemographic data, diagnosis and treatment. In a 4 year period there were 246 scabies cases recorded in Zagreb. Cases have been registered in all quarters of the City. The highest incidence (50/100 000) was recorded in every child age group following by incidence of over 30/100 000 in elderly institutionalized in nursing homes. In almost two thirds of patients management of scabies has not been conducted in accordance to current guidelines. 10% of scabies cases were found in medical health personnel predominantly in those working in nursing homes and psychiatric wards. A small amount of cases 19 (8%) were infected outside Croatia; the majority of these cases 15 (78%) are registered within last two years. High percentage of scabies cases registered in nursing homes and psychiatric wards suggests that there is a need of raising awareness on scabies epidemiology and management by public health officers. Due to a higher incidence of scabies in children age, the obligation of medical practitioners is also to emphasize the importance of following treatment guidelines. In order to control scabies cases as well to prevent outbreaks within hospital wards or nursing homes there is an obligation of implementation of strict guidelines regarding treatment of scabies and a public health service referral.\n\nMotivation and Career Perceptions of Dental Students at the School of Dental Medicine University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKobale, Mihaela; KlaiÄ, Marija; Bavrka, Gabriela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPurpose Health care studies are usually considered to be complex, demanding and time consuming.

Since it is tectonically very active area and being the Capitol city of the Croatia with very high population density it is of utmost importance to understand those mechanisms and to according to them find the best possible measures for protecting people and valuables. Best results are certainly going to be achieved through the interdisciplinary approach. That is why this paper presents first interdisciplinary results from geodetic, geologic and seismic researches and their contribution to the collective knowledge about tectonic movements in the wider area of the City of Zagreb.\n\nAnalysis of monthly, winter, and annual temperatures in Zagreb, Croatia, from 1864 to 2010: the 7.7-year cycle and the North Atlantic Oscillation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSen, Asok K.; Ogrin, Darko\n\n2016-02-01\n\nLong instrumental records of meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation are very useful for studying regional climate in the past, present, and future. They can also be useful for understanding the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation processes on the regional climate. This paper investigates the monthly, winter, and annual temperature time series obtained from the instrumental records in Zagreb, Croatia, for the period 1864-2010. Using wavelet analysis, the dominant modes of variability in these temperature series are identified, and the time intervals over which these modes may persist are delineated. The results reveal that all three temperature records exhibit low-frequency variability with a dominant periodicity at around 7.7 years. The 7.7-year cycle has also been observed in the temperature data recorded at several other stations in Europe, especially in Northern and Western Europe, and may be linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or solar/geomagnetic activity.\n\nA study on utilization of oral contraceptives in the City of Zagreb (2008-2010).\n\nPubMed\n\nZeliÄ-Kerep, Ana; Stimac, Danijela; OziÄ, Sanja; ZivkoviÄ, Kresimir; ZivkoviÄ, Nikica\n\n2014-06-01\n\nMain aim of this study is to quantify and analyze the utilization and utilization trends of oral hormonal contraceptives in the City of Zagreb, 2008-2010, and to propose potential interventions, if necessary. Data gathered from Zagreb pharmacies were assessed by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification of drugs and Daily Defined Dose methodology. An alarming decrease in total utilization of hormonal contraceptives by 76% from 2008-2009 was found as the main result of this study. A major decrease by 95.5% in utilization of G03AB04 subgroup, sequential combined oral contraceptives, was noted in the year 2009. The subgroup G03AC0, progesterone-only pill group, showed a stable trend, and it became the most utilized subgroup in 2010, due to the decrease in utilization of both fixed and sequential combined oral contraceptives. Utilization of oral contraceptives in Croatia is not regulated adequately, since such dynamics in utilization can occur unnoticed. Measures need to take place in order to improve this situation. Proposed measures include organized farmacovigilance, prescription based on guidelines, and strict screening for risk factors in women seeking oral contraception. More research is required in Croatia to understand the pattern of utilization of hormonal contraceptives and to find the true cause of decrease in utilization of oral contraceptives.\n\nTeaching Classification To Fit a Modern and Sustainable LIS Curriculum: The Case of Croatia.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSlavic, Aida\n\nLibrary classification at the Croatian library school of the Department of Information Sciences, University of Zagreb (Croatia) has an important place in the department's curriculum.

In order to determine if the circulation of different RSV subtypes affects the outbreak cycle, the aim of the present study was to analyze the epidemic pattern of RSV in children in Croatia (Zagreb region) over a period of 3 consecutive years. The study group consisted of 696 inpatients, aged 0-5 years, who were hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections caused by RSV, in Zagreb, in the period 1 January 2006-31 December 2008. The virus was identified in nasopharyngeal secretions using direct immunofluorescence. The virus subtype was determined on real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of 696 RSV infections identified in children, subtype A virus caused 374 infections, and subtype B, 318. Four patients had a dual RSV infection (subtypes A and B). The period of study was characterized by four epidemic waves of RSV infections: the first, smaller, in the spring of 2006; the second, larger, in December 2006/January 2007; the third in spring 2008, followed by a fourth outbreak beginning in November of 2008. The biennial virus cycles were persistent although the predominant RSV subtype in the first two epidemic waves was subtype B, and in the second two it was subtype A. Over a 3 year period of observation, the biennial RSV cycle in Croatia cannot be explained by a difference in the predominant circulating subtype of RSV. Other unknown factors account for the biennial cycle of RSV epidemics in Croatia. Â© 2011 The Authors.

While between 1880 and 1910 Zagreb became a modern European city, World War I (1914-1918) was marked by new municipal regulations that overturned the everyday life of the city. Social conditions reached catastrophic proportions, especially in the later years of the war. Soldiers and refugees swarmed the city, and famine and the Spanish flu epidemic hit it hard. In such harsh social and economic circumstances Milan Rojc, head of the Theology and Education Department and three doctors from the Sisters of Mercy Hospital, namely, Theodor Wikerhauser, Miroslav ÄaÄkoviÄ pl. Vrhovinski, and Dragutin MaÅ¡ek, finally started the School of Medicine in December 1917. The School had formally been founded 43 years before, on January 5th, 1874., when the Croatian Parliament, passed the law concerning the establishment of the University, which was to have four faculties: Theology, Philosophy, Law, and Medicine.\n\nSpread and character of Tomostethus nigritus F. outbreaks in Croatia during the last decade\n\nTreesearch\n\nDinka Matosevic; Boris Hrasovec; Milan Pernek\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe larvae of Tomostethus nigritus F.

It is composed of Quaternary unconsolidated deposits and is highly utilised, primarily as a water supply for the more than one million inhabitants of the capital city of Croatia. To determine the origin and dynamics of the groundwater and to enhance the knowledge of groundwater flow and the interactions between the groundwater and surface water, extensive hydrogeological and hydrochemical investigations have been completed. The groundwater levels monitored in nested observation wells and the lithological profile indicate that the aquifer is a single hydrogeologic unit, but the geochemical characteristics of the aquifer indicate stratification. The weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals has an important role in groundwater chemistry, especially in the area where old meanders of the Sava River existed. Groundwater quality was observed to be better in the deeper parts of the aquifer than in the shallower parts. Furthermore, deterioration of the groundwater quality was observed in the area under the influence of the landfill. The stable isotopic composition of all sampled waters indicates meteoric origin. NETPATH-WIN was used to calculate the mixing proportions between initial waters (water from the Sava River and groundwater from \"regional\" flow) in the final water (groundwater sampled from observation wells). According to the results, the mixing proportions of \"regional\" flow and the river water depend on hydrological conditions, the duration of certain hydrological conditions and the vicinity of the Sava River. Moreover, although the aquifer system behaves as a single hydrogeologic unit from a hydraulic point of view, it still clearly demonstrates geochemical stratification, which could be a decisive factor in future utilisation strategies for the aquifer system.

We describe the results of a survey carried out in December 2001, with an aim to collect and analyze the attitudes of the citizens and health care professionals toward the possibilities and strategies of construction of the University Hospital in Blato, Zagreb. The first referendum on the construction of the new hospital was conducted among Zagreb citizens in 1982, when they agreed that the new University Hospital was much needed. Zagreb citizens confirmed once again their attitudes toward and opinions on the need to continue the construction of new hospital in the city outskirts. By 1992, when the construction of the hospital was halted due to insufficient financial means, Zagreb citizens had already invested over 150 epsilon million in the project. It is interesting that today, 89.4% of the citizens and 74.5% of physicians agree that the new hospital building should be completed. Also, 66.7% of the citizens and 88% of physicians think that this hospital should be a University hospital that could offer the most complex treatments and medical education. To finish the construction of the new hospital further 200 epsilon million needs to be invested. Survey showed that 71% of citizens and 82.2% of physicians think that funds should be raised from some form of credit or budget rather than by special local tax, additional tax or voluntary tax. This project will significantly determine the future of hospital and health care system in Croatia due to its capacities in terms of space, technology, and staff. Before the decision to continue with the new hospital construction be made, the expected future needs, demands, and supply of the health care services in hospital sector in Zagreb and Croatia should be provided using SWOT analysis for each of existing the facilities.\n\n[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia--historical review].\n\nPubMed\n\nPetriceviÄ, Ivan; Kuzman, Ilija\n\n2003-01-01\n\nHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been known from ancient times as a disease with many names, which raised great interest during the Korean war (1951-1954), occurring as a large epidemic (Korean hemorrhagic fever). Therefore, the subsequently discovered causative agent was named after the Hantaan River which runs along the 38th parallel and divides North Korea from South Korea. A similar disease was described in 1934 in Scandinavian countries (epidemic nephrosonephritis or nephropathy). During the Second World War, the disease was also registered as wartime nephritis in several European south-eastern countries. Since 1982, similar clinical manifestations of the disease, differently named in various parts of the world, have been assigned one unique name--hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, as recommended by the World Health Organization. In Croatia, the first patient with HFRS was diagnosed in 1952 and the paper describing the case was published in 1954 (Radosevic and Mohacek). Since then, the disease has been regularly occurring in our country, especially in sporadic form, with only two smaller epidemics recorded until 1995. The first epidemic with 14 forestry workers involved occurred in 1967 at the Plitvice Lakes, and the second with the same number of soldiers in 1989 around the Pieso-Airport near Zagreb. Simultaneously, in 1967 and 1989 two large-scale epidemics of HFRS occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 144 cases each. Until the first large epidemic of HFRS in Croatia during the Croatian War in 1995, occurring at several localities (Mala Kapela, Dinara mountain, west Slavonia), it was considered that there were only several natural foci of the disease in Croatia (around Ogulin and Slunj, Plitvice Lakes, Zagreb surroundings). A total of 125 cases were reported to the Croatian National Institute of Public Health in 1995. Fifty patients, 45 of them soldiers, were hospitalized at Dr. Fran MihaljeviÄ University Hospital for infectious\n\nPrevalence of apical periodontitis and quality of root canal fillings in population of Zagreb, Croatia: a cross-sectional study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMatijeviÄ, Jurica; ÄiÅ¾mekoviÄ DadiÄ, Tina; PrpiÄ MehiÄiÄ, Goranka; AniÄ, Ivica; Å laj, Mladen; JukiÄ Krmek, Silvana\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAim To determine the prevalence of apical periodontitis and assess the quality of endodontic fillings in the population of the city of Zagreb, Croatia. Methods A total of 1462 orthopantomograms from new patients at 6 different dental practices was analyzed during 2006 and 2007. The presence of periapical lesions was determined by using the periapical index score (PAI). The quality of endodontic fillings was assessed according to the filling length and homogeinicity. Data were analyzed using t test and ANOVA with Scheffe post-hoc test. Results There were 75.9% of participants with endodontically treated teeth and 8.5% of all teeth were endodontically treated. Only 34.2% of endodontically treated roots had adequate root canal filling length, while 36.2% of root canal fillings had homogenous appearance. From the total number of teeth with intracanal post, 17.5% had no visible root canal filling. Using PAI 3 as a threshold value for apical periodontitis, periapical lesions were detected in 8.5% of teeth. Adequate quality of root canal fillings was associated with a lower prevalence of periapical lesions. Conclusion We found a large proportion of endodontically treated teeth with apical periodontitis and a correlation between the quality of endodontic filling and the prevalence of periapical lesions. This all suggests that it is necessary to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in order to reduce the incidence and prevalence of apical periodontitis.

Nevertheless, psychiatry in Croatia, as well as in the world, is one of the least attractive specialties for medical students. In this paper we determined the impact of compulsory education in psychiatry on the attitudes of medical students of the fourth year of the Zagreb school of medicine and Osijek school of medicine. We tested attitudes toward psychiatry, psychiatric treatment and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help using questionnaires that were filled out twice, at the beginning of psychiatry placement and at the end of psychiatry placement. Questionnaires were completed by 239 students from the Zagreb school of medicine and Faculty of medicine Osijek (response rate 78.4%). After the placement, students had significantly more positive attitudes about psychiatry and psychiatric treatment, as well as the attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Attitudes towards psychiatry, seeking psychological help and attitude towards psychiatric medication and psychotherapy correlated with the evaluation of the quality of psychiatric education. Additional forms of education in psychiatry should be offered, in order to maintain and increase the impact of education on students' attitudes.\n\n76 FR 19788 - Notice Pursuant to the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993-Telemanagement Forum\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-04-08\n\n...Telematics, Inc., Atlanta, GA; Inducta d.o.o., Zagreb, CROATIA; Infinite Infosoft Services Pvt Ltd, Gurgaon, INDIA; ING Bank N.V., Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS; integracija od-do d.o.o., Zagreb, CROATIA; Intraway Corp...; HughesTelematics to HughesTelematics, Inc., Atlanta, GA; Inducta to Inducta d.o.o., Zagreb, CROATIA...\n\nThe Pattern of Antibiotic Prescribing by Dental Practitioners in Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeriÄ, Marina; PerkoviÄ, Ivana; RomiÄ, Martina; Simeon, Paris; MatijeviÄ, Jurica; MehiÄiÄ, Goranka PrpiÄ; Krmek, Silvana JukiÄ\n\n2015-06-01\n\nBacterial resistance is considered a consequence of misuse or overuse of antibiotics. Dentistry significantly contributes to this increasing public health problem. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the pattern of antibiotics prescribed by Croatian dentists in Zagreb area. Out of 220 Doctors of Dental Medicine (DMDs) from Zagreb 110 responded to survey. Prior to the research an ethical approval was obtained. Participants were directly contacted. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: general data on DMDs and the part concerning indications, duration, type and dosage of antibiotic therapy. Data were processed using MS Excel and SPSS for Windows, Version 17.0. Statistical significance was tested by Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank correlation at the level of statistical significance p<0.05. During the period of two months, the doctors prescribed antibiotics to 1,500 patients, 690 (46%) were men and 810 (54%) women. The most often prescribed antibiotics were penicillin (72.5% of patients), represented mostly by amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid (57.6%). The most common indication for the prescribed antibiotics was periapical or periodontal abscess (44%). Definite clinical indication (71.2%) was stated as the most common reason for antibiotic prescription. Antibiotic therapy usually lasted 7 days (62.9%). The doctors prescribed daily doses of antibiotics according to the instructions for the use of specific drugs. The examined subjects prescribe antibiotics according to the curriculum taught at the School of Dental Medicine for majority of types, doses and duration of the treatments, although antibiotics over-prescription in cases without medical indication was observed. The national guidelines on antibiotic regimens are required in order to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

It is one of the largest collections of developing human brains. The collection serves as a key resource for many focused research projects and has led to several seminal contributions on mammalian cortical development, such as the discovery of the transient fetal subplate zone and of early bilaminar synaptogenesis in the embryonic and fetal human cerebral cortex, and the first description of growing afferent pathways in the human fetal telencephalon. The Zagreb Collection also serves as a core resource for ever-growing networks of international collaboration and represents the starting point for many young investigators who now pursue independent research careers at leading international institutions. The Zagreb Collection, however, remains underexploited owing to a lack of adequate funding in Croatia. Funding could establish an online catalog of the collection and modern virtual microscopy scanning methods to make the collection internationally more accessible.

We analyzed data from obligatory infectious disease reports and notification of deaths due to infectious diseases, data on the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemics in Croatia, and data collected by survey of the population, serological findings, and studies of wild rodents serving as reservoirs of the infection. During the 1987-2001 period, 235 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were recorded in Croatia, with 147 (62.6%) of them among Croatian Army soldiers. Mortality rate was up to 15.4% (mean 2.2%) (5/235). The highest number of cases was recorded in months of June and July, ie, during the warm season characterized by increased activity of both the animals acting as infection reservoirs and humans as hosts. The known natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome have been Plitvice and Slunj areas, Velika and Mala Kapela mountains, Zagreb area (Velika Gorica and Jastrebarsko), west Slavonia, Novska area, and Dinara Mountain. The disease has not been recorded in the littoral area and Adriatic islands. The identified causative agents include Dobrava and Puumala viruses of the genus Hantavirus, whereas rodents Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius, and Apodemus sylvaticus serve as the main reservoirs of the infection. Typical biotopes of the infection in Croatia are deciduous woods. The measures of prevention in Croatia include pest control, disinfection, hygienic waste disposal, preventing rodent access to food and water, proper choice of camping sites, and health education. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome occurs predominantly in soldiers, in a sporadic or epidemic form. Because of the course of disease and potentially lethal outcome, the disease has a considerable impact on the field task performance and combat readiness of\n\n10th International Meeting on Cholinesterases\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-10-01\n\nNATIVE, PHOSPHYLATED AND AGED HUMAN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE Page 9 Zrinka Kovarik ( Zagreb , Croatia): OXIME-ASSISTED...REACTIVATION OF PHOSPHORYLATED BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE Goran Å inko ( Zagreb , Croatia): INTERACTIONS OF PYRIDINIUM OXIMES WITH ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE...OF CHOLINESTERASES IN THE BRAIN Ninoslav Mimica ( Zagreb , Croatia): THE CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS â CURRENT CLINICAL VIEW AND CROATIAN REALITY\n\nActive Reconfigurable Metamaterial Unit Cell Based on Non-Foster Elements\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-10-01\n\nKrois Ivan Bonic Aleksandar Kiricenko Damir Muha University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing Unksa 3 Zagreb ...P"
