        "text": "Croatia is a shining gem of a country nestled in the Mediterranean. Boasting miles upon miles of idyllic coastline, it is perfect for summer getaways spent visiting islands, wiling away the hours on the beach, or exploring the cultural delights of breathtaking cities like Split and Dubrovnik. Much can be said about Croatia year round, and not just in the peak summer months. With its prime location deep in the south of Europe, it enjoys mild weather for plenty of the year. It offers off-season travelers the perfect opportunity to enjoy an authentic experience of the country with minimal crowds, and fewer people wandering in and out of your Instagram shots. But when is the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nWhatever you’re dreaming of from your vacation, this stunning destination is sure to have it. Find out all you need to know about traveling every month of the year, with this extensive month-by-month guide to the best time to go to Croatia. Soak up an unforgettable trip with a stay in one of our luxury Croatia villas. From scenic beachfront condos to sun-drenched ocean-view pool villas, we have the perfect Croatian retreat for you.\n\nCroatia in January\n\nCroatia weather January\n\nJanuary is peak wintertime for Europe. In this part of the world, the temperatures can reach freezing, and even below, turning Croatia into a whimsical winter wonderland. This is the perfect time if you’re hoping for magical city exploration in the glistening snow, as snowfall is highly likely at this time of year, especially inland.\n\nWhat is the temperature in Croatia in January?\n\nCroatia can get very cold in winter, with temperatures plummeting at the start of the year. January weather in Croatia can vary depending on where you visit, however. For example, in Split, which is further south and located on the coastline, temperatures can sink to an average low of 4 degrees Celsius (39F). Further north of the country and inland, temperatures can drop below freezing at times.\n\nBest places to visit in Croatia in January\n\nWe wouldn’t recommend a visit to the seaside destinations in Croatia at this time of year. It is generally ever so slightly warmer on the coast than inland in Croatia, but the difference is minimal and likely unnoticeable. Instead, head inland to destinations such as Zagreb and Osijek, where you can experience the culture of the country, with a good chance of the opportunity to stamp through cobbled streets in the snow. Just make sure you have everything you need for freezing weather, including coats, hats, and scarves.\n\nCroatia in February\n\nCroatia weather February\n\nThe weather in Croatia in February doesn’t warm up much. Winter is still in full swing in this part of the world, meaning snow is still very likely in the northern part of the country, and rain can also occur over an average of 7 days out of the month. Due to the heavy cloud cover, there won’t be much sunshine in February, and the air will definitely have a significant bite to it. If you’re visiting Croatia this month, keep in mind that it will be very cold and you will need to be dressed for a full-on winter at this time.\n\nAverage temperature in Croatia in February\n\nThe temperatures in Croatia remain very low in February. In Split, to the South and along the coast, you can expect the average high to reach 11 degrees Celsius (51.8F) and lows of 6 degrees Celsius (42.8F). For comparison, in Zagreb further into continental Europe, the average high can reach 7 degrees Celsius (44.6F), and go as low as an average of 1 degree Celsius (33.8F), particularly in the nighttime.\n\nIs February the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nFebruary can be a good month to travel for some, though it won’t be the kind of vacation that most expect when they visit Croatia. At this time of year, the weather is still very cold, and there’s a good chance there will be snow cover. You may enjoy exploring the cities of Croatia whilst they’re bathed in snow, as it is exceptionally beautiful. Furthermore, you’re likely to be able to find fantastic deals on all things travel, including flights and accommodation, as most tourists head to Croatia in the summer months. Around Valentine’s Day, a trip to snowy Croatia may be particularly romantic, and traveler numbers could pick up around this time, but otherwise, you will love the fact that the quaint streets are all but yours at this time of year.\n\nBest places to visit in Croatia in February\n\nAs the temperature continues to remain very low in February, we recommend steering clear of the beaches. The water will be extremely cold at this time of year. Instead, like in January, we recommend visiting the cities in inland Croatia, particularly the capital, Zagreb, where you can enjoy a cultural vacation as opposed to a beach vacation. Why not take this opportunity to explore the lesser-known gems of Croatia, such as the stunning village of Motovun, located within driving distance of Pula?\n\nFind villas in Croatia\n\nCroatia in March\n\nCroatia weather March\n\nSpring is beginning to poke out its head after a freezing cold winter in Croatia. Although, it is still quite slow-going and you will find the weather more of that of late winter than early spring. Rainfall is likely to occur on nearly two weeks’ worth of days out of the month, and though the snow is likely to clear up by now, it is not yet sunny, and you are much more likely to see significant cloud cover, as well as an increase in the wind at this time of year.\n\nIs Croatia warm in March?\n\nThe temperature in March is still very low – too low to consider rushing to the beach just yet. Winter takes a very firm hold over this region, and it lingers all the way up until spring. In places such as Zagreb, the temperature starts moving towards the mid-teens, hovering at about 12 degrees Celsius (53.6F) at its average high, and sinking to 4 degrees Celsius (39F) at its average low. Towards the shore, where it gets slightly warmer, the average high almost reaches 15 degrees Celsius (59F), and the lows tend to hover at around 8 degrees Celsius (46F).\n\nIs March the best time to go to Croatia?\n\nIt is still pretty chilly in March! The temperatures are slightly more mild towards the latter half of the month as we come into April, so this is a fantastic opportunity to explore a lesser-known side of this beautiful country. Croatia is a land of stunning landscapes and incredible scenery, so as the temperatures begin to thaw, this is the perfect time to don a good coat, and some thick walking boots and adventure around all the scenic trails this region has to offer. We still wouldn’t recommend a visit to the seaside just yet, though towns along the coast are still open and ripe for exploration. Although keep in mind that these beach resorts are typically seasonal, and you may find a lot of businesses are still closed for the low season.\n\nCroatia in April\n\nCroatia weather April\n\nIt’s springtime! The weather in Croatia in April can vary from very mild and comfortable, with sunshine and nothing more than a slight chill to the breeze, to cold days where you will need a good coat or jacket. Prepare for both eventualities when you go to Croatia in April. Croatia is simply stunning in April when the sunshine does come out, so it’s well worth a visit at this time of year as long as you are prepared for the fairly high chance of rain over several days, particularly in the inland destinations.\n\nWhere to go in Croatia in April\n\nAs the temperature warms up slightly, the capital city of Zagreb really comes into its own. As the first time of the year when you might be able to enjoy some lovely spring sunshine, the city is lit up in a beautiful glow – the perfect time to explore its ancient, cobbled streets. Furthermore, the popular seaside destinations begin to pick up their pace, especially around Easter, as the gentle sunshine brings out some hustle and bustle, without overwhelming crowds. This is a great time to explore places such as Pula and Zadar, to appreciate the cities without the expectation of a beach visit, as it is not quite warm enough for that yet.\n\nCroatia temperature April\n\nThough the temperatures are definitely on their upward curve as we move from winter to spring, it may still be a little chilly, so bring along your coats and jackets. An average high can reach 20 degrees Celsius (69F) particularly later in the month, so you can ditch the layers when the sunshine really makes an appearance. However, the lows can still drop to an average of 11 degrees Celsius (51.8F).\n\nIs April the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nApril is one of the best times to visit Croatia. It is the first month of the year when the temperature begins to climb to a more comfortable level, opening up access to more activities across the country. As spring comes into full bloom, the countryside becomes slightly more temperate – perfect for long hikes with a jacket handy as the sunshine begins to make its presence known.\n\nIn April, the annual Croatia Boat Show takes place in Split, which is a fantastic time to take in the wealth and opulence of some of the most beautiful boats in Croatia that pull into Split’s harbor to enjoy the crisp sunshine of the season. It is this time of year when businesses begin to reopen for tourism, though you can expect the crowds to still be fairly low at this time, and you will be able to find some great deals on your flights and accommodation. This is with the exception of Easter when schools break up and families may be traveling at this time, so crowds may increase – along with prices.\n\nCroatia in May\n\nCroatia weather May\n\nThe weather in May can be absolutely beautiful as we settle firmly into spring and look toward the summer season. There is a higher chance of rain in the northern and more inland parts of Croatia, but the seaside destinations should really be starting to kick off for the peak travel months. Rain is still possible in May, being fully into the springtime, so much like April, prepare for both stunning sunshine and the possibility of rainfall. This is the first time of the year when it is possible to think about swimming on the warmer days of the month, but as it is still not as hot as it is in peak months, take care not to catch a chill by spending prolonged periods in the water. Our Croatia villas with heated pools offer the perfect excuse to enjoy a morning swim during your springtime stay.\n\nTemperature in Croatia May\n\nThe temperature in May increases, offering the fantastic opportunity for beautiful weather without it yet being too hot, and without the crowds that come with the soaring temperatures. The highs in Split can reach 25 degrees Celsius (77F), with lows hovering at around 15 degrees Celsius (59F), particularly in the nighttime. It will become cooler the further north into Croatia you go, so, for example, you can expect a higher chance of needing a jacket in destinations such as Pula, or inland cities such as Zagreb.\n\nIs May the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nWe highly recommend visiting Croatia in May. The sunshine is much more regular and the high temperatures increase to a very comfortable level. The warming spring weather sets the scenery to life, with luscious landscapes and thriving cities, preparing for the peak tourist season.\n\nAlong the shoreline, the beautiful sea begins to make its debut as it glitters and shines, slowly beginning to heat through for the coming summer, though it isn’t quite ready for much more than dipped toes, or swimming for more than a few minutes just yet. As it is still not the peak tourist season, you can enjoy the best of all worlds if you’re lucky enough to travel at this time of year. You can expect low crowds and lovely weather, which means enjoying the beaches as well as the stunning cities that line the coastline without contending with high-season crowds is a very strong likelihood.\n\nBest places to visit in Croatia in May\n\nWe recommend visiting destinations along the coast that strike the perfect balance between stunning cities, cultural sites, and beautiful beaches for you to wander on, as the weather is much better but still not quite guaranteed sunshine. That means if the weather isn’t quite as lovely as you would hope, you could explore the awe-inspiring sites of places such as the incredibly well-preserved Roman amphitheater of Pula and the iconic landmarks of Dubrovnik, made all the more popular thanks to a certain world-renowned TV show. And if the sunshine turns out to be beautiful, you can hit the local beaches at short notice. If you’re visiting Split, you can pay a visit to the Festival of Flowers, taking place at Diocletian’s Palace, a very aesthetically pleasing treat for the eyes.\n\nFind villas in Croatia\n\nCroatia in June\n\nCroatia weather June\n\nSummer is well on its way in June, bringing with it the beautiful heat you would hope for from a stunning Mediterranean destination such as Croatia. Daylight hours soar to 15 a day, which means you can really make the most of your vacation at this time of year. Temperatures steadily increase, bringing with it plenty of sunshine, particularly around the coastal areas. The chances of rainfall are still on a decline, and any rain you experience is likely to be warm and in short bursts. Enjoy the alfresco lifestyle from dawn to dusk, with our Croatia villas with private dining terraces and balconies – perfect for hosting memorable family meals and romantic sunset drinks.\n\nTemperature in Croatia in June\n\nGet ready to ditch those jumpers! You will find the temperatures in Croatia in June perfectly warm and comfortable, with average highs reaching around 29 degrees Celsius (84F), and the lows dipping to an average of around 19 degrees Celsius (66F), but this is mostly in the evenings and nighttime.\n\nWater temperature Croatia June\n\nOn warmer days in June, you can expect the sea to be in great condition for swimming, and it is the first time of the year when watersports can really start kicking off as the rising temperatures make time in the water more comfortable. Though it is still not yet as warm as it will get in the summer, and long periods in the water may be too cold. The sea temperature in Split can reach 22 degrees Celsius (71.6F), while in Pula, the sea temperature can reach almost 23 degrees Celsius (73F).\n\nBest places to visit in Croatia in June\n\nJune is the month to enjoy the seaside destinations in Croatia or locations with easy access to the beach. These include; Poreč, Pula, Rijeka, Zadar, Split, and Dubrovnik, though there are plenty more stunning places to visit that aren’t as quite well known. We recommend these destinations because, in June, you can begin to take full advantage of a perfect beach vacation in a month where the crowds are still low, so you can enjoy plenty of space while you tip your toes in the water, and while away the hours sunbathing. These destinations are also absolutely thriving at this time of year, so once you’re done on the beach, you’ll find plenty of activities, cultural sites, and restaurants to help you create a well-rounded vacation.\n\nIs June the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nYes, June is potentially the best time to travel to Croatia. The temperatures are much closer to that of the summer, but you won’t find the crowds that you do from next month onwards, as many are still at school and work. You can enjoy this beautiful country in its element in a truly authentic way, making the most of both the beaches and the cultural landmarks without knocking elbows with other tourists. This is also the last month before summer when you will be able to avoid peak prices, all while enjoying all the benefits of peak season.\n\nCroatia in July\n\nCroatia weather in July\n\nHello, summertime! Peak tourist season in Croatia is here, bringing with it travelers from all over the world who have chosen this beautiful country as the spot in which to bask in the stunning Mediterranean sunshine. There are plenty of daylight hours, as this is the time of year when the days are at their longest, meaning more time to spend exploring the cities and relaxing on the beaches. The chance of rain is absolutely minimal, so you can enjoy a trip to any destination within Croatia this month and expect perfect sunshine, with plenty of heat to keep you nice and toastie. Make sure you pack the sun cream!\n\nCroatia temperature July\n\nWelcome to the hottest month in Croatia. In Pula, the average high temperature begins to push the thirties, reaching a beautiful 29 degrees Celsius (84F) and with nighttime lows sinking to no lower than 18 degrees Celsius (64F). In the South in Split, temperatures smash through the thirties to reach 31 degrees Celsius (87.8), with the lows staying at a still comfortably warm 22 degrees Celsius (71.6F). You may find some of the islands, for example, Brac, are ever so slightly cooler than mainland destinations, but this only varies a degree or so in Celsius. The best way to keep cool will of course, be by the sea and from the private pool of your Croatia villa – for a truly carefree summer getaway.\n\nBest places to visit in Croatia in July\n\nCroatia is in full summer season in July, which makes one of its best assets, the seaside, the place to be at this time of year. Not only are the destinations along the coast of mainland Croatia perfect spots for beach visits, coffees in cafes in the sunshine, and wandering ancient sites of cultural interest, but Croatia’s many islands are also primed for a visit at this time of year.\n\nThe islands are simply stunning, and there is no better time to visit than in the height of summer when the mainland destinations may get a little bit busier than you’d like. You can reach many of Croatia’s islands by first visiting the mainland and then catching a boat – why not even consider doing a bit of island-hopping, as each is as unique as the last? Pay a visit to the popular islands of Brac, Hvar, or Vis, or head to some of the lesser-known islands such as Silba, Susak, Molat, or Zlarin.\n\nCroatia water temperature July\n\nDon your bathing suits, because the water temperature in July is simply perfect. In Pula, it can reach an amazing 27 degrees Celsius (80.6F), which is an ideal swimming temperature. Elsewhere in Split, it can reach around 26 degrees Celsius (78.8F), and on a Croatian island such as Brac, the water temperature can match Split.\n\nCroatia in August\n\nWeather Croatia in August\n\nThe weather continues to be utterly glorious in Croatia in August. Rainfall is still limited to the odd burst over three days out of the whole month, so you can be relatively confident you will get to enjoy perfect sunshine for most, if not all, of your vacation. August is one of the hottest months of the year as we are still firmly in summer, cloud cover is rare, and the days are beautifully long with plenty of hours of daylight. When looking to stay in August, our air-conditioned Croatia villas with private pools promise to provide a sumptuous retreat for enjoying an effortless summer getaway.\n\nCroatia temperature August\n\nCroatia weather in August is very hot – exactly what you would expect from a Mediterranean country at the height of the summer season. As the second hottest month of the year after July, in Pula, temperatures tend to match those of the previous month, with average highs sitting at 29 degrees Celsius (84F) and lows of around 18 degrees Celsius (64F). In Split, it tends to cool a degree or two compared to July, with highs sitting at an average of 30 degrees Celsius (86F), and lows of approximately 22 degrees Celsius (71.6F).\n\nIs August the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nIf you want to experience just how hot Croatia can get, then yes, August is a great time to travel. The super high heat means that the popular coastal destinations are in their element, with festivals and events put on throughout the month up and down the country.\n\nThere is definitely no shortage of things to do and see as everything is thriving for the tourist season, so you will find a trip to Croatia in August will be utterly jam-packed. For example, why not pay a visit to the Summer Festivals that take place in Split and Dubrovnik? You may, however, want to save your trip for outside the tourist season, such as May, June, or September, when the temperatures are still beautiful, but it isn’t quite as busy as in peak season. You may also find everything is a little bit more expensive in August as travelers away from work and school head to Croatia for a summer vacation.\n\nFind villas in Croatia\n\nCroatia in September\n\nCroatia weather September\n\nPeak season is over as August comes to an end, and as September kicks in, the crowds begin to visibly thin as the temperatures begin to sink. As we move towards Fall, the air cools considerably in the daytime, and can even start to get a little chilly in the evenings and nighttime. Daylight hours are still beautifully long, though the days do start to shorten. You’ll be pleased to know though, that lots of rain is not on the cards yet, and you’re more likely to see sunshine at this time of year. In fact, the rainfall is still limited to showers over a period of around 5 days out of the month.\n\nCroatia temperature September\n\nThe height of summer has passed, and temperatures begin their slow decline as tourist season comes to a close and travelers return to school and work. September is still a great time to consider traveling, as the heat, though it is declining, does continue on from the summer months. In places such as Pula, highs sink to a comfortable 25 degrees Celsius (77F), and lows to a little bit chillier 14 degrees Celsius (57F) in the nighttime, so make sure you have a jumper for the cooler evenings. In Split, for comparison, the highs are the same, but the lows dip to a little bit of a more comfortable 18 degrees Celsius (64F).\n\nCroatia water temperature September\n\nThough the temperature and weather have started on a downward curve as we leave the grip of summer, the sea temperature is still relatively bathlike, having been heated over the last few months with plenty of sunshine. In Pula, the sea temperature can still reach around 27 degrees Celsius (80.6F), which is still a few degrees over what is considered a comfortable swimming temperature. Elsewhere, in Split, the temperature can reach up to approximately 26 degrees Celsius (78.8F). Swimming in Croatia in September is perfectly possible, and still very enjoyable at this time of year.\n\nCroatia in October\n\nCroatia weather October\n\nIn October in Croatia, the daylight hours begin to dwindle, meaning the days are slightly shorter, but there is still plenty of time for exploration. Temperatures drop quite significantly compared to the height of summer, and the chances of rain do start to increase as we start to approach the rainiest month of the year, November, which means Croatia in late October can be a little wetter than earlier in the month.\n\nCroatia temperature October\n\nThe temperature continues to drop, sinking faster as we move through fall and begin to poke our heads into winter. It still isn’t cold exactly at this time of year, but don’t expect high temperatures. Instead, in Split, the highs sit at a very comfortable 20 degrees Celsius (68F) (just be sure to have a jacket handy), and the lows at a chillier 14 degrees Celsius (57F). Elsewhere, in Pula, the highs are the same, but the lows continue to sink to a borderline-cold 10 degrees Celsius (50F).\n\nPlaces to visit in Croatia in October\n\nIf you don’t mind not swimming at this time of year, the beaches are simply glorious, as they will be empty, quiet, and entirely authentic. The gentle sunshine will dance on the waves, and the low heat means it is the perfect time to spend hours wandering up and down the coast and appreciating the beauty of the Mediterranean in Fall. Many of the most popular destinations in Croatia are along the seaside, with plenty of iconic cultural sites for you to explore at this time of year without the risk of overheating. Visit the walls of Dubrovnik, experience the majesty of the Sea Organ in Zadar, or visit the breathtaking stone fort of Tvrdava Fortica on the island of Hvar. Whether you’re craving a sightseeing trip in the Dalmatia region or an island getaway on Brac, our vacation homes offer the perfect home comfort and vacation base.\n\nIs October a good time to visit Croatia?\n\nYes, October is still a fantastic time to visit Croatia. You may need to keep some warm clothing handy, but otherwise, the temperatures aren’t exactly cold, and the crowds will be petering out completely as we move toward winter. This is the perfect time to explore the cultural side of Croatia, as this is a country packed full of stunning cities and towns with architectural marvels and ancient structures. The beaches, while they still may be beautiful when the days are warmer, may be a bit too chilly for swimming.\n\nIf you travel in October, you’re likely to get some fabulous deals on your flights and accommodation, with the exception of the weeks surrounding Halloween. At this time, more people may be traveling again as schools break up for a little while, and for those wishing to experience the holiday in Croatia pay a visit. Also keep in mind, that in a lot of the seaside resorts, some businesses may be preparing to close for the winter, as it is the low season for tourism.\n\nFind villas in Croatia\n\nCroatia in November\n\nCroatia weather November\n\nAs we march ever closer to the end of the year, winter will start to settle firmly over Croatia. Temperatures can drop quite a lot, quite quickly at this time of year, bringing with it quite a crisp chill. As the sunshine begins to fade and the daylight hours keep receding, bringing with it shorter days and longer nights, the chance of rain increases to an average of around one week out of the month, and November is typically the rainiest month of the year. There is also a chance that snow could occur this month, with that chance increasing further into the month we go.\n\nTemperature in Croatia in November\n\nTemperatures plummet in November, bringing with it a rather crips chill up and down Croatia. At this time of year, you will need a coat handy for when it gets too cold in the daytime, and definitely one for the evenings and nighttime when the temperatures really drop. In Pula, the average high can sink to about 14 degrees Celsius (57F), with lows potentially dropping as low as 5 degrees Celsius (41F). Elsewhere, further south, the temperatures can remain a little higher than that, but as a general rule, you will find it to be quite cold no matter where in Croatia you visit.\n\nIs November the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nNovember can be a great time to visit Croatia if you don’t mind getting a little chilly. If you have set out to experience the cultural side of the country, for example exploring the ancient streets of Dubrovnik, the stunning amphitheater in Pula, or the beautiful St. Mark’s church in Zagreb, then you will be able to take in all the sights of the country in relative peace and quiet, as the tourist crowds are likely to be extremely low this year. There’s a good chance of rain in November, but with a waterproof jacket, your cultural journey shouldn’t be too affected. Furthermore, at this time of year, there is an abundance of great deals to be had on everything from flights to activities and accommodation.\n\nCroatia in December\n\nDecember weather Croatia\n\nCroatia is firmly in the grip of winter this month. Temperatures can sink to freezing in parts of the country, such as the capital, Zagreb. There’s also a very good chance of snowfall in these colder regions of Croatia, so if you’re exploring the streets of the capital, you may be doing so as you crunch through a beautiful layer of glittering white. The days are quite a bit shorter at this time of year as the daylight hours can drop to as low as 8 hours in total.\n\nCroatia temperature in December\n\nDecember is one of the coldest months of the year. In Zagreb, the highs in the middle of the day are, on average, around 5 degrees Celsius (41F) – about half that of the average high of November. Its lows can hit freezing – 0 degrees Celsius (32F), so make sure you have your coat, hat, and scarf with you. Further south along the coastline, temperatures can be warmer. In Split, the average high hovers around 12 degrees Celsius (53.6F), and the lows around 7 degrees Celsius (44.6F).\n\nIs December the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nWe think Croatia in winter is fantastic. Though you won’t experience any of the weather associated with this part of the world at this time of year (beautiful sunshine and high temperatures), you can instead watch this country turn into a stunning winter wonderland if you head inland.\n\nThe chances of snow are very high – and even if it doesn’t snow, the capital celebrates the festive period with a huge range of stunning Christmas markets. You can choose new decorations for your tree, sample festive treats such as hot toffee apples and hot chocolate to help warm those frozen fingers, or simply enjoy wandering the lit-up markets casting a stunning glow that dispels the darkness of the evenings. Tourism may pick up once school breaks up for the festive season in late December, but the markets are open from as early as late November, so even early in the month you can get into the spirit of the holidays.\n\nSo, when is the best time to visit Croatia?\n\nIn summary, we think the best months to visit Croatia are May, June, and September. This is because you can sample the beautiful weather the region is famous for, without the extreme temperatures of the summer and without the crowds that come with them. You can choose to head to the coastal areas, where there are more cities than you can count on both hands that are jam-packed full of cultural icons, incredible restaurants, and with easy access to some of the most beautiful beaches in the Mediterranean. You can also pay a visit to the stunning islands of Croatia, and sample a true slice of paradise.\n\nThe peak summer months, July and August are, whilst busy, incredible for experiencing the seaside. The water is bathlike, and the tourist hot spots are in full swing with plenty of events and festivals. If you don’t mind it being a little bit more crowded, then it is still a great time to visit. We also love Croatia in December, particularly the capital city of Zagreb, thanks to its incredible Christmas markets that are definitely worth a look.\n\nThe rest of the year is also great for traveling if you don’t mind a higher chance of rain. This is because tourist crowds are low, and whilst it may not be beach weather, Croatia is an absolute cultural icon, with so many sites and historical marvels to visit, that even in less than perfect weather, you will not run out of things to do.\n\nBook your vacation villa in Croatia\n\nWe hope this article has helped you decide the best time for you and your loved ones to pay a visit to this stunning European country.
