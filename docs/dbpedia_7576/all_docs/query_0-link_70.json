        "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide variations and their correlation with meteorological parameters in Osijek (Eastern Croatia) during the summer seasons of 2002, 2007, and 2012. The measured data are discussed in relation to the EU guidelines (Directive 2002/3/EC, Directive 2008/50/EC). In order to characterize ambient air with respect to ozone photochemical pollution we calculated three photochemical pollution indicators. These indicators may also be a valid measure for harmful effects on living organisms. The influence of local meteorological parameters on the measured concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide was also investigated. We have attempted to establish correlations between measured pollutant concentrations and meteorological parameters using the technique of multivariate principal component analysis (PCA).\n\nSummer Ozone Concentrations in Zagreb Area Ozone concentrations were measured at three sites in Zagreb (Croatia) in the summer of 2005. Two measuring sites were in urban areas, while the third site was in a rural area about 30 km to the south from the centre of Zagreb. Hourly ozone averages varied between 1 μg m-3 and 209 μg m-3. Average concentrations were the lowest in the rural area, even though elevated concentrations were recorded occasionally. However, the weather conditions during measurements were untypical for that time of the year; over the summer of 2005 there were many rainy and cloudy days. Ozone concentrations at all three sites were the highest on Saturdays and Sundays, and the lowest on Thursdays. All the results were analysed with regard to the meteorological conditions (wind velocity and direction, temperature, relative humidity).\n\nHourly ozone, NO x and VOC concentrations, measured during 2001–2003 summer periods , are analyzed in order to examine the interaction patterns between the major photochemical pollutants in ˙ Istanbul. 34 high ozone days throughout the summer periods of the three years are determined and examined in the study together with the meteorological parameters like temperature, wind and vertical structure of the atmosphere. The results show that high levels of ozone are observed mostly under anticyclonic conditions with relatively low wind speeds. High ozone days generally experienced maximum concentrations at afternoon hours and minimum concentrations are reached at rush hours due to NO x – titration by traffic emissions. High negative correlations with NO x up to-0.84 are observed at the Saraçhane station while higher correlations for VOC species, up to −0.75, are calculated for Kadıköy station. Some individual episodes experiencing high ozone concentrations up to 310 μg m −3 in the early morning hours are also studied. It is found that decreasing inversion heights in the early hours of the day led to suppression of pollutants close to surface and thus, an increase in ozone concentrations was observed. Low wind speeds played a major role in the increase of pollution levels in the region. HYSPLIT model is applied to some particular episodes and the results show that the northeasterly transport to the region was dominant, especially in the early-morning maximums.\n\nThe paper presents results of the measurements of the tropospheric ozone (O3) concentration and meteorological parameters: temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, speed and wind direction. The data were collected from January 2016 to December 2016 at station located in locality Centre (Banja Luka), Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ozone is one of the most harmful pollutants to plants and health and highly reactive secondary pollutant. The present study covers investigation of the relationship between the concentration of ozone and meteorological parameters as well as time variations of ozone concentration (by hours, months, seasons). This topic has not been studied up to now in this region, although the recent research data indicates that there is a correlation between them and previously obtained from the world's relevant scientific centres, as already cited above. Statistical analysis confirms string of rolls, which shows directional connection between tropospheric ozone and meteorological parameters, specially temperature (r = 0.148), air pressure (r =-0.292) and relative humidity (r =-0.292). These parameters are the most important meteorological factors influencing the variation in ozone levels during the research. The correlation ozone concentrations with speed and direction of wind is not significant, like other parameters."
