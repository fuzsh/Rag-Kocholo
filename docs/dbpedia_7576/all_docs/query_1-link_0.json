The lowest chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 27% on July 22.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is July 22, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 73% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on December 6, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 67%, while on July 22, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 73%.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Zagreb, the chance of a wet day over the course of July is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 31% and ending it at 27%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 35% on June 13, and its lowest chance is 17% on January 21.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during July in Zagreb is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 2.9 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.5 inches or falls below 1.4 inches, and ending the month at 2.7 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.7 inches or falls below 1.1 inches.\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 2.6 inches on July 22.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of July in Zagreb, the length of the day is decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 52 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 1 minute, 44 seconds, and weekly decrease of 12 minutes, 6 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is July 31, with 14 hours, 48 minutes of daylight and the longest day is July 1, with 15 hours, 39 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Zagreb is 5:10 AM on July 1 and the latest sunrise is 28 minutes later at 5:38 AM on July 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 8:49 PM on July 1 and the earliest sunset is 24 minutes earlier at 8:25 PM on July 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Zagreb during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during July, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:05 AM and sets 15 hours, 44 minutes later, at 8:49 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:34 AM and sets 8 hours, 40 minutes later, at 4:14 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in July in Zagreb\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in July in ZagrebJul112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJunAug001010202020303040405050506000010102020303030404050506060NowNow\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for July 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in July in Zagreb\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in July in ZagrebJul112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMJunAugJun 62:38 PMJun 62:38 PMJun 223:09 AMJun 223:09 AMJul 612:58 AMJul 612:58 AMJul 2112:18 PMJul 2112:18 PMAug 41:14 PMAug 41:14 PMAug 198:26 PMAug 198:26 PM4:26 AM4:26 AM9:19 PM9:19 PM8:57 PM8:57 PM4:47 AM4:47 AM3:59 AM3:59 AM9:06 PM9:06 PM8:34 PM8:34 PM4:48 AM4:48 AM5:11 AM5:11 AM8:48 PM8:48 PM8:10 PM8:10 PM6:31 AM6:31 AM\n\nJul 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 24%1:24 AMENE4:27 PMWNW-8:50 AMS231,834 mi 2 15%1:50 AMENE5:47 PMNW-9:42 AMS233,228 mi 3 8%2:23 AMNE7:03 PMNW-10:38 AMS234,947 mi 4 3%3:05 AMNE8:10 PMNW-11:36 AMS236,978 mi 5 0%3:59 AMNE9:06 PMNW-12:34 PMS239,273 mi 6 0%5:03 AMNE9:48 PMNW-1:30 PMS241,736 mi 7 3%6:14 AMNE10:20 PMWNW-2:22 PMS244,229 mi 8 7%7:25 AMENE10:44 PMWNW-3:10 PMS246,583 mi 9 13%8:35 AMENE11:04 PMWNW-3:54 PMS248,621 mi 10 20%9:43 AMENE11:21 PMW-4:35 PMS250,167 mi 11 29%10:48 AME11:36 PMW-5:14 PMS251,072 mi 12 38%11:51 AME11:50 PMW-5:53 PMS251,221 mi 13 48%12:55 PME--6:32 PMS250,553 mi 14 50%-12:06 AMWSW2:01 PMESE7:13 PMS249,065 mi 15 67%-12:23 AMWSW3:08 PMESE7:56 PMS246,824 mi 16 76%-12:44 AMWSW4:19 PMESE8:45 PMS243,962 mi 17 85%-1:10 AMSW5:31 PMSE9:38 PMS240,678 mi 18 92%-1:45 AMSW6:40 PMSE10:36 PMS237,229 mi 19 97%-2:32 AMSW7:43 PMSE11:38 PMS233,905 mi 20 99%-3:34 AMSW8:34 PMSE-- 21 100%-4:48 AMSW9:14 PMSE12:41 AMS230,997 mi 22 100%-6:10 AMWSW9:45 PMESE1:42 AMS228,749 mi 23 97%-7:34 AMWSW10:09 PMESE2:39 AMS227,319 mi 24 91%-8:57 AMWSW10:30 PME3:32 AMS226,758 mi 25 82%-10:18 AMW10:49 PME4:22 AMS227,016 mi 26 72%-11:37 AMW11:08 PMENE5:10 AMS227,972 mi 27 61%-12:57 PMWNW11:29 PMENE5:58 AMS229,463 mi 28 50%-2:16 PMWNW11:53 PMENE6:47 AMS231,323 mi 29 38%-3:36 PMWNW-7:38 AMS233,409 mi 30 27%12:23 AMNE4:53 PMNW-8:33 AMS235,615 mi 31 18%1:02 AMNE6:02 PMNW-9:29 AMS237,869 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Zagreb is gradually increasing during July, rising from 8% to 12% over the course of the month.\n\nThe highest chance of a muggy day during July is 13% on July 26.\n\nFor reference, on July 26, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 13% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in July in Zagreb\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Zagreb is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 4.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on March 15, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.6 miles per hour, while on August 10, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Zagreb throughout July is predominantly from the north, with a peak proportion of 35% on July 20.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Zagreb typically lasts for 6.8 months (209 days), from around April 5 to around October 31, rarely starting before March 15 or after April 26, and rarely ending before October 11 or after November 23.\n\nThe month of July in Zagreb is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Zagreb\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Zagrebgrowing seasongrowing seasongrowing seasonJul11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%JunAug100%Jul 16100%Jul 16NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablewarmhot\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Zagreb are rapidly increasing during July, increasing by 630Â°F, from 1,168Â°F to 1,798Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Zagreb is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.2 kWh of 6.7 kWh throughout.\n\nThe highest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during July is 6.9 kWh on July 8.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Zagreb are 45.814 deg latitude, 15.978 deg longitude, and 443 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Zagreb contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 538 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 477 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (3,087 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (3,780 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Zagreb is covered by artificial surfaces (100%), within 10 miles by trees (35%) and cropland (34%), and within 50 miles by trees (48%) and cropland (41%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Zagreb, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Zagreb.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Zagreb according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Zagreb is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Zagreb and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nZagreb / Maksimir (LDDD, 96%, 2.7 mi, east, -23 ft elevation change)\n\nCerklje ob Krki Airport (LJCE, 4.0%, 22 mi, west, 66 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Zagreb and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
