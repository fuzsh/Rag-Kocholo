We leave the U.S. on September 3 and return September 17.\n\nI know I can check online weather data sites, but I would also appreciate hearing from people who have been to Croatia and Slovenia in September to hear what kind of weather they had and what appropriate clothing to bring. I don't want to overpack by bringing something that is inappropriate for the season. I know weather can change from year to year, but hopefully it won't be a drastic change. Is September in Croatia still summery, or more autumn like?\n\nIf it helps, we are visiting (in this order) Dubrovnik, Split, Plitvice, Zagreb, and Ljubljana with a day trip through the Julian Alps.\n\nThank you!"
