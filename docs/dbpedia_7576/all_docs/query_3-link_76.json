        "text": "If you want an exciting city break with good weather in March, it would be hard to beat Seville in southern Spain. This is the home of tapas and flamenco, as well as bullfighting, and is packed with beautiful sights and great food. It’s easy to reach with a short flight from the UK and quick transfer into the city centre. Don’t even think about going in July or August – it’s roasting – but March is just about perfect for sightseeing and al fresco lunches. Other cities you may want to visit with warm weather in March include Palermo in Sicily and Barcelona (both 17ºC), and Lisbon and Athens (both 18ºC). Find where else is hot in Spain in March.\n\nWhat’s the best beach destination in March in Europe?\n\nIf you want sunbathing weather in March, your best bet is the Canary Islands, a four-hour flight from the UK. Expect temperatures averaging 22ºC. The Algarve and Cyprus are also strong contenders, both with average highs of 19°C. Both offer bargains in March although the flying time to Cyprus (4 hours 30 minutes) is longer than to the Algarve (3 hours), hence flights a little more expensive.\n\nWhat’s the best European city break in March for warm weather?\n\nSeville in southern Spain is the strong winner. It’s a beautiful compact city, the home of tapas and flamenco with a walkable historic centre. In March you can expect temperatures of 22ºC and 8 hours of daily sunshine. Other excellent destinations in March include Palermo and Barcelona (both 17ºC), and Lisbon and Athens (both 18ºC).\n\nWhat are the sunniest cities in Europe in March?\n\nThe sunniest cities are not necessarily the warmest. If your only focus is on average daily hours of sunshine, the winner is Valletta, the capital of Malta (7.6 hours), followed by Marseilles (7.3 hours), Lisbon (7.2 hours), Athens and Madrid (both 7.1 hours), Rome (6.9 hours), Barcelona, Seville and Valencia (each 6.8 hours) and Nice (6.7 hours). Bear in mind that cities like Marseilles and Madrid may be sunny but will feel chilly in March, with temperatures around 11ºC.\n\nWhere is really hot in March?\n\nJust outside Europe, Morocco is our top pick with 22ºC temperatures and 8 hours of daily sun. It’s only a three-hour flight from the UK to Marrakech. If you want genuinely hot weather, it’s a seven-hour flight to the Arabian Gulf where you can expect 29ºC in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. It’s only six hours to the beaches of The Gambia (34ºC) where you’ll find excellent deals at beach hotels.\n\nWhere is warm enough to swim in March?\n\nUnless you’re a fan of cold-water swimming, European seas are not going to be warm enough in March. A comfortable temperature to swim is around 22-26ºC. To find that you’ll need to travel to a destination such as the Arabian Gulf, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean or South East Asia. For example, Barbados sees average sea temperatures of 26ºC in March. In the Maldives, it is up to 29ºC which feels like a warm bath.\n\nBest festivals in March in Europe\n\nSpain – Las Fallas. Las Fallas in mid-March is a fiery, colourful festival with masquerade parades, fireworks, concerts and paella feasts across Valencia. It culminates in the burning of giant papier-mâché and wood sculptures known as fallas.\n\nPortugal – Festa da Mãe Soberana. The Mother’s Day festival in Loulé features flower markets, handicraft fairs, folk music and a candlelit procession through the streets of the historic town. It takes place on the fourth Sunday of March.\n\nMalta – Feast of St. Joseph. On March 19, this feast day honouring St. Joseph is marked with religious processions and reenactments in the town of Rabat. Locals hand out traditional treats like fried doughnuts to celebrate.\n\nGreece – Independence Day. Military parades, political speeches, concerts and school events on March 25 celebrate the start of Greece’s revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1821.\n\nCroatia – Zagrebdox. This international documentary film festival hosts new releases, retrospectives and workshops for a week every March in the capital Zagreb. See our guide to the weather in Croatia in March.\n\nCyprus – Carnival. Limassol holds a grand carnival parade with floats, costumes and live music to mark the days preceding Lent and Orthodox Easter.\n\nTry another month\n\nOctober | November | December | January | February | March | April | May\n\nIf you don’t mind a longer flight, see our expert guide to where’s hot in March along with detailed climate information about the popular long-haul destinations, including the Caribbean (30ºC), the Maldives (32ºC) and Mauritius (26ºC).\n\nUp to 40% off your next holiday\n\n* Did you know you can save up to 40% on holiday prices?
