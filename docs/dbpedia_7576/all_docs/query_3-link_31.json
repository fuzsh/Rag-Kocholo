        "text": "Wandering when is the best time of the year to travel to Croatia? Without further ado let us tell you that weather in Croatia in October is perfect! That is the time of the year when the crowds are gone and the temperatures become pleasant. Furthermore, especially in the second half of October, the rates of the accommodations get lower and you can easily afford a hotel of higher category and better location. In other words: in October you get more for your money.\n\nLet’s have a more detailed look at weather in Croatia in October compared to summer:\n\nJuly in Dubrovnik October in Dubrovnik maximum temperature 28°C (82°F) 21°C (70°F) average temperature 25°C (77°F) 17°C (63°F) minimum temperature 22°C (72°F) 12°C (54°F) Cloudcover 9% 25%\n\nAs you can see in the table above, the temperatures in October are significantly lower than in the summer which makes strolling the old streets of Dubrovnik more pleasant. Not to mention the absence of the crowds! You can actually enjoy the walk along the famous walls of Dubrovnik without having to avoid other tourists all the time! Don’t be afraid you will miss out on something, as all of the attractions are still open at least until the end of October and so are the restaurants.\n\nThose who travel to Croatia for its beautiful beaches and summertime fun, will of course prefer the months of June, July, August or even September, but if you are vising this Mediterranean country mostly for its cultural sights, October should be your preferred option. Thanks to its mild climate, the region of Dalmatia is popular throughout the year. Yes, it’s true you might get a bit wet, but the chances of rain on the Adriatic coast are significantly lower than in the hinterland.\n\nAnother advantage of vising Croatia in autumn, especial in the late October, is the picturesque scenery created by colourful trees. One of the best places to admire them is defiantly the Plitvice Lakes National Park*, which gets a totally different image worth seeing in person.\n\nSpeaking of the island of Hvar – did you know it holds the record in having the highest number of sunny days in the country? It gets an average 2,674 hours of sunshine per year – October included! Besides it is also one of the most beautiful Croatian islands, so the overall experience should be very rewarding. Its rich culture and the beauty of its natural environment along with the amazing Mediterranean gastronomy will make you want to expand your stay until November.\n\nThe weather in Croatia in October is great for sightseeing\n\nDid we convince you that the weather in Croatia in October is great for cultural tours?
