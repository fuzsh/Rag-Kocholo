        "text": "The climate of Croatia\n\nCroatia mostly has a humid continental climate with hot summers and cold winters (Köppen climate classification Dfb) in the northern Pannonian Plains, a cold and snowy alpine climate in the central Dinaric Alps at altitudes above 1200 meters and Mediterranean (Csa) along the Adriatic coast and the outer islands. The remaining minor part of the country borders between humid subtropical (Cfa) and oceanic (Cfb) climate types. Summers range from warm to hot, while winters are cold except in the coastal regions. Croatia shares borders with Slovenia in the northwest, Hungary in the northeast, Serbia in the east and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in the southwest. The temperate latitudes, altitudes, and distance from the Adriatic Sea primarily influence the climate.\n\nCroatia has a diverse geography that consists of the northeastern plains of Slavonia, the hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje, the central Dinaric Alps and the southern coastal region with many islands and islets that are part of the country. Major rivers such as the Danube, Sava, Kupa, and Drava traverse the country and create fertile lands, while karst formations make up a significant portion of the mountains. The country is home to numerous lakes, and deep caves and the forests are rich with a biodiversity of flora and fauna. The climate supports various habitats including wetlands, forests, grasslands, bogs, fens, coastal and marine. The famous Plitvice lakes exhibit exhilarating watercolors that range from green and blue to turquoise.\n\nThe best time to visit Croatia\n\nThe best time to visit Croatia is from May to September, while July and August are best for beach holidays.
