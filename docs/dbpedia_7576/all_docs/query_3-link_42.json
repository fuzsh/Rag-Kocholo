        "text": "I have lived in Croatia for over ten years, and when people ask me, “What is Croatia like in September?” I say over and over again, “It is the best!”\n\nHands down. The best month to travel to Croatia is September because the crowds have dissipated, prices have reduced a little, and the weather is still sunny and gorgeous.\n\nJuly and August are pretty hot and busy months to visit anywhere in Europe. Not only do you sweat for most of the day and night (even with air conditioning), but you can’t really get out and see what you want to see because there are so many other people trying to do the same things.\n\nTake Dubrovnik, for example. There’s no way you’ll see everything if you visit during July or August.\n\nAnd it’s for this very reason that I love being in Europe in September.\n\nFor me, it’s the ideal piece of middle ground. The weather is still warm, but it’s cooled enough to avoid constant sweat patches, and the evenings are a little more comfortable for sleeping. In addition, prices are a little lower, and even better, there are fewer crowds, so I can get out and explore much more quickly.\n\nIt’s a win-win all around, really.\n\nNow, I appreciate that if you’re traveling with school-age children, this isn’t going to be possible for you as they’ve gone back to school at this time…\n\n…..but if you’re child-free, or your children are young enough not to be in school yet, September is the ideal time to head to Croatia and explore to your heart’s content.\n\nLet’s explore why I love the match-up between Croatia and September.\n\nWhat To Expect In September In Croatia\n\nThe best time to travel to Croatia is September, and one of the reasons is that you get all the perks of summer but with fewer crowds, lower costs, and less stifling heat.\n\nThe other plus point is that if you want to go to Dubrovnik, you’ve got more chance of actually enjoying yourself without getting stressed by the crowds. There are fewer cruise ships at this time of year, especially mid to late September, so that means people.\n\nWe all know it’s not much fun to walk around when it’s really hot, and that’s why September is good too.\n\nYou can actually get out and see things; walking around means you get to find hidden gems, and you can do that at this time of year, while locals have a lot more time, so you’re more likely to meet people and learn from them.\n\nJuly and August also mean much higher prices, and especially in the second week of September onwards, you can find much cheaper deals. And don’t worry; it’s still very much summer at this point; it’s just slightly tailing off from the craziness of peak season, which is never that much fun if you ask me.\n\nWeather In Croatia In September\n\nwhen visiting Croatia in September you’ll need know a few things about the weather.\n\nIf you visit at the start of September, the heat will still be on, with temperatures around the mid-30s. It’s not like August ends, and someone flicks a switch! However, as the month progresses, you’ll see a definite cooling effect, and it’s very welcome.\n\nRemember, Croatia has slightly different weather across the country.\n\nMost people tend to go to the Dalmatian Coast, where the sun is hottest, and the sea is ideal for swimming, and that’s still totally possible in September. The season runs from May until the middle of October, so everything is still open, with a much cooler effect.\n\nDubrovnik, Split, and Hvar still see temperatures around 30 degrees at this point, and the sea is around 23 degrees – ideal for swimming and long beach days. Evenings are much more comfortable at about 20 degrees and sometimes a couple of degrees lower, especially as the month progresses.\n\nIf you want to visit the north-western region of Istria, it will be a little cooler than the south coast but still very warm, and it will be much easier to walk around and try wineries and local produce centers.\n\nZagreb is also delightful during September, as it’s much cooler and a lot easier to walk around.\n\nBrands We Use And Trust\n\nBest Places To Go In Croatia During September\n\nAll major tourist areas of Croatia will see a slight drop in prices as September arrives, which will continue as the month goes on. It’s possible to get a terrific deal at his time of year, which means you can stay in a high-quality hotel for a fraction of what it could cost in July and August.\n\nHere are some of the best places to check out during September:\n\nDubrovnik In September\n\nThe number one spot would be Dubrovnik. As mentioned, you can hardly move during peak season, which doesn’t lend itself to an enjoyable time. As September rolls in, it’s much easier to explore, and you can walk around those famous walls and take photos without having a crowd of strangers invading your snap.\n\nSplit In September\n\nSplit is also a great place to visit in September, and you’ll have more beach space while exploring the UNESCO Old Town and Diocletian’s Palace a lot easier. You can also ferry to Bra, Korcula, and Hvar.\n\nHvar In September\n\nSpeaking of Hvar, at this time, a lot of the party-made people have gone home or back to university, so you’ll find it a lot calmer, although still a great place to visit. Beaches will be a little quieter, and it’s much easier going with a chilled vibe.\n\nKrka National Park In September\n\nIf you’re into nature, you must also head to Krka National Park. As September progresses, the leaves slowly begin to change color, and you can explore the park and the seven waterfalls more easily, following the many nature trails.\n\nIstria In September\n\nIstria is fantastic during September as this is harvest season and an especially great time for truffles and olive oil.\n\nMedvednica Nature Park\n\nYou could head to Medvednica Nature Park in the center of the country and go mountain biking or trekking. With the temperatures cooler, it’s much easier to do, but not too cold at the same time.\n\nFestivals In September\n\nThere are several events and festivals that take place during September, and if you happen to be in Croatia for any of them, try and check them out if you can.\n\nGoulsash Disko, 13-17 September – A fun and chilled music festival on Vis Island.\n\nCroatian Walking Festival, early September – Events and competitions take place on several walking trails around Lika-Senj County, and it’s a great way to check out the local countryside and scenery.\n\nInternational Puppet Festival, early September – Zagreb sees the 56th International Puppet Festival this September, with both local and international performances\n\nSton Wall Marathon, 24 September – If you’re feeling energetic or you want to watch, head to Southern Dalmatia for the Ston Wall Marathon.\n\nSo, Is Croatia In September A Yes?\n\nPersonally, I would say go for it. It’s cheaper, cooler yet still very warm, more comfortable at night, and there are fewer crowds. That’s the perfect combination, in my opinion."
