        "text": "Weather\n\nJuly is Croatia's hottest month of the year, averaging 84°F (29°C) in Dubrovnik and 88°F (31°C) to 82°F (28°C) further up the Dalmatian coast in Split and Zadar, respectively. In the evenings, temperatures cool off to a welcoming 64°F-70°F (18°C-21°C), so you will want to pack light layers with your swimwear and sunscreen.\n\nTemperatures aren't much different in and around Zagreb, with daily averages of 81°F (27°C), though you won't have the breeze off the Adriatic to cool you down. The center of the country, in the Dinara mountains, can expect slightly cooler temperatures, and the country as a whole sees little rain this time of the year.\n\nCrowds & Costs\n\nJuly is certainly the busiest time of the year, and for good reason, as the weather is beach-perfect, the party season is in full swing, and ferries to the islands are at their most frequent. Croatia's coastline sees the height of the country's tourism, while the inland cities' cultural and social activity tends to lessen as a result. And with the significant pressure on facilities elsewhere, travelers should be aware that hotels and restaurants book up months ahead of time, so advance planning is recommended. For alternate accommodations, consider any of these boutique hotel options in Dubrovnik.\n\nWhere to Go\n\nThe coast is where all the action is in July. Take advantage of the great weather and head to any number of the literal thousand islands for swimming, sailing, kayaking, and any other outdoor activity you can think of. Accessed from several locations, the historic cities of Split and Dubrovnik are great options to reach nearby islands. Visit Brač and Hvar and Hvar's nearby Pakleni Islands from Split in central Dalmatia or the Elafiti Islands and Korčula from Dubrovnik in southern Dalmatia. Another great option is to head further north along the coast to the western Kvarner islands, Cres and Lošinj, before cutting inland to beat the heat and tour the Istrian Peninsula and Zagorje and its many castles.\n\nWhile the coast is buzzing with foreign and local tourists, heading further inland to Zagreb for a little cultural quiet is a great alternative. There are plenty of restaurants, museums, and festivals worthy of your attention that aren't over-stuffed with tourists.\n\nFor more on where to go, read this article on Top Regions in Croatia.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nJuly is all about the beach vacation and the party scene, where Croatia is proving itself to be the festival destination in Europe, with numerous cities across the country hosting multi-day festivals of all types, like theater, film, traditional culture, and music (see below for further event options). Without preemptive planning, you will most certainly be able to catch a classical music performance held nightly in towns like Lubenice with alfresco concerts held every Friday or Zadar with concerts held in St. Donatus' Church. Art lovers will appreciate visiting Split to check out its month-long art festival, Split Summer, beginning in the middle of the month.\n\nTennis fans will enjoy the Croatia Open, which takes place annually and is part of the ATP World Tour for 10 days in mid-July in Umag. And all along the coast, open-air theaters and venues put on outdoor productions on their beaches.\n\nKayaking and sailing tours are popular activities to participate in during July. Explore Dubrovnik from the water and go on a half-day guided kayaking tour around the city and Lokrum Island—the closest island to Dubrovnik. Or join a sunset kayaking tour and paddle to the wooded and rocky islets of the Pakleni Islands. Charter a sailboat or catamaran for a week and head up the coast from Dubrovnik to Split, visiting the many islands in between. Consider stopping in Mljet to rent a bike and ride through its unspoiled western side of the island or lounge on one of its lush coves.\n\nFor more sailing information, read this Ultimate Guide to Sailing in Croatia or check out The Secrets of Croatia's Wine Country.\n\nEvents in July\n\nHideout, Zrće. An electronic dance music (EDM) festival in Zrće takes over the beach bars and clubs in late June and early July.\n\nUltra Europe, Split. Taking over Split's Poljud stadium for three days in July and featuring celebrity DJs, Ultra Europe is one of the world's largest electronic music festivals. Afterward, the parties continue for the rest of Destination Ultra Croatia Music Week, including Ultra Beach, a pool party at Hotel Amfora the following week, and Destination Ultra Regatta, a heart-thumping beach party on Zlatni Rat beach on the following Monday.\n\nCourtyards, Zagreb. For a solid 10 days, Zagreb's historic Upper Town courtyards, typically off limits the rest of the year, open their doors for a succession of concerts and performances.\n\nLabin Art Republika, Labin.
