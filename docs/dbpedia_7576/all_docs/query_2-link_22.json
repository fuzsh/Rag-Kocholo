        "text": "Other answers and comments mention axial tilt, and I agree that should be part of your thought process. You might also add something akin to the El Nino - La Nina cycles.\n\nOn an irregular but roughly seven-year oscillation, Pacific Ocean currents change from relatively warm to relatively cold. With that, unusual weather patterns occur. The effects are observed especially in North America, but can be noticed around the world.\n\nFor your story or game, place your world as far/ near the ocean currents as you need, then adjust the amplitude / frequency / regularity of the cycle.\n\nI live in Ottawa, Canada. It's currently -11C and there's about 4 feet of snow on the ground. Winter lasts about 4-5 months (november - march).\n\nIn June, July and August, it's summer and the temperatures here are usually anywhere between +20C and +40C.\n\nBasically, the climate you're describing is completely possible, the 3 big factors are axial tilt of the globe (assuming the planet is a globe and orbits a sun), latitude of the area in question and altitude (or rather how high/low the area is from sea level).\n\nIf you put the place on the equator, then there won't likely be snow (except high in the mountains) and it will probably always be quite warm. If you put the area on the poles, it will be a frozen glacier year round basically.\n\nI live in central Utah, which is a desert. Here the temperature varies from 110F in the summer to 0F in the winter. (These are the hottest and coldest times of the year and of the day.) I think your situation is probably just as plausible. If this planet isn't earth you could increase the planet's tilt, and that would make seasons more extreme.\n\nI live in northern Italy. Temperatures in winter can easily drop below -5°C for days on hand, and they're usually 35°C or more in the summer.\n\n95% humidity doesn't help either.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more extreme, check out the area of Croatia between Rijeka and Zagreb. (follow the highway.)\n\nIn the summer temperatures are 35° as well (try being stuck in traffic in a black car...), and in the winter it drops to -25.\n\nCanberra in Australia has that, summer maximums of 30-35 and winter minimums of 0 to -5. There are frosts daily during winter, and very occasional snow.\n\nKey ingredients:\n\nA long way from the ocean - oceans act to moderate temperatures.\n\nSurrounded by mountains on the north, east and west (Southern hemisphere) or South, east and west (Northern Hemisphere). These mountains, assuming the location is far from the equator, will block a greater % of the sunlight in winter than summer, because the sun is lower in the sky.\n\nI think if you moved the entire of Australia South, such that Canberra lined up with where Hobart is now, and removed the man made lake, you would get extremely similar results to what you want."
