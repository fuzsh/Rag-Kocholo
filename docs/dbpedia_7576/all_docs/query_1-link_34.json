        "text": "When to go to Croatia?\n\nCroatia has a Mediterranean climate along its coastline with mild winters, around 50°FF and hot, dry summers of around 86°FF Inland, the climate is continental with harsher winters, 41°FF in Zagreb in January, and warmer, more humid summers than on the coast. Along the Adriatic coast between Istria and Dalmatia, the climate is mild in winter and rather humid with daytime temperatures reaching 53°FF in January in Dubrovnik. During this period, the bora, a freezing wind from the northeast, blows, cooling temperatures. In spring, temperatures are pleasant, ranging from 68°FF to 77°FF between May and June and the air becomes drier. It is a pleasant time to visit the country. In summer, it is very hot and dry with temperatures that can exceed 86°FF on the coast in July and August. In autumn, the weather remains mild and temperatures are still pleasant with 68°FF in the south of Dalmatia. The sea temperature varies between 57°FF in winter in January and 77°FF in summer in Split. Swimming is therefore very enjoyable in Croatia, especially during the months of June to September when the average temperature is 75°F. The mainland climate is continental with cold temperatures in winter and warm, rather humid summers. In Zagreb, the thermometer will not exceed 41°FF during the day in January with negative temperatures at night. In altitude, the snow will be there and there are some ski areas where you can practice skiing in Sljeme and Platak. In summer, temperatures on the plains are quite hot with maximum averages of 80°FF and it is not uncommon for such days to end in a storm. The most pleasant time to travel to Croatia is between May and September. The sun will be out to visit the countryside or relax on the Adriatic coast. And for those who prefer to escape the summer crowd, spring and autumn are two perfect seasons to discover Croatia with its magnificent Plitvice lakes, its coast and its beautiful coves and architectural jewels.\n\nTemperature and climate in:\n\nBelec | Cavtat | Dubrovnik | Grožnjan | Hvar | Korčula | Lastovo | Makarska | Medulin | Nin | Omiš | Pag | Poreč | Pula | Rab | Rovinj | Šibenik | Škrip | Solin | Split | Trogir | Umag | Varaždin | Veli Losinj | Viganj | Zadar | Zagreb |\n\nThe weather month by month in Croatia\n\nJanuary\n\nFebruary\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nDecember\n\nWeather Zagreb in January\n\n28 to 41°\n\nSea: 32 °\n\n6 d/month\n\n6 d/month\n\n5 d/month\n\n5 d/month\n\n5 d/month\n\n2 d/month\n\n2 d/month\n\nIn January, in Zagreb, temperatures range from -2 to 5 degrees.
