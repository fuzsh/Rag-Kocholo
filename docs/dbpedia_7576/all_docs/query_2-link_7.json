        "text": "Wondering what is weather in Croatia like? We will give you a full insight for all seasons and regions.\n\nDalmatian coast\n\nAlong Dalmatian coast we boast long hot summers and fairly mild winters. Rainfall is generally moderate year round towards the north, and in the south follows the Mediterranean dry summer / wet winter pattern.\n\nMost popular months to visit this region are from June to September. Summers along the coast and islands can see between 10 and 12 hours of sunshine per day, with temperatures typically always in the high 20°C and pushing up to low 30°C.\n\nHumidity usually lies around 60%, but the refreshing sea is never too far away. Summer is the driest season along the coast and winter is the rainiest season, with twice the amount of precipitation as the summer. In winter, the coast has a temperature of 2°C in the north and 9°C in the south of Dalmatia.\n\nThe coastal climate is also characterized by its winds. The most frequent wind in Dalmatia is the south-east Jugo. It comes toward the mainland in autumn and winter, bringing a warm air. Bura is north-east cold and dry wind coming from mainland in sudden and powerful gusts, bringing dry air and cooler temperatures. The westerly Maestral is a pleasant summer wind that blows in from the sea, reaching its peak force in early afternoon.\n\nCroatian inland\n\nThe Croatian inland, including places such as Zagreb and Slavonia, has a continental climate, usually meaning hot summers with lack of sea breeze, and much colder winters with particularly heavy snow. Because the interiors are separated from the coast by Dinaric Mountains, winters range from 0°C to -2°C. The approximate temperature in the summer is around 22°C, although typically feeling much hotter with more frequent heat waves.\n\nThe mountains of Croatia such as Velebit range and Medvednica are cooler and get more precipitation. Here, the winter temperature ranges from -2°C to -4°C, with snow common in higher elevations. In summer, these mountains remain a temperate 10°C to 18°C.\n\nHere are some examples of the weather in major Croatian cities year round.\n\nSplit: Most rainfall is seen in May, June, October, November and December. On average, the warmest month is August. The coolest month is January. June is usually the wettest month. August is the driest month.\n\nDubrovnik: Most rainfall is seen in January, February, March, April, September, October, November and December. On average, the warmest month is July.
