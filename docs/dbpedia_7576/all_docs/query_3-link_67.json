        "text": "Parts of Europe are scorching as a second heatwave in as many months brings record-breaking high temperatures, prompting governments to issue health alerts urging people to keep cool.\n\nThis month's heat has, much like June's soaring temperatures, caused forest fires, buckled train tracks and led to warnings over air quality and water shortages.\n\nA red alert has been issued in France - with temperatures hitting 40.6C in Paris - while Belgian, German and Dutch temperature records could be broken for the second time in two days.\n\nLast month, France set an all-time high-temperature record of 46C, and new highs were set in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany - making it the hottest June on record.\n\nAs the mercury continues to rise, experts tell the BBC why we should expect heatwaves to become more frequent.\n\nHeatwaves are not uncommon, but according to weather experts they are being amplified by a rise in global temperatures and are likely to become more frequent - one of the more predictable impacts of our warming climate.\n\nA climate specialist at the UK's Meteorological Office, Grahame Madge, told the BBC that, while weather variations occurred naturally, the world was about one degree warmer than pre-industrial levels and, as a result, extreme weather was becoming more likely.\n\n\"Now when we get a heatwave, it is likely to be a degree or so more,\" he said. \"They are still extreme events, but they are also becoming more frequent.\"\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of a heatwave, due to variations in climate conditions in different world regions. Typically though, they are defined by an unseasonably hot period - usually five degrees or more above the average daily maximum - that lasts at least three days.\n\nOther factors considered by analysts, Mr Hewson said, included night-time temperatures, humidity and wind speed. Both humidity and low wind speeds can enhance a heatwave. The effects can be particularly extreme in large cities due to increased human activity and a mass of buildings, concrete and roads.\n\nNations with hotter climates, such as Australia and countries in North Africa and across the Middle East - where summer temperatures can often reach 50C - can still struggle with extreme weather.\n\n\"Their infrastructure might be able to cope with higher temperatures in general, but with anything away from the norm, everywhere struggles,\" Mr Madge said.\n\nWhen asked how they keep cool in extreme heat, BBC colleagues living in Nigeria, Tanzania, Yemen and Brazil had the following advice for countries with more variable climates:"
