In May the average sea temperature is 16, in June 22, in July 24, in August 25 and in September 23 degrees Celsius.\n\nSea temperature in Croatia is also at vrijeme.hr.\n\nClimate, weather in Croatia\n\nCroatia has a pleasant Mediterranean climate. In Croatia there are hot and dry summers, there are many sunny days. The hottest weather is on the coast in July and August, temperatures in the shade may exceed 33 degrees Celsius. It is the least raining on the Croatian islands, hot weather reduces the winds - so the islands are very popular with tourists. The most beautiful weather is downwind boron. Weather in Croatia varies in the north and south coast, but the difference is not great. The average length of sunshine in Croatia is in May 8, in June 10, in July to 12, in August 11 and in September 9 hours.\n\nCroatia is very diverse in many ways because of its location and layout. One of them is the diversity of weather. Croatia is a country on the 45th parallel of the north latitude (passing through Plitvice Lakes, Cres Island, Istria north of Pula). The climate is based on two types - continental and Mediterranean. In the mountainous regions of the Dinaric system we will encounter the mountain climate (Velebit, Snježnik, Risnjak) with typical alpine fauna and flora. The weather conditions in individual regions of Croatia often have very different meteorological phenomena related to various geographical conditions in the territory of Croatia.\n\nEven in continental areas (Slavonije and Baranje, Northern Croatia) we can perceive differences in weather dependent on altitude. Slavonia and Baranje have a similar climate and agricultural use as southern Moravia.\n\nSlavonia and Baranja\n\nThe area can be geographically defined as a very fertile area extending from the river Ilova, across the lowlands around Drava and Sava to the border with Hungary in the north. Another border is then with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Slavonia due to its natural conditions has always been a prosperous territory, the change occurred after the last war, when this area was greatly affected by war operations. The most important cities: Vukovar, Osijek, Ilok, Baranja.\n\nNorthern Croatia\n\nThe area can be geographically demarcated between the Sava River in the southeast, the Drava in the northeast, Slovenia in the northwest, and the River Il. It consists mainly of fertile lowlands, where grain, vines, vegetables and industrial crops are grown. In connection with this inland area you can find further subdivision (Croatian Zagorje, Međimurje, Baranja - Kordun). The capital is Zagreb, Krapina (with its spa), Karlovac (with ski slopes), Sisak (Lonjsko Polje Nature Reserve), Veliki Tabor, Varaždin (magical spa town).\n\nIn addition to the inland, the continental climate has a mild continental climate (Istria, Kvarner and islands). Mean temperatures in January range from 2 ° C in the north to 9 ° C in the south. Temperatures drop from coast to inland (isotherms run parallel to the coast) and from south to north. In the winter months, the continental part of Croatia has a mean temperature of mostly 0 to -2 ° C. On the peaks of the Slavonian mountains and Medvedice are temperatures from -2 to -4 ° C. The mountain part of Croatia has a mean temperature of -2 to -4 ° C in winter and a mountain range of over 1 500 m.n.m. from -4 to -6 ° C. In the summer months the mean temperatures in the continental part of Croatia are 22 ° C. In the Slavonian mountains, in Medvedica and in the Zagorje mountains they are slightly lower (2 ° C) and in eastern areas (Srijem) higher (22 ° C). The mountain parts of Croatia are in the middle of July from 1 to 18 ° C. Stony fields and river areas from 18 to 20 ° C. The coastal part of the country has a mean July temperature between 24 and 26 ° C.\n\nThe Adriatic coast and islands belong to the Mediterranean climate area. These areas have short mild winters and long warm summers. The climate of coastal areas is under the influence of the sea, but there are differences. The island climate (the Central and South Dalmatian islands are the hottest places with the most hours of sunshine) differs from the continental one, the differences are evident from Pula to Dubrovnik. The whole coast is protected from the inland from the mountains of the dinar system. Although there are places that are visited all year round on the Croatian coast, the best time to visit is from April to October. In spring there is more rainfall and the water temperature is lower, but most of the local vegetation blooms and the Mediterranean nature offers its most beautiful face. In the summer months the air temperature rises up to 40 ° C and the water temperature is around 25 ° C. You will not overlook if you stay in September, often even in October. Autumn is stable and the climate is influenced by the accumulated heat of the sea.\n\nRainfall in Croatia\n\nThe average annual rainfall is between 600 mm and 3,850 mm. Most precipitation will occur in the Gorski Kotar and Velebit mountains and around Dubrovnik. The lowest rainfall is in the eastern areas of the country, which is no longer under the influence of the sea.\n\nSunshine in Croatia\n\nThe average length of sunshine in the north of Croatia is 7,8-12 hours, in the middle coast 10,7-12,3 hours and in the south 10,7-12 hours. in Split, the sun shines 2700 hours). Hvar is considered the island with the most hours of sunshine.\n\nWinds blowing on the Adriatic in Croatia\n\nIn different regions of Croatia, the weather is affected by winds, which often and quickly change and affect the lives of local people and visitors. Their occurrence is indicated by the official weather forecast in Croatia. These are phenomena occurring under certain atmospheric conditions.\n\nBóra (Bura)\n\nIt is a dry, cold wind created by moving the cold front from the interior. It is a local phenomenon, accompanied by increased pressure. The weather change can thus be predicted quite easily. The wind direction is mostly northeast. This cold air from the inland usually encounters the ridges of the coastal mountains of the Dinar system. There are two effects. On the one hand, the air is forced to rise to higher heights to overcome the mountains and then falls to the coast, where it partially warms up. This increases the expandability of the air mass as well as its speed. It reaches its highest speed on the coast. Eventually, the accumulated cold air makes use of the possibility of flowing through natural passages in the rock mass. It achieves high speeds in these places. The bora is most pronounced in the Velebit Canal, under the Biokovo Massif, in the Gulf of Trieste, the Bay of Brulja (Makarska), the Bay of Zuljana (Peljesac) and others, where it can reach up to 9 Bft. The effect of the boron is weaker in central and southern Dalmatia and in the western part of Istria (7-8 Bft). Bura often reaches hurricane strength. There are no big waves in island areas because the wind cannot fully develop. In the open sea, however, waves can be up to 3.5 m. A strange and dangerous phenomenon is the so-called sea smoke - a foam that breaks at the peaks of the waves and creates a water mist in the air, reducing visibility and making breathing difficult. The next process over the sea (sometimes a few kilometers) begins to weaken the boron. The main danger of the boron is its unpredictability. The wind of Bora is not only specific on the Adriatic. It can occur wherever the advancing air mass is forced to overcome a more coherent mountain mass and may not even occur at the coast.\n\nOn the northern Adriatic, you can encounter another variant of this wind, the so-called \"black bora\". Black because it is a flow of warmer, humid air from the continent to the sea, accompanied by dense clouds and often rainfall. It is mostly an accompanying phenomenon of the jugo (sirocco) wind.\n\nAccording to local people, the bura is born in Senj, gets married in Rijeka and dies in Trieste.\n\nJugo (Sirocco)\n\nThis meteorological phenomenon is well predictable. Weather in Croatia affected by this phenomenon can be well predicted. Humidity increases and temperature rises. In the south there are typical clouds accompanying the arrival of the warm front. The wind is warm and humid, blowing mostly from the southeast. This warm front is formed above the Sahara, and the air mass often brings with it the fine Sahara sand. Jugo is a wind of long-term character. In summer it is usually about 2-3 days, in winter it lasts up to three weeks. Above the sea, water spray is created, which the wind carries to the mainland. The air contains a lot of iodine, ozone and other elements beneficial to our health.\n\nDuring the first days it gets more intense and often accompanied by thunderstorms and may change direction. As it moves through the Adriatic from south to north without any obstacles, it intensively affects the water surface and generates relatively high waves. In the northern Adriatic, they can reach 4 m. Sometimes there is a significant increase in the level of coastal flooding.\n\nMistarál (Bríza)\n\nThis is a nice, refreshing wind, indicating good weather on the Croatian coast. It arises from the exchange of warm air above land and cooler above sea level. Warm air rises above the land, shifts over the sea, and instead of it flows cooler air from the sea (daytime). In the evening (approx. When the land-sea temperatures are equalized) the wind stops. It blows from the northwest, from spring to autumn at usually the same time of day. At night, when warmer air is above sea level (accumulated heat), the process is reversed. For sailors it is a friendly wind that can be used well. The absence of a champion predicts changes in weather on the Adriatic.\n\nNevera\n\nThe specific meteorological phenomenon affects the weather mainly in the northern Adriatic. It is created by rising hot and humid air, to which a colder air layer moves in strong gusts. Storm clouds form in higher layers. This phenomenon is usually accompanied by strong thunderstorms. A gradual fall in pressure and a sudden rise in pressure is a well-tracked harbinger. Thunderstorms last about 1-2 hours. This phenomenon can be repeated several times a day.\n\nGarbin (Lebič, Lebičada, Libeccio)\n\nThis is a short-term meteorological phenomenon accompanied by a rapid pressure drop. The wind with the weather changes comes in a few minutes. This air mass usually flows from the northwest, or west. If on its way \"encounters\" another pressure front (eg most often Jugo) often occurs tornado - ie air effect with a typical rotational flow. Funnel, which is helically directed upwards, at the same time sucking everything it can lift from the ground: water, trees, ... Its formation begins with the creation of a visible funnel at a height of several hundred meters. It gradually stretches downwards. When the opposite funnel with sucked water begins to form on the sea surface. It also gradually stretches until the two are joined. Usually he ends his life above the sea, but he can show his strength over the land.\n\nLevanter (Levanat)\n\nWind blowing from the west. It takes most 1-2 days.\n\nTramontana\n\nA wind similar to bora. It is a cold, north or northeast wind. It occurs when there is low air pressure over the Adriatic and high in the western Mediterranean or the Alps. This meteorological phenomenon affects the weather in the southern part of Croatia."
