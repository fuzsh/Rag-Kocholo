        "text": "The tables below give yearly averages for rainfall plus snowfall at major cities throughout Europe. Each place has a total for how many days of wet weather it usually gets a year and for the normal amount of precipitation.\n\nThe cities range from Amsterdam to Zurich and from Reykjavík to İstanbul. They are listed alphabetically and you can jump ahead to the section for Amsterdam to Kiev, Leeds to Pristina and Reykjavík to Zurich.\n\nIncluded in this list are Europe's national capitals plus cities with a metropolitan population of over one million people.\n\nThe calculation of days only includes the days when precipitation amounted to at least one millimetre (0.04 inches). The annual amount of precipitation is an average of historical weather data collected over a long period, in most cases 30 years."
