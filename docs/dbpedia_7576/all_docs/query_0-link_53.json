        "text": "edit\n\nGetting There\n\nBy Plane\n\nInternational:\n\nZagreb International Airport (ZAG), also known as \"Pleso\", is located 14 kilometres south of the city. Croatia Airlines, the national airline, is based there and has destinations to many major cities in Europe, including Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Bol, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dubrovnik, Frankfurt, London, Munich, Paris, Podgorica, Pristina, Pula, Rome, Sarajevo, Skopje, Split, Vienna, Zadar and Zürich. Some of the low-cost airlines flying to Zagreb include Germanwings, Ryanair and Wizz Air. LOT flies from Warsaw.\n\nDomestic:\n\nZagreb is linked to the coastal cities of Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka, Zadar and Pula by the national carrier Croatia Airlines.\n\nBy Train\n\nTrains are not the best way to travel to/from Zagreb except some usefull international links like the ones to Belgrade and Ljubljana and there are also direct trains to/from Budapest, Vienna and Munich.\n\nBy Car\n\nMajor highways connect Zagreb to the main cities in Croatia, including Split, Dubrovnik and Rijeka, as well as to places outside the country, with direct links to Hungary and Serbia. During the 21st century, there has been a major upgrade with new highways and missing links all added to the road transport system.\n\nZagreb is on the European route E65 from Sweden through Szczecin, Prague, Bratislava to Dubrovnik, Skopje and Chania in Greece.\n\nBy Bus\n\nThere are dozens of Croatian destinations served from Zagreb, including Split, Dubrovnik, Sibenik, Plitvice Lakes National Park, Rijeka, the Istrian cities and towns, Zadar and east towards Osijek. Also, international destinations are abundant including Belgrade, Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Mostar, Ljubljana, Vienna and Budapest.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nBy Public Transport\n\nZET provides public transport in Zagreb. It has trams, all inner-city bus lines, and most of the suburban lines.\n\nThe tram network operates 24 hours a day - from 4:00am to 12:00am there are 15 \"day-time lines\" (tram lines 1-9, 11-15 and 17), and from 12:00am to 4:00am there are 4 \"night\" lines (tram lines 31-34) which cover most of the day-time lines on a reduced (around 30-40 minute) frequency. Occasionally, buses replace trams on night lines. Tram line 3 does not operate Saturdays, Sundays and on public holidays. There are maps of the tram lines on almost every stop, so if you know the nearest stop to your destination you can simply figure out the shortest trip while you're at the stop.\n\nAs for the buses, there are 113 day-time and 4 night lines. ZET buses cover the area outside the city center, as well as some neighboring towns that administratively belong to Zagreb county. The buses use the same ticketing system as the trams.\n\nA historic funicular railway (uspinjača in Croatian), one of the steepest and shortest in the world, operates between the lower and upper towns with a travel time of just one minute. Monthly, daily as well as single tram/bus ticket can be used, otherwise there is a 4 kn ticket for a ride. The funicular operates every 10 minutes, for a fee of 20 kn (in addition to regular tickets for everyone on board) an immediate start can be purchased.\n\nMost of Zagreb can easialy be navigated on foot. The New Town is just north of the train station and further beyond is the Old Town area, about 10-15 minutes from the train station. The bus station is about 15-20 minutes walk from the train station or you can catch a tram.\n\nBy Bike\n\nSince 01-Jun-2013 there are automated public bicycle rental stations in Zagreb. It started with a three-month pilot period during which approx. 50 bikes were available at 6 stations in the city centre: at the main train station; in front of the Technical Museum at Savska Street; at the intersection of Petrinjska and Amruševa; at the intersection of Gundulićeva and Varšavska; in front of the National University Library; at Šubićeva Street at the green market on Kvaternik Square. The pilot was successful, three more stations have already been added, one of them in Novi Zagreb next to the Avenue Centar Mall at the tram/bus stop museum of contemparary art (muzej suvremene umjetnosti).\n\nedit\n\nEat\n\nThere are many take out, pizza-cut, sandwich bars and fast foods around the city. Most are located in the city center (main square - Ban Jelačić and surrounding blocks). There are also food chains such as the \"McDonald's\", \"Daily Fresh\", \"Mlinar\", \"Pan Pek\", and the preferred \"Dubravica\". Sandwich prices around the city varies from 10 to 20 kuna.

There are three providers, T-Mobile (also operates the Bonbon prepaid brand), Vip (also operates the Tomato prepaid brand) and Tele2. Over 98% of the country's area is covered. If you have an unlocked phone, you can buy a prepaid SIM card for 20 kn.

GSM phones bundled with T-Mobile or Vip prepaid SIM cards can be found in post offices, grocery stores and kiosks at varying prices.\n\nAn alternative to using a mobile phone is Calling Cards which can be found in postal offices and kiosks, there are two providers, Dencall and Hitme. You can buy cards from 25 kn.\n\nPost\n\nHrvatska Posta is the national postal service of Croatia and has pretty fast and reliable service throughout the country and internationally. It takes several days by airmail to other countries in Europe, but over a week to the US for example. They have a direct link to the pricelist, where you can see the prices of sending postcards, letters and parcels both domestically as well as to other countries. Post boxes are yellow in Croatia and the times of collections are indicated on the box. The opening times of post offices vary, but mostly they are open from 8:00am to 7:00pm Monday to Friday and until 2:00pm on Saturdays, though some might keep shorter or even a longer hours, just ask around. You can buy stamps here, or at newsstands. Prices start at around 10Kn for sending a letter or postcard to neighbouring countries, a few more further away. If you want to send packages internationally, it might be better to check companies like FedEx, TNT, DHL or UPS. They are reliable, fast and usually not much more expensive than Croatia's postal service."
