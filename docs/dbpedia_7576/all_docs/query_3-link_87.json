        "text": "\"Heat islands\" occur when cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. The heat island effect increases energy costs (e.g., for air conditioning), air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality. Extreme heat events often affect certain populations first, with factors like age, race, income, and location playing a role in who is most at risk from extreme heat. By adding natural surfaces like vegetation back into communities, green infrastructure can mitigate the heat island effect and provide cooling. Visit EPA's Heat Islands and Equity webpage to learn more about historic inequities.\n\nAlong with rising temperatures, climate change is expected to lead to more frequent, more intense, and longer heat waves during summer months. As heat waves and rising temperatures occur, green infrastructure can be a crucial tool for communities to improve health, safety, and comfort.\n\nExplore the sections below to learn how green infrastructure can provide cooling benefits and mitigate the effects of heat islands.\n\nOn this page:\n\nUsing Green Infrastructure to Reduce Heat Islands\n\nResources\n\nUsing Green Infrastructure to Reduce Heat Islands\n\nTrees, green roofs, and vegetation can help reduce heat island effects by shading building surfaces, deflecting radiation from the sun, and releasing moisture into the atmosphere. Visit EPA's Using Trees and Vegetation to Reduce Heat Islands webpage to learn more.\n\nImprove Vegetation Cover\n\nPlanting trees and other vegetation leads to a cooling effect. Space in areas might be limited, but communities can integrate small green infrastructure into grassy or barren areas, vacant lots, and street rights-of-way.\n\nCommunities can make traditional water quality practices serve double duty by adding trees in or around roadside planters and other green infiltration-based practices to boost roadside cooling and shading. Examples include native, drought-tolerant shade trees and smaller plants such as shrubs, grasses, and groundcover. However, trees should be added in coordination with the green infrastructure designer or with the overall design of the approach in mind. If not integrated into the approach properly, tree roots can impair the approach's structure or functionality.\n\nBuild Green Roofs\n\nGreen roofs are an effective heat island reduction strategy, providing both direct and ambient cooling effects. They also improve air quality by lowering temperatures, absorbing pollutants, and preventing additional air pollution (pdf). Many communities offer tax credits for installing green roofs. Communities can check their local government's website for opportunities. Examples of current programs include the RiverSmart Rooftops Green Roof Rebate Program by the District of Columbia and the Green Roof Tax Credit Program by the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nPrioritize Green Infrastructure in Regular Upgrades\n\nBuilding green infrastructure improvements into regular street upgrades and capital improvement projects can help ensure continued investment in heat-reducing practices throughout your community. See five strategies that can be used to reduce heat islands within ongoing and planned updates, and explore EPA's Community Actions Database for implementation examples. Communities should also consider local heat equity concerns, as New York City, New York; Richmond, Virginia; and Tucson, Arizona have done.\n\nResources\n\nGuides and Fact Sheets:\n\nEPA Green Infrastructure in Parks: A Guide to Collaboration, Funding, and Community Engagement (pdf) — A guide for encouraging partnerships between park agencies and stormwater agencies to promote using green infrastructure on park lands.\n\nEPA Region 5 Resource: Stormwater Trees — A how-to technical memorandum for improving success of urban tree programs.\n\nEPA Heat Island Program — Clearinghouse for resources, tools, and educational materials on heat island effects.\n\nReports and Studies:\n\nReducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies, Chapter Three: Green Roofs — This EPA publication describes the causes and impacts of summertime urban heat islands and promotes strategies for lowering temperatures in U.S. communities.\n\nThe Value of Green Infrastructure for Urban Climate Adaptation (pdf) — This Center for Clean Air Policy report evaluates the performance and benefits of a variety of green infrastructure strategies that assist with community climate resiliency, including ecoroofs, green alleys and streets, and urban forestry.\n\nTools:"
