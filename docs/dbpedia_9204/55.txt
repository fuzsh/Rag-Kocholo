The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia existed from 1939 – 1945. It was an ethnic Czech protectorate of Nazi Germany after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. When Germany surrendered to the Allies in 1945, the existence of this state came to an end.

During the period from 1939 – 1945 when Bohemia and Moravia was a German protectorate, more than 100 stamps were issued, however after May 1945 regular issues of Czechoslovakian stamps were resumed.
