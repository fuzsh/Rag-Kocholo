The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia is an autonomous region of the Greater Germanic Reich in Central Europe. It borders Germany to the north, west, and south; and the Slovak Republic to the east. It is led by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, a German government official. By 1962, the Protectorate is highly Germanized, to the point where Czech has become a minority language in the country.

Böhmen-Mähren, as it is known now, used to exist at game start, but now only exists during the German Civil War and, in some capacity, during the SS Civil War, having been incorporated into the proper territories of the Greater German Reich.
