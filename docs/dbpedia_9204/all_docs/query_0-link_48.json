        "text": "From 1939 to 1945 Bohemia (without the Sudetenland), together with Moravia, formed the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe Jewish population of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (92,199 Jews in 1939) was virtually annihilated, with over 78,000 murdered.\n\nOf the vast majority of Czech Jews that were imprisoned in Theresienstadt ghetto, 80% of those were deported to the concentration camps and extermination camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, Treblinka and Sobibor. Other Czech Jews were sent directly to death camps.\n\nThe capital city of Bohemia was Prague, where 92,000 Jews lived at the outbreak of the War, making up almost 20 per cent of the city's population. Prague was one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe. At least two-thirds of the Jewish population in Prague perished in the Holocaust."
