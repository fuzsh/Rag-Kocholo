The note had a face value of 100 Czechoslovak koruna and was issued in 1940.\n\nThe front of the banknote featured a portrait of the Czech writer and historian František Palacký, while the back of the note featured an image of the Cathedral of St. Vitus in Prague. The banknote also featured various security features to prevent counterfeiting, including a watermark and a security thread.\n\nBohemia and Moravia were occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany in March 1939, following the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established as a German puppet state, with the German government controlling all aspects of the economy, including the issuance of banknotes.\n\nAfter World War II, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was dissolved and the Czechoslovak government resumed control of the country. The 100 Kronen banknote from the Protectorate era is now considered a historical artifact and is sought after by collectors of banknotes and other historical items."
