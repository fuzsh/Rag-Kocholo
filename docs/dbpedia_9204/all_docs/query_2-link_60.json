V podstatě tak platila stávající právní úprava z předchozího období. Chudinská péče však nebyla stejná pro všechny obyvatele Protektorátu, nýbrž lišila se podle toho, jakou státní příslušnost měla osoba nárokující si chudinskou péči. Stejný nebyl tedy ani nositel chudinské péče. Po roce 1939 byly také zavedeny přímé a nepřímé nástroje podpory nemajetných osob, tedy především sociální příspěvky rodinám s velkým počtem dětí. Zároveň byly v tomto období nalezeny další prostředky, které naplňovaly chudinský fond obce. Na závěr je nutné se zmínit také o stále se zostřující represi proti osobám vyloučeným z národního společenství, tedy především proti tulákům, žebrákům, osobám práce se štítícím či Romům.\n\nDuring the existence of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia no dramatic changes were made in the field of care of the poor. After 1939 both direct and indirect tools of support for poor people were introduced, such as social benefits for families with many children. Additional sources were also found to fill the poverty relief funds of communities. The present study gives basic information about the changes taking place in the legal regulation of the care of the poor during the Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia. Thus, it may give fresh stimulus to the interest in this particular area and provide a new view of the Protectorate's social policy without being tainted with any ideology, as it was the case of studies published prior to 1989. It is also desirable to do archival research in this particular area to show the practical effect of the legislative measures related to social care.\"\n\nThe chapter focuses on the formation of a vital link between the social security system in former Czechoslovakia and that in the Reich under conditions of unequal power in the occupied territory of Bohemia and Moravia, and the... more\n\nThe chapter focuses on the formation of a vital link between the social security system in former Czechoslovakia and that in the Reich under conditions of unequal power in the occupied territory of Bohemia and Moravia, and the implementation of the Reich system in the annexed Sudetenland.\n\nSystem of forced and directed labour was characteristic for protectorate labour law.

In order for this system to work effectively, it was necessary to create some required effective managing and controlling mechanisms. Of major importance was a newly created system of employment offices and their subsidiaries which was directed by the Ministry of Social and Health Administration, later by the Ministry of Economy and Labour. Employment offices constituted one of the most important and key instruments in the process of performing directed and forced labour. During World War II, their tasks and authority gradually grew and at the end of the war they applied basically to all areas related to work performance. Although the employment offices belonged to the so-called autonomous (Czech) administration, their leading positions were taken by German officers which had a considerable influence on their actual activity. The Ministry of Social and Health Administration (later Ministry of Economy and Labour) represented an institution where legal regulations for the labour law area were made. Since 1942, mostly German officers were in charge of this area amongst whom can be named primarily Dr. Walter Bertsch and Dr. Wilhelm Dennler. German office workers transferred here from the Office of Reich Protector, thus they directly contributed to creating drafts of legislation.\n\nThe Relationship of Czech State to the Empire in the Middle Ages and its Use and Abuse in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia The relationship of Czech state and the medieval German Empire is the core of the dispute between the... more\n\nThe Relationship of Czech State to the Empire in the Middle Ages and its Use and Abuse in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\n\nThe relationship of Czech state and the medieval German Empire is the core of the dispute between the Czech and German general and legal historians at least the last 150 years. Czech and German nationalist historiography used to interpret this relationship mainly in the second half of the 19th and in the first half of the 20 century quite different as it was at the moment suit the national ideas of the nation. Either it was considered that the Czech state was fully dependent component of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it was not at all. After March 1939 when there was a military occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Nazi leaders and Czech collaborators tried to convince Czech as well as world public community that the constitutional relationship of the Czech state and the Empire after 15 March 1939 is nothing new and that it only continues the thousand-year old tradition that links the two state units. This paper points out the way how the historical subject of the proportion of Bohemia and Empire has been used and misused in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939 -1945).\n\n\"Vztah českého státu a středověké německé Říše je jádrem sporu mezi českými a německými obecnými i právními historiky přinejmenším posledních 150 let. Nacionalistické české i německé dějepisectví si tento vzájemný vztah interpretovalo především v druhé polovině 19. a v první polovině 20. století zcela odlišně tak, jak se to v dané chvíli vyhovovalo státoprávním představám daného národa. Buď byl zastáván názor, že české země byly na Svaté říši římské závislé a tvořily její součást, nebo že tomu tak nebylo. Když došlo v březnu 1939 k vojenskému obsazení Čech a Moravy a ke zřízení Protektorátu Čechy a Morava, snažili se nacističtí představitelé a čeští kolaboranti přesvědčit českou i světovou veřejnost o tom, že státoprávní vztah českých zemí a Říše po 15. březnu 1939 není nic nového, a že se pouze navazuje na staré tisícileté tradice spojení obou těchto státních celků. Tento příspěvek tak poukazuje na to, jakým způsobem byla využita a zneužita historická látka vzájemného poměru Čech a Říše v období Protektorátu Čechy a Morava (1939 – 1945).\n\n\"Criminal Law in the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia This article deals with the material criminal law in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

In the branch of the criminal law during the period of the Nazi-Occupation, the most changes (compared to other branches of law during this period) were implemented. The criminal law valid on the area of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was considerably complicated and unclear. There were some reasons for it. One of them was the fact, that the rules of the criminal law were not codified in any single legal enactment. The second reason was the exist-ence of two legal orders, which were valid simultaneously in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the substitution of the territoriality principle by the personality principle. Over the years, the use of the taken over Czechoslovakian rules of criminal law had been increasingly reduced for the benefit of the German criminal law and of the hearing of torts and delicts before the German courts in the Protectorate.\"\n\nThe Prague Gestapo station was officially established by order of Reich Leader of the SS and commander of the security police Heinrich Himmler, dating from 5 May 1939, and several months later it was elevated to controlling office.

It actu- ally began its activities on 2 June 1939, immediately after the activities of the Prague security police operations department were terminated a day earlier. Just like any other Gestapo station, the Prague station was also structured according to the model of the Main Office of the Secret State Police (Geheimes Staatspo- lizeiamt, so-called Gestapo), subsequently according to the Reich Main Security Office (Reichsicherheitshauptamt, RSHA). There were three very different or- ganisational structures of the economic and personnel departments over the six years of existence of the Prague Gestapo, of which one was only existed very briefly. Only one department administering this paperwork initially existed and then separate departments for administration and personnel matters were estab- lished in the second half of the war. There was also a “confiscation” department from 1941 to 1943. Although these departments were not parts of the Prague sta- tion with executive authority, their officials and employees were involved in mas- sive theft from both the Jewish and non-Jewish populations of the protectorate. Some were subsequently deployed on the Eastern Front, where they were in- volved in the Nazi extermination policy.\n\nThe publication is focused around the analysis of social protection within the territory of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia during the National Socialist rule.

The collection, therefore, strives to overcome the limits of current historical research. Instead of the present emphasis on \"social demagogy\" when conceptualizing a social policy whose goal was to maximize the exploitation of the Protectorate´s human resources to the advantage of Germany´s military objectives, the collection´s concept confronts this one-sided (but not incorrect) perspective, which demonstrates the long-term continuities of wartime social policy with the previous era (before the year 1938) and the subsequent period of people´s democracy after the year 1945. The studies within the collection represent an empirical approach towards gleaning factual data on the individual social policies (insurance, housing policy, labour regulation, etc.).\n\nThe full text is now available here:\n\nhttp://www.ucl.cas.cz/edicee/dejiny/39-v-obecnem-zajmu-cenzura-a-socialni-regulace-literatury-v-moderni-ceske-kulture-1749-2014\n\n→ https://www.facebook.com/VObecnemZajmu - - - - -\n\nIn the 2015 \"book of the year\" - survey of the Czech daily Lidové noviny, our book was awarded the 3rd place, just behind the Czech translations of Second-hand Time by nobel prize winner Svetlana Alexievich and Michel Houellebecq's Submission. - - - - -\n\nThis book describes, analyses and interprets the role played by censorship and by other institutional and structural mechanisms that have participated in the social regulation of literary communication within the cultural sphere of the historical Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia), which loosely coincide with the borders of the modern Czech Republic. The exposition on the period up to 1918 examines the organization of the supervising censorship bodies in the Habsburg Empire, which included the Czech lands, particularly the activities of the Viennese authorities relating to literary communication within the Czech lands in Czech, German and other languages. Apart from some individual comparative references, however, this book does not focus on conditions in Slovakia, even though it joined the Czech lands to form a single unitary and then federative state in 1918−1939 and 1945−1992, for ever since the time of the Habsburg Empire, Slovakia as a part of Hungary has had its own specific printing rights traditions. Even in the 20th century, however, as part of a common state, in spite of its linguistic, cultural and political similarities it formed its own administrative and cultural unit to such an extent that no exposition of the social regulation of literature and the press in the Czech lands can be superimposed on the Slovak situation in that period. This book provides the reader with a comprehensive view of the changing faces of censorship and of the regulation of literature as well as the press (with some exceptions, performing arts genres are outside of its purview). The historical period under review is defined on the one end by the beginning of the Enlightenment, during which the focus of institutionalized censorship shifted from the church to the state, and on the other end by the most recent turn of the century, which saw changes in media usage as the internet grew in importance. The internal chronological milestones, dividing the book’s exposition into eight sections (1749−1810, 1810−1848, 1848−1863, 1863−1918, 1918−1938, 1938−1949, 1949−1989 and 1989−2014), reflect important changes in censorship practice.\n\n[… continue reading in the attached PDF]\n\nDějiny české literatury již od 18. století provázejí stížnosti literátů na to, jak je jejich tvorba omezová na cenzurou.

The contributors to this volume analyze the evolving anti-Jewish policies in the annexed territories and their impact on the Jewish population, as well as the attitudes and actions of non-Jews, Germans, and indigenous populations. They demonstrate that diverse anti-Jewish policies developed in the different territories, which in turn affected practices in other regions and even influenced Berlin’s decisions. Having these systematic studies together in one volume enables a comparison - based on the most recent research - between anti-Jewish policies in the areas annexed by the Nazi state. The results of this prizewinning book call into question the common assumption that one central plan for persecution extended across Nazi-occupied Europe, shifting the focus onto differing regional German initiatives and illuminating the cooperation of indigenous institutions.\n\nSybil Halpern Milton Memorial Book Prize of the German Studies Association 2017 for the best book in Holocaust Studies in 2015-2016; Yad Vashem International Book Prize in Holocaust research 2017 for the best book in 2015-2016, Finalist;... more\n\nSybil Halpern Milton Memorial Book Prize of the German Studies Association 2017 for the best book in Holocaust Studies in 2015-2016; Yad Vashem International Book Prize in Holocaust research 2017 for the best book in 2015-2016, Finalist; Prize for one of the most outstanding German studies in humanities and social sciences in 2017 by the Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels, the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung, the VG WORT and the German Foreign Office.\n\nAnti-Jewish Persecution in the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia. Local Initiatives, Central Decisions, Jewish Responses 1938-1945\n\nThis book in German (soon to be published in English and Czech) is the first authoritative account on the persecution of the Jews in the Czech part of former Czechoslovakia after the 2005 book by Lidia Rothkirchen. Yet, my book analyses for the first time systematically the mutual dynamic between German and Czech, national, regional and local perpetrator policies, demonstrating Czech radicalizing initiatives and thus ending the legend of sole German anti-Jewish policies and pointing to the importance of local and regional factors and institutions. The book is also able to show how these diverse policies impacted the Jewish communities and people, based on a broad range of new sources that include the entire set of weekly reports of the Prague Jewish community to Eichmann from July 1939- Summer 1942 plus video testimonies from the USC Shoah Foundation. These sources led to the discovery of many new facts, for example about an early wave of gettoization in dozens of Czech towns starting in spring of 1940 that mirrors the development in Poland long before the creation of the Terezin ghetto, but also about the creation of Jews houses in Prague, and the forgotten origin of the yellow star measure in Prague in 1941 etc. Always comparing the Protectorate development with policies in Vienna, Germany and Poland, the book speaks to the overlooked importance of the Protectorate for the understanding of the development of the Holocaust in Europe. One more important element of this new account are several subchapters exploring a wide range of active individual Jewish resistance acts that change our perspective of how Jews and Jewish communities responded to the persecution.\n\nÜber die zentrale Rolle des Protektorats Böhmen und Mähren bei der Radikalisierung der Judenverfolgung in Europa.\n\nVon den über 118.000 im März 1939 in Böhmen und Mähren lebenden Juden konnten bis Oktober 1941 nur etwa 25.000 flüchten. Seit der Errichtung des Protektorats radikalisierten tschechische und deutsche Behörden die antijüdische Politik. Sie beraubten die Juden ihres Eigentums, ghettoisierten sie, zogen sie zur Zwangsarbeit heran und deportierten sie schließlich nach Theresienstadt, bevor viele von dort in die Vernichtungslager verschleppt wurden. Rund 80.000 tschechische Juden fielen dem Holocaust zum Opfer.\n\nDie richtungsweisende Studie zeigt, dass die Politik nicht allein von Berlin aus gesteuert, sondern oft von der tschechischen Regierung oder lokalen Behörden vorangetrieben wurde. Prager Initiativen beförderten, wie in der Frage der Kennzeichnung der Juden 1941, sogar zentrale Entscheidungen im Deutschen Reich oder anderen besetzten Gebieten. Das Protektorat nimmt damit eine bisher verkannte wichtige Zwischenstellung in der Radikalisierung der antijüdischen Politik ein.\n\nAnhand der bislang unbekannten Wochenberichte der Jüdischen Gemeinde Prag an Adolf Eichmann kann der Autor die Auswirkungen auf das Leben der jüdischen Bevölkerung erstmals detailliert analysieren.\n\nThe article focuses on the role of Czech experts in the regulation of labour distribution and the implementation of preventive and diagnostic healthcare during the Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia.

The technocratic ambitions of Czech experts are examined in tandem with the Protectorate organisations involved in regulating the labour market and recruiting workers for the German arms industry. The starting point of the study is Vladimír Sach’s novel Frantík, kladivo a spol. (Frantík, the Hammer and Co.), published in 1943, which reflects the technocratic ideals of the time and the author’s rationalisation of collaborative activism while expressing admiration towards the Nazi’s sophisticated distribution of labour. The following parts explore the institutional context, namely the Institute of Human Labour, and the involvement of experts in the official structures of the Protectorate and the rationalisation of everyday life in terms of employment policy and public health. The author draws on “rationally justified activism,” which kept the professional line of reasoning intact, allowing experts to define what was good and efficient for the Czech nation. Scientific rationality and political impartiality allowed Czech experts to significantly contribute to the social stabilisation of Bohemia and Moravia, which tended to the needs of keeping the social security systems and state administration going in the (Czech) national interest after the Munich Agreement of September 1938 and during the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe knowledge of issues pertaining to the so-called Nazi ‘euthanasia’ and its implementation in the Reich District of Sudetenland and in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia is still regrettably incomplete.

For example, we still know the fate of only a handful of its victims.\n\nFor the past several years, the Memorial Site Hartheim Castle (Austria), Foundation for the Memorials of Saxony (Germany), and the Institute of Contemporary History of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic together with the Terezín Memorial – Museum of Ghetto (Czech Republic) have been collaborating in a joint effort to fill these gaps and complete our knowledge of the ‘euthanasia’ programme.\n\nThe most recent results of this collaboration are now presented\n\nto the public in a touring exhibition, which will be shown in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Austria. The Exhibition focuses both on the administrative preparations and the particulars of the execution of the Nazi ‘euthanasia’ programme in the Reich District of Sudetenland\n\nand in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe Exhibition was made possible thanks to the generous support of the European Union, the National Fund of the Republic of Austria, Federal Republic of Germany, Free State of Saxony, and the Czech Republic.\n\nPři zpracování problematiky nacistické „eutanázie“ v tzv. říšské župě Sudety a protektorátu Čechy a Morava stále chybí celá řada poznatků.

In the first part of the article, the author deals with the ideological concept of labour, that means the attitude of the national socialists towards labour and its function in the national society. Further, the situation during the period of the so called Second Republic (October 1938 – March 1939) is described. In that period, we can find certain Nazism tendencies in the labour law.\n\nGradually, the inhabitants of the Protectorate were forced to accomplish community service. Also the compulsory labour service was implemented. The newly constituted employment offices played an important role in this process, because they were the main offices for controlling the labour forces. The last years of the Protectorate period were connected with the so called forced labour – thousands of Czech workers were sent to work in Germany.\n\n\"\n\nMonografie podává v jedenácti kapitolách podrobný přehled o právní regulaci práce a jevů spojených s prací v období Protektorátu Čechy a Morava (1939–1945).

Pro pochopení sledovaného účelu vydávání některých pracovněprávních norem a vůbec pojetí pracovněprávních institutů dle nacistických představ je v úvodních pasážích věnována pozornost ideologickému pojetí práce a vybraným kategoriím pracovního práva. Monografie podává také stručný nástin říšského pracovního práva, které bylo vzorem pro právo protektorátní. Z hlediska sledovaného tématu je stěžejní část věnovaná omezení autonomie vůle zaměstnance a zaměstnavatele v pracovněprávních vztazích, jakož i vytvoření a fungování systému řízené a nucené práce. V prvním případě se jedná především o zásahy do mzdové politiky či zákaz hromadného propouštění, ve druhém pak o zavedení pracovní povinnosti, přikazování pracovních sil k výkonu práce, včleňování do práce a konečně nucené nasazení českých pracovních sil na území Říše. Monografie rovněž analyzuje činnost úřadů, které měly co do činění se správou práce, ať už souvisely s vytvářením pracovněprávních norem (Ministerstvo hospodářství a práce), s jejich aplikací (úřady práce), či dozorem nad jejich dodržováním (živnostenská inspekce). Monografie je koncipována tak, aby přehledně podala dané téma na základě dostupných archiválií, edicí archivních materiálů, publikovaných pramenů práva, odborné dobové i současné sekundární literatury, memoárů či dobového tisku. Z velké části přináší zcela nové a dosud nepublikované poznatky, které byly získány zejména na základě rozsáhlého studia archivního materiálu.\n\nLabor and its Legal Regulation in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939–1945)\n\nFrom the days when the state has begun to authoritatively interfere in labor relations between employees and employers, the nature of these relationships begun to change, alongside with the increasing government regulation, which has been initially considered as purely private. Gradually, labor law got right on the border between the private and the public law. In totalitarian regimes, the government has always vehemently sought to suppress the private element of labor law in favor of state regulation. The period of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939 – 1945) has not been an exception. Thus, the labor law represented a branch of the private law that underwent most changes during the Nazi occupation of the Czech territory.\n\nThe establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia had represented a turning point in the Czechoslovakiasànd especially its inhabitants fate, whose national identity elements were in danger.

The birth of a pro-German government in Slovakia and the uncertain idea of an independent state had a negative effect of this event. Regarding this, the Czechs had fought hardly for keeping their national integrity and democratic political principles, as the foundation of their state emerged only two decades before these events. On one side, this article aims to offer a perspective of the Czech resistance in the context of this unforgiveable destiny, on the most notable actions taken against the regime and the way this fight was carried. On the other hand, another target it is represented by the next question: did this regime had its unicity in contrast with the other occupied countries?\n\nOne of the main tasks of the Nazis (in the field of law) was to institute a unified law both in the whole territory of the Third Reich and in the occupied territories.

In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia it was not otherwise. In comparison with other historical periods, this period of the Protectorate did not last long, but during the 6 years of its existence both, the private and the public law, were influenced by the Nazi ideology very much. That is why the intention of this contribution is to point out the basic data of the Nazi ideology and the Nazi legal theory in the field of the “private” law, to show the reader the principles of the protectorate law and the principles which would have concededly been instituted into the protectorate law, if the Nazis had not been defeated in 1945.\n\nThis study is a probe into the politics of history in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

In the autumn of 1942, the Secretary of State in the Office of the Reich Protectorate, K. H. Frank, decided on a binding change to the German way of writing the dynastic name of the Přemyslids from the hitherto traditional form of Przemysliden to the form Primisliden. He intended that the change should not only apply to the territory of the Protectorate, but that the decree should be binding for the entire territory of the Greater German Reich. In his study the author analyses how Frank’s intervention into established historical terminology came about, who initiated it and whether representatives of historical science were also involved in it, and analyses the acknowledged and hidden reasons for this remarkable decision.\n\nAccording to the German model, in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, there was enacted so-called racial legislation, which did not allow the persons to whom the racial laws applied to be engaged in certain professions.

The Decree No. 136/1942 Coll. on Legal Status of Jews in Public Issues excluded Jews from public administration jobs, education jobs, legal professions, health service and journalism. The Decree No. 260/1942 Coll. on Employing Jews derogated the protective function of labor law. As it is shown in this contribution, in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Jews were deprived of any kind of protection in labor relationships. Discrimination in labor law was however not the only example of interference with rights of the Jews living in Protectorate. As time went by, Jews were robbed of all property and soon they were deprived of the last thing they had: personal freedom and life.\n\nWorld War II, the greatest military conflict in human history, had an impact on nearly all aspects of culture, including folklore.

The best-known expression of the social mood in German-occupied Czechoslovakia was a vast collection of urban legends concerning Pérák (\"the Springer\"). Stories about this fantastic being, a mysterious man jumping from rooftops on spring-heeled boots, are present both in personal memories of wartime and later popular culture. The legend of Pérák is particularly interesting since it has emerged and spread in times of harsh censorship and has gained popularity without any help from the media, becoming an example of a traditional oral narrative existing in modern society. Like every contemporary legend, it is flexible and can play different roles depending on the circumstances. Based on the theoretical background provided by prof. Dionizjusz Czubala, the author describes the development and various aspects of this modern myth, as well as the changes it went through in post-war fiction (cartoon, comic and novel). The study of Pérák's evolution from the protagonist of urban legends to the only Czech superhero provides the opportunity to draw conclusions concerning the social purposes of rumour, anecdote and whispered propaganda."
