        "text": "When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Germany was economically and militarily weak.\n\nAs the Nazis focused on stabilising internal problems, they maintained the guise of moderation abroad.\n\nHowever, the Nazi regime still took steps to break with international order , even at this early stage.\n\nConcordat with the Vatican\n\nThe first success in Nazi diplomacy was the Concordat signed between the Vatican and Nazi Germany on 20 July 1933.\n\nThis Concordat agreed that the Nazis would not interfere in the activities of the Catholic Church. In return, the Vatican would diplomatically recognise the Nazi regime – the first state to officially do so.\n\nThe Concordat was an international success. It also helped to consolidate Nazi power internally within Germany by reducing Catholic opposition to the party.\n\nWithdrawal from the League of Nations\n\nOne of the key priorities of early Nazi foreign policy was overturning aspects of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nJust three months after signing the Concordat, Hitler made his first major break with the Treaty of Versailles by withdrawing Germany from the League of Nations on the 14 October 1933.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , and following the creation of the League of Nations , there was an international consensus that disarmament should take place.\n\nFrance, however, had refused to disarm due to fears about future wars with Germany following the devastation that they experienced in the First World War.\n\nHitler used other countries refusal to disarm as a pretext for withdrawing Germany from the League of Nations.\n\nOn 12 November 1933, Hitler held a plebiscite on his decision to withdraw Germany from the League of Nations. The results of the plebiscite seemed to show that the German public overwhelmingly voted in support of the move, although this should not be taken at face value, as there was a large amount of pressure from the Nazis to vote this way.\n\nPolish Non-Aggression Pact\n\nOn 26 January 1934, the Nazis made an unexpected diplomatic peace move by signing the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Hitler signed this pact because he wanted to ensure that Poland did not sign a military alliance with France, as Germany was not yet prepared for another war.\n\nThis pact gave Poland assurance that Germany would not invade in the immediate future and therefore gave them no reason to have a military alliance with France. This, in turn, gave Germany time to fully rearm.\n\nThe pact agreed that both countries would work together diplomatically to address any issues, and would not engage in armed conflict with each other for a minimum of ten years.\n\nThe pact caused some concern to France, who was a close ally of Poland. France was still highly suspicious of Germany following the devastation that France suffered during the First World War.\n\nThe relative caution of early Nazi foreign policy did not last very long.\n\nConscription and Rearmament 1935\n\nOn 26 February 1935, the German air force the Luftwaffe was officially established. On 16 March 1935, Hitler publically announced his plan to reintroduce conscription and increase the size of the German Army to 500,000 men.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had been banned from having an air force since 1920, and was only allowed a limited army of 100,000 men.\n\nThe announcements establishing the Luftwaffe and then increasing the size of the German Army were public declarations that Germany was breaking international law and the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nBy 1939, the German Army had approximately a million men, and the Luftwaffe had 8000 planes.\n\nAnglo-German Naval Agreement 1935\n\nJust three months later, on 18 June 1935, the Nazis agreed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with Britain. Under this agreement, Germany could expand its navy to 35% of the size of the British Navy. Britain made this agreement in order to avoid a major naval arms race against Germany.\n\nThis pact again broke the limitations on armaments set out in the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThe British signed the agreement without consulting other European nations such as France or Italy. This undermined the chances of creating of a united front against Germany’s rule breaking.\n\nThe agreement was the first sign of the British, and European, policy of appeasement against Hitler, which had the aim of avoiding war at all costs.\n\nRemilitarisation of the Rhineland 1936\n\nThe Rhineland was a strip of German territory bordering France, which had first become occupied and following the end of the First World War and the resulting Treaty of Versailles.\n\nContinuing with his policy of breaking the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler cautiously instigated the remilitarisation of the Rhineland on the 7 March 1936.\n\nThis international community did not respond. France was in a state of internal political disarray due to a change in government, and therefore they were not prepared to take military action without British support. Whilst the British protested that the action broke the terms of the Treaty, they were not willing to go to war over it. As the British politician Lord Lothian famously remarked, they saw it as ‘no more than the Germans walking into their own backyard’.\n\nWith hindsight, it is easy to see the remilitarisation of the Rhineland as the beginning of Hitler’s aggressive steps towards war. At the time, this was less clear as it seemed that all Germany was doing was reinstating the army in a part of its own country.\n\nOne of the causes of the Second World War was the Nazis’ aggressive foreign policy. The Hossbach Memorandum is often used as early evidence of this, showing Hitler’s plans for a war of expansion.\n\nThe Hossbach Memorandum was a note compiled by Colonel Count Friedrich Hossbach of a secret meeting between Hitler and his top military and political leadership on the 5 November 1937.\n\nAt the meeting, Hitler discussed his plans for foreign policy in the years ahead. Here, according to Hossbach, Hitler stated that the time for a war for Lebensraum was near.\n\nHitler declared that the primary targets for this desired ‘living space’ were Austria and Czechoslovakia. The question, Hitler stated, was not if, but when and how.\n\nHitler also identified a time frame in which the war for Lebensraum would ideally take place: 1943-45. At this stage, the Nazis believed that the German industry would be fully mobilised for war. Hitler declared that action could possibly take place before this date if other countries had internal problems that would make the war for Lebensraum easier.\n\nWhether or not the Memorandum is a genuine document has been the subject of much debate amongst historians.\n\nNowadays, the Hossbach Memorandum is generally regarded to be a genuine document and a blueprint for Hitler’s foreign policy leading into the Second World War. It is regarded as proof that Hitler had planned to go to war to achieve Lebensraum.\n\nAnschluss refers to the annexation of Austria in 1938. There was growing support in Austria for the Nazis from 1933. The country had a (non-Nazi) semi-fascist government from around this time. In 1934, the Nazis assassinated the Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in the hope of establishing a Nazi regime. The coup failed and Kurt von Schuschnigg replaced Dollfuss as chancellor. However, his ring-wing regime was one full of political factions, and its success rested on support from fascist Italy.\n\nFrom 1938, as Italy grew closer to Nazi Germany, Austria became increasingly isolated and vulnerable to German takeover. The Nazis were keen to expand their territory, and support for the Nazis and a union with Germany among the Austrian people was high.\n\nThe German Army marched into Austria on the 12 March 1938, with little to no opposition from the population or any other foreign powers.\n\nOn the 13 March 1938, Austria was incorporated into the Greater German Reich. The result of a retrospective plebiscite held by the Nazis indicated that 99% of Austrian nationals supported the move. Despite this, as with previous plebiscites, those who voted were subject to a large amount of pressure from the Nazis to vote this way. As such, the result should be treated with caution.\n\nHitler’s next target was Poland. Following the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Poland was already partially surrounded by German controlled territories by 1939. As such, it was in a geographically weak situation.\n\nIn response to Hitler’s annexation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, the British pledged military support to Poland in the case of an attack from Nazi Germany. The French supported this agreement. This became known as the Polish Guarantee. Hitler responded by renouncing the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.\n\nOn the 23 August 1939, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact (also known as the Nazi-Soviet Pact) between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was announced. The two countries, which were ideological enemies, agreed to peace between each other for ten years. The pact also secretly divided up Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nPoland was surrounded. Germany could now attack without worrying about a war with the Soviet Union. Hitler thought it was unlikely that Britain and France would respond militarily to an invasion of Poland, but even if they did respond Hitler’s pact with the Soviet Union would allow the German Army to retaliate.\n\nOn the 1 September 1939, Germany attacked Poland. Britain and France issued an ultimatum to Germany: to either withdraw troops from Poland or face a declaration of war from Britain and France.\n\nThe policy of appeasement that the British and French had been following for since the start of the Nazis aggressive foreign policy was over. Britain especially had began preparing for war following the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939.\n\nOn 3 September 1939, having received no reply and unwilling to accept further German expansion, Britain and France declared war on Germany.\n\nThe Second World War had begun."
