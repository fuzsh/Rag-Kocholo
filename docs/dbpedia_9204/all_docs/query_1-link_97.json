        "text": "On Friday, the Prague City Hall will fly the Romani flag to mark the International Romani Holocaust Memorial Day. The date is linked to the tragic night of August 2-3, 1944, when the \"Gypsy Family Camp\" at Auschwitz-Birkenau was destroyed and thousands of people died in gas chambers. A new exhibition in Hodonín near Kunštát will remember the Romani victims of WWII, focusing on survivors' stories with photos and audio recordings. Most Roma and Sinti in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi authorites, where nearly all perished."
