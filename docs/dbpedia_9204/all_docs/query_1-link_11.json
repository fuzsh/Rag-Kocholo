        "text": "Overview\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, 356,830 persons in the Czechoslovak Republic identified themselves as Jews by religion: 117,551 in Bohemia and Moravia, 136,737 in Slovakia, and 102,542 in Subcarpathian Rus.\n\nThe partition of Czechoslovakia in 1938â€“1939 determined the fate of its Jews during World War II. After the breakup of Czechoslovakia, approximately 118,310 persons defined as Jews lived in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Before 1941, approximately 26,000 Jews were able to emigrate.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, the Germans and their collaborators killed approximately 263,000 Jews who had resided in the territory of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1938.\n\nDeportations from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\n\nOf 82,309 Jews deported from the Protectorate, the Germans and their collaborators killed approximately 71,000 in the Holocaust. The occupation authorities and their Czech collaborators killed another 7,000 Protectorate Jews in Bohemia and Moravia. By 1945, some 14,000 Protectorate Jews remained alive in the Czech lands.\n\nDeportations to Theresienstadt\n\nDeportations from and Deaths in Theresienstadt\n\nOf nearly 141,184 Jews to reside in Theresienstadt, the Germans deported 88,202 to the east, where most of them were killed. 33,456 died in Theresienstadt itself. 2,418 either escaped or were released by the Germans in 1945."
