        "text": "The anti-Nazi resistance in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia had many forms and some of them appear in the four-part miniseries of the Czech Mint. The first gold ducat was dedicated to the heroes of political and armed resistance. The second one commemorates the actions of the brave people who opposed the Nazis with a pen or brush in their hands and with a song on their lips.\n\nA number of Czech artists took part in the cultural resistance against the Nazi occupation, and the way they struggle for freedom of the homeland included a wide range of activities - from writing poems and creating drawings or cartoons for illegal printing to helping persecuted persons. The top representatives of the occupation regime realized the influence of the Czech elite on the minds of the protectorate citizens. Therefore, the resistance fighters, who were known from the film screen and who were famous for literary or musical talent, did not avoid the highest punishment. Thus many Czech artists were executed or put in concentration camps. Children learn about them at school today and their photos can be found on the textbook pages. Unfortunately, other names have been erased from history…\n\nThree of the cultural figures, who put their lives on the altar of humanity and freedom, appear on the obverse side of the ducat that was processed by Mgr. Petr Horák. The painting from the cycle Fire, which Josef Čapek used to protest against the Munich Agreement, became the central motif of the obverse side. The painting is accompanied by a painter's signature. The second signature, underlined by the music sheet, belongs to the Prague songwriter Karel Hašler. The third signature, accompanied by a pen, belongs to Vladislav Vančura, one of the most respected writers of his time. The reverse side of the mintage, which was made by the academic sculptor Jan Lukáš, then presents the Protectorate map shaded by the wings of the Nazi eagle. The composition of the reverse side is complemented by the years 1939 and 1945 and the inscription PROTECTORATE BOHEMIA AND MORAVIA in Czech and German.\n\nDucat was stored in a special packaging in the form of a book that contains period photographs and a treatise written by a respected historian PhDr. Petr Koura, Ph.D. You can store the collection of all four ducats in a collector's box which you can find in the offer of the Czech Mint."
