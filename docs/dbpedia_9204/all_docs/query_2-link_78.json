        "text": "Karl Hermann Frank (born Jan. 24, 1898, Karlsbad, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic]—died May 22, 1946, Prague, Czechoslovakia) was a German Nazi of the Sudetenland who became the virtual ruler of Bohemia and Moravia and ordered the destruction of the Czech village of Lidice.\n\nFrank studied at the University of Prague and was a bookseller before he turned to politics. A Sudeten “irredentist,” he agitated for the return to Germany of the German-speaking provinces of Czechoslovakia and joined the Sudeten German Party when it was organized. Rising to the party directorate, he represented the Sudeten Germans in the Czechoslovak parliament (1935–38). After Adolf Hitler annexed the Sudetenland following the Munich agreement of 1938, the party was absorbed by the Nazis, and in 1939 Frank was named state secretary to the Reich protector for Bohemia and Moravia and concurrently held the rank of minister. After Reinhardt Heydrich, then Reich protector, was assassinated by Czechoslovak patriots in 1942, Frank ordered the execution of the male population of the villages of Lidice and Lezaky in retribution. He held actual power in Bohemia and Moravia, though he was nominally subordinate to the new Reich protector, Wilhelm Frick.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II"
