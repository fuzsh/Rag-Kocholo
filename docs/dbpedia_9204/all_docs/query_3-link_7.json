        "text": "U.S. Recognition of Czechoslovaskian Independence, .\n\nThe tenth of President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points called for free opportunity for the “autonomous development” of the peoples of Austria-Hungary.\n\nOn September 3, 1918, Secretary of State Robert Lansing announced that the United States recognized the Czecho-Slovak National Council, which was resident in Paris, as a de facto government at war with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires and that it was prepared to enter into formal relations with it. The Czecho-Slovak National Council organized a Provisional Government on October 14 and declared its independence from Austria-Hungary on October 18, 1918.\n\nFirst U.S. Consular Post, Prague, .\n\nThe first U.S. consular post in Bohemia was in Prague. A consulate was opened in 1869 and closed April 9, 1917, after Austria-Hungary severed diplomatic relations with the United States.\n\nThe United States opened a Consulate General in Bratislava in 1947. It was closed in 1950 after the Communist Government of Czechoslovakia alleged that U.S. diplomatic personnel were engaged in espionage and other improper activities, and demanded a reduction in their numbers. For the establishment of an Embassy in Bratislava after the “Velvet Divorce,” see the entry for Slovakia.\n\nConsulate in Reichenberg (Liberec), .\n\nA Commercial Agency was opened in Reichenberg (Liberec) in 1886. It became a Consulate in 1893, was closed in 1917, and did not reopen after World War I.\n\nThere were also Commercial Agencies in Haida (Novy Bor) (1892-1908) and Brunn (Brno) (1863-1907).\n\nU.S.-Czechoslovakian Relations During World War II.\n\nWilbur J. Carr, former Assistant Secretary of State and Chief of the Consular Bureau, was Minister to Czechoslovakia when German forces occupied Prague on March 15, 1939, Carr closed the Legation on March 21, and departed on April 6. The United States did not recognize the establishment of a German protectorate over Bohemia and Moravia, or the establishment of the state of Slovakia.\n\nOn September 4, 1941, Anthony J. Drexel Biddle Jr. was appointed Minister to the Czechoslovakian Government in London. He presented his credentials on October 28. Biddle was also commissioned to the governments-in-exile of Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Biddle was promoted to Ambassador on June 4, 1943, and presented his new credentials on July 12. He left London on December 1, 1943.\n\nVladimir Hurban, the Czechoslovak Minister to the United States since 1936, was promoted to Ambassador and presented his new credentials on June 14, 1943.\n\nEstablishment of American Legation to Embassy Status, .\n\nEmbassy Prague was established on May 29, 1945 with Alfred W. Klieforth as Chargé d’Affaires ad interim. Laurence A. Steinhardt was appointed as the first U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia on December 20, 1944. He presented his credentials on July 20, 1945 and served until September 19, 1948. Steinhardt’s tour of duty covered the Sovietization of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDissolution of Czechoslovakia, .\n\nOn December 31, 1992, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic ceased to exist and was succeeded by two new states: the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nTreaties and Agreements\n\nCommericial relations treaty, October 1923.\n\nThe first treaty between the United States and Czechoslovakia dealt with commercial relations, and was signed at Prague on October 29, 1923. It entered into force on November 5. It was supplanted by a reciprocal trade agreement signed in Washington on March 7, 1938. It entered into force provisionally on April 16, 1938, but was terminated April 22, 1939.\n\nAir transport Services treaty, January 1946.\n\nThe first postwar agreement between the two countries dealt with air transport services, and was signed January 3, 1946 and entered into force on June 17, 1946.\n\nResources\n\nBevans, Charles I.
