HGR - from 1497 called Holly Roman Empire of German Nation, terminated in 1806) which has been existed in this period. From 1526 until 1806 the Habsburgs were also coronated as Roman Emperors and their monarchy was member of HRE. From 1804 until 1918 the Habsburgs were less powerfull sovereigns as Emperors of Austria (of Habsburg Monarchy).\n\n1526 â 1867: part of confederational state called Habsburg Monarchy. The Habsburgs ruled over Lands of Bohemian Crown (Czech lands) as Kings of Bohemia (less exact Czech kings)\n\n1867 â 1918: part of Austria-Hungary, its western part called Cis-Lithuania.\n\n1871 arising of unified German state, German Empire, under leading rule of Prussia (not of Habsburgâs Austria)\n\n1918 â 1992: Czechoslovakia\n\n(geographical name)\n\n1918 â 1938: Czechoslovak Republic (composed of Bohemia, Moravia, Czech Silesia, Slovakia, and Subcarpathian Ruthenia)\n\n1938 â 1945: Munich âAgreement\" â more exactly dictate (30. 9. 1938), loss of border regions\n\n1939: splittering into Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, (Bö hmen und Mä hren) as part of Germany and an âindependent\" Slovak State\n\n1945 â 1960: Czechoslovak Republic, 1945 loss of Subcrapatian Ruthenia (incorporated into Soviet Union)\n\n1960 â 1990: Czechoslovak Socialist Republic\n\n1968 â 1990: federation of Czech Socialist Republic (Czechia) and Slovak Socialist Republic (Slovakia)\n\n1990 â 1992: Czech and Slovak Federal Republic â federation of Czech Republic and Slovak Republic\n\n1. 1. 1993: Czech Republic\n\nâ Czechia (likewise appeared an independent Slovak Republic - Slovakia), Czechia is composed of Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia as territorial and historic geographical units.\n\ninternal boundaries:\n\nto 1849: between feudal administrative units (purishes) and historical lands (to 1949)\n\nsince 1850: hierarchie of basic teritorial units: municipality, judical district, political district, (1850 â 1855 region), historical land\n\nsince 1949: municipality, political district, region, state\n\nsince 1968: municipality, political district, region, republic, federal republic\n\nsince 1990: municipality, political district, republic (to 1993 federal republic)\n\nsince 2000: municipality, political district, region (self-government), republic\n\n(B) ADMINISTRATIVE GEOGRAPHY\n\nQ. Describe the MODERN hierarchy of geographical areas used for civil administration:\n\nBottom layer: cadasters (14,500)\n\nNext layer: municipalities â 6,500 (NUTS V)\n\nNext layer: districts â 76 (NUTS IV)\n\nNext layer: regions - 14 (NUTS III)\n\nQ. How long has this system existed?\n\ncadasters and parishes from 1817 (with a little changes),\n\nmunicipalities from 1850\n\ndistricts from 1960\n\nregions from 2000\n\nQ. Describe earlier administrative geographies:\n\nsee the description of the development of Czech boundaries\n\nQ. Can we identify a hierarchy of broadly similar units that exist for all countries?\n\ncadaster and parishes are identical with units in Austria, Slovenia, Germany and Slovakia, regions are identical with NUTS III units\n\n(C) POPULATION CENSUSES\n\nQ. When was the first national census of population carried out?\n\nThere was an abortive attempt to organise a census between 1850. The first census to be successfully completed took place in 1869.\n\nQ. Outline the later history of the census. Have censuses been carried out at regular intervals, and if so with what frequency?\n\nCensuses in Czechia were organised regularly, every 10 years, except in case of 1941 (1869, 1880, 1890, 1900, 1910, 1921, 1930, 1950, 1961, 1970, 1980, 1991)\n\nQ. What are the main geographical units used in published reports? Have these changed over time?\n\nParishes, municipalities, districts and regions. The changes of the districts and regions during last 150 years were rather significant (we are going to present maps of changes in Florence).\n\n1849\n\n1855\n\n1868\n\n1928\n\n1948\n\n1949\n\n1960\n\n2000\n\nPD\n\nJD\n\nPD\n\nJD\n\nPD\n\nJD\n\nPD\n\nJD\n\nPD\n\nJD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nBohemia\n\n79\n\n208\n\n208\n\n-\n\n89\n\n208\n\n105\n\n228\n\n115\n\n227\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nMoravia\n\n25\n\n76\n\n76\n\n-\n\n30\n\n76\n\n45\n\n106\n\n48\n\n108\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSilesia\n\n7\n\n7\n\n27\n\n-\n\n7\n\n7\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nCzechia\n\n131\n\n291\n\n311\n\n-\n\n126\n\n291\n\n150\n\n334\n\n163\n\n335\n\n187\n\n75\n\n76\n\nkm2 (avera-ge)\n\n602\n\n271\n\n254\n\n-\n\n625\n\n271\n\n526\n\n236\n\n484\n\n236\n\n421\n\n1052\n\n1038\n\nPD â political district\n\nJD â judical district\n\nD - district\n\nQ. Is there access to more detailed unpublished information? If so, what geographical units do these refer to? Here again, have these units changed over time?\n\nDetailed land-use data was on the Czech territory first collected more than 180 years ago as part of cadastral records (initially called stable cadaster). It was necessary to create a base on which land tax - main source of the state budget â would be calculated. As a side result, precise triangulation network came into existence and cadastral maps (scale 1:2880) were created. Maps were later transformed to the scale 1:2000. The actual plot areas were calculated from these cadastral maps and all maps of medium scales were derived from them.\n\nQ. What publications describe the history of the census, and of census geographies? Are any available in English?\n\nRetrospektivnÃ­ lexikon obcÃ­ ÄSSR I â IV, Praha, 1977\n\n(D) VITAL REGISTRATION\n\nQ. When was the recording of vital events (births, marriages and deaths) first required by law?\n\nVital events firstly appeared in church registers in 1781, from 1918 in civil registers.\n\nQ. What organisation was responsible for recording vital events? How has this changed over time?\n\nParochial offices from 1781 till now. Besides from 1918 civil offices (municipalities).\n\nQ. What geographical units were used in recording vital events?\n\nInitially parishes under ecclesiastical registration and, from 1850 parishes as municipalities.\n\n(E) TAXATION RECORDS\n\nQ. What historical taxation records exist for your area?\n\nEdict \"Berní rula\" â 1653-55\n\nStable cadaster from 1817.\n\nQ. What geographical units do these use?\n\nCadasters and taxation districts.\n\n(F) OTHER MAJOR HISTORICAL SOURCES SUITABLE FOR MAPPING\n\nQ. What other major sources exist, and what geographical units do they use?\n\nmanors, feudal administration\n\n(G) MODERN GEOGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORKS\n\nQ. When was the first computerised map of administrative units created?\n\nEarly 90-ieth.\n\nQ. What does it show?\n\nCadasters, parishes, districts, regions and their modifications for administrative, fiscal, censual, electoral purposes.\n\nQ. How easily is it to obtain a copy?\n\nSome of the coverages are free available (cadastral, district, region leyers), other coverages are subject to copyright but they are available easily (cheaply) for the academic community.\n\n(H) HISTORICAL SOURCES FOR BOUNDARY MAPPING\n\nQ. Who was responsible for changing boundaries? How has this changed over time?\n\nOffice of historical lands till 1850 and Cadastral office from 1850.\n\nIn present it is Czech Land Survey in Prague.\n\nQ. Who was responsible for creating a legal record of boundary changes?\n\nIn present it is Czech Land Survey in Prague.\n\nQ. What records have been preserved of boundary changes? Are they published or unpublished? How do they describe the old and new boundaries? How accurately do they give the dates of changes?\n\nThe changes are recorded in low collection.\n\nQ. Who was responsible for mapping your area? When was this organisation created?\n\nCzech Land Survey in Prague.\n\nQ. When did systematic mapping of boundaries begin?\n\nIn 1824 at a scale 1:2880.\n\nQ. What maps are available showing boundaries?\n\nTheresiansâ Cadaster - 1751-58\n\nJosephsâ Cadaster - 1785-89\n\nStable Cadaster - (1817) 1824-43\n\nCadaster of Real Estate - now\n\nQ. For periods before maps are available, are there descriptions of boundaries in words? Where are they preserved? How easy are they to interpret?\n\nNone.\n\n(I) KNOWN PROJECTS\n\nQ. What research projects have gathered information on HISTORICAL boundaries for your area?\n\nLand Use/Land Cover: Development, consequences, perspectives. (project on Faculty of Science, Charles University Prague, supported by Czech grant agency)\n\n(J) ASSOCIATED METADATA (Gazetters, etc)\n\nQ. What historical gazetteers are available for your area, in published or unpublished form? How do they indicate the location of the places listed? Do they cover variant forms of names?\n\nLow collection and Central gazetteers from 1850.\n\nQ. Are more specialised geographical thesaurii available?\n\nUnofficial geographical thesaurii are available from 1970.\n\n© Lucie Kupkova (Prague, May 2000)"
