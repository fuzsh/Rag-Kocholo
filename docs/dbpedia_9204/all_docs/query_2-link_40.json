        "text": "Get 50 Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia Stamps in One Easy Order\n\nStart a new specialty collection of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia stamps today with this convenient, money-saving set. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was a territory occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II beginning March 16, 1939. It was one of many areas of Czech lands to be occupied by the Nazis. It was a dark time in Czech history, with many ethnic Czech's subjected to the same horrible treatment as the Jews. While all this was going on, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile remained hidden. During the time the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia existed (between 1939 and 1945), over 100 stamps were issued by the Germans for use in the Protectorate. These included definitives, commemoratives, charity stamps, newspaper stamps, and official stamps. Get your set of 50 Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia stamps today."
