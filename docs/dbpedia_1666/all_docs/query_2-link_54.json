        "text": "After clicking onto the 2023 Marshall Chess Club Labor Day GM Norm Invitational page at Lichess.org a short time after the first round started I was startled to see the first board game had already finished:\n\nNagy, Gabor (2452)\n\n– Barbosa, Oliver (2476)\n\n2023 Marshall Chess Club Labor Day GM Norm Invitational (New York, New York), 31.08.2023\n\n1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.d4 Nf6 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 c6 7.cxd5 cxd5 1/2-1/2\n\nhttps://chess-results.com/PartieSuche.aspx?art=36&id=4896883\n\nThe player with the white pieces is a FM, which stands for “FIDE Master.” The player in charge of the black pieces is a GM, which is short for “Grandmaster.” At one time ‘back in the day’ the Grandmaster title had cachet. Now that the Chess world is replete with so-called “Grandmasters” the title has become meaningless. Consider the fact that the highest rated human Chess player on planet Earth, Magnus Carlsen, of Norway, was once rated about FOUR HUNDRED POINTS higher than Oliver Barbosa of the Phillipines. A class “A” rating begins at ‘1800’. The National Master (NM) title is attained when the rating of a player hits 2200. There is a two category difference between Magnus and Barbosa. Therefore, Magnus Carlsen is to Oliver Barbosa what a National Master is to a 1800 rated player.\n\nAfter seeing the above “game”, and I use the word very loosely, the decision was made to not watch any of the games emanating from the venerable Marshall Chess Club (https://www.marshallchessclub.org/).\n\nMy first thought after seeing that FIRST ROUND DRAW was something along the lines of, “Barbosa has insulted not only the venerable Marshall Chess Club, but also the man for whom it was named, former many time United States Chess Champion, Frank Marshall.\n\nIn addition, he has insulted Caïssa (https://www.chessjournal.com/caissa/). The not much of a man’s passport should be revoked and he should be sent packing back to the islands immediately.”\n\nHow much “thought” do you think went into that short, first round seven move draw?\n\nPrior to writing this post I went to lichess.org and clicked onto the “results” page (https://chess-results.com/tnr802031.aspx?lan=1&art=1) learning the so-called “Grandmaster” rated two categories below Magnus Calsen won the event, even though he lost a game. He may have lost more than one game if any of the wimpy players who agreed to the short draws with the not GM had the cojones to play like a man and not a eunuch because, as you will see below, there was one player with balls enough to defeat the misnamed “grandmaster,” FM Luo Terry of the United States of America.\n\nNagy, Gabor (2452) – Barbosa, Oliver (2476)\n\n2023 Marshall Chess Club Labor

finishing one half point in front of FM Aaron Jacobson and GM Mark Paragua.\n\nHow do you think things would have turned out if a draw earned only 1/4 point?\n\nIt has been my policy to approve all comments left by readers, especially if signed by the respondent, with only a few exceptions. It bothers me not if I am criticized because one of the things that sets our country apart is freedom of the press. I have even printed comments left by people using a nom de plume. However, there is a line and I do enforce the line from time to time.\n\nA scathing comment was left recently by someone disgruntled because of what had been written in the post, Chess Segregation. (https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/chess-segregation/) The writer was obviously “ticked off” by, “There are more women and girls involved with Chess than ever before and it started with the so-called “youth movement,” which began when money earmarked for Master Chess was, shall we say to be kind, diverted to children’s Chess.”\n\nAmong the many things I was called during the diatribe was “liar.”\n\nI am sixty nine years of age and will be the first to admit my memory is not what it used to be. Still, having participated in brain and memory studies at Emory, Georgia Tech and the Veteran’s Administration (the results of which were to be used to help veterans who had served our country), I am thankful for how much better off than others even younger than am I. That said, I will admit to having an occasional “Senior moment” which is exacerbated by fatigue.\n\nAfter receiving the salvo comment I racked my brain in an attempt to recall what and where I had read concerning the diversion of funds. I seemed to recall something former POTUSCF Don Schultz had written in a Chess Life magazine, thinking it was a letter to the editor, but I could be mistaken. I went to the internet in an attempt to locate anything about the matter. What you are about to read is the only thing I managed to locate. If anyone can shed any more light on the subject please leave a comment.\n\nHonor the Intent\n\nby Don Schultz\n\nDuring the 1990s the direction of the American Chess Foundation changed from sponsoring a wide variety of chess projects to almost exclusively promoting their highly successful New York City inner city school programs. In order to emphasize this redirection, the American Chess Foundation changed their name to Chess-in-the-Schools. Although their inner school programs continue to be enormously successful, part of the funding of these programs comes from income from donations of patrons who intended other uses for their contributions.\n\nCase in point, when former USCF President Fred Cramer died in April 1989 he bequeathed a quarter of a million dollars to the ACF. Throughout his life, Cramer was an avid advocate for better communication and improved chess journalism, particularly at the state level. In order to partially satisfy Cramer’s wishes, Fan Adams, then President of the ACF, used a portion of the income from the Cramer bequest to sponsor the Cramer Awards for Excellence in Chess Journalism. Unfortunately Chess-in-the-Schools has now cancelled their financial support of the Cramer Awards Program. They did this so they can redirect all of the income from the Cramer bequest to support their NYC inner city school programs.\n\nThe Cramer Awards for Excellence in Chess Journalism are not the only victim of the Chess-in-the-Schools new policy. An example is the income from over a million dollars of Thomas Emery donations. Emery was a close friend of many of our finest players, including Frank Marshall and Al Horowitz. He helped support master chess. He also was a member of the Marine Corps during World War I and as a result had an enduring interest in armed forces chess. He sponsored the first Armed Forces Championship in 1960, and continued to sponsor it during his lifetime. He had every expectation that income from his donations would continue to be used for master and armed forces chess promotions. But it is not. All of it is now being used for the Chess-in-the Schools New York City inner city school programs.\n\nChess-in-the-Schools does continue to support a few projects unrelated to their inner school programs. These include the Denker High School Invitational and the Paul Albert Awards. But the patrons for these projects are still living and members of their Board.\n\nHowever invaluable the Chess-in-the-School programs are, income from bequests and contributions such as those from Cramer and Emery should be used to pay for the intended programs of the patron. If you agree with this assessment, please express your feelings to Members of the Board, Chess-in-the-Schools, 353 West 46th Street, New York, NY 10036, tel. 212 643-0225, fax 212 757-7704.\n\nhttp://www.chessnews.org/acf.html\n\nWalk A Mile In My Shoes\n\nJoe South\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nIf I could be you\n\nAnd you could be me\n\nFor just one hour\n\nIf we could find a way\n\nTo get inside\n\nEach other’s mind, mmm\n\nIf you could see you\n\nThrough my eyes\n\nInstead of your ego\n\nI believe you’d be\n\nSurprised to see\n\nThat you’d been blind, mmm\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWalk a mile in my shoes\n\nWalk a mile in my shoes\n\nHey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse\n\nWalk a mile in my shoes\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nNow your whole world\n\nYou see around you\n\nIs just a reflection\n\nAnd the law of karma\n\nSays you’re gonna reap\n\nJust what you sow, yes you will\n\nSo unless\n\nYou’ve lived a life of total perfection\n\nYou’d better be careful of every stone\n\nThat you should throw, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAnd yet we spend the day\n\nThrowing stones\n\nAt one another\n\n‘Cause I don’t think\n\nOr wear my hair\n\nThe same way you do, mmm\n\nWell I may be\n\nCommon people\n\nBut I’m your brother\n\nAnd when you strike out\n\nAnd try to hurt me\n\nIt’s a hurtin’ you, lord have mercy\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWalk a mile in my shoes\n\nWalk a mile in my shoes\n\nHey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse\n\nWalk a mile in my shoes\n\n[Verse 4]\n\nThere are people\n\nOn reservations\n\nAnd out in the ghettos\n\nAnd brother there\n\nBut for the grace of God\n\nGo you and I, yeah, yeah\n\nIf I only\n\nHad the wings\n\nOf a little angel\n\nDon’t you know I’d fly\n\nTo the top of the mountain\n\nAnd then I’d cry\n\nhttps://genius.com/Joe-south-walk-a-mile-in-my-shoes-lyrics\n\nThe games from the National Open were being broadcast by a website new to me, FollowChess (http://followchess.com/news/).

Seven times Chigorin played 2 Qe2 against his opponent’s French defense. If you have not played over the match I urge you do do so. It can be found at a fantastic historical website, chessgames.com (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=85135)\n\nHere is a game played by Chigorin and the man who lost the US Chess Championship to Frank Marshall,\n\nJackson Whipps Showalter,\n\non June 13, 1899 in London.

Your first instinct may be something like, “What the hell kinda move is THAT?!” You cannot say this because Allen is a “Priest.” So you stifle yourself and say, “That is a bad move.” Although a middle-aged man Allen looks like one of your young students as he hangs his head before asking, “Why is it bad?” As you sit gazing into the distance you consider his lowly 701 rating and recall some of the lame opening moves you played in the past before replying, “Because it is unnecessary.” Then you tell him about how important time is in the opening phase of the game, and of the many things one needs to accomplish in the opening, such as development, etc. You would follow by explaining why 5 g3, to develop the bishop, is the way to play this particular opening. This would also be the time you attempted to explain why h4 may be a decent move in the opening if black has weakened his pawn structure when playing g6. This would make Allen feel a little better, especially if you add, “In many openings the same moves are played, but what matters is not the move played, but the order in which they are played. There must be a reason for every move.” Since you must sit there and see the remaining moves of Allen’s game you decide to show him the opening moves of the game between Dimitri Bogdanov (2175) and Bjorn Brinck Claussen (2354) from the 21st Politiken Cup in 1999 at Copenhagen. 1 e4 e6 2 Qe2 Be7 3 Nf3 d5 4 e5 Nh6 5 g3 f5 6 d4 Nf7 7 h4. “See how the pawn stops any black piece from coming to g5?” you ask. “Now the rook pawn move has a purpose,” you say as the color begins returning to Allen’s face. This causes you to show him the rest of the game before having to get back to his game. After all, you are getting paid by the hour…\n\n7…c5 8. dxc5 Na6 9. Be3 Qc7 10. Bg2 Nxc5 11. Bd4 O-O 12.

Reports have been slow in coming even in this age of instant access. I was mortified this morning to read about the death of another player after the conclusion of the tournament. Reports are that he was found dead in his hotel room.\n\nI have spent the morning reading all the reports that could be found. I have a personal interest in this not only because I am a Senior, but because I collapsed at the board during a chess tournament, with paramedics having to be called. This was at the 32nd Continental Open in Sturbridge, Massachusetts in 2002. Upon regaining consciousness I saw FM Miles Ardaman hovering over me. Knowing Miles to be a psychiatrist, I feared the worst. I refused to be transported to a hospital, but did see a doctor a few days later. After checking me out and talking with me about what may have possibly caused the collapse, he surmised I had become dehydrated. I traveled to the Continental directly from the US Open in New Jersey where after playing in the normal schedule, with games each evening. The first two games at the C.O. were also at night, but the third, and my last, was a morning round. I had coffee, but hardly any water because I feared spending too much time going to the restroom. It was a mistake I have not repeated. For quite some time I had been sitting with a full bladder trying to make time control. When I stood up quickly and took a few steps, my heart could not make the adjustment, which happens as one ages. I also learned of a heart murmur. Often I wonder why I am still alive…\n\nMost Seniors have some kind of health problem, and I am not an exception, as there is a problem with my heart. My father lived many years with a machine in his body, a pacemaker. I have chosen to not be a member of the Borg, part man and machine. During the two decade run of the Atlanta Chess and What Other Game Center more than one player had to be taken away in an ambulance, none of whom were young.\n\nWith this in mind I have written extensively on my blogs, the BaconLOG and now the Armchair Warrior, concerning the dangers faced by Senior chess players. I have also spoken out about the problems faced by Senior players. Unfortunately, my words have fallen on dear ears.\n\nI have written about several measures that could be instituted in order to lessen the chances of a death at the board during a Senior tournament. One of the major problems has been that organizers schedule a Senior chess tournament as if it were a tournament for younger players. Most weekend tournaments have five rounds with the first beginning Friday night. Since the last round is over sometime Sunday evening, that means five games of chess are played in about forty eight hours. That is a lot of chess for even younger players. It is simply too much for a Senior. Even when I was in my twenties a five round tournament would leave me what the Legendary Georgia Ironman calls a, “wiped out Waldo.” I began taking a half-point bye in the third round Saturday night in order to continue playing. I will no longer play a serious, long game at night.\n\nFor a Senior tournament I have suggested having no more than four rounds, with two each day. I have also suggested a break of at least two hours between the games. Bob Mahan, the man behind the Chess For Seniors Association (http://www.chessforseniors.org/index.php) had the audacity to tell me that would mean a delay in the time the organizers and TD’s would get home from an event, which shows the thinking by even some Seniors when it comes to the safety of the players.\n\nThere are many stories in the press concerning the deaths at the Olympiad, including one on Chessbase, where one finds this:\n\n“There was momentary chaos in the hall when Meier collapsed, which was explained by Morgan Lillegård, head of communication for the Chess Olympics, in The Local: “People in the hall thought the defibrillator was a weapon. Panic spread because the thought there was an armed person. I can definitely confirm there was no weapons. This is a misunderstanding. It is in itself dramatic enough that someone had a heart attack.”\n\nThe Guardian comments that Meier is not the first player to die in the middle of a match: in 2000 Vladimir Bagirov, a Latvian grandmaster, had a fatal heart attack during a tournament in Finland, while in the same year another Latvian, Aivars Gipslis, suffered a stroke while playing in Berlin, from which he later died. To this we add that Johann Zukertort died from a cerebral hemorrhage suffered during a game in Simpson’s Divan, in a tournament which he was leading at the time. José Raúl Capablanca died of a stroke in March 1942 while watching a skittles game at the Manhattan Chess Club.\n\nOther players who died during a chess tournament or game: Gideon Stahlberg (1908-1967), Vladimir Simagin 1919-1968), Cecil Purdy (1906-1979), Ed Edmundson (1920-1982). The following players died very shortly after a game or event: Frank Marshall (1877-1944), Efim Bogoljubov (1889-1952), Herman Steiner (1905-1955), Paul Keres (1916-1975), Alexei Suetin (1926-2001).”\n\nhttp://en.chessbase.com/post/deaths-at-the-chess-olympiad\n\nThe most interesting is, “Why chess is really an extreme sport,” by Stephen Moss, online at theguardian.com. The tag line reads, “The deaths of two players at the Chess Olympiad in Norway shows that it’s time tournaments came with a health warning.” In the article he writes, ” Chess, though the non-player might not believe this, is in many ways an extreme sport.”\n\n“At the Olympiad, participants were playing a game a day over a fortnight – 11 rounds with just a couple of rest days on which to recuperate. For up to seven hours a day, they would be sitting at the board trying to kill – metaphorically speaking – their opponent, because this is the ultimate game of kill or be killed. In some positions, you can reach a point where both sides are simultaneously within a single move of checkmating the other. One false step and you will have lost. This imposes enormous pressure on players.”\n\nStephen is a player, as can be learned from this, ” I spend a day at work, rush home, bolt down a meal, then go to my chess club and play a three-hour game which often makes me feel ill, especially if I lose. After that, usually around 10.30pm, I go home, go to bed, and frequently fail to sleep as my moves and mistakes revolve around my head.”\n\nThe author concludes with this paragraph, “So next time someone suggests a nice, quiet game of chess, or paints it as an intellectual pursuit played by wimps, tell them they’ve got it all wrong: this is a fight to the finish played in the tensest of circumstances by two players who are physically and mentally living on the edge. We all need to get fitter to play this demanding game, and society should recognise it for what it is – a sport as challenging, dramatic and exciting as any other. Such recognition would be a tribute of sorts to the two players who sadly played their final games in Tromso.”\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/16/chess-extreme-sport\n\nIt is a shame this may be what it takes for those in power to take notice and institute changes, especially in the way Senior chess tournaments are implemented."
