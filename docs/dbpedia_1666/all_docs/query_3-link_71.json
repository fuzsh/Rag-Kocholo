As a California Junior Tennis Champion, Davidson was the top-ranked female junior player in Northern California, being the state’s champion in women’s singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nIn 1947, Davidson attended the University of Miami (FL) on one of the institution’s first-ever women’s athletic scholarships. While there, she won the Eastern Intercollegiate Championships. In 1949, Davidson reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, the U.S. Championships at the time. Davidson would continue her time on tour, playing at Wimbledon, the French Open, and all across the globe, resulting in five various top ten women’s singles world rankings. Between 1946 and 1956, Davidson would reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, the semifinals at the French Open, and would win the 1950 French Open Mixed Doubles title.\n\nIn her later years, Davidson began competing again, this time as a senior in national and international tournaments. She was ranked as high as No. 2 in the world in the 70-plus age division.\n\nOutside of tennis, Davidson enjoyed collecting fine art, something she became passionate about due to her international travels. She was inducted into the ITA Women’s Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004, and the USTA Northern California Tennis Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nBelmar Gunderson – Known as the “Mother of Women’s Intercollegiate Tennis” Belmar Gunderson made leaps and bounds for the sport of women’s college tennis. From 1975-76, Gunderson became the first director of the University of Minnesota women’s athletics department, laying the foundation for future generations of student-athletes.\n\nFollowing her time in that position, Gunderson worked as the university’s extramural and intramural sports director, teaching in the physical education department and coaching several sports, before leading the new women’s department. In his role, Gunderson spearheaded the formation of the Patty Berg Scholarship Fund to provide athletic scholarships to women. Her efforts led to an annual department budget of $330,000.\n\nGunderson found a great deal of success on the court herself in the early 1950s at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She competed in many premier tennis tournaments, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis National Championships. Gunderson was nationally ranked as high as No. 11 in singles and No. 2 in doubles, competing in USTA and ITF World doubles events for decades following her time in Greensboro.\n\nBy the conclusion of her playing and professional career, Gunderson dedicated over 50 years to women’s athletics. She was inducted into the Minnesota M Club Hall of Fame in 2003 and was a charter member of the UNC-Greensboro Athletics Hall of Fame in 2000.

Under head coach J.D. Morgan, Perry and his teammates finished first nationally for three subsequent seasons. During that time, UCLA collected a 41-5 record.\n\nIn his first season with the Bruins, Perry finished as a runner-up at the NCAA singles and doubles tournament.
