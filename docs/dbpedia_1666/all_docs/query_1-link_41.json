        "text": "13th December 2022 (Last Updated 14th February 2024)\n\nGerald Micklem was a major figure in the world of golf for the 30 years following the end of World War II. First as a leading player and then as a distinguished captain, selector and administrator.\n\nGerald Micklem\n\nGerald Hugh Micklem was born on 14th August 1911, to Hugh and Isabella, in Burgh Heath near Banstead in Surrey, England. Hugh was a stockjobber in the City and made a sizeable fortune trading oil and mining company shares. In 1920 the family moved out to a huge mansion near Sevenoaks in Kent and Gerald and his sister Joan, who was born in 1914, enjoyed a privileged upbringing.\n\nHe was educated at Grange Preparatory School and Winchester College before going up to Oxford University in 1930. He enjoyed playing football and cricket at school but was more successful in the classroom than on the playing fields. He started to play golf as a teenager at his local club Wildernesse.\n\nPerhaps lacking in motivation, due to his family’s wealth and a career path that was no doubt already laid out for him, he flunked his studies in philisophy, politics and economics at Oxford. He became obsessed with golf whilst at University and was determined to win a blue. He finally achieved his aim in his final year playing for Oxford in a University match in 1933 at Prince’s G.C., albeit he lost both his foursomes and singles games.\n\nHis education at Winchester and Oxford opened up two golfing opportunities that Gerald would enjoy throughout the rest of his life.\n\nHe represented Winchester in the Halford Hewitt public school ten man foursomes team competition on 37 occassions between 1933 and 1971. He played 85 matches at Deal with 11 different partners winning 51, losing 32 and halving two. Winchester won in 1948 with Gerald and his partner Peter Foster winning all five of their matches during the tournament.\n\nThe Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society, which was hugely influential at the time, was the other group he would go on to fully participate in. He would certainly have been delighted to win the President’s Putter in 1953 beating ‘Laddie’ Lucas in the Final. He played in 36 consecutive Putter’s between 1934 and 1976 winning 76 of his 111 matches on the Rye links. He became a member of the Society’s committee in 1938 and would go on to be President (1971-74), Captain (1964-65), Secretary and Treasurer (1953-59). During his life he played in 248 fixtures for the Society against the two founding Universities and other Golf Clubs and Socieities.\n\nAfter University Micklem joined the leading London stockbrokers Cazenove where his Uncle Charles was a senior partner. He would practice at Wildernesse early in the morning before catching the train in to the City where he immediately made a positive impact in a business development role.\n\nOn the golf course he proved to be a late developer. There were few successes and his early playing years were notable for his poor temperament than high finishes. He got to the semi-finals of the President’s Putter in 1936, partnered Arthur Lacey to a runner-up finish in the 1936 Addington Foursomes and reached the last 16 of the English Amateur in 1937 but there was generally little to show for his efforts. Whilst he was clearly improving his temperament was not best suited to the vagaries of match play which most of the leading tournaments utilised at this time.\n\nHe finally made a break through when he won the 36-hole Prince of Wales Challenge Cup at Royal Cinque Ports in 1939 but any momentum was lost with the onset of the Second World War. He joined the Grenadier Guards in February 1940 and saw action across Europe and in North Africa.\n\nUnsurprisingly he returned from war a different man and his peak playing years proved to be 1946 to 1955. He was now mature enough to manage his own mind and no doubt benefitted from the reduced participation in sports during this post-war period of austerity. Gerald was able to capitalise due to his commitment to practicing and the availability of time and money to pursue his passion.\n\nHe was made a partner and moved into a research role at Cazenove in the late 1940s. After his father died in May 1951 he received a considerable inheritance which enabled him to acquire Titlarks Hill House, a property which backs onto the 16th hole of Sunningdale’s New Course. In 1954, aged 43, he retired and with no family commitments settled fully into a golfing life.\n\nGerald Micklem\n\nHe first came to national prominence on the playing front when he beat USA favourite Frank Stranahan 4&3 in the last 16 of the 1946 Amateur Championship at Royal Birkdale before losing to the 1937 champion Robert Sweeny Jr in the Semi’s.\n\nHe played in 17 Amateur Championships between 1933 and 1958. He won 30 of his 47 matches but never came close to victory.\n\nMicklem’s greatest success came in the English Amateur Close Championship which he won in 1947 and 1953. In 1947 he beat Charlie Stowe by 1 Hole in the 36-hole Final at Ganton before more impressively beating Ronnie White 2&1 at Royal Birkdale – White was one of the world’s best players at the time and was playing on his home course. In total he played in 12 English Amateurs between 1937 and 1955, winning 30 of his 40 matches.\n\nMicklem played in the Brabazon Trophy (the English Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship) seven times between 1947, the year it started, and 1956. He finished in the top five on four occassions but suffered heartbreak at Ganton in 1952. Needing just a bogey five to win he contrived to take an eight on the par 4 72nd hole.\n\nHe won the Berkshire Trophy by 11 shots in 1955, 28 36-hole competitions, including the Royal St. George’s Grand Challenge Cup in 1952, and 10 18-hole gold medal events. These open club competitions were the staple of his annual golfing calendar.\n\nAway Walker Cup matches enabled him to play in the 1949 and 1957 U.S. Amateur Championship’s and the 1953 Canadian Amateur but with no success.\n\nHe was a keen foursomes player and had some success in this format too. In 1948 he partnered Charlie Ward to victory in the Daily Telegraph Pro-Am Foursomes Tournament at Royal Lytham and won The Antlers event at Royal Mid-Surrey in both 1951 and 1956, partnering David Blair and Alan Bussell.\n\nMicklem became a regular in international matches during this period mainly down to his results but also in no small part due to the fact he could contribute to the travel costs and had the time to play.\n\nHe played in four Walker Cup matches; 1947, 1949, 1953 and 1955. GB&I lost all four of them and his individual record read played six, lost five, won one – a foursomes with John Morgan in 1953 at Kittansett.\n\nAmateurs v. Professionals matches were played frequently throughout this post-war period often as part of a Ryder Cup or Walker Cup warm up. Gerald played for the amateurs in 1947, 1949, 1954 and 1955, captained the team in 1956 and 1958 and was a selector for the final one in 1959.\n\nHe represented England in the Men’s Home Internationals for nine consecutive years between 1947-55. England won on four occassions with Gerald winning 15 singles and 13 foursomes and halving two singles and three foursomes in 25 matches.\n\nHe also represented England in their match with France in 1947, 1948 and 1954. England won all three of these contests with Gerald contributing five wins and one half in a successful record.\n\nIn total Micklem represented England on 55 occasions winning 33 of these games.\n\nThe 1949 Walker Cup team played a match against Canada on their 1949 trip. The match was drawn 6-6, Gerald winning his singles but losing his foursomes with Max McCready.\n\nIn 1954 Micklem helped organise the inaugural Commonwealth Tournament at St. Andrews which was arranged to celebrate the bicentenary of The R&A.\n\nHe retired from competitive golf in 1955 and immediately moved into international captaincy and selection for both the England Golf Union and The R&A. Working closely with Raymond Oppenheimer they professionalised the selection process and, leveraging their positions within both organisations, effectively ran British golf in the 1950s and ‘60s.\n\nMicklem had been a selector for the England Boys team from 1952 (a role he continued until 1984 !) and stepped up to the Men’s in 1956. He captained them to a big win against the French and at the Home Internationals before leading the British Isles against the Continent of Europe in the first St. Andrews Trophy match. Shortly afterwards he was appointed GB&I captain for the 1957 Walker Cup match. He was re-appointed to all of them, including the GB&I Eisenhower Trophy in 1958, for a number of years. An organised person with an eye for detail he looked after his players and with a clear competitive streak proved to be successful. He fully embraced coaching and ensured all of the players received quality support, normally engaging John Jacobs in this regard.\n\nHe captained GB&I’s Walker Cup team in 1957 and 1959 and with the help of his great friend Raymond Oppenheimer, captain in 1951 and chairman of selectors in 1955, scoured Britain for the best players whilst also trying to raise playing standards. It was to no avail as two more defeats were chalked up during his period in office. Micklem then moved upstairs becoming the Chairman of Selectors for GB&I teams between 1960-63.\n\nMicklem and Oppenheimer both saw it as their duty to develop junior golfers. They encouraged The R&A to take over the running of the Boys’ Amateur Championship in 1948 to raise its profile and were key in the formation of the Golf Foundation in 1952 which greatly widened access to the game. The Gerald Micklem Charitable Trust, a grant-making trust and a registered charity established by the will of the late Micklem in 1988, donated £60,000 to The Golf Foundtion in 2013.\n\nRoy Ullyettt’s Association of Golf Writers Menu Cartoon, June 1966\n\nMicklem joined The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in March 1946 and quickly established himself as a keen Committee member. In an unprecedented length of service he held the following R&A Committee positions, which exclude his selection roles, and became a hugely powerful figure:-\n\nCommittees\n\nGeneral – 1955-58, 1960-71\n\nChampionship – 1946–48, 1951-53, 1962-65 (Chairman 1963-65)\n\nRules of Golf – 1954, 1956-57, 1960-63 (Chairman 1960-62)\n\nSub-Committees\n\nAmateur Status – 1964-67 (Established and Chaired by 1964-67)\n\nDecisions 1955-57\n\nEquipment 1955-57\n\nAs Chairman of the Championship Committee in the early 1960s he played a key role in re-establishing The Open as a major Championship by improving the field, via exemptions to qualifying, raising prize money and improving the spectator experience. Other roles saw him help with the introduction of the larger 1.68” diameter golf ball, favoured by the USGA, which raised playing standards throughout Britain and Europe. He was also instrumental in the gradual relaxation of the amateur status rules much of which was formalised after he stood down.\n\nHe became Captain of The R&A in 1968 and despite being an existing member was upgraded to Honorary status in 1982, reflecting the contribution he had made to both to the game and organisation. One can assume he continued to play an active role in R&A affairs well into the 1980s.\n\nHe was made President of the English Golf Union in 1965 and the European Golf Association in 1967-69.\n\nHe recorded every round of golf that he played from August 1946 until his final round in 1984 in 19 bespoke golf diaries – over 4,600 rounds. Between 1947 and 1958 he averaged an astonishing 228 rounds of golf each year showing an impressive appetite for the game for a man around 40 years old. By the mid-1960s he was playing considerably less golf as his adminstrative responsibilities, declining performances and ill health started to take their toll so he also started to record the numerous events he attended and watched.\n\nMicklem was a member of 12 golf clubs, namely, Wildernesse (where he learnt to play and was his home club, president 1954-64), Sunningdale (the club he played at most frequently; captain 1960, president 1984-88), Addington, The R&A, Royal Liverpool, Royal St. George’s (captain 1975), Royal Worlington (captain 1966), Rye (captain 1953), Southfield (the home of Oxford University), Swinley Forest, Temple and Woking. His favourite course was unquestionably the Old at St. Andrews.\n\nAfter a lengthy illness Gerald Micklem died on 21st May 1988 at the age of 76. A very well attended Memorial Service was held on 6th July at The Guard’s Chapel in Wellington Barracks, London.\n\nHis contribution and life were and have since been celebrated with numerous awards and commemorative tropies.\n\nThe Gerald Micklem Trophy was inaugurated in 1954 at Woking Golf Club. To this day the top public schools of Eton, Harrow, Wellington, Charterhouse, Rugby, Bradfield, Winchester and Stowe compete against each other in this golfing competition.\n\nIn 1965 he was awarded the Golf Writer’s Trophy awarded annually by the Association of (British) Golf Writers to those deemed to have made the best contribution to golf during that year.\n\nHe was awarded a CBE by H.M. Queen Elizabeth II in the 1969 New Year Honours for his services to golf.\n\nDemonstrating that his influence extended across the Atlantic too Micklem also received the Bob Jones Award from the USGA in 1969, the Walter Hagen Award from the Golf Writers Association of America in 1970 and the Donald Ross Award from the American Society of Golf Course Architects in 1980.\n\nThe Gerald Micklem Cup is a men’s over 35 54-hole scratch open played over the New Course at Sunningdale G.C. It was established in 1988 to celebrate Micklem’s legacy.\n\nIn 1990 the England Golf Union established the Gerald Micklem Award. This is issued annually to the person who has made an outstanding contribution to further the interest of amateur golf in England.\n\nGerald Micklem – A Life in Golf (Photo: The R&A)\n\nA biography ‘Gerald Micklem – A Life In Golf’, written by John Littlewood, and published by Grant Books, with the financial support of The R&A, was released in 2014. Much of the information in this article came from this excellent book.\n\nIn February 2024 Micklem was included amongst a group of 12 golfers inducted into the new England Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nMicklem was posh and oozed wealth – he was chauffeur driven in a Bentley to most of his engagements – which inevitably led some to incorrectly conclude that he always favoured the Oxbridge set over the rank and file. He was an introvert with few friends and a serious personality that occassionally bordered on rude. However, he had many acquintances and could clearly work with others towards a common goal. It appears that over time he successfully earned respect and some fondness through his gravitas (physical size and deep, staccato voice), knowledge, dedication and generosity, albeit much of the latter was undertaken quietly and anonymously.\n\nGerald Micklem was a good player but an even better administrator. He is probably the greatest voluntary contributor in the history of British golf and arguably all of our sports. He may have been a benevolent dictator at times but sometimes that is exactly what is required to move important matters forward.\n\nME.\n\nCopyright © 2014-2024, Mark Eley. All rights reserved.\n\n4th June 2020\n\nRobert “Bobby” John Vincent Sweeny Jr was born on 25th July 1911 in Pasadena, California.\n\nHe was the youngest son of Robert Sweeny Sr (b. 9th July 1884) and his wife Teresa Hanaway (b. 12th June 1886), both strict Roman Catholics of Irish descent. Robert Sr was educated at University of Notre Dame and then Harvard Law School. He met Teresa, a talented singer and musician, whilst he was in Boston. She was studying at the city’s Conservatory of Music not too far away from Harvard. They married in May 1906.\n\nRobert Sr was the son of Charles Sweeny Sr and it was Bobby’s grand-father to whom the family owed their thanks for the wealth which set them all up for life. Charles made a fortune in mining and real estate in the late 19th century which Robert Sr built on through hard work and astute financial investments.\n\nBobby’s elder brother Charles “Charlie” was born on 3rd October 1909 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, his mother’s home town.\n\nShortly afterwards the Sweeny family moved to San Francisco where Robert Sr set up a new law firm which he then expanded in to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1916, with Bobby now 5, an increasingly ambitious Robert Sr moved the family to New York.\n\nCharlie and Bobby attended Loyola School, an independent Jesuit school which opened on Park Avenue in 1900, and then Canterbury School, a catholic boarding school which had opened in 1915 in New Milford, Connecticut. Both boys were natural sportsman playing for Canterbury’s football, basketball, baseball and hockey teams. However, it was golf that quickly garnered most of their attention. In 1923 Charlie was captain of the school golf team and Bobby won the Most Promising Player prize.\n\nBen Hogan and Bobby Sweeny at Seminole G.C.\n\nIt was a stroke of good fortune that accelerated the Sweeny’s golfing development. In 1925 the family were invited to holiday at the Le Touquet home of Kingsley ‘King’ Macomber in northern France. Macomber, a U.S. business associate of Robert Sr’s and a renowned racehorse owner, spent much of the holiday talking about horses and trying to persuade the Sweeny’s to buy a villa at the fashionable French resort. Macomber was confident he was going to win the Autumn Double, the Cambridgeshire and the Cesarevitch, at Newmarket with his two horses ‘Masked Marvel’ and ‘Forseti’. Macomber, having been unsuccessful in both persuading Robert Sr to have a bet or buy a villa, left France saying he would put a little on for him anyway. The horses duly came in for Macomber a few weeks later and he and his associates won over £1 million. In October Robert Sr received a cheque for £28,000, his share of the winnings. Robert Sr wanted to return the cheque but his wife Teresa suggested a compromise – why not use the money to acquire a villa in Le Touquet. As a result Charlie and Bobby spent the following summer of 1926 receiving lessons from pro Ted Green and playing golf on Le Touquet’s La Forêt and Le Manoir courses. The Sweeny boys would holiday at Le Touquet for years to come, occasionally playing golf with Edward, Prince of Wales who was also a frequent visitor.\n\nIn 1926 Robert Sr saw the opportunity to establish The Federated Trust and Finance Corporation in London to assist with new share issues on the Stock Exchange. Whilst Robert moved between the two cities Teresa remained based in New York; Charlie and Bobby continuing their educations at Canterbury and visiting their father in the summer holidays.\n\nCharlie played in the 1926 British Boys’ Amateur Championship, which had commenced in 1921, at Coombe Hill. He lost by 2&1 in the quarter finals to the eventual winner Scotland’s Eric McRuvie. In 1927 both Charlie and Bobby competed at Barnton, Royal Burgess in the same Championship. Bobby lost in the 4th round to a GNS Tweedale from Edinburgh whilst Charlie again lost to the champion, Eric Fiddian 5&4, this time in the semi-finals. With their entries stating either Canterbury, USA or Connecticut, USA they both must have been amongst the very first overseas entries. It doesn’t appear as if Bobby entered alone in 1928 at Formby or 1929 again at Barnton, Royal Burgess when he still would have been eligible.\n\nBobby and Charlie Sweeny At the 1927 Boys’ Amateur Championship\n\nTwo of their New York friends, Stuart ‘Boy’ and Herbert ‘Buzzie’ Scheftel, found themselves in a similar family situation to the Sweeny’s in the late 1920’s and the four of them spent much of their summers playing golf together in Le Touquet. A 17 year old Stuart became the first overseas winner of the British Boys’ Amateur Championship in 1928 and remains the only American winner of this title to date. In 1930 Charlie graduated from Canterbury School and passed the entrance examination for Yale. However, the Sheftels persuaded both of the Sweeny boys to change their plans and follow them to Oxford University. After one or two issues Charlie finally received the offer of a place at Wadham College. Charlie soon made the Oxford golf team and ahead of the 1933 Varsity Match against Cambridge he stayed with his friend the Prince of Wales at Fort Belvedere and the two played and practiced at nearby Sunningdale G.C. in preparation.\n\nBobby Sweeny doesn’t appear to have been as academically accomplished as Charlie and when his time arrived it took him over two years to pass the Oxford entrance examination. It was only after his father threatened him with having to get a job that Bobby got through it and was able to join his brother at Wadham.\n\nHelped by a monthly allowance from their father Charlie and Bobby both appear to have enjoyed a relaxed life at Oxford playing golf at the University’s Southfields course and else where, socialising in London at the leading clubs, Bucks and Whites, and regularly holidaying at the most glamorous resorts across Europe. In addition to the Oxford University Golf Club and Oxford & Cambridge Golfing Society the Sweeny’s became members of The Addington, Berkshire, Prince’s, Stoke Poges and Sunningdale Golf Club’s. In passing Bobby also became a member of The R&A in the mid-1930’s.\n\nCharlie (1930-1-2), who captained the Oxford team in his final year, and Bobby (1932 only) both earned golfing blues. They played in the same Oxford team that beat Cambridge 9-6 in the 1932 Varsity Match, pairing up in the foursomes (winning 5&3) before both won their singles, Charlie 4&3 and Bobby 5&4. Attending and representing Oxford at golf in the 1930’s brought them into contact with many of the leading golfers of the time as well as extending their business and aristocratic networks.\n\nCharlie was clearly the better golfer as a young man but it wouldn’t be long before Bobby would be asserting his dominance over his older brother. Writing in later years Bernard Darwin said Bobby “had always had a sound and elegant style and he had been a good but by no means an outstanding player for Oxford” which seems to sum up his standing at the time. Laddie Lucas was more effusive in his praise “Of the many golfing scholars I met in those week-end matches for Cambridge, Bob seemed to me to possess a golfing armoury of greater variety and quality than the majority of his contemporaries. Those with the eyes to see could tell then that here was a player who, before long, must surely prevail.”\n\nShortly after graduating Charlie fell in love with Margaret Whigham, considered the most attractive woman in the country at the time. To demonstrate an income ahead of a proposed marriage in February 1933, his father arranged for him to take a job at Charterhouse Investment Trust, a small merchant bank. Charlie’s new role in the City and the wedding preparations inevitably led to him practicing less and a gradual withdrawal from competitive golf. Charlie would join his father’s Federated Trust company in the mid-1930’s.\n\nWhen Bobby graduated from Oxford he joined the investment banking firm of Philip Hill and Partners in London, no doubt with a helping hand from his father. As he always enjoyed socialising and playing golf more than he ever did working one assumes this was a flexible arrangement. Now a slim 6ft 3” man, with a fast improving game, he was determined to start making a name for himself in the golfing world.\n\nBobby was a semi-finalist in the French Open Amateur Championship in 1933 at Fourqueux and was runner-up in the New York State Men’s Amateur championship later in the summer at Garden City C.C. Two results which highlight his transatlantic schedule right from his early 20’s.\n\nIn 1934 he secured his first national win in Britain taking the H.R.H. Prince of Wales’ Cup played over 72 holes at Prince’s, the club he seemed to be most affiliated with at this time. He also made the semi-finals again in the French Amateur, this time at the Chiberta G.C.\n\nBobby made his debut in the Amateur Championship in 1929 a month before his 18th birthday. However, it was not until 1935, playing in his fourth Amateur at Royal Lytham & St. Anne’s, that he was to reach the latter stages. He came through six rounds before losing in the semi-finals 3&2, having been 2Up after 12 holes, to the eventual champion W. Lawson Little.\n\nLater in the summer of 1935 Bobby won the Gleneagles Silver Tassie, a leading amateur event at this time, having also come joint runner-up in the Golf Illustrated Gold Vase at the Berkshire G.C.\n\nBobby was invited to play in the third U.S. Masters at Augusta in 1936. After rounds of 83-72-74-87 (+31) he finished tied 44th. He would go on to play in a total of ten Masters with his final one being in 1961. His best finish was tied 34th in 1954. His full Masters Tournament playing record is shown in an Appendix below.\n\nBobby Sweeny was a friend of Bobby Jones (Photo: Charles Sweeny)\n\n1936 saw him make another good run at the Amateur losing in Round 5 to Australia’s Jim Ferrier on the 21st hole. Ferrier was runner-up that year falling to Hector Thomson at St. Andrews by 2 holes in the Final. Ferrier turned professional in 1941 and won the 1947 PGA Championship, the first golfer from the Southern Hemisphere to win a major title.\n\nThe 1937 Amateur Championship was played at Royal St. George’s in Kent. Sweeny, about to turn 26, reached the final where he came up against Lionel Munn. Munn, a former Irish Open Amateur (1909-10-11) and Irish Close (1908-11-13-14) champion, had just turned 50 years old and whilst he hadn’t played much in the 1920s a move to Kent and membership at Sandwich had re-ignited his interest in the game. Despite both finalists having associations with local clubs the final was watched by a modest crowd totalling no more than 500. Peter Lawless writing in the Morning Post on 31st May 1937 reported that Sweeny had a “beautifully smooth swing, with the hands carried through unusually high.”\n\nBobby got off to a good start in the final moving 3Up after four holes. He took the first with a par but then holed long putts on the 3rd and 4th. The lead was reduced to 1Up after 9 holes as Munn settled down and it remained this way after all of the morning 18 holes had been played. At the 22nd hole Munn drew back level and on the next went 1Up. The 24th hole, the par 3 ‘Maiden’, would settle the match. Munn, in the ascendancy and with the tee, got caught between a 5 and a 6-iron and pushed his opening shot into a pot bunker on the right hand side. Sweeny also missed the green but chipped stone dead to secure a par his opponent was ultimately unable to match. When Bobby won the next hole too he was back on track and would eventually see out the match 3&2. It appears his greater length off the tee and extra fitness, in the sunny conditions, ultimately paid off against the older man. Bernard Darwin said Sweeny “played beautifully at Sandwich and was not only the winner but the dominating figure of the tournament.”\n\nBobby Sweeny Jr Receives the Amateur Championship Trophy\n\nFinal Scores – Morning Round\n\nSweeny 4 4 2 4 5 3 5 3 4 = 34 4 4 4 5 4 5 4 4 5 = 39 [73]\n\nMunn 5 4 3 5 4 3 5 3 3 = 35 4 4 4 5 5 5 3 5 4 = 39 [74]\n\nFinal Scores – Afternoon Round\n\nSweeny 5 4 4 6 5 3 4 3 4 = 38 4 5 4 5 4 6 2 = 30 (after 16 holes)\n\nMunn 5 4 4 5 4 4 5 4 3 = 38 6 4 5 5 5 5 3 = 39 (after 16 holes)\n\nNow full of confidence Bobby won the 1937 Golf Illustrated Gold Vase at West Herts G.C. by 7-shots with an impressive 137 36-hole total. He also won the Gleneagles Silver Tassie again in 1937 when he shot a course record 66 on the Queen’s Course and followed it with a 74 on the Kings Course to post a record 140 total.\n\nAround this time it was reported that Sweeny had been dominating the White’s Club tournament in recent years, played annually over 36 holes at Royal St. George’s. Members enjoyed to gamble and it was said that Sweeny always left the event with thousands of pounds from winnings and side bets.\n\nIn December 1937 Sweeny announced his intention to file naturalisation papers and become a British subject. His sponsors were Lord Dudley and his employer Philip Ernest Hill. However, matters of the heart ultimately put an end to his plans.\n\nBobby Sweeny had been fending off women since University his looks, wealth and sporting prowess acting like a magnet to the fairer sex. Throughout both of their lives Bobby and his brother Charlie would repeatedly find themselves drawn to the fragile and spoilt debutantes they were exposed to on the circuit of high society balls and parties they attended. Sadly it was a weakness they would both repeatedly live to regret.\n\nIn 1938 Bobby finally met a lady in London who he was interested in. Barbara Hutton was the Woolworth ‘five and dime store’ heiress and one of the wealthiest women in the world at the time. Both had lived in San Francisco, New York and now London and these shared experiences helped nurture an initial attraction. Matters were complicated as Barbara, 25, was in the process of separating from her second husband Count Kurt Haugwitz-Reventlow of Denmark, who she had given up her Amercian citizenship to be with and with whom she had had a son, Lance (now 3). Nevertheless the couple embarked on a romance touring France, Italy, Greece and Egypt during the autumn and winter of 1938/39. The couple became engaged but Reventlow wanted a settlement of $2.5m for a quick divorce. Barbara was happy to pay the sum but Bobby considered this black mail and suggested they wait him out knowing that having signed a separation agreement in July 1938 the Count would have to accept a lower settlement after 18 months when the divorce would be finalised under Danish law. In October 1939 with World War II developing at pace Bobby escorted Barbara and Lance back to New York and on to Palm Beach in Florida for the winter where Bobby relaxed by played golf at the Everglades Club. In February 1940 the couple returned to New York but by this time Barbara had started a relationship with the actor Cary Grant, whom she had first met in 1939, and Bobby was soon dispensed with. It is said he was given $350,000 by Barbara by way of a separation gift.\n\nBarbara Hutton and Bobby Sweeny in Palm Beach\n\nBobby recorded his best finish in the Open Championship in 1939 at St. Andrews. Rounds of 74-75-80-79 giving him a 308 total and 33rd place result. He had made his debut in the Championship in 1932 at Prince’s and played in a total of ten Open’s before his last one 28 years later at St. Andrews in 1970. Whilst he was very much an also ran throughout one can not help but admire his competitive drive, fitness and longevity. His full Open Championship playing record is shown in an Appendix below.\n\nWith World War II now underway Bobby quickly returned to Britain, keen to support the war effort in his adopted country. His brother Charlie had got a head start on him and had begun recruiting experienced American pilots to support the RAF. His ‘Eagle Squadrons’ were established in September 1940 and first saw action in July 1941. The Sweeny family raised $100,000 to fund the establishment of the Squadrons, primarily for getting the pilots to Britain and then paying them. At it’s peak the Squadron had 244 American volunteers trained up as spitfire fighter pilots. In September 1942 it was disbanded when those pilots still alive (88 died) transferred to the U.S. 8th Air Force after their home country had joined the allied forces.\n\nBobby was a qualified pilot with over 50 hours flying experience and now unattached wanted to quickly get into the thick of the action. Unfortunately his application to the RAF in 1940 to become a fighter pilot was turned down on the grounds he was too old at 28/29. Wanting to be involved with the Eagle Squadron he was made an adjutant, a lower ranking officer who assists a higher ranking officer with administrative duties. His job was to keep the U.S. pilots in order. Once in position he started to use his charm and influence to talk his way into the skies.\n\nHe was successful and ended up being posted as a Flying Officer to 224 Squadron Coastal Command tasked with flying four-engined B-24 Liberator planes. Wishing to continue living in the style he had become accustomed to he turned his back on the pilots’ encampment in Torquay, staying at the Imperial Hotel and commuting in his Bentley. He would go on to fly over 800 operational hours during which he and his crew destroyed two german U-Boat submarines and damaged a further five. During one of the successful attacks in the Bay of Biscay on 31st May 1943 his plane was shelled on it’s right wing. He managed to return the plane over 1,000 miles back to his base at RAF St. Eval in Cornwall flying at a very low altitude, fending off German plane attacks off the northern French coast and regularly throwing the plane’s contents out of the windows to reduce it’s weight as much as possible. For gallantry displayed in flying operations against the enemy Bobby received the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) from King George VI in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 3rd September 1943. Whilst Bobby wanted to carry on flying Charlie was concerned that his luck would eventually run out so arranged for a friend, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who was heading up the Free Dutch Forces, to request him as his new RAF Liaison Officer. As a result Bobby would safely see out the war at the FDF’s headquarters in a chateau on the outskirts of Brussels.\n\nFlying Officer Bobby Sweeny DFC\n\nIn May 1940 Bobby’s parents left London and sailed back to New York for their own safety. In July 1941 his mother, Teresa, died from a heart attack whilst undergoing an operation for the removal of her gall bladder. After the War his father, Robert Sr, returned to England but sadly died of cancer in December 1945. A family plot at Brookwood Cemetery, near Woking in Surrey, was acquired. Robert Sr was buried here and shortly afterwards Teresa was re-buried alongside him.\n\nThe War cost Sweeny six of his prime golfing years but he wasted no time getting back to the top of the game when play properly resumed in 1946.\n\nThe Amateur Championship was staged at Royal Birkdale and Bobby reached the final where he came up against the pre-war star of GB&I amateur golf, Ireland’s 26 year old Jimmy Bruen. Bruen had won the 1936 Boys’ Championship at Birkdale and was an obvious favourite for the 1946 Amateur. Bruen came out on top, winning by 4&3. Henry Longhurst reporting on the final said Bruen was lucky to go in 2Up after the morning round after winning the 16th and 17th holes but not hitting a fairway until the 11th and generally finding favourable lies early on. On the 8th hole the powerful Irishman broke his steel shafted mashie niblick hacking out of the rough only to turn around and see a watching Henry Cotton using an identical club as a walking stick. The stick was quickly added to Bruen’s bag and he proceeded to use it to good effect throughout the rest of the match. The afternoon round was played in rain with Sweeny unable to make any in roads on the Irishman.\n\nJimmy Bruen and Bobby Sweeny Ahead of the 1946 Amateur Final\n\nBobby continued to play in the Championship but only featured in the latter stages on one further occasion. Aged 52 he came through five rounds at Ganton in 1964 before losing to Martin Christmas 6&5 in the quarter finals.\n\nSweeny played in his final Amateur Championship in 1974, just shy of his 63 birthday and what I believe to be a record 45 years after his first entry. In total he played in 25 Championships and 72 matches, winning 48 (67%) and losing 24. His full Amateur Championship playing record is shown in an Appendix below.\n\nSweeny was the co-winner of the inaugural Berkshire Trophy in 1946 alongside GB&I Walker Cup player, John Beck. Laddie Lucas, who won it the following year, noted in his autobiography that it was Bobby who had donated the famous gold cup to the club.\n\nA place in the U.S.A. Walker Cup team alluded Bobby throughout his long career. This was a shame as he clearly had experience and the game for links golf so would have certainly benefited most of America’s visiting teams to these shores. He was not helped by being based in England for most of the pre-War period and by his high profile love life which was often written about in the papers. The Americans viewed him as British whilst his friends in England saw him as an American so he almost didn’t belong to either side. The closest he got to honours was the 1947 match at St. Andrews where the USGA selected him as an alternate.\n\nAfter the War and their father’s death Charlie and Bobby found themselves picking up the pieces at Federated Trust which they now owned 50%:50%. Whilst neither of them had a great deal of City experience they did have a lot of capital which was obviously a useful commodity at the time and gave them time to learn from their mistakes. Bobby, with little motivation and a lack of real interest in business, ultimately decided to return to America in the late 1940’s where he had many friends, particularly in the golfing world.\n\nHe first settled in New York where he carried on playing championship golf. He lost the final of the 1948 Metropolitan Golf Association Amateur at Winged Foot 8&6 to Ray Billows. He would also lose in the final of this competition again in 1957, this time 3&2 to Paul Kelly at Nassau G.C.\n\nIn 1948 Bobby met 18 year old Joanne Marie Connelley, who had been voted New York’s most beautiful debutante that season. Despite being over twice her age Sweeny married Joanne in 1949, her aspiring mother Margaret encouraging the arrangement. Soon after the couple moved to Palm Beach in Florida, an area Bobby knew well from spending time there with Barbara Hutton, where they had two daughters, Sharon (b. 1950) and Brenda (b. 1952). However, after a while the couple started to drift apart, Bobby playing more golf and Joanne, who was feeling as if she was missing out on life as a young mother, losing weight and partying. Matters came to ahead in 1953 after Joanne was allegedly caught in a compromising situation in a London hotel with international playboy Porfiro Rubirosa. Sweeny immediately sued for divorce in London and was able to divest himself of Joanne and gain custody of both his daughters whilst Rubirosa was left to pick up the costs of the legal proceedings.\n\nIn an aside, again encouraged by her mother, Connelley went on to marry Jaime Ortiz-Patiño in Paris in April 1954. Ortiz-Patiño, the French born son of a Bolivian aristocrat and tin magnate heiress, would go on to acquire Real Club Valderrama in Spain in 1984. This marriage was on the rocks within 2 months with Connelley attempting suicide and Ortiz-Patiño commencing divorce proceedings on the grounds of desertion by July. The matter took 3 years to resolve and with Connelley holed up in Swiss chalet throughout her unhappiness continued. She eventually died of a heart attack, allegedly brought on by a drug overdose, aged 27 in July 1957. Brenda inherited her mother’s drug addictions and eventually died in 2000 aged 49.\n\nJoanne Marie Connelley – Life Magazine 10th January, 1949\n\nBobby continued to live in Palm Beach and started to play more golf at the exclusive Seminole Golf Club, where he had become a member. Perhaps helped by his links golf experience he became a master of the course which could be transformed by the wind from round to round. Bobby became a good friend of Claude Harmon, club pro between 1945-57, and Ben Hogan who regularly played at the club, particularly in preparation for the Masters in the 1950’s. Bobby was used to mingling with the great and the good and Hogan appreciated the fact he could play with him and be treated just like one of the boys. They would regularly have $50 and $100 Nassau side bets during their games and it was general knowledge at the club that Bobby would more often than not win these and ocassionally agreed to give Hogan shots to help him. Bobby won a number of club competitions, including one alongside fellow member, H.R.H. Duke of Windsor, and kept the card when Hogan shot the lowest round of his life, a 61, in one of their four-balls.\n\nBobby Sweeny Seminole Trophy (Photo: GoldenAgeGolfAuctions.com)\n\nIn early 1954 Bobby started a relationship with another troubled society beauty and sometime actress, 24 year old Pamela Dudley Curran. Curran was at this point estranged from her husband Joseph A. Wade Jr who she had married in January 1951. In July 1954 it was widely reported that Wade and his private investigator had caught Bobby and Pamela in bed together at the Hotel Westburn in New York and that he would be seeking a divorce on the grounds of her adultery.\n\nPamela Dudley Curran – Life Magazine 24th November, 1947\n\nA few weeks later Sweeny put the incident behind him and travelled to the Country Club of Detroit for the 1954 U.S. Amateur. Showing good mental strength Bobby, now aged 43, reached the final. The “graying millionaire playboy who is a celebrity on two continents”, as he was described by Herbert Warren Wind in Sports Illustrated, found himself up against a relatively unknown 24 year old paint salesman from Cleveland. His name was Arnold Palmer. Palmer started as slight underdog in the final having struggled in his semi-final against Edward Meister Jr. After Meister had missed a number of putts down the stretch Palmer made a stupendous up-and-down on the 36th hole before coming through on the 39th.\n\nRecalling Sweeny and the final years later Palmer said “he looked like a movie star, he was as thin as a reed. Interestingly he recalled Sweeny having a female companion in the gallery (presumably Pamela but possibly not) “let’s put it this way, she was more than amply endowed”. Sweeny started the 36 hole final well, making putts of 35ft and 18ft at the 2nd and 3rd holes to go 2Up. On the 4th hole his ‘friend’ came through the ropes and gave Sweeny a big hug and kiss. He immediately holed a 20ft putt at the 4th to go 3Up. “I was already 3Down,” Palmer said. “It’s not enough that he’s rich, handsome, a bomber pilot, and gets the girl, he also makes every damn putt he looks at.” Palmer recalled that as they walked off the 4th green Sweeny whispered to him “‘Don’t worry Arnie, you know I can’t keep this up forever’. Bob was a real sportsman, a real gentleman. I appreciated that. Even during the nip and tuck of our match, I knew I would always have a good feeling about him.” Sweeny immediately three putted the 5th but was still able to take a 2Up lead into lunch.\n\nArnold Palmer and Bobby Sweeny Ahead of the 1954 U.S. Amateur Final\n\nPalmer eventually regained parity on the 27th hole, although Sweeny dropped another long putt on the 28th to regain the lead. Palmer caught him again at the 30th, holing a 6ft putt, and finally took the lead on the 32nd, when Sweeny bogeyed having missed the green with his approach. Palmer sank a 10 ft birdie putt on the 33rd hole to go 2Up with 3 holes to play. Sweeny, showing his fighting qualities got up and down out of a green side bunker on 35th with an 8ft putt to take the match to the 36th. 1Down playing the final hole Sweeny drove in the rough and shanked his 2nd out. He was still 7 ft away after his third. Palmer, safely on the green in two, putted up close from 45ft. and Sweeny made a quick concession. Whilst Palmer had clearly won the final 2Up referee Joe Day was so impressed with Sweeny’s play and sportsmanship he advised Palmer that he was calling the last a half and that the result would be recorded as a 1Up victory for him. The result would of course change Palmer’s live and arguably the future of both amateur and professional golf.\n\nUSGA Highlights of the 1954 U.S. Amateur (0.00 – 1.41 mins.)\n\nBobby played in ten U.S. Amateur Championships in total. His only other performances of note came in 1946 and 1949 when he lost in Round 4. His full U.S. Amateur Championship playing record is shown in an Appendix below.\n\nBobby made his one and only U.S. Open Championship in 1955, aged 43, at The Olympic Club in San Francisco, benefiting from his 1954 U.S. Amateur runner-up exemption. He missed the cut after recording rounds of 80 and 77 for a 157 (+17) total. The Championship proved to be a memorable one as the unknown Jack Fleck beat Bobby’s friend Ben Hogan in a play-off.\n\nBobby continued his on-off relationship with the now divorced Pamela for a number of years before marrying her in August 1957 at the Round Hill Community Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. They divorced in May 1961.\n\nWith good health and finances, Bobby continued competing in all of the main American and British Championships for a number of years but inevitably as he moved towards and beyond his 50th birthday successes were few and far between.\n\nBobby returned to England on a permanent basis in the late 1960s as he wanted his two daughters to finish their educations in England. He was first diagnosed with cancer in 1979 and eventually died from it at his home in London on 21st October 1983 aged 72. He is buried, alongside his father, mother and brother in the Brookwood Cemetry. His older brother Charlie died ten years later in 1993.\n\nBobby Sweeny’s Grave in Woking (Photo: Ian Wood)\n\nBobby Sweeny has been described as golf’s last ‘Great Gatsby’ and it’s easy to see why. He was a celebrity in both British and American society and a popular character in the golfing world. He was a natural who seemingly didn’t practice very often and frequently turned up for Championships the day before he would be teeing it up. Whilst he lived in an era and manner which is unrecognisable to most people nowadays his longevity at the top of the amateur game, if not his titles, make him worthy of further recognition.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAppendix\n\n1.

Given his longevity and the era in which he played, with its greater depth, he is arguably Great Britain & Ireland’s (GB&I) greatest ever amateur golfer.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nGary Peter Wolstenholme MBE was born in Egham, Surrey on 21st August 1960.\n\nHis father was Guy Wolstenholme a renowned amateur and professional golfer in the 1950s and ’60s. Peter Alliss is one of Gary’s god-parents due to his long friendship with his father. Sadly Guy died from cancer in October 1984 well before his son’s golfing peak.\n\nGary’s parents divorced when he was four years old and it was his mother Joan, and her parents, that brought Gary up in Grange-over-Sands in Cumbria. When he was 10 the family moved to Keighley in Yorkshire and Gary was sent off to boarding school at Giggleswick. He completed his schooling there save for an 18 month period when he moved to Melbourne, Australia as his parents tried in vain to make their relationship work again.\n\nHe first played golf when he was 4 years old but didn’t start taking it seriously until he was 17. His father actively discouraged him knowing only too well how making a career in golf was fraught with difficulties. Gary was a 23 handicap when he was 18 and whilst he dropped his handicap rapidly thereafter still only earned his first England cap when he was 27.\n\nAlways a short hitter off the tee he practiced for many hours to ensure he got the maximum out of his game. His consistency, short game and confidence in his own ability enabled him to overcome many a supposedly stronger player in his lengthy career.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nWolstenholme won The Amateur Championship twice. In 1991 he beat Bob May (USA) 8&6 at Ganton GC and in 2003 he beat Raphael De Sousa (SUI) 6&5 at Royal Troon GC.\n\nHis 2003 win came when he was 42, making him one of the oldest champions in the history of this prestigious competition.\n\nGary Wolstenholme With The Amateur Championship In 2015 (Photo: Age Partnership)\n\nIn his long career Gary won numerous other national and international titles (see Appendix 1), including the Golf Illustrated Gold Vase, the Duncan Putter (3), the Berkshire Trophy (3), the Welsh Stroke Play, the Scottish Stroke Play, the Sherry Cup (4), the Lagonda Trophy and the Lee Westwood Trophy.\n\nHowever, like his career amateur predecessor Peter McEvoy, the English Amateur Championship always alluded him. Whilst his father was a two-time winner the closest Gary came to lifting the trophy was a 4&2 loss to Paul Casey in the 2000 final at Royal Lytham & St. Annes. It was his only defeat in a major final.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nGary played in five Majors – the 1992 and 2004 Masters, the 1992 (Muirfield) and 2003 (Royal St. George’s) Open’s and the 2008 U.S. Open (Torrey Pines) – but missed the cut in all of them.\n\nHe played with a 62 year old Arnold Palmer in round 1 of the 1992 Masters and recorded an even par 72 at Augusta. In 2004 he was paired with Tom Watson shooting 77 and 76.\n\nHe made more of an impression with some of the other professional tournament invites he received. He was the leading amateur at the 1993 Benson and Hedges International and 2004 British Masters and also made the cut at the 1992 Australian Masters.\n\nHe was also invited to play in the 1992 Memorial Tournament by Jack Nicklaus.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nThroughout his long career Wolstenholme derived the most satisfaction from his team selection for England, GB&I and Europe.\n\nHe is the most capped player in world amateur golf, playing 218 times for England. Between April 1988 and 2008 he won 130 games, halved 25 and lost 63, earning 142.5 points for his country.\n\nEngland won the Home Internationals 13 times and the European Men’s Team Championships at Hillside in 2005 with Gary in the team. Gary played seven times for England in the latter competition between 1997 and 2007.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nWolstenholme has consistently stated over the years that winning the Eisenhower Trophy for GB&I in Chile in 1998 was the highlight of his golfing career.\n\nAll four of Gary’s scores counted in the 72 hole event, including a final round 67 which helped take the four man GB&I team 4 shots clear of Australia and USA.\n\nHaving the golf medal placed around his neck while the national anthem was playing was his crowning glory.\n\nIn addition to 1998 he also played in the World Amateur Team Championship for GB&I in 1996 (Philippines) and, after each home nation started to enter separately, England in 2002 (Malaysia) and 2004 (Puerto Rico).\n\n_________________________________________\n\nGary played on six Walker Cup teams, at Royal Porthcawl (1995), Quaker Ridge (1997), Nairn (1999), Ocean Forest (2001), Ganton (2003) and finally Chicago (2005).\n\nHe is the all-time leading points scorer for GB&I. He played 19 games in total, 11 Singles and 8 Foursomes, winning 5 of each (see Appendix 2). His wins against Tiger Woods in 1995 and Anthony Kim 10 years later being the obvious highlights. Unsurprisingly one rarely hears the second part of the Woods story which is that the two of them played again in the Day 2 Singles and that Tiger won relatively easily.\n\nTiger Woods and Gary Wolstenholme At Porthcawl in 1995 (Photo: Sunday Times)\n\nHe was on the winning side four times; an impressive stat when one remembers GB&I have only won nine times in the 46 matches played since the contest started in 1922.\n\nHis leading points winner and most match win records are almost certainly never going to be broken due to the much changed nature of the amateur game.\n\nGiven his commitment to amateur golf and his status in the history of the Walker Cup it is disappointing that The R&A have not found themselves able to afford him the captaincy of the GB&I team to date (even accepting that he eventually turned professional).\n\n_________________________________________\n\nIn 1998 the Bonallack Trophy match between Europe and Asia-Pacific started. Wolstenholme was selected for Europe on four occasions in 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2006. Europe won three of these matches and Gary holds the record for both the most games played and most points scored.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nGary’s late blossoming meant he never really considered turning pro during his amateur career. He was simply never good enough while young enough and likewise when he became good enough he considered himself too old to embark on such a pursuit. He was also realistic enough to appreciate he didn’t have the finances to do so either. His somewhat nomadic life, he moved from Leicestershire to Bristol and then back again, meant he never really enjoyed a home fanbase which could have helped him attract local start-up sponsorship.\n\nIn September 2008, having just turned 48, Wolstenholme finally turned professional.\n\nWhilst no one could begrudge Gary the opportunity to belatedly try and cash in on his years of hard work on the golf course he left the amateur ranks a little disillusioned. Both The R&A and England Golf had indicated to him that they wanted to focus on younger players going forward. If this was not bad enough neither party also seemed keen for him to play a role in helping to develop this next generation, something he had hoped for and perhaps expected.\n\nPresented with little alternative, if he wished to continue playing golf competitively, he took the plunge; his theory being to acclimatise on development tours ahead of playing the Senior Tour after he turned 50 in 2010.\n\nShortly before this he had sold his house in Leicestershire and moved back in with his mother in Cumbria. He started an attachment with Carus Green Golf Club in Kendall as a result which continues to this day.\n\nHis first professional win came in July 2010 in the Stoke-By-Nayland event on the PGA EuroPro Tour where he shot a 63 in round 2 on his way to a -15 4-shot victory. At 49 years and 313 days old I assume he must be the oldest ever winner of a PGA EuroPro Tour event.\n\nGary made an impressive start to life on the European Senior Tour (now the Staysure Tour) in the Autumn of 2010. He finished third in his first event, the Travis Perkins Masters at Woburn, before winning the €90,000 first prize next time out at the 2010 Casa Serena Open (-13 by 3 shots) in the Czech Republic.\n\nWolstenholme went on to win a further two events; the 2012 Mallorca Open Senior (-8 by 2 shots) and the 2012 Benahavis Senior Masters (-13 by 1 shot).\n\nHe is currently playing his tenth season on the Staysure Tour. As at November 2019 he has played in 134 events and has to date amassed career prize winnings of €926,069.65. His decision to turn pro therefore appears to have been a good one.\n\nHe also won the 2011 ISPS Handa Australian Senior Open.\n\nGary Wolstenholme Receives His MBE In May 2007 (Photo: Daily Mail)\n\nWolstenholme was awarded an MBE (for services to golf) in the 2007 New Year’s Honours list. “It’s a great honour and I’m very proud,” he said at the time. “This means everything to me. It salutes the sacrifices I’ve made to the game over the past 20 years but this is not just for me. It is also for those people who have helped me achieve what I have. Those at my club Kilworth Springs (where he was the Director of Golf for eight years), those who have coached me over the years, the people who helped me when I was in Bristol, and especially my mother without whom I wouldn’t have achieved anything.”\n\n‘The Long and the Short of It: The Autobiography of Britain’s Greatest Amateur Golfer’ by Gary Wolstenholme (and Sunday Times journalist Derek Clements) was published by John Blake Publishing on 4th October 2010. It is dedicated to his mother Joan and presents an honest story of his career in the game.\n\nGary’s Autobiography ‘The Long And Short Of It’ (Photo: GolfBible)\n\nOver the years he has also been given honorary memberships at Berkhamsted GC, The Berkshire GC, Bristol & Clifton GC, County Sligo GC, GC of Georgia (USA), Grange-over-sands GC, Heysham GC, The Leicestershire GC, Morecambe GC, Scarborough North Cliff GC and Trevose G&CC.\n\nIn 2005 Wolstenholme was invited to join The R&A only for the invitation to be subsequently withdrawn by Chief Executive Peter Dawson after a couple of members, one presumably very senior, surprisingly ‘blackballed’ him for being “not suitable”.\n\nIn February 2024 Wolstenholme was rightly included amongst a group of 12 golfers inducted into the new England Golf Hall of Fame.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nGary Wolstenholme was sometimes viewed by his peers as a loner, an outsider; superstitious and a little eccentric on the one hand but occasionally arrogant and aloof too.\n\nHaving played most of his golf with players much younger than himself it was perhaps inevitable that some found it hard to build a rapport with him. The truth is Gary probably didn’t want them to. Like a great many champions he did what he believed to be necessary to fulfil his potential and get the job done.\n\nFor me his playing record and achievements certainly outweigh any character flaws that he may have had. He often talked about setting his name in stone within the history of the game. As the only amateur to win on all five continents he has undoubtedly done that.\n\nGB&I amateur golf supporters owe him a debt of gratitude for the service he gave to his country over 20 years. Many of his playing records will never be broken and he will rightly take his place in history as our last great career amateur.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nAppendix 1 – Other Amateur Victories\n\n1986 & 2002 – Midland Open Stroke Play\n\n1987 – West of England Open Stroke Play\n\n1989 – Golf Illustrated Gold Vase\n\n1993 – Chinese Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship\n\n1994, 1996 & 1999 – Duncan Putter\n\n1994, 1996, 1998 & 2001 – English County Champion of Champions\n\n1995 – United Arab Emirates Amateur,\n\n1995, 1996 & 1998 – British Mid-Amateur Championship\n\n1996 – Finnish Amateur Stroke Play Championship,\n\n1996, 1997 & 2002 – Berkshire Trophy,\n\n1997 – Welsh Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship\n\n1998 & 2006 – St Mellion International Amateur Stroke Play\n\n2000 & 2001 – Sherry Cup Invitational Stroke Play\n\n2002 – Lagonda Trophy\n\n2002 – South African Amateur Stroke Play Championship\n\n2003 – Scottish Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship\n\n2004 – Georgia Cup Match (v.

A relative unknown nowadays he holds a record which is unlikely to ever be broken.\n\nHe was the underdog who came good but never got the recognition or financial rewards he deserved.\n\nJohnny Goodman (Photo: omaha.com)\n\nJohn George Goodman was born on 28th December 1909 in South Omaha, Nebraska, the fifth child of Lithuanian immigrants, William and Rose Goodman. His father worked in the local slaughterhouses and faced with horrific working conditions and poverty drifted into alcoholism. Shortly after his wife died in late 1924 giving birth to their 13th child (who also died) William chose to desert his family and the home he owned.\n\nAbandoned at 15 and ultimately left to fend for himself it’s fair to say Johnny’s prospects appeared poor. The game of golf and the generosity of friends proved to be his saviour.\n\nBy accident Johnny had become a caddie at the nearby Omaha Field Club a few years earlier when he was 11. Playing on the railway which criss-crossed the golf course he had found a stray golf ball. Whilst selling it to a passing player he had learnt that more money was available for carrying bags at the Club. Within days he was earning on the weekends and given his natural intelligence and hard work soon became the best caddie at the Club. In 1922, reflecting this status, he was handed the bag of Walter Hagen by the caddie-master when the reigning Open champion arrived in Omaha on an exhibition tour with Australian Joe Kirkwood.\n\nAfter briefly sleeping rough his friend Matt Zadalis persuaded his family to take him in and the skills he had developed as a caddie in dealing with adults quickly made him a respectful and welcome house guest. Whilst he continued to take his studies seriously his attendance at school became more sporadic. The need to earn, to feed and clothe himself, took priority and over the next few years he secured jobs as a Western Union messenger, a printing factory assistant and even occasionally as a cleaner in the slaughterhouses. To his credit he later did night classes to catch up and completed his high school diploma on time in June 1927.\n\nHe had continued to caddie in the spring and summer months and having cobbled together a set of clubs began discretely practising on the Omaha Field course. It wasn’t long before he became proficient and at 15, having won the 1925 Metropolitan Golf Tournament, could rightly call himself one of the best golfers in Omaha.\n\nLike most sports fans at the time Bobby Jones was his hero and understandably given the era Johnny was taken with the amateur ideal. Given his hand to mouth existence at home he had no aspirations to turn professional and to be treated as a second class citizen at the golf course like most professionals still were. He was happy to continue travelling to events in the cheaper boxcars used to transport livestock and mail on the trains if it meant he could continue to have the sanctuary of golf clubhouses.\n\nHe developed a sound posture and a repeatable swing where he hit the ball late, more on the upswing than driving the club into the ground at impact. What started off as a draw became a power fade as he practiced more and sought greater consistency. As a small and slender man of 5ft 8” he never hit the ball far but the closer he got to the hole the deadlier he became; there were few who could pitch and putt better.\n\nJohnny Goodman (Photo: Lester Jones Collection)\n\nThe next step up the golfing ladder should have been the Nebraska Amateur Championship but ambitiously in June 1926 Johnny went for the regional Trans-Mississippi Championship in St. Louis. Playing in his first major competition Goodman showed his potential, first breaking Hagen’s course record in qualifying before falling to the more experienced Johnny Dawson 2&1 in the semi-finals. Despite the loss his performance made headline news back in Omaha. As he said himself: “One day I woke up and I was famous”.\n\nWhilst his appearance, at least in his early playing years, often left a little to be desired he now realised he needed to look the part every day even if his finances made that hard to achieve. More importantly he now also understood that controlling his emotions on the course would help his scoring. Observers noticed how mentally strong he was and how he played with a competitive focus few others could match.\n\nGoodman won the Trans-Mississippi Championship the following year at Broadmoor C.C. in Colorado Springs beating James Ward 2&1 in the Final. He would go on to become a 3-time Trans-Mississippi champion; wins in 1931 and 1935 bookending a loss in the 1934 final.\n\nGoodman won the Nebraska Amateur Championship in 1929 and went on to retain it in 1930 and 1931. However, his sights were increasingly set at a national rather than state level. He didn’t have to wait long to make his mark.\n\nAt the 1929 U.S. Amateur at Pebble Beach Golf Links, in one of the great upsets in the history of the game, he beat medalist Bobby Jones 2&1 in Round 1 of the match play stage. Disappointingly but perhaps not surprisingly he lost in Round 2 by the same scoreline in the afternoon to a 19 year old Lawson Little, who was just setting out on his own path to greatness.\n\nThe event started ominously for Goodman. Upon arrival in California he had been summoned to a USGA meeting to explain a new Spalding sporting goods store assistant’s role he had recently started amid concerns about his amateur status. His $8 per week salary appeared to be nothing to him when compared with some of the employment and writing arrangements other leading amateurs, like Jones and Chick Evans, were benefiting from. At the time the USGA appeared happy to show a little more flexibility to the more affluent gentleman players who met their concept of the perfect amateur. Unfortunately “Boxcar Johnny” fell very much at the other end of the spectrum; just the kind of player who they could make an example of and who they felt should be earning a living as a pro. Thankfully he was able to dissuade the Committee of any major impropriety and take up his place in the field. Although relations weren’t subsequently helped when he removed the star player from the field and attendances (and takings) over the final days were decimated. The USGA introduced a seeded match play draw the following year which perhaps played a part in helping Jones complete his 1930 grand slam.\n\nJohnny’s trip to the Monterey Peninsula ended well. The victory over Bobby Jones caught the attention of a watching Bing Crosby who invited Johnny to play a $100 per hole 9 hole cash game at Pebble Beach the day after the Final. Goodman won $500 off the entertainer and with the Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression just days away the timing couldn’t have been better.\n\nAfter a disappointing Round 1 defeat in the 1930 U.S. Amateur Goodman was struggling to balance the competing priorities in his life. “Amateur golf is a rich man’s game, and I am far from rich. I am forced to make a living, and find it impossible to combine competitive golf with business.” However, he had no where to go. He was a man of the amateur era, one who believed the U.S. Amateur to be the greatest Championship in the world and who harboured strong Walker Cup hopes. Professional golf was no real solution at the time as the tour was still embryonic and only a handful were making a living on it. Whilst the retirement of Bobby Jones and the continuing Depression saw amateurism lose some of its attractiveness, save for the very wealthiest in society, Johnny chose steadfastly to continue along this path. However, with his fiancé Josephine Kersigo and her family to consider he did decide to take a job selling insurance in early 1931, offered to him by Pete Lyck, a friend from the Omaha Field Club.\n\nGoodman looked odds on for a place in the 1932 USA Walker Cup team after he qualified and then finished 14th and the leading amateur in that year’s U.S. Open. However, revealing the snobbery of the time, some regional prejudice and perhaps an implied accusation of professionalism, the USGA overlooked Johnny, neither naming him to their 10 man team or as an alternate. Many of those selected for the match at Brookline were either past their best or clearly did not have the recent playing record of the man from Omaha. The accompanying outcry from the nation’s golf correspondents finally led to the USGA making a statement. The Selection Committee, despite making their public announcement three days after the U.S. Open had finished, explained that their decision had actually been made before the Championship. Showing maturity beyond his years Johnny largely kept his own counsel and vowed to do his talking on the course. As the USA team comfortably beat GB&I 8-1 in Boston the selection soon became a moot point anyway.\n\nThe disappointment fuelled a run at the 1932 U.S. Amateur which started at Baltimore C.C. just ten days after the Walker Cup match finished. Gaining some redemption for his snub Goodman beat Francis Ouimet in the semi-final and was the last U.S. player left standing. However, despite being 2Up with 9 holes to play in the Final, he sadly failed to deliver the ultimate coup de grâce he had hoped for, losing 2&1 to Canadian Ross Somerville in their 36 hole match.\n\nThe 1933 U.S. Open took place at North Shore C.C. at Glenville, Illinois, a long, tight course made tougher by the baked fairways from a hot early summer. Rounds of 75, 66 – the joint lowest in Championship history at the time – and 70 gave Goodman a 6-shot lead heading into the final round. After a good start to Rd 4 his game deserted him on the final four holes of the front nine which he played in +4. Nevertheless to his credit he collected himself; playing the back nine in +1 he recorded a final round of 76. Thankful for a bogey 5 by his nearest challenger Ralph Guldahl on the 72nd hole Goodman ended up winning the Championship by 1-shot. Showing their continued disdain for the social standing of Johnny the USGA refused to formally present the famous trophy to their new 23 year old champion. Unusually there are no photos of USGA President Herbert H. Ramsey or any other official presenting the trophy to Goodman – reports said he simply lifted it off a presentation table himself.\n\nJohnny Goodman – 1933 U.S. Open Pathe News\n\nThis win in June 1933 saw Johnny Goodman became the last member of a select group which already included Jerry Travers, Francis Ouimet, Chick Evans and Bobby Jones – amateurs to beat the pros and win the U.S. Open Championship. 85 years later he remains the last amateur to win a major Championship.\n\nIn the light of his U.S. Open win Goodman refused to turn Pro. He continued with his insurance job turning down numerous touring, publishing and sponsorship opportunities that came his way. “Golf is a game for me, not a business” he said.\n\nJohnny Goodman With the U.S. Open Championship Trophy (Photo: USGA Museum)\n\nThe Masters was first played in late March 1934. Despite being the reigning U.S. Amateur champion it appears Johnny Goodman was not invited to compete by Bobby Jones, although he may simply have not been able to afford the time or cost of the trip. Ironically it was Goodman’s defeat of Jones at Pebble Beach in 1929 that created the time for him to visit the newly opened Cypress Point G.C. So taken with the course was Jones that he immediately decided that its designer Dr. Alistair MacKenzie would be handed control of any new course that he may build in the future. That course proved to be Augusta National. Despite clearly being one of America’s leading players in the 1930’s Goodman ended up playing in just one Masters. In 1936 he shot rounds of 80, 81 and 79 to finish 43rd. Perhaps Goodman didn’t take to the course and chose not to play in the event again.\n\nJohnny finally made his Walker Cup debut aged 24 at St. Andrews in May 1934. Captain Francis Ouimet played him No. 1 for the U.S. team and he didn’t disappoint, taking to links golf quickly. Paired with fellow rookie Lawson Little in the Day 1 Foursomes they beat a fading Cyril Tolley and Roger Wethered 8&6, Wethered in particular struggling throughout the 36 hole match. On Day 2 Goodman beat the British Captain and reigning Amateur champion, a 55 year old Hon. Michael Scott 7&6. The USA won the match 9.5-2.5 with golf writer Bernard Darwin describing Goodman’s play as “appallingly good.”\n\nThe following week Goodman crossed Scotland to play at Prestwick G.C. in the Amateur Championship. A straight knockout in those days the Omaha man reached the Quarter Finals where he succumbed to young Englishman Leslie Garnett 3&1. Johnny’s Foursomes partner Lawson Little went on to beat James Wallace by a record breaking 14&13 score. Little recorded twelve 3’s on the 23 holes played in the Final.\n\nAt the 1936 Walker Cup, played at Pine Valley G.C., Goodman was one of four returning USA players and again played at No. 1. Paired with Albert “Scotty” Campbell he won his Foursomes 7&5 against Hector Thomson and Harry Bentley. On Day 2 he again beat Thomson this time 3&2 in the Singles, maintaining his 100% win record and leading the USA to a famous 9-0 victory. There were no points awarded for halved matches in those days so it was not quite the whitewash it appeared.\n\nThe 1937 U.S. Amateur was played at Alderwood C.C. in Portland, Oregon. It would prove to be Johnny Goodman’s crowning glory. In his 1Up semi-final win against Bud Ward he one putted 15 greens. ‘Cinderella Man’ Ray Billows, known for his relaxed temperament (as well as finishing second), waited for him in the Final. Johnny stumbled down the home straight again but finished strongly to ultimately win by 2 holes. Finally accepted by the USGA, President John G. Jackson happily made the trophy presentation to a man who had now achieved the American double.\n\nJust 11 players have won the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open – Francis Ouimet (1914 / 1913 respectively), Jerome Travers (1907 / 1915), Chick Evans (1916 / 1916), Bobby Jones (1924 / 1923), Johnny Goodman (1937 / 1933), Lawson Little (1934 / 1940), Arnold Palmer (1954 / 1960), Gene Littler (1953 / 1961), Jack Nicklaus (1959 / 1962), Jerry Pate (1974 / 1976) and Tiger Woods (1994 / 2000). Goodman is the last player to win the U.S. Amateur after the U.S. Open.\n\nThe 10th Walker Cup match, played on 3-4 June 1938 at St. Andrews, again featured Johnny Goodman, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion. The U.S. team first travelled to Troon to play in the Amateur. An ‘unlucky’ draw saw Goodman beat Ray Billows 4&2 in Round 2 before falling 3&2 to Charles Kocsis in Round 4, both U.S. teammates. Unfortunately any form he had deserted him in his Walker Cup matches as he lost on both days as GB&I won for the first time 7-4. Hector Thomson got revenge for his 1939 defeat comfortably winning their repeat Singles 6&4. With World War II interrupting proceedings the next match would not be played until 1947 and hence this proved to be Johnny’s last involvement.\n\nBack home Johnny Goodman remained well known and respected. He featured on the cover of the popular Time Weekly Newsmagazine on 6 June 1938 under the heading ‘The King of Swings’ and in a story about him being the natural successor to Bobby Jones. To my knowledge Jones, Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods are the only other golfers to grace the cover of this famous U.S. magazine.\n\nJohnny Goodman – Time Magazine, 6th June 1938\n\nShortly afterwards Johnny married Josephine in Omaha, Lawson Little acting as his best man, and with little money moved in with his mother in law.\n\nHowever, on the golfing front his play started to drift and he was never to contend in a big event again.\n\nThe Pearl Harbour attack just a few days before Johnny’s 32nd birthday in December 1941, which led to the United States’ entering World War II, changed more than just the golfing landscape. Goodman found himself called up to serve in the Quartermaster Corps and ended up being posted to India.\n\nOnce the War was over Johnny settled back into family life. He left the insurance world and started working for his brother in law John Atkins who had become a successful beer distributor and club owner in Omaha. 1947 proved to be a pivotal year in his life. Firstly he and Josephine had a son, Johnny Goodman Jr. and then he was involved in a serious car crash, badly breaking his right arm. Any hope of resurrecting his top level golf career was lost in the crash.\n\nThe Goodman’s eventually decided a change of scene was needed and in 1950 the family moved to South Gate in Southern California. He used his knowledge and trade connections to obtain a sales job for Canada Dry.\n\nUnfortunately a restructuring led to Johnny losing this job eventually and he started to drink more than he should. In 1959 he became ill and very nearly died from complications brought about by cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nHe survived and having adopted a healthier lifestyle started to play more golf. He enjoyed playing with Johnny Jr. and shortly afterwards turned Pro to take up a teaching position at the Bellflower Golf Center in California.\n\nOn the 8th August 1970 Johnny Goodman died in his sleep aged 60. Just a few days earlier he had travelled back to Omaha Field and played a round at his old club with his nephew Jack Atkins. It was his goodbye to the game he loved. He was buried in Omaha in a nondescript grave without headstone. More recently a municipal golf course in the southwest of the City has been named in his honour.\n\nJohnny Goodman earned next to nothing for his golfing exploits and faced discrimination throughout most of his career. However, his story is one of the more interesting ones and his U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open wins mean he has his place in the record books forever and should perhaps be better remembered by the golfing world.\n\nME.\n\nCopyright © 2014-2023, Mark Eley. All rights reserved.\n\n21st March 2016\n\nOn Friday 20th June 1930 Bobby Jones shot rounds of 74 and 75 at Hoylake to win The Open Championship and secure the second leg of his famous Grand Slam. Despite being only 28 he must have been exhausted. 36-holes on the final day and the mental exertions of winning as the favourite would have taken their toll on anyone. Nevertheless the following day he left the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and drove himself 120 miles south to Blackwell Golf Club in Worcestershire.\n\nDr. William (‘Bill’) Tweddell was the reason why.\n\nDr. William Tweddell – 1927 Amateur Champion (Photo: Getty images)\n\nTweddell was born on 21st March 1897 in the prosperous town of Whickham in County Durham, a few miles west of Newcastle under Tyne. He started playing golf when he was 7, his family having moved to Leyburn in North Yorkshire. Tweddell developed an upright back swing with arched wrists which was far from elegant but that enabled him to score. He was also said to be a slow player but one who had good concentration and a sound temperament, which meant that on his day he could be a match for anyone.\n\nAfter school he joined the Army, serving with the Durham Light Infrantry in World War I. He became a Lieutenant and won the Military Cross and Bar at Passchendaele in 1917.\n\nOnce demobbed he went on to study Medicine at Aberdeen University. He played golf for the University in 1922, ’23 and ’24, often at Murcar Links and Royal Aberdeen. Dr. Tweddell later became the first President of the Scottish Universities Golfing Society, which was established in October 1906.\n\nHaving qualified he moved to a Manchester G.P. practice before quickly changing course and settling in The Black Country. He served the communities of Wordsley and Kingswinford (interestingly, at least for me, the place I was born and brought up) for the rest of his working life, living happily in the area. A Roman Catholic Tweddell married Dorothy Hillman at the Oratory Church in Birmingham on 2nd May 1930. They left the church through an arch of golf clubs held by guests.\n\nThe couple had three children William (like his father known as Bill), Mary-Ann and Michael. Bill also qualified as a Doctor and practiced in Wordsley and Kingswinford too. He was also Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. Club Doctor between 1981 and 1994. Dr. Tweddell Jnr. died on 8th December 2015 aged 84. His daughter is the mother of Ben Robinson, the Worcestershire golfer currently studying at Louisiana Tech on a golf scholarship [Ben turned Pro in June 2016]. Michael’s son Matt Tweddell graduated from Hawaii Pacific University in 2014 and now plays golf professionally, mostly in Asia.\n\nDr. Tweddell joined Stourbridge Golf Club in late 1926 on his arrival in the area. Established in 1892 and located in Pedmore it was his most convenient option at the time. He continued to play well into his 70s, where his sons eventually joined him, and occasionally still posted scores below his age. He was Club Captain in 1928 and President between 1955-7.\n\nClearly Tweddell’s new working and golfing life in the West Midlands suited him as in 1927 he earned his greatest golfing achievement. He won The Amateur Championship at Hoylake, beating home player D. Eustace Landale 7&6 in the Final.\n\nHe played in 24 of the 29 Amateur Championships held between 1921 and 1955 (World War II). He played 77 matches in total, winning 54 and losing 23. His win percentage of 70.13% is the 9th best for players who competed in at least 20 Amateurs. However his studies, his career and his family were important to him and he seems to have always viewed golf as just a sport to be enjoyed. His relaxed approach and friendly personality made him popular amongst his peers. He had a few good runs and over such an extended period met and competed against many of the great players from the first half of the 20th Century.\n\nHe had one other very real opportunity to win The Amateur. In 1935 he lost at Royal Lytham & St. Annes, the first time this course had hosted the Championship, to the defending champion and reigning US Amateur champion W. Lawson Little.\n\nHerbert Warren Wind writing in ‘The Story of American Golf’ about the Final said about Tweddell: “He was a consistent low 70s shooter although, at first glance, he looked like a golfer who would have his work cut out to break 85. His arm action was stiff, and on his irons especially he aimed far to the right of his target and allowed for lots of draw. In 1935 he was playing hardly any tournament golf and might not have entered the Amateur had the week of the Championship not coincided with the vacation the doctor’s doctor had ordered him to take. Tweddell lost to Little but it is difficult not to think of him as the hero of their exciting match.”\n\nLittle, according to Warren Wind “was odds on favourite to take the final….by 7 and 6, 8 and 7 or some similarly secure margin” but ended up only winning the 36-hole Final by 1-hole.\n\nTweddell with Little at the 1935 Amateur Championship (Photo: Historic Images)\n\nTweddell played in The Open Championship just once although it was a good one to view first hand – 1927 at St. Andrews with Bobby Jones the winner. He probably felt some obligation as Amateur champion as he appears to have made no effort to do so before or after. Jones won with a 285 total whilst The Doctor was well down the field on 306. He later admitted “I really am unable to play my game, or what I call my game, when I know that Bobby Jones is playing on the same course. Since I watched him at St. Andrews winning the British Open, I have had an inferiority complex.”\n\nTweddell was selected for England’s match against Scotland in 1928 (won), 1929 (halved) and 1930 (won). He also played in the Home Internationals in 1935, which only started in 1932 (England, Ireland and Scotland tied).\n\nDr. Tweddell’s second most noteworthy contribution to golf lies in The Walker Cup, although it can hardly be described as successful. He was playing captain of Great Britain & Ireland in both 1928 and 1936, albeit he chose not to play himself in the latter match. In 1928 at Chicago G.C. Tweddell paired himself with T. Phil Perkins in the Foursomes, another West Midlander and the reigning Amateur champion. They lost 7&6 in their 36-hole match with George Von Elm and Jesse Sweetser. In the Singles Tweddell lost again to Von Elm, this time 3&2. Perkins lost 13&12 to US Captain Bobby Jones – the 26 year old setting the event’s record defeat. At the end of play the 1928 match was lost 11-1.\n\nBobby Jones and Dr. William Tweddell – 1930 Walker Cup at Chicago (Photo: USGA)\n\nThe 1936 Walker Cup match was played at the relatively new and extremely difficult Pine Valley in New Jersey – an inexperienced GB&I team lost 9-0 to USA despite arriving early and practicing on site for 8 days beforehand. Three matches were halved but back then points were only allocated for victories. The record books therefore show the 1936 match as the only whitewash in the history of the competition.\n\nDespite playing in a golfing era closely depicted by cigarette cards he featured only sparingly presumably reflecting his modest playing schedule and relative low profile.\n\nIn 1956 Dr. Tweddell captained a British Seniors team in a match against America and Canada played in Bermuda.\n\nHis contribution and standing in the game was rewarded when in 1961-62 Dr. Tweddell, by then 64, was elected Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrew’s.\n\nSo back to the match at Blackwell. The story goes that Tweddell invited his opposing Walker Cup captain Bobby Jones to play an exhibition match in the Midlands over dinner in 1928. When the date in 1930 had been agreed Tweddell made arrangements for the match to take place at Blackwell G.C., a local club he had been made an honorary member of following his Amateur victory 3 years earlier. Blackwell was (and still is) a much sterner test than Stourbridge, located 5 miles to the north so this decision was entirely understandable, albeit I can imagine it didn’t go down well at his home Club. Tweddell was no fool and paired himself with Jones. They took on two leading local golfers, Stanley Lunt from Moseley and Eric Fiddian, another Stourbridge amateur. Lunt went on to win the English Amateur in 1934 whilst Fiddian was the 1927 British Boys champion and went on to play in the Walker Cup’s of 1932 and ’34. Jones, perhaps not surprisingly arrived two hours late given the exertions of the day before and the lengthy drive – sadly for him the M6 and M5 were still to be built. A photo was taken (see below) before the match quickly got underway. It was a relaxed affair with Jones and Tweddell eventually running out 3&2 winners. Jones enjoyed the course and particularly the par 3 13th hole that it is said he later used as a blueprint for the famous 12th at Augusta.\n\nTweddell, Jones, Lunt and Fiddian at Blackwell G.C. (Photo: Blackwell G.C.)\n\nDr. William Tweddell was an amateur golfer in the truest historical sense. He died on 5th November 1985 but there seems to have been little celebration of his life in the golfing world at the time. That’s a shame as his victory in the 1927 Amateur Championship and role in the formative years of The Walker Cup certainly place him above the rank and file. What I particularly like about him, and you can see for yourself, is that in all the old photos I can find he seems to have a broad smile on his face. It seems obvious looking at these as to why he was such a popular character.\n\nAt the end of the day any friend of Bobby Jones is a friend of mine.\n\nME.\n\nCopyright © 2014-2023, Mark Eley. All rights reserved.\n\nUPDATE – Eric O’Brien has rightly pulled me up in the Comments section below on my failure to mention Slow Play. He is absolutely right. There were some players who were very slow and the R&A / USGA referees failed to punish them. I know this was the Walker Cup and it was important but unless the matter is addressed in high profile events like this how will this problem in our game ever start to be eradicated.\n\n15th September 2015\n\nWho would have predicted a 16.5 – 9.5 victory for Great Britain & Ireland (GB&I). Perhaps just Captain Nigel Edwards in his wildest dreams ? The record breaking win was a magnificent achievement for Nigel and all of his players.\n\nThe GB&I Team Celebrate Their Walker Cup Win (Photo: GolfBible)\n\nThe GB&I performance was particularly pleasing as they were up against a strong USA team – at least on paper and we now know preferably playing on parkland courses back home. The GB&I players performed superbly to a man and the final results made something of a mockery of the world rankings.\n\nThe detailed 2015 Walker Cup results can be reviewed here – Walker Cup Results.\n\nHaving reflected on the weekend’s events here’s my 16.5 observations on the 2015 Walker Cup: –\n\nGB&I Simply Played Better Than The USA\n\nThe overall standard of golf that I saw was very high – these guys can really play. As we all know the team that chips and putts best normally wins these competitions. This weekend GB&I outplayed USA but particularly with these scoring shots. As such few holes were conceded softly and victories were therefore frequent on a tough course where the green surrounds are undulating and scattered with deep bunkers. It was great to see all ten members of the GB&I team contributing at least a point to the total.\n\nNigel Edwards\n\nExperienced, focussed, motivated and respected by his players Nigel (47) was in supreme control of events at Lytham. He simply put on a captaincy masterclass at this Walker Cup. Save for the Horsfield debacle, which I guess he has to take some responsibility for, he seemed to get every decision right. His team selection, pairings and playing orders were spot on. Nigel has undoubtedly earned the right to captain the team in the USA in 2017 should he wish to take on the responsibility again. His age, background and role with England Golf means he is close to the players and knows what is required better than almost anyone else. #WeWantFour\n\nWhy Change A Winning Formula – We Want Four ! (© Golf Bible)\n\nThe English Contribution Was Key\n\nAhead of the match all the talk was of Ireland’s ‘famous five’ but it was England’s Ashley Chesters and Jimmy Mullen that shone brightest. A rock solid foursomes partnership delivered under pressure and set the foundation for a comprehensive team win. Perhaps helped by being under the radar a little, albeit exposed by being sent out towards the top of the order in each series, Jimmy secured 4 points out of 4 whilst Ashley achieved 3.5 out of 4. Having said that Ashley’s dropped half came against Bryson DeChambeau – who denied him with a golfing near miracle on the 18th on Saturday afternoon – and any points taken from him during the match were always going to be a bonus.\n\nEngland’s Ashley Chesters and Jimmy Mullen (© @WalkerCup)\n\nCormac Sharvin and Jack McDonald\n\nThe two Sterling University players really impressed me at Lytham and perhaps demonstrated better than anyone else on the team what made GB&I so strong this year. It was clear they got on well and had played golf together many times before this match started. Their personalities dovetailed as well as their foursomes play. The calmer McDonald who played with a smile on his face counter-balancing the outwardly more hyper and focussed Sharvin. To say Sharvin was ‘up for it’ would be an understatement from what I saw.\n\nCaptain Edwards, Jack McDonald and Cormac Sharvin (© @WalkerCup)\n\nEwen Ferguson\n\nEwen’s non-selection then selection must have been difficult for him but he got on with it and contributed fully to the team both on and off the course. He played three of the most memorable shots of the competition too – his drive on the par 4th 16th on Saturday, his final putt on 18 on Saturday (video 1) and then his superb chip-in on 17 on Sunday (video 2). I was stood right in front of him when he played the chip and it’s fair to say that some of his mates from Glasgow and myself briefly lowered the tone of the event.\n\nBoth Videos Courtesy of @WalkerCup and the BBC\n\nSome Of The USA Team Didn’t Show Up\n\nW"
