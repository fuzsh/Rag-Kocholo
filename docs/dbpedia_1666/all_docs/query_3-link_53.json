        "text": "Roland Garros is an annual tennis tournament often referred to as the French Open and is one of the sport’s four major events, so here is everything you need to know.\n\nWinning Roland Garros secures a player their spot in tennis’ history and can count towards a Grand Slam. It is one of just four major events on the ATP and WTA Tours with the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. Roland Garros also falls as the second major each year.\n\nThe best male and female tennis players head to Roland Garros from late May to early June every year to compete for the French Open. It is even tennis’ only major event to be played on a clay court, with Roland Garros providing a unique challenge for any of the competitors.\n\nTennis’ greats have even descended on France to play at Roland Garros ever since 1891. The 2024 edition is the 128th running of the tournament, which became a Grand Slam event in 1925. So, with that in mind, here is everything that you need to know about Roland Garros.\n\nWhere is Roland Garros? Where is the French Open held?\n\nRoland Garros or as it is often referred to as the French Open earns its nickname as it is held in Paris. The tournament also takes place at the Stade Roland Garros, which is a collection of courts that are located in Paris’ 16th arrondissement, Bois de Boulogne, in the city’s west.\n\nHistory of Roland Garros\n\nRoland Garros has been the traditional second major event of the tennis schedule each year since 1987. But the tournament itself dates back to 1891 with the first men’s championship. The first women’s championship at Roland Garros did not follow suit until the 1897 edition.\n\nThe French Open also closed its doors between 1915 and 1919 due to World War I. But the tournament did take place during WWII. However, the editions between 1941 and 1945 did not receive endorsement by the French Tennis Federation which organises the actual event.\n\nIt was also not until 1928 that the French Open found its home at the Stade Roland Garros, to which it earns its predominant name now. Organisers originally took the French Open to the Racing Club de France and to the Stade Francais of Paris in alternative years until 1927.\n\nEarly editions of the French Open prior to WWI are not considered toward a player’s Grand Slam record, as well. The tournament was first run as a French club members-only event. It only invited players from the 1925 edition and it did not see a foreign champion until 1927.\n\nMen’s title winners at Roland Garros earn a replica of the Coupe des Mousquetaires, while the women’s champions receive the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen. French Open champions have received the trophies since 1953 but the designs have also been adapted through the years.\n\nLa Maison Mellerio, a Parisian jewellers with roots in the 17th century, produces the Roland Garros trophies. Additionally, the Coupe des Mousquetaires became the Musketeers’ Cup in 1981 as it pays tribute to Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet and Rene Lacoste.\n\nSimilarly, the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen received its current name in 1979 in the honour of six-time Roland Garros champion, Suzanna Lenglen. It is almost identical to the trophy Lenglen received from the City of Nice throughout her dominant period between 1920 and 1926.\n\nWhy is Roland Garros played on a clay court?\n\nRoland Garros is the only major tennis event played on a clay court, with Wimbledon going alone with a grass court compared to the Australian Open and US Open taking hard courts.\n\nClay courts are more common in central European and Latin American countries owing to its superior ability to withstand warmer climates. Yet clay was at first initially used as a practical measure above all else in 1880 to cover grass courts that had started to wilt due to the heat.\n\nOrganisers of Roland Garros use a total of five layers totalling nearly 80 centimetres thick for the clay courts. The first layer is made of stones for drainage, followed by at least 30cm of crushed gravel, 7-8cm of clinker (volcanic coal residue), 6-7cm of crushed white limestone and 1-2mm of crushed red brick dust. The last layer is also what gives the courts’ ochre hue.\n\nRoland Garros also opts to go alone with clay courts to provide a unique challenge. The clay surface is slower than grass or hard courts and also changes the way and direction a tennis ball bounces. It can also produce greater spin and encourages top spin, slice and drop shots.\n\nPlayers who are raised playing on clay courts often enjoy the most success at Roland Garros, as well. But the courts demand a lot of maintenance with organisers sweeping them before, during and after games, as well as watering them after games and intensively in the evening.\n\nWho has won the most Roland Garros titles?\n\nSpanish tennis legend Rafael Nadal has won the most men’s Roland Garros titles in the Open Era with 14. He took the Coupe des Mousquetaires home after winning the French Open in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2022.\n\nHenri Cochet, meanwhile, won the most men’s Roland Garros titles in the Amateur Era with four. The Frenchman won in 1926, 1928, 1930 and 1932. Max Decugis also won eight times whilst it was the French Championships between 1903 and 1914 with three dominant runs.\n\nAmerican tennis great Chris Evert has won the most women’s titles at Roland Garros in the Open Era with seven. She won the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen in 1974, 1975, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1985 and 1986. Suzanne Lenglen won the most titles as the French Championships with six.\n\nWho is the youngest person to ever win Roland Garros?\n\nMichael Chang became the youngest person to win a men’s title at Roland Garros to date in 1989. The American won the tournament three months after celebrating his 17th birthday.\n\nMonica Seles also became the youngest person to win a women’s title at Roland Garros thus far in 1990. The Yugoslavian won the tournament at the age of 16 years and six months old.\n\nWho is the oldest person to ever win Roland Garros?\n\nSerbian tennis icon Novak Djokovic became the oldest person to win a men’s title at Roland Garros in 2023. The Grand Slam legend won his third French Open at 36 years and 20 days.\n\nZsuzsa Kormoczy remains the oldest person to win a women’s title at Roland Garros. She set the record way back in 1958 when the Hungarian won at the age of 33 years and 10 months.\n\nWhat is the prize money for Roland Garros 2024?\n\nThe prize money available for the players at Roland Garros increases year-on-year, with the pool available at the 2024 edition marking an increase of 7.8% on 2023. It stands at €53.5m (£46m) in 2024, but the figure includes the prize money available for all players competing.\n\nThe men’s and women’s singles champions will each receive €2.4m (£2m) and the defeated finalists will earn €1.2m (£1m). The championship-winning teams in the men’s doubles and women’s doubles will receive €590k (£505k) per team for winning at Roland Garros in 2024.\n\nMen’s and women’s singles prize money at Roland Garros 2024\n\nWho are the previous men’s singles champions of Roland Garros?\n\nHere is a list of every men’s champion at Roland Garros, including when it was run as the French Championship from 1891 until 1967 and as the French Open from 1968 to today.\n\n1891 – H.
