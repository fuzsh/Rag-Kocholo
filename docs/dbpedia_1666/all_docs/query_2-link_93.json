I have t o thank John Emms for not only letting me write it, but actually suggesting it in the first place. A chess career is nothing without the company of fellow travelers. Thanks for the memories to my grandmaster colleagues, John Fedorowicz, Michael Wilder, Larry Christiansen, Nick DeFirmian, Yasser Seirawan, and Michael Rohde. They made the journey worthwhile.\n\nI wouldn't be in the teaching business now if not for my good friends John MacArthur and Sophia Rohde. Deborah Quinn Benjamin came into my life very late in my playing career. I can't help feeling some results from the past would have come out differently if I had known her love and support at the time. Thanks to Debbie, I can enjoy the present and future more than a dozen U.S. Championship titles. My parents, Phyllis and Alan, knew how to support my chess endeavors with­ out trying to control them. My father didn't live to see the recent chapters of my life, but his presence will always be felt.\n\nI dedicate this book to his memory.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHi, my name is Joel. I'm a forty-three year-old Pisces. I like sports, crossword puz­ zles, nature programs, and controlled mating attacks. Welcome to my story.\n\nIn the past, when this book was purely hypothetical, I thought a lot about what to include. The games tell much of the story; put in the context of the tourna­ ments, they reveal not only my best accomplishments but also my ups and downs, my dreams fulfilled and my hopes dashed. I have sprinkled in a number of my favorite anecdotes (the ones I can tell in the name of decency) and capsule sum­ maries of several of my colleagues. People and places made the games worth playing. I hope that I have conveyed the excitement, intensity, frustration, disap­ pointment, and joy of being an American chess professional. It gives me great pleasure (and hopefully some for the readers, too) to recount the \"what it was like then\", but the \"what it is like now\" impacts the future of chess in America. In the last section I have described various problems that con­ front the ctirrent American chess scene. I don't claim to have easy solutions, but bringing the issues to the forefront may help us move in the right direction.\n\n5\n\nC h a pter One\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nIn 1972, Phyllis Benjamin needed an activity for her fifth grade club. All the obvi­\n\nous choices had been taken, so her husband, Alan, suggested chess. Her principal liked the idea, leading to, after many twists and turns, a scholastic chess revolu­ tion. It also put P.S. 222 on Bill Goichberg's mailing list. One boy from the club wanted to play in the Greater New York Elementary Championship. More signifi­ cantly, Phyllis took the flyer home and found her son eager to try his luck in a tournament. I had learned to play earlier that year, probably from my big brother Steven (that's the family consensus, though I don't remember the moment). My parents were good casual players, and my older sister Rochelle played a little, too (years later she would accidentally play the first six moves of an Alekhine Defense). I was enthralled by the greatest chess event to date, the Fischer-Spassky match. That summer I watched the match coverage on television and got hooked on chess. I was only a third-grader in the fall, at eight-years-old too young for my school's new chess club. But I wasn't too young for Goichberg's tournament That event, held in December at the old McAlpin Hotel in Manhattan, marked the beginning of the \"Fischer Boom\" . Parents now viewed chess as a positive ac­ tivity for their children, and it showed in the attendance. More-than 1000 kids, most of them with no tournament experience, produced a zoo-like atmosphere. I played in the Lower Elementary (third grade and below) section. It was di­ vided into prelims and finals. The rounds of the prelims were unscheduled -you just found someone in your group and played. In my very first game I took ad­ vantage of a little girl (heavens no!) who was not prepared for the four-move checkmate. I collected the pieces so fast she wasn't convinced I had won, but a spectator confirmed the mate. 7\n\nAmerican 6fandmaster I ended up with a !'ii-3 score and earned a pocket chess set for my efforts. One ' year lat�r I was bask again to try my luck in the Upper Eleme�tary section. Why the long layoff? My membership entitled-me to receive Chess Life & F,eview, but I don't remem­ ber reading it. My uncle, Marty Merado,. was a strong tournament player (he holds the record for most consecutive U.S. Open appearances). For some reason we didn't ask him about 'tournaments. So I managed to stay blissfully unaware of any other competitio!ls. I did a·point better my second time around. My 7-2 score won me my first , chess trophy. I was psyched to come back in December 1974. That probably would have been my next tournament, if not for a chance con­ versation my mother had with another chess mom. \"Is Joel playing at Chess Nuts next montl\\?': the woman .asked. My mother had two questions spring to mind: On� \"what is 'Chess Nuts'?\" (a small club in Queens) and two, \"There are other tournaments?\" I played in Chess Nuts and took my initial first place trophy with a perfect score. I was off and running.\n\n8\n\nC h a pter Two\n\nSecond Coming...of Bobby?\n\n1974, school chess programs were virtually non-existent in America (in fact, ·my mother's program at P.S. 222 was one of the earliest significant ones in the coun­ try). Most kids from that era (especially in the Northeast) owe a debt of gratitude to Bill Goichberg's Continental Chess Association (CCA). Over the next few years I nourished my chess cravings on a steady diet of CCA Under-13 and Pre-HS tournaments, as well as the occasional adult open event. In\n\nToday Goichberg is known for organizing large open tournaments. But back then he was obsessed with junior chess. He calculated his own rating system and published lists of the top players in each grade. I was thrilled to see my name in the CCA fourth grade list, and stunned to see the rating of the top seventh grader. Lewis Cohen was listed at 2000-it had to be a misprint! Could a rating really start with a two? Every kid with a decent rating made Goichberg's radar. When he held a com­ petition for the top scholastic players in the metropolitan area, I got an invitation. There were fewer chess teachers then, and they had a difficult time connecting with potential students. A group called U.S. Chess Masters offered fr�e trial les­ sons to the kids at the tournament. I had never heard of chess lessons, but when the master showed me how I could have better handled my opponent's Danish Gambit, I was awfully impressed. Bruce Pandolfini, twenty years from immortality in the film Searching for Bobby Fischer, apparently liked what he saw from me. He passed me along with a glow­ ing recommendation to the teacher in the group most adept at working with young children, George Kane. [Years later Pandolfini gave me the note, which praised my parents and stated \"Goichberg swears by him\".]\n\n9\n\nAmerican Grandmaster Pale and scrawny with long hair, Kane had a spooky appearance but a sooth­ ing manner with children. My father, who sat in on the occasional lesson, admired the improvement in my vocabulary (George taught me big words like \"motif\"). But I learned a whole lot of strategy, too, enough to rise to (USCF) 1600 in the first year and expert level (2000) by the end of 1975. When Kane left for California, I worked with IM Julio Kaplan (former World Junior Champion from Puerto Rico) for a year until he also shipped off to California. A third U.S. Chess Master, IM Sal Matera took me on next...and decided to stay in New York. Matera would take me through the successes of my teen years. I steadily dominated scholastic and youth events, winning not only Greater New York titles but the inaugural National Elementary Championship in 1976. [Goichberg ran that, too; the USCF did not takec possession of the Nationals for several years.] In the spring of 1975 the venerable Manhattan Chess Club began to host a series of events called Young Junior Invitationals. After winning several of these events, I graduated to directing them. My rating was only among the top players when I won the first Young Junior. I was still pretty much unknown, but club President Moses Mitchell, on the sugges­ tion of club Manager Jeff Kastner, offered me a free membership. That day changed my life, for my long-lasting association with the Manhattan brought me great pleasure and knowledge. I think it was at the Manhattan C.C. where I first heard people speak of me as the \"second Fischer\". The label did produce some backlash -one old lady said I was \"not worthy of licking Fischer's boots\" -but most people were very suppor­ tive. But when you think of the prodigious exploits we routinely see from today's chess children, you might wonder why people made so much fuss about me so soon. First you must consider that we were only a few years removed from Fischer's Championship at the time. More than thirty years later now, we tend to view Fischer's amazing accomplishment as an anomaly we aren't likely to see repeated. But then, anything was possible, if we could just identify the prodigy to replace him. After Fischer forfeited his title and seemed unlikely to return, the search in­ tensified. Secondly, the world chess community was much smaller and weaker in those days. Many of today's prodigy producing countries like China and India were barely involved in chess then. Azerbaijan and Ukraine were stifled within the So­ viet Union, which let few players play abroad. Before databases and the Internet, we knew very little about what was going on in the rest of the world.\n\n10\n\nThe Second Coming ... of Bobby? Thirdly, Fischer's achievements seemed less daunting thanks to a reachable re­ cord he possessed. Fischer set the record for youngest USCF master (2200) at age thirteen. That record had stood for two decades, so people could not foresee that it would be absolutely shattered in the years to come. The number 2200 is really quite arbitrary for a landmark. Fischer did not truly come into his own until fourteen and fifteen, when he earned the international master and grandmaster titles, respectively. Master to grandmaster in two years is just phenomenal, unlikely to be duplicated by any other American player. In 1976 Goichberg organized a round-robin international at the Manhattan Chess\n\nClub. Such tournaments were few and far between; many players coveted spots in the field. Young players like Michael Rohde, Ron Henley, and Mark Diesen had already established themselves, but the two youngest invitees ignited controversy. Michael Wilder, at thirteen the youngest master since Fischer, and yours truly, age twelve and 2100, took quite a few lumps in the tournament. I managed my first win over an IM (Canadian Bruce Amos) and draws with Rohde and Edmar Med­ nis. Wilder beat me and finished slightly better. GM Bill Lombardy publicly criticized our participation in the tournament. I don't know if the search for another Fischer should justify this kind of \"affirma­ tive action\" . But I do know that the experience from my first international helped me to score better the next time around. I scored 50% in a nine-round futurity to earn a 2300 FIDE rating. [Arpad Elo tried to nix that rating as well as the ratings of several other \"overrated\" Americans.] In my next international, I beat my first GM (Heikki Westerinen) as well as Soltis, Valvo, and Fedorowicz. So it bugged me when Lombardy claimed that the punishment we received in this tournament would cripple our confidence. No one has ever been ruined by facing strong competition, but plenty of players have failed to develop from not facing strong competition. The first run towards Fischer's record came in the summer of 1975. I gained about 300 points, 200 coming in the U.S. Open. I scored 6-6 despite being paired up eleven times. Despite still being relatively unknown, I managed to make the front page of the newspaper and play chess with GM Arthur Bisguier on local television (when the Cornhuskers aren't playing, there isn't much going on in Lin­ coln, Nebraska). By the end of the year I reached 2000 and broke Fischer's record for youngest USCF expert. The 1975 Atlantic Open provided my first win against a master (Dan Shapiro).\n\n11\n\nAmerican Grandmaster I struggled to make it through the.expert class for more than a year. During this time I not only gained valuable experience, but made lifelong friends as well. At the 1976 U.S. Open in Fairfax Virginia I had my first encounters with future GMs John Fedorowicz and Nick DeFirmian. IM Mark Diesen had just returned from a European journey and decided to use me to stir up some tremble. When I was paired with Fedorowicz, Diesen suggested I say something to Fed. We sat down to play, I looked my older and bigger opponent in the eye and carried out Diesen's instructions. \"You're a wimp,\" I said. Fed was taken aback, but soon got his bearings back. \"Well, you're a wittle kid.\" It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Fed crushed me that day, but I retaliated enough subsequently to post a lifetime plus score. I contested a sharp struggle with DeFirmian in which I dropped a kingside pawn bu t developed an initiative aimed at his king on the other side. Unable to find a breakthrough, I offered a draw. With his flag hanging, he had no choice but \" to accept. Our seminal moment of friendship would come two years later (see Chapter 8). My final push came shortly after my thirteenth birthday. A strong result in the Continental Open in April 1977 brought me to the cusp of 2200. The World Open in July put me over the top. At thirteen and four months, I was the youngest mas­ ter in USCF history. Around the time of the World Open I attracted the attention of the producers of an NBC program called \"Junior Ball of Fame\". I was selected as one of several sports prodigies (the best known by far being tennis star Tracey Austin) . The cameras followed me to Philadelphia and filmed the climax of my crucial defeat of veteran Philadelphia player (and future IM) Bruce Rind .\n\nD J.Benjamin • B.Rind World Open, Phi ladelphia 1977 1 Nf3 cs 2 e4 Nc6 3 b3 d6 4 Bbs Bd7 s o-o es 6 c3 Nf6 7 Rel Be7 8 d4 cxd4 9 cxd4 a6 10 Bxc6 Bxc6 11 Nc3 o-o 12 Bb2 Qas 13 Qd2 RfeS 14 Rad1 Raes 1s h3 h6 16 Nh4 bs?!

Short of time, Rind succumbs to an optical illusion. He puts his rook in front of his king to offer protection, but by ceding the back rank, he dooms his king in­ stead. After 29 ...Rd8 30 Be3 Bd7 I still prefer White slightly. My king is safer, and the h-pawn might become a factor.\n\n30 Bh6+ Ke7 31 Rd1 Qe4 32 Qg8 Bd5 33 f3 The poor black queen is yanked away from the defense of his bishop, leading\n\n13\n\nAmerican Grandmaster to a rapid fire finish.\n\n33 Qe2 34 Qf8+ K d7 3 5 Rxd5+ K c6 36 Qcs+ Kb7 37 Rd7+ K a8 38 Qa7 mate .•.\n\nThe crowd drawn by the TV cameras burst into applause, much to the consterna­ tion of the masters trying to concentrate on their games. Much to my dismay, the cameraman told Rind that the last few moves happened too quickly for him to follow. Would he mind replaying the finish on camera? I was horrified-imagine asking a basketball player to pretend guarding Michael Jordan while he hits the game winning shot again? To my surprise, Rind agreed-an impressive show of class. I'm not sure I would have managed to do the same.\n\n14\n\nCha pter Th ree\n\nJunior Days\n\nOld School While many of my \"civilian\" friends had to take on part-time jobs, I jump started my college fund with earnings from scholastic championships. Today the USCF nms very successful National Scholastics, with thousands of kids competing for trophies while their parents shell out big bucks in expenses. In the 70's and early 80's, Goichberg ran these nationals and provided powerful incentives for the best players to participate. By topping a field I outrated by 500 points, I earned $400 in the National Elementary. The Junior High School Title, only slightly more diffi­ cult, reeled in $500. That left me with three years to shoot for the National High School title and its $1000 bonanza. I jumped out to the lead in 1979 with seven wins. When I gave up draws in the last two rounds, Jim Rizzitano caught me and sent the title up for tiebreaks. Hav­ ing led the whole way and faced the strongest competition, I expected to come out on top. Unfortunately, one of my defeated rivals decided to drop his last few games on purpose. My tiebreaks were torpedoed and I had to settle for sec­ ond... though the money was still split. Under current rules, two players who tie for first would be considered co­ champions. Unfortunately, the USCF does not recognize this as a title for me and has always listed me as a two-time High School Champion. In the next two years I managed to avoid the dreaded tiebreak, triumphing over worthy rivals in Wilder and Maxim Dlugy. I played on a competitive team for the first time in 1981. With assistance from master Simon Yelsky, my James Madison High team came within a whisker of first, but Boston Latin, led by San­ deep Joshi, edged us out. We developed a sudden reputation as a Brooklyn chess school. Two strong Russians, Stan Rosenfeld and future U.S. Junior Champion Jon 15\n\nAmerican Grandmaster Litvinchuk, walked into the school and asked to attend. The faculty chess advi­ sor-my father, Alan Benjamin-was only too happy to facilitate their transfer. Naturally, the year after my graduation Madison won the title. For an educator, my father was quite a good player, reaching into the 1700s at his peak. The old Madison teams served as a model for the future powerhouses at Edward R. Murrow, profiled in Michael Weinreb's The Kings of New York. Their faculty advisor, Eliot Weiss, started as a teacher trainee with my mother at P.S. 222. It's a small world.\n\nReady for the Big Kids The rosters of the U.S. Junior Championships of the mid to late 70's boasted his­ toric names, including Larry Christiansen, Fedorowicz, DeFirmian, Diesen, Rohde, Ron Henley, and Jon Tisdall. All these players became GMs except for Diesen, who won the World Jllllior Championship. But they had all reached their twentieth birthday before my first appearance in 1979. The most significant holdover was Yasser Seirawan. Despite his heavy favorite status, Seirawan struggled with losses in his first two games. Our own encounter surpassed all my expectations. At 19, Yasser was four years older and more estab­ lished. His strategical prowess was already well known. If he had one Achilles heel, it was susceptibility to the occasional mating attack. So I knew the best chance to beat Yasser was to throw the kitchen sink at him. As with many of the old games, this one loses a bit of its luster when Fritz is brought in for an analytical consult. Still, I've very proud of this game, which re­ mains my favorite to this day.\n\nD J.Benjamin • Y.Seirawan U.S. Junior Cha mpionship 1979 1 e4 e6 2 d4 ds 3 Nd2 Nf6 4 es Nfd7 s Bd3 cs 6 c3 Nc6 7 Ngf3 cxd4 8 cxd4 Nb6 This is typical of Yasser's inclination to avoid tactical lines in the opening.

Yasser wanted to close the c-file and support the d5-pawn against possible sac­ rifices. But he gives White an extra tempo to crack open lines for the attack. The other capture, 24 ...

He published (and wrote, for the most part) the excellent magazine Inside Chess; he attempted to reunite the World Cham­ pionship and create a more professional chess environment; he found a multi-year sponsor for the U.S. Championship. Yasser's accomplishments­ World Championship Candidate, four-time U.S. Champion, and U.S. Chess Hall of Farner-might have been even greater if he had more of an appetite\n\n19\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\nfor chess study. He liked to live well, and he tried to make things better for other players. Yasser's positional style was rather unique among his colleagues. Yasser rarely played in open tournaments, so our meetings were generally confined to the national championship. Because our games were so infrequent and our styles so different, I enjoyed these confrontations immensely. I could not keep up the spectacular level. Still, 4-3 and equal second with Sergey Kudrin and Perry Youngworth seemed okay for my first time out. Seirawan stormed back to take first and went on to win the World Junior that year. But he had to survive a losing position against Youngworth, who by all rights should have had that World Junior spot. How history would have changed!\n\nReady for the World I had a good consolation prize in the World Cadet (Under-17) Championship. The current World Youth system, with under 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 sections, would not exist for another decade. In those days the Cadet and the Junior (under 20) were the only international competitions. The USCF could not pay a fee for a coach, but Jeff Kastner agreed to second me for a free trip to France. Belfort 1979 had no shortage of talent, but young players had far fewer interna­ tional opportunities back then. Only a handful of players had FIDE ratings, so the pairings were done randomly! Thus it came to pass that I played future GMs Jo­ hann Hjartarson and Pia Cramling in the first two rounds. They were already known to be strong juniors; I was proud to beat them both.\n\nD J.Benjamin • P.Cramling World Cadet Cha m pionship, Belfort 1979 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 e6 3 C4 b6 4 Bf4 Bb7 s e3 Be7 6 h3 0-0 7 Bd3 ds 8 0-0 cs 9 NC3 Nc6 10 a3 dxc4 11 Bxc4 cxd4 12 exd4 Rc8 13 Ba2 Re8 14 Qd3 Bf8 1s Rad1 Ne7 16 Bes Neds 17 NgS g6 18 Qf3 (see following diagram) 18 ...Qd7? 19 Bxds 1-0 In the fourth round I ran into a stem-looking buzz-saw from the Soviet Union who wiped me off the board. The superior Soviet youth model won all his games with grim determination. Kastner tried to stare him down but could make no im­ pact. He seemed unstoppable ... until he started to change midway through the event. He joined our football games and even started to smile. And that opened the door for other players to win the Cadet. So Jaan Ehlvest didn't win, but he did\n\n20\n\nJunior Days later become a strong grandmaster...and an American!\n\nI piled up enough wins to claw my way to the lead with two rounds to go. Alas, I lost to Ivan Morovic (Chile) and Nigel Short in the last two rounds. Short tied for first but lost the tiebreak to an unheralded Argentinian, Marcelo Tempone. Kastner proved to be an excellent second. While the other players waited every day for the bus to the tournament, we were chauffeured in a private car, thanks to Jeff's friendship with the lovely. translator Francoise. Players themselves had few social opportunities; girls championships were played separately from boys in my junior days. Thus Pia Cramling especially stood out in the crowd and brought un­ expected pleasure to one opponent. One opponent came out of the hall with a big smile on his face. We were surprised to hear that he had lost. Then why was he smiling? \"I got to play footsy with her,\" he told us.\n\n1980 U.S. Junior, but I needed good fortune much like Seira­ wan the year before. I found myself a half-point behind the rail-thin Californian Doug Root going into the last round. I needed to beat Root to win the title and go I was favored in the\n\nto the World Junior. Though I stood better at adjournment, I could find little hope for a breakthrough. I resolved to maneuver about and test my opponent as best as I could. But upon resumption I struck gold right away.\n\nD J.Benjamin • D.Root U.S. J u n ior Cha mpionsh ip 1980 1 e4 e6 2 d4 ds 3 Nd2 Nf6 4 es Nfd7 s Bd3 cs 6 c3 b6 7 f4 Ba6 8 Bxa6 Nxa6 9 Ndf3 Nc7 10 Ne2 hS 11 Be3 c4 12 0-0 Be7 13 Qe1 bS 14 g3 Nb6 1S h3 Qd7 16 NgS as 17 g4 hxg4 18 hxg4 f6 19 Nf3 0-0-0 20 Kg2 Qe8 21 Qb1 Qg8 22 Ng3 Qh7 23 Rh1 Qxb1 24 Raxb1 b4 2s Bd2 b3 26 Ra1 Rxh1 27 Kxh1 RhB+ 28 Kg2 a4 29 a3 21\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\n29 ...

A few players joined me in double duty. In the Cadet I drew with the Chinese player Rongguang (I was surprised that anyone from China could play that well; things have certainly changed). The next week he was Mr. Ye, such is the confusion with Chinese names.\n\n22\n\nJunior Days The contest for first place came down to Valery Salov and Alon Greenfeld. I could not catch them but I decided the winner with my defeat of Greenfeld in the last round. It felt strange beating the Israeli player to give the Soviet the title, but it had to be done.\n\nI finished third.\n\nAt the U.S. Junior I made a pact with my best friend, Michael Wilder, that the winner would bring the other to the Worlds as his second. Everyone thought I might not be in the best hands with an eighteen-year-old second, and on the way to Dortmund I realized they had a point. When the train rolled over the German border and the border guards came to check passports, Michael could not find his. \"You cannot enter Germany without a passport,\" the guard told him. I thought we were in a bad movie. So we had to leave the train in Aachen. Or rather Michael did; I just questioned whether I would see him again if I didn't go with him. Michael arranged for tem­ porary papers, but we still had to catch another train. After waiting for hours, we met some nice people in the station. When their train pulled in, we said our good­ byes. Only after the train departed did we realize that it was our train, too! We spent the night in the station, mostly playing dozens of games of Scottish chess to kill time. My games in Dortmund were mostly forgettable. I lost yet again to Short and barely mustered a plus score. But I still had a great time because I had a front row seat for the Kasparov show. We all knew he was the class of the field, but the games really showed him to be a man among boys. I only wish that I could have gotten close enough to be paired with him. I had to be satisfied with facing the great one in blitz. Remember, we're back in the Soviet days. Kasparov was already great but he wasn't rich yet. He didn't mind taking a little hard currency from the other teenagers. I guess I should be honored that Kasparov refused to give me 5-2 time odds. We played a few games at 5-3. I lost two or three and drew one, as far as I can re­ member. I've never been so nervous playing blitz!\n\nMy junior career continued again in 1982. The 1981 U.S. Junior was smartly scheduled against the U.S. Championship. That not only meant no Junior title for me, it meant I couldn't go to the World Junior that year as well. Dlugy provided my main competition but I pulled ahead by winning our indi­ vidual game. I remember South Bend 1982 more for weird vibes than for the games. Animosity developed between Russian-born and American-born players. I remember Vadim Genfan burning a twenty-dollar bill to prove some kind of long­ forgotten point.\n\n23\n\nAmerican Grandmaster Midway through I beat a talented master named Bill Adam. Later he lost his will to compete. In the penultimate round he decided to allow the Fool's Mate. The director \"excused\" him from the last round. Adam was the same player who dumped his last few games in the 1981 National High School. Talented but trou­ bled, he would be found dead under mysterious circumstances while I was at the World Junior. I didn't know who to get to be my second in Copenhagen. We didn't have lots of grandmasters to choose from like we do now. I eventually tracked down John Fedorowicz in Florida. By the end of the tournament we were the best of friends, and we have worked together a lot since. The trip got off to a rocky start. No one came to meet us when we landed in Copenhagen, and we didn't know where the tournament was. \"I think it's some­ place that starts with an H,\" he said. He walked over to a map and found a place that seemed to qualify. There were about fifteen places that started with an \"H\". Still, we hopped on a train and went to this mysterious place. The front desk asked us if we were the missing swimmers. \"No, we're the missing chessplayers,\" Fed told them. By some miracle, we were in the right place.\n\nJohn Fedorowicz\n\nClose friends for more than twenty-five years, Fed and I have shared a lot of experiences over the years. In his youth he was often called \"Rocky\" for his resemblance to Sylvester Stallone. John's casual dress, Bronx accent, and frank manner of speaking have made him an icon in the chess world. Now known mostly for coaching and teaching, Fed's successful playing career includes a run through a Soviet gauntlet for first in the 1 989 New York Open. He is likely the strongest American-born player never to win the U.S. Championship, missing by an eyelash in 1987. Years ago, John matriculated at the French Culinary Institute in New York. Lacking the manual dexterity to \"tournage\" (basically turning a po­ tato into a football), he called it quits after six days. Looking over the manu­ script, I notice that Fi:d makes an appearance in most of the amusing anec­ dotes. He is like a brother to me, even though he roots for all the wrong sports teams. In the first round I played a player from Greece I was not familiar with. My oppo­ nent handled the Bayonet King's Indian a bit strangely for Black, but somewhere things went wrong for me and I lost. We sat down for the post-mortem and my opponent proclaimed \"I am an expert in the King's Indian.\" 24\n\nJunior Days That player, Efstratios Grivas, went on to become a respectable grandmaster. But that game illustrates a hard lesson we learned from these tournaments. Eve­ ryone is the best player in their country; even if no one else takes them seriously, they have enough confidence to make themselves dangerous. We didn't know the Sovjet representative either. Andrei Sokolov would make a name for himself later in the decade. He beat me and several other players as well, clinching first place before the last round.\n\nI made a run on the strength of a massive score with Black. One day Fed had to go into town to resolve his plane ticket. So I had to prepare for Alon Greenfeld on my own. In honor of my second, I chose the Polish-1 Nf3 bS!?.\n\n::::J A.Greenfeld • J.Benjamin World Junior Ch., Copenhagen 1982\n\n1 Nf3 bs 2 e4 Bb7 3 Bxbs Bxe4 4 o-o Nf6 s d4 e6 6 Nc3 Bb7 7 Qe2 Be7 8 Re1 o-o 9 Bd3 d6 10 NgS Nbd7 11 Bf4 cs 12 NbS Qb6 13 Rad1 a6 14 dxcs Qc6 lS Be4 Nxe4 16 Nd4 Nc3 17 Qg4 Qxg2+ 18 Qxg2 Bxg2 19 bxc3 Bds 20 cxd6 Bxgs 21 Bxgs f6 22 Bh4 Kf7\n\n23 NfS Bxa2 24 Ra1 Bc4 2S Ne7 es 26 Bg3 gS 27 h4 g4 28 Re3 Rfb8 29 Ra4 Be6 30 f4 gxf3 31 Rxf3 Rb6 32 NfS Bxfs 33 Rxfs Rxd6 34 Ras Ke6 3S Rf3 Rc8 36 Rd3 Rxd3 37 cxd3 Rxc3 38 Rxa6+ Kfs 0-1\n\nIn\n\nthe last round I played too recklessly against Stohl and lost, enabling him to\n\nleapfrog me for second.\n\nI\n\ncouldn't catch Sokolov, so I should have played to keep\n\nthe draw in hand. The impetuousness of youth! My third loss of the tournament with White dropped me into third place. I still finished ahead Short, Morovic, Curt Hansen, and Hjartarson.\n\n25\n\nof future\n\nGMs like\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\nI\n\nfinished my junior career in the 1983 U.S. Junior at the Manhattan Chess Club. I\n\nknew Dlugy would be my main competition. The pairings killed the climax as we battled to a draw in the first round. I suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Jona­ than Yedidia, but Dlugy dropped games to David Glueck and fourteen-year-old Patrick Wolff. I went into the last round with a half-point lead.\n\nI need a win over David Griego to clinch first, but ran into big trouble. While Dlugy won his game, I adjourned in a losing position. During the dinner break, Griego was approached by Dlugy's coach, Vitaly Zaltsman. Zaltsman, whose coaching fees were paid by the American Chess Foundation, wanted to analyze the adjournment with him! Now Griego had plenty of motivation for revenge.\n\nI\n\nhad beaten him in the last\n\nround of the National High School twice. But to his credit, he felt Zaltsman's ad­ vice wasn't proper. On his own, he didn't play well after resumption and I sal­ vaged a draw and a tie for first. The rules called for a playoff to determine who would go to the World Junior and get the automatic spot in the 1984 U.S. Championship.\n\nI\n\nwas sure to get a\n\nChampionship spot on rating, and I intended to play first board in the World Stu­ dent Team Championship instead of going to another World Junior. So I told Dlugy he could have the perks. I didn't realize the USCF would not recognize us as co-champions-another title we disagree on.\n\n26\n\nC h a pter Fou r\n\nBright College Years\n\nIn the fall of 1981 I matriculated at Yale University. My course load restricted the number of tournaments I could play in, but I did benefit from having a handy practice partner. My best friend, Michael Wilder, started at Yale the same year. The tons of blitz �ames we played produced a few ideas that I would work into my games over the years. In our freshman year, we occasionally got senior Mi­ chael Rohde to join our sessions. Wilder was not big on school spirit, but we did get him to play for the team in our junior year. We won the Pan-American Intercollegiate easily, concluding with a 4-0 whitewash of Columbia. Noting that his three teammates had all gone down\n\nin defeat (future U.S. Women's Champion Inna Izrailov and NM Greg Delia were our other players), my opponent, Mark Ginsburg, asked me if he could transfer. Then he spoiled a good position and lost, too. While that event was most directly related to my college years, it isn't the most memorable. That distinction goes to a match that came out of the blue and pro­ duced a result I could never have anticipated.\n\nIn the fall of 1983 Eric Schiller phoned me about a possible match with Nigel Short. The organizers of the Kasparov-Korchnoi and Smyslov-Ribli Candidates matches in London thought a side match might amuse the spectators, especially if the grandmasters decided to make a quick draw. I loved the challenge of taking on Short and watching those terrific matches. Unfortunately, I was a bit busy at the time. The match would take me away for more than a week during the semester. I couldn't afford to miss all that work and pass my classes. I could only play this match if I could convince my dean to ar­ range incompletes for my classes and let me make up the work later. Dean Mary Ramsbottom showed an appreciation for life experiences and granted my request.\n\n27\n\nAmerican Grandmaster In\n\n1983 Nigel and I were two of the highest rated young IMs in the world. We\n\nwere both rated about 2480. He was objectively closer to the grandmaster title and a slight favorite on paper. While I had been looking forward to the match for weeks, Nigel arrived in London tired from another tournament abroad. Worse yet, he said he didn't know about the match. With me already there, he could hardly decline to go through with it. Thad Rogers flew out from America for the admittedly unchallenging job of match arbiter. A certain young British arbiter seemed to feel she should have had the assignment. I found Sophia Gorman to be a bit pushy then.\n\nIn a\n\nfew years she\n\nwould be married to Michael Rohde, and years after that would become my boss. On the first day the headliners finished early, or seemed primed to do so, I can't remember which. Ray Keene rushed into our room (nicknamed the \"cup­ board\") and told us we could not draw and had to play on.\n\nD J.Benjamin • N.Short London (match) 1983\n\nI can't remember if Nigel had offered a draw, but I know I had no intention of tak­ ing it.

The British media was a bit taken aback. During the match Leonard Barden phoned my hosts, the King family (as in future GM Daniel King) and asked Mrs. King, \"What are you feeding him?\"\n\nCollege probably delayed my grandmaster title for a few years. I came dose to a GM norm in an International organized by Goichberg in 1982. I beat two GMs (Shamkovich and Soltis) but I couldn't get the one win I needed in the last two rounds. The 1981, 1983, and 1984 U.S. Championships were held in the summer and didn't conflict with my studies. When the Championship moved to the fall, I had my B.A. in history in hand and was ready to begin life as a chess professional.\n\n31\n\nC h a pter Five\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Cham pionshi p : 1 9 8 1 - 1 9 9 6 Only Walter Browne has played in more U.S. Championships than I have. My to­ tal of 23 came consecutively, from 1 981 -2006. There has certainly been an ebb and flow, but I've produced a lot of good results over this long span of time. Of all my accomplishments in chess, I am most proud of my record in U.S. Championships.\n\n1981 South Bend I made my first appearance in South Bend 1981. I had to qualify by rating (the Jun­ ior Champion was not seeded in zonal years); fortunately DeFirmian and John Grefe declined and opened the door for me. I wanted to make a good showing but worried about being accepted by the older guys. When my parents asked if they could go with me, I told them an emphatic no. \"The guys will laugh at me.\" I lost a bunch of games and finished ahead of just two players but I took great pride from my wins over Walter Browne, Larry Christiansen, and Boris Kogan.\n\nD J.Benjamin • W.Browne U.S. Championship, South Bend 1981 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 e6 3 C4 b6 4 a3 cs 5 dS Ba6 The Benoni treatment of the a3-Queen' s Indian was all the rage in the early 80's.

When Browne notched the last point against Fedorowicz, he stood up and exclaimed, \"Thank the gods.\" 1981 was a last gasp for many players of a bygone generation. Sammy Re­ shevsky and Leonid Shamkovich would not return to the field again. Robert Byrne, a fine gentleman and friend to me for years since, would make but one more appearance. Anatoly Lein qualified for a few more in the 80's. Larry Evans played in his last U.S. Championship . . . sort of. Evans lost his first two games to Byrne and Lein. He then claimed to be too ill to continue. Since he had played less than half his games, the games did not count for the standings. Lein was furious, but Byrne philosophical. \"Easy come, easy go,\" he said. [In South Bend, Byrne said something so funny at dinner that everyone spit up their salads .. .including Bob!] The old codgers could be pretty amusing. Reshevsky often used an old-style phrase to propose a draw. When he posed the question \"Do you play for a win?\", Lein responded with a mixture of anger and confusion: \"Should I play for a loss?\" An argument ensued and voices were raised, particularly Lein's. A few feet away Shamkovich shook his head in frustration. Mild-mannered and often befuddled, Shamkovich was not prone to angry outbursts. But he had reached his limit. Still looking at his position, Shamkovich spoke in a voice barely above a whisper. \"Mr. Lein... shut up!\"\n\n1983 Greenville The USCF could not find funding for the Championship in 1982. They held a low­ budget tournament at Thiel College in Greenville, Pa. The players had to bunk in dormitories instead of hotel rooms. Since I was a college student at the time, this didn't perturb me. But Seirawan objected, and in a fight with the USCF that would play out many times, declined his invitation. By 1983, I was already one of the highest rated players and felt ready to make a splash. I jumped out to the lead with three wins over DeFirmian, Kudrin, and Jay Whitehead. Then Roman Dzindzichashvili sent me crashing back down to earth. The assistant arbiter made a crack about me being \"crushed like a chicken\", which the media naturally seized on in a rare chess report. With Browne in the last round, I had a chance to impact the title. I was proud of the fighting draw that left Browne tied with Christiansen and Dzindzi for top honors. After this success Browne decided he wanted to be referred to as \"Six­ Time Champion Walter Browne\". It was propitious timing, as Walter never needed to change the appellation, and was nicknamed \"Six-time\" for years.\n\n36\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981 -1996 In the end I\n\nmanaged +1 and a tie for fifth place.\n\nI\n\nparticularly liked my win\n\nover 1981 U.S. Junior Champion Whitehead, because my speculative sacrifice shows the confidence I felt at the time.\n\nD J.Whitehead • J.Benjamin U.S. Championsh ip, G reenvi lle 1983 1 d4 Nf6 2 C4 cs 3 ds bs 4 Nd2 One of those anti-Benko systems that enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame.\n\n4...d6 S e4 bxc4 6 Bxc4 g6 7 b3 Bg7 8 Bb2 0-0 9 Ngf3 esl? 10 dxe6 fxe6 11 es?!

Kamran Shirazi's historic futility- one draw and sixteen losses - certainly stood out. With point money for the lower places, his haul of $37.50 could easily be spent in one place (and he was suspected to have lost lots more than that gambling during the event). While Shirazi's five-move loss to Peters (1 e4 cS 2 b4 cxb4 3 a3 dS 4 exdS QxdS 5 axb4?? Qe5+ 0-1) grabbed attention, the players most appreciated the comedic value of the following game. White stumbles on move six and digs a deeper grave with each move as he tries to hold on to everything.\n\n38\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981 -1996\n\nD K.Shirazi • J.Benjamin\n\nU.S. Championship, Berkeley 1984 1 d4 Nf6 2 e4 e6 3 Nf3 b6 4 g3 Ba6 5 b3 Bb4+ 6 Nbd2 Be3 7 Rb1 Bb7 8 Bb2 Ne4 9 Rg1 Qf6 10 Bel Ne6 11 e3 Nb4 12 Rb2\n\nAt this point Dzindzi and Christiansen were cackling so hard they had to leave the room. Dzindzi offered a clever prediction: \"Next move he will play Rg2, fi­ anchettoing the other rook!\" As pleasant as Shirazi's immobility is, I cash it in for an exchange and two pawns.\n\n12... es 13 Be2 exd4 14 exd4 Nxf2 15 Kxf2 Bxd4+ 16 Kg2 Bxb2 17 a3 Bxe1 18 Qxe1 Na6 19 b4 o-o 20 Bd3 Raes 21 Qb1 h6 22 Bh7+ Kh8 2 3 Be4 d5 24 exd5 Bxd5 25 Bxd5 exd5 26 Qd3 Ne7 27 Rf1 Ne6 28 Qxd5 Rfd8 29 Qe4 Ng5 30 Qb1 Qe6 31 Qe1 Rd3 32 h4 Re8 33 Qxe8+ Qxe8 34 hxgs hxgs 35 Rf2 f6 36 g4 Qe6 37 Nh2 Rxa3 0-1 Lev Alburt scored 12Vz-4Vz to win the first of three titles, while DeFirmian took second with 11-6. Their results turned out to be successful auditions for the Olympic team. I had been higher rated than both of them, but they leapfrogged ahead of me for the Olympic team (see Chapter 17 for more about that). Maxim Dlugy won a playoff over Tarjan and Fedorowicz for the last Interzonal spot. My score was quite respectable, but seeing a younger player finish ahead of me provided a shock to my system. I was determined to garner a top place in 1985.\n\n39\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\n1985 Estes Park The Championship moved to Estes Park, Colorado for the next three years. The inspiration for Stephen King's horror classic\n\nThe Shining,\n\nthe Stanley Hotel proved\n\nespecially hospitable for me. Shortly before the 1985 Championship, FIDE changed the rules to permit title norms in national championships (they had not counted before because all the players are from the same federation). I had been close to GM norms while in college. With my studies no longer a distraction, I be­ came obsessed with the title. Getting to the magic +5 score meant more to me than my final standing. The field contained a few players that\n\nI circled as guys I wanted to beat. I took\n\ndown Vince McCambridge, Shirazi, Kudrin, and Dmitry Gurevich without a loss. In the penultimate round I targeted Junior champ Patrick Wolff for termination, but could only draw. In other years I might have been on the way to first place, but Lev Alburt was defending his title with great gusto. I had the last chance to catch him, but my pri­ orities as they were, I took a quick draw. Solidly in second place, the norm would be mine if I could defeat six-time champ Walter Browne.\n\nD W.Browne • J.Benjamin U.S. Championship, Estes Park 1985 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 b6 4 a3 cs s ds Ba6 6 Qc2 exds 7 cxds g6 B Nc3 Bg7 9 g3 o-o 10 Bg2 d6 11 0-0 ReB 12 Re1 12 Bf4 was my choice against Browne in South Bend, but 12 . . .

The winning plan involves making passed pawns on both wings 40 .. .£6 41 gxf6 Kf7 etc. White would also lose without 40 gS - B lack's king march to support the b-pawn would draw White's king out, whereupon Black eats the g3-pawn and pushes his h-pawn.\n\n1986 Estes Park In 1 986, my ultimate goal was not to win, but this time to qualify for the 1987 In­ terzonals. 1985 had gone almost according to script, but 1 986 dealt me stinging losses. I could hardly believe I lost to Shirazi, who had always been a punching bag for me (about twenty-five wins to two losses lifetime). Losing to Lein, already an elder statesman then, hurt a lot, too. But I strung together enough wins to tie for second. I had a nice queenless attack against Kogan, a long endgame win over Rohde, a quick counterattack against Gurevich, and a successful novelty against DeFirmian. I turned the tide against Lev Alburt, who had taken our first six deci­ sions. From this time on, I beat Alburt with consistency. I could share any of those games, but the luckiest of my wins was in many ways the most interesting. Maxim Dlugy had been my rival since our junior days, and the\n\n42\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981-1996 rivalry stayed strong into our professional careers. Max was an excellent defender and counter puncher. I would typically come out swinging, attack unsoundly, and find myself in a lost position with my flag hanging. Max would then get excited, blitz his moves out wildly and hang things. I lost my share of games to Dlugy, but my own time pressure was a shockingly effective weapon for me.\n\nCJ J.Benjamin • M.Dlugy\n\nU.S. Championship, Estes Park 1986 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 Nf3 a6 4 e3 Nf6 5 Bxc4 e6 6 o-o cs 7 a4 Nc6 8 Qe2 Qc7 9 Nc3 Be7 10 Rd1 0-0 11 b3 Rd8 12 Bb2 Nb4 13 dxcs Bd7 14 e4 Bc6 15 Rd6 Nd7 16 Nd5?!\n\nThis looked tempting but there's no follow-up.\n\n16 ... exds 17 exd5 Bxd6 18 cxd6 Qxd6 19 dxc6 bxc6 20 Nh4 Qf4 21 g3 Qg5 22 f4 Qc5+ 2 3 Kh1 Nd5 24 Nfs N7f6 2 5 Nxg7 More fuel for the fire.\n\n2s ...

With two outs in the bottom of the tenth in game six, I turned to Fed and shook my head. \"I can't believe we lost to the Red Sox,\" I said. \"It ain't over,\" the wise man replied. Of course, a few batters and one ground ball through Buckner's legs later, the Mets had staved off elimination. [Bronx-born Fed now hates the Mets as much as\n\nI despise the Yankees.]\n\nChristiansen refused to join us at Lonnigan' s for game seven, preferring the solitude of the \"Mountain Man\" establishment. \"The Mets are going to win, and I\n\n· can't\n\nstand the thought of you guys jumping up and down,\" he told us.\n\n1987 Estes Park With the Szirak Interzonal already behind me, I focused on winning the title in 1987. I was as bulletproof as in 1985, but wins were especially hard to come by. Coming down the stretch, I waited in the wings at + 1, with only a win over Gure­ vich. This tournament certainly did not go according to plan. The path to the title went through the top rated tournament leaders, beginning with Yasser.\n\nD V.Seirawan • J.Benjamin U.S. Cham pionship, Estes Park 1987 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 g3 Bb4+ 4 Bd2 Qe7 5 Nc3 Bxc3 \"Joel doesn't understand timing in chess,\" wrote Yasser in his then fledgling magazine,\n\nInside Chess.\n\nI think the many dozens of times this maneuver has subse­\n\nquently been carried out in tournament practice suggests my understanding has been underestimated. The reasoning is thus: The b4-bishop is \"doomed\" to ex­ changing itself for a knight; if Black waits for White to castle, he will have to play against the bishop pair. My exchanging combination prevents that situation from occurring.\n\n6 Bxc3 Ne4 7 Qc2 Nxc3 8 Qxc3 o-o 9 Bg2 d6 10 Nf3 Re8\n\n44\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981 -1996 10 ... eS? 11 dxeS Re8 12 0-0-0! is clearly better for White; but 10 ...

In the last round\n\nI had to face Christiansen with Black while\n\nNick took on Wilder. They drew rather quickly and both repaired to the bar for an early celebration. Larry was mired in the middle of the pack, but was still deter­ mined to win. After a moderate struggle, we agreed to a draw anyway. Fed had a chance to make it a threesome with a win over Browne, but Walter defended in his usual tenacious manner and held a draw.\n\n46\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981-1996 Nick's victory began a trend that happened with surprising frequency in U.S. Championships. He went from worst in '86 to first in '87. Nick had begun a transi­ tion into a more solid, professional style where time pressure no longer crippled his results. He went on to an impressive record in U.S. Championships. I had broken through for my first U.S. title at age 23. Given my three-year suc­ cess in Estes Park and age advantage on my rivals, I could be forgiven for thinking future titles would come in bunches. But a lot of changes were brewing. The first was engendered by a night of overly enthusiastic celebration on the last night leading to changes in the status of various relationships. While I am happy to share stories, those events will have to \"stay in Estes Park\". I'll just report that a guest of one of the players caused damage to th� hotel that led to our eviction from the idyllic mountain town. New contenders from abroad would emerge to challenge my core group of friends for supremacy. We would not play alongside the Women's Championship again until 1995. And I was headed for a slump in this tournament that lasted (ex­ cepting '91 and '94) for ten years.\n\n1988 Cambridge Springs In\n\nthe midst of one of their recurring financial crises, the USCF reduced the field\n\nto ten to cut costs. The scene shifted to historic Cambridge Springs, Pa. Known for the 1904 tournament that produced the eponymous variation in the Queen's Gambit, the old resort town had sunk to depressing standards by 1988. There was nothing to do there, and nobody to watch us play. Conflicts with the German league (Bundesliga) caused Larry Christiansen to miss his first U.S. Championship since I began playing. Larry sure picked the right year to sit out! I'll never lose the image of Doc Crenshaw operating the demo boards for an empty room. Craig Crenshaw was one of the great friends and fans of the U.S. Championship. For many years he donated prizes for special games in the Cham­ pionship. After witnessing Diesen drop out in 1980 and Evans in 1981, Dr. Crenshaw proposed switching the order of the pairings to equalize colors should a player have to drop out again (naturally it never happened again). The \"Crenshaw System\" at least enriched the chess vernacular; dropping out of a tournament became known as \"crenshawing\" .\n\nEarly in the tournament, DeFirmian beat Tony Miles with a piece sacrifice in the Pribyl Defense.\n\n47\n\nAmerican Grandmaster D N.De Firmian • A.Miles U.S. Championship, Cambridge Springs 1988 1 e4 d6 2 d4 Nf6 3 Nc3 c6 4 f4 Qast? s Bd3 es 6 Nf3 Bg4 7 dxes dxes 8 fxes Nfd7 9 Bf4 Bb4 10 o-o o-o 11 Nds!?

We were protesting not just the miserable or­ ganization but the presence of Miles in the tournament. Frustrated with the British Chess Federation, Miles had decided to switch his nationality for the right condi­ tions. The USCF, prodded by the ACF (American Chess Foundation), invited Miles to the 1988 U.S. Championship. Tony fulfilled his residency requirement with the post office box of the ACF. What makes a player American enough to play in the U.S. Championship has been a major issue for the last three decades. At times we have had a three-year residency requirement; currently it is one-year. But everyone now agrees genuine residency (citizenship or green card) is essential. What Miles was allowed to do for two years embarrassed our Federation and disrespected our players.\n\n48\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981 -1996 Tony had not gotten his head straight and finished on bottom. Wins proved even tougher to come by than the year before. The winning score shrunk again to +2 for the surprise winner, Michael Wilder. An especially gifted tactician, Mike never had full faith in either his own abilities or the viability of chess as a profes­ sion. He closed out a brief three-year Championship stint on top, having already decided to attend law school in the fall of 1989. He never looked back; in the last sixteen years he has played virtually no competitive chess. Michael Wilder\n\nMike and I have been buddies since the 1 975 Atlantic open where we shared the prize for second in class \"A\". We both embarked on pro careers after graduating from Yale, but Mike didn't put it all together until his surprise win in the 1988 U.S. Championship. Despite a solid result in the 1989 Han­ inge International, Mike stuck to his guns and retired from chess in favor of a career in law. He managed to quit cold turkey, too -he has not played a rated game since. A brilliant combinational player, Mike is also one of the funniest guys I've ever met. Read one of his \"Agony\" columns and know that he is that entertaining all the time.\n\n1989 Long Beach Thanks to major sponsorship from Les Crane and his Software Toolworks com­ pany, the field was restored to sixteen in another zonal year. Long Beach provided a less depressing backdrop and big city spectators made us feel more at home. Another surprise winner emerged in U.S. Junior Champion Stuart Rachels. A one­ time holder of the youngest U.S. master record, Rachels never intended for chess to be a professional career, and this result didn't change his mind. Rachels actually inspired Frank Samford Jr. to endow his annual fellowship for a young out­ standing professional. Seirawan and Dzindzi also tied for first. I had my ups and downs; .a horrible blunder against Dlugy nearly wrecked my chances but I managed to finish in a three-way tie for the last two Interzonal spots with Miles and DeFirmian. The next May we got down to settling the tie in a playoff, and I became the odd man out. After losing to Miles in the zonal and the playoff, and watching him take a cov­ eted American slot, you can imagine how bitter I felt. Then the ACF successfully petitioned FIDE for an Interzonal spot for Gata KamsKy, who hadn't even played in the zonal. If the Manila Interzonal had been on TV, I wouldn't have watched.\n\n49\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\n1990 Jacksonville Jacksonville 1990 experimented with a sixteen-player knockout.

Just when the natives had taken measure of his Alekhine's Defense, Alburt mastered his opponents with the totally unex­ pected Pirc Defense. GM Alexander Chemin came to Jacksonville to give a well-paid but very poorly attended simul. Somehow, his six or seven opponents stressed him so much that he decided to sit out the U.S. Open. Instead he spent his days teaching Alburt the finer points of Chernin's favorite defense. Christiansen took an unexpected pounding in the final. Nick DeFirmian, Al­ burt's victim in the semi-finals, had a string of eight U.S. Championships in a row, but took the next three years off to work in the financial industry. This coinciden­ tally removed another competitor for my consecutive streak.\n\n52\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981 -1996\n\n1991 Los Angeles The Los Angeles airport area hosted the first U.S. Championship covered by\n\nChow.\n\nChess\n\nNow sixteen and top-rated, Gata Kamsky fulfilled expectations and cleaned\n\nout his side 0£ the bracket.\n\n·\n\nI won my first match against Dzindzi cleanly and sweated out a marathon against Seirawan.

Unfortunately, you cannot separate the chess from the atmosphere of paranoia and intimidation created by Gata's father Rustam. A large and threatening individual, Rustam employed strong-arm tactics to aid his son's cause. During the Fedorowicz-Kamsky semi-final match, Rustam noticed Fed brushed past DeFirmian and went ballistic, insisting they had discussed the game. Rustam's approach could be unorthodox. He would occasionally pay people to follow \"suspicious\" individuals. Fortunately, the venerable Doc Crenshaw took it\n\nin stride when a Kamsky flunky followed him to the bathroom. In the first of the four-game match, Kamsky surprised me with the Marshall Attack and obtained a crushing position. I battled back to a drawish endgame but saw my position go gradually downhill.

The round­ robin is an easier format for determining Interzonal qualifiers, but the knockout had been a disappointment to the players anyway. At the time the USCF paid ho­ tel and travel expenses for the players. The USCF didn't have to pay hotel costs for players once they were eliminated. The players had expected the USCF to invest the savings in the prize fund, but somehow an increase never materialized. The tournament returned to a quiet Colorado mountain town, this time Du­ rango. An autumn blizzard enhanced the lower profile created by the absence of familiar names. Christiansen (Bundesliga responsibilities), DeFirmian (working in .finance), Dlugy (embarking on an investment career), and Rohde (law school) joined defending champ Kamsky on the sidelines.\n\nIn their place a young group\n\nconsisting of 1989 Champion Rachels, Ilya Gurevich, Wolff, and Alex Sherzer had a shot at the limelight. The best American players to emerge since Wilder, Benja­ min and Dlugy, these players accomplished much (only Rachels, who had the shortest career, did not make grandmaster) but did not commit to pro careers. The battle for first_place unexpectedly came down to 23-year-old Wolff and 22year-old Sherzer. Both players fattened up on the last six players in the cross-table. Going into the last round, Sherzer head a half-point lead but had to face Fe­ dorowicz with . White. Fed had some chances for an Interzonal spot; more than that, his pride motivated him to win the game. I think my colleagues would agree that Wolff was a nice guy, but he had a habit of rubbing people the wrong way. When Dzindzi forgot to hit his clock in the 1989 Championship, Patrick sat on an obvious recapture fifteen minutes. In Durango Patrick offered Ilya a draw in a losing position. So there was a lot of popular sentiment for Alex on that last day. The Jan-Feb\n\nChess Chow\n\ncover depicted the position where Sherzer missed his\n\nopportunity. Sherzer's loss allowed Wolff to cap off a tremendous result by de­ feating Boris Men, the tournament enigma. A former Soviet Junior Champion, Men had not played outside of Ohio since his emigration and did not have a FIDE rating. He stunned the crowd by opening with two wins . . . but lost his last five. Sherzer's loss dropped him into a tie for second with Gulko. Wolff took his first U.S. Championship with a stellar 10V2-41/z, a long way from the other end of the tournament. Kamran Shirazi regained his form from 1984. He managed to notch thirteen consecutive goose eggs before drawing his last two (Yermo was fed\n\n58\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981-1996 up while Dmitry clinched an Interzonal spot). Shirazi created a fair bit of drama on the way to his remarkable score. He lost a completely won position to Wolff in round three. As the tournament wore on he seemed to play with a certain death wish. He achieved inferior but drawable end­ garnes against Sherzer and Gulko. Shirazi mysteriously eschewed threefold repeti­ tion and overstepped a few moves later - in both games! One could certainly ad­ mire his spirit. Midway through the event Shirazi inquired about the GM norm ­ though it was already mathematically out of reach for him.\n\nI finished +1 against the field but -4 against the top half. I lost to two kinds of Gurevich. Ilya has always given me fits (and their other \"brother\" Mikhail for that matter), but Dmitry I would beat sure as the sun would rise in the morning. I had 8-0 (plus draws) against him with wins in the 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989 Champion­ ships. For that matter, I would lose to him the next year and in 1995 as well. My game with Alexander Ivanov, which included one uf my all-time favorite moves, provided the lone bright spot.\n\nD A.Ivanov • J.Benjamin U.S. Championship, Durango 1992 1 e4 es 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6 4 Qe2 Ivanov had lost to Sherzer in the Berlin Defense (4 0-0 N'xe4) in the first round, so he protects his center pawn this time.\n\n4...a6 5 Bxc6 dxc6 6 b3 Bd6 7 Bb2 Qe7 8 d3 Bg4 9 Nbd2 Nd7 10 h3 BhS 11 g4 Bg6 12 d4 o-o-o 13 o-o-o RheB 14 dxes NxeS 15 Ne1 f6 16 Ng2 Bb4 17 Nb1\n\n17...Nf3!1 This just might b e my favorite move o f m y career.

Most of the\n\nkids were gone, replaced by powerful immigrants. Kamsky returned after a year's absence but could not duplicate his success [Rustam was relatively restrained] . Gregory Kaidanov showed his mettle i n his first U.S. Championship, but i t was another newcomer, Alexander Shabalov, who tied for first with another dominant\n\n60\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981 -1996 entrant of the nineties, Alex Yerrnolinsky. Wolff nearly went first to worst, one point out of the cellar. I lost four games\n\nj\n\nand kept Patrick company n the cross-table. Boris Gulko went winless and occu­ pied the cellar.\n\n1994 Key West Sunny Key West seemed to have a hypnotic effect on the players. Time forfeits came in bunches, with tail-ender Alexander Ivanov the chief offender. My two losses (DeFirrnian, Christiansen) came on time, and the clock claimed my first\n\nthree victims (Seirawan, Finegold, and Ivanov. Though the games were decided anyway - except for Ivanov, who essentially fell asleep - it was still pretty weird. Ironically, my only win on the board came against notorious time pressure addict Walter Browne.\n\nD W.Browne • J.Benjamin U.S. Championship, Key West 1994 1 d4 d6 2 e4 Nf6 3 Nc3 c6 The Pribyl Defense was a big weapon for me in the mid-nineties.\n\n4 Nf3 Bg4 5 Be2 e6 6 h3 Bhs 7 0-0 Be7 8 Be3 Nbd7 8 .. 0-0 is often played to ensure a retreat square for the f6-knight, but I antici­ .\n\npated White's continuation and felt I might not want to castle at all.\n\n9 g4 Bg6 10 Nd2 dS 11 f3 White doesn't want to waste a tempo, but after 1 1 eS Ne4 12 Ncxe4 dxe4 the e4-pawn is difficult to scoop up.\n\n11 Qc7 ...\n\n61\n\nAmerican Grandmaster Black's plan is hard to punctuate.

But in view of 18 Kf2! Rxg4 19 Ne2, the alter­ nate move order 16 . . . Rg3+ 17 Kh2 Bxc2! should be preferred. After 18 Qe2 Bd3 19 Qdl, Black can either take the repetition (19 . . .

Nd31 Highly aesthetic,_but rather simple for Browne to miss.\n\n19 Rf3 Qh2+ 20 Kf1 Nxb2\n\n'\n\nThe knight won't survive, but it buys time for Black to crash through White's defenses.\n\n21 Qb1 Bxfs 22 Nf2 Bh3+ 23 Rxh3 Rxh3 24 Qxb2 Rxe3 25 Qxb7 Rd8 26 Bc4 Kf8 27 Qxc6 Qf4 28 Rdl Rf3 0-1 With a minute left on his clock, Browne resigned.\n\nUntil Key West Boris Gulko had been a bit of a Championship bust, managing no better than equal second in Durango '92. In 1994 Gulko went from the outhouse to the penthouse. When early leaders Seirawan and Christiansen faltered, Gulko had\n\nhis first title in America. As in 1989, I tied for an Interzonal spot with Yermolinsky and Shabalov. In­ stead of six months of purgatory before a slow playoff, we settled the score with an immediate rapid contest. This time the playoff was held immediately and I\n\nwon convincingly.\n\n1995 Modesto When the 1995 Championship came around, I was looking ahead to working with Deep Blue. I was in the midst of a downturn, and Modesto was not the cheeriest site. We experienced an oft overlooked hotel problem; they forgot chess tourna­ ments need quiet, and scheduled a wedding adjacent to the playing hall. Walter Browne learned from last year and spanked me when I naively re­ peated the opening. My game with Gulko was the low point- I was lost after my sixth move.\n\n63\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\nD B.Gulko • J.Benjamin U.S. Championship, Modesto 1995 1 c4 es 2 Nc3 d6 3 g3 g6 4 d4 exd4 5 Qxd4 Nf6 6 Bg2 Nc6??\n\n7 Bxc6+ bxc6 8 Bg5 Be7 8 . .

DeFirmian and Wolff also tied for first, with Wolff winning the playoff for the ring. Wolff's effort was aided by a most remarkable swindle.\n\nD P.Wolff • W.Browne Championship, Modesto 1995\n\nU.S.\n\n(see following diagram) Wolff has just secured a draw with\n\n55 h3+, but Browne found another result:\n\n55 ... Kf5?? 56 Rh61 Now Black can only avert mate by parting with his rook.\n\n56 ... g4 57 hxg4+ 1-0 Modesto would be the last Championship where the USCF paid expenses for the\n\n64\n\nIron Man of the U.S. Championship: 1981-1996 players. The players. would be compensated with higher prizes; the larger prize fund would sound more impressive to media and possible sponsors. The Women's Championship returned alongside the men for the first time since Estes Park.\n\nIn\n\nthe convivial atmosphere young stars like Jennie Frenklakh,\n\nAnna Hahn and Irina Krush (and Jennifer Shahade the next year) benefited from the wisdom of the men.\n\n1996 Parsippany The Parsippany (New Jersey) Hilton has always served as a great site for the U.S. Amateur Team East. But what works for a weekender doesn't work for a two­ week event. Chessplayers are notorious non-drivers (I didn't get a license until I was 42; Fed still doesn't have one). Anyone without a car suffered; we couldn't even make it to the highway on foot. The restaurant didn't offer a lot of food op­ tions either. It didn't take long for us all to go stir crazy. I don't know if there is a correlation, but the bored natives (Benjamin, Orristiansen, DeFirmian) all finished well out of contention. Yermolinsky, in the middle of a great career run, took first place. For me, the chess was even more miserable. I played hard but could not con­ vert a number of winning opportunities. You could look at the cross-table and conclude from my ten draws that I wasn' t trying very hard.\n\nChampionship, 1 845-1996,\n\nIn The United States\n\nGM Andy Soltis suggested I was trying to repeat my\n\n1987 strategy of a few wins and a lot of draws. True, I drew ten games, but they were all fights until the last two rounds, when my tank had emptied out. Look at the games instead of the cross-table and you understand I didn't want all those draws. My game with Gulko certainly smacks of manliness.\n\n65\n\nAmerican Grandmaster\n\nD B.Gulko • J.Benjamin U.S. Championsh ip, Parsippa ny 1996 1 d4 d6 2 e4 Nf6 3 f3 es 4 ds Nxe4!?\n\nHow often do you see a piece sac on move four?\n\ns fxe4 Qh4+ 6 Kd2 Qxe4 7 Qf3 Qg6 8 Qg3 Be7 9 Nc3 fs 10 Qxg6+ hxg6 11 Nh3 Nd7 12 Ke1 c6 13 a4 Nb6 14 dxc6 bxc6 1S as Nd7 16 b4 a6 17 Na4 dS 18 c3 RbS 19 Be3 d4 20 cxd4 Bxb4+ 21 Bd2 Rh4 22 dxes Re4+ 23 Be2 Bxd2+ 24 Kxd2 Rbb4 2S Nc3 Rb2+ 26 Kc1 Rexe2 27 Nxe2 Rxe2 28 Nf4 Rxes 29 Nxg6 Res+ 30 Kd2 Kf7 31 Nf4 gs 32 Nd3 RdS 33 Rhc1 Nes 34 Ra3??\n\n34 Rc3 is level.\n\n34 Nxd3?? ..•\n\n34 . . . £4! would set up the decisive threat of . . .

The organizers provided an extra room in the hotel for the players to congregate for conversation, analysis, food and drink. It would be a required condition for the next four years.\n\nIn 1996 I set the record with my fifteenth consecutive Championship appear­ ance. The closing ceremony celebrated this mark while mourning the passing of the Championship's biggest fan, Craig Crenshaw. In concluding his Champion­ ship history, Soltis saw this era coming to an end: \"The generation that dominated U.S. Chess for 15 years was ready to give way to the Tal Shakeds of the future.\""
