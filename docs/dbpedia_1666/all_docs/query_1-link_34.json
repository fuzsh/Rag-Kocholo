        "text": "I heard an almighty mechanical howl, and looked around to see a Katana 1100 screaming up the road with its front wheel at 11 o’clock MANY READERS OLD enough to be around during the early 1980s will remember the first time they saw a Suzuki Katana, I certainly do. Back in the pre-digital age you couldn’t just google something to find out more, you needed to search high and low for information. A friend’s older brother showed me a photo of one in a magazine, I’m guessing it was circa 1981. I jumped on my trusty pushbike and dropped by another mate’s house so we could make the long trek to the only newsagency in the area. By the time we arrived I’d forgotten the name, however, one mag had the…\n\nKAWASAKI WILL REVIVE the legendary Z900 moniker on an all-new retro-styled nakedbike which might even be supercharged to give it superbike levels of performance. The firm has recently applied for a trademark on the name Z900RS, and at the same time our sources in Japan revealed that the company was looking to cash in on the recent boom in retro-inspired bikes typified by Yamaha’s ‘Sport Heritage’ machines like the XSR900. The schedule is to have the new bike on sale in two years’ time, but the really tempting element is that it could also be supercharged as part of Kawasaki’s thrust into the realm of forced-induction. The evidence for the new Z900RS being supercharged is circumstantial but persuasive. The name itself tells us a couple of things. First is that it’s plundering…\n\nPicture this The main image was created using all of this information and drawing on the original Z900 (Z1) for inspiration when it comes to styling. A second image has been created to show how the same mechanical elements could be used to create a Z1000-style modernist nakedbike, which could also be introduced to give a wider appeal while sharing as many components as possible with the retro model. The legend It’s been 44 years since the Kawasaki Z1 900 wowed show-goers at the 1972 Cologne motorcycle expo in Germany. It was first released as a production model in 1973 in response to Honda’s popular CB750 Super Four which had been making performance and sales waves since its 1971 release. A hugely important model for Kawasaki, and one that resonated so well with…\n\nA NEW PATENT from Honda hints that the firm could have plans for a new road-going single-cylinder sportsbike inspired by its 250cc Moto3 racer. The patent is notable because it suggests a variety of different exhaust layouts for the unusual engine packaging used by Honda’s NSF250RW racer. Unlike normal bikes, the Honda racer uses a reverse-cylinder engine, with the intake at the front and the exhaust port at the rear. It also has a cylinder that tilts backwards rather than forwards. While not unprecedented – Yamaha’s motocross models share a similar layout and BMW’s new G310R has now brought reverse-cylinder singles to the road-going market – the design is unusual enough to make it worthwhile patenting variations on the layout. In particular, Honda’s new patent focuses on the problem of making the…\n\nWE’VE ALREADY brought you spy pictures of KTM’s new Duke 890 parallel twin nakedbike (AMCN Vol 65 No 17) but the firm’s latest annual report confirms the project and reveals it contains some interesting technology. As part of the summary of the firm’s R&D projects, KTM lists “development of a new motorcycle platform based on a revolutionary two-cylinder engine design, which will make a substantial contribution toward opening up new market segments” as one of its projects. There’s no clue given to what will make the new twin revolutionary. Spy shots of the bike show that it’s a parallel twin, believed to be around 800cc and likely to carry the name Duke 890 when it’s officially revealed. The same engine is sure to find its way into an adventure model as well,…\n\nHUSQVARNA’S OWNERS AT KTM have confirmed that the firm’s Svartpilen and Vitpilen concept bikes will reach production in several different forms with the first variants arriving in showrooms as early as next year. The first two machines will both be Vitpilen models – naked, café-racer styled machines – but the scrambler-influenced Svartpilen is also confirmed for production as part of a plan to build Husqvarna into Europe’s third-largest motorcycle maker behind KTM and BMW by 2020. So far Husqvarna has shown two Vitpilen concept bikes – the 401 and 701 – as well as the Svartpilen 401. The ‘401’ machines are basically restyled KTM Duke 390s, sharing the frame and engine of the Indian-built, Austrian-badged machines. The larger Vitpilen 701 similarly uses KTM’s Duke 690 as its basis. Although not officially shown yet,…"
