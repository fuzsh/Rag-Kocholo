        "text": "Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club Newsletter #845\n\nOctober 5, 2018\n\nNo matter what else happens in life, you can sit down to a chess board and you will always find the same number of ranks and files; there is always a white square in the right corner and if you make the moves, you will do well. In life, you could make all the right decisions and still wind up in the streets.\n\n—Viktors Pupols, Seattle Post Intelligencer March 10, 1977;\n\nNorthwest Chess August 1977, page 5\n\n1) Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club News\n\nInternational Master Elliott Winslow won the 123-player Walter Shipman Memorial Tuesday Night Marathon with a 8–1 score. FIDE Master Ezra Chambers was second at 7½, and Women’s FIDE Master Natalya Tsodikova regained her USCF Master title by finishing clear third with 7 points.\n\nThe big rating gainers for players with established ratings were\n\nNicholas Latourette (+253)\n\nRenate Otterbach (+238)\n\nRobert Frank (+228)\n\nAndrew Yun (+143)\n\nFrom round 9 of the Walter Shipman TNM G/2 Tuesday Night Marathon:\n\nWhite to move (Chambers–Tsodikova after 17...Qh5)Black to move (Chambers–Tsodikova after 24 e4)Black to move (Winslow–Askin after 19 Nb5)White to move (Diaz–Boldi after 45...Rf6)White to move (Gaffagan–Babayan after 53...Nf8)White to move (Chambers–Mays after 8...O-O)For the solutions, see the game scores for round 9.\n\nNational Master Conrado Diaz won the October 3rd edition of the Mechanics’ Wednesday Night Blitz with 10½ from 12. Second in the 14-player event was Expert Jules Jelinek with 10 points, and third was National Master Jordy Mont-Reynaud with 8.\n\nWe note belatedly the passing of former MI member Leonid Stolyarov (July 5, 1934 - May 23, 2017). Mr. Stolyarov, a USCF Senior Master, was born in Ukraine and made his home in the Sunset District of San Francisco the last four decades of his life.\n\nFew individuals have done more for the Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club than Arthur Stamer, Henry Gross and Charles Bagby, each of whom made major contributions to the Institute for close to 40 years.\n\nArthur Stamer, who was the first MI Chess Director from 1951 to 1963, and National Masters Henry Gross (standing) and Charles Bagby. (Photo: Mechanics’ Institute Archives)\n\nArthur Stamer was the first MI Chess Director, holding this position from 1951 until his death in 1964 (previous to this the Chess Room was run by a committee). He was Mechanics Institute Chess Club champion in 1905 and 1923.\n\nHenry Gross was a former California State Champion (1952). In 1928, he tied for 1st place in the 7th California State Championship, but lost the playoff to A.J. Fink. He was champion of the East Bay based Castle Chess Club, open to former UC Berkeley graduates, over a dozen times.\n\nCharles Bagby is the second longest serving MI Trustee behind only Neil Falconer. He was the Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club championship in 1923, the Northern California Championship in 1949 and 1950 and the California championship in 1958\n\nThe physical appearance of the Mechanics’ Chess Club has changed surprisingly little the past 90-plus years since the move in the early 1920s from the third floor to the fourth floor. The following photo taken in 1930 could pass for the club today, if not for the sprinkler system and more modern chairs today.\n\nMI Chess Room circa 1930 (Photo: Mechanics’ Institute Archives)\n\nInternational Master William Addison, the strongest player to serve as the Mechanics’ Chess Director, sent the following biography to Jerry Larkin, organizer of the 1969 Strawberry Open, in May of that year. Addison would go on to tie for first in that tournament with Grandmaster Larry Evans.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAlong with this note find a copy of Chess Life and a recent photo (Addison appeared on the October 1967 issue).\n\nFor your publicity I should reveal that: I was granted the title of International Master of Chess by the Federation International d’Echec at their recent meeting at Lugano, Switzerland. The title, valid for life, was based upon my performance at a tournament at Maribor, Yugoslavia in July, 1967. My most recent international performance was in a tournament at Reykjavik, Iceland where I scored draws with Olafsson, Uhlmann, Szabo and others.\n\nPrior to my participation in international tournaments I had represented the United States on our Olympic chess team at Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1964 and at Havana, Cuba, in 1966.\n\nExcept for last year, I have participated in the United States Championship since 1962 at which time I tied for third place with Grandmasters Reshevsky and Evans (Editor: later in 1969 Addison would have the best result of his career finishing second in his last US Championship and qualifying for the 1970 Interzonal).\n\nI won the California State Championship in 1962 and 1963, but have not participated since.\n\nI was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on November 28, 1933. I have lived in San Francisco since 1952 except for a stay in New York City in 1959 and in Los Angeles in 1963-64 at which time I was youth activities director with the Piatigorsky Foundation. In 1965 I became Chess Club Director for the Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club and have served in that post until my forthcoming resignation on June 10th of this year.\n\nI am a single man and my “outside” interests are music and things oriental. I hold the rank of amateur “Shodan” in the game of “Go”.\n\nThe Mechanics’ will host one of its long-running annual tournaments, the Carroll Capps Memorial on November 3–4. It is named in honor of the well-liked Master and noted science fiction writer (under the pen name C. C. MacApp). Filipino International Master Ricardo deGuzman is all-time record holder, having won the Capps nine times.\n\nCarroll M.

A tournament was held in July of 1979 and another was advertised in Chess Voice to be held in November of that year. All indications are that it was held. We have been unable to find results for this event and ask for assistance.\n\n2) 2018 Olympiad in Batumi, Georgia\n\nAfter 10 rounds in the open section, the U.S. is tied for first with China; each has won 8, drawn 1, and lost 1 round (each round is 4 games), and the U.S. has a slight lead in tie-break points. These two teams will battle it out in the final round 11 on October 5. Playing for the U.S. in this round will be GM Fabiano Caruana, GM Wesley So, GM Hikaru Nakamura and GM Sam Shankland. IM John Donaldson is the team captain.\n\nThe U.S. women are tied for second with Ukraine and will play them in the final round; China is in first place, and will play Russia. The U.S. players will be IM Anna Zatonskih, GM Irina Krush, WGM Tatev Abrahamyan and FM Jennifer Yu. GM Khachiyan Melikset is the team captain.\n\nFurther information on the Olympiad, including downloadable games, can be found here.\n\n3) James Tarjan Annotates\n\nIn Round 8 I did venture 1. ...g6. Judging by the result it was a success. However, as often seems to be the case with these presumably sharp unbalanced openings, the position after 11 moves is just as symmetrical and balanced, and potentially drawish, as if I had played 1. ...d5. And as I sensed at the board, my efforts to complicate and turn the position into a Kings Indian style mess were not objectively correct. However, at the crucial moment at the 18th move, he thought and thought and I in turn began to hope. He turned to defense and made overly passive moves, and then a lemon.\n\nPirc B06\n\nIwu Okechukwu–James Tarjan\n\nUS Open (8) 2018\n\n1.d4 g6 2.e4 Bg7 3.Nf3 d6 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.Qe2 0-0 6.0-0 Bg4 7.Nbd2 Nc6 8.c3 e5 9.h3 Bd7\n\nTiger gives only what I played, 9. ...Bd7.

Here are some recent finds:\n\nFirst a newspaper article from the Tampa Daily Times of March 2, 1956, which covers one of the last stops of the Log Cabin Chess Club in its 1956 tour. 12-year-old Bobby Fischer was the Log Cabin’s second board.\n\nWilliam Lombardy made the direct claim that he was Bobby Fischer’s teacher in his book Understanding Chess and indirectly that he was his mentor.\n\nInternational Master Lawrence Day offered another explanation in his chess column in the Toronto Star of May 3, 2008\n\n“According to Duncan and Dobrila Suttles (who only talked about it after Fischer’s death) young Bobby considered Abe Turner as his major mentor and father figure.\n\nTrusting that they wouldn’t blab to the ‘creepy’ media, Fischer opened up about some mysteries in his life. One was the split with his mother at age 16. According to Fischer this was when he was introduced to conspiracy theory. The Communist plot to take over the world was elaborated to him, and that he had a role to play in combatting it. The problem: his mother, Regina, was herself a Communist. That motivated the family break which lasted until the 1980s. Of his mentors, Fischer considered Abe Turner was his main influence as ‘father figure’. It spooked Bobby greatly in 1962 when Turner was stabbed to death by ex-mental patient Theodore Smith. The murderer claimed the Secret Service had ordered it because Turner was a Communist spy. That mysterious death was the catalyst in Fischer switching his religious views from atheistic Nietzscheism to Herbert Armstrong’s popular radio cult ‘Worldwide Church of God’.”\n\nEdmar Mednis wrote in How to Beat Bobby Fischer about meeting Bobby in Belgrade immediately after the World Student Championship in Varna, Bulgaria, and Fischer showing the games of his training match with Milan Matulovic.\n\nMednis was not the only member of the US Student Team to meet Bobby in Yugoslavia that summer. Anthony Saidy stopped in Portoroz and remembers watching Sherwin–Pachman from round 5, which the former was clearly winning but managed to lose.\n\nSpeaking of Student Team Championships, here is Bobby talking about the U.S. win in 1960.\n\n“When the U.S. Student Team won the world championship at Leningrad in 1960, I remember the great pleasure I felt when I read in a Russian magazine the devious twisting to find an excuse for the failure of the Russian team to win the championship. First, it was stated that their failure to win was due to a lack of preparation, and then the article complained bitterly that some of the team players had the gall to ‘take a boat to a Ball’ prior to the game with the Americans. I hope that I again have the pleasure to read a similar Russian complaint when our U.S. Student Team repeats its brilliant performance this summer.”—Bobby Fischer, U.S. Chess Champion.\n\nAmerican Chess Quarterly, Winter 1964 (back cover)\n\nFischer’s visit to Las Vegas is one of his lesser-known stops on his 1964 exhibition\n\nThanks to Las Vegas Expert Charles McVoy for the following article, which was published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Wednesday, April 15, 1964.\n\nThe exhibition, sandwiched in between simuls in Santa Monica (April 19) and Denver (April 26), saw Bobby score + 34, =1, -0. According to the late Ken Smith, who made the only draw, things were over quick as Bobby needed only lasted 1½ hours to finish things off.\n\nBoy Wonder of Chess will compete\n\nAs local golf fans anticipate the forthcoming tournament of champions, Las Vegas will be visited by a champion of the world’s most cerebral competition.\n\nBobby Fischer, current U.S. Chess Champion, will take on all comers in a simultaneous exhibition chess match sponsored by the Las Vegas Chess Club at the Dessert Inn, April 22 at 7 pm.\n\nChess, originally contrived by Indian Buddhists, as a substitute for war, is more like the real thing to Fischer, six-time U.S. Champion.\n\nEdward Lasker, unofficial dean of the American chess community, in his book entitled Chess for Fun and Blood describes Fischer as belonging to the latter category. “He always wants to kill his opponent” Lasker said.\n\nReported to have a disposition much like that of Attila the Hun, Fischer has electrified the chess world, not only for his daring, slashing play, but also for his occasional disregard for the social amenities compatible with formal chess competition.\n\nThe 20-year-old boy wonder is a maverick among the chess elite. Unlike other International Grand Masters—almost all highly-educated scholars or mathematicians—he never bothered to finish high school.\n\nWinning his first US title at the precocious age of 14, the “enfant terrible” of the American chess community is to many authorities a stronger player than the current World Champion, Tigran Petrosian.\n\nAt the U.S. Championships last December in New York the boy from Brooklyn performed an unparalleled feat by winning 11 straight matches—everyone he played.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Fischer will probably be playing more than 11 players—simultaneously. Tickets are available through chess club members Jerry Cole, Herman Estrada, Stan Zajac, Art Gamlin, and G. M. Farnham.\n\nSeven years after Fischer’s death, Ljubomir Ljubojevic told me an interesting story. During the second Fischer-Spassky match in 1992, Quinteros stayed with a woman friend in a luxury hotel in Belgrade; not as Fischer’s second, but just as a friend. Quinteros was in the habit of conducting long intercontinental telephone conversations from his hotel room, and he probably also drank many a good wine. After more than two months, the bill amounted to 327,000 dollars. Fischer paid the sum without blinking an eye.—Jan Timman in his book Timman’s Titans (p. 230)\n\n5) Frank Marshall in 1917 (Part Thirteen) by Eduardo Bauzá Mercére\n\nNovember 14, Marshall and Lasker Draw in Chess Match\n\nFrank J. Marshall, United States chess champion, played a draw at the Press Club last night against Edward Lasker of Chicago, western champion, and a consultation board of the best talent of several Chicago clubs. The match lasted three and one-half hours. Mr. Marshall is in Chicago for a week’s stay and will play matches against the picked players of various clubs here. He will meet all comers in simultaneous play at the Kenwood Chess Club on Saturday night.\n\nChicago Tribune, 15 Nov 1917, p. 13\n\nWhen in Chicago, in the course of his recent Western trip, Frank J. Marshall, United States chess champion, met Edward Lasker, the Western campion, in an exhibition match game at the Chicago Press Club. The game was drawn after twenty-nine moves.\n\nNY Sun, 2 Jan 1918, p. 11\n\nNovember 20: Chicago simul [+52-3=1]\n\nChess Champion Plays Fifty-six; Lead Men Used\n\nPlaying against fifty-six opponents, many of whom used lead men in the absence of the orthodox chess sets, no longer procurable from England, American champion Frank Marshall won fifty-two games, tied one, and lost three at the Western Electric Chess Club Tuesday night. The winners against the champion were J. F. Grosvenor, F. W. Anderson, and J. Shallcross.\n\nThe lead sets were made by company employees at the factory and painted. It is said England is unable to procure proper material for the usual pieces, owing to war conditions, and the sets come under the classification of nonessentials. The Western Electric players, however, solved the difficulty in their own shops.\n\nMarshall will appear in simultaneous play tonight at the University Club, tomorrow night at the Daisy Field Club, Belmont and Cicero avenues, and at the Kenwood Club Saturday night.\n\nChicago Tribune, 22 Nov 1917, p. 11\n\nCenter Gambit C21\n\nMarshall–Horace G.

Ward\n\nOn January 29, 1983, Vernon M. Holmes, 71, passed away, thus closing a chapter of Tacoma Chess history. The finest player in Pierce County of his generation, he was for many years the heart and soul of the Tacoma Chess Club.\n\nDuring the quarter century span from 1947 to 1972 he was the Pierce County Champion sixteen times. Perhaps the greatest demonstration of his mastery over Pierce County Chess, came in 1951 when he scored 20 wins, no draws, no losses in a double round robin against the best competition the county could offer. Never a professional player because of family and career responsibilities, he rarely played in weekend or out of town tournaments. Nevertheless, his great talent enabled him to notch victories over several reigning state champions in Puget Sound League play.\n\nOver the years, many of the young, aspiring players in the Tacoma area, including no less than five future state champions, had their talents sharpened by competition with Mr. Holmes.\n\nWhen asked which great master he most admired, he instantly replied “ Wilhelm Steinitz”. Indeed, Vernon was a classical player of the old school, invoking such dangerous openings as the Wing Gambit, King’s Gambit, Falkbeer Countergambit, and Evans Gambit. Every ready to give up a pawn or the exchange to gain an advantage his games often verged on the brink of disaster. Following is an example of his craft, versus many-time Washington State Champion J. Leonard Sheets in the 1948 Puget Sound League.\n\nSicilian Dragon B70\n\nJ.L. Sheets–Vernon Holmes\n\nPuget Sound League, 1948\n\n1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nc3 d6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 g6 6.Be2 Bg7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Kh1 Nc6 9.f4 Nxe4 10.Nxc6 Nxc3 11.Nxd8 Nxd1 12.Nxf7 Nxb2 13.Ng5 Nd3 14.Rb1 Nxc1 15.Bc4+ Kh8 16.Rbxc1 h6 17.Ne6 Rf6 18.Nc7 Rb8 19.Rce1 e5 20.Ne8 Rxf4 21.Rxf4 exf4 22.Nxd6 Bd7 23.Re7 Bc6 24.h4 Bf8 25.Nf7+ Kg7 26.Rc7 Kf6 27.Nh8 Be4 28.Bd3 Bxd3 29.cxd3 Be7 30.Nxg6 Bd8 31.Nxf4 Bxc7 32.Nd5+ Ke5 33.Nxc7 a6 0-1\n\n7) This is the end\n\nAn ending from a very recent Grandmaster game. White cannot afford to lose his only pawn.\n\nBlack to move\n\nShow solution\n\n1 ... Ke8\n\nThe alternative 1 ... a2 is no better; 2 Bc3 Ke8\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 2 ... Ke8)\n\n3 Bb2 Kd8 (3 ... Kd7 4 Kg5 Kc6 5 Kf6 cleans up.)\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 5 Kf6)\n\n4 Kg5\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 4 Kg5)\n\n4 ... Ke8 Black must be prepared to guard f7 whenever White moves Kf6. 5 Kf4 Kd8.\n\nIf instead 5 ... Ke7 6 Ke4\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 6 Ke4)\n\nBlack is unable to trade pawns, as either 6 ... f6? or f5+? loses. After 6 ... f6 7 exf6+ the bishop does double duty.\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 7 exf6+)\n\n7 ... Kf7 8 Ke5 Ke8 9 Kxe6;\n\nwhile after 6 ... f5+ 7 exf6+ Kf7 8 Ke5\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 8 Ke5)\n\nAlso, 5 ... Kd7 6 Ke4 Kc6 7 Kd4\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 7 Kd4)\n\n7 ... Kb5 8 Kc3 Ka4 9 Kc4 Ka5 10 Kb3 and wins.\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 10 Kb3)\n\nThus, following 5 ... Kd8, 6 Ke4 Kc7 7 Kd4 Kb6 8 Kc3 Ka5 9 Kb3, and wins as in the previous line.\n\n2 Kg5 Kd7\n\nWhite to move\n\n3 Kf6 Ke8\n\n4 Bc3\n\nBlack to move\n\n4 ... a2\n\n5 Ba1\n\n5 ... Kf8\n\nWhite to move\n\nNow White brings the king over to capture the a-pawn. Black is helpless to stop this, as the bishop will always be guarding both the promotion square and the lone white pawn.\n\n6 Kg5 Ke7\n\n7 Kf4\n\nBlack to move\n\n7 ... Kd7\n\n8 Ke4 Kc6\n\nWhite to move\n\n9 Kd4 Kb5\n\n10 Kc3 1–0\n\nBlack to move\n\nBlack resigned because of 10 ... Ka5 11 Kb3 the a-pawn is lost\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 11 Kb3)\n\n11 ... Kb5 12 Bc3 Kc5 13 Kxa2\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 13 Kxa2)\n\n13 ... Kc4 14 Kb2 Kd5 15 Kb3\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 15 Kb3)\n\n15 ... Kc5 16 Kc2 Kb5 17 Kd3\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 17 Kd3)\n\n17 ... Kc5 18 Ke3 Kc4 19 Bb2 Kc5\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 19 ... Kc5)\n\n20 Kf4 Kc6 21 Kg5 Kd7\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 21 ... Kd7)\n\n22 Kf6 Ke8 23 Ba3\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 23 Ba3)\n\nNow White wins both black pawns, and the rest is easy.\n\nThis is the game Viktor Laznicka (Czech Republic)–Yangyi Yu (China), from the 2018 World Chess Olympiad in Batumi, round 5, played on September 28. Wesley So will have Black against Yu in the final Olympiad round."
