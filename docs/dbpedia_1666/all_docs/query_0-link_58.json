It was a hard working and productive session. The Regional Vice Presidents and our non-board National Committee Chairmen were invited to attend, and I was delighted when three of our RVPs (Stahly of Region 6, Settle of Region 21, and Mrs. O’Kelly of Region 23) and two of our National Committee Chairmen (Mrs. Ramsey for Judges and Judges Training and Mrs. Christlieb for Robins) were able to meet with us. The Board of Directors minutes will detail our proceedings, but several items should, I think, be called to your special attention. Glenn Corlew (Membership) reported that our downward membership has sharply slowed and recommended that we continue the New Membership and Membership Renewal Campaigns. Our Treasurer pointed out our ex¬ penditures this past year fell within our income for the year, but cautioned against too much optimism about the future. The proposal that an awards system be set up for the Californicae iris was approved, and a committee was set up to work out the judging standards and to im¬ plement the award system. A new “Board of Directors Award” was established to honor any iris that has not won a Dykes Medal but which shows clearly in its progeny that it is among the greats of irisdom. Ann Dasch (Youth Chairman) reports that many RVPs who received a question page at our Portland meeting have failed to send in their answers to her. It would be most helpful if you would complete your answers and send them to her. In general her report was the most optimistic to date. The Board approved the Youth Committee’s recom¬ mendation for an annual Youth Award. The particulars can be found in the Board minutes. Dr. Clarke Cosgrove’s report on the British Iris Society’s Golden Jubilee, which he attended, was fascinating but too brief. This meeting terminated the Board membership of two directors who have served most faithfully and well — Dr. Raymond Allen and Robert Schreiner. Their counsel will be sorely missed. Fortunately, their successors, Bennett Jones and Leon Wolford, are experienced, sound thinkers, and well liked. On Saturday evening we were the guests of the Greater Omaha Iris Society. The fine dinner and the good fellowship with the club members were a delightful and restful experience. It helped make our annual Board meeting in Omaha a pleasant one. Dr. Hugo Wall January, 1973 SEE THEE IIS PHILADELPHIA 5 NOTICE TO ALL AFFILIATES Over the years our list of affiliates has grown until now we have up¬ wards of 75 active participating societies. We are proud of this imposing list. But we think that the other side of the coin is that affiliation with the American Iris Society adds stature to the local society. Increases in growth and stature have added increased difficulties of administration. Some of our affiliates faithfully adhere to requirements. Others ignore their obligations until they are contacted. Obviously it is impractical to follow up on all of these societies, so we earnestly solicit the co¬ operation of all. The current requirements for affiliation appear in each issue of the AIS Bulletin, but since they have been overlooked in many cases they are repeated here: 1. All of the officers and directors of the society must be AIS members. 2. There must be enough additional AIS members to total at least 10. 3. The society must participate in the AIS system of registrations and awards. 4. If the above requirements have been met, a society 50% or more of whose members are also AIS members will be enrolled without charge. If less than 50% of its members are qualified, a society may still become an affiliate upon payment of a fee, presently $25.00. After having qualified initially, the local society is further obligated to maintain its status by submitting annually to the Chairman a list of officers and members. This is where many difficulties arise, since we have no way of knowing when you hold your annual elections. This list is checked out by the Executive Secretary of the AIS, who reports his findings to the Chairman, who then determines whether the society is qualified. Failure to submit the list to the Chairman will result in automatic disqualification. Societies who wish to become affiliated, but have difficulty meeting the requirements, or present affiliates who have difficulty in maintaining their status, are invited to write to the Chairman and explain their problems. The Board of Directors has voted a substantial degree of discretion to your Chairman, and we will do our very best to help you. Glenn F. Hanson Chairman, Affiliates and Sections The following clubs have been cleared for affiliate status for 1973 by the Chairman of Affiliates and the Secretary. This list reflects the change in affiliate status since October publication. WICHITA AREA IRIS SOCIETY, Pres., Way D. Kenny, Wichita, KS.

As first capital of the nation Philadelphia offered great vitality in providing the country’s first hospital, first medical school, first university (1796)*, first fire insurance, first savings and loan (PSFS), and America’s first real grand opera, “Leonora” by the Philadelphian William Henry Fry. This cultural tradition produced great universities, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, Thomas Jeffer¬ son University, LaSalle College, St. Joseph’s College, six medical colleges (one for women), several theological seminaries, and suburban Villanova University, Princeton University, Lehigh University, Rutgers University, Lincoln University and the University of Delaware, famous Swarthmore College, Haverford College, Bryn Mawr College and Beaver College. Philadelphia has produced the Barrymores (John, Ethel and Lionel), sing¬ ers like Mario Lanza, Eddie Fisher, Marian Anderson and Anna Moffo, and celebrities such as Pearl Bailey and Joey Bishop. Out of this cultural background let’s see the City. Philadelphia’s Fairmount Park is the world’s largest city park, with over 7,800 acres, which stretches from center city’s City Hall (550 feet tall) northerly to West Philadelphia and Chestnut Hill along the Schuyl¬ kill River and Wissahickon Creek. It is being extended south to the University of Pennsylvania and America’s first botanic garden, Bartram’s Garden. Within Fairmount Park one finds the chief cultural attractions: the Art Museum, Franklin Institute (superb science museum), Playhouse- in-the-Park, Robin Hood Dell (for summer opera and orchestra concerts) Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Free Library (with six million items), unique Rodin Museum of Auguste Rodin sculpture, Kennedy Plaza and Logan Circle fountains, six colonial mansions open to public, and America’s first Zoo with 1,400 animals and the Academy of Natural Sciences (first in U.S.). The Morris Arboretum is located at the top of Fairmount Park and operated by the University of Pennsylvania. To the west is the Barnes Arboretum and Art Gallery in Merion, adjoining St. Joseph’s College. The Barnes is a gem of a garden (twelve tidy acres); 200 magnificent Renoirs highlight a well-rounded art collection in the Museum. Write in advance to: 300 N. Latches Lane, Merion Station, Penn. 19066. Philadelphia had gardened long before the father-son team of John and William Bartram in the 1700’s. William Penn had his garden at Penns- bury Manor (1682-1701) only two or three miles east of my home in Levittown. The manor home has been restored and the gardens are well worth a visit. It is quite natural that a young Philadelphian named John Caspar Wister should study irises in France after the First World War (as I did in 1962). When he came home to Philadelphia he decided to found the American Iris Society with others in 1920. *(The University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1740, became the first University in 1796). 9 Philadelphia’s history is significant to all Americans. Since Philadelphia was capital of the British Colonies from about 1740 to 1776 and then capital of the United States from 1776 to 1800, history book stories of the Liberty Bell in Independence Hall, of Carpenter’s Hall, the first two Banks of the United States, Betsy Ross House, first Stock Exchange, first Roman Catholic church (St. Joseph’s) and first Jewish and first Methodist church still stand. Old Swedes Church (1643) and lovely Christ Church of the first Presidents also remain in Philadelphia. A charming walk should be taken on foot from the Independence National Historical Park south along Third Street (note Powell House at 244 S. Third), to Delancey Street, left (east) along quaint Delancey Street with nicely restored homes (note through a wrought-iron gate a large Japanese garden on north side) to Second Street, then right (south) on Second Street to the old market place around cute Head House; explore restored shoppes here; then go right (west) on Pine Street (at north end of Head House), detour a bit by taking first tiny alley south to new town houses, nice open spaces, return to Pine Street, go west to Fourth Street, note lovely old St. Peter’s Episcopal and Pine Street Presbyterian churches, then right (north) along Fourth Street, noting plaques on historic homes and St. Mary’s Catholic Church (first U.S. cathedral) at Fourth and Locust; at 212 S. Fourth glimpse garden of the first fire insurance company in U.S., then at Fourth and Walnut turn right at St. Joseph’s Church to see the 18th century Colonial Garden between Dilworth-Todd-Moylan House and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society headquarters at 325 Walnut Street with greenhouses out back facing Carpenter’s Hall and a fine library of 11,000 horticultural books. If you enjoy this walk, you will want to see old historic stone homes such as James Logan’s “Stenton” at 16th and Wyoming Streets in Logan section; then along Germantown Avenue stretching from the Nagley Mansion above Wayne Junction, note the first American funeral home, Kirk & Nice, at Germantown Avenue and Washington Lane, the home in Vernon Park above Chelten Avenue (Rowell’s Department Store occupies three corners), the Chew House, “Cliveden” below Upsal Street and Germantown Avenue, and the exclusive Chestnut Hill shoppes along Germantown Avenue at the dizzy height of over 400 feet above sea level! The village of Germantown was the nation’s summer capital, especially during the Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793. As the summer home of Presidents and Congressmen it received its earliest stone dwellings along the Avenue. Philadelphia Iris Gardens Most iris gardens around Philadelphia are found in average-sized yards. However, Longwood Gardens cover 1,600 acres, with about 50 acres in¬ tensively developed with formal Italian fountain gardens or informal hill¬ sides covered with rare conifers or exotic rhododendrons, heathers and alpine rock gardens. A waterfall leaps 60 feet to a quiet pool beneath a carillon tower which chimes away the hours. Topiary work is displayed outdoors and indoors. Several conservatories offer seasonal variety with rare orchids, tree ferns, a beautiful humid jungle, and an arid, prickly desert, each in separate rooms. Others are devoted to bromeliads, palms, camellias, azaleas, acacias and other exotica. Numerous newer 10 iris have been planted for your enjoyment. Helen Chariott’s lovely, large estate offers a handsome stone home and walled gardens with unusual trees such as Styrax Obassia, Aesculus X carnea, Franklinia alatamaha (rescued from extinction by Philadelphia’s John Bartram), Koelreuteria paniculata, Chionanthus virginicus (with fragrant, billowy clouds of bloom at iris time), and Pinus Wallichiana (P. Griffithii) from the Himalayan Mountains. These arboreal specimens af¬ ford a fine background for the new Greek amphitheater of 300 guest iris on a gentle slope. Sterling Innerst has an attractive garden in York County, reportedly in tiptop condition. Between York and Reading lies the famous Lancaster County area known as Pennsylvania Dutch country, famed for its unique cuisine and artwork. We will dine with seven sweets and seven sours! Come see what we mean! You’ll long remember Pennsylvania Dutchland. Covered, horse-drawn carriages, too. In Reading the Kegerise sisters both hybridize irises. Eleanor and Richard of Temple have a finely manicured lawn which sets off formal, British-style, deep beds of perennials featuring well-grown irises. Evelyn, Grant and Steve offer irises grown in formal beds, well raised and neatly edged in suburban Hyde Park. Bill Hirsch, Convention Chairman, and his wife Jan, also share an avid interest in rare rock garden and alpine plants which Jan raises suc¬ cessfully from worldwide seed sources. Their irises are as handsome as all their menagerie of other trees, shrubs and herbs. Note the Lonicera nitida and hybrid Mahoherberis Neubertii. Frank Walchak, a school principal, gardens upon a sharp hillside whose slopes are thickly planted with erosion-preventing irises. They like the drainage and grow luxuriantly here in Lansdowne. Russel Snyder of Landenberg has excellent Chester County soil which helps nurture his carefully-tended beds of irises. A Dykes Medal col¬ lection is featured here. Clyde Hixson occupies a rustic, 200-year-old colonial farmstead, with a large, well-rounded collection of perennials featuring daffodils, irises, superb peonies, and daylilies. She keeps up with the latest cultivars in all these groups and also enjoys creating new rock gardens and stone paths. Each visit discovers something new and interesting. Besides, she is a sweet belle from North Carolina! Across the Delaware River above Washington Crossing in Milford, New Jersey, the formal iris garden of Steve Zdepski looks beyond to magnificent mountains to the north (the Musconetcongs) . Their stone home, which they built, is also of modern design. Recrossing the Delaware River we reach our garden, which is always last to bloom, and our only commercial grower, and a superb finale for your Philadelphia Convention. Palette Gardens of Bill and Marilyn Newhard is a treasure trove which vies with botanic gardens for their rare trees, shrubs and herbs. Acer japonicum Cv. Aureum and Quercus dentata Cv. Pinnatifida are two examples rarely found in arboretums. Certain ferns were imported from England. Unusual sempervivums came from Switzerland. Irises cover the gamut from the best Siberians to the latest standard dwarfs, intermediates, border bearded and tall bearded. Infrequently-grown Iris species are nestled here and there amongst the boulders and outcroppings of natural rock. Bill has built several rock gardens, using nature’s gift of the ideal rock formations. Come see this one. In the horse country of Devon near Newtown Square a rosarian also grows irises. Lincoln Atkiss uses his knowledge of rose culture to raise the finest irises. Come see Philadelphia in 1973 from May 28th to June first. You’ll never forget Pennsylvania Dutchland! (Dr. Murray has his Ph.D. in horticulture from the Pennsylvania State University and is Secretary of the Convention-sponsoring Delaware Valley Iris Society which he organized in 1956. He is also Publicity Chairman for the 1973 Convention.) THE POD FROM FLOWER TO SEED Betty Wood Just below every iris flower is the ovary, filled with potential seeds. Split one open and you see the little white round objects waiting for some member of the AIS to cause their fertilization. In this picture the ovary has been split open and the tip of the knife points to the anther, loaded with pollen. This pollen, or that from another flower, only needs to be unloaded on top of the white lip just above the knife to cause the little round objects to grow into seeds in a couple of months. This flower, severed from its nourishing stem, will never make it. Successive stages in the increasing seed size are shown in the second picture. The twisted brown dried-up flower still clings above each pod. The developing seeds stay white as the pod swells. Only when the expanding green envelope around them turns brown do the seeds become colored too. All hybridizers have, with great satisfaction, tumbled the ripe brown seeds from their splitting tan shell. Perhaps not all of them have seen the seeds in the earlier stages of their development. 12 Ron Mullin Last May I visited several gardens of the Pacific Northwest and several in Utah before and after the convention in Portland. I was impressed with the magnificent scenery. The cascading waterfalls, rushing streams, majestic mountains, and tall pines did nothing to detract from the beauty of the first large commercial garden I had ever visited. The Eden Road Garden of Gordon Plough is situated on sloping terrain which enables Gordon to irrigate by turning on the hydrant found at the upper end of each row and allowing water to run beside the plants. At the lower end of the garden one can look down to the Columbia River and then look upward to snow-capped peaks at close range. The opposite end of the garden is sheltered from the street by a row of lilacs of various colors. I immediately looked for Winner’s Circle and found it just beginning to bloom those deep violet black fiowers with perfect circles of white in the falls. While this pretty fiower is not the ultimate in form, it has good enough form to warrant praise, considering its unusual coloring. A bicolor plicata like Sinkiang is also a new color pattern. The standards are white edged in light blue while the falls are white with a violet edging. The form on this one is good and the contrast in color makes it quite a beauty. Rain Shadow has to be one of the best ever introduced by Gordon. A deep violet-blue neglecta with many ruffles, a nice stalk, and other good qualities make this one of the best in a class with many contenders. Pencil Sketch is a greyed yellow with lines radiating from the center of the fiower as if someone had taken a pencil and drawn the lines. An oddity that I liked because it is so different. Sands of Gold, had golden yellow standards and falls of similar color, with red-brown plicata marks giving it its name. A very bright addition to the garden. An entire row of show stalks with three open fiowers on each one prompted me to search out the name of an excellent and very clean white and violet plicata. I discovered that it was a 1972 introduction called Aegean Star. Gordon has seedlings in several lines which show much promise, but the one I liked most was from a cross of Bon Vivant and Gaily Clad. It was outstanding in form, with broad petals which almost touched at the hafts. The pale pinkish standards above light violet-blue falls mark it as one which might be used in the search for a true pink and blue bicolor. Future introductions noted were Green Eyed Lady, a well-branched quest for the true green; Razzle Dazzle, a brilliant red and yellow plicata; and Rain or Shine, a Punchline type with more brilliant coloring than that variety. One might describe it as tan and gold. The standards are open, but do not flop. Near Milton-Freewater, Oregon, Tom and Opal Brown have selected a new site for their Sunnyhill Gardens. Although the garden itself is very flat, there are plenty of sunny hills surrounding it. The fertile soil of northeastern Oregon grows huge rhizomes and produces plants with an abundance of bloom. Water is supplied to these plants by large irriga¬ tion pipes, and again I envied these people the water they have available. Upon first entering the garden we spotted Buffy looking fantastic as 13 usual. The buff-pink and lacy perfection of this flower has made it a hit in Oklahoma, and it looked just as good in Oregon. Not far from Buffy we saw sdlg. 70-6F5. Its coral pink standards above white falls edged in the same color and much lace made us go back to this one again and again. It inherited all the good qualities of its parent, Buffy. A lovely pale misty orchid with a bright red beard was numbered 8-1A51 and rated three stars. A long row of Dutch Master was overwhelming. The butterscotch standards and violet-purple falls edged brown, the superb branching, and the good form made this one a hit at the Wichita meet. Full Tide will not be surpassed by any other iris currently available in form. Excellently branched stalks display these gorgeous blue flowers, and I considered it the best for 1972 from Opal. It is a child of Dykes Medal winner Babbling Brook. Marigold orange is the color given to describe Melodian, which was a bright spot in the garden. Yellow-green standards above lavender-blue falls gave Treasure Key that “something different” look we all search for. A very tall stalk displayed the two- toned lilac flowers of Holiday Show. Nearby its sib Royal Coachman was equally tall with flowers of white with red beards. Both had fine branch¬ ing. Autumn Hills was as brilliant as the colors which inspired its name, and Eagle Harbor surpassed the excellent showing it made in Wichita. Autumn Hills has gold stands and wine-red falls while Eagle Harbor is wisteria blue with a deeper blue beard. Cindy Ellen was gold, white, and lacy. Giving a description of the colors of Many Moods would be difficult. It is a quality iris of many colors blended together and very appropriately named. Thick showy beards have always been a trade mark of Opal Brown irises, and I discovered two with beards so brilliant they were like a beacon. 9-16G25 was a clean white with a coral pink beard which was different from anything else I’ve seen. A blue-violet flower with a glowing beard of bright blue was numbered 70-1E4. The beard was so brilliant it struck like a thunderbolt. Both of these were outstanding irises. The star of the Hazel Schmelzer garden in Walla Walla was Idyllic. It was quite small and the stalks were proportionately short, so I thought it was a border bearded iris. Apparently this was a year when this one was not normal height, since it is tall bearded. It is a complete self of buff orange, including the beard, and is very ruffled. Cherished Gift was a brilliant orange with the red beards, adding depth to the color. After the convention we went to Utah. The first garden visited here belonged to Les Peterson. What a wonderful man he is, and what a lovely spot his garden is! The irrigation ditch with its constantly running water that crosses the garden was almost as fascinating as the irises. Les said it was both a blessing and a curse. When someone upstream turns in too much water his garden is often flooded, but on the other hand the water is always available. One of the stars of the garden was the famous Gala Madrid, with its golden standards and reddish falls. Equally bright was one of its children. Road from Madrid. The standards are yellow with a tan influence, and the falls are red with a hint of brown which makes them almost mahogany. Another brilliant garden subject was Gracious Milan. A near amoena with red-violet falls. Card of Thanks has what Les calls sea lavender-blue standards, and tan falls with a 14 webbing effect on them. A child of the great Soni Ce, this one shows promise of being just as good as that variety. Morn Aglow was a pleasant surprise. Although the flowers are not as large as some, I didn’t find this a fault. The smoky blue-grey color can best be described as the color of the sky on an overcast morning just at the break of dawn. A burnt orange beard accents the color. One of my favorites of the year was Meadowlark Fringe. When introduced, one of the comments in the description was that it did not have enough buds. I’m not a bud counter, but it seemed to have enough to make it last as long as any other iris in my own garden. It has fine branching, but the outstanding feature is the butterscotch coloring with a metallic shine. At the garden of Tell Muhlestein we saw huge clumps of most varieties. Ethel Helms was a beautifully formed cream-white, with a narrow edging of yellow on all the petals. This perfectly branched iris was one of the best ever in this color class. We had an opportunity to see the deep violet bitone from Loleta Powell named Camelot Wine. This inherited much quality from its parent Camelot Rose, but is a deeper color. Esther Tams, who was so well represented at the convention by her outstanding neglecta Dream Lover, had another super introduction at Tell’s. This one was Rosilla and it had very pink standards above rosy orchid falls. While at Tell’s we had an opportunity to see his famous pollen box and saw him make several crosses with pollen from it. Keeping up with Tell was no easy task, because he has boundless energy and iris knowledge to match. Late in the afternoon we arrived at the Mission Bell Garden of Jim and Melba Hamblen. The irises are planted in rows so that viewing the individual flower is no problem. Irrigation trenches alongside each row permits watering and viewing at the same time with no problems. In a setting that looks as if it could be on a picture postcard, one is able to see current introductions like the perfect border bearded variety Manzanita. a blend of grape and plum coloring, this one found favor with our entire group. The brilliant yellow gold of Star Spangled was heightened by its orange beard. This one seemed to have super substance, and will be one of the outstanding introductions of 1974. For those who seek the perfect pink and blue bicolor. Lovely Jan will come the closest of anything available in reaching that goal. This is named in honor of the Hamblen’s granddaughter Jan, and is a fitting tribute to a well- mannered and lovely young lady. In addition to the clean coloring, I found the branching to be a big asset for this one. In the past few years Melba has given us three sibs of equal quality in varying shades of pink and orchid. The three — Orchid Wings, Country Lilac, and Flamingo Fling — will have some beautiful competition from H67-144-0. This one is a very ruffled orchid that goes to the top of the list in that color range. It v/ill be introduced in 1973 as Pretty Karen, in honor of another grand¬ daughter. H67-156A was the best of many pink seedlings in the garden. It is very wide, very ruffled, and very pink. It will be named Michelin, and will be on everyone’s want list. H66-36C had light pink standards and blue orchid falls. I liked the form, branching, and coloring on this one, and feel that it is well described by its name Misty Dawn. The beauti¬ fully ruffled flowers were displayed three to a stalk with many buds to 15 open. One of the most exciting flowers seen here was H68-32C. It had light blue standards and falls which were the same color on the outer edges, but with a much deeper concentration of color in the center of the falls. This “spot” seemed to get darker as the flower aged, and the tangerine beard added depth to the blue. The form on this was very good, and although it has no balkana breeding, its spot pattern is much more defined than anything I’ve seen from that iris. Blue Mink is a light greyish blue with a three star rating from me. Well described by the name. The Ben Stanger garden could be called “Gardener’s Paradise.” Many different types of trees, shrubs, and flowers can be seen here planted among a rock collection that turned me green with envy. Ben had per¬ formed the miracle of making these plants and rocks look as if they had been placed by nature, so perfect was the setting. The small back yard garden of Herb Spence, with snow-capped mountains so close it seemed as if you could almost touch the snow, featured the best red-bearded white iris I’ve seen. With lace and wide, wide petals of snow white and a beard that appeared to be redder than on any other iris, this one rated unlimited stars in my notes. 66-530A has since been named Valentina. You’ll want to get it for color, form, branch¬ ing, and can probably count on winning some blue ribbons with it. The hafts were so wide that any yellow there was completely hidden. Herb also had some lovely blue and pink bicolored seedlings which we admired. One of these will be named Melody D’Amour. His Gateway was out¬ standing everywhere we saw it, and was even good enough to be noticeable among the splendor of Ben Stanger’s garden. I liked Strange Interlude with its smoky tan coloring. You’ll like it too if you go for unusual colors. The last garden we visited was the Bion Tolman garden. Here we were surrounded by millions of blooms and a lush, green, carpet-like lawn. Some of Bion’s seedlings from La Negra Flor and Smart Set were spec¬ tacular, but the iris I liked best was Flamingo Lace. This is a fine pink, introduced this year. In the ten days of this trip I was dazzled by spectacular gardens and gorgeous flowers. I shall remember these, but as I look back, the thing I remember most is the friendly welcome we received everywhere. Both the below were registered in 1972: Diamond Lights.

It is a review of the new book THE JAPANESE IRIS, edited by Motojiro Kuribayashi and Shuichi Hirao, dated 1971, published by the Asahi Shimbun Publishing Company, Tokyo, Japan. All of the text and all of the photo captions in the book are printed in English as well as in Japanese, and thirty-six of the color plates are of Japanese iris varieties other than of Japanese hybridizers. Most of these are U.S. varieties; the U.S. hybridizers who are represented include Arlie Payne, Walter Marx, Violet Worley, R. A. Rich, F. T. Maddocks, and Louise Marx. THE JAPANESE IRIS is superlatively well edited, and it is beautifully bound. It has a hardcover of purple fabric, covered with a heavy clear dust jacket. Over this, it is packaged first in a blue fabric-covered hardbox, which in turn is packaged in an imprinted shipping box. The 266 pages are beautifully printed on high-gloss white bond paper, and they are massive, a full 10x13 inches each, which is considerably larger than any telephone book. All the photographs are in full color, with a total of 346 superb color plates; very many of these are a full page in size. On this page is a tiny black & white representation of the Japanese iris IMMACULATE GLITTER, a 1963 variety of the late Arlie Payne, of the USA. The same illustration appears in the book, but in full color, and 10 full inches in vertical dimension, and in fine detail. For this and for every other of the 346 varieties illustrated in color in the book, information is provided on type of blossom, time of bloom, height of bloomstalk, number of branches, rigidity and coloring of foliage, and parentage. All this data makes the book a true reference work. Because of all the premium features, the book is very expensive: $77 in US currency, prepaid. But for being a masterpiece it likely will bring more than its purchase price in future years, as a collector’s item. Thus it can be considered a real investment. Its acquisition is highly recommended. Bill Gunther 36 ^lie f^redidentiui earn Dr. Hugo Wall Dr. Clarke Cosgrove Ira E. Wood President First Vice President Second Vice President TWO NEW Bennett DIRECTORS C. Jones Bennett Jones comes to the Board with a rich experience in Region 13 offices, including a three-year term as RVP, and a large part in the management of two AIS national conventions. He brings to the Board the in¬ terest of the hybridizer, and indeed his successes in iris hybridizing has been nothing short of phenomenal, including the present very popular Elizabeth Stuart, and such award winners as Cherry Garden, Crystal Bay and Botany Bay. Leon C. Wolford Leon Wolford, a life member of AIS, has a great experience in iris affairs in the vast state of Texas. He served a three-year term as RVP, as chairman of Judges Train¬ ing for Region 17, and has served as an instructor in Judges Training schools. In addition, he has served as president of the Iris Society of Dallas and as show chairman, as well as other committee assign¬ ments; and as an area chairman in Region 17. 37 DISTINGUISHED SERVICE Dr. Raymond C. Allen Dr. Allen, the director of King- wood Center in Mansfield, Ohio, leaves the Board of Directors after serving since January 1964. For a period of years, he was director of the National Test Gardens, and later became chairman of the Scientific Committee, in which post he has been of invaluable service to the American Iris Society. Though no longer on the Board of Directors, Dr. Allen continues as the chairman of the Scientific Commit¬ tee. Robert V. Schreiner “Bob” Schreiner has served on the Board of Directors since January 1961. Since the very beginning of his Board service, he has been dele¬ gated the assignment of slides, and many are the clubs and affiliates who have seen these sterling slide sets which Bob Schreiner built. But his service to the Board was not limited to slides; his advice on many Board matters was eagerly sought and listened to carefully. Mrs. F. W. (Bee) Warburton Few if any have given so richly in dedicated service to the cause of irises as has Bee Warburton. In ad¬ dition to her contributions to the cause of median irises, she recently has been engaged in the promotion of Japanese and Siberian irises. Bee Warburton is effective as an advo¬ cate of irises and as a hybridizer of irises — who ever can forget Brassie. 38 HYBRIDIZERS MEDAL The Hybridizers Medal for 1972 goes to the husband-wife team of Rex and Alta Brown. Alta’s work with the smaller bearded irises has earned her this well-deserved honor. In the last four years, the record shows a Capame award, two Williamson- White Awards, the Sass Medal, six Awards of Merit and thirty Honor¬ able Mentions. Rex’s work has been with the tall bearded and the aril- bred. Lake Washington looks good in any garden, and as does Silver Wedding, and other R. Brown irises have become award winners with some regularity. We were fortunate in finding Rex and Alta at one of the great Arizona fishing holes of Arizona, and thus this forty-fifth wedding anniversary picture. Congratulations from the American Iris Society. DR. DENMAN HONORED The award, struck ten years ago, has been given only twice, the first time to the late Elizabeth Bergin. The medal is presented for “meritorious and outstanding service in the areas of growth, culture, breeding, developing, exhibiting, research and dissemination of knowledge of the iris genus.” Dr. C. P. Denman, Professor Emeritus of History at the Univer¬ sity of Texas at Arlington, and one of the prominent hybridizers of re¬ blooming irises, was awarded the Stella B. Chapman Memorial Award by the Iris Society of Dallas Friday evening, October 27. The meeting was presided over by Paul Horton, president of the Iris Society of Dal¬ las, and the guest speaker was William T. Bledsoe, past president of the American Iris Society.
