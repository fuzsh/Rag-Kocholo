        "text": "Serena said: \"I think Angela played extremely well. I think she was serving really good. She was really focused. I think she played actually unbelievable... I felt really rusty... like I was feeling my way around. I felt that I made some errors that shouldn't have been made, but it was just kind of getting back in the rhythm of things... as the match went on, I got a little bit better with everything.\" interview\n\nAsked how often she breaks racquets when she gets angry, Serena said: \"Just two this week, which is good for me. Usually I'm at five. I have a really short temper...\"\n\nAngela said: \"I was excited. It's a privilege to be able to come out first time at Wimbledon and play a champion like Serena. Plus it would let me see like where my game was at, things that I need to work on, like things Serena would exploit. I think I'm right around the corner, just a couple points here and there and I had the match... I never thought about winning. That could destroy everything, you get too far ahead of yourself. I've done that a lot of times and never really came out with the win. So again, just one point at a time. I was focusing a lot on my serve. I wanted to go into her body. I knew where the serve would come back to. I knew she really didn't like the body serve, so it worked out well.\" interview\n\nJustine only got 48% of her 1st serves in (Eleni: 71%), and hit 11 double faults, 7 in the 1st set. Justine also hit 48 unforced errors (Eleni: 15). Justine's last double fault came on match point for Eleni. match stats\n\nEleni said: \"I feel pretty good and pretty confident on grass. It's my surface... Justine is a great player, a great talent. Everyone can see she deserve to win French Open... I think she hurt also little bit her back. That's what I saw little bit in her face... I think today I was better in the close situation than her.\" interview\n\nJustine has been troubled by back pain for the past two months. Justine said: \"I didn't have the best preparation for coming here. That was the worst draw I could get. So I'm not going to be positive today, and I have no excuse... I never felt the good rhythm, and I missed some opportunities in the third set... I think my [back] injury got worse because of the grass. You have to be very low all the time. So it's going to be my main thing in the next few weeks to treat my injury, get better and get ready for the hard court.\" interview\n\nKim said: \"I did not know who [Katie] was until I saw her on court. But she doesn't give you a lot of rhythm... I still feel I've got a lot of improvement to make. My groundstrokes are not as I'd like them to be and my return can get better. There are some very good patches in my matches but I still need to be more consistent.\" interview\n\nAbout the condition of her right knee, in which she suffered a strained medial ligament at the German Open in Berlin on May 6, Kim said: \"...it's almost back to normal. I just came from the gym. I did my exercises. That's something that I'll have to do for the rest of my career to make sure that it's stable. [To make sure] all the muscles around it are very strong and they protect the knee, the medial ligaments. So that's something I'll probably have to do with the wrist [also-- Kim's left wrist was badly injured twice in 2004]. But it feels good to be playing without the tape, as well.\" Kim played at Roland Garros last month with her knee heavily taped to prevent further injury. interview\n\nBBC: Kim Clijsters' Wimbledon Diary, June 20\n\nLindsay said: \"The first set was easy. The second set was not. It was tough. I was down 3-1. I think [Jamea] had a point for 4-1. A couple other games went to deuce. So definitely had some close games there in the second set...\n\n[Jamea is] obviously a great athlete. I thought she moved very well. I thought in the beginning I was overpowering her on some tough balls. A lot of that is the grass and hitting some balls late. I think when she got a little more confident in the second set, she started to hit the ball a little bit better. I'd like to see her work on just trying to be more aggressive. And I know that's tough to do against certain players. So maybe it's not a true indicator today. But I thought if she could just step into the court a little bit more on her chances. Coming through quallies and winning a first round here, that's a great first step for her.\" interview\n\nAmelie had been upset a week ago by Vera Douchevina in the 2nd round at Eastbourne (after a 1st round bye). Amelie said: \"I'm feeling much better, as the rhythm is coming. It was still good for me to go to Eastbourne because I really got to practice on the grass, which is a very special surface and different from what we play on all year long... After that loss last week, I kept working for the last few days and had a pretty good first round and obviously a very good second round... Everything was working very well. Not only of course my service games, but also I was returning pretty well, doing many things on [Maria's] returning games. Really controlling the match very well. It's also easier, when you're ahead, to start doing different things. Once you have the break it makes it a little easier... I've been serving very well, following that serve, coming in, especially on the first serve, and being very effective on the second serve as well.\" interview\n\nSerena's stats look better than the score. She got 72% of her 1st serves in (top speed 113 mph, avg 101 mph), winning the point on 76% of them. Serena also hit 32 winners (Mara: 20) with only 14 unforced errors (Mara: 23). Despite this substantial numeric superiority, Serena won the match by getting only one more break than Mara in the 2nd set. match stats\n\nSerena was troubled by pain from her left ankle, which she sprained at Amelia Island 2 months ago. When asked if it was a slight fracture, Serena said: \"That's what the radiologist report was.\"\n\nSerena said: \"I was feeling a little problems in my left leg in the beginning, so it was kind of just getting the feeling, getting used to it... Right now I'm working on playing through the pain and just seeing how it goes... I think with fractures you have to let it heal with time and let it go... It's weird. Because with me, some days it feels good and in general, as long as I tape it, it's okay. Then some days it gets a little cold maybe and it gets a little strange feeling. But I have to have pretty heavy taping on it.\" interview\n\nSvetlana hit 38 winners (Sania hit 35) while hitting 30 unforced errors (Sania: 37). 7 of Svetlana's unforced errors were double faults, while Sania missed the box twice 8 times. match stats\n\nSvetlana said: \"Today wasn't my day at all. As professional player, I ask myself to play through it. I couldn't play at all. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't move. I was so tense that my nerves just get me today. I just couldn't think properly...\n\n\"Sania, she is good player... She has great future. She has very good shots. But if I play my game, I should have won much easier... My game is to hit my forehand, is to go for my shots. I was doing all different today. I was serving. When I serve well, I wasn't expecting her to receive well, and she was doing it very well. She was keeping me back in baseline. I was trying to hit my backhands harder than my forehands. This is not my game.\n\n\"She was playing well because I've been letting her go. I just was tense. I didn't know what to do. I pushed the ball up and she just hit it as hard as she could. This is her game. This is the way she play, and not my game. It was my worst against her best... Something came in my mind and I had to do serve and volley last game. This really helped me out.\" interview\n\nIt was the first time either had ever played on the All England Club's Centre Court. Sania said: \"I think it's everyone's dream to play on Centre Court. First time Wimbledon, playing on Centre, I loved it. It was great...\n\n\"I think what separated us today was that volley [Svetlana] made at breakpoint at 5-4. That was one amazing volley she made...\n\n\"I gave what I had out there today. I was on top of every ball. Everything I could do, I tried to do... After that volley she deserved to win. She got that volley out at such a point, that I couldn't do anything about it.\" interview\n\nKim said: \"This is the best I felt for a long time. I'm very, very happy with this win... I think on a scale of 10, I would give myself an 8... I was moving a lot better. I was moving a lot lower. I was bending down a lot more through my legs, and I felt like I was seeing the ball well. It's been a long time since I felt like this, that I was seeing the ball really well. It's a very good feeling to have because, since Paris, I haven't really felt close to the way I felt the ball today.\n\n\"I think my serve has been probably the most consistent shot over the last two, three weeks. My serve has been the shot that's been winning me matches... My serve was the the shot that kept me up, and gave me a lot of easy mistakes from the opponent, and a lot of easy shots to go for winners.\" interview\n\nAbout her 3rd round opponent, Roberta Vinci, Kim said: She's definitely a girl who plays a really good grass court game. She comes in, she mixes her game up a lot, and she hits a good slice, great volleys. So I think I'll be running a lot to the net because she uses a dropshot quite a lot. It's going to be a completely different game than what I played today. It's a challenge to play against those kind of girls who just mix it up so much.\"\n\nLindsay said: \"It's probably going to be just a little bit tougher from here on out. I've always felt like on grass, if you play well and are aggressive, there's a lot of girls that don't like to play on grass, you can try and take advantage of that. Feel like the grass helps the pace of my shots a lot... \"\n\nAsked about the first time she ever played on grass, and in The Championships, Lindsay said: \"Quallies, '92... I lost first round [smiling]... Jennifer Santrock. Left-handed girl. It's tough. I mean, '93, I came and got to the third round here. But other than that, I never saw a grass court and struggled quite a lot until around '98 when I finally felt like I was able to handle it better... I think that my coach, Robert [Lansdorp], at the time helped me a lot by talking to me about grass, and telling me, especially women's tennis, girls do not like grass, you hit hard, if you can get your timing. Just really kind of talking me through. '96 and '97, I lost really early both years and wasn't really all that excited coming back in '98. You know, spending some time on it at home helped a little bit, too...\n\n\"Here at Wimbledon they make it so great, because it's almost like a really fast hard court. Obviously these are the best grass courts anywhere. That's a reason why I don't necessarily go to a lot of other tournaments beforehand. The courts there are not like the courts here at Wimbledon. If you get used to moving on grass a little bit, these are like a hard court most of the time...\n\n\"I feel a lot better than I did at the French when I was barely winning matches and sets. That's a positive. And I've played three opponents that I've been able to take control of the match and dominate. So it's been nice that I've been able to step up and do that.\n\n\"Monday's going to be a lot different story. Kim [Clijsters is] not going to let me do that so easily, and will get more balls back, and will really press me a lot more than I've pressed so far...\n\n\"I've got an interesting summer coming up, a lot of tournaments that I love to play, but did well in last year. You know, it's inevitable that I'm going to fall in the rankings. Any mathematician can figure that out. I think I'm just going to worry about trying to play well, and really worry about the preparation for the US Open, and hopefully can play as well as I did last summer.\"\n\nAbout The Championships in 2006, Lindsay said: \"I hope to be here and playing and everything. I don't really have any 'for sure' plans at this moment. I'm definitely going to finish this year out and hopefully stay healthy. If I'm playing well and healthy, I really think I'll be back next year. There's no reason why I won't. I think the most important thing is how my body responds.\" interview\n\nMaria only got 55% of her 1st serves in, but won 70% of her 1st serve points (Katarina: 54%). And Maria won 49% of points while receiving serve (Katarina: 37%). Maria scored on 11 of 14 trips to the net (Katarina: 3 of 8). match stats\n\nMaria said: \"The score doesn't say much about the match. It was a lot tougher than it seemed. Even though I was up in the first set, thought that [Katarina] was able to come up with some good shots, and put me in difficult situations. But I was able to serve well when I needed to, even though I wasn't serving quite well throughout the whole match.\n\n\"But even in the second set, she had the opportunity to come back into the match. She had four breakpoints at the end of the match. I was able to hit really good first serves.\" interview\n\nKatarina said: \"I think [Maria] played very good... I thought I played a very good match also. I served pretty well, and she was just returning unbelievable. And in first couple of games, I think only in the fourth game she gave me one unforced error... She was making no mistakes and she was playing very fast, very deep... she knew probably that I'm a tough competitor. I've been playing well lately also. Had some good wins on the grass, and I was going confident into the match.\n\n\"She was just too good. She had to fight for it, and that's what I'm happy about it, that I made her work for it.\" interview\n\nJill said: \"It feels great. I'm not sure if it's hit me yet, but it feels really good... I felt calm during the entire match, even at close points, that I felt like maybe I could have stepped up a little bit more. I pretty much felt calm and confident the whole time... I think I'm a really different player from when I played her two years ago in Wimbledon, and Miami last year... the two previous meetings when I played her, I don't think I believed that I could actually win the match, no matter how well I was playing. Because even if you're playing great, if you don't believe it, then it's usually doesn't happen. That's changed a lot for me.\" interview\n\nSerena said: \"The words that I can only use are all foul. It wouldn't be proper for me to use those words... I guess I had a lot of rust. I just didn't play well today. I mean, the other days I kind of played through it and the second and third set I got better. But today I didn't do anything right... I think I was better off staying home... [Jill] she didn't have to do anything exceptionally well today. She just pretty much had to show up... I couldn't win a service game in the first set. Then it was just downhill.\" interview\n\nAsked if the slight fracture in her left ankle affected her play, Serena said: \"No, it didn't at all.\"\n\nElena played cleanly, hitting 16 winners with only 13 unforced errors (to 12 and 28 for Mashona). And Elena had only 4 double faults, unusually few for her, while getting 64% of her 1st serves in the box. match stats\n\nElena began working on her serve with retired ATP pro Richard Krajicek last week in Holland. Elena said: \"Finally I've got my confidence on my serve... I was working with him last week and here as well, and he helped me a lot with my serve. I was very pleased that he was working with me because I think he had the best serve on the tour. It looks so simple when he does it. He left already, unfortunately for me, but I'm always thinking what he told me to do on the court, and I hope to work with him again.\" interview\n\nElena will play her friend Anastasia Myskina in the 4th round. About her loss to Anastasia in the 2004 French Open final, Elena said: \"I think that was the most incredible moment of my tennis career. I would never forget this moment. At the end of the tournament I was so tired, my leg was injured and I wasn't satisfied with the way I played that match, but it was still the best moment in my career. I'd never forget it. I look at my runner's-up trophy very often when I'm at home and this reminds me how good this tournament was for me.\"\n\nAfter that final in Paris, Elena went out to celebrate-- with Anastasia. Elena said: \"We were just celebrating this final, and people, when they saw us they were like 'Oh, it's Myskina and, oooh, it's Dementieva and they are together.' They couldn't believe their eyes, they thought we wouldn't be speaking to each other. When we were younger, if I lost to her I wouldn't talk to her for a couple of days, but now I play against Russian players almost every week, so I'm kind of used to it.\" story\n\nAnastasia held 2 match points at 5-3 in the 2nd set, but could not convert. Jelena fired a 2nd serve ace on one of the match points. It then took Anastasia 22 more games to finish the match. She was so upset after dropping the 2nd set that she fell behind 1-5 in the 3rd. Then she won 4 straight games to reach 5-5.\n\nAnastasia said: \"When sometimes you lose one, two, three matchpoints, then you kind of start thinking a lot, and it's not a good thing... I was thinking that, 'Why she serve ace on second serve?' I mean, this really was in my mind. I think that was really wrong to think about this serve for the rest of couple games... the whole third set almost I was thinking what I did wrong. But then after [trailing] 5-1, I realized that I'm playing third set so maybe it's something new I should do to finally win.\n\n\"[Jelena is] a great player... it was a really good match. She holds rallies, she play really fast, she serve pretty good. I think it was a good match.\" interview\n\nAnastasia's right shoulder has been hurting, and this is probably why she averaged only 92 mph on her 1st serve, and 76 mph on her 2nd. But she had only 2 double faults in 128 service points (Jelena had 10 DFs while serving 147 points). 'Nastya also hit 52 winners (to 37 for Jelena) and although she had 55 unforced errors, Jelena had 63 (8 more DFs making the difference). match stats\n\nDistracted by the shoulder injury, and her mother being seriously ill (her mother's health has recently improved), Anastasia had not won three matches in a row since October, 2004-- until this week. She has also won her 1st round matches in both doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nAnastasia Myskina will play Elena Dementieva in the 4th round on Monday. They have been friends since childhood, when they both trained together at Moscow's Spartak Academy. 'Nastya leads Elena 7-4 in career matches, and has won their last 3 meetings, all in straight sets, dating back to last year's French Open final.\n\nAbout playing her friend Elena, Anastasia said: \"I know her weakness, I know what she can do her best, and she knows me as well... I know her serve is not that great. Even though she's improving her serve every day, maybe that's my advantage, and I have to take it.\"\n\nKim hit only 8 unforced errors in the match (Roberta: 19) while hitting 24 winners (Roberta: 17). Kim won 82% of her 1st serve points. Kim won despite converting only 3 of 10 break points, while Roberta converted only 1 of 3 break points against Kim. match stats\n\nKim said: \"So far all my strokes are feeling pretty good. I feel like my serve has definitely been the strength, the most consistent shot so far on the grass court tournaments that I've played, in Eastbourne and here as well... My ground strokes have started to improve. I feel more and more control now. I feel like I'm moving well and that's important. But I still feel like everything has to be a little bit better if I want to be able to beat Lindsay [Davenport in the 4th round] on Monday.\" interview\n\nAbout playing # 1 Lindsay Davenport in the 4th round on Monday, Kim said: \"When you play Lindsay, you have to try to get to read her serve during the match... so you could actually start to tell where she's serving. And that's something that you have to adjust to first... She hits the ball so powerful, she hits the ball so deep, it's very hard to [make] her move, especially on grass. From the first shot I'll have to be aggressive and try to dominate the points. If you don't, against her, she's going to just put you under pressure, and then you're going to have a lot of pressure on your own serve game. So you have to keep putting the pressure on her, and try to make her move from the first shot you hit.\"\n\nLindsay said: \"I thought I was hitting the ball well. It's very tough to gauge on grass. But I was going after shots, making some errors, but holding serve, getting close to breaking a few times. I was happy with the way I played. I finished the second set not very well in the tiebreak. Made a lot of just bad errors there. But was able to come back in the third and really just kind of calm down and play a little bit cleaner again.\"\n\nAsked about playing to Kim's forehand, which has an extra-large backswing, and off which she has been hitting more errors, Lindsay said: \"I was really surprised at the French, at the end of that match, exactly what happened with her forehand. I was trying to keep that in mind with my serves and on the bigger points. Sometimes it backfired a little bit maybe playing it, missing some balls trying to go there. I did know about her backswing. I did know that she did miss a few in Paris. I was going to try and go there a little bit more. So that was part of plan going in.\"\n\nKim hit 3 double faults in the final game, the last DF coming on match point. Kim said: \"Because [Lindsay] was returning so well in my service games before, I really had to put a little bit more into my serves, and especially on the second serves. But that was probably wrong. It was. She puts you under so much pressure. From the moment you hit a second serve, you have to start running. I think I tried to do a little bit too much, especially when I went out wide, which was probably not a smart decision. But, you know, it's happened and you learn from it. Next time I won't do it...\n\n\"She served and returned a lot better than I did, a lot more aggressive and a lot more precise. Her strokes, especially on grass, it's so tough against her because she hits the ball so deep, very precise, close to the lines. She puts you under pressure straightaway. I think she did that really well...\n\n\"I think if you compare it to on a hard court, it's a lot tougher to move on the grass, obviously. Because I feel like if I can move around on hard court, it's a lot easier for me, because her strokes are not as dominant on hard court.\" interview\n\nMaria hit aces on 6 of her 51 1st serves (76% of which were good). Although she hit more errors than Nathalie (18-12), she also hit more winners (22-8). Nathalie did not hold a single break point against Maria in the match. match stats\n\nMaria said: \"[Nathalie] was playing really well the first probably six games, and I was making a few errors when I shouldn't have, but still felt like I was in it, still felt pretty confident on my serve. I felt like if I could put some pressure on her return, then I'd get a break, serve it out. That's exactly what I did. Second set, I just didn't make as many errors and was getting better and better... As the match went on, I think I played better and better. I played a different opponent than the round before, a little bit different- not as big of a serve, but more consistent.\" interview\n\nMaria will play Nadia Petrova in a quarterfinal on Tuesday. Maria and Nadia have played only once before, on a hard court in the 2nd round at Los Angeles in 2003, when then-16-year-old Maria won, 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.\n\nMaria said: \"I played her a long time ago. Big game, big serve. You know, obviously it's going to be another tough match. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nAmelie said: \"I think the beginning of the match was a little bit tough for me. I couldn't really find my rhythm. I was staying a little bit too far from the baseline for being able to really produce an aggressive game. And my serve wasn't working pretty well, so I had to adjust to that a little bit at the end of that first set to make sure I put the first serve in. I was making way too many double faults, giving her the opportunities on second serves. I had to adjust a little to that. Maybe the two days off were a little bit too much. I had to probably get back into the rhythm in that first set.\n\n\"In the second set was much better. I was more aggressive, finding my game, my rhythm, getting in, reading the ball pretty well. Even when I was staying back, I felt I was pretty strong at the baseline, because the court being so slow [compared to past years at Wimbledon], you still have to play some points from the baseline and go into maybe some long rallies sometimes. But I was feeling pretty comfortable in the second set on this part of the game. The most important thing I think is the way I finished, the way I really found my rhythm in that second set. Also at the end of the first set, I was able to make the difference. I'm pretty satisfied about today's match, even though the beginning wasn't my best tennis.\" interview\n\nElena, usually plagued by service trouble, put 79% of her 1st serves in, and had only 3 double faults while serving 127 times. However, Elena accomplished this by averaging a very low 83 mph on her 1st serve, and 79 mph on her 2nd serve. Anastasia, on the other hand, got only 55% of her 1st serves in (although at a higher velocity, averaging 94 mph), and double faulted 7 times. Anastasia also suffered from 52 unforced errors (45 plus the 7 DFs) in the 219 points played, while Elena had only 34. But in the 3rd set, Anastasia won 71% of her 1st serve points, and 60% of her receiving points, while hitting 12 winners and keeping her errors down to 10 (Elena: 11 and 11). match stats\n\nAnastasia said: \"Today I was really nervous at the beginning, because we have really lot of matches against each other and we know each other really well, so I was thinking a lot during the point. I didn't know what really to do with the ball because the [Elena's] serve was too slow. I didn't really expect that. Then I just get used to it for the rhythm, for the game, and realize that it's really nothing really special. I just have to play my game...\n\n\"One point and maybe I would be loser today. But I was really calm in tiebreak. I was exactly know what I have to do at some points, even though she had some match points. But I knew I had to return to her backhand. Even that her backhand improve a lot, but still it's the weaker side, I think.\n\n\"[Elena's] serve, it's really weak. Everybody knows that. Besides this, she's really good on baseline. She's moving really, really well. But even that I lost my serve, I still knew I that I can take advantage on her serve. If I can handle it my serve, then it's going to be easy. That's what happened after 3-love (in the 2nd set, when Anastasia trailed 1-6, 0-3, down 2 breaks). To her serve, I hold my one, then was for me, you know, two games and then easy to play. I believe in myself again, and just try to keep rallies and play her.\" interview\n\nAnastasia will play Amelie Mauresmo in a quarterfinal on Tuesday. Amelie leads Anastasia 5-1 in career matches, but most of the matches were close.\n\nAnastasia said: \"Amelie, great player. And I think she played pretty good today. I watched couple of games. I think she's really want to win here because she didn't really do well in Eastbourne. So I think she going to play really good tomorrow, and I have to do the same... I lost to her already here here couple years ago... (in 2002; Amelie defeated Anastasia 6-4, 6-2 in the 3rd round). Amelie really good player because she's coming to the net, she's serving pretty well. Her slice really good. So maybe if I put pressure on her with my return, I will keep her moving, then maybe I can win the match.\"\n\nMary said: \"I'm working really hard. Finally I'm able to work hard. I've always worked hard. Just when I had my injuries, I wasn't obviously able to. I had to take time off. Then coming back from that took quite a long time until I was able to train normally for me. So now I've been able to do that for almost a year. I feel really good. I definitely feel the difference. I see the difference. I feel that I'm on the right path. I feel like I'm actually improving every day... Being injured, not being able to be physically fit and in shape to play my game was very difficult for me. And now I'm able to do that. So I'm very, very happy with that...\n\nAbout playing Venus Williams in the quarterfinals on Tuesday, Mary said: \"I think the last time that Venus and I played was at the Olympics last year, and I won. It was on hard court. We've played so many times. She's beaten me; I've beaten her. Every match on grass is not easy. They're all difficult. Venus is an excellent player. Definitely on grass, it's a good surface for her with the fast pace. We know each other's games really well. I've seen her play. Obviously she's playing well to be here in the quarterfinals. I'm just going to do my usual thing, just play my game, see how it goes.\" interview\n\nLindsay said: \"It was really important for me to try and come back and kind of consolidate this great win I had yesterday, and not have a letdown, and try and continue to do the best I can. I figured I'd be a little bit tired. But I thought I handled it pretty well. Most importantly I feel healthy at this point. I have a day off. Hopefully everything will keep going the way it's been going...\n\n\"It was hard. I didn't feel at any point of the match that I really had any rhythm. The points were pretty short. We were both kind of making errors, some big serves. So it was just a totally different match in that regard. I don't think I got nearly as many returns in today as I was able to do yesterday, and really work my way into points. So I felt in that regard that it was a much more erratic match, where the points were just going fast, didn't know quite what was going to happen.\n\n\"Sometimes that's grass court tennis for you. Yesterday I played really well. Today maybe not as well. But did well enough... \"As I went into the tiebreak, I was wondering why we were in a tiebreak because I just served for the first set... I think [Svetlana is] a really great player. She goes for a lot of shots. I knew she'd come up with some fantastic winners, and I knew she'd give me some errors. The first few points of the tiebreak, I thought I played pretty solidly and was able to build a good lead, and that really helped.\n\n\"But she does go for a lot. Especially on grass when it's so quick, you get some bad bounces, I definitely got a lot of free points out there.\" interview\n\nThis match was very well played by both Maria & Nadia, with only 1 break of serve. Nadia hit only 16 unforced errors, and Maria only 13. Both players won over three quarters of their 1st serve points, but Maria got 73% of her 1st serves in the box, while Nadia made only 59% of hers good. Maria made only 4 trips to the net in the match, scoring on 3 of them, while Nadia was 10 of 13 in this department. match stats\n\nBBC game-by-game\n\nMaria won 2 important points on net cords in the final game of the match. The first negated a break point for Nadia, the second gave Maria match point. Maria said: \"When I was down a breakpoint, I told the ball to hit the net and roll over. That's what comes with experience [laughter]... I thanked the fairy for taking the ball and bringing it over the net. You know, this is tennis, and that's what happens. Sometimes it will go over and sometimes not, and you end up losing the match. Today it went into my favor.\" interview\n\nMaria will play Venus in a semifinal on Thursday. Maria won both of their previous meetings, in the quarterfinals in Zurich on an indoor hard court in 2004, 6-3, 6-4, and earlier this year in the semifinals of the NASDAQ-100 in Miami, also on a hard court, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nMaria said: [Venus] has a big game, is a great fighter... every opponent is so different. You just go out. It's hard to focus on your opponent. I only played her a few times. I think the main thing is she's a good athlete, she gets a lot of balls back and she's very tough... you've got to be ready for an extra ball.\"\n\nAmelie said: \"Not only on my serve, but also on the returning games, I was very aggressive. I knew I would have more opportunities on [Anastasia's] second serve especially. I really decided to put the pressure on her right from the first game, and make her play as many shots as I could-- especially to pass me. Much more comfortable on the court, much more in my rhythm, and really enjoying the game... I also mixed it up pretty well. Again, I think the way the courts are, you have to really mix it up-- come in but also stay back. Sometimes it's tough to come in. You really have to choose the right ball. I'm very satisfied about that, and was really able to choose the right ones to come in, so that was good.\" interview\n\nAnastasia said: \"[Amelie] played a little bit different than she used to play. She come a lot to the net. I think that was good for her because from the baseline, I felt much stronger, and a lot of rallies I won from the baseline. That's the only one thing that she should do is come to the net, and she did really well today.\"\n\nAnastasia did not mention her chronic right shoulder injury, or the left leg sprain which she dismissed on Monday, saying, \"it's okay\". Anastasia played 141 games and 2 tiebreakers in her 5 singles matches, plus 2 doubles matches and 1 mixed doubles match. She was oncourt over 9 hours.\n\nAnastasia said: \"I think I'm improved since even last year on grass. I'm a little bit tired from last week. I guess that should happen. I'm really happy with my game right now... I feel the ball much better. I'm more confident right now from baseline. Like I said, even today I felt stronger from the baseline when there was long rallies. So I'm really happy.\" interview Venus made 84% of her 1st serves good, one of the best performances of the entire tourney (Mary: 59%). Venus also won 79% of her 1st serve points (Mary: 67%), with 3 aces and only 1 double fault (Mary: 1 and 5). Mary did not hold a break point against Venus during the match. match stats\n\nVenus said: \"It was a tough tiebreak, it really was. It was a tough second set. I played really well in the first set. I think [Mary] played well, too, but maybe she just wasn't expecting me to play as well as I did. I had quite a few set points against me. To pull that out and not have to go to the third is really good. And, plus, she was playing unbelievable. I mean that could have been a final match, how well she played.\" interview\n\nAbout Thursday's semifinal, Venus said: \"I think [today's qf against Mary Pierce] was definitely a good match for me going into [the semi against Maria Sharapova] because they're both hard-hitters. And I think that was good preparation... [Maria] definitely strikes the ball well, is a very determined player. Just a good player all around.\"\n\nMary said: \"I had a difficult time getting going today in the beginning of the match. It took me a little while I think to get used to the elements and the environment. I hadn't played on that court in I think it's about five years. Usually we get to practise on the court sometimes before we can play on it, and I didn't get a chance to do that. So it took me a little bit just to get used to the environment.\n\n\"Venus played very well from the very beginning, was hitting very hard and very deep. I've already felt like last couple days that I was having a little bit of trouble getting going. My legs didn't feel totally powerful, dynamic today. If you're a little slow against someone who is going to be hitting very hard and aggressive and deep, it shows a lot more.\n\n\"Second set, I started to feel better and started to play better. I was making a lot of unforced errors, as well. That was my legs, just not moving. Second set, I started playing better. I still missed some shots that could have made a difference in maybe me winning the second set. If I win the second set, it's a totally different match.\n\n\"I try to learn some thing from every situation. I'll definitely watch the tape of this match. I was a little bit tired, and that played a big factor in that match today. And also Venus played great.\" interview"
