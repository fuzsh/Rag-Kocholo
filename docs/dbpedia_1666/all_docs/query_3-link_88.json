        "text": "1. William \"Bill\" Johnston\n\n“Little Bill” Johnston was considered the best tennis player from the United States until “Big Bill” Tilden took over that spot and began to defeat Johnston regularly.\n\nBut in this decade, Johnston was the superior player, and Tilden was just getting started.\n\nDeceiving opponents with his slight frame and frail health, Johnston possessed a wicked forehand, which was long considered the best of all time until Pancho Segura introduced the two-handed forehand into the game.\n\nTilden and Johnston battled it out in six U.S. Open Championships against each other with Tilden winning five of them.\n\nTogether the two also secured seven consecutive U.S. Davis Cup Championships, which remains a record today.\n\nIn addition to winning two U.S. Open Championships in 1915 and 1919, Johnston also won the Wimbledon trophy in 1923.\n\nHe was ranked world No. 1 in 1919 and again in 1922 sharing the ranking with Gerald Patterson and Bill Tilden respectively.\n\nJohnston continued to play tennis until 1928 when he retired.\n\n2. Maurice McLoughlin\n\nAlso playing tennis during this decade was Maurice McLoughlin. He came from out West—born in Carson City, Nevada. His nickname became the “California Comet.”\n\nMcLoughlin possessed a tremendous overhead that he used to his advantage complemented by a powerful serve.\n\nWinning the singles title at the U.S. Championships in both 1912 and 1913, McLoughlin also won the doubles competition from 1912 to 1914.\n\nIn 1913, McLoughlin reached the finals of Wimbledon where he lost in the challenge round to defending champion Tony Wilding—becoming the first U.S. player to reach the finals at the All England Club.\n\nMcLoughlin was ranked No. 1 in 1914 and retired from tennis in 1919.\n\n3. Richard Norris Williams\n\nRichard Norris Williams also won the U.S. Championships twice in this decade. He defeated Maurice McLoughlin in 1914 and Bill Johnston in 1916 in a hard fought five-set battle. Williams also reached the finals in 1913, losing to McLoughlin.\n\nWilliams won a doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1920 as well as doubles titles at the U.S. Championships in 1925 and 1926.\n\nIn 1912, he won a mixed-doubles title with Mary Kendall Brown at the U.S. Championships.\n\nWilliams served on the victorious Davis Cup in 1925 and 1926, playing doubles. In 1924 in Paris, Williams won a gold medal in mixed doubles with Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman.\n\nWhat is more, Williams survived the sinking of the Titanic, on board the liner during that famous disaster.\n\n1. Jack Kramer\n\nThis man probably did more for modern tennis than anyone living or dead.\n\nKramer fought hard to establish “Open” tennis for amateurs and professionals so that there was only one tour and the best tennis players met and played each other for equal prize money.\n\nIt took him until 1968 to usher in the “Open” era in tennis. Kramer also was responsible for founding the ATP.\n\nAt 6'2\", Kramer brought in the style of play that many modern players adopted––the serve and volley.\n\nHis powerful serve and his net play made many regard him as one the best tennis players ever on the men’s side of the game.\n\nKramer won the U.S. Open Championship in 1946 and 1947, defeating Tom Brown and Frank Parker, respectively. He was runner-up on the grass in New York in 1943 to Joseph Hunt.\n\nKramer won the U.S. Championships in doubles in 1940,1941, 1943 and 1947—winning doubles also at Wimbledon in 1946 and 1947.\n\nKramer also won the Wimbledon singles competition in 1947—ranked world No. 1 in that year.\n\nHe turned pro in 1947 and would go on to win two Pro-Slam titles in 1948 and 1949.\n\nDuring World War II, Kramer continued playing while serving in the United States Coast Guard.\n\n2. Frank Parker\n\nWhat distinguished Frank Parker from other champions besides his multiple appearances and wins at the U.S. Open?\n\nHe is one of the few men in the history of the game who managed to win both the French Open and the U.S. Open during his career.\n\nParker won two French Open titles in 1948 and 1949.\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Parker won the U.S. Open in 1944 and 1945. Additionally, he was the runner-up in 1942 to Ted Schroeder and in 1947 to Jack Kramer.\n\nWhat is more, Parker won his U.S. Open Championships while serving as a Sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Force.\n\nBesides winning singles titles, Parker also won three Grand Slam doubles titles at the U.S. Championships in 1943 and at the French Open and Wimbledon in 1949.\n\nHis career in tennis was a long one for that era lasting from 1933-1949, and he was known for his remarkable all-court game.\n\n3. Bobby Riggs\n\nYou may remember the name of Bobby Riggs in connection with his “Battle of the Sexes” match against Billie Jean King back in 1973 when Riggs was 55 years of age.\n\nHis challenge led to much needed favorable publicity for women’s tennis after Billie Jean King won the match.\n\nStill, in the 1940s Bobby Riggs was ranked World No. 1 for three years, two of those during his professional career, which began in 1941.\n\nHe won the Wimbledon title in 1939 by defeating Elwood Cooke of the United States in five sets––having supposedly bet on himself to capture all three titles at Wimbledon that year which he did.\n\nRiggs appeared in the the U.S. Open finals three consecutive years from 1939-1941. He won the Championship in 1939 by defeating Welby Van Horn and in 1941 by defeating Frank Kovacs. Riggs was the runner-up in 1940 to Don McNeil.\n\nHe also won Grand Slam mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1939 and at the U.S. Championships in 1940.\n\nThis colorful character was a great U.S. champion.\n\n1. Pancho Gonzales\n\nBecause of economic forces and the structure of tennis before 1968, Pancho Gonzalez played the most significant portion of his career as a professional where he reigned as world No. 1 for eight years against the best playing the game in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nGonzalez won the U.S. Open as an amateur in 1948 and 1949 during the earliest years of his 25 year career.\n\nHe also won 15 Pro-Slam titles. He was, to put it simply, an amazing tennis player regardless of the setting.\n\nHis serve was dominating as was his net play. These coupled with an intense drive to win made Gonzalez a champion and took him to the top of the sport.\n\nWhen the match was on the line, Gonzalez simply refused to lose. He slammed the door closed at the end of a match.\n\nThere simply were none his equal during this period.\n\n2. Tony Trabert\n\nTony Trabert turned pro in 1955 after having one of the greatest years ever in tennis history.\n\nHe won the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open and reached the semifinals of the Australian Open all in that calendar year.\n\nHe also won 18 tour titles in 1955, ending the year with a record of 106-17.\n\nTrabert was ranked No. 1 in doubles and singles in 1955.\n\nIn all, Trabert won five career Grand Slam singles titles because prior to 1955, Trabert won the U.S. Open in 1953 as well as the French Open in 1954.\n\nIn fact Trabert was the last American to win the French title (1955) until Michael Chang won it again in 1989.\n\nTrabert also won five Grand Slam doubles titles at the Australian Open in 1955, the French Open in 1950, 1954 and 1955, and the U.S. Open in 1954. Except for the French Open title in 1950 where he teamed with Bill Talbert, Trabert teamed with Vic Seixas to win the rest of his doubles titles.\n\nHe also won two Pro-Slam titles—the French Pro in 1956 and 1959.\n\nWhen Trabert retired from tennis, he went on to a successful career in broadcasting, starting in 1971.\n\n3. Vic Seixas\n\nVic Seixas also won majors during the 1950s. In 1953 he won the Wimbledon title and in 1954 Seixas won the U.S. Open championship. Seixas was a runner-up in slam finals three times.\n\nMost of Seixas wins, however came in doubles. In Grand Slams he won doubles titles five times and was the runner-up in three. He teamed most often with Tony Trabert but also won with Mervyn Rose at Wimbledon in 1952.\n\nSeixas also won Grand Slam mixed doubles titles—four at Wimbledon from 1953-1956 with Doris Hart and Shirley Fry and three at the U.S. Open in 1953-1955 with Doris Hart.\n\nAlong with Tony Trabert, Seixas helped the United States win the Davis Cup over Australia in 1954, and these were the years when Australia dominated.\n\nIn fact, Seixas is ranked fifth in Davis Cup singles competition with 24 match wins. Tilden is just ahead of him with 25 and Ashe leads with 27. He competed on the U.S. Davis Cup team from 1951-1957.\n\nMoreover, Seixas continued to compete until he was 46 years of age.\n\n1. Jimmy Connors\n\nAfter decades of domination by the Australians, tennis in the United States was beginning to thrive. No one embodied the spirit of this new tennis surge than up and coming James Scott Connors.\n\nConnors was a man driven to win at all odds. He pumped himself up by feeding on the notion that everything and everybody was against him. That mindset helped Connors to become a force in tennis for many, many years.\n\nConnors won five of his seven final appearances at the U.S. Open with an 85.2 total winning percentage (98-17).\n\nHe is the only male in the history of the U.S. Open to have won the title on three different surfaces––on grass, clay, and hard courts.\n\nHe won his first title in 1974 and his last in 1983. Connors played in 22 U.S. Opens starting in 1970, and he played his last in 1992 as he turned 40.\n\nJimbo loved playing in New York where he enjoyed his greatest success on tour even though at times he resented the lack of respect he detected from the American press when his career seemed down and out to them.\n\nIn 1974, Connors won three of the four majors—all but the French. It was his first U.S. Open final, and he smoked Ken Rosewall 6-1, 6-0, 6-1.\n\nHis next two U.S. Open wins came in 1976 on clay and 1978 on hard courts against another Connors arch-rival, Bjorn Borg.\n\nConnors went on to win another two finals against another No. 1 player, Ivan Lendl in 1982 and 1983, both four-setters.\n\nJimbo also lost two finals at the U.S. Open against Michael Orantes of Spain in 1975 and against Guillermo Vilas of Argentina in 1977.\n\nIn addition to his five U.S. Open titles, Connors owns two Wimbledon titles and one Australian Open title in singles. In doubles, Connors won at Wimbledon in 1973 and at the U.S. Open in 1975.\n\nHe achieved his first world No. 1 ranking in 1974 but would hold the top spot most of this decade.\n\nConnors will always have a place in the hearts of Americans as one of their greatest players.\n\n2. Stan Smith\n\nStan Smith enjoyed success in both singles and doubles on the men’s tour.\n\nHe played from 1972 until 1985 when Smith hung up his competitive racket.\n\nWhile he played, he won two major championships: the U.S. Open in 1972 over Jan Kodes and the 1970 Australian Open, defeating Ilie Nastase.\n\nSmith achieved the No. 1 ranking in 1972.\n\nWith his partner Bob Lutz, Smith won the U.S. Open doubles title four times in 1968, 1974, 1978, and 1980. The pair teamed to win the Australian Open in 1970.\n\nOnce he retired, Smith entered the coaching realm where he exerted a great deal of influence in American tennis.\n\n1. Pete Sampras\n\nAlthough most fans associate the Sampras aura with Wimbledon, his success at the U.S. Open remains truly remarkable. His appearance in eight finals is a record that will be hard to match, although Federer is still active and within two of reaching that mark.\n\nIn the Open era Sampras, with five championships, remains tied with Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer for the most victories at the U.S. Open, where Sampras holds an 88.75 winning percentage (71-9).\n\nSampras played at the U.S. Open 14 times, beginning in 1988, missing only one appearance in 1999 due to injury.\n\nSampras won his first title at age 19 and his last at age 31, both at the U.S. Open. In 1990, Sampras captured his first win over Andre Agassi in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. Pistol Pete won his second U.S. Open title in 1993 over France’s Cedric Pioline, seeded 15th. Sampras won back-to-back championships in 1995-1996 defeating fellow American Andre Agassi.\n\nIn 1996 Sampras defeated Michael Chang 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 to pick up his fourth U.S. Open title. The next title would not happen for six long years and would mark Sampras' fifth and final U.S. Open title in 2002. Standing across the net was the man he had beaten twice before for the title, Agassi.\n\nThe two Americans fought hard for four sets with Sampras coming out on top. After the 2002 U.S. Open concluded, Sampras decided to call it a career after winning his 14th major.\n\nTo date, Sampras holds the mantle in the eyes of most tennis authorities as the best so far to play the game of tennis at the U.S. Open on the center court at the Billie Jean National Tennis Center.\n\nSampras also won two Australian Open titles in 1994 and 1997 as well as seven Wimbledon titles won in 1993-1995 and 1997-2000. Sampras won 14 Grand Slam Singles titles but never managed to capture the French.\n\nIn all, most regard Sampras as the greatest U.S. champion.\n\n2. Andre Agassi\n\nAndre Agassi became the athlete who refused to quit.\n\nAlthough Agassi could fit into the decade of the 1990s as well as the 2000s, the most significant part of his career came during this decade.\n\nHe appeared at the U.S. Open 21 consecutive years with an 80.6 total winning percentage (79-19).\n\nAgassi played his first U.S. Open at age 16 in 1986 and his last in 2006 at age 36. In the end Agassi remained a favorite of the New York crowds, who grew to embrace this champion as Agassi matured.\n\nHis first U.S. Open victory came in 1994 as Agassi defeated German Michael Stich 6-1, 7-6, 7-5. Then in 1999, Agassi came out on top against fellow American Todd Martin 6-4, 6-7, 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 in a thrilling five-set match, which Agassi refused to lose.\n\nAgassi also lost in his last final appearance against Roger Federer in 2005 when Federer won his second consecutive New York title.\n\nAgassi also won the Australian Open title in 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003 as well as the French Open in 1999 and Wimbledon in 1992. Plus, Agassi won a gold medal for men's tennis in 1996 during the Summer Games in Atlanta.\n\nThe win in Paris in 1999 gave Agassi a career Golden Slam.\n\nAgassi will always be remembered for his competitive spirit, his brilliant return game, and his aggressive ground strokes.\n\n3. Jim Courier\n\nCurrent U.S. Davis Cup coach, Jim Courier is a former world No. 1 player who was born in Sanford, Florida. He reached the No. 1 ranking in 1992.\n\nCourier, who reached his peak in the early 1990s, played right-handed and employed a two-handed backhand.\n\nA steady and thoughtful player, Courier became a rare American who excelled on the red clay at Stade de Roland Garros.\n\nA contemporary of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, Courier maximized his strengths and worked his way to the top of the men’s game.\n\nHe won the Australian Open twice in 1992-1993, defeating Stefan Edberg in both years.\n\nCourier also won the French Open twice in 1991-1992, defeating Andre Agassi and Petr Korda, respectively.\n\nDuring his career, Courier won 23 titles, and was ranked No. 1 for a total of 58 weeks.\n\nCourier retired from tennis in 2000.\n\n4. Michael Chang\n\nMichael Chang was the youngest player ever to win a grand slam when he won the 1989 French Open at the age of 17. He defeated Stefan Edberg in a five-set final.\n\nBut most remember his epic five-set battle with Ivan Lendl in the fourth round. After winning that war, the young American advanced all the way to the championship match.\n\nIn 1996 Chang also reached the finals of the Australian Open and the U.S. Open losing to Boris Becker and Pete Sampras, respectively.\n\nChang had tremendous foot speed and remained tireless on court. Standing only 5’9\", Chang often had to run for his life to keep pace with his taller competitors.\n\nDuring his peak years, Chang remained in the top ten of men’s tennis.\n\nHis highest ranking was world No. 2, which he achieved in September of 1996.\n\n1. Andy Roddick\n\nOnce serve and volley tennis died, replaced by baseline, all-court tennis, the players from the United States took a back-seat to the Europeans who reigned throughout the majority of this decade.\n\nIn addition to Andre Agassi, whose career was receding and who never played serve and volley tennis, there was Andy Roddick.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Andy Roddick began playing professional tennis in 2000 at age 18.\n\nHe won his only grand slam championship in 2003, defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the finals of the U.S. Open. He ascended to the No. 1 ranking in November of 2003.\n\nRoddick also reached three finals at Wimbledon in 2004, 2005 and in 2009 where he lost each time to world No. 1 Roger Federer.\n\nPerhaps Roddick’s greatest contribution to U.S. tennis came during his participation in Davis Cup competition where the big serving Roddick helped keep the U.S. competitive, starting in 2001.\n\nThe U.S. Davis Cup team enjoyed their biggest triumph in 2007 when they faced Russia in Portland, Oregon, with a team which had Roddick as its undisputed leader.\n\nRoddick won the first point in the final and set the USA’s 32nd victory in the competition into motion. The match ended in a convincing 4-1 scoreline. Team USA had won the Davis Cup.\n\nIn total Roddick played in 45 matches in 25 ties—his record stands at 33-12.\n\nRoddick emerged on the scene during a major paradigm shift in men's tennis. The glory of days of serve and volley tennis essentially died with Pete Sampras. The game of big serves and minimal strokes would end as technology enhanced rackets and the courts slowed.\n\nRoddick's game was already fixed and suited his talents. Even though he worked tirelessly to improve his ground strokes and his movement, he never quite mastered them well enough after 2003 to reach to the top again.\n\nBut Roddick remained in the men's top 10 for a over decade and kept tennis alive and kicking in the U.S.\n\nWhat is next? Who will take the reins now that Roddick has retired. These are questions unanswered as we enter the third year of the current decade of tennis in the U.S."
