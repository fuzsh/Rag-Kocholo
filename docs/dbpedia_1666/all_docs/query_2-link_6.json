My friends in Dos Hermans who sent the moves every few hours for my www page, to Gerald Schendal who at the end of a long day came up with the games from the very strong Credis Tournament in Nussloch, to Lothar Karrer for the games from the BAWAG tournament. To Einar Karlsson, Carlos H. Taboada, Ricardo A. Fridman, Mart Tarmak, Yvette Nagel, Norbert Friedrich, Anjo Anjewierden, Jim Bach,Eugeni Grigorian for all that's new in the World of chess. This has been a great week. Very tiring as I updated my www page every day on Dos Hermanas. It will be some indication of how hard people are going to have to work on the Karpov-Kamsky match, its the waiting that hurts. Chess has a lot going for it at the moment, Dos Hermanas was a great tournament which will join an elite few others in chess history. But in the same week Credis served up some great chess in Nussloch. We have a lot to shout about and must start to promote the best of chess in the way that IBM promoted their Kasparov Deep Blue match, something which the chess World has been notoriously weak at. If the Las Palmas organiser's can realised their vision in November to get Kasparov, Karpov, Kramnik, Anand, Topalov and possibly Judit Polgar to play in a double round robin it ought to rank alongside AVRO 1938 as a defining moment in World Chess (Kamsky may force himself in their after his match against Karpov). Linares 1997 is a long way off but the list announced earlier this week is mouth watering: 1 Kramnik (Rus) 2775 2 Kasparov (Rus) 2775 3 Karpov (Rus) 2770 4 Ivanchuk (Ukr) 2735 5 Kamsky (USA) 2735 6 Anand (Ind) 2725 7 Topalov (Bul) 2700 8 Gelfand (Blr) 2700 9 Shirov (ESP) 2690 10 Judit Polgar (Hun) 2675 11 Short (Eng) 2665 12 Adams (Eng) 2660 13 Yusupov (Ger) 2655 14 (Pending 2645). They will have to sort some legal problems out with players who had a contract to play last year for it to go ahead in this form. One person who always attracts attention when he appears is the long lost Bobby Fischer. He is about to appear in Argentina to promote his new chess game FISCHERANDOM with a press conference later this month. I'm sure that he will manage to get coverage that most events only dream of. I grew up reading of his exploits and reading the book 60 Memorable Games. I don't however agree that chess needs randomising at the moment as the chess is so superb at the moment and showing no signs of imminant death. I do wish he'd come back and play the real thing. So on to next week, another TWIC and another great event. The FIDE World Championships is no side event, it will occupy centre stage over the coming month. I expect the match to be a very hard one. Hope you enjoy this issue. Mark 2) Dos Hermanas International Tournament. -------------------------------------- Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov both scored 6/9 to win this, the strongest tournament of the year so far. It is common in sport to hark back to a golden era when the players were better and how standards have declined. It is now time to start telling people that we are in another golden age, a piece of living history, and that the chess is good. Chess has had periods where few great talents have emerged and others where they have been in great numbers. The 1930's saw the rise of Flohr, Reshevsky, Smyslov, Fine, Botvinnik, Petrov, Najdorf, Szabo and a large number of other fine players who started to compete with the best of the players at the time such as Alekhine, Capablanca, Euwe and the rest. By the 1950's these were joined by the most stellar generation of them all. Spassky, Geller, Tal, Korchnoi, Petrosian, Larsen, Stein, and finally Fischer. They dominated chess for decades, Geller winning the last of his Russian Championships in 1980. It shows a lot of the weakness of the subsequent generation (Karpov excepted) that when Kasparov played through his only title qualification series he played both Korchnoi and in the final Smyslov. There were many good players around but few great. Now we have those names, and they are arriving by the truck load. This tournament brought together the modern greats, with only Karpov missing. Kramnik, Topalov, Anand, Kasparov, Kamsky and Ivanchuk are certainly great players, all but Kasparov are still improving, and in Topalov's case at an almost unbelievable rate. Gelfand is close to this group, Polgar the strongest Junior in the World (and the greatest women's player in history even if she never plays again) Shirov has some thinking to do and Illescas may be on the verge of something great too. This was a fine event, played hard and compares with anything that has gone before. My only worry about the event is that for a pure test it needs to be longer. Probably 14 rounds minimum, the old 28 round Candidates tests might be gone forever but a glorious feast could be had with a 10 player double round event. These are great times, do make sure they don't pass you by. Boris Spassky said that Kasparov wouldn't last ten years at the top, such was the energy of his chess, and the dedication of his preparation. He was probably correct that such a pace was impossible. Kasparov is not the player of old, but he could not be so, he had to slacken off and clearly has done so. His prodigious feats of memory and calculation were his hallmark, his all-round mastery of the game was astonishing. Since 1990 Kasparov has chosen tactics to be the predominant part of his game. We no longer see the all court game which was typified by his sheer control and mastery of 1.d4. He frequently won every game in a tournament with the white pieces, and he never lost with it. Then he took up 1.e4, this was more an indication of the kind of problems he wanted to set his opponents rather than a change in repertoire. He was happy to enguage in tactical slugfests with his opponents, and recently he has often either won quickly or drawn quickly with the white pieces. However in the last year he has shown hitherto unknown weaknesses in tactics and memory, he gives the impression of not having reworked his game to take account of this. Until recently Kasparov has easily retained his number one spot, his young rivals took turns to do well but still were not consistant. There are signs that Topalov, Kramnik and Anand may get the consistancy to exceed his rating soon. He will soon have to start taking care of business again by upping his effort levels to match theirs. One record has gone. Gary Kasparov lost only one game where he started 1.d4 since he became World Champion, that was against Karpov in their 1986 match. His last tournament loss with 1.d4 was, so far as I can assertain, way back in 1983 when he lost to Boris Spassky in the Niksic tournament. The game was an astonishing piece of bravado by Kramnik, he sacrificed a piece for a strong but nevertheless speculative attack. It seems that 23. Qe2 might have refuted it, certainly after 23. Nf3 there was no defence. Kramnik even missed mate in four starting with 29. ...Bd3+ but the method he chose was pretty safe. Kasparov improved (?) over Jakovich-Sorokin, Calcutta 1994 with 17 Be4 in this game. The following round saw a great battle between Judit Polgar and Gary Kasparov, Kasparov tried to kill Polgar but she found some nice defensive moves. They entered a drawn ending which Polgar defended well up to a point. She achieved Rook and Knight vs Rook. The trouble with this ending is that a bad move by the superior side just means that another method has to be found, a bad move by the inferior side is terminal. This is why the 50 move rule is so important. It gives the defending side something to aim for in what is a very stressful situation. But Judit didn't hang on, she could see the end coming and analysed the last few moves looking at the demonstration board rather than her opponent. They briefly analysed the game afterwards. Round 8 contained some fantastic chess. Kasparov may indeed have been much better against Topalov but the Bulgarian defended extremely coolly. Perhaps Kasparov lacked the direct approach at some point in the game. After 36. ...e5 he even had to be careful. Great chess. Kramnik brutely put Ivanchuk to the sword he only had a couple of minutes left at the end as he calculated forced mate. His previous 3 or 4 moves cost a well spent hour. Anand played a fine game against Gelfand who got into terrible time trouble. His move 40 lost because of a series of interlinking pins. Two of the three leaders had white, yet both seemed to struggle because of fine equalising preparation by their opponents. Draws were the consequence. Anand had Black. Kamsky wanted to get away for his match against Karpov which starts on the 6th in Elista, but he has bad relations with every top class player in the World, something he is going to have to do something about. Anand who has played some tough matches against Kamsky insisted on the game being played on the correct day. Kamsky came out fighting, first he arrived late and there was no handshake, then he went full speed for Anand's throat. When Anand resigned he simply stopped the clock and allowed the arbiter to record the result. Rustam Kamsky really must learn to keep his mouth shut if Gata is going to get future tournament invitations. His crude speech at the official dinner of the tournament where he compared Kasparov and Karpov to Hitler and Stalin was stupid, ignorant, extremely disrespectful to the organisers and sponsors of the event and just left a very nasty taste in the mouth. Even if he believes this, he is not going to get any friends at all by saying these things. The place to settle disputes with Kasparov and Karpov is over the board. So a fine event, the out of form Shirov probably playing the few truely bad games of the event (probably his game against Ivanchuk has to be the worst of the tournament) Polgar has shown she doesn't buckle easily and will be glad to have played this event as an element in her development. All this promises so much if the chess World can sort its terrible battles out it will be a hell of a World title series.

Karpov-Kamsky in Kalmykia ---------------------------------------------------------- Its nearly impossible to remember how this cycle started. The Interzonal was one which saw the demise of Ivanchuk and Anand waiting on the results of some all Russian pairings. It saw Kamsky recover from two down from three to play against Anand. The Candidates Final was held well over a year ago with Karpov beating Gelfand in a tough match in which Gelfand collapsed only at the end and saw Kamsky simply destroy an out of sorts Salov (whether he was out of sorts because of Kamsky's play or not is open to question.) Since then Kamsky has played only two tournaments and the big question is, what has he been doing? If Kamsky spent last year preparing for Karpov then he could be in for a very hard time. Karpov's repertoire is solid but lacking in any surprise at all. He knows it well, but as we saw in the Short match, there is a key to it. Kamsky had a hard time in Dos Hermanas, but this was not too much of a surprise, he was generally quite solid, his losses to Gelfand and Topalov were through his own blunders which is a worry as the sheer reliability of his game is his big asset. The win against Anand will have done his confidence good and in spite of the tournament being too close to his match against Karpov may have served to play him into form. Kamsky can take immense pressure without his play collapsing. In his two matches against Anand he was under pressure in almost every single game. Yet he won one of these matches and in the PCA match in spite of being under the cosh in most games only collapsed in the very last game of the match. If he can drag the match out with long games without blunders he may be in a position to cause Karpov some pain at the end of the match. Karpov is still Karpov. He has his own style and sticks to it. He is very hard to beat and very experienced. He is not quite as reliable as he used to be, this is the fate of all great players when they enter their forties, but the experience and knowledge is a great compensation. He probably starts as favourite but this may be based on the past not on the resective merits of their games. It seems to me that Dos Hermanas shows that those who have missed the last years tournaments where Kramnik, Topalov, Anand, Kasparov and Ivanchuk have been regulars are now at a disadvantage. Players like Short have done well in this school whereas Gelfand has just started to find his feet having missed out last year. Karpov and Kamsky have missed out and so their form is hard to guage. The battle will be a tough one. We will be well served during the match on the internet. I will probably put the games on my site at some time during the following day. There will be plenty of live or near live services to follow the games however. GM Yasser Seirawan will host on the Strategic Game Network (SGN) on weekdays lectures about the Karpov-Kamsky match. He will start June 6 (Thursday) from 4.00pm - 6.00pm PST. (This is midnight till 2.00am UK time). You can chat and see his analysis. Those who are interested have to download the Falcon Beta 2.01 chess player (this is free software) which can be obtained by going to: http://pegasus.grandmaster.bc.ca/FALCON/FALC.HTM If this for one reason or another doesn't work out try through http://www.tcc.net/chess/chess.html and look for Free Internet Software of Falcon Chess Player. Inside Chess will also have a degree of coverage: http://www.tcc.net/chess/chess.html ChessAssistant will have their new site up and running in time for the match at http://pc701-20.cs.msu.su This will have the moves in half hourly updates. The USCF page http://www.websong.com/uscf/ also promises live coverage (we really need to see in all cases what live means, Elista isn't the centre of the Universe!) Also ChessTreasure promises live coverage with commentary. http://www.netvision.net.il/~ChessTreasure Having tried to cover Dos Hermanas with regular updates I wish everyone luck, it is very tiring. 4) Bobby Fischer to visit Argentina -------------------------------- BOBBY FISCHER TO PRESENT THE WORLD-WIDE LAUNCH OF HIS NEW GAME IN ARGENTINA --------------------------------------------------------------------------- World Chess Champion Robert James Fischer will be arriving in our country Tuesday, June 18, having been specially invited by the Sports Institute of the Province (of Buenos Aires), to announce the world-wide launch of his new game: FISCHERANDOM. Other geniuses such as Emmanuel Lasker and Jose Raul Capablanca attempted unsuccessfully to revitalize chess with new rules. Now Fischer, after five centuries, gives life to a radical change that will shake the world. On Wednesday, June 19 (place to be named later), a press conference will take place that has three main objectives: 1) Confirm July 11, at Pasaje Dardo Rocha in the city of La Plata, Argentina as the chosen time and place for the presentation, 2) Make publicly known the rules of the new game, and 3) Present the participants of the First Exhibition Match: two-time Argentine champion Pablo Ricardi and the first Asian Grandmaster, Eugene Torre of the Philippines. Bobby Fischer, who caused a revolution with his new digital clock (used in the Return Match for the World Championship against Boris Spassky in Yugoslavia in 1992) has been working for years on this new form of chess to be presented here in our country. If we look back for the last change made in the scientific game, history takes us to 1492, when the Spaniard Ramirez de Lucena introduced castling in one move; previously it had taken two. The innovative American's decision to choose Argentina as the site for such a transcendental cultural and sporting event was due to the sincere admiration that Fischer professes for our country. He has visited on four prior occasions (1959, 1960, 1970, 1971) and the warm reception he always received here from chess fans led him to propose Buenos Aires as the location for the World Championship Match with Spassky in 1972. In the end, the match took place in Reykjavic, Iceland where Fischer took possession of the World Championship crown he has never relinquished. Fischer's next move, eagerly awaited by the entire world and bearing his hallmark of originality, will be made in Argentina. As only the greatest have done, he is moving the world forward.

The players take a break tomorrow (Saturday) and the last two rounds will be played on Sunday and Monday. Olafsson's opponents in the two remaining rounds are much weaker than his closest rivals. Hjartarson plays GM Stefansson and IM Thorhallsson (who in fact has made his 3rd GM norm but needs to lift his ELO above 2500 to get the GM title) while Olafsson's opponents are both under ELO 2300. Petursson and Stefansson are in 3rd place after 9 rounds with 6 points. So we are looking at a very exciting last two rounds.

The results were surprising. Despite the fact that the first three places guaranteed a place in the Estonian Olympic team for Yerevan the championship was one of the weakest ever (FIDE III category, average rating 2308). Only two of the ten best rated Estonian players (IMs Olav Sepp and Kaido K�laots) took part in the competition. Among the participants was IM Hillar K�rner many time Estonian champion who first time played at the championship in 1951. Sergei Zjukin and Hendrik Olde tied for first place and they will play the additional match of four games for the title. The third lucky player was Vladimir Zavoronkov, a young player from Narva. Zjukin was free in the last round and Olde had to draw with white pieces against Olav Sepp, the reigning and six times Estonian champion. The pre-tournament favourite Sepp played his last game in good positional style and won the game but may stay out of the Olympic selection. Two places in the team were given to the GMs Jaan Ehlvest and Lembit Oll and the team which include the three Championship medal winners together with the Board the Chess Federation will decide the six member of the team. Probably it will be IM Mihhail Rotsagov. Hendrik Olde, the young vice-president of the Estonian Chess Federation already made the statement to the press that he does not think that he is the right man to play against the world top players and this way in the team will be one place more for the Estonian IMs. At the last Olympiad Hendrik Olde was the captain of the successful Estonian women's team. They were in the sixth place but during the Moscow Olympiad the Estonian men team played even on the higher boards than the women but because of the modest finish they were on the places 15-18 together with Yugoslavia, Germany and Spain at the end. The games are electronically available thanks to Mr. Jaan Narva.

In all rating systems there seems to be a lag. Its surely the case that Topalov has been the best player over the last six months. The 7 members of the 2700 club now look clearly better than everyone else. Further down Short, Gelfand and Ehlvest have all done well competing with these players and of course Illescas has had a fantastic couple of tournaments in Madrid and Dos Hermanas in their company.

The tournament book contains all games and the most important games analysed by the participants. The language is Dutch, although the usage of figurine algebraic and Informant style symbols should give non-Dutch readers significant clues on the main variations. Those who cannot print PostScript can order the book by transferring DFL. 8,50 to ABN-AMRO bank, account 42.65.85.089, att. A. Anjewierden, Enschede. (NB. Printing the PostScript file yourself saves me a lot of hassle!) 12) Theoretical Review of a Dos Hermanas game by Norbert Friedrich -------------------------------------------------------------- For years most of the attention in one of the classical slav lines (1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5) was focused at 6.Ne5 e6 7.f3 Lb4 8.e4 Bxe4 with complicated play. Now interest seems to have switched to another piece sacrifice: 6.Ne5 e6 7.f3 c5 8.e4 cxd4 9.exf5 Nc6 which was first seen in Huebner-Smyslov 1983. Black hopes to draw a nearly equal ending. A problematic approach since he has a worse pawn structure and has to fight against the bishop pair. Topalov-Gelfand from Dos Hermanas 1996 gives a good illustration.

Extremely big scandal had been putting Vladimir Sakotic for the chief arbiter in the Festival. Sakotic, who is an international arbiter, created non-existant tournaments, where players received new titles and improved their rating, too. The most famous was \"Trimex\" tournament in Belgrade 1994. After this tournament two players received GM title and, when FIDE discovered it, they took away their GM title. Yugoslav Chess Federation punished Sakotic for it for only one year, not to be arbiter and, they never told FIDE. 14) 1st European Chess Club Cup for Women - final 96 by Sinisa Joksic ----------------------------------------------------------------- Smederevska Palanka (Yugoslavia) May 31. - June 2.
