Three million people trapped alive.” The big news in 2003 was that we hit the four million population mark, and more than half of that increase was due to immigration. (By 2009, that number climbed to 4.3 million.) Given that we have around 44 million sheep, one New Zealander still equates to a whole lot of fresh lamb. Look beyond the farm gate, though, and you’ll find we’ve caught up with the rest of the world. We may bob about at the bottom of the Southern Hemisphere, but it would be unfair to consider the country a backwater. New Zealand continues to notch up big gains in tourism, welcoming more than two million visitors a year, despite international upheavals like terrorist attacks, flu epidemics, and economic downturns. Tourism is our largest source of overseas income. International visitors contribute NZ$8.3 billion to the economy each year and the tourism sector at large contributes NZ$19 billion to the country’s economy annually. One in every 10 New Zealanders now works in the tourism industry. And we’re better equipped for tourists than ever. Efficient visitor centers abound, with accommodations ranging from budget to exclusive. You can shop 7 days a week, whoop it up at clubs and bars 24 hours a day, or savor a glass of internationally recognized New Zealand wine in an inexpensive cafe. You can get real coffee in as many variations as you can imagine, and New Zealand’s fresh, innovative cuisine will leave you breathless and begging for more. Even provincial New Zealand has pulled up its socks without losing its heart. Small-town pride is beaming, and farmers are turning their hands to boutique tour operations and gorgeous restored B&Bs to supplement farm incomes, changing the whole nature of many backwater rural districts. Yet you’ll still find, at its core, the very Kiwi hospitality that has made this country famous. You may have heard that New Zealanders are born wearing wet suits and carrying paddles, such is their appetite for the outdoors and adventure. No part of the country is more than 128km (79 miles) from the sea, and a coastline spread with splendid beaches dishes up thousands of beautiful coastal walks and chances to surf and soak in the sun. New Zealand is also a winter magnet for international skiers and is the white-knuckle capital of the world. This is where you can push it to the limits, pit yourself against your fears and limitations, take risk by the throat, and go for it—leaping off bridges into surging river gorges attached to a giant rubber band, or taking a stab at luging, Zorbing, sky diving, paragliding, kayaking, white-water rafting, and jet-boating. There’s no lack of invention when it comes to adrenaline-pumping activities in this country. But you don’t have to be an extreme athlete to enjoy New Zealand. There are just as many ways to be laid-back and indulgent—tour wineries that have stampeded their way to the top of world ratings in record time; take in the wealth of Polynesian and Maori culture that forms the backbone of an increasingly multicultural society; or check out the strong historic and architectural reminders of a colonial past. There are lush gardens, art\n\n1\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n2\n\nT H E M O S T U N F O R G E T TA B L E T R AV E L E X P E R I E N C E S\n\n1\n\ngalleries, museums, and plenty of one-off reminders that New Zealand is like no other place. I was born in New Zealand and despite frequent trips overseas, I can’t shake off the inherent sense of belonging here. This book presents “my” New Zealand. After many months traveling thousands of miles, testing mattresses, comparing prices, leaping off cliff tops (well, almost),\n\nspeeding up rivers, and eating and drinking in far too many restaurants, I am more convinced than ever that New Zealand is one of the quirkiest, quaintest, craziest places on earth. It’s one of the most favored destinations of the new millennium, and before you’ve even left here, you’ll want to come back. Dip into these pages, and you’ll see why.\n\n1 T H E M O S T U N F O R G E T TA B L E T R AV E L E X P E R I E N C E S • Swim with Sharks: You’ve got to be keen, I admit, but this can be done in perfect safety. You can come face to face with Jaws’s South Seas cousins in a tough metal cage in a knuckle-biting thrill just north of Gisborne. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 10. • Explore a Glacial Lake: There are few things as mind-blowing as taking a boat trip on Tasman Lake, on Aoraki/Mount Cook, sailing between towering ice cliffs and floating icebergs in total, surreal silence. It’s one of only three places in the world you can do a tour like this, so don’t miss it. See “Mount Cook” on p. 438 in chapter 16. • Whale-Watch in Kaikoura: When a mighty sperm whale flaps its tail at you, you won’t forget it in a hurry. These big sea monsters come to this particular stretch of water for a marine habitat rich in their kind of plankton. Don’t be surprised to see dolphins aplenty, too. See “Marine Experiences in Kaikoura” on p. 400 in chapter 14. • Take the Train: Rated one of the five most spectacular train journeys in the world, the TranzAlpine is an easy day trip that gives a dramatic introduction to the splendor of South Island landscapes. Tunnels, beech forests, viaducts, massive river gorges—they’re all there\n\nfor the taking. See “An Unforgettable Train Trip” on p. 385 in chapter 14. • Eat Bugs and Beetles at the Wildfoods Festival: Prime yourself! You’ll need culinary fortitude for this mindboggling event—you could be served up anything from wriggling grubs to the unmentionable body parts of a number of wild and not-so-wild animals. This is the West Coast at its most rugged best. See the “Wildfoods Festival” box on p. 416 in chapter 15. • Stalk Kiwis at Night: And I mean the birds! Get ready for surprises on this little southern adventure. It’s the only place in the country where you can creep about lonely beaches at night with flashlights and stealth and not get arrested! At the same time, you’ll be one of the lucky few who get to see a wild kiwi foraging for its supper among the seaweed. See “Making a Date with a Kiwi” on p. 509 in chapter 17. • Walk Around Sky Tower: And I mean from the top, not at ground level. See how brave you really are when it comes to walking around the thin perimeter ring of one of the tallest towers in the Southern Hemisphere. The fearless will be rewarded with amazing views; the terrified can cower inside the viewing level. See “Sky Jump” on p. 142 in chapter 6.\n\nNorth Island at a Glance 175˚ E\n\nCape Reinga\n\nNorth Cape\n\nWellington\n\nMangonui 10\n\nKaitaia\n\nSOUTH ISLAND\n\nKerikeri Bay of Islands\n\nChristchurch Dunedin\n\nWhangarei\n\n12\n\n14 1\n\nDargaville\n\nGreat Barrier Island\n\nP A C I F I C\n\nWarkworth Hauraki Kaiparu 16 Gulf Harbour Orewa Auckland\n\nCoromandel Peninsula Whitianga\n\nCoromandel Forest Park\n\n25\n\nThames Ngaruawahia\n\nLake Rotorua\n\n30\n\n1\n\nMt.

Do this in Rotorua as part of an organized\n\ntour experience, or seek permission to visit one of the dozens of East Cape marae (village common). See “Rotorua” in chapter 9 and “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 10.\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n2 T H E B E S T B E AC H E S\n\nT H E B E S T AC T I V E VAC AT I O N S\n\n1\n\n• Waiheke Island’s Onetangi Bay: Stand on the bay’s wide stretch of golden sand, and you can see for miles. On a clear day, throw yourself down into the sand and gaze at the steep pinnacles of Great Barrier Island and Little Barrier, off in the hazy distance. There might even be a few glimpses of the Coromandel in between deliciously warm swims. See “A Side Trip to Waiheke Island” in chapter 6. • Karikari Peninsula’s Beaches: This is the Far North at its subtropical best— endless sweeps of sparkling white sand lapped by crystal-clear, azure-blue waters. And from Tokerau Beach to Rangiputa to Matai Bay, you could have miles of it to yourself for beachcombing, sunbathing, and swimming (with care). See “Bay of Islands & the Far North” in chapter 7. • Coopers Beach: Partly shaded by a bank of red-emblazoned pohutukawa trees, how could you not be content to stretch out here? Exercise? A walk to the water should do it! See “Bay of Islands & the Far North” in chapter 7. • Hot Water Beach: Don’t ask me why, or how, but if you get here 2 hours before or after low tide, you can hollow out a spot on the beach for yourself, and then wait for natural hot water to seep up through the sand. A natural spa experience\n\nwithout paying a cent! See “The Coromandel Peninsula” in chapter 7. • Mount Maunganui’s Ocean Beach: Surf, sand, and sun—some people never want more than that. Throw on a bit of suntan lotion, a pair of sunglasses, and a skimpy swimsuit, and you’ll be able to mix in with the best of the bronzed bodies that make an annual pilgrimage to this perennial beach and surf favorite. See “Tauranga & Bay of Plenty” in chapter 8. • Kaiteriteri Beach: Half of Canterbury makes a beeline for these blissful shores every summer. It’s not expansive—in fact it’s quite small, but perfectly formed nonetheless, and there’s a busy vacation atmosphere with packed campgrounds and holiday houses. And with Nelson’s endless hours of sunshine, who could complain about size? See “Nelson, Richmond & Motueka” in chapter 13. • Abel Tasman National Park’s Beaches: Bush-wrapped and locked between rocky headlands, these idyllic golden patches from Marahau north to Totaranui are accessible by sea only. That’s what makes them so special. Gliding through the turquoise waters in your sea kayak, with curious seals to keep you company, you can take your pick of isolated havens. See “Abel Tasman National Park & Golden Bay” in chapter 13.\n\n3 T H E B E S T AC T I V E VAC AT I O N S • Scuba Diving in the Poor Knights: Jacques Yves Cousteau rated this among\n\nthe best diving spots in the world.

See “Into the Deep Blue Sea” on p. 189. • Blackwater Rafting in the Waitomo Glowworm Caves: Daredevils can now go underground to leap off waterfalls; slink through dark, damp, underground waterways; rappel off Lost World rock faces; and do other things in the dark. See “Hamilton & the Waikato” in chapter 8. • Trout Fishing in Taupo: They say the fish in Lake Taupo are so big that when you catch one, the lake level drops. The dozens of other rivers (especially worldrenowned Tongariro) and streams in the region also have rich pickings for the fisherman. See “Taupo” in chapter 9. • Sea Kayaking in Abel Tasman National Park: It takes a lot to beat this balmy little paddle into the best-preserved and most beautiful coastline of New Zealand. Keep company with nosy seal pups and dolphins; call into pristine, deserted beaches; and explore rocky headlands. See “Abel Tasman National Park & Golden Bay” in chapter 13.\n\n• Walking the Glaciers: Dig out those snow boots and walking poles, add a dash of nerve and daring, and take the walk of a lifetime down Fox or Franz Josef glaciers in the deep south. And don’t forget your camera so you can bring home those unforgettable views into the snow caves. See “Franz Josef & Fox Glaciers” in chapter 15. • Getting Wild in Queenstown: This is New Zealand’s adrenaline capital, where you get more than one chance to show how crazy you really are. There are more daredevil stunts per square inch here than anywhere else in the country. An international skiing mecca in winter, it readily transforms itself into summer madness as well. See “Queenstown” in chapter 16. • Walking the Fiordland Tracks: If you fancy yourself as a multiday tramper, there’s plenty to keep you out of mischief in Fiordland. This is where you get some of the best walks in the world—the Milford, the Hollyford, the Kepler, and the Routeburn tracks. See “Tramping” in chapter 5 and “Te Anau” in chapter 16.\n\n4 T H E B E S T O F N AT U R A L N E W Z E A L A N D • Ninety Mile Beach and Cape Reinga: From the spiritual tip of the North Island where, Maori say, the souls of the dead depart, to mountainous sand dunes, quicksand, and the broad flat stretch of Ninety Mile Beach, this is a must-see area filled with the unexpected. See “Bay of Islands & the Far North” in chapter 7. • Waiotapu Thermal Wonderland: The earth’s molten core hints at its artistic potential in a veritable rainbow of color and steamy chaos manifested in geysers, mud pools, hot bubbling lakes, steamy terraces, and more. A photographer’s paradise, but tread carefully. See “Bubble,\n\nBubble, Toil & Trouble: The Geothermal Attractions” on p. 224. • Tongariro National Park: Three major volcanoes dominate a rugged central plateau landscape: Ruapehu, Tongariro, and Ngauruhoe. An indomitable threesome, they’re rife with Maori legend and rich in a few modern stories as well. Great for skiers, trampers, and anyone else wanting a physical challenge. See “Tongariro National Park” in chapter 9. • Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers: This is one of the very few places on earth where you’ll find full-fledged glaciers this close to the ocean. In a slow, ever-onward creep, they make their way from the\n\nwaterfalls, wild beaches, unforgettable tangles of driftwood, and a frustratingly changeable climate—the area takes a lot of beating, but the resulting dramatic impact is unforgettable. See “Dunedin” in chapter 17. • Ulva Island: Tucked into Stewart Island’s Paterson Inlet, tiny Ulva Island will leave you speechless with its incredible native bird life. It’s wall-to-wall feathers here—and what’s more, they’re not afraid of humans. Don’t go without your camera; you’ll need evidence once you start telling friends back home about it. See “Stewart Island” in chapter 17.\n\n5 THE BEST TRAMPS • The Milford Track: The mother of them all, the Milford is one of the world’s best and most-loved multiday tramps. Stretching through the best of Fiordland, this 54km (33-mile) trail follows the Clinton and Arthur valleys and crosses McKinnon Pass with views you’ll never forget. See “Te Anau” in chapter 16. • The Routeburn Track: Like the Milford and the Hollyford before it, this track makes its way into virgin rainforest and the sort of wild fairyland scenery where you’d expect to see elves and gnomes prancing around. See “Queenstown” in chapter 16. • The North West Circuit: This is a real test for experienced trampers who think they can face 10 to 12 days walking 125km (78 miles) through bird-filled native bush, big beaches, and long stretches knee-deep in mud. I’m told the rewards are plenty. See “Stewart Island” in chapter 17.\n\n1 THE BEST TRAMPS\n\nFor details, see “Tramping” in chapter 5. • Tongariro Crossing: Often described as one of the best 1-day walks in New Zealand, this high-altitude hike across volcanic terrain will give you cold mountain springs, lava flows, an active crater, emerald-colored crater lakes, and unforgettable views. Ideal for the fit and enthusiastic hiker. See “Tongariro National Park” in chapter 9. • The Abel Tasman Coastal Track: This is an easy 3- to 5-day walk where the guided option gives you the choice of ditching those hefty packs. From start to finish, 52km (32 miles) later, it winds in and out of gorgeous sheltered coves, golden beaches, rocky headlands, and natural unspoiled bush. See “Abel Tasman National Park & Golden Bay” in chapter 13. • The Heaphy Track: No softy guided options here: You go it alone for 4 to 6 days from the junction of the Brown and Aorere rivers, across tussock-covered flats to the wild seas of Karamea on the West Coast. See “Westport & Karamea” in chapter 15.\n\n7\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\nheights of the Southern Alps down into untouched rainforest. See “Franz Josef & Fox Glaciers” in chapter 15. • Fiordland: Come here on a wet day (and that’s easy because this place gets the most rainfall in New Zealand), and you’ll think you’ve stepped into the living set of The Lord of the Rings. This place defies all superlatives. It is the ultimate must-see. See “Te Anau” in chapter 16. • The Catlins Coast: This is wild, natural New Zealand at its unspoiled best. From unique fossil forests to all manner of seabirds and mammals, native bush,\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n8\n\nTHE BEST DRIVES\n\n1\n\n6 THE BEST VIEWS • Sky Tower: The paramount city view in not only New Zealand, but also the entire Southern Hemisphere. Once you get out of that glass-faced lift 328m (1,076 ft.) above the city, you’ll know just what I mean. Fabulous 360-degree views of Auckland unfold below, and you can test your courage by walking over glass floors! See p. 141. • Hicks Bay: Stop at the high point above Hicks Bay before you descend into Te Araroa to see New Zealand’s largest pohutukawa tree and the East Cape Lighthouse. Resting awhile, high up between the two bays, see if you can imagine Captain Cook’s expression when he first sighted the area, and his relief to be leaving again after a tragic Maori massacre in which one European was killed and eaten on his wedding night. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 10. • Hastings’s Te Mata Peak: A big “sleeping giant” of a hill, 393m (1,289-ft.) high, Te Mata affords big views of endless green and brown undulations, reaching all the way to the coast. Havelock North, Hastings, and Napier all blend together below. See “Hawke’s Bay” in chapter 10. • Wellington’s Kelburn Cable Car: Not so far above the capital’s busy shopping\n\nstreets, you’ll be rewarded with postcard-perfect vistas of glass-faced highrises silhouetted against the harbor. Step off the cute red cable car into the verdant acres of the Botanical Gardens and look seaward. No matter what the weather, the view is always memorable. See p. 307. • Queenstown’s Skyline Gondola: It’s everybody’s aim to get high in Queenstown one way or another. Make yours by way of a smooth gondola ride to the top of Bob’s Peak. Step out into the cool, crisp, exceedingly fresh air with New Zealand’s playground spread out at your feet. The Remarkables will keep the view in check, and Lake Wakatipu will be a big blue basin below. See “Queenstown” in chapter 16. • Nugget Point: You may not have seen another human being for hours by the time you make your way to the lookout above Nugget Point. And once you’ve experienced the blissful solitude of standing on this wild, wind-swept Catlins promontory, you probably won’t care if you don’t see anyone for several more. Thick, swirling masses of kelp, seals, penguins, and seabirds are here by the hundreds. See “Dunedin” in chapter 17.\n\n7 THE BEST DRIVES • Auckland City to Mission Bay: This is the stuff of a weekend afternoon spin to see how the other half lives. Best done in a Ferrari, a BMW, an Audi, or an equally cool classic if you want to leave a lasting impression. Tight shorts and in-line skates do the trick just as well if you want a cheaper set of wheels. Do the cafe crawl; join the walkers, the runners, and the dog strollers; or just drool\n\nover million-dollar real estate. See “Orientation” in chapter 6. • Rotorua’s Blue and Green Lakes: From the stately redwood forest on the edge of town, all the way past the Blue and Green lakes to the Buried Village and Lake Tarawera and back again, you’ll squeal with delight at a dozen different things. There are lots of picnic spots on the way, but the Landing Café at Lake Tarawera is\n\n8 THE BEST GARDENS • Hamilton Gardens: Stretched along the banks of the Waikato River, this blissful, relatively new 58-hectare (143acre) reserve is a lovely place to wander and picnic. Development began around 30 years ago; there’s now a well-established Asian garden, English garden, herb and scented gardens, and lavish stands of trees. See “Hamilton & the Waikato” in chapter 8. • Eastwoodhill Arboretum: One of the most magical places in the country, hardly a garden by normal standards, this astounding collection—the best in New Zealand—is one man’s life’s work and presents over 3,500 species often studied by international scientists. Go\n\nin autumn for unforgettable color displays—and bring a camera. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 10. • Pukeiti Rhododendron Trust: Here you get a world-class collection of rhododendrons, viraya, and azaleas set in a centuries-old forest near Mount Egmont—our little Mount Fuji. The gardens spread over many acres in a lovely rural setting 30 minutes from New Plymouth. See “New Plymouth: Gateway to Egmont National Park” in chapter 11. • Christchurch’s Botanic Gardens: Regardless of the season, this centralcity acreage has plenty to offer, but it’s quintessentially Christchurch when the\n\n9\n\n1 THE BEST GARDENS\n\n• Greymouth to Westport: Pretty, pretty, pretty! Nikau palms, native bush, tree ferns, jagged rocks, roaring surf, and the big blue Tasman Sea combine to make this a lovely half-day outing. Be sure to stop at the famous Punakaiki Pancake Rocks, where blowholes have a spectacular hissy fit as the ocean roars into, under, and around rocky caverns on the coast. See “Westport & Karamea” in chapter 15. • The Famous Milford Road: Even the Wanaka-Haast road can’t match the splendor of this one. It’s been called one of the best drives in the world, and no amount of raving can do it justice. You really have to experience it. Virgin rainforest, mirrorlike lakes, astounding waterfalls (especially during rain), beech forest, mountains of moss, bright orange lichens, and sheer mountain faces thousands of feet high contribute to the overall picture—not to mention the slightly daunting Homer Tunnel. See “Milford Sound” in chapter 16.\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\na good bet if you forget the hamper. See “Rotorua” in chapter 9. • The Capital to Mellow Martinborough: Once you’ve left the motorways behind, you’ll be up and over the winding Rimutaka Hill Road in little more than 40 minutes. Then it’s downhill all the way to Martinborough’s enchanting pocket of prizewinning wineries. Surrender to hedonism and squander time in idyllic vineyard settings. Make the only exercise you do raising your glass, or at most a wee stroll through pretty little Martinborough Village, where cute shops await. See “A Side Trip to Wairarapa” in chapter 12. • Queen Charlotte Sound: Take the scenic loop from Picton to the little fishing village of Havelock and back to Picton on the main highway. Stop and admire the bush-clad sounds and the boats, and indulge in fresh green-lipped mussels grown in these very waters at the Mussel Boys restaurant, in Havelock. It’s a narrow winding road around the Sounds, so take it quietly. See “Picton & Blenheim” in chapter 13.\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n10\n\nTHE BEST MUSEUMS\n\n1\n\ndaffodils and bluebells bloom under the huge oak trees along the Avon River and avenues of weeping cherries burst into color. This is when people think of England. See p. 376. • Mona Vale: This little beauty is often overlooked in favor of the city’s Botanical Gardens, but it has an intimate charm all its own. Spreading out around a stately Victorian home, these public gardens have myriad lovely features, including iris collections along stream banks, fountains, hostas by the yard, and that old favorite, the rose, which does so well in Canterbury. See “Exploring Christchurch” in chapter 14. • Ohinetahi: If you’re a garden fan, this is a must. Formal, architectural, and\n\nstately are all words that instantly spring to mind. Definitely English-inspired and modeled after the best of England’s stately gardens, with quirky New Zealand modifications. See “Exploring Christchurch” in chapter 14. • Dunedin Chinese Garden: Here is an unexpected chance to see one of just three truly authentic Chinese gardens created outside of China. Built in Shanghai by Chinese artisans, the garden was dismantled and then shipped to Dunedin, where it was reconstructed under the supervision of Chinese craftsmen. This is a beautiful addition to this southern city’s quirky list of attractions. See “Parks & Gardens” on p. 486.\n\n9 THE BEST MUSEUMS • Auckland Museum: After a very significant internal revamp, this museum is everything you’d want in a city’s storehouse of treasures: fun, interactive, attractive, informative, and filled with interesting collections. Its Maori and Polynesian section, the biggest in the world, sends shivers down your spine; if you’ve got kids, let them loose in the Discovery Centre, where they can legally stick their fingers into just about anything. See p. 140 in chapter 6. • New Zealand National Maritime Museum: At the pinnacle of New Zealand’s boating history—with the America’s Cup Challenge right in our backyard—the Maritime Museum is booming. Look for KZ1 outside, and inside discover 1,000 years of the country’s maritime history. See sail makers, boat builders, and wood-turners at work and take a cruise on one of the vessels. See p. 144 in chapter 6. • Museum of New Zealand—Te Papa Tongarewa: One of the largest national\n\nmuseums in the world, this giant new edifice on Wellington’s waterfront is said to be 5 years ahead of anything else like it. Truly bicultural, it’s a magical place where art and artifacts meet technological brilliance, creating riveting displays and interactive playthings for all ages. You’ll find everything from a whale skeleton and a working Maori marae to art collections and virtual-reality diversions. See p. 306 in chapter 12. • Canterbury Museum and the International Antarctic Centre: Although these two museums are completely separate entities located miles apart, together they present a terrific overview of life and history in Antarctica. Nowhere else in the world will you find this much gathered information about the great icy continent. There’s everything from wildlife displays to human exploration accounts and a real ice chamber so you can get the feel of life in subzero temperatures. See p. 375 and p. 376 in chapter 14.\n\n1 0 T H E B E S T M AO R I E X P E R I E N C E S\n\n11 THE BEST B&Bs • A-Kahu (Rotorua; & 07/347-4148): I had one of the best B&B stays in New Zealand with Kiri Atkinson-Crean and her husband Nigel Crean—a young, contemporary Maori couple, who will give you a real insight into what it means to be Maori in modern New Zealand. On top of that, their beds and rooms are divine, the food is fantastic, and there is laughter aplenty. See p. 231. • Booklovers Bed and Breakfast (Wellington; & 04/384-2714): Journalist and author Jane Tolerton is a woman with a passion for history and the astonishing book collection to prove it. Her charming city villa bulges with books and her rooms are large, comfortable, and close to town. See p. 299.\n\n• Glendinning House (Dunedin; & 03/ 477-8262): Sandy Black and Jocelyn Robinson live in an elegant brick mansion in the nicest part of town. Jocelyn, a former caterer, tempts guests with ongoing edible treats. Rooms are huge and are the perfect place to imagine life as a wealthy colonialist. See p. 493. • Elgin House (Dunedin; & 03/4530004): Roger and Carolyn Rennie have mastered the art of spoiling their guests, and their gorgeous old three-story home is riddled with character, history, charm, and hospitality. Don’t miss it! See p. 492. • Pencarrow (Queenstown; & 03/4428938): You’ll have to completely revise your benchmark for service and value\n\n1 THE BEST B&BS\n\nas it used to be pre-European settlement. You’ll tour the village with a Maori elder, learn the ancient myths, watch a traditional performance, and eat from a traditional hangi. See “Rotorua” in chapter 9. • Whakarewarewa Thermal Village: This small village of just 70 or so people has a 300-year history of settlement. It’s probably the only place in the world where people live in such proximity to geothermal activity and still harness the natural forces of the earth for washing and cooking. See “Rotorua” in chapter 9. • East Cape: This is a remote enclave of Maori culture—one of the last places in New Zealand where the Maori language is part of everyday life. You’ll find more than 100 marae scattered along the length of the East Cape Road, and if you ask permission, in most cases you’ll be allowed to enter. There are numerous Maori settlements and highly decorative Maori churches. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 10.\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n• Auckland Museum: This is the perfect place for an early lesson in things Maori. The recently revamped museum has the largest collection of Maori artifacts in the world. Large war canoes, meetinghouses, greenstone weapons, and feather cloaks are here. On top of that, the Manaia Maori Performance Group puts on a stunning show three times a day. See p. 140. • Te Puia’s Whakarewarewa Thermal Reserve and New Zealand Maori Arts & Crafts Institute: Maori guides will lead you through the thermal reserve, explaining the significance of the area to the Maori people. There’s also a live song-and-dance performance, a tour of a replica Maori village, and the chance to watch working weavers and carvers in the Arts & Crafts Institute, which was set up in 1963 to foster traditional craft skills. See p. 221. • Tamaki Maori Village: This re-created ancient Maori village presents Maori life\n\n11\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n12\n\nT H E B E S T LU X U R Y ACCO M M O D AT I O N S\n\n1\n\nfor money after staying with Bill and Kari Moers. They give a whole new meaning to guest comforts, and I think they should give lessons to B&Bs everywhere. See p. 458. • Waiorau Homestead (Wanaka; & 03/ 443-2225): Get a taste of the country in this beautifully restored homestead, where chef Blyth Adams and his wife, Ann Lockhart, will spoil you rotten. Modern comforts prevail against a\n\nbackdrop of rural history and spectacular scenery. See p. 436. • Maison de la Mer (Akaroa; & 03/3048907): If you want to know how a top B&B should be run, visit the experts. Bruce and Carol Hyland have hosted over 14,000 guests during their tenure in the hospitality industry, and their new Akaroa venture is as luscious as their last. You’d be silly to miss it. See p. 395.\n\n1 2 T H E B E S T LU X U R Y ACCO M M O D AT I O N S • Kauri Cliffs (Kerikeri; & 09/407-0010): I could find no fault whatsoever with this sublime northern retreat. It is, as the saying goes, “heaven on a stick,” and I’m not even a golfer! The staff here are some of the friendliest in the country and the rooms—especially the bathrooms—are my idea of true luxury. See p. 184. • Eagles Nest (Russell; & 09/4038333): Combine the very best of international taste with the magic of Northland’s subtropical environment and a rich vein of natural energy, and you get a luxury retreat quite unlike any other in New Zealand. Daniel and Sandie Biskind have created a worldclass retreat worthy of anyone’s prolonged attention. See p. 184. • Huka Lodge (Taupo; & 07/3785791): Exclusivity reigns supreme at this Small Luxury Hotels of the World member. International awards bounce off the walls, and guests invariably comment on rooms fit for kings. It has a supreme location beside the Waikato River just above the Huka Falls and a reputation for quality and service that seems impossible to shake. See p. 242. • Treetops Lodge & Estate (Rotorua; & 07/333-2066): My expectations may never be the same again after staying at Treetops. Being spoiled with one of the most gorgeous suites in the country tends to have that effect. Set in a\n\nunique native bush environment, it’s a true sanctuary that will lower your heart rate within minutes of arriving. See p. 230. • The Farm at Cape Kidnappers (Hawke’s Bay; & 06/875-1900): Like its big sister, Kauri Cliffs, this stay richly deserves all the superlatives. It’s a case of “your wish is our command” here and if you’re a golfer, you’ll love what is rated the 10th best course in the world outside the U.S. The cliff-edge, rural setting is to die for. See p. 269. • Eichardt’s Private Hotel (Queenstown; & 03/441-0450): This new Small Luxury Hotels of the World member has received glowing accolades in Andrew Harper’s Hideaway Report, and it’s becoming the hotel of choice for discerning, upscale travelers. In a remodeled historic building in central Queenstown, it oozes first-class style and understated glamour. It remains one of my favorites. See p. 457. • Blanket Bay (Queenstown; & 03/4429442): If you want luxury on a grand scale in a majestic setting to match, look no further than Blanket Bay. These gorgeous stone buildings marry so completely with the awesome landscape, it seems as if they were always here. Inside, you’ll find an outstanding level of service and comfort. What more could you want?

See p. 300. • Arrowtown House (Arrowtown; & 03/ 441-6008): This brand-new boutique hotel is the third brainchild of seasoned travelers and hosts alike, Steve and Jeanette Brough, who are two of the best hosts in the country. Located in a pretty, tree-lined residential street, it’s an understated haven within a short walk of the village. See p. 461. • River Birches (Turangi; & 0800/102025): This is one of my favorite new discoveries. Transplanted New Yorker Jason Bleibtreu and his wife Rebecca— both former journalists covering the world’s hot spots—have spent years living in hotels, so they know exactly what it takes to create a restful haven. They’ve imbued this special place with an extra level of professionalism that’s hard to fault. And the location? Right beside one of the best trout-fishing rivers in the world! See p. 245. • Remarkables Lodge (Queenstown; & 03/442-2720): Brian Savage and Colleen Ryan sailed the world for 10 years chartering their yacht. We can be thankful they came ashore in Queenstown and took this well-established lodge and shook it by the scruff of the neck. With new life and an understated level of class that puts it above many, it’s a top retreat tucked into the foot of the very remarkable Remarkables mountains. See p. 460.\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n• Te Whau Lodge (Waiheke Island; & 09/372-2288): Every time I visit Te Whau I’m convinced all over again that Gene O’Neill and Liz Eglinton give you the best of everything—winning personalities, fabulous food, great rooms, and views you won’t believe. There’s something quintessentially Kiwi about the whole experience that I’m proud to recommend. See p. 165. • Ridge Country Retreat (Tauranga; & 07/542-1301): The generosity and style of rooms here leave many more expensive stays in the shade. Joanne O’Keeffe and Penny Oxnam were some of the best (and funniest) hosts on my last road trip, and I’m confident your expectations will be exceeded at every level. The food is divine! See p. 213. • Millar Road (Hastings; & 06/8751977): Waking up to staggering views over vineyards, orchards, and rolling green hills is only part of the pleasure of this exquisite stay. Somewhere between lodge and B&B, these two modern, self-contained “cottages” are divine. I can’t get the memory of them out of my head. It’s a classy, unexpected gem filled with contemporary New Zealand art, and I know you’ll want to stay at least a week! See p. 270. • Ohtel (Wellington; & 04/803-0600): I couldn’t believe my luck when I found this small, chic, ecofriendly, waterfront hotel packed to the gills with collectible mid-century modern furniture.

Consistently rated one of Auckland’s best and most romantic restaurants, this little den will take your taste buds to new, dizzying heights. See p. 135. • DINE By Peter Gordon (Auckland; & 09/363-7030): This sleek, dimly lit culinary “palace” is the new playground of London/New Zealand celebrity chef Peter Gordon. Set in the new SKYCITY Grand Hotel, it’s fusion cuisine at its best. Just make sure you save a few good breaths for gasping at the bill. See p. 135. • Logan Brown (Wellington; & 04/8015114): Located in a restored bank building on the edge of the red-light district, this restaurant is guaranteed to exceed your expectations. Consistently voted one of the capital’s best eateries— for its service and its delicious focus on\n\ntop meat cuts and wild game—it shouldn’t be bypassed. See p. 301. • Herzog (Blenheim; & 03/572-8770): Expect the very best from this winery and restaurant that has been held up by New York’s Wine Spectator for its impressive stock of around 3,200 of the world’s best wines. It’s a fine-dining experience you won’t forget in a hurry. See p. 334. • Rotherams (Christchurch; & 03/3415142): Swiss-born chef Martin Weiss has mastered the art of stunning his hungry patrons. In an interior that’s all about romance and special occasions, he presents meals that excel in both presentation and taste. Not to be missed—likewise the extensive wine list. See p. 372. • The Bunker (Queenstown; & 03/4418030): Don’t start celebrating until you’ve actually found it and are sitting at one of its tables! Notoriously hard to find (that’s part of its charm), and expensive when you get there, this hidden culinary jewel delivers on all the superlatives it receives. Make sure you hunt it down. See p. 464.\n\n15 THE BEST SHOPPING • Auckland: The whole city is a treasuretrove of shops. Try the chic fashion and design shops of High Street; international designers duty-free at DFS Galleria Customhouse; upmarket boutiques in Parnell; antiques on Manukau Road; mainstream fashion in Newmarket— plus the super-classy Nuffield Street and its top designer labels; big mall shopping at St. Luke’s Shopping Centre; and fabulous specialty shops on K’Road and Ponsonby Road. See “Shopping” in chapter 6. • Rotorua: A rich vein of New Zealand souvenirs runs right through the whole city, but for the best Maori arts and\n\ncrafts, look to Tamaki Maori Village. See “Rotorua” in chapter 9. • Wellington: The Old Bank Building on Lambton Quay has only added to the electric atmosphere of this capital shopping area. Wander the length of the Quay for fashion, books, shoes, and more; move up through Willis Street for more of the same, and into Cuba Mall for edgy design stores and off-thewall retail surprises. Check out Tinakori Road for a handsome cluster of boutiques. See “Shopping” in chapter 12. • Nelson: Long recognized as the best region for leisure crafts shopping, greater Nelson is dotted with hundreds\n\nboutique stores; and Merivale Mall for upmarket fashion and specialty shops. See “Shopping” in chapter 14. • Hokitika and Greymouth: Jade/greenstone/pounamu and gold are found in abundance in these two West Coast towns. Stores specializing in both are found side by side in both Hokitika and Greymouth. See “Greymouth & Lake Brunner” and “Hokitika: Greenstone, Glowworms & Gold” in chapter 15. • Queenstown: This is the home of expensive shopping. You’ll find that most things have big price tags, but the quality is invariably tops.

Also in Christchurch, check out High Street for an eclectic mix of antiques, secondhand stores, cafes, and new and old clothing boutiques; Cashel Mall for fashion and design stores; Victoria Street for a whole host of new\n\n1 • Dinner on High: Dining in Auckland’s Sky Tower Observatory restaurant over 1,000 feet above New Zealand’s largest city gives new meaning to the phrase “getting high.” Take your pick from a terrific menu and enjoy your meal gazing out over the sparkling waters of Waitemata Harbour and the city below. Before or after dinner, make sure you take time to look through the highpowered binoculars on the Observation Deck. See “Exploring Auckland” in chapter 6. • Soaking Under the Stars: What could be better than lying back in the hot, soothing mineral waters of Rotorua’s award-winning Japanese Buro pools at the Polynesian Spa, set among rocks and waterfalls beside the misty Lake Rotorua, looking up at the stars? The complex has 27 pools in total (some indoors), including 13 lovely private pools. This is the perfect place to ease sore muscles after a long day exploring. See “Rotorua” in chapter 9.\n\n• Seeing Stars: This is your chance to see the wonders of the Southern Hemisphere sky in a whole new way. Fresh from a major refurbishment, the Carter Observatory features exciting exhibitions and multimedia presentations that take you on an amazing interplanetary adventure. If you thought our skies were bright and starry before you went in, you’ll come out with a fresh appreciation of their beauty. See “Exploring Wellington” in chapter 12. • Meeting the Creatures of the Night: There’s always something going on at Wellington Zoo after dark, and this could be your chance to find out which animals wake up as everyone else goes to sleep. If you time it right, you could join one of the group sleepovers (minimum numbers required); or, if you don’t fancy bedding with the animals, check out the zoo’s summer evening program. They often have picnic evenings with live jazz or blues to add to\n\nTHE BEST AFTER DARK FUN\n\n16 THE BEST AFTER DARK FUN\n\nTHE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n16\n\nTHE BEST AFTER DARK FUN\n\n1\n\nthe entertainment.

See “Meals on Wheels” in chapter 14. • Art After Dark: Enjoy one of the largest permanent art collections in New Zealand when Christchurch Art Gallery opens its doors for its weekly late night on Wednesday evenings. There are 5,500 paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings for you to peruse, and an excellent restaurant for you to dine in before or after soaking up Canterbury culture. See “Exploring Christchurch” in chapter 14. • Bar Hopping: If you’re a night owl looking for a good time, strut your stuff South of Lichfield—more commonly known as SOL—a new back-alley development that features over a dozen lively themed bars and restaurants. There are lights galore, lots of music, and heaps of people.\n\nThe best time to go is after dark on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday when there are bigger crowds. Nearby Poplar Lane is a similar, smaller development with more funky bars. See “Christchurch After Dark” in chapter 14. • Now Showing: At Wanaka’s Cinema Paradiso you’ll get a night at the movies like no other. Think old hall, castoff armchairs, big cushions and sofas, and even an old car to give you the drive-in feel. Factor in a 30-minute cafe-snack break and you’re guaranteed a unique night at the movies See “The Big Screen” in chapter 16. • Over the Edge: If you ran out of time to complete a bungy jump during the day, fear not, for there’s still time. At the Ledge, A. J. Hackett and his crew have created the ultimate nighttime jump. You can’t see how far you’re falling in the dark, so if you were too afraid to try it in daylight, maybe this is for you! You also get to enjoy a nighttime ride up to the Ledge on the gondola, so you’ll have great views of all the Queenstown lights twinkling in Lake Wakatipu. See “Queenstown” in chapter 16.\n\nNew Zealand in Depth Kia ora, welcome to New Zealand! Get used to this greeting because you’re going to hear it a lot during your stay. Kia ora simply means hello in greeting, or go well as a farewell. The meaning will be obvious in context. (See below for more details on Maori terms you’ll hear.) Many people think we live in remote, watery isolation down here in New Zealand, and that we’re overrun by 60 million sheep and rugby players as big as kauri trees. Well, for a start, sheep numbers have dropped. Current estimates are closer to 44 million, and while there are some big boys out there, they’re not all 7 feet tall, wearing rugby boots and All Blacks jerseys. New Zealand is no longer the sleepy little backwater it was back in the 1950s, although lingering pockets do exist, and you’ll still find that, as incomprehensible as it seems, thousands of North Islanders have never been to the South Island and vice versa. That aside, a lot has been achieved here in a few short decades. We share in the rapid changes of the big, wide world and we celebrate the good things that progress has brought us. There have been downsides—like the brutal clearing of native forests and the lack of respect for a truly unique landscape—but we’re wiser now, and we have 13 national parks protecting the most enviable slices of these little islands. Although some still won’t believe this, I’d like to clarify that New Zealand is not joined to the geographical hip of Australia. In fact, the 1,600km (990 miles) separating us account for some pretty significant differences. Australia, for instance, is vast; New Zealand is not. Australia has a very large red desert in its middle; New Zealand doesn’t. And whereas Australia was settled by British convicts, we New Zealanders like to remind everyone that we started out as England’s other pasture. The one irrefutable thing the two countries do share is a lively, generally good-spirited rivalry over just about everything, but especially sports.\n\n1 N E W Z E A L A N D TO D AY Like any young country, New Zealand is growing rapidly and facing issues associated with progress. Urban drift accounts for 80% of the population living in towns and cities, most of which is north of Lake Taupo, with a full third of the population in the Auckland region alone. City infrastructures, transport systems, and housing developments are struggling in some cases to keep up with the pace. Biculturalism has been the loudest catchphrase of the past decade. From the late 19th century until after World War II,\n\nthere was a marked decline in the use of the Maori language because schools insisted that only English be taught. Since the 1960s, however, there has been a growing resurgence of interest in Maori identity, language, and tradition, and many Maori are now bilingual, thanks to extensive language programs in schools. The Waitangi Tribunal, set up by the New Zealand government in 1987 to settle unresolved issues related to the Treaty of Waitangi, has brought Maori grievances to light. Many claim their ancestors were\n\n2\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\n18\n\ntricked out of much of their land. Today, a good portion of that land has been returned to Maori ownership and many tribes have established lucrative business and corporate entities in the seafood, forestry, farming, and tourism industries. Today, a combination of farming practices, growing populations, urban spread, and increasing tourism numbers are putting pressure on the land. New Zealanders have always taken pride in their “clean, green” image, but in face of evidence that suggests we may not be as clean and green as we had hoped, there are strong moves to take better care of our natural assets. Sustainability is a big issue, especially in industry and tourism. In face of our passion for the great outdoors and our reputation for being crazy adventurers, you could be forgiven for thinking that the arts have been overlooked. Nothing could be further from the\n\ntruth. The main cities—Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin—all have vibrant cultural hearts; and New Zealand has given the world more than its fair share of talented artists, musicians, writers, filmmakers, and designers. We’ve carved out an international reputation for much more than those hefty rugby players I talked about earlier. Maybe it’s because we have always been so isolated. Maybe it’s because, as a young country, we are still finding our way and still striving to prove we can foot it with the best of the Northern Hemisphere. Whatever the reason, New Zealanders are fiercely proud of their patch. Wherever else they go in the world, they invariably prove themselves as innovative, hardworking, passionate people, making their way in the wider world but always, somehow, still attached to their island roots.\n\nLO O K I N G B AC K AT N E W Z E A L A N D\n\n2\n\n2 LO O K I N G B AC K AT N E W Z E A L A N D EARLY MAORI SETTLEMENT There’s more than one theory as to how New Zealand’s first inhabitants settled here. The Maori legend tells of Kupe, who in a.d. 950 sailed from Hawaiiki, the traditional homeland of the Polynesians. The legend doesn’t tell us exactly where Hawaiiki was located in the vast South Pacific, but present-day authorities believe it belonged to the Society Islands group that includes Tahiti. It wasn’t until the mid–14th century that Maori arrived in great numbers. These settlers found abundant supplies of seafood and berries, which they supplemented with tropical plants like taro, yams, and Kumara (sweet potato) that they’d brought along from Hawaiiki. Dogs and rats also made the voyage, and they were added to the protein source. The cultivation of these imported vegetables and animals gradually led to an agricultural society in which Maori lived in per-\n\nmanent villages based on a central marae (village common or courtyard) and whare runanga (meetinghouse). This is where the distinctive Maori art forms of woodcarving and tattooing evolved. ABEL TASMAN & DUTCH DISCOV ERY The first recorded sighting of New\n\nZealand by Europeans occurred in December 1642. Abel Tasman, who was scouting territory for the Dutch East India Company, spied the west coast of the South Island, entered Golden Bay, and met the Maori before even reaching land. As his two ships anchored, several Maori war canoes entered the water and paddlers shouted hostile challenges. The next day, Maori attacked a cockboat, killing four sailors. Tasman fired at the retreating canoes and departed. Bad weather forced him to proceed up the west coast of the North Island. Failing to find a suitable landing spot, he sailed on to Tonga and\n\n19\n\n2 LO O K I N G B AC K AT N E W Z E A L A N D\n\nthe Maori, were little better than the sealers and whalers in respecting the country’s natural resources. Great forests were felled and luxuriant bushlands disappeared as land was cleared. The immigration of Europeans, mostly from Great Britain, had a devastating impact on Maori culture. Most destructive was the introduction of liquor, muskets, and diseases against which the Maori had no immunity. Muskets intensified the fierce intertribal warfare, eventually becoming so common that no one tribe had superiority in terms of firepower. By 1830, Maori chiefs began to realize the weapon was destroying all their tribes. Missionaries also began to come during this period. They were responsible for putting the Maori language in writing (largely for the purpose of translating and printing the Bible), establishing mission schools, and upgrading agricultural methods through the use of plows and windmills. Lawlessness grew along with the number of British immigrants, and harm was inflicted on both Maori and the new settlers. The missionaries complained to the British government, which was by no means eager to recognize faraway New Zealand as a full-fledged colony, having already experienced problems with America and Canada. As an alternative, the Crown placed New Zealand under the jurisdiction of New South Wales in 1833, and dispatched James Busby as “British Resident” with full responsibilities to enforce law and order. Unfortunately, he was completely ineffective. THE TREATY OF WAITANGI Back in Britain, the newly formed New Zealand Company began sending ships to buy land from the Maori and establish permanent settlements. Their questionable methods caused increasing alarm in London. Between 1839 and 1843, the New Zealand Company sent out 57 ships carrying 19,000 settlers, the nucleus of the permanent British population.\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\nFiji, and Golden Bay was known as Murderer’s Bay for many years to come. CAPTAIN COOK When Captain James Cook left England in 1768 on the Endeavour, he carried orders from King George III to sail south in search of the “continent” reported by Abel Tasman. If he found it uninhabited, he was to plant the English flag and claim it for the king; if not, he was to take possession of “convenient situations,” but only with the consent of the indigenous people. On October 7, 1769, Nicholas Young, son of the ship’s surgeon, spotted New Zealand from his perch in the mast. Naming the headland (in the Gisborne area) Young Nick’s Head, Cook sailed into a crescent-shaped bay and anchored. With the help of a young Tahitian chief, Tupea, who had sailed with the crew as a guide and interpreter, Cook tried to make contact with the Maori, but to no avail. They remained hostile and would not accept Cook’s gifts, nor let him take food and water to his men. Disappointed, Cook claimed the country for King George, and named the bay Poverty Bay because, as he noted in his journal, “it afforded us not one thing we wanted.” Sailing north, he rounded the tip of the North Island and went on to circumnavigate both islands. During the next 6 months, he accurately charted the country, and missed only the entrance to Milford Sound (which is virtually invisible from the open sea) and the fact that Stewart Island was not part of the mainland. THE BRITISH ARRIVE Sealers began arriving in 1792 and essentially stripped the South Island waters of its seal colonies. Whalers, too, discovered rich hunting grounds in New Zealand waters. Oil vats soon dotted the Bay of Islands, which provided safe harbor. Traders and merchants, attracted by the wealth of flax, the abundance of trees for shipbuilding, and the lucrative trading of muskets and other European goods with\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\n20\n\nLO O K I N G B AC K AT N E W Z E A L A N D\n\n2\n\nIn 1839, Captain William Hobson was sent by the government to sort out the concerns. By catering to the Maori sense of ceremony, he arranged an assembly of chiefs at the Busby residence in the Bay of Islands. There, on February 6, 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed after lengthy debate. The treaty guaranteed Maori “all the rights and privileges of British subjects” in exchange for their acknowledgment of British sovereignty, while granting the Crown exclusive rights to buy land from the Maori. Many of the chiefs did not understand what they had signed. Nevertheless, 45 of them ultimately signed the treaty, and when it was circulated around the country, another 500 signed as well. Instead of easing tensions, though, the Treaty of Waitangi ushered in one of the bloodiest periods in New Zealand’s history. The British were eager to exercise their right to purchase Maori land, and while some chiefs were eager to sell, others were not. As pressures forced them to sell, the Maori revolted, and when Chief Hone Heke (the first to sign the treaty) hacked down the British flagpole at Kororareka (Russell) in 1844, it signaled the beginning of some 20 years of fierce battles. The British finally emerged the victors, but the seizure of that Maori land continues to be the subject of debate today. FROM WAITANGI TO THE PRES ENT By the time the 1860s arrived, gold\n\nhad been discovered on the South Island’s West Coast. The Gold Rush opened up huge tracts of Central Otago, and Cobb & Co, a stagecoach company, extended their coaching operations to link the major towns from Christchurch south. They added to that in 1866, initiating a coach service across Arthur’s Pass to the gold fields of Westland. By the end of the 1860s, Dunedin was by far the largest city in the country thanks to gold wealth. Advances in rail transport flourished dur-\n\ning this period, and with waves of new immigrants keen to seek their fortune in the gold fields, New Zealand entered a period of lively economic activity that was to see it through the 1870s and 1880s. Whaling, too, changed the face of New Zealand during this period. It was one of our first major industries and with the influx of international whalers came traders, missionaries, onshore whaling stations, and new housing settlements. Many whalers stayed on, leaving their ships to marry into Maori families—the fact that there are many Maori families today with Scandinavian names is part of that legacy. In 1892, the introduction of the first refrigerated shipment of lamb to England heralded a new era in New Zealand beef and lamb exports. History was made in 1893 when New Zealand became the first country in the world to allow women to vote. By 1914, thoughts had turned to war. One hundred thousand New Zealanders joined the Australia–New Zealand Army Corps to fight in World War I, and New Zealand lost more soldiers per capita than any other nation. The 1930s were colored by the Great Depression, unemployment, riots and, on a happier note, the beginning of air services across Cook Strait. Our soldiers returned to battle in 1939 with the advent of World War II; and in 1947 the Statute of Westminster was adopted by the government, giving New Zealand full independence from Britain. For many, the 1950s were a golden era. The economy had long-since settled, our men were back from war, and, for the first time, New Zealand’s population hit two million. Life was easy in the ’50s. Threats were few and achievements began piling up—Edmund Hillary became the first man to climb Mount Everest; we had our first royal visit when the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth stepped foot on our\n\nproducts accounted for just under 50% of our export income. The mid-1980s also heralded the complete deregulation of the domestic economy. It took a decade of struggle for many industries to come to terms with the changes. (This is the main reason our infamous sheep numbers dropped from 72 million in 1983 to the present low of around 44 million.) The stern belt-tightening ultimately bore fruit, however, and by 1993, the economy was flourishing. Today, forestry, horticulture, fishing, tourism, and manufacturing are the leading industries. Tourism is the country’s largest single source of foreign exchange. Overall standards and the level of professionalism have improved tenfold in recent years, making New Zealand one of the ripest countries in the world for visitors.\n\n3 ART & ARCHITECTURE also been heavily inspired by the land and natural forms. That said, Pakeha artists are also heavily inspired by the land and nature. Perhaps that goes back to our short history and our closeness to the land. It’s not so long ago that we were clearing forest (150 years) and carving out new lives in these remote islands. I think most New Zealanders at some point in their lives are aware of that geographical isolation. Our country and our population are both small, so perhaps we are more keenly aware of everything that happens to the land here; and perhaps we have a subconscious awareness of just how much our survival depends on the land. It would be fair to say that New Zealand as a nation has also struggled to come to terms with its own sense of identity as it developed from a pioneering colony into a modern western nation. Nowhere is that more obvious than in our artistic expressions. Time and again, still, you will hear people here talking about “a\n\n2 ART & ARCHITECTURE\n\nAs a visitor viewing our museum collections and contemporary galleries, it will soon become obvious that our artistic roots are firmly embedded in a mix of European tradition and Pacific, especially Maori, influences. In some ways the two are quite different. The early European tradition favored an emblematic and literary pairing of image and poetic allusion with subject matter leaning toward the land and self-questioning. The Maori tradition of figurative imagery (traditionally expressed in carving), asserted a strong genealogical identity. While it’s easy to generalize, that difference probably still holds true today for much of New Zealand’s contemporary art. While Maori artists have borrowed from the European traditions (materially and stylistically), contemporary Maori art is still usually very strongly concerned with what it means to be Maori. There is often a strong reference to heritage, myths, and legends in Maori work. Maori figurative art has ART\n\n21\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\nshores; and the Auckland Harbour Bridge heralded a new age of modernity when it opened in 1959. It’s hard to believe now, but New Zealand had to wait until the 1960s to get its first regional television—in Auckland. We didn’t get color television until 1973, by which time the New Zealand population had hit three million and the Auckland International Airport had opened. The country’s economy has traditionally depended on the success of wool, dairy, and meat exports with protected, unlimited access to British markets. This changed when Britain entered the European Common Market in the 1970s. New Zealand was then forced to diversify and do business with many other countries. By the mid-1980s, meat, wool, and dairy\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\n22\n\nART & ARCHITECTURE\n\n2\n\nNew Zealand identity” as if it were some mythical aspiration; yet I am firmly of the view that we already have an established New Zealand identity—especially in our art. Among the most collectible of our contemporary artists are names like Colin McCahon (1919–87), Len Lye (1901– 80), Toss Woollaston (1910–98), Rita Angus (1908–70), Philip Clairmont (1949–84), Bill Hammond (1947–), and Maori artists Ralph Hotere (1931–), Shane Cotton (1964–), Michael Parekowhai (1968–), and Robyn Kahukiwa (1938–) to name just a tiny smattering. Other important artists to look out for include Philip Trusttum, Barry Cleavin, Andrew Drummond, Tony Fomison, Neil Dawson, Seraphine Pick, Peter Robinson, Richard Killeen, Dick Frizzell, Mark Braunias, Gretchen Albrecht, and others. No matter how many I list, there will be someone equally important left out. ARCHITECTURE When the first settlers arrived in New Zealand, the only architecture here was the raupo (reed) whare (houses) built by Maori and some ramshackle whalers’ huts. It goes without saying that the British settlers quickly felled trees and began building little cottages (and later bigger houses and mansions) based on the British model. As wealth in the new colony increased, so did the stature and durability of the buildings. New Zealand’s first substantial buildings were erected by missionaries in the Bay of Islands around 1814. You can still visit Kemp House and the Stone Store, both built in the Georgian style that set the tone for much that was to come. Today in the wealthier suburbs of Auckland (Remuera, Parnell, Mount Eden, Devonport); Wellington (Thorndon, Mount Victoria); Christchurch (Fendalton, Merivale); and Dunedin (Maori Hill) you’ll still find many fine large Georgianstyle and Victorian homes. Christchurch\n\nand Dunedin in particular are known for their fine Victorian Gothic architecture. Sadly, many of these houses have been pulled down to make way for the new. Large sheep and cattle stations are spread throughout the country, but the South Island is blessed with huge homesteads from this period. If you’re lucky, you may get to stay in some that have been converted into lodges or upmarket bed-andbreakfast accommodations. Canterbury’s Otahuna Lodge is one example. It is one of the finest examples of Queen Anne architecture in Australasia and has been beautifully restored and converted into one of New Zealand’s finest luxury lodges. I’ve tried to list a number of excellent B&Bs in fine old homes throughout the guide, so if you’re interested in architecture, make sure you check each chapter. You’ll also find some splendid early architecture in our churches. Throughout the country, from tiny towns to large cities, there are hundreds of examples of excellent ecclesiastical architecture well worth visiting. In the more remote areas of Northland and East Cape, you’ll also find many exquisite little Maori churches. The best examples of these are St. Faith’s Church in Ohinemutu, Rotorua, and St. Mary’s at Tikitiki on East Cape. Both are open to the public and both feature exquisite carving and tukutuku paneling that you won’t see anywhere else in the world. Architecture buffs should also seek out Napier and the wider Hawke’s Bay for one of the finest collections of Art Deco and Spanish mission architecture outside of Miami. Central Napier was rebuilt almost entirely in Art Deco style after the massive 1931 earthquake that obliterated the city. And in Oamaru in the South Island (btw. Timaru and Dunedin), you’ll find an impressive collection of classical and Renaissance buildings complete with Corinthian pillars that will make you wonder if you’ve landed in a remote outpost of Greece.\n\nchurch, have not been without controversy and detractors. But we’re a small nation and too often small minds rebel against the new. Perhaps that’s the way of an isolated, island nation? Wineries, too, are at the leading edge of New Zealand contemporary architecture as increasing numbers of vineyards realize the power of individualistic branding that includes a statement winery and (often) restaurant. Fine examples include Peregrine (Central Otago), Cable Bay (Waiheke Island), Craggy Range (Hawke’s Bay), Elephant Hill (Hawke’s Bay), and Villa Maria, Oyster Bay, and Spy Valley, all in Marlborough.\n\n4 T H E L AY O F T H E L A N D Despite all this earthly fury, the land has been blessed with an endless coastline of stunning beaches—white or golden sand on the east coasts, black or gray on the west coasts. Craters have filled to create jewel-like lakes, and rivers and streams are the endless arteries and veins that feed lush flora.\n\nFLORA & FAUNA Fauna For 70 million years, New Zealand has been completely separate from all other landmasses. We’ve been left with a few pretty strange creatures as a result: four flightless birds—the kiwi, weka, kakapo, and takahe—along with an ancient reptile (the tuatara), directly descended from the dinosaurs. The kiwi, of course, has been embraced as a national symbol, so much so that many New Zealanders are quite happy to be called Kiwis themselves. And that odd spiky “lizard,” the tuatara, is being encouraged to breed itself silly in captivity to ensure it will be around for future generations to marvel at. Apart from that, we don’t have anything very exciting in the way of wildlife. New\n\n2 T H E L AY O F T H E L A N D\n\nNew Zealand is part of a fiery rim of volcanoes that encircle the Pacific Ocean. The last large eruption occurred in 1886—Mount Tarawera near Rotorua left an estimated 150 people dead. Our most recent showoff has been Mount Ruapehu, which did its best to ruin the central North Island ski season for several years in a row in the late ’90s. Today, New Zealand bears all the fascinating geographical hallmarks of a tumultuous geologic history. It may have a reputation for being “very green,” but most visitors are astonished to discover a small country of incredible geographic diversity. There are 500-million-year-old marble outcrops on the top of the Takaka Hills in Nelson, and volcanic ash and pumice have created a barren, desertlike landscape in the central North Island. Franz Josef is one of the fastest-moving glaciers in the world, and the Marlborough Sounds are a labyrinth of islands and waterways. Parched tussock country and strange rocky outcrops cover Central Otago, and the Canterbury Plains spread wide and flat as evidence of prehuman glacial erosion.\n\n23\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\nContemporary architecture—both domestic and commercial—is increasingly finding “a New Zealand voice.” Our architecture very much follows the path of art in that regard. Yet it is said that only around 2% of New Zealanders employ an architect to design their home—it being seen as the realm of the wealthy—and many of the finest examples of modern New Zealand residential architecture are tucked away down long driveways, well away from easy public view. There are, however, many fine public buildings. Some, like the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington and the Christchurch Art Gallery in Christ-\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\n24\n\nT H E L AY O F T H E L A N D\n\n2\n\nZealand has no native mammals. It was the first Polynesian settlers who brought in both the dog and the rat. Captain Cook then arrived with pigs, goats, fowl, and probably more rats. As more foreign animals were introduced, it became necessary to bring in other animals to control those that had become pests. We now have more than 33 introduced species of mammals, 34 species of birds, 14 species of freshwater fish, at least 1,000 species of introduced insects, plus an Australian lizard and frog or two. Unfortunately, a good many of the above are pests, especially the opossum, which eats its way through frightening quantities of our forests every night. Oddly, while we in New Zealand are busy trying to eradicate this Australian native, in Australia they are busy protecting it. The good news is, we have no nasties— no snakes, predatory animals, or deadly critters of any kind. The only one that comes close is the poisonous katipo spider, which you’re unlikely to even see, unless you’re on the western beaches of the North Island and spot a small black spider with a bright red stripe on its abdomen. There are sometimes sharks in the waters around New Zealand, though, so be sure to ask the locals about this, even though shark attacks are rare. BIRDWATCHING Our bird life is abundant and our native birds (around 250 species) in particular are a rich lot, attracting bird-watchers from all over the world. Because of New Zealand’s isolation and the evolutionary patterns that have developed here as a result, many species are found nowhere else in the world. The bellbird, plain of feather and easily missed, is the songster supreme. The handsome inky tui, with his white-tufted neck, comes a close second. The flightless weka is rowdy rather than tuneful, and you’ll see him in the bush or poking his nose into campsites. The green-andorange kea is a cheeky mountain parrot\n\nwith a reputation for mischief on the ski fields and in high-country camps. Make sure you don’t leave any belongings about, as keas love to steal whatever is not locked away. This especially applies to anything shiny. They are notorious for damaging mirrors, aerials, and other attachments on vehicles; and their large, strong beaks will give you a nasty bite, so don’t be tempted to feed them. Seabirds of course abound and you’ll be delighted by nesting albatross and gannets, elegant white herons, penguins, and many more. Keen bird-watchers have many choice spots to visit. The Miranda Seabird Coast near Thames on the Coromandel Peninsular is home to 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) of tidal flats that attract millions of migratory species every year. Farewell Spit northwest of Nelson is another major migratory path; and South Brighton Spit in Christchurch attracts millions of godwits every year on their return from Siberia. You can enjoy seabird tours at Kaikoura; and Otago Peninsular is home to both albatross and penguin colonies, which you can visit. Another not-to-be-missed bird-watching location is Okarito in the South Westland. This is where you’ll find the white heron nesting colonies. Keep in mind that the only access to these protected areas is via guided tours, which I’ve listed in the appropriate chapter. There are several tourism operators offering seabird tours around the peninsular coastline. Stewart Island is another superb destination for bird-watchers. Not only does it have a wealth of pelagic species which you can arrange to see by boat; it also has easy access to Ulva Island, a protected bird sanctuary that is home to several unique species. One of the delights here is the tiny native robins that are surprisingly tame and fearless. If you scratch the ground gently, they will hop right up to your feet, providing you with unforgettable photo opportunities. Stewart Island is also the only place in New\n\nFlora When it comes to flora, we have diverse vegetation—everything from coastal grasses, moss-covered rainforests, and dense primeval forests of ancient podocarp trees to palms, lush ferns, orchids, Norfolk pines, bougainvillea, flame trees, and hibiscus. In the far north, the Waipoua Forest is home to our giant kauri trees, which are one of the oldest species in the world. Tane Mahuta, the largest of the kauri trees, is said to be over 2,000 years old. In the central North Island and throughout the mountainous regions of\n\n25\n\n2 T H E L AY O F T H E L A N D\n\n• Be patient. The forest isn’t on a schedule. However, your best shots at seeing birds (or other wildlife) are in the very early morning and late afternoon hours. • Read up. Familiarize yourself with what you’re most likely to see, and if you plan to study the birds, get a copy of The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand by Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson. It’s published by Penguin and is the only guide endorsed by the Ornithological Society of New Zealand. The same authors also produce a smaller book, The Hand Guide to the Birds of New Zealand. If you’d like a more colorful reference, get Know Your New Zealand Birds by Lynette and Geoff Moon, published by New Holland. They also produce a small, handbag-size Photographic Guide to New Zealand Birds. It is also important to remember that you put yourself at grave risk by wandering off into the bush alone. You will have a much safer and more satisfying bush bird-watching experience by joining a guide who knows exactly where and when to go to find specific species. Also check at information centers for the best local knowledge of key bird-watching areas, the species you are likely to see, and tour operators or guides who can take you there.\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\nZealand where you can join nighttime kiwi-spotting tours that take you out into the wild to see this native icon. You’ll be very lucky to see a kiwi in the wild on your own, as they tend to forage deep in the bush at night, or on remote, often inaccessible beaches. Birds are easier to spot in clearings or secondary forests than they are in primary forests. Unless you have lots of experience bird-watching, your best hope for enjoying a walk through the forest lies in employing a trained and knowledgeable guide. (By the way, if it’s been raining a lot and the trails are muddy, a good pair of rubber boots comes in handy). As with any form of bird or wildlife spotting, the standard rules apply. Here are a few helpful hints: • Listen. Pay attention to rustling in the leaves; whether it’s bellbirds up above or penguins on the ground, you’re most likely to hear an animal before seeing one. • Keep quiet. Noise will scare off animals and prevent you from hearing their movements and calls. • Don’t try too hard. Soften your focus and allow your peripheral vision to take over. This way you can catch glimpses of motion and then focus in on the prey. • Bring binoculars. It’s also a good idea to practice a little first to get the hang of them. It would be a shame to be fiddling around and staring into space while everyone else in your group oohs and aahs over a kiwi. • Dress appropriately. You’ll have a hard time focusing your binoculars if you’re busy swatting flies. Light, long pants and long-sleeved shirts are your best bet. Comfortable hiking boots are a real boon, except where heavy rubber boots are necessary. Avoid loud colors; the better you blend in with your surroundings, the better your chances are of spotting birds.\n\n26\n\nNEW ZEALAND IN DEPTH\n\nGoing Shopping\n\nT H E L AY O F T H E L A N D\n\n2\n\nYou won’t be short of opportunities to find take-home souvenirs of your trip to New Zealand. Gift and souvenir shops abound in every city, and most major attractions, museums, and art galleries also have their own stores. Their shelves bulge with all the iconic New Zealand gifts—woolen products of every sort, from clothing to floor rugs; kiwis, sheep, and penguins in every size and shape; a growing range of excellent skin-care and cosmetic products; New Zealand– brand sports clothing; some packaged food products (chocolates, honey, sweets); and a plethora of Maori souvenirs. For high quality, genuine Maori products, you should only purchase items from quality art galleries and gift stores, and preferably items bearing the toi iho™ trademark, which is used to promote authentic Maori crafts in New Zealand. Many Maori items on display in mainstream souvenir shops have been made en masse in Asia. I would suggest you purchase any Maori items from places like Auckland Museum, Te Papa in Wellington, and from authentic craftsmen in the Rotorua and Gisborne areas, so you can be sure you have the genuine article. I have also listed reputable stores in individual chapters of the guide.
