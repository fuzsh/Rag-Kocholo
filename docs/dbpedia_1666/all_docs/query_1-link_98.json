        "text": "A few minutes ago this writer finished reading a remarkably interesting article at Chess.com. This may come as a surprise to regular readers because I have made no bones about my dislike of Chess.com. Nevertheless, I surf over each day because occasionally they publish an article in which interest is found. The title of the article by NM Todd Bryant is: Can Adults Improve At Chess? (https://www.chess.com/article/view/can-adults-improve-at-chess)\n\nAfter reading it for the second time the second cuppa Joe of the day was made in order to help jump start the brain neurons prior to punchin’ & pokin’. The story of how and why I began playing Chess as an adult will follow a story concerning an adult who decided to learn Chess at an advanced age.\n\nWhen working at the Atlanta Chess Center the Legendary Georgia Ironman came to me asking if I would consider giving Chess lessons to a young man new to the game. The gentleman had graduated college and law school prior to joining a prominent law firm in Atlanta.\n\n“Why do you ask, Tim?”\n\n“I flared up on him, Mike,” said the Ironman while hanging his head in shame.\n\nAfter listening to his tale of woe the decision was made to meet the gentleman.\n\nIt was a middle of the week when the prospective adult student made his entrance into a new world. Up the stairs we went and after taking a seat across the Chessboard introductions were made. The young man was surprised to learn someone he mentioned was known. “You would be surprised to learn the names of many people I have met because of Chess,” I said.\n\n“Like who?” he inquired.\n\n“Jimmy Carter,” came the reply. His eyes enlarged upon hearing the name, so I continued, “His son, Jack, played tournament Chess and I worked with him a few times.”\n\n“Did you meet Jimmy?” he inquired.\n\n“Several times,” I said. “He has a handshake like a vice grip while looking you straight in the eyes.”\n\nThen we got down to business.\n\nLong story made short, the lesson was stopped after asking the question, “Why do you want to play Chess?”\n\nAfter listening to his reasons and learning everything had come easy to him up to that point in his life, my story of beginning at twenty was shared. “Chess is the most difficult thing I have ever done,” I said.\n\nAfter talking a little while he said, “Maybe I have bitten off more than I can chew.”\n\n“Maybe,” was all I said.\n\nThe young fellow stood up and pulled out his wallet.\n\n“Keep your money, my friend,” I said.\n\n“But I owe you something,” he said.\n\n“Getting to know you was more than enough payment, sir. I wish you good fortune in life,” was the last thing said to the gentleman, who smiled before turning to walk down the steps and out the door of the House of Pain.\n\nMy father taught me to play Chess, a game he learned while serving in the Navy during World War Two, when I was sixteen. The first two games we played he beat me like a drum, causing me to purchase a small paperback book by Fred Reinfeld, titled, How To Play Chess. Ronald continued asking if I would like to play. The answer was invariably “No” until finishing the book. He continued asking until the day the answer was “Yes.” His eyes lit up like a Christmas tree before he produced a sinister smile with a look on his face that projected, “Dead meat!”\n\nThe man did not know it but he was in for what he was so fond of telling me I would have one day; a “rude awakening.”\n\nNow having a clue about what to do my father was flummoxed because it was not what he was expecting. He went down in flames, shaking his head, saying, “Must be beginners luck. Another game?”\n\n“Sure,” came the immediate reply. I glanced over at Mother, who was doing her best to stifle a grin.\n\nAfter thrashing Ronald in the second game he lost it, raking the pieces off of the board, obviously mad as a hatter. It has been far too long ago for me to recall exactly what happened next but there is a vivid memory of Mother saying, “That’s MY BOY!” Ronald was INFURIATED and left the room. We never played another game of Chess. My father had to know, so he asked me if I would play a game or two with a neighbor who knew the game. I agreed, and played Bill Jones, and his son, Larry, a few games, beating them handily. Larry and I attended the same grammar and high schools. The only thing I recall is that Larry used all of his opening moves setting up a picket fence, leaving holes in his position, which were easily exploited. After learning of my prowess at Chess cousin Carl Hendrix asked if I would like to play one of his fellow employees at Eastern Air Lines. Because the way my father had reacted to defeat I begged off. That was a, as IM Boris Kogan was so fond of saying about one of my Chess moves, “BEEG Mistake.” The co-worker turned out to be a fellow named Bob Joiner, who later won the 1969 Georgia State Championship with an undefeated 5-0 score. Later Bob offered to purchase a brick to place beside the one he purchased at the then home of the USCF in Crossville, Tennessee, but the offer was declined. I did meet Bob later and after earning his degree in his off hours he became a Public Defender in Fulton County, Georgia, which is the county in which Atlanta is located. My brain contains fond memories of going to Bob’s office to eat lunch while playing Chess with a clock. I helped Bob on cases by doing investigative work pro bono. Later, when behind bars with no bond because of a sordid situation involving, you guessed it, a crazed Chess player, Bob, after returning from vacation, which caused me to suffer much more time in jail, interceded on my behalf and a bond was set, allowing me a Get Out of Jail card.\n\nAfter earning a scholarship from the Boys Club I attended a junior college after taking a year off from school to work. It was there a gentleman was met, Dr. James Doig, a philosophy professor. Dr. Doig, a former Jesuit priest, had a HUGE influence on my future when handing me his personal copy of The Story of Philosophy, by Will Durant, saying, “If you read this book you will know more about philosophy than ninety nine and forty four percent of people.” Dr. Doig may have ended with, “in America, or “on the planet.” I simply cannot recall. Because of Dr. Doig I have continued reading about philosophy all my life. (https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2021/11/24/spinoza/)(https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2022/06/09/im-stuart-rachels-was-the-best-alabama-saw-in-chess/)\n\nDr. Doig also asked me a question that altered my life: “Do you play Chess?”\n\nDr. Doig was a gentleman and scholar, who was gracious in defeat. My path on the Chess road was found because of Dr. Doig. Although not religious it was also because of Dr. Doig this writer found his way to several retreats at the Monastery of the Holy Spirit, in Conyers, Georgia, a wonderful place, during a period of crisis (https://www.trappist.net/).\n\nAfter defeating Dr. Doig the reaction was completely different from that of my father. He was gracious after each game lost. I am not ashamed to say I loved the man. I shudder to think of what the outcome of my life might have been if I had not met Dr. Doig. This was during a time when the Fools In Power killed JFK in order to send many thousands of Americans to their needless deaths in Viet Nam and I was involved in the anti-war movement. Because of Dr. Doig my battles were fought on the Chessboard, and not in the streets.\n\nAfter handily winning a Chess tournament organized by Dr. Doig I “won” free entry into a United States Chess Federation tournament. I say “won” because later it was learned Dr. Doig had put up the money for my entry. All six games ended in my defeat. The only one recalled was a very long last round battle in which a gentleman named Al Cass won a single pawn and nursed that sucker across the board to make a Queen and checkmated yours truly. It was terribly embarrassing to inform my family and friends that I was a “loser” because they had high expectations. My father said something with an excrement eatin’ grin about my learning a “lesson” or some such. Infuriated, my life was then devoted to becoming better at Chess in order to wipe that stinking grin off of his face.\n\nFor many years I told people my initial USCF rating was 1064 because that was the first rating seen in Chess Life magazine. I was disabused of that notion when Senior Master Klaus Pohl brought a copy of my first rating to the House of Pain, pleased to show everyone I began as a triple digit player, which was in the 800’s. I had once defeated SM Pohl in a USCF rated tournament and I think Larry Evans published the game in his column, or it was published in the Recent Games column of a Chess Life magazine, which infuriated Klaus.\n\nIn 1974 I tied for first place in the Atlanta Chess Championship with a score of 4-1. A group of players were tied for first place heading into the last round and the tournament director, Jared Radin, was also playing in the event. I believe Jared had previously won the same event, or maybe even the Georgia State Championship. Maybe someone reading this will do the research and elucidate readers in the future. A player, Wayne Watson, from New York, was the highest rated player in contention. An uproar ensued after Jared posted the pairings and he had paired himself with your truly, the lowest rated player in the group. A phone call was placed to Mike Decker, one of the strongest Chess players in Atlanta, and also a tournament director. Mike graduated from Emory University with not one, but two PhDs, and was held in extremely high regard by the Chess community. Mike had also befriended me and helped me greatly on the Chess path. Mike said the pairing made by Jared could be made, but under the circumstances he should give serious consideration to making the alternate pairing. The initial pairing made by Jared stood. Everyone expected Jared would defeat his much lower rated opponent.\n\nSome time earlier Jared and I had met Grandmaster Bent Larsen\n\nat the Atlanta airport and taken him to the hotel the night prior to the simultaneous exhibition he was to give the next night. We were to take the GM out for dinner, but Jared begged off, so it was only this writer and GM Larsen at the dining table. Without giving specifics, it was one of the most pleasurably and informative evenings of my life. I had first met Bent at the San Antonio 1972 Chess tournament,\n\nand he remembered me, which was, frankly, surprising. Bent surprised me again by asking about how I got into Chess and my strength, etc. To make a long story short, the time spent with Bent affected my play immensely. Bent was known for playing 1 b3 to begin a game, and it was discussed at length over drinks. Bent beat me like a drum in the simultaneous exhibition. I also lost to Jude Acers in a simul, but managed to defeat him at the World Chess Table in New Orleans some years later.\n\nLet us return to the last round game of the 1974 Atlanta Chess Championship. Wayne Watson won his game handily and it did not take much time.\n\nThe white pieces were mine versus Jared and the game was opened with 1 b3. It was a very long game. When Jared extended his hand I became the 1974 Atlanta Chess Champion because Mr. Watson was from New York and ineligible for the honor. Players were saying, “Can you believe it? We now have a class B player for Champion.”\n\nThere was no Atlanta Chess Championship in 1975. The next ACC was in 1976 and it was won with a 5-0 score. Two of the players defeated were Justin Morrison, who owns Kid Chess (https://www.kidchess.com/) here in Atlanta, and his father, Earle Morrison, in the last round game. It was the high water mark of my Chess career.\n\nAfter discovering Gammons (see previous post https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2023/11/16/the-new-kid-in-town/) and then leaving Chess for several years, I was never the same player although I did increase my rating to over 2000 during a time when the rating system was down and followed by a period of rating deflation. The Legendary one mentioned that if the adjustments had not been made and the bonus points were still in effect I would have made it over the 2100 hurdle. Be that as it may, because of having Aphantasia (https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2023/05/26/aphantasia/) it is more than a little obvious I would never have become a National Master. This writer can be content knowing he derived about as much out of Chess as possible under the circumstances.\n\nThe Ol’ Swindler, NM Neal Harris,\n\nthe man who lives in Bat Cave, was called Ol’ Swindler by the Legendary Georgia Ironman, NM Tim Brookshear,\n\ndecades ago after Neal defeated the Ironman in a sharp variation, the kind Neal liked to play. He was not called Ol’ Swindler then, but after defeating the Ironman in the exact same variation again, the Ironicman ERUPTED, “That Neal…he ain’t nuthin’ but an OL’ SWINDLER!!!”\n\nI considered mentioning what occurred did not meet the requirements of being a “swindle” but decided it best to keep quiet with steam emanating from every Ironman orifice…\n\nThis writer experienced two OTB games with the Neal Harris, one of which was drawn. The other ended in a victory for the Neal Harris Experience.\n\n“ALTO” stands for “At least twenty-one.” I have no idea from where the age requirement came, but must question why the cut-off is 21 years of age when the minimum age requirement for all six (Don’t forget the ‘Space Force’) branches of the military is SEVENTEEN (17)! If one can DIE for his country at 17 he should at least be able to participate in an ADULT Chess tournament.\n\nThe game about to be presented was followed in real time. Notes were taken, some of which will be shared with you. These were my thoughts when watching the live action onscreen without anything other than the moves being displayed.\n\nIM David Vigorito\n\nvs NM Neal Harris\n\nALTO 2023 Round 2\n\nD20 Queen’s gambit accepted\n\n1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 (I was never a fan of 2…dxc4, because it allows white to play e4 immediately and control the center. The pawn on d5 is a bastion; why give it up?) 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 e3 e6 5 Bxc4 Nc6\n\n(I don’t like the position of the knight, which is strange because I played the Chigorin Defense of the QGD ‘back in the day’)\n\n6 Nc3 Bb4 7 O-O O-O 8 Qc2 Bd6 9 Rd1 Bd7 10 h3 e5 11 a3 a5 12 Ba2 h6 13 dxe5 Nxe5 14 Nd4 Qe7 15 Nf5 Bxf5 16 Qxf5\n\n16…g6 (This move weakens blacks position. I prefer 16…c6)\n\nWhen the game ended a visit was made to lichess.org learning the five possible moves given did not include 16…c6. In order the moves found are: 16…Rad8; 16…Rfd8; 16…Ned7; 16…Rfe8; and 16…g6. The latter move puts white up by +1.5, which some consider enough to be winning. Wonder how far down the list 16…c6 appears? What do I know about Chess?\n\n17 Qc2 Kg7 18 Bd2 Ra6 (I dunno about this… What’s wrong with moving the pawn to c6?)\n\nAfter going over the game I learned Stockfish much prefers 18…Ned7. Still, it was pleasing to see 18…c6 was tied with 18…Rfd8 for second best move.\n\n19 Be1 (Now there’s a move?! Was not expecting that one… Since black did not play c6 why not play 19 Nb5?)\n\nStockfish let me know that after 19 Nb5 it’s game over. Do I know Chess, or what!?\n\n19…Rc6 (Rooks belong in front of potential passed pawns?!)\n\n20 Qa4 Ned7 (Your opponent just attacked an undefended pawn and you could protect it with your Rook but instead decide to sound the retreat horn…)\n\nWhat jumps out at you about the position? Does that Rook on c6 look out of place, or what? Place it on a6 or a8 and things look normal.\n\n21 Nb5 Nb6 22. Qxa5 Ra8 23. Qd2 Ne4 24. Qe2 Be5\n\n25.

Put fire and sword to the foe!\n\nTo fight is our only hope!”\n\nWe rallied and cast all our lanterns and powder\n\nAnd torches into the black.\n\nWe cut at the tentacles, shattered the beaks\n\nAs it battered and beat at the flames.\n\nThe beast begged, and he bribed, and he writhed all about\n\nWhile the captain’s cold steel cut his heart out.\n\nWith a dying breath he shouted aloud,\n\n“And she takes the souls of the finest of men\n\nFor the ship that will never set sail!”\n\nAs I sat on the deck in cold disbelief\n\nWith a mug of ale in my hand,\n\nI thought back to a cold winter’s morning\n\nAnd a bloodied, beaten, hanged man.\n\n“Do you not know the look and the sign of a ship?”\n\nI said to the man next to me, and he said,\n\n“Every sailor and scalawag knows of the beast\n\nBy the green of the sky and the red of the sea.\n\nThis is the work of old Davy Jones –\n\nHe’d have dragged us down to his courts.”\n\nThe old sea dog said, “There is a wench that I know\n\nAt the tavern down by the bay.\n\nHer hair is the red of the flames of the damned,\n\nAnd her honey-tongue dripping with lies.\n\nHer skin is as pale as silk covered bones,\n\nAnd her eyes are the green of the sea\n\nWhen it storms, and it crashes, and treacherously pulls you down\n\nUnder to lay you to sleep.”\n\nThen suddenly I saw a sailor\n\nWalk up to me and he said,\n\n“My captain, my captain, what now shall we do?\n\nFor our captain slayed the beast, and is dead.”\n\n‘Twas the twenty and seventh of May when we came\n\nTo the port of Tortuga once more.\n\nWe divided our plunder and I went in search\n\nOf a woman that I’d met before.\n\nI found her in the brothels down by the bay\n\nEntertaining men for her pay.\n\nI gave the lass in the parlor a coin,\n\nAnd asked to have her sent my way.\n\nShe appeared soft as a shadow,\n\nAnd lovely as a flame.\n\nShe beckoned me with a finger,\n\nAnd my soul filled with lust as I came.\n\nI followed her to her chamber,\n\nAnd watched her as she disrobed.\n\nThen she turned to me and she offered\n\nA cask inlaid with gold.\n\n“Drink with me and come to bed,” she sang\n\n“Where the gulls cry soft as they fly overhead,\n\nAnd the ocean tastes as sweet as the cane;\n\nEvery ship that sets sail is yours to command.”\n\nI smiled at her as I drank\n\nFrom the cask that sealed my doom.\n\nThen she leaned in close and she whispered,\n\n“Beware, you ignorant fool!\n\nGreet my dear husband when you descend\n\nTo the ship that will never set sail!”\n\nAnd the bottle she held in her hands as I fled\n\nWas the poison from which I had drunk, and I said,\n\n“Though my spyglass had seen through your plans to the end,\n\nStill the loneliest heart can be swindled and bled.”\n\nToward the bottom I sank as she watched with a grin,\n\nAnd the chain ’round my neck was an anchor akin\n\nTo my love. In my innocence I’d been cut quick,\n\nAnd betrayed to this Hell of eternal regret.\n\n‘Twas the hour of dusk and, along with the sun,\n\nI descended into the depths,\n\nWith the lust and the sin that clung to my skin\n\nLike chains that dragged down my flesh.\n\nI was greeted at first by a dead man,\n\nThe flesh eaten away from his skull.\n\n“Welcome to the grave, you’re a corpse among many.\n\nI’ll take you to see Davy Jones.”\n\n[The Devil, the Dead, and the Last Dawn]\n\n‘Twas eleven long months on the floor of the sea,\n\nMy hands worked down to the bone.\n\nThe lash had been cruel to my back and my breast.\n\nDay and night I had toiled alone.\n\nIn the dark I heard clearly the sound of the bell\n\nCalling all to come swift to the court.\n\nThe Master of Hell had some cruel word to share;\n\nFor relief, I held out no hope.\n\nAll the dead had gathered before him,\n\nThe Lord of the sorrowful damned.\n\nThen I saw at his side my first mate and I cried,\n\n“Sir I beg you—do not hurt this man!”\n\nI was forced to the front of the murmuring crowd,\n\nAnd then forced to my knees at his feet.\n\nI saw fear in the eyes of my loyal first mate,\n\nAnd then Davy Jones started to speak.\n\n“This isn’t the last you’ve seen of me,\n\nNor is it the first,\n\nBut if you’re not careful what you say,\n\nOh, it may be the worst.\n\nThis man who stands here before you—\n\nBeloved of yours is he not?\n\nTrustworthy friend right down to the end,\n\nHe has come to save you from rot.\n\nI’ll be plain with you, good captain—\n\nI am in need of your crew.\n\nYou’ve denied me your service eleven months now\n\nAs though you had something to prove.\n\nWithhold your soul this day\n\nAnd my wrath will be poured out in full\n\nUpon you and your crew, but especially so\n\nUpon this man who came to save you.”\n\nAs he picked me up by the collar,\n\nAnd stared with those dead steely eyes,\n\nI pulled out my heart and handed it forth.\n\nThen, I said in reply,\n\n“I have come to serve\n\nOn your ship, good sir,\n\nFull of honor\n\nAnd full of pride.”\n\n‘Twas the hour of midnight and I swabbed the deck\n\nOf the ship that would never set sail.\n\n‘Twas an old mangled shipwreck, broken in two,\n\nWithout mast, without rigging, or rail.\n\nFor thirty long years we had toiled,\n\nPreparing our ship to depart,\n\nSo that old Davy Jones could escape his cold home\n\nAnd return to his bride and his heart.\n\nOne day the captain pulled me aside,\n\n“The repairs are nearly all made.\n\nThen the anchor goes up, and the sails will be raised,\n\nAnd old Davy Jones will be away.”\n\n“My captain, my captain, what now can we do?\n\nIf we sail the whole world is doomed!”\n\n“Never fear, my good man! For in secret I’ve planned\n\nOne last plot to get us safely home,\n\nAnd to keep Davy Jones far away from dry land.\n\nCome with me—I’ll explain all below.”\n\n‘Twas the hour of twilight when all was made ready,\n\nOne hour before the dawn,\n\nWhen old Davy Jones boarded the ship\n\nAnd made orders to leave the dock.\n\n“Davy Jones I have done as you said,\n\nEvery order fulfilled without fail.\n\nBut now we’re going home, and we’re leaving you here—\n\nIt is you who shall never set sail!”\n\nWell he threw me down hard, and he drew out his sword,\n\nScoffing at me as he scorned,\n\n“This is my ship! What gives you the right\n\nTo decide who may now come aboard?”\n\n“For my crew, it was greed ’twas their downfall,\n\nAnd my first mate succumbed to his lust,\n\nBut of all of these damned the first innocent man\n\nIs the one that you came to trust.”\n\n“Good captain, your treachery shocks me!\n\nHow innocent you seemed at first.\n\nI am taken aback by your surprising lack\n\nOf compassion—you see, I am cursed.\n\nI am trapped here in this rotting body,\n\nAnd trapped here awaiting the day\n\nWhen I see my true love, and live free up above,\n\nAnd let go of all of my hate.”\n\nFor a moment I almost believed him,\n\nA shade of regret in his eyes,\n\nBut the captain held tight to his wit and his sense\n\nAnd responded with this stern reply:\n\n“Davy, your words are but poison,\n\nThe kind that send men to the grave.\n\nBy your deeds you are shown to be heartless and cold.\n\nWe depart without you and your hate!”\n\nHis sword clattered loud as it fell to the deck,\n\nAnd Davy Jones took a step back,\n\nThen my captain took up the cold weapon, and shouting,\n\nLeapt forth to press the attack.\n\nThat day Davy Jones was defeated for good\n\nAnd we pushed him down off of the plank.\n\nAnd the captain yelled forth, “Ho, anchors away!”\n\nAnd a rippling black sail we did finally raise.\n\nAnd the bottle she held in her hands\n\nWas the poison from which I had drunk.\n\nBut my spyglass had seen through her plans;\n\nWe held fast and refused to give up.\n\nAnd the happiest fate of a man of the sea\n\nIs to come back to life from the dark of the deep\n\nTo the sun, for one final journey,\n\nMaking his heading for fiddler’s green.\n\ncredits\n\nfrom Adventure Stories Volume II: Pirates, released August 14, 2013\n\nLyrics written by Luke Michael McCusker and Stephen Charles Mallory.\n\nVocals performed by Luke Michael McCusker, Stephen Charles Mallory, and Joseph Theodore Twinem.\n\nInstruments played by Luke Michael McCusker.\n\nProduced by Luke Michael McCusker.\n\nhttps://worldwideadventurers.bandcamp.com/track/the-swindlers-ballad\n\nAfter publishing the two posts concerning IM Stuart Rachels I wanted to notify someone next door in the Great State of Alabama so I went to the Alabama Chess Federation website (https://alabamachess.org/) where a picture of NM Bill Melvin,\n\nthe Secretary of the ACF, was found. Although I never knew Bill other than the time we sat across from each other over the board the decision was made to reach out with an email:\n\n“In the event you do not remember me I was fortunate enough to defeat you at the Lincoln Memorial U Open decades ago. I can tell you now that immediately prior to the game, after learning we were paired, Tim Brookshear said, “Bacon, you’re paired with the Oleg Romanishin of Southern Chess!” You lived up to the rep when sacking a pawn in the opening. I believe the opening was 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 c6 3 dxc6, etc. In lieu of playing in my customary “fire on the board” style I played my pawns close to my chest, or maybe it would be better to have written “Vest”, while hanging onto the pawn like it was a Titanic life raft!”\n\nPart of the reply:\n\nMike,\n\nI understand procrastinating over reading chess books. I have a shelf full of unread ones. It took me only a year to get around to reading Stuart’s book.\n\nI’m more interested in your stories about Boris than about Stuart’s short career. Boris played a lot in area tournaments and was always a bit of a mystery. Most of the anecdotes I heard came from the late Brian McCarthy (I played him a couple years ago at Castle Chess shortly before his passing).\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBill\n\nMy first thought was, “A year?!” From the moment the book arrived it was opened and not put down until finished. The first post of the quasi review of Stuart’s book was ready to go but Bill’s words had resonated and it became apparent a preface of sorts was needed because IM Boris Kogan\n\nwas The Trainer. On page ten of the book it is written:\n\n“Two players were vital for my development: Kyle Therrell (then called Dana), my best friend and local rival; and my trainer from the age of 12, IM Boris Kogan. From Kyle I learned all of my openings, one pairing at a time. Here was our drill: When the pairings were posted before a round, we’d hurry over to a quiet spot. ‘What does so-and-so play?’ I’d ask. My next question was, ‘What do I do against that?’ And finally I’d ask: ‘How is that supposed to be for White//Black?’ Without Kyle, I would have been lost – especially because Boris Kogan had no interest in opening theory. From Boris, I learned the finer points of position evaluation. Kogan played like Petrosian. ‘You must play seemple (itl) chess,’ he always told me. ‘Kviet(itl) moves.’ Thanks to Boris, I eventually became a weak strong player. Without him, I would only have become a dangerous patzer.”\n\nThe last two words stopped me in my tracks, causing me to recall a time when walking to the pairing board for the about to begin round and hearing someone say, “What do you mean? The guy is rated over two hundred points below you.” Then Dana Therrell replied, “Yeah, but the guy is dangerous because one round he can beat a master and then lose to a class C player the next round.” After seeing me they both left in a hurry. It was then I learned Dana would be my opponent. The game ended in a long, hard fought draw.\n\nWho was Boris Kogan?\n\n“International Master Boris Kogan, who died of colon cancer on Christmas Day in 1993, is best remembered for playing in three U.S. Championships and winning the Georgia state championship seven years in a row (1980-1986). He was also the coach of Stuart Rachels, helping him advance from being a young national master to sharing the U.S. Chess Championship. What isn’t so well known is that Kogan was a very promising player (Soviet Junior Champion in 1956 and 1957), before making the transition from player to coach at a very early age.”\n\nMechanics’ Institute Chess Club #696\n\nJanuary 23, 2015\n\nhttps://www.milibrary.org/chess-newsletters/696\n\nThe best way to illustrate how strong a player was IM Boris Kogan is this result:\n\nNew York open New York 1984\n\nApr, 1984 67 (players) 2427 (avg ELO) 276 (games) 9 (rounds)\n\nGM Dzindzichashvili, Roman 2485 7.0\n\nGM Portisch, Lajos 2625 6.5\n\nGM Adorjan, Andras 2570 6.5\n\nGM Sosonko, Gennadi 2560 6.5\n\nGM Kavalek, Lubomir 2545 6.5\n\nKogan, Boris 2450 6.5\n\nGM Browne, Walter S 2585 6.0\n\nGM Gurevich, Dmitry 2545 6.0\n\nGM Kudrin, Sergey 2520 6.0\n\nGM Gheorghiu, Florin 2495 6.0\n\nGM Hjartarson, Johann 2415 6.0\n\nGM Ljubojevic, Ljubomir 2635 5.5\n\nGM Fedorowicz, John P 2475 5.5\n\nGM Lein, Anatoly 2475 5.5\n\nGM Benko, Pal C 2450 5.5\n\nFrias Pablaza, Victor J 2425 5.5\n\nIM Haik, Aldo 2405 5.5\n\nGM Alburt, Lev O 2515 5.0\n\nGM De Firmian, Nick E 2515 5.0\n\nIM McCambridge, Vincent 2465 5.0\n\nhttps://www.365chess.com/tournaments/New_York_op_1984/22775\n\nOne of the opponents Boris faced in this tournament was Canadian Grandmaster Kevin Spraggett:\n\nKevin Spraggett (2540) vs Boris Kogan (2450)\n\nEvent: New York op\n\nSite: New York Date: ??/??/1984\n\nRound: 5\n\nECO: A20 English opening\n\n1.c4 e5 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.Nc3 Ne7 5.e4 Nbc6 6.Nge2 d6 7.d3 O-O 8.O-O f5 9.exf5 Nxf5 10.Rb1 Nfd4 11.Nxd4 Nxd4 12.b4 a6 13.Be3 Rb8 14.a4 Be6 15.h3 h6 16.Kh2 g5 17.b5 a5 18.b6 c6 19.Ne4 Qd7 20.Bc1 Rf7 21.Ba3 Bf8 22.Qh5 Bf5 23.f4 exf4 24.gxf4 d5 25.Bxf8 Rbxf8 26.cxd5 cxd5 27.Nc3 Bxd3 28.Qxh6 Bxb1 29.Rxb1 Nf5 30.Qxg5+ Kh8 31.Nxd5 Qxa4 32.Rc1 Qd4 33.Rc7 a4 34.Qh5+ Kg8 35.Qg6+ Rg7 36.Qe6+ Kh7 37.Qe2 a3 38.Qh5+ Kg8 39.Rxg7+ Qxg7 40.Qe2 Qb2 41.Qg4+ Kh7 42.Qh5+ Nh6 43.Ne7 Rf6 44.Nd5 Rg6 0-1\n\nhttps://www.365chess.com/game.php?gid=2378704\n\nWho is Kevin Spraggett?\n\nFull name Kevin Spraggett\n\nCountry Canada\n\nBorn 10 November 1954\n\nMontreal, Canada\n\nTitle GM\n\nKevin Spraggett (born 10 November 1954) is a Canadian chess grandmaster. He is the fourth Canadian to earn the grandmaster title, after Abe Yanofsky, Duncan Suttles and Peter Biyiasas. Spraggett is the only Canadian to have qualified for the Candidates’ level, having done so in 1985 and 1988. He has won a total of eight Canadian Open Chess Championships, seven Closed Canadian Chess Championships, and has represented Canada eight times in Olympiad play. Spraggett has also written for Canadian chess publications.\n\nhttps://gambiter.com/chess/players/Kevin_spraggett.html\n\nThese days Kevin is probably better known for his excellent blog, http://www.spraggettonchess.com/, though it has been quite some time since Kevin has posted. GM Spraggett wrote that he, and other GMs, considered Boris a fellow Grandmaster without the title. Please note that the above game, and the one below, were played when Kevin was at the top of his game. The next year he qualified as a contender for the right to play the World Champion by qualifying for the Candidates matches.\n\nThe only Canadian ever to have qualified for a candidates tournament was Kevin Spraggett of Montreal, who played in the 1985 and 1988-89 tournaments. He made it to the quarter-finals in his second attempt.\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-top-chess-players-meet-in-spain-to-decide-next-world-championship/\n\nKevin Spraggett (2540) vs Boris M Kogan (2450)\n\nDate: 1984\n\nEvent: World Open\n\nRound: 1\n\nOpening: English Opening, Anglo-Slav Variation, General (A11)\n\nProblems: 53159\n\nc4 c6 2.

If your peers consider you to be a Grandmaster who cares what some antiquated organization says or does?\n\nI thought of Boris when reading an excellent article in the 2020 #1 issue of New In Chess entitled, Kamran Shirazi ‘I Never Stopped Loving This Game’: A legendary player still chasing the Grandmaster title, by Dylan Loeb McClain. In the article Shirazi said, ‘I put my whole spirit into this and not to be a grandmaster is a little bit too much.’\n\nIn order to earn the Grandmaster title a player must jump through many hoops. FIDE, the world governing body of Chess, has instituted many picayune rules and In order to earn the Grandmaster title a player must jump through many hoops.\n\nCruel twist of fate\n\nFrustrated with the relatively few tournaments that offered grandmaster norms, Shirazi moved to France, in 1994. Though he was already in his 40s, he experienced a rebirth and his results in tournaments with grandmaster norms improved.\n\nIn a 1998 tournament in Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, a seaside town in Northern France, he gained his first norm. Four years later, in Cannes, he earned his second. And then, another four years later, in 2006, in Metz, he earned his third and final norm needed for the title. That should have been enough, but for a cruel twist of fate. During the Cannes tournament, in the penultimate round, he reached his peak rating: 2499, only a point shy of what he needed for the title. According to the rules, achieving a rating of 2500 once in a lifetime is sufficient, even if the required norms are gained later. If Shirazi had won or drawn his final game, his rating would have been over 2500. But he did not know how close he was – it was still a time before rating updates were done after each round. So, in the final round, Shirazi overpressed in a good position and lost. He ended the tournament with a rating of 2486. ‘I missed by one point’, he said, with a hint of incredulity.\n\nI mention this because of something seen in the last round of a Chess tournament in New Orleans, the Plaza in Lake Forest tournament, if memory serves. The two top rated players were Kamran Shirazi and Boris Kogan, and it came down to a battle with only seconds on the clock. The two combatants were moving with such speed it was difficult to follow the moves. Boris had a time advantage and the players were moving at blitz speed when, all of a sudden, Shirazi STOPPED THE CLOCK! Boris took that as a resignation, but Shirazi said he stopped the clock because it was obvious they were only moving the same pieces around and the tournament director should have stepped in and declared the game a draw by repetition. Boris scoffed, but honesty compels me to agree that Shirazi had a point. The problem was that the TD was unqualified and had absolutely no clue what to do. There had been a group of at least a couple of dozen players watching who had been electrified by what they had just witnessed. Although Boris could speak English, it was somewhat mangled, and I became his spokesman. Shirazi also had his spokesman and there was a shouting match between the two of us. Keep in mind this was a time when the Iranians had defied convention and taken United States citizens working at the embassy hostage. My counterpart invited me to “step outside.” The answer was fired immediately. “Let’s go, dude. I’ve got at least a couple of dozen red-blooded Americans right here, right now, ready to step outside with a couple of IRANIANS!!!” Kamran and his buddy beat a hasty retreat to the hotel… The tournament director later paid out the prize money as if the game had been drawn, and the USCF backed him up. Boris never got over it, lamenting, “He stopped the clock…”\n\nIf one did not know how FIDE has operated over the decades it would be difficult to understand why neither player became a Grandmaster. Certainly both players were of Grandmaster caliber and both should have been awarded the title because the title has been awarded to much lesser players. Because of things like this the title has lost its luster.\n\nThe Ironman Chess Club began over nineteen years ago by the self-proclaimed “Legendary Georgia Ironman,” Tim Brookshear.\n\nDuring that time the club has met on the first and third Tuesday evening of each month. The first location was in the Church of Decatur Heights, which was a nice location because of the large meeting area, and better yet, ancillary rooms for parents to use while their children played Chess. Unfortunately, times changed and as the older people left they were replaced by new people, some of whom could not understand using the space for anything other than worship a nebulous entity that may, or may not, be. Although the Ironman’s parents had attended the church Tim preferred playing in the fourth round of a weekend Swiss tournament. “Bacon,” he would say, “Chess is my church.” The old pastor left and was replaced. The club continue meeting, but there was this one particularly nasty “church lady,” no doubt filled with the spirit, who wanted what she considered the blasphemous Chess players eradicated. The woman, may she burn in Hell, got her wish and the club had to be moved. The new location was the North Dekalb Mall. For many years the club met in the food court, which was a trip, what with all the passersby and attendant noise. Still, it was free and you cannot beat free, especially when it comes to Chess. This lasted some years before the mall began losing tenants. Near the end there was only one restaurant open in the once bustling food court, but still the Ironman CC continued meeting twice a month. Then there were none, and the mall stopped turning on the main lights. There was still a modicum of light and the ICC continued meeting. The roof began leaking, but still the ICC met. One father would bring his three boys all the way from the north side, which was something because the Ironman began at six pm. The traffic that time of day is a nightmare on a good day. People new to Chess would somehow find the club. GCA board members would come to play, along with absolute beginners and those of Master strength. The Ironman Chess Club was certainly sui generis.\n\nThen one evening an obviously mentally deranged woman screamed and hit her child, which was in a stroller, and stayed there most of the evening, screaming and slapping the poor child. The Ironman lost more than several regulars after that meeting. The woman caused the Ironman to move into the back room of Challengers, an game store owned by a nice fellow, Tony, who had actually played youth Chess while in school. There was enough room for a couple of dozen players in the back room, which was used for gaming and storage.\n\nThe last meeting of the Ironman CC held at the North Dekalb Mall was March 19, the second Tuesday of the month. For obvious reasons only a few people attended. I was not one of them. The mall finally closed and could not meet this past Tuesday, April 7, 2020. Yet there was a meeting, of sorts, of the Ironman Chess Club…\n\nAfter having mentioned another game to show the Ironman earlier I had found another, making two games for me to “present” the Ironman. Tim said, “The Ironman may not be meting tonight but I intend on sitting down at the board to study Chess. How about you showing me one of those games you said you wanted me to see tonight, Mike?” Wa-la, a meeting of the Ironman CC!\n\nMany of, if not most of you readers may have seen this game, but it was not in the Ironman’s purview. I urge you to play over the game the old fashioned way, on a board with pieces while covering the moves in order to see the beauty of the game, which would have made Mikhail Tal proud. Look at it from the black perspective in an attempt to find the moves made by GM Vitaliy Bernadskiy. When first starting out in Chess the Kings Indian Defense was my main defense against 1 d4, because Bobby played the KID. I liked the way black could use a slow build up to attack white. Later I moved on to the Grunfeld, before moving on to the Dutch, specifically, the Leningrad Dutch, as regular readers must certainly know…\n\nMarc Narciso Dublan (2516)\n\nvs Vitaliy Bernadskiy (2593)\n\n8th Lorca Open 2019 Spain\n\n12/29/2019\n\nE60 King’s Indian defence\n\n1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.f3 Bg7 4.e4 O-O 5.Nc3 c6 6.Be3 d6 7.Nge2 a6 8.c5 Nbd7 9.cxd6 exd6 10.Ng3 b5 11.Be2 c5 12.O-O cxd4 13.Bxd4 Bb7 14.Re1 Rc8 15.Bf1 Re8 16.Rc1 Ne5 17.Qb3 h5 18.Nh1 Nxf3+ 19.gxf3 Nxe4 20.fxe4 Bxd4+ 21.Nf2 Qh4 22.Rc2 Rxc3 23.bxc3 Qg5+ 24.Bg2 Rxe4 25.Kf1 Qxg2+ 26.Kxg2 Rxe1+ 27.Ne4 Bxe4+ 28.Kg3 Rg1+ 0-1\n\nhttps://www.365chess.com/game.php?gid=4246334\n\nNarciso Dublan v Bernadskiy\n\n1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 f3 (What would Ben Finegold say?

This exact position appeared on the board at a tournament in Atlanta many decades ago. My opponent was John W. Smith, or as he was called, “Smitty,” a player known for his love of the English opening. Both Stockfish and Komodo at the ChessBaseDataBase show 7 d4 as best. When I mentioned this to SM Brian McCarthy\n\nrecently he let me know in no uncertain terms, “d3 is a perfectly acceptable way of playing against the Leningrad.” Still, I recall feeling by not moving the d-pawn two squares a concession had been made. After losing, Smitty withdrew even though there were more rounds to play (uncertain how many, but I think there were at least two more games, maybe three…) and was not seen for some time. When next we did meet Smitty was not friendly…Many years passed, possibly a decade or more, until our paths crossed again. Cousin Linda and I had gotten together and stopped to eat at the Bar-B-Que Kitchen on Virginia Avenue, near the airport. As we sat down I saw Smitty at the register paying the tab. As he walked out of the door I leapt up, excused myself, and went outside to greet him. He had just gotten his wife and daughter into the car when I approached with my hand extended. Smitty had a stern look on his face as if he were deciding whether or not to take my hand. He decided to shake my hand, so I asked him why him had turned on me. “Mike,” he began, “If I had won or drawn the last game we played my rating would have gone over 2200 and I would have become a NM. Earning the certificate meant everything to me because I could show it to my children in the future. I had it all worked out, and would have withdrawn after scoring against you. It was the toughest loss I ever had, and it took it out of me. After losing that game I lost the desire to attempt climbing the hill again.” At a loss for words, I managing to get out, “It was good to see you, Smitty.” He replied, “I cannot say the same, Bacon.” He turned and got into the car without saying another word or even looking at me…As an aside, when I mentioned this to Tim Brookshear\n\nhe related Smitty had beaten him causing his rating to fall beneath 2200, and it never again crossed back into NM range. “I didn’t hold it against Smitty, Mike,” the ironman said.\n\n7…c6 8.

Sabine passed away July 31. He was 78 years old.\n\nSabine grew up in Cumberland County, graduating from Cumberland County High School in 1958. He attended the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and returned to Crossville to practice law in 1968.\n\nHe also served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a captain, including one tour of duty in Vietnam.\n\nHe and his wife, Michelle Ann, had two sons, Steve and Jay.\n\nSabine was a champion of chess in the schools and community. He organized the Scholastic Chess program for Cumberland County beginning in 1973. The program garnered more than 20 state championships for the schools and top honors in national tournaments for Martin Junior High Chess Club in 1982 and 1985.\n\nIn 2003, Sabine began working to bring the U.S. Chess Federation to Crossville. The organization moved its national headquarters to Cumberland County in 2006.\n\nSabine also served four terms on the Cumberland County Commission representing the First Civil District.\n\nFuneral arrangements have not been announced by the family at this time.”\n\nhttps://www.crossville-chronicle.com/news/local_news/former-commissioner-chess-champion-harry-sabine-passes/article_8d917630-b48b-11e9-9eb5-ff3cf7e3178c.html\n\nThe last time I saw Harry was at the 2009 U.S. Open in Indianapolis, Indiana in 2009. I had travelled from Louisville with one of my older students, Rick Rothenburg, for a day trip. An old friend, the Legendary Georgia Ironman, Tim Brookshear, was the first to greet me in the parking lot. We talked for awhile before I walked inside. After entering the main playing hall the first person to greet me was Ryan Velez. He was playing but stood up and walked over to shake my hand and say hello. As he did so I noticed this large, hulking man break into a huge grin as he began ambling toward me from the front of the room. I, too, was grinning as I walked toward Harry Sabine, who had his outstretched hand pointing in my direction long before close enough to actually clasp hands. This was the first time we had seen each other since my publishing a post on the old, now defunct, BaconLOG, which follows.\n\nMonday, June 1, 2009\n\nTennessee Senior Open\n\nThe Tennessee Senior Open was a wonderful event! Not feeling my best, I decided to play the first round Sat morning, in lieu of Fri night, but attended the opening ceremonies at the Fair Park Senior Center that evening. The Mayor, J.H. Graham III, welcomed us with open arms. I told him the following story: I left my hotel room after changing pants, as it was warm enough for shorts. After ordering a couple of burrito’s at Taco Bell, I realized the money was still in the jeans. I felt foolish, but the employee, Nan Turner, handed me the grub, saying it would be on her! I simply could not believe it! I mean, that does not happen in a large city like Atlanta. The next day I stopped by and gave her the money, which included a decent tip, which she attempted to refuse, to no avail. This is a perfect illustration of the difference between a big city and a small town. I learned that during my stay in Hendersonville, NC. My theory is that people are much more friendly in a small town because they realize the people they encounter one day at a restaurant may be the same person they encounter at the library the next day. In a big city, one thinks they will never see that person again. It is the people who constitute a community, whether Crossville, Tn., or our small chess community. This has to be one of the major reasons Crossville was chosen to be the new USCF HQ. A better place could not have been found. The next morning, upon my arrival, the Mayor greeted me, giving me his card and asking if I would send him the tale I told him the previous night via email. Then, when it came time for the picture, the Mayor asked me to stand beside him. Several others said a few words in greeting us, too, so the first round began a little late, which is very unusual for “Head ‘em up, move ‘em out” Harry Sabine, as he’s known for getting the round started on time. There was a drawing for prizes donated by the Crossville community, and I was fortunate enough to win one. There was free coffee, drinks and snacks for all the players, which was a real nice touch. Harry was the head TD, capably assisted by Susan Houston, an employee of the USCF, and her son, Charley, who kept us updated on the US Championship. Harry is training Charley; passing the torch, so to speak. Charley is quite young, and was, therefore, reluctant to tell we Seniors to be quite, so I told him he was a TD, and to say what needed to be said, since he was ‘The Man’. I smiled when Charley told a group, including me, to “keep it down.” Susan remarked the tournament had a different feel to it than any other she has attended, with the players acting more like a family reunion, or homecoming. Susan handled the ‘puter and also served as I like to think of her, as ‘Chess Mom’. She also coordinated trips for the players to the HQ. I went by earlier in the week, seeing old friends like Chuck Lovingood and Jay Sabine (and watching games from the US Championship!), Walter Brown, Alan Kantor, etc., and meeting new friends. The Fair Park Senior Center was a fine place for the tournament. The lighting was superior, far better than the recent Georgia State Championship, for example. Lighting is especially important for Senior players. Different folks from the Senior Center welcomed us, making us feel right at home. As I sat there listening to these wonderful people, I thought this is the kind of greeting I’ve read about on the web in European countries. It made me feel proud to be a chess player as they made us feel special. There were 35 players, far exceeding the small turnouts for previous Tennessee Senior tournaments, which were only a one day event with a G/60 time control. I think part of the reason was a tribute to Harry Sabine. We still miss the Fairfield Glade after all these years! One year it snowed heavily and we were stranded Sunday night but the Glade did not charge us for the room! Players came from half a dozen different states, with one player originally from England and one from the Netherlands. NM Henry Robinson took first, 4-0. The fine Chess Café historical writer, Jerry Spinrad, was clear second with 3 ½. Seven players tied for third with a score of 3-1. I was in that group, losing only to Henry. An ornate chess set was donated by the Fair Park Senior Center and it went to the biggest upset (I asked Harry if that meant the largest rating differential, or the player who got the most upset after a loss, which brought a smile to his mug). My first round opponent, Larry Grohn, rated 880, bested my third round opponent, Wieb Van Der Meer, 1420, in the last round to take the prize. Mucho Kudos to Harry Sabine for holding this event! Although Harry and I have had our differences over the years, I prefer to think of it as a disagreement with a TD, not the man. The man is someone with whom I have shared a drink of Jack Daniels (what else would Harry drink?!), and invited into the Atlanta Chess Center on a day it was closed for Thanksgiving, make a cuppa joe, and have a conversation while showing him around the House of Pain. The best part was the look on Harry’s face when I opened the door after his knock! I knew it was Harry after glancing out the window and seeing his orange tennis shoes! I must have been the last person Harry expected to see. Knowing Harry had been a Marine I mentioned a man from the old neighborhood who had also been a Marine during World War Two, Sloppy Floyd Bailey, who had said, “Once a jarhead, always a jarhead!” Harry smiled before saying, “Sloppy Floyd knew what he was talking about.”\n\nThe worst thing I heard about Harry while in Crossville was that he is a “fine man.” And I heard it not once, but many times. “Oh, you know Harry Sabine? He’s a such a nice man.” Or, “Harry Sabine is a wonderful man.” You must come to Crossville in order to understand what having the USCF HQ means to this community. These people are PROUD, and Harry Sabine, as the Mayor said, deserves much credit. The modest Harry pointed out the work of others. I can think of no one better than Harry to coordinate a Senior tournament in all 50 states! Senior chess is bringing players back to the game, in some cases after many years out of chess. I would like to thank Harry, Susan, Charley, and everyone else for a wonderful time here in the mountains…\n\nDuring the meeting of the Ironman Chess Club Tuesday, July 16, 2019 I was able to question the owner of Championship Chess, (https://www.championshipchess.net/) Steve Schneider,\n\na man I have known since the 1970’s, and for whom I once worked teaching Chess to children in an after school program. Our ‘conversation’ turned into an interview. There were others listening to our discussion. Without those witnesses I would be unable to publish this interview. It began after Steve, who is elderly, and like many older people, battling myriad health issues, including life threatening blood clots in his legs, stated, “I spend eighteen hours a day on Chess.” I did not question this because it is common knowledge Steve ‘burns the midnight oil’, sending emails into the wee hours of the night. I was holding a Championship Chess flyer for the 8th annual K-12 Summer Scorcher Chess tournament, which includes, on the back, the first twenty moves of the game between World Human Chess Co-Champion (at classical Chess) Magnus Carlsen and Sharsidden Vokhidov from the 2018 World Rapid Championship, titled “The Queen’s Raid.”\n\nMe: “I see you are still teaching the Queen’s Raid.”\n\nSteve: “There is nothing wrong with teaching the Queen’s Raid. It’s a good opening. Look at who plays it!”\n\nMe: “Come on, Steve.”\n\nSteve: “All the computers say it’s a playable opening!”\n\nMe: “Which computers?”\n\nSteve: “Stockfish, and all the top programs! Stockfish says white is better in the game!” (Referring to the aforementioned game printed on the back of the flyer. For years a Championship Chess flyer contained Chess puzzles chosen by NM Tim Brookshear. The Queen’s Raid game appears because Tim, for various reasons, decided to no longer produce the puzzles, allowing Steve’s atavistic tendencies to rear their ugly head. Hence the Queen’s Raid, something near and dear to the heart of the owner of Championship Chess. A case can be made that Championship Chess was predicated upon the Queen’s Raid, which has become synonymous with Championship Chess. The Queen’s Raid is the foundation of Championship Chess. Steve Schneider will invariably be known as the “Queen’s Raid guy.”)\n\nMe: “When, exactly, is white better according to Stockfish, Steve?”\n\nSteve: “In all the diagrams!”\n\nMe: “Come on, Steve.”\n\nSteve: Except where Magnus missed the best move in the last diagram.”\n\nMe: “But the diagram is before Carlsen, as you say, ‘…missed the best move.'”\n\nSteve: “Then he’s better there, too!”\n\n(All I could do was shake my head as I muttered “unbelievable.” I then decided to move to a different subject. Granted, Magnus was better but only after his opponent played a theoretical novelty that was an extremely weak move, 4…Qe7. The Patzer is so bad that even with the inclusion of the weak move Qe7 the game is considered about even by “all of the programs.”)\n\nMe: “What’s the deal with the World of Chess?” (Steve has spent much money having someone develop a program for beginners to which he sells access to unknowing parents of children who are in Championship Chess after school programs. I had previously seen a flyer for The World of Chess at the Ironman CC)\n\nSteve: “What do you mean?”\n\nMe: “Is it operational?”\n\nSteve: “Yes.”\n\nMe: “I looked for it on the internet but could not locate it.”\n\nSteve: “Not just anyone can get to it.”\n\nMe: “I would like to review it, Steve.”\n\nSteve: “I DO NOT WANT IT REVIEWED!”\n\nMe: “You don’t want it reviewed?” (Asked with incredulity)\n\nSteve: “Why would I want others to see it?”\n\nMe: “When a new product is developed it is usually reviewed…”\n\nSteve: “You have to pay first.”\n\nMe: “You must pay before even checking it out?”\n\nSteve: “Yes.”\n\nMe: “I understand it is similar to Mike Klein’s ChessKid, (https://www.chesskid.com/) which is free.”\n\nSteve: “It’s NOT free. You must pay!”\n\nMe: “I checked out ChessKid and there is much free content for anyone to see and use…”\n\nSteve: “ChessKid really took off after he came to one of my lectures and stole my ideas.”\n\nMe: “Who came to your lecture?”\n\nSteve: “Mike Klein came to a lecture in Alabama. Most of what’s on ChessKid he took from me!”\n\nMe: “But Steve, ChessKid has been around since long before you developed The World of Chess.”\n\nSteve: “And you have to pay.”\n\nMe: “But you can check it out before paying.”\n\nSteve: “I’m not giving anything away. You must pay first!”\n\nAt this point Steve’s face was beet red and he was in a highly agitated state, so there were no further questions as others began to query “Coach Steve.”\n\nThis is my attempt to reproduce the Championship Chess flyer:\n\nECO20 The Queen’s Raid (At the 365Chess.com website you will find this-C20 KP, Patzer opening) (https://www.365chess.com/opening.php?m=4&n=332&ms=e4.e5.Qh5&ns=3.5.332)\n\nCarlsen, Magnus (2835)\n\nVokhidov, Shamsiddin (2480)\n\nWorld Rapid Championship 12.2018\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 Nc6 3.Bc4 g6 4.Qf3 Qe7 5.Ne2 Nf6 6.d3 Bg7 7.Nbc3\n\nTypical opening moves where the players are even. h6 8.Nd5 Nxd5 9.exd5 Na5 10.d6\n\nCarlsen prevents Black from trading his Bishop. He sacrifices a Pawn for better development.cxd6 11.Bd5 Nc6 12.Bd2 Qf6 13.Qe4 O-O 14.O-O Ne7 15.Nc3 Qf5 16.Qb4 Nxd5\n\nBlack trades a Knight for a Bishop. 17.Nxd5 Kh7 18.Nc7 Rb8 19.Qxd6\n\nWhite is better. b6 20.f3 Here Carlsen missed the best move Ne8! 0-1\n\nI went to 365Chess and the “Big Database” contains 281 games with white winning 36.3% while losing 50.9%. The ChessBaseDataBase contains only 35 games because it is more selective, containing mostly games by titled players. It shows white scoring only 44%.\n\nThe CBDB shows what the engines ‘thought’ of the opening moves played in the Carlsen v Vokhidov game.\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 (After this move SF 10 at D43 shows an evaluation of -0.50 for white after black plays 2…Nc6 ; Komodo 12 has it -0.20)\n\nNc6 3.Bc4 g6 4.Qf3 (Although Stockfish at Depth 43 plays the game move Komodo 12 at D42 prefers 4 Qd1)\n\n4…Qe7? (There is only one game with this move in the CBDB. Komodo has it -0.02 after 5 Ne2. There are 25 games with 4…Nf6, SF has it -0.56. Vokhidov did not know the opening, which may have contributed to the thinking of Magnus Carlsen before playing The Patzer. Magnus has never played it again. There is a reason…) 5.Ne2 Nf6 (The Fish and the Dragon both play 5…Na5) 6.d3 (SF 10 plays 6 Nbc3) 6…Bg7 (Komodo and Houdini play the game move but Stockfish plays 6…h6, which will be a Theoretical Novelty if and when a titled human player makes the move on a board) 7.Nbc3 (SF 10 shows an advantage of -0.39 after 7…Nd4) 7…h6 8.Nd5 (SF 8 h3; Houdini 8 Be3) 8…Nxd5 9.exd5 Na5 ( According to both SF and Houdini 9…Nb4 is better) 10.d6 cxd6 11.Bd5 Nc6 (SF 11…Rb8) 12.Bd2 (This is Komodo’s move; Houdini plays 12 Qe4) 12…Qf6 (SF 10 castles)\n\nAfter publishing the post, Chess Grit (https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2019/06/22/chess-grit/), I asked SM Brian McCarthy for feedback. A few days later Brian visited before returning to south Georgia where he is a High School teacher. I was shocked upon hearing, “You were too hard on Steve. I have worked for Championship Chess. There is nothing wrong with his method because he is an educator.” I was at a loss for words. It took a few seconds for me to get over the shock before responding, “Brian, I have a problem with anyone who teaches the Queen’s Raid.” Brian replied, “There is nothing wrong with teaching the Queen’s Raid; every player needs to know how to defend against it.”\n\n“Brian, there is a world of difference between teaching a beginner how to defend against the Queen’s raid and teaching a beginner how to play it in order to win a game quickly.” After his retort I cut the conversation short because Brian has been having major health issues. Still, his reaction stung, and left an impression.\n\nBrian’s picture can be found at the Championship Chess website:\n\nI, too, have previously worked for Championship Chess(https://www.championshipchess.net/), because money was needed. Before heading to the first school as a member of the Championship “team” I was given a quick course in the Championship “method” of teaching Chess to children by Steve Schneider, one of the owners of CC, who indoctrinated me in the Championship Chess way, which included how to teach the Queen’s Raid, aka the Patzer, and pawn games, before being driven by the co-owner, Dennis Jones, to a school, where Dennis was to observe how I followed the CC “method.” On the way I asked Dennis if the other “coaches” followed the CC method. “Some do,” he replied, “But the stronger players do what they want. Are you a stronger player?” he asked. Dennis had given me all the information needed. While Dennis watched I gave lip service to “pawn games” and the “Queen’s raid,” but only to teach the children how to avoid the pitfall of being checkmated with the early raid of the Queen. It was the last time I used even part of the Championship Chess “method.”\n\nSteve Schneider\n\nwas a school teacher “back in the day.” At the CC website one finds: “Coach Steve Schneider began working with children and chess when he taught his 6-year-old son to play.” https://www.championshipchess.net/about-steve-schneider/#\n\nI previously mentioned on this blog the time the Ol’ Swindler said about me, “Ummm… You’re a nineteen hundred.” Although I crossed the expert threshold he, and others I suppose, will always think of me as a “1900.” I’m OK with that, because “back in the day” the highest rated player who actually played regularly in Atlanta was Tom Pate, rated in the upper 1900’s. I think of Steve as a “Fourteen hundred.” USCF shows a current rating of 1379. The co-owner, Dennis Jones, is listed at the USCF MSA page as a “one thousand” player, albeit in limited action as he is still a “provisionally rated” player.\n\nAt one time Championship Chess could boast of having many higher rated “coaches” but that was in the past. For various reasons, including low wages and being forced to teach the Championship Chess “method,” the higher rated teachers left CC and were replaced by teachers rated, if they were rated, even lower than the owners. The Championship Chess brain trust wanted employees who would “toe the line” and “teach the Championship Chess way.”\n\nThe Legendary Georgia Ironman, Tim Brookshear relates a story concerning a game Steve played with one of his “coaches,” a fellow named Lynwood, at the Ironman Chess Club.\n\nLynwood playing at the Ironman Chess Club recently\n\nAs the story goes Lynwood was called over by “Coach Steve” for “training.” It seems Lynwood had been “called into the principal’s office” earlier because he had not been following the CC “method.” Lynwood was assisting “Coach Tim” and the Ironman was not one to teach any way other than his way, which happens to be the way most “approved” Chess teachers go about teaching Chess, which most definitely does not include teaching children to play the “Queen’s Raid” in order to gain a quick victory. “Lynwood was great,” said the Ironman, “He would do whatever asked of him, and was great with the children because of his demeanor.” Poor Lynwood was caught between a rock and a hard place. Should he do what the General back at HQ said and stick his head up out of the foxhole to gather much needed information, or do what the Sargent in the foxhole said and keep his head down?\n\nLynwood vs Coach Steve\n\n1 e4 e5 2 Qh5\n\n(It all begins with the Queen’s Raid at Championship Chess! If there is any Chess player who should be able to defend against the Queen’s Raid that man was sitting across from Lynwood as General of the black pieces) 2…Nc6 3 Bc4 g6 4 Qf3 Nf6 5 Ne2 d6\n\n(Stockfish plays this move but the Championship Chess “main line” in the Patzer is 5…Bg7. Therefore it would appear Coach Steve was the first to vary from the Championship Chess approved method of playing The Patzer) 6 0-0\n\n(This move is not in the CBDB) Bg4 7 Qb3 Be2 8 Bf7+ Ke7 9 Qe6 mate\n\nIn lieu of a resignation coach Steve erupted, “NO, NO, NO Lynwood, you’re not using the patterns!” After Tim pointed out to Steve that Lynwood had not been the one to break the “pattern” coach Steve blurted, “Once he broke the pattern I stopped paying attention!”\n\nDon’t you just hate it when that happens?!\n\nSteve, with much help from others, has written several Chess books for beginners, most, if not all, of which are laughable. I say this because while recalling being regaled with stories of laughable previous editions before being corrected. Tim mentioned going to a school and having his young students “correct” some of the many errors in the books. The mistakes were a riot, causing much laughter by the students.\n\nDuring a conversation with Steve he expressed displeasure with the way I was teaching the Royal game, which was definitely NOT using the Championship Chess method. I had been teaching how to checkmate using only a few pieces when Steve had rather my time be spent teaching pawn games. “But Steve, I began, “Bobby Fischer wrote a book for beginners which was all about how to checkmate.” (Which is what Chess was all about before it became how to draw quickly)\n\n“What did Bobby Fischer know about teaching Chess to children?” he asked. I was incredulous, and frankly, cannot recall exactly what was said after hearing his ridiculous question. I do, though, recall posing the question, “You mean you know more about teaching Chess than the greatest Chess player of all-time?” To which Steve responded, “Yes. I know more about teaching than he did.” Granted, Steve graduated from a college where he was taught how to teach, whereas Bobby was basically self-taught, but still…\n\nI will never forget the first time attending a scholastic tournament. The memory of where it was being held has vanished. I do recall Steve and Lew Martin escorting some of the youngest children into the playing room. Anyone who has ever attended a Chess tournament, especially if one has worked at a Chess tournament, knows the feeling when the round begins and all is quiet for at least a brief period of time. That was not the case at this tournament because about a minute later the first children began returning from the playing hall, some elated, some crying. The Queen’s Raid had done its work as some beginners had yet to be taught how to defend against the The Patzer. Parents of the winners were pleased as punch while the losing parents were mortified to see their child in tears. When the first little children began returning I asked with incredulity, “You mean the games have already finished?” A smiling and proudly pleased Lew Martin said, “That’s how it is in scholastic Chess.”\n\n“This is not Chess,” was my response. It was more than a little obvious that teaching Chess to children to some could be distilled to, “Show me the money!”\n\nThis is part one of a two part series, which will follow with the next post."
