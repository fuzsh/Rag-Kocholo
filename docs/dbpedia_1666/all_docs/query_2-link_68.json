        "text": "Jamie Maclaren simply cannot stop scoring â€” and he has equalled a 25-year-old record to prove it.\n\nThe Melbourne City star's 92nd-minute winner against Western Sydney Wanderers at Paramatta stadium was the ninth goal he has scored in just four matches this A-League season.\n\nThat is an average of one goal every 36 minutes he has been on the park, a rate that has not even been interrupted by a hamstring injury that ruled him out of matches in rounds three and four.\n\nThis record of nine goals in four games equals that set by three other legends of the game.\n\nDixie Deans (Adelaide City, 1977), John Kosmina (Sydney City, 1984) and Carl Veart (Adelaide City, 1994) all managed the same feat in the defunct National Soccer League.\n\nThe most goals a player has scored in five games is 10.\n\nPerhaps more impressively, Maclaren has now scored multiple goals in each of his four A-League starts.\n\nAccording to the FFA's chief statistician Andrew Howe, this equals Damian Mori's efforts for Adelaide City in March 1996.\n\nNobody has managed multiple goals in five-straight games.\n\nMaclaren's City have a home game on Friday night against reigning champions Perth Glory, who have conceded just six goals in five matches so far this season, the equal-stingiest defensive record in the league.\n\nMaclaren's prolific start to the 2019/20 season\n\nMaclaren's prolific goalscoring return has come from 15 shots, 12 of which have been on target. It's an economy that's not been missed by City coach Erick Mombaerts.\n\n\"He is our striker,\" Mombaerts said with the grin of a coach whose team just won with a last-minute winner.\n\n\"He don't [sic] need too many chances to score.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nIn fact, anyone who has seen the Socceroos striker play this season may come to the conclusion that he looks like scoring every time he gets anywhere near the penalty area â€” and for good reason.\n\nAll nine of those goals â€” and shots â€” have come from inside the 18-yard box.\n\nMaclaren's prolific start to the season is, admittedly, from a small sample size, but it has not been limited to the A-League.\n\nMaclaren missed the season-opening Melbourne derby against Victory â€” a goalless draw â€” but only because he was banging in goals for the Socceroos instead.\n\nTwo games against Nepal and Chinese Taipei brought four more goals to his tally, including his \"proudest moment\" a hat-trick in Canberra against the limited, albeit spirited Nepal.\n\nMaclaren had to wait until his 10th cap to score his first international goal, raising questions over his viability as an international-standard striker.\n\nNow that he has broken his international duck, those questions are no longer being asked.\n\nThat brings his goalscoring tally for the season to 13 goals in six games.\n\nThen there's the FFA Cup.\n\nThe only match in which Maclaren has failed to score this season came in the final â€” a match in which City were comprehensively beaten by Adelaide United and Maclaren took the back seat to Al Hasan Toure â€” however that was barely a hiccup, his form in the earlier rounds more than hinting at the glut of goals to come.\n\nSix goals across five matches â€” including that goalless final performance â€” showed that Maclaren was in serious form heading into this summer.\n\nMaclaren set for a grander stage?\n\nMaclaren is no stranger to accumulating a vast number of goals.\n\nIn two seasons with the Brisbane Roar, he scored 40 goals in 53 games, after notching 11 for Perth Glory across the two seasons prior.\n\nThat prolific return saw Maclaren try his hand overseas, although with limited success.\n\nAn eight-game spell in the German second division with Darmstadt proved barren territory for the Melbourne-born striker, forcing a move to Scottish Premier League side Hibernian in order to boost his chances of being selected for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nReturning to the land of his father â€” and the nation that capped him twice as an under-19 â€” proved the key to regaining goalscoring form for Maclaren, who found the back of the net eight times in 15 appearances to end the season.\n\nHowever, a single goal in 15 appearances to start the following season saw Maclaren return to Australia with Melbourne City.\n\nThere he scored five times in nine matches â€” all five of which came in his first four games â€” and he's continued where he left off this season.\n\nSo, should Maclaren's goal-scoring form catch the attention of European scouts and lead to another attempt to crack one of Europe's big leagues?\n\n\"He is at a very good level,\" Momberts said when asked if Maclaren could, or perhaps should be playing at a higher level.\n\n\"I can't answer this question â€¦ He is also an international player.\n\n\"Maybe, yes, maybe he can play in a level higher than the A-League, I think so.\""
