His most prominent victory was in the1992 US Senior Open where he took top honors defeating Grandmaster ArthurDake in the last round.\n\nNeil has served as a Trustee at the MI for over 30 years. Heis still very much involved with the Chess Room and is a regular at GrandmasterAlex Yermolinsky's weekly lectures on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

This event willnot only be a memorial to Eugene Martinovsky, but will also double as aqualifier for the US Championship with six spots up for grabs. Full detailsare offered below.\n\n5) Chess Display at Davis Public Library\n\nThe Davis branch of the Yolo County Libraryfeatures a large display of old sets, clocks, books and magazines fromaround the world courtesy of Val Zemitis.

The extensive collectionof Foxy Opening videos by GMs Daniel King, Nigel Davies, James Plaskettand IM Andrew Martin will soon be available to check out.\n\nDonations to the MI, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, are tax deductible. The MI acquires new chess booksand videos on a regular basis supplemented by donations from the membership. This has enabled the MI to offer its members one of the largest freelycirculating collections of chess material in the country (700+ books andover 50 videos). However, this policy is now under attack. Over 25% of the chess books at the MI disappeared from 1996 to 2000, amuch greater percentage than any other part of the library collection.These books, which are marked with the MI stamp, can't be resold. The only rationale for their disappearing is that somebody wants to completetheir collection while denying everyone else the use of these materials. This is not a way to generate good karma! If this doesn't stop, moreand more books will be placed in a locked case and only available for usein the library.\n\nNewsletter #72, 01/30/2002\n\n\"Chessplayers are of varyingcharacter. Some, in order to be confident of success, have to seetheir opponents as a friend, while others must, without fail, feel enmitytowards the opponent...

Roundingout the list of plus scores at 3 points, in the 13-player field, were Mezentsev,IM Rey and NM Michael Aigner.\n\nTwo other events in this series open to players rated over 2200, willbe held May 10-12 and June 14-16.

For example, it may mean stubbornlydefending a difficult position for a long time… (or) you may be sittingwith an advantageous position, but meeting resistance from your opponent. Then you need to be tenacious in order to nurture your advantage patiently,keep your opponent under pressure, and finally break down his resistance.\"\n\nGM Paul Motwani\n\n1) 2002 US Masters: Eugene MartinovskyMemorial\n\nGrandmasters Gregory Kaidanov, AlexanderOnischuk, Daniel Fridmans, Leonid Yudasin and Alex Wojtkiewicz tiedfor first in the 2002 US Masters: Eugene Martinovsky Memorial, held February28 to March 3 at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Oak Brook, Illinois. The fivewinners, who were all undefeated at 5 1/2 - 1 1/2, earned $3,000 apiecefor their victory over a 100 player field which included 15 GMs and 15IMs.\n\nGMs Gregory Serper, Dmitry Gurevich,John Fedorowicz and Anatoly Lein, IMs Nikolay Andrianov, John Donaldson,John Watson, and William Paschall plus NM Jason Doss tied for sixththough fourteen, with Serper, Fedorowicz, Donaldson, Watson, Paschall andthe top 4 1/2 on tiebreak, Stanislav Kriventsov, all earning spots in the2003 US Championship, to be held in Seattle January 9-19. Indiana MasterJason Doss, who rebounded from an opening loss to top finishing juniorWilliam Aramil to score 2 from 3 against IMs Donaldson, Rashid Ziatdinovand Fedorowicz down the stretch, could have earned a spot if he had onlypaid his $75 US Championship qualifying fee in advance of round one. Dittofor the 70-year-old Lein who still has the constitution of an ox.The last day he defeated Penn State math professor IM Edward Formanek andGM Nikola Mitkov of Macedonia in long, grueling battles.\n\nThe game with Mitkov was a fitting tributeto the late Dr. Eugene Martinovsky (1931-2000) whose estate helpedsponsor this event. Martinovsky, who emigrated from Yugoslavia in the mid1960s, was one of the top players in Chicago for over three decades andwas particularly noted for his tenaciousness. He would have appreciatedLein's endgame technique which allowed him to a win a Queen ending (W-Kg4,Qb6, Ps f2, f 3, and g3 versus B- Qa1, Kg7, Ps h6 and g5) where his Kingpenetrated to f5 as if by magic from a position that looked quite drawntwenty moves before. The way Lein maneuvered his Queen from the centerof the board to b6 with a series of checks with only 3 minutes left onhis clock drew the admiration of 30 die-hard spectators who stuck aroundto watch the last game of the event finish at 10:30 on Sunday evening.\n\nLein was not the only veteran to shinein Chicago. NM Viktors Pupols of Bremerton, Washington, won the battleof the Latvian-Americans by defeating Chicago SM Andrew Karklins in thefinal round. Several times Pupols had one of the last games to finish inthe round but it didn't seem to bother him. At 67 he has the energyof man half his age. Be prepared when he asks you to join him for a 12mile hike!\n\nPhoenix-based Andrianov, who stillrepresents Russia on the FIDE list, won two very impressive games against2600 FIDE GMs Alexander Goldin and Ildar Ibragimov. He also turned in avery impressive performance in tying for first in the North American Opena couple of years ago and is clearly of GM strength.\n\nThe tough luck story of the tournamentgoes to University of Texas at Dallas top board Yury Shulman whowas among the leaders throughout the event before losing a drawish endgameto Kaidanov in round six and then letting Kriventsov escape with a drawin the final round. This was a rare setback of late for Shulman who iscurrently rated 2596 FIDE putting him right around number 100 in the world.The presence of players like Shulman and Onischuk in American events isa welcome shot in the arm for US chess which hasn't enjoyed an active GMin the 20-30 age group for some time.\n\nThe US Masters is the brainchild of Helenand Jim Warren who have held this event since the early 1980s. This yearthey decided to do something special to honor the memory of Dr. Martinovskyand they succeeded in their aim with the help of tournament directors IATodd Barre and Tim Just plus bulletin editor NM Alan Watson. This is justthe sort of event that Eugene would have wanted to play in.\n\nA list of prize winners follows. A crosstable of the event can be found at http://www.64.com/chess/usmasters/\n\nUS Masters Prize List\n\n1st-5th: GM Gregory Kaidanov,GM Alexander Onischuk, GM Daniel Fridman, GM Leonid Yudasin\n\nGM Aleksander Wojtkiewicz 5.5-1.5 $3,000 ea.\n\n6th: GM Dmitry Gurevich, GM Gregory Serper, GM John Fedorowicz, IM John Donaldson5.0-2.0 $175 ea.\n\n1st-3rd 2400-2499: IM NikolayAndrianov, IM William Paschall, GM Anatoly Lein 5.0-2.0 $366.67 ea.\n\n1st-2nd 2300-2399: IM John Watson,LM Jason Doss 5.0-2.0 $475 ea.\n\nAdditionally, $1,500 in pointpool prizes were split amongst players scoring at least 4.5 points\n\n2) Snyder and Marguliswin Winter Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nSan Francisco National Master IgorMargulis and Berkeley Expert Larry Snyder tied for first at6 1/2 - 1 1/2 in the Mechanics' Institute Winter Tuesday Night Marathonheld January 22-March 5.

Kurt is best known for his organizational abilities, but he tied for first in the 1956 Cal Open with 16-year-old Gil Ramirez and Robert Cross.\n\nNewsletter #80, 03/27/2002\n\n\"As Bobby Fischer said, you have to go for the truth in chess, and if that requires taking on a risky activity, you have to go ahead and do it.\"\n\nEdmar Mednis\n\n1) 4th Annual Bay Area Ohlone Tourney\n\nThe Ohlone tournament this past weekend in Fremont drew about 90 players, allowing organizer Hans Poschmann to pay the full advertised prize fund. The open section went quite according to the ratings, as the top three seeds took the top three prizes. IM Ricardo DeGuzman shook off a major scare in round 1 against expert Jim Uren to sweep the tournament 4-0. He defeated NMs Paul Gallegos and Michael Aigner on the second day. NM David Blohm gave up half a point in round 1 and then cruised to 3.5 and clear second place. At 3.0 were Aigner and top under 2100 prize winner Steve Gaffagan.\n\nCurtis Munson won the reserve section with 4-0 and Maximo Fajardo took clear second with 3.5-0.5. Tyler Arnold and Eric Tsai shared top honors in the booster section with 3.5-0.5 each. The team trophy was won by the Mechanics', with the team of Blohm, Monty Peckham, Gary Huang, and Drake Wang.\n\nThanks to Michael Aigner for this report.\n\n2) Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nThe Spring Tuesday Night Marathon started last night. The 57-player field includes 5 Masters led by top seed Egle Morkunaite. It's still possible to enter the event with a half point bye for the first round.\n\n3) Vallejo Open\n\nIM Ricardo DeGuzman and SM Ronald Cusi tied for first place with 3 1/2 - 1/2 in the Vallejo Open held March 16-17. Approximately 20 players participated in the event directed by Rico Adkins.\n\n4) Dos Hermanas\n\nMechanics' member Eric Schiller did very well in the recent Dos Hermanas/ICC events averaging 75 percent and getting his rating Internet Chess Club rating up to 2550 These events were played with eight minutes aside and a two-second increment and featured many GMs and IMs. Well done Eric!\n\nNewsletter #81, 04/03/2002\n\n\" When your opponent has a strategic advantage and virtually controls the board, or when he attacks\n\nsomething that cannot be defended by reasonable means, then the 'threat' or 'blackmail' with\n\nnonexistent attacks on the king may induce a mistake\".\n\nGM Mihai Suba\n\n1) IM DeGuzman wins Max Wilkerson Open\n\nFilipino IM Ricardo DeGuzman continued his domination of the MI's monthly G/45 events by winning the Max Wilkerson Open on March 30th with a 5-0 score. Among his victims in the 58-player field were Cuban FM Alvaro Blanco and NM Victor Baja (2371). Sharing second with four points were Blanco, Baja, NM Igor Margulis , Expert Alexander Levitan and A players Ben Haun and Felix Rudyak.\n\nDaichi Siegrist and Michael Haun tied for top B with 3 points. The same score gave John\n\nSteele and Vicenzo Pelliccia top C honors and Aviv Adler the D prize. Top E, for the best under 1200, was divided between Mark Altchek, Stephen Wilson, Yuki Siegrist, Dustin Rudiger and Cameron Jackson who each had two points. Max Wilkerson, who served as MI Chess Director from 1980-1996, had an outstanding event drawing masters Margulis and Paul Gallegos. Anthony Corrales directed this event which set an MI G/45 record for attendance.\n\nPlease note that checks for prize winners will be not be mailed out until approximately April 12 as the MI's accountant is taking a well-deserved vacation. The next G/45 event at the MI, The 2nd Imre Konig Memorial, will be held Saturday, April 13.\n\n2) Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nTwo rounds into the MI Spring Tuesday Night Marathon the following players have perfect scores in the 59-player event: NMs Igor Margulis, Russell Wong, David Blohm and Rudy Hernandez, Experts Victor Ossipov, Larry Snyder, Igor Traub, and James Jones plus A players Victor Todortsev (who upset top seed Egle Morkunaite) and Andrew Mueckenburger (who upset Expert Mingson Chen). It's still possible to enter the eight round event with half point byes for rounds one and two.\n\n3) New Space for the Chess Room\n\nParticipants in last night's Tuesday Night Marathon were among the first to get the opportunity to use the Chess Room's new space in Room 407 adjacent to the Directors Office. The MI Chess Room, founded in 1855, is the oldest continuously active chess club in the country, but the space it currently occupies is considerably more recent. The MI moved around a lot in the period 1855-1865, but the following year it found a permanent home in a three story building at 31 Post Street in room 10 where it remained until the earthquake and fire of 1906. A month after these disastrous events the Institute and Chess Room\n\nreopened in temporary quarters. It was not until 1910 that the current building was opened with the Chess. Room located on the third floor. The expansion of the library eventually led to the Chess Room being moved to the fourth floor in 1923 where it has remained to this day albeit with some minor changes.\n\nSometime in the next month construction will begin on a long overdue women's bathroom on the 4th floor which will occupy the space where the Chess Room computers are currently occupied. In return for this lost space the Chess Room now has the full-time use of room 407. This second, dedicated room, will allow for much better conditions for Chess Room users as there is now a designated place for skittles and game analysis during tournaments. The Chess Room would like to thank the MI Trustees, Executive Director Jim Flack, Building Manager Michael Savage, Special Events Director Laura Shepherd, Mohammed Shaikh and Anthony Corrales for their help in making this possible. Jim and Michael also note that due to the speedy move there will be about a month while the Chess Room has both it's old and new space making it possible to hold a tournament with over one hundred players without crowding. The attendance record (pre-fire code!) for the Chess Room was set at the 1974 Stamer Memorial with 119 players. The Max Wilkerson Open last Saturday set a one-day record with 58. Will the Imre Konig Memorial on April 13 break it?\n\n4) 6th Charles Linklater Memorial\n\nThe 6th Charles Linklater International, an 11-player IM norm round robin, starts this Thursday at 5pm. The field consists of IMs Ricardo DeGuzman, Guillermo Rey and John Donaldson, FMs Ricardo Lobo, Vladimir Mezentsev, Cyrus Lakdawala, Adrian Keatinge-Clay and Frank Thornally plus NMs Shivaji Shivkumar, Chethan Narayan and Vivek Nambiar. This will be the first tournament for Frank Thornally of Marinwood in more than twenty years. He was one of the top Bay Area players in the 1960s and 70s and represented the United States at the World Student Team Chess Championships at Ybbs, Austria, in 1968. Welcome back Frank!\n\nThis Linklater is funded entirely by generous donations from Anthony Corrales and Michael Goodall and entry fees from the players. If you would like to make contributions to the Mechanics', which enjoys tax-deductible 501(c) (3) status, please contact Chess Room Director John Donaldson at (415) 421-2258 or [email protected].\n\n5) Foxwoods Open\n\nGMs Ilya Smirin, Alexander Goldin, Ildar Ibragimov, Gregory Kaidanov, Joel Benjamin and Giorgi Kacheishvili tied for first at 5.5 from 7 in the 4th Annual Foxwoods International held March 28-31 at the Foxwoods Resort Casino & Hotel in Connecticut. The six qualifiers for the US Championship are Maurice Ashley, Michael Mulyar, Alan Bennett, Alex Stripunsky, Larry Kaufman and Igor Foygel with Marc Esserman as first alternate. Bill Goichberg's Continental Chess Association organized the event.\n\n6) The Turk is coming to town\n\nDo you remember the Turk? No, we are not talking about Grandmaster Suat Atalik of Istanbul, but the famous chessplaying machine of the 18th century which is the subject of a recent book (THE TURK: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth Century-Chess Playing Machine) by Tom Standage. He will be talking about \"Thinking about Thinking Machines, 1769-2002\" and signing copies of THE TURK in San Francisco on the following dates:\n\n* May 28 @ 7:00 PM: The Booksmith, 1644 Haight Street\n\n* May 29 @ 12:30 PM: Stacey's Booksellers, 581 Market Street\n\nFor additional information about the book and/or Tom Standage, please visit www.theturkbook.com.\n\n7) Bobby Fischer's newest innovation\n\nThe following piece appeared at the ChessBase web site at the beginning of this month.\n\nNew Fischer movesAlthough the reclusive ex-world champion Bobby Fischer has not played much chess in the last 30 years, he has introduced a number of important innovations into the game. After the Fischer Clock and Fischer Random Chess he is now proposing a further change, the \"Fischer move\". It was presented to FIDE and will come up for a vote at the Executive Council meeting in Dubai.\n\nBobby Fischer has already introduced two important innovations that have received a larger or smaller degree of acceptance by the chess community. First came the \"Fischer clock\", which adds a small time increment after every move, thereby alleviating the brutal time trouble some players tend to get into. Then came \"Fischer Random Chess\", which scrambles the position of the pieces at the beginning of the game. This is designed to eliminate the very extensive openings preparation that is encountered in top-level chess today.\n\nNow Fischer has turned his sights on what he believes is an unbearable preponderance of tactics in chess. His declared intention is to return the game to its origins and not allow the strategic spirit to be destroyed by \"cheapo shots constantly fired by younger players.\" To this end he has submitted a rule modification, which FIDE is currently considering and will present to the delegates at its next general council meeting\n\nduring the Dubai Grand Prix.\n\nFischer's proposal adds one rule to section 4.1-4.7 (\"The act of moving the pieces\") in FIDE's \"Laws of chess\". The new article 4.8 states that: \"After a player has registered a move by his opponent he may, as part of his next move, either execute a move in the form stipulated by the rules 4.1-4.7 given above; or instead he may execute the opponent's and his own previous moves in reverse order, replacing any captured pieces onto their original squares, and then execute an alternative move, in accordance with the rules 4.1-4.7 given above.\"\n\nThe new \"Fischer move\" (which is also referred to as a \"retractor\") does not change the original flavour of the game ??“ in fact many believe it actually reflects it more completely than the rules practised in tournaments today. The new rule has been extensively tested in informal play, where the advantages of the system are immediately obvious. Games are no longer decided by simple tactical strokes, the outcome depends much more on a painstaking exploratory strategy of \"trial and error\". The only disadvantage is that games may sometimes last a little longer, especially when a number of Fischer moves are executed.\n\nThe new Fischer move rule also provides an interesting solution to the problem of chess playing computers, which are the sharpest tactical entities on the planet. Our own experiments have shown that players who were scoring zero points against the 2750-rated Fritz program were actually winning some of their games when allowed to make extensive use of retractor moves.\n\nFIDE has stressed that a decision in Dubai to adopt the Fischer move rule would not mean that it would be immediately implemented in all tournaments organised or sanctioned by the world chess organisation. \"We anticipate that it will take a number of years before the new rule is universally accepted,\" said a ranking Fide official. \"Until then both forms of chess can coexist.\"\n\nMany players are very enthusiastic about Fischer move games. \"Retractor games remove the unnecessary tension of ruining your game with stupid blunders,\" said one leading grandmaster. \"I can be much more daring in my choice of moves.\" But Judit Polgar, the world's strongest female player, disagrees. \"I have my doubts about this new rule, maybe because I am not very good at it. I lost an retractor game in an important tournament once.\"\n\nI would say this is a pretty good April Fools Joke!\n\nNewsletter #82, 04/10/2002\n\n\"Modern chess is too much concerned with things like pawn structure.

The following is a list of active local players.\n\nGM Yermolinsky 2583\n\nGM Browne 2473\n\nIM Donaldson 2430\n\nFM Mezentsev 2400\n\nIM DeGuzman 2372\n\nIM Rey 2358\n\nFM Zilberstein 2337\n\nFM Porter 2309\n\nFM Keatinge-Clay 2284\n\nFM Lobo 2282\n\nIM Shipman 2237\n\nStearns 2233\n\nNambiar 2203\n\nCasadei 2169\n\nSchiller 2166\n\nAigner 2158\n\nGallegos 2134\n\nMorkunaite 2132\n\nPeckham 2080\n\n3) Northern California State Scholastics\n\nThe Mechanics' Institute, coached by Anthony Corrales, won the Elementary and High School Championships at the Northern California State Scholastics, held this past weekend in Monterey. Top scorers in the High School, which was won by IM Vinay Bhat, were Monty Peckham and Michael Pearson with 5, Elisha Garg 41/2 and Michael O'Brien 4. Daichi Siegrist, Anand Kesavaraju (representing the MI) and David Chock tied for first in the Elementary Championship with 6-0 scores. Joining Anand on the winning team were Ben Laufer, Shawn Tse and Davis Xu, each with five points.\n\nWe expect to have a full report from Anthony next week.\n\nNewsletter #83, 04/17/2002\n\n\"I refused to believe that Black was lost. Looking at the position, I felt there must be a defense, and looking at the previous play, I liked all of Black’s moves!

Other prize winners were:\n\n2nd and Top A: Egle Morkunaite and Ben Haun\n\n1st Expert: Monty Peckham.\n\n1st B: Mariusz Krubnik, Wesley Chen and Daichi Siegrist\n\n1st C: Joe Davis\n\n2) Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nRussell Wong defeated fellow National Master Rudy Hernandez to take over sole first in the Spring Tuesday Night Marathon with a score of 4-0. Half a point behind are NM David Blohm, Expert Larry Snyder and Steven Krasnov. Sixty-one players are competing in the eight round event.\n\n3) Northern California State Scholastic\n\nMI Scholastic Chess Director Anthony Corrales reports on the recent State Scholastic Championship.\n\n\"The 2002 St Ch. in Monterey had more than 1000 participants, a surprise to everyone, including the organizers. In the K-12 Open, IM Vinay Bhat won with 6-0, flagging MI member Michael Pearson (3rd place) with 8 seconds in the final game of the tournament. Ben Haun had 2nd place with 5.5 pts and Monty Peckham had 5pts for 4th place. Elisha Garg (1309) of the MI had 4.5 pts (16th place) to help the MI team win convincingly.\n\nThe K-8 Open was won by Daniel Schwarz of Sacramento, followed closely by Nicolas Yap (MI), Ricky Yu, Ankit Gupta, and Drake Wang(MI).With only three players in this section, the MI team came in 4th place overall, only a few points behind 1st. Next year we will have 4 players...\n\nThe K-6 Open was won by the MI with 21pts (of 24). There was a three way tie for first, all familiar faces at the MI (Daichi Siegrist, Anand Kesavaraju, and David Chock). Team members Ben Laufer, Shaun Tse, and Davis Xu had 5 pts to score well within the top 20. Aly Patterson, rated 858, had a performance\n\nrating of 1080 for the tournament.\n\nThree members of our Wednseday beginner's class competed in the K-3 premier\n\nsection, all scoring 4-1 for a tie for 7-27th place. This was their first tournament, a great showing for Hugo Kitano, Kathryn Nunnally, and Niko Takayesu. Great job to all!!\"\n\nNewsletter #84, 04/24/2002\n\n\"There are two kinds of equal positions. Equal positions you like to play, and equal positions you can't stand the sight of.\"\n\nViswanathan Anand\n\n1) Lakdawala and Mezentsev win 6th Charles Linklater Memorial\n\nCyrus Lakdawala and Vladimir Mezentsev tied for first in the 6th Charles Linklater Memorial held April 4-21. The two winners, who each scored 7-3 in the Category 4 (2337 FIDE average) roundrobin, also made IM norms. For the San Diego based Lakdawala it was his third and final norm and he will receive his long overdue title at the FIDE Congress in Slovenia later this year. This was the second norm for Mezentsev who needs one more result for the title.\n\nThis was the 8th IM or GM norm event held at the club since the end of 1998. A total of 17 IM norms and 1 GM norm have been earned in MI events during this time. One might get the impression that the MI is a title mill, but the reality is quite different. Lakdawala and Mezentsev have both been rated over 2500 USCF and 2400 FIDE for many years. If they lived in Europe they would have been IMs a long time ago, but lacked the opportunities. The list of players who have made norms in MI events reads like a list of some of the best young talent in North America (G. Shahade, Bhat, Krush, Mulyar, Zugic, Kraai and so on). The only player rated below 2450 USCF to make a norm at the MI is Richard Lobo (usually around 2360) who achieved it the hard way in one event. He lost his first three and then scored 5 1/2 from 6! The point is that the MI is just about the only place in the US to try for roundrobin norms.\n\nThe credit for this event goes to Anthony Corrales. He not only organized and directed, but also found the sponsorship.\n\nOther scores: 3. De Guzman 6; 4-5. Lobo and Nambiar 5.5; 6. Rey 5; 7-8. Donaldson and Shivaji 4.5; 9-10. Shivaji and Keatinge-Clay 4; 11. Thornally 2\n\nSpecial mention should be made of FM Frank Thornally. Playing in his first serious tournament in several decades, Thornally lost his first seven games, but then showed great strength of character to rebound with two wins at the end of the event.\n\n2) Wong and Snyder share lead in Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nLarry Snyder defeated top-seed Egle Morkunaite and Russell Wong drew with fellow NM David Blohm to grab the lead after five rounds of the 61-player Spring Tuesday Night Marathon. 1-2. Snyder and NM Wong 4.5; 3-7. NM Margulis, NM Hernandez, Ossipov, NM Blohm and Jones 4.\n\n3) 5-way tie for first in Edward Levy Memorial Open\n\nThe Edward Levy Memorial, held April 19-21 in Denver, finished in a 5-way tie for first at 4-1 between GMs Gregory Kaidanov, Alex Shabalov, Alex Stripunsky, Ildar Ibragimov and Georgi Kacheishvili. The 325-player event, the largest Colorado event in recent memory, was super strong with 15 GMs competing in the 42-player top section. MI member Kayven Reise tied for first in the Under 1800 section at 4-1. Bill Goichberg organized and directed for the Continental Chess Association.\n\n4) Imre Konig Memorial this September\n\nThe MI held strong Grandmaster roundrobins events in 1987, 1991, 1995 and 1998, but nothing of this stature since then. We hope to change this state of affairs this September by organizing a special tournament to honor the 10th anniversary of the death of International Master Imre Konig.\n\nNational Masters Tibor Weinberger and Mark Pinto have made very generous donations to make this event possible. GMs Alexander Baburin (Ireland), John Fedorowicz (USA), Yury Shulman (Belarus) and Alex Wojtkiewicz (Poland) have already committed to playing along with two of America's top young talents, Varuzhan Akobian and local hero Vinay Bhat. We would like to round out the field with even more strong players, but to do this we need to do more fund raising. If you would like to make a tax deductible donation, contact us.\n\nNewsletter #85, 05/01/2002\n\n\"It's funny, but many people don't understand why I draw so many games nowadays.

GMs Alex Shabalov and Gregory Kaidanov tied for first in the Aeroflot Open in January and now Alexander Onischuk has won a major tournament. The 3rd Karpov International, a Category XVI (2628) event, was held in Poikovsky, Russia 16th-24th April 2002. Onischuk's performance in this event was around 2750 FIDE.\n\n1.

NM David Blohm was second at 3 followed by IM Walter Shipman, Larry Snyder, Ray Banning and Jim Simpson at 2.5. Simpson, rated only 1436, had a particularly good event as he played up the entire tournament.\n\n3) Baja wins in Hercules\n\nTournament organizer and director Rico Adkins writes about last weekend's Hercules Open:\n\n\"The 23 player event was won by Victor Baja, a master from San Pablo, CA, with a score of 4-0, defeating the young prodigy Alexander Setzepfandt in the last round. Second Place went to Kris Mac Lennan, from Oakland, CA with 3 1/2 points. Third place went to both Steven Gaffagan (Expert prize also!) and Maximo Fajardo with 3 points. Teodoro Porlares and Maximo Fajardo took first \"A\" , Michael Haun took first \"B\", Aaron Wilkowski took first \"C\", and Eric Tsai took the below /Unr. prize.\"\n\nRico is planning another event at the same location in early August.\n\n4) Wong leads Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nNM Russell Wong leads the Spring Tuesday Night Marathon with a score of 5.5 from 6 with two rounds to go. NMs Igor Margulis and David Blohm and Expert Victor Ossipov are tied for second at 5.\n\n5) Field for Konig Memorial\n\nThe field for the Imre Konig Memorial, scheduled to start the second week of September, is tentatively set: GMs Yury Shulman (Belarus), Alexander Baburin (Ireland), Alex Wojtkiewicz (Poland), Suat Atalik (Turkey), Alex Yermolinsky (USA), Nick deFirmian (USA), John Fedorowicz (USA), IMs Hikaru Nakamura (USA), Varuzhan Akobian (USA) and Vinay Bhat (USA). Using ratings from the April list, this field makes for a Category 12 (2525 + FIDE) event, the same level as the 1991 and 1995 Pan Pacific Internationals.\n\nNational Masters Tibor Weinberger and Mark Pinto have generously donated $8,000 for this event, but we are still short of our goal of $14,000. If you would like to help sponsor this tournament please contact MI Chess Director John Donaldson at (415) 421-2258 or [email protected]. All donations are tax deductible.\n\nOne of the tournament participants, GM Alex Baburin, is helping the fund raising effort by offering a special deal for new subcriber's to his high quality online daily chess magazine Chess Today. He will donate 40 percent of the subscription price to the Konig Memorial! Cost of a four month subscription is $17. Go to www.chesstoday.net to sign up and tell Alex the MI sent you.\n\n6) MI Chess Camp\n\nThe Mechanics' will be hosting it's third annual chess camp from August 12-16 with GM Alex Yermolinsky, IMs John Donaldson and Guillermo Rey and MI Scholastic Director Anthony Corrales as instructors.\n\n7) Manhattan Chess Club 1879-2002?\n\nThe nation's second oldest continuously operating chess club, the Manhattan, is in extreme danger of disappearing off the map. Last month the Club, which was located at The New Yorker Hotel, shut its doors. President Jeff Kossak has put the equipment in storage and is searching for a new location. As one might imagine the cost of Manhattan real estate is a big problem. The Club does not have the group of wealthy backers it once had and it will be difficult to find an acceptable location at a doable rent.\n\nThe Mechanics (founded 1854) and the Marshall in NYC (founded in 1919) have both been blessed with many generous individuals over the years who helped them to own their own buildings. The Manhattan, not enjoying this critical advantage, must have moved at least 20 times in its nomadic history. We wish the Manhattan well in its search for new quarters and remind MI Club members that it is their generosity that helps to run the programs and tournaments that we hold.\n\n8) Koltanowski Memorial - May 25-27 in San Francisco\n\nTom Dorsch and CALCHESS are bringing a special event to San Francisco this coming Memorial Day weekend. May 25-27 the Koltanowski Memorial will be held at the Golden Gateway Holiday Inn at Van Ness at Pine. The six-round event features $6,375.00 in prizes and $1 from each paid entry will be donated to the Kolty Chess For Youth Foundation.\n\nPremium rental charges by San Francisco hotels and mediocre attendance for the past few events (Firecracker and Uinverse Opens) have discouraged people from putting on big tournaments in the City. Let's change that trend! Support this event and its very reasonable entry fee of $65 and there will be more like it. Just think, you won't always have to get on a plane and fly across the country when you want to play in a big Swiss System event.\n\n9) Missing Years of the American Chess Bulletin at the MI\n\nDonations by Andy Ansel and some recent acquisitions have left the MI with almost a complete run of the American Chess Bulletin which went from 1904-1963. We are now missing only 1944, 1947 and 1956. Can you help?\n\nNewsletter #86, 05/08/2002\n\n\"Life is like a game of chess: we draw up a plan; this plan, however, is conditional on what - in chess, our opponent - in life, our fate - will choose to do.\"\n\nArtur Shopenhauer\n\n1) Wong leads Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nNM Russell Wong defeated Victor Ossipov in round seven of the Spring Tuesday Night Marathon to clinch at least a tie for first. Going into the last round Wong has 6 1/2 points, followed by NMs Igor Margulis and David Blohm plus upset king John Lai on 5 1/2.\n\n2) Cal Chess San Mateo Swiss\n\nComplete details are not yet available, but we do know that MI members Larry Snyder and Ewelina Krubnik both did very well in this event held last week at the American Legion Hall in San Mateo. Berkeley-based Snyder won the Expert-A section with a 4-0 score. 12-year-old Krubnik, who is now rated in the top 100 women in the country, was the top C at 3-1 in the B-C section. Approximately 40 players participated in this fund raiser for Cal Chess.\n\n3) Siegrists Shine at National Elementary Championships\n\nMI members Daichi and Yuki Siegrist shined at the National Elementary Championships held in Portland. Daichi, competing the in K-6 Championship, won 4 and drew 3 with no losses to finish 12th with 5.5 out of 7. Younger brother Yuki had a 4.5 from 7 in the K-3 Championship section. The well-run event attracted over 2000 kids!\n\n4) Walter Korn Exhibit\n\nThe MI has recently received some interesting chess memorabilia of the late Walter Korn, courtesy of Muriel Roth, which will soon be exhibited in the Chess Room display case. Korn, who was best known to the chess world as the longtime editor of Modern Chess Openings and as FIDE Judge of Study Composition, was a prolific writer and contributed to the English monthly Chess, Chess Review and Chess Life for over fifty years. This August will mark the fifth anniversary of his passing. In tribute we reprint the following appreciation which originally appeared in the Jewish Bulletin on August 15, 1997.\n\n\"Chess Expert, author, Walter Korn dies in Burlingame\n\nby Leslie Katz\n\nWalter Korn, a well-known chess aficionado who fled Czechoslovakia during World War II, died last month in Burlingame at age 89.\n\nA lifelong lover of chess, The San Mateo resident authored several books on the strategic game, including \"The Brilliant Touch in Chess\", \"America’s Chess Heritage\" and \"The Art of Chess Competition\".\n\nKorn, who died July 10, also wrote an 11-page essay on chess for Encyclopedia Britannica and for more than 50 years was a contributing editor to chess publications including Chess Life and the British Chess Magazine.\n\n\"He was a brilliant man, but totally loving and warm\", says John Burtman, a family friend who considers Korn his grandfather. \"he was a wonderful, kind-hearted, good person…very rare in today’s world.\"\n\nBorn in Prague in 1908, Korn fled his homeland for London with his late wife, Herta Klemperer.\n\nSeveral decades later, in Germany, he directed the U.N. Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, helping to relocate concentration camp survivors. In 1948, he served as national director of ORT in Geneva.\n\nHe later immigrated to the United States in 1950 and lived in Detroit, where he worked as a business manager of the Jewish Community Center. From 1960 to 1964, he lived in Israel, working for both the Joint Distribution Committee and the United Jewish Appeal.\n\nAfter moving to California in the mid-1970s, he spent his retirement years pursuing his passion for chess.\n\nBut those who knew Korn call him a cultured man whose interest extended far beyond his favorite game.\n\nSays his doctor George H. Cohen: \" I looked forward to his visits and the back-and-forth bantering that always seemed to ensue. Walter never left the office in an instance where I hadn’t learned something new from him.\"\n\nKorn is survived by his longtime friend Muriel Feiler Roth of San Mateo and her family, as well as a sister-in-law, Hedi Furth of Dusseldorf, Germany and niece Marcella Buldrova of Prague.\n\nNewsletter #87, 05/15/2002\n\n\"The art of treating the opening stage correctly and without error is basically the art of using time efficiently.\n\nSvetozar Gligoric\n\n1) Imre Konig Memorial\n\nThe field had been finalized for the Imre Konig Memorial, scheduled for September 4-12 later this year. The lineup of GMs Yury Shulman (2591), Alex Yermolinsky (2583), Lubomir Ftacnik (2576), Alex Baburin (2565), Alex Wojtkiewicz (2554), Suat Atalik (2551), Nick DeFirmian (2550), John Fedorowicz (2514) and IMs Varuzhan Akobian (2480) and Hikaru Nakamura (2466) averages out to Category 12 (2543 FIDE). This is higher than the 1991 Pan Pacific (2528) and just a little below the 1995 event, which, with an average rating of 2552, is the strongest ever held at the MI. FIDE will release a new rating list on July 1st, and with rapidly improving juniors Akobian and Nakamura, the Category may go up from 12 to 13. Even as a Category 12 event, the Konig will qualify as the strongest round robin held in the United States since the 2000 US Championship and the strongest international round robin in many years.\n\nRounds will be held daily from 11 am to approximately 4pm in the Mechanics' main Chess Room and spectators are most welcome. Admission is complementary. IM John Donaldson will provide commentary during some of the rounds. Future Newsletters will detail the exact schedule.\n\nDonations are what make events like this possible. Fund raising to date, through the generosity of National Masters Tibor Weinberger, Mark Pinto and Jim Eade, has generated 60 percent of the tournament budget. Can you help to make up the difference? The M.I. has 501 (c) (3) status, so donations are tax deductible.\n\n2) Bay Area Masters Grand Prix II\n\nUC Berkeley student David Pruess regained his Senior Master rating and won $500 by scoring 4 from 5 to win the Bay Area Masters Grand Prix this past weekend. Pruess, who took a second round bye, was only nicked for a draw by veteran Washington master Viktors Pupols. IM Ricardo De Guzman was second at 3.5, followed by tournament organzer IM Guillermo Rey and NM Egle Morkunaite at 3. The next Bay Area Masters is scheduled for June 14-16.\n\n3) Margulis, Wong and Blohm win Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nVeterans Igor Margulis and David Blohm used their experience to good effect to win tough games in the last round of the Spring Tuesday Night Marathon. The two NMs scored 6.5 from 8 to join with Russell Wong in taking the top honors just ahead of Egle Morkunaite, Victor Ossipov and Victor Todortsev on 6. The next Marathon will start on June 4.\n\n4) Cal Chess Swiss Winners\n\nTournament organizer and Cal Chess editor Frisco Del Rosario has kindly supplied the names of winners of the Cal Chess Swiss held 4-5 in San Mateo.\n\n1 Expert Larry Snyder 4\n\n2 X Jerry Sze 3\n\n1 A Ray Banning 2.5\n\n2 A Bruce Matzner 1.5\n\n1 B Chien Liu 3\n\n2 B Alberto Cisneros 3\n\n1 C Ewelina Krubnik 3\n\n2 C Oren Gazit 3\n\n1 D Stephan Goupille 3.5\n\n2 D Richard Van Gaabeck 3\n\n1 E Yuki Siegrist 2.5\n\n2 E Iris Kokish 2\n\n1 U1000 Herbert Kanner 2.5\n\n2 U1000 Emilia Krubnik 2.5\n\n5) 2nd Charles Powell Memorial this weekend\n\nThe MI will be hosting a special G/45 event this Saturday to honor the memory of one of its top players who died much too young. Nationally, Senior Master Charles Powell was best known for winning the Armed Forces Championship several times and being a key member of the Washington Plumbers, winners of the 1976 National Telephone League. A perennial state champion in his native Virginia, he moved to San Francisco in the late 1970s and played in several Northern California State Championships (Bagby Memorials), but will be best remembered for his friendly manner and good sportsmanship. Please come out for this event.\n\n6) Here and There\n\nThe Bay Area has a new GM in the area, at least temporarily. Former World Junior Champion Tal Shaked is interning with Intel this summer in Santa Clara, before moving to Seattle this fall where he will pursue a Ph. D.at the University of Washington.\n\nNM Robert Haines, who moved back to Albuquerque from Richmond earlier this year, recently won the New Mexico Senior Championship.\n\nNM Bob Burger of Arcata writes regarding Newsletter #86: \"The games you quote from MI championship, 1930, are interesting: Lamb is Willis Lamb, then a student at Cal and member of the Castle CC. He went on to get a Ph.D. in physics and made key discoveries (at Yale, I believe) that led to the invention of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\"\n\nIM Vinay Bhat, several-time winner of the Falconer award for the top junior player in Northern California, will be attending UC Berkeley this fall. He joins a long list of strong players who have gone to Cal including GM Nick deFirmian, IM Vince McCambridge, IM Greg Hjorth, SMs David Pruess, David Glueck and Dmitry Zilberstein, to mention but a few.\n\nNM Eric Schiller of El Granada has been quite busy of late with various writing and software projects. One of his students, Robert Lau of Hawaii, finished clear second in the recent national scholastic K-5 division. Eric has once again be named Chief Arbiter fort the rescheduled Kramnik-Fritz match.\n\nMI Chess Room stalwart Lloyd Stephenson showed he is a man of many talents this past weekend by not only helping organize (until the very last minute) the Zippy 5K run in Golden Gate Park, but also placing 19th in a field of 250 with a time of 15:46 which works out to a average of 5:05 a mile! Lloyd was the fifth ranked master runner in the country in 1996. Chess Room Director John Donaldson showed it is not only his chess that needs work as he placed 165th with a time of 21:08 (6:49).\n\nNewsletter #88, 05/19/2002\n\n\"Your only task in the opening is to reach a playable middlegame\".\n\nLajos Portisch\n\n1) Baja and Luaces share first in 2nd Charles Powell Memorial\n\nNational Master Victor Baja and Expert Juan Luaces shared first place in the 2nd Charles Powell Memorial held May 18 at the Mechanics' Institute.

Oren Gazit, Aaron Wilkowski and Davis Xu shared top Under 1600 with three points apiece. Anthony Corrales directed the 33-player event.\n\n2) Varuzhan Akobian wins 2002 Samford Chess Fellowship\n\nThe sixteenth annual Frank P. Samford, Jr. Chess Fellowship has been won by Varuzhan Akobian of Glendale, California. The Samford is the richest and most important chess fellowship in the United States, offering brilliant young American chessmasters the support necessary to reach their full potential. The total value of the Fellowship is $32,000 per year. The prize is awarded for one year, renewable for a second year.\n\nAkobian, the top-rated American player under 21 at 2480 FIDE, will be playing in the MI's Konig Memorial this fall. UC Berkeley student David Pruess was among the finalists for this year's Samford.\n\n3) Chess Director Donaldson to coach Nakamura and Tsai at Pan Ams\n\nMI Chess Director John Donaldson will be coaching American representatives Hikaru Nakamura and Cindy Tsai in the Pan American Junior Championships this June in La Paz, Bolivia. Donaldson will be spending next Tuesday and Wednesday at the world's largest chess library (the J.G. White collection) in Cleveland researching the club's history. This accounts for the early arrival of Newsletter #89.\n\n4) New Additions to MI Library Chess Collections\n\nThe Mechanics' Institute Library is constantly adding both new and older chess materials to its collections. Recent acquisitions include Chess Informants and MI Trustee Vince McCambridge's book on Yasser Seirawan.\n\nNewsletter #89, 05/29/2002\n\n\"To study opening variations without reference to the strategic concepts that develop from them in the middlegame, is, in effect, to separate the head from the body\".\n\nPetrosian\n\n1) Yermo ties for first in Chicago Open\n\nMI GM-in-Residence Alex Yermolinsky finished in a 7-way tie for first in the Chicago Open held May 24-27 at the Hyatt Regency Oak Brook. Joining Yermo in the winner's circle in the 805-player event, which featured 19 GMs and 13 IMs, were GMs Gregory Kaidanov, Jaan Ehlvest, Alexander Shabalov, Leonid Yudasin, Ildar Ibragimov and Giorgi Kacheishvili, who all scored 5.5 from 7. Alex defeated Alexander Goldin (second rated in the US at 2702 USCF) with Black in the final round to gain his second big victory of 2002 (he and Walter Browne tied for first in the National Open). Good job Alex!\n\nSeveral other MI members made the trip east. David Pruess and Shivkumar Shivaji had 3 1/2 from 7 in the open section while Chethan Narayan had 2 1/2. Gennadi Reznikov had 4 in the under 2200, with Steven Gaffagan at 3 1/2 and James Jones on 2 (from 6).

Former Bay Area Players IM Mladen Vucic and Renard Anderson tied for 2nd-5th qualifier at 4 1/2 points, but lost out on the tiebreak. Elina Groberman was the qualifying woman.\n\nThe attendance for the Chicago, organized by Bill Goichberg's Continental Chess Association, was down slightly from last year, but excellent considering that very few players flew to the event.\n\n2) Field for Imre Konig expanded\n\nCurrent US Champion Larry Christiansen(2573) and six-time titleholder Walter Browne (2473) have been added to the field for the Imre Konig Memorial.
