        "text": "Shirley Fry Irvin was an Akron tennis legend. As the world’s top-ranked female player in the mid-1950s, her name used to be a household word.\n\nA 1970 inductee of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, she was one of only 10 female players to capture singles titles at all four Grand Slam tournaments: Wimbledon and national championships in the United States, France and Australia. She was one of only six players to also win doubles titles at each of the major tournaments.\n\nNot bad for a player who barely took lessons.\n\nShe died at age 94 on July 16 in hospice care in Naples, Florida, one week after the 65th anniversary of her victory at Wimbledon.\n\nMore: Akron native and Tennis Hall of Famer Shirley Fry Irvin dies at 94\n\nBorn June 30, 1927, in Akron, Shirley was the youngest child of Lester and Ida Fry, and grew up with her siblings Byron, Robert and Evelyn in a home at 794 E. Exchange St. With a father who ran track and a mother who played tennis, the kids were natural athletes.\n\nShirley enjoyed swimming, badminton, running, baseball, archery and skating. She picked up a tennis racket at age 8 as a pupil at Mason Elementary School and played her first games at the University Club, honing her skills with little formal training.\n\nFleet on her feet, she had an innate ability to anticipate the trajectory of the ball. She won her first title in 1936 at Mill Creek Park in Youngstown, teaming with her sister, Evelyn, in doubles.\n\n“They called me ‘Small Fry’ because I was so small I could hardly see over the net,” she recalled years later.\n\nFry won so many tournaments, including the Akron Women’s Tennis Championship as a 12-year-old in 1939 and again in 1940, that her father started a scrapbook to hold all the newspaper clippings. On it, he wrote: “Objective: Wimbledon by ’45.”\n\nIf it hadn’t been for World War II and the suspension of play at Wimbledon until 1946, she might have met that deadline.\n\nThe 5-foot-5 right-hander began touring the amateur circuit in 1941 and reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. National Championship a year later at age 15. In 1944 and 1945, she won the U.S. girls singles title.\n\nFry graduated from Akron Central High School in 1945 and earned a degree in human relations from Rollins College in Winterpark, Florida.\n\nShe made it to Wimbledon in 1948, three years past her dad’s prediction, but sprained her ankle in a London match with Louise Brough and had to withdraw.\n\nShe won her first major title in 1951 on the clay at the French national championships, defeating top-ranked Doris Hart in straight sets. The two became tennis partners and won 11 Grand Slam doubles titles.\n\nEvery tournament, she played singles, doubles and mixed doubles. She was ranked in the world’s Top 10 nine times from 1946 to 1956.\n\nRising at Wimbledon\n\nFry became a study in perseverance at Wimbledon.\n\nIn 1949, she lost in the third round to Betty Hilton. In 1950, she lost in the semifinals to Brough. In 1951, she lost in the final to Hart. In 1952 and 1953, she lost in the semifinals to Maureen “Little Mo” Connolly. In 1954, she lost in the quarterfinals to Betty Pratt.\n\nHampered by a nagging injury to her elbow, she skipped 1955 and abruptly retired from tennis. She took a job as a copy girl at the St. Petersburg Times in Florida.\n\n“I am getting a little weary of the game now and it’s time to start thinking about something else,” she told a Beacon Journal reporter Sept. 2, 1955.\n\n“I’ll do it by degrees. I’ll play a few selected tournaments until I decide to call it quits. I’ve got a lot out of the game and I’ve had a good time.”\n\nShe rested her elbow for three months and returned to play in 1956.\n\n“I’m not kidding myself that after all these years I can win at Wimbledon,” she said in April. “But I’m certainly going to try.”\n\nOn the grass courts at the All England Club in July, she defeated future Hall of Famers Althea Gibson and Louise Brough to advance to the championship. Before a capacity crowd of 15,000, she breezed past Angela Buxton 6-3, 6-1 in 50 minutes to capture the title.\n\nAfter enjoying a tickertape parade in St. Petersburg, the conquering hero returned to Ohio.\n\nKey to the city\n\nAkron Mayor Leo Berg proclaimed Aug. 8, 1956, as Shirley Fry Day. He presented the tennis star with the key to the city. More than 300 people attended a University Club luncheon in her honor.\n\nAsked how she felt after winning Wimbledon, Fry told the audience: “Actually, I had no feeling at all immediately afterward. I was numb then. A short time later, I began worrying about the speech I would have to make that night &mldr;\n\n“But after an hour or so, as the numbness wore away, I began to have a feeling that after finally winning at Wimbledon, there wasn’t anything I could do wrong &mldr; that I could do almost anything.”\n\nTo cap off the year, Fry defeated Gibson on Sept. 9 at the U.S. national championships, forerunner to the U.S. Open, and was ranked the No. 1 women’s player in 1956.\n\nIn December, Fry revealed her engagement in Australia to U.S. businessman Karl E. Irvin Jr., an Illinois native who worked in Sydney as an advertising executive for a New York company. He had been an Air Force captain in World War II and worked on the side as a tennis umpire.\n\nThey had met a decade earlier at a match in Chicago, but got reacquainted in November 1956 during the New South Wales championships where she was playing and he was umpiring.\n\nAfter they began dating, “it was hard to concentrate just on tennis,” she said.\n\nHousewife and mother\n\nFry won her final major on Jan. 27, 1957, defeating Gibson in Australia. A couple of weeks later, she and Irvin wed in Sydney, and she retired from tennis to become a housewife and mother.\n\nThe Irvins welcomed four children — Mark, Scott, Lori and Karen — and lived in West Hartford, Connecticut, for 35 years.\n\nThe family made frequent visits to Akron. Her parents operated Fry’s Tennis Shop from their East Exchange home until the mid-1970s.\n\nDuring a 1962 trip, Shirley Fry Irvin said she didn’t mind being out of the limelight and didn’t miss living out of a suitcase. She had competed for 21 years on the amateur level and thought that was plenty.\n\n“Once in a while I miss it when the family problems pile up around my ears,” she said. “But the feeling doesn’t last long.”\n\nShe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1970, a dozen years after being inducted into the Summit County Sports Hall of Fame. Sports historians have regarded her as the greatest female athlete in Akron’s history.\n\nIn a 1973 interview, Irvin acknowledged the passage of time. She was 45 years old and had endured multiple operations for tennis elbow. She was also developing arthritis in her knees.\n\n“I tried to play last summer in the National Seniors and made it to the semifinals, but I was exhausted after three days of playing,” she said. “I’m not used to it.”\n\nShe said she still enjoyed playing so, but it was “very disheartening to play badly.”\n\n“I’m afraid I’m getting old,” she said.\n\nGolden years in Florida\n\nWidowed in 1976, Irvin eventually moved to Florida, spending her time coaching tennis and playing golf. She returned to Akron in 2011 to receive the Summit Award, presented by the Summit County Historical Society to Akronites who have earned national distinction.\n\nAmong other honors, the tennis courts behind Akron’s Mason Community Learning Center are named for her.\n\nShirley Fry Irvin was 94 when she died in hospice care in Naples, Florida, on July 16, one week after the 65th anniversary of her victory at Wimbledon. She is survived by her four children, 12 grandchildren and several nieces and nephews.\n\nOver the decades, Irvin downplayed her victory at Wimbledon, saying she was fortunate during the 1956 tournament and “just stuck around long enough to win.”\n\nShe had to admit, though, that winning the darned thing was much better than the alternative.\n\n“You know, memories are great and having had that wonderful experience, it’s worse to think that maybe you never would’ve,” she told the Hartford Courant in 1975.\n\nMark J.
