        "text": "Prior to a short review I would like to relate a story about Spinoza and the IM who, like his teacher, IM Boris Kogan, should have been a GM, Stuart Rachels.\n\nLong story short, former US Chess Champion IM Rachels became a Philosophy professor, like his father, James. There was a time when playing in a Chess tournament in the Great State of Alabama, where the Rachels resided, that James and I began talking about Philosophy between rounds. As we talked other players began listening, with many bringing folding chairs to gather around and listening. There were at one time or another maybe a couple of dozen people and not one of them said anything, which was amazing.\n\n“How did you become interested in Philosophy?” asked James. The question was answered by informing him the reason I began playing Chess was a college Professor, Dr. James Doig who had been a Jesuit priest, but had left the order to be married. The last time I saw the man he handed me a book, The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers, by Will Durant, saying, “If you read this book you will know more about philosophy than 99 44/100% of the people on the planet.” What can I say, other than, like he knew it would, my appetite had been whetted for MORE, and I’ve been reading philosophical books all my life.\n\nWhen Stuart was at Emory University I once asked him at a Chess tournament, “What do you think of Spinoza?” Obviously flummoxed, Stuart replied, “We haven’t gotten to him yet.”\n\nHere are a few of the previously books recalled concerning Spinoza:\n\nA Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza’s Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age; Spinoza: A Life, and Think Least of Death: Spinoza on How to Live and How to Die, all by Steven Nadler.\n\nThen there was the following book, which I recall being very good and interesting:\n\nLooking for Spinoza : joy, sorrow, and the feeling brain by Antonio R. Damasio.\n\nSPINOZISM\n\n“The term Spinozism has almost invariably been used, by both defenders and detractors, to refer to doctrines held or allegedly held by Benedict de Spinoza. Unlike “Platonism,” for example, it has not generally been used to refer to a developing doctrine arising out of Spinoza’s philosophy. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the term was frequently used to disparage various types of atheistic doctrines that were held to be attributable to Spinoza. For almost a century after his death, his work was neglected by philosophers, execrated by orthodox theologians of diverse denominations, and slighted even by freethinkers. It is not always possible, however, to distinguish between those genuinely opposed to Spinoza’s alleged atheism and those who really espoused atheism while pretending to disparage it.” (https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/spinozism)\n\nChapter 9 Mob Rage\n\n“Spinoza was in the finishing stages of his Theological-Political Treatise in the fall of 1669, when he moved from the relative seclusion of Voorburg to the hurly-burly of The Hague. The first year there he lived in the house of a lawyer’s widow named Van der Werve, in the same second-floor rooms whee his biographer Johannes Colerus would settle twenty years later. But the rent was steep, so Spinoza moved to a house around the corner, on the Paviljoensgracht, owned by the master painter Hendrick van der Spyck. Spinoza was, by all accounts, an easygoing, accommodating lodger who would often go days without emerging from his room. He had an ivory chess set, a game that was considered rather upper class at the time (most people preferred cards), and he amused himself by watching spiders fight in a little box; this made him laugh.” Pg 123\n\nThroughout history many people have been killed because of their belief, if it were deemed to differ from the belief of the majority. That is the main reason most people prefer to ‘go along to get along.’ After reading what follows you will understand why…\n\n“Cornelis got himself involved in a murky affair that was never entirely cleared up. He was visited in his home by a barber with an unsavory reputation, who supposedly offered to kill the stadtholder for the right price. There is no evidence that Cornelis agreed to this proposal, but when the story came out, he lied and said that he had never even met the man. This was reason enough for the Orangists to have him arrested as a traitor. He was flung in jail in The Hague, where he was tortured for three and a half hours while crowds milled outside the prison gate. Cornelis was hung upside down, his shoulders were dislocated, his ankles broken, his forehead squeezed in a vise, and he was soundly whipped. But he confessed to nothing. Still, a court sentenced him to banishment from Holland for life.\n\nA sign appeared beside the door of the New Church, where Spinoza would later be buried. It read: “Beelzebub writes from hell that Kees [short for Cornelis] de Witt is coming/he is expected there soon/but not before his head comes off.” Preachers were no less vicious in their sermons, which called for the devil to be driven out to restore God-fearing virtue to the land. The usual rabble of armed militias and violent townsmen threatened to drag Cornelis out of his cell when a rumor started that he was about to flee. In fact, he was in his bed reading a play by Moliere, while Johan was reading the Bible by his side. The crowd, incited by a silversmith named Verhoeff, was banging on the prison gate, screaming, “Up with Orange, down with De Witt!” Possibly ordered to do so by officers n the prince’s side, official armed forces withdrew from the scene, leaving the center of The Hague in the hands of the mob. Prince William refused to go in person to calm the crowd down.\n\nFinally, the prison doors were forced open, and the brothers were dragged out to face a pack of screaming people pointing rifles, swords, knives, and halberds at them. Johan was shot in the back, and Cornelis was beaten to death by a butcher and a fishmonger. This was only the beginning. The two corpses were suspended upside down from the gallows. Fingers were hacked off, tongues ripped out, and the innards were exposed by butchers. Verhoeff, the silversmith, carried the brothers’ hearts in triumph through the streets. One man tried to bite off Cornelis’s testicles. Women danced in a frenzy after wrapping themselves in the slippery intestines. Nipples, fingers, ears, and noses were grabbed as souvenirs. More and more people came to gawk at the grisly scenes.\n\nSpinoza, whose rooms were only a short walk away from the lynch party, was beside himself when he heard what was happening. Lucas relates that Spinoza wept at the idea of “his felloe-citizens tearing the man who was a father to them all to pieces. Even though he knew better than anyone what men are capable of, he still shuddered at this terrible an cruel spectacle.” Spinoza later told people that his landlord, Hendrick van der Spyck, had to physically restrain him from going out that night to place a placard at the site of the crimes that read “ultimi barbarorum,” meaning “the lowest of the barbarians.” A good thing too, for even though most common people, led by their passions, wouldn’t have been able to read those words in Latin, enough would, and Spinoza would not have come back alive.\n\nThis was clearly not the right time to publish his Ethics.”\n\nClearly! Fortunately for humanity they were published later. There is so much more that could be written about this remarkable book, but this will suffice for a review.\n\nAfter reading the above you can understand why there were two rules at the Atlanta Chess and What Game Center, aka, the House of Pain. If anyone wanted to discuss religion or politics they were politely asked to “Take it outside.” The rules were enforced after one strident wrong winger became upset enough to ball up his fist and slam it onto the plexiglass display case, shattering the glass. That particular cretin was, fortunately, never again seen at the House of Pain.\n\nAfter publishing the two posts concerning IM Stuart Rachels I wanted to notify someone next door in the Great State of Alabama so I went to the Alabama Chess Federation website (https://alabamachess.org/) where a picture of NM Bill Melvin,\n\nthe Secretary of the ACF, was found. Although I never knew Bill other than the time we sat across from each other over the board the decision was made to reach out with an email:\n\n“In the event you do not remember me I was fortunate enough to defeat you at the Lincoln Memorial U Open decades ago. I can tell you now that immediately prior to the game, after learning we were paired, Tim Brookshear said, “Bacon, you’re paired with the Oleg Romanishin of Southern Chess!” You lived up to the rep when sacking a pawn in the opening. I believe the opening was 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 c6 3 dxc6, etc. In lieu of playing in my customary “fire on the board” style I played my pawns close to my chest, or maybe it would be better to have written “Vest”, while hanging onto the pawn like it was a Titanic life raft!”\n\nPart of the reply:\n\nMike,\n\nI understand procrastinating over reading chess books. I have a shelf full of unread ones. It took me only a year to get around to reading Stuart’s book.\n\nI’m more interested in your stories about Boris than about Stuart’s short career. Boris played a lot in area tournaments and was always a bit of a mystery. Most of the anecdotes I heard came from the late Brian McCarthy (I played him a couple years ago at Castle Chess shortly before his passing).\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBill\n\nMy first thought was, “A year?!” From the moment the book arrived it was opened and not put down until finished. The first post of the quasi review of Stuart’s book was ready to go but Bill’s words had resonated and it became apparent a preface of sorts was needed because IM Boris Kogan\n\nwas The Trainer. On page ten of the book it is written:\n\n“Two players were vital for my development: Kyle Therrell (then called Dana), my best friend and local rival; and my trainer from the age of 12, IM Boris Kogan. From Kyle I learned all of my openings, one pairing at a time. Here was our drill: When the pairings were posted before a round, we’d hurry over to a quiet spot. ‘What does so-and-so play?’ I’d ask. My next question was, ‘What do I do against that?’ And finally I’d ask: ‘How is that supposed to be for White//Black?’ Without Kyle, I would have been lost – especially because Boris Kogan had no interest in opening theory. From Boris, I learned the finer points of position evaluation. Kogan played like Petrosian. ‘You must play seemple (itl) chess,’ he always told me. ‘Kviet(itl) moves.’ Thanks to Boris, I eventually became a weak strong player. Without him, I would only have become a dangerous patzer.”\n\nThe last two words stopped me in my tracks, causing me to recall a time when walking to the pairing board for the about to begin round and hearing someone say, “What do you mean? The guy is rated over two hundred points below you.” Then Dana Therrell replied, “Yeah, but the guy is dangerous because one round he can beat a master and then lose to a class C player the next round.” After seeing me they both left in a hurry. It was then I learned Dana would be my opponent. The game ended in a long, hard fought draw.\n\nWho was Boris Kogan?\n\n“International Master Boris Kogan, who died of colon cancer on Christmas Day in 1993, is best remembered for playing in three U.S. Championships and winning the Georgia state championship seven years in a row (1980-1986). He was also the coach of Stuart Rachels, helping him advance from being a young national master to sharing the U.S. Chess Championship. What isn’t so well known is that Kogan was a very promising player (Soviet Junior Champion in 1956 and 1957), before making the transition from player to coach at a very early age.”\n\nMechanics’ Institute Chess Club #696\n\nJanuary 23, 2015\n\nhttps://www.milibrary.org/chess-newsletters/696\n\nThe best way to illustrate how strong a player was IM Boris Kogan is this result:\n\nNew York open New York 1984\n\nApr, 1984 67 (players) 2427 (avg ELO) 276 (games) 9 (rounds)\n\nGM Dzindzichashvili, Roman 2485 7.0\n\nGM Portisch, Lajos 2625 6.5\n\nGM Adorjan, Andras 2570 6.5\n\nGM Sosonko, Gennadi 2560 6.5\n\nGM Kavalek, Lubomir 2545 6.5\n\nKogan, Boris 2450 6.5\n\nGM Browne, Walter S 2585 6.0\n\nGM Gurevich, Dmitry 2545 6.0\n\nGM Kudrin, Sergey 2520 6.0\n\nGM Gheorghiu, Florin 2495 6.0\n\nGM Hjartarson, Johann 2415 6.0\n\nGM Ljubojevic, Ljubomir 2635 5.5\n\nGM Fedorowicz, John P 2475 5.5\n\nGM Lein, Anatoly 2475 5.5\n\nGM Benko, Pal C 2450 5.5\n\nFrias Pablaza, Victor J 2425 5.5\n\nIM Haik, Aldo 2405 5.5\n\nGM Alburt, Lev O 2515 5.0\n\nGM De Firmian, Nick E 2515 5.0\n\nIM McCambridge, Vincent 2465 5.0\n\nhttps://www.365chess.com/tournaments/New_York_op_1984/22775\n\nOne of the opponents Boris faced in this tournament was Canadian Grandmaster Kevin Spraggett:\n\nKevin Spraggett (2540) vs Boris Kogan (2450)\n\nEvent: New York op\n\nSite: New York Date: ??/??/1984\n\nRound: 5\n\nECO: A20 English opening\n\n1.c4 e5 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.Nc3 Ne7 5.e4 Nbc6 6.Nge2 d6 7.d3 O-O 8.O-O f5 9.exf5 Nxf5 10.Rb1 Nfd4 11.Nxd4 Nxd4 12.b4 a6 13.Be3 Rb8 14.a4 Be6 15.h3 h6 16.Kh2 g5 17.b5 a5 18.b6 c6 19.Ne4 Qd7 20.Bc1 Rf7 21.Ba3 Bf8 22.Qh5 Bf5 23.f4 exf4 24.gxf4 d5 25.Bxf8 Rbxf8 26.cxd5 cxd5 27.Nc3 Bxd3 28.Qxh6 Bxb1 29.Rxb1 Nf5 30.Qxg5+ Kh8 31.Nxd5 Qxa4 32.Rc1 Qd4 33.Rc7 a4 34.Qh5+ Kg8 35.Qg6+ Rg7 36.Qe6+ Kh7 37.Qe2 a3 38.Qh5+ Kg8 39.Rxg7+ Qxg7 40.Qe2 Qb2 41.Qg4+ Kh7 42.Qh5+ Nh6 43.Ne7 Rf6 44.Nd5 Rg6 0-1\n\nhttps://www.365chess.com/game.php?gid=2378704\n\nWho is Kevin Spraggett?\n\nFull name Kevin Spraggett\n\nCountry Canada\n\nBorn 10 November 1954\n\nMontreal, Canada\n\nTitle GM\n\nKevin Spraggett (born 10 November 1954) is a Canadian chess grandmaster. He is the fourth Canadian to earn the grandmaster title, after Abe Yanofsky, Duncan Suttles and Peter Biyiasas. Spraggett is the only Canadian to have qualified for the Candidates’ level, having done so in 1985 and 1988. He has won a total of eight Canadian Open Chess Championships, seven Closed Canadian Chess Championships, and has represented Canada eight times in Olympiad play. Spraggett has also written for Canadian chess publications.\n\nhttps://gambiter.com/chess/players/Kevin_spraggett.html\n\nThese days Kevin is probably better known for his excellent blog, http://www.spraggettonchess.com/, though it has been quite some time since Kevin has posted. GM Spraggett wrote that he, and other GMs, considered Boris a fellow Grandmaster without the title.

If your peers consider you to be a Grandmaster who cares what some antiquated organization says or does?\n\nI thought of Boris when reading an excellent article in the 2020 #1 issue of New In Chess entitled, Kamran Shirazi ‘I Never Stopped Loving This Game’: A legendary player still chasing the Grandmaster title, by Dylan Loeb McClain. In the article Shirazi said, ‘I put my whole spirit into this and not to be a grandmaster is a little bit too much.’\n\nIn order to earn the Grandmaster title a player must jump through many hoops. FIDE, the world governing body of Chess, has instituted many picayune rules and In order to earn the Grandmaster title a player must jump through many hoops.\n\nCruel twist of fate\n\nFrustrated with the relatively few tournaments that offered grandmaster norms, Shirazi moved to France, in 1994. Though he was already in his 40s, he experienced a rebirth and his results in tournaments with grandmaster norms improved.\n\nIn a 1998 tournament in Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, a seaside town in Northern France, he gained his first norm. Four years later, in Cannes, he earned his second. And then, another four years later, in 2006, in Metz, he earned his third and final norm needed for the title. That should have been enough, but for a cruel twist of fate. During the Cannes tournament, in the penultimate round, he reached his peak rating: 2499, only a point shy of what he needed for the title. According to the rules, achieving a rating of 2500 once in a lifetime is sufficient, even if the required norms are gained later. If Shirazi had won or drawn his final game, his rating would have been over 2500. But he did not know how close he was – it was still a time before rating updates were done after each round. So, in the final round, Shirazi overpressed in a good position and lost. He ended the tournament with a rating of 2486. ‘I missed by one point’, he said, with a hint of incredulity.\n\nI mention this because of something seen in the last round of a Chess tournament in New Orleans, the Plaza in Lake Forest tournament, if memory serves. The two top rated players were Kamran Shirazi and Boris Kogan, and it came down to a battle with only seconds on the clock. The two combatants were moving with such speed it was difficult to follow the moves. Boris had a time advantage and the players were moving at blitz speed when, all of a sudden, Shirazi STOPPED THE CLOCK! Boris took that as a resignation, but Shirazi said he stopped the clock because it was obvious they were only moving the same pieces around and the tournament director should have stepped in and declared the game a draw by repetition. Boris scoffed, but honesty compels me to agree that Shirazi had a point. The problem was that the TD was unqualified and had absolutely no clue what to do. There had been a group of at least a couple of dozen players watching who had been electrified by what they had just witnessed. Although Boris could speak English, it was somewhat mangled, and I became his spokesman. Shirazi also had his spokesman and there was a shouting match between the two of us. Keep in mind this was a time when the Iranians had defied convention and taken United States citizens working at the embassy hostage. My counterpart invited me to “step outside.” The answer was fired immediately. “Let’s go, dude. I’ve got at least a couple of dozen red-blooded Americans right here, right now, ready to step outside with a couple of IRANIANS!!!” Kamran and his buddy beat a hasty retreat to the hotel… The tournament director later paid out the prize money as if the game had been drawn, and the USCF backed him up. Boris never got over it, lamenting, “He stopped the clock…”\n\nIf one did not know how FIDE has operated over the decades it would be difficult to understand why neither player became a Grandmaster. Certainly both players were of Grandmaster caliber and both should have been awarded the title because the title has been awarded to much lesser players. Because of things like this the title has lost its luster.\n\nFrom prodigy to champion, Stuart Rachels was the best Alabama saw in chess\n\nby: Tanner Brooks\n\nPosted: Sep 17, 2021 / 10:56 AM CDT\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WIAT) — There was a time when Stuart Rachels seemed to have a bright future in chess. Rachels, a philosophy professor at the University of Alabama, was a chess prodigy who had become the youngest U.S. chess master in history by the time he was 11-years-old. By 1990, he was co-champion of the U.S. Chess Championship and had already played some of the best players in the world. That all changed in 1993, when Rachels decided to walk away from chess.\n\n‘Kids didn’t play chess’\n\nRachels recalled one of his earliest chess memories in 1977, when he was 7 years old. “I remember trying to capture the queen of one of my father’s graduate students — his name was Greg — by moving a pawn backwards,” Rachels said in an email correspondence with CBS 42. “I was pretty irritated when he made me give him his queen back.” By the time he was 9, Rachels was constantly playing at the Birmingham Chess Club and rapidly improving. “I never played kids when I was a kid, I only played adults,” Rachels said. “Kids didn’t play chess.”\n\nRachels’ family did everything they could to support him. His father, UAB philosophy professor James Rachels, organized chess tournaments in Birmingham and gave him the means to improve his game, including books, magazines and, later, a trainer.However, Rachels said they never put any pressure on him to play. “A good player will put pressure on himself; extra pressure will only give him stomach aches,” he said. “A kid who isn’t self-motivated doesn’t have what it takes, and parents who try to provide motivation from the outside are only being bad parents.”\n\nIn 1981, Rachels became the youngest chess master in American history, beating the record previously held by chess icon Bobby Fischer. Rachels was 11 years and 10 months when he broke Fischer’s record. He remained the youngest U.S. chess master until 1994, when it was broken by Jordy Mont-Reynaud.\n\nRachels credits Kyle Therrell, a player from Fairfield, and trainer Boris Kogan with his early success. “Without them, forget it, I never would have become good,” Rachels said. “It’s not something you can do on your own, with just books and magazines.”\n\nEarly on, Rachels had the opportunity to play against both former and future world chess champions. He lost twice against Garry Kasparov, often referred to as the greatest chess player in history, and he lost to Boris Spassky, Fischer’s opponent in what is considered the “Match of the Century,” the 1972 World Chess Championship. Rachels also drew against future five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand. Rachels described each experience with one word. “Kasparov: Exciting. Spassky: Terrifying. Anand: Exhilarating,” he said.\n\nRachels faced Spassky in the 1985 U.S. Open in Hollywood, Florida. In his book, “The Best I Saw in Chess,” Rachels recalled Spassky walking over to Kogan to ask why he was so nervous. By the time Rachels collected himself, it was too late: Spassky had out-maneuvered him. When Rachels resigned, the spectators applauded. “I joined in, remembering Spassky’s sportsmanlike applause for Fischer when Fischer took the lead against him in Iceland,” Rachels wrote in his book.\n\nRachels went on to become U.S. co-champion in the 1989 tournament, sharing the title with grandmasters Roman Dzindzichashvili and Yasser Seirawan.\n\nIn 1993, Rachels retired from competitive chess, calling it a “whole-life decision.”\n\n“I wasn’t good enough to compete for the world championship,” he said. “In 1993, the life of your average chess professional in the United States was pretty depressing: very little money, a lot of traveling, an all-male culture, no health insurance, no respect from the general public, etc. A lot of professional players moved to Europe, which I didn’t want to do.”\n\nRachels said his life didn’t change that much after he retired, gradually weaning himself from the game to focus more on his graduate studies of philosophy. “The main change was not traveling to tournaments in the summer,” he said. “Also, I could stop worrying about how to fix problems in my opening repertoire.”\n\nIn his father’s footsteps\n\nEven before stepping away from chess, Rachels took a keen interest in philosophy, something of a family business in the Rachels’ household. His father, James, was a moral philosopher and professor at UAB. His 1971 anthology, “Moral Problems,” shifted colleges from teaching meta-ethics to teaching concrete practical issues. “When people know my father as a philosopher, I say, ‘He was an even better father,’” Rachels said.\n\nRachels remembers spending a good chunk of his teenage years pestering his father with philosophical questions after he would come home from work. “He was my Boris Kogan in the realm of philosophy. I knew, even back then, how lucky I was, but I know this even better now,” said Rachels.\n\nIn addition to his father, Rachels credits people like Donald Rutherford and Robert McCauley from Emory University and Derek Parfit from Oxford University as some influences.\n\nThere was one year of graduate school that Rachels was so consumed by philosophy that he let his subscription to his favorite chess magazine lapse. But that was only for a year. Rachels said that he was consumed by chess and by philosophy, but was primarily a student first and a chess player in his spare time. “Even people who have always known me are surprised when I remind them that I never took any time off from school in order to play chess,” Rachels said.\n\nRachels now teaches philosophy at the University of Alabama as an associate professor specializing in ethical theory.\n\nReturning to the game\n\nBack in June, nearly 30 years after retiring from competitive chess, Rachels took part in the 2021 Alabama Blitz Championship and the 2021 Alabama Quick Championship in Montgomery. Rachels won all of his games to sweep the Alabama Blitz Championship. With all wins and a draw, he pulled out on top in the Alabama Quick Championship as well.\n\nScott Varagona,\n\nreigning Alabama State Chess Champion and editor for the Alabama Chess Antics magazine, said he always heard older players talk about Rachels with a sense of awe, but he had never had the chance to play him. With Rachels returning, Varagona was not going to miss the opportunity. “For him to resurface after all these years, and for me to finally get to face him in a serious tournament, was a big deal for me. After all, he was Alabama’s strongest player of the 20th century,” said Varagona. “Even though he hadn’t played competitive chess for over 25 years, whereas I was the reigning Alabama State Champion, he beat me very badly! I was impressed.” Varagona said he was too nervous and starstruck against Rachels to play at his best, but believes he would do better if he got another chance to play him.\n\nRachels said that going back to those tournaments after years away was like sticking his toes in the water. “For me, it was ‘sort of’ like playing in a real tournament. I didn’t consider it ‘fully real’ because the time control was accelerated, we weren’t keeping score, and it didn’t affect my classical rating,” he said. “But I enjoyed it, and I was relieved to discover that I can still push pawns okay.” When asked if he will pursue more competitions or potentially seek attaining the coveted Grandmaster title, Rachels said he will probably play more. “It’s a slow process,” he said. “I doubt I will play again seriously enough to pursue the GM title, but who knows.”\n\nLarger than life\n\nRachels said that today, things are different for professional players in the United States. While he still believes it to be an odd life, players can make a living on social media platforms, like Twitch, where they can livestream games to subscribers. “The internet brings grandmasters into everyone’s living room,” Rachels said, “or, indeed, everyone’s pocket.” Over the last few years, there has been a boom in the game with more people learning chess for the first time, most notably following the popularity of the Netflix miniseries “The Queen’s Gambit.” According to The New York Times, sales of chess sets in the United States rose by around 125% since the show first premiered.\n\nRachels said he was thrilled to see how popular the game is continuing to be. “I wish people would power down their screens and get out and play more in-person, that would make me even happier. It’s better for the culture to be in-person,” Rachels said. “Interest in chess also surged in 1972 when Bobby Fischer became world champion. This surge feels more real to me, though, because in 1972, it was about Fischer himself, and so when Fischer quit, people lost interest in chess. Now, however, it’s about people actually playing.” Last week, Rachels was inducted into the first class of the Alabama Chess Hall of Fame.\n\nBill Melvin,\n\na prominent player and figure in the Alabama chess community, played Rachels a handful of times over 30 years ago. While he wasn’t able to make Rachels’ comeback tournament, Melvin was surprised that he actually participated. “Stuart’s impact on chess is simply as the greatest talent to come out of Alabama,” Melvin said. “His star was bright, but he quit chess at such an early age. He has explained his reasoning with me many times, but I still don’t understand.”\n\nVaragona echoed Melvin, saying that Rachels proved that an Alabama player could reach the pinnacle of chess in the nation, something no Alabama player has come close to achieving since. “There have been many great Alabama chess legends — but then there is Stuart Rachels. Stuart is larger than life.”\n\nhttps://www.cbs42.com/news/local/from-prodigy-to-champion-stuart-rachels-was-the-best-alabama-saw-in-chess/\n\nBecause of the enforced time spent at home recently I have rummaged through older Chess material found collecting dust. Finding a compilation of games by IM Boris Kogan filled me with elation.\n\nBoris Kogan with raised hand at Lone Pine (From the Mechanic’s Institute Newsletter)\n\nMy collection, which was gone with the rain, thanks to crazy cousin Linda, contained games put together by Tom Fallis. Although uncertain, I do not believe this collection is the same, but I could be mistaken.\n\nBoris was given the sobriquet, “Hulk” Kogan, after the popular wrestler called Hulk Hogan, by the Legendary Georgia Ironman. Boris was a professional and he rarely lost, but when he did lose he never withdrew. If he lost in the first round, and I can recall that occurring only one time, he finished with a score of 4-1. To our small Chess community the Hulking Boris Kogan was a mighty Oak Tree.\n\nThe writer of these words is to write a review of the new book about to be published by New In Chess magazine, still the best Chess magazine on the planet. Most probably, the book, written by former US Chess Co-Champion, Stuart Rachels,\n\nand a student of Boris Kogan, should have already arrived, but the situation with the COVID-19 virus has altered things dramatically, and the mail is no longer timely. For instance, the Chess magazine from England never arrived and a replacement needed to be sent, only recently arrived thanks to Paul Harrington at Chess, and Greg Yanez of Chess4Less! The mailbox has been empty for days…The April issue of Chess has yet to arrive and it was coming around the first of the month; this is being written on April 12.\n\nJohn Smith was a class ‘A’ player on the day this game was played. After the game Smitty was no longer considered a class ‘A’ player, but a man who had taken down a mighty Hulk tree. Smitty, who almost earned the NM title, is profiled in an earlier post. (https://xpertchesslessons.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/paradise-by-the-chessboard-light/)\n\nThis writer learned more about Chess from the IM of GM strength, Boris Kogan, than was learned from all the books and magazines read prior to his arrival in the Great State of Georgia. Unfortunately, implementing the knowledge gained was lost in the translation, I am sad to report…\n\nBoris proved himself human in the game as he lost his focus, and/or concentration. Uncertain as to which round this game was played I will say the three rounds in a day, and five over the course of a weekend, was not to his liking. “Mike,” I can still hear him say, “You Americans CRAZY!” We were, no doubt, crazy for Chess!\n\nAtlanta November Open\n\nJohn Wiley Smith Jr. vs IM Boris Kogan\n\nA28 English, four knights, Nimzovich variation\n\n1. c4 e5 2.

These amazing and fantastic studies, some classics from bygone ages, others originally published in the Soviet Union, or ex-Soviet countries, and Sergei’s own compositions, are a feast for those who enjoy expanding their minds and improve their play.\n\nI recall reading a story about former US Chess Champion Stuart Rachels,\n\nfrom Alabama, in which his father, James Rachels, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama, a position in which one can now find Stuart, who followed in his father’s footsteps, said that when he came home Stuart would often greet him in the driveway while holding a Chess board with a study he had been attempting to solve.

They were called mansubat (singular: mansuba), which can be translated from Arabic as “an arrangement.” Around 700 mansubat have survived, some of which involve a lone knight n the finale.”\n\nMansuba No. A1 from the XII century has spawned a vast number of studies:\n\nWhite to move and win\n\nUnknown author, XII century\n\nThe next is from one of the most famous Chess players in the history of the game:\n\nWhite to move and win\n\nAuthor Paul Keres, 1936\n\nI had the good fortune to meet Paul Keres\n\nA stamp released in the USSR in 1991 to mark the 75th anniversary of the birth of Paul Keres\n\nat the Church’s Fried Chicken tournament in San Antonio, Texas in 1972.

It could jump diagonally over both its own player’s and its opponent’s pieces. At the same time, this bishop was much weaker and more vulnerable: it moved diagonally only two squares at a time (no lese and no more)), which made it easy prey for more mobile pieces.” Examples are given, but you must purchase the book to see them, as I give only modern examples:\n\nWhite to move and draw\n\nAuthor Jan Timman, 1982 (Grandmaster Jan Timman\n\nis the Honorary Editor of the best Chess magazine in the world, New In Chess)\n\nWhite to move and draw\n\nAuthor Pal Benko,\n\n1967 (Everyone should be familiar with Pal Benko, the man who punched out by Bobby Fischer! http://chessmoso.blogspot.com/2010/12/getting-killed-over-chess-game.html)\n\nIn One Rook Saves the Day\n\nwe find:\n\n“In the game of shatranj, a precursor of modern chess, the rook was the strongest piece.

Since receiving these books I attempt to solve at least one study. There have been days when I hold the position in my mind and reflect on it throughout the day. For example, yesterday I kicked back in our new recliner to rest, close my eyes, and there was the morning position. One day we were busy so I had not had time to attempt to solve the position that had been indelibly etched in my memory, but when I went to bed that night, there was the position, which I was still unable to solve. The next morning, after taking a couple of jolting slugs of coffee, I opened the book currently being read, looked at the page, and “Wa La,” there was the position! Getting up immediately I walked over to the desk graciously given to me by my friend Michael (Mulfish) Mulford when he moved to Lost Wages, set up the board, and solved the study!\n\nThe books are published by Elk and Ruby (https://twitter.com/ilan_ruby?lang=en).\n\n‏I love these books I have come to think of as little nuggets of gold!\n\n“If you play the Caro-Kann when young, what are you going to play when old?” – Bent Larsen\n\nFederico Perez Ponsa (2553)\n\nvs Hikaru Nakamura (2781)\n\nGibraltar Masters 2018\n\nRound 3\n\n1. e4 c6 2.

Seeing this game caused me to reflect on a post found at GM Kevin Spraggett’s website recently, Samurai Spassky. Kevin provides Spassky’s original annotations to a Caro-Kann game played in 1959: Boris Spassky vs Aaron Reshko, St.Petersburg. Also provided is a PDF of a 1969 Soviet-Life article containing Spassky’s thoughts on the Caro-Kann, which I transcribed:\n\n“The Caro-Kann is quite popular now, but it is usually employed by passive-minded players. The main idea of this system is that Black temporarily declines a Pawn battle in the middle and strives, instead, to quickly as possible finish deploying his forces, especial the Queen’s Bishop, before the King’s Pawn move P-K3. Only after this does he launch vigorous operations in the center. The result is that Black’s position is solid, even though passive. The weakness of this system is that it offers White too much a wide a choice of possible patterns of development, which provides not only chess, but also psychological trumps.”\n\nhttp://www.spraggettonchess.com/samurai-spassky/\n\nFormer US Chess Champion Stuart Rachels,\n\nnow an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama, said, “Play main lines.” That may be good advice for top flight players, but for the rest of us, “Where is the fun in that?” I have never, ever, not once, played Bf5. After 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 I have only played 3…c5 and Qb6. Upon returning to Chess after leaving the Royal game for the more lucrative Backgammon I played mostly obscure and little known openings, such as what was called by Kazim Gulamali,\n\nthe “Caro-Kann Krusher.” 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 f3!\n\nNow there is a book on the move…\n\nThere are so many multifarious opening lines, yet top players continue to trot out the same ol’, same ol’…BORING!\n\nKevin plays the “passive” 5…exf6 in this game, which features double doubled pawns, and a Queen sacrifice!\n\nDaniel H.

Hayes\n\nOctober 31, 1915 – February 15, 2001\n\nRea Bruce Hayes was born in Weston Ontario, Canada, on October 31, 1915. His first memory of chess was when he was taught to play at age eleven by a boy in the neighborhood. When he thought his friend was being inconsistent about the rules, Rea “read the article in the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica”. From that point on he was the teacher.\n\nRea joined the St. Clair Chess Club in Toronto and became its champion a few years later. This club later became the Canada Dairies Chess Club.\n\nHe moved to Greeneville, South Carolina in 1953 and won his first tournament at Columbia. One trophy was for being the South Carolina Open Champion, the other one was for being the highest scoring South Carolina resident. At the time, no one expected a resident to win the state tournament outright. In 1954, Rea was again the South Carolina Open Champion, but he only received one trophy this time.\n\nWhile living in South Carolina, Rea tied for third with a 5-2 score in the 1953 Southern Open in Columbia. He finished in a foursome of 5.5-1.5 scores in the 1954 Southern Open in Atlanta and had to settle for fourth on tie breaks.\n\nFrom South Carolina, Rea transferred to Chattanooga, TN for a two year period. Having just moved, he entered the 1955 Southern Open in Chattanooga and won the Southern Championship with a 6-1 score.\n\nRea lived the next 30 years of his life in Cincinnati, Ohio. There, he organized the Parkway Chess Club and the City League, a chess team competition. He revived the city championship which had been abandoned for years, winning both the city and club championship many times. For his efforts on behalf of the club, Rea is an honorary member.\n\nIn Ohio, the annual Ohio Championship was captured outright by Rea in 1963, winning with only one draw. Several other times, he tied for first in the event. The Region V Championship was his at least once. He was instrumental in organizing the Cincinnati Open, the second annual tournament in Ohio. He was also the president of the Ohio Chess Association. Rea was twice honored by his Cincinnati club, as Chessman of the Decade (1958-1968) and again when he left Cincinnati in 1987.\n\nBefore leaving Cincinnati, Rea retired from Union Central Life where he worked as an actuary. Rea visited New Zealand in 1980-1981. Playing chess with players in the Hastings area, one of them paid him the compliment of saying that if Rea lived there, he would be the second or third player in the country.\n\nDuring 1981, he traveled to Sun City West in Arizona, to take part in the 1st US Senior Open tournament. Although ranked 7th of the eight upper section players, he won top honors. He conceded only one draw, to the player ranking below him. He also won the upset prize, a nice wristwatch, for beating the favorite, Eric Marchand.\n\nRea’s lasting legacy is being the first US Senior Champion. The Senior trophy now rests at the US Chess Hall of Fame in Washington DC with his name engraved first on the list of champions.\n\nHe moved to Chattanooga for the second time in 1990 and became a regular player at the tournaments in and around the state of Tennessee. In 1992, he entered the 46th Annual Tennessee Open in Oak Ridge and captured State Champion honors. He had three wins and three draws.\n\nSince his coming to Chattanooga and the Chattanooga Chess Club, Rea fulfilled the role of Chessman of the Area. He served in almost every club capacity over the years, including president and newsletter editor. All of his contributions and accomplishment have prompted the Chattanooga Chess Club to elect him Life Member and hold an annual tournament in his honor.\n\nRea Hayes\n\nFor US Co-Champion Stuart Rachels advised young players to play main lines because, “There is a reason they are main lines.” Where is the fun in that? How many times can a player trot the same old fifteen or twenty moves of “book” without becoming bored enough to fall asleep at the board? The so-called “Super GM’s” still, for the most part, play main lines, but I have noticed a tendency in other, lesser tournaments toward experimentation.\n\nConsider the thoughts of World Chess Champ Magnus Carlsen:\n\n“Since my collaboration with Kasparov, my strategy is as follows: At a time when all players prepare themselves with software, my goal is not to see if my computer is better than my opponent’s. In the openings, I just need to reach a position that gives me play. The idea is to be smart rather than trying to crush the other. I try to figure out where he wants to take me and I do my best to not put myself in positions where I could fall into his preparation. I try to play 40 or 50 good moves, and I challenge my opponent to do as much. Even if the position is simple and seems simple, I try to stay focused and creative, to find opportunities that lie within. Not to play it safe. It is important to know how to adapt to all situations.\n\nIn this sense, I have that in common with Karpov in his heyday: he believed deeply in his abilities, he was very combative and won a lot of games in tournaments because even when he was not in a good position, he felt he could still win, and played all the way. I’m somewhat similar in spirit: during a competition, I always believe in myself.” —Magnus Carlsen (http://en.chessbase.com/post/magnus-carlsen-explains-his-approach-to-chess)\n\nAlthough this was published on Chessbase, I took the above from the excellent Mechanic’s Institute Newsletter #668 by IM John Donaldson (http://www.chessclub.org/news.php?n=668).\n\nThis game was played yesterday in the seventh round of the Championship of Sweden:\n\nEmanuel Berg (2557) – Tommy Andersson (2336)\n\nch-SWE 2014 Borlänge (7.4), 2014.07.18\n\n1.e4 c5 2.a3 Nc6 3.b4 cxb4 4.axb4 Nxb4 5.c3 Nc6 6.d4 d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Na3 Bf5 9.Nb5 Rc8 10.Nxa7 Nxa7 11.Rxa7 Nf6 12.Nf3 g6 13.c4 Qe4+ 14.Be2 Bg7 15.O-O O-O 16.Ne5 Rfd8 17.Be3 Nd7 18.Bf3 Qh4 19.g3 Qf6 20.Bxb7 Rc7 21.Ra6 e6 22.Bg2 Nxe5 23.dxe5 Qe7 24.Rd6 Rdc8 25.g4 Bxe5 26.Rd2 Qh4 27.h3 Be4 28.Bxe4 Qxh3 29.f3 Rxc4 30.Qb3 Rxe4 31.fxe4 Rc3 32.Rd8+ Kg7 33.Rxf7+ Kxf7 34.Rd7+ Kf8 35.Qb4+ Kg8 36.Rd8+ Kf7 1-0\n\nThe opening followed this game, found on the CBDB:\n\nFrank Korostenski (1599) vs Laszlo Kos Kis (1241)\n\nLSS RC-2009.0 00038 1912 2009 B20\n\n1. e4 c5 2. a3 Nc6 3. b4 cxb4 4. axb4 Nxb4 5. c3 Nc6 6.\n\nd4 d5 7. exd5 Qxd5 8.
