        "text": "Day 9 report\n\nBy GM Alex Colovic\n\nDrama and excitement dominated the final round of the World Senior Team Championship. At first sight, none of it should have happened, but chess is a sport, and what seemed certain was anything but.\n\nThe favourites were playing outsiders in the last round, and two of the four leading teams did confirm their status.\n\nUSA beat Poland 4-0, though not without some luck. Their win was never in question, but the Polish team should have scored at least a draw on board one.\n\nShabalov (2465), playing black, sacrificed an exchange for sufficient compensation. The position is dynamically balanced, and in view of the threat …h4 White should have taken on a6 and then returned the exchange by taking on d6, with a likely draw.\n\nInstead, Gdanski (2484) panicked and played 33.Rxf5?? gxf5 34.Kh3 Bc5, losing the d5-bishop.\n\nOn the other boards, the difference in class was too big in favour of the Americans. Kaidanov (2549) beat Sapis (2375), Novikov (2513) beat Sielicki (1956), and Yermolinsky (2419) beat Flis (1948), none of them experiencing major problems.\n\nAlexander Shabalov | Photo: Mark Livshitz\n\nThe drama unfolded on board two in the match between Italy and Montenegro. Italy were leaders with the USA prior to the final round and, with a win in the match, they were guaranteed a silver medal, with gold a possibility depending on the tie-break.\n\nThings started well for Italy. David (2523) displayed exemplary technique to win a favourable double-rook endgame against Pajkovic (2412).\n\nHis win was followed by a win by Godena (2429), who pounced on a big blunder by Podlesnik (2289).\n\nThe game was balanced throughout, but here, White missed Black’s threat. He played 35.Qe3?? (better was 35.Qe1) Rf1 36.Kh2 Rf2 and the g2-pawn was lost, and with it, the game.\n\nOn board three Ortega (2410) was winning quickly after the opening. In a King’s Indian, he prepared well and obtained a decisive advantage by move 20 against Miljanic (2331).\n\nWhite had to switch the attack to the f-file with 26.Rf1 Nf7 27.Qf2, winning a piece in view of the tactic 27…Qd8 28.Qxf6! Qxf6 29.Ne8.\n\nInstead of that, he played a move dissonant with the dynamic nature of the position: 26.a3?? and after the simple 26…Nf7 Black regrouped and was unexpectedly already winning. White no longer had a breakthrough, while Black was up in material. Miljanic went on to pick up the pawns on e4 and d6 and won the game.\n\nThis dramatic turnaround proved decisive for the Italian team. Instead of a comfortable victory, they were facing the prospect of not winning the match.\n\nAt first, it didn’t seem so. Borgo (2333) obtained a winning advantage against Nikac (2275).\n\nHere 27…Nxe4 28.Rxe4 Qc5 with the threats of …d3 and …Rf8 was decisive: Black is a pawn up, and White's king is weak. Black missed this chance, and after 27…a4 28.Bd3 Nxd3 29.cxd3 was only marginally better.\n\nIn fact, here, he could have forced a draw by giving checks on e1 and d2. That would have won the match for Italy…\n\nCompletely unnecessarily, Borgo transposed the game to a rook endgame where only he could be worse.\n\nIt was a critical moment in the game. Black had to find the only move 35…Rd5! with the idea of 36.Rxb6 Rf5! cutting off the white king and threatening …Rf2xb2 if the white rook leaves the b-file. Unfortunately for Italy, he missed it, and after a few further mutual inaccuracies, White converted his advantage into a full point.\n\nItaly’s draw meant that the USA were clear first, winning gold.\n\nNow Italy could only hope for their competitors not to win their matches, but the competitors were merciless.\n\nItaly’s Michele Godena | Photo: Mark Livshitz\n\nEngland whitewashed the Chinese women’s team, China ShenZhen W50. It was a dominating performance, as on all four boards, the English grandmasters didn’t give a single chance to the Chinese ladies.\n\nIn the Exchange Ruy Lopez, Adams (2662) as Black outplayed Liu Shilan (2083). Emms (2448) beat Chunhong Ning (2266) by breaking down Fort Knox in the French Defence. Flear (2405) won a brilliant miniature against Yun Guo (2244), and Davies (2354) strangulated Yanfeng An (2259) on the white side of a Fianchetto King’s Indian Defence.\n\nThe English team | Photo: Mark Livshitz\n\nIceland beat England 2, but it was a tight affair.\n\nOn board one, a sensation was brewing as Dishman (2304) sacrificed a piece against Olafsson (2491).\n\nWhite played the thematic 10.Nd5! and after 10…exd5 11.exd5 Ne7 12.d4! he was already winning, similar to some variations in the Sicilian Defence.\n\nOlafsson defended to the best of his abilities, but that would not have saved him had White found the crushing blow in this position.\n\nAfter 28.d6! Nxd6 29.Qe5 White is winning as Black is too disorganized; his king is weak, while White’s rooks dominate after Rad1. White missed this chance, and after the preparatory 28.Rad1? allowed Black to establish a dark-square blockade with 28…Nd6, which helped him to save the draw.\n\nNeither Hjartarson (2432) against Lewis (2238) on board two nor Arnason (2419) against Clark (2278) on board three could achieve much. The win for Iceland came on board four, but not without luck.\n\nThorallsson (2382) started building up an attack on the kingside against Stebbings (2257). Black’s position was resilient enough, and in the critical moment, he could even have taken over the initiative.\n\nWhite's last move was 22.Re3, and here Black could have played 22…Nxe5! 23.Rxe5 Qd8! regaining the pinned knight and eliminating any danger. In fact, the position would have transposed to a drawn double-rook endgame after 24.Rh5 Qxf6 25.Qxf6 gxf6 26.Rxh6 Kg7.\n\nBlack missed this chance and soon came under a strong attack after 22…Rd8? 23.Qe4 (23.Rh3 or 23.Nh5 were even stronger). The position was impossible to defend in a practical game, and White went on to deliver checkmate.\n\nThis meant that Iceland won 2½-1½, but as it turned out, this wasn’t enough — by winning 4-0, England overtook Iceland on tie-breaks (board points) and finished second, with Iceland third. On the other hand, it was just enough to edge out Italy by half a point (on tie-break) to secure bronze, as all three teams had 14 match points.\n\nIceland | Photo: Mark Livshitz\n\nThe tournament ended in a tragedy for Italy, who finished fourth and without a medal. Who could ever imagine that sharing first place coming into the last round is not enough for a team to make it to the podium?\n\nIncidentally, England’s 4-0 win directly affected the top finishers of the Women’s teams. England’s W50 team beat Finland 2½-1½ and overtook China ShenZhen W50 by a mere half a point to win gold and become World Champions!\n\nEngland’s W50 team | Photo: Mark Livshitz\n\nS65 section\n\nIn the S65 section, things went as expected, though even here, there was some drama before the dust settled.\n\nGermany Lasker Schachstiftung GK drew their match with Germany and secured gold.\n\nEngland 1 beat Switzerland 4-0 SG RIEHEN to claim silver.\n\nNeeding just a draw in the match with France, Slovakia were on the brink of a defeat. In case of France’s win they would have shared third place with a better tie-break score, their direct duel, which would have given les bleus the last-minute bronze.\n\nAnd they were so close…\n\nFor a very long time, Ftacnik (2450) was trying to win a 3 vs 2 on the same wing rook endgame against Legky (2357). Eventually, they reached this theoretical endgame where Legky seemed confident to draw, playing …Ra8-b8.\n\nFtacnik sent his king to f5, in an attempt to prolong the game, at least. And then a miracle happened.\n\nInstead of continuing with side checks as he had done before, Legky inexplicably played 95...Rf1??? after which 96.Ke6 was already winning for White — with no side checks, White easily builds a bridge to win.\n\nAn unbelievable change of fortunes! With this strike of luck, Slovakia secured bronze.\n\nGermany Lasker Schachstiftung GK | Photo: Mark Livshitz\n\nIn the S65 section, the Latvian women finished ahead of Germany, so these two teams won gold and silver, respectively.\n\nThe tournament finished with a lot of drama and excitement. The event demonstrated that senior players still have a shot in the locker and can produce some thrilling chess.\n\nCongratulations to the winners, and until the next time!\n\nStandings and pairings: S50 | S65\n\nReplay all available games at Live.ChessBase.com: S50 | S65\n\nAll available games - S50\n\nAll available games - S65\n\nLinks"
