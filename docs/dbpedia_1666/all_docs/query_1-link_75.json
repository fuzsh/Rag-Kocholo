For some reason both my Netscape and Microsoft InternetBrowser froze up after starting the Lamont Clan presentation. Occasionally myDell computer decides to fickle up on me and be non-cooperative for no goodreason. I don't know if you have had an opportunity to view mine at Error!Bookmark not defined. I also derive from a Duncan McKercher who marriedCatherine McLellan in 1786. They resided in Glen Lyon which is in Perthshire.For at least three generations, my family was closely associated with theMeggernie estate. Recently since I posted my web site, I've had the pleasure ofhearing from several McKerchers, etc from all parts of Canada,Nova Scotia and the West Coast.One chap sent me a picture of himself because he said a photo of my son and Ilooked so much like his grandfather. He was a dead ringer for my cousin..eerily so. Am I correct in assuming you are of the Lamont Clan? We areFarquharsons with our sept having originally come from the Braemar region ..most probably dating back to service with the Earl of Montrose on his campaignsof 1645. I'd like to hear more about your family if your are interested. Again,I appreciate hearing from you. Regards, John MacKercher ----- Original Message-----\n\nThanks for the message. A site you might find interestingis;\n\nError! Bookmark not defined.\n\nI am descended from Duncan McKerracher of Perthshire whoimmigrated to Ontario Canada in the early 1800's.

MacKercher\"<[email protected]> To: [email protected] References:\n\n1\n\nHi Alvin, I'd like to give you a definitive answer, but Ican't really. The spelling should not beas important as is from where your family came. Most of the McKerchers, et al from Perthshire belong to the FarquharsonClan. I suggest you might look at twolinks in my web site. One deals directlywith our surname. You will see how often ... even within one's family .. thespelling of the name differs even within the same generation. Sometimes there is an explanation\n\n..\n\noften there is not. The other link relates to the Farquharson Clan with some simple butinteresting background on the Clan's origins and septs. When you were at Braemar, did you go over toInvercauld which of course houses the Clan Chief of the Farquharsons. Guess you did when you went to see the ClanChief. My ancestors are reported to me as staunch supporters of the Stuarts andpretty much in trouble with the British Crown most of the time. This coincides with the Farquharsonbranch. I was told at a very young agewe were not associated with the Lamonts. I suppose this was because of the suggestion those M'Kerchers hadseparate and different views of the English. I never pressed the issue as I didn't understand the problem at thetime. Sorry I can't get into the Lamontweb as I'd prefer to know more about them than what I've read in Kith and Kinas well as the commercial clan books I own. Best regards, John P. S. My McKerchers migrated from Aberdeenshire toGlen Lyon in the mid\n\n17th century. Theyhad lived in Inverie which is a very small community very closeby toBraemar. By the way, did you go and seethe Cairn of Remembrance when you were at Braemar. It's aside the Dee River closer to Balmoralthan Braemar. Beautiful country isn't it. [email protected] wrote:\n\nmy Duncan McKerracher was supposedly a Farquharson too. Iwent to Braemar to talk to the clan leader in 1984. the Lamonts indicate we belong to them also...which isright ?? The Lamont web site makes this claim..much of the history is unknownto me..The Lamonts say their clan was called MacKerracher....and then the namewas changed.. ??\n\nregards\n\nAlvin P mcKerracher\n\nHi Barry, Thank you so much for your Easter greetings. Wehad a fine week-end although our children were all some distance from us. Ihope you had a happy observance. Let me assure you I am delighted to hear fromand about you. Several years ago, I copied whatever information I could findabout my family in the censuses of 1841, 1851 and 1861. This was taken fromrecords posted by the Church of the Latter Day Saints in their genealogicallibrary. At that time I did not know all the family members of my great-grandfatherFarquhar (really born Fercher in 1798) except for Malcolm and Duncan.Consequently I only took info from the censuses on them. Fercher also had aDonald, William and John as brothers. Donald was in the Army and served in theBattle of Waterloo and in several other actions. He was eventually dischargedin Canada, but reappeared in the 1861 census in Glen Lyon as an army pensioner.Unfortunately, I know nothing about either William or John. The Farcher andBetty plus children you cite were my great-grandparents and their children eventhough the ages were off a few years for Farcher and Betty who was ElizabethMacKenzie. By the 1861 Census, she was fessing up to her true years. I wouldreally like to get anything you have on any John or William who might matchup----- John was born on May 15, 1792 and William on October 29, 1794. I havenothing further on them. John would have been 49 and William 47 on the 1841census, but whether they still lived in Glen Lyon or even Perthshire, for thatmatter, I don't know. You have succeeded in getting back a 110 years earlierthan I have. But when I started all this, I knew hardly anything beyond mygrandfather who had come to the U. S. from Scotland sometime in the 1870s. So Ifeel rewarded for the effort expended. And, of course, I continue to seek infothat will take my back even further.

You indicateyour ancestor John was born in 1792. As you got from my previous email, mygreat grandfather Fercher McKercher had a brother John born on May 15, 1792 at'Migerney'. His parents were Duncan McKercher and Catherine McLellan .. mygreat-great grandparents. I reviewed all the data I have on John McKerchersborn in that time frame. There were only two other Johns born in 1792 in thegeneral Glen Lyon region. One was born to Duncan McKerchar and Jean McNab ofBalquidder which is about 6 miles south of Killin or the wester end of theGlen. The other was John born to Duncan McKercher & Isobel Brown on 24September 1792 at Kerochlach. I have poured over my 1841 Census notes verycarefully and come up with John McKerchar who was an agricultural laborer atMeggernie. His age was listed as 45 which would have his birthdate in or around1796. This is what threw me off the track because it didn't jibe with 1792 orthe year in which my John was born. I have since learned those ages as givenare not always accurate. In any regard, this John's wife was Christy, age 35.Their daughter was also Christy and her age on that 1841 Census was 15. Ibelieve your John and my John are one in the same. I never knew about Duncan,the son of your John. He would have been 30 at the time of that Census andprobably had begun a family of his own or moved. His name Duncan is veryimportant. He being the first born son of John and Christy was probably namedafter his paternal grandfather. I also believe John's working at Meggernie atthat time is highly significant. Our family was very much occupied with theMeggernie Estate. Incidentally, there were 29 persons residing at Meggernie onthe day in June 1841 when the census was taken. At least 11 of them wereMcKerchars. My Farquhar accounted for eight of them and John, Christian andChristie their daughter were the other three. Do you know the names of yourJohn's parents? I do hope it was Duncan McKercher and Catherine McLellan. Theywere wed in 1786. Barry I would welcome anything you care to send me about yourfamily and whatever else you would like to share. I didn't ask you in myprevious email because I didn't want to put you to the trouble, but in view ofthis development I'm anxious to see these materials. My address is 9445 RubyFalls Court, Brooksville, FL 34613. I am anxiously awaiting your reaction toall this.

Iam continuing my search back into the past and always seeking connections withdescendants of this early family. You can find out considerably more about myforebears by visiting my web site at http://www.familytreemaker.com/ftm/m/a/c/John-C-Mackercher/index.htmlI would be delighted to hear from you if you are interested. Regards, John\n\n9 Apr 2000 email from Barbara Bouskill\n\nI was delighted to receive your e-mail a few weeks ago andapologize for taking so long to reply. My mother was a McKerchar. The farthestI have been able to go back on the McKerchar family is a John McKerchar, bornabout 1743 in Kenmore, Perthshire, Scotland. He married first a CatherineCampbell on August 12, 1772 in Kenmore. She died about 1786 and he then marriedChristian Robertson March 23, 1788 in Kenmore. Unfortunately the records forthe year 1743 are missing from the Perthshire Records Office, so we haven't yetdetermined who John's parents were and what exactly is his birth date. We foundhis age at date of death on his tombstone in the Kenmore Church Yard. We haveinformation on most of the descendants of John's by both wives, and would beglad to send this information to you if you thought there might be a connectionto the family you are researching.\n\nI have checked the names you provided with the names we havein our Family Tree and although the same McKercher/ar names appear time andagain, the dates do not coincide!! I did notice, however, that the name Rob Royappears in your Family Tree and I am wondering if you are connected to theMcGregors. I have been corresponding (and have visited) a John AlexanderMcKercher in Ottawa and we have found we are connected through the McGregors,but have not yet found any connection through the McKercher/ars!! (John's son,Alexander. married a Janet McGregor of Lawers, on Loch Tay, in Kenmore,November 14, 1818.\n\nWe visited a Donald McGregor in Fortingall a couple of yearsago and discovered his mother was a McKerchar. Again, we haven't been able todiscover a relationship, but we figure there must be one some where along theline!! As a matter of fact he and his wife visited us in Winnipeg lastSeptember. They are a wonderful couple.\n\nWe will likely be seeing John McKercher in Ottawa in thefall and I will show him your information then to see if he can come up with arelationship to you.\n\nAlso we are going to Salt Lake City next month and if I comeup with anything there I will let you know.\n\nIn the meantime, if you would like me to send you whatinformation I have, I would be very pleased to do so.\n\nRegards\n\nBarbara Bouskill\n\nemail from Barbara Bouskill of 11 Apr 2000\n\nThank you for your e-mail today. I am attaching two FamilyTree Maker files which I am hoping will be of interest to you. I would beinterested in hearing if there are any \"matches\"!! I will keep intouch!\n\nRegards, Barbara\n\nemail from Barbara Bouskill of 11 Apr 2000\n\nTuesday, April 11, 2000 1:19 PM Sorry my first attempt didnot work!!

Weather has been cool at night, but decentduring the day. We'll be climbing backinto the 80s this week and the 60s at night. Actually cool weather is a treat here. I've got to get a reading on theFamily History Libraries of which you write. That's the Latter Day Saints facilities, right? I recorded many of the more interesting filmsfrom which I took info at the genealogy library I used to go in Virginia andnothing matches the one you provided me. I have not seen it but would be interested in what you find. Roroyare is a place familiar to me because ofthe mid-1800 censuses I've seen. It isclose by the area from which my family lived in Glen Lyon. All my immediate family came from or verynear to Meggernie, Gallin cottage, and Moar farm. I went searching for your website this evening and I have had some trouble with my computer and lost someweb sites as I reloaded both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape 4.7. Yours I am sad to say is one of thosesomewhere out there in the ether. I would appreciate having it again. I believeI told you I have the family well documented back to 1786 when my GGGrandfatherDuncan McKercher married Catherine McLellan at Meggerie. I am reasonably certain he had a brotherDonald who married Christian McLellan on\n\n9 July 1787. They hadat least eight children between 1790 and 1806 including: Betty, Duncan,Christy, Malcolm, Mary, John, Donald and Margaret. I believe there may havebeen others brothers like Malcolm, John and Donald in the family I've beensearching for since hector was a pup. I have been searching for a Duncan orMalcolm, Donald or John McKercher who might have been married in the late 1750sor early 1760s in the Meggernie area. Both Gallin and Moar, these are farms on the Meggernie estate, seem tohave been home to my family. The best lead I have is a Duncan McKachater (thisspelling doesn't bother me) who married an Ann? in 1762 at Miggerney. They had a Duncan and Margaret with nobirthdates recorded. I believe theyare my Duncan's parents. There was also a Duncan McKercher/KathrinMcDiarmaid who had a Malcolm on 29 April 1759 at Innerwesty in Fortingallparish. As for another name likeDonald, Donald McKercher wed KatharineMcArthur on 2 Feb 1751 in Weem. They had two girls Janet and Mary and Duncanborn in Fortingall on 15 Feb 1759 .. a possibility. Donald McKercher and Margaret Menzies of Weemhad a Donald on 24 May 1761. The onlyMalcolm who is at all within the timeframe married Margaret McKercher on 20 or21 November 1762 in Fortingall. I sendthis your way in case you ever come upon a McKercher family in the Glen Lyon,Kenmore, Killin areas who might fit in with any of these folks. I believe there was a Duncan, Malcolm, Donaldand perhaps a John and Fercher as well. These names kept coming up in our later McKercher families. Who are yourrelatives from Glen Lyon? I have somefair records on these McKerchers and perhaps could be of help orcorroboration. It's now almost 1 a.m.and a busy week ahead. Nice to haveheard from you again.

Anyway, I'm contacting you to see if perhapsyou have seen or heard about this book.\n\nA friend of mine was going through a catalog at one of theFamily History libraries and came across a book that lists McKerchers' in Scotland. It's actually a manuscript. It's on film and it's called: Genealogy ofPeter Campbell of Roroyare, Glenlyon, Perthshire, Scotland Author: PeterCampbell of Campbell, Gordon FHL U/Can film #1787180 item 12\n\nI haven't seen it and my local FHL is closed for repairsuntil June 15. You may have already seen it, I just thought I pass italong. I am going to request it as soonas the library opens again. Glenlyon iswhere some of my McKercher's came from.\n\nTake care,\n\nMarie in New Jersey\n\nDear John, Glad you are all doing well. Our snow is all gonethis morning... The Family Library nearest me is very small. It's in Caldwell,New Jersey. I understand there is a larger one, but its about 2 and 1/2 hoursfor me. This one is only 20 minutes. They have been pretty good getting film Ineed in the past. By the way, last night I checked the catalog of Latter DaySaints online and sure enough they had this Manuscript by Gordon Campbell\n\nHi Marie, Thank you for giving me your web site again. I've got it safely bookmarked on Netscape andalso a Favorite on my MSIE 5. I have only exchanged a few emails withBobby. He seems like a nice youngfellow. He's the one who feels my sonand I look like his grandfather who was in the Navy. And Bobby is the one who is a dead ringer formy late cousin Rex MacKercher. He seemed very proud of his grandfather and hisnaval service. Perhaps he was being niceto me because he knew I was Navy as is my son Jay. I think we have a clue about how hisgrandfather might prefer this hot potato to be handled. Bobby has told both of us that hisGrandfather didn't talk about the family. Now you and I know the reason why. Times and mores have changed, but I believe it might be best not toreveal this fact to Bobby. Only last week I had a niece visiting me. She learned that a member of her brother inlaw's had exactly the same situation. Only the person involved was deceased. She wondered about telling her sister. My advice which my niece sought was not to tell her sister. The deceased can't defend their actions andone never knows what mitigating circumstances caused them to do what others maymisunderstand. Bobby might handle itvery well. He is, after all, of anothergeneration. On the proverbial otherhand, he might not take to it. And, ofcourse, those are the circumstances in which the messenger ends up the bad guyor gal. Did you find the actual Campbell manuscript on the LDS site. If so, could you give me the URL? Weathertoday is ideal and the big visitation time is at hand. Our son Rob and his family arrive thisweek-end as does THE sister of the niece I was discussing. She, naturally, is my niece too. Warmregards, John or Jack as the family and my friends call me. ----- OriginalMessage ----- From: \"Marie Bartley Coppola\"<[email protected]> To: \"John C.

Ohwell....\n\nAs I started to say, if you click on the address below ittakes you to the LDS catalog, sure enough I found the manuscript. I copied and pasted the info for you in caseyou want to order the film through your library.\n\nRegarding my McKerchers' , they all claim to come fromPerthshire, Scotland, the problem I'm having is finding out exactly when theyarrived in America. I'm still finding ancestors (although not my direct line)in New York state before the American Revolution. I know for a fact that Margaret McMartin,was born in Glen Lyon, Perthshire, Scotland July 10, 1790 and she married my John McKercher in New York 28 Mar 1811. Margaret and John are my g-g-g grandparents.\n\nThen there is Margaret McKenzie, 1827 born in Inverness, Scotland and she married John McKercher and MargaretMcMartin's oldest son Daniel in New York\n\n15 Apr 1854. She washis second wife.\n\nAs far as the spelling of the McKercher surname , I agreewith you. I have found it in so manyvariations that I've learned not to dismiss anything. A direct hit was foundunder the spelling MacKirkey. So thattells you.\n\nMy personal webpage address is :http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Forest/1527/\n\nI'm in the process of changing it a bit. I want to add a different section formilitary, I seems that so many of themfought in the Civil War, Spanish American War, and then later generationscontinued to serve in the Army, Navy. That I think they deserve their own special spot. (must be the A.F. brat in me)\n\nI also have a ton of new things to add to the page, newlines I've found. Remember Bobby McKercher from California? Well he was pretty sure he belonged on mytree. Sure enough after quite a bit ofdigging in Ohio I found his link to our tree. He said his grandfather Roy Duncan McKercher, joined the Navy at a veryyoung age and always refused to talk about his family. Once I found the connection I wrote Bobby andhe was thrilled. What I haven't told them is that Roy's parents never married, Roy's father had a wife and children, and henever divorced her, so he had Roy out ofwedlock with Bobby's great-grandmother. I haven't told him. I don't know if I should. I hardly know Bobby other than thisgenealogy. What do you think? betteryet, what would you do in my place? Sometimes these things are not totally accurate. Although the person who told me is a niece ofRoy in her late 80's and she seems to be sure about all this.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarie\n\nhttp://www.familysearch.org/Search/searchcatalog.asp\n\nAnd click on surname, Type the surname McKercher and this is what they show\" surname:mckercher\n\nTitle search results: Genealogy of Peter Campbell ofRoroyare : Glenlyon, Perthshire, Scotland Campbell, Gordon.

And I agree that at some point we are going to find that magicconnection between our families. The appearance of Farquhar is important. Itappeared only once that I can recall outside my family insofar as Glen Lyon isconcerned. And that was a chap of that name who was almost the same age as mygreat grandfather. He and his wife raised 9 or 10 children over in Killiin ..nearby to Glen Lyon on Loch Tay. Lee and I stayed there one night at an ancientinn next to the river where the salmon ran. I found the Michigan McKerchers ofgreat interest. They came largely from the eastern part of the state .. beingat Flint and down in Monroe to the south. My Michigan family came from CedarSprings which is in the western part of the state north of Grand Rapids.Actually the McKercher who married the gal from Reed City was near in age to myDad who was born in 1890. Reed City is about 50 miles due north of CedarSprings. I don't think my Dad ever knew about the McKerchers of Flint. Hetraveled throughout the state as a young fellow .. including Flint and astelephone directories became more popular always checked them out forMcKerchers. During my time in the Navy, when we first went on assignment to SanDiego, California .. Lee had a humorous experience. She got a call from a ladywho asked her if she was married to Jack MacKercher. Lee replied in theaffirmative to which the gal said, \"well that's a coincidence .. so amI!\" And she was .. but not to me. Her Jack was a McKercher from Nebraska.We met socially and the ladies saw a considerable similarity between Jack andmyself. Both fair, blue eyes, etc. Perhaps a year or so later, I was pulledover .. and rightfully so .. by one of San Diego's finest for speeding. As he beganto write me up, he studied my driver's license .. closed his book, smiled andsaid he couldn't be giving someone with the same last name as his a ticket. Hewas Jack's brother. Every so often now, I get an email from a McKercher. Lastweek it was Nick who hails from Mexico. He descended from a William McKercherof Glen Lyon but knew absolutely nothing more about his roots. His English wasvery broken, so I replied to him in Spanish. All good fun. Please keep intouch. I do enjoy hearing from and about you. Jack ----- Original Message -----From: Marie Bartley Coppola To: John C. MacKercher Sent: Saturday, August 19,2000 11:20 PM Subject: McKerchers Hi Jack, Hope all is well with you and yourfamily. I know of your interest in the Michigan McKerchers. This is a biographyof John C. McKercher, St. Joseph County, Michigan, son of Malcolm McKercher ofLivingston County, New York, one of my McKerchers. I can't help but thinkeventually we will find a tie to link both your ancestors and mine back to GlenLyon were they all appear to be from originally. I will continue digging! Whichreminds me of an embarrassing situation just last month. I volunteer at mylocal historical society even though none of my ancestors are from this area.Anyway, I volunteered for two separate jobs; one to help clean up an oldcemetery, and the other one to help transcribe the grave stones. Well, mydaughter took the message from the society to meet at the cemetery on aSaturday, except she made a mistake. I was suppose to meet with the group toread the stones, my daughter wrote down I was suppose to come to clean up thecemetery. So I showed up with a shovel and a few other gardening tools...Youshould have seen the expression on the faces of a few \"blue-haired\"little old ladies. The local newspaper was there to take some PR shots... Afterthey stopped laughing, they took a picture of me with my shovel and the captionread....\"This volunteer will go to any extreme to find her roots!\"<grin> Take care Jack, Marie http://www.geocities.com/mckerchers\n\nDouglas McKercher, who teaches Gaelic at Canada's Universityof Ottawa added significantly to ourknowledge of the MacKerchers and the lore which surrounds our ancestors. Here is his email in its entirety.\n\n\"I'm writing you about your page on the name'McKercher'.\n\nFirst off, MacIntosh means 'son of the Thane'. The thane inquestion was the Thane of Fife, MacDuff. Not only were the MacDuffs of Royaldescent, but their red lyon rampant was appropriated to the Royal coat of arms,where it is found to this day. The MacDuffs were hereditary crowners of laterKings of Scots, among other quite singular privileges. As descendants ofFarquhar Shaw MacIntosh, the McKerchers share that Royal descent, and can boastof an ancestor mentioned in Shakespeare!\n\nMacFhearchair is, as you say, the Gaelic original of thesurname/patronymic. To make a genitive after Mac, you have to both lenite andnarrow (add an i to the end of) the name.\n\nFearchar was a common given name in Scotland. As a result,there was more than one Fearchar who had sons. They were not all related. Howdo you determine which one you are? Research.\n\nAs you will note if you re-read Black, some of the Lamontsare called McKercher. These are mainly west coast families.\n\nThe McKerchers who were Farquharsons (-quh- being the Scotsspelling of -ch- in 'loch') have lived in Glenlyon and Breadalbane (pronouncedBrad-aw-bin, rather than Breddlebin) in Perthshire for some 400 years, servingin various Campbell private armies and militias, so it would really be morelegitimate for a modern McKercher to wear Campbell tartan than Farquharson. (Iwear the Farquharson one anyway.)\n\nAs regards pronunciation, r + a consonant was considered ahard combination to pronounce in Gaelic, and r was always separated from ch bya neutral vowel 'uh'. Since everybody in the Highlands spoke like that, nobodysaw any reason to spell the 'uh' out until they no longer spoke Gaelic.\n\nMac means son in Gaelic, but again, until recently, it wasgenerally abbreviated to Mc. This did not indicate that the bearer was Irish orCatholic. Towards the beginning of the 20th century, many people began spellingMcKercher as MacKerrachar. The pronunciation was always 'MacKerrachar', andthose who kept the old spelling had to undergo the indignity of hearing itpronounced 'MicKertsher', until eventually they forgot how to say it rightthemselves. To compound the insult, many Lowland Scots, 95% of whom haven't theslightest knowledge of Gaelic, will tell you that the 'proper' way to pronouncethe name is 'MacKurker'. Feel free to tell them to 'blae it oot their luggies(ears).' Unless they outweigh you. I can say all this with some confidence,since I am a Gaelic teacher at the University of Ottawa, Canada.\n\nIf you're doing research on older records, note the manyspelling variations of McKercher. I can add McCarger, McKirryher (Connecticut),and McCarragher\n\n(Ireland) to Black's collection. More than one person hasmistaken the name for MacArthur, especially French-Canadian priests. Thatbecomes useful information when a male McKercher marries a French girl, becausethe women usually pick the minister and the children's religion. Sometimes aMcKercher disappears from the view of history on his wedding day! I have heardit said that General Douglas MacArthur was really a McKercher, but I've neverseen it verified.\n\nBest regards and congratulations on an interesting website.\n\nSincerely, Douglas McKercher\n\n(not the General) [email protected]\"\n\nThe following information is submitted for Donald McCallumand his search for relatives.
