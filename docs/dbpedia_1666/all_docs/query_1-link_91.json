Millions play shogi, the Japanese form of chess, and tens or maybe even hundreds of millions play xiangqi, the Chinese form. And then there is Korean chess, Thai, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Burmese, Persian, Indian and Batak chess and who knows what other regional variants. Sprigs from one tree, grown apart through the centuries, but still with unmistakable family resemblances. But much bigger is the number of chess variants that have been worked out by individual inventors. There are tens of thousands of these, maybe hundreds of thousands. Only a few are known by the ordinary chessplayer. In an Amsterdam chess café I used to play a game which we called “Can I?” and which is better known as Kriegspiel, where the players see only their own pieces and not the opponent’s. Alcoholic Chess, where the pieces are bottles that have to be drunk by the player who captures them, has little to offer intellectually and is only suitable for festive evenings. A quite different case is Progressive Chess, where white starts with one move, black replies with two, white plays three, black four and so on. It is not permitted to capture the king during a move. There exists an extended opening theory of this game. Databases with many games. A magazine that follows the latest developments. In this game the superiority of the Italians is as striking as\n\nfile:///C|/cafe/fromarchive/fromarchive.htm (1 of 4) [10/21/2004 11:19:22 AM]\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nthat of the Russians in our kind of chess. Of course, games tend to be short. An example: White Murphy-Black Fierek, Correspondence 1988 1.d4 2.d5, Nh6 (two Black moves) 3.Nc3, Nf3, Bxh6 4.Bg4, Bxf3, Bxe2, Bxd1? 5.Nb5, Bc4, Bb3, Ba4, Nxc7 mate. One can imagine that a forced win may be found in the initial position, and that will be the end of this game. Pity for Dutch GM Van der Wiel, who studied it extensively. These are relatively well known chess forms, but who is familiar with Bear Chess, Billiards Chess, Bombalot (our century gave us many chess variants in which a bomb, nuclear or other, destroys a whole area of the board), Brecht Schach (where in the revolutionary spirit of Bertolt Brecht the pieces gain or lose in power during play), or Blood-brother Chess? You can see that my knowledge is that of a slow autodidact who has finally arrived at the letter B of his reference work. The work in question is a book that appeared in 1994, The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, by D.B. Pritchard, published by Games & Puzzles Publications. The Bible of chess perversions. A monument of scholarship. Thousands of chess variants are described here. Many more had to be left out by the author because they were not important enough. Leafing through this book one realizes that the orthodox chessplayer occupies a small corner of an immense chess universe, inhabited by strange and unknown tribes. The bear, we learn, combines the powers of the knight and the squirrel. A surge of interest among the young in Bear Chess has been reported, especially in Central Russia. Billiards Chess, also known as Reflection Chess or Snooker Chess, is also popular. Of course different aberrations can be combined. AISE (Associazione Italiana SchacchiEterodossi) has organized tournaments for Billiards Progressive Chess or Billiards Loser-wins Chess. Try your wits on the following Billiards Chess problem:\n\nF.F.L. Alexander, 1932 White to move and mate in two The bishops can move as normal, but they can also be reflected like billiards balls on the edges of the board. E.g. the bishop on h6 can reach all the squares file:///C|/cafe/fromarchive/fromarchive.htm (2 of 4) [10/21/2004 11:19:22 AM]\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nof the diagonal a3-f8 in one move. In this problem reflection is only allowed once during a move. And now comes Robert Fischer, demonstrating his Fischerandom Chess, in which the pieces are shuffled randomly on the first rank. You may have guessed from the preceding that the idea is hardly new. There have been scores of proposals for all kinds of shuffle chess. The new ingredient of Fischer may be his provision that the king will always be in-between the rooks in the initial position, and the possibility for some kind of castling in all configurations. But for the rest he is firmly based in a tradition that is quite rich, if not very respectable. As an illustration, here is a game recorded in 1903 in Brighton. First we set up the pieces. The initial position was like this: White: Father Christmas Black: St. Nicholas Brighton 1903 1.e2-e4 e7-e5 2.f2-f4 e5xf4 3.g2-g3 f4xg3 4.Rf1xf7 Ke8xf7 5.Qd1-h5+ Nf8-g6 6.Re1f1+ Ng8-f6 7.e4-e5 d7-d6 8.e5xf6 g7xf6 9.Bh1-d5+ Bc8-e6 10.Rf1xf6+ Kf7xf6 11.b2-b3+ Ng6-e5 12.Qh5-h6+Kf6-f7 13.Qh6xe6+ Kf7-g7 14.Qe6-f7+ Kg7-h6 15.Qf7-f6+Ne5-g6 and here Father Christmas announced mate in two (by Nf3 or Nh3 followed by Qg5 mate) Brilliantly played by Father Christmas and St. Nicholas can be forgiven for not spotting the dangers in time in these unusual circumstances. Even a great player like Paul Keres has dabbled in shuffle chess, baseline chess, randomized chess, displacement chess or whatever you call it, though in a less extreme version. In 1935 he participated in a correspondence tournament in which the white king and queen changed places in the initial position. The black king and queen stayed on their normal squares. The tournament was won by one E. Arcsin from Budapest with 10 points from 11, and Hans Mueller (an IM in orthodox chess); Paul Keres shared second place with 9.5 points. Regrettably, Pritchard, who is my source for practically everything in this article, does not give a game by Keres.

The rooms are as spacious as they are distinguished, and with a degree of comfort befitting a society so prominent, both in character and composition, in our imperial capital. There are the large conversation and reading rooms, dining rooms for smokers and non-smokers, the ladies sitting room, the billiard room, likewise chess rooms (with sliding walls!), not to mention the sixteen huge playing rooms in addition to cloakrooms, kitchens and antechambers. All this takes up two whole stories, the entresol and the first floor of this magnificent building. The furnishings are sumptuous, but of a tastefully discreet restraint and all is a pleasure to behold. The loftiness of the rooms alone is enough to impress.” Ah, that was a chess club that deserved the name! In Cafe Central, that advertized itself as the cultural and intellectual centre of Vienna and the meeting place of the world’s chess champions, gathered the socially less prominent chessplayers and the artists. One of the chessplayers was the revolutionary Lev Trotzky, who played some games there almost daily\n\nfile:///C|/cafe/fromarchive/fromarchive.htm (1 of 5) [8/9/2005 1:13:45 AM]\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nbetween 1907 and 1914. Michael Ehn, the biographer of Ernst Grünfeld, relates the anecdote that when in 1917 news arrived of the Russian revolution, the Austrian minister of foreign affairs could not believe it and remarked: “Now come on, who is going to make a revolution there? Maybe Mr. Trotzky from Cafe Central?” It was about time to reanimate the great Viennese chess tradition. The Bank Austria Millennium Chess Festival celebrates the fact that a thousand years ago the name Ostaricchi was mentioned for the first time in an official document. This can hardly be called the Birth of a Nation, but if the birth of a word is enough reason to organize a chess festival, we can only applaud. And a magnificent festival it is. Eight Open tournaments of which the strongest one has the startling average Elo rating of more than 2500. The main event, a closed tournament of ten players, is one of the strongest of this year. As if the times of the Austrian-Hungarian double-monarchy had returned, the organisers invited three players from Budapest for the festive opening simuls, Almasi, Leko and the veteran Lilienthal. One can suppose that they had asked Lilienthal to bring his good friend and fellow-townsman Robert Fischer along with him to improve the festive mood, but such requests are notoriously difficult to fulfill. Anatoly Karpov is really a Man of Steel. Hardly had he finished his exhausting match for the world championship, when he went to Biel in Switzerland to win (first equal with the Israeli Milov) a strong tournament. Less than a week passed before we saw him in Vienna for an even stronger tournament with young lions like Kramnik, Topalov, Shirov, Gelfand and Judit Polgar, and his old rival Victor Korchnoi. TV chess host Helmut Pfleger asked Karpov what he would desire if a fairy granted him three wishes. Karpov answered that he would wish for nothing, because he wanted to succeed by his own accomplishments. The good fairy, moved by this proud answer, saw to it that Vladimir Kramnik arrived for his second round game against Karpov fifty minutes late. Kramnik lost that game. He had also lost in the first round against Shirov, a rare setback for the man who is seen by many as the crown prince of chess. Later he recovered. When Kramnik had successfully repulsed a wild attack of Korchnoi, Korchnoi angrily swept the pieces off the board, something which I had seen him doing against Karpov some years ago. A few moments later Kramnik and Korchnoi were peacefully analysing their game. For most of the tournament Karpov had been trailing the leaders by half a point, but in the final round he caught up by winning with black against Shirov. Karpov, Gelfand and Topalov shared first place with 5½ out of 9, Kramnik, Judit Polgar and Leko followed with 5 points. Karpov’s 140th tournament victory, a record that will never be equaled.

It had been some time since he had won one of these Grand Prix rapids; it had been some time since he had defeated Kasparov. “Now I can retire from chess,” Anand was quoted. One is reminded of Tartakower who apparently never showed such bliss as when he had won a lost game by a blunder of his opponent. Indeed, for every chessplayer it is just the normal state of affairs when he wins by his own merit, but winning completely undeservedly by plain luck reflects the benevolence of the gods. Anand had been lucky. In the final decisive blitz game he had been outplayed by Kasparov, who then, in a situation where almost every reasonable move would have been winning, made a blunder which cost him his queen. I doubt if Anand really felt such strong emotions after winning the tournament. Games quickly played are quickly forgotten. For the players, one of the attractions of a rapid tournament is the shallowness of the emotions involved. When you lose a game in a traditional tournament, you lose at least a night’s sleep. But then, at PCA events the players are contractually obliged to be economical with the truth. Kasparov was asked at a press conference if rapid chess could be a threat to traditional chess. Good question, now that the PCA\n\nfile:///C|/cafe/fromarchive/fromarchive.htm (1 of 5) [12/7/2005 11:53:09 AM]\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nhas completely dropped its infra-structure for the world championship but happily continues with the frivolous rapid events, which apparently are more attractive to its sponsors. No threat at all, said Kasparov. The real threat to long games, according to him, were the computers. One wonders why, but Kasparov never lets a chance pass by to emphasize the power and greatness of computers. Years ago, before he organized them, he fulminated against rapid chess events as the doom of real chess. His press conferences are not aimed at those with a memory span of more than one year. Such pedants would have raised an eyebrow when they heard at the same press conference that people like Karpov, Kamsky, Shirov and Salov are absent from these PCA events, not because their relations with Kasparov are not the best, but because they are not good enough in rapid chess. Pedants would remember that the only time when there were official FIDE rapid chess championships, it was Karpov who first became champion of Europe and then of the world. I always feel somewhat guilty when I show rapid games. The chess lover expects a nutritious meal and what he gets is fast food. But I have to admit, I myself always feel curious to see these games. Don’t take them too seriously. Think how they appear to the spectators on the spot. Pieces go by swiftly on big and bright computer screens. In the headphones commentators, like excited sports reporters, breathlessly stumble from one surprise to another. Quite attractive indeed. The cheerful attacking play of Judit Polgar is tailor-made for such events. In Geneva she first eliminated Epishin and then Bareev. In the semi-finals she met Kasparov, who proved too much for her. Polgar - Epishin, Game/25 1 e2-e4 c7-c6 2 d2-d4 d7-d5 3 Nb1-c3 d5xe4 4 Nc3xe4 Nb8-d7 5 Bf1-c4 Ng8f6 6 Ne4-g5 e7-e6 7 Qd1-e2 Nd7-b6 8 Bc4-b3 h7-h6 9 Ng5-f3 c6-c5 10 Bc1f4 Bf8-d6 11 Bf4-g3 Qd8-c7 12 d4xc5 Qc7xc5 13 0-0-0 Bd6xg3 14 h2xg3 Bc8d7 15 Rh1-h4 Ra8-c8 16 Nf3-e5 Bd7-b5 17 Qe2-e1 0-0 Judit Polgar did not think much of black’s last four moves and after the game she said that castling was the final and decisive mistake. Easily said, but it is difficult to indicate a good move for black at this stage. If castling is not satisfactory, he is in a bad state. 18 Ng1-f3 Nb6-d5 19 Kc1-b1 Bb5-c6 20 Qe1-d2 Rf8-e8 21 Rd1-h1 Qc5-f8 22 g3-g4 This plays itself. “One does not have such an easy game very often at this level,” Judit happily said after the game.

The final match was bitter for Kasparov. In the first game, having black, he strategically outplayed Anand. Work done, one thought, because it seemed unlikely that Kasparov would lose with white when a draw would be sufficient. But he did, mishandling an endgame which he could have drawn easily. So it was 1-1 and there had to be two blitz games (5 minutes each) to decide the winner. The first one was an exciting draw and then came the decisive gamelet.

He strives for a winning endgame, which could have been reached with 33 Nxe3. 33…Qe4xe3? But not this way. 34 Qe2xg4 Uh oh, horrible are the consequences of one moment’s inattentiveness.

In an old notebook I found the first game that I played against him, in 1959, when he was fifteen years old, I fourteen. My school beat his school 4-2, I proudly wrote at the time. Our game was a draw. I had added some pedantic notes which, as I see now, were not in complete accordance with the truth. Some more games between us are there, and in other notebooks which have disappeared somehow I must have written down dozens of our games, played in scholastic events, in the chess club for youngsters The Black Foal and in friendly training matches. There were years when I met Bert Enklaar almost every day. We attended the same lectures in mathematics, then went to the coffeehouse opposite the zoo where we talked about the sense and meaning of mathematics, literature and chess. According to my memory, conversations with him were often about sense and meaning, but it seems likely that most time was spent on down to earth subjects like the King’s Indian or the Fajarowicz variation of the Budapest gambit which he loved for many years with little recompense. After that we went to our lectures again or more often straight to the chess cafe on Leidseplein. Once or twice a week we met at our chess club. In 1963 both of us joined the Dutch team for the first time. We went to Birmingham for a match against England and at a London railway station we discovered that Kennedy\n\nfile:///C|/cafe/fromarchive/fromarchive.htm (1 of 4) [2/17/2006 11:38:45 PM]\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nhad been shot. Bert was gravely shocked and I found that strange. We made our debut in the Dutch Championship at the same time, in The Hague 1965, and we gained the same number of points. Some people had difficulties keeping us apart and it happened more than once that I talked to a chessplayer and after some time discovered that he thought I was Bert Enklaar. Suddenly he gave up chess, radically and apparently forever. He found chess too frivolous and harmful to the soul. He was a serious man, which however did not exclude a humorous tone of conversation, and I now remember an occasion where he, model of gentleness, grinningly called me “La vache qui rit,” the laughing cow, after a well-known brand of cheese spread. The remark seemed painfully to the point at the time, though I can’t remember why. He gave away all his chess books and to divide the loot his friends organized a blitz tournament which we called the Bert Enklaar Memorial. A few years later he was back in the chess world. We intended to return his chess books to him, whether or not we really did this, I am not quite sure. His period of absence had done him good. In 1972 he won the masters tournament in Wijk aan Zee tied with Ribli, with the wonderful score of 12 out of 15, two points ahead of the field. Again he played in the Dutch championship and in the magazine of the Dutch chess federation the reporter wrote about an “excellent first appearance,” having forgotten that Enklaar had already been there in 1965. He played in the Olympiad in Skopje 1972; next year he was the most succesful Dutch player in the grandmaster group in Wijk aan Zee, he was awarded the IM title and in the Dutch Championship of 1973 he shared first place with Sosonko and Zuidema. Sosonko won the play-off and became champion. Enklaar was a member of the Dutch team that gained a fine fifth place in the Olympiad of Nice 1974, and around that time he may have thought about becoming a professional chessplayer, but he did not make that fateful decision and became a teacher of mathematics instead. At the end of the seventies he started to withdraw from the chess world again, not radically this time, but gradually. He kept on playing chess, but no big tournaments anymore, only games for his club and small events which took one or two days. He said he liked to play chess, but not in the fanatical way of his past. He wanted to play for fun, so that he was in control of chess and not chess in control of him. There was a year that he only played draughts, quite fanatically according to Paul van der Sterren who knew him well, but draughts must have been less powerful and threatening. In his last few years, when he had been declared incurably ill, he took up chess as a passion again. He analysed openings, bought a computer with a database of games, and played wherever he could, in the internal competition of three different clubs and in tournaments in the Netherlands and abroad. His last tournament was the Lost Boys tournament in Antwerp, in August this year. A few days after that he started to compete in the Donner Memorial in Amsterdam, but the pain and exhaustion which he had unfailingly kept hidden to his opponents, had become such that he was forced to resign from the file:///C|/cafe/fromarchive/fromarchive.htm (2 of 4) [2/17/2006 11:38:45 PM]\n\nFrom the Archives\n\ntournament after one round.

Nobody has ever seen him. There are no photographs of him. He has an address in Geneva and he answers his mail, but intrepid seekers for biographical information get a curt reply that tells them that only matters of chess can be discussed. Because Winter has clearly shown for more than fifteen years that his heart is with the old masters, more than with modern chess, his image is that of a very old man, but this is denied by those to whom it has been imparted by word of mouth that he has been seen in the flesh as recent as the seventies, in the form of an English schoolboy, and that even the notation of a chess game of his has been preserved. In the English magazine \"Chess\" Winter is always referred to as The Omniscient. Winter is a just but stern supervisor of chess literature. Every chess writer in the English language knows: when he makes a mistake in a date, overlooks a mate in an analysis, or sins against the King's English, he will be flogged by Winter, whose eyes see everything. In 1982 Winter started the magazine \"Chess Notes,\" born from the realization that chess literature is a garbage bin of made-up anecdotes, conjectures that pose as facts and mistakes that are given eternal life by the laziness of thoughtless plagiarists. \"Chess Notes\" would be a forum for serious investigators. And that it was for eight years. Then suddenly Winter closed down his magazine because his correspondents had not been as arduous as he had wished. A few years later he continued his labours of purification on his own in a column that is published in several chess magazines. This year a collection of Winter's critical chess notes was published by Cardogan, London: \"Chess Explorations, A Pot-Pourri from the Journal Chess Notes.\" It is a rich album of games, brilliant, edifying or at least curious, chess trivia, scourging book reviews and deep investigations. \"What song the Sirens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzzling questions, are not beyond all conjecture.\" Those words of Thomas Browne could have been the motto for this book, were it not that the word conjecture is anathema to Winter. An example how things went in the good days when the magazine \"Chess Notes\" was with us: Winter spots in the Yugoslav magazine \"Sahovski Glasnik\" a story about a match that Capablanca was supposed to have played in 1922 against the German billiards champion Erich Hagenlocher. In chess\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans05.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:55 PM]\n\nCapablanca gave odds of a rook, in billiards he got odds of 75 points, out of 100 to make. Result 1-1, both players won their own game. Winter tells the story in his magazine. This was 1983. During the next years several articles are devoted to this subject. Reader's letters are published which make it clear that the whole story is a hoax. We come to know who originated this story, when and where. Who really played the supposed Capablanca game. The details of the career of the German billiards champion, whose name turns out to be Hagenlacher. In 1989, six years after his first report, Winter can write: \"Slowly but surely all the key facts about this matter now seem to have come out.\" Case closed, or almost. Sometimes, to our surprise, a classical chess anecdote turns out to be true: the match between the university of Cambridge and the madhouse of Bedlam really was won by Bedlam. Winter gives the details and we do not doubt anymore. No sin is insignificant to Winter, a printing error lets him grip his whip. But often his corrections are important. Reuben Fine has written that Bogolyubov, the Russian that lived in Germany, had some of his colleagues sent to concentration camps when the Nazis came to power. A casual remark, without any corroboration. Winter shows that this terrible accusation is indeed without any foundation. And then the small errors and examples of carelessness of Fine that Winter earlier indicated, are seen in a different light. When Fine is so careless in matters of chess technique, he may have been careless when he defamed Bogolyubov. Nobody is spared, but one man is singled out for Winter's attacks: English GM Raymond Keene. Keene as an organiser, a chess politician, a journalist, a chess writer. Found defective in all respects. Careless mistakes, outright lies, by the dozen, by the hundred, according to Winter. Says Keene one year exactly the opposite of what he has said a few years before, blissfully thinking that no reader will remember, Winter proves him wrong. Alas, probably Winter is right. He has been called a pedant, humourless often, but seldom or maybe never he has been proved to be wrong. And now and then it seems to me that his sense of humour may be healthier than is commonly acknowledged. In his book he gives the following diagram. White: Kf2, Ne3 Black: Kh2, Ps:f4, g5, h3 Now followed 1 Ng4+ Kh1 2 Kf1 f3 3 Kf2 h2 4 Kf1 f2 5 Nxf2 mate. It is a standard manoevre, seen in many endgame books. Why is this diagram with its trivial sequel thought worthy of inclusion in his book? The moves are the final part of a game Janowsky-Keene, New York 1917. Quite another Keene, a certain Lester Keene. But Winter must have relished the opportunity to write: \"The consternation of Keene can well be imagined when Janowsky forced a checkmate in five moves.\" By far not all Winter's chess notes are meant polemically. He is a file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans05.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:55 PM]\n\ntrue chess lover and much of his material is there only for it's beauty. Like the next game. Both players thought this the best game they had ever played. Winter quotes a saying about spectacular moves that look like typographical errors and of course he uses the opportunity to enquire who was the originator of this saying. As so often, he had to supply the answer himself, in a later issue of \"Chess Notes:\" it was Napier, mainly known from Lasker-Napier.

Indeed. Gary Kasparov, Anatoli Karpov, Vasily Ivanchuk, Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik. The cream of the chess world. Gata Kamsky should be among them, but after his candidates match last year against Anand they do not want to see him here anymore. In some places where the hoofprint of father Rustam Kamsky has been, there are no chess events at all afterwards. Fortunately for the organisers Kamsky dropped to seventh place on the interim FIDE list, so that they can still say that they have the six best players of the world. The strongest tournament in history, as they claim, it may be not, but anyway it fills a painful gap. Now that there is no structured cycle for the world championship, this tournament gives us a chance to see who is best. \"Who wins this tournament can call himself the world's best player for the moment,\" said Kasparov before it began, a sign that he took it very seriously. He arrived here a week early and Karpov has been in the seaside resort Maspalomas, on the other end of the island Gran Canaria, for two weeks. All the players took seconds with them, some of them a whole team of helpers. Kasparov was the only one who won in the first round. A bit lucky maybe, Topalov could have drawn, but on the other hand Kasparov did wonders with his small advantage in the rook ending, while Topalov underestimated the dangers. Ivanchuk had prepared well for his encounter with Karpov. At the opening ceremony the day before, as soon as he had received his drawing number he ran away, so that in the photographs there are only five players instead of six. He did not wait for the car with driver that the organisers had put at his disposal, but jumped into the first taxi he saw. \"To the hotel!\" he exclaimed. Which hotel? the driver asked. But the name or location Ivanchuk did not know. At least, such is the story as told to me by the head of Anand's delegation. It reminds one of Akiba Rubinstein, about whom it has been told that once he arrived in The Hague by train, boarded the first streetcar he saw and said to the driver: \"Bring me to my friend Oskam.\" Ivanchuk almost won, even though he was black. Kramnik had to thread carefully through a minefield after Anand had sprung a novelty on him in a sharp Sicilian. When Kramnik had not exploded after twenty moves, a draw was agreed. When the four other players had already long gone, Kasparov and Karpov were still seen together on the stage. A spy told me that\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nKarpov explained that Kasparov should never have won his game, and that Kasparov made it clear that Karpov should have lost, or at least suffered longer. They maybe rivals, enemies sometimes, but they are bound together like Siamese twins. Diagram: White: Kh1, Rc1, Re1; pawns: a4, b2, d5, h2 Black: Kh8, Rb8, Rf4, Nd6; pawns: a5, c4, e4, h7 White: Topalov Black: Kasparov. Here white could make a draw by 38 Nb5 Nxb5 39 axb5 Rxb5 40 Rxc4, though he will be a pawn behind. Topalov afterwards said that he wanted more, but as he can hardly have hoped for a win here, it probably meant that he wanted a draw with equal material. He did not realize the dangers in the position. Played was: 38 Re1-e2 Kh8-g7 39 Rc1-e1 Rb8-b4 Defending his pawn e4.

Second Round Three draws. Now and also on later days the Canarian journalists were complaining about the high percentage of draws. The players comments were to the effect that even God cannot win a drawn position against a supergrandmaster. The most interesting game was Kramnik-Topalov, a heroic fight. Kramnik got an overwhelming position after the opening, a King's Indian, but only gained a miserable pawn . Still he had good winning chances. After sixty moves the instrument that they call here the \"guillotine\" came into effect: the players get an extra half hour for the rest of the game. At move eighty, with two minutes left, Kramnik gave up his winning attempts. But even in the late endgame the computer Fritz had spotted a win for him, and I think the thing is right. Diagram: White: Kf4, Re5, Ne4, Bg5; pawns: f3, h4 Black: Kf8, Re2, Nd4, Bg2; pawn: g6 White: Kramnik Black: Topalov. Here, after more then six hours of play, white missed his last chance. Strong would have been 66 Bh6+ Kf7 (after 66...Kg8 67 Re7 black is in a mating net) 67 Rd5. Now both 68 Rxd4 and 68 Rd7+ are threatened, so forced is 67...Ne6+ 68 Kg3 and now again mate is threatened and also the win of a piece by 69 Nf2 Bf1 70 Rd1. Black is forced to sacrifice an exchange with 68...Rxe4 69 fxe4 Bxe4 but in the long run this will not help him. Kramnik however played 66 Bg5-e7+ instead of 66 Bh6+ and fourteen moves later a draw was agreed.\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nThird Round Kasparov and Kramnik gave a draw in a position rich in possibilities after 19 moves. Topalov-Karpov agreed to a draw after 27 moves, which was quite justified by the position, but earlier in the game Topalov had had a strong bind. Anand won a fine game against Ivanchuk, sacrificing an exchange right after the opening. The consequences could not be calculated, but Anand followed the iron logic often invoked by Euwe: I have white, I made no mistake, so I should have some advantage. If I do not sacrifice there is no advantage at all, so sacrifice I must, come what may.

Fourth Round The highlight of the round was the game between the two leaders, Kasparov-Anand, which Kasparov should have won. After 63 moves of trouble Anand saved a draw. Kramnik and Karpov did no harm to each other and Topalov showed again that he is not himself in this tournament. He almost mated Ivanchuk, who could just save himself n an endgame, but even then Ivanchuk was convinced that he was losing, as he told the press afterwards. Great was his surprise when he was allowed dangerous counterplay, greater still his happiness when he met hardly any resistance and won quickly.

This is only good when a mate can follow, but there won't.

Fifth round After almost three years of waiting finally another Karpov-Kasparov game. Their last one was in 1994 in Linares, when Karpov reigned supreme. Their long awaited game turned out a disappointment. There had been two consecutive rest days, to give Karpov the opportunity to go to Paris and come back in time. Long before Karpov had agreed to play in Las Palmas, he had signed a contract with Paris Disneyland to appear there at a chess event for children, something he could not cancel. Back from a tiring trip, Karpov appeared not in the mood to play a sharp game. Right from the opening he seemed to be playing for a draw and as he had white, nobody doubted that he would get one. A boring game, but still they thought long and got into terrible time trouble. For the players their own game is never boring, only the spectators think so. And a day later it was found out that in the last three minutes of the game exciting things had happened. Maybe a missed win for Karpov. Then a missed win for Kasparov in a pawn ending. Not so boring at all, but nobody had noticed it at the time. Kramnik was crushed by Ivanchuk. For this tournament Kramnik has taken up a new opening as black, the King's Indian. It certainly still needs some polishing. After his earlier game with Kasparov, Kramnik said that he had not played the King's Indian for ten years, so his experience dates from the time he was eleven years old. Anand-Topalov was an uneventful draw. The highlight of the day was the press conference that Ilyumzhinov gave. The Executive Council of FIDE had had two days of discussions in Las Palmas, invited there because the Canarians want to have the Kasparov-Karpov match in 1997. Ilyumzhinov announced that his knock-out World Championship tournament would be held in Elista, December 1997 till January 1998. Five million dollar prize fund, guaranteed by the Kalmykian government. And what about Kasparov-Karpov, what kind of world championship was that then? Ilyumzhinov replied that in their provisional agreement Kasparov and Karpov had not mentioned FIDE at all, so it was none of his file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nbusiness. FIDE would go its own way. The Canarian chess organisers turned white. Suddenly it appeared that their cherished match would have no official status at all. And then came something really weird. Ilyumzhinov announced that an independent chess state would be founded on the territory of Kalmykia in 1998, during the olympiad. With its own government, parliament and laws. And, most important it seems to me, its own tax system. In 1998 the king of independent Chessland would be elected by the players in the olympiad, but everyone who was present at the conference was also invited to take part in the election. The words of comrade Stalin came to mind: it is not important who is voting, important is who is counting. When we staggered outside the room, a Kalmykian was waiting for us, distributing booklets with drawings and photos of scale models of the splendid chess palaces that would be built in the kingdom of chess. After studying the booklet it became clear that Iljumzhinov wants to make what he calls \"an offshore economic zone,\" a tax heaven for bankers and international investors, under the flag of FIDE. We are in strange company nowadays.

Without anyone noticing, white has gotten an advantage. 30...Rc6-c2+ Diagram 31 Rd1-d2 \"31 Kd3 was tempting,\" said Karpov during the post mortem. Indeed it would have been mighty strong. Kasparov intended to play 31 Rh2 and he certainly would not have had time to change plans. After 32 Bb4+ Kd8 33 Ng5 white's advantage would have been huge. And also after 31 Rb2 32 Bb4+ Kd8 33 Nd2 or 31 Rc7 32 Bb4+ Nc5+ 33 Ke2 black would be in big trouble. 31...Rc2xd2+ 32 Be1xd2 A drawn position again although nobody had noticed that things had temporarily changed. 32...Bb6-c5 33 Ne4xc5 Nd7xc5 34 Bd2-b4 Ke7-d6 35 Ke2-d2 a6-a5 36 Bb4xc5+ Kd6xc5 37 Kd2-d3 f7-f6 38 h3-h4 But this is very uncautious.

Black returns the compliment. It seems that Kasparov himself made it known the next day that he could have won with 40...e5. An important difference with the game is seen in the variation 41 e4+ Kd6 42 Ke3 Ke6 43 fxe5 fxe5 44 Kf2 Kf6. Now after 45 Kg2 follows 45...h5 and 46...g5 and black wins, while file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nafter 45 Kg3 comes 45...h6, the move which in reality he squandered on his 40th, and white is in zugzwang. 41 e3-e4+ Kd5-d6 42 Kd3-e3 e6-e5 43 f4xe5 f6xe5 44 Ke3-f2 Kd6-e6 45 Kf2-g2 Circumspection is still needed 45 Kg3 would lose. But now there is nothing to do for black; draw agreed. Play out a boring game to the end and funny things can happen; Fischer knew it. Sixth Round Anand, who had shared the lead with Kasparov, fell back losing to Kramnik. Topalov, who had seemed badly out of form during the first part of the tournament, has regained his strength and easily held a position against Kasparov that seemed very difficult for him, with the totally wrecked pawn structure that is typical for the Scotch when Kasparov plays the white side. Ivanchuk forced an early draw against Karpov. Perpetual check after fifteen moves.

And it is, for after 16...exd5 17 exd5 Nxd5 18 Rd3 the complications turn out favourably for white. 16...e6xd5 17 e4xd5 Bb4-d6 18 Ne5-c6 Bb7xc6 19 Bf4xd6 Bc6-a4 19...Qxd6 20 dxc6 would be very unpleasant for black, but maybe the lesser evil.

Seventh round A fantastic round. All three games decided, Anand producing a work of art against Karpov, who had it coming to him, because he spent a lot of time on an extremely dubious opening: 54 minutes on the first nine moves. Anand got a clear advantage and Karpov was forced to shed a pawn. What Anand did then, few players would have done in his place. Taking the pawn would have given him reasonable winning chances with absolutely no risk. He sacrificed a piece, Bxh7+, which usually is trivial, but here it was extremely unclear In one variation a second piece would have to be sacrificed, a third even. Few people thought it was correct, computer Fritz 4 thought it was absolute nonsense. file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nA day later Anand said after long analysis that he would not have been in danger and would have winning chances in an unclear position, even if Karpov had played the best defence. But Karpov didn't and he could not have done it in the ten or so minutes he had left after Anand's sacrifice. It was a joy to see Anand's play. A quiet move with a pawn, followed by an unexpected queen switch across the whole board. This is Tal, someone said. This is Anand, I thought. Karpov overstepped the time in a hopeless position on the 36th move. The important game between the leaders, Kasparov-Ivanchuk, was hardly noticed, though this also was a fine attacking game, but less spectacular and with no sacrifices. Like Karpov, Ivanchuk overstepped in a lost position on move 36. Topalov won a good positional game against Kramnik, who tried the King's Indian again, to his regret. White: Anand Black: Karpov 1 Ng1-f3 d7-d5 2 d2-d4 e7-e6 3 c2-c4 d5xc4 4 e2-e4 b7-b5 This risky variation is out of character for Karpov. 5 a2-a4 c7-c6 6 a4xb5 c6xb5 7 b2-b3 Bc8-b7 8 b3xc4 Bb7xe4 9 c4xb5 Ng8-f6 10 Bf1-e2 Bf8-e7 11 0-0 0-0 12 Nb1-c3 Be4-b7 13 Nf3-e5 a7-a6 14 Be2-f3 Karpov's experiment is no success; it is very difficult for him to develop his queenside. 14...Nf6-d5 15 Nc3xd5 e6xd5 16 Ra1-b1 Qd8-b6 17 Bf3-e2 a6xb5 18 Rb1xb5 Qb6-c7 19 Bc1-f4 Be7-d6 20 Be2-d3 Bb7-a6 He has to give a pawn, otherwise he would lose quickly. 21 Bd3xh7+ But Anand doesn't want a pawn, he wants to sacrifice and give mate. 21...Kg8xh7 22 Qd1-h5+ Kh7-g8 23 Rb5-b3 Diagram 23...Bd6xe5 Not good. After 23...Bc8 Anand would play 24 Rg3 Qe7 25 Bg5 with advantage. The crucial line is 23...f6 24 Rh3 (the second piece) fxe5 25 dxe5 and now 25...Rxf4 (the third piece) 26 e6 is winning for white, but 25..Qc4 keeps it very unclear according to Anand, who thought 26 Re1 would be the best way to play for a win. I got this from a Dutch chess journalist who visited Anand in his hotel and was completely dazzled by the stream of fantastically complicated variations Anand showed. 24 Rb3-h3 f7-f6 25 d4xe5 Qc7-e7 26 Qh5-h7+ Kg8-f7 27 Rh3-g3 Kf7-e8 27...Rg8 loses after 28 Qg6+ Kf8 29 exf6.

Eighth round Not much to say about this one. Three boring draws. Kasparov seemed in trouble against Kramnik, but he just managed to save himself in a rook ending a pawn down. A clear theoretical draw, but Kramnik played on for 30 more moves, though he could hardly hope to win this against the world champion. Topalov played a novelty which took the dangers out of a variation of the Benoni which up to now had given Karpov and others a lot of wins. Interesting for theory buffs, but not for the spectators, who had to look at an totally drawn position. Karpov did wonders with it, reached a queen ending a pawn up, but, pity for him, even this file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nwas easily drawn by Topalov.

But now they agreed to a draw. Ninth round Kasparov-Karpov again, their 165th game, and today it was an exciting one. Remarkable how often the outcome of their games is decided in the last few minutes. Remember Sevilla 1987, last game. Twenty seconds before the first time control Karpov was virtually World Champion. Then he made a blunder which spoiled everything. Today everything was normal for a long while. Chances for both sides, Kasparov having the two bishops, Karpov a better pawn structure. Then in mutual time trouble Karpov collapsed. A day later some very promising possibilities were found for him. Kasparov said afterwards that immediately after the game he had phoned his mother and said it had been an awful game. Topalov-Anand was a draw which could have been played on for a while, and Kramnik won a good technical game against Ivanchuk, who played on for much too long. Kramnik reacted jestfully by postponing an inevitable pawn promotion for several moves. So before the last round Kasparov was a full point up. But if Anand were to beat him, they would not share first place, nor the prize money. Anand would be first, because he would have beaten Kasparov 1« -«.

After 31 Qxb2 Rxb2 32 Bxc5 Rb5 black is much better, maybe winning, because of the unfortunate position of white's bishops. Then 33 Rc1 Nd7 34 Bd6 does not quite win a piece for black, but it is very good for him, as is 33 Bxf8 Kxf8. White has other possibilities, but none very good After 31 Qd8 (instead of exchanging queens) black plays 31...Bb5, staying a very healthy pawn up. 31 Qd2-d8 Be8-c6 Here 31...c4 seems nice for black. 32 Bf2-g3 Rb7-d7 And here 32...c4 again.

So Gary Kasparov did it again, showing the crown princes and his eternal rival Karpov that there is still a difference between him and the rest of the world. His score, he said, was better than he had expected (\"I expected to share first place with Anand\") but his play was not. \"Everyone played under strength here, many mistakes were made, because of the extreme tension caused by playing a world class player everyday.\" Once he was in trouble after the opening (with black against Kramnik), his games with Karpov could have gone all different ways, but on the other hand he should have won the first game against Anand and anyway, being a full point up to the nearest rival is something against which there is no argument. Anand tried to beat him today in a long theoretical variation. Not much chance against the king of opening preparation. Kasparov held the draw cleanly and easily. Karpov played a sharp and lively game against Kramnik, who seemed to be lost at the final stage, but somehow managed a perpetual check. Ivanchuk in full battle overlooked a simple check and mate by Topalov, and after the game Ivanchuk said at the press conference that the tension of this supertournament had been so terrible, that he considered canceling some obligations in the near future. Very bad news for the Dutch organisers of Wijk aan Zee, who still expect him there and need him very much for their tournament. Karpov and Ivanchuk shared last place on points, but file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans06.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\naccording to the tie- break system Karpov officially was last, a fate without precedent in his long and glorious career. And now for the future. Kasparov spoke at a press conference about his coming match against Karpov. His position was clear and uncompromising. Essentially it came to this: \"With 100% certainty there will be a match between me and Karpov, starting in September 1997. But any talk of it being a so called reunification match is completely groundless. There is nothing to unify, because there is only one World Champion, me, Kasparov. The match will be for the World Championship, me being the champion and Karpov the challenger. If I win, I promise to defend my title in another title match starting not later than September 1999. If FIDE wants to organize its own events, let them do so, but the chess world will recognize that they will have nothing to do with a real world championship. The title is owned by the World Champion, not by an organization which has lost legitimacy. I stand at the end of a line which started with Steinitz in 1886, and this will be so until I am defeated in a match. With FIDE I will have absolutely nothing to do, and what they say and do is irrelevant.\" Clearly the organisers in Gran Canaria, who have been bidding for the Kasparov-Karpov match, had been thinking that they were preparing a match under the auspices of FIDE, but privately Kasparov was very clear about this too: \"If they think that, there will be no match here.\" White: Anand Black: Kasparov 1 e2-e4 c7-c5 2 Ng1-f3 d7-d6 3 d2-d4 c5xd4 4 Nf3xd4 Ng8-f6 5 Nb1-c3 a7-a6 6 Bf2-e2 e7-e6 7 0-0 Bf8-e7 8 a2-a4 Nb8-c6 9 Bc1-e3 0-0 10 f2-f4 Qd8-c7 11 Kg1-h1 Rf8-e8 12 Be2-f3 Ra8-b8 13 g2-g4 Nc6xd4 14 Be3xd4 e6-e5 15 f4xe5 d6xe5 16 Bd4-a7 Rb8-a8 17 g4-g5 Re8-d8 18 Qd1-e2 Nf6-e8 19 Ba7-e3 Bc8-e6 20 Qe2-f2 All played in a quarter of an hour.

Diemer was born in 1908 in the German town Radolfzell, in Baden. Already at a young age he was a passionate chessplayer, but it was not until 1932 that he had a game published. Until 1956 his greatest success was a first place in the blitz championship of Baden. In his best period he could be considered a mediocre master. Very strong Diemer certainly was not. Nevertheless, in the fifties and sixties he had a flock of disciples in Germany and also in the Netherlands. He was the prophet of relentless aggression in chess. \"Play the Blackmar- Diemer gambit and mate will come by itself!\" he wrote. \"The Blackmar gambit changes the whole man!\" In this he was completely serious. In 1996 the German Manfred M„dler Verlag published a biography of Diemer, written by one of his most faithful followers, Georg Studier: \"Emil Joseph Diemer. Ein Leben fr das Schach im Spiegel der Zeiten.\" (A life for chess in the mirror of time) The biography has 280 pages. Some world champions are still waiting for such homage. Studier has great admiration and sympathy for Diemer. He calls him a man of unusual genius. Diemer's simul tours are described as triumphal processions. Still the book has not become a hagiography, because there was too much in Diemer's life which is repulsive and which Studier couldn't and wouldn't suppress. In 1931 Diemer was out of work. He had been fired from a small job at a publisher's house. He was not fit for a job. Like many other malcontents he became a member of the NSDAP, the German Nazi party, and was thrown out of the house by his father the same day. Diemer was never well able to take care of himself, but as a Nazi it was easier than before. Not that he had become a party member out of opportunism. He was a fanatic, in everything he did. He was a relentless agitator for the party in the years that the Nazi's romantically called the \"Kampfzeit,\" the years of struggle before they took power. Diemer made new friends and now it was possible for him to become a professional chessplayer. He became the \"chess reporter of the Great German Reich,\" was present at all important international chess events and sang the praise of \"Kampfschach,\" chess as a struggle, in the Nazi newspapers and magazines. He did not earn much money and even then he was dependent, as he would be till the end of his life, on admirers to support him in his penury. After the war it became more difficult. Diemer wrote in countless little magazines and papers, sold chess books, gave simuls, but\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans07.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\noften he was hungry. He was simply not strong enough to be a chess professional. And in 1953 he lost an important part of his small income because he was expelled from the German chess federation. In a rabid press campaign Diemer had accused officials of the federation of homosexuality and corruption of innocent youth. For Diemer, who later told his biographer Studier that he had never physically loved a woman, homosexuality was a great and threatening evil. He did not only abstain from love but also from drinking and smoking. He played chess. Success he had not, but there were disciples who wrote passionate polemics about the merits of the Blackmar-Diemer gambit, 1. d4 d5 2. e4 dxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3. For one year, from 1955 till 1956, Diemer published his own magazine, \"Blackmar-Gemeinde\" (Blackmar-Community), that he had to close down when his creditors became too impatient. Everyone of importance in the chess world was bombarded by Diemer with letters that contained endless analyses of his gambit. He found recognition, even in the Netherlands, where the company Ten Have published Diemer's German-language book \"Vom ersten Zug an auf Matt\" (From the first move going for mate). It was in the Netherlands that Diemer in 1956 finally became successful in chess. He won the Reserves Group of the Hoogovens tournament and later the Open Championship of the Netherlands. In the same year he played in the Swiss Championship (after being banned from the German federation he had become a member of a Swiss club) and shared second place. These successes were not to be repeated. After a disappointing tournament in England, Diemer discovered in a German women's magazine the cause of his bad score. Biorhythm. After that his chess friends were bombarded with biorhythmical calculations and graphs. Furthermore, Diemer discovered Nostradamus, the famous 16th century French clairvoyant. In a period of 25 years he sent about ten thousand letters on Nostradamus. They contained calculations hard to follow for the outsider. By means of a simple system, a=1, b=2 etc, he had cracked the code of the great clairvoyant. Even well- meaning friends found it strange that the code would be hidden in the German translation, instead of the original French text. Nostradamus was to dominate Diemer's life, even more so then chess. On the streets he accosted unsuspecting pedestrians. He disturbed a funeral by shouting: \"A living one is buried here!\" He lamented that the river Rhine would run dry and that nuclear bombs would fall on Heidelberg. The authorities of town and province loathed the ringing of the phone, in fear that it might be Diemer, announcing the apocalypse. In 1965 he was committed to a psychiatric clinic. The director found that chess was too much of a strain for Diemer's nerves and he was not permitted to play anymore. But six years later a miracle happened. In 1971 a young admirer brought about the cancellation file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans07.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:56 PM]\n\nof both the clinic's interdiction and the expulsion from the German chess federation. Diemer could become a member of a German chess club again and his young admirer had seen to it that he got first board on the team. Diemer was given the new dentures that had been promised to him in 1952 by a rich admirer. He was playing again and his board was always surrounded by young disciples who were delighted by his attacking style. His strength in chess had suffered, but he did not mind. One day he might become the best player in the world, he said, but more important to him was the Nobel Prize that he expected for his investigations on Nostradamus' works. He died in 1990. He had not played chess during his last five years. In Fussbach, the site of his clinic, the villagers had seen him stumbling through the streets, tall and thin, with prophet's beard and half-blind, and they had respected Diemer, because they had heard by rumor that this man once had been a great chessplayer, maybe the greatest of all. That he was certainly not, but a remarkable player he was, with his glaring one-sidedness, always looking for the attack and for nothing else. Here is Diemer's last tournament game, played in 1984. Studier gives it in his book \"without distracting commentary\" and he is right to do so, because one should not clinically dissect an amazing game like this.

Rumors of bad quarrels with the municipality, which had taken over the tournament. Rentero struck back by organizing a new tournament in Ubeda, 30 kilometers from Linares, in the same period. The Spanish journalist Leontxo Garcia explained during the supertournament in Las Palmas how things would develop in the next few years. Gradually Rentero would buy the best players away from Linares into his own tournament and the municipality of Linares would be left with a second rate tournament. Maybe this was what the municipality had feared. Anyway, at the opening ceremony of the Linares tournament there was a heart-warming show of reconciliation. A spokesman of the municipality said that a Linares tournament without Rentero would be like a skiing holiday without snow. Rentero had no official function this year, but from the start he reigned with the heavy hand that the chessworld knows of him, with thundering speeches and threatening letters. He published an open letter to Karpov which must be one of the most insulting that the FIDE world champion has ever received. Karpov did not play in Linares and, according to Rentero, had not answered the faxes in which he had been invited. On behalf of the children of Linares, who supposedly were deeply shocked by the behavior of their idol Karpov, Rentero called Karpov a coward who had no right to call himself world champion, in fact had never deserved to call himself such, after he had ducked Fischer as he ducked Kasparov now. Rentero ended his letter by saying that Karpov had joined the list of BAD PERSONS who would never be invited to Linares again. Gelfand and Kramnik, who did come to Linares, maybe regretted it when they were severely reprimanded after playing a short draw in the first round. Well, probably they did not. Everybody knows the antics of the bully with the heart of gold, the players take it as a part of Linares folklore and always come back the next year. But all in all it seems that Rentero is playing this bully role in a more and more extreme way. His threats against Xie Jun and Zsuzsa Polgar, when they played for the world championship in Jaen under Rentero's auspices, were completely unacceptable and this time Karpov is rightly angry and has asked for an apology before he will ever go back to Linares. Karpov had a good reason not to play. He was campaigning in Tula for the seat in the Duma, the Russian parliament that had become vacant when general Alexander Lebed joined the Russian government. Karpov's main rival was another general, Alexander\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans08.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:57 PM]\n\nKorzhakov, former head of the security services of Yeltsin and now aligned with Lebed, who probably still has some influence in Tula. In fact Korzhakov won the election. Karpov was third out of eleven contenders. Earlier, Korzhakov's leader Alexander Lebed was quoted as saying that Kasparov would play an important role in formulating the strategy and programme of his party. It was not the first time Karpov and Kasparov found themselves in opposing camps. When the Dutchman Jeroen Piket left for Linares he thought he was replacing Ivanchuk but in fact he was replacing for Karpov. Ivanchuk had said yes, no, yes and no again but finally Rentero caught him. If there was one player who regretted his coming it must have been Ivanchuk during the first half of the tournament. \"I am like a wounded lion here - everyone is hunting me,\" he said to the journalist Bjelica. The game Ivanchuk lost with white in 19 moves to Judit Polgar was really horrible. But later in the tournament he regained his strength and he was the only one who defeated Kasparov. \"One day he plays like an 1800 player, next day he plays like Ivanchuk,\" Kasparov said. Expletives deleted according to Mark Crowther, who quoted Kasparov in The Week in Chess. Kasparov went on to a formidable score of 8.5 points out of 11, beating the numbers 2,3,4,5 and 6 of the final ranking. No doubt at this moment who is boss in the chess world. White: Anand Black: Kasparov 1. e2-e4 c7-c5 2. Ng1-f3 d7-d6 3. d2-d4 c5xd4 4. Nf3xd4 Ng8-f6 5. Nb1-c3 a7-a6 6.

From Linares there were reports that white could have obtained a clear advantage with 31. Nf5. I must confess that I don't see it. After 31...Bf8 white cannot strike at once with 32. Nxd6 Bxd6 33. fxe5 Bxe5 34. Bxe5 Rcxe5 35. Rxf6. Then 35...Rxe4 36. Rxg6+ would indeed be good for white, but after 35...Qb7 black would have nothing to fear. Interesting after 31...Bf8 would be 32. Nh4, e.g. 32...Qc6 33. fxe5 dxe5 34. Nxg6 Bg7 (34...hxg6 35. Qxg6+ Bg7 36. Rxf6 Qxf6 37. Qxe8+) 35. Nh4 Qxe4 36. Qxe4 Nxe4 37. Nf5 and it is still to been seen if white's advantage is worth much. Another defence for black after 31. Nf5 would be 31...Qc6. Anyway Anand would not have lost had he played this way. 31. f4-f5 g6-g5 But now black takes over the initiative on the king's wing. 32.

His death was mentioned in most chess magazines, but I did not see big articles which commemorated his career. Still, there was a time that Eliskases was considered a world champion candidate. For instance by Alekhine, in 1941. Alekhine wrote that a match against Capablanca was not opportune anymore, because Capablanca was past his best days. It would be better for the chessworld, according to Alekhine, if younger players like Keres or Eliskases got a chance. He praised the universal style of Eliskases. But this was in the notorious series of anti-semitic articles in which Alekhine exulted the Aryan attacking style. It was useful for his political purposes to praise the Austrian Eliskases, who after Austria's Anschluss in 1938 was the strongest player of Great-Germany. The Jewish players Botvinnik, Fine, Reshevsky and maybe Flohr could have been called world champion candidates with better reason. And moreover Eliskases was hardly a paragon of the romantic attacking style that Alekhine rejoiced in. But objective truth played no role in these articles. Eliskases was strong, that 's for sure. He had won matches against Spielmann and Bogolyubov. His best tournament victory was in Noordwijk 1938, ahead of Euwe and Keres. It was the first of eight consecutive tournaments in which he did not lose a single game. Alekhine could not know in 1941 that the period in which Eliskases played against the world's best had already passed. In 1939 World War II broke out during the chess olympiad in Buenos Aires. Eliskases played on first board for Germany, the team that won that olympiad. When the olympiad was finished, the five German players stayed in Argentine. Not because of unease with the politics of Hitler. The Austrian captain of the Great-German team Albert Becker had clearly shown his pro-nazi attitude in 1938 at the time of the Anschluss. In a recent interview in the Dutch magazine Schaaknieuws A.D. de Groot, author of Thought and Choice in Chess and member of the Dutch team in 1939, said that the German player Michel was the only member of his team that was not pro-nazi and that he was pestered by his teammates because of that. From Argentina Becker sent a letter to the Austrian chessworld in which he excused the desertion of the team by explaining that the return trip to Europe was too dangerous for Germans while England ruled the seas. Maybe this was true. Or maybe the patriotism of the chessplayers did not amount to a willingness to personally contribute to the war effort. Eliskases was 26 years old at the time, a good age for cannon fodder. It was not easy to be a professional chessplayer in Argentina\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans09.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:57 PM]\n\nduring the war. Many strong players had stayed there after the olympiad and international chess life had come to a stop. In 1943 Eliskases settled in Brazil, first as a teacher of bridge, later as a chess trainer of the club of a German firm. In 1951 he was invited by a group of chessplayers in the Argentine city of C¢rdoba to become a chess trainer there. His greatest success in South-America was his victory in Mar del Plata in 1948, ahead of Stahlberg and Najdorf, two other Europeans who had stayed behind in Buenos Aires in 1939. In 1964 Eliskases was still strong enough to play on first board for the Argentine team in the olympiad in Tel Aviv. He played well, five wins and only two losses in nineteen games, against strong opposition. But by then his career as a world top player was of a distant past. It had been finished by the war, in 1939. Diagram: White: Kc1, Rf7; pawns - a6, b5, d4 Black: Ke3, Ra2; pawn - f2 The style of Eliskases may have been universal, as Alekhine wrote, but spectacular it was certainly not. It may be significant for his style that his most famous game is one in which he saved a draw by the skin of his teeth. White: Keres Black: Eliskases, Noordwijk 1938. A famous endgame that found a place in many textbooks. White's last move was 51 d3- d4 There followed 51...Ke3xd4! This had to be calculated very exactly. Not good for black would have been 51...Ra5 52 d5 Rxb5 53 d6 Rd5 and now not 54 a7 Ra5 55 d7 Rxa7 56 d8Q Rxf7 57 Qe8+ Kf3 58 Qxf7+ Kg2, but 54 Rxf2! Rxd6 55 Ra2 Rd8 56 a7 Ra8 57 Ra4 and white wins. 52 Rf7xf2 Ra2xf2 53 a6-a7 White could have started his run for promotion with the other pawn. In Hans Kmoch's tournament book the following variation is given: 53 b6 Kc3 54 Kd1 Kd3 55 Ke1 Ke3!! (double exclamation mark by Kmoch) 56 b7 Rh2 57 Kf1 Kf3 58 Kg1 Rh8!! 59 a7 Rg8+ 60 Kf1 Rh8 61 Ke1 Ke3 62 Kd1 Kd3 63 Kc1 Kc3 64 Kb1 Rh1+ 65 Ka2 Rh2+ 66 Ka3 Rh1 67 Ka4 Kc4 68 Ka5 Kc5 with a draw. A fantastic variation, writes Kmoch with good reason. 53...Rf2-a2 54 b5-b6 Kd4-c3 55 Kc1-b1 Ra2-a6!! Double exclamation mark by Kmoch again, and this time his admiration is somewhat exaggerated, because other rook moves on the a-file would do as well. 56 b6-b7 Ra6-b6+ 57 Kb1-c1 Rb6-h6! Draw. White's king cannot escape. Diagram: White: Kh1, Nc8; pawns - a3, b2, f4, g4, h3 Black: Kh7, Bd6; pawns - b6, c4, g7, h6 White: Eliskases Black: Fischer, Buenos Aires 1960. For the future world champion this was not a very successful tournament. Among twenty players, he shared thirteenth place. Nor was it for Eliskases, who finished seventeenth and apart from Fischer, only beat the weak Bazan. . 41...Bd6-c5 The sealed move, a mistake. A draw could be had by 41...Bxa3 42 Nxb6 Bxb2 though black, a pawn down, would still have to put in some effort. But it is typical for Fischer that he tries to keep some winning chances, even a pawn down. 42 a3-a4 Kh7-g6 After 42...Bd4 white has 43 Nd6 43 file:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans09.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:57 PM]\n\nKh1-g2 Kg6-f6 44 Kg2-f3 Kf6- e6 45 Kf3-e4 Bc5-f2 46 f4-f5+ Ke6-d7 47 Nc8-a7 Kd7-d6 48 Na7-b5+ Kd6-c5 49 Nb5-c7 Bf2-h4 50 Nc7-e8 Kc5-b4 51 Ke4-d5 Bh4-e7 52 Ne8xg7 Be7-f6 53 Ng7-e8 Bf6xb2 54 f5-f6 Bb2xf6 55 Ne8xf6 c4-c3 56 Nf6-h5 This way white is just in time: 56...c2 57 Nf4 c1Q 58 Nd3+ Hardly better in this variation is 57...c1N, because black's knight is powerless against white's kingside pawns. 56...Kb4xa4 57 Nh5- f4 b6-b5 58 Nf4-e2 c3-c2 And Fischer resigned. White's simplest win starts with 59 h4. There must have been few players who beat both Capablanca and Fischer. As far as I know only Euwe, Keres, Reshevsky and Eliskases.

On the Internet site of the tournament big dollar signs turned around merrily as to invite the chessplayers to the land of plenty. And successfully. This year there were 761 players and 57 grandmasters among them. Those who think that the grandmasters could happily cut up the prize fund among themselves, are not aware of the way such American opens are run. Most of the money goes not to the main event, where the best players compete, but to other sections for the lower rated. For instance the under 1800 section had a first prize of $8000, won by a nine-year-old boy called Adam Maltese. With gnashing of teeth the grandmasters see the money that they consider rightfully theirs go down the under-1800 drain. It was a good start for a professional career for the young boy. He should be careful that he does not become too strong during the coming year, because that would force him to play next time in a higher section where the competition is much stiffer. I learned from American chess literature that some American players prepare in a very special way for events like the New York Open: by losing in other, less important tournaments as many games as they can without attracting suspicion, to come down to a low rating which will permit them to earn a lot of money in a section that is to weak for them. Sandbaggers they are called. The sandbagger is supposed to be excluded from tournaments when found out, but generally it seems that little effort is spent on smoking him out of his hiding, because a high turnout of players is in the organizers' interest. The entry fees were high at the New York Open: $220 for early applicants, $260 at the door of the playing hall. Grandmasters do not have to pay, but when they win a prize the $220 is deducted from it. Still I think that organizer Jos‚ Cuchi and his jewelry firm Heraldica spent a lot of money on the event. Grandmasters with a FIDE rating of 2600 or more got a free air ticket and hotel room this year. For most players the dates of the tournament were April 2-6, but there were other possibilities, like a two-weekends schedule. Or starting in the first weekend, then after four games deciding that you don't like your score, having it canceled and starting anew on April 2 with the big crowd, of course after paying a fee again, but this time reduced to $110. There were accelerated schedules, super-accelerated schedules, take your choice. All this is exhilaratingly exotic to European chessplayers. The players in the main section had to score highly to get a prize. The tournament was won by Krasenkov and Bologan, who made a wonderful 8 out of 9. They both won $9000, just a thousand more than the young boy from the under 1800 section.\n\nfile:///C|/...ts%20and%20Settings/Owner/Desktop/eBook%20Reprocesses/Dutch%20Treat%20-%20Hans%20Ree/Dutch%20Treat/hans10.txt[10/5/2016 8:14:57 PM]\n\nIn tough tournaments like this one, with several games per day, the men are separated from the boys and I would think the New York Open was tailor- made for my indefatigable compatriot Loek van Wely, who in fact won it last year. This time he started well with 4,5 out of 5, but after that in the last four rounds he only scored draws, which brought him to a shared seventh place in the end. The last round saw him make a very short draw against the Turkish grandmaster Atalik. Strange. The $130 prize that Van Wely won amounted to less than the entry fee, so if this were deducted ( Was it? There also was a Consolation Fund where Van Wely had a claim to $220, exactly the entry fee. The calculations go over my head), he would be left with nothing. Had he won his last round game, his prize would have been $1260, worth playing on for a while. It is nothing like him, meekly succumbing to a worthless draw. Something must have been wrong. In the end only six grandmasters from the 57 won money which amounted to more than the deducted entry fee. But no matter. For many Europeans the tournament is a nice opportunity to visit New York, which apparently was realized by the organisers, who this year brought the tournament back to where it belongs: the heart of Manhattan. Those who think that this column is disgustingly about money instead of chess are certainly right, but please realise that all these banal financial calculations must have been heavily on the competitors' mind. Not only on the Internet site but also in the eyes of the players the dollar signs were merrily turning around. White Van Wely-black Lein 1. d2-d4 d7-d5 2. c2-c4 c7-c6 3.
