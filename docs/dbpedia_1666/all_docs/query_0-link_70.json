Despite international downturns in travel because of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and SARS, New Zealand has welcomed over two million visitors for the first time. There has been huge growth in all tourism sectors, and the mood looks set to continue. The airlines, though, are still up in the air— at least in terms of who’s who. The proposed merger between Air New Zealand and Australia’s Qantas is still awaiting approval; Britain’s Virgin Blue has successfully negotiated TransTasman flying rights; and United Airlines has withdrawn from New Zealand. Here’s what else is new in New Zealand. AUCKLAND The new multimillion-dollar Britomart Transport Exchange has finally opened, and Aucklanders are looking ahead to a more organized, more efficient city transport system—and hopefully less traffic congestion with all buses, trains, and ferry services converging downtown. Subritzky (& 09/5345663) launched a new 500-passenger ferry to Waiheke Island at the end of 2003. It also takes 50 vehicles and makes the trip to Waiheke Island much easier. There was huge disappointment that New Zealand failed to retain the America’s Cup for a third time, but Auckland has continued to flourish regardless, with high occupancy rates, major revamps, and new construction. A welcome addition to moderately priced inner city accommodations is\n\nthe brand-new President Plaza Hotel Auckland, 1 Hobson St. (& 0800/ 773-743 in NZ, or 09/356-1000), ideally placed near Viaduct Harbour. There’s sumptuous new upmarket bed and breakfast accommodation at Cotter House, 4 St. Vincent Ave., Remuera (& 09/529-5156); and Mollies, 6 Tweed St., St. Mary’s Bay (& 09/376-3489), is a stylish new boutique hotel close to trendy Ponsonby. Just across the water on Waiheke Island, The Boatshed, Tawa and Huia streets (& 09/372-9619), has beautiful luxury suites; and Longhouse (& 09/308-9044), also on Waiheke, is New Zealand’s first residential cooking school. On the adventure front, you can now leap off Auckland’s Harbour Bridge and survive to tell the tale. This is thanks to A.J. Hackett Bungy (& 0800/462-8649 in NZ, or 09/ 377-6543). New restaurants and bars are too numerous to list, but one worth trying is Chandelier, 152 Ponsonby Rd. (& 09/360-9315), a completely overthe-top dining experience that draws an avant-garde crowd. Gault at George, 144 Parnell Rd. (& 09/3582600), is another worth shelling out for. See chapter 4 for complete details. ROTORUA, TAUPO & TONGARIRO NATIONAL PARK Taupo seems to have suddenly woken up. New developments are popping up everywhere, and existing tourism icons are brushing up their act. At press time, Taupo Hot Springs, 102\n\n2\n\nW H AT ’ S N E W\n\nTaupo-Napier Highway (& 07/3776502), was constructing the country’s newest purpose-designed health spa, set to open sometime in 2004. There’s steamy new intrigue at Wairakei Terraces, SH5 (& 07/378-0913), highlighting geothermal wonders. And in the accommodation stakes, Acacia Point Lodge, 11 Sylvia Place, Acacia Bay (& 07/378-9089), is a smart new boutique experience. Further south, there’s a massive new resort development in Kinloch Golf Resort (& 07/ 918-3316). Designed by American golf legend Jack Nicklaus, it will provide upmarket accommodation, restaurants, marina, fitness center, and, of course, a championship 18hole golf course. At Whakapapa in Tongariro National Park, there has been NZ$8 million (US$4.4 million) spent at The Grand Chateau, Whakapapa Village (& 0800/242-832), on a massive refurbishment of the existing hotel, plus the development of a new 40room wing and new atrium restaurant. See chapter 7 for complete details. WELLINGTON The capital’s hotel scene is as changeable as ever. The Parkroyal has rebranded as Hotel InterContinental Wellington, Grey and Featherston streets (& 0800/442-215), and has undergone a multimillion-dollar revamp. Novotel Capital, 133–137 The Terrace (& 0800/444-422 in NZ, or 04/918-1900) is a new hotel in the heart of the city. There is still talk of The Hilton constructing a new hotel on the reclaimed waterfront area, but this has yet to gain official approval. You’ll find new Maori attractions at Pataka, Norrie and Parumoana streets, Porirua (& 04/237-1511), a showcase of contemporary Maori art; and Maori Treasures, 56–58 Guthrie St., Lower Hutt (& 04/939-9630), a complex offering gallery, gift store, cafe, and exclusive tour experiences. See chapter 10 for complete details.\n\nCHRISTCHURCH & CANTERBURY The proposed NZ$6.4 million (US$3.5 million) Maori Cultural Village attraction, to be established by Rotorua’s Tamaki brothers, has been put on hold, although discussions are continuing and at press time there was hope that it would open sometime in 2004. There’s a swanky new HIP (Highly Individual Places) hotel at Off The Square, Worcester Street (& 0800/ 633-843), where you’ll find highly individualized rooms for terrific prices, right beside Cathedral Square in the heart of the city. Further north, Hanmer Springs Thermal Reserve, Amuri Road (& 0800/442-663 in NZ, or 03/315-7511), has seen a 38% increase in visitor numbers and is planning yet another major extension to include new thermal pools and picnic areas. In Kaikoura, the Scenic Hotel chain is opening Te Kaikoura, a new 70room hotel in 2004. It will be the town’s first hotel and a much needed addition. (Christchurch-based Scenic Hotels are also opening new hotels in Blenheim and Dunedin in 2004.) See chapter 12 for complete details. QUEENSTOWN & ENVIRONS Additions to Queenstown accommodations include the upmarket star Eichardt’s Private Hotel, The Mall (& 03/441-0450), where everything is as luxurious and enveloping as you could hope for. Shotover Lodge, 61 Atley Rd. (& 03/441-8037), is the new baby of Steve and Jeanette Brough, former owners of Remarkables Lodge. Meanwhile, back at Remarkables Lodge, 595 Kingston Rd. (& 03/442-2720), new owners Simon Bolt and Heini Mueller have swept a broom through and reopened after a major revamp. On the adventure front, Via Ferrata Queenstown (& 03/409-0696)\n\nW H AT ’ S N E W\n\nshould appeal to adventure seekers who like climbing in high rocky places; and Shotover Canyon Swing (& 03/442-9708; www.canyonswing. co.nz) is supposedly the world’s highest giant swing—just a little something for the already bored adrenalin\n\n3\n\njunkie. Softies might prefer the gentle comforts of Yvalda Boat Cruises (& 03/442-3499), a new operation that puts the classic ketch used by Sir Winston Churchill in World War II to a new use on lake Wakatipu. See chapter 14 for complete details.\n\n1 The Best of New Zealand B\n\nack in 1979, New Zealand cartoonist and satirist Tom Scott, writing in NZ Listener magazine, had this to say about New Zealand: “Terrible tragedy in the South Seas. Three million people trapped alive.” The big news in 2003 was that we hit the four million population mark, and more than half of that increase was due to immigration. Given that we have around 44 million sheep, one New Zealander still equates to a whole lot of fresh lamb. Look beyond the farm gate, though, and you’ll find we’ve caught up with the rest of the world. We may bob about at the bottom of the Southern Hemisphere, but it would be unfair to consider the country a backwater. New Zealand has notched up a record year in tourism, welcoming more than two million visitors a year for the first time, despite international upheavals like terrorist attacks and SARS. Visitors contributed more than $5 billion to the country’s economy, making tourism one of New Zealand’s biggest overseas income earners. And we’re better equipped for tourists. Efficient visitor centers abound, and accommodations range from budget to exclusive. You can shop 7 days a week, whoop it up at clubs and bars 24 hours a day, or savor a glass of internationally recognized New Zealand wine in an inexpensive cafe. You can get real coffee in as many variations as you can imagine, and New Zealand’s fresh, innovative cuisine will leave you breathless and begging for more. Even provincial New Zealand has pulled up its socks without losing its heart. Small-town pride is beaming, and farmers are turning their hands to boutique tour operations and gorgeous restored B&Bs to supplement farm incomes, changing the whole nature of many backwater rural districts. Yet you’ll still find, at its core, the very Kiwi hospitality that has made this country famous. You may have heard that New Zealanders are born wearing wet suits and carrying paddles, such is their appetite for the outdoors and adventure. No part of the country is more than 128km (79 miles) from the sea, and a coastline spread with splendid beaches dishes up thousands of beautiful coastal walks and chances to surf and soak in the sun. New Zealand is also a winter magnet for international skiers and is the whiteknuckle capital of the world. This is where you can push it to the limits, pit yourself against your fears and limitations, take risk by the throat, and go for it—leaping off bridges into surging river gorges attached to a giant rubber band, or taking a stab at luging, zorbing, sky diving, paragliding, kayaking, whitewater rafting, and jet-boating. There’s no lack of invention when it comes to adrenaline-pumping activities in this country. But you don’t have to be an extreme athlete to enjoy New Zealand. There are just as many ways to be laid-back and indulgent—tour wineries that have stampeded their way to the top of world ratings in record time; take in the wealth of Polynesian and Maori culture that forms the backbone of an increasingly multicultural society; or check out the strong historical and architectural reminders of a colonial past. There are lush gardens, art galleries, museums, and plenty of\n\nTHE BEST BEACHES\n\none-off reminders that New Zealand is like no other place. I was born in New Zealand and despite frequent trips overseas, I can’t shake off the inherent sense of belonging here. This book presents “my” New Zealand. After many months traveling thousands of miles, testing mattresses, comparing prices, leaping off clifftops (well, almost), speeding\n\n5\n\nup rivers, and eating and drinking in far too many restaurants, I am more convinced than ever that New Zealand is one of the quirkiest, quaintest, craziest places on earth. It is one of the most favored destinations of the new millennium, and before you’ve even left here, you’ll want to come back. Dip into these pages, and you’ll see why.\n\n1 The Best Beaches • Waiheke Island’s Onetangi Bay: Stand on the bay’s wide stretch of golden sand, and you can see for miles. On a clear day, throw yourself down into the sand and gaze at the steep pinnacles of Great Barrier Island and Little Barrier, off in the hazy distance. There might even be a few glimpses of the Coromandel in between deliciously warm swims. See “A Side Trip to Waiheke Island” in chapter 4. • Karikari Peninsula’s Beaches: This is the Far North at its subtropical best—endless sweeps of sparkling white sand lapped by crystal-clear, azure-blue waters. And from Tokerau Beach to Rangiputa to Matai Bay, you could well have miles of it to yourself for beachcombing, sunbathing, and swimming (with care). See “Bay of Islands & the Far North” in chapter 5. • Coopers Beach: Partly shaded by a bank of red-emblazoned pohutukawa trees, how could you not be content to stretch out here? Exercise? A walk to the water should do it! See “Bay of Islands & the Far North” in chapter 5. • Hot Water Beach: Don’t ask me why, or how, but if you get here 2 hours before or after low tide, you can hollow out a spot on the beach for yourself, then wait for natural hot water to seep up through the sand. A natural spa experience without paying a cent!\n\nSee “The Coromandel Peninsula” in chapter 5. • Mount Maunganui’s Ocean Beach: Surf, sand, and sun— some people never want more than that. Throw on a bit of suntan lotion, a pair of sunglasses, and a skimpy swimsuit, and you’ll be able to mix it with the best of the bronzed bodies that make an annual pilgrimage to this perennial beach and surf favorite. See “Tauranga & Bay of Plenty” in chapter 6. • Kaiteriteri Beach: Half of Canterbury makes a beeline for these blissful shores every summer. It’s not expansive—in fact it’s quite small, but perfectly formed nonetheless, and there’s a busy vacation atmosphere with packed campgrounds and holiday houses. And with Nelson’s endless hours of sunshine, who could complain about size? See “Nelson, Richmond & Motueka” in chapter 11. • Abel Tasman National Park’s Beaches: Bush-wrapped and locked between rocky headlands, these idyllic golden patches from Marahau north to Totaranui are accessible by sea only. That’s what makes them so special. Gliding through the turquoise waters in your sea kayak, with curious seals to keep you company, you can take your pick of isolated havens. See “Abel Tasman National Park & Golden Bay” in chapter 11.\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER 1 . THE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n2 The Best Active Vacations • Scuba Diving in the Poor Knights: Jacques Yves Cousteau rated this among the best diving spots in the world. This unique marine reserve has the best of tropical currents sweeping in to make it warm and inviting for a wide variety of tropical species that aren’t found anywhere else in New Zealand’s waters. See “Into the Deep Blue Sea” on p. 155. • Blackwater Rafting in the Waitomo Glowworm Caves: Daredevils can now go underground to leap off waterfalls; slink through dark, damp, underground waterways; abseil off “Lost World” rock faces; and do other things in the dark. See “Hamilton & the Waikato” in chapter 6. • Trout Fishing in Taupo: They say the fish in Lake Taupo are so big that when you catch one, the lake level drops. The dozens of other rivers (especially world-renowned Tongariro) and streams in the region also have rich pickings for the fisherman. See “Taupo” in chapter 7. • Sea Kayaking in Abel Tasman National Park: It takes a lot to beat this balmy little paddle into the best-preserved and most beautiful coastline of New Zealand. Keep company with nosy seal pups and dolphins; call into pristine,\n\ndeserted beaches; and explore rocky headlands. See “Abel Tasman National Park & Golden Bay” in chapter 11. • Walking the Glaciers: Dig out those snow boots and walking poles, add a dash of nerve and daring, and take the walk of a lifetime down Fox or Franz Josef Glaciers in the deep south. And don’t forget your camera so you can bring home those unforgettable views into the snow caves. See “Franz Josef & Fox Glaciers” in chapter 13. • Getting Wild in Queenstown: This is New Zealand’s adrenaline capital, where you get more than one chance to show how crazy you really are. There are more daredevil stunts per square inch here than anywhere else in the country. An international skiing mecca in winter, it readily transforms itself into summer madness as well. See “Queenstown” in chapter 14. • Walking the Fiordland Tracks: If you fancy yourself as a multi-day tramper, there’s plenty to keep you out of mischief in Fiordland. This is where you get some of the best walks in the world—the Milford, the Hollyford, the Kepler, and the Routeburn tracks. See “Tramping” in chapter 3 and “Te Anau” in chapter 14.\n\n3 The Best of Natural New Zealand • Ninety Mile Beach and Cape Reinga: From the spiritual tip of the North Island where, Maori say, the souls of the dead depart, to mountainous sand dunes, quicksand, and the broad flat stretch of Ninety Mile Beach, this is a must-see area filled with the unexpected. See “Bay of Islands & the Far North” in chapter 5.\n\n• Waiotapu Thermal Wonderland: The earth’s molten core hints at its artistic potential in a veritable rainbow of color and steamy chaos manifested in geysers, mud pools, hot bubbling lakes, steamy terraces, and more. A photographer’s paradise, but tread carefully. See “Bubble, Bubble, Toil & Trouble: The Geothermal Attractions” on p. 190.\n\nTHE BEST TRAMPS\n\n• Tongariro National Park: Three major volcanoes dominate a rugged central plateau landscape: Ruapehu, Tongariro, and Ngauruhoe. An indomitable threesome, they’re rife with Maori legend and rich in a few modern stories as well. Great for skiers, trampers, and anyone wanting a physical challenge. See “Tongariro National Park” in chapter 7. • Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers: This is one of the very few places on earth where you’ll find fullfledged glaciers this close to the ocean. In a slow, ever-onward creep, they make their way from the heights of the Southern Alps down into untouched rainforest. See “Franz Josef & Fox Glaciers” in chapter 13. • Fiordland: Come here on a wet day (and that’s easy because this place gets the most rainfall in New Zealand), and you’ll think you’ve stepped into the living set of Lord of the Rings. This place defies all\n\n7\n\nsuperlatives. It is the ultimate must-see. See “Te Anau” in chapter 14. • The Catlins Coast: This is wild, natural New Zealand at its unspoiled best. From unique fossil forests to all manner of seabirds and mammals, native bush, waterfalls, wild beaches, unforgettable tangles of driftwood, and a frustratingly changeable climate—the area takes a lot of beating, but the resulting dramatic impact is unforgettable. See “Dunedin” in chapter 15. • Ulva Island: Tucked into Stewart Island’s Paterson Inlet, tiny Ulva Island will leave you speechless with its incredible native bird life. It’s wall-to-wall feathers here— and what’s more, they’re not afraid of humans. Don’t go without your camera; you’ll need evidence once you start telling friends back home about it! See “Stewart Island” in chapter 15.\n\n4 The Best Tramps For complete details about tramping in New Zealand, see “Tramping” in chapter 3. • Tongariro Crossing: Often described as one of the best 1-day walks in New Zealand, this highaltitude hike across volcanic terrain will give you cold mountain springs, lava flows, an active crater, emerald-colored crater lakes, and unforgettable views. Be fit and enthusiastic. See “Tongariro National Park” in 7. • The Abel Tasman Coastal Track: This is another easy 3- to 5-day walk where the guided option gives you the choice of ditching those hefty packs. From start to finish, 51km (32 miles) later, it winds in and out of gorgeous sheltered coves, golden beaches,\n\nrocky headlands, and natural unspoiled bush. See “Abel Tasman National Park & Golden Bay” in chapter 11. • The Heaphy Track: No softieguided options here: You go it alone for 4 to 6 days from the junction of the Brown and Aorora rivers, across tussock-covered flats to the wild seas of Karamea on the West Coast. See “Westport & Karamea” in chapter 13. • The Milford Track: The mother of them all, the Milford is one of the world’s best and most loved multi-day tramps. Stretching through the best of Fiordland, this 54km (33-mile) trail follows the Clinton and Arthur valleys and crosses McKinnon Pass with views you’ll never forget. See “Te Anau” in chapter 14.\n\n8\n\nCHAPTER 1 . THE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n• The Routeburn Track: Like the Milford and the Hollyford before it, this track makes its way into virgin rainforest and the sort of wild fairyland scenery where you’d expect to see elves and gnomes prancing around. See “Te Anau” in chapter 14. • The North West Circuit: This is a real test for experienced trampers\n\nwho think they can face 10 to 12 days walking 125km (78 miles) through bird-filled native bush, big beaches, and long stretches knee-deep in mud. I’m told the rewards are plenty. See “Stewart Island” in chapter 15.\n\n5 The Best Offbeat Travel Experiences • Visit the World’s Biggest Polynesian Market: Why go all around the Pacific Islands when you can get the best of it in the comfort of an Otara parking lot? Go hungry and feast on island goodies, smell the smells, and buy beautiful tapa cloth and top-notch Polynesian weaving. See “The Markets” in chapter 4. • Swim with Sharks: You’ve got to be keen, I admit, but this can be done in perfect safety. Along with those charming, perfectly harmless tropical fish in the Poor Knights Maritime Reserve, you can come face to face with Jaws’s South Seas cousins in a tough metal cage. Gisborne offers a similar knuckle-biting thrill. See “Into the Deep Blue Sea” on p. 155 and “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 8. • Visit a Maori Marae: Experience the hongi (the formal nose-to-nose Maori greeting), see deeply moving song and dance performances, and eat from a traditional underground hangi (oven). Do this in Rotorua as part of an organized tour experience, or seek permission to visit one of the dozens of East Cape marae (village common). See “Rotorua” in chapter 7 and “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 8. • Take the East Cape Road: Journey back in time as you travel the last remote outreaches of the Pacific Coast Highway. It’s a feast of living Maori culture, stunning coastline, empty beaches, stockmen\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nherding sheep on horseback, wild horses, and roaming stock (drive carefully)—and it’s the first place in the world to see the morning sun. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 8. Do the Eastern Bays Scenic Mail Run: Get a feel for real rural New Zealand as you whizz around lonely, unpaved roads delivering mail to far-flung farming families. Hear all the latest community news firsthand and see some stunning landscapes in the bargain. See “On the Run” on p. 355. Whale-Watch in Kaikoura: When a mighty sperm whale flaps its tail at you, you won’t forget it in a hurry. These big sea monsters come to this particular stretch of water for a marine habitat rich in their kind of plankton. Don’t be surprised to see dolphins aplenty, too. See “Marine Experiences in Kaikoura” on p. 359. Eat Bugs and Beetles at the Wild Foods Festival: Prime yourself! You’ll need culinary fortitude for this mind-boggling event—you could be served up anything from wriggling grubs to the unmentionable body parts of a number of wild and not-so-wild animals. The West Coast at its most rugged best. See “Hokitika: Greenstone, Glowworms & Gold” in chapter 13. Drive into Skippers Canyon: Relive the pioneer days as you make your way into one of the\n\nTHE BEST VIEWS\n\nhottest old gold-mining areas via a treacherous road guaranteed to take your mind off any other troubles you thought you had! Take a bungy jump while you’re here—if you dare. One thing’s for sure—it couldn’t be any worse than the road. See “Queenstown” in chapter 14. • Stalk Kiwis at Night: And I mean the birds! Get ready for surprises\n\n9\n\non this little southern adventure. It’s the only place in the country where you can creep about lonely beaches at night with flashlights and stealth and not get arrested! At the same time, you’ll be one of the lucky few who get to see a wild kiwi foraging for its supper among the seaweed. See “Making a Date with a Kiwi” on p. 470.\n\n6 The Best Views • Sky Tower: The paramount city view in not only New Zealand, but also the entire Southern Hemisphere. Once you get out of that glass-faced lift 328m (over 1,000 ft.) above the city, you’ll know just what I mean. Fabulous 360-degree views of Auckland unfold below, and you can test your courage by walking over glass floors! See p. 115. • Hicks Bay: Stop at the high point above Hicks Bay before you descend into Te Araroa to see New Zealand’s largest pohutukawa tree and the East Cape Lighthouse. Resting awhile, high up between the two bays, see if you can imagine Captain Cook’s expression when he first sighted the area, and his relief to be leaving again after a tragic Maori massacre in which one European was killed and eaten on his wedding night. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 8. • Havelock North’s Te Mata Peak: A big “sleeping giant” of a hill, 393m (1,310-ft.) Te Mata affords big views of endless green and Brown undulations, reaching all the way to the coast. Havelock North, Hastings, and Napier all blend together below. See “Hawkes Bay” in chapter 8. • Wellington’s Kelburn Cable Car: Not so far above the capital’s busy\n\nshopping streets, you’ll be rewarded with postcard-perfect vistas of glass-faced high-rises silhouetted against the harbor. Step off the cute red cable car into the verdant acres of the Botanical Gardens and look seaward. No matter what the weather, the view is always memorable. See p. 274. • Queenstown’s Skyline Gondola: It’s everybody’s aim to get high in Queenstown one way or another. Make yours by way of a smooth gondola ride to the top of Bob’s Peak. Step out into the cool, crisp, exceedingly fresh air with New Zealand’s playground spread out at your feet. The Remarkables will keep the view in check, and Lake Wakatipu will be a big blue basin below. See “Queenstown” in chapter 14. • Nugget Point: You may not have seen another human being for hours by the time you make your way to the lookout above Nugget Point. And once you’ve experienced the blissful solitude of standing on this wild, windswept Catlins promontory, you probably won’t care if you don’t see anyone for several more. Thick, swirling masses of kelp, seals, penguins, and seabirds galore—they’re all here by the hundreds. See “Dunedin” in chapter 15.\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER 1 . THE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\n7 The Best Drives • Auckland City to Mission Bay: This is the stuff of a weekend afternoon spin to see how the other half lives. Best done in a Ferrari, a BMW, an Audi, or an equally cool classic if you want to leave a lasting impression. Tight shorts and in-line skates do the trick just as well if you want a cheaper set of wheels. Do the cafe crawl; join the walkers, the runners, and the dog strollers; or just drool over million-dollar real estate. See “Orientation” in chapter 4. • Rotorua’s Blue and Green Lakes: From the stately redwood forest on the edge of town, all the way past the Blue and Green Lakes to the Buried Village and Lake Tarawera and back again, you’ll squeal with delight at a dozen different things. There are lots of picnic spots on the way, but the Landing Café at Lake Tarawera is a good bet if you forget the hamper. See “Rotorua” in chapter 7. • The Capital to Mellow Martinborough: Once you’ve left the motorways behind, you’ll be up and over the winding Rimutaka Hill Road in little more than 40 minutes. Then it’s downhill all the way to Martinborough’s enchanting pocket of prize-winning wineries. Surrender to hedonism and squander time in idyllic vineyard settings. Make the only exercise you do raising your glass, or at most a wee stroll through pretty little Martinborough Village, where cute shops await. See “A Side Trip to Wairarapa” in chapter 10.\n\n• Queen Charlotte Sounds: Take the scenic loop from Picton to the little fishing village of Havelock and back to Picton on the main highway. Stop and admire the bush-clad sounds and the boats, and indulge in fresh green-lipped mussels grown in these very waters at the Mussel Boys Restaurant, in Havelock. It’s a narrow winding road around the Sounds, so take it quietly. See “Picton & Blenheim” in chapter 11. • Greymouth to Westport: Pretty, pretty, pretty! Nikau palms, native bush, tree ferns, jagged rocks, roaring surf, and the big blue Tasman Sea combine to make this a lovely half-day outing. Be sure to stop at the famous Punakaiki Pancake Rocks, where blowholes have a spectacular hissy fit as the ocean roars into, under, and around rocky caverns on the coast. See “Westport & Karamea” in chapter 13. • The Famous Milford Road: Even the Wanaka-Haast road can’t match the splendor of this one. It’s been called one of the best drives in the world, and no amount of raving can do it justice. You really just have to do it. Virgin rainforest, mirrorlike lakes, astounding waterfalls (especially during rain), beech forest, mountains of moss, bright orange lichens, and sheer mountain faces thousands of feet high contribute to the overall picture—not to mention the slightly daunting Homer Tunnel. See “Milford Sound” in chapter 14.\n\n8 The Best Gardens • Hamilton Gardens: Stretched along the banks of the Waikato River, this blissful, relatively new 58-hectare (143-acre) reserve is a\n\nlovely place to wander and picnic. Development began around 30 years ago; there’s now a wellestablished Asian garden, English\n\nTHE BEST MUSEUMS\n\ngarden, herb and scented gardens, and lavish stands of trees. See “Hamilton & the Waikato” in chapter 6. • Eastwoodhill Arboretum: One of the most magical places in the country, hardly a garden by normal standards, this astounding collection—the best in New Zealand—is one man’s life’s work and presents over 3,500 species often studied by international scientists. Go in autumn for unforgettable color displays—and bring a camera. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 8. • Pukeiti Rhododendron Trust: Here you get a world-class collection of rhododendrons, viraya, and azaleas set in a centuries-old forest near Mount Egmont—our little Mount Fuji. The gardens spread over many acres in a lovely rural setting 30 minutes from New Plymouth. See “New Plymouth: Gateway to Egmont National Park” in chapter 9. • Christchurch’s Botanic Gardens: Regardless of the season, this central-city acreage has plenty to offer, but it’s quintessentially Christchurch when the daffodils and bluebells bloom under the huge oak trees along the Avon River and avenues of weeping cherries burst into color. This is\n\n11\n\nwhen people think of England. See p. 339. • Mona Vale: This little beauty is often overlooked in favor of the city’s Botanical Gardens, but it has an intimate charm all its own. Spreading out around a stately Victorian home, these public gardens have myriad lovely features, including iris collections along stream banks, fountains, hostas by the yard, and that old favorite, the rose, which does so well in Canterbury. See “Exploring Christchurch” in chapter 12. • Ohinetahi: If you’re a garden fan, this is a must. Formal, architectural, and stately are all words that instantly spring to mind. Definitely English-inspired and modeled after the best of England’s stately gardens, with quirky New Zealand modifications. See “Exploring Christchurch” in chapter 12. • Taunton Gardens: Another Canterbury treat near Ohinetahi. This one is the result of Barry Sligh’s ceaseless passion for plants, in particular hostas and rhododendrons. He collects, he breeds, he grows, he tends, he rakes, he weeds, and he still has time to talk gardening. You’ll love the lush valley he has developed. See “Exploring Christchurch” in chapter 12.\n\n9 The Best Museums • Auckland Museum: After a very significant internal revamp, this museum is everything you’d want in a city’s storehouse of treasures: fun, interactive, attractive, informative, and filled with interesting collections. Its Maori and Polynesian section, the biggest in the world, sends shivers down your spine; if you’ve got kids, let them loose in the Discovery Centre, where they can legally stick\n\ntheir fingers into just about anything. See p. 115. • The New Zealand National Maritime Museum: At the pinnacle of New Zealand’s boating history— with the America’s Cup Challenge right in our backyard—the Maritime Museum is booming. Look for KZ1 outside, and inside discover 1,000 years of the country’s maritime history. See sail-makers, boat-builders, and wood-turners at\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 1 . THE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\nwork and take a cruise on one of the vessels. See p. 118. • Te Papa Tongarewa—The Museum of New Zealand: One of the largest national museums in the world, this giant new edifice on Wellington’s waterfront is said to be 5 years ahead of anything else like it. Truly bicultural, it’s a magical place where art and artifacts meet technological brilliance, creating riveting displays and interactive playthings for all ages. You’ll find everything from a whale skeleton and a working Maori marae to art collections and virtual-reality diversions. See p. 273.\n\n• Canterbury Museum and the International Antarctic Centre: Although these two museums are completely separate entities located miles apart, together they present a terrific overview of life and history in Antarctica. Nowhere else in the world will you find this much gathered information about the great icy continent. There’s everything from wildlife displays to human exploration accounts and a real ice chamber so you can get the feel of life in subzero temperatures. See p. 338 and p. 339.\n\n10 The Best Maori Experiences • Auckland Museum: This is the perfect place for an early lesson in things Maori. The recently revamped museum has the largest collection of Maori artifacts in the world. Large war canoes, meetinghouses, greenstone weapons, and feather cloaks are here. On top of that, the Manaia Maori Performance Group puts on a stunning show three times a day. See p. 115. • Whakarewarewa Thermal Reserve & New Zealand Maori Arts & Crafts Institute: Maori guides will lead you through the thermal reserve, explaining the significance of the area to the Maori people. There’s also a live song-and-dance performance, a tour of a replica Maori village, and the chance to watch working weavers and carvers in the Arts & Crafts Institute, which was set up in 1963 to foster traditional craft skills. See p. 186. • Tamaki Maori Village: This re-created ancient Maori village was the New Zealand Tourism Awards Supreme winner in 1998.\n\nIt presents Maori life as it used to be pre-European settlement. You’ll tour the village with a Maori elder, learn the ancient myths, watch a traditional performance, and eat from a traditional hangi. See “Rotorua” in chapter 7. • Royal Lakeside Novotel: Here you’ll find the best Maori hangi and performance in Rotorua. It includes a steam-cooked hangi, poi dance, the haka, traditional songs and games, and an excellent audiovisual presentation spanning 150 years of Rotorua’s history. See “Rotorua” in chapter 7. • East Cape: This is a remote enclave of Maori culture—one of the last places in New Zealand where the Maori language is part of everyday life. You’ll find more than 100 marae scattered along the length of the East Cape Road, and if you ask permission, in most cases you’ll be allowed to enter. There are numerous Maori settlements and highly decorative Maori churches. See “Gisborne & the East Cape” in chapter 8.\n\nT H E B E S T L U X U RY AC C O M M O DAT I O N S\n\n13\n\n11 The Best B&Bs • The Great Ponsonby Bed & Breakfast (Auckland; & 0800/ 766-792 in NZ, or 09/376-5989): Sally James and Gerry Hill will give you one of the warmest welcomes you’ve encountered anywhere— and all this in a great-value, essentially Pacific environment filled with romance and color. Their mattention to detail is tops. See p. 102. • Cotter House (Auckland; & 09/ 529-5156): Steep yourself in history, style, and elegance in this remarkable old home owned by interior designer Gloria PoupardWalbridge, who has created a luxury stay in Auckland’s fifth oldest historic home. It is a rare example of British Regency architecture in New Zealand, and rooms envelop you in unequalled comforts. Everything is of the finest quality. See p. 105. • Glenora Estate (Waiheke Island; & 09/372-5082): Derek and Sally Holland have replicated a late-17th-century English Devon cottage that will make your mouth water. Set in 9 private acres of bush, it is luxury-plus. Voted by Travel & Leisure as one of the best places in the world to marry, it will win you over in a second. See p. 136. • Puerta del Sol Golfing Retreat (Mount Maunganui; & 07/5758665): Overlooking Mount Maunganui Golf Club, this\n\nunashamedly upmarket home brings a slice of Mexico to the Bay of Plenty. Ross and Paula Greenville have applied their innate sense of style to gorgeous rooms overlooking a pool and yucca-filled gardens. See p. 178. • 39 Russell (Nelson; & 03/5484655): Well-known New Zealand artist Jane Evans has once again shown that she’s a colorist supreme. The environment she has created in this superb self-contained cottage is to die for. Dare to unpack your bags, and you may never leave. See p. 308. • The Worcester of Christchurch (Christchurch; & 0800/365-015 in NZ, or 03/365-0936): You won’t better this for a central-city location topped with smiles and good taste. Maree Ritchie and Tony Taylor’s elegant Victorian home is straight across the street from the cultural hub of Christchurch; it also boasts its own art gallery and a wealth of gorgeous antiques. See p. 329. • Hartford House (Christchurch; & 03/355-5562): Architectural history and stunning interiors come together in Frank and Shirley Diver’s luxurious Merivale home. Peaceful, perfect, secluded, and just a step from loads of restaurants and the city’s most prestigious shopping area, it’s a choice you won’t regret. See p. 331.\n\n12 The Best Luxury Accommodations • Hilton Auckland (Auckland; & 0800/448-002 in NZ, or 09/978-2000): Hilton-style pampering means succumbing to a luxurious assault on the senses.

It has a supreme location beside the Waikato River just above the Huka Falls and a reputation for quality and service that seems impossible to shake. See p. 208. • Paratiho Farms (Motueka; & 03/ 528-2100): Americans Robert and\n\nSally Hunt found their slice of paradise in an archetypal New Zealand setting—rolling green hills, big clear skies, balmy climate, endless peace and quiet. Now they’re sharing the sublimely luxurious lodge they have created here. The attention to detail surpasses almost everything else in New Zealand. Don’t miss it. See p. 310. • Eichardt’s Private Hotel (Queenstown; & 03/441-0450): This new Small Luxury Hotels of the World member has received glowing accolades in Andrew Harper’s Hideaway Report, and it’s becoming the hotel of choice for discerning, upscale travelers. In a remodeled historic building in central Queenstown, it oozes first-class style and understated glamour. See p. 412. • Blanket Bay (Queenstown; & 03/ 442-9442): If you want luxury on a grand scale in a majestic setting to match, then look no further than Blanket Bay.

See “Whangarei & Beyond” in chapter 5.\n\n• Novotel Tainui (Hamilton; & 0800/450-050 in NZ, or 07/ 838-1366): Sometimes you just feel like hotel comforts, and the Novotel must be applauded for its top-quality finishing touches and its realistic room rates. Color and fine art abound, and staff members are eager to please. Make sure you dine in the fabulous riverside restaurant. See p. 172. • Ruby House (Wellington; & 04/ 934-7930): When French country style meets Kiwi ingenuity,\n\nT H E B E S T R E S TA U R A N T S\n\nyou’re guaranteed an impact.

See p. 265. • A Little Manor (Nelson; & 03/ 545-1411): When you see this little gem, you’ll think of dollhouses, but rest assured—it’s much bigger than its 4.5m (15-ft.) width would suggest. It’s a storybook delight, and Angela Higgins will make sure your stay is memorable, right down to the breakfast hamper delivered to the door. See p. 308. • Orari Bed & Breakfast (Christchurch; & 03/365-6569): Eight\n\n14 The Best Restaurants • White (Auckland; & 09/9782000): Named for its stunning minimal all-white interior, White is the handiwork of celebrated consulting chef Luke Mangan, who owns the award-winning restaurant Salt in Sydney. Its best feature is The Table, a big informal table for diners who like the idea of mixing with others over an outstanding meal. See “Where to Dine” in chapter 4. • Otto’s (Auckland; & 09/3009595): This is posh-plush, professionalism-plus. Located in the delicious Ascott Metropolis Hotel, Otto’s emphasizes the “fine” in fine dining and has staff that delivers the goods in terms of service and style. Just make sure you’ve swallowed your last mouthful before you catch your breath at the bill. See “Where to Dine” in chapter 4. • Vinnies Restaurant (Auckland; & 09/376-5597): Urban sophisticates flock here like lemmings to a clifftop, although the Pacific Rim culinary experience is\n\n15\n\nincredibly well-priced rooms in an elegant historic home just across the street from Christchurch’s cultural precinct are hard to beat for value. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better situation with this degree of convenience and comfort. See p. 330. • Villa Polenza Boutique Lodge (Hokitika; & 0800/241-801 in NZ, or 03/755-7801): Russell and Trina Diedrichs have taken creativity to new heights on the quirky West Coast. Their standout property is perched high on a hill overlooking the town and ocean, and you’ll enjoy lavish contemporary comforts here that will leave a lasting impression. See p. 376.\n\nundoubtedly much more lifeenhancing. Vinnies’s reputation for being one of Auckland’s top three never seems to shake. See p. 110. • Icon Restaurant (Wellington; & 04/801-5300): France meets Asia and New Zealand in this chic, culturally fused culinary masterpiece. Executive chef Peter Thornley has implanted his distinctive style firmly into a menu that celebrates fine flavors masterfully woven together. See p. 266. • Roxburgh Bistro (Wellington; & 04/385-7577): There are no prizes for the down-at-the-heels exterior, but there’s edible ecstasy within. Nor are there pretensions or swish interiors—just fine food that consistently stands out above the crowd for its international flair. See p. 271. • Rotherams (Christchurch; & 03/ 341-5142): Swiss-born chef Martin Weiss has mastered the art of stunning his hungry patrons. In an interior that’s all about romance and special occasions, he\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 1 . THE BEST OF NEW ZEALAND\n\npresents meals that excel in both presentation and taste. Not to be missed—likewise the extensive wine list. See p. 336. • Boardwalk Seafood Restaurant & Bar (Queenstown; & 03/4425630): I’ve criticized the decor here more than once, but there’s new\n\ncarpet underfoot and many reasons to keep returning—chief among them the truly outstanding seafood meals! This is one place famous for its reliability and consistency—and it has years of success to back up its claims. See p. 420.\n\n15 The Best Shopping • Auckland: The whole city is a treasure trove of shops. Try the chic fashion and design shops of High Street; international designer duty-free at DFS Galleria Customhouse; upmarket boutiques in Parnell; antiques on Manukau Road; mainstream fashion in Newmarket; big mall shopping at St. Luke’s Shopping Centre; and fabulous specialty shops on K’Road and Ponsonby Road. See “Shopping” in chapter 4. • Rotorua: A rich vein of New Zealand souvenirs runs right through the whole city, but for the best Maori arts and crafts, look to Tamaki Maori Village. See “Rotorua” in chapter 7. • Wellington: The Old Bank Building on Lambton Quay has only added to the electric atmosphere of this capital shopping area. Wander the length of the Quay for fashion, books, shoes, and more; move up through Willis Street for more of the same, and into Cuba Mall for edgy little design stores and off-the-wall retail surprises. Check out Tinakori Road for a handsome cluster of boutiques. See “Shopping” in chapter 10. • Nelson: Long recognized as the best region for leisure crafts shopping, greater Nelson is dotted with hundreds of pottery studios. Find international quality art glass at Höglund Art Glass Studio and a mixed complex of crafts at Craft\n\nHabitat. See “Nelson, Richmond & Motueka” in chapter 11. • Christchurch: The Arts Centre Galleria is home to about 40 crafts stores selling a wide range of goods, from sheepskin products and leather to wood-turned bowls and ceramics. More turn up for the weekend Arts Centre Market. Also in Christchurch, check out High Street for an eclectic mix of antiques, secondhand stores, cafes, and new and old clothing boutiques; Cashel Mall for fashion and design stores; Victoria Street for a whole host of new boutique stores; and Merivale Mall for upmarket fashion and specialty shops. See “Shopping” in chapter 12. • Hokitika and Greymouth: Jade/ greenstone/pounamu and gold are found in abundance in these two West Coast towns. Stores specializing in both are found side by side in both Hokitika and Greymouth. See “Greymouth & Lake Brunner” and “Hokitika: Greenstone, Glowworms & Gold” in chapter 13. • Queenstown: This is the home of expensive shopping. You’ll find that most things have big price tags, but the quality is invariably tops. There are leading New Zealand and international clothing labels, sheepskin products, souvenirs, leather, original arts and crafts, and masses of jewelry. See “Queenstown” in chapter 14.\n\n2 Planning Your Trip to New Zealand ith so much to see and do, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and unsure about W where to start your New Zealand holiday. I’m here to help—in the pages that follow, you’ll find a comprehensive appraisal of each of the regions, designed to help you isolate areas of interest. Hot on the tail of that, you’ll find all the nittygritty for organizing your big South Seas excursion.\n\n1 The Regions in Brief THE NORTH ISLAND AUCKLAND Far too often overlooked as little more than a landing port, Auckland has first-rate attractions, quality accommodations, and diverse leisure opportunities. It is without doubt the most cosmopolitan of the cities, and its balmy climate has a special appeal. Waitemata Harbour and Hauraki Gulf offer some of the world’s finest sailing, boating, and fishing, and in the aftermath of the 2002–03 America’s Cup yachting challenge, many quality hotels, bars, and restaurants are thriving. Cultural offerings abound in museums, galleries, and performing-arts centers; and shopping is the most diverse in the country. There are more than 900 restaurants and a wild nightlife scene, and if you’re into a beach lifestyle, there are numerous choices within easy reach. You may think it’s just another big city, but Auckland has a Polynesian backbone that makes it quite unique. If you’re touring only the North Island, Auckland is a perfect base. NORTHLAND & COROMANDEL Both are within easy reach of Auckland and can be tackled as a day trip if you’re short on\n\ntime. However, each warrants at least a couple of days’ exploration; if you have to choose between the two, I’d definitely swing up to the far north. Northland is served by a far better infrastructure in terms of transportation, hotels, and restaurants, and its beach attractions (on the east coast) are too numerous to itemize. That said, you’ll find far more tourists here, too, at least in the Bay of Islands area. Head north, though, and a whole world of unpopulated beaches awaits. Fishing, diving, boating, and camping are all big draws. The area’s rich Maori culture is also an excellent introduction to New Zealand’s history. The Coromandel Peninsula is a slightly more rugged version of Northland. It has a craggier coastline, a more remote landscape, and sections with very poor roads. Accommodations are middling to say the least (with a few exceptions). Still, there’s color and character here, and it’s long been a favorite with New Zealand campers and beach bunnies—especially the eastern side of the peninsula, where you’ll find some top surf beaches.

The Waitomo Caves have traditionally been the area’s biggest attraction, and although their natural splendor is undeniable, I find Waitomo a rather depressing place—a strange hive of tourist buses, darting in and out of otherwise undisturbed farmland. The Bay of Plenty, on the other hand, has come of age. Tauranga and Mount Maunganui have always been hot spots. Again, the emphasis is on a beach lifestyle—boating, fishing, surfing, sunbathing, and golf are the main attractions—and some stunning accommodations are available. If you’ve been to Australia’s Gold Coast, you’ll sense a hint of that style here. ROTORUA , TAUPO & TONGARIRO NATIONAL PARK Rotorua is on almost every visitor’s hit list. Some would say that makes the area objectionably touristy. I don’t agree. Rotorua has spent millions refining its attractions and accommodations, of which there are many, and it offers a unique geographic and Maori cultural slice of New Zealand life. In terms of adventure tourism, it is biting at the heels of Queenstown. Taupo and Tongariro National Park, in combination with Rotorua, make the whole central region an unbeatable value in terms of volcanic landscape and adventure variety. And the area is plenty big enough to avoid being bothered by others. (It’s away from key attractions.) Come here for volcanic and Maori attractions, the world’s best trout fishing, mountaineering, skiing (water and snow), mountain biking, and tramping. GISBORNE & HAWKES BAY This is one of the most underrated areas of the country. East Cape and Gisborne offer a rare insight into Maori culture, free of tourist\n\nhype. The area has amazing beaches and world-class surfing conditions, and, in combination with Hawkes Bay, is probably the country’s most important wine-producing region. In terms of accommodations, Gisborne is definitely lacking, and its laid-back rural approach doesn’t always find favor with visitors. Hawkes Bay, on the other hand, has the best range of boutique B&Bs and cottages in the country. Napier’s Art Deco charms are legendary and definitely worthy of inspection. TARANAKI & WANGANUI What can I say that won’t instantly alienate me from the local city councils? Let’s put it this way—if you want the best of small-town, provincial New Zealand, this is it. I’m most drawn to Taranaki. New Plymouth is surprisingly vibrant in its own right, and you can’t help but feel that, stuck out here on its own western limb, it couldn’t care less about the rest of the country. Mount Egmont and the sea are big attractions for trampers and surfers, and the region’s gardens are stunning. And Tom Cruise seemed to like the area when he was filming The Last Samurai. Wanganui has a major asset in its river, but it needs to spruce up accommodations. WELLINGTON The capital has come alive in almost every aspect. Te Papa Tongarewa–The Museum of New Zealand is, of course, a major attraction and has been built with style and flair. Once you have explored it, you will understand more clearly much of what you have seen, or are about to see, throughout the country. Wellington is also home to several national cultural companies, so you’ll find a rich performing arts program. In addition, its restaurant, nightlife, and shopping opportunities are many and varied. And don’t overlook the vineyard and craft delights of the Wairarapa , where you’ll find the biggest selection\n\nTHE REGIONS IN BRIEF\n\nof stunning rural cottages in New Zealand.\n\nTHE SOUTH ISLAND NELSON & MARLBOROUGH The best year-round climate in New Zealand can be found here. Characterized by three stunning national parks and gorgeous beaches, Nelson is often talked about with a mix of derision and envy for its alternative, slightly hippie/artsy communities. A top region to visit if you’re into arts and crafts and outdoor pursuits. And for oenophiles, there’s a growing pocket of wineries that, in combination with the Marlborough wine region, make it a must-see destination. Both areas have some superb B&Bs, home stays, and backpacker accommodations. CHRISTCHURCH & CANTERBURY After Auckland, Christchurch is the second major destination for overseas tourists. Quite apart from the fact that it is the primary starting point for South Island exploration, Christchurch is loved for its fine Victorian-Gothic architecture, its hints of old England, and its increasingly vibrant city lifestyle. It has several ski fields within a 2-hour drive, good surfing beaches, and over 35 wineries. Day trips to Hanmer, Kaikoura, Akaroa, and Methven are all popular, but each of them warrants a longer stay. WEST COAST & THE GLACIERS The top of the West Coast, from Westport north to Karamea, and the south, from Haast to the glaciers, are quite remarkable. It’s just a pity about the middle bit. Apart from greenstone shopping and the crazy Hokitika Wild Foods Festival, I can never find much to recommend in the central part of the West Coast. But I will concede that it has played a vigorous and important role in shaping New Zealand’s history and economy, and you certainly won’t find anything quite like it elsewhere.\n\n21\n\nQUEENSTOWN & ENVIRONS For sheer physical impact, this southwestern portion of New Zealand is utterly unbeatable. It’s easy to understand why everyone flocks here at least once. Don’t be put off by this nonsense about Queenstown being “too touristy.” It is a recognized international tourist resort, for goodness sake, so of course there will be lots of tourists! It has a long-standing reputation for being a work-hard, play-hard, party-hard sort of a place, and as far as I’m concerned, the more the merrier. Milford Sound is another matter entirely. It is simply stunning, but the excessive number of buses (over 50 a day) is quite disgusting and should be reduced to make it a better experience for everyone. It is a remote wilderness area, but it’s hard to sense that with 3,000 other people standing around looking at the same mountain peak! Wanaka has a much more lowkey personality than Queenstown. It makes a beautiful stopover between Queenstown and the West Coast. You’ll find some stunning lodges and B&Bs here. DUNEDIN , SOUTHLAND & STEWART ISLAND Invercargill and Southland are sleepy, slow, incredibly friendly, and very, very green, but not that well prepared for the visitor. Dunedin is simply gorgeous, very Gothic, and in winter, very grim. But as a summer destination, it’s lovely and has lots to offer the wildlife lover. Get out onto Otago Peninsula and be prepared to have your breath taken away. It also has some handsome B&B and lodge-style accommodations in the most amazing old houses. Farther south, the Catlins Coast and Stewart Island are remarkably unspoiled by anything—especially tourism. I’m almost loath to mention either for fear of instigating a mass\n\n22\n\nC H A P T E R 2 . P L A N N I N G YO U R T R I P TO N E W Z E A L A N D\n\ninflux of visitors, but good old Kiwi pride gets in the way, and I can’t help\n\nboasting about these two truly magical destinations.\n\n2 Visitor Information To get started, contact the nearest New Zealand Tourism Board for a complimentary copy of its New Zealand Vacation Planner.

Note: The $750 exemption can only be used once a year and only after an absence of 7 days. For a clear summary of Canadian rules, write for the booklet I Declare, issued by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (& 800/ 461-9999 in Canada, or 204/9833500; www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca). U.K. citizens returning from a nonEU country have a customs allowance of: 200 cigarettes; 50 cigars; 250 grams of smoking tobacco; 2 liters of still table wine; 1 liter of spirits or strong liqueurs (over 22% volume); 2 liters of fortified wine, sparkling wine, or other liqueurs; 60cc (ml) perfume;\n\n250cc (ml) of toilet water; and £145 worth of all other goods, including gifts and souvenirs. People under 17 cannot have the tobacco or alcohol allowance.

There are coin denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents and $1 and $2, as well as banknotes in $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 amounts. Traveler’s checks are easily converted to cash at banks, many hotels, some restaurants, duty-free stores, and currency converters, but they’re less necessary now that most towns and cities have ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as needed. You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank, or by calling American Express (& 800/221-7282), Visa (& 800/732-1322, or 866/3393378 for AAA members), or MasterCard (& 800/223-9920). If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are stolen or lost.\n\nMost ATM cards are compatible with New Zealand systems. The Bank of New Zealand accepts ATM cards in the Cirrus system (& 800/424-7787; www.mastercard.com); other banks accept cards in the Plus system (& 800/843-7587; www.visa.com). Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then call or check online for ATM locations in New Zealand. Be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart, and remember that many banks impose a fee every time a card is used at a different bank’s ATM (this fee can be higher for international transactions). The most convenient, of course, are your credit cards. Most New Zealand businesses take MasterCard and Visa. American Express, Diners Club, Bankcard, and Japan Credit Bank are also widely accepted in major tourist centers, but less so in smaller towns.\n\nMONEY\n\n25\n\nail).\n\nThe New Zealand Dollar, the U.S. Dollar & the British Pound\n\nFor U.S. readers: At this writing, $1 = approximately NZ$1.70, and this was the rate of exchange used to calculate the dollar values given in this book (rounded up to the nearest nickel).

You can also get cash advances on your credit card at an ATM. Keep in mind that credit card companies try to protect themselves\n\nfrom theft by limiting the funds someone can withdraw outside their home country, so call your credit card company before you leave home. Also be sure that you know your PIN (call your company to request yours, allowing at least a week for it to arrive by mail).\n\n5 When to Go New Zealand is in the Southern Hemisphere; therefore, all seasons are the opposite of those in North America, Europe, and other Northern Hemisphere locations. There really isn’t a bad time to travel to New Zealand. Keep in mind, though, that most Kiwi families take their main annual holidays between mid-December and the end of January, which puts enormous pressure on accommodations in major summer beach destinations. During the Easter break and school holidays in April, June to July, and September to October (see “Holidays,” below, for exact dates), it also pays to reserve well in advance.\n\nRemember, too, that accommodations at ski destinations, especially Queenstown, fill up quickly—reserve early and be prepared to pay higher winter rates. In most other areas, though, you’ll be paying lower rates during the winter months (Apr–Aug). In some summer-peak areas, the winter also means that tour, lodge, and adventure operators may take advantage of lower tourist numbers and take their own holiday breaks, closing their businesses for 1- to 3-month periods.\n\nTHE WEATHER New Zealand’s climate, especially by Northern Hemisphere standards, is\n\n26\n\nC H A P T E R 2 .

You’ll find a far greater seasonal difference in the South Island than in the subtropical North, and don’t believe anyone who says it never gets cold here or that there are no extremes. In Central Otago, winter temperatures are often 14°F (–10°C) and sometimes as low as –4°F (–20°C), with summers up to 100°F to 104°F (38°C–40°C). By comparison, the northern part of the North Island is subtropical. That means lots of winter/ spring rain, often daily light showers. The west coast of the South Island can get up to 100 inches or more of rain a year on its side of the Southern Alps, while just over the mountains to the east, rainfall is a moderate 20 to 30 inches annually. Rain is also heavier on\n\nthe west coast of the North Island, averaging 40 to 70 inches annually. Milford Sound, though, beats the lot; it’s the wettest place in the country, with a phenomenal 365 inches of rain a year.\n\nTHE SEASONS SPRING (Sept, Oct, Nov) This is a beautiful time to visit—the countryside is flush with new green grass, baby lambs, and blooming trees. Christchurch in the spring means blossoms, bluebells, and daffodils in abundance; Dunedin is a splurge of rhododendron color. The weather can still be very changeable right up to mid-October, so come prepared with light rain gear. In the South Island, it’s still perfectly normal to get late snowfalls in September.\n\nNew Zealand’s Average Temperature & Rainfall Temperatures reflected are daily average (°C/°F).

Book early to avoid disappointment—this also applies to the major walking tracks, such as Milford, for which you should make bookings 6 months ahead. Beaches all over the country come alive, and boaties flock to the water. Fresh fruits are falling off the trees. (You must try Central Otago cherries and apricots; the apple district is Hawkes Bay.) And everyone should see Central Otago when the lupines are flowering, with brilliant colors etched against blue skies and golden tussock. AUTUMN (Mar, Apr, May) Personally, I think the best time to visit is February through April. The temperatures are pleasant (still hot in Feb in most parts), and even in April you’ll be wearing summer clothes in the upper North Island. The most spectacular autumn colors are found in Queenstown, Central Otago, and Christchurch. Keep Easter and April school holidays in mind, though, when accommodations may be tight in some areas. WINTER (June, July, Aug) If you’re a skier, you’ll be heading to Queenstown, Mount Hutt, Canterbury, or the Central Plateau in the North Island—and paying top dollar for the privilege. Otherwise, if you travel elsewhere during this period, you won’t need to pre-book much at all (except during the July school holidays). You’ll find some excellent rates—just don’t expect great things from the weather.\n\nHOLIDAYS National public holidays include New Year’s Day (Jan 1), New Year’s\n\nSummer Fall Invercargill Max.

Kiwi families do much of their traveling during these periods, so be sure to reserve early.\n\nNEW ZEALAND CALENDAR OF EVENTS More information can be found in the regional chapters that follow and by going to the New Zealand Tourism Board website at www.purenz.com.\n\nJanuary\n\nASB Bank Tennis Classic, Auckland.
