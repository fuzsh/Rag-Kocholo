I’m in USA, west coast, Pacific standard time. My schedule is flexible so please message me if your interested!\n\nHi Craig. My name is Paul and I live in Pittsburgh, so Eastern Daylight Time. I am rated 1155 on Lichess Unlimited and 881 on Lichess Rapid. I do not play Blitz. I have played all my life off & on from age 11 and have not progressed much until I found Chessmood about a little over a year ago. I LOVE it, because the ChessMood White and Black courses are just what I was looking for. I had been bouncing around trying various openings and defenses with no guidance except books. I have loved studying for years, but would have proressed more had I been playing more and studying less. Couln’t find partners, and it was before I was aware of online games. Tried correspondance years ago but got really REALLY bored. As you can see by my ratings, I am not strong. Always found myself tied up in the opening and not being able to get to a decent middle game. But thanks to Avetik, now I know a lot more about how to meet what I will face in both one White and one Black opening. I have been mostly thru the Whitemood and well into Blackmood openings, and just need more play to help remember them. I have been able to hold my own on chess.com against 1100, 1200 & 1300 bots, if not always winning. Still blundering. I love Anna Crammling training vids on YouTube. Have also generally won maybe 1 out of 3 games with a friend on line in Columbus, Ohio who is a little over 1500 . I have gotten up enough confidence to start playing in a local informal club whose members seem to be nostly 1500 & above.Feel like I can hold my own until I blunder because I don’t remember far enough into my Scotch Game or Dutch Attack.\n\nSo I would really appreciate being able to play both sides of those games with a sparing partner wo has patience with my stumbling. I am retired, so can play almost anytime, except for some days when I have to to take my wife or myself to meical appts. So the evening seems most consistently best for me except for a committee meeting I have on the last Tuesday night of every month. So after about 7:15 pm EDT looks like it would work for me. Also spotty times throughout some afternoons. I asume you are still working.Sorry this has been so rambling, Craig, but I wanted to give you as complete a picture as posible of my chess background. Where would we spar? Lichess or Chess.com or elsewhere? Do you want to chat further about your chess experiences or sparing?

Thanks in advance!\n\nChessMood PRO Members\n\nHello champions and welcome to the ChessMood team!\n\nWe all are from different countries, different ages, have different professions... But one thing bounds us - the passion for chess.\n\nChampions, we'll grow together and keep a warm relationship in our team.\n\nPlease tell a bit about yourself in this post.\n\n#ChessMood_Family\n\nReplies\n\nOkay, I'll be first :)\n\nI am GM Avetik Grigoryan.\n\nI have born on 27.01.1989 in Armenia. My father had a big passion for chess (he has 2400 in chess.com) and when I was 4, my father went to the war...\n\nThat time my Grandma taught me to play chess...\n\nEventually, with some magic, I became a GM :)\n\nAt 22, being at my top rating 2623, I stopped playing professional chess and started a career as a professional chess coach.\n\nI have been the coach of Thailand's national team (2017-2018) and trained many Grandmasters.\n\nIn 2019 I founded ChessMood and it was one of the best things I've done in my life.\n\nKnowing many of you personally, I would miss a lot, not knowing you.\n\nDream - To create the best educational chess platform and help you to pursue your goals and dreams.\n\nGood luck to us :)\n\nHi everyone, I am Roger, 60 years old from Levanger, in the middle of nowhere... ahh... Norway...\n\nI love chess, to follow tournaments on TV and web, to play in my club and on the net. I should spend more time learning than playing, but as you know... (and my old brain doesn't take som much anymore).\n\nI started playing when I was around 10 years old. And quit at age of 15. Had a short intermezzo around 22 - 24 years old, and started again at the age of 52 (or something). I love (too much) the aggressive chess. Always looking for the opportunity of a mate.... (Then you understand my results ... yes about 50/50)\n\nMy rating on Lichess is around 1850 (on a good day), and I always dream to raise. Make plans and start the study. (Just now it's the Benko). Suddenly down again, and try to build up... Ups and downs... that's my chess life.\n\nI met Avetik in Armenia in March 2019 and became Pro Member and a good friend. I stayed there for 11 weeks last year, and Avetik, Ani and me were neighbors in Komitas, Jerevan. I had one other friend of Avetik, Tigran, as my coach when I was staying there. I get a lot of opportunities to grow my chess, but drinking beer, meet and talk to people, listen to the lovely Armenian music and live in a lovely country took the most of my time. But this was a very, very good experience, and I met and became friends with a lot of the GMs behind Chessmood.\n\nI work as an editor for a local newspaper (innherred.no), live with my lovely wife Hege and together we have seven kids and three grandkids (soon it will be five).\n\nI call Chessmood my second family. I call Armenia my second homeland. Hope to meet the family there one day. I am sure that will be a great experience.\n\nHi everyone - I joined ChessMood about 6 months ago, and I'm really enjoying it, and learning huge amounts. I'm 59 and live in London.\n\nI started to play chess around 18 years old, but bogged down at around 1800 for many years. Started to work more seriously on my chess about 15 years ago, with intermittent bursts of activity. In the last few years, I have slowly improved to get above 2000, and I want to get up to 2200 as chess is going to be my main hobby in my upcoming retirement!\n\nI'm Hunan, 31 years old, working as a programmer in San Francisco. I have always enjoyed playing chess, but never taken it seriously. I started spending more time playing in May of this year and have been improving very slowly, trying to keep the pieces together, trying not to blunder, trying to learn to think (around 1200 on chess.com at the moment).\n\nI had noticed \"Chessmood\" on top player handles on chess.com, so I was intrigued what it is. I found an interview of GM Avetik by our own Jay Garrison and I learned about the mission and the approach. If you have had any interaction with Avetik, you immediately get the sense that his passion and his dedication are on another level.\n\nI look forward to hearing about you all. We needed this thread!\n\nI'm Peter, a 44 year old Austrian currently living in San Francisco. I played my first rated game at 14 and was an active tournament player in my high school and college years. For ten years I offered weekly free chess training for kids and coached our biggest talents at national competitions. Since turning 30, I've only played national league (~10 games per year), and my chess has mostly stagnated. In 2015 I moved to the US and haven't played OTB chess since then. My (inactive) FIDE rating is 2210.\n\nChessMood has inspired me to set myself a new goal: to become an FM strength player in all phases of the game. The first step in this journey was to switch to 1.e4, a move I hadn't played in almost 30 years. :-)\n\nI am a lawyer in New York. I lived in Brooklyn for many years, but I now live in a small town about 1 1/2 hours north of the City.\n\nI started playing in tournaments in college. Played over many random games in books and watched many videos but nothing ever seemed to help. Never had a coach or formal training.\n\nI played tournaments at the Marshall CC but quit years ago when work and family took all of my time. I played Kamsky, Epishin, Benko, Lombardy and others in tournaments and blitz. Karpov might be the nicest player I ever met.\n\nMy rating fluctuates wildly online from 2000 to 2450 depending on the site but I’m rated 2110 OTB. I am the biggest sore loser online but a perfect gentleman OTB. :)\n\nSo far, I’m very satisfied with chessmood and I’ve done some studying on it every day. I feel like I’m improving. We’ll see!\n\nI forgot to mention that I discovered Chessmood after I started to watch the 100 Classical Games. Instructive and highly recommended.\n\nHi fellow ChessMood Pro Members,\n\nI only recently joined ChessMood as a Pro Member. This seems like a really nice and inspiring community. I am 53 years old and live in Düsseldorf, Germany. I am married and have two teenage children. I am a qualified lawyer and work full time as a law professor. I learned chess as a teenager and played casually. I stopped playing after a few years, turning to computer and video games.\n\nI restarted playing chess in 2007. My training was unsystematic: I bought a lot of books, started many, but finished none. I also regularly watched the coverage of top tournaments. My rating then was around 1300 in classical on ICC and around 1600 in correspondence on chess.com.\n\nAt the end of 2010, I stopped playing again, but restarted briefly between 2012 and 2014. My correspondence rating peaked at 1693, my bltz rating on chess.com was around 1000. In 2018, I made another restart, motivated by the Perpetual Chess Podcast. For more than two years, I practiced daily, mainly doing spaced repetition. I bought numerous courses on Chessable, at least finishing a few, like 1001 Chess Tactics for Beginners, Free Scandinavian and Icelandic Gambit. I also started the Yusupov series, but still have not finished the first book. In July, I became a member of a local chess club, where I had played an open OTB tournament at the beginning of the year until Corona put an end to OTB chess. My lichess classical rating is now around 1800, my chess.com correspondence rating is around 1750 and my blitz rating on lichess is around 1520. I hope that ChessMood will bring me to the next level and beyond! My long term goal is to reach 2000 FIDE, 2300 Classical and 2000 Blitz on lichess.\n\nI look forward to play and chat with you all!\n\nHello ChessMood family!\n\nMy Name is Jay Garrison, I am 47 years old and live near Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nWhen I was 4 years old, my father taught me to play checkers. By the time I was 5, I was winning every game and he decided he would teach me a tougher game: Chess. By the age of 7 I was winning every game of chess against him and any of my fathers friends he could bait into playing me.\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn't much of a chess scene near where I grew up, and didn't play much growing up. When I would play a game against my friends, I would win easily, and they wouldn't want to play any more. So the game of chess was just a novelty to me, that I thought I could beat anyone any time, and didn't pursue it seriously. Instead, I pursued American rules football. At the age of 22, I suffered an injury that ended my football career before it really started. (I was invited to training camp for the Arizona Rattles - an Arena football team - but got hurt just a couple weeks before I got to camp, so never played)\n\nI was seeking an outlet for my competitive spirit after my injury when I saw a movie called Searching for Bobby Fischer. I thought, hey, I am really, really good at chess, I will go do that! So I looked up a local chess club and went to play. I ran into a room of experts and masters, and as you can imagine, I lost every game. I couldn't believe it! I didn't ever lose at chess, yet it happened! So the next day I went to the library and borrowed a book on chess - Bruce Pandalfini's Weapons of Chess. I played in my first tournament a couple months later and received a rating of 1422.\n\nThen I moved to a small town that didn't have any chess, and as a young father of 2 boys, I couldn't afford to travel to tournaments, and chess was set aside so I could pursue a career and raise my family. In 1997 I moved to the Phoenix area and found a local club and was playing once a week. Then in 1999 I played several tournaments and reached a rating of 1600+ USCF, but then earned a promotion at work that once again kept me from playing.\n\nI didn't come back to the game until 2014, when I took a part time position with a local club to go into schools and teach chess as an after school program. (One of the most rewarding things I have ever done! I love working with the kids teaching them chess!) I played a couple tournaments, including the 2015 US Open that was held here in Phoenix and got my rating over 1700 USCF, but every time I would get close to 1800, I would slip back down. For several years I was stuck in the 1700's and finally gave up on improving, and walked away from chess again.\n\nThen @GM_Avetik_Grigoryan came into my life. In 2018 I was invited into a Facebook group by Coach. I didnt think much of it, and didnt really participate much other then reading a few posts by others. Then a post was made that peaked my interest (I dont even remember what the post was anymore) and I made a reply that caught Coach's attention, and he sent me a private message thanking me for my answer to the post. I could tell he was sincere and it struck up a private conversation between us that ended in forging a friendship that will last a lifetime.\n\nWhen ChessMood launched in early 2019, I signed up right away. I decided to give myself one more chance to improve my game. I remember my 1:1 call with Coach when I signed up and how he listened to my goals (At the time I wanted to reach master) and how he asked me \"why\" I wanted that, and then helped me lay out a plan to achieve it.\n\nThen 2 months later, while on my evening walk (I was watching opening videos as I walked hehe) I got a huge sense that I was supposed to do more. I immediately reached out to Coach and asked him if he could meet with me, as I had a question for him. He set aside time for me the next day (I still am in awe at how freely Coach gives back to us all, and makes me want to be just like that!) and I told him of my premonition: I am going to be a GM, will you coach me? He didn't laugh at me, he didn't say people my age cant reach that level, he only asked me 1 question: Why? And after I gave him my whys, he said, \"Lets make history!\"\n\nAnd here I am! In the last year and a half, my online ratings have increased 300+ points, with 2000+ on LiChess. My OTB at first took a dip, back to about 1650 before shooting up to over 1800! We are postponed on reaching 2000+ only because of a lack of OTB tournaments, but I know we will crash right by that when we can get active again!\n\nChessMood is my second family, and I can not wait till we all get to meet up and play chess and drink beer together! #RightMoodRightMove #COGRO\n\nHi Family!\n\nMy name is Sergio Carrera. I am 48 and I was born and live in Madrid (Spain). I am married and have a 5 year-old child. I work for a large IT Company.\n\nI started playing chess online in December 2018 (I already knew how to move the pieces because I had been taught when I was a kid). I did not know any opening, so I bought and started reading the following books that I saw recommended in Internet and began to play the very first moves of those openings, against virtually anything and without really understanding them:\n\n- 1.d4 Repertoire, by Boris Avrukh\n\n- Chess Openings for Black, by Lev Alburt\n\nThen I bought \"Reassess your Chess\", by Jeremy Silman and I read it in a few days and I fell in love with Chess and in April 2019 I played my first OTB tournament and in June 2019 I joined a local club. Currently, I am 1320 elo FIDE and 1650 on chess.com and 1970 on lichess and I would really love to improve, and I am commited to improve.\n\nMy job is very demanding, so I decided I could not invest more than 10-15 hours a week without taking too much time from my family. With that in mind, my short-term goal is to achieve 1500 elo FIDE by March 2022 and 2000 elo FIDE by March 2027.\n\nI joined Chessmood last July and it has been the best chess-oriented decision I have made.\n\nWe will grow together!\n\nHello All,\n\nI am Sadkrith and I just turned 13 in July,2020. I live near Chicago(100 miles approx.) and currently in grade 8.\n\nI started learning Chess from my Dad when I was around 6. Chessmood happened around 8 months ago when my Dad subscribed to the Pro membership. The immediate change thereafter was to switch to 1. e4 from 1.d4 that I was playing. I am thoroughly enjoying the game and dream to be a GM + Cardiologist. My Lichess & Chess.com ratings are around 2200 and 2000 respectively.\n\nCoach Avetik & GM Gabuzyan have enriched my understanding of chess and hope to see the positive results OTB.\n\nHi everyone, I’m relatively new here as I became a pro member just a couple weeks ago. I’m 38, living in Brooklyn New York with my wife and 6 year old daughter and 2 dogs. My dad taught me chess when I was young, but I didn’t really do much until college when I joined the chess team there and got a uscf rating of around 1700. After college I kind of dropped chess since I didn’t have time for it. About a year or two ago I started to get back into it. Unfortunately I still don’t really have time for otb tournaments, but I’ve been playing on lichess and chess.com where I’ve reached a high of 2150 on lichess. I’ve taken a bit of a hit the past couple weeks trying to switch to e4 and learning all the new stuff but I’m sure things will start trending in the right direction after some study since Avetik does a great job of explaining things.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nmy Name is Michael, I am 55 years old, married and live in Berlin. Its funny how non-linear my chess development has been in hindsight.\n\nAt age 9 or 10, I had to stay at my uncles place for a few weeks. In the basement I found a chess book (Laszlo Orban: Schach für Anfänger) started to read and was immediately hooked. A few days later I played my uncle but he beat me with the scholar's mate every time. So I went back into the basement to finished the book. At the end of my stay I still lost, but the games went at least a bit longer. Back at home, I had no access to a chess club and my father did not liked chess at all, so I showed my brother how to play. The local library had two chess books (one d4 opening book and Simon Webb´s Chess for Tigers) which I read several times. I coached my brother to level him up as a sparring partner. Unfortunately after a few years my brother lost interest and stopped playing.\n\n19 years old during my time at the air force I started playing again. I found some chess fans and during some boring march etc. we played blindfold chess. After my service I studied architecture and joined at a chess club in Munich. I played regularly until the late 90´s (about 1800 - 1900 Fide). Then my professional work took overhand and I changed city's (as well as countries) a few times. The result was that for the next 20 years I only played a handful tournament games.\n\nSince last year I am kind of semi retired and chess became finally the place in my life that it deserved. My Fide rating is 1911, Lichess is about 2000 (bliz, rapid and classical).\n\nFor the first time I work regular on my chess improvement and enjoy the process. I am happy to have found Chessmood and this nice community of like minded people.\n\nI am WIM Siranush Ghukasyan from Armenia, Yerevan\n\nI was born on 25.11.1998. My uncle is a huge fan of chess and he always wished me to grow and become a good chess player. I've started studying and playing chess when I was 6, but I knew how pieces move when I was at the age of 4, and I've learned it from him.\n\nAt first, I hated chess because I thought this game is not girly :D\n\nBut when you start to play games and feel the pleasure of victory, it is impossible not to be in love with chess :)\n\nMy international rating is 2222.\n\nMy goal for now: I'm WIM since 2016 and my next step is to become a WGM (I have one WGM norm)\n\nBig thanks to GM Avetik for ChessMood and for his devotion to helping us to reach our goals.\n\nHi I am Till. I am one of the old geezers here (55). I started chess at 15, got to about 2200 (mostly tactics, but no real understanding) when if was in my early 20s, stopped because I got excited about maths, moved to Japan, got excited about Shogi, stopped, got serious about physics and programming, .... You get the picture.\n\nNow I play correspondence chess and online bullet to relax but a few years ago got a bit more serious again about studying chess at the site of one of chessmood's competitors. I discovered chessmood when all courses were unlocked. I wasn't sure about joining for a while since I really don't have any chess-related goals besides having fun, but then I decided it is time to fill some of the gaps in my general chess education and I liked the selection of topics here.\n\nHello, Chessmood family.\n\nI am Susanna (Susik) Gaboyan. I was born on 25.08.1996 in Armenia / Yerevan, currently I live in Russia / Moscow.\n\nBefore I wrote about me I was reading about all of you, and this sentence killed me \"Even though we have the risk that it sounds a bit like a meeting of Alcoholics anonymous, let's proceed with the introductions...\" by @Edo_Tokyo :D :D\n\nOk this is about me. I started playing chess when I was 6 years old. My brother went to chess classes, once I sat with him and looked how he trains. He taught me some basic stuffs like how to set up position, how to move pieces, the next time my mom and I went together to pick him up from the class, his coach saw me and gave me several puzzles (mate in 1), I could easily solve them, then he told my mom that I'm very \"talented\" :D and from the next class also to bring me to classes, I started my trainings and the next year, when I was 7 years old, I became a Vice-Champion of Armenia U10. Then the journey began :D\n\nI have participated in many international events, World and European championships. I am now 24 years old, Women international master (WIM), FIDE rating: 2211, and my goal at the moment is to become a Women grandmaster (WGM).\n\nI am very happy to have chosen chess, not because only chess is cool, but mainly because I got so many nice friends and I have so many incredible memories.\n\nChessmood became my second family, I know @GM_Avetik_Grigoryan from an early age, probably around 16 years, but of course we were not close friends because he was older than me :D\n\nHe's just an amazing person, very purposeful, friendly, kind, positive etc. I think who knows him personally can approve of this. I am so happy that he was able to create this coolest chess arena and unite all people from all over the world.\n\nI look forward to achieve my goals with Chessmood and wish you all the best.\n\nWE CAN DO IT !\n\nHello everyone\n\nMy name is Jamie, I am 40 years old and live in England. I work full time as a poker professional and coach, so luckily I am a little more flexible with time than most people despite having a family.\n\nI played chess when I was a teenager up until my mid twenties, until I discovered poker really. I was never particularly good at the game. I think I was just shy of 1950 elo or something. We have a weird BCF system in the UK (which is now changing to elo also) so the conversion is somewhat tricky.\n\nI started again on and off playing bad blitz/bullet for the last few years, with sporadic attempts to get somewhere near the average level I used to be. A few months ago I played a correspondence game with a friend and i rediscovered how rich chess is when you have some time.\n\nI decided that I wanted to take chess somewhat seriously again and be competitive over the board. I took a lesson with a IM who outlined some very good ideas for improvement which revolves mainly around endgame and classical middle game studies.\n\nI found chessmood via a friend who suggested I check out the perpetual chess podcast. I did, it sounded interesting so I checked out the site and watched a few free videos. I loved that the scotch was being proposed as this is one of the main openings I was planning to learn.\n\nI signed up and following the blog on openings, memorizing, what time controls to play etc have already seen some solid improvement (in the one opening I know!).\n\nGreat site and great people, I already met a study partner (shout out to Marc!) and did my 1-1 call with GM Avetik. He approved and improved my plan already a little bit and I also found out he used to play poker also!\n\nI posted in the study partner thread already but if anyone wants to train please let me know. I am game as they say!\n\nHi everyone\n\nI am Shahinur Haque , 37yrs old from Bangladesh. I have one kid near about 5yrs, he is a boy. In my early childhood i used to play chess regularly. Chess was my passion. My story of learning chess is little bit similar to the legendary Capablanca. At the age of 6 or 7 in front of my village house there was small grocery shop which was run by one of my cousin. At the evening at their leisure time two of my cousin used to play chess. I just learn from them and started beat them within next few days very easily. I am not sure how it was possible, may be they were very weak player. Then my father shift with us to a small town for my better education. Until completing the school i used to play chess regularly and win some school competition.\n\nIn the mean time i have completed my graduation in medical science and become a doctor in my country and started my job in a research organization. Then it was 2017 ; i was in Japan for 6 month at Osaka University in a fellowship program . The program was easy and i had enough free time for myself. Moreover for the first in my life i was truly alone. Then i took an online course it was about how to find out the one thing in life. After this long course in conclusion i discovered that Chess is the one thing of my life. Then i come back my country and started to play competitive chess. That time i didn't have any FIDE rating. After my first tournament in 2018 i got FIDE ID and rating as well. Now my OTB FIDE rating is 1641 and online rating is around 1900 at lee chess. Now a days besides my Job and other family responsibilities i use my maxim time in practicing chess. During Covid-19 pandemic i knew about Chessmood through social media. And i become the PRO member and i am glad that i become part of chess mood family. I want to continue my chess growth and become a chess master within next 5 years.\n\nNamaste every one. I am Tanmoy. I had born on 14/04/1989, same age as our head coach Avetik. I had learn Indian rule chess from my father and grand father at the age near 5. Later at the age 12-13 I had learn the international rules which is a little different from Indian rule chess. I always want to learn chess from a professional coach. But in my area there was nothing about chess. From my college life, when I get a computer and start playing chess against computer. 2 years ago I had joined chess.com and started to think chess seriously. My two dreams was to become a math professor and a fide titled player. My first dream was achieved last year. Now I have focused on my second dream. I have joined ChessMood pro team in April, this year and my rating is increased from 1300 to 1700+ in chess.com Blitz. So I feel I am going towards my dream.\n\nAlso I wish to grow our ChessMood family bigger and bigger and one day come out an world champion from our ChessMood family.\n\nWish you all the best.\n\nHi, my name is courtney, I am 33, from ohio in the USA, and have played chess as a hobby since age 5, but never competitively other than a few tournaments when I was a kid. I did play in a chess team in high school and a chess club in college, but it was pretty casual. I am rated about 1500 or 1600, but I always thought it would be fun to try and reach expert level, so that is my goal. I work as a doctor, and for fun I do chess and card tricks.\n\nThanks,\n\nCourtney\n\nMy name is Mateo Jackson. I am 10 years old. I was born in Vancouver, BC Canada but now live in Alberta. I am in grade 5.\n\nI have been playing chess for 2 years. I am really happy to be part of Chessmood. My goal is to be a GM. I started playing in tournaments in 2019 but due to Covid there has been nothing but online. My chess.com rating is 1600.\n\nI am working really hard to get these openings solid! I am excited about the club on Lichess to practice.\n\nHi!\n\nI'm Tiago, from Portugal. I'm 41 and expecting my second son in a few days. I was born in Oporto in a family with a few chess enthusiasts: my father learned chess from a magazine and teached some brothers.\n\nMy father, who is around 1500, teached me the rules and one day, when I was 11, one of his brothers, who joined a chess club, invited me to go there too. I played there until college, but never got any formal training.\n\nAfter college (I’m another chessmoodie for “team law”) me and some friends started our own chess club, mostly devoted to kids. It had some interesting results (we had about 50 members and won two youth national rapid championship) but ended abruptly: my friend who had the idea and was the man behind the scene had a fatal disease since birth which came to an end, and although we kept the club for a couple of years after his death, live changed for the rest of us too.\n\nFor me it was a carreer change: i made the public tender to enter the judiciary and moved to Lisbon. I had a classmate who i knew from my youth national championships and we put a chess set at the school bar. We got a few other players and when we moved to our internship, in a city called Braga (northern Portugal) we started a very serious chess club called APAXES en passant. APAXES was a word play with apaches and the initials of Almoçaradas, Passeatas, Aventuras, Xadrez, Estadias e Salgadinhos, something like Lunches, Tours, Adventures, Chess, Stays and Appetizers... we even made a theorical novelty: “dessert gambit”, when we skiped the first round after lunch, to eat well and get a lower opponent in the second afternoon round!\n\nWhen internship was over, we all went to different courts in different cities. It is now 2012 and I was placed in Loulé (in Algarve, southern Portugal) and i started playing here. Chess is not very developed in Algarve (no more than 80 players in 4 clubs) so i started playing in a club in Spain too, in Ayamonte, right after the border (+- 80kms away).\n\nDuring this period, i got some formal training and played more games than i used to. I think my understanding of the game got deeper but my FIDE elo has been always around 1900, although with some ocasional good results (U2000 Canada Open 2014, Algarve Regional Championship 2016/2017 and our team (Loulé ++ www.facebook.com/xadrezloule) got from Algarve Championship to Portugal Division 2. I guess it is true that knowing chess is not the same as playing it, as our coach says.\n\nLast year i started a 3 year program to teach Tax Litigation in Lisbon, at judiciary school, so my life has been between Loulé (family) and Lis"
