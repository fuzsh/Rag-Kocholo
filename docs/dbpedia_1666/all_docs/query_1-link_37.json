        "text": "This article first appeared in Chess Life (October 1996) and is\n\nreprinted courtesy of Chesstours (c). All rights reserved.\n\nPostcript\n\nAfter this article was written, the author became familiar with a\n\n1991 interview by Max Pan and GM Genna Sosonko. When asked if he\n\nknew of collusion among Soviet players in his heyday, Mikhail\n\nBotvinnik replied: \"At a very high level, it was proposed that the\n\nother Soviet players would lost against me on purpose, in order\n\nto make sure there was going to be a Soviet World Champion. It\n\nwas Stalin himself who proposed this.\"\n\nIn our view, this admission is the SMOKING GUN that confirms much\n\nof the speculation offered below. Enjoy.\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF PAUL KERES\n\nBy GM Larry Evans\n\n\"I must be grateful to Paul Keres. Had it not been for him,\n\nI would have been unable to advance so far in the field of\n\nchess.\" -- Mikhail Botvinnik.\n\n\"As Spassky once put it in a frank reply to a question\n\nat a lecture he gave many years later, Keres was not able to\n\nwin the world title because he had the misfortune to be born\n\nin a small country...Enough said, of course, for a Soviet\n\naudience, who knew that the cream of Baltic society had been\n\ncarried off to the Gulag.\" -- British Chess Magazine.\n\n\"Being in the hands of the Germans at the time of the\n\nFascist occupation of Estonia, I was cut off from Soviet\n\nchess players for a period of nearly four years. Not being\n\nable to refuse to play chess during this occupation, I took\n\npart in five tournaments. Apparently, for this reason the\n\nAll-Union Committee of Physical Culture and Sport does not\n\nconsider it possible to admit me to a tournament for the\n\nUSSR Championship, although in 1941 I was recognized as a\n\nSoviet grandmaster...\" -- Excerpt of letter of April 7, 1945\n\nwith plea from Paul Keres to Vyacheslev Molotov, Stalin's\n\nright hand man, found in secret Soviet archives that were\n\nnot intended to see the light of day.\n\nThe Keres File\n\nPaul Keres (1916-1975) now adorns Estonia's 5-krone bill. He is often regarded\n\nas the best player who was never allowed to become world champion.\n\nMany fans have long suspected the Soviets made him throw games. Newly opened\n\nKGB files support it.\n\nAt a tournament in Holland (AVRO 1938) to determine a challenger for Alexander\n\nAlekhine, Keres tied with America's Reuben Fine ahead of Capablanca, Alekhine,\n\nBotvinnik, Euwe, Reshevsky and Flohr. Then Keres narrowly beat ex-titleholder\n\nEuwe in a match, but he didn't get a shot at the title vacated by the death of\n\nAlekhine in 1946.\n\nBotvinnik was now absolute champion of the Soviet Union (which had swallowed\n\nLatvia, Lithuania and Estonia) and Keres was in trouble for having competed in\n\nNazi-organized tournaments during the war. The KGB wanted to execute Keres for\n\ntreason, and his family was also in peril. His case was examined at the\n\nhighest level in the Kremlin; they let him rejoin his family in Estonia, but\n\nthe price of his reprieve was to abandon his quest for the crown.\n\nWe have since learned that such dirty deals were not uncommon in totalitarian\n\nregimes. In the mid-1970s Alla Kushnir, for example, was allowed to emigrate\n\nto Israel only after she lost three title matches to Nona Gaprindashvili.\n\nKushnir then abandoned her quest for the women's championship. And defector\n\nViktor Korchnoi's family was released from Russia only after he lost two title\n\nmatches to Anatoly Karpov in 1978 and 1981.\n\n\"The first major tournaments in Europe after the war were held in London,\n\nHastings and Groningen,\" recently reported CHESS magazine. \"It was unthinkable\n\nto hold them without Keres, but that is what happened -- because Botvinnik did\n\nnot want him to play.\"\n\nFIDE took control of the crown in 1948 and required the new champ to face a\n\nchallenger every three years. Six players -- three Soviets, three outsiders --\n\nwere invited to play for the title at The Hague and Moscow. Fine declined to\n\nspend three months of his life watching Russians throw games to each other,\n\nwhich left America's Samuel Reshevsky and Dutchman Max Euwe alone in a field\n\nwith Keres, Botvinnik and Vassily Smyslov.\n\nKeres was the favorite, but his lips always remained sealed about his awful\n\nscore against Botvinnik. He lost the first four games and won the fifth only\n\nafter Botvinnik already had enough points to win. Close analysis of these\n\ngames leaves little doubt that Keres was forced to take a dive.\n\nPRAVDA hailed Botvinnik's triumph in 1948 as \"a victory of socialist culture,\"\n\nyet both Smyslov and Keres refused to shake his hand before it began. \"Our\n\nhostility later turned to friendship,\" said Botvinnik in his remarkably frank\n\nmemoirs written 30 years later (ACHIEVING THE AIM).\n\nHistory proved Fine right. In SPORTS ILLUSTRATED Bobby Fischer blasted Soviet\n\nstars for ganging up against him at Curacao 1962. \"I had the best score of\n\nanyone who didn't cheat,\" he said.\n\nThe qualifying cycle was changed to a series of one-on-one matches, but the\n\nUSSR still pulled the strings. For decades their champions enjoyed both a\n\nrematch clause plus draw odds that made it almost impossible for outsiders to\n\ngain the crown.\n\nAt Bled in 1961, when Fischer was 18, he beat Mikhail Tal and Efim Geller,\n\nthen boasted he'd crush all four Russians in the field. \"But Bobby, that's\n\nimpossible,\" teased Keres. \"So far you beat a Latvian and a Ukrainian. That\n\nleaves me, an Estonian, and Tigran Petrosian, an Armenian.\"\n\n\"Never mind what states you come from,\" glowered Bobby. \"You're all Russians\n\nto me!\"\n\nOnly Keres escaped with a draw.\n\nSoviets Dominate FIDE\n\nIn Chess Life (February 2, 1951) Dr. Feodor Bohatirchuk, a Ukrainian who\n\nemigrated to Canada, warned that Soviets had corrupted chess upon joining\n\nFIDE after the war. A former Russian co-champ with a big plus score against\n\nBotvinnik, he went on to express the feelings of many fans about the sorry\n\nstate of world chess:\n\n\"All the important activity of FIDE of last years was dictated\n\nby the Bolshevik delegation...In the first tournament for\n\nthe world's championship, three representatives of the USSR\n\nand two of other countries participated. Everyone but an\n\nextreme simpleton now knows very well that chess in the\n\nUSSR is subordinated to politics. All their chess masters\n\nare no more than pawns in the hands of a communistic\n\npropaganda machine.\n\n\"If in a tournament of five players a team of three good\n\nmasters would act together, no Capablanca, Alekhine or\n\nLasker would have the smallest chance to become champion.\n\n\"I looked through all the games of this tournament and some\n\nof the games of Soviet masters between themselves astonished\n\nme with their lack of ideas. In particular Keres against\n\nBotvinnik did not demonstrate any of his skill. The same\n\nKeres played with Euwe and Reshevsky in his old manner with\n\nstriking geniality. Of course this fact may be explained by\n\nBotvinnik's superiority but I know the play of both and I\n\nam far from being sure of this superiority. The play of\n\nSmyslov with Botvinnik was also not so impressive as it was\n\nsometimes in the games with other masters. Being aware of\n\nmethods of Soviet propaganda I have no doubt that this weak\n\nplay is rather the result of proper instruction than\n\nplaying supremacy of Botvinnik.\"\n\n1948 Redux: Rigged Games\n\n\"Proper instruction\" indeed!\n\nThe answer to whether the games were rigged exists not only in the KGB files\n\nbut also in the games themselves, which were conducted at a slow time limit of\n\n40 moves in 2 1/2 hours. First, let's take a look at the final standings of\n\nthe Hague-Moscow World Championship that lasted from March 2 - May 16, 1948.\n\n1. Mikhail Botvinnik 14-6\n\n2. Vassily Smyslov 11-9\n\n3. Paul Keres 10 1/2 - 9 1/2\n\n4. Samuel Reshevsky 10 1/2 - 9 1/2\n\n5. Max Euwe 4-16\n\nBotvinnik's margin of victory looks overwhelming, but statistics can be\n\ndeceptive. Suppose that instead of losing their first four games Keres broke\n\neven at 2-2. That would take two points away from Botvinnik giving him 12\n\nwhile adding two points to Keres giving him 12 1/2 -- and the crown!\n\nBotvinnik held the title on and off until 1963 with an overall 49%! In seven\n\nmatches and 157 games against Bronstein, Smyslov, Tal and Petrosian, he posted\n\na minus score of 77-80. So much for his vaunted superiority over Soviet\n\nrivals. To explain this discrepancy, the Soviet propaganda machine always\n\nreferred to Botvinnik as \"first among equals.\" But it was a bit more difficult\n\nto explain Reshevsky's 2 1/2 - 1 1/2 victory over Botvinnik at the USA-USSR\n\nmatch in Moscow 1955.\n\nIt's not my intention here to analyze the Keres-Botvinnik games in any great\n\ndetail. Instead I propose to pinpoint moves that strike me as suspicious at\n\nthe diagrams in all five of their skirmishes.\n\nGame One\n\nW: Keres B: Botvinnik, English Opening (A13): 1. c4 e6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 d4 4.\n\nb4 c5 5. b5 e5 6. d3 Bd6 7. e4 Qc7 8. Ne2 h5 9. h4 Nh6 10. 0-0 Bg4 11. f3 Be6\n\n12. f4 Bg4 13. f5 Nd7 14. Nd2 g6 15. fxg6 fxg6 16. Nf3 Be7 17. Rf2 Qd6 18\n\nBxh6? (Simply 18. Bd2 is indicated) 18...Rxh6 19. Qd2 Rh8 20. Ng5 Nf6\n\n(Diagram after 20...Nf6)\n\n21. Re1?!...\n\nIncomprehensible. When I saw this move, it struck me that something was awry.\n\nNine out of ten grandmasters would double rooks by 21. Raf1 without thinking\n\ntwice. The only point of the text is to play 22. Nf4 exf4 23. e5 but this is\n\nso easily thwarted as to be ludicrous. The rook is useless on e1 yet Keres\n\nleaves it there for a long time.\n\n21...Qb6 22. Nf3 Nd7 23. Ng5 Rf8 24. Rxf8+ Bxf8 25. a4?...\n\nAnother lemon. It allows a deadly pin that eventually gains a pawn. I can't\n\nsee how a world class player like Keres can lose this position after 25. Nf3.\n\n25...Bh6 26. a5 Qf6 27. Nc1 0-0-0 28. Nb3 Rf8 29. Ra1 Qe7 30. Qc1 Kb8 31. Ra2\n\nRf7 32. Qa3 Bxg5 33. hxg5 Bd1 34. Qc1 Bxb3 35. Rb2 Bd1 36. Qxd1 Qxg5 37. Qe1\n\nNf8 38. Kh2 Qf6 39.

Qxe3 dxe3 54. axb7 Kxb7 55.\n\nKg2 Kb6 56. Kf3 Ka5 57. Kxe3 Kb4 58. Kd2 g5 White Resigns\n\nGame Two\n\nW: Botvinnik B: Keres, Nimzo Indian Defense (E28): l. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3\n\nBb4 4. e3 0-0 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Re8 7. Ne2 e5 8. Ng3 d6 9. Be2 Nbd7 10. 0-0\n\nc5 11. f3....\n\n(Diagram after 11. f3)\n\n11...cxd4?\n\nBlack's game would be fine after 11...Nf8 12. e4 Ne6. The text is a basic\n\nstrategical blooper that tells me something is seriously wrong.\n\n\"Keres likes to open the game in the center. One can hardly approve his\n\ndecision, since White gets rid of his doubled pawn and his queen's bishop is\n\nactivated\" (Botvinnik).\n\n12. cxd4 Nb6?\n\nPhew! And now Black misplaces the knight, setting himself up for the fall.\n\nEither 12...Nf8 or b6 offers more resistance. Now watch White exploit the a1-\n\nh8 diagonal that Keres obligingly cleared for him.\n\n13. Bb2 exd4 14. e4! Be6 15. Rc1 Re7?\n\n\"Another waste of time. Black could still have brought about the planned\n\ntransfer of his knight to the blockading position at c5 by 15...Rc8 16. Qxd4\n\nNa4 17. Ba1 Nc5\" (Botvinnik).\n\n16. Qxd4 Qc7?\n\n\"Black essentially provokes White into advantageously opening up the game. He\n\nmissed his last chance of continuing to resist by 16...Rc8 17. Rfd1 Qd7 18.\n\nQxd6 Qxd6 19. Rxd6 Ne8 20. Rd4 Rec7\" (Botvinnik).\n\n17. c5 dxc5 18. Rxc5 Qf4 19. Bc1 Qb8 20. Rg5 Nbd7 21. Rxg7+! Kxg7 22. Nh5+ Kg6\n\n23. Qe3! Black Resigns.\n\nKeres signed the scorsheet but refrained from shaking his opponent's hand,\n\nwhich was and still is customary. \"After this second defeat in the Match-\n\nTournament it became clear to everyone that Paul no longer had any hope of\n\nwinning the event\" (Botvinnik).\n\nGame Three\n\n\"This ending should have been easily drawn, but both sides conducted it\n\nimprecisely and it was I who made the last mistake. With this win Botvinnik\n\nclinched it with only eight games left and a lead of 2 1/2 points\" (Keres).\n\nW: Keres B: Botvinnik, French Defense (C08): 1. d4 e6 2. e4 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4.\n\nexd5 exd5 5. Ngf3 a6 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nb3 Ba7 8. Bg5 Nf6 9. Nfd4 0-0 10. Be2\n\nQd6 11. 0-0 Ne4 12. Be3 Nc6 13. Nxc6?!...\n\nAnother antipositional move. Once again nine out of ten grandmasters would\n\nplay 13. c3 with scarcely any hesitation.\n\n13...Bxe3 14. fxe3?....\n\nIf there is any point to White's previous move, it has to be 14. Qxd5! Nxf2!\n\n15. Qxd6 Ne4+ 16. Kh1 Nxd6 17. Ne7+ Kh8 18. Bf3 and I can't see how White can\n\npossibly lose this ending.\n\n14...bxc6\n\nSuddenly Black has bolstered his isolated pawn on d5 while White has incurred\n\na self-induced weakness on e3. But the real farce comes later.\n\n15. Bd3 Nf6 16. Qe1 Ng4 17. Qh4 f5 18. Rf4 Ne5 19. Qg3 Ra7 20. Raf1 Raf7 21.\n\nNd4 Nxd3 22. cxd3 c5 23. Nf3 Qb6 24. Rh4 h6 25. Ne5 Rf6 26. d4 cxd4 27.

Rh7.\n\n(Diagram after 49...Rc6)\n\n50. a4?...\n\nNot in itself fatal, but 50. Ra4! should be painfully obvious to a player of\n\nKeres' caliber. If 50...Kf6 51. Ra5 Ke6 52. h4 gxh4+ 53. Kxh4 Kd6 54.

But it must have\n\ngiven Keres a small measure of satisfaction to knock Botvinnik out of first by\n\ntrouncing him in the last round of the 1955 USSR Championship.\n\nTo put it mildly, Keres didn't play his best against Botvinnik in 1948.\n\nObviously a player of Keres' genius isn't going to make stupid mistakes that\n\nare easy to detect. But I believe he left a trail in the first four games for\n\nthose knowledgeable enough to follow it to an inescapable conclusion.\n\n******************\n\n--\n\n> Paul Keres (1916-1975) now adorns Estonia's 5-krone bill. He is often\n\nregarded\n\n> as the best player who was never allowed to become world champion.\n\nThis wording is intentionally misleading. Kasparov\n\nhimself regards Keres as the strongest player never to\n\nhave _been_ world champ. Why, he didn't say.\n\nOther great players who were possibly stronger than\n\nKeres at some point are Kortchnoi, Anand, Kramnik, and\n\na couple of pre-Steinitz players, who are generally\n\nexcluded from consideration.\n\n(Much biased rambling snipped)\n\n> Viktor Korchnoi's family was released from Russia only after he lost\n\ntwo title\n\n> matches to Anatoly Karpov in 1978 and 1981.\n\nIs this supposed to be an argument of some kind?\n\nSpassky was allowed to leave Russia only AFTER he\n\nthrew games to Fischer. I see how this works now.\n\nVery logical, Sherlock. And the hoards of Russian\n\nemmigres in the US now have each conceded their shots\n\nat Karpov or Kasparov, who otherwise would have been\n\nstomped by Gulko, Albert, Gurevich, etc., etc.\n\n> Keres was the favorite, but his lips always remained sealed about his\n\nawful\n\n> score against Botvinnik.

Or drawn\n\na few of his games with Botvinnik, with the same\n\nresult again, due to Botvinnik's plus score against,\n\nReshevsky, Smyslov, and of course, Euwe.\n\nWhat we have here, is a tendency to grossly\n\ndistort facts to support preconceived opinion.\n\n> Close analysis of these\n\n> games leaves little doubt that Keres was forced to take a dive.\n\nThe same \"close analysis\" which missed Smyslov's\n\nsimilar efforts.

Kortchnoi was\n\nexcluded from the draw-pact: a direct contradiction\n\nof Bobby's charges, which included him \"in.\" In\n\ntruth, Bobby's paranoia was quite hilarious upon\n\nhearing Victor's side of this story.\n\nIt is interesting how Evans seems to interpret\n\neverything in a predetermined way, with predetermined\n\nresults. Seeking, not the truth, but some sort of\n\nunderpinning for his shaky theory which, amazingly,\n\nignores the participation (or not) of Smyslov\n\naltogether while focusing entirely on Keres and\n\nBotvinnik, with an occasional embellishment of\n\nReshevsky for variety.\n\n> The qualifying cycle was changed to a series of one-on-one matches,\n\nbut the\n\n> USSR still pulled the strings.

You see, it is not\n\nonly Russians who play these political games-\n\nour Bobby did not qualify yet he was allowed into\n\nthe championship cycle. And our Bobby forfeited\n\nto Boris on a technicality... until the match\n\nrules were blatantly ignored and the match resumed.\n\nAnd our Bobby \"negotiated\" for points in his match\n\nfor the title, with the generous and considerate\n\nRussian, Boris Spassky. Something about pots and\n\nkettles and name-calling comes to mind, but they\n\nboth PREFER Black.\n\n> \"I looked through all the games of this tournament and some\n\n> of the games of Soviet masters between themselves astonished\n\n> me with their lack of ideas.

Or does this kind of\n\n\"evidence\" only apply when, and if, he wants it\n\nto? Clearly, this is not evidence at all, but\n\nmerely the revelation that losers seem to play\n\npoorly, while winners appear to play well, all\n\nother things being equal.\n\n> The play of\n\n> Smyslov with Botvinnik was also not so impressive as it was\n\n> sometimes in the games with other masters.\n\nI was less impressed. In fact, I was shocked\n\nat the low quality (by today's standards) of all\n\nthe games which did not involve Botvinnik, taken\n\nas a whole. I think the magazines and books lend\n\nan inaccurrate perspective on the grandmaster game-\n\nthe very best get published repeatedly while the\n\nworst and the mediocre are suppressed. There were\n\nquite a few ugly games in this tourney, many of them\n\nNOT involving two Russians.\n\n> Being aware of\n\n> methods of Soviet propaganda I have no doubt that this weak\n\n> play is rather the result of proper instruction than\n\n> playing supremacy of Botvinnik.\"\n\nWhat an imbecile! The worst play of the\n\nentire tournament was that of Euwe and, more\n\nspecifically, the games between Euwe and the\n\nother middle finishers, be they Russians or not.\n\nBotvinnik vs. Smyslov was, by comparison, the\n\nbest quality chess of the whole schebang.\n\nReshevsky's opening play was appalling, but he\n\nput up quite a tussle afterwards, even scoring\n\nrespectably in spite of it. Fischer would have\n\nkilled him in such positions, six-zip. :-)\n\n> while adding two points to Keres giving him 12 1/2 -- and the crown!\n\nOops- you forgot the grandmaster draws at the\n\nend. These games were not real contests, as one\n\ncan easily see from the games themselves, if you\n\nare good enough to spot it. :-) That's a joke,\n\nson. I say, a joke. Better re-examine your take\n\non the would-have-been finish, as those last games\n\nwould have been fought out.\n\nI was impressed by the fact that the alledgedly\n\nconspiring Russians seemed to take it rather easy\n\non their alleged victim, reshevsky. Some short\n\ndraws. Some agreed draws. Many short games- the\n\nopposite approach to that which one might expect.\n\nThe usual strategy is to tire the victim out with\n\nextremely hard fought, longwinded games, one after\n\nthe other, wearing him down. But this is not what\n\nI found at all. Of course, I was looking for _any_\n\nevidence, not just the kind that suited my\n\npredetermined opinions, you see.\n\nI would like to thank chesstours for actually\n\nbothering to post the analysis which Evans claims\n\n\"proves\" his theory that Keres threw these games.\n\nMany of us do not have the Chess Life issue in which\n\nthis originally appeared, and up 'till now, could\n\nonly guess that Evans was finding the kind of errors\n\nwhich all losers make. You know- blunders.\n\nThere are a multitude of different ways to throw\n\na chessgame. Just sitting, while your clock ticks\n\naway valuable time, is one which leaves no trail to\n\nfollow. Rushing critical decisions while taking\n\ntwenty minutes to make a forced recapture is another.\n\nThen there are the trail leaving methods- miserable\n\nopening play such as Reshevsky's, or the kind used\n\nextensively by Euwe (which I am unable to pin down,\n\nexactly). And then there is Keres. I will examine\n\nthis analysis, even though I happen to agree with\n\nGM Nunn that this approach- theorising that games\n\nare thrown and then searching for \"evidence,\" is\n\nmisguided. I believe that such \"evidence\" can be\n\nfound even in games which are not thrown, such as\n\nBotvinnik's losses in this particular tourney. In\n\none of these game, Botvinnik changes plans repeatedly,\n\nshifting wood back and forth aimlessly, like a\n\nbeginner. In another, a lottery type position was\n\nreached, and both Bot and Keres made serious mistakes,\n\nwith Keres ultimately winning. This is, in fact, the\n\nrecommended strategy for a weaker player to follow,\n\nto maximize his chances against a superior. And in\n\nthis case, it worked like a charm for Keres. Unless\n\nEvans is right, in which case it backfired on\n\nBotvinnik! Or ...maybe they were BOTH using this\n\nstrategy, each convinced that the other was the better\n\nplayer. :-) Or... maybe Stalin ORDERED them to play\n\na French Defense. That might explain why Botvinnik\n\nonly switched to the Caro-Kann after Stalin's death...\n\n:-)\n\nSean the non-Canadian\n\nSent via Deja.com http://www.deja.com/\n\nBefore you buy.\n\nMOONSHINE, SEANSHINE, SUNSHINE\n\n\"The KGB was capable of anything, if there were in search of a\n\nresult that suited then.\" -- Garry Kasparov in the Times of London\n\nIn a posting of January 22 Sean the Non-Canadian (he was lying\n\nearlier about his nationality) speaks of this writer's \"theory that no\n\nman could refuse Stalin's suggestion.\" He might just as well have\n\nwritten that various writers held \"theories\" in 1940 about secret\n\nprovisions in the Stalin-Hitler Pact dividing up the Baltics and Poland.\n\nTrue, I have a \"theory\" that Botvinnik dared not reject Stalin's\n\npersonal intervention as a matter \"of course\"; and true, before secret\n\nprovisions of the Stalin-Hitler Pact were absolutely confirmed in the\n\n1980s, it was a \"theory\" that the two great dictators had agreed on\n\nyet another partition of Poland. It was indeed only a \"theory\" that\n\nwhen the Soviet army attacked Poland in the east about two weeks after\n\nthe Germans attacked in the west, the Reds were not placing their\n\nforces in close proximity with the Germans without treaty sanction.\n\nSean is betting that most readers of this forum have only a\n\nvague idea about the nature of the Stalin regime and that it was,\n\nperhaps, a bit worse on the margins than the Eisenhower era before\n\nMcCarthy was censured by the U. S. Senate. He is betting that most\n\nreaders have not studied Soviet history (he seems ignorant of it\n\nhimself). In point of fact, anything less than enthusiastic acceptance\n\nof Stalin's will was possible without giving grounds for mortal suspicion.\n\nAnd, in truth, he is betting that most readers don't understand that\n\neven enthusiastic acceptance of Stalin's will was often no safeguard\n\nagainst suspicion. Indeed, enthusiasm was not good enough for about\n\n70% percent of those men who rose to Central Committee level and would\n\nlater be executed or sent to labor camps. For those 1500 or so\n\nenthusiastic Stalinists at the 17th Party Congress, the so-called\n\n\"Congress of Victors,\" nothing was good enough for about 90% of them.\n\nEven those closest to Stalin, arguably his foreign minister\n\nMolotov and the head of his personal secretariat General Poskrebyshev,\n\nlived in total and constant fear. Indeed, Molotov's wife was arrested,\n\npersonally tortured by Beria and sent to a labor camp. Poskrebyshev's\n\nwife was apparently shot or died in a gulag. One account has the latter\n\nbeing given a \"new wife\" by Stalin. (Many believe that Stalin's second\n\nwife, who committed suicide according to official Soviet reports of\n\nyore, was murdered by the Boss.)\n\nSo, then, one can say this writer has a \"theory\" that one did\n\nnot say \"no\" to Stalin as a matter \"of course\" (to use Botvinnik's\n\nphrase) but the theory strikes me as sound indeed. Sean has absolutely\n\nnothing sensible to say in response except to offer the humdinger that\n\nStalin's anger was a non-issue!\n\nDid anyone catch Sean's reference to those persons with a \"sharper\n\nmind\" (himself perhaps?) than, say, GM Larry Evans. That's the equivalent\n\nof soft baloney questioning the incisiveness of the stainless steel grinder.\n\nSean is a figure of authentic intellectual pity, unlike say, Dr.\n\nWalker, who can make an argument. Dr. Walker and I have seldom agreed\n\non this forum, but he at least packs a wallop.\n\nYet another example of Sean's twaddle: he compares the release of\n\nKorchnoi's family after his two lost matches to Karpov with Spassky\n\nbeing allowed to leave Russia only \"AFTER he threw games to Fischer.\"\n\nDoes anyone this side of Jerry Bibuld buy this garbage?\n\nReaders will recollect that Korchnoi's son was arrested and sent to\n\na slave labor camp before his father's second match with Karpov in\n\n1981. On the eve of that match in Merano, the Soviets announced that\n\noutraged patriotic inmates had badly beaten Korchnoi's son. Korchnoi\n\nthen lost three of the first four games. One can only assume that Sean\n\nis betting most readers don't have children and don't understand what\n\nit means to have an only son mortally imperilled. One can only assume\n\nSean is betting most readers don't know the distinction in the post-\n\nStalin era between an open defector such as Korchnoi and a passive\n\nnon-cooperator such as Spassky who very quietly became a de facto emigrant.\n\nCURACAO 1962\n\nThen there is Sean's obvious unfamiliarity with the core meaning\n\nof the word \"paranoid,\" which refers to grandiose or unfounded\n\nsuspicions and delusions.\n\n\"History proved Fischer wrong,\" writes Sean Sean of Bobby Fischer's\n\nallegations of Soviet cheating at Curacao. Talk about a rewrite of\n\nhistory! Even Korchnoi, whom Fischer falsely accused of being part of\n\na deal to draw games, confirmed that the main thrust of Fischer's\n\ncharge against the Soviets was true. And, in any case, even if Fischer\n\nhad been wrong, he was clearly not engaging in delusional behavior\n\nwhen accusing Geller, Petrosian and Keres of prearranging their games.\n\nWhat history tells us about Curacao is 1. The Soviets prearranged\n\ngame results; 2. Fischer rightly protested against this form of\n\ncheating; and 3. Fischer was not yet strong enough to prevail in the\n\nface of obvious cheating that was widely recognized in later years.\n\nFischer forced positions in attempts to win and suffered accordingly.\n\nHistory has vindicated the main thrust of Fischer's charge.\n\nHere's another beaut: Fischer allegedly violated qualification\n\nrules when Pal Benko voluntarily surrendered his interzonal position\n\nto Fischer. My understanding is that Benko was paid money, and the\n\nUSCF, which was the FIDE affiliate, ratified his decision. Benko\n\ncould have decided to play, and nothing would have happened to him.\n\nIn 1972 Bobby Fischer forfeited game two of his title match with\n\nSpassky. In game three, he made demands that the Soviets did not wish\n\nto accept. At this point, Fischer's title quest was in the hands of\n\nBoris Spassky. Fischer did NOT blatantly ignore the rules. He placed\n\nhimself in the position of possibly and justifiably being forfeited.\n\nSpassky, a sportsman, decided otherwise. An action only becomes a\n\nsubstantive violation of rules if the supposedly injured party regards\n\nhimself as injured and seeks redress. Spassky did not do so. By his\n\ndecision to continue playing in the face of his own government's\n\ndisapproval, Spassky told the world that Fischer had not, in his\n\njudgment, stepped beyond the line of sporting behavior. Sean is\n\nmaking a case against Fischer that the supposedly injured party, Boris\n\nSpassky, did not make.\n\nSean speaks of the Soviets taking it easy on Reshevsky in 1948.\n\nNonsense. No one ever took it easy on Reshevsky in his prime. Most\n\nplayerss were delighted to draw with Reshevsky. Both Fischer and Al\n\nHorowitz regarded Reshevsky as probably the strongest player in the\n\nworld from about 1945 to 1955. Perhaps Fischer was wrong and saw things\n\nin Reshevsky's games that were not there. Perhaps Reshevsky was not the\n\nstrongest player in the world during that period. Then, again, perhaps\n\nhe was. Clearly, no one went about taking it easy on Sammy Reshvesky,\n\nwhom Arnold Denker once called a \"pocket-sized computer.\"\n\nIf Botvinnik, Keres and Smyslov were part of a deal in 1948, then\n\ndrawing with Reshevsky was the smartest thing they could do.\n\nIn Sean's next posting we may be hearing about the \"theory\" that\n\nBotvinnik would not lightly as a matter \"of course\" reject the personal\n\nintervention of J. V. Stalin. And so on and so forth. Expect, then,\n\nmore moonshine rather than Seanshine, let along sunshine.\n\nSEAN'S SWILL\n\nWe are dealing here with probabilities. Readers who believe that\n\nBotvinnik would curtly dismiss Stalin's will are likely to buy Sean's\n\nswill. Readers who find Botvinnik's version of events laughable will\n\nregard his semi-admission in the 1991 interview as indicative that\n\nKeres was forced to throw games to him. Others will note the evident\n\ncontradiction between Botvinnik's account in \"Achieving the Aim\"\n\n(Keres as the beneficiary of outside pressure) and his account in the\n\n1991 interview (Keres as the victim of such pressure).\n\nBotvinnik, in his own words, is arguing with himself. My view is\n\nthat this 80-year-old man in 1991 was taken aback by the interview\n\nquestion. (Gennadi Sosonko was quite friendly with the patriarch in\n\nhis final years.) He answered the question without considering the\n\nfull ramifications of what he was saying. That kind of thing happens\n\nall the time in interviews, especially when someone forgets a past lie.\n\nExpect another mountain of words from Sean who doesn't seem the\n\nleast bit ashamed of talking through his hat.\n\n--\n\nLarry Parr\n\n> In a posting of January 22 Sean the Non-Canadian (he was lying\n\n> earlier about his nationality)\n\nLOL!

A simple reading of my posts\n\nwould indicate that I am from the USA. I have\n\ntalked about my \"state championship,\" not provincial,\n\nand mentioned Chess Life over and over.

That was my point,\n\nexactly. Fischer could not tell who was cheating,\n\nand who was not. Just like someone else I know...\n\nChopping off the \"thrown games\" of Kortchnoi, there\n\nis no reason to believe that Fischer would have\n\naccused the other three of merely resting by agreeing\n\nto quick draws. This is a flat-out admission that he\n\ncould not catch up to those who are drawing all their\n\ngames. Fischer included Victor \"in,\" when he was in\n\nfact, \"out.\" Hence, Bobby's theory was wrong, even\n\nthough later it was admitted that there was an unfair\n\npact between three of the four accused \"cheaters.\"\n\nFIDE later modified the format to address the problem,\n\nin reaction to Fischer's false accusation that games\n\nwere being thrown, etc.\n\nIt wasn't until a few years later that Bobby became\n\nstrong enough to take the crown, but we should not\n\nforget the lesson- in fact, in my opinion, proven cases\n\nof collusion should result in heavy penalties, like\n\nbetting in baseball.\n\n> Here's another beaut: Fischer allegedly violated qualification\n\n> rules when Pal Benko voluntarily surrendered his interzonal position\n\n> to Fischer.

Worked like a charm- Bobby defeated\n\nBoris for the first time in his life in that\n\ngame, and went on to win the match as well.\n\nLarry cannot be blamed for not knowing that it\n\nis clearly against the rules to distract or\n\nannoy one's opponent in any manner, as he\n\ndoesn't play rated chess. BTW, it was the\n\narbiter's duty to enfore such rules, not\n\nSpassky's, just in case Larry wishes to attempt\n\nto concoct an excuse for this transgression of\n\nthe rules by blathering that Boris did not file\n\na complaint.\n\n> Sean speaks of the Soviets taking it easy on Reshevsky in 1948.\n\n> Nonsense. No one ever took it easy on Reshevsky in his prime. Most\n\n> playerss were delighted to draw with Reshevsky.

Perhaps Fischer was wrong\n\nWould you care to make an objective comparison,\n\nwithout any personal bias? I dare you to compare\n\nthe performance ratings of the top players during\n\nthe period in question. The facts speak for\n\nthemselves. The tourney was in 1948. Reshevsky\n\nwas in mediocre form, as shown in his final score.\n\nA stubborn fighter and defender, he wreaked in the\n\nopening but often outplayed his opponents in the\n\nmiddlegame. Unfortunately, Botvinnik was strong\n\nin the opening, the middlegame, and the endgame.\n\nDr. Elo, who focused on five-year-averages, seemed\n\nto conclude that Botvinnik was the top dog during\n\nthis period, judgeing by the raw numbers and graphs\n\nhe published.\n\n> If Botvinnik, Keres and Smyslov were part of a deal in 1948, then\n\n> drawing with Reshevsky was the smartest thing they could do.\n\nThis fails to answer my points, one of which\n\nwas that they did NOT tire Reshevsky out with\n\nlong, tough games, as would be expected. Quick,\n\neasy draws counteract the whole purpose of ganging\n\nup on someone, for he stays rested and therefore\n\nbetter able to upset the leader, who is supposed to\n\nbe the benefactor, not the victim.\n\nAnd of course, it is better to play for wins, so\n\nthat whoever emerges with the most points from Sammy\n\nwould become the benefactor of thrown games by the\n\nother two, ensuring his easy victory. But this all\n\nrequires thought and simple logic, so it is quite\n\nunderstandable that Larry misevaluated.\n\nOnce again, the Parr/Evans clown duo fail to\n\naddress the pettite problemo of Smyslov, who Parr\n\nmaintains was in the exact same position as Keres,\n\nunable to refuse Stalin's request. And GM Evans\n\ncannot answer why it is that he is the only one\n\nin the universe \"strong enough\" to detect the\n\n\"evidence\" in Keres' games, but not in Smyslovs'.\n\nIt would appear that there is a little disagreement\n\nhere between these two, but that could never be...\n\n\n\n>unlike some members of this forum, I don't believe that just because\n\n>he lied about his nationality we should ignore the contents of his\n\n>arguments.\n\nAnd yet, Larry Parr continues to assail the messenger, rather\n\nthan adress the content of the message. Interesting. I suppose\n\nhe also maintains that I was \"lying\" when I chose my last handle,\n\nalthough it involved no specification of color, creed, or national\n\norigin. Very strange, the way his mind \"works.\"\n\n> I know that a number of you were amused when Sean spoke of his\n\n> \"blatant hints\" about being an American rather than, as he had earlier\n\n> lied, a Canadian. We all know he dropped no hints of any kind\n\nLarry the liar is making a public fool of himself, again.\n\nI flat-out TOLD Phil Innes in one post exactly who I was,\n\nthough not by specifying my name, for he had done that\n\nhimself in another post to which I hinted at blatantly.\n\nPoor Larry just ain't smart enough to figure out who is\n\nRolf, and who is NOT-Rolf, so to speak. He has demonstrated\n\na complete inability to differentiate between that which is\n\nwritten by the same hand, and that which is not. And not\n\nonly with me, but with others as well.\n\nDullwittedness can be amusing, at times. Those of us who\n\nhave switched isp's and were forced to choose another handle\n\nand password in the process are often criticised for a lack\n\nof imagination in that choice, as I was when I picked\n\nsomething like \"YouAreWeak\" for my ICS handle. But only by\n\nthose who have lost to us! :-) I readilly admit that\n\nSean-the-Canadian was not the best, especially in view of\n\nthe fact that the REAL Sean Evans reappeared at precisely\n\nthe same time as my change of handles, but that is to be\n\nexpected- hindsight is twenty-twenty. Upon deeper\n\nconsideration, I wish I had picked \"Rolf is back, forever!\"\n\nOh, stop groaning and grow up! :-)\n\n> He also falsely refers to \"ever-changing theories\" without\n\n> offering a chronology of how those theories changed.\n\nFalsely? You need ME to give the chronology? Poor Larry\n\nmust be getting very old, and his memory fading quickly.\n\nI imagine most readers here remember the many changes in\n\nthe speculations of Parr and Evans on this matter, from the\n\nbeginning where Evans claimed that the proof was right in\n\nthe games for anyone stronger than (i.e.GM Nunn) to see for\n\nthemselves, to the present, where Botvinnik's own words are\n\ndivided into two portions, one which agrees with certain\n\npreconceptions and is readilly embraced, and another, which\n\ncontradicts them and must be labelled as falsehood without\n\nany supportting evidence, simply because it is very\n\ninconvenient to certain unshakable _opinions_.\n\nThe flaws of Evans' approach have already been pointed\n\nout by other messengers than myself, so the logic of\n\nasassinatting the messenger here is truly pathetic, even\n\ncoming from these two. GM Nunn and others have pointed\n\nto the misguidedness of taking the approach which Evans\n\nand Parr have taken, and Phil Innes even gave the link\n\nto a far more thoughrough investigation of this matter,\n\nnot to mention far less biased.\n\n> The truth is both this writer and GM Larry Evans stated from the\n\n> start that until evidence emerges from secret police files or in the\n\n> form of memoirs by men there at the time, everything we write here on\n\n> the 1948 title tournament must necessarily be \"speculation,\" though\n\n> not always a matter merely of personal opinion.

The trouble is,\n\nthey must be constantly reminded that they have no skill\n\nat writing dull, objective non-fiction. Their only\n\nstrength lies in the writing of fiction, though they\n\nboth insist on being taken seriously, as if they could\n\ndistinguish between that which is real, and that which\n\nis merely their personal opinions, and therefore subject\n\nto frequent error.\n\nIf these games were thrown, it is very odd that not\n\none person has come forward to date to provide the\n\nmissing proof, after some fifty-two years. And\n\nstrangest of all is the widow's denial, for she would\n\nseem to have plenty to gain by a posthumous world\n\nchampionship title being bestowed upon her deserving\n\nhusband.\n\n> We can state with reasonable certainty that Botvinnik did not\n\n> huffily dismiss Stalin's personal intervention\n\nLarry misses the point. Botvinnik placed a \"huffy\"\n\nstance upon his action after the fact, when Stalin was\n\ngood and dead. Cold, even. No longer a threat to him.\n\nBut this in no way proves that Keres and Smyslov threw\n\ngames to him. Nor does it prove the opposite. It proves\n\nprecisely nothing, except that maybe Botvinnik has perfect\n\nhindsight. Or maybe not.\n\n> He could not have been telling the whole truth in \"Achieving the Aim\"\n\n> (written in 1978) and in his 1991 interview because the accounts\n\n> cannot be reconciled.\n\nEven if true, this proves nothing whatever regarding\n\nthe throwing of games. Botvinnik could be proven to\n\nhave been an axe-murderer, and the games still might\n\nor might not have been thrown. These are two seperate\n\nissues, for those who can think clearly.\n\nEven so, this could be presented more convincingly\n\nwith direct quotes and an \"x\" is impossible because of\n\n\"y,\" thus Botvinnik lied one or both times.\n\n> Eventually, we will probably have\n\n> fairly reliable evidence as to what the Soviet players were ordered\n\n> to do, if anything.\n\nNice. But we don't have 'em yet, do we?\n\nAnd \"fairly reliable\" is not as good as it gets.\n\nTry harder!\n\nSean from the United States of Uhhmerica\n\n>We keep hearing rumors that GM Yuri Averbach's\n\n> memoirs will confirm the views of GM Evans.\n\nI don't see how they could. Averbach wrote a\n\nvery nice book on the endgame (Essential Chess Endings)\n\nbut if he agrees with Evans about the proof being in\n\nthe games for anyone stronger than GM Nunn to see, I\n\nmay have to plonk him into my \"nutcase\" file along with\n\nFischer and you two Bozos! :-)\n\n> It wasn't necessary for Smyslov to throw any games.\n\nOr Keres, it would seem. Botvinnik had\n\nalready established a hefty lead at the half-way\n\npoint. This was my point regarding the arousal of\n\nStalin's anger, but certain folks are blind to the\n\nfacts unless they happen to agree with their own\n\npreconceptions.\n\nThe best evidence we have so far is Botvinnik's\n\nword, combined with the fact that neither Keres nor\n\nSmyslov beat-up on Botvinnik in the second half.\n\nThis is good enough to keep the theory alive, but\n\nnot good enough to serve as any substantive evidence.\n\n\n\n> I did not find a single argument offered by Mr. Mad which merits or\n\n> even requires a reply, so I will spend my time with Sean.\n\nThis is consistent with Mr. Mad's assessment of\n\nParr's blather in response to the scathing article\n\nby Watson in Kingpin magazine. Mr. Mad stated that\n\nLarry avoided the pertinent issues, and was quite\n\nincoherent, as usual. Consistent with his usual\n\nstyle of \"quest for the truth,\" Mr. Parr fails to\n\neven ask Mad to specify what issues these were,\n\nexactly, which he failed to address.\n\nMore to the point, Parr fails to address any of\n\nthe issues raised by IM Watson in that article, such\n\nas the problem of setting a trap for one's opponent\n\nto fall into, when one is \"throwing\" the game, for one\n\nexample. No surprise here.\n\n> Sean says that the arguments of Larry Evans and this writer\n\n> have shifted, though he can offer not a single example.\n\nThere are many kinds of lies: lies, damed lies, and\n\nof course the worst kind of all, statistics. I am\n\ngrateful that Larry has stricken the last of these\n\nfrom his toolkit for now, and focused on the first\n\ntwo instead. The question arises: when has Mr. Parr\n\never asked me to provide a \"single example\" of his\n\nshifting of ground? It is quite obvious that Larry\n\nis lying, for I can easily provide such an example,\n\nbut I have not been asked yet. He could not possibly\n\nknow what I can or cannot do, until he at least asks\n\nme to try and then observes carefully the result.\n\nI am still waiting to be asked.\n\n> From the beginning, GM Evans and I noted that analysis of\n\n> what happened at the 1948 world championship must necessarily be\n\n> speculative\n\nAre you certain? Is this opinion \"inescapable,\"\n\nor is it merely speculative? How exactly does one\n\nreach an \"inescapable conclusion\" from that which is\n\nmere speculation? Ah- here we see the same incoherence\n\nas detected by Mr. Mad. Evans' sweeping conclusions\n\nemanate from mere opinions, yet they become \"inescapable\"\n\nwhen placed together with bias and preconceptions which\n\nrule out that which Evans does not like or wish to see.\n\n> Remarkable.\n\nCertainly. And fascinating as well.\n\n> IF Stalin \"personally\" intervened in 1948 as Botvinnik\n\n> claimed in 1991, then he would have followed orders.\n\nStop right there, Slick Willie. Nowhere did\n\nBotvinnik state that he was ordered by Stalin to do\n\nanything. That idea is pure invention. Botvinnik's\n\nwords tell a very different story, if you were to read\n\nthem as they are written, and not otherwise.\n\nIf Botvinnik was lying, nothing he wrote can be\n\ntrusted, for he is then, a liar. For example, it may\n\nhave been Baturinsky who came up with the idea, or\n\nBotvinnik himself, etc. Some people just can't see\n\nthe forest for the trees.\n\n> In \"Achieving the Aim\" Botvinnik wrote that intervention was\n\n> threatened ON BEHALF of Keres; in his 1991 interview he wrote that\n\n> Stalin wished to make Keres the victim of intervention. The two claims\n\n> are contradictory. Clearly Botvinnik was lying.\n\nThis appears to be more confusion by Larry Parr.\n\nThe claim Botvinnik made in his later interview was\n\nthat STALIN wanted Botvinnik to be the benefactor,\n\nwhile OTHERS preferred Keres. Clearly, Parr cannot\n\nthink or read coherently, let alone make a decent\n\nstab at reason and logic. Sad.\n\n> Sean tries to avoid discussion of how one examines the testimony\n\n> of a witness whom one has good reason to believe is lying.\n\nAh, but I have labored mightily to do just this-\n\nthe goal is to seperate that part of the two Larrys'\n\nwritings which is accurrate, from that part which is\n\nnot. Others take a simpler approach- simply discarding\n\nanything written by these two as hogwash, but not me.\n\nFor I strongly believe that even a blind squirrel can\n\nfind an acorn, now and then. This is what sets me\n\napart from the masses. :-)\n\n> Too, using the standard of cui bono\n\nI have reason to believe it is spelled qui bono,\n\nwith a \"q.\" Of course, it's all Greek to me, a\n\nlanguage in which I am completely illiterate.\n\nI know a tiny bit of Latin, though. E Pluribus\n\nUnum- see! By Jove, I think I got one right.\n\n> we can come to no final conclusions until hard evidence\n\n> becomes available.\n\nThank you, again, Dr. Jeckyl. Take care that\n\nwhen Mr. Hyde returns, he does not forget this,\n\nlike so many times before. Our inability to\n\nreach a conclusion with certainty before hard\n\nfacts are presented, is quite INESCAPABLE.\n\n> Finally, we await his \"analysis\" of the next four Keres-Botvinnik\n\n> games. He claims to approach the task with objectivity, but hasn't he\n\n> already argued that Keres was not forced to throw any games\n\nNo, I have not. You really should see a good\n\ndoctor before this problem becomes even more serious.\n\nAnd, for the record, one must wonder why would\n\nLarry eagerly await analysis by anyone other than\n\nhis buddy, GM Evans? You don't suppose he thinks I\n\nam stronger than GM Nunn, do you? Methinks his\n\neagerness has more to do with a certain frothing at\n\nthe mouth- the result of impatience to again attack\n\nmy person rather than my analysis. Interesting.\n\nI am still working on the games, but I will note\n\nthat in game 2, Keres played worse than he did in\n\ngame one. Well, he did have Black. Botvinnik's\n\nRg5! was a killer move, and quite difficult to see\n\ncoming in advance since normally such frontal\n\nassaults do not work unless the homepawns have been\n\nseriously weakened or when there are no defenders.\n\nIn view of Keres being miniaturized, I am hardly\n\nsurprised that he failed to extend his hand. The\n\nlast time that happenned to me was years ago-\n\nnearly a decade I believe. It was quite a shock,\n\nsince I thought I was \"good!\" :-)\n\n\n\n> Dr. A. Walker speaks of his surprise and satisfaction that GM\n\n> Larry Evans and this writer disagree on certain issues and are honest\n\n> enough to express these disagreements in public. His surprise speaks\n\n> eloquently about his lack of familiarity with the public record.\n\nMore likely, it speaks eloquently of his familiarity with\n\nthe countless times when Mr. Parr has given a direct quotation\n\nof Mr. Evans in place of his own personal opinion, as if they\n\nwere identical, as a matter of course.\n\nPolitical newsgroup aside, I'll wager that any reasonable\n\ntally would result in at least a 90 percent correlation\n\nbetween Larry P. and Larry E, perhaps much higher. I am not\n\nfamiliar with the goings-on in r.g.c.politics- maybe that is\n\nwhere the \"great rift\" of opinion exists between these two.\n\n> Concerning the title cycle, GM Evans supports a 32-player\n\n> \"Wimbledon-style\" knockout\n\nA lottery of sorts?\n\n> followed by a longish match against the\n\n> sitting champion.\n\nAh- a real contest, just like the good old days.\n\nMix and match!?!\n\n> I support a 16-player double-round robin\n\nDouble Round-Robin!

A lottery for the final?!!\n\nMix and match, again. You seem to agree with\n\nEvans, then, regarding the messing-up of the\n\ncycle (ala FIDE), only you differ on just HOW,\n\nexactly, to do it. A silly thing to argue about!\n\nFIDE has already demonstrated all the most\n\neffective ways to do this kind of thing, and how.\n\nYou two are silly to think you could mess things\n\nup any better than the old pros at FIDE. Take my\n\nadvice- leave this job to the experienced\n\nprofessionals. :-)\n\n> The key issue is to maintain the prestige\n\n> of the world title as both an emblem of the best in chess and as a\n\n> countervailing center of power\n\nA nice idea, but the players should be the\n\ncounterveiling power, not the egomaniac at the\n\npinnacle who, as history has shown, tends to\n\nlack both decency and objectivity, in addition\n\nto being completely self-absorbed and\n\nself-interested.\n\n> against the Fidecrats. The sanctity of\n\n> the title has an importance in chess that may be likened to the facts\n\n> of the Resurrection and Ascension in Christianity. In short, a\n\nrespectable\n\n> format is absolutely crucial.\n\nHmm. That was old testament stuff. After the\n\nintroduction of the new testa..., er, I mean the\n\nrating system, the importance of the title was\n\nno longer what it once was, for a \"Fischer\" could\n\neasily claim to be the best in the world, without\n\never actually competing in the world championship\n\ncycle, pointing to his results (i.e. rating) as\n\nthe proof in the pudding. In point of fact, there\n\nalready exist counterveiling powers in the chessworld.\n\nCertain journalists, such as Jan Timman and Yasser\n\nSeirawan, have the power to reach thousands with their\n\nopinions. Ditto Larry Evans and Andy Soltis, not to\n\nmention Benko and others, including the Britts and\n\nthe Ruskies, etc., etc. Taken together (which you\n\ncan't because they often disagree), these pundits\n\nhave considerable say about what goes on, albeit\n\n_after the fact_.\n\nIf Larry is proposing that \"the fed\" be divided\n\ninto two divisions, each \"checking\" the other, he\n\nis even crazier than I thought. The result of\n\nKasparov \"checking\" that fellow from Kalmykia or\n\nvice cersa would be similar to trying to \"check\" a\n\nfreight-train by placing an oceanliner in its path-\n\nCRUNCH, ZAP, POW! Instead of a smooth-working\n\nsystem of checks and balaces, we would see a clash\n\nof egos, and a series of chessic disasters on parr\n\nwith the two world wars, when hardly anybody good\n\nplayed each other.\n\n> also caused both Smyslov and Keres to decline Botvinnik's\n\n> handshake before the entire event began.\n\nThis is interesting. Was it at the opening\n\nceremonies? Botvinnik makes certain references\n\nto his strained relationships with his rivals,\n\nciting the need to create aggression, etc.\n\nSounds alot like Fischer, although Bobby never\n\nto my knowledge crucified his opponents in his\n\nannotations to the games. Perhaps GM Evans can\n\nanswer this question- did Bobby WANT TO chop 'em\n\nto bits in his notations, saying what a lowdown,\n\ndirty, pawn-pushing weakie they were? Methinks\n\nEvans might have counselled Bobby to be a nice boy,\n\nand stick to comments on the MOVES. It is, in a\n\nsense, counterproductive to belittle one's opponents,\n\nfor they are the mark against which your victories\n\nare measured. Perhaps this is why Botvinnik took\n\naim at his most dangerous rivals' characters, for\n\nthis would in no way undermine his purely chessic\n\nacheivements. OTOH, he made more than a few\n\nderogatory remarks regarding their quality of play,\n\nwhile treating his own mistakes as mere temporary\n\nlapses, not symptomatic of a serious weakness in,\n\nsay, the endgame or position play.\n\nSean the Martian\n\n"
