        "text": "PARIS — It would have been extraordinary enough if the first open Grand Slam tournament had been staged in routine conditions.\n\nAfter all, it had taken tennis officials such a long time to allow professionals like Ken Rosewall and Pancho Gonzales to compete with the amateurs, some of whom were paid under the table like professionals anyway.\n\nBut after nearly 80 years, the door to the French Championships was finally open to all of the game’s great talents in 1968 in Paris. The trouble was that barricades were up in other parts of the city as the protests and strikes that had been raging throughout May in France and beyond continued to cause upheaval with students and workers rallying against the established order.\n\nFifty years later, Nancy Richey, the tenacious American who won that first French Open women’s singles title, remembers it clearly.\n\n“There were no airlines; the phones didn’t call out of the country; the garbage was piled sky high; the gasoline was basically being rationed,” Richey, now 75, said by phone from her home in San Angelo, Tex. “Everything was basically shut down, and the tournament had official cars and they were having a hard time getting gasoline so they kept asking the players to move closer to the courts. I moved hotels three times.”\n\nOn May 22, five days before the tournament was to begin, the French Tennis Federation’s organizing committee seriously considered calling it off because of concerns about the lack of public transportation and the financial impact. With the need to add 100,000 francs in prize money (about $141,000 today) to the usual organizational costs because of the professionals, the committee members had doubts that enough fans would show up to avert a big financial deficit.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
