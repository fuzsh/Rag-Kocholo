I'm feeling very good right now... Since I became No. 1. I think I'm playing better and better.\" postmatch interview\n\nAravane said: \"[Dinara] played really well. I did not feel helpless. I didn't think it's impossible to defeat her, but she is the world's No. 1. She deserves it. She deserves to be in that ranking.\n\n\"There were solutions, except that I wasn't capable of finding solutions to put her in a difficult position. Today I did not play well... She managed to put me off balance immediately ever since we started rallying, and that made the difference.\" postmatch interview\n\n#2 s2 Serena Williams USA d #24 s24 Aleksandra Wozniak CAN 6-1, 6-2 Mon\n\nSerena serving, Aleksandra driving a backhand, Serena following a forehand, and after match point\n\nSerena said: postmatch interview video transcript not available as of this writing\n\nAleksandra said: \"I was really tight. I was like a rock. I couldn't let go on my shots and play my game... [Serena] didn't make any mistakes. She was playing clean tennis today... All I can do is learn from this experience and get stronger for next time... It's my first time on [Court] Philippe Chatrier. Emotions get involved and you just get tight and you can't play really your game, so it's tough.\" postmatch interview\n\n*#40 Sorana Cirstea ROU d #5 s5 Jelena Jankovic SRB 3-6, 6-0, 9-7 Mon\n\nSorana serving, Jelena and Sorana driving backhands, and Sorana after match point\n\nSorana was struggling this year before Roland Garros; her match record for 2009 was 5-11. Now she has won 4 straight, and her last two wins were over top 10 players.\n\nSorana said: \"Most important is that I'm happy with my game and the way I'm playing. I hope I can keep up like this, and hope it's just the beginning...\n\n\"Maybe I wanted too much in the first set and I wasn't playing the right way. I was a little nervous. But then after I lose the first set, I said, 'I have nothing to lose. I just need to relax.' I did that until the end of the third set when I started to get again nervous because it was an important match for me and was the first time I was playing fourth round. I really wanted to win, but I think I was trying to take control of all the points and just stay aggressive.\" postmatch interview\n\nJelena said: \"It was a long match. To be honest, I kind of let down in the second set... Of course in the third set. I serve at 6-5. I had 30-Love, and that's when I should have went more for my shots and reached a little more and tried to finish off the match point by point...\n\n\"I didn't know how well [Sorana] could play, but I know how well I can play. I'm not producing that game... Qbviously I'm not playing the same game and not same style as I used to play last year, end of the year when I was winning a lot of matches and was the No. 1 player in the world.\" postmatch interview\n\n#7 s7 Svetlana Kuznetsova RUS d #12 s12 Agnieszka Radwanska POL 6-4, 1-6, 6-1 Mon\n\nSvetlana driving a forehand, Agnieszka and Svetlana driving backhands, and Sveta after match point\n\nSvetlana said: \" I was really nervous today. I don't know why. And I saw [Agnieszka] also was. But first set, it was not very great game from both of us, but she did more unforced errors and I won. I served well. Second set, I played little bad and I did a lot of mistakes. I wasn't moving that much.\n\n\"After I went to change the clothes, I been thinking, I relax a little bit, just to play my game. I started to do much better. Started to move her around, not doing many unforced errors from my side.\" postmatch interview\n\n*#9 s9 Victoria Azarenka BLR d #8 s8 Ana Ivanovic SRB 6-2, 6-3 Sun\n\nVictoria serving, Ana driving a backhand, Vika driving a forehand, and after match point\n\nVictoria said: \"I was very consistent today and very aggressive. I didn't let [Ana] play her game, which she normally does. I was just being I think too aggressive...\n\n\"She's the champion, and it was obvious that the crowd would be for her. But I hope they will be a little bit more for me now.\" postmatch interview\n\nAna was troubled by dizziness during the match. Ana said: \"I started really well, and I felt really good in the beginning. Then after the third game, actually after first point in the fourth game, I just suddenly started feeling so dizzy, and I completely lost my balance.\n\n\"Ever since then it was really hard. I struggled with like looking up. I started feeling very dizzy, and I was struggling a little bit to find my balance. It was really hard. [Victoria] played well.\" postmatch interview\n\n#20 s20 Dominika Cibulkova SVK d #30 s29 Agnes Szavay HUN 6-2, 6-4 Sun\n\nDominika serving, Agnes driving a backhand, Dominika following one, and after match point\n\nDominika said: \"I was really, really prepared for this match. I was not going on the court like, 'It will be easy,' and I was not going on the court like, 'It will be tough.' I was not expecting anything, and I just wanted to play my game.

She's really aggressive. I think she's improved her serve a lot. It was really important for me to return well today. I think in the end, that and serving really well helped me win the match.\" postmatch interview\n\nNa said: \"The match was tough... I lost the first set, win second set easy, and then maybe I lose a little bit concentration.\n\n\"{Maria} never give up. She was like fighting every point on the court... Yeah, she's tough. I mean, I would say she's top player in all the world.\" postmatch interview\n\n#31 s30 Samantha Stosur AUS d #34 Virginie Razzano FRA 6-1, 6-2 Mon\n\nSamantha serving, Virginie following a forehand, Samantha driving a backhand, and after match point\n\nSamantha is the first Australian to reach the quarterfinals at Roland Garros in 21 years.\n\nVirginie said: \"This was an excellent match for [Samantha]. Unfortunately there's nothing I could do on the court. For me, it was a tough match. As I had said before, I said this player is a tough player. I had to be careful about the match... To me, her match was perfect. I felt I was powerless on the court. I couldn't find the solutions to win...\n\n\"I'd say that she serves even better than Serena or Venus, because she can do all types of serves. She can vary her serves. That is, hit a very strong first serve, or she would give spin to the ball so that the ball is inside out... She has two weapons: her big serve and big forehand.\" postmatch interview\n\nAbout her quarterfinal opponent, Sorana Cirstea, Samantha said: \"We've never played. I've never practiced with her, never hit a ball against her. It will be something completely new, but I'm going to try and talk to a couple of people. I think my coach watched a few games of her match today. We'll have a chat about it tomorrow, I guess, and work out what to do, but probably focus more on my game than worry too much about hers.\" postmatch interview\n\nFrench Open, QFs, Tue-Wed Jun 2-3 2pm\n\nloser's prize: €132,500 = US $180,478; points: 500\n\n#1 s1 Dinara Safina RUS d #9 s9 Victoria Azarenka BLR 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 Tue\n\nDinara and Victoria following forehands, Dinara driving a backhand, and after match point\n\nDinara said: \"[In the 1st set, Victoria] was playing well, and basically I was not doing anything to complicate it. I was playing exactly in her zone: everything to the middle, and I was running forehand, backhand. I just lost the set. At least I should hold my serve and put a little bit pressure on the return.\n\n\"I started to fight point by point just trying to change a little bit... [In the 2nd and 3rd set] she started to miss much more. I think she was missing way too much today...\n\n\"In third set, every time I was break up, but I was always struggling to hold my serve. I had couple times like love-30. I don't know. I'm not really happy with my game today.\" postmatch interview\n\nVictoria said: \" I think I just didn't take mychances, which I had. I had a lot of chances, but [Dinara] definitely stepped it up and played some good points on the key moments, which I have to give her all the credit. I think I just missed a lot of my chances today...\n\n\"I just have to learn how to play better in these moments. It's all experience, which I have to learn from, and hopefully I'll do better next time.\" postmatch interview\n\n*#7 s7 Svetlana Kuznetsova RUS d #2 s2 Serena Williams USA 7-6(3), 5-7, 7-5 Wed\n\nSvetlana serving, Serena and Svetlana driving backhands, and Sveta after match point\n\nSvetlana said: \"It was very tough match. It was difficult to me. And if I would say about first set, I was 3-love up and then [Serena] start to play better and better and it was equal. I would say normally I would think that she would win first set and I'll have to win second set. So it was very confusing.\n\n\"But as match was going on, I had chances in the second set and I didn't use them. That game that I twisted my feet, I was more concentrate of my feet don't hurt. Thinking about it I lost my serve, and she start to play better.\n\n\"It was same scenario as Australian Open [Serena defeated Sveta in the quarterfinals, 5-7, 7-5, 6-1]. It was identically. In second set, third set I was pushing myself to fight, and still she was break up. With her it's a big difference. She started to serve great, and I'm very proud that I push myself and I could fight still for the third set. This brought me the victory, because I still fight until the end.\" postmatch interview\n\nSerena said: \"It was definitely close. I had chances to win... I made it hard for myself a lot, too, more than anything. Honestly I think I lost because of me and not because of anything [Svetlana] did.\" postmatch interview\n\n#20 s20 Dominika Cibulkova SVK d #126 Maria Sharapova RUS 6-0, 6-2 Tue\n\nDominika following a forehand, Maria and Dominika following backhands, and Dominika after match point\n\nDominika said: \"Today I was playing really solid. I was playing very solid from the baseline. I think I made really just not a lot of unforced errors. I was returning well, and my serve was like so-so today. It was not the best, but I knew if I played solid, and if I make her move, and if I play well, then I have this chance...\n\n\"It was my tactic to play close to the baseline, and to make her move, and not to be scared of her first, two, three, fast shots. I knew that if I managed to put it back, then I have my chances.\" postmatch interview\n\nMaria's first four matches had all gone three sets. Maria said: \"Everything fell a little short today. The pace wasn't there on my strokes, and I was five steps slower today. I think everything kind of combines. [Dominika] played really solid and made me hit a lot of balls, and I came up short today...\n\n\"I was very appreciative of the way [the French fans] were rooting for me, asking for me to fight and to keep working and find a way to turn things around. Yeah, definitely. I've had a really great last few weeks here, and I can only tell them that I'll be back next year.\" postmatch interview\n\nAbout her right shoulder, which had kept her from playing for over nine months, Maria said: \"It's fine.

I'm just really pleased that even though I may have been down in the game, I could hang in there and fight my way back. If she was going to win the game she had to earn it from me. I wasn't going to give anything away today.\n\nAt 6-1, 4-1 I was feeling pretty good, but I knew it certainly wasn't over. Serving at 4-3, just went for a little bit more and got that game. And then again, 40-15 down in that last game, and just kept my head down and made her earn it and I ended up breaking.\" postmatch interview\n\nFrench Open, SFs, Thu Jun 4 2pm\n\nloser's prize: €265,000 = US $360,956; points: 900\n\n#1 s1 Dinara Safina RUS d #20 s20 Dominika Cibulkova SVK 6-3, 6-3\n\nDinara serving, Dominika and Dinara driving forehand and backhand, and Dominika congratulating Dinara after match point\n\nDinara said: \"I think I didn't play aggressive, I mean, when I had to from the beginning of the match. Once I was down I started to play better, but I think still I have to be much more dominant on the court.\" postmatch interview\n\nDominika said: \"I knew how [Dinara was] going to play. She didn't surprise me with anything. She played a lot of cross, good backhand. I played a lot to her backhand and I didn't make her move a lot, because I was scared to play on the lines, just to miss the ball. I didn't move her enough, and I didn't return well at all. I was returning terrible...\n\n\"I was planning to serve better, and to make pressure with the return. But today I was just standing so far from the baseline, and I couldn't do anything. I was just there and just running and she was making the pressure.\" postmatch interview\n\n#7 s7 Svetlana Kuznetsova RUS d #31 s30 Samantha Stosur AUS 6-4, 6(5)-7, 6-3\n\nSvetlana serving, Samantha driving a forehand and Svetlana following a backhand, and Sam congratulating Sveta after match point\n\nSvetlana said: \"I thank my coach, Larisa [Savchenko Neiland], so much, because she stays all match positive. Doesn't matter what happens, she just stays calm. 'It's okay. Play, play.' To me it's important. I can't stand when people make me nervous, say, 'How you do this? How you do that?' I say, 'Guys, just go and play yourself if you want to do better [laughter.]' It's very important for me. She supports me all the way, and it's really great.\n\n\"[Samantha has] been playing great, so I expected very tough match. She serves great. I mean, I been playing ball from the second floor up here [due to the high bounce from the spin Samantha puts on the ball]. It was not very comfortable. I had to play two meters behind [the baseline]... The spin which Sam puts on the ball is really difficult.\" postmatch interview\n\nSamantha said: \"At the start [of the 3rd set], we were both holding serve pretty easy those first four games. I had that one break point, I think it was 30-40 at 2-all, and probably maybe should have backed myself a little bit more and tried to run around it rather than taking a backhand.\n\n\"But I hit a good serve, and then lost serve, and then I felt like the match was still pretty even but I was 4-2 down. You know, I tried to the last point, but you go a break down in the third, it's not as easy to try and get it back.\" postmatch interview\n\nFrench Open, Final, Sat Jun 6 3pm (9am EDT 6am PDT NBC-TV)\n\nloser's prize: €530,000 = US $721,913; points: 1400\n\nwinner's prize: €1,060,000 = US $1,443,827; pts: 2000\n\n*#7 s7 Svetlana Kuznetsova RUS d #1 s1 Dinara Safina RUS 6-4, 6-2\n\nSvetlana serving, Dinara fielding a forehand, Svetlana driving a backhand,\n\nDinara driving a forehand, Svetlana following one, and Dinara congratulating Sveta after match point"
