        "text": "'Wanting' and 'liking' skin picking: A validation of the Skin Picking Reward Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nSnorrason, Ivar; Olafsson, Ragnar P; Houghton, David C; Woods, Douglas W; Lee, Han-Joo\n\n2015-12-01\n\nExcoriation (skin-picking) disorder (SPD) is often conceptualized as a behavioral addiction in which aberrant reward processing may play an important role. The current study sought to develop a self-report instrument--the Skin Picking Reward Scale (SPRS)--that measures how strongly skin picking is 'liked' (i.e., the degree of pleasurable feelings while receiving the reward) and 'wanted' (i.e., the degree of the motivation to seek the reward). We administered the SPRS to individuals who endorsed excessive skin picking in online surveys and examined the scale's factor structure (Studies 1 and 2). We then asked individuals with documented pathological skin picking to complete the SPRS and other relevant questionnaires on two occasions one week apart (Study 3). Exploratory (Study 1; nâ=â330) and confirmatory (Study 2; nâ=â144) factor analyses consistently supported a two-factor structure reflecting the 'liking' and 'wanting' constructs. Results from Study 3 (Nâ=â36) indicated that the Wanting and the Liking scales had adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Additionally, consistent with predictions, the Wanting scale, but not the Liking scale, was associated with picking urges the following week, greater cue-reactivity, and more picking-related routines/habits. These initial findings suggest that SPRS is a psychometrically sound measure of 'wanting' and 'liking' in pathological skin picking. The SPRS may facilitate research on reward processing anomalies in SPD and serve as a useful clinical instrument (e.g., to identify those at risk for cue-induced relapse).\n\nPathological grooming: Evidence for a single factor behind trichotillomania, skin picking and nail biting\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHende, BorbÃ¡la; UrbÃ¡n, RÃ³bert; Demetrovics, Zsolt\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAlthough trichotillomania (TTM), skin picking (SP), and nail biting (NB) have been receiving growing scientific attention, the question as to whether these disorders can be regarded as separate entities or they are different manifestations of the same underlying tendency is unclear. Data were collected online in a community survey, yielding a sample of 2705 participants (66% women, mean age: 29.1, SD: 8.6). Hierarchical factor analysis was used to identify a common latent factor and the multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) modelling was applied to test the predictive effect of borderline personality disorder symptoms, impulsivity, distress and self-esteem on pathological grooming. Pearson correlation coefficients between TTM, SP and NB were between 0.13 and 0.29 (p < 0.01). The model yielded an excellent fit to the data (CFI = 0.992, TLI = 0.991, Ï2 = 696.65, p < 0.001, df = 222, RMSEA = 0.030, Cfit of RMSEA = 1.000), supporting the existence of a latent factor. The MIMIC model indicated an adequate fit (CFI = 0.993, TLI = 0.992, Ï2 = 655.8, p < 0.001, df = 307, RMSEA = 0.25, CI: 0.022â0.028, pclose = 1.000). TTM, SP and NB each were loaded significantly on the latent factor, indicating the presence of a general grooming factor. Impulsivity, psychiatric distress and contingent self-esteem had significant predictive effects, whereas borderline personality disorder had a nonsignificant predictive effect on the latent factor. We found evidence that the category of pathological grooming is meaningful and encompasses three symptom manifestations: trichotillomania, skin picking and nail biting. This latent underlying factor is not better explained by indicators of psychopathology, which supports the notion that the urge to self-groom, rather than general psychiatric distress, impulsivity, self-esteem or borderline symptomatology, is what drives individual grooming behaviours.

Results of an ABCBAB design revealed that the use of student-selected manipulatives resulted in reduced skin picking.

The aim of this study is to determine the relationship of traumatic life events, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociation in patients with diagnoses of trichotillomania and skin picking disorder. The study included patients who was diagnosed with trichotillomania (n=23) or skin picking disorder (n=44), and healthy controls (n=37). Beck Depression Inventory, Traumatic Stress Symptoms Scale and Dissociative Experiences Scale were administered. All groups checked a list of traumatic life events to determine the exposed traumatic events. There was no statistical significance between three groups in terms of Dissociative Experiences Scale scores (P=0.07). But Beck Depression Inventory and Traumatic Stress Symptoms Scale scores of trichotillomania and skin picking groups were significantly higher than the control group. Subjects with a diagnosis of trichotillomania and skin picking reported statistically significantly higher numbers of traumatic and negative events in childhood compared to healthy subjects. We can conclude that trauma may play a role in development of both trichotillomania and skin picking. Increased duration of trichotillomania or skin picking was correlated with decreased presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. The reason for the negatively correlation of severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and self-harming behavior may be speculated as developing trichotillomania or skin picking symptoms helps the patient to cope with intrusive thoughts related to trauma. Future longitudinal research must focus on whether trauma and post-traumatic stress or trichotillomania and skin picking precede the development of mental disorder.\n\nThe relationship between adolescents' academic stress, impulsivity, anxiety, and skin picking behavior.\n\nPubMed\n\nYeo, Sun Kyung; Lee, Woo Kyeong\n\n2017-08-01\n\nSkin picking behavior involves an individual picking or biting their skin repeatedly. Although this behavior commonly occurs at a young age, little research has addressed its harmful effects among the Korean population. Therefore, we examined the characteristics of South Korean adolescents who reported skin picking behavior. South Korean students aged 12-16 years participated (N=410, females=52.2%). They completed questionnaires that addressed skin picking behavior, academic stress, impulsivity, and anxiety. The survey was conducted in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do from February-March 2016. Among participants, 66.8% reported that they had picked their skin and 15.4% did so currently. Skin picking was positively correlated with academic stress, impulsivity, and anxiety. Students who picked their skin more often displayed more anxiety, academic stress, and impulsivity. Future studies should address skin picking adolescents' characteristics, especially regarding anxiety and academic stress. Educational programs should be implemented to help adolescents decrease their anxiety and academic stress and prevent the worsening of skin picking behavior. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present study examines the psychometric properties of the Skin Picking Scale-Revised (SPS-R, German version) in adolescents. A total of 76 adolescents (96% female) completed the SPS-R, the Clinical Psychological Diagnostic System (KPD-38), and a questionnaire assessing demographics and clinical characteristics online. The SPS-R had high internal consistency (Î±â=â0.89) and significant small-to-medium correlations with reduced competence skills, psychological impairment, general life satisfaction, social support, and social problems on the KPD-38. Similar to prior findings for adults, an exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor model for the SPS-R in adolescents. Group comparisons failed to show significant differences on SPS-R scores between participants with and without dermatological conditions. The current results suggest that the SPS-R can be useful in adolescent samples as a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of skin picking severity. Future research investigating scale validity and factor structure in a clinical sample of adolescent skin pickers is warranted.\n\nExperimental functional analysis of severe skin-picking behavior in Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nHall, Scott S; Hustyi, Kristin M; Chui, Clara; Hammond, Jennifer L\n\n2014-10-01\n\nSkin picking is an extremely distressing and treatment resistant behavior commonly shown by individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). However, with the exception of a limited number of published single-case and survey studies, little is known about the environmental determinants of skin picking in this population. In this study, functional analyses were conducted with thirteen individuals with PWS, aged 6-23 years, who engaged in severe skin-picking behavior. In addition to the conditions typically employed in a functional analysis (i.e., alone, attention, play, demand), we included an ignore condition to examine potential effects of stimulus control by the presence of an adult. Twelve participants engaged in skin picking during the functional analysis, with the highest levels occurring in the alone and ignore conditions for eight participants, suggesting that skin picking in these participants was maintained by automatic reinforcement. For the remaining four participants, an undifferentiated pattern of low-rate skin picking was observed across conditions. These data confirm previous studies indicating that skin picking in PWS may be maintained most often by automatically produced sensory consequences. There were no associations between demographic characteristics of the participants (e.g., sex, age, IQ or BMI) and levels of skin picking observed in the functional analysis. Additional investigations are needed to identify the nature of the sensory consequences produced during episodes of skin picking in PWS. Behavioral interventions designed to extinguish or compete with the potential sensory consequences arising from skin picking in PWS are also warranted. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 92 participants completed an anonymous, Internet-based survey through a link to the Trichotillomania Learning Center's home page. Results indicated that skin pickers experienced social, occupational, and academic impairment, a number of medical or mental health concerns, and financial burdens, which they attributed to skin picking. Results also revealed moderate, statistically significant relationships between skin picking severity and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance. Subsequent mediational analyses demonstrated that the relationship between skin picking severity and symptoms of anxiety and depression was partially mediated by experiential avoidance. Implications, conclusions, and future areas of research are discussed.\n\nHabit Reversal as a Treatment for Chronic Skin Picking: A Pilot Investigation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTeng, Ellen J.; Woods, Douglas W.; Twohig, Michael P.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of habit reversal (HR) to a wait-list control as a treatment for chronic skin picking in adults.

Standard psychoactive medications do not help most patients. Similarly, Mouse Ulcerative Dermatitis (skin lesions caused by excessive abnormal grooming behavior) is very common in widely used inbred strains of mice, and represents a serious animal welfare issue and cause of mortality. Treatment options for Ulcerative Dermatitis are largely palliative and ineffective. We have proposed mouse Ulcerative Dermatitis as a model for human Skin Picking Disorder based on similar epidemiology, behavior, and its comorbidity and mechanistic overlap with hair pulling (trichotillomania). We predicted that mouse Ulcerative Dermatitis would be treated by N-Acetylcysteine, as this compound is highly effective in treating both Skin Picking Disorder and Trichotillomania. Furthermore, we hypothesized that N-Acetylcysteineâs mode of action is as a precursor to the production of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione in the brain, and therefore intranasal glutathione would also treat Ulcerative Dermatitis. Accordingly, we show in a heterogenous prospective trial, the significant reduction in Ulcerative Dermatitis lesion severity in mice receiving either N-acetylcysteine (oral administration) or glutathione (intranasal). The majority of mice treated with N-acetylcysteine improved slowly throughout the course of the study. Roughly half of the mice treated with glutathione showed complete resolution of lesion within 2-4 weeks, while the remainder did not respond. These findings are the first to show that the use of N-acetylcysteine and Glutathione can be curative for mouse Ulcerative Dermatitis.

In the present study we examined whether some emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and personality features influence skin-picking in a university sample; the moderating role of personality traits in the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and skin-picking was also considered. A total sample of 252 adults (mean age 24.03; SDâ¯=â¯5.66) completed the Skin-Picking Scale-Revised, Temperament and Character Inventory and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. The linear regression analyses indicated that the use of cognitive reappraisal as emotion regulation strategy decrease skin-picking severity. Reduced novelty seeking and reduced self-directedness were identified as significant predictors of skin-picking severity, whereas decreased self-directedness and elevated cooperativeness predicted functional impairment caused by skin-picking. Further moderation analysis revealed that cognitive reappraisal decreases skin-picking severity only among individuals with low and moderate novelty seeking, however, not among those with high novelty seeking. These results indicate that emotion regulation strategies and specific personality traits are important factors associated with skin-picking behaviours in a university sample. Further research is needed to establish the link between emotion regulation strategies and personality traits in clinical sample. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The parents of 55 individuals with PWS, aged 6-25 years, were interviewed about their child's skin-picking behavior using the Self-Injury Trauma Scale (SIT; Iwata, Pace, Kissel, Nau, & Farber, 1990) and the Functional Analysis Screening Tool (FAST; Iwata, DeLeon, & Roscoe, 2013). Results showed that skin picking in PWS occurred on the extremities (i.e., arms, legs, hands, and feet) for 75% of cases and resulted in bodily injury for 83.7% cases. Skin picking posed a high risk to the individual concerned in 41.8% of cases. Automatic sensory stimulation was identified as a potential source of reinforcement in the majority of cases (52.7%) followed by access to social attention or preferred items (36.4%). Treatments utilized by parents were primarily behavioral strategies (56.3%) followed by basic first aid (54.5%). There were no differences in the topography, severity or potential source of reinforcement between those with the deletion (DEL) subtype and those with the uniparental disomy (UPD) subtype. Taken together, these data indicate that skin picking shown by individuals with PWS is a particularly severe and intractable behavioral issue that may be maintained by (as yet unknown) sensory consequences. Further studies to identify the determinants of skin picking in PWS are therefore needed. The implications for interventions are discussed. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Seventeen ASMD patients underwent a liver biopsy during baseline screening for a Phase 1 trial of recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM) in adults with Niemann-Pick disease type B. Eleven of the 17 were enrolled in the trial and each received a single dose of rhASM and underwent a repeat liver biopsy on Day 14. Biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, sphingomyelin accumulation and macrophage infiltration by light and electron microscopy. When present, fibrosis was periportal and pericellular, predominantly surrounding affected Kupffer cells. Two baseline biopsies exhibited frank cirrhosis. Sphingomyelin was localized to isolated Kupffer cells in mildly affected biopsies and was present in both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in more severely affected cases. Morphometric quantification of sphingomyelin storage in liver biopsies ranged from 4â44% of the microscopic field. Skin biopsies were also performed at baseline and Day 14 in order to compare the sphingomyelin distribution in a peripheral tissue to that of liver. Sphingomyelin storage was present at lower levels in multiple cell types of the skin, including dermal fibroblasts, macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and Schwann cells. This Phase 1 trial of rhASM in adults with ASMD provided a unique opportunity for a prospective assessment of hepatic and skin pathology in this rare disease and their potential usage as pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

Of 55 participants with SPD recruited for a neurocognitive study and two pharmacological studies, 16 (29.1%) had co-occurring BDD. SPD participants with and without BDD were compared to each other and to 40 healthy volunteers on measures of symptom severity, social functioning, and cognitive assessments using the Stop-signal task (assessing response impulsivity) and the Intra-dimensional/Extra-dimensional Set Shift task (assessing cognitive flexibility). Individuals with SPD and BDD exhibited significantly worse picking, significantly worse overall psychosocial functioning, and significantly greater dysfunction on aspects of cognitive flexibility. These results indicate that when SPD co-occurs with BDD unique clinical and cognitive aspects of SPD may be more pronounced. Future work should explore possible subgroups in SPD and whether these predict different treatment outcomes. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were 650 individuals who met criteria for SPD in an online survey. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated a unitary factor structure with high internal consistency (Î± = 0.94). Consequently, we constructed an abbreviated 4-item version that retained good internal consistency (Î± = 0.87) and a robust factor structure. Both the short and the full versions demonstrated discriminant and convergent/concurrent validity. In conclusion, the findings indicate that both versions are psychometrically sound measures of SPD related psychosocial impact; however, some potential limitations of the full scale are discussed.

ICD-10 classifies TTM as a habit and impulse disorder, and includes stereotyped movement disorders in a section on other behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. This article provides a focused review of nosological issues relevant to DSM-V, given recent empirical findings. This review presents a number of options and preliminary recommendations to be considered for DSM-V: (1) Although TTM fits optimally into a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorders, in a nosology comprised of relatively few major categories it fits best within a category of motoric obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, (2) available evidence does not support continuing to include (current) diagnostic criteria B and C for TTM in DSM-V, (3) the text for TTM should be updated to describe subtypes and forms of hair pulling, (4) there are persuasive reasons for referring to TTM as \"hair pulling disorder (trichotillomania),\" (5) diagnostic criteria for skin picking disorder should be included in DSM-V or in DSM-Vs Appendix of Criteria Sets Provided for Further Study, and (6) the diagnostic criteria for stereotypic movement disorder should be clarified and simplified, bringing them in line with those for hair pulling and skin picking disorder.

In trial 1, the vents of all carcasses were plugged and sutured before scalding to prevent the expulsion of cloacal contents during picking. In trial 2, half of the carcasses had their vents plugged and sutured. Immediately after defeathering, breast skin was aseptically removed, and bacteria associated with it were enumerated. In trial 1, the levels of bacteria recovered did not differ between feathered and featherless carcasses: Campylobacter log10 1.4 cfu/mL of rinse, coliform log10 1.8, Escherichia coli log10 1.6, and total aerobic bacteria log10 3.1. In trial 2, the carcasses that had vents plugged and sutured had lower levels of all four types of bacteria (differences of Campylobacter log10 0.7 cfu/mL, coliform log10 1.8, E. coli log10 1.7, and total aerobic bacteria log10 0.5) than those carcasses with open vents. The lower levels of bacteria recovered from carcasses with the vents plugged and sutured during picking enabled detection of small but significant differences between feathered and featherless carcasses. The level of coliform and E. coli recovered was slightly higher by log10 0.7 cfu for feathered carcasses, but featherless carcasses had marginally higher levels of total aerobic bacteria by log10 0.4 cfu. Feathered and featherless carcasses with open vents during picking did not differ in the levels of recovery of coliform, E. coli, and total aerobic bacteria from breast skin.\n\nAcceptance-Enhanced Behavior Therapy (AEBT) for Trichotillomania and Chronic Skin Picking: Exploring the Effects of Component Sequencing\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFlessner, Christopher A.; Busch, Andrew M.; Heideman, Paul W.; Woods, Douglas W.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis pilot study examined the utility of acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy (AEBT) for trichotillomania (TTM) and chronic skin picking (CSP) and the impact of altering treatment sequence on overall treatment efficacy.

Five thousand Israeli students were given questionnaires screening for SPD, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders. A total of 2176 participants (43.6%) responded and were included in the analysis. Mean age was 25.1 Â± 4.8 (range 17-60) years, and 64.3% were female. The proportion of students who were screened positive for SPD was 3.03%, with a nearly equal gender distribution (3.0% in females and 3.1% in males). There was a trend toward significantly higher rates of psychiatric problems such as generalized anxiety, compulsive sexual behavior and eating disorders in these students. Within the group of students screening positive for SPD, alcohol intake was higher in male students, while female students perceived themselves as less attractive. No association was found between depression and SPD. A high prevalence rate of skin picking was found within first-degree family members of the participants screening positive for SPD. Clinicians and public health officials within university settings should screen for SPD as it is common and associated with psychosocial dysfunction. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Current gold standard for the detection of skin pathologies is a tissue biopsy and followed by a series of steps before it is examined under a light microscope by a pathologist. The disadvantage with this method is its invasiveness. Light based biomedical point spectroscopic techniques offers an adjunct technique to invasive tissue pathology. In this context, we have implemented a simple multiplexed ratiometric approach (F470/F560 and F510/F580) based on fluorescence at two excitation wavelengths 378 nm and 445 nm respectively. The emission profile at these excitation wavelengths showed a shift towards the longer wavelengths for melanoma when compared with normal and nevus. At both excitation wavelengths, we observed an increased intensity ratios for normal, followed by nevus and melanoma. This intensity ratios provide a good diagnostic capability in differentiating normal, nevus and melanocytic skin lesions. This method could be applied in vivo because of the simplicity involved in discriminating normal and pathological skin tissues.\n\nEvaluation of skin pathologies by RGB autofluorescence imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLihachev, Alexey; Plorina, Emilija V.; Derjabo, Alexander; Lange, Marta; Lihacova, Ilze\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA clinical trial on autofluorescence imaging of malignant and non-malignant skin pathologies comprising 32 basal cell carcinomas (BCC), 4 malignant melanomas (MM), 1 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 89 nevi, 14 dysplastic nevi, 20 hemangiomas, 23 seborrheic keratoses, 4 hyperkeratoses, 3 actinic keratoses, 3 psoriasis, 1 dematitis, 2 dermatofibromas, 5 papillofibromas, 12 lupus erythematosus, 7 purpura, 6 bruises, 5 freckles, 3 fungal infections, 1 burn, 1 tattoo, 1 age spot, 1 vitiligo, 32 postoperative scars, 8 post cream therapy BCCs, 4 post radiation therapy scars, 2 post laser therapy scars, 1 post freezing scar as well as 114 reference images of healthy skin was performed. The sequence of autofluorescence images of skin pathologies were recorded by smartphone RGB camera under continuous 405 nm LED excitation during 20 seconds with 0.5 fps. Obtained image sequences further were processed with subsequent extraction of autofluorescence intensity and photobleaching parameters.\n\nExamining the Relationship between Heart Rate and Problem Behavior: A Case Study of Severe Skin Picking in Prader-Willi Syndrome\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHall, Scott S.; Hammond, Jennifer L.; Hustyi, Kristin M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFew studies have examined the relationship between heart rate and self-injurious behavior (SIB) shown by individuals with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities).

Despite the abundance of publications on dermatological problems in DM, there is still a number of gaps to be discussed in terms of pathophysiological mechanisms. The goal of this review was to assess the mechanisms of development of different skin pathologies under DM. One of the key pathogenic mechanisms of skin lesions in diabetes is hyperglycemia and the effects of the advanced glycation end products, inducing oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation; that in its turn can accelerate the mechanisms of skin aging, the development of diabetic dermopathy and scleredema diabeticorum. Imbalance of growth factors, cytokines and hormones under insulin resistance, is associated with increased proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and sebocytes, mast cell dysfunction and melanogenesis disorders in acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, acne and inflammatory dermatitis in diabetic patients. In addition, authors discuss the role of dendritic cells and macrophages dysfunction in impairment of peripheral tolerance and diabetic wounds pathogenesis in patients with DM.\n\nFeather-picking psittacines: histopathology and species trends.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarner, M M; Clubb, S L; Mitchell, M A; Brown, L\n\n2008-05-01\n\nHistologic findings are described for 408 feather-picking or self-mutilating psittacines with the use of biopsies from clinically affected and unaffected skin. Inflammatory skin disease was diagnosed in 210 birds, and traumatic skin disease was diagnosed in 198 birds. Criteria used for the diagnosis of inflammatory skin disease included the presence of perivascular inflammation in the superficial or deep dermis of clinically affected and unaffected sites. The primary histologic criteria for the diagnosis of traumatic skin disease were superficial dermal scarring with or without inflammation in the affected sites and an absence of inflammation in the unaffected sites. The inflammatory cells associated with the lesions were typically lymphocytes and occasionally plasma cells, histiocytes, and granulocytes. A preponderance of inflammatory skin disease was seen in macaws (Ara spp.) and Amazon parrots (Amazona spp.). A preponderance of traumatic skin disease was seen in cockatoos (Cacatua spp.) and African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus). The prevalence of each was approximately equal in several other species, including conures (Aratinga and Pyrrhura spp.), eclectus parrots (Eclectus roratus), quaker parrots (Myiopsitta monachus), cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus), parakeets (Cyanorhamphus and Psittacula spp.), and caiques (Pionites spp.). No geographic or gender-based trends were identified. These findings could be helpful for identifying and treating birds with feather-picking disorders.\n\nA multispectral imaging approach for diagnostics of skin pathologies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLihacova, Ilze; Derjabo, Aleksandrs; Spigulis, Janis\n\n2013-06-01\n\nNoninvasive multispectral imaging method was applied for different skin pathology such as nevus, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma diagnostics. Developed melanoma diagnostic parameter, using three spectral bands (540 nm, 650 nm and 950 nm), was calculated for nevus, melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. Simple multispectral diagnostic device was established and applied for skin assessment. Development and application of multispectral diagnostics method described further in this article.\n\nThe relationship between skin symptoms and the scleroderma modification of the health assessment questionnaire, the modified Rodnan skin score, and skin pathology in patients with systemic sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nZiemek, Jessica; Man, Ada; Hinchcliff, Monique; Varga, John; Simms, Robert W; Lafyatis, Robert\n\n2016-05-01\n\nTo determine how well skin symptoms considered specific to SSc are captured by patient reported outcomes currently used for assessing patients with SSc, the SHAQ, or skin disease, the Skindex-29; and how well these symptoms correlate with the extent of skin disease on physical exam and skin pathology. SSc patients completed the scleroderma modification of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ), Skindex-29 and a Skin Symptom Assessment questionnaire developed for this study. Correlations were assessed between the Skin Symptom Assessment and SHAQ, Skindex-29, modified Rodnan skin score, and skin pathological features including myofibroblast staining completed on the same date. Tight, hard and rigid/stiff skin symptoms correlated moderately highly with the modified Rodnan skin score (r = 0.445, P = 0.0008; r = 0.486, P = 0.0002; and r = 0.488, P = 0.0002, respectively). Tight skin symptoms correlated moderately with myofibroblast infiltration (r = 0.544, P = 0.0023) and hyalinized collagen (r = 0.442, P = 0.0164), while both hard and rigid/stiff skin correlated moderately with inflammation (r = 0.401, P = 0.0310 and r = 0.513, P = 0.0045), myofibroblast infiltration(r = 0.480, P = 0.0084 and r = 0.527, P = 0.0033) and hyalinized collagen (r = 0.453, P = 0.0137 and r = 0.478, P = 0.0087), while the SHAQ was not found to correlate with any of these pathological changes. In contrast, painful skin symptoms correlated moderately with the SHAQ (r = 0.413, P = 0.0073), and with the three domains of Skindex-29: Symptoms, Emotions and Functioning. Skindex-29 indicates that dcSSc patient skin symptoms are nearly as severe as those of patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Patient reported skin symptoms correlate with clinical and pathological measures in the skin. A validated patient reported skin symptom instrument might considerably improve evaluation of SSc skin disease. Â© The Author 2016.

NPD type B is a milder form, generally later in onset, with a good prognosis for survival into adulthood and usually with no neurological abnormalities. The authors describe the case of a 52-year-old man who presented with unexplained pancytopenia and splenomegaly. He was admitted to emergency splenectomy due to pathological splenic rupture. The histological findings showed diffuse histiocytosis, suggesting lysosomal storage disease. The NPD was confirmed when residual activity of acid sphingomyelinase in peripheral blood leucocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts was detected. Besides lipid abnormalities, the patient also had lipid interstitial pneumonia. There is no treatment for NPD. Management is based on surveillance and supportive care. The patient has reached the sixth decade of life with no symptoms and, despite the pneumonia and splenectomy, he still has a fairly healthy life. 2015 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\nSkin picking disorder: prevalence, correlates, and associations with quality of life in a large sample.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachado, Myrela O; KÃ¶hler, Cristiano A; Stubbs, Brendon; Nunes-Neto, Paulo R; Koyanagi, Ai; Quevedo, JoÃ£o; Soares, Jair C; Hyphantis, Thomas N; Marazziti, Donatella; Maes, Michael; Stein, Dan J; Carvalho, AndrÃ© F\n\n2018-05-07\n\nEvidence suggests that skin picking disorder (SPD) could be a prevalent condition associated with comorbidity and psychosocial dysfunction. However, just a few studies have assessed the prevalence and correlates of SPD in samples from low- and middle-income countries. In addition, the impact of SPD on quality of life (QoL) dimension after multivariable adjustment to potential confounders remains unclear. Data were obtained from a Brazilian anonymous Web-based research platform. Participants provided sociodemographic data and completed the modified Skin Picking-Stanford questionnaire, the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised inventory (SCL-90R), early trauma inventory self report-short form, and the World Health Organization quality of life abbreviated scale (WHOQOL-Bref). Associations were adjusted to potential confounders through multivariable models. For our survey, 7639 participants took part (71.3% females; age: 27.2Â±7.9 years). The prevalence of SPD was 3.4% (95% CI: 3.0-3.8%), with a female preponderance (P<0.001). In addition, SPD was associated with a positive screen for a major depressive episode, nicotine dependence, and alcohol dependence, as well as suicidal ideation. Physical and psychological QoL was significantly more impaired in participants with SPD compared to those without SPD, even after adjustment for comorbidity. In this large sample, SPD was a prevalent condition associated with co-occurring depression, nicotine, and alcohol dependence. In addition, SPD was independently associated with impaired physical and psychological QoL. Public health efforts toward the early recognition and treatment of SPD are warranted.\n\nIn vivo spectroscopy of healthy skin and pathology in terahertz frequency range\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZaytsev, Kirill I.; Kudrin, Konstantin G.; Reshetov, Igor V.; Gavdush, Arseniy A.; Chernomyrdin, Nikita V.; Karasik, Valeriy E.; Yurchenko, Stanislav O.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBiomedical applications of terahertz (THz) technology and, in particular, THz pulsed spectroscopy have attracted considerable interest in the scientific community. A lot of papers have been dedicated to studying the ability for human disease diagnosis, including the diagnosis of human skin cancers. In this paper we have studied the THz material parameters and THz dielectric properties of human skin and pathology in vivo, and THz pulsed spectroscopy has been utilized for this purpose. We have found a contrast between material parameters of basal cell carcinoma and healthy skin, and we have also compared the THz material parameters of dysplastic and non-dysplastic pigmentary nevi in order to study the ability for early melanoma diagnosis. Significant differences between the THz material parameters of healthy skin and pathology have been detected, thus, THz pulsed spectroscopy promises to be become an effective tool for non-invasive diagnosis of skin neoplasms.\n\nClinical applications of CO2 laser resurfacing in the treatment of various pathologic skin disorders\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGiler, Shamai\n\n1997-12-01\n\nCO2 laser skin resurfacing devices are widely used in cosmetic surgery for the treatment of facial rhytides, acne scars and aging skin. This technique is also useful in the treatment of various benign and premalignant or multiple pathological skin conditions and disorders originating in the epidermal, dermal and skin appendages, vascular lesions, epidermal nevi, infected wounds and ulcers, and keloids. Various surgical techniques have been developed in our clinic using laser resurfacing in the treatment of more than 2,000 patients with various skin pathologic disorders. We describe our experience with the various techniques used. The precise depth control and ablation properties combined with the hemostatic and sterilizing effects of the CO2 laser beam, reduction of the possibility of bleeding, infection and damage to healthy tissues, make the CO2 laser resurfacing techniques the treatment of choice for cosmetic surgery and treatment of benign, premalignant and multiple pathologic skin conditions.\n\nAbsorption spectra and light penetration depth of normal and pathologically altered human skin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarun, V. V.; Ivanov, A. P.; Volotovskaya, A. V.; Ulashchik, V. S.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nA three-layered skin model (stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis) and engineering formulas for radiative transfer theory are used to study absorption spectra and light penetration depths of normal and pathologically altered skin. The formulas include small-angle and asymptotic approximations and a layer-addition method. These characteristics are calculated for wavelengths used for low-intensity laser therapy. We examined several pathologies such as vitiligo, edema, erythematosus lupus, and subcutaneous wound, for which the bulk concentrations of melanin and blood vessels or tissue structure (for subcutaneous wound) change compared with normal skin. The penetration depth spectrum is very similar to the inverted blood absorption spectrum. In other words, the depth is minimal at blood absorption maxima. The calculated absorption spectra enable the power and irradiation wavelength providing the required light effect to be selected. Relationships between the penetration depth and the diffuse reflectance coefficient of skin (unambiguously expressed through the absorption coefficient) are analyzed at different wavelengths. This makes it possible to find relationships between the light fields inside and outside the tissue.\n\n[Pit-picking surgery for pilonidal disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nIesalnieks, I; Deimel, S; Kienle, K; Schlitt, H J; ZÃ¼lke, C\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe pit-picking method was first described by J. Bascom in 1980, however, this minimally invasive technique is used only by a minority of surgeons yet. Surgery was performed under local anesthesia. All primary pits in the midline were removed by excising a border of skin of <1 mm and a 1 cm long incision was made parallel to one side of the cleft to open the chronic abscess cavity. No specific postoperative wound care was given. Pit-picking surgery was carried out 157 times in a total of 153 patients (126 males) between June 2007 and November 2010. Follow-up information was available in 123 cases and 21 patients (17%) developed disease recurrence after a mean follow-up time of 7.1 months. By multivariate analysis, a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2) (p=0.019) and duration of the disease of â¥6 months (p=0.017) were statistically significantly associated with disease recurrence after pit-picking surgery. The recurrence occurred more often in male than in female patients (20% versus 4.5%, p=0.12) Patients with pilonidal disease can be successfully treated by the pit-picking procedure in more than 80% of selected cases. Female patients and non-overweight male patients with short-term disease benefit most from this treatment method.\n\nSkin aging: molecular pathology, dermal remodelling and the imaging revolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nNewton, V L; Mcconnell, J C; Hibbert, S A; Graham, H K; Watson, R E\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSkin is a multifunctional organ but, alongside every other organ system, is subject to both intrinsic (chronological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging, resulting in a loss of functional capacity. Cutaneous aging manifests as an observable change in the external appearance of the skin, the major accelerator of the aging process being our interactions with our environment, such as chronic exposure to solar irradiation (UV, IR or visible wavelengths of light). The aim of this contribution, therefore, was to provide a review of the pathological mechanisms which may play roles in the development of extrinsic, mainly photo-, aging and to review how these molecular changes impact on the structure of the organ as a whole, resulting in loss of function. Finally, we will describe the advances which are occurring in imaging techniques which may allow further characterisation of aged skin.\n\n[Effect of tobacco smoking on skin and mucosa appearance, ageing and pathological conditions].\n\nPubMed\n\nCzogaÅa, Jan; Goniewicz, Maciej Å; Czubek, Agnieszka; GoÅabek, Karolina; Sobczak, Andrzej\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTobacco smoking is considered to be one of the main factors that negatively affect the skin, mucous membranes and teeth, i.e. the body parts that decide on the so called 'healthy look' and 'attraction'. This paper is a review of literature on the subject of harmful and pathological influence of tobacco smoking on the skin and the immunological system. Furthermore, the paper described such smoking results as wrinkle development, skin elasticity and thickness loss, as well as a decreased ability of tissues to regenerate. Finally, the authors discussed various diseases connected with tobacco use: changes in the skin, teeth and mucous membranes, and cancerous lesions.\n\nAssessment of Breast, Brain and Skin Pathological Tissue Using Full Field OCM\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDalimier, EugÃ©nie; Assayag, Osnath; Harms, Fabrice; Boccara, A. Claude\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to assess whether the images of the breast, brain, and skin tissue obtained by FFOCM contain sufficient detail to allow pathologists to make a diagnosis of cancer and other pathologies comparable to what was obtained by conventional histological techniques. More precisely, it is necessary to verify on FFOCM images if it is possible to differentiate a healthy area from a pathological area. The reader interested in other organs or in animal studies may find a large number of 2D or 3D images in the atlas [2].\n\nEffectiveness and Advantages of On-Site Pathology Services in the Care of Patients With Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachan, Mac; Zitelli, John; Brodland, David\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOn-site pathology services are an integral part of many dermatology and surgical dermatology practices in the United States. Assess the effectiveness and advantages of on-site pathology services. Biopsy data from 7 practices with on-site pathology services were reviewed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of malignancies from all lesional biopsies. Patient preference and convenience were queried and measured with satisfaction surveys. Of note, 1,052/1,379 (76.3%) of biopsies demonstrated a malignancy. Most patients underwent treatment of malignant lesions on a different day than the biopsy. Of the patients who scheduled a return visit for surgery on a later date, 42/246 (17.1%) reported incurring additional costs and 44/249 (17.7%) had a relative/friend who was inconvenienced. On-site pathology services provide efficient, effective, and convenient care for skin cancer patients. Fellowship-trained dermatologic surgeons use on-site pathology services to diagnose and treat clinically relevant nonmelanoma skin cancer.\n\nAbnormal brain activation in excoriation (skin-picking) disorder: evidence from an executive planning fMRI study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOdlaug, Brian L.; Hampshire, Adam; Chamberlain, Samuel R.; Grant, Jon E.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder (SPD) is a relatively common psychiatric condition whose neurobiological basis is unknown. Aims To probe the function of fronto-striatal circuitry in SPD. Method Eighteen participants with SPD and 15 matched healthy controls undertook an executive planning task (Tower of London) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Activation during planning was compared between groups using region of interest and whole-brain permutation cluster approaches. Results The SPD group exhibited significant functional underactivation in a cluster encompassing bilateral dorsal striatum (maximal in right caudate), bilateral anterior cingulate and right medial frontal regions. These abnormalities were, for the most part, outside the dorsal planning network typically activated by executive planning tasks. Conclusions Abnormalities of neural regions involved in habit formation, action monitoring and inhibition appear involved in the pathophysiology of SPD. Implications exist for understanding the basis of excessive grooming and the relationship of SPD with putative obsessiveâcompulsive spectrum disorders. PMID:26159604\n\nPathology of skin diseases. A study from Western Saudi Arabia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlghanmi, Najla M; Abdullah, Layla S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo describe the histopathological pattern of skin diseases in patients from the western region of Saudi Arabia and to compare this with previously published data from other regions in Saudi Arabia and worldwide. A retrospective review of all skin biopsies received and reported by the Department of Pathology, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January 2005 and December 2010. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic category were divided into melanocytic and non-melanocytic subcategories. Non-neoplastic category was divided into the following subcategories: dermatitis, infection, vascular, vesiculobullous, connective tissue disease, drugs, panniculitis, non-infectious granuloma, degenerative, metabolic, and pigmentary. Three hundred and sixty skin biopsies were reviewed. Out of these, 207 (57.5%) were non-neoplastic skin diseases, while 153 (42.5%) were neoplastic. Both non-neoplastic (female to male ratio of 1.3:1) and neoplastic (female to male ratio of 1.2: 1) categories were more common in females than in males. Among the non-neoplastic category, the most common diagnosed subcategory was vesiculobullous disease (n=46, 22.2%), followed by dermatitis (n=30, 14.5%). The neoplastic category was divided into melanocytic (n=31, 20.3%) and non-melanocytic neoplasms (n=122, 79.7%). Both neoplastic and non-neoplastic categories were most common in the age group of 46 years and older. Vesiculobullous diseases, dermatitis, and infections are the 3 most common non-neoplastic skin diseases and the most common neoplastic are benign non-melanocytic neoplasms. The prevalence of neoplastic and non-neoplastic skin diseases in general increases with age.\n\nAnimal, Microbial, and Fungal Borne Skin Pathology in the Mountain Wilderness: A Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrandenburg, William E; Levandowski, William; Califf, Tom; Manly, Cory; Levandowski, Cecilia Blair\n\n2017-06-01\n\nMountains are home to numerous organisms known to cause skin disease. Bites, stings, poisons, chemicals, toxins, trauma, and infections all contribute to this end. Numerous plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and protozoa are responsible. This paper aims to review skin illness and injury sustained from organisms in the mountains of North America. Other factors such as increased ultraviolet radiation, temperature extremes, and decreasing atmospheric pressure along with human physiologic parameters, which contribute to disease severity, will also be discussed. After reading this review, one should feel more comfortable identifying potentially harmful organisms, as well as diagnosing, treating, and preventing organism-inflicted skin pathology sustained in the high country.

We have followed 10 human VCA recipients (7 with hand allografts, 3 with face allografts) for pathological signs of rejection. All of them developed episodes of acute rejection. Two patients with hand allografts presented in some of their skin biopsies an as yet unreported pathological finding in human VCA, consisting of capillary thromboses (CT) in the upper dermis. Capillary thrombosis was associated with other typical changes of grade II to III VCA rejection, namely, perivascular T cell infiltrates, but not with vascular C4d deposits (in formalin-fixed tissue). Clinically, the lesions presented as red or violaceous (lichenoid) cutaneous maculopapules. The first patient had several episodes of acute rejection during the 7-year follow-up. The second patient developed donor-specific antibodies; some months after CT were first observed, he developed chronic rejection leading to partial amputation of the allograft. Pathological examination of the skin showed graft vasculopathy and occasional C4d deposits in cutaneous capillaries. Capillary thrombosis seems to be a novel pathologic finding associated with human VCA rejection. Although its mechanism (immunologic vs nonimmunologic) remains unclear, this finding could carry an unfavorable prognostic significance, prompting close monitoring of the patients for severe/chronic rejection.\n\nOrder-picking in deep cold--physiological responses of younger and older females. Part 2: body core temperature and skin surface temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaldus, Sandra; Kluth, Karsten; Strasser, Helmut\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSo far, it was unclear to what extent working in deep cold-storage depots has an influence on female order-pickers body core temperature and skin surface temperature considering different age groups. Physiological effects of order-picking in a chill room (+3Â°C) and cold store (-24Â°C) were examined on 30 female subjects (Ss), classified in two age groups (20- to 35- year-olds and 40- to 65-year-olds). The body core temperature was taken every 15 min at the tympanum and the skin surface temperature was recorded continuously at seven different positions. Working in the chill room induced a decrease of the body core temperature up to 0.5K in comparison to the value at the outset for both age groups which could be compensated by all Ss during the breaks. Working in the cold store caused a decline up to 1.1K for the younger Ss and 1.3K for the older Ss. A complete warming-up during the breaks was often not possible. Regarding the skin surface temperature, working in the chill room can be considered as unproblematic, whereas significantly lower temperatures at nose, fingers and toes, associated with substantial negative subjective sensations, were recorded while working in the cold store.\n\nComputational analysis identifies putative prognostic biomarkers of pathological scarring in skin wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagaraja, Sridevi; Chen, Lin; DiPietro, Luisa A; Reifman, Jaques; Mitrophanov, Alexander Y\n\n2018-02-20\n\nPathological scarring in wounds is a prevalent clinical outcome with limited prognostic options. The objective of this study was to investigate whether cellular signaling proteins could be used as prognostic biomarkers of pathological scarring in traumatic skin wounds. We used our previously developed and validated computational model of injury-initiated wound healing to simulate the time courses for platelets, 6 cell types, and 21 proteins involved in the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing. Next, we analysed thousands of simulated wound-healing scenarios to identify those that resulted in pathological (i.e., excessive) scarring. Then, we identified candidate proteins that were elevated (or decreased) at the early stages of wound healing in those simulations and could therefore serve as predictive biomarkers of pathological scarring outcomes. Finally, we performed logistic regression analysis and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to quantitatively assess the predictive accuracy of the model-identified putative biomarkers. We identified three proteins (interleukin-10, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and fibronectin) whose levels were elevated in pathological scars as early as 2Â weeks post-wounding and could predict a pathological scarring outcome occurring 40Â days after wounding with 80% accuracy. Our method for predicting putative prognostic wound-outcome biomarkers may serve as an effective means to guide the identification of proteins predictive of pathological scarring.\n\nEffect of seasonal affective disorder and pathological tanning motives on efficacy of an appearance-focused intervention to prevent skin cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nHillhouse, Joel; Turrisi, Rob; Stapleton, Jerod; Robinson, June\n\n2010-05-01\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of an appearance-focused intervention to prevent skin cancer in individuals reporting seasonal affective disorder (SAD) symptoms and pathological tanning motives. Randomized, controlled clinical trial. College campus. Four hundred thirty adult female indoor tanners (200 in the intervention group and 230 control participants). A booklet discussing the history of tanning, current tanning norms, UV radiation's effects on skin, recommendations for indoor tanning use focusing on abstinence and harm reduction recommendations, and information on healthier, appearance-enhancing alternatives to tanning. Self-reported attitudes, intentions, and tanning behaviors; pathological tanning motives assessed by a questionnaire developed for this study; and SAD symptoms assessed by the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire. Two of the 4 pathological tanning scales, opiatelike reactions to tanning and dissatisfaction with natural skin tone, were significant moderators demonstrating stronger treatment effects for individuals scoring higher on these scales. Treatment effects were equivalently positive (ie, no significant moderator effects) for all levels of SAD symptoms and all levels of the other 2 pathological tanning motive scales (ie, perceiving tanning as a problem and tolerance to the effects of tanning). The appearance-focused skin cancer prevention intervention is robust enough to reduce indoor tanning among tanners who exhibit SAD symptoms or pathological tanning motives. Tailored interventions may address individuals' motivations for tanning and their relation to maladaptive behavior, such as dissatisfaction with appearance or the need for relaxation because of anxiety.\n\nOnline teaching of inflammatory skin pathology by a French-speaking International University Network\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction Developments in technology, web-based teaching and whole slide imaging have broadened the teaching horizon in anatomic pathology. Creating online learning material including many types of media such as radiologic images, whole slides, videos, clinical and macroscopic photographs, is now accessible to most universities. Unfortunately, a major limiting factor to maintain and update the learning material is the amount of resources needed. In this perspective, a French-national university network was initiated in 2011 to build joint online teaching modules consisting of clinical cases and tests. The network has since expanded internationally to QuÃ©bec, Switzerland and Ivory Coast. Method One of the first steps of the project was to build a learning module on inflammatory skin pathology for interns and residents in pathology and dermatology. A pathology resident from QuÃ©bec spent 6 weeks in France and Switzerland to develop the contents and build the module on an e-learning Moodle platform under the supervision of two dermatopathologists. The learning module contains text, interactive clinical cases, tests with feedback, virtual slides, images and clinical photographs. For that module, the virtual slides are decentralized in 2 universities (Bordeaux and Paris 7). Each university is responsible of its own slide scanning, image storage and online display with virtual slide viewers. Results The module on inflammatory skin pathology includes more than 50 web pages with French original content, tests and clinical cases, links to over 45 virtual images and more than 50 microscopic and clinical photographs. The whole learning module is being revised by four dermatopathologists and two senior pathologists. It will be accessible to interns and residents in the spring of 2014. The experience and knowledge gained from that work will be transferred to the next international resident whose work will be aimed at creating lung and breast pathology learning modules\n\nOnline teaching of inflammatory skin pathology by a French-speaking International University Network.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerron, Emilie; Battistella, Maxime; Vergier, BÃ©atrice; Fiche, Maryse; Bertheau, Philippe; TÃªtu, Bernard\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDevelopments in technology, web-based teaching and whole slide imaging have broadened the teaching horizon in anatomic pathology.

Effect of the structure of the fluorescent fatty acyl residue.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLevade, T; Gatt, S; Salvayre, R\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThree fluorescent analogues of sphingomyelin (SPM), each containing pyrene in the fatty acyl residue, were synthesized and employed for the study of their mode of uptake by, and degradation within, intact cultured human skin fibroblasts. These were prepared by condensing sphingosylphosphocholine and the following fatty acids: pyrenedodecanoic acid (P12), pyrenesulphonylaminoundecanoic acid (PSA11) and pyrenepropenoic acid (P3:1). The cell association and catabolism of these SPM analogues by normal, Niemann-Pick-disease-Type-A and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-negative familial hypercholesterolaemia fibroblasts were investigated and compared with the metabolism of [cholinemethyl-14C]sphingomyelin. The catabolism of the fluorescent derivatives was monitored by measuring the appearance of the corresponding fluorescent ceramides. Two modes of uptake and degradation patterns were observed. Thus P12-SPM and radiolabelled SPM were taken up by LDL-receptor-mediated endocytosis when incubated with serum-containing medium, this conclusion being supported by the very low uptake by familial-hypercholesterolaemia fibroblasts, which lack the apolipoprotein-B/E receptor. After uptake, these compounds were metabolically degraded solely by the lysosomal sphingomyelinase, as evidenced by the fact that more than 98% of the SPM remained undegraded in Niemann-Pick-disease cells. By contrast, PSA11- and P3:1-SPMs were taken up by a receptor-independent endocytic pathway, as indicated by the similar rates of uptake in control and familial-hypercholesterolaemia cells in the absence or presence of fetal-calf serum in the culture medium. The degradation of PSA11-SPM and P3:1-SPM was brought about, in the main, by the lysosomal sphingomyelinase, but also by a yet uncharacterized process. The latter catabolic pathway, active in Niemann-Pick-disease-Type-A fibroblasts, seems to differ from the neutral Mg2(+)-dependent sphingomyelinase whose activity was undetectable in homogenates of\n\nExamine Your Skin\n\nMedlinePlus Videos and Cool Tools\n\n...

For the most of cutaneous and gastrointestinal tumours could be obtained better prognoses for patients, if an earlier and precise diagnostics procedure is applied. One of the most promising approaches for development of improved diagnostic techniques, is based on optical detection, and analysis of the signatures of biological tissues for detecting the presence of pathological alterations in the investigated objects. It is important to develop and combine novel diagnostic techniques for an accurate early stage diagnosis to improve the chances for skin and GIT tumours treatment. Optical techniques are very promising methods for such noninvasive diagnosis of skin and mucosa tumours, possessing the advantages of deep imaging depth, high resolution, fast imaging speed, and noninvasive character of detection. In this study we combine autofluorescence spectroscopy and optical imaging techniques to develop more precise evaluation of the tissue pathologies investigated. We obtain chromophore maps for GIT and cutaneous samples, with better visualization of the tumours borders and margins. In addition, fluorescence spectra give us information about the early changes in chromophores' contents into the tissues during neoplasia growth.\n\nPsychogenic skin excoriations: diagnostic criteria, semiological analysis and psychiatric profiles.\n\nPubMed\n\nMisery, Laurent; Chastaing, Myriam; Touboul, Sylviane; Callot, ValÃ©rie; Schollhammer, Martine; Young, Paul; Feton-Danou, Nathalie; Dutray, Sabine\n\n2012-07-01\n\nPsychogenic excoriations are also called neurotic excoriations, dermatillomania or skin picking syndrome. We proposed diagnostic criteria and then performed a study of the psychiatric profiles of outpatients with psychogenic excoriations and the circumstancesÂ around the creation of these excoriations. Although the results must be interpreted with caution because the study was performed with only 10 patients, interesting data is provided about the onset of psychogenic excoriations, the behaviour of picking, and comorbidity. Common or specific characteristics were identified according to type of case. The majority of patients associated first excoriations with personal problems. Four patients reported abuse in childhood or adolescence. This study confirms that skin picking is an impulsive reaction and does not belong to the obsessive-compulsive disorders: impulsivity is defined by ineffective or failing control resulting in uninhibited behaviour.\n\nNewborn Skin: Common Skin Problems.\n\nPubMed\n\nKutlubay, Zekayi; Tanakol, Ali; EngÃ½n, Burhan; Onel, Cristina; SÃ½msek, Ersin; Serdaroglu, Server; Tuzun, YalÃ§Ã½n; Yilmaz, Erkan; Eren, BÃ¼lent\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe newborn skin can be separated from adult's skin in several ways. In dermatologic examination it can be easily observed that it is thinner, less hairy and has less sweat and sebaceous gland secretions. These differentiations present especially in preterm newborns. Their skin is exposed to mechanical trauma, bacteria and weather, heat alterations. At birth, newborn skin is protected by the coverage of vernix caseosa, which has lubricating and antibacterial features and its pH ranges from 6.7 to 7.4. Beneath the vernix caseosa the skin has a pH of 5.5-6.0. In newborn dermatologic examination it is very important to distinguish transient benign dermatoses and severe diseases, make early diagnosis and treat congenital skin disorders. Although the benign cases are common in this life period, clinical presentations can be much more exaggerated, dramatic and cause a great deal of anxiety to parents. Therefore, as a doctor, knowing the dermatological, pathological and non-pathological common skin rashes guides the family in the right direction, offers advice to reduce uncertainty and time for the treatment of severe conditions and builds a confidential doctor-patient relationship. In this review, our aim is to provide a general overview to common skin rashes in newborn period.\n\nPicking among pen-reared quail\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNestler, R.B.; Coburn, D.R.; Titus, H.W.\n\n1945-01-01\n\nDuring five years (1939-43) of nutritional research on pen-reared bobwhite quail at the Patuxent Research Refuge, Bowie, Maryland, observations on picking among birds of all ages showed the following results: 1. Picking occurred on all grains tested: corn, wheat, oats, oat groats, barley, millet, buckwheat, kaffir, and mixtures of cereals. The lowest incidence was with buckwheat as the sole grain in a growing diet....2. Picking occurred on all levels of fiber from one to 11per cent in a growing diet....3. Picking occurred on various grinds of corn, barley, and oats, but was least when these cereals were ground in a hammer mill with 3/32 inch mesh screen....4. The incidence was as high on diets containing animal protein as on those containing no animal protein. ....5. After picking began, the addition of one or two per cent of salt to the diet for several days was effective, in many instances, in checking the disorder. Results at the Refuge and the answers to questionnaires from 222 private propagators of gamebirds showed that in two-thirds. of the cases, treatment with an increased quantity of salt successfully stopped the trouble. As a preventative, however, salt was of little value. Picking occurred on both low and high levels of salt.....6. Supplementing the regular diet with certain feed concentrates such as fishmeal, soybean oil meal, liver meal, or chopped greens offered in a separate feeder for a day or two, was as efficacious as the addition of salt.....7. More picking occurred among quail chicks on a 22 per cent level of protein than on higher levels.....8. There was less picking on diets relished by the birds than on those seemingly unpalatable.....9. There was no correlation. between the amount of floor space per chick and the incidence of picking.....10. Increasing the feeding and drinking space seemed to have a marked beneficial effect.....11. Some adult birds on wire floors resorted to self-picking of their feet after the toes were frost-bitten.\n\nPercutaneous irreversible electroporation for breast tissue and breast cancer: safety, feasibility, skin effects and radiologic-pathologic correlation in an animal study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Sheng; Chen, Fei; Shen, Lujun; Zeng, Qi; Wu, Peihong\n\n2016-08-05\n\nTo study the safety, feasibility and skin effects of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for breast tissue and breast cancer in animal models. Eight pigs were used in this study. IRE was performed on the left breasts of the pigs with different skin-electrode distances, and the right breasts were used as controls. The electrodes were placed 1-8Â mm away from the skin, with an electrode spacing of 1.5-2Â cm. Imaging and pathological examinations were performed at specific time points for follow-up evaluation. Vital signs, skin damage, breast tissue changes and ablation efficacy were also closely observed. Eight rabbit models with or without VX2 breast tumor implantations were used to further assess the damage caused by and the repair of thin skin after IRE treatment for breast cancer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastosonography were used to investigate ablation efficacy and safety. During IRE, the color of the pig breast skin reversibly changed. When the skin-electrode distance was 3Â mm, the breast skin clearly changed, becoming white in the center and purple in the surrounding region during IRE. One small purulent skin lesion was detected several days after IRE. When the skin-electrode distance was 5-8Â mm, the breast skin became red during IRE. However, the skin architecture was normal when evaluated using gross pathology and hematoxylin-eosin staining. When the skin-electrode distance was 1Â mm, skin atrophy and yellow glabrescence occurred in the rabbit breasts after IRE. When the skin-electrode distance wasÂ â¥5Â mm, there was no skin damage in the rabbit model regardless of breast cancer implantation. After IRE, complete ablation of the targeted breast tissue or cancer was confirmed, and apoptosis was detected in the target tissue and outermost epidermal layer. In the ablated breasts of the surviving animals, complete mammary regeneration with normal skin and hair was observed. Furthermore, no massive fibrosis or mass formation were detected on\n\nTypes A and B Niemann-Pick disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuchman, Edward H; Wasserstein, Melissa P\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTwo distinct metabolic abnormalities are encompassed under the eponym Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). The first is due to the deficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). Patients with ASM deficiency are classified as having types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). Type A NPD patients exhibit hepatosplenomegaly in infancy and profound central nervous system involvement. They rarely survive beyond two years of age. Type B patients also have hepatosplenomegaly and pathologic alterations of their lungs, but there are usually no central nervous system signs. The age of onset and rate of disease progression varies greatly among type B patients, and they frequently live into adulthood. Recently, patients with phenotypes intermediate between types A and B NPD also have been identified. These individuals represent the expected continuum caused by inheriting different mutations in the ASM gene (SMPD1). Patients in the second NPD category are designated as having types C and D NPD. These patients may have mild hepatosplenomegaly, but the central nervous system is profoundly affected. Impaired intracellular trafficking of cholesterol causes types C and D NPD, and two distinct gene defects have been found. In this chapter only types A and B NPD will be discussed. Copyright Â© 2014.

A.; Zeiler, C. P.; Anderson, D.; Pingitore, N. E.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe initial effort of the Seismogram Picking Error from Analyst Review (SPEAR) project has been to establish a common set of seismograms to be picked by the seismological community. Currently we have 13 analysts from 4 institutions that have provided picks on the set of 26 seismograms. In comparing the picks thus far, we have identified consistent biases between picks from different institutions; effects of the experience of analysts; and the impact of signal-to-noise on picks. The institutional bias in picks brings up the important concern that picks will not be the same between different catalogs. This difference means less precision and accuracy when combing picks from multiple institutions. We also note that depending on the experience level of the analyst making picks for a catalog the error could fluctuate dramatically. However, the experience level is based off of number of years in picking seismograms and this may not be an appropriate criterion for determining an analyst's precision. The common data set of seismograms provides a means to test an analyst's level of precision and biases. The analyst is also limited by the quality of the signal and we show that the signal-to-noise ratio and pick error are correlated to the location, size and distance of the event. This makes the standard estimate of picking error based on SNR more complex because additional constraints are needed to accurately constrain the measurement error. We propose to extend the current measurement of error by adding the additional constraints of institutional bias and event characteristics to the standard SNR measurement. We use multivariate statistics to model the data and provide constraints to accurately assess earthquake location and measurement errors.\n\nSkin pathology and medical prognosis in medieval Europe: the secrets of Hippocrates.\n\nPubMed\n\nAckerman Smoller, L\n\n2000-12-01\n\nThis article analyzes a medieval text known as The Secrets of Hippocrates. Neither secret (because of its wide circulation in manuscript and print) nor by Hippocrates, the work offered readers a means of offering a prognosis of impending death based on observable signs on the skin. Although the aphorisms that make up the text make little sense in a modern medical understanding, the Secrets of Hippocrates fits well within three medieval traditions: the tradition of secrets literature, the medieval medical tradition, and the tradition of medieval Christian views about the body. First, like other books of secrets, a genre to whose conventions the text closely adheres, the Secrets of Hippocrates offered a shortcut to socially useful knowledge: the ability to offer an accurate medical prognosis. Second, the treatise corresponded to the medieval physician's concern for the so-called nonnaturals, such as diet and exercise. Third, it fit with a medieval Christian notion that sickness and sin were related, as were sin and ugliness. Just as a leper's deformities were a window to his sinful soul, so skin pathologies could clue a medieval physician to the lethal disease hidden inside the body.\n\nDetermination of the pathological state of skin samples by optical polarimetry parameters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFanjul-VÃ©lez, F.; Ortega-Quijano, N.; Buelta, L.; Arce-Diego, J. L.\n\n2008-11-01\n\nPolarimetry is widely known to involve a series of powerful optical techniques that characterize the polarization behaviour of a sample. In this work, we propose a method for applying polarimetric procedures to the characterization of biological tissues, in order to differentiate between healthy and pathologic tissues on a polarimetric basis. Usually, medical morphology diseases are diagnosed based on histological alterations of the tissue. The fact that these alterations will be reflected in polarization information highlights the suitability of polarimetric procedures for diagnostic purposes. The analysis is mainly focused on the depolarization properties of the media, as long as the internal structure strongly affects the polarization state of the light that interacts with the sample. Therefore, a method is developed in order to determine the correlation between pathological ultraestructural characteristics and the subsequent variations in the polarimetric parameters of the backscattered light. This study is applied to three samples of porcine skin corresponding to a healthy region, a mole, and a cancerous region. The results show that the method proposed is indeed an adequate technique in order to achieve an early, accurate and effective cancer detection.\n\nModeling picking on pharmaceutical tablets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSwaminathan, Shrikant\n\nTablets are the most popular solid dosage form in the pharmaceutical industry because they are cheap to manufacture, chemically and mechanically stable and easy to transport and fairly easy to control dosage. Pharmaceutical tableting operations have been around for decades however the process is still not well understood. One of the common problems faced during the production of pharmaceutical tablets by powder compaction is sticking of powder to the punch face, This is known as 'sticking'. A more specialized case of sticking is picking when the powder is pulled away form the compact in the vicinity of debossed features. In the pharmaceutical industry, picking is solved by trial and error which is an expensive, labor intensive and time consuming affair. The objective of this work was to develop, validate, and implement a modeling framework for predicting picking in powder compacts. The model was developed in Abaqus a commercially available finite element package. The resulting model was used to investigate the influence of debossed feature geometry viz. the stroke angle and degree of pre-pick, and, influence of lubricant on picking.

The cardinal features are circumscribed cortical atrophy most often affecting the frontal and temporal poles and argyrophilic, round intraneuronal inclusions (Pick bodies). Clinical manifestations reflect the distribution of cortical degeneration, and personality deterioration and memory deficits are often more severe than visuospatial and apraxic disorders that are common in Alzheimer's disease, but clinical overlap with other non-Alzheimer degenerative disorders is increasingly recognized. Neuronal loss and degeneration are usually maximal in the limbic system, including hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Numerous Pick bodies are often present in the dentate fascia of the hippocampus. Less specific features include leukoencephalopathy and ballooned cortical neurons (Pick cells). Glial reaction is often pronounced in affected cerebral gray and white matter. Tau-immunoreactive glial inclusions are a recently recognized finding in Pick's disease, and neuritic changes have also recently been described. Variable involvement of the deep gray matter and the brainstem is typical, with a predilection for the monoaminergic nuclei and nuclei of the pontine base. Neurochemical studies demonstrate deficits in intrinsic cortical neurotransmitter systems (e.g., somatostatin), but inconsistent loss of transmitters in systems projecting to the cortex (e.g., cholinergic neurons of the basal nucleus). Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies have demonstrated that abnormal tau proteins are the major structural components of Pick bodies. A specific tau protein immunoblotting pattern different from that seen in Alzheimer's disease and certain other disorders has been suggested in some studies. A specific molecular marker and a genetic locus for familial cases are not known.\n\nSkin ulcers in estuarine fishes: a comparative pathological evaluation of wild and laboratory-exposed fish.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVogelbein, W K; Shields, J D; Haas, L W; Reece, K S; Zwerner, D E\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe toxic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida Steidinger & Burkholder has recently been implicated as the etiologic agent of acute mass mortalities and skin ulcers in menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus, and other fishes from mid-Atlantic U.S. estuaries. However, evidence for this association is largely circumstantial and controversial. We exposed tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) to Pfiesteria shumwayae Glasgow & Burkholder (identification based on scanning electron microscopy and molecular analyses) and compared the resulting pathology to the so-called Pfiesteria-specific lesions occurring in wild menhaden. The tilapia challenged by high concentrations (2,000-12,000 cells/mL) of P. shumwayaeexhibited loss of mucus coat and scales plus mild petecchial hemorrhage, but no deeply penetrating chronic ulcers like those in wild menhaden. Histologically, fish exhibited epidermal erosion with bacterial colonization but minimal associated inflammation. In moribund fish, loss of epidermis was widespread over large portions of the body. Similar erosion occurred in the mucosa lining the oral and branchial cavities. Gills exhibited epithelial lifting, loss of secondary lamellar structure, and infiltration by lymphoid cells. Epithelial lining of the lateral line canal (LLC) and olfactory organs exhibited severe necrosis. Visceral organs, kidney, and neural tissues (brain, spinal cord, ganglia, peripheral nerves) were histologically normal. An unexpected finding was the numerous P. shumwayae cells adhering to damaged skin, skin folds, scale pockets, LLC, and olfactory tissues. In contrast, histologic evaluation of skin ulcers in over 200 wild menhaden from Virginia and Maryland portions of the Chesapeake Bay and the Pamlico Estuary, North Carolina, revealed that all ulcers harbored a deeply invasive, highly pathogenic fungus now known to be Aphanomyces invadans. In menhaden the infection always elicited severe myonecrosis and intense granulomatous myositis.

It is caused in 95% of cases by a mutation in the NPC1 gene that encodes NPC1, an integral transmembrane protein localised to the limiting membrane of the lysosome. There is no cure for NP-C but there is a disease-modifying drug (miglustat) that slows disease progression but with associated side effects. Here, we demonstrate in a well-characterised mouse model of NP-C that a single administration of AAV-mediated gene therapy to the brain can significantly extend lifespan, improve quality of life, prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration, reduce biochemical pathology and normalize or improve various indices of motor function. Over-expression of human NPC1 does not cause adverse effects in the brain and correctly localises to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Furthermore, we directly compare gene therapy to licensed miglustat. Even at a low dose, gene therapy has all the benefits of miglustat but without adverse effects. On the basis of these findings and on-going ascendency of the field, we propose intracerebroventricular gene therapy as a potential therapeutic option for clinical use in NP-C.\n\nColor structured light imaging of skin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Bin; Lesicko, John; Moy, Austin; Reichenberg, Jason; Sacks, Michael; Tunnell, James W.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe illustrate wide-field imaging of skin using a structured light (SL) approach that highlights the contrast from superficial tissue scattering.
