Or, send an email to alumnirecords@sigmanucornell.org, we would love to hear from you!\n\nGamma Theta in the 1940s â I was there!\n\nEditorâs Note: Many thanks to Jerry Frost â48 for sharing memories of his time at Sigma Nu, and his wonderful donation of $25,000 to the windows renovation project.\n\nYes, World War II did come to Cornell and Gamma Theta. I (and I presume thousands of others across the country) was allowed to enlist in the Navy and graduate from high school in three years. Thus, my high school class of â45 graduated on a Monday night in 1944. The following Friday afternoon I was marching up the hill to Sage Hall to be issued uniforms, shoes, and bedding. Arms full, I was directed to my dorm, which carried the strange name: Llenroc. (I later learned that these fancy digs had been the home of Cornellâs first president and the word was Cornell spelled backwards.) All fraternity houses, as well as other facilities across campus, had been requisitioned by the Navy as housing for the V-12 Naval Officer trainees.\n\nAs we were officially in the Navy, we were in uniform at all times. Campus swarmed with sailors dressed in âwhitesâ and those funny hats in summer, âbluesâ and a knitted watch cap in cold weather. Reveille at 6:00 a.m.; muster (roll call) for breakfast at 8:00 a.m.; inspection and lunch at 12:30 p.m., muster for dinner at 6:00 p.m., in our room at 8:00 p.m. and lights out at 10:00 p.m. Saturday afternoons were reserved for drill. All meals were served in dining halls (temporary buildings long since removed) situated below the Baker halls. Someone was on fire watch in all dorms 24/7. Heaven help you if you had a quiz the morning after you stood a 2:00â4:00 a.m. watch at a remote building.\n\nOwen âO.J.â Black was one of my three new roommates at Llenroc. It was O.J. who introduced me to Sigma Nu. I am told that during the war years, the chapter, significantly reduced in size and, burdened by restrictive military schedules, was able to hold only a few sporadic meetings in a building downtown. I pledged in the spring of 1946 and moved into the house that fall. Preston âHackâ Hackley, general factotum, had been retained by the Navy to maintain the building, so if you will excuse me, everything at Willard Way was âshipshape.â The carpets, furniture, pool table, and dining tables were returned from storage and were unharmed.\n\nFraternity life seemed normal. We studied in our rooms, slept in the loft, and were served excellent meals in the dining room. Chapter meetings were according to protocol. I bought the candy store under the stairs. Bad debts were not a problem. There were many more students on campus, particularly women, which previously had been in short supply, and guys in sailor suits were missing.\n\nThree-day house parties took place three times a year, a long enough period to permit âimportsâ from off-campus. Hack maintained a strict requirement that women slept on the third floor and no men above the second. Barton Hall was the scene of the Saturday night dance. Big bands were the rage at that time: Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Vaughn Monroe, and Johnny Long. Vaughn was primarily known for his rendition of âRacing with the Moonâ (âhigh above the midnight skyâ). A Johnny Long special was âThe White Star of Sigma Nuâ (the bright star of Sigma Nu). Three bands rotated continuously throughout the night, and we could relax on furniture from the house that had been moved to curtained-off spaces surrounding the dance floor. These were magical events in my memory. However, after spending three whole days with the same girl, I never saw fit to date her again.\n\nRush was in springtime as I recall. The stunts of the time included ice hockey on the dining room tile floor, bob for apples in a pail of water, then immediately search for a quarter in a pan of flour, followed by brothers in the window above attempting to drop the contents of a raw egg into the open mouths of the pledges below. GIs who had returned to campus from the horrors of war in Europe or the Pacific rightfully did not appreciate this humiliation from youths who had not served. I regret my part in these events.\n\nIt has been good to reminisce. I treasure my two years at 230 Willard Way.\n\nFraternally,\n\nJerry Frost BCE â48\n\njerryfrost10@comcast.net\n\nIn Memory of Arthur Wolcott â49\n\nWe are saddened to inform you of the passing of Arthur Wolcott â49. The Wolcott familyâs ties to Sigma Nu extend back nearly 100 years, as Arthurâs older brothers Jerome â29 and Sam â36 were also Sigma Nus (Sam was the one who built the walk-in cooler in the kitchen). Son Mark â83 is a Sigma Nu, as is Markâs son, Michael â15. Daughter Grace â87 was a Sigma Nu Little Sister and is married to Sigma Nu Aaron Wadell â83.\n\nArthur was born in Corning, NY, in 1926 and passed away peacefully on September 24, 2021, in Sarasota, FL, at the age of 95. He graduated from Cornell in 1949 with a BA degree in economics and was a veteran of World War II, having served in both the European and Pacific theaters.\n\nArthur married the love of his life and best friend, Audrey Strode, in August of 1949. During that same month, Arthur founded Seneca Foods Corporation by leasing a bankrupt grape juice plant in Dundee, NY. Today, Seneca is headquartered in Janesville, WI. The company is one of the largest processors of fruits and vegetables in the United States. Arthur was chairman and president of Seneca Foods from 1949 to 1987, and he served as chairman of the Board of Directors until his passing. In 2008, he received the Forty-Niner Service Award, the food processing industryâs highest award in recognition of his career.\n\nArthur was a true champion of all things Sigma Nu, Cornell, and the Big Red. He was a Presidential Councilor of Cornell University and a member of the Cornell Athletics Hall of Fame. For many years, Arthur, Audrey, and the Wolcott family hosted a Homecoming football tailgate party attended by many Sigma Nus.\n\nâMy Dad loved Cornell and Sigma Nu, and he would often talk about his days living in the house, taking my mom to parties at the house, and he stayed in touch with most of his classmates over the years,â said Mark. âHe also loved Cornell Athletics and was a regular at football games ever since he graduated. He and my mom were there in 1951 when Cornell beat Michigan at Schoellkopf Field!â\n\nArthur was also an avid skier and sailor. On the slopes he was a member of the Hunt Hollow Ski Club and enjoyed many ski trips to the Rocky Mountains and the European Alps. He was also a member of the Keuka Yacht Club and the Sarasota Yacht Club, competing in regattas and cruising to Europe, the Florida Keys, and throughout the Caribbean. In addition to Audrey, his wife of 72 years, Arthur is survived by four children, including Mark and Grace, and 12 grandchildren, including Michael.\n\nThe brotherhood of Sigma Nu extends our condolences to Mark, Michael, Grace, and the entire Wolcott family. Arthur will certainly be missed and remembered for so much.\n\nRemembering Art\n\nMy wife Madolyn and I first met the Wolcotts at a party at the Lodge after a Cornell football game during Trustee-Council weekend, sometime in the 1970s. After that, we saw each other at Cornell and in Sarasota, FL, where we both had homes.\n\nWe went on a Cornell University trip to Cuba with the Wolcotts. During some down time, Art hired a taxi to take him to a grocery store so he could see if Seneca products were being sold. He bought a can of Libbyâs peaches, which cost about three times as much a can would cost in the U.S. When he returned to our hotel, he cut the label off as he wanted to trace the shipping route it had taken to get to Cuba and gave the peaches to the taxi driver.\n\nOver many dinners, Art loved to talk about how Seneca produced and canned their product, especially corn. I learned about developing new seed, planting, harvesting, can manufacturing, canning, and shipping. I think I am qualified to be a Seneca employee!\n\nGlenn Dallas â58\n\nmgdallas@hotmail.com\n\nIn Memory of Charlie Moore â51: a Cornell, Sigma Nu, and Olympic Legend\n\nSigma Nu lost one of its most beloved brothers when Charlie Moore â51 passed away on October 8, 2020. As noted on the Cornell Athletics website, âthe impact on his family, the Big Red, and the sporting and business worlds will long be told.â The same is true of his impact on our chapter, because Charlie was not only an esteemed alumnus but continued to be a staunch supporter of the chapter. He coined the âBuilding a Bridgeâ phrase for our current fundraising effort while attending our annual property association meeting in the fall of 2019.\n\nA fierce competitor on the track, Charlie never lost a race in the 400-meter hurdles during his outstanding career, which included a gold medal in the 1952 Summer Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland. More information on Charlieâs life and legacy can be found at www.CornellBigRed.com.\n\nRemembrance by Jack Vinson â51\n\nJack has been a life-long friend of Charlie. They first met when they joined Sigma Nu together in the fall of 1947.\n\nCharlie Moore was born in 1929 at RD4 Wawaset, Pennsylvania, just south of highway 80, a few miles west of Philadelphia. His father was president of a steel plant that was originated by his grandfather. His father had been on the 1924 US Olympic team. Charlie graduated from Mercersburg Academy, where he was on the track team and was never beaten in the hurdles, which was his specialty. Upon graduation, he planned to go to Penn State, where his father went, but could not be admitted due to the fact that he was not a World War II veteran, something that was necessary at that time. Incidentally, I could not be admitÂ¬ted to Stanford University the same year because I was not a World War II veteran either. Each of us then applied to and was admitted to Cornell University in the fall of 1947. In that year, only veterans of WW II were admitted at Penn State and Stanford.\n\nAs fall classes began, so did fraternity pledging at the dozens of fraternities at Cornell. During the two weeks of pledging, Charlie and I met and got to know each other. Sigma Nu was primarily a fraternity that involved many students who were active in various major sports on campus. After the two-week pledge period, we joined the nineÂ¬teen students who pledged Sigma Nu, ten of whom were veterans and nine of whom were the first recognizable group of civilians who became undergraduate students. Charlie and I were two of the three pledges who were engineering students. During our freshman year, we lived in dormitories but ate meals and enjoyed activities at Sigma Nu. It is important to remember that, for us nine civilian undergraduate students, all other male students were significantly older than we were. During our second year at Cornell, Charlie and I roomed together at Sigma Nu in a two-man study room and slept upstairs as all of us did then, in the dormer.\n\nWe became very close and over and above on campus activities. I also was welcomed at Charlieâs home in Wawaset many times during my return from Kansas City, Missouri, where my folks lived during the five-year undergraduate program.\n\nAt Cornell, Charlie was super as a member of the track team. As a hurdler, he never was defeated while at Mercersburg Academy, and he never was defeated as a Cornell hurdler. He won his hurdling event in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, taking gold against a favored Russian, and one week later at White City Stadium in London, he set a new world record. After that, he hung up his cleats and was never beaten in his specialty in his life.\n\nAfter the sophomore year of the five-year academic program, Charlie married his girlfriend, Judith, who lived in Newark, Delaware, and moved into an apartment in Ithaca. I was the best man at Charlieâs wedding. Charlie took over the operation of his fatherâs firm, later sold it, and became the CEO of several Fortune 500 firms, as well as a member of the US Olympic ComÂ­mittee and its financial committee. He also returned to Ithaca as Cornellâs athletic director in 1994.\n\nDuring the remainder of our lives, we have retained and enjoyed our friendship since 1947, as evidenced by the fact that he attended my 90th birthday here at the Quadrangle in Haverford, Pennsylvania, where I have lived since 2016. I have been an engineering professor at the University of Delaware, where I have served as chairÂ­man of mechanical and aerospace engiÂ­neering for 14 years and the H. Fletcher Brown Professor of Mechanical and AeroÂ­space Engineering for 42 years.\n\nLastly, I am sorry to say that Charlie passed away this last fall.\n\nBrothers interested in connecting with Jack can email his son, Chris Vinson, at ceevee830@gmail.com.\n\nRemembering Rich Shaffer '77\n\nIn the summer 2020 Sigma News, we memorialized the passing of Tom Paddrik â77, one of the âJamestown 5â: five high school friends from Jamestown, New York, who all went to Cornellâs engineering school as freshmen members of the class of 1977 and who all joined Sigma Nu and stayed in close touch after graduation. Unfortunately, we must report we have lost another member of the Jamestown 5 when brother Rich Shaffer â77 lost his 18-month battle with abdominal cancer on March 30, 2021.\n\nGamma Theta extends condolences to his wife, Natalka Bukalo Shaffer, the entire Shaffer family, and his many friends in and out of Sigma Nu. Memories of âShafesâ shared here are from his wife of 41 years, Natalka, and one of the brothers who knew him best, another member of the Jamestown 5, Tom Swanson â77.\n\nRich and I (Tom) were literally connected from birth. We were born on the same day, May 3, 1955, in the same hospital in Jamestown, New York, about an hour apart. We did not formally meet until a few years later, in the seventh grade at Lincoln Jr. High School. Our paths intertwined ever since as junior-high-school, high-school, and then college classmates; brothers at Sigma Nu; and lifelong friends as part of the Jamestown 5 (Tom Paddrik â77, Rich Shaffer â77, Rick Turner â77, Russ Cusimano â77, and me). We did not plan on attending Cornell as a group, but we all applied and got accepted, and it just worked out that way. Richâs uncle was the Cornell baseball coach at the time, and he did a good job of talking up the school. Neither did we plan on all joining Sigma Nu, but during rush season in 1973, Tom Paddrik got the idea we would rush as a âblock,â and Sigma Nu was either smart or too naive to take us all; not sure which. We all lived in the house for three years, where Shafes served as steward and social chairman. Four of the five graduated from the engineering school, while Rich figured out sophomore year engineering was not his calling and transferred to the ag school and concentrated on business and the money end of things.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell in 1977, Rich and fellow Sigma Nu brother Steve Vaccaro â77 moved to northern New Jersey as roommates to begin careers in banking. Rich Rich Shaffer â77 worked for First National Bank and, after completing the management training program, became a commercial loan officer. Rich met his wife, Natalka Bukalo (from the Ukraine), at the First National Bank management training program in 1978, and they were married in April 1980. In 1979, Rich joined Barclays Bank in New York, where he was an officer in investment banking for their energy lending group. While at Barclays, he worked in the UK while attending the bankâs executive development program and was also sent to the Darden School at University of Virginia for an executive management program. Rich also became a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), which began his shift from banking into investment consulting. In 1994, Rich and Natalka cofounded Chartwell Consulting, an investment consulting firm working with retirement plans, endowments and foundations, and family offices. This experience would later profoundly help the Gamma Theta Chapter.\n\nRich loved what he did, but he did not just live to work; he worked and lived a full life. Rich participated in sports growing up. He was our high-school quarterback, and while the sports changed over the years, his passion for sports did not. He loved golf. Rich and I spent many hours together on the Cornell course. He later participated in golf leagues and tournaments. A highlight for him was participating in the Franklin Templeton âShootout,â a pro-amateur event in 2002, where he was paired with golf pros Steve Elkington and Lee Janzen. Rich was introduced to sailing and skiing (as were we all) by Rick Turner. Sailing vacations in the Greek Isles and Belize followed, as did ski trips to Austria, Colorado, Utah, and Canada. Rich also combined his love of good food and wine with traveling. Over the years, he attended four cooking schools in France, Italy, and Spain. He âamortizedâ the cost of those programs by hosting many themed-dinner parties over the years! In 1998, Rich purchased a second home in Colorado Springs, where he was looking forward to retiring. He spent two to three months a year there, enjoying old passions like golf but developing new interests in fly fishing, bird shooting, and deer hunting.\n\nRichâs expertise with Chartwell Consulting was tapped by the Gamma Theta Property Association in 2017 as part of the GT capital campaign to develop a tax-deductible contribution pathway. Thus, the 501(c)(3) Fall Creek Leadership Foundation was formed and approved in May of 2018. His work proved fortuitous during the subsequent suspension, helping to sustain the GTPA until reconstitution of the chapter this year.\n\nRich loved a cigar during golf and poker games and in the evenings. At Sigma Nu, he was a regular at the all-night poker table in the library.\n\nThe Jamestown 5 is now the Jamestown 3, but the comradery, friendship, and brotherhood will never end. Believe in the life of love, walk in the way of honor, serve in the light of truth. Always.\n\nPS: In the memorial to Tom Paddrik, it was said he was an avid shortwave radio fan and held multiple conversations with Saddam Hussein. Not so. It should have said King Hussein of Jordan, two entirely different people.\n\nBrothers interested in connecting with Tom Swanson â77 can email him at tgswanson@cox.net.\n\nSnakes, Memes, and Musk\n\nBy Alex Krakoski â16, Vice President, GTPA\n\nFor the last two years, Max Tave â15 and I have been working part-time with Dot Capital, a NYC-based venture capital firm that invests in early-stage technology companies globally.\n\nDot Capitalâs founder and managing partner Joe Saviano, father of Brett Saviano â17, launched the firm in 2012 after previously serving as a partner at Baker Capital, a private equity firm that backed companies such as Akamai, which helped develop the first forms of global Internet and networking infrastructure that evolved into what powers the digital economy we live in today. Joe attended Lehigh University and is a Kappa Sigma, which is why he supports the persistence of a strong brotherhood like we have at Gamma Theta at Cornell.\n\nDot Capital primarily focuses on early-stage investments in technology startups with business models focused on software-as-a-service, digital media, computing infrastructure and Internet of Things at the seed or Series A stage. That typically means we are amongst their first investors that arenât friends or family and have invested an average of $1 million per company across 17 companies to date. IMGN Media, which manages some of the most popular meme brand channels on Instagram and Snap was just acquired by Warner Music Group for just under $100 million after receiving investment from Dot in 2018, bringing us to eight total exits. We specifically seek companies whose business models show a realistic path to profitable unit economics in 18-24 months (or before they need more financing) so that they donât need to raise another round of financing just to stay afloat, but can raise more capital to accelerate their growth from an already somewhat solid foundation.\n\nMax and I met Joe after graduating and began introducing him to friends that launched their own promising technology startups that fit Dot Capitalâs investment profile. As Joe came to know us better and realized significant returns from prior investments that suggested Dot was ready to move up in weight class, Max and I formally joined part-time to help Joe grow the firm with the intent of eventually joining full-time.\n\nWhile our fund is small, Dot typically tries to lead investment rounds. This is important because we are able to negotiate the valuation and other terms of investment such as taking board seats. Our most recent investment, Blue Wire, a sports podcasting network that produces and distributes high quality original and hyperlocal sports-themed podcasts, exemplifies this strategy. We led their $1.2 million seed financing round, which helped bring in strategic investors such as Atlanta Falcons linebacker Deion Jones (through his investment firm Forty5 Ventures) and retired NBA star Baron Davis. Baron will launch his own podcasting company, Slic, on Blue Wireâs network and also help recruit other athletes to join.\n\nSince joining, weâve also led investments in Hanzo - a Brazilian company that offers a white -labeled digital payments and loyalty platform. Hanzoâs software allows any organization to recreate the Starbucks app experience for a brand driving mobile consumption and repurchase without any engineers. Their clients consist of big companies such as Mastercard, Unilever, and McDonaldâs (their ice cream machines in Brazil work!) as well as some smaller startups. With the emergence of COVID-19, they doubled down on supporting contactless deliveries after learning a lot from their work with Petz - the biggest pet retailer in Brazil. Hanzo built Petz a mobile app using their e-commerce suite and mobile orders now represent a third of their sales after one year!\n\nWorking with Dot Capital has been especially rewarding for Max and I as a âhands-on-MBAâ of sorts since we get to work directly with leaders of high growth companies to solve real problems all over the world and learn a lot about their unique business and technology along the way. Every once in a while, we get to meet especially interesting entrepreneurs such as Tosca Musk, who launched her romance-focused streaming service after receiving a small investment from her brothers Elon and Kimbal, as well as Dot Capital. Joe has also provided hilarious uncensored feedback and mentorship, which certainly reminds us of Brettâs own ability to sniff out BS!\n\nWeâre always looking for ways to work with and support brothers. I had lost my home to foreclosure in the fall of 2016, but am now back on my feet and doing things I like and I owe it all to the support I received from my brothers over the last few years. Through working with Dot, Max and I have developed extensive networks in startup communities and are able to help refer brothers who might have been impacted by recent layoffs (or anyone looking to get rid of their boss) to high-growth technology companies. Weâre happy to begin returning some of the favors that have helped us in our early careers. Please feel free to reach out.\n\nCatch up with Alex at ank43@cornell.edu and Max at myt22@cornell.edu.\n\nRemembering Tom Paddrik â77\n\nSigma Nu lost a brother to COVID-19 on May 26, 2020, when Tom Paddrik passed away in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Tom was born on May 5, 1955, and was one of the âJamestown 5,â five high school friends from Jamestown, New York, who all went to Cornellâs engineering school as freshmen members of the class of â77, and they all joined Sigma Nu and stayed in close touch after graduation.\n\nGamma Theta extends condolences to the entire Paddrik family. Memories of Tom are shared here by one of the brothers who knew him best, Rich Shaffer â77 (rshaffer03@gmail.com).\n\nâTom was my best friend in high school. We were in Jamestown Highâs G & T Program, so we were in mostly the same classes for three straight years. Even then, Tom was an organizer. And, sometimes, an instigator. He had a lot of interests, including ham radio and debating. And, he always aimed high. He organized our debate teamâs âsummer schoolâ at Georgetown University. He developed a ham radio relationship with Saddam Hussein. A high school kid!\n\nâTom graduated Jamestown High in 1973. We both enrolled in Cornellâs Engineering School. So did three of our classmates. All five of us were Cornell Engineering! We were all pretty close in high school, and got closer at Cornell. Tom and I roomed together freshman year. When it came time that fall to rush fraternities, Tom came up with a radical planâwe would rush the houses together. Weâd attend dinners and smokers together. Houses gradually came to understand that we might all join the same one. Thus, the âJamestown 5â was born. And, Tom was our leader. When we came back early in January â74 to be interviewed (rushed) by the houses, it was Tom who suggested we do it together. Two brothers would show up to see Tom, and they would have all five of us to deal with. The rooms got plenty smoky, but the brothers of Sigma Nu took it all in stride.\n\nâTom was interested in sports carsâJaguars, Ferraris, and Austin Healys to name a few. He would help organize the brothersâ trips to the Grand Prix races at Watkins Glen. Again, Tom aimed high.\n\nâSo it was with women. He met his wife, Viviana, when she was a visiting student from Argentina. She hit him like a thunderbolt when they first met. They married very shortly after her graduation, and stayed that way until Tomâs passing earlier this year. We will all miss him.â\n\nReunion Year Alumni Profiles\n\nRob \"RT\" Williams â79\n\nMajor: Mechanical Engineering\n\nHometown (during college): Edison, NJ\n\nCurrent town and State: Wayne, PA\n\nEmployer: Boeing (retired 2018 after 29 years), Fox School of Business, Temple University, 5 years\n\nJob Title: Program Manager at Boeing, Adjunct Professor at Temple\n\nJob Responsibilities: Boeing, international marketing, R&D, new product development; innovation; Temple Fox: teaching innovation management to MBAs.\n\nMost Interesting Aspect of Your Job: Travel and work with partners in many countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Current job title is Deputy Chief of Congressional Affairs, Office of Corporate Communication at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)\n\nCurrent Job Responsibilities: Just started here this spring, so I'm still getting my feet wet at NGA. My division is responsible for supporting all NGA interactions with Congress, including hearings, briefings and responses to requests for information. We track legislation and congressional activities of interest to NGA, and we are the liaison/touch point with a number of other federal agencies.\n\nMost Interesting Aspect of Your Job: TBD since I just started here, but working with Congress is a completely different type of staff work than I'm used to. After flying helicopters for the majority of my career, I'm finding that each new staff job (non-flying) is a completely new experience. I was working Navy manpower issues on OPNAV Staff in Arlington, VA, for the last three years, and I was at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency as a part of the Joint Staff for the three years before that. All great jobs...but yes, I miss flying helicopters...every day...seriously.\n\nHobbies/Personal Interests: Travel, biking, skiing, golf, boating, long/late sessions by the fire pit, all Boston/New England sports teams, and our dog, Finley. Completely consumed with kidsâ sports (Jackâ11, Alexâ8) from season to season, but can't get enough of watching them grow and get better each year.\n\nOne Thing You Miss Most about Cornell or Sigma Nu: The brothers, of course. Still keep touch with a number of folks from the '95-'97 classes (Greg Fairbank '96, Joe Adiletta '96, Adam Hills '97, Lou Giampa '97, and Tom Van Buren '95, to name a few), as well as my little/big/big-big brothers from time to time (Jules Sherwood '99, Mike Boorstein '94, and Nate Moyer '93).

I joined as employee number 14 (we are now at 20) this past fall and am immediately focused on raising our Series A round, and also help with almost everything else ranging from hiring to technology partnerships.

We provide companion care, personal care, and support services for the aging population and disabled adults so they can stay safe, healthy and comfortable in their homes.\n\nMost Interesting Aspect of Your Job: First off, we get the opportunity to support some of the most vulnerable people in our communities by allowing them to age in place where they most often want: in their homes. Helping seniors and disabled adults is incredibly rewarding. Second, I love being my own boss. Having spent almost 20 years in the corporate world, it has been refreshing to chart my own course. There are no politics or bureaucracy, and there are very few roadblocks to decision-making and execution of change. And, you canât beat the flexibility.\n\nHobbies/Personal Interests: Travel, anything at the beach, whiskey and beer (some things never change), Steelers and Penn State.

That class was one of the biggest of its time, graduating 27 brothers. They've gone on to do many things â from a naval aviator to an assistant U.S. attorney to managing investments at a hedge fund, and much more.\n\nAlumni Profile: Back to School for Herb Riband '84\n\nWhat was your major at Cornell and how did it prepare you for your career?\n\nI double-majored in history and Spanish, but also took many economics courses in both the arts and ag schools. All of these, plus law school, helped prepare me for international careers in law and business, working in the U.S., Spain, England, and Switzerland. But it goes without saying that the most practical courses I took at Cornell were wines & spirits and human sexuality.\n\nYouâve worked most of your professional life as an attorney and in healthcare market access and policy, and for the last 20 years you have been living in Switzerland working in the life sciences industry. Tell us about your recent work in Switzerland.\n\nIn Switzerland I worked for Amgen, the California-based biotechnology leader, and before that Medtronic, the Minnesota-based medical technology leader. My last position at Amgen was vice president international policy & government affairs, leading the companyâs work in these areas outside of the United States. Before that, I was vice president value access & policy, leading Amgenâs European market access, pricing, health economics and healthcare policy activities, supporting the launch of five new medicines, as well as the companyâs portfolio of existing medicines. A highlight for me was co-leading the launch of Amgenâs âValue Based Health Careâ program in Europe, which developed innovative âbeyond the drugâ healthcare solutions and promoted healthcare policies focused on measuring and improving patient health outcomes.\n\nRight now, you are at Stanford doing a one-year fellowship. Whatâs it like to go back to school mid-career and what will you take away from this fellowship program?\n\nAfter working for 31 years, my wife, Jeanine Thomas Riband â84, and I decided to go âback to school.â In September 2018, we embarked on a one-year DCI fellowship at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, as part of a relatively new program to help mid/late-career people assess how they want to make unique and positive contributions for the rest of their lives. The primary focus of my fellowship is on developing new approaches and technologies to enable innovative global health and healthcare delivery models. I am hoping to generate insights, identify new solutions, and make contacts that bring together innovation projects at Stanford and in Silicon Valley with health system thought leaders from around the world. But I am also having a great time taking many other types of courses, plus giving lectures and mentoring students.\n\nWhere will you go after the fellowship ends?\n\nJeanine and I plan to return to our home in Lausanne, Switzerland, with frequent trips to the U.S. to visit our two children and extended families. I expect I will continue to travel around the world for both work and pleasure.\n\nWhat advice do you have for undergraduates interested in a career in law and/or healthcare?\n\nI highly recommend both, provided you find the right employers who help you develop your skills and share your values. Working as a lawyer in law firms and corporations helped me to develop strong analytical and advocacy skills and taught me how to operate at the intersection of law, ethics, and business. I have very much enjoyed working in healthcare: in addition to learning a complex, highly-regulated, technology-intensive business, I have had the satisfaction of knowing that the work my team and I did every day helped patients somewhere in the world get access to a treatment that saved or dramatically improved their lives.\n\nHow did your time at Sigma Nu prepare you for life after Cornell professionally and personally?\n\nI was fortunate to live with a great bunch of guys, and serve as social chairman (with my roommate Mark Vanacore â84) and then as commander. Particularly in the latter role, I learned a great deal about leadership, management, motivation, talent recruitment, and financial responsibility. The learnings came from both accomplishments and mistakes. But they have served me well.\n\nWhat is your favorite memory of living at 230 Willard Way?\n\nToo many to list: serving on an elite âVarmint Congâ unit that took apart Collegetown during the Phi Psi 500 (all for charity of course), some amazing social events (prohibition party, Bahamas party, spring break in Fort Lauderdale, spring party weekend, etc.) and, of course, working together as a brotherhood to win the fraternity all sports trophy my senior year.\n\nLife at Sigma Nu has changed over the years. For instance, the âtube roomâ name is lost on younger brothers who typically watch TV in the dormer. Whatâs one aspect of your time at Sigma Nu that you want todayâs students to know about?\n\nI felt like we were able to maintain a âsense of balanceâ that included social activities, sports, academics, and volunteer activities (Big Brother program, looking after the elderly neighbor across the street, etc.). We had a group of great people who (mostly) worked hard at school, excelled at sports and other activities, and generally had a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nGreek intramurals and the pursuit of the all sports trophy was a âbig thingâ at Sigma Nu while you were in school. Which team was the best Sigma Nu ever fieldedâname the sport and year.\n\nI am, of course, biased, but the 1983-â84 Sigma Nu Snakes ice hockey team was the best team I played on at Cornell. Winning the fraternity ice hockey championship was a Cornell highlight for me, especially after we beat the pretty boys from Phi Delt and the jocks from DUâwhich fielded three to four varsity and junior varsity hockey players in a pathetic attempt to try and stop us. We still beat the b**t**ds!\n\nHow do you stay in touch with Sigma Nu and Cornell?\n\nReading the Sigma News and staying in contact with some of my other brothers.\n\nInterested brothers can connect with Herb and Jeanine at hfriband@gmail.com.\n\nAlumni Profile: Meet John Kowalchik '84, A Foodie for Life\n\nWhat was your major at Cornell and how did it prepare you for your career?\n\nI started out as a pre-med biology major. However, my role as a student manager at Cornell Dining and Catering made me realize my real passion was food service. I desperately wanted to become a hotelie, but the implication of having to start school over again was a non-starter. So I switched my major to food science, remaining in the ag school. As a full time student, I continued to work 40 to 50 hours a week as student coordinator of Cornell Dining throughout my junior and senior years. I truly credit the leadership experience gained as a student manager as the foundation of my career in food industry management.\n\nYouâve worked most of your professional life in food manufacturing. Tell us about your current work as president and CEO of Baxters North America.\n\nI joined Cincinnati-based Wornick Foods in 2001 to build a commercial business for a company with a proud history of making field feeding rations (MREs) for our nationâs warfighters. We successfully grew the business through contract manufacturing shelf stable foods for some of the worldâs most iconic food brands. After several cycles of private equity ownership, the business was acquired by the Baxter Food Group in 2014. I was named CEO at that time. Baxters is a 150 year old, privately held global food company headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland. Baxters is best known in the UK for its premium Baxters soup products. I run the North American business for Baxters, inclusive of Wornick Foods. We have four plants and over 750 employees. We have built a tremendous business focused on serving soldiers, babies, and people in crisis.\n\nWhatâs your favorite Baxters product?\n\nMy favorite product is the Meal-Ready-Eat (MRE) that we have been making for the U.S. government since its inception 40 years ago. The MRE replaced the K-ration and is the foundation of our militaryâs field feeding program. Anyone who has served as a U.S. warfighter readily recognizes the MRE as an integral part of their training and military experience. It is difficult to express the pride of leading an organization that is such an integral supplier to our nationâs military and the extraordinary men and women who serve our country.\n\nWhat advice do you have for undergraduates interested in a career in the food business?\n\nSome of brightest individuals that I have ever met surrounded me at Cornell. I honestly feel that most were a hell of lot smarter than me. I have learned that the food business, like any manufacturing-centric business, is a âpeopleâ business. Gaining leadership experience, whether serving as social chairman at the fraternity house or supervising a campus catering event, are valuable building blocks in learning how to effectively engage and motivate people. There is nothing more fulfilling than developing teams that routinely accomplish things together that they never thought possible. Those who thrive in leadership roles have demonstrated they can win the hearts and minds of the employees they serve. I have found that those pursuing a career in management are well rewarded by focusing on honing these âsoft skills.â\n\nHow did your time at Sigma Nu prepare you for life after Cornell professionally and personally?\n\nThe years that I spent at Sigma Nu (â81-â84) were the most formative and best of my life. My first date with Eleanor Donohue â85, my wife of 33 years, was at a Sigma Nu Bahamas party. Brothers Matt Wiant â84, Matt Kalaycio â84, and Mickey Harris â84 remain my closest friends. The opportunity to live in the house for three years (and summers) provided countless memories and relationships with an incredibly diverse and talented group of young men who favorably changed the direction of the house and all of those who were fortunate to have shared the experience.\n\nWhat is your favorite memory of living at 230 Willard Way?\n\nMy role with Cornell Dining and Catering provided broad access to university âassets.â They were certainly put to good use when the house put on the first annual âSpring Wing Ding,â where we served buffalo wings for charity for thousands of students on a sunny spring afternoon on the Arts Quad. Unfortunately, some brothers learned the hard way that eating cooked wings while simultaneously loading fryers with raw chicken can get you pretty sick. We are fortunate that no brothers died of salmonella.\n\nLife at Sigma Nu has changed over the years. For instance, in the â80s, almost everyone lived in doubles and triples, now undergraduates prefer singles. Whatâs one aspect of your time at Sigma Nu that you want todayâs students to know about?\n\nOur class was large (27, I think) and almost everyone lived in the house for three years. Since my roommate (Wiant) and I had the distinction of the lowest pledge numbers, we doubled up in the smallest room in the house (on the wing). Looking back, It is hard to believe we made the room work. But I never remember it feeling too small.\n\nYou have plans to be back at your 35th Reunion in June. If you could live one more day at Sigma Nu, what would that day look like?\n\nBreakfast in the dining roomâsharing the stories of the previous night. Drinking refreshments in the sun all afternoon on the house roof, Big Red hockey game, chapter room party followed by the Corner afterward. Then watching the sun rise on the roof with my best buds.\n\nHow do you stay in touch with Sigma Nu and Cornell?\n\nWiant, Kalaycio, Harris, and I have remained close over the years. We shared our 30th birthdays in Cabo, brought in the millenium (2000 New Years) with our families together in a mansion in Key West. Ski trips, weddings, bar mitzvahs too numerous to count. Harris, Wiant, and I even got to do a NYC-based internet start-up business together in 1999-2000. To my kids, they are âuncles.â To me, they are my best friends and always will be.\n\nBrothers can catch up with John at jmkowalchik@zoho.com.\n\nHard Work and Passion Drive Career Success for Sigma Nus\n\nEvery brother finds his own way forward after graduation, and those career paths can take interesting turns along the way. In this Sigma News, weâll look at the career paths of two members and close friends who graduated a dozen years agoâJohnny Hill â06 and Adam Sansiveri â05. One built a fast-growing taco business before moving into private equity, and the other was producing Broadway shows and is now in wealth management. Both share a common interest in giving back and helping others, and show how passion can drive career success.\n\nAlumni Profile: Meet Johnny Hill â06\n\nWhat was your major at Cornell and what were your career aspirations then?\n\nI was an economics major in the College of Arts & Sciences. When I first got to Cornell, I thought I wanted to go into politics, but sometime around my junior year, I knew I wanted to do something entrepreneurial and creative with my career.\n\nYou got your start in private equity working at L Catterton focused on food and beverage and hospitality companies. What were your responsibilities?\n\nMy responsibilities were split between evaluating and acquiring new companies and helping our portfolio companies optimize their business for scale. As my career at L Catterton progressed, I found myself gravitating toward the operations side of the business more than the acquisitions side.\n\nWhat was the inspiration for Tacombi and how did you transition into the role there as president?\n\nI wanted to initially leverage my private equity experience at L Catterton to start my own fast casual restaurant concept. However, never having been a true operator, I decided I would get some experience first. I was introduced to the founder of Tacombi, who had just brought this Volkswagen bus from Mexico to New York City to sell tacos out of and I thought, this sounds fun. I brought growth and financial expertise to the table, he brought a passion for brand building and Mexican culture, and together we were a pretty good combo and built something special.\n\nWe grew Tacombi from one location and 15 employees in 2011 to six locations and 200-plus employees in 2017, as well as launched Vista Hermosaâa line of all-natural Mexican food products including tortillas, chips, and salsasâwhich can be found in Whole Foods and other specialty grocers across the northeast.\n\nWhat was it like running an entrepreneurial taco business?\n\nWhen I was serving as the CFO at Tacombi, my Sigma Nu pledge brothers liked to joke that I was literally a bean counter at a Mexican restaurant. Running Tacombi was a ton of fun and incredibly challenging, but most importantly it showed me how impactful a business can be on its people, community, and environment. I think it also prepared me for having kids because a start-up is like a childâsometimes it needs to be nurtured, other times it needs to be pressured, but itâs always challenging and rewarding.\n\nYou left Tacombi in in an operational role earlier this year to found Lagniappe Capital Studio, a new type of private equity company. What does Lagniappe stand for and what was the genesis of this effort?\n\nA âlagniappeâ is traditional to Louisiana heritage (where I am originally from) and is an unexpected token of generosity or way of good measure. Our mission at Lagniappe Capital Studio is simple: to reshape the relationship between capital, communities, and companies to make change.\n\nThe genesis behind LCS was that the approach that I took at Tacombi could be applied to other brands that have a great story but lack the operational/financial infrastructure to scale up and pursue pro-social initiatives in order to create long term value. Our mandate at LCS is to invest in authentic, heritage-rich brands that want to grow their businesses AND create a lasting, positive impact on society by adhering to the highest standards of social and environmental accountability.\n\nOur pro-social approach is two-fold: 1.) âPlan B,â which is our commitment toward getting each one of a brandâs investments on track to becoming certified B-Corp, whose mission is to use business as a force for good (good examples are Patagonia, Ben & Jerryâs, and Warby Parker); and 2.) our âCommunity Carryâ initiative, which is our reinvestment approach whereby half of our carried interest at exit is reinvested back into the local communities our investments call home to causes that LCS and the management teams are mutually passionate about, delivering a win-win-win to the company, the community, and our investors. Thatâs the lagniappe!\n\nWhat types of businesses will Lagniappe be investing in?\n\nOur first investment was into a group of New York City cafes, The Grey Dog, which has been a New York favorite for over 22 years. We serve coffee, brunch, dinner, and drinks all day every day, bringing a little bit of upstate charm downtown.\n\nOur plan is to grow from four locations to 20 over the next five years and tighten up the brand and menu for scale, focusing on creating super simple and delicious food made from awesome, local ingredients. Despite being in business for 22 years, each of our locations still has lines out the door every weekend, so weâre pretty excited to share this with a larger audience.\n\nWe plan on investing in other verticals outside of hospitality once weâve raised our first committed fund, but our immediate focus is on making The Grey Dog as strong and impactful of a brand as it can be.\n\nWhere do you want Lagniappe to be five years from now?\n\nI want Lagniappe to be a pioneer in reshaping the way capital markets think about impact and show that financial returns and impact are not mutually exclusive. Hopefully, in five years we will have a fully committed fund and a team of folks who are equal parts entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and investors all rolled into one.\n\nHow did your time at 230 Willard Way prepare you for life after college?\n\nThe thing I probably learned most from my time at Sigma Nu was how to connect with people who come from all sorts of backgrounds with varying ideals, perspectives, and passions. As commander, I also learned how to run an undercapitalized organization there as well. :)\n\nWhat advice do you have for undergraduates interested in a career in food/beverage services or hospitality?\n\nPursue things that you are really passionate about. And donât be afraid to not make a lot of money.\n\nHow about a career in private equity?\n\nTry to find a firm that invests in industries that you are deeply interested in. And like everything else, it all comes down to people. Make sure you love the people you will be working with.\n\nWhat are your fondest memories of life at Sigma Nu?\n\nThatâs an impossible question. Some things that immediately come to mind are dinners and sharing laughs in the dormer. Nobody will ever laugh more or harder than they did during their time at Sigma Nu, particularly in the dormer.\n\nIf you could live in Sigma Nu for one day, what would you do that day?\n\nAssuming itâs a Saturday in football season, I would wake everyone up fairly early to start tailgating. Weâd go cheer on the Big Red, and then head back to the house for a little backyard barbeque and cornhole. Wrap up the night with an after hours. Sounds glorious.\n\nHow do you stay connected to Cornell and Sigma Nu?\n\nOur crew is still very tight from college and many have invested in LCS, which I am tremendously appreciative of. We get together occasionally as well, most notably for Double Duck dinners around the holidays. For the guys not in New York City, fantasy football serves a great way of staying in touch. A bunch of us recently took a weekend trip back to Ithaca and it was great to stop by the house and chat with the guys.\n\nBrothers who want to connect with Johnny can reach him at johnny.r.hill@gmail.com. You can find out more about Lagniappe at www.lagniappecap.org, and if you want a great brunch or tacos in NYC, check out The Grey Dog (www.thegreydog.com) or Tacombi (www.tacombi.com).\n\nAlumni Profile: Meet Adam Sansiveri â05\n\nCareer paths are rarely straightforward. How did yours unfold out of college?\n\nI moved to New York City with medical school in mind. I had wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon since I was three years old. That plan shifted quickly when I found success as a professional singer and actor. In under two years I performed in a number of major productions in and around New York. I performed at Carnegie Hall and the Verbier Festival in Switzerland, amongst many others. However, I realized it wasnât the lifestyle I wanted and that I wanted to create something myself. I decided to start a small business, which is how I got into design and technology. I partnered with a pal from the track team at Cornell and we launched a company called RNA Designs.\n\nHow did you add being a theater producer into the mix?\n\nWhile performing in New York, I became friends with a young theater producer. After I exited RNA Designs, I was looking for ways to create art and leverage my passion for business and creation. He taught me the ropes before I went on to co-produce my first show. At 24, I was the youngest above the title Broadway producer ever at the time. It was a thrilling experience to help create such impactful art that was touching millions of people. We went on to co-produce a number of shows together after that, and Iâve invested in over a dozen shows since then.\n\nWhat was the Broadway experience like?\n\nItâs a great business in so many ways. Every day youâre surrounded by some of the most talented people on the planet, and you get to help create the medium that allows them to showcase those talents. Itâs also a hard business. Seven out of 10 shows lose all their money, two break even, and one is a huge financial success. Picking the winners can sometimes feel like the lottery, but that is the art of being in the business of entertainment. I decided to go back to school and get my masterâs degree in media management and economics while I was producing, with the desire of doing more and continuing to learn.\n\nTell us about Broadway Dreams and your ongoing work with this nonprofit as chairman of the board to create opportunities in musical theater.\n\nBroadway Dreams is one of the most inspiring and prolific performing arts education foundations out there. Each year, we help dozens of students (about 63 in 2017) reach their dreams by being cast on Broadway or other major professional productions. I joined the board about eight years ago and have since sat as the finance chair and then as the chairman these past two years. As someone who understands the true value and impact that performing arts education has on a student, regardless of whether you are an aspiring professional or not, itâs been incredibly rewarding to help further the mission of the organization. Since joining the organization, Iâve seen it grow to over 10 U.S. cities and five other countries. We have some other really big things in the works that weâll be announcing in 2019.\n\nYou are currently a managing director at Bernstein Private Wealth Management and have spent eight years with Bernstein. What satisfies you most about this job?\n\nItâs an incredible company that is wholly unique in the money management world. I would never do this job anywhere else. I was drawn out of being an entrepreneur and into Bernstein because they knew how to shape my diverse array of passions and excitement for people into something greater. I was hired as one of the youngest advisors ever at the company and saw fast success building a practice focused around prominent musicians, athletes, entrepreneurs, and other inspiring individuals. In 2015, I became one of the youngest principals in the history of the firm, and this year became the youngest managing director. The most satisfying thing about my job is helping incredible people realize their missions of impact on the world while getting to bring all of my own passions into my job every day.\n\nIâm fortunate that Iâve had another Sigma Nu brother to mentor me along the way, Joel Stevens â90. He has worked for Bernstein for more than 20 years, is a good friend, and we get to work together in the New York office.\n\nHow has the role of a wealth manager changed since you started and where do you see things going in the next few years?\n\nThe investment world continues to become commoditized on the lower end of the wealth spectrum due to technology and price compression. However, the upper end of the spectrum continues to become more complex and advice continues to become ever more important. I see a continuation and acceleration of this trend and sophisticated firms like ours thriving along with it.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in five years, as clearly you are a motivated entrepreneur?\n\nThank you for the compliment. I always have my hands in different things, so I never know what will be on my plate a year from now. I see myself running or potentially creating an entire new office with Bernstein as the next step of my career, continuing to increase my support and involvement in start-ups and the arts, and focusing even more on philanthropy.\n\nAre there any common themes that tie together all your professional experiences?\n\nPassion. I learned early on while trying to pursue a career as an opera singer that it is far more scalable to bring your passions with you than it is to chase them. That realization is what has allowed me to do so many different things and do them well. My passions for giving back, helping others, content creation, performance, business, and disruption are the same things that allowed me to thrive as an entrepreneur and on Wall Street.\n\nHow do you manage working to be an expert and capable across many fields at the same time?\n\nI think this is more of an art than it is a science. It is partly driven by passion and the underlying skills that are translatable to many different things. Itâs also part being a good leader and knowing when to surround yourself with great people. Add in a lot of hard work and curiosity about the things you must be an expert on to succeed and you can surprise yourself how much can be accomplished in a day.\n\nHow did your time at 230 Willard Way prepare you for life after college?\n\nThere are friendships and bonds formed in that house that will never break. Being commander of Sigma Nu for my time gave me an early taste of what it was like to need to work to understand what is most important to other people. Then taking that knowledge and translating it to action is something I learned during my time at Willard Way that I use every day.\n\nWhat advice do you have for undergraduates interested in a career in wealth management?\n\nBe interesting and different. Do as much as you can and it will make you far more valuable in this industry and almost all others. I see hundreds of candidates with just basic finance backgrounds, but it is those who have far more complexity and intellectual curiosity that grab my attention. And of course, hard work pays off.\n\nHow about a career in theater?\n\nFind a mentor who can help guide you. Broadway is a very hard and competitive industry within which to reach the top. You need to be ready to work as hard as those graduates going into entry level finance jobs.\n\nWhat are your fondest memories of life at Sigma Nu?\n\nDinners with all our brothers. Also learning how to and how NOT to party.\n\nHow do you stay connected to Cornell and Sigma Nu?\n\nIâm on the alumni executive committee for the Cornell Track and Field team, so I stay involved this way. Beyond spending time with my best friends from Cornell and Sigma Nu, I try to hire a lot of Cornellians and visit the house every couple of years.\n\nBrothers who want to connect with Adam can reach him at Adam.Sansiveri@bernstein.com.

Senior safety Nick Gesualdi â18 was a first-team selection, and senior linebacker Kurt Frimel â18 was a second-team pick.\n\nKurt, who joined Nick as a defensive captain, led the Big Red and ranked fourth in the Ivy League in tackles for loss (9.5). He had 55 tackles, two sacks, two pass breakups and a forced fumble in nine games. The CoSIDA Academic All-District selection was a two-year starter and letter winner who compiled 148 tackles, 16.5 for a loss and 4.5 sacks, four forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and four pass breakups.\n\nNick is a repeat unanimous selection on the first team, becoming the first Cornell defensive player to be placed on the first team in consecutive years since 1992 and 1993. He ranked second on the team in tackles (60), leading the team in solo stops (42), and was third in the Ivy League with three interceptions (55th nationally). The team captain had an interception in the season finale at Penn, giving him 14 for his career, the most by a Big Red player in 68 years and second on the schoolâs all-time list.\n\nAdditionally, the Cornell football team placed three student athletes on CoSIDAâs (College Sports Information Directors of America) academic all-district team, and they are all Sigma Nus: Seniors Kurt Frimel â18, Jack Gellatly â18, and Seth Hope â18. A senior defensive end, Seth was named to the Academic All-America Division I Football first team. Hope becomes the fifth Big Red football player to twice be honored as a two-time Academic All-American after capturing second team honors in 2016. Hope is the eighth Cornellian to earn first-team honors and the first since Luke Siwula '07 (also a Sigma Nu!) in 2006. Gellatly is making his second straight appearance, while Frimel is being recognized for the first time. In all, 19 Ivy League football players reached the academic all-America ballot.\n\nWell done Nick, Kurt, Jack, and Seth and Go Big Red!\n\nSnakes Helping Snakes: My Summer Internship at S3 Partners\n\nBy Nate Porter â18\n\nThis past summer, I interned at a financial data-analytics firm in New York City called S3 Partners, located in midtown Manhattan. The company provides extensive short-side market research and data analytics to clients (primarily hedge funds) through numerous platforms, including a financial software application that provides real-time short-interest data via a Bloomberg terminal. During my time at S3, I worked closely with Head of Research Ihor Dusaniwsky â84, providing extensive short-side research using S3âs data-analytics software and the Bloomberg terminal.\n\nTogether we regularly tracked and provided research on the most- and least-profitable shorts in international and domestic stocks, ETFs, sectors, and indices. Some of our work was cited by The Wall St. Journal, The New York Times, Bloomberg, Business Insider, and Investopedia, among others. I also worked with other members of the firm in analyzing borrowing and lending activity to help create Excel templates, showing profitable opportunities for securities lending in a clientâs portfolio. Proprietary software generated a âtrue market rateâ for borrowing securities, which could also be measured against the borrowing rate charged by a clientâs prime broker.\n\nI can safely say I learned more about the Street during my first week working at S3 than I had during all my years at Cornell. Getting to use a Bloomberg terminal was an incredible asset; the people at the company were professional, yet fun to work with, and Ihor was a fantastic mentor, who was patient in teaching me the nuances of the company and never hesitated to answer my numerous questions concerning the market. Even though he was a Sigma Nu over 30 years before me, I still felt a level of camaraderie with him during my time there. I remember the first day of work; one of the first questions he asked me was whether or not we still did the same initiation traditions. The internship and living in the city made for an incredible summer, and after graduation, I hope to find a satisfying career there, but I will never forget this past summer, when I got my foot in the door.\n\nI want readers to know that I was fortunate to land the internship after networking with a number of Cornell Sigma Nu alumni with substantial experience in the financial services industry, most of whom were eager to provide me with guidance and advice during my internship search, despite having never met me. Just a few weeks after leveraging our network this past spring, I received a call from Ihor, who asked me if I would be interested in interviewing for a position at S3.\n\nâWhen I heard that some of the active brothers were looking for internships and we had an opening this summer, I contacted Nate and, after speaking to him, offered him the position,â said Ihor. âNateâs resume showed me he had the skill sets I needed for the role, but more importantly, as a Sigma Nu brother, I knew he was the kind of person that I could trust and feel comfortable working with. I knew, as a brother, he would impress me with his drive and work ethic, and he exceeded my high expectations.â\n\nâOur firm enjoyed a summer with a productive and friendly intern, and I enjoyed the fact that I was able to give a little back to an institution that was a big part of my young adult life, â continued Ihor. âIf any of our established brothers have a chance to reach out and help one of our active Gamma Theta student brothers, I urge you to do so. You wonât be disappointed. Your success can be a stepping stone to their future success! After all, this is the Life, the Way, and the Light of Sigma Nu.â\n\nThe whole experience was truly an inspiring one for me; a network of people I had never met before were willing to take time out of their busy schedules to chat with me and provide valuable career advice. It goes to show what the brotherhood is all about and how our values and traditions as brothers of Sigma Nu carry on with us throughout our lives. I hope that one day I can return the favor.\n\nInterested brothers can connect with Nate at nateporter1465@gmail.com and Ihor at ihor.dusaniwsky@s3partners.net.\n\nMeet Cindy Smith, Sigma Nuâs Top Chef\n\nSigma Nu has been fortunate to have its share of great cooks over the years, but our current cook likely tops them all.\n\nCindy Smith has been in our kitchen for the last seven years, and she helps make meal time at Sigma Nu extra special. The brothers know they are always going to get an excellent meal, and the quality of the food entices virtually all the live-outs to come to the house for dinner. This brings our brothers closer together than other houses, because they spend time as a chapter almost daily. Also, Cindyâs delicious cooking gives Sigma Nu a real advantage during rush, as potential new brothers get a taste–literally–of living at Sigma Nu and discover we have the best food on the Hill.\n\nSigma News: When did you first come to Sigma Nu?\n\nCindy: I came to Sigma Nu about seven years ago, when Dan Galusha â72 hired me along with then Commander Caleb Crim â13. I remember feeling very much at home when I first came. The guys were all very friendly and excited to have me in their house.\n\nSigma News: What do you enjoy most about the job?\n\nCindy: Well, I must say my job is very rewarding. The brothers are so appreciative of everything I do for them.\n\nSigma News: What is the favorite dish the brothers like you to make for them?\n\nCindy: Iâm going to say sweet-and-sour chicken. They really love it, so I love to make it for them.\n\nSigma News: What dish do you most like to make for the brothers?\n\nCindy: I answered this one, but as a joke we can say stir fry. We kind of have a laugh when stir fry is on the menu. Some of the guys are not sure they care for it (LOL!), but itâs a given and saves money so we can have steak on occasion.\n\nSigma News: Are the brothers healthy eaters?\n\nCindy: Actually, the guys eat all the veggies I make, so you can let the moms know their boys are, for the most part, making healthy choices.\n\nSigma News: You have a great reputation for making fantastic food. What sets you apart from the other cooks on campus?\n\nCindy: I think what sets us apart from some of the other houses is that I try to make the guys feel like they can ask me anything, and I do my very best to help them or to cook them what they like. Itâs as close to home as we can get, and I love all of them!\n\nSigma News: How many brothers are you cooking for daily?\n\nCindy: During breakfast, I usually see as many as 10 to 20 of the guys. This semester, lunch is always busy, because most of them come for that meal. Dinner is buffet style; I cook for 60, and most of the time there are no leftovers.\n\nSigma News: What is a typical day like in the Sigma Nu kitchen?\n\nCindy: I can start breakfast by 8:30 a.m. for the early guys. For lunch, I usually have them coming any time after 11:30 a.m. If I have everything ready, we are good to go, and dinner tends to be at 6:00 p.m. I also try to have things ready for the guys I know will need to eat early or late. Thatâs what sets us apart from the rest. The guys will text me for early meals or late ones. Some will get a wrap or a sandwich at breakfast to take with them if they canât make it back to the house for lunch.\n\nSigma News: Who sets the menu?\n\nCindy: I do the menu, but I always check with the guys for their input. Just the other day, I lacked a lunch idea, so I asked them for suggestions, and they decided on turkey club sandwiches. We work together.\n\nSigma News: Is there anything the brotherhood can do to help make your job easier or to improve our kitchen?\n\nCindy: I do think, because we will always do buffet style meals, that a hot steam table would be an awesome addition.\n\nSigma News: Last question: are the brothers still doing kitchen raids?\n\nCindy: We have been most lucky to have a new sandwich cart in the pantry area. It does help to keep down traffic in the kitchen, but (LOL!) does not stop those pesky midnight kitchen raids.\n\nBrothers interested in connecting with Cindy can e-mail her at cinsm3456@yahoo.com. If you are ever in Ithaca, stop by the house at dinner time to say hi to Cindy, and enjoy a delicious meal.\n\nWelcome to the Village: Sigma Nu Alumnus Working to Reshape Primary Health Care at VillageMD\n\nThe healthcare system in the United States is in the headlines almost daily. Many Sigma Nu brothers today work in healthcare across a broad range of job roles, including physicians, administrators, medical-device manufacturers, and pharmaceutical sales reps.\n\nTim Barry â93 is the founder and CEO of VillageMD, a Chicago-based company that is innovating primary care. VillageMD is a leading national provider of primary-care management services for healthcare organizations moving toward a primary-care-led, high-value clinical model.\n\nWhat marketplace problem is VillageMD working to solve?\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is horribly broken. We currently spend about $3 trillion per year (2.5 times that of other industrialized nations) on healthcare with quality of care outcomes that are slightly better than Slovenia (not a joke).\n\nAt the core of our healthcare quality and cost problems are two phenomena: (1) a fee-for-service healthcare reimbursement model that pays providers more to do more services (e.g., more hospitalizations equals more revenue for a hospital), and (2) a lack of support for primary-care providers to take care of the 20 percent of our population with chronic and debilitating illnesses that incur 80 percent of the total medical spending.\n\nWhat was the genesis of VillageMD?\n\nAfter years of running medical groups and health-insurance companies, my co-founders and I built a healthcare model that redefines the way primary care works. We embed sophisticated analytics, technology, and a slew of people into primary-care practices to help create better outcomes for all of our patients. Most importantly, we do this in a way that doctors and patients love, because doctors can now meet all of the needs of their sickest patients, while simultaneously improving the health of their overall population of patients.\n\nWe have now brought this model to a network of over 600 primary care practices around the country and manage about $1.5 billion of total medical spend.\n\nHealthcare is in the news literally every day for many reasons. From your perspective, what are the biggest challenges in healthcare today for the average consumer/patient, and can VillageMD help them?\n\nFor those of us who are incredibly fortunate to maintain good health, we should consider ourselves lucky that we do not need to navigate this confusing healthcare system.\n\nFor those struggling with chronic disease or some other form of illness (the 20 percent that incur 80 percent of the total spending), our f"
