        "text": "There were talks of the gold medal match being reverted to the longer format that was stopped at Rio de Janeiro 2016, but insidethegames understands that it will remain as a best-of-three match.\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 final was played in a shortened format and saw Germany's Alexander Zverev prevail as he beat Karen Khachanov of the Russian Olympic Committee 6-3, 6-1 at the Ariake Coliseum.\n\nIt was the first time since Los Angeles 1984, when tennis was a demonstration event, that a best-of-three men's singles final took place.\n\nIt was done to help players who were competing in the later stages in singles, doubles, and mixed tournaments.\n\nBoth of the men's and women's singles tournaments and the three doubles competitions are due to take place at the Stade Roland Garros in the French capital.\n\nIt is the first time that the Olympic tennis tournament will be played on clay since Barcelona 1992 at the Tennis de la Vall d'Hebron, which saw Switzerland's Marc Rosset and American Jennifer Capriati prevail in the singles events.\n\nAs a result, a more diverse group of players have been tipped to do well.\n\nOne of those is Beijing 2008 singles gold medallist Rafael Nadal of Spain.\n\nNadal, who will be 38 at the time of the upcoming Summer Games, has a record 22 men's singles Grand Slam titles and also won in the men's doubles with Marc LÃ³pez at Rio 2016.\n\nSpanish Olympic Committee President Alejandro Blanco has predicted him to triumph at Paris 2024 if he chooses to continue playing that long.\n\n\"I agree, you have to take Rafael Nadal to the Paris 2024 Games no matter what,\" Blanco told El Partidazo de Cope.\n\n\"If he goes, he will be an Olympic champion for sure.\"\n\nNadal has won the French Open, held at Roland Garros, a record 14 times and has just three defeats to his name in 18 appearances at the tournament."
