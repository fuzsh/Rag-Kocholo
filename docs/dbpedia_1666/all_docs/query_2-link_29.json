        "text": "Great results for Brits in France\n\nUEM Final - Riom es Montagnes France\n\n16/17/18th September\n\nThe final round of the UEM European Enduro Championship is taking place this weekend in the small town of Riom es Montagnes near Clermont Ferrand in central France. The three day event kicked off on Thursday night with a parade through the town. The warm evening was officially described as \"gorgeous\" by Greg Evan's mum Kay.\n\nOn Friday morning the racing started in earnest. Overnight rain had softened the air but the early autumn sun shone. KORRacing's Greg Evans took the lead in the E2 Senior class. Greg is riding with a plated shoulder. Danny McCanney on the GasGas led the E2/3 Juniors from Greg's team mate Jonny Walker. Danny started the final round 3rd in the overall standings with 74 pts behind Paulo Felicia 82pts and Maurizio Micheluz 77pts. Guido Comforti led the E1 Juniors with MPS Racing's Jack Rowland in 3rd. Fellow MPS rider Jordan Rose was 5th in the Senior E3 class.\n\nAfter a second night of light showers, the Saturday morning weather was bright. Greg Evans had a slower start than on Day 1 with a 6th place on his 3rd test but he moved up into 3rd while Michael Szuster and Jonathan Rosse battled for the lead. Greg set the fastest times on T5 and T6 to move into 2nd behind Michael Szuster by a 4 second deficit. Tim Forman put in consistent times in 12th. Jordan Rose was also putting in some good times and he had moved up to second place after 3 tests behind Maurizio Micheluz. Paulo Felicia led the E1 Seniors from Alessio Paoli. Danny McCanney again led the Juniors from Jonny Walker - opening up a 9 second gap on the first testof the day but on test 3 Jonny put in the fastest time and pulled 5 seconds back. Rheinalt Davies and Lewis Belfield were riding together in 10th and 11th. In the E1 Juniors Milan Engel established a 10 second lead over Luis Oliviera after 4 tests. Jack Rowland was 5th. Alun Jones was 12th. In a dramatic end to the day Greg Evans took the last test and the win by a third of a second. Jordan Rose set the fastest test times on the last 6 tests to win the Senior E3. Danny McCanney won the E2/3 Juniors and Jonny Walker was the runner up.\n\nRiders (left to Right) Tim Forman, Jonny Walker, Alun Jones, Jordan Rose, Greg Evans, Lewis Belfield, Rheinalt Davies, Jack Rowlands and Danny McCanney.\n\nLewis Belfield\n\nJunior Cup\n\nAnother successful weekend for KORR riders in the last race of the 2011 European Enduro Championship held at Riom es Montagnes, France, the final would be 3 days of Enduro completed with a final MX race.\n\nGreg Evans Azego KTM 350 XCF:- the defending E2 Senior Champion who recently broke his collarbone at the 6 Days returned to top form and had 3 excellent days in France, Battling with Michael Szuster of Poland, Special Greg won both the first two days and went into the final day's MX race with a good advantage in the points table. So to complete a hat trick Greg made a holeshot in the final MX and lead from start to finish to yet again win the E2 European Senior crown.\n\nJonny Walker Azego KTM 300 EXC:- riding his practice bike as his race bike is being prepared for this weeks BEC final Jonny had a great weekend in France, Saturday's result was tainted by a mistake on one special test which cost him 40 seconds, however he finished 2nd in the Junior E2/E3 class both days. And just like his team mate the former trials rider showed his MX potential by easily winning his groups final race, Jonny finished runner up in the championship to fellow UK rider Danny McCanny.\n\nJulian Stevens Team Manager:-  I'm really pleased for both Greg and Jonny, Gregs bounced back well from his recent injury and rode very consistently during the 3 days despite pressure from rivals to take the championship again. Jonny also made an impressive result on all 3 days finishing on the podium in his class and also high up in the overall, once again thanks to all that help the KORR riders and our sponsors. This weekend we go to the final round of the British Enduro Championship, Greg has a small overall lead and lets hope he can win his first British Title to go with his Europeans. Jonny is in a close Battle for the E3 title with his European rival Danny McCanny and Daryl Bolter KTM 250 XCF\n\nMcCANNEY WINS EUROPEAN ENDURO CHAMPIONSHIP!\n\nGas Gas' Danny McCanney has won the 2011 European Junior E2/3 Enduro Championship. After completing the tough three-day final in France this weekend McCanney won his class and took second overall for the concluding event of the championship. This in his first year in international competition.\n\nDanny McCanney: I'm delighted. As usual for me it was a combination of setting fast times and then taking the odd crash, but overall the weekend went well, I finished top Brit and took the title we set out to win. To come so high in the overall classification as well was a bonus. I was third in the overall championship standings before the weekend but we still don't know yet if I did enough to step up to being vice-champion. Either way, second or third, I'm happy enough. It was another great event, lots of natural terrain tests over a mix of soil and rock. I even won an extreme test this weekend, which has been a weakness of mine, so I'm happy to have made progress there. As ever my Gas Gas CC300 was spot on. It didn't miss a beat, it's a great bike.\"\n\nSteve Plain, Gas Gas team manager : Brilliant! I can't stress enough what a great season this has been. We set goals  championships to win  and we attain them. Danny continues to improve with every ride and his performance in the extreme test showed he works on his weaknesses too. \"To come away as top Brit is excellent, as with Greg Evans winning the European Senior E2 title and Jonny Walker (4th E2 in the ISDE)  just to mention two  there's a lot of quality there. \"It's a great lead-in to the final round of the British Enduro Championship this coming weekend. Danny's leading the E3 and Junior ranks in the BEC so we're hoping for a top outcome there as well. The week after that Danny's entered to ride the final round of the world championship. That will be his debut ride in the premier enduro championship in the world. It's a brilliant way to finish the season.\n\nDouble podium finish for Greg Evans in Poland European Enduro Championship, Poland 26/27th June 2010.\n\n11 Brits made it over to Poland for the second round of the European Championships on the 26/27th June 2010. Heavy rain on Thursday, was not really needed to reminded the boys that they were missing out on The Welsh 2 Day, as the free internet in the hotel foyer was permanently logged on to www.enduronews.com\n\nFriday was a better day and all of the usual formalities went without a hitch. Some last minute test walking was followed by dinner in the Grill Bar and an early night.\n\nA 10.00am start was thought a bit late by most riders, but they were thankful for the 4th lap being cut or that would have meant a 7pm finish. Only 2 tests, 1 cross and 1 enduro, but 2 huge hill climbs on the going kept it interesting, not to mention the very low tunnel on the ride out of the paddock which saw many riders with scratched helmets and some even getting off and walking the bikes through. The timing failed on the First cross test, so they had to scrap that one, which left just 5 tests for day 1. There were no major incidents for the Brits, all finished clean with some good results and test times being scored.\n\nThe problem for all visitors seemed to be the locals around the going. Some of the boys had to learn quickly, not to trust any of them as they were sending them in all the bogs, wrong lines, covering lines with sticks and trees and even lit fires at one point. Our boys were coming to checks with allsorts of stories, every lap, which kept the pit crew very amused.\n\nSunday was a 9 am start and another 3 laps of the same. We suffered a casualty on the first lap when Neil Chatham had a fall in the Cross test and suffered a broken wrist and fracture to his right arm. Then towards the end of the first lap Aaron Poolman retired with mechanical problems. Otherwise all was well, with the other 9 riders, all again finishing on time.\n\nThe Brits went one better this time and had 2 riders on the podium, Greg Evans was 1st in E2 senior class and 3rd overall, Ollie Moyce was 3rd in the Junior class (right).\n\nCongratulations to all The British Riders, and best wished to Neil for a speedy recovery.\n\nOur next adventure will be to Val de Nizza, Italy on the 16/17th July.\n\nPodium Finish for Ollie Moyce\n\nMidwest Husaberg UK Race Team Report\n\nAll 4 Midwest Husaberg UK team riders Ollie Moyce, Jamie Paget, Tyson Maytom-Jones and Arran Poolman, set off for the long drive to Poland early Tuesday morning leaving the UK in record temperatures only to arrive in Poland to be met with heavy rain. This would suit the UK riders as they are used to riding in wet conditions but for the weekend the rain stopped and the course was in good condition. The course was to be 4 laps per day and featured only 2 tests per lap, one cross and one enduro but the first test on Saturday was scrapped as the timing system failed. A late start of 10am also meant that the last lap was cancelled so only 3 laps were completed by all competitors on day 1. All Midwest Husaberg UK team riders put in good test times and all finished the first day with no problems with Ollie Moyce finishing 3rd in class followed by Jamie Paget 11th, Tyson Maytom-Jones 12th and Arran Poolman 8th.\n\nSunday was to be 3 laps again but an earlier start of 9am was planned which suited all the riders. Again all Midwest Husaberg UK team riders rode well on day 2 with only Arran Poolman loosing coolant from his radiator forcing him to retire. Ollie Moyce made it another 3rd in class and made it to the podium for his best result ever followed home by an improving Jamie Paget in 9th and Tyson Maytom-Jones 16th. This was a very good result by all team riders and puts them in strong positions for the next round in Italy on 16/17th July.\n\nFirst podium for Michel Szuster - Italy wins Nations Trophy\n\nFinal round - Day 1\n\nSeven hours of race for this dirst day of the final round of European Championship at Castiglion Fiorentino. 126 ther riders at the start; only 5 don't finish the race. Good result for the italians D'Ambrosio, Beconi e Pellegrinelli who win theier own classes .\n\nStart with fog and clouds this morning, at nine o'clock, from Piazza Garibaldi, for the seventh and last race of the european championship 2009. The sun - shines on the sky only later - became the protagonist of the day with a terrible dust and the temperature too to remember this summer. The hot weather has been a little problem for the riders, especially in the cross test - very techincal - more difficult for the dust. Very good job of the \"Castiglion Fiorentino - Fabrizio Meoni\" Moto Club that controlled without problems all the situations and every moment of the race. 126 the riders came in Tuscany from every part of Europe for this event, and at the end of the day we count only 5 riders out from the standings, and between them also Daniel Jud who didn't make the pre-finish, after a very good race.\n\nThe winner of the first day was Michel Szuster in front, for only 9 seconds, to the italian Andrea Beconi and the portuguese Paulo Felicia. In the Europe Trophy, Italy is leader with Beconi, Paoli and Zanni in front of Portugal, second, with Felicia, Reis and Rodriguez, and of France, third, with Lebrun, Curvalle e Dubac. For the Junior Trophy first position for France with Bossi, Metge and Dumontier. Second place for Italy with D'Ambrosio, Mangini and Conforti, and the third position is for Germany with Beier, Hubner and Weidemann. Veteran Trophy, again to Italy, thanks to Pellegrinelli - the winner - and Belloni Pasquinelli and Mauri. Behind them Great Britain with Smithson, Greenall and Crimp. Third position for Czech Republic with Novak, Hanc and Posledni. Winner among the motos club Treviglio, thanks to Facchin, Canova, Vignola. Second place for Valdibure Pistoiese (Magherini, Lilli, Paoletti), and third Oggiono Club Team Enduro (Rota, Cerutti, Consolini). France wins the Woman Trophy with Puy, Bouisson and Rossat.\n\nJulian Crimp writes: \"We are second in the Veterans trophy. I had a good ride yesterday but two more days left. It's going to be hot today. Beating the Italian team will be hard but who knows with the bulldog spirit\".\n\nDaily Standings:\n\nE1 Junior: 1. Andreas Beir, 2. Goncalo Reis, 3.

The tuscan rider impose himself at the end of a day not so easy, with sun and dust, and the rain that has arrived at the end of the day, when everybody has came back at the paddock.Beconi lived this day concentrated in a terrible fight with polish Michal Szuster (Yamaha) yesterday winner  who, today, has won only two stages on the six of the day, against the three good result of Beconi. The portougues Paulo Felicia (Husqvarna) has won only the first special, today. Very important for the result of this second day has been the unlucky second stage of Szuster when his bikes decide to go off, allowing him only the 28th time.\n\nSo Beconi win the day and Enduro 2 Senior : behind him, in the overall, we find Paulo Felicia with a difference of 10 seconds. Third position for the italian Edo D'Ambrosio (KTM) winner of E2/E3 Junior. Michal Szuster is the best in E1 Senior but Italy is able to put in second classes position Alessio Paoli, sixth in the overall, behind an other italian, Alex Zanni.

After a season with stage in France, Hungary and Slovakia, Italy organize the last race in Tuscany with 3 days unforgettable.Sun, dust and big show ! These three elements have distinguished the last event of the european championship 2009, at Castiglion Fiorentino, where we find the news 2009's champions.\n\nThe last day, dedicated to the cross, have seen the start of the riders at 8,30 in the morning, but this time on the opposite way. Ladys open the starting list and with all the riders have gone on the cross camp where the men of Castiglion Fiorentino  Fabrizio Meoni Moto Club worked just to deep night.Let's start, girls ! The first to go on the stage has been the ladys group and the fight has been so strong and beautiful that public and riders of the other classes have really enjoyned. Queen of the day was the french Blandine Dufrene first at the end of the sunday race in front of her fellow-countrywoman Audrey Rossat. Unlucky day for Ludvine Puy that have a puncture in the first part of the race and she's arrived at the end of the race with the bib mousse completely destroyed. So she finished last in the day but win all the same the title with a gap of 10 points. Werner Muller has been the big protagonist of Veteran class against the italian rider Tullio Pellegrinelli, ever first in the days before  but only second sunday. The best result in the championship is for Toivo Nikopensius, from Estony.\n\nThe third manche in the day has been for E3 Senior where on the camp the fight was among Vita Kuklik, Daniele Tellini, Maurizio Facchin and Stefan Svitko: this last rider have a problem  he too, like Ludvine  with his back tyre and arrive at the end with a bad position: but in any case the european title is only for him. After E3 it's been the time of E2 Senior that gives to the public a very big spectacle just at the last minute. Paulo Felicia, crash in the first lap but have the force to start again and during an overtaking of Simon Wakely, in that moment in second position, he crash again and his motorbike stay on the Wakely's bike. In this way it's been Oskari Kantonen who take the second postion, behind Alex Zanni, ex cross man, and for this reason invincible on this kind of race. Third position in the manche for Andrea Beconi who win the european title for this class.\n\nIn E1 Senior the new european champion is Michal Szuster who takes the first place already saturday, but decide to dispute a very quite manche in sunday. Big fight among David Cadek, Amel Advokaat and the italian Alessio Paoli, third in the day and second in the championship. After Senior we go to see what's happened in Junior class : in E2/E3 the french Yannick Bossi has been the best\n\nof the day in front of our italian rider, Edoardo DAmbrosio. The victory of the european title in this case goes to Adrien Metge who follows the example of Szuster, and ride a very quite manche ended with a fifth place. Last to start the young riders E1 Junior : if saturday race have given the title 2009 to Dumontier, sunday the dominator was the german Andreas Beier followed from the portoguese Gonçalo Reis and from Roman Laurens.\n\nFor the One Make Team victory goes for the day and the championship to Daihatsu Terios Team and after them, with a difference of 7 points we find the french Husqvarna and the italian team Mucci Racing B.

Everyone got back to the pits safely.\n\nDay 2 saw 2 riders not start. Leo Cordingley suffering with a knee Injury and Martyn Lewis had bike problems. All 11 riders put in maximum effort & the support crews would like to congratulate all riders and thank them for providing an entertaining weekend .\n\nBy the end Greg was 2nd in E1 juniors & Simon was third in E2 seniors.

Unfortunately the luxury boat trip we promised had turned out to be a cargo ship with only a small space for passengers. The entertainment on the ferry was to see how far they could roll a coin across the deck or to sit in the sauna with naked Germans!\n\nThe three other riders (Ollie M, Lee Ed and Ed Jones) arrived on the Thursday and set about walking tests and testing the bikes. The practice track was very sandy with roots showing through so it was a good indication as to what the tests and going would be like. The sun was beaming down whilst we were testing so everyone got a tan if nothing else. For lunch we decided to head opposite the cross test where we had seen a small restaurant. We all ordered soup (5 hot and 5 cold) as I'm not sure of they have catered for so many at one time before, and also 10 main courses. There were very mixed reactions to the tastes and textures of both soups but the main courses filled the gap and we were on our way back to the pits.\n\nOn Friday all that was left to do was to sign on and put the bike through into the parc ferme. After a few noise problems we were all through and off to walk the tests for the last time.\n\nDay 1.\n\nAfter the start we went pretty much straight to the extreme test which wasn't very extreme apart from a menacing peaty woods which would prove to be a challenge by the end of the 2 days. Then we rode another 25 minutes or so to a check where Dave and Marilyn were refuelling. After leaving here we rode a 45 minute check which had an Enduro test in the middle. It was a very fast test so was not timed on the first lap of both days. The last check of the lap was a 30 minute check back to the start which had a cross test in between. On arrival at the test, Joey and Gareth were waiting to tell us lines and take our bumbags. There were 3 laps on both days.\n\nClass Overall At the end of day one: Ollie 5th (17th) Lee 9th (27th) Edd 7th (44th) Leo 5th (83rd)\n\nDay 2.\n\nThe course and Enduro test were run in reverse for the second day so after the start we went straight to the cross test which by now was very rough. They had watered the test over night and it had also rained a lot so there was a lot of surface water. As the course was backwards we went from there to a check before getting to the Enduro test which was reversed. Ollie and Lee had an interesting first lap as they were told it was timed on all three laps so things got a little hairy when they were \"to the stop\" not knowing really where they were going. Luckily it was all sorted out and it wasn't timed. After seeing Joey who was fuelling at the check we had the 55 minute check back to the pits with the extreme test in the middle. Dave and Marilyn were there to take our bumbags and Gareth was in the woods giving us the inch perfect lines we needed to get through the peaty bog. Leo bent his back brake on the test and Lee had some issues with his chain guide but apart from that everyone finished unscathed and on time.\n\nAt the end of Day 2: Ollie 4th (16th) Lee 8th (33rd) Edd 7th (43rd) Leo 5th (78th)\n\nResults\n\nLee Edmondson, Edward Jones, Leo Cordingley\n\nSECOND ROUND OF THE ENDURO EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP IN PORTUGAL\n\nAfter the successful first round in Letojanni (Italy), the Enduro European Championship had two more exciting days of sports in the second round held Saturday and Sunday in Oliveira de Hospital (Portugal), during the celebrations of the Portuguese Motorcycling Federation anniversary. The event was so perfectly organised that the Enduro Commission chairman, Mr Marco Bolzonello, declared: It seemed to be attending to a world event, for the perfect organisation, the spectacular track and the effort put in place by all the riders. The only negative aspect was the absence of Spanish riders, whose participation was particularly awaited, considered the short distance to Oliveira do Hospital.\n\nThe weekend started poorly when Greg Evans was injured in a road traffic accident on Friday evening. Greg had been walking the extreme test for the final time & he was driving back to the start in a hire car when he collided with another car coming in the opposite direction. He sustained a fracture of the femur. The other driver was not badly hurt. Greg's family were in Portugal & they report that he will need a operation to plate the bone but he is in good spirits.\n\nOllie Moyce (above) was fourth on the 1st day in the E1 Junior class & the highest placed British rider overall in 15th.

John Collins\n\nBolter & Wakely shine at 07 EEC opener\n\nBritish Husqvarna riders  Mucci Racings Daryl Bolter and MPS Racings Si Wakely, both showed that they are more than capable of claiming success in this years European Enduro Championship after securing runner-up finishes in their respective Senior E1 and Junior E2/E3 classes at the opening round of the series held in Oliveto Citra, Italy. Both starting the new series in style, in finishing the event with double runner-up results the duo, along with Polands Michael Szuster, helped the Husqvarna Mucci Racing team top the events Team results on both days.\n\nCompeting in the Senior Enduro 1 class aboard a WR125 former Junior EEC champion Daryl Bolter was determined to get his 07 campaign off to a strong start having missed much of the 06 season due to injury. Competing for the Italian Husqvarna Mucci Racing team, as he did in a 05, Bolter placed in a creditable second position on day one and finished in 10th in the events overall results. Placing 30 seconds behind E1 class winner Giuseppe Canova from Italy Bolter made several mistakes en route to his runner-up finish, the result of trying a little too hard early in the day. The classs fastest rider on one of the events eight tests on day one, Daryl placed no lower than fourth in class to place just under 30 seconds adrift of the winner yet comfortably ahead of the third placed rider.\n\nOn day two Daryl upped his pace and ensuring that he didnt make any mistakes he improved his result in the overall results by one spot to finish ninth and again claimed the runner-up position in the Senior E1 class. Finishing just 13 seconds behind E1 class winner Canova Bolter again posted the classs fastest time on one of the tests and finished consistently behind his Italian rival on all other tests.\n\nCompeting in EEC competition aboard Husqvarna machinery for the first time ever Si Wakely made his debut a good one placing as runner-up on both days in the Junior Enduro2/Enduro 3 class aboard his MPS Racing WR250. Claiming an impressive fifth place finish in the opening days overall results Wakely placed less than 30 seconds behind the events fastest competitor  former World Enduro Champion Roman Michalik. Making Sis overall result even more impressive was the fact that he posted the fastest time on the events enduro test on the third and final lap. In the Junior E2/E3 class Si topped two of the days tests, including the first, to claim a well earned runner-up result just 18 seconds behind class winner Oscar Balletti and comfortably ahead of the third placed rider.\n\nDespite picking up a 10 second penalty at the start of day two when he flooded his bike on the start line and subsequently failed to start it during the allotted 60 seconds, Si again rode well finishing second in class behind day one winner Balletti but dropping to 13th overall. Every bit as consistent as he was on day one Si topped two tests in the Junior E2/E3 class and once again consistently outpaced the majority of his class rivals.\n\nPrior to Darryl and Sis next outing in the EEC, which will be round two of the series held in Cered, Hungary on June 30 and July 1, the pair will compete in rounds two and three of the World Enduro Championship held in Spain and Portugal at the end of April and the beginning of May.\n\nDaryl Bolter: Things went well for me on both days really but I had a few too many crashes on day one, which dropped me a little further behind the class winner than I should have finished. Im still not back to where I was in 05 but having not really raced at all last year due to my injuries I guess it will take a little bit of time to get back up to full speed. Im really happy to have started the championship with two solid results though.\n\nI made lots of mistakes on day one, which affected my result. I was still second in class but I was pushing a little bit too hard. Day two was better and I was only 12 seconds behind the class winner. All in all it was a good event and not really as typically Italian as I was expecting. Being second in the E1 championship after the first round is great.\n\nSi Wakely: It was a very good weekend for me - Im well pleased with the start Ive made to the European championships. Day one started well and remained that way really. The first check proved to be really difficult in places but I managed to get through the bottle-neck that caused lots of riders to lose time without any problems. I really enjoyed the three tests and posting the overall fastest time on the final enduro test was great.\n\nDay two was similar to day one really  I didnt make any mistakes and really enjoyed the event. I was disappointed to have lost 10 seconds at the start but I still finished second in class, which was good. Its been a great start to the championship.\n\n2007 European Enduro Championship Rnd 1\n\nGrand Prix of Italy  Day 1\n\nSenior E1 class 1. Giuseppe Canova (KTM) 34:00.77; 2.

T he first day welcomed the participants with a very difficult track, made of a lap of 62 km repeated three times. Three special tests included: one extreme test, one cross test and one enduro test for a six hours race, with riders facing a height difference of 1000 meter: from the downhill to Angolo Terme (350 meter height) to the Lake of Lova (1350 meter height). More than 160 persons, from three different motoclubs (Bergamo Orobie, Costa Volpino and R.S. 77) worked at the organization. Very happy the president of the motoclub organizer Costante Bontempi who said:  We created a real race, made on the track and not only on special tests.. Enthusiast the Husqvarna Mucci Racing team, who played the lord and the master another time, placing three riders in the first three positions of the overall results confirming the leadership conquered in Lublin in Poland.\n\nSecond day for the Enduro European Championship event number 2, held in Borno (Italy). Three laps for a total of 186 km with a height difference of 1000 meters and nine special tests, well organised by the motoclub organizer. 163 riders have been started this morning and 139 have ended the race. A day that respected all predictions and reconfirmed the home rider, Fausto Scovolo (Husqvarna), leader of this Championship. Very good the second place in the overall results for the Czech Scheder Karel (Husaberg), while reconfirmed his good form the Italian Giuseppe Canova (Husqvarna), conquering the third place.\n\nBolter extends E1 Junior championship lead\n\nHusky Sport Husqvarna rider Daryl Bolter, racing for the Italian Mucci Racing Husqvarna team, extended his lead in the Enduro 1 Junior class of the 05 European Enduro Championship with two solid rides at the second round of the series in Italy. Winning on day one and placing third in the overall results, Bolter came close to seeing his championship winning dream ended just prior to the end of the first days competition following a head on collision with an event official. On day two Daryl placed as runner-up in the E1 Junior class.\n\nRiding as the first competitor in the event, Daryl topped the E1 Junior class on day one to extend his championship lead. But with just a few kilometres to go at the end of the first day Daryl was hit by an event official who was riding the wrong way down the course. Despite badly damaging his bike, and feeling decidedly second hand after the impact, Daryl managed to get himself and his bike to the end of the day and repair the damage in readiness for the start of day two.\n\nDay two didnt go quite as well as day one for Daryl due to his heavy impact on Saturday afternoon. Still shaken from the incident, and not feeling anywhere near as good as he had been on day one, Daryl still managed to finish second in class. In fact Daryl came close to winning again on day two and had it not been for a couple of slightly off the pace cross-country test times would have topped the second day, as he did the first.\n\nWith a win on day one and a runner-up finish on day two Daryl now sits 10 points clear at the top of the E1 Junior class at the half way point of the European Enduro Championship.\n\nThe next round of the series takes place in Mid Wales on July 16/17.\n\nDaryl Bolter: Apart from my crash on day one the event was really good for me. Ive been struggling a bit to ride at my best on day one recently so to have a good result on Saturday was great. It was close at the front of the class but to win was good. It was pretty difficult being the first rider on the course but I rode well on the motocross and extreme tests, which helped my result.\n\nOn day two I was feeling pretty second hand and was a bit shaken up after day one. I got whiplash in my neck, which meant that I was in a bit of discomfort all day. Also my bike was still pretty second hand after the impact, which again didnt help. Being the first rider on the course was even harder on day two. I found it really difficult on the cross-country special test, which was the test that I struggled on a bit on day one. I was fast on the motocross and extreme like on day one but just not on the cross-country. I was in fourth early on day two but I managed to get myself into the lead with only a few tests to go. Finishing second was a bit disappointing but considering what happened Im really happy.\n\nWinning the class overall for the two days was good and its great to have extended my championship lead. Knowing that Im 10 points ahead half way through the championship is great, especially as the next round is in Wales. Im really looking forward to competing there - it should be a great event.\n\nResults\n\nTHE ENDURO EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP STARTED IN LUBLIN\n\nThe beautiful settings of the town of Lublin in Poland, started the first round of the Enduro European Championship on the 30th April 2005. There were 2 Enduro & 1 MX test) & 3 laps (for a total of 300 km) over 7 hours. More than 130 riders of 14 different countries took part. 9 teams participated in the One-Make Team Trophy.\n\nThe towns Major gave the start to the race together with the bishop Giovanni Kielbasa, who blessed all the riders & gave a key ring with the image of Saint Christopher (Protector of the drivers) & of the Pope John Paul II.\n\nThanks to the experience of the organizers, the race took place without problems, even if some riders lamented that time control was limited.\n\nOn Day 2 Team Husqvarna Mucci Racing (Italy) dominated the final results with the first position for Daryl Bolter, second Deparrois and third Scovolo and now leads the ONE MAKE TEAM TROPHY (11 team). The second day course was 2x 109 km laps (one less than the day before) with six special tests for race longer than 5 hours. The competition, fierce from the start, was dominated by the French E1 class rider Nicolas Deparrois (Team Husqvarna Mucci Racing), followed by his team-mate Daryl Bolter (JE1) and at the third place the Italian E1 class rider Fausto Scovolo. The event was perfectly organized, with many riders congratulating with beautiful sceneries and good support from organization. The second event will take place in Borno in the province of Brescia (Italy) the 21/22 of May, organised by the Motoclub Sebino.\n\nHusky Sport Enduro Racing : Bolter leads E1 Junior European Enduro Championship\n\nHusky Sport Husqvarna rider Daryl Bolter, racing for the Italian Mucci Racing Husqvarna team, currently leads the Under 23 125cc class of the European Enduro Championship after two strong rides at the opening round of the championship held in Poland. Placing in third on day one and then topping his class on day two, Daryl also finished in an impressive fourth overall in the events combined Scratch results.\n\nFinding it difficult to get up to speed early on day one, something not helped by the relatively easy course in Poland, Bolter eventually found the form that has seen him claim Junior World Enduro Championship podium places already this year and finished third in the Enduro 1 Junior class. With the event featuring one motocross and two cross-country tests, Daryl proved to be both one of the quickest and most consistent riders of any class aboard his WR125 Husqvarna.\n\nOn day two Bolter upped his pace and moved to the head of the class. Knowing that he had the speed to take the win, a strong start to the day, added to overall special test winning times at the end of the day, resulted in Bolter claiming a comfortable class win and placing in a well deserved runner-up spot in the overall combined Scratch results.\n\nWith his first place finish on day two, added to his third place result on day one, Daryl now leads the Enduro1 Junior class of the four-round European Enduro Championship by three points.\n\nJoining Bolter in Poland was Husky Sport rider Chris Hockey. Competing in the Enduro 1 Senior class Chris placed 10th in class after the two days aboard his 250cc four-stroke Husqvarna.\n\nDaryl Bolter: The course in Poland wasnt great and I found it hard to get myself going for the tests. There were some bogs, ruts and water crossings but the rest was pretty much all top gear tracks. Because it wasnt too difficult I found it hard to get fired up for the tests. I guess I wasnt 100 per cent focused. I did eventually get my head into gear but and I finished third in the Under 23 125cc class but I was a little way off the leader. By the time I got going it was too late to do anything about the two riders ahead of me.\n\nDay two was much better. I knew that I had to be fast right from the start of the day, which I managed to do. I got my head into gear and won the class by about half a minute. Finishing second overall in the Scratch results was great as well. I didnt have any problems or make any big mistakes, which I was happy about. I felt that I was riding well and to be leading the championship by three points after the first round is great.\n\nChris Whitehouse writes: Just a quickie really. Firstly, a big thank you to all the people (some of which i still dont know the names of, sorry) who helped out with the fueling etc in Poland, it would have been damn hard without you. An event with a difference, where else would you be able to race around a major city in public parks, weaving in and out of people on their way to work surrounded by houses, how bizarre! We struggle to get land in the middle of nowhere and these geezers seem to be trying their best to create the most havoc! Awsome! All this and no-one seemed to be bothered, not even when marshals repeatedly blocked roads so a load of riders could get on safely! Although the going was a bit boring in places, could have done with an R1 in places (does anyone know if you can get nobbly tyres for them) i thought the tests were pretty darn good, with plenty of variety. All in all a damn good weekend without too many problems and generally good results by all of our lads, both on and off the track, (plenty of stories to tell) well done lads. See u in Italy!"
