        "text": "What Is Being Done About the Dead Zone?\n\nThe Nature Conservancy is working with farmers to promote more effective and efficient use of fertilizers\n\nThe reconnection of rivers to their floodplains not only helps to mitigate floods, but filter excess nutrients from the water\n\nLegislation like the RESTORE Act and Farm Bill plays critical role in protecting the country's natural resources.\n\nIt's time for us to take a fresh look at the way we manage large rivers and the gulfs and bays into which they flow. We've seen that dams and levees alone will not solve problems like floods and their impact in the Gulf. By managing nutrients more efficiently in farm fields and by restoring wetlands and riparian systems to capture nutrients and reduce runoff, The Nature Conservancy’s Mississippi River Program and Gulf of Mexico Initiative are working with farmers and other partners to slow or even reduce the growth of the Gulf’s dead zone and its effects throughout the region.\n\nWorking with Farmers\n\nIn river basins throughout the Mississippi River watershed, TNC staff are working with farmers, university scientists and departments of agriculture to promote more effective and efficient use of fertilizers and reduce the amount of nutrients that enters our rivers from other sources. In many cases better nutrient management also leads to better soil management, which reduces surface runoff and flooding and maintains or enhances agricultural productivity.\n\nOver the past 40 years about 70-80 percent of additional food needed by our growing population has come from the intensification of farming on existing acres. It’s simple. If we don't do anything to conserve soil and reduce nutrient loss on existing croplands, we'll have to clear more land and we'll continue to have growing dead zones in the Gulf."
