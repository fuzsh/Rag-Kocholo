The film, set almost entirely in the Auschwitz death camp in the autumn of 1944, tells the story of the 12th Sonderkommando, the next-to-last of the camp's 13 special squads of Jewish prisoners, who in exchange for helping the Nazis exterminate fellow Jews were given special privileges along with several more months of life before themselves being dispatched. The film was adapted for the screen by Tim Blake Nelson from his play. In turning the play into a film, the fateful decision was made to pursue a grim, uncompromising realism that may be unprecedented for a nondocumentary film about the Holocaust. These images are so strong that they defeat the film's moral complexity. â€” Stephen Holden",

        "text": "It takes a movie like ''The Grey Zone,'' a harrowing Holocaust drama based on true events, to bring home the limits of screen realism. The film, set almost entirely in the Auschwitz death camp in the autumn of 1944 (it was filmed in Bulgaria), tells the story of the 12th Sonderkommando, the next-to-last of the camp's 13 special squads of Jewish prisoners, who in exchange for helping the Nazis exterminate fellow Jews in Auschwitz were given special privileges along with several more months of life before themselves being dispatched. This particular group participated in a partly successful plot to blow up the crematories.\n\nOne duty of the Sonderkommando was to herd terrified prisoners into the gas chambers while lying and telling them they were going into showers to be disinfected before reuniting with their families. Another was to empty the chambers of dead bodies and to ready them for the next round of killing. And finally, they were to feed the dead into the ovens.\n\n''The Grey Zone,'' which opens today in Manhattan, was adapted for the screen by Tim Blake Nelson from his play, which opened off Broadway six years ago in a production by the Manhattan Class Company. (For the screen, Mr. Nelson also directed ''O,'' the high-school ''Othello,'' and wrote and directed the bleak little 1997 tragedy ''Eye of God.''\n\nAs ''The Grey Zone,'' which mixes truth with fiction, follows the day-to-day lives of a group of Hungarian Jewish members of the Sonderkommando, their profane, joshing camaraderie has a strain of tough gallows humor. Although most of the characters are fictional, one -- Miklos Nyiszli, a conscience-stricken doctor who assisted Josef Mengele in his monstrous medical experiments on prisoners and who survived Auschwitz -- was real. His book, ''Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account,'' was a source for the film, as was Primo Levi's essay ''The Drowned and the Saved,'' about Jews who were forced to become part of the Nazi death machine.\n\nIt is Nyiszli (played with a stiff, anguished gravity by Allan Corduner) who makes it a personal crusade to save the life of a 14-year-old girl (Kamelia Grigorova) who miraculously survives the gas chamber. Dragged out from beneath a pile of dead bodies, where it is presumed there must have been an air pocket, she is revived by the doctor, who hopes to make a deal for her to escape the camp.\n\nIn turning the play into a film, the fateful decision was made to pursue a grim, uncompromising realism that may be unprecedented for a nondocumentary film about the Holocaust. Where movies like ''Sophie's Choice'' and ''Schindler's List'' limited their horrors to two or three searing images, ''The Grey Zone'' is relentlessly graphic. Panoramic shots of the camp and its barracks strive for a grimy photo-realism that is underscored by an ominously grinding soundtrack that evokes the rumble of a death mill. The movie wants to give you the feeling of being trapped in the middle of hell, engulfed by horrors from which there can be no turning away.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
