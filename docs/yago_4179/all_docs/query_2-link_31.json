        "text": "“In order to better protect marine ecosystems and manage fisheries, it is critical to predict how an ocean ‘dead zone’ will evolve in the future,” Wang said.\n\nA coastal ocean dead zone is mainly caused by the flow of excess nutrients humans use on land, such as fertilizer application. In the Northern Gulf of Mexico, anthropogenic nutrients delivered by the Mississippi River annually produce a dead zone as big as the state of New Jersey.\n\nThese zones also occur naturally in the open ocean, with the largest found in the eastern Pacific Ocean. “It remains unclear how these dead zones will change as the planet warms. So, we studied the history of the eastern Pacific dead zone in order to better predict its future behavior,” Wang said.\n\nThe researchers from universities in the U.S., Canada, Taiwan, Germany, and Australia set out to determine the evolution of open ocean dead zones before human activity began to impact the ocean, Wang said. In addition, did these dead zones always exist? If so, why?\n\nThe team examined the chemical composition of ocean sediments near today’s largest ocean dead zone, located in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The team obtained sediment samples—the “history books” of ocean activity—going back 12 million years and analyzed nitrogen contained in microfossils, known as foraminifera.\n\n“Fossil foraminifera in ocean sediments are mainly made of calcium carbonate and they have been used to study past climate change for decades,” said Tianshu Kong, a doctoral student in Wang’s lab who studies foraminifera in her research. “Most foraminifera found in ocean sediments actually came from the surface water, so they can tell us what happened in the upper ocean.”\n\nThe team looked in the dead zones for signs of denitrification, which occurs when oxygen content is so low that microbes instead use nitrate to power their biological activity. Nitrogen has two stable isotopes, nitrogen 14 and nitrogen-15, and microbes prefer to consume the lighter isotope of nitrogen-14 during denitrification.\n\nWhen oxygen deficient zones expand, denitrification zones also expand, raising the nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14 ratio of the remaining nitrate, which is then recorded in ocean organisms such as foraminifera through the cycling of nitrogen in the marine ecosystems, according to the report.\n\n“By analyzing the nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14 ratio of foraminifera in ocean sediments, we can reconstruct the history of the extent of oxygen deficient zones,” said Wang, whose work on the project was funded in part by the Simons Foundation.\n\nIn addition, the researchers analyzed the phosphorus and iron content of the same sediments, which reveal the ancient nutrient content in the deep Pacific Ocean, according to the report.\n\n“Deep-ocean nutrient content is hard to reconstruct and our record is the first of its kind over the past 12 million years; its trends have important implications for the global carbon cycle and climate change,” said Woodward W. Fischer, a co-author of the study and professor at the California Institute of Technology."
