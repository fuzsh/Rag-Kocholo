        "text": "What can be done to reduce the size of the dead zone?\n\nThe dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily a result of runoff of nutrients from fertilizers and manure applied to agricultural land in the Mississippi River basin. Runoff from farms carries nutrients with the water as it drains to the Mississippi River, which ultimately flows to the Gulf of Mexico. If a number of nutrients reaching the Gulf of Mexico can be reduced, then the dead zone will begin the shrink.\n\nSince 2008, the Hypoxia Task Force, led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and consisting of five federal agencies and 12 states, has been working to implement policies and regulations with the aim of reducing the size of the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Many of the strategies for reducing nutrient loading target agricultural practices including (USEPA, TheSources and Solutions: Agriculture).\n\nNutrient management: The application of fertilizers can vary in amount, timing, and method with varying impacts on water quality. Better management of nutrient application can reduce nutrient runoff to streams.\n\nCover Crops: Planting of certain grasses, grains or clovers, called cover crops can recycle excess nutrients and reduce soil erosion, keeping nutrients out of surface waterways.\n\nBuffers: Planting trees, shrubs, and grass around fields, especially those that border water bodies, can help by absorbing or filtering out nutrients before they reach a water body.\n\nConservation tillage: Reducing how often fields are tilled reduces erosion and soil compaction, builds soil organic matter, and reduces runoff.\n\nManaging livestock waste: Keeping animals and their waste out of streams, rivers, and lakes keep nitrogen and phosphorus out of the water and restores stream banks.\n\nDrainage water management: Reducing nutrient loadings that drain from agricultural fields helps prevent degradation of the water in local streams and lakes.\n\nWatch the following video from the US Department of Agriculture about strategies to reduce nutrient loading into the Mississippi River:\n\nVideo: Preventing Runoff Into The Mississippi River (1:44)\n\nEPA website about nutrient pollution and some solutions to nutrient pollution: The Sources and Solutions: Agriculture\n\nActivate Your Learning\n\nReview the graphs below and answer the questions. Figure 4.2.11 presents the size of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico from 1985 to 2014. The U.S. Environmental Production Agency led a task force in 2008 that identified a goal to reduce the five-year average of the size of the dead zone to less than 2,000 square miles by 2015.\n\nHow close have we come to achieving the action plan goal? How many years between 1985 and 2014 had a hypoxic zone smaller than 2,000 square miles (5,000 square kilometers)?\n\nAnswer: We have not come very close. The 5-year average size of the dead zone from 2010-2014 was about 5,800 square miles and the goal is 2,000 square miles. There was only one year, 2000, between 1985 and 2014 in which the dead zone was smaller than the action plan goal of 2,000 square miles.\n\nRelate the loading of phosphorus and nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 4.2.12 and Figure 4.2.13) to the size of the dead zone. What needs to happen to the annual total nitrogen and phosphorus loading in order to reduce the size of the dead zone?\n\nAnswer: The annual total nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the Gulf of Mexico has remained high from 1980-2011. In order to reduce the size of the dead zone, the annual nutrient loading needs to decrease. There is a goal to reduce the nutrient loading by 45% of the 1980-1996 baseline average.\n\nPropose some possible strategies that could contribute to a reduction in the size of the hypoxic zone. Whose responsibility do you think it is to strategize for reduction of the size of the hypoxic zone? Whose responsibility is it to regulate and enforce strategies for reduction? Who do you think should pay for the proposed strategies? What are some of the challenges associated with your proposed strategies?"
