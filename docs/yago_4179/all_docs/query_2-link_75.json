        "text": "3. UK leading causes of death for all ages\n\nThe leading causes of death for males and females since 2001 are presented in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The numbers of deaths from ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) and cerebrovascular disease have decreased over time, but IHD remains the leading cause of death in males.\n\nFor females, the number of deaths caused by the dementia and Alzheimer disease has increased since 2001. In 2011, this became the leading cause of death, accounting for 16.5% of all female deaths in 2018.\n\nThere are several reasons why the number of deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease has increased in recent years. Dementia and Alzheimer disease are more likely to occur among older age groups, and more people are living longer and surviving other illnesses. In addition, a better understanding of dementia and improved diagnosis is likely to have caused increased reporting of dementia on death certificates. This may be a consequence of initiatives put in place in 2013 to 2014, such as the Prime Minister’s challenge on dementia and the government’s mandate to NHS England, which included an ambition that two-thirds of the estimated number of people with dementia in England should have a diagnosis.\n\nThere was a 2011 update to the coding framework and a 2014 update to the coding framework used to code cause of death. These updates increased the number of deaths coded with an underlying cause of dementia.\n\nFigure 1: While there has been a decrease in deaths resulting from IHD, it remains the main cause of male deaths\n\nDeaths registered in the UK by leading causes of death, males, all ages, 2001 to 2018\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics – Leading causes of death\n\nNotes:\n\nBased on deaths registered in the calendar year.\n\nUpdates to the coding framework used to code cause of death took place in 2011 and 2014.

UK leading causes of death by age group\n\nThe overall changes seen in the leading causes of death in the UK between 2001 and 2018 have been largely influenced by the older age groups analysed (65 years and over).\n\nUK leading causes of death for those aged 80 years and over\n\nIn 2001, the leading cause of death in males and females was ischaemic heart disease (IHD), accounting for 21.8% and 18.1% of deaths registered, respectively. Since then, there has been a decrease in deaths resulting from IHD and cerebrovascular disease and an increase in deaths resulting from the dementia and Alzheimer disease. For males, the dementia and Alzheimer disease became the leading cause of death in 2015, accounting for 15.1% of deaths registered for males aged 80 years and over in 2018. For females, it became a leading cause of death in 2009 and then again from 2011 onwards.\n\nUK leading causes of death for those aged 65 to 79 years\n\nSince 2001, there has been a decrease in deaths resulting from IHD. It has decreased from 26.0% of deaths registered to males aged 65 to 79 years in 2001 to 14.8% in 2018. Despite this, IHD remains the leading cause of death for males aged 65 to 79 years.\n\nFor females aged 65 to 79 years, IHD was the leading cause of death until 2013, when malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung became the leading cause of death. Deaths from malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung accounted for 10.4% of female deaths in this age group in 2018.\n\nUK leading causes of death for those aged 50 to 64 years\n\nFrom 2001 to 2018, IHD has been the leading cause of death in males aged 50 to 64 years. Males in this age group had over three times the number of deaths from IHD than females throughout the years observed. In 2018, there were 6,570 male deaths from IHD (17.2% of total male deaths for those aged 50 to 64 years), whereas there were 1,767 female deaths from IHD (6.8% of total female deaths for those aged 50 to 64 years).\n\nFor females, the leading cause of death was malignant neoplasm of breast from 2001 to 2007 (accounting for 12.2% of total female deaths aged 50 to 64 years in 2001). From 2008, malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung was the leading cause of death, accounting for 10.1% of deaths in this age group in 2018. These findings could partly be explained by the increase in breast cancer survival in England (see Public Health England’s report on cancer survival) and the likelihood that those dying from neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung would have started smoking at a time when prevalence was high (see adult smoking habits in the UK).\n\nUK leading causes of death for the younger age groups\n\nThe leading cause of death for males aged 35 to 49 years changed from IHD between 2001 and 2010, to suicide and injury or poisoning of undetermined intent from 2011 to 2015, to accidental poisoning in more recent years.\n\nSuicide and injury or poisoning of undetermined intent was the leading cause of death for both males and females aged 20 to 34 years in the UK, for all years observed. Males had over three times the number of deaths from suicide compared with females for each year observed in this age group. In 2018, there were 1,233 male deaths from suicide and injury or poisoning of undetermined intent (27.1% of total male deaths for those aged 20 to 34 years) and 353 female deaths from suicide and injury or poisoning of undetermined intent (16.7% of total female deaths for those aged 20 to 34 years).\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n7. Measuring the data\n\nData sources\n\nDeath statistics are compiled from information supplied when deaths are certified and registered as part of civil registration, which is a legal requirement.\n\nThe summary figures published in the release include analysis of causes of death by broad disease groupings, which can be found in Section 10 of the User guide to mortality statistics.\n\nCoding framework updates\n\nIn 2011, there was an update to the coding framework (detailed in the bridge coding study) used to code cause of death. This meant that deaths from vascular dementia that were previously coded to cerebrovascular disease (I60 to I69) would be coded to vascular dementia (F01). There were further changes to the framework in 2014 (detailed in the dual coding study), where deaths that were coded to chest infection (J98) would now be coded to chest infection (J22) but those with a mention of dementia (F01 or F03) would now be coded to dementia (F01 or F03). In addition, deaths that were previously coded to aspiration pneumonia (I69) where dementia was mentioned on the death certificate would now be coded to dementia (F01 or F03).\n\nLeading causes of death\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) determines the leading causes of death using a detailed list based on one developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, with the aim to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies and interventions.\n\nTo identify the leading causes of death for this analysis, we used a grouping originally produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine which causes were among the top five for all deaths registered, accounting for approximately 40% of all deaths registered in each country. As this analysis covers an 18-year time period, we identified the leading causes of death for each data year from 2001 to 2018 for each age grouping, sex and country. This is why the number of leading causes of death we have focused on differs for each variable combination.\n\nMore quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI and the User guide to mortality statistics.\n\nBack to table of contents"
