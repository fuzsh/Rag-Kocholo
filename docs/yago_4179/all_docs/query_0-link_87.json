        "text": "Thank you. I was going to post something about that last night. Thanks to this forum software what I drafted is still there and here it is:\n\nBut the \"original\" Apollo version was nine and a half hours. This new six and a half hours is the \"definitive\" version, but was that ever shown anywhere, or did that ever even actually exist? From the press release:\n\n\"Even in 1927, Napoleon was screened in two different versions. The first, four hours long, was premiered at the Paris Opera and included three “triptychs” or three-screen sequences. The second was nine and a half hours long. It was shown at the Apollo Theater, without “triptychs”. This latter version provided the basis for Abel Gance’s “definitive” version, running at around six and half hours. Then between 1927 and 1971, Abel Gance himself produced several new cuts.\" ...\n\nSo, it seems there were the two exhibited versions in 1927, then from 1927 Gance used the (unexhibited?) \"definitive\" for \"several new cuts\", but no note that this alleged \"definitive\" version was ever actually \"completed\" and exhibited.\n\nI detect some misdirection or obfuscation in the press release, or I have missed something.\n\nI'm curious as to whether the '81 Coppola version had the trippy triptychs (the three projector widescreen precursor to Cinerama) that Brownlow's restoration rendered so magnificently in the Oakland screenings. When the curtains drew back for that finali the audience erupted in applause. In a film filled with breathtaking scenes that tri-color sequence was undoubtably the most spectacular.\n\nCat\n\nAsked restoration expert Robert A. Harris if BFI's plans affect the previously-announced NAPOLEON restoration he is undertaking with Francis Coppola and Cinematheque Francaise. His reply:\n\n\"The two are not connected. We donated the UK rights to the BFI and Photoplay (Kevin Brownlow and Patrick Stansbury) back in the early days of the project, in recognition of the work they had done over the years.\n\nZoetrope/Film Preserve [Coppola and Harris' companies] own all world rights with the exception of the UK and France, which was donated to the Cinematheque by Claude Lelouch.\n\nA few years ago, the Cinematheque did an inventory of Napoleon elements, many unseen since 1971, and discovered portions of the original camera negative, as well as other missing elements.\n\nWhile we applaud the BFI's latest efforts, we have been working with the Cinematheque toward the preparation of a more cohesive, and higher quality presentation, based upon Abel's Apollo version of the film.\n\nWe anticipate to be complete in 2017.\""
