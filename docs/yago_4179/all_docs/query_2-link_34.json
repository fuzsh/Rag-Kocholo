        "text": "Maintaining a Delicate Balance\n\nSuccessfully scaling Mount Everest requires a delicate balance between pushing one’s limits and prioritizing safety. Proper acclimatization and adequate nutrition are essential components of a successful ascent. However, exercising caution, sound judgment, and resilience in the face of challenges is equally critical. Should one aspect falter, the consequences can be deadly.\n\nWhy Dead Bodies are Left on Mount Everest\n\nThe high-altitude environment and extreme conditions make it challenging to retrieve bodies from Everest’s slopes. It is highly inefficient, impractical, and dangerous to move frozen bodies, which can weigh over 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nTo make matters more challenging, the unpredictable weather and logistical complexities make body recovery missions on Everest a perilous task that requires specialized skills and equipment.\n\nSome people have lost their lives while trying to recover bodies on the mountain. As a result, most fallen climbers remain on Everest, serving as a reminder of the dangers that lie ahead.\n\nRainbow Valley: Everest’s Open Air Graveyard\n\nOne area on the mountain’s northeastern ridge route, known as Rainbow Valley, is a critical point for climbers ascending or descending via the North Col route. It has earned its name not for its natural beauty, but for the colorful down jackets of fallen climbers strewn across its landscape. To date, an estimated 300 people have died attempting to climb Mount Everest, with approximately 200 bodies still on the mountain.\n\nNotable Deceased Climbers on Everest\n\nThe vast diversity of the deceased climbers on Everest paints a picture of the adventurers who sought to conquer the world’s highest peak. Each fallen climber left a story that speaks to the allure and danger of Everest.\n\n1. Green Boots – Tsewang Paljor\n\nPerhaps the most famous of the fallen climbers is Green Boots, believed to be Tsewang Paljor. He lost his life during the ill-fated 1996 Everest expedition involving the Indo-Tibetan Border Police team from India.\n\nThe name Green Boots refers to the green Koflach mountaineering boots he wore. Paljor and his team were caught in a blizzard just short of the summit. While three members turned around, Paljor and two others decided to continue. They never made it back.\n\nGreen Boots became a landmark on the main Northeast ridge route until his body was eventually moved in 2014. The 1996 disaster claimed the lives of eight climbers and raised concerns about the commercialization of Everest climbs.\n\n2. Sleeping Beauty – Francys Arsentiev\n\nFrancys Arsentiev was an experienced climber who lost her life on Everest in May 1998. She and her husband, Sergei Arsentiev, were attempting to summit without supplemental oxygen. Despite reaching the summit, difficulties on the descent proved fatal for both, with HACE (high-altitude cerebral edema) likely contributing to their deaths. Francys’ final words, “Don’t leave me,” added a deeply human element to the tragedy.\n\nFancys gained the nickname “Sleeping Beauty of Everest” due to her striking appearance. As she lay on the mountain, she looked as peaceful as if she were asleep. The harsh conditions had left her skin pale and waxen. After nine years, her body was finally discovered and recovered in 2007.\n\n3. George Mallory\n\nGeorge Mallory was a British mountaineer who disappeared during his 1924 Everest expedition. His body was not discovered until 1999, leaving the details of his final hours largely speculative.\n\nEvidence suggests he suffered a fatal fall, with severe head wounds and a severe rope-jerk injury around his waist found during recovery operations. Mallory was said to have promised to place a photo of his wife on the summit, which was never found, fueling the mystery about whether he and climbing partner Andrew Irvine reached the top before perishing.\n\n4. Scott Fischer\n\nScott Fischer, an experienced American mountaineer and guide, died during the infamous 1996 Everest disaster. He was the leader of the Mountain Madness expedition, one of several groups attempting the summit on the same day.\n\nDespite reaching the summit late in the afternoon, he suffered from HACE on the descent and could not make it back. Despite the efforts of fellow climbers and Sherpas to assist him, he passed away near the South Summit.\n\n5. David Sharp\n\nDavid Sharp was a British mountaineer who met a tragic end during his solo attempt to summit Everest in 2006. He succumbed to a combination of hypothermia, altitude sickness, and oxygen deprivation on the mountain’s north side.\n\nDespite over 40 climbers passing by him on the night of his death, only a few attempted to help, raising questions about moral obligations in such situations.\n\n6. Hannelore Schmatz\n\nHannelore Schmatz was the fourth woman to reach Everest’s summit and the first woman to die on the mountain. She died in a bivouac near the summit in 1979 while on an expedition with her husband.\n\nDespite the efforts of their Sherpa guides to convince them to move, they stayed put, exposed to extreme weather conditions that proved fatal. Her body used to sit as a landmark on the mountain, but eventually disappeared due to natural forces.\n\n7. Shriya Shah-Klorfine\n\nShriya Shah-Klorfine was a Nepali-born Canadian mountaineer who died on Everest in 2012. Her summit attempt coincided with a crowded season, and she became caught in bottlenecks on the way to the top. Despite reaching the summit, exhaustion and lack of oxygen proved too much on the descent."
