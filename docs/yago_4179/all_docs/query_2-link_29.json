        "text": "By Thomas Chouvenc, Ph.D.\n\nTermites are voracious critters that can cause extensive damage to structures. This is particularly true with some invasive subterranean termite species within the Coptotermes genus in the southeast United States, such as the Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus) and the Asian subterranean termite (Coptotermes gestroi). Both species can form large colonies of millions of individuals and have a high destructive potential, costing several billions of dollars in damage, treatment, and repair in the U.S.\n\nHistorically, the use of liquid termiticides has been a standard practice in protecting houses across the country against various species of subterranean termites, including native and invasive ones. In the early 1980s, traditionally used chemicals for termite control were phased out owing to environmental concerns and were replaced with less persistent products. However, the treatment protocol has remained similar: drench the soil around the structure with a pesticide treatment to keep termites away.\n\nFor more than 20 years, it was assumed that newer generations of non-repellent liquid termiticide chemicals had the ability to spread among all termites within a subterranean colony and could lead to termite population control through transfer among nestmates. However, in a new study published in July in the Journal of Economic Entomology, I confirmed that such treatments actually have limited impact on subterranean termite colonies’ long-term functioning and survival.\n\nWhile it is true that liquid termiticide treatments can provide some level of protection against subterranean termite populations and effectively prevent damage in structures, the nearby colonies in the ground surrounding the structure are not significantly impacted, meaning damage may potentially be postponed.\n\nThis study demonstrated that a relatively small number of subterranean termites foraging in soil treated with a commonly used non-repellent termiticide would rapidly die within proximity of the treatment, leading to an accumulation of dead bodies. While this may initially sound good, such an area of dead termites creates a situation in which the rest of the colony avoids the area due to the smell of death. This is known as a “secondary repellency” effect.\n\nThe study showed that this termite “death zone” spreads up to 2.56 meters (8.4 feet) from the treatment, preventing overall termite activity within that zone over time. Remarkably, in some cases as little as 1.5 percent of the termite colony population was directly impacted by the treatment, allowing the remaining termite population to maintain its long-term potential for damage within the non-treated area.\n\nAs explained in the report detailing these findings, “Effectively, while such liquid termiticides are technically non-repellent to subterranean termite foragers in their formulation, they become functionally repellent in their application, as a result of the early mortality onset of foragers around the treated area.”\n\nSubterranean termites can forage for several hundreds of feet underground and can avoid areas that are detrimental to them. With millions of individuals, colonies can complete their life cycle over time and continue to produce future generations of termite colonies within the affected communities, raising sustainability questions about the long-term use of liquid termiticides to protect structures.\n\nThis study complements a long series of independent research efforts about the efficacy of non-repellent termiticides on termite activity, in the field and in the laboratory. (See a summary of this research in the introduction to the new study.) A scientific consensus has developed about the relevance of secondary repellency in subterranean termite control methodologies. One major takeaway from such research is that “foraging distance” is a critical factor to take into account, an aspect that has often been ignored in subterranean termite control research. The potential implications for the termite pest control industry is tangible.\n\n“We already had elements of evidence that secondary repellency was at play since 2005, but there has been a long reluctance from the industry to accept it,” says Paul Kelly, an Alabama pest management professional. “The data provided by this study is rather compelling: Liquid termiticides have little impact on large subterranean termite colonies. It’s a Band-Aid”\n\nScott Kight, ACE, a pest management professional in Florida, concurs. “Our understanding of how subterranean treatments work has fundamentally changed over the past decades,” he says. “This study puts the finger on important points of discussion, and, more importantly, now I know why some of my non-repellent liquid termiticide jobs failed in the past.”\n\nIn comparison, as extensively demonstrated over the past few decades, the use of chitin synthesis inhibitor (CSI) baits against subterranean termites can result in colony elimination, with a fraction of the environmental cost when compared to liquid termiticides, regardless of the foraging distance.\n\nThe new study also raises an additional important concern: In the past decade, dual use of both liquid termiticides and CSI baits against subterranean termites, often referred to as “liquid wraps,” has become common. However, the existence of the death zone implies that placing bait stations within a short distance of the liquid termiticide treatment may negate the ability of the termites to access the bait stations because of the avoided death zone. Instead, placing such stations strategically away from any liquid termiticide treatments may therefore be necessary to increase the chance of bait interception.\n\nDonny Oswalt, Ph.D., a consulting entomologist in Alabama, also commented on the study. “This recent work performed at the UF subterranean termite research laboratory offers the pest management industry valuable insights into how non-repellent termiticides protect structures and potentially impact subterranean termite colonies,” Oswalt says. “Pest management professionals can use this information to enhance current standalone liquid treatment strategies with non-repellent termiticides and improve the effectiveness of termite baits when used in combination. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of a powerful and successful tool used in subterranean termite control.”\n\nAs the termite pest control industry has gone through a drastic transformation in the past four decades, there is still plenty of room for technological improvement that stems from a core understanding of the complex biology of subterranean termites, enhancing the tools available to the industry to help protect structures against such urban pests.\n\nThomas Chouvenc, Ph.D., is an associate professor at University of Florida’s Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center, part of the UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. His research focuses on termite biology, symbiosis, evolution, and control.
