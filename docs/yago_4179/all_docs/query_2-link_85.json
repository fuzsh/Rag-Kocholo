        "text": "March 2, 2021\n\n70 pages in, I decided I don’t want to continue with this book.\n\nNim has indeed accomplished a lot and his account of 14 summits is certainly impressive beyond belief.\n\nHowever, this book so far has been the most self-centered, yet least articulate, autobiography I’ve ever read.\n\nPerhaps being so self-centered (and macho - suppressing any vulnerability or insecurity within) is what made it possible to achieve his physically challenging endeavors. But it’s so disappointing to see there is no discussion of personal development along the way and all discussions of how not to show any fear or deep thoughts.\n\nThe first 70 pages are mostly about his military training with a very toxic masculine language that is really outdated and has very little value. You read one page after another about how he considers himself super athletic, too good for any challenge, “only having faith in himself”, and “never acknowledging vulnerability of emotions” but not once do you get a detailed account of how he managed psychological challenges and gained better understanding of the world when going through these experiences.\n\nI gave up reading because I felt, although I think what he did was incredibly impressive and beyond human, the account of his physical training and outdated views didn’t make me gain any respect for him.\n\nyes, Nima has built a superior body. But mind? Mindset? Value systems? Nothing that I can find inspiring\n\nNovember 24, 2020\n\nIn short, it could've been a masterpiece if curated and narrated in a much better manner. Nims, you already are a legend and everything you've done so far has been legendary. Probably, you hurried up releasing the book as some times it loses its flow, at times it sounds repetetive, and narration is pedestrian at best. However, nothing takes away the the credit which goes to you and your team of Project Possible for inspiring millions of people to realise their potential, and sending out a strong message about climate change and preservation of our habitat. I wish and assume that you'll be able to redeem your narration through the documentary on your exploits.\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nLike many, I watched the documentary 14 Peaks on Netflix and was flabbergasted. I was already on a mountaineering book reading binge, but I waited until I'd read a bunch of other books before requesting this one from the library. It's a fast, frothy read--if you watched the documentary and want more details (relatively speaking), it's a good book for that. I found the Netflix doc interesting but felt it really skimmed a lot of the peaks--well now I know that's partly because of a lack of footage, per the book--there was no documentary team signed on at the start and the team took a lot of the footage themselves, when they could.\n\nI think the book is a fine supplement to the documentary, so if you're reaching for it for that reason, as I did, I recommend it. Though you know the whole story, of course. The \"beats\" are identical, told in much the same way/structure as the documentary. And the book does have some downsides, at least for me personally as a reader. If you're genuinely interested in mountaineering, especially 8,000 meter peaks--their challenges, history, and the complex psychology of those who climb them, you cannot read this in isolation. There are much better books to actually scratch beyond the surface of the subject.\n\nAs I read, I had this niggling feeling... look I called this book frothy and it is. It has a feel of one of those ghostwritten celebrity memoirs where the subject stuck to a specific PR narrative and the writer did the best they could to write around it. While you do get more details on select climbs, the book still skims a lot. It's very surface. Oh we went to climb X peak and there was a hard moment or two but I did it! Believing in myself did it! My team was great! We fixed the lines when other climbers wouldn't! My climb will inspire people. Rinse and repeat. The one that surprised me most was K2. The book covers scaling the infamous Bottleneck and reaching the summit in a single paragraph. It just... skips the most harrowing part of K2, including the section climbers have to shimmy across single-file where 4 or 5 people died in 2008 alone. There was similar skimming on other peaks, and I honestly had read this hoping to learn more about the lesser-written-about 8,000ders. But this is not that book. I decided to finally get Ed Viesturs book on his 14 summits instead since I know he goes into great historical detail (and I've read all his other books already).\n\nAlso on the subject of skimming, you get little in the way of... any context for any of the mountains for the past, let alone the 2019 season. There's a mention every once in a blue moon of past disasters, like the avalanches on K2 in 2008, but it's just surprising to me that while talking about how brutal Nanga Parbat was the book didn't cover some of the more infamous deaths on that mountain. Same with Annapurna. And Everest. And K2. And so on. The book rarely if ever mentions famous mountaineers/first summits/big tragedies. And notably: it doesn't mention the deaths on the very same peaks in 2019, during Project Possible. I was a bit surprised. \"Nanga Parbat in 2019, why does that sound familiar?\" I thought. It was because Tom Ballard died a few short months before Nims' climb--eerily notable because his mother famously died on K2 in 1995 (Alison Hargreaves). Or the many people who died on Everest in 2019--the book covers Nims' famous photo, but not the aftermath of it (read The Third Pole if you're interested in that!). It just would have made the book much more interesting and deeper to cover this contextual information--it both augments how incredible his feat was, but also it's important to NEVER forget how deadly these mountains can be. That it takes a certain amount of hubris to climb them--and bad luck kills a lot of people, often, on them. Again: it's a frothy memoir. Though, to that end, perhaps this was NOT ghostwritten. A ghostwriter might have added those details, understanding how they would round out the narrative (imo). Or the ghostwriter knows nothing about mountaineering. Who knows.\n\nAnd then... there was just a bravado that at times itched a little. When I got to the afterward, I tilted my head more than once. Nims claims credit for inspiring others to try to tackle more than just 1 or 2 8,000ders in a single season... but many great climbers have already done that in the past? Yeah, none as many as him (really not sure his feat is easily repeatable, period, even in half measure). But many greats have done a \"three-fer\" as Ed Viesturs calls it in a single season long before Nims ever climbed a single mountain. Not a lot, yeah, but it was just... quite the assertion to make. He also seems to be claiming credit for spearheading cleaning up the mountains, and he has launched a very public endeavor (good!), but it is not the first. There was one on Everest in 2019, in fact, while Nims was completing his project. Nims alludes to some snobbish famous mountaineers who don't like him in the book--never naming names of course. I'm not entirely surprised. There are a lot of politics in mountaineering, and the issues of guided/fixed line climbing vs. alpinist and with vs. w/o oxygen can get heated. I wonder what some of the big names in mountaineering really think. This book has a similar PR shellac as Three Cups of Tea--a story most interested in promoting the primary figure/author as a Great Person. And, hey, he seems to be. But yeah... the book is telling a very specific story and manipulating it's readership on some level. It's more of a motivational book than a mountaineering book. Know what you're getting going in and supplement your reading as needed.\n\nJanuary 1, 2021\n\nNims is a legend. When reading Insta/news I felt like he found some \"glitch\" in the way how mountains are climbed (i.e. figured out some superior logistics, got enormous funding, superior team or sth). However, after reading the book I am even more impressed about this feat. He was leading from the front and putting in the legwork (trailblazing/fixing ropes) himself on the mountains. He was also handling all the logistics, trying to secure sponsorships and taking loans to fund this effort himself. Taking massive risks on all fronts. Wow!\n\nNotes for myself:\n\n- Nims nearly died 3-4 times\n\n- Even his head does not work properly at high altitudes / due to tiredness - hence, think everything through / research before the trip\n\n- Dont stress about taking too many pics, even he can't do it. The goal is to reach the top and not the perfect picture\n\n- The toughest part is fixing the lines, afterwards it's kind of \"via ferrata\"\n\n- Physical strength helps a lot. Really, a lot. This should be a 'hygiene' thing that you should not need to think of on the mountain\n\n- Concentrate on the goal and stick to the plan. Thinking/weighting of risks is done at home. You are there to execute\n\n- Cheaper operators are not always bad, but keep in mind that you are 'calling the shots' then. The goal of cheaper operators is to make clients happy and it may be harder to align your risk taking / incentives with theirs\n\n- Dont stress if the first attempt was not successful - why not regrouping and trying again? Even during the same trip.\n\nMarch 9, 2021\n\nNims is clearly as hard as nails and has a lot to be proud of but I couldn't stick with his overblown self-aggrandisement for long. What is strange is that this book does seem to be all about him whereas it would have been more interesting with some fleshing out: describing the team, the climbs, the scenery, etc. I skipped to Dr Chin Wui Kin's rescue from Annapurna as I was in Nepal at the time and was following it closely but that piece of heroism was dealt with in just 10 pages, and Nims failed to mention that Dr Chin didn't survive.\n\nI'm sure climbers and mountaineers will love this book but Nims's ego is rather overwhelming throughout and the memoir could, with a bit more effort, have been better crafted into a wonderful book. I admire the man but the book sadly is not a good read.\n\nMarch 4, 2021\n\nAmazing story and incredible accomplishments, but something about this just didn’t sit right with me. It felt like 300 pages of egotistical mansplaining. I wanted to love this so much! And im sure he’s a lovely guy, but the book itself left a lot to be desired. Also far too much talking to himself in the third person. In a veryyy ego centric way. Meh.\n\nRead\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nTl;dr: Special forces man child spends 303 pages stroking his own ego with all the sophistication and eloquence of a crayon.\n\nJanuary 24, 2021\n\nInspiring. This book made me feel like I could take on the world. As someone who intends to climb Everest Base Camp next year for the first time (covid dependant), this was so fascinating. Not only is Nims an inspiring and fearless person, I think his wife is also. She supported him even if it meant she lost everything she knew and wanted. That there is unconditional love. Breathtaking read. Loved every minute of it.\n\nJanuary 8, 2022\n\n\"One: Hope was God. Two: The little things counted most on the big mountains.\"\n\nIn this book, Nims tells his story about family, childhood, education, service, and decisions that have led him and his team to climb the fourteen highest mountains on Earth (8000ers). In 2019 he climbed the world's highest peaks shattering the world record by over seven years.\n\nThis book was what I hoped it would be. Nims talks about physical and psychological skills obtained while becoming a Gurkha soldier and later serving in UK Special forces. Competence that helps him to succeed climbing the highest peaks. He also takes us with him through all the Project Possible climbs, allowing a glimpse of what it takes to climb and reach the top of the mountain.\n\nHis undying dedication, focus, spirit, positive thinking, morale, and discipline is admirable. The way how Nims took all the challenges, setbacks and doubts, and turned them into something positive is admirable. After reading this, I have massive respect for him and the entire team of Sherpas who, working as a team, overcome a variety of struggles and life-threatening situations, and his family for letting him be who he is.\n\nThis book also reveals men's ambition, his self-centered view to success and, his egoistic approach to reaching his goals. I did not always agree with his decisions, nor I would be willing to put everything on the line for my ambition, however, it did not bother me (as I see it did other readers) because I agree with him - people, in general, do not like those that are the fastest or strongest in the pack (especially if they acknowledge and boast about it). While others use it for their advantage, Nims uses it for the common good. The values he is living by are ones we all should follow every day.\n\n\"Can I. Or can I not?\"\n\nMay 13, 2021\n\nBeing a citizen of Nepal people from outside might think every Nepali can see Mt. Everest from their balcony, or have climbed it. As you might know, considering you're Nepali, it's rarely the case. I had never given much thought about mountain climbing, what it took to do it, what difficulties people faced; it looked like a walk in the park from all the footages Nepal Television showed during my childhood years. Curse you NTV.\n\nSeeing how vividly all the trial and tribulations are explained in the book, I have a new level of respect for all the Sherpa brothers and anyone who even dares to go through this. And how about Nims Dai. What a beast of a man. Man of intense passion and willingness. A true leader and a passionate human being. I've rarely read about such high achieving human beings, and I'm glad I read this one.\n\nWhat impressed me the most about this book are two things.\n\n1. How he write about Nepal and Nepali mountaineering communities. He has put great effort in the book as well in his missions to provide as much benifit as possible to all the expedition crew mates.\n\n2. How he motivates himself to achieve the impossible. I heard that Michael Jordan spread a rumor about his opponent disrespecting him, just so he could motivate himself to beat him in the basketball court. Here, Nims Dai creates so over the top scenarios in his heads just so he can push himself to take another step in the snow. Do what works I guess.\n\nBook has very good language and narration. I'm inspired by all that he has achieved and I think this book or atleast his biography should be taught at school level in Nepal. I also would love to read his account about the recent achievement when his crew summited K2 on winter.\n\nAnyways, it an awesome read filled with life affirming examples and motivations. Congratulations to Nims Dai.\n\nMay 25, 2021\n\nI have followed Nims since the start of his project. If you check his FB/IG accounts, he comes across a bit different than in the book. I have been to Nepal, I love the people, the mountains, the food.\n\nNims Dai's achievements are already \"Beyond possible\", this much is clear for everyone. Even though I liked everything I read/heard about him up to the point of reading this book, the book was a major disappointment. From the descriptions containing a lot of military terms, to the repetitions and the \"alpha male\"-style of writing, this book read as if it were written by the mountaineering version of Kim Kardashian.\n\nApart from the impressive feats, the only redeeming sections of this book are those where he talks about his childhood or his family problems, thus making him appear human for some brief moments. It's a shame, great guy, great subject, awful execution.\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nAm citit cartea, am văzut și filmul. Cred că asta ar fi ordinea ideală de parcurs întreaga poveste pentru că tehnic vorbind este imposibil să introduci aproape 300 de pagini pline de cuvinte și simțiri în puțin peste o oră de imagini. Cartea te ajută să înțelegi exact cum a fost construit personajul încă din copilărie cu toate sacrificiile făcute pentru a intra în armata britanică și ulterior cu nenumărate întâmplări din acea perioadă pentru că alocă încă de la început câteva zeci de pagini generoase. Pentru cei care vor direct munte și aventură poate fi descurajantă această introducere, dar pentru cei realiști care înțeleg ce provocări aduc astfel de munți este esențială. Astfel, cartea îți dezvăluie de unde izvorăște atâta forță, determinare, rezistență și ambiție pentru a realiza ceea ce comunitatea de alpiniști și implicit toată planeta considera imposibil, un om să ajungă pe toate cele 14 vârfuri muntoase de peste 8000 de metri altitudine din lume în mai puțin de 7 luni de zile, în condițiile în care recordul era de 7 ani, totul fără timpi de refacere și cu resurse limitate. Tocmai de aceea autorul i-a ales numele “Proiectul Posibil”, pentru că el și grupul pe care l-a format în jurul său credeau asta și se pare că a fost suficient. Și pentru că Nirmal Purja a deschis astfel calea imposibilului, recordul său a fost doborât ulterior de Tenjen Sherpa și Kristin Harila.\n\nȘi bineînțeles, filmul. De ce ar trebui văzut dacă ai citit cartea? Pentru toate imaginile alea spectaculoase din timpul ascensiunilor cu cei mai înalți munți din lume pe care inițial doar ți i-ai imaginat și bineînțeles dacă vrei să-i cunoști familia despre care vorbește atât de frumos în carte sau dacă ești curios să vezi câteva detalii din cultul nepalez căruia îi este atât de fidel.\n\nRead\n\nMay 28, 2022\n\nI got to read this in Nepal with a view of the mountains that the author (Nimsdai Purja) actually climbed!!! he climbed the tallest 14 peaks in the world in the fastest record time of 6 months and 6 days!!!!!!!\n\nwhen you see these 8000m high mountains in front of you, you realize just how challenging a feat this actually was. I would not say this book is inspirational in any way because he doesn’t make you feel like you could do it too. the way he describes his experience shows mostly how remarkable he is to be able to do this incredible thing.\n\nMarch 19, 2021\n\nAn amazing achievement but I felt the book lacked some depth\n\nJanuary 19, 2021\n\nI was initially planning to read this book in a week.To my surprise I read it in one day. It was hard to put it down while reading about such a mammoth effort conducted by Nims and his entire team of Sherpas. Respect is earned , and I couldn't agree more.\n\nThe world had known about Nimsdai's superhuman feat in October 2019 ,but what the world had not known was all the effort,pain and setbacks Nims and his team endured to make Project possible a success.To achieve something of this magnitude without giving up even when pushed till the edge ,in merely 6 months is just unimaginable! The way Nims used his Special forces skills to navigate through some gruelling and gnarly conditions on some of the world's highest and revered mountains , is a testament to his undying spirit , and his dedication.Massive respect for the entire team of Sherpas who were there with Nims , working as a team in true sense in times of adversity and life threatening situations.\n\nIt was hard to stay still while reading the book from the comforts of my couch. Every inch of my body craved to go out and push my limits into the unknown. This book really uplifted my spirits , especially when the pandemic has left all of us in a grim mode. Respect for Nirmal Purja, Mingma David Sherpa, the entire Elite team has increased manifold. I had known of the Project possible team's accomplishments last year in October just like the rest of the world did, but knowing about how they got here to what they are today- the big shots in the mountaineering fraternity , this book takes you through the gripping ,bone chilling encounters , the high altitude rescue missions and events that certainly tested mankind's spirit like none another in what I would imagine to be some of the harshest weather conditions , with nature in its full fury trying to test the human spirit by constantly breaking it . The way Nims took all the setbacks and adversities ,and turned them into something positive everytime was simply commendable. Without that kind of a psyche, team morale ,and just mere physical strength of the team,this project would have never been possible, and it's the emotional resilience that Nims possessed on this mission that certainly made such a huge impact on it's success . We can all learn life's greatest lesson from Project possible . If you put your heart and soul into something, anything is possible if you stay focused ,determined ,are ready to invest in all your energy , whilst blocking all the negativity around .\n\nApril 6, 2021\n\nNimsdai Purja really has accomplished something extraordinary, but unfortunately I feel that the book really did fail to engage the reader, at no point did I get a sense of the effort required or even the emotions that he felt whilst scaling the biggest peaks in the world. Even though he had numerous brushes with death, saved lives and lost family - the emotion just seemed to be missing.\n\nIn the end, it felt like I was having to fight my way through my own challenge... finishing the book.\n\nJanuary 13, 2021\n\nNims is an absolute legend. This book is so much more than him conquering the death zone peaks. So much more than one man.\n\nCouldn't have imagined a better way to start off 2021.\n\nP.S - Seems like the book was rushed though, should've been furnished a little prior to release.\n\nMay 3, 2021\n\nBook doesn't do the achievements justice. Enjoyed the lack of editing to begin with, but his ego becomes laughable at times. Still, quite remarkable climbing and he deserves a lot of respect.\n\nAugust 28, 2022\n\nThe feat achieved by Nims and his team is simply legendary and astonishing. You know the man is crazy when he summits 14 mountains of over 8000 meters in a time span of six months and six days. To give a context the previous record holder took seven years for this feat. While reading a contstant thought which kept ringing in my mind was this - This man is unbelievable and he seems to break all the conventions.\n\nIt must be added that the background of nims really helped him to achieve the physical prowess.He has been a gurkha regiment soldier and then went on to join elite SBS forces of UK. This ofcourse conditions him to be better than average person but yet the enormity of his project cannot be understated. I agree with other reviews that the book looked like self centered proclamation of his prowess. But I think its precisely his attitude of not giving up or thinking really out of box which makes him the legend he is. Yes the book could have been much better but I thoroughly enjoyed going through it. I couldn't put down the book specially because I came to the book after watching the netflix documentary.\n\nIt is not that nims doesnt respect the mighty challenge of 8000ers but its just that he believed in himself much more than one can imagine. And I think he has silenced all the critics because his record says a lot about his conviction and tactical prudence.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nI almost didn't read this book, because I watched the movie. However, through the reviews, I learned that he goes into more detail than the movie shows. And I'm glad I read the book, too, because there was more details and information and drama than the movie explored.\n\nThis book is easy to read and follows a good timeline. The lessons he used from his military were amazing and things you can use in your own life even if you aren't climbing Everest. This book does reinforce my lack of desire to climb any of these mountains. The litter and the hiker politics are enough for me. I see it in other sports and I couldn't handle that, plus, I hate crowds and would prefer to just hike the unpopular mountains with pretty views.\n\nThere is repeated information and sometimes I got a bit lost on what mountain I was at, because he would hit three mountains in a row and also reflect on other mountains. I felt like a good organization of the chapters was in order. Like, this chapter is this mountain and so forth. Also, he wanted to put more spotlight on the Nepalese climbers on his team, but the book has just him and it's about his journey. I guess I found some contradictory statements. I can also see why people in the beginning turned him down. Not that he was crazy to have this idea, but I have to wonder about his pitch. In the book, I felt like he was scattered about why he was doing this and it kept changing. Was it about showcasing the Nepal climbing community? Was it about climate change? Was it for his own glory? I never really got the sense of his why. Throughout the book, he says it, but then says, no it's about this.\n\nWith that, this book is wonderful and inspiring and makes you look beyond what is possible. I recommend reading this book even if you have no desire to hike the big ones. You can also watch 14 Peaks on Netflix, which is amazing.\n\nRead\n\nDecember 5, 2021\n\nThe feats Nirmal \"Nimsdai\" Purja have achieved are beyond possible for most humans. To scale the tallest 14 Death Zone peaks of the world is difficult; to climb them in six months and six days is an extreme case of dedication, strength, stamina and luck.\n\nIn \"Beyond Possible\", Nimsdai writes about his adventures in the Death Zone. His kickboxing days at an young age, Gurkha training and Special Forces helped him gain strength, stamina and dedication which he could transfer in the extreme environments. Luck also seems to have favoured him as he went from mountains to mountains even when he was extremely tired or unwell.\n\nThe book is more about inspiring readers to summit their personal mountains than it is about the mountains themselves. This is because the details of some mountains have been entirely left out. The adventures to Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Shishapangma have been left out. In a book focusing about the record-breaking feats, the exclusion of details of some of these mountains made me quite sad.\n\nThe tone of the book can also make it a difficult read to most. I myself wanted to quit at around page 90 because the author sounds too arrogant. The swearings are unnecessary and can put off some readers. Also, a lot of conversations start with \"Listen\" or \"Look\" which makes him sound bossy. The author's alpha-male attitude, the patriarchal way of hiding emotions, and his claim that he fears nothing might not inspire most readers. Later, however, Nimsdai agrees that he feels scared at times but channelizes the fear to inspire himself. Writing this in the beginning might have helped me understand him better earlier in the book.\n\nSimilarly, the Nims-style, which requires one to push to the summit no matter what, sounds dangerous. While he admits reaching the summit is only half the task, he himself seems to be deluded by the summit fever in some cases. His decisions at Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I, and K2 are extremely dangerous. It is uncomfortable to see him fall into the traps of wrong decisions by forgetting the rules he himself set.\n\nThe book showed me how ill-informed I was about the Death Zone mountains. I wanted to know more by the end the book. I wish there were more photos and maps of the mountains. However, this is an important book that makes people more aware about the Death Zone peaks and inspires people to take on challenges in order to achieve what is beyond possible.\n\nEdit (November 5, 2021):\n\nThe trailer for Netflix documentary '14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible' came out on YouTube and I caught some quotes from the book. Excited to see Nimsdai and his team in action.\n\nEdit (December 5, 2021):\n\nThe documentary '14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible' is quite similar to the book except for the interviews of Suchi Purja (Nirmal's wife), Reinhold Messner and a few others. The details of some of the mountains is lacking in the documentary as well.\n\nFebruary 8, 2022\n\nWenn man (als Nicht-Bergsteigerin) auf Netflix über die Dokumentation \"14 Gipfel\" gestolpert ist, dann weiß man spätestens jetzt, wer Nimsdai Purja ist - ein Verrückter, ein Wahnsinniger. ;) Einer, der in 6 Monaten und 6 Tagen alle 14 Gipfel der 8000er im Himalaya/Karakorum bestiegen hat mit einer Gruppe von Sherpas.\n\nIch denke, es reicht vollkommen aus, die Dokumentation zu schauen. Für mich ist Nims' Buch einfach eine großartige Ergänzung gewesen und ich habe seine Stationen noch einmal ohne Bewegtbild dazu nachverfolgt. Für meine aktuelle Berg-Begeisterung in Buch- und Filmform hat das jedenfalls sehr viel getan.\n\nFinde es ausgesprochen spannend, WARUM Menschen sich solchen Risiken aussetzen und warum sie ihre Grenzen austesten wollen. Und Nims ist definitiv ein Mensch, der über jede Menge Grenzen hinweg agiert hat und sein Ziel erreicht hat. Seine eigene Geschichte wird noch einmal etwas genauer beleuchtet (armer Junge aus Nepal, der dann zur Eliteeinheit der Gurkhas gehört und später zum Special Boat Services) und wir sehen, wie spät er eigentlich erst mit dem (Extrem-)Bergsteigen beginnt. Irgendwie blüht er mitten in der Todeszone (ab 8000m) auf. Weiß keine:r warum. Vermutlich nicht einmal er selbst. Mittlerweile hat er noch einige andere 8000er-Vorhaben umgesetzt (erfolgreiche Winterbesteigung des K2), die immer für unmöglich gehalten wurden. Dafür einen riesigen Respekt. Ich freue mich, dass er Nepal und die Arbeit der Sherpas so in den Vordergrund rückt und selbst als optimistischer, nicht kaputtzubekommender Anführer mit allen gemeinsam auf diese Expeditionen ging. Natürlich steht er als Initiator dieser \"14/7\"-Challenge im Zentrum, aber er betont immer wieder, dass ohne sein Team absolut nichts funktioniert hätte.\n\nIch denke sprachlich hätte man aus dem Buch noch mehr rausholen können, aber andererseits mochte ich seine schnoddrige, gutgelaunte Art in der Doku sehr gerne und habe aus den meisten Seiten einfach Nims herauslesen können. Man muss ihn nicht sympathisch finden, man kann durchaus kritisieren, dass er etwas fahrlässig mit seiner eigenen Gefühlswelt umgeht bzw. zu Phänomenen wie \"Angst\" und \"Verletztlichkeit\" wenig Verbindung hat, aber das mag vor allem durch seine lange Zeit beim Militär erklärbar sein.\n\nEs liest sich einfach wie ein gemütlicher Nachtrag dieses wahnwitzigen Vorhabens, ein Resümee von einem, der eigentlich sogar NOCH mehr schaffen möchte. Wünsche ihm da bei allem einfach genug Energie und Freude. :)\n\nJanuary 28, 2022\n\nThis man is a specimen I will give him all the praise in the world for being a phenomenally strong willed and physically strong man. However this book.. is repetitive and mostly comes across as an ego party. I was hugely impressed by his military career and very confused with how he felt the need to say how he blocks out all emotion constantly. (His poor family.. they seem to all be constantly wondering what he will do next) although he's really put sherpas on the map and painted a true picture of what summiting is like (join the queue please) let's be honest he found a hobby he loved and gave up his job to do it full time. There's some lovely moments where he saves people.. I loved those moments (although I found out dr chin didn't survive) there's also a lot of moments where he gets stroppy at people for not having the same \"passion\" as him.. I mostly skimmed the last section.. enjoyed all the photos.\n\nJuly 4, 2022\n\nIt's still difficult to find the right words and describe the feeling after reading this book. Mountaineering is the subject that I really like and more of that I like books about survival, human abilities, and those doing impossible because that's so inspirational for me.\n\nI knew about the project Nimsdai was doing and from time to time I would've seen some posts and photos, yet I never knew who was this man, what pushed him and what dreams was he chasing. This book revealed all that and so much more.\n\nI wanted to read slowly and enjoy every sentence, but there were moments when the book just got me and I turned pages without stopping for hours.\n\nThat's an example to all those who gave up without starting, no matter what are they trying to achieve. Because it's not the description of a dream that's important, it's your attitude towards the dream. Like the author said instead of being one man, at the most difficult moments he was a hundred men on his mind. And to know that he not only climbed but also rescued that many people who were left behind by others, that even rushing he would stop on top and take in everything for long times...\n\nAnd turns out he is a great storyteller too. Book takes you in so easily and it's very natural even with stronger language and swears. From the moment when I found, out that he was trying to learn British jokes to compensate for his accent, I knew that this man looks at the world differently. He does what most of all are capable of but not willing. A Comfort zone does not exist to Nimsdai nor he is looking for it ever.\n\nAmazing read that's impossible to describe. Must read for those who are looking for real, raw, strong inspiration. Those who have family sick or dying, those who emigrate abroad or feel lonely, those who want to travel and have no money, those who want to become healthier... It's for everyone. And it's impossible not to admire. Well done to the author and my next job is to find the movie and watch it too.\n\nFebruary 6, 2022\n\nWow! What an inspirational book. Nims is truly incredible. The book highlights the power of positive thinking, and a human’s ability to overcome any hurdle. So many lessons I will carry with me for life!\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\nAs if my existential crisis couldn't become any more severe, I stumble upon this beauty. Never felt more inspired yet also more woefully inferior than I did after reading this book. Finishing the final pages made my southern service to Dalston Junction that more depressing.\n\nFebruary 1, 2021\n\nNirmal 'Nims' is a complete 'badass' as he describes himself. His story is so inspiring - true grit and passion that made him lead the life he wanted from his childhood. First the selection into the British Gurkha Regiment, followed by the even more tough selection into the SBS and then, going sideways for his true passion - wanting to climb the 14, 8000+ peaks in world record timings. And he did it in 'Nims' style - in 6 months and 6 days, shaving off more than 7 years off the previous record. His attempt at all these peaks was not only for himself. He lead a team of fellow Gurkhas, rescued climbers off peaks, highlighted the ill effects of crowding at Everest, the litter left behind by expeditions, all the while calmly ignoring personal problems which he had aplenty - poor response, no funding to start with, permissions and above all, his mother's failing health. All the same, this true life story is very inspiring for those of us who have set limits to our capabilities. Anything is possible!!!"
