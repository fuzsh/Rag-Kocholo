        "text": "For the “Exploring Mobile Public History” activity, I explored the The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza on my smartphone. The information and images presented on the website were viewable on the smartphone. The only drawbacks for viewing the site on the phone are the enlarged images and extended timeline information with images. On the phone, it is difficult to have a wide view of the images and timeline that are displayed across the screen on a computer or laptop. On the other hand, viewing the digital public history on the smartphone had some advantages. Based on the place-based or location-based techniques, the mobile site adhered to all three of the responsive approaches: how they want it, when they want it, and what they want. For visitors who are curious or unable to visit the museum in person, viewing the public history is accessible via the website. But, it is even more accessible for people who want to view it from their smartphones. The disadvantage will be for people who do not have cell phones or mobile devices. Also, if there is no WiFi, then there is no access. I was able to view the museum site on my phone while I was in an area that did not have desktop computers or laptops. Also, I was able to view the site while I was having lunch. As long as I had access to WiFi, I was able to view the site on my phone. By having access to the site via smartphone, laptop, or desktop, reflects that the site can be viewed with WiFi in different locations. Also, I could view the site when I wanted it. Instead of worrying about the Museum’s hours of operation, I could view the site whenever I wanted.\n\nAs for what I wanted, I was able to select different sections to view collections, timelines, shared memories, videos, and transcripts. Instead of reading about the history of the museum, I can jump to the next section and read about the assassination. I can also select Collections or The Legacy. If visitors at the museum do not have mobile devices or smartphones, the museum provides electronic devices for a voice driven tour. However, the mobile version does not provide a voice driven tour for visitors who want to use their own devices. The timeline presented in the “The Assassination” section closely resembles what is at the physical museum, so visitors get a similar experience. The images on the timeline are not viewable alongside the text when a specific part of the timeline is selected for closer viewing. The oral history in “The Collections Section” includes more transcripts than video recordings. The video recordings are linked to their YouTube Channel, and they are easily viewable on the smartphone. The audience engagement with the site is layered with different things. The Legacy section includes previously shared memories of the event, and there is a “Share Your Memories” tab to invite the audience to provide their stories during that time period or what they know about it.\n\nThe theory of history that The Sixth Floor Museum is putting forward is living history. Instead of teaching about the past in a single space, it engages the audience to trace the events leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 in a digital space. Also, The Sixth Floor Museum invites the audience to question what had happened and how the assassination of JFK is still thought provoking after so many years. The audience can envision the past while connecting with the present surroundings. For example, the site shows the physical spaces related to the tragic event from past and present. The audience can view the location of the assassination and where the sniper was positioned at the time. The site links to an Earthcam that allows the audience to view the Dealey Plaza from the sixth floor of the museum. The live camera shows cars, people, roads, buildings and other structures in today’s time. Placing the audience in the location of where the sniper was positioned during the assassination perfectly connects both digital and physical spaces together. Whether it is in physical or digital space, the The Sixth Floor Museum site engages the audience to think about history as living history.\n\nDepending on the environment or space, the representation of a public history project may vary. Whether it is a physical or digital space, the same public history project will be interpreted differently. Also, the audience interacts with it differently when presented with various ways of engagement between the physical and digital sites. Each space is open for interpretations based on its rhetorical representation; it is constantly changing and transforming. For the comparative review of a physical and digital site, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas was selected.\n\nThe National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame conveys the importance of recognizing the history and culture of cowgirls. The concept of the cowboy is a nostalgic and more commonly mentioned in American history. However, the concept of the cowgirl is almost forgotten or rarely mentioned in mainstream American history and culture. This museum demystifies the concept of the stand-alone cowboy and acknowledges the contributions of cowgirls. The outer space of the museum has two amazing statues placed in front of the museum. A bronze, life-size statue of a cowgirl with her horse stands on the left side of the museum. On the right side, there is a bronze, life-size statue of Sacagawea. Inside the museum, it has a circular design with a rotunda like ceiling. The environment is warm and inviting. It looks like a beautiful mansion with white floors and an impeccable interior design. There are two staircases on each side of the museum. The featured exhibit, “Pure Quills,” is on the far left corner of the first floor. The ongoing exhibit is on the right corner of the first floor and continues to the second floor. There is a video viewing room that is closest to the entrance door on the right; it features a short video of the museum’s collections and featured exhibit.\n\nThe audience for this museum varies. During my visit, I saw adult women and men touring the museum. This museum is also great for all ages and students.\n\nThe first floor of the museum features a circular layout. Because of the open and circular layout, visitors can start from different areas instead of one single flow of traffic. After viewing the video, the audience can enter the room next to it. On the right side of the wall, there is a bright red screen that asks the audience to touch the screen to begin. There are five different black and white photos of Annie Oakley, two Native Americans, a cowgirl march, Buffalo Bill, and an image of a cowgirl on a horse. After a photo is selected, the visitor steps into the brightly lit photo booth. After the photo is taken, a copy of the 3×5 photo is printed for free. There is also an option to send a digital photo via email or text. This activity is fun and interactive because it encourages visitors to learn more about the people and settings in the photos. If people were taking up too much time with the photo booth, the layout of the exhibit encourages the visitors to move to other locations in the exhibit that are also equally or more engaging such as the double-sided video screens hanging from the ceiling. Each side of the screen features videos taken during the time cowgirls were part of the Buffalo Bill Show.\n\nThe primary items that are used to communicate the interpretation of the museum are the collections of artifacts from well-known cowgirls such as Annie Oakley and Tad Lucas. These artifacts are displayed beautifully in separate glass cases for full 360 viewing. The circular navigation of the museum is very engaging and moves the visitors along. There are hologram videos that are built into the wall. It looks like a diorama that hangs on a wall, but in this case, it’s a digital diorama that speaks to the audience by looking directly at them during the speech. One of the dioramas features an image of Annie Oakley talking about teaching other females how to shoot rifles.\n\nI did not see any docents or curators interacting with the public during my visit. However, the museum will provide a docent led tour for a group if scheduled ahead of time. The receptionist who was also the gift store representative was helpful. After I purchased my ticket, she handed a pink sticker and instructions.\n\nThe physical site of the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame is engaging and informative. This museum is a great treasure for the nation. I wish more people would visit the museum because I learned so much about the American West and history of cowgirls during my first visit. I hope to return soon with my friends and family. I would not change the physical exhibit because it is effective as is.\n\nIn addition to the physical site, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame also has a website. The “About” page includes a clear statement for the purpose of the museum: “The National National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame honors and celebrates women, past and present, whose lives exemplify the courage, resilience and independence that helped shape the American West, and fosters an appreciation of the ideals and spirit of self-reliance they inspire” (National Cowgirl Museum). From the featured images of cowgirls to the amazing logo, the design of the website clearly communicates its argument. The primary audience might be women because the website seems to show more images of women and their achievements. It also features a slideshow on its homepage of future events such as the artist Barabara Van Cleve’s “Pure Quill” exhibit, Cowgirl Spring Roundup, the luncheon for the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, and the Old Bags luncheon.\n\nThe website seems to target white/Caucasian women because most of the images in the homepage slideshow feature white women. It makes the assumption that the audience is mostly white women. However, if the audience takes a look at the honorees, there are also women of color who were inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame.\n\nThe layout of the website is easy to navigate and search. Each of the tabs has categories of interest. For example, the “Museum” tab has seven featured categories with sub-categories. There is an “Education” tab as well as the “Hall of Fame” tab. For the Hall of Fame, the audience can learn about each honoree and her achievements. There is also an image of the honoree. Similar to the physical site, the website allows the audience to begin their journey from different directions. There is no “Start Here” tab or page, which allows more freedom for the audience to navigate the website. Unfortunately, there is no Search area or button on the homepage to allow the audience to narrow their search.\n\nThe website offers brief information about the ongoing exhibits and featured exhibit. It also includes the “Hall of Fame” honorees information. The Education page features information for school tours, video conferencing, traveling trunk, and Girl Scout Patch Program. The Support page asks the audience to become members, to make donations, and to volunteer.\n\nIn contrast to the physical site, the website provides Education and Support opportunities that a physical site does not provide unless the audience request such information or reads the museum pamphlet. The featured artifacts in the digital space do not compare to the artifacts featured in the physical space. The images of the artifacts and photographs on the website do not have a title, description, or narrative.\n\nFor the audience interaction and engagement, the digital space allows the audience to search the list of honorees, view videos, and search the archives. However, the physical space allows more interaction and engagement with the audience. The website allows the audience to interact with the site’s creators and curators. By visiting the “Support” page and selecting “Volunteer, the audience may interact with different departments of the museum. This type of interaction is central to the sustainability of the museum because it engages the public and values their contributions.\n\nFor the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame website, there are a few things that can be changed to enhance the digital experience for the audience. They should add titles, descriptions, and narratives to the artifacts and photographs on the website. Instead of placing them all together on one web page like a collage, they should be categorized. Adding a search area on the home page would also be helpful. The social media platforms should not be placed at the bottom right-hand corner of the website. An interactive component to entice the audience to learn more about the museum and the history of cowgirls should be added to the home page. Adding another language such as Spanish would be great because the physical site acknowledges the cowgirls from the Hispanic culture. Adding a tab for cultural diversity in cowgirl history would be helpful to reach a wider audience. The physical site includes information and images of cowgirls from Native American and Hispanic American cultures. Despite these suggestions for changes to the digital space, the museum’s website presents the overall argument very well.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe American Consumer Culture: Market Research & American Business, 1935-1965 database features many documents and ads related to well-known companies and brands during the specified time period. The interactive and visually appealing, digital collection is divided into “Documents” and “Ad Gallery.” The documents include market research reports, memorandums, proposals, and letters by Ernest Dichter, founder of The Institute for Motivational Research. The Ad Gallery includes images of printed advertisements from the iconic American companies that were related to Dichter’s works.\n\nIn addition to the general search browser, there are advanced search and popular searches. Also, there are tabs for certain categories for quicker access: Introduction, Documents, Industries, Chronology, Ad Gallery, Further Resources, and Help. If the user needs guidance to maneuver the database, in the lower, left corner of the home page, there is a “Not sure where to start?” button.\n\nFacts:\n\nThe date range for the documents and images is 1935-1965. When searching the documents, the user can view the digitization of the original document. There is a tab for “original” view, and there is a tab for “Thumbnail” to magnify the view. After it is downloaded, the user can make notes on the document. However, a keyword search is not allowed on the document. The entire document can be downloaded as a pdf document. The user can also download the image by range or page by page.\n\nFor each selected document, the title, report number, date of publication, location of material, copyright, type of industry (e.g. automotive, broadcasting, food and drink, retail, etc.), company, brand, method of research, keywords, and language are listed. By simply clicking on the “Find out more about this year” hyperlink, an interactive timeline displays what was happening when each proposal, report, letter, or memorandum was made. The hyperlink for the business or company information is available by clicking on “Go to Business Biography.” Also, there is a hyperlink for “Go To Glossary” next to a list of keywords that is linked to the database’s Glossary.\n\nFor the “Ad Gallery,” the images can be downloaded. The title of the advertisement, date, image type (e.g. magazine), source, industry, company, brand, keywords, publication, and image details (e.g. color or black and white) are listed. Hyperlinks to the Glossary and Chronology/Timeline are not provided for the advertisement images.\n\nAnother useful and interesting feature is “My Archive.” The user can create a folder and save the searched items for further research. The “My Archive” option is located directly above the general search browser.\n\nHistory:\n\nThree “Participating Libraries” have contributed to the digital collection of the American Consumer Culture: Market Research & American Business, 1935-1965 database. “After closing his offices in the Croton-on-Hudson “Castle” in 1982, Dichter placed his library of research studies, publications and other writings with Mercy College, where he taught marketing. However, when Mercy College sought permission in 1990 to microfilm them and destroy the originals to save space, Dichter repossessed them. He was working with a dealer to sell them to another library but was unable to make satisfactory arrangements before his final illness. These materials, plus Dr. Dichter’s remaining business correspondence and notes, were removed to Hagley from Dichter’s last residence and office in Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., in 2007” (Adam Matthew). Eventually, the Dichter family donated the documents to the Hagley Museum and Library. The American Consumer Culture database features the digital collection that was donated by the Hagley Museum and Library.\n\nThe advertisements for the “Ad Gallery” were donated by John W. Hartmen Center and The Advertising Archives. The John W. Hartmen Center is part of the Rubenstein Rare Books and Manuscript Library at Duke University. It “has provided a selection of valuable advertisements for our Ad Gallery feature, dating from the mid-1930s to 1950s” (Adam Matthew). The Advertising Archives is one of the largest advertising archives in Europe and founded by Larry Suzanne Viner in 1990. They donated advertisements from 1930s to 1960s.\n\nReview:\n\nAccording to Cheryl LaGuardia, Research Librarian for the Widener University at Harvard University, “This file delivers amply on the vendor’s claim that it “provides a unique insight into the world of buying, selling, and advertising in pre- and post-war America.” It does more than that, with sometimes chilling psychosocial analysis that will successfully serve researchers in the areas of psychology, history, business, marketing, advertising, consumerism, gender studies, ethnic and minority studies, communications, sociology, American studies, philosophy, terrorism, and politics. ”\n\nAccess:\n\nAccess is through the George Mason University database which requires an account. In the “Help” tab, there are five different categories. For example, there is a “Terms of Use” icon that can be viewed. Detailed information is found in Access and Terms of Use.\n\nPublisher:\n\nAdam Matthew Digital is known for publishing “unique primary source collections from archives around the world.” There are three participating libraries that have donated the resources for the digital collection.\n\nCiting:\n\nFor each source, there is a Citation button in black and white. However, it can be exported only by RefWorks and EndNote. The user has the option to select three different citation styles. The MLA citation is not entirely correct, but it is good enough. Consult the updated MLA guidelines for proper citation by visiting the MLA or OWL Purdue MLA.\n\nOther Information:\n\nThe database includes a great resource for educators and scholars. The “Teaching” category appears when the user selects the “Further Resources” button. There are images and exercises for the classroom. Also, there is a “Case Studies” category. The author, Stefan Schwarzkopf, explores key themes in the reports."
