The Library has acquired the collections listed below. Contact us about others.\n\nNote: the Financial Times will not license their historical archive for text mining at this time\n\nReadex has introduced a new tool called Readex Text Explorer, which allows online text analysis using Voyant within selected Readex databases. This is currently only available in our Foreign Broadcast Information Service database (FBIS). Connect to FBIS and select Text Explorer in the menu bar to use this tool.\n\nThe Text Creation Partnership is a joint effort to transcribe historical texts from three major databases\n\nEarly English Books Online (published by ProQuest)\n\nEighteenth Century Collections Online (published by Gale Cengage)\n\nEvans Early American Imprints (published by the Readex division of Newsbank\n\nThe Library subscribes to the full versions of these databases which provide page images but not easy access to machine readable text. The TCP has made that available for researchers to download for selected titles from two of these databases."
