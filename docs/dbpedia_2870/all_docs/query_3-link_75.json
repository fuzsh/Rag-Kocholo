        "text": "We are pleased to announce our partnership with Adam Matthew Digital on Sex and Sexuality Digital Resources – a new online archive which provides remote access to digitized resources from the Kinsey Institutes archival collections and is a vital resource for scholars and students with an interest in the history of human sexuality and gender research.\n\nThe Kinsey Institute’s Archives and Special Collections is one of the largest and most important collections in the world for the study of human sexuality. This resource provides unprecedented digital access to the Kinsey’s most important research collections, covering the work of prominent sex researchers such as Dr Harry Benjamin and Dr John Money, as well as the work of the Institute itself during the tenures of its first three Directors: Dr Alfred Kinsey, Dr Paul H. Gebhard and Dr June Reinisch.\n\nThe Kinsey Institute Library collection is a global destination for students and scholars of human sexuality. I’m so pleased this digital project makes it more accessible and available.” ~ Liana Zhou, Director, Kinsey Institute Library & Special Collections\n\nHighlights within Sex & Sexuality include excerpts from, and correspondence informing, Dr June Reinisch’s syndicated advice column, The Kinsey Report (1984-1993), which published in newspapers across America, offering an insight into public perspectives on sex and relationships, and research files by sexologist Dr Harry Benjamin providing key insights into his pioneering work on gender dysphoria and transsexualism from 1913 through to the 1990s.\n\nDigitizing the primary resources included in this resource and arranging for online access took a decade to select and prepare. In addition to our partners at Adam Matthew, the Kinsey Institute also wishes to thank Judith Allen, Shawn Wilson and Garry Milius for their diligence, expertise and outstanding contributions to this project.\n\nI am pleased to be working with Adam Matthew Digital to bring Sex & Sexuality to scholars of sexology all over the world. This collaboration will make widely available the rich resources of The Kinsey Institute Library & Special Collections.”\n\n~ Shawn C. Wilson, Associate Director, The Kinsey Institute Library & Special Collections"
