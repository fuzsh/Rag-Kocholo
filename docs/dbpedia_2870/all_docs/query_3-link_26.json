        "text": "APRIL 8, 2021 — The Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL) and Adam Matthew Digital are pleased to announce a successful partnership that has resulted in ASERL libraries gaining perpetual access to all Adam Matthew Digital content published through 2016. The cache of content now available to ASERL institutions includes 77 collections from the award-winning publisher such as Colonial America, American History, American Indian Histories and Cultures, Global Commodities, Slavery, Abolition and Social Justice, and Popular Culture in Britain and America.\n\nWorking as a group to reach a collective spend goal, ASERL libraries are celebrating the additional, unprecedented level of access to essential primary source content from Adam Matthew Digital. Access to primary source content is particularly vital in the current moment when physical archives are restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This partnership supports ASERL’s mission of “providing and maintaining top quality resources and services to students, faculty, and citizens of their respective communities.”\n\n“ASERL is thrilled our member libraries were able to make these investments that unlocked a wonderful trove of content,” commented Jan Lewis, Director of Academic Library Services at East Carolina University and President of ASERL’s Board of Directors for 2020-2021. “The past year has been so challenging for so many libraries in so many ways – it’s really wonderful ASERL libraries are able to receive this membership benefit to boost their collections.”\n\n“We’re very pleased to engage in progressive partnerships that widen access to our products, and enable a much larger community to access important teaching and research content during these challenging times,” commented Khal Rudin, Managing Director at Adam Matthew Digital. “Our teams are now looking forward to working with ASERL institutions to celebrate this agreement and to share information about the vast range of material available, and to offer support and guidance to ensure good visibility and engagement across their community.”\n\nTo find out more about the partnership, please contact:\n\nJohn Burger – ASERL Executive Director (jburger@aserl.org)"
