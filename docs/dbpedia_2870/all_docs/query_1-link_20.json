It’s our values, our mission and our promise to customers.\n\nThe way we look is changing, but our vision to place primary sources at the heart of education remains the same.\n\nBuilding on our past\n\nAdam Matthew has worked with libraries and archives for over 30 years. While we’re moving forward with a new name and visual style, we still want to celebrate our heritage.\n\nBehind the new look, we're still the same dedicated team, inspired by the unique content we work with. Our passion for high-quality collections, sector-leading technology and personalised customer service won't change.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nThe way people interact with primary sources and access archival material has evolved. From microfilm to AI technology, Adam Matthew has evolved too.\n\nNow as AM, we’re reimagining what a primary source can be. Our new brand reflects our commitment to innovation, inclusion and improving educational outcomes. It marks the next phase of our journey, encapsulating the work that we do.\n\nWith AM you can discover award-winning archival collections, learn how to use them, or create your own."
