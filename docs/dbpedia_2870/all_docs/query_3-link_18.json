        "text": "We’re retrospectively revamping our entire MARC catalogue to ensure that records are available at a document level and in greater detail for library catalogues and discovery products.\n\nUpdate: September 2021\n\nDue to the pandemic, we're likely to see delays in MARC delivery for the following collections: Medical Services and Warfare, Module II, Central Asia, Persia and Afghanistan, 1834-1922 and Colonial Files for the Caribbean, Module I.\n\nWe endeavour to build MARC records for every individual document in every AM collection. In order to produce MARC sets in a timely manner, we use an automated template to produce document-level records. In addition to this, we do produce full, manual records for serials, monographs and umbrella records for each collection.\n\nThe copyright holders for each collection varies. You can read more about a collection’s copyright status and how you can use materials from in the ‘Terms of Use’ of any product site, located in the ‘Help’ section.\n\nYou can find COUNTER 5 statistics for each purchased or trialled collection at counter.amdigital.co.uk. Your login details are given to library staff by our Customer Support team when access is arranged, or details are requested.\n\nAll of our documents, contextual pages and interactive tools have durable URLs allowing for link embedding into LMS platforms such as Blackboard or Moodle. Make sure you’re using the appropriate proxied URLs to ensure off-campus access is seamless. Speak to your library to find out more.\n\nFor any account changes, including IP addresses, branding, OpenURL resolver links etc, please contact the Customer Support team directly. Our UK based team monitor this inbox from Monday to Friday and your request will be actioned as quickly as possible, usually within two working days of receiving your email.\n\nPlease contact the Support team directly and they will investigate.
