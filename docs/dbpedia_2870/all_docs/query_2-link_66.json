In order to communicate the incredible value this resource provides and secure the continuation of our access to it, we need your feedback.\n\nBeginning July 2020, Atkins Library added a subscription to the Adam Matthew (AM) collections included in the AM Explorer platform.

Every year, new collections will be added to our subscription.\n\nTo communicate the value of this resource and to secure continued access we need your feedback.\n\nThis resource presents exciting new opportunities to engage students in primary source research. To brainstorm ways to incorporate Adam Matthew collections into your curriculum, assignments, or teaching, please reach out to your subject librarian. Librarians can also provide remote instruction to students on how to navigate this resource within a class session or individual research consultation.\n\nSubscribe to the AM Blog to learn more about the collections and view these cases studies to explore ideas for incorporating them into your instruction.\n\nEmbed AM instructional videos into your Canvas courses.\n\nYou can search broadly across AM collections using the Explorer platform, or you can search within specific collections. Links to each collection will be added to the library catalog and the databases list in July. You can also browse and access them from the Explorer platform. There are certain features that are only available when starting from a specific collection platform.\n\nNew Features!\n\nHandwritten Text Recognition\n\nText and Data Mining"
