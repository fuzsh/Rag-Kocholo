Using Google Advanced Search with specific search terms can help yield more focused results.\n\nWithin Google Advanced Search, use the “all of these words” and the “this exact word or phrase” to enter keywords for your subject, for example,\n\nall these words: Botanists\n\nany of these words: archives manuscripts correspondence diaries scrapbooks sources letters\n\nThis will yield a mixture of digitized full text and other material.\n\nAlso try:\n\nall these words: Botanists\n\nany of these words: \"digital archives\" \"digital collection\" \"digital library\" \"online collection\" \"primary sources\"\n\nAlso try:\n\nall these words: Botanists\n\nany of these words: \"oral history\" OR \"oral histories\" OR interviews\n\nAlso try:\n\nall these words: [Your topic words]\n\nany of these words: cdm contentdm\n\n\"Cdm\" or \"contentdm\" occur in the url of many digital collections\n\nFor any of these searches, use the “site or domain” box to search within just .edu, .org, or .gov sites.​​ List of country domain names.\n\nWorldCat (the OCLC Union Catalog)\n\nNumerous digitized collections of primary sources have records in WorldCat. These collections of primary sources are often swamped by ebooks on the same subject. There is no one perfect method for finding them, but the following may be tried for any topic. Always find the proper Subject terms for your topic and search using those as well as any keywords.\n\nBefore you search:\n\nUse Advanced search.\n\nRemove punctuation (: . ; -) and diacritics (change á to a) from your search terms.\n\nOpen Options in upper right.

For example, Vietnam War and American Foreign Policy, 1960-1975 (ProQuest History Vault) includes U.S. State Department Office of the Executive Secretariat Crisis Files. Part 1, the Berlin Crisis, 1957-1963\n\nSubscription databases are largely produced by only a few publishers, and often are digitizations of previously existing microfilm collections. The only general search method for these components of databases (including those not held by Harvard) is WorldCat. Numerous subcollections of primary source databases have records in WorldCat.\n\nMethods of searching WorldCat:\n\nAlways find the proper Subject terms for your topic and search using those as well as any keywords. Use Advanced search. Since you may be scrolling through numerous records to find the ones you want, open Options on the upper right and change Record list size from 10 to 100.

Part 1, the Berlin Crisis, 1957-1963 in the ProQuest History Vault, although the specific module, Vietnam and U S Foreign Policy, is not specified.\n\nSearching Subject: 'United States Foreign relations Gabon' yields: Despatches from U.S. consuls in Gaboon, 1856-1888 in Nineteenth Century Collections Online (Gale Cengage).\n\nSearching Keywords: \"Edward Sylvester Morse\" AND Keywords: \"Adam Matthew\" or Proquest or Gale or \"Alexander Street\" yields: Meiji Japan : the Edward Sylvester Morse collection from the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum by Adam Matthew.\n\nIt is often easiest to find microfilm collections on your topic and then search for the title in WorldCat, limiting to Internet Resource.
