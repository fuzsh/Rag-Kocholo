        "text": "Featured post from 2022 DLF Forum sponsor, Quartex by Adam Matthew Digital. Learn more about this year’s sponsors on the Forum website.\n\nAt this year’s DLF Forum, learn how you can deliver multiple initiatives with just one digital collections platform – Quartex, from primary source publisher Adam Matthew Digital.\n\nWe know return on investment often determines budget and resource allocation. One of the ways in which our flexible and scalable solution achieves this is by accommodating multiple projects, whether delivered in-house or through external collaborations.\n\nSyracuse University (SU) Libraries adopted Quartex with its core digital collections in mind but quickly realised it could achieve much more. In collaboration with its long term partner, the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF), the libraries created a separate digital collections site as a repository for the IVMF’s content. Hear from SU visiting librarian Grace Swinnerton at session M3: Developing Students’ Digital Scholarship Skills at this year’s DLF Forum.\n\nAnd SU isn’t stopping there. Neither are the Peabody Essex Museum, MA, or Harris County Public Library, TX. Both have built multiple collections sites using Quartex, for internal purposes or to showcase discrete collections of digitised content.\n\nIn doing so, these institutions have created efficiencies and engaged new audiences. More crucially, they’re delivering greater return on investment than they originally expected.\n\nVisit our team in-person at the DLF Forum to talk through your digital initiatives – you’ll find us at the Quartex booth in the Maryland Foyer. We look forward to sharing Quartex with you and answering your questions."
