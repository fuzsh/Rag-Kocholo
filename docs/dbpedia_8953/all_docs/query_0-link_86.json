        "text": "Algerian Dinar\n\nThe Algerian Dinar is the official currency of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria. It is represented by the symbol دج or DA and by the ISO code DZD. The currency is subdivided into 100 centimes and is issued by the Bank of Algeria. The banknotes issued ranges from 100 to 2000 Dinars and coins issued ranges from ¼ to 100 Dinars. The Algerian Dinar has an exchange rate of 1.5-1.8 Dinar for One Indian Rupee. Check the live rates of Algerian Dinar against the Indian Rupee here.\n\nAlgeria is a country in the Mediterranean coast of Northern Africa. It is the largest nation in Africa. The country has an economy based on the export of natural gases and petroleum products. This makes up a significant portion of the national GDP. Mining of minerals, fishing and agriculture are some of the other industries that are in growth. Apart from all of these, Algeria receives a large number of visitors every year. The presence of historical monuments and a rich cultural heritage has attracted a large number of tourists over time. Since the country has been a part of the long-lost Roman empire, many reminders of the glorious civilization lay throughout the nation. Hence tourism has a very large impact on the country’s economy. It has been a way of foreign income to Algeria. The USD is worth about 112-118 Algerian Dinar.\n\nAlgerian Dinar is a currency that holds no significant position in the domestic foreign exchange market of India. Not a lot of transactions are made in India to make the currency popular or demanding in India. The Indian Rupee is neither nor popular or demanding in Algeria. Hence the availability of the currency is practically nil in India and the Indian Rupee will not be accepted in Algeria for exchange. Hence it is better to convert the Indian Rupee to a more popular currency like USD or Euro. Convert INR to Euro from India and then you can convert Euros easily to Algerian Dinars on arrival in Algeria."
