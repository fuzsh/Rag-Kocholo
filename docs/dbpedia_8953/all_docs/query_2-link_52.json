        "text": "The Forex Metals Rates page contains cross-rates for different precious metals.\n\nThe Forex Metals Rates page is updated throughout the trading day with new price information, as indicated by a \"flash\" on the fields with new data. Forex prices are delayed 10 minutes, per exchange rules, and trade times are listed in CT.\n\nNote: Hours for a Forex trading day are 16:00 - 15:59 Central Time (CT).\n\nPage Sort\n\nPages are initially sorted in a specific order (depending on the data presented). You can re-sort the page by clicking on any of the column headings in the table.\n\nView Symbol More Data (+)\n\nUnique to Barchart.com, data tables contain an option that allows you to see more data for the symbol without leaving the page. Click the \"+\" icon in the first column (on the left) to view more data for the selected symbol. Scroll through widgets of the different content available for the symbol. Click on any of the widgets to go to the full page. The \"More Data\" widgets are also available from the Links column of the right side of the data table.\n\nFlipcharts\n\nAlso unique to Barchart, Flipcharts allow you to scroll through all the symbols on the table in a chart view. While viewing Flipcharts, you can apply a custom chart template, further customizing the way you can analyze the symbols. Flipcharts are a free tool available to Site Members.\n\nNote: Flipcharts, unlike the full-page chart or Dashboard, does not stream updated data to the chart."
