        "text": "Safety and security\n\nBorder areas\n\nBorder areas often see greater criminal activity and violence.\n\nAlgeria's security concerns are mainly due to regional instability. There is a heightened risk of kidnapping and terrorist attacks in rural, mountainous, border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Extremist groups take advantage of porous borders to carry out attacks. They operate human, drug and weapons trafficking in these areas, contributing to the overall threat.\n\nTerrorist groups and extremist militants are especially active along the borders with:\n\nMali\n\nNiger\n\nLibya\n\nTunisia\n\nMauritania\n\nThe border with Morocco has remained closed since 1994. Tensions are high in this region.\n\nAlthough counterterrorism operations should limit the ability of militants to carry out large-scale attacks, you should avoid all travel to border areas.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere’s a constant terrorist threat across North Africa. Reports of planned terrorist attacks occasionally emerge.\n\nIn recent years, the Algerian government has intensified its fight against terrorists. Counterterrorism operations significantly diminished the capacity of terrorist groups to operate in Algeria. However, militants remain in the country even if attacks are less common. They mainly target security forces, local government, and Western interests. Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and Tunisia contributes to the overall threat, particularly in border regions.\n\nDespite these efforts, terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:\n\ngovernment buildings, including schools\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nAlways be aware of your surroundings when in public places.\n\nBe particularly vigilant during the following:\n\nsporting events\n\nreligious holidays\n\npublic celebrations\n\nmajor political events, such as elections\n\nTerrorists could use such occasions to mount attacks.\n\nKidnapping\n\nThere’s a threat of kidnapping, mostly in remote, isolated and border areas.\n\nShould you plan to travel to remote areas despite the risks:\n\nbe vigilant at all times\n\nalways carry your cellphone and charger\n\nuse only major roads and highways\n\nvary your itineraries and schedules\n\nconsider hiring a reputable guide who knows the area well\n\nstay at hotels that have strong security measures\n\nDemonstrations and strikes\n\nDemonstrations may occur. Political, social and economic tensions caused civil unrest throughout the country in the past. Security forces are highly visible and may use tear gas or other tactics to disperse crowds.\n\nEven peaceful demonstrations can suddenly turn violent at any time. They can also lead to traffic and public transportation disruptions, causing road closures and delays.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nPolitical activism\n\nOver the past year, the Algerian government increased the number of arrests of activists, including some associated with the Hirak popular protest movement, which began in Algeria in February 2019.\n\nAlgerian authorities have also prevented dual Canadian-Algerian citizens from leaving Algeria after they were identified as politically engaged in Canada.\n\nParticipating in demonstrations or political activities, including on social media, may prevent you from leaving the country.\n\nExercise great care when interacting online, even when you are outside of Algeria.\n\nCrime\n\nThe crime rate is moderate in Algeria. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, especially in larger cities after dark. Armed robberies may also occur.\n\nEnsure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times\n\nBe aware of your surroundings\n\nKeep a low profile\n\nNever walk alone and avoid travelling after dark\n\nDon’t show signs of affluence\n\nCarry only small amounts of cash\n\nAvoid using your smartphone or camera in public\n\nDon’t resist if robbers threaten you\n\nIf you are travelling by car:\n\nkeep your windows closed and doors locked at all times\n\nif possible, travel in a convoy\n\nuse secure parking facilities\n\nnever leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk\n\nRomance scams\n\nInternet romance scams via dating websites or social media have occurred.\n\nIf you are travelling to Algeria to meet an online contact:\n\nkeep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam\n\nbe wary of people who profess friendship or romantic interest over the internet\n\nOverseas fraud\n\nWomen's safety\n\nWomen travelling alone may be subject to certain forms of harassment and verbal abuse.\n\nSexual harassment and assaults have occurred.\n\nTo avoid being the target of harassment, women should:\n\ndress conservatively\n\navoid walking alone\n\ntravel in groups\n\ntravel during daylight hours only\n\nsit in the back seat of taxis\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nAdventure tourism\n\nDesert expeditions or trekking can be dangerous, especially if they are not well organized. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly.\n\nIf you undertake desert expeditions:\n\nnever do so alone\n\nalways hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company\n\ntravel in a 4 x 4 vehicle\n\nbuy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation\n\nensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity\n\ndon’t venture off marked trails\n\nensure that you’re properly equipped and carry sufficient water supply\n\nknow the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke, both of which can be fatal\n\nstay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard\n\ninform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back\n\nobtain detailed information on the activity before setting out\n\nWater shortages\n\nWater shortages occur regularly, especially from April to October. This is mainly due to fast-growing demand affecting the provision of essential services. They may trigger demonstrations.\n\nKeep reserve supplies of water on hand.\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Accidents are common.\n\nRoad conditions\n\nRoad conditions have significantly improved in recent years. However, they can be poor outside of Algiers. In desert regions, rough roads require 4 x 4 vehicles.\n\nDriving can also be dangerous due to the following:\n\nnarrow, winding, and mountainous roads\n\nslippery roads and winter conditions in the northern part of the country\n\nsand-laden winds in the southern part of the country\n\nheavy traffic and congestion, especially in urban areas\n\npotholes and unpaved roads\n\npoorly maintained vehicles\n\nDriving habits\n\nDrivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless. Texting and driving is also a common practice.\n\nIf you plan on travelling by car in Algeria, you should consider renting a car with a hired driver rather than driving yourself. If you choose to drive:\n\nalways drive defensively\n\nplan your trip ahead of time, especially if you visit a rural area\n\navoid road travel at night\n\nuse only main roads and highways\n\navoid stopping in isolated areas\n\nkeep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times\n\nCheckpoints\n\nCheckpoints on roads heading into and out of larger cities and on roads throughout Algiers are common.\n\nDon’t go through checkpoints without stopping, even if they appear unattended.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nMetro\n\nThe Algiers metro is safe and reliable to use during daytime.\n\nBuses\n\nBuses are unreliable. They are rarely on time, especially during rush hours. Some public and private vehicles are poorly maintained. They are often the site of petty theft, armed robbery and sexual harassment incidents.\n\nDon’t use local or intercity public buses\n\nUse only reputable tour operators\n\nTaxis\n\nHotel-associated taxis are considered safe.\n\nThey generally only serve city centres. They may be limited in availability, particularly late at night and during peak hours.\n\nAvoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street\n\nIf using hotel taxis, request the service at the front desk\n\nWhen travelling by air, pre-arrange your pickup with your hotel before your arrival or use authorized airport taxis\n\nNote the driver's name on the picture identification badge, as well as the licence number\n\nNever share a taxi with strangers\n\nMake sure the driver doesn’t pick up other passengers along the way to your destination\n\nNegotiate the fare in advance\n\nHave small bills available for payment\n\nRidesharing apps\n\nMost vehicles used by these drivers are in poor condition.\n\nTravellers have also reported that vehicle information and drivers' name rarely match the information they receive when using some ridesharing apps in Algeria.\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nPolio: Advice for travellers - 3 July, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nPolio\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country.\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain.

Most travellers are at very low risk.\n\nTo protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nTravellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:\n\nvisiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation\n\nvisiting areas where outbreaks are occurring\n\nVaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nCutaneous and mucosal Leishmaniasis\n\nCutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis causes skin sores and ulcers. It is caused by a parasite spread through the bite of a female sandfly.\n\nRisk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from sandfly bites, which typically occur after sunset in rural and forested areas and in some urban centres. There is no vaccine or medication to protect against leishmaniasis.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nMedication\n\nSome prescription medications may not be available in Algeria.\n\nIf you take prescription medication, you are responsible for determining its legality in the country.\n\nBring sufficient quantities of your medication with you\n\nAlways keep your medication in the original container\n\nPack your medication in your carry-on luggage\n\nCarry a copy of your prescriptions\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nGood health care is available in major cities, mainly in the northern part of the country. Access to good health care may be difficult in the south due to a lack of specialized professionals.\n\nPublic clinics and hospitals may be overloaded. Public facilities may lack medical supplies and equipment. Doctors may not speak English.\n\nPrivate clinics and hospitals are better equipped. Services may be expensive, but they usually have sufficient qualified medical personnel speaking English well.\n\nDoctors and private hospitals usually expect immediate cash payment.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nPenalties for breaking the law in Algeria can be more severe than in Canada, even for similar offences.
