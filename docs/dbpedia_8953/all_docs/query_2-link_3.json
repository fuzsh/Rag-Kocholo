Although the Algerian dinar has coins in circulation, those worth under 5 dinars are rarely used anymore because prices are usually rounded to 5 dinars.\nThe current banknote set for the Algerian dinar is the fourth series and started in 1992. This series was issued due to inflation and introduced the 2,000 Algerian dinars while eliminating the 10, 20 and 50. The 100 banknote features the Battle of El Harrach and on the back is a sailing ship. The 200 dinar note is more peaceful in nature and features a classroom setting and on the reverse is the mosque Djemaa el-Djedid surrounded by olives. The 500 Algerian dinar note features the Numidian army and on the reverse is the tomb of Numid King Massinissa. The 1000 dinar note is based on cave animal paintings and has a water buffalo head on the front with rock pillars on the back. The latest note is the 2000 dinar and features a modern classroom setting, DNA model and a laboratory. The reverse of this note has modern buildings and flora from Algeria.",
