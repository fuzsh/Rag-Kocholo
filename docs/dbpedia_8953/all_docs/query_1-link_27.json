        "text": "Consensus Forecasts and Projections for the next ten years\n\nHow should you choose a forecaster if some are too optimistic while others are too pessimistic? FocusEconomics collects Algerian exchange rate projections for the next ten years from a panel of 6 analysts at the leading national, regional and global forecast institutions. These projections are then validated by our in-house team of economists and data analysts and averaged to provide one Consensus Forecast you can rely on for each indicator. By averaging all forecasts, upside and downside forecasting errors tend to cancel each other out, leading to the most reliable exchange rate forecast available for Algerian exchange rate.\n\nDownload one of our sample reports to visualize what a Consensus Forecast is and see our Algerian exchange rate projections.\n\nWant to get access to the full dataset of Algerian exchange rate forecasts?
