Centimes are now obsolete due to their extremely low value.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name \"dinar\" is ultimately derived from the Roman denarius.[2] The Arabic word santīm comes from the French \"centime\", since Algeria was under French occupation from 1830 to 1962.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe dinar was introduced on 1 April 1964, replacing the Algerian new franc at par.\n\nExchange rates\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official exchange rate set by the Bank of Algeria: Algerian Dinar to U.S. dollar is approximately 134 د.ج per 1 US dollar. The real exchange rate of the Algerian Dinar to U.S. dollar is approximately د.ج 220 per 1 US dollar on black market.[3]\n\nArgotic counting system\n\n[edit]\n\nThe masses rarely use the dinar as such, but the franc (officially the centime; one hundredth of a dinar) and the doro (one twentieth of a dinar). In traditional selling places such as the vegetable market or in the case of street vendors, prices are displayed in francs, in more modern shops the prices are displayed in dinars but the franc is used in speech.\n\nCoins\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1964, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes, and 1 dinar were introduced, with the 1, 2 and 5 centimes struck in aluminium, the 10, 20 and 50 centimes in aluminium bronze and the 1 dinar in cupro-nickel. The obverses showed the emblem of Algeria, while the reverses carried the values in Eastern Arabic numerals. In later decades, coins were issued sporadically with various commemorative subjects. However, the 1 and 2 centimes were not struck again, whilst the 5, 10 and 20 centimes were last struck in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1992, a new series of coins was introduced consisting of 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinars. A 200 dinar bi-metallic coin was issued in 2012 to commemorate Algeria's 50th anniversary of independence.[citation needed] The 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 dinar coins are bimetallic.\n\nCoins in general circulation are 5 dinars and higher. Following the massive inflation which accompanied the slow transition to a more capitalist economy during the late 1990s, the centime and fractional dinar coins have dropped out of general circulation, whilst the 1 and 2 dinar coins are rarely used, as prices are rounded to the nearest 5 dinars.[4] Nonetheless, prices are typically quoted in centimes in colloquial speech; thus a price of 100 dinars is read as \"ten thousand\" (عشر الاف).\n\n2 centimes, minted in 1964\n\n5 centimes, minted in 1974\n\n10 centimes, minted in 1984, a palm tree\n\n20 centimes, minted in 1972, an overflowing cornucopia depicting the theme of agricultural revolution\n\n20 centimes, minted in 1975, a ram(?)\n\n50 centimes, minted in 1975, \"The 30th remembering\" in Arabic and commemorating the French Algerian Clash\n\n1 dinar, minted in 1972, wheat, two hands (peace), and a tractor in foreground\n\n5 dinar, minted in 1972, Wheat and a petroleum-extractor in the background and commemorating the 10th anniversary of independence\n\n5 dinar, minted in 1974, an Algerian soldier and commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Revolution\n\n10 dinar, minted since 1979, \"Bank of Algeria\" in Arabic\n\nCurrent 20 and 50 dinar and obsolete 5 and 10 dinar coins\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe \"first series\" of dinar banknotes issued in 1964 consisted of banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 50 and 100 dinars.[5] In 1970, 500 dinar banknotes were added, followed by 1000 dinars in 1992.\n\nThird series[6] Image Value Main Colour Description Date of Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse printing issue 10 DA Green Diesel passenger train Mountain village 2 December 1983 20 DA Red Amphora and Arch Handcrafts and tower 2 January 1983 50 DA Green Shepherd with flock Farmers on a tractor 1 November 1977 100 DA Blue Village with minarets Man working with plants 1 November 1981\n\n8 June 1982\n\n200 DA Brown Place of the Martyrs, Algiers Administration Tower of Constantine 1 University, one of the various bridges of Constantine 23 March 1983 Fourth series[7] 100 DA Blue Charging Arab horse riders with sabres in a seal, and Algerian navy in a battle Pre-colonial invasion: Battle of El Harrach (1775) victory of the Algerian horseriders over the invading Spanish. 21 May 1992 1996 200 DA Reddish Brown Decorative Koranic motifs and symbols, mosque, olive and fig branches Period Islam Introduced: Traditional Koranic school and Kalam 500 DA Violet and pink Numidian Period: Battle on elephants between Numidians and invading Romans Romans fighting, a gasing in Tipaza, a hot waterfall in Hammam Debagh, Guelma Province (?) 21 May 1992\n\n10 June 1998\n\n1996\n\n2000\n\n500 DA Violet and pink Globe, Alcomsat-1 (Algeria's first communication's satellite) Satellite dishes, outline of Algeria, bridge 1 November 2018\n\n2018\n\n2018\n\n2018\n\n1000 DA Red and brown Prehistory of Algeria: A buffalo, paintings at Tassili n'Ajjer More paintings from the Tassili, and the Hoggar (?) 21 May 1992\n\n10 June 1998\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n1000 DA Blue and Red Grand mosque of Algiers Loom, teapot 1 December 2018\n\n2018\n\n2018\n\n2018\n\n2000 DA Purple and green University professor lecturing students in amphitheatre, satellite, double-helix DNA strand, three researchers in scientific laboratory with microscope and beakers Wheat, palm tree, body of water, urban high-rise buildings, olive tree 24 January 2011\n\n2011\n\n2011\n\n2011\n\n2000 DA Red, blue, and green The historical leaders of the Front de libération nationale (FLN) (Rabah Bitat (1925–2000), Mostefa Ben Boulaïd (1917–1956), Didouche Mourad (1927–1955), Mohammed Boudiaf (1919–1992), Krim Belkacem (1922–1970), and Larbi Ben M'Hidi (1923–1957)); Mountains Royal Mausoleum of Batna 5 July 2020\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2021\n\n2000 DA green Martyrs' Memorial, Algiers; map of Arab countries Tassili N'Ajjer National Park; Great Mosque of Algiers 2022 November 2022 For table standards, see the banknote specification table.\n\nThe 100 dinar note is being replaced by coins. 200, 500, and 1000 dinar notes are in circulation.
