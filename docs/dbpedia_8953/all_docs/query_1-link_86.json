        "meta_description": "Algeria - Oil, Gas, Agriculture: Algeria’s economy is dominated by its export trade in petroleum and natural gas, commodities that, despite fluctuations in world prices, annually contribute roughly one-third of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Until 1962 the economy was based largely on agriculture and complemented France’s economy. Since then the extraction and production of hydrocarbons have been the most important activity and have facilitated rapid industrialization. The Algerian government instituted a centrally planned economy within a state socialist system in the first two decades after independence, nationalizing major industries and implementing multiyear economic plans. However, since the early 1980s the focus has shifted",

        "text": "Agriculture, forestry, and fishing\n\nCultivated land is largely restricted to the coastal plains and valleys. These areas were colonized by French settlers, who established vineyards, orchards, citrus groves, and market gardens. The best farms were located in the well-watered fertile plains around Bejaïa and Annaba in the east, in the Mitidja Plain south of Algiers, and beyond Oran from Sidi Bel Abbès to Tlemcen. Rich vineyard areas were also maintained on the Médéa and Mascara plateaus.\n\nThe country’s aridity, however, renders more than four-fifths of the land uncultivable, and most of the remaining agricultural land is suitable only for pasture. The rest is tilled or devoted to vineyards and orchards. Winter grains—wheat, barley, and oats—are grown on the largest area of arable land in the drier High Plateau, notably around Constantine, and in the Sersou Plateau to the west. Also in the west, esparto grass grows naturally on the region’s steppe plains. Tobacco, olives, and dates are important crops, as are sorghum, millet, corn (maize), rye, and rice. The climate is not well suited to extensive stock raising, but there are many scattered herds of cattle, goats, and sheep, and stock raising contributes significantly to the traditional sector of agriculture.\n\nIrregular precipitation has long been a threat to agriculture, but dam construction and irrigation projects have added some stability to crop production. At independence Algeria possessed some 20 sizable dams. An active and ongoing construction program nearly doubled that number by the late 1980s, adding substantially to the country’s total irrigated acreage. Despite such efforts, the nation’s meagre water resources are under increasing pressure to meet its urban-industrial demands as well.\n\nSince independence agriculture has been the neglected sector of Algeria’s economy, suffering from underinvestment, poor organization, and successive restructuring; it now contributes less than one-tenth of GDP annually. As a result, cereal production has undergone large annual fluctuations, orchard and industrial crops have largely stagnated, and viticulture has declined markedly. Wine production, once the mainstay of colonial agriculture and exports, is now at only about one-tenth of its 1950s levels; because of Islam’s ban on alcohol consumption, viticulture is increasingly deemed culturally inappropriate. Wine exports to France have substantially declined, and most vineyards have been uprooted, with considerable loss of employment. Only market gardening and livestock production have shown significant growth. As a result, Algeria changed from a food-exporting nation in the 1950s to one that by the late 20th century had to import about three-fourths of its food needs.\n\nIn addition, the program to privatize former state farms since the 1980s caused legal wrangling over landownership. A substantial area of fertile agricultural land in and around Algiers and Oran has gone out of production because of the civil strife in the country that began in the early 1990s.\n\nAlgeria’s scant forests have relegated only minor importance to timber production in the country’s economy, although some cork from the cork oak forests in the higher elevations of the Tell Atlas is processed domestically. Forest area has decreased rapidly since the 1950s through logging operations, forest fires, and urban encroachment, adding to the country’s serious problem of soil erosion. However, the Algerian government aims at preserving and expanding the remaining woodlands."
