The Algerian Dinar (DZD) is the official currency of Algeria, a country in North Africa.

It is issued and managed by the Bank of Algeria, the countryâ€™s central bank.

The dinar is divided into 100 smaller units called centimes, but due to inflation, centime coins are no longer in circulation.

The Algerian Dinar was introduced in 1964, replacing the Algerian new franc at a rate of 1 dinar = 100 francs.

The current series of banknotes in circulation are in denominations of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 dinars.

Coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dinars.

The value of the Algerian Dinar has experienced fluctuations over time, affected by various factors such as political changes, economic conditions, and inflation.

The currency is not freely convertible, and foreign exchange transactions are tightly controlled by the Algerian government.
