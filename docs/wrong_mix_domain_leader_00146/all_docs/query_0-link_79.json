        "text": "Maggiemite\n\nAward: Wood Pencil\n\nWood Pencil / Art Direction / Art Direction for Press Advertising / 2014\n\nWe were asked to design an ad promoting a supplement on the life of Margaret Thatcher, the weekend after her death. Loved and loathed in equal measure, she was the first British politician since Winston Churchill to have a state funeral. But at the same time people all over the country held parties to celebrate her death. The ad plays on Marmite, the peculiar tasting British foodstuff, and its famous advertising line, ‘You’ll either love it, or hate it’, to allude to the polarising nature of the former Prime Minister’s reign."
