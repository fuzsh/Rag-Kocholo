        "text": "Photos: Margaret Thatcher through the years\n\nCNN —\n\nHere’s a look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1979 to 1990.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: October 13, 1925\n\nDeath date: April 8, 2013\n\nBirth place: Grantham, Lincolnshire, England\n\nBirth name: Margaret Hilda Roberts\n\nFather: Alfred Roberts, grocer\n\nMother: Beatrice Ethel (Stephenson) Roberts, grocer\n\nMarriage: Sir Denis Thatcher (December 13, 1951- June 26, 2003, his death)\n\nChildren: Mark and Carol (twins), August 15, 1953\n\nEducation: Somerville College at Oxford College, Chemistry, 1943-1947. Passed the bar, 1953\n\nOther Facts:\n\nThe first female prime minister of Great Britain.\n\nCalled the Iron Lady, for personal and political toughness.\n\nOnly British prime minister of the 20th century to win three consecutive terms. (Former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s first of three terms began in the 20th, but ended in the 21st.)\n\nDuring her time as prime minister, she emphasized the rights of the individual versus that of the state, moral absolutism and nationalism.\n\nIn her first term, Thatcher reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to business, a move that lead to a sharp rise in unemployment. By 1986, unemployment had reached 3 million.\n\nEnjoyed a close friendship and working relationship with President Ronald Reagan, with whom she shared similar conservative views.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1950 - Runs unsuccessfully for Parliament.\n\n1959 - Wins a seat in the House of Commons by winning the Conservative seat in Finchley, in north London.\n\n1961-1964 - Serves as a parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.\n\n1969-1970 - Serves as chief opposition spokesperson on education.\n\n1970-1974 - Secretary of State for education and science in the Conservative government of Edward Heath.\n\n1975 - Is elected leader of the Conservative Party.\n\n1976 - In a speech, she lashes out against Communism. This causes the Soviet press to nickname her the “Iron Lady.”\n\nMay 4, 1979 - Becomes prime minister after leading the Conservatives to electoral victory.\n\nApril 2, 1982 - Argentina invades the Falkland Islands.

The unpopular tax leads to rioting in the streets, and Thatcher’s ouster by Conservative Party politicians worried that the tax and Thatcher’s unpopularity would bring down the party.\n\nNovember 1990 - Is forced to resign as prime minister after a leadership struggle within her own party.\n\nMarch 7, 1991 - Receives the US Medal of Freedom from President George Bush.\n\nJune 5, 1992 - Is named a life peer on the Queen’s honor list.
