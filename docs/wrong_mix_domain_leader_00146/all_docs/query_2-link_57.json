The present burden of tax was one of the main factors hindering the growth of new employment opportunities. To widen the gap between the incomes of those in and out of work, to improve incentives for the lower-paid and to ease the poverty trap, a priority should be to raise substantially the starting point for income tax; in particular it would be essential in the next Budget to avoid again withholding “Rooker-Wise” increases in personal tax thresholds, but he was not proposing at this stage any further reductions in income tax. It was also necessary to reduce the burden on business, probably by a reduction in the National Insurance Surcharge. Tax reductions of this kind were a better way of stimulating real employment, and with better long-term consequences, than additional public expenditure. To bring inflation down well into single figures and to permit a fall interest rates over the medium term, it was necessary to keep the medium-term financial strategy, and progressively to reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n…\n\nDocument 2\n\nExtract from Cabinet Minutes, July 23rd, 1981. Catalogue Ref: CAB 128/72\n\nTranscript\n\n[…]\n\nb. The approach recommended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not offer a sufficiently imaginative and practicable response to the acute social and political problems now confronting the Government. A strategy centred on reductions of taxations and public expenditure would be irrelevant to the problems of Northern Ireland, or to those of Merseyside and other areas of urban dereliction and deprivation. Merseyside in particular was a community which was visibly falling apart, its hopelessness and despair compounded by the lack of commitment to the area of any of the wealth-creating institutions in the country. With unemployment totals rising to 3 million later in the year and following the recent rioting in a number of cities, the tolerance of society was now stretched near to its limit. To give people renewed hope and confidence for the future, it was essential to take new and constructive action urgently.\n\n[…]\n\nConnections to curriculum\n\nKey stage 5\n\nEdexcel A level History\n\nBritain in the Later 20th Century: 1945- 90: Consensus and Conflict .\n\nThe Conservative election victory of 1979: reasons for it and key features of the domestic policy of Thatcher governments; domestic achievements; reasons why the Thatcher era was controversial; reasons for her fall in 1990.\n\nOCR A level History\n\nBritain under Margaret Thatcher 1979–90 Focus: why there was a change in direction in post-war British politics under Thatcher, the extent of the ‘revolution’ in social, economic and foreign policy and why Thatcher fell from power.\n\nAQA A level History\n\nThe Making of Modern Britain, 1951–2007: the impact of Thatcherism, 1979–1987\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nHere are some blogs from The National Archives which relate to Margaret Thatcher’s in office in the 1980s:"
