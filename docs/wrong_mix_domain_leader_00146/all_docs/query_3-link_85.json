        "text": "Through the first three seasons of The Crown, Queen Elizabeth had no peers—no colleagues against which audiences could draw a fair comparison. But The Crown’s fourth season, which premieres November 15 on Netflix, delivers viewers a delicious foil for the monarch: her first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, played by Gillian Anderson. As series creator Peter Morgan explained to Vanity Fair, Thatcher is the perfect counterpoint to the queen.\n\n“When I found out that they were born only six months apart, that was a really big breakthrough for me,” said Morgan of the women—both of whom wielded tremendous power at a time when the world was not necessarily used to women being in charge. “They’re like twins who are not the same…. They’re both very resilient, very committed, work incredibly hard, have an extraordinary sense of duty. They’re both really committed to the country. They both have a strong Christian faith. They’re both girls of the war generation who switch the lights off when they leave a room. But then they had such different ideas about running the country.”\n\nThe role was a tricky one to cast—but in Gillian Anderson, who is dating Morgan in real life, The Crown found an actor who could channel Thatcher’s singular delivery and disposition, and could hold her own against the show’s anchor, Elizabeth, as played this season by Oscar-winning actor Olivia Colman. In anticipation of the new season, which is neatly framed by Thatcher’s time in office, Anderson spoke to Vanity Fair about Thatcher’s dysfunctional relationships with her daughter, the politician’s ability to annoy the queen, and the most dangerous aspect of portraying the late P.M.\n\nVanity Fair: What did your research entail—and what did you learn about the queen’s relationship with Thatcher that helped inform your performance?\n\nGillian Anderson: There’s a lot that’s written, as you can imagine, about the two of them and their relationship over those 11 years. One of the early things that I read was that, when Thatcher first showed up for her audiences with the queen, she came very early and would sit outside going through her notes and prepping herself. Eventually, I think the palace said, “You know, you can come later. You don't have to be here early.” I think that time of her being around, and in that proximity, maybe made the queen uncomfortable in some way.\n\nI think little details like that are really interesting. Apparently the queen was always confused as to why Thatcher sat so far forward, on the edge of her chair, when she was in an audience. Then there’s always how deep [Thatcher’s] curtsy was…Apparently nobody curtsied as deep as Margaret Thatcher. There’s a lot written about their differences and how much they didn’t get along—the fact that the royal family felt she was vulgar, and that a lot of her mannerisms were false in some way.\n\nOh, really?\n\nWell, she was a shopkeeper’s daughter, from a very different class system—not even remotely near the same status as aristocrats. She was a real, proper, self-made woman. She got a chemistry degree in Oxford, and she was a barrister before she was prime minister. The fact that you’ve got these two incredibly powerful women as duo heads of state is certainly an interesting dynamic.\n\nWhat did Peter tell you about your arc for the season?\n\nWell, I knew that episode one was going to be her coming in, and I knew that episode 10 was going to be her going out. What I didn’t really know is which bits of history, or which bits of Thatcher’s impact on Great Britain, specifically were going to be played through the prism of The Crown…. One thing that he’s particularly good at is turning the story on its head, so that you look at it from an angle that you would not necessarily expect. Or through a particular character that you wouldn’t expect you’d be looking at that story, or that part of history, through.\n\nWe see Thatcher and the queen get to a point of tenderness by episode 10. Do you believe their relationship softened as much as it does on the series?\n\nWell, it’s interesting how different people see that scene. Some people have said that they view the fact that Thatcher doesn’t say anything—not thank you, or even ma’am—that she curtsies, but she basically is speechless and then turns around…that that is not a snub, but is still expressing a tension that continues to lie between them. Some people see it as a great deal of intimacy and emotion that’s being held back, and if she were to say anything she might actually break. It’s interesting to see how different people react to that.\n\nWhat do you believe?\n\nI think she’s really moved by it. They did have a fractured relationship, and they did, at various times, I think, feel betrayed. They were very, very different women, even though they discuss what their similarities were…. Even though the medal was given quite some time later and we pulled it forward for the sake of the show, I think [Thatcher] would have been really proud, and feel a great deal of gratitude—almost like, from that point on, it was water under the bridge.\n\nI really enjoyed seeing the differences between the queen and Thatcher’s interior family relationship. What did you learn from your research about Thatcher’s marriage to businessman Denis Thatcher?\n\nHe was a great support for her and really, really cared about her, and was incredibly protective of her. But he also knew when to be in the background. The fact that he ran his own businesses and had a big life, yet was able to be in the background, particularly in that day and age, said a lot about him. You get the sense there was a great deal of tenderness between them.\n\nThere’s an episode that centers on the queen and Thatcher’s relationships with their children. Can you talk about Margaret as a mother—was she really more fond of her son than her daughter?\n\nApparently, she completely idolized Mark. I think, if I’m correct, there was some disappointment in Carol. But this is all just other people’s accounts of the situation. [Thatcher] had a very tricky relationship with her mom…she wrote about the fact that, from age 15, her brain was already moving a thousand miles an hour and she was so enamored of her father. He was an older man, and she would go and listen to him speak. She felt that, kind of from the age of 15 on, there was nothing really to talk to her mom about anymore.\n\nI think she really was disappointed in her mom, and it’s almost like she carried that a little bit into her relationship with Carol. She only had eyes for her father. But really, her real first love was politics, and I think she knew that of herself very early on.\n\nOh, my God, there’s a story about a function that was meant to happen in Number 10. People had been baking, and there were muffins or something that had been baked that one of the secretaries had dropped in the hall. Apparently Thatcher helped put them back on the tray and said, “That’s okay, Carol will eat them in the flat.”…[Laughs] Maybe it was only Carol that was in a flat, but they’d just been on the floor. At one point she had Carol hide in the cupboard because she was wearing jeans and she didn’t want anybody to see her wearing jeans. Stories like that…their relationship sounded complicated.\n\nDo you think it was her relationship with her mother mirrored down to her daughter?\n\nPossibly. She was quite ambivalent about people in general, I think. She loved the attention of men—she knew how to work a room, she knew how to flirt in her own way…. The fact is, in the 11 years that she was prime minister, she invited only one other woman to join the cabinet. I think that probably has more to do with her, given how close her relationship was with her father and how much she emulated him.\n\nShe had such a singular way of speaking and holding herself. How long did it take for you to fine-tune that?\n\nAwhile. I knew about a year prior to filming that I was going to do it—starting at home, working with a voice coach, and trying to figure out the right tone so it wasn’t getting into parody, of which there’s been so much. It’s really easy to go quite monotone with her, which you also don’t want to do because she had quite a lot of notes in her voice. But grounding it without it being too shriek-y took a while to get right. It also took a while to release it out of me. I was quite shy at the beginning before I had perfected it enough to let anyone else hear it. There was a point where people were like, “Where is she? It’s time… let her out. We’re all waiting.”\n\nIt seems like a brave choice to take on a character so singular and divisive. Did it feel dangerous?\n\nI mean, yes and no. At the end of the day, I needed to just decide that I was going to put all preconceptions and opinions to the side—of who she is, how she is represented in the show, [and] how they think I have portrayed her. At the end of the day, as an actor, this isn’t a biopic on Thatcher. This is a slice of a prime minister through the prism of The Crown.\n\nWhether you agree with my portrayal or not, I’m not sure I could have tried any harder. As long as I feel that, then it doesn’t really matter whether people think that I succeed or not. I have no control over that, and they could feel very strongly that I didn’t. That’s the only bit of danger, more than anything, is what I make of that…. But one has to say yes to things that are terrifying, because otherwise, you’ll just live in a world of regret, which is not healthy.\n\nWhere to Watch The Crown:\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
