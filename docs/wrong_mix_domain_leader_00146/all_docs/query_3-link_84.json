        "text": "Introduction\n\n4This article begins by reviewing briefly the early ambiguities of Thatcher’s positions on Europe. It then examines the role Thatcher and her ally Lord Cockfield played in the creation of the Single Market, and how she quickly responded to the mounting integrationist ambitions of the Delors Commission. The article goes on to examine the fiasco of Britain’s ERM membership and its legacies. It then analyses how Britain shifted away from Europe’s social model under Margaret Thatcher, drawing on the “varieties of capitalism” literature, and ends by examining the inherent contradiction between the Conservatives’ drive to reduce the size of government while pursuing globalisation.\n\nBritain’s complicated path to the Single Market project\n\nFrom the “Thatcherisation of Europe” to the Bruges Speech\n\n9With the budget issue settled, a more constructive chapter opened up in Britain’s relations with the EEC, with Britain being fully engaged in the development of the Single Market. Its aim was to open up fully Europe’s national economies, notably by bringing down non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade in goods and especially services. These included national public procurement policies by public sectors; idiosyncratic health and safety regulations; regulations limiting access to professions by nationals, etc. By adopting the principle of “mutual recognition”, the Single Market project made such NTBs obsolete as products deemed acceptable in one country must be recognised by all other Member States (in areas where harmonised European standards do not exist). It is this principle which today, for instance, gives financial institutions (including foreign entities) established in the UK their “passporting rights” to sell services throughout the European Union, as they are regulated by the UK authorities. On leaving the EU, such foreign and British-owned institutions will lose these rights.\n\n10The creation of the Single Market was based on the implementation of nearly 300 European Directives to remove impediments to cross-border business. This is a process which is still going on in some public services: for example, France is set to open up rail services to private, and potentially foreign, operators as of 2021. More generally, the Single Market project established the four freedoms of the movement of goods, services, capital and people. These freedoms lie at the heart of Britain’s Brexit predicament as the referendum in 2016 was much about controlling immigration, while having continued access to the Single Market is supported by many businesses.\n\n16The ambiguities of Mrs Thatcher’s position – and more generally the dilemma of the UK since the signing of the SEA – could not be starker. On the one hand, she and her allies welcomed the market liberalisation of the Single Market. On the other hand, they were deaf to the integrationist aspirations Jacques Delors and other European politicians and in many ways to the ambition of European project from the outset. From a political economy point of view there is also a major contradiction here. Thatcher, today’s Eurosceptics and arguably neoliberals more generally fail to acknowledge sufficiently that markets need laws and government to function. The creation of the Single Market has necessarily led to the deepening of European law to allow it to operate, and this has consolidated the primacy of EU law over national law. Moving forward to Brexit, there already is inevitably today, for example, a tug-of-war between the UK and the EU over which court(s) will have the final say over future economic relations between both parties.\n\nBritain’s ERM debacle and the surge of Euroscepticism\n\n17Margaret Thatcher was also a key player in the next major episode of the emergence of British Euroscepticism. After a decade of putting off ERM membership until the “time [was] right”, she oversaw entry of the pound into the ERM during the last days of her premiership. This strategic policy decision was based on two sets of economic and political considerations. But, it turned out to be a spectacular comedy of errors in Britain’s relationship with the European Union.\n\n19The economic case for joining the ERM was then backed up by the dramatic changes in global politics. In November 1989 the Berlin Wall came down fairly unexpectedly, following political changes in the Soviet Union since the middle of the 1980s and massive demonstrations in East Germany during the summer that year. In quick succession, the countries of Eastern Europe went though mainly peaceful revolutions, casting out previous, Soviet-backed regimes, while Germany itself was reunited on 3 October 1990. Germany’s (West) European partners had little choice but to go along with this, though many like Thatcher and François Mitterrand had reservations about a larger, united Germany re-emerging. In exchange for their acceptance of reunification, the German government led by Helmut Kohl signed up emphatically to economic and monetary union and hence relinquishing the Deutschmark, the economic and political cornerstone of Germany’s post-War reconstruction.\n\n21In Britain, the housing market crashed, output slumped and unemployment again rose above 3 million. This second deep recession under the Tories did finally wring inflation out of the economy, abetted by a decade of anti-union legislation and major industrial disputes which much weakened the ability of Britain’s workers to fight for pay. Although the Conservatives under John Major were re-elected for a fourth time in April 1992, they found themselves under increasing political and financial market pressure to improve the economy. Some attempts were made to lower interest rates slightly. However, during the summer and especially from August 1992 onwards, financial markets began betting against the pound (and Italian lira) and their governments’ ability to maintain ERM parities. Events came to a head on “Black Wednesday”, 16 September, when Chancellor Norman Lamont announced the government was suspending the pound’s membership of the ERM: dramatic efforts that day to buy sterling, while hiking interest rates first to 12% and then 15% had failed to stem market selling of the pound. The Italian government made the same move two days later.\n\nBritain’s “variety of capitalism” setting it apart from Europe\n\n26To examine Britain’s specific trajectory, I draw on key texts of the “varieties of capitalism” literature, which identified different types of capitalism in old industrialised countries, in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall. The ensuing typologies are now dated, not covering the development of China. Yet they remain relevant to examining how countries in “the West” evolved in response to the stagflation of the 1970s, and how the Conservatives set the UK on a different path to its European partners. Indeed, in today’s world, it is difficult to recall that Britain had been a pioneer of European social democracy after 1945, or that the Conservatives and then Labour tried to emulate French indicative planning in the UK during the 1960s. It is hard to remember that top income tax rates in the UK (and the United States!) were considerably higher than in France and Germany through to the end of the 1970s, and that levels of income inequality were very similar in all these countries.\n\n30Taking these various analyses together, it becomes clear that the UK has distanced itself from its European partners in several ways. The market deregulations and privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s, including that of financial markets, have strengthened the contractual nature of the British economy, and have consolidated the use of capital markets by companies. Similarly, the Conservatives under Thatcher implemented successive reforms to welfare policy to keep control on spending and to increase the gap between paid work and welfare transfers. Britain therefore passed from having a more social democratic welfare state to being more in line with the liberal one, providing minimal welfare benefits. Tellingly, the Major government negotiated an opt-out from the EU’s Social Protocol, of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. This was obtained to maintain the UK’s more deregulated labour market: a particular bone of contention at the time was the EU’s Working Time Directive limiting the working week to 48 hours, which the government was very keen to avoid. Major also opposed implementing a minimum wage, another policy set out in the Social Protocol.\n\n31It was only when New Labour came to power in 1997 that the UK finally signed up to the Social Protocol. However, in one area Britain under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown continued a key policy shift by Thatcher, which still sets Britain apart quite strongly from many other European countries. This concerns the role of unions as interlocutors in companies, industries and nationally. When Thatcher came to office, she ended what the British used to refer to (quaintly and pejoratively) as “beer and sandwiches in Downing Street”, when union leaders were consulted on government policy. New Labour’s policy was to keep out the unions, to keep social dialogue to a minimum, and to perpetuate Thatcher’s dismantling of collective bargaining.\n\nPotential flaws in the “Global Britain” project\n\n34Dani Rodrik also returns to an economic study by a political scientist at Yale University named David Cameron [sic] into examining why public spending rises over time. In looking at various institutional and political factors, such as the political business cycle, the influence of pressure groups on politicians. Cameron found that the single most important cause for higher public spending was the exposure of an economy to international trade. He argues this occurs because governments, in response to institutional pressure from voters and unions, pursue numerous policies to protect their populations from the adverse consquences of trade openness. Though Cameron’s work was published in the late 1970s, Rodrik’s own research reaches the same conclusions.\n\n36Applying these analyses by Rodrik to the Thatcherite agenda sheds light on the contradictions of supporting the creation of the Single Market while simultaneously seeking to maintain national sovereignty and democracy. Conversely, Brexit vote clearly stands out as a rejection of European integration, and is much defended by Brexiteers as an expression of democracy. Whether root-and-branch change of Britain’s economic and political system based on a 52 percent majority of a 72 percent turnout is actually democratic may be debated. But the Conservative Brexiteer project of finishing the Thatcher revolution by further strengthening market forces as part of a Global Britain strategy carries its own risks of aggravating income and wealth inequalities and undermining the kind of democracy usually associated with a more inclusive society.\n\nConclusion\n\n37Many of the profound difficulties the UK currently has over Brexit may be traced back to the Thatcher era. Britain has always been ambivalent about the European project, showing a strong degree of path dependency in favouring economic ties yet almost consistently rejecting institutional and political integration. Margaret Thatcher’s support for the creation of the European Single Market as a form of trade liberalisation greatly compounded this ambivalence. By definition, the opening up and economic integration of Europe’s national economies set out in the Single Market programme necessarily called for more EU legislation and law (interpreted by the European Court of Justice). The Single Market Act also explicitly called for more monetary cooperation. Greater integration was clearly the goal of Jacques Delors and others, building on the original call by the Treaty of Rome for “ever closer union among the peoples of Europe”. Furthermore, Thatcher played a key role in Britain joining the ERM, while her defenestration by Conservative MPs and the subsequent ejection of the pound from the ERM in 1992 lit the flame of Euroscepticism.\n\n38Margaret Thatcher’s policy legacy also pushed Britain further down the road of neoliberalism than its European partners. It arguably created the economic basis for Brexit, and so-called hard Brexiteers are seeking to pursue the neoliberal agenda further, with tax cuts, market deregulation and tariff reduction. Such an overall strategy will likely expose certain industries and farming in the UK to severe losses. This will surely aggravate Britain’s social inequalities further, with potentially significant political consequences."
