After that, schools must test 25 percent of students and staff per week.\n\nHowever, Solvay schools will not have to meet orange zone testing because the part of Solvay added to the orange zone does not include the areas where Solvay Elementary and Solvay High School sit, according to the map.\n\nMORE:\n\nCounty leaders are asking the state to relax the testing rules in the orange zone, but have so far not been granted any exceptions.\n\nAdditionally, on Monday, which brings more schools under a rule to test 20 percent of its students and staff to remain open for in-person learning.\n\nIn both the orange and yellow zones, schools can \"test out\" of the weekly requirement by showing that their schools have lower infection rates than the rest of the zone in which they lie after two weeks of testing.\n\nOnondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon said several yellow zone schools had already met this requirement and \"graduated out\" of more weekly testing. Those schools are Liverpool, parts of North Syracuse schools (although more were added in with the expansion of the yellow zone), Baldwinsville and East Syracuse-Minoa.\n\nSchool districts that must now test students in the newly expanded yellow zone are Fayetteville-Manlius, North Syracuse, Jamesville-DeWitt, West Genesee, Westhill and a number of Catholic and private schools.\n\nOrange Zone Schools\n\nSyracuse City School District\n\nBellevue Elementary\n\nBrighton Academy Syracuse\n\nClary Middle School\n\nCorcoran High School\n\nDelaware Primary\n\nDr. Weeks Elementary\n\nEdward Smith Schoo\n\nElmcrest School\n\nExpeditionary Learning Middle\n\nFranklin Elementary School\n\nFrazer PK-8 School\n\nGrant Middle School\n\nH.W.
