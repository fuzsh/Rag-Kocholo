        "text": "Address: 6653 Kirkville Road, East Syracuse, NY 13057\n\nDistrict: Private\n\nSchool Web site\n\nPrincipal: Sister James Therese Downey\n\nGrade Levels: 7-12\n\nContact numbers\n\nMain Office 437-0356\n\nNurse 463-8917\n\nAttendance 463-8917\n\nGuidance 463-8133\n\nAthletics 463-0990\n\nDevelopment 431-0610\n\nStudent population: 515\n\nSpecialized classes\n\nPhotoshop, Ceramics, Broadcasting, Computer Science and Technology, French, Italian, Latin,\n\nSpanish.\n\nReligious affiliation: Roman Catholic\n\nTuition\n\nAffiliated Rates: / Grades 7-8 / Grades 9-12\n\nFirst Child / $4,225 / $5,270\n\nSecond Child / $4,015 / $5,000\n\nThird Child / $3,800 / $4,468\n\nNon Affiliated Rates\n\nEach Child / $5,025 / $6,145\n\nDress code: Yes\n\nNote: All students must take one religious course for each of their four years. The courses are, in order, Introduction to Scripture, Morality, Faith, and Christian Social Justice.\n\nView Larger Map\n\nA Top 50 Catholic School\n\nIn 2005, Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School received an honorable distinction that one can't help but notice upon entering the building. Placed above the front entrance of the school, a sign displayed in Bishop Grimes' blue and white makes its presence known: \"You are now entering one of the top 50 Catholic Schools in the nation.\"\n\nMention this fact to principal Sister James Therese Downey and a smile lights up her face. Since 1966, Bishop Grimes has prided itself on providing a quality education for its students and delivering the message of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nGetting Involved\n\nIn addition to a structured religious sequence, Bishop Grimes offers seven different Advanced Placement classes. It also has an initiative with Le Moyne College called The Le Moyne Scholars Institute, which allows approximately 25 students to take classes for college credit, Downey said. The program requires students to complete one course in the fall and one in the spring.\n\nDowney cited a strong student council as the premium driver of student activity. In charge of events such as pep rallies and spirit week, the student council gives kids a chance to participate in the school and community. Downey described \"faith\" groups as another popular extracurricular for students who are active with youth parishes.\n\nDo I need to be Catholic to attend?\n\nPrevious religious instruction is not required to attend, but most incoming students have been raised in the Catholic school system. Bishop Grimes maintains relationships with the private elementary schools in the area through Catholic school nights at athletic events and \"Cobra Camp\" during the summer for young athletes.\n\nAll about sports\n\nParticipation in athletics at Bishop Grimes is high, and a new gymnasium was opened on May 28, 2008 to enable more practice space and ease the crowded courts and fields. The gym was dedicated in memory of the parents of former Bishop Grimes principal, Monsignor George Sheehan. With the construction of the gym the focal point of a capital campaign that began in 2004, its completion was gainful for more than one party.\n\n\"It's a benefit for our athletes obviously because now we can run simultaneous practices and games,\" Downey said. \"But we also have the benefit to the music department, so it frees up a lot of room on the stage that's shared with the gym.\"\n\nAbout 250-300 people attended the dedication of the new facility, Downey said, a sign of a supportive community and strong alumni base, which often consists of current teachers at the school and parents of students.\n\nAdventures Overseas\n\nEvery year, the foreign language department takes its students to countries where the language they are studying is spoken. The Italian classes go to Italy, the native country of one Italian teacher at Bishop Grimes. Typically, the class marvels at the Vatican in Rome, with Florence, Assisi, Venice and Amalfi having been other stops on the trip. The French class has traveled to French-speaking Canada and will embark on a trip to France in spring 2009.\n\nPrincipal Profile: Sister James Therese Downey\n\nSister James Therese Downey has been at Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School for 16 years. Beginning as a math teacher at the school, Downey has progressed to become an assistant principal and currently holds the principal position, a seat she has been in for three years. When describing her typical Bishop Grimes student and what she envisions them to be, Downey points to the hallways of her school.\n\n\"Take a look at any one of them,\" Downey said, referrring to the satisfaction she has with the current student body.\n\nFor Downey, it is important that her students walk away from Bishop Grimes with a strong knowledge of their faith that they can take with them beyond college into their adult lives. It's something that she did herself, advancing as a student through the Catholic school system.\n\nGrowing up in Fairmount, Downey attended Holy Family elementary school and Bishop Ludden High School. She graduated from The College of Saint Rose in Albany in 1978. Downey is proud of the distinction that Bishop Grimes achieved in 2005, being named a Top 50 Catholic school in the country, but never expected herself to be in the seat she sits in today.\n\n\"I never really envisioned being principal,\" Downey said. \"But I always wanted to be a teacher and always wanted to be in education.\""
