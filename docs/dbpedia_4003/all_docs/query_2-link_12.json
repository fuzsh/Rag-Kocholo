For instance, here are some homes under $250,000 in the J-D school district: https://www.cnyrealtor.com/index.php...esville-Dewitt)\n\nAs you can see, you would have to keep property taxes in mind and most do not have \"walkable infrastructure\", though they may be within a short or reasonable walk to a grocery store and other shopping around/near Nottingham and Tecumseh Roads/East Colvin Street.\n\nHowever, many are also not too far from this business district on the Eastside of the city: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0411...7i13312!8i6656\n\nArea with some shopping near some of the listings: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0282...7i13312!8i6656\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@43.0221...7i13312!8i6656\n\nThis golf course and tennis club is in that area: Home\n\nAnother nearby golf course: Tecumseh Golf Club\n\nThe elementary school for that area: Jamesville DeWitt School District\n\nThis Syracuse city park is nearby as well: Barry Park | Syracuse Parks\n\nAlso, the Syracuse University campus isn't too far away either.\n\nSome Syracuse homes in that price range: https://www.cnyrealtor.com/index.php...me.eq.Syracuse)\n\nFor Onondaga County: https://www.cnyrealtor.com/index.php...ry.eq.Onondaga)\n\nA wild card area just inside of Madison county east of Syracuse: https://www.cnyrealtor.com/index.php...e.eq.Cazenovia)\n\nVillage of Cazenovia\n\nWelcome to the GCACC Website! - Cazenovia Chamber of Commerce\n\nTown Of Cazenovia: Homepage: [Digital Towpath]\n\nWelcome to Cazenovia College | Cazenovia College\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@42.9298...7i13312!8i6656\n\nhttps://www.schedulegalaxy.com/schools/21/teams/6238\n\nCazenovia CSD\n\nWell, we'd probably rent for a short time 6-12 mos to get a feel for the area and really see what the options are. I've looked a bit at apartment finder to see what the rental market is like. I've looked at Zillow to check on houses and get a feel for the market from a distance.\n\nThat being said, we'd need to sell our home first before sinking our teeth into the market there. This is all hypothetical since a lot of steps need to occur first such as formally accepting a job offer.\n\nThis isn't my first rodeo, as I have been in these situations before having flown out for a n interview and the whole thing falls apart or the offer isn't what was expected etc.\n\nYes, taxes have been a thought, but Minnesota is a relatively high-taxed state too. I reviewed some property taxes and found that they were not shocking comparatively to Westchester or Connecticut other places I considered last year until I saw the property taxes on an average home in those places, Yikes!\n\ntruth about the case\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Glasgow17\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nI have been recruited by an organization that has a location in Syracuse, and I will be flying out there next week to have a formal interview and meet the team. I have all been offered the position as the Regional Director said we would negotiate salary etc. next week.\n\nSo, Syracuse was not on my radar as the job I originally interviewed for was in New England but through the process basically have landed this position which is a solid job managing a health clinic.\n\nI am married in my early 40's and have two kids 5 and under. We live in Minnesota (great lakes area by Duluth) so I am not worried about snow (we routinely get 90 inches of snow here) or winter in general or cold as most places are warmer, lol.\n\nI know next to nothing about Syracuse and Central NY. It looks nice in pictures and the Finger Lakes area seems like a playground, but most places put there best foot forward in publications/online.\n\nAny ideas on schools for kiddos? How is the medical care or health systems in the area? Transportation options? (We have two vehicles but if we could get down to one, that would be ideal).\n\nPros/Cons in living in or around Syracuse or any advice?\n\nReply:\n\nWhere are the other locations for this organization? If at all possible, SERIOUSLY CONSIDER one of the other locations. I moved to this area a couple of years ago and cannot wait to get out. It is that bad. First off, forget New York State in general. New York has the highest tax burden in the country. Also, New York has the finest welfare benefits in the fifty states and that is reflected in the Syracuse area.\n\nReal estate here is relatively affordable compared to other places; but again, the property taxes will kill you. Property values increase extremely slow so be prepared to be here for awhile if you want to make money on a sale. Your National Grid bills during the winter months will be outrageous. The schools in some areas here are good; but the quality can be found in areas out of state as well.\n\nWinters are absolutely brutal. Syracuse gets a ton of snow. It can snow as late as April, and did just that last year. Sidewalks are never shoveled. Roads are poorly taken care of. Not plowed well in the winter months and full of huge potholes once the snow and ice disappear. Water main breaks are a common occurrence in the city. One other major point; make sure that the color gray is one of your favorite. Because that is the color of the sky 300 days out of the year. This area gets VERY little sunshine. It is filthy. Garbage all over the highways and roads. Snow that is brown.\n\nLocal government is inept, stupid and not at all progressive. Nepotism and double dipping abound. The current debate encompasses Interstate 81. I won't even go there. I don't care. I won't be here.\n\nIn general, it is difficult to find good employment. Companies will want a candidate to have a four year degree; but, will pay $15 an hour (or less). Finally, people here are MISERABLE. I have been in many places, and in this category, Syracuse wins hands down.\n\nTo summarize, Syracuse is an ugly ugly ugly place.\n\nHowever, I cannot end without giving a positive. That would be Wegmans.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by seeingred22\n\nNo, actually I didn't join just to post that. Born and raised here, I see. Everyone else stop posting. There is only one opinion that counts. LOL\n\nNah, but knowing C-D, you get a lot of hit and run posting with one sided info or rehashed threads/topics that will bring about the same/similar replies as well. Sometimes though, you may need “dueling posters”, for lack of a better term, in order to see the balance in an area though or a lot of those things could apply in some degree for a lot or most cities.\n\nWith this said, I don’t think that the OP is stuck on just the city and even then, there is a range of neighborhoods like any other city. Keep in mind that he/she would also have what appears to be a good job lined up if all things work out or fit what they are looking for.\n\nLast edited by ckhthankgod; 01-18-2018 at 04:57 AM..\n\nHi everyone, thanks for the pros and cons about Syracuse. I had my interview and it went well. I have two more rounds I discovered are in the process that I am being moved forward to lol. So we will see!\n\nInitial thoughts on Syracuse are positive. The neighborhoods I had time to peruse were Sedgwick and Eastwood only as the Lyft driver took me through on my request. They were ok, Eastwood seems a bit in transformation? Looked run down in parts but also with renovated and newer buildings.\n\nThe driver said Eastwood was to be avoided as a bank had been robbed? He said heroin is a massive problem or opioid addiction...and all Syracuse schools are awful.\n\nI think he was depressed...\n\nArmory Square is Nice along with Clinton Square. I didn't gave time to check anytjing else out unfortunately. I would've liked to have see the University District, Liverpool or smaller towns around Syracuse too."
