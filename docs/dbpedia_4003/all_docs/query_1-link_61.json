        "text": "My name is Jonathan Corl and I'm a headed into my junior year at Bishop Grimes High School. Currently, I'm 6'3 and weigh 180 pounds. This past season I was on my school's varsity basketball team and I averaged 10 points, 11 rebounds during the shortned season. Also, I made the OHSL Liberty Central all-star second team. I am a \"team first\" player and I will do anything for my teammates before myself. Coaches have told me that I am very coachable and motivated. I will always push myself to keep working to achieve more. Every opportunity I get I go to the gym or find a court so I can work on my game. Academically, I take the most advanced courses that are offered to me. I study really hard to keep a high GPA. My family is very supportive of me and they help me reach my goals. I want to attend a college where I can challenge myself both on and off the court. I am open to all options and I hope to find the college that is the best fit for me."
