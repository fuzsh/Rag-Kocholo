        "text": "Bishop Grimes Jr. /Sr. High School in East Syracuse will provide daily round-trip bus transportation from Oswego and Fulton for students of all grade levels beginning in September.\n\nThe announcement “comes after growing interest in a Catholic education at Bishop Grimes among families in Oswego County,” the diocese said in a press release. Bus transportation will be offered free of charge, and the bus will be exclusively for Bishop Grimes students living in the Northern region, it said.\n\n“We are thrilled to let you know about this major new development,” Hank Fust, Chairman of the Board at Bishop Grimes, said in the release. “Transportation has always been a key concern, until now.”"
