        "text": "Our Vision at Bishop Grimes\n\nWhile we embrace our Catholic identity, Bishop Grimes welcomes students and families from diverse cultural and faith backgrounds into our community. We believe that the cultural richness of our population, in concert with the Catholic values at the heart of our mission, our rigorous academic programs, our supportive atmosphere, and our vast extracurricular offerings and service learning opportunities contribute immeasurably toward preparing our students for fulfilling, successful, and healthy academic, personal, professional, and spiritual lives. We want our Bishop Grimes graduates to leave ready to meet the world today.\n\nBG Diversity"
