You may have met your admission counselor at your high school, a college fair or at an event in your area.\n\nDon’t hesitate to call or email them – they’re a great resource to help you through this exciting time. Here are some of their favorite things about Le Moyne and the Syracuse area:\n\n“There’s a real duty here to take care of each other and lift up our community, and you definitely won’t find that at every institution.”\n\n“Syracuse and Central New York have such an amazing and unique food scene.”\n\n“Syracuse has its own charm, and there’s always something for the seeker.”\n\n“There’s no better college community to be a part of – the genuine care for students is second to none.”\n\n“Syracuse is a great college town – it is big enough to offer anything you need (an airport, shopping, dining, businesses, etc.) but small enough that people are friendly, and it is affordable (which is helpful for students!)”\n\nDon’t remember who you talked with? Each counselor’s territory is noted below next to their name. And remember, you can always reach out to the admission office at admission@lemoyne.edu.\n\nGet to Know Our Admission Counselors"
