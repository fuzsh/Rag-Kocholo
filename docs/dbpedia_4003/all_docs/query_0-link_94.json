        "text": "Harry M. Barrett received the A.B. Degree at Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania, in 1891. He received other degrees including the Doctor of Letters from the University of Denver. In 1893 he came to Colorado, and taught Latin in East High School. An editorial experience in Erie, Pennsylvania, during those two years had prepared him, no doubt, to be interested in the same sort of work here; and, together with a little reportorial work, for years he had much to do with the Colorado School journal, both has advisor and as editor.\n\nIn 1907, I believe, he left East High School to become principle of Central High School in Pueblo Colorado. 5 years later, in 1912, he returned it to Denver as principal of East High School, and remained there during the troublesome days of the war of 1914 to 1918. In 1920, he went to Boulder Colorado. There he remained In charge of the College of Education until 1937. During the two or three years before his retirement he endured much physical and mental suffering, which almost killed him. A year or more of travel, apparently gave him back his health; and he remained fairly well until the Nazis rolled through Holland. 3 days later, he was dead. Had he lived a few weeks longer, he would have received one more degree, the PhD from his alma mater. At least, he had the comfort of knowing that last Monday, that this honor would be his.\n\nSuch is the brief outline of the life of a man who made himself a quiet force in everything educational in one state, and in many of its religious movements; who was known and respected as highly in Greeley and Fort Collins and Gunnison as in Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Boulder, and Denver.\n\nMy acquaintance with Barrett began in January of 1896. During that winter, his doctor said he had appendicitis. Accordingly, he remained in bed for a week, and I took his classes in Latin. I remember that they knew their Latin, perhaps better than I, myself, at that time. From that time on I knew Harry Barrett as a man as well as anyone ever knew him, I guess, unless it were Aaron Gove, and Dorus Ruben Hatch. Barrett loved to sing; and for a while he and two other men and I formed a quartet for mutual pleasure mostly. When he brought his wife to Denver in 1896 and thereafter when the children came, we were drawn together through somewhat similar interests.\n\nDuring the war he lost his older son at Fort Logan. I truly believe the anguish caused by that loss, and the repression of his grief at that time contributed to the weakness of heart which took him off 20 odd years later. He was intensely patriotic, and in his desire to appear all that the leader of so many young men and women should appear in a national emergency, he denied himself the legitimate relief of sorrow acknowledged and expressed. Perhaps, too, the memory of those days of terrible sadness came back and overwhelmed him, when Holland was snuffed out.\n\nHe joined the school masters Club in 1895. He was not, therefore, a charter remember, for the club had been in existence nearly a year. But charter member or no, he was one of the old guard, that old guard who with Aaron Gove were interested and active in every matter educational or politic-educational. May I assure you, gentleman, that in those days this club was not exactly a rather sprawling social aggregation. It was a close knit, earnest unit, with eyes and ears wide open for any method by which the cause of education in Colorado could be helped. Whether the need were for a pedagogical talk a political interview, some move for reorganization, or a combination of the three, Harry Barrett’s thorough education, practical and keen mind, and his ability to present–were in valuable.\n\nSocially, in the club, he was, I should say, the most popular remember ever enrolled, and yet one who never quite broke down his dignity and reserve. Many of you never had a chance to enjoy his repartee, his wit, or his yarns. A teller of stories he was by instinct and self-training; and many a time he has tickled this club with some piquant anecdote. I will say, however, that his stories if piquant were not risqué or malodorous.\n\nBarrett’s singing voice was an odd one but thoroughly musical. He could sing a very respectable baritone, lead the gang like a second tenor, or even squeal into the “barber shop” notes of the lyric. But whatever part he sang, he threw himself into the singing with such whole-hearted zeal that for years he was the acknowledged chorister of the Schoolmasters, and was relied upon even longer to lead off in an emergency. Somewhere or other he picked up the most of the modern streamlined mumbles and wails, even as he remembered all the ditties of an older vintage, and the names of person who he met anywhere.\n\nHe made a point of knowing every member of this club, as long as such a feat was possible. He was a very agreeable and sympathetic table companion, who never did all of the talking. His mind was alert and he felt his way into the attitude of his neighbor at dinner. So warmly did he take the Schoolmasters Club to his heart that more than once I have heard men mention it as “Barrett’s Club.”\n\nAs educator he was never in that class of leaders who immediately and infallibly know all the answers. Before he attempted to help or advise he would listen patiently and long. Then, if he approved your action, he said so. If he disapproved, you had no doubts. He studied all modern trends. He sifted from each whatever seemed to him good; but forever kept one foot on the ground, and so firmly that he did not lose his equilibrium.\n\nSomehow, notwithstanding his many other studies and diverse activities, he managed to maintain his direct participation in religious life and with his church. At the time of his death, he was president of the Board of Trustees of the bill if school of the ology.\n\nNature did not endow Barrett with an athletic body. Not that he was physically weak. Anyone who ever shook hands with him and experienced is truly Methodist grip, knew better than to take him for a weakling. But a slender frame and did defect of vision prevented him from the whole hearted plunging into athletic which many of us have enjoyed. Perhaps for that very reason he evinced a more intense enthusiasm than most men for the fortunes of his school in college teams, and a more intelligent comprehension of the relation which athletics bear to education in general and to any boy in particular.\n\nMen have deferred (as in the case of any outstanding individual) as to Barrett’s precise value as an educator. Such differing is probably all to the credit of the man in question; and simply proves that he is not easily stamped pell-mell in any one direction. So much I can say, that whenever I have learned post factum the circumstances surrounding some professional act of his which I had failed to understand, I have found a conscientious man struggling, as very few of us do struggle, to do his duty as he saw his duty, and to meet obstacles as a Christian gentleman. As to Barrett’s qualifications as a friend I have heard only one story: kind, sympathetic, intelligent, forbearing, willing, steadfast.\n\nI am told that Barrett was as popular in the Rotary Club as he used to be here. The reasons are not hard to find. Well-read on topics of today, of yesterday, and of yesteryear, he could match almost anyone anywhere in conversation; but he was so considerate of other fellow’s viewpoint that he seldom was over persistent, or gave one the appearance of superiority. Then he was unfailingly witty, with the kind of clean clear-cut humor which pleases all.\n\n“The old order changeth, yielding place to new,” and it should do so, if our old is to be anything but stagnant. Yet I feel that in the death of Harry McWhirter Barrett, not only the Schoolmasters Club but education in Colorado has lost one of its foundation piers, that the gap thus created is probably one which will never be exactly and completely be filled.\n\nNORTHWEST RAILWAY COMPANY\n\nOFFICE OF PRESIDENT\n\n11 BROADWAY, NEW YORK\n\nISAAC E. BLAKE PRESIDENT Dictated August 2, 1899\n\nWritten August 5th 1899\n\nAllie, Belle & George (Manly)\n\n512 Tuxedo Place\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nDear Children,\n\nBelle’s letter of July 30th, and Allie’s without date, written presumably at the same time, is received this morning.\n\nLast night we telegraphed you your dear mother’s death at 3:20 yesterday afternoon. She died peacefully without the slightest suffering, just simply stopped breathing.\n\nI am going over to Greenlawn Cemetery, on Long Island, to select a family plot. It is said to be very well located, and sufficiently remote so that it will not be disturbed for genereations; I expect to find it very new, but under all the circumstances, it seems to be as desirable as anything I have learned of.\n\nWe have tried to give you all of the details of mother’s illness, but many things will have to wait until we see you before things can be fully explained, I will however this morning, make a brief resume of the entire period of her illness, and perhaps after you receive this letter, there will be some special points that you wish to inquire concerning, which, if you mention, I will try to answer.\n\nOn June 10th, being Saturday, your mother and Nettie (Annette Blake) attended a matinee at the Cusine Theatre, where Winfield (Blake) was playing with the Jefferson De Angelis Opera Company; your mother seemed to enjoy the performance very much and laughed heartily at the comedian’s work.\n\nThat evening at six o’clock, I was to leave for Chicago, to meet various parties on important financial matters. On going to the house a little after five, for my trip, I overtook your mother and Nettie a few blocks from the house, just returning from the matinee. I did not have sufficient time to spare to get supper, and I kissed mama goodbye in the hall, she wishing me “good-luck” and I left for Chicago.\n\nWhen I reached Chicago, I found that Mr. Newhouse, whom I had hoped to meet there, had just undergone a surgical operation, and could not, at that time, come to Chicago, so I went through directly to Salt Lake City.\n\nOn the 19th, I received a telegram from Evarts (Blake) saying that mother was very sick with her old difficulty and that the doctors thought that another operation would have to be performed. So I replied immediately advising him to follow Dr. Curley’s advice, and on the 21st at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, the operation was performed. I received a telegram two days later saying that conditions were favorable for recovery, but as soon as I possibly could, I hurried homeward expecting to stop in Erie a day to transact some business there, but on reaching the hotel, I found a telegram from Evarts saying that the doctors stated that mother was liable not to last through the night. This was a terrible shock to me as I had supposed she was getting along all right, not having heard for several days.\n\nI took the train for New York, leaving Erie about 11 o’clock and reached New York the following afternoon, and as soon as possible, went to your mother’s bedside. I found that although she had passed through a most critical night, she was somewhat relieved from her high state of fever, and her temperature had fallen even a little below normal, but it gradually raised again up to 105 or 106, and she had another chill at midnight, and in the paroxysms following the chill each time, the doctors had grave doubts that she would be able to live but a very short time. However there was about two days intervening between the next chill, the second one a little longer and the third one, after I came home, seemed to be the climax of all, her temperature reaching 107.\n\nFrom that time forward the maximum temperatures began to decline until about the 17th of July, when the fever became less alarming, ranging from normal to 102- and occasionally to 103. This began to give us hope that she might recover, but at the very best state, about this time, the doctors only admitted that she perhaps had an even chance to live. Before that they considered that she only had one chance in ten.\n\nOn Monday the 17th she sat up two hours, and that night I left for Erie. That was Monday night. I got back Thursday the 20th, and they told me that she had been sitting up each day for two hours. So from the 17th to the 20th seemed to be the most hopeful time in her illness, as the danger from the pyemic condition seemed to be very much lessened.\n\nJust the nature or exact cause of pyemia (septicemia) we shall never know; whether an abscess formed in the liver, or whether it was simply a general poisoning of the blood to a limited extent no one can tell, probably the latter. Just at this time occurred the characteristic result of pyemia.\n\nWhen I went into her room on the morning of the 20th she called my attention to her right hand that she could not use; the hand from the wrist down seemed to be useless, the rest of her arm seemed to be all right and the remainder of her right side was at that time unaffected. I noticed in her talk that she lisped at that time, no one seemed to notice it until my return that morning and had called their attention to it. The cause of this is unquestionably what is called “thrombosis”, described in my previous letters.\n\nOn account of some heart lesion, or condition of the walls of the blood vessels becoming roughened, on account of the poisonous matter passing through the blood, began to coagulate at some point near the base of the brain, this coagulum beginning gradually, and not entirely stopping the flow of blood, so it only caused a slight paralysis at first, the brain getting a limited supply, and the impairment of the mental faculties became greater and greater each day from the moment of the beginning of this thrombosis until her death. It was a constant increasing paralysis and less of mental faculty.\n\nYou could scarcely say that at any time after she arrived home on Wednesday whether she realized all that you were saying or not. But at times she would appreciate more than at others, but I think that at no time after Sunday of the 23rd did she have full control of her mental powers; she apparently knew us, and when we asked her to say words, she would make an effort to say them, and she would pat us on the check or put her arm around our necks, or squeeze our hands as a token of her affection, until next to the last day of her life. If she did think and realize anything, she was unable to express it scarcely, after the 23rd.\n\nShe would rally a little after a good day, seeming to have great natural vitality, but each day would leave her a little lower than the one previous until yesterday, at the time named, she expired without struggle.\n\nSince my return home I have endeavored to get a clear history of all the facts which occurred on the night I left, and the time the operation was performed: I get most of my information from Robert (Blake), Nettie being almost dazed with grief and does not seem to remember clearly, and Evarts was at the office that period.\n\nI learn however, that on the Sunday following the day I left she had an attack, evidently a gall stone had started to escape through the common duct, they applied the hot water bags, and during the day she recovered and was around the house the rest of the day. The following day about half past three she had a recurrence of the attack, and from that time forward until she was taken to the hospital, she grew continually worse; she was so bad that she could scarcely breathe, and it was necessary to revive her with compound oxygen.\n\nDr. Abbe made an examination with Dr. Korley, who was with her daily, and he decided to wait until Wednesday the 21st, before performing the operation, which was more than a week after the attack, the operation being performed at the Roosevelt Hospital. She had already developed a high fever at the house, on account of the purulent matter being forced back into the system by the closing of the common duct with a large gall stone. This I believe covers the entire history of the case.\n\nWe have one consolation, that the last two months of her life, before she was taken ill, were probably the happiest she ever had. We had come to understand each other better, and to enjoy the mutual confidence and love. Never before did I really appreciate her worth, and I hope her daughters will emulate her worthy example, and you may be sure, on my testimony of more than thirty three years of intimate association that your mother, no steadier, purer or truer woman ever lived.\n\nDeath of Mrs. Bertha Grimes\n\nLast Thursday the friends and relatives of Mrs. Walter Grimes of this place were shocked to learn that she had been taken suddenly and fatally ill. She had been in good health and spirits, and though on arising that morning she had not felt so well as usual, she was but slightly indisposed. About 10 0’clock a.m. she was seized by a severe convulsion, and from then until about five o’clock p.m. she passed from one almost directly into another. A physician was summoned at once upon the attack appearing and he remained with her constantly.\n\nDuring the time that the convulsions continued it was thought that each would result in death. After five 0’clock, the remedies administered seemed to be producing some effect, for the pulse of the patient became better, and ground for hope was found.\n\nAbout eleven o’clock in the night, a perfectly formed and well developed female child was born, and from thence onward until about twelve hours later, when she died, the sufferer sank away. The child lived until six o’clock Friday morning, and had she survived, she would have been named Margaret, for her dead grandmother. In the natural course, the child would not have been born until about August 1st, and the immediate cause of death of Mrs. Grimes, as will appear from what has already been stated, was puerperal convulsions, resulting in the premature birth of the child. It is understood that the attending physician does not regard these as having been brought on by any accident or injury. but as having resulted in a constitutional disturbance which was not known beforehand. The case was similar to that of Mrs. Lena White nee McBurnev.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon at two o’clock, the funeral services under the direction of Dr. S. Burt, occurred at the house of the grief stricken parents, on Wheeling Ave. Appropriate and beautiful selections were sung by a choir, Rev F.A. Brown and Dr. McFarland, read scripture lessons, Dr. W.V. Milligan and Dr. Burt offered prayer, and touching remarks were made by Rev. L.B. Moore and Rev. H.B. Edwards, of Stuebenville, who had officiated at the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Grimes, September 9, 1891.\n\nThe interment was made to Cambridge Cemetery, and though the weather was sultry and rainy, many friends and relatives from a distance attended, and a long concourse followed the remains through the rain to the cemetery. Mother and child were interred in the same casket.\n\nMrs. Grimes was the only child of Winfield T. Scott and Mary E., daughter of the late William Burt, and was just approaching the 23rd year of her age, having been born January 19 1870. She was vivacious and sprightly in disposition, kind and womanly in manner, and a favorite with all of her friends. Her death coming so unexpectedly and being so nearly tragic in its character, causes sorrow and sympathy throughout the town and vicinity. If the bereavement could be added to by anything beyond the circumstances already indicated, it is made more crushing to the parents by the fact that during last winter Mrs. Margaret Burt, mother of Mrs. Scott, and a loved member of their family, was instantly killed by an accident upon the B. & O. railroad near Monroeville.\n\nMrs. Scott’s condition since Friday morning has been such as to arouse the greatest concern in the minds of her friends. She was so prostrated, that she has since been unable to leave the home, even to attend the interment.\n\nDeath of Mrs. Margaret Burt\n\nMrs. Margaret Burt, widow of William Burt, who died in Cambridge, May 22nd 1888, was killed in the terrible wreck on the B. & O. railroad at Hicksville. She with her sister, Mrs. Simeon Davis, of Jackson township, this county, was returning from a visit with friends in the west, and they were passengers on the ill-fated train. Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Burt were occupying the same seat in the lady’s car when the crash came. Mrs. Davis was painfully, but not seriously, hurt and is now out of danger and rapidly recovering. Mrs. Burt was so severely crushed about the head and breast as to be rendered unconscious, except to give her name and speak once till death relieved her agony.\n\nThe news of the wreck soon reached Cambridge and her son in law, Winfield Scott, Esq., at once started for the scene. He reported the situation and Mrs. Scott and daughter, Mrs. Grimes, hastened to reach the dying woman, but before they arrived, she was dead. the suspense was very great pending the final result, and little else was thought of or talked about in Cambridge until a telegram announced the fatal termination.\n\nUpon the arrival of the train bearing the remains of Mrs. Burt and the injured Mrs. Davis, a large crowd of friends and neighbors were in waiting and escorted the one, and tenderly bore the other upon a stretcher to the residence of Mr. Scott on East Wheeling Avenue, with whom Mrs. Burt resided since her husband’s death. Universal sorrow prevailed, for Mrs. Burt was an amiable and lovely woman, sincerely loved by all who knew her.\n\nLoving hands had prepared the bruised and disfigured form for the casket and many tears were shed by those who gazed upon the cruel wounds that robbed her beautiful features of their wonted comeliness.\n\nThe funeral services were largely attended. Rev. L.B. Moore, her pastor, conducted them reading a scripture lesson and delivering a beautiful eulogy upon the life and character of the deceased. Rev. Dr. Milligan led in an appropriate and earnest prayer; Rev. Dr. Burt spoke tenderly and beautifully; the choir of the Baptist church assisted by Mr.s Professor Sarchet sang in an anthem and appropriate hymns and the body was followed to the cemetery near the Cambridge Baptist church where her husband and other deceased relatives lay buried.\n\nMrs. Burt was a daughter of William and Mary Rainey, late of Jackson township this county; was born in Pennsylvania April 24th, 1827; came with her parents to this county in 1837; married to Wm. Burt, February 21, 1848. To them were born three children: James, who died in infancy; Asbury, who was killed by a boiler explosion east of Cambridge a few years ago, and Mary E., wife of Winfield Scott, who lives in Cambridge. She became a Christian more than forty years ago, was baptized by the venerable Baptist preacher Rev. Hugh Broom. During the past twenty years she was connected with the church in Cambridge an was, as stated by her pastor, “an earnest, outspoken disciple, always in her place in church, deeply and intelligently interested in church work.”\n\nAs a wife and mother, she was a model, ever cheerful and exemplary. In youth, she was remarkably beautiful in form and feature, and this grace and loveliness of person were preserved through life, heightened by the dignity and force of an intellect and character of rare excellence, that won and held the love and respect of all with whom she came in contact, as relative, friend, neighbor and Christian.\n\nMr. Scott desires us to say that the family of Joseph cook, of Hicksville, with whom she was domiciled after the accident, showed every possible kindness and tenderness to her and Mrs. Davis; he says, “they could not have been more kind.”"
