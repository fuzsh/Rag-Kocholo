But if you want to take your kids for a walk or to the park, etc., you won't be happy?\n\nAny insights very welcome, thanks!\n\nI think it may have to do with the individual house, as Sedgwick is arguably the most affluent neighborhood in the city. A census block group in the neighborhood: Census Block Group 000900-2 in Onondaga County, New York\n\nThe census tract it is in, which includes a small portion of the Eastwood neighborhood: Census Tract 000900 in Onondaga County, New York\n\nI go through that area daily and the areas north/east of Schiller Park into Sedgwick are ok/solid, but as you go further west of it, things get rougher. Not immediately, but steadily.\n\nIt is a nice park with a swimming pool and you will find some of the immigrant/refugee kids playing pick up soccer in the park during the warmer months. This is a nice view of Downtown from the park:\n\nhttp://media.syracuse.com/news/photo...9ef6_large.jpg\n\nI don't think there is a risk of homes becoming rentals and there are actually townhomes/apartments in the neighborhood itself. An example: Dewitt Highland Townhouse Apartments in Syracuse\n\nYou see people walking in the neighborhood with their dogs and there is actually a tennis club in the neighborhood: Tennis Club, Tennis Courts, Tournaments Syracuse NY | Sedgwick Farm Tennis Club\n\nYou have judges and politicians that live in the neighborhood as well.\n\nSalem-Hyde Elementary is the public elementary for the neighborhood and it is ok/solid by state standards when looking at test scores. School Home | The Syracuse City School District | Syracuse, NY\n\nThis is the middle school in the neighborhood: School Home | The Syracuse City School District | Syracuse, NY but some in the portion closer to Grant Boulevard may go here: School Home | The Syracuse City School District | Syracuse, NY\n\nThe public high school they are zoned for: Henninger High School but this is a good magnet option: School Home | The Syracuse City School District | Syracuse, NY\n\nIf you go private, these seem to be options people in the neighborhood go with: Blessed Sacrament School | Syracuse, NY\n\nSt. Margaret's School (maybe)\n\nWelcome to Bishop Grimes:Home - Welcome to Bishop Grimes Jr/Sr. High School (quite a few)\n\nhttps://www.mphschool.org/\n\nhttps://www.cbasyracuse.org/\n\nAmong others...\n\nThis is a charter option in the city: http://www.sascs.org/\n\nSome may go public or charter due to this: Home - Say Yes to Education - Syracuse\n\nHow It Works - Say Yes to Education - Syracuse\n\nEligibility - Say Yes to Education - Syracuse\n\nSyracuse College Partners - Say Yes to Education - Syracuse\n\nSo, you could even go private and then transfer in time in order to qualify.\n\nHope that this helps...\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Sean®\n\nThings sell for what people will pay.\n\nHaving said that to me it seems really overpriced.\n\nFor that money you can get a really nice house in the burbs that has a modern heating system and modern wire ring and good schools.\n\nI see they has been lowering the price for awhile now. My guess is when they sell it the price will be much lower.\n\nI think the thing with the neighborhood is that the taxes seem to be lower and you can’t find homes like those in the suburbs, with maybe a few exceptions. Many that live there are likely to go private in terms of schools or just take more responsibility in terms of education, as you still get kids that go public and do fine.\n\nThere’s the aspect of the Say Yes program currently tied to the public schools as well.\n\nYou could also walk to things and take the bus, if you want to. So, those that may want walkability or use public transportation could from the neighborhood.\n\nSo, it may be a matter of how people navigate the situation or want in a neighborhood.\n\nKeep in mind that it is a historic neighborhood as well: http://www.syracuse.ny.us/uploadedFi...t/sedgwick.pdf\n\nhttp://www.syracuse.ny.us/uploadedFi..._Standards.pdf\n\nLast edited by ckhthankgod; 01-21-2018 at 07:43 AM.."
