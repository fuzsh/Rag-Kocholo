        "text": "It’s graduation time.\n\nHigh school students in the Class of 2021 have been through a lot: remote learning; being required to wear masks; shortening or cancelling sports seasons, musicals and concerts; and a whole lot of uncertainty. They have had to distance themselves from their friends and teachers for months.\n\nEven through all that, they’ve done what’s required to make it through to the end of the school year.\n\nTo celebrate the Class of 2021, we are publishing lists of the graduates from more than 60 schools across Central New York.\n\nWe will report who is the valedictorian and salutatorian (or in some cases alternates) and give them a chance to share some thoughts about school, the pandemic, family and life. This school’s valedictorian and salutatorian are below the list of graduates.\n\nCommencement\n\nThe ceremony for graduating seniors of Bishop Grimes Jr./Sr. High School is scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday, June 12, in the main gym of the school. Face masks will be required and social distancing protocols will be in place. The graduation speaker will be Bishop Grimes alumnus, Tom Kenny, from the Class of 1980.\n\nCandidates for Graduation\n\nJulia Avery\n\nMatthew Brancato\n\nJunjie Cai\n\nNoelle Card\n\nQiushi Chen\n\nOlivia Coppola\n\nEleanor DeChick\n\nDevon DeSiro-Camber\n\nMarin DiTullio\n\nAlivia Duchano\n\nJaiden Eallonardo\n\nNader Elturk\n\nAlexis Emmi\n\nSarah Falgiatano\n\nKang Fan\n\nDeddeh Fasama\n\nIsabella Ferrante\n\nRobert Finger III\n\nConner Frigon\n\nJacob Fritz\n\nMatthew Fuller\n\nJoseph Gadway\n\nRobert Gilbert\n\nJack Gutchess\n\nAnisa Holder\n\nZixin Ju\n\nAlicia Kelly\n\nIsabelle Kinsey\n\nEmma Maher\n\nSamuel Mathewson\n\nGiovanna Miller\n\nAlexander Mueller\n\nSeth Murphy\n\nLeah Perry\n\nAndrew Rabbia\n\nIsaiah Rosado\n\nReachny San\n\nMatthew Santy\n\nJ’Naia Stepp\n\nAbigail Tweedale\n\nZijin Wang\n\nAlexander Williams\n\nRuoyuan Wu\n\nJiesen Zhang\n\nJunru Zheng\n\n...\n\n2021 Valedictorian and Salutatorian\n\nBishop Grimes Jr./Sr. High School\n\nValedictorian\n\nName: Noelle Card\n\nTown: Brewerton\n\nParents: Robert and Peggy Card\n\nMy plans for the next few years: I plan to attend the University of Toronto and major in chemical engineering.\n\nMy career plans: My career plans are to use my engineering skills to create things that help people and make the world a better place.\n\nThe highlight of my senior year: The highlight of my senior year was receiving the notification that I had won the International Scholar Award from the University of Toronto, which made it clear to me that it was the place that I wanted to go.\n\nThe person who inspired me the most: The person who has inspired me the most is my mom because she has been able to be very successful in her career while also spending meaningful time with me throughout my life.\n\nWhat I do to unwind or relax: Some of my extracurricular activities throughout high school included ballet; lessons for clarinet, guitar, and piano; volunteering at a local food pantry; taking college classes; being a member of Student Council and Select Choir; and working part-time rolling ice cream. To relax I like to paint, talk, or read a book.\n\nThe word or phrase best that best describes my personality: Driven\n\nMy advice to our graduating class: Work hard and look at the bigger picture.\n\nThe best part about social distancing: The best part about social distancing has been being able to take college classes online. This has allowed me to take five college classes in one summer at two different colleges.\n\nThe biggest impact of the pandemic on my senior year: The biggest impact of the pandemic on my senior year has been not being able to do the activities I used to and therefore starting new ones.\n\nThe one thing I hope to accomplish in my lifetime: One thing I hope to accomplish is to create products that enhance people’s lives and the longevity of the planet.\n\n...\n\nBishop Grimes Jr./Sr. High School\n\nSalutatorian\n\nName: Sarah Falgiatano\n\nTown: Cicero\n\nParents: Charles and Colleen Falgiatano\n\nMy plans for the next few years: Next year I will be attending Siena College. I will be studying political science, and I am in their 3+2 program with Albany Law School.\n\nMy career plans: I plan to be a lawyer.\n\nThe highlight of my senior year: The highlights of my senior year were my tennis season and receiving the news that I was salutatorian. Tennis has always been one of my favorite sports, but this year it was extra special. Due to Covid, the fall volleyball season was put on hold so some of my best friends were able to play tennis with me when normally they would not have been able to do so. Also, being told I was salutatorian was a really special moment.\n\nThe person who inspired me the most: My parents have most inspired me. My dad inspires me because of his work ethic and drive to always succeed. I am following in his footsteps hopefully to become a lawyer, and I want to provide for my own family like he has done for my siblings and me. My mother also inspires me because she is the most selfless and loving person I know. She always puts my brothers and me first and would do anything for us.\n\nWhat I do to unwind or relax: To unwind I watch “Scandal” or “Grey’s Anatomy,” no matter how many times I have watched it. I also spend my fair share of time watching Tik Toks as well. For extracurricular activities, I have always participated in sports. I have played basketball and softball in my earlier years at Bishop Grimes. This year I was able to play three sports: tennis, volleyball and golf.\n\nThe word or phrase best that best describes my personality: Determined\n\nMy advice to our graduating class: No matter what your future plans are, always dream big, never give up, and strive for success. Set personal goals for yourself and always strive to achieve them. Choose success and you will be successful.\n\nThe best part about social distancing: For me, the best part of social distancing during the pandemic was the job opportunity it presented. I was able to receive a job at DeFrancisco and Falgiatano Law Firm answering phones. Due to the pandemic, I was the only person who could be at the office with my father because of the restrictions. This opportunity allowed me to further explore the field of law and helped me solidify my future plans.\n\nThe biggest impact of the pandemic on my senior year: The biggest impact of the pandemic for me was not being able to go to support my friends at their sporting events. When I was younger, I would always go to the games my dad coached and as I got to high school, I kept going to games to support my friends. Not being able to do this my senior year was devastating.\n\nThe one thing I hope to accomplish in my lifetime: In my lifetime I hope to accomplish the lifestyle that my father has achieved. He has worked really hard and become successful. He is now able to provide for our family with great things including vacations. I want to accomplish success in my life so that I have the freedom and ability to travel and explore this beautiful world.\n\n..."
