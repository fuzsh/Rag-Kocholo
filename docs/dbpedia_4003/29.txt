My children have been students at Bishop Grimes for several years and up till this year have loved it. This year a new principal started and has been rude to the children and keeps the parents in the dark about situations that have happened at the school. The new principal yells at the kids and talks down to them. I am researching other schools to transfer my children to. If you would have asked me last year at this time if my children would ever want to leave Bishop Grimes the answer would have been no but now they want to leave.

Bishop Grimes #5 Along with receiving a great education, there are extra curricular activities offered such as band, chorus, jazz band, drama, BG TV, and art classes. Overall, I would recommend Bishop Grimes Junior-Senior High School to anyone. My experience there was wonderful. I could not have asked for a better education. Obviously while I attended Bishop Grimes I had more complaints, like all students, but looking back it was more than I could have asked for. I made life long relationships that I am very grateful for. Bishop Grimes is not only a place of learning but a place where any student will find a family within the faculty and students.
