        "text": "\"Juan Dominguez de Mendoza Book in Hand\n\nI learned last weekend that the “Juan Domínguez de Mendoza” book was being distributed. I eagerly anticipated receiving copies of the book from UNM Press. The copies were delivered to my residence on Tuesday while I was traveling out of state. It wasn’t until very late this past Thursday that I returned home and with great satisfaction opened the box and held a copy of the book in my hand. A large amount of time and effort by France V. Scholes and Eleanor B. Adams and then by Marc Simmons and me is now condensed into a single volume. I’m very honored to have been allowed to help bring this book into print.\n\nThe book jacket design in quite attractive and rather than being bound in the reddish cloth with gold lettering, as featured in the UNM Press Spring catalogue and the online images, the cloth cover is a sandy tan color. The total number of pages of the book came to 487 instead of the 464 that was originally advertised.\n\nI’m particularly pleased that the inside cover and the back cover of the book jacket acknowledges that the “Juan Domínguez de Mendoza” book is a volume of the influential Coronado Historical Series, representing the previously y absent volume 7 of the series. Although the “Juan Domínguez de Mendoza book is seventy years late in completion, it can now take its place among the works of a variety of esteemed scholars.\n\nIf you pre-ordered the book, you should be receiving your copy, if you haven’t received it already. Send me your comments as your read the book. No need to wait until you are finished. Marc Simmons and I would very much enjoy your comments and questions. You can send comments via a response to this blog, or on my Facebook authors page, or directly to me via e-mail at jesquibel@yahoo.com.\n\nPublished on"
