        "meta_description": "Now run as a school, Palace of Antonio de Mendoza was built in the year 1510. The spectacular palace was built to the designs of Lorenzo Vázquez, noted architect. In the later years, Brianda de Mendoza set up a Franciscan convent here and apportioned it to Nuestra Señora de la Piedad. The palace entrance is decorated with military motifs and features a frontispiece which made way for the present-day gallery. The courtyard inside the palace remains a fine specimen of Renaissance building in Castille.",
