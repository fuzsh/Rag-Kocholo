The first of my many debts is owed to Madeleine Quinn, my history teacher at school, who first instilled the love for history in me with her inspirational lessons. It was during one of those lessons that I first came across the reign of Philip and Mary, and the topic has captivated me ever since. The fact that a king of Spain had also been a king of England seemed unfathomable (it is not, as the pages that follow will show) and this book is the eventual product of that initial early teenager curiosity. For opening that first door, I will always be grateful to her, as well as to my other history teachers at school, Marta Argüelles de Andrés and Rafael Rodrigo Fernández, who sustained and encouraged my passion. The British-Spanish Society, together with Santander Universities, provided me with much-needed funds for my research. Special thanks go to Albert Jones, Luis Juste and Gloria, Baroness Hooper, the latter of whom took a particular interest in my project and kindly invited me to spend the day with her at the House of Lords in the autumn of 2013 – an experience I shall never forget. I would also like to thank the Mytton Scholarship scheme, the School of Humanities, and the Alumni Foundation at the University of Bristol, as well as the Catholic Record Society, all of which have also furnished me with valuable financial assistance to carry out my research at different stages. This book would have been impossible to write were it not for the indispensable assistance provided by the staff at the various archives and libraries that I have visited throughout the years. Special mention is owed to the always kind and effective help that Isabel Aguirre Landa, from the Archivo General de Simancas, never failed to offer, and to Tim Kirtley from Wadham College, Oxford, who, several years ago, generously made room in his office for me to read Pedro de Soto’s Defensio catholicae confessionis. I am also indebted to everyone involved in getting the images for the monograph ready, especially to David Mason (The Royal Mint Museum), Nuria Moreu Toloba and her team (Museo de Artes Decorativas de Madrid) and Jorge San Juan Breña (Real Casa de la Moneda), who went out of their way to assist me, and to Dr Gabrielle Storey, who helped with the King’s Bench illustrations. My foremost academic debt is owed to Dr Fernando Cervantes, whom I had the immense privilege of having as my Ph.D. supervisor and who has always very generously assisted me with his knowledge, readily offering his inestimable guidance with no caveats, including – and especially – at the most difficult of times. Not only has he been my academic mentor before, during, and after my doctoral studies, but he has also become a very close friend, too. La deuda y el afecto contraídos son inconmensurables. Similarly, I would not have been\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nable to bring this book to light without the brilliance and support of Professor Ronald Hutton who, with characteristic bonhomie, has always provided great advice, first as my second supervisor and later as my colleague, and has always made me question things from angles which I had not previously considered. Professor Eamon Duffy and Professor Kenneth Austin both gave me invaluable guidance to develop my doctoral thesis into this monograph, and my knowledge and understanding of Philip and Mary’s reign would have been much poorer without the warm recommendations, enthusiasm and encouragement of Dr John Edwards and Dr Alexander Samson, both of whom believed in my research from the beginning and generously put their expertise at my disposal, providing indispensable suggestions to the first draft. This gratefulness extends to Professor Suzannah Lipscomb, who also read the first version of the manuscript and provided vital observations and corrections, enriching the final result in the process. I would also like to thank Brill, and especially Ivo Romein, Gera van Bedaf and Arjan van Dijk, for their support and counsel and, especially, for their patience. And thanks, Ivo, because you always seemed to have the most pragmatic of solutions at hand whenever I started fretting. The comments made by the anonymous reviewer of the first manuscript version of this book were very positive and insightful and Professor Christopher Ocker, editor of the Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions series, showed me great support and encouragement. I am extremely grateful to both. Many others have spurred me on my journey or have contributed with their insights, advice, proofreading, support or friendship to the completion of this book: Dr Hélder Carvalhal, Dr Anna Demoux, Dr Emily Derbyshire, the late Professor Sir John H. Elliott, Dr Elizabeth Evenden-Kenyon, Dr Steven M. Foster, Professor Enrique García Hernán, Claudia Gumm, Dr Andrew Hegarty, Dr Catherine Hunt, Dr Evan Jones, Dr Pamela Lock, Professor Giuseppe Marcocci, Professor José Antonio Martínez Torres, Dr Giuseppe Mrozek Eliszezynski, Dr Fernando J. Padilla Angulo, Dr Glyn Redworth, Dr John Reeks, Professor Ana Sáez-Hidalgo, Daniel Smith Ramos, Dr Richard Stone, Dr Nasim Tadghighi, Dr Alberto Viso Outeiriño, and many, many others. To all of them I am very grateful. I would also like to thank my fantastic colleagues at the Department of History in Bristol for being so welcoming, friendly, and inspirational – I am always in awe of all of you! I could not close this section without showing gratitude to my students, thanks to whom my job is a very enjoyable one and whose insights are often very valuable and stimulating. Thanks are due, for bearing with me, to all my friends in Madrid and Bristol and to those scattered around the globe. Many of them have always known, even, perhaps, before I did, that history was my calling, and they did not cease\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxi\n\nto repeat it until I finally listened. Over the years they have put up with their friend always being very busy and they have done so with grace – I hope I am now making up for time lost. I would like to conclude by thanking my family for their steadfast support and understanding. I want to pay tribute to my four grandparents, Gonzalo, Pilar, Manuel, and Teresa, all now sadly departed, for the fantastic examples they have all furnished me with. I cherish all the gifts that their generation bestowed upon mine and I will always miss them. Special thanks go to my parents, Gonzalo and Ana, for their unflinching support and encouragement throughout my entire life and for being the best role-models I could ever have hoped for. My sister Patricia is the epitome of strength and constancy and I am grateful for everything that she has taught me and for how loudly and hysterically she makes me laugh. Os quiero muchísimo. I would also like to thank my numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins for always being there for me. My beautiful English family welcomed me with open arms and has always made me feel at home. Thank you very much Karen, Verity, and Michael. Special tribute is owed to the children in the family, as they never fail to bring joy and happiness. Heartfelt thanks, therefore, go to my nieces and nephews, Isla, Mikey, Valentina, and Freddie, because they bring light to my days. Henry the Cocker Spaniel also deserves to be mentioned, for he has been the most faithful and reliable of research assistants (if not, perhaps, the most productive) and has often slept and snored by my side as I typed away. Finally, my greatest debt of gratitude goes to my husband, Colin, who has believed in me since we first met and has never since wavered. He has generously accepted Philip and Mary as part of his life for the last few years and has managed to make room for them (at one point, quite literally, in the dining room, which I hijacked with my books and papers for years). To this most loyal, kind, and constant of men I dedicate this book (despite his entrenched refusal to watch Becoming Elizabeth with me). Te quiero; siempre.

Unless otherwise stated, therefore, all translations are my own. For the sake of clarity and transparency, and to provide further context, crucial and short passages translated into English in the main body of text have been added in their original forms as part of a footnote. Grammar and spelling have been left untouched except for modern accent marks in Spanish, French and Italian, which have been added to enhance readability. With regards to terminology, ‘Spain’ has been used at times as an umbrella term to designate the entire political entity (the composite monarchy) over which King Philip ruled but also to describe the geographical area that delimits the actual Spanish territory in a way that can be discerned from the context. Terms which convey the full extent and intent of the Spanish monarchical project, such as ‘Spanish Monarchy’ (Monarquía Hispánica) or ‘Catholic Monarchy’ (Monarquía Cató­ lica) have been used throughout, too. The term ‘Spanish Empire’ (Imperio español) has been generally avoided, as it does not fully convey the system of independent and interdependent states under a single monarch which defined the Spanish Monarchy and was not in use in the sixteenth century. With coherence and simplicity in mind, the terms used to describe those in each side of the religious divide have mostly been ‘Catholic’ and ‘Protestant’. The myriad currents of thought and theological interpretations co-existing on both sides – as well as the different Protestant Churches – are fully acknowledged, but in the years leading up to and in the aftermath of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, the term ‘Protestant’ had already begun to be appropriated by those reformers who had embraced an infrangible break with papal primacy.\n\nFamily Trees 1 The Habsburg-Trastámara Family XVII 2 The Tudor Family XVIII\n\n1501–1526\n\nJuana I, Queen of Spain\n\n1527–1598\n\n1546–1568 (3) Élisabeth of Valois\n\n(1) Maria Manuela of Portugal\n\n1527–1545\n\nCarlos, Prince of Asturias\n\nPhilip I and II, Maria King of England of and Spain Portugal\n\n1521–1577\n\nMiguel, Prince of Asturias\n\n1545–1568\n\n(2) Francis I, King of France\n\n1494–1547\n\n1500–1558\n\nJuan\n\nMargaret of Habsburg\n\n1480–1530 1479–1555 Philip I of Habsburg, King of Castile\n\n1478–1506\n\nAnne of Bohemia\n\n1503–1547\n\n(2) María\n\n1482–1517\n\n1527–1576 Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor\n\n(4) Anne of Austria\n\n1549–1580\n\n1528–1603 María\n\n1503–1564 1481–1559 Ferdinand I, Charles V, Holy 1503–1539 Isabel Christian II, Holy Roman Roman Empire Isabel King of Emperor and King of Denmark of Spain Portugal 1498–1558 1521–1590 Christina, Dowager (3) Eleanor Duchess of Milan and Lorraine\n\n1498–1500\n\n(1) Isabel\n\n1470–1498 1478–1497\n\n1451–1504 Isabel I, Queen of Castile 1491–1547\n\n1485–1536\n\nSebastian I, King of Portugal\n\n1554–1578\n\n1537–1554 1516–1558 João (2) Mary I, Manuel of Queen of England Portugal and Ireland\n\n1507–1578 1502–1557 1506–1526 Louis II, Catherine John III, King of King of Portugal Hungary\n\n1535–1573 Juana\n\nMary\n\n1505–1558\n\n(1) Arthur (2) Henry VIII, Catherine Tudor, Prince King of England of Wales & Ireland\n\n1486–1502\n\noffspring\n\nmarriage\n\n1\n\n1469–1521 Manuel I, King of Portugal\n\n1452–1516 Ferdinand II, King of Aragon\n\nFamily Trees\n\nxvii\n\nThe Habsburg-Trastámara Family\n\n(1) Francis II, King of France\n\n1566–1625\n\n(2) Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley\n\nJames VI and I, King of Scotland, England & Ireland\n\nMary I, Queen of Scots\n\nMatthew Stewart, Earl of Lennox\n\n1516–1571\n\n1546–1567\n\n1515–1578 1515–1560 Lady (2) Mary of Margaret Guise Douglas\n\n1544–1560 1542–1587\n\n1512–1542 James V, King of Scotland\n\nElizabeth of York\n\nHenry VII, King of England\n\nMary I, Queen of England & Ireland\n\n1516–1558\n\nLord Guildford Dudley\n\n1536–1554\n\nPhilip I and II, King of England & Spain\n\n1527–1598\n\nElizabeth I, Edward VI, King of Queen of England England & Ireland & Ireland\n\n1484–1545\n\n1496–1533\n\nLady Jane Grey\n\nLady Catherine 1537–1554 Grey\n\n1540–1568\n\nHenry Grey, Duke of Suffolk\n\nLady Mary Grey\n\n1545–1578\n\n1531–1593 Henry Stanley, Earl of Derby\n\nLady Margaret Clifford\n\nLady Eleanor Brandon 1540–1596\n\nLady Henry Clifford, Frances Earl of Brandon Cumberland\n\n1519–1547\n\n1499–1500 1503–1503 Edmund, Catherine Duke of Somerset\n\n(1) Louis (2) Charles Mary XII, King Brandon, Duke of France of Suffolk 1517–1559 1517–1570 1517–1554\n\n1462–1515\n\n1492–1495 Elizabeth 1515–57 1525–42 1512–48 (6) (5) (4) Anne of Catherine Catherine Parr Cleves Howard\n\noffspring\n\nmarriage\n\n2\n\n1491–1547 1485–1536 1486–1502 (1) Henry VIII, Arthur, Catherine King of 1501–36 1509–37 Prince of Aragon England of Wales (2) (3) & Ireland Anne 1473–1513 1489–1541 1489–1557 1495–1552 Jane Boleyn Seymour (1) James Margaret (2) Archibald (3) Henry Douglas, Earl Stewart, Lord IV, King of of Angus Methven Scotland 1533–1603 1537–1553\n\n1466–1503\n\n1457–1509\n\nxviii Family Trees\n\nThe Tudor Family\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret? An analysis of the extensive literature available on the reign of Philip and Mary (1554–1558) will show that the historiography has been, until recently, consistently characterised by opposition. Either Mary and her reign were put in opposition against her sister and successor, Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), or they were put in opposition against her husband, Philip. In the first case, the achievements and successes of Elizabeth’s reign are contrasted to the alleged failures and disappointments of Mary’s.1 Both sisters were eventually childless, but only to Mary does it correspond to carry the dubious (and uncharitable) honour of being branded a ‘sterile’ interlude in her country’s history, a description engendered by A. F. Pollard (1869–1948) which has proven extremely resilient.2 In similar vein, when historians sought to rehabilitate Mary’s figure or bring balance to the study of her reign, this was often done at the expense of Philip’s role as king of England. In this narrative, Philip was intensely disliked by Mary’s court and by Mary’s people, a dislike the Spanish king reciprocated. Unimpressed by a cold reception and his demotion as a mere king consort, we are told, he abandoned his wife and his new kingdom as soon as he could and only returned to plunge England into a disastrous war which cost the English Calais, their last Continental stronghold.3 Perhaps the scholar who most contributed to the blackening of the reign’s reputation in modern times was James Anthony Froude (1818–1894), who thought that the queen had suffered from ‘hysterical derangement’. Although initially kind and leading a frugal and respectful life, the treatment she suffered at the hands of her husband and her inability to conceive a child, among other failures of her life and reign, led Mary to insanity, and her ‘madness was of a kind which placed her absolutely under her spiritual directors’. Froude targeted Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and Cardinal Reginald Pole as the main perpetrators of Mary’s cruel persecutions, but she, as queen, was to blame too. In Froude’s view, therefore, Queen Mary became, simultaneously, a cruel persecutor and a hysterical woman who had no actual agency, for this corresponded to the men around her. Erroneously dating the infamous sobriquet with which she has been known, Bloody Mary, to her lifetime, Froude 1 Typical of this trend is G. R. Elton, Reform and Reformation: England, 1509–1558 (London: Edward Arnold, 1977), 376–96. 2 A. F. Pollard, The History of England from the accession of Edward VI to the death of Elizabeth (London: Longmans/Greens, 1910), 172. 3 This perspective was strongly put forward by D. M. Loades, The Reign of Mary Tudor: Politics, Government, and Religion in England, 1553–1558 (London: Ernest Benn, 1979), 138, 215, 243.\n\n© Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2023 | doi:10.1163/978\n\n2\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\nexplained that in five years ‘she had swathed her name in the horrid epithet which will cling to it for ever’ and that with her death and that of Pole the same day, ‘the reign of the Pope in England, and the reign of terror, closed together’. Mary’s great mistake was that she could not grasp the superiority of Protestantism over Catholicism and the innate moderation of the English character, for, Had Mary been content with mild repression, had she left the Pope to those who loved him, and married, instead of Philip, some English lord, the mass would have retained its place, the clergy in moderate form would have resumed their old authority, and the Reformation would have waited for a century.4 What this mild repression would have consisted of, who from among her own subjects should the queen have married or why the (Protestant) Reformation, so obvious a necessity in Froude’s account, should have had to wait for another century are questions left unexplained, but his account became a blueprint for English-speaking historians of the reign for the rest of the nineteenth century and for most of the twentieth. If for Pollard the reign had been a ‘sterile interlude’, for S. T. Bindoff (1908–1980) it had been so disastrous at all levels – political, spiritual, economic, and intellectual – that all Marian England could do was to await ‘the day of its deliverance’.5 Even historians who sought to bring more balance to the study of Mary, like H. F. M. Prescott (1896–1972), whose biography of the queen was largely more sympathetic, concluded that, for all her achievements and failures, the queen remained a ‘practical, housewifely little woman’ whose ‘mind was narrow and by no means acute’.6 This stereotype has been picked up by many historians after her, most notably by G. R. Elton (1921–1994), who stated in what has become a famous remark, that Mary was ‘arrogant, assertive, bigoted, stubborn, suspicious, and (not to put too fine a point on it) rather stupid’.7 The fact that some of those very same 4 James Anthony Froude, History of England: From the Fall of Wolsey to the Death of Elizabeth, vol. 6 (New York: Scribner, Armstrong, and Co., 1875), 488–95. 5 S.

Elton, Reform and Reformation: England, 1509–1558 (London: Edward Arnold, 1977), 376. Elton’s comment was remarkably similar to that made by the nineteenth-century Spanish liberal politician Fernando Garrido Tortosa (1821–1883), who claimed that Mary had been ‘stubborn, superstitious, violent, cruel, fanatical, vengeful, despotic; all her actions bore the imprint of her natural instincts and those of her husband, each being worthy of the other’. (‘Testaruda, supersticiosa, violenta, cruel, fanática, vengativa, despótica, todas sus acciones llevaron el sello de sus naturales instintos y de los de su esposo, dignos el uno del otro’). A\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n3\n\nattitudes – assertiveness, stubbornness, and suspicion – are praised when it comes to assess Elizabeth’s reign, bears witness to the one-sided scope of some of these works.8 It appears that, in this view, half of Mary’s blood was the wrong blood, she married the wrong man, she restored the wrong religion, she chose the wrong war, and she wrongly murdered her own people. Little did it matter that Elizabeth similarly failed to secure the succession, that her own establishment of what she conceived as the right religion brought new divisions, tensions and persecutions within English society; that she involved herself in foreign wars which depleted her treasury and could have cost her dearly or that, like her sister Mary – and all other rulers of their time – she had a tendency to execute those subjects who conspired or rebelled against her.9 Mary was a tragic, sad, abandoned and misguided woman, or a cruel and bloodthirsty tyrant who tried to avoid the inevitable by establishing a backward reaction and releasing her kingdom into the hands of the greedy and tyrannical Spaniards. Often, these two views are made to coincide. The queen’s attempts to forestall the English Reformation have been interpreted as a mere interruption in Britain’s glorious path to Protestantism; they failed due to their medieval impetus, their clumsy cruelty, and their pathetic emptiness. Most traditional historiographical approaches to Philip and Mary’s reign saw it, therefore, as a glitch in England’s history. It was perceived as an unmitigated and un-English disaster\n\nfierce opponent of any ecclesiastical intervention in state affairs, it is noteworthy that Garrido Tortosa, when treating Thomas Cranmer’s death, described the archbishop of Canterbury as a great persecutor himself, dismissing his gesture of burning the hand with which he had signed his recantation as mere hypocrisy. See Alfonso Torres de Castilla (pseudonym of Fernando Garrido Tortosa), Historia de las persecuciones políticas y religiosas, ocurridas en Europa desde la Edad Media hasta nuestros días, vol. 4 (Barcelona: Salvador Manero, 1865), 285–90, 297. 8 Many historians have made the assumption that Mary was intent on forcing her subjects to accept Spanish rule and Catholicism despite their patriotic resistance, which could only bring about the failure that the regime turned out to be. See, for instance, A. G. Dickens, The English Reformation [1964] (London and Glasgow: Collins/Fontana, 1972), 355–85; Loades, Reign of Mary, 458–72. 9 In the aftermath of the Northern Rebellion of 1569 alone, Elizabeth I ordered the execution by hanging, drawing, and quartering of 450 to 600 people (accounts differ on the numbers), the smaller figure being considerably larger than the number of people executed under Philip and Mary’s heresy laws (284). See K. J. Kesselring, The Northern Rebellion of 1569: Faith, Politics, and Protest in Elizabethan England (Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2007), 119–43. To those figures should be added the persecution of Catholics through fines, imprisonment, and death throughout the reign. The persecution and punishment of dissent was a common feature of early modern rulership, not a Marian peculiarity.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\nby those who understood the English Reformation as ‘a movement of national liberation’, to use Alexander Samson’s apt expression.10 Apart from their apparent misogyny, these negative views were steeped in a long tradition which attacked the reign through the lenses of a growing Protestant national sentiment that saw Mary’s life and reign as inimical to true English political, religious, and social values. The roots of this perception stemmed from contemporary understandings of the reign as propounded by Protestant critics. The Scottish clergyman John Knox, (c.1514–1572), who was busy destabilising the regime of Mary, Queen of Scots and her mother, Mary of Guise, published a treatise in 1558, his famous The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, which sought to prove that female rule was against God’s laws. Although he did not shy away from criticising his own sovereign and her mother and regent, the main target of his work was Queen Mary of England. Knox explained that ‘it is a thing moste repugnant to nature, to Goddes will and apointed ordinance, […] that a woman should be promoted to dominion or empire to reigne ouer man, be it in realme, natio[n], prouince or citie’. Female rule, he concluded, was ‘a thing plainlie repugnant to good ordre, yea it is the subuersion of the same’.11 There could be no better proof of this than Queen Mary, the ‘cursed Iesabel of Engla[n]d’, a ‘horrible monstre’ who had usurped authority in England against God’s Word and had delivered her kingdom and people to ‘proude ministres, pestilent papistes’ and England’s ‘mortall enemie the spaniard’.12 John Foxe (1516–1587), the famous English martyrologist, published the first English edition of his Acts and Monuments (popularly known as the Book of Martyrs) in 1563, five years after Mary’s death and Elizabeth’s accession. His work would undergo four more editions between then and 1583, when the last version to be released in Foxe’s lifetime was published. Foxe was not fiercely misogynistic in the way that Knox had been, because, unlike Mary, Queen of Scots, Queen Mary of England had a suitable Protestant replacement in the person of her sister Elizabeth, who was also, of course, a woman. Foxe was also careful not to be too critical of Mary herself, as this would have a negative impact on the crown which Elizabeth now incarnated and could bring negative attention to himself from the new queen too. By his 1570 edition, however, he had begun to include a reassessment of the reign with a description 10\n\nAlexander Samson, Mary and Philip: The Marriage of Tudor England and Habsburg Spain (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2020), 222. 11 John Knox, The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrvovs Regiment of Women (1558), f. 26r–v. 12 Knox, First Blast, ff. 32r, 55r, 56r.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n5\n\nof Mary’s last days and death which have coloured all subsequent approaches to the reign. First, the chapter’s title promised to recount to the reader ‘the vnprosperous successe of thinges vnder Queene Mary’ and proceeded to explain the ‘great afflictions’ which had befallen the realm during her reign, ‘wherin so many me[n], women, and children were burned, many imprisoned and in prisons starued, diuers exiled, some spoyled of goods and possessions’.13 In Mary’s time, he added, children were made fatherless and fathers were deprived of their wives and children. England, however, had been delivered of this ‘bloudy persecution’ when Mary died on 17 November 1558. Foxe’s description of Mary’s last hours is full of some of the tropes that have formed the basis of Mary’s reputation as a sad and tragic figure. Many thought that ‘she dyed of thought and sorow’ and, when asked by her close confidants if her sadness was due to Philip’s abandonment, she retorted that ‘Not that onely […] but when I am dead & opened, you shall find Calyce [Calais] lying in my hart’.14 Foxe claimed that the exchange had taken place between the queen and her trusted servants and friends David ap Rhys and Susan Clarencieux, and that he had heard it first-hand from someone who had in turn heard it first-hand from Ap Rhys. This dramatic anecdote is no more than courtly gossip conveyed eleven years later by an author who was ostensibly hostile to Mary and her regime and is far from being historical fact, yet it has come to represent the accepted version of Mary’s reign – tragic, futile, sad. However, Foxe’s boldest statement was reserved for his conclusion on Mary’s ‘vnprosperous’ reign: Of which Queene this truly may be affirmed and left in story for a perpetuall memoriall or epitaph, for all Kinges and Queenes that shall succede her to be noted, that before her neuer was read in story of any Kyng or Queene in England since the tyme of kyng Lucius, vnder whom in tyme of peace, by hangyng, headyng, burnyng, and prisoning, so much Christian bloud, so many Englishmens liues were spilled within this Realme, as vnder the sayd Queene Mary for the space of foure yeares was to be seene, and I besech the Lord neuer may be seene hereafter.15 Mary was a negative mirror image in which her sister, and all future English monarchs, could reflect themselves. To do the contrary of what Mary had done 13\n\nJohn Foxe, The First Volume of the Ecclesiasticall history contaynyng the Actes and Monu­ mentes of thynges passed in eyery kynges tyme in this Realme, especially in the Church of England principally to be noted (…) (London: John Day, 1570) [henceforth A&M, 1570], 2336. 14 A&M, 1570, 2336–7. 15 A&M, 1570, 2337.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\nwas a recipe for success. It did not matter that Philip and Mary’s regime did not see Protestantism as a peaceful endeavour, but as a heretical rebellion which brought dissension to the realm (as we shall see), nor that a quick glance at the numbers of those executed during or in the aftermaths of the Pilgrimage of Grace under Henry VIII (216), the Prayer Book rebellion under Edward VI (more than 4,000), or the Rising of the North under Elizabeth I (450 to 650) – to give but a few examples in which religion was unmistakably a factor – were either similar or greatly surpassed the number of victims of Philip and Mary’s campaign against heresy (284).16 This coupling of Mary and Philip to a ‘bloody’ reputation was not immediately taken for granted, however. In fact, the first instance of the term Bloody Mary does not appear until 1658, in a work titled The Infancy of the World by the Presbyterian minister Nicholas Billingsley (1633–1709). In his poem, ‘The Praise of Nothing’, Billingsley pondered about the futility of some of humankind’s undertakings and, after wondering what had become of William the Conqueror’s feats, he asked himself ‘Where’s bloody Mary, and Elizabeth, / Of blessed memory, but kil’d by death’.17 The efforts of great princes may be futile in the face of death and the passing of time, but whereas Elizabeth’s legacy was one ‘of blessed memory’ Mary’s was ‘bloody’. In 1681 the cleric Gilbert Burnet (1641–1715) would claim that her reign had opened the eyes of the English to the cruelty of ‘popery’ and the ‘uneasie Yoak of Spanish Government’. He continued: The Genius of the English leads them to hate Cruelty and Tyranny; and when they saw these were the necessary Concomitants of Popery, no wonder it was thrown with so general an agreement, that there was scarce any considerable Opposition made to it, except by some few of their Clergy.18 16\n\nMadeleine Hope Dodds and Ruth Dodds, The Pilgrimage of Grace, 1536–1537 and the Exeter Conspiracy, 1538, vol.

H. for Richard Chiswell, 1683), preface and 370–71.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n7\n\nThe inherent cruelty of the Catholic religion, of the primacy of Rome and of Spanish rule were, therefore, elements of Philip and Mary’s reign which went against the very nature of the English. This, in turn, explained why, from Burnet’s perspective, they had not survived. The English had a particular sixth sense, a ‘genius’ that allowed them to discern good government, which other peoples did not possess. The trend continued unabated and, by the early nineteenth century, this version was so widespread that it was used as ammunition in polemics against Catholic Emancipation in 1826.19 In 1851, the English nonconformist Edwin Paxton Hood (1820–1885) wrote a scathing biography of the queen, ominously titled The Dark Days of Queen Mary, in which he stated that anyone who found ‘any redeeming points’ in Mary’s character ‘must have sharp eyes, or a moral squint’.20 As Isabel of Castile’s granddaughter, Catherine of Aragon’s daughter, and Charles V’s cousin, it was no wonder that Mary had always turned to Spain. She was, Hood contended, ‘by temperament and character more truly Spanish than English’.21 Philip and Mary had been a perfect match in their ‘cruel and most unscrupulous advancement of the Roman Catholic Cause’ and in their ‘gloomy, morose, ascetic’ characters.22 The unnatural connection established by Mary with the land of her maternal ancestors had made the queen as unpopular as her ‘Smithfield fires’ and ‘extortion and knavery were the leading principles of her political, as persecution and Popery were of her religious policy’. These negative characteristics often went together and Spanish history, Hood claimed, ‘most abundantly illustrates this’.23 Not all assessments of Mary and her reign were entirely negative, however, and scholars like Patrick Fraser Tytler (1791–1849), the Strickland sisters, Agnes (1796–1874) and Elizabeth (1794–1875), or Sir Frederick Madden (1801–73), all provided positive accounts of the queen’s character and reign, even if they condemned the persecution or her marriage to Philip.24 The works by J. M. Stone 19 See, for instance, the anonymous pamphlet An Address to Electors, on Their Duty as Englishmen, or the Triumph of British Right over Infidel & Papal Tyranny (Whitby: R. Rodgers, 1826), 3. 20 Edwin Paxton Hood, The Dark Days of Queen Mary (London: Partridge & Oakey, 1851), 209. 21 Hood, Dark Days, 87. 22 Hood, Dark Days, 108–9. 23 Hood, Dark Days, 117–8. 24 Patrick Fraser Tytler, England under the Reigns of Edward VI, and Mary, with the Contem­ porary History of Europe, Illustrated in a Series of Original Letters Never Before Printed.

Explaining away the reign in Whiggish teleological terms as an ‘interlude’ before the arrival of true Protestant English values would simply not do anymore. D. M. Loades (1934–2016) began his lifelong work on the queen and her reign with the publication, in 1965, of his study of the Wyatt rebellion and the Dudley conspiracy, in which he claimed that although Mary had many good qualities and, indeed, good policies, her decision to marry Philip gave ground to widespread opposition which the regime never managed to dilute. It was the first of a series of wrong decisions which undid what had started as a promising reign.26 Loades’ next major contribution was his The Reign of Mary Tudor (1979), which provided a comprehensive account of the reign with an outstanding use of domestic and foreign primary material. His conclusions, however, were still coloured by the traditional historiographical assumption that the marriage to Philip and the persecution were disastrous policies which cost the queen her popularity, a thesis that Loades always maintained with little variation.27 Other significant contributions were made, among many others, by Jennifer Loach (1945–1995) and Robert Tittler, who argued for Mary’s capability in managing parliament, council and court, and Eamon Duffy, John Edwards, Christopher Haigh, Peter Marshall, Rex Pogson, and William Wizeman\n\nvol. 5 (London: Henry Colburn, 1842), 382, 420–22.

Among them, for example, is the realisation that Elizabeth’s language of power and conceptualisation of her authority owed more to Mary than has been hitherto recognised. Many of the symbols, imagery, gestures, and words chosen by Elizabeth were greatly influenced by her elder sister’s experience.29 In these new explorations of Mary’s life and reign, the sad, abandoned housewife or the cruel, murderous tyrant of previous centuries disappeared, and a new Mary emerged. England’s first queen regnant had received a careful humanist education and from a very young age she had been exposed to the intricacies of power and court intrigue, especially after Henry VIII’s repudiation of Catherine of Aragon. She had fiercely defended her right to hear the Latin Mass and eventually became the visible head of opposition against the regime of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, during the reign of her brother, Edward VI.30 She harboured Catholics and conservative malcontents and, after an aborted attempt to flee to the safety of the Spanish Netherlands in 1551, she weaved an important Catholic network that would aid her when, in 1553, Northumberland tried to seize the throne for his daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, Mary’s cousin, after Edward’s death on 6 July. In those crucial days, Mary, with help from her 28 Jennifer Loach and Robert Tittler, eds., The Mid-Tudor Polity, c. 1540–1560 (London: Macmillan, 1980); Robert Tittler, The Reign of Mary I (London: Longman, 1983); Jennifer Loach, Parliament and the Crown in the Reign of Mary Tudor (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986); Rex Pogson, ‘Revival and reform in Mary Tudor’s church: A question of money’, Journal of Ecclesiastical History, vol. 25 (1974), 249–65, Eamon Duffy, The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, c.1400–c.1580 (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992), 524–64; Christopher Haigh, English Reformations: Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), 203–34; Peter Marshall, Reformation England, 1480–1642 [2003] (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2012), 93–120; William Wizeman, SJ, The Theology and Spirituality of Mary Tudor’s Church (Aldershot and Burlington: Ashgate, 2006); William Wizeman, SJ, ‘The Religious Policy of Mary I’, in Doran and Freeman, Old and New Perspectives, 153–70.

Proclaimed queen on 19 July 1553, she triumphantly entered London on 3 August.31 This was not the meek little housewife of popular imagery, but a courageous woman and a shrewd politician who opened the path of female sovereignty in England even if that path had been full of obstacles.32 The culmination of this trend was the publication, in 2011, of Mary I: England’s Catholic Queen, John Edwards’ biography of the queen, the most comprehensive reassessment of Mary’s life to date. Philip’s figure as king of England and the insertion of England within the structure of the Spanish Monarchy remain, however, grossly underexplored. For centuries, Philip’s reign in England has been widely ignored in the historiographical debate. Although Martin A. S. Hume (1847–1910) published an article on Philip’s stay in England in 1892, the subject remained largely unknown throughout most of the twentieth century.33 When the king’s figure attracted the attention of historians, it was usually to point out his inadequacy as a partner for Mary and his unworthiness to sit on the throne of England. In general, historians have tended to see the Spanish marriage as a great mistake for the Marian regime, a view epitomised in Owen Chadwick’s (1916–2015) conclusion that it was ‘the most disastrous act of the reign’.34 Henry Kamen, in his 1997 work Philip of Spain, claimed that Philip was largely uninterested in English domestic affairs and that during his first stay in England he ‘devoted himself closely to the politics of Spain, Italy and America’.35 For all its richness in primary sources, the late Manuel Fernández Álvarez’s (1921–2010) 1998 31 Edwards, Mary I, 87–122; Loades, Reign of Mary, 70–4; insight into the same events from the point of view of Lady Jane Grey is provided in Eric Ives, Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), 248–78 and Leanda de Lisle, The Sisters Who Would Be Queen: The Tragedy of Mary, Katherine and Lady Jane Grey (London: Harper Press 2008), 112–24. 32 Two of the most recent biographies of the queen, which seek to bring balance into the debate are those by Linda Porter, The First Queen of England: The Myth of “Bloody Mary” (Great Britain: Portrait, 2007), re-edited as Mary Tudor: The First Queen (London: Piaktus, 2009), and Anna Whitelock, Mary Tudor: England’s First Queen (London: Bloomsbury, 2009). A recent reassessment of the queen’s life and reign is that by the French scholar Isabelle Fernandes, who has also stressed Mary’s courage and the effect of Protestant propaganda in the blackening of her name. See Isabelle Fernandes, Marie Tudor. La souffrance du pouvoir (Paris: Tallandier, 2012). John Edwards has also published a short biography of the queen in recent years. See his Mary I: The Daughter of Time (London: Allen Lane, 2016). 33 Martin A. S.

La gran reina desconocida (2008), a rather conventional account of the Anglo-Spanish marriage was presented which added little to the historiographical debate; it portrays Philip as the indifferent husband who unscrupulously abandoned his ailing wife.37 Sarah Duncan has brilliantly reconstructed the world, the court, and the gendered spaces inhabited, negotiated and manipulated by Mary, but her conclusions on Philip’s alleged limited role owe much to previous assumptions that the measures designed to curtail his power in 1554 were still in place at the end of the reign in 1558.38 In similar vein, and despite his incisive exploration of the complexities of the reign, David Loades considered that Philip, as king of England, had been a ‘failure’.39 An attempt has recently been made by Harry Kelsey to bring Philip back to the limelight in the English context. His 2012 work, Philip of Spain, King of England: The Forgotten Sovereign deserves praise for the pains taken to go back to the Spanish original manuscripts, avoiding too heavy a reliance on the translations of the Calendars. His conclusions, however, are disappointing, as he claimed that Philip’s role as king of England was not as successful as it could have been because he ‘could not bring himself to accept a secondary role’ and because his training had not taught him ‘that a king should love his wife’.40 Royal marriages in the early modern period were not made in the pursuit of personal happiness and romantic love as understood in the twenty-first century, but with the aim of obtaining diplomatic, political, financial, and dynastic advantages. This was perfectly understood by Philip. The king’s confidant, Ruy Gómez de Silva, explained unchivalrously in a letter to Francisco de Eraso, Charles V’s secretary, that Queen Mary was old and thin and, to add to his caddish remarks, he lamented that ‘much help from God will be needed to swallow this cup’. However, after this salacious comment about his master’s sexual life, he felt compelled to explain that, fortunately, ‘the king sees and understands 36 Manuel Fernández Álvarez, Felipe II y su tiempo [1998] (Pozuelo de Alarcón: Espasa, 2006), 741–59. 37 María Jesús Pérez Martín, María Tudor.

The epitome of this perceived slackness on Philip’s part is an often-quoted passage that he wrote to his sister Juana, dowager princess of Portugal and regent of Spain, on 4 December 1558, after he received the news of Mary’s death. These lines were translated by Royall Tyler (1884–1953) as follows: The Calais question cannot be settled so soon, now that the Queen, my wife, is dead. May God have received her in His glory! I felt a reasonable regret for her death. I shall miss her, even on this account. I have given my agreement to the prolongation of the truce, in order not to break off with the French.42 This quotation, with special emphasis on the words ‘reasonable regret for her death’, has been repeatedly inserted in works dealing with Philip and Mary’s reign – both academic and popular – and has become the point of reference to assess their marriage, relationship, and joint rule.43 In many ways, it has come to be a metaphor for the reign, often used as one of the closing statements in works surveying the topic to stress, in Foxe-like fashion, the alleged failure of Mary’s undertakings. She had fought against her councillors and her people and had faced a dangerous rebellion to marry a man who not only 41 AGS, Estado 808, leg. 143.

The whole affair, some of these works seem to tell us, can only be seen as an episode that we should reasonably regret. This dramatic quotation, which has proven so popular is, in fact, a mistranslation. Tyler took the Spanish expression quanto es razón, which conveys a meaning of justice or righteousness, to mean ‘reasonable’, and he mistook the transitive construction hará falta (to need someone or something) for the transitive locution echar en falta (to notice the absence of someone or something, to miss). A more accurate rendition of Philip’s remarks would be: The question of Calais could not be negotiated quickly, especially now that the most serene queen, my wife, is dead. May she be in God’s glory, for I have felt it as much as is to be expected and even in this matter I would have much needed her. I therefore resolved to agree in the said suspension in order not to break the talks, leaving them thus pending.44 It may not be an outpouring of emotion on the death of a spouse, but Philip’s letters seldom were. Furthermore, the letter does not only indicate the king’s commitment to the retrieval of Calais (a commitment not reciprocated by the privy council or, as it would turn out, by Queen Elizabeth herself) but also that he had been saddened by Mary’s death and, crucially, that in the negotiations with the French which would eventually lead to the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559, he ‘would have much needed her’. This suggests that the couple had enjoyed a good political partnership and that their co-monarchy had been a success. In fact, throughout their marriage, there was only one irreconcilable disagreement between the two when Philip insistently sought to marry off Elizabeth to his cousin, Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy and Mary, surprisingly, sided with her sister and prevented the wedding from happening.45 44 AGS, Estado 516, leg. 86; King Philip to Juana of Austria, Monastery of Grunendal, 4 December 1558: ‘[…] Visto que lo de calés no se podía negoçiar tan presto espeçialmente con ser Muerta la ser[enísi]ma reyna mi muger que aya gloria que lo he sentido quanto es razón que aun para esto me hará mucha falta, me ha paresçido de venir en lo de la dicha suspensión por no romper la plática y que quede todavía pendiente […]’. 45 It is unclear why Mary refused to contemplate Elizabeth’s marriage. In a heartfelt letter, Mary explained to her husband that she had been against a marriage for Elizabeth ever since her sister had been born and that she did not understand Philip’s insistence, although she did not provide further details as to why she would not contemplate it. When Philip returned to England in 1557, he tried again in person and also through his sister Margaret of Parma and his cousin Christina of Denmark, but Mary’s opposition and Elizabeth’s strong refusal made him desist. Whether Mary could not contemplate the daughter of Anne Boleyn bearing the children that she had been unable to conceive,\n\n14\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\nPerhaps Philip and Mary’s marriage had not been the love match of the century, but in sixteenth-century high politics that was hardly a concern. What mattered was what Philip’s words suggest; that is, that the brief union of the English and Spanish crowns had been successful. Besides, there is no reason to believe that they did not enjoy a good personal relationship. Despite the age difference – Mary was eleven years Philip’s senior – and Ruy Gómez de Silva’s and others’ uncharitable comments about Mary’s looks, there is no indication in Philip’s correspondence that he was displeased by her, and we know that she was very happy with him.46 After the wedding it was reported that the king was most solicitous to his new wife and they were seen being affectionate and warm towards each other in public. It is again Silva, and again not very tastefully, who reports on this, as he claimed that the king, entertains the queen very well and he knows how to ignore that which is not very good in her for the senses of the flesh. He keeps her so happy that the other day, them being alone, she uttered love words to him, and he corresponded in like fashion.47 Stories have circulated about Philip’s alleged indiscretions. One such account is Philip’s attempt to reach Lady Magdalen Dacre with his hand through a window whilst she was washing, an advance that Lady Dacre would have rejected\n\nor whether she was trying to find ways to disinherit her sister is difficult to know, but the disagreement caused a great deal of tension between the spouses. By refusing to force Elizabeth into the marriage with the duke of Savoy, Mary lost her last chance to ensure that England would remain within the Catholic and Spanish spheres of influence. Edwards, Mary I, 323–4; Samson, Mary and Philip, 174–5. 46 Philip seems never to have made his thoughts known on the matter, one way or the other. Ruy Gómez de Silva clearly found Mary irredeemably unattractive, but others did not agree. In 1557, when she was forty-one, the Venetian ambassador, Giovanni Michieli, wrote that ‘[h]er face is well formed, as shown by her features and lineaments, and as seen by her portraits. When younger she was considered, not merely tolerably handsome, but of beauty exceeding mediocrity. At present, with the exception of some wrinkles, caused more by anxieties than by age, which makes her appear some years older, her aspect, for the rest, is very grave’. See CSP Venice, vol. 6, 1054. In any case, the physical attributes of either wife or husband, which are subjective anyway, would not have precluded them from having a good marital relationship. 47 AGS, Estado 808, leg. 143; Ruy Gómez de Silva to Francisco de Eraso, Richmond, 12 August 1554: ‘el rrey […] entretiene muy bien a la rreyna y sabe muy bien pasar lo q[ue] no es bueno en ella para la sensualidad de la carne y tiénela tan contenta q[ue] çierto estando el otro día ellos dos a solas casi le dezía ella amores y él rrespondía por los consonantes’.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n15\n\nby striking him with a stick.48 We are also told that in 1557, in a fit of jealousy for the deference and affection that Philip showed his cousin Christina of Denmark, dowager duchess of Lorraine, who was then visiting in London, Queen Mary tore one of his portraits to pieces with her own hands.49 Neither of these stories are, however, contemporary to the events they refer to. The anecdote that involves Philip and Lady Dacre only surfaced for the first time in the 1609 biography of the latter, who was to become Viscountess Montague, written by Richard Smith (1568–1655), titular bishop of Chalcedon. Not only had Smith been born fourteen years after the event he alleged had taken place between King Philip and Lady Dacre but, also, both Philip and the lady in question were dead by the time the biography was published. With regards to the episode of Mary’s alleged destruction of Philip’s portrait in a fit of jealousy, it was recounted by the Strickland sisters in 1842, who in turn quoted James Granger’s (1723–1776) A Biographical History of England.50 Granger recounts the anecdote as coming from The Life of Sir Thomas Pope (1772) by Thomas Warton (1728–1790) but, although Warton does mention Mary’s jealousy towards Philip’s relationship with Christina of Denmark, he does not mention the portrait episode.51 Even if we allowed for the veracity of these two anecdotes, and to take them at face value would be a stretch of the historian’s endeavour, given their problematic origins, this would still not necessarily mean that Philip and Mary did not enjoy a fulfilling personal relationship as husband and wife. Not only did they share a common Spanish heritage, but they were also both very devout Catholics and had a keen interest in religion and theology. The pair had received careful humanist educations and were enthusiastic patrons of the arts. There is also plenty of evidence that they revelled in dances, parties and other court ceremonies and they both had a very strong sense of duty which translated in an indefatigable work ethic – the two of them sat at their desks to transact business for hours every day, sometimes working into the early hours of the morning.52 48 Richard Smith, The Life of the Most Honovrable and Vertvovs Lady the Lady Magdalen Viscovntesse Montagve, trans.

This was no mere royal marriage, but a true union of the Spanish and English crowns. It is time to eschew the title of ‘king consort’ which the literature usually ascribes to Philip, for it represents a concept that did not exist, as their rulership was conceived and enacted as a joint-monarchy. This was acknowledged by contemporaries, as we shall see, and reflected in parliamentary acts, which included both monarchs’ names together with their respective regnal years.53 This was the case because Philip was not a ‘prince consort’ in the way that husbands of regnant queens have been in the United Kingdom since the reign of Queen Anne (r. 1702–1714), mainly carrying out ceremonial and supportive roles. Nor was he a ‘king consort’ (rey consorte) like Francisco de Asís de Borbón (1822–1902) was to Queen Isabel II of Spain (r. 1833–1868) in the nineteenth century, a courtesy title for the queen’s husband who, besides some ceremonial and patronage duties, had little else to do in an official capacity.54 It is important to remember that, at the time of Philip’s accession to the throne of Spain in 1556, when he was already married to Mary, theirs was the fifth consecutive co-monarchy in the Spanish kingdoms. Mary’s grandparents and Philip’s great-grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabel (r. 1474–1504), were followed by Philip I and Juana I (r. 1504–1506), then by Juana and Ferdinand (r. 1506–1516) and, finally, by Juana and Charles (r. 1516–1555). Even if the latter two associations had been legally dubious and formed by a father and daughter and mother and son respectively, rather than by husband and wife like the first two, it is telling that Philip and Mary’s marriage was conceived in the way that it was and at the time that it was. Mary’s childless death in 1558 ended the trend, and theirs was Spain’s last co-monarchy. Not so, however, in England, where the last was formed by William III and Mary II (r. 1689–1694). Although this second joint rulership was engendered in very different circumstances\n\n53\n\n54\n\ntransacts business incessantly, until after midnight, when she retires to rest; for she chooses to give audience not only to all the members of her Privy Council, and to hear from them every detail of public business, but also to all other persons who ask it of her’. That it was conceived in this way is borne out by the existence of King Philip’s portrait which adorns the Prince’s Chamber in the House of Lords, occupying the place that corresponds him in the gallery of portraits of Tudor monarchs between Mary and Elizabeth. The decoration of the Prince’s Chamber was undertaken in 1854 by the students of the Royal School of Art, under the direction of Richard Burchett. I am grateful to the Baroness Hooper, who pointed out to me the existence of this portrait and kindly invited me to visit the House of Lords to see it for myself in October 2013.

Una biografía (Madrid: Taurus, 2010), passim but especially 203–7, 223–30, 429–46, 749–55.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n17\n\nand had very different aims, it is nevertheless noteworthy that the only two co-monarchies that England has ever had have both been with rulers of the Low Countries. This fact is crucial to understand the motivations for Philip and Mary’s marriage. Indeed, the link to the Low Countries was very attractive for both parties. For Spain, a firm alliance with England ensured that the Netherlandish inheritance would remain in Spanish hands. For England, the cultural and commercial ties with their neighbours from across the Channel would be strengthened and, if children were born of the marriage, they would be poised to inherit England, Ireland, and the Low Countries (and if Philip’s son, the Infante Carlos, died, the whole Spanish inheritance, too). The marriage was also crucial to Spain because the acquisition of England and Ireland added new territories to the Habsburgs’ expansive monarchy. In this sense, perhaps the most incisive of early modern Protestant criticisms of the marriage came amidst the debates surrounding another – ultimately failed – Anglo-Spanish match, that between Charles Stuart, prince of Wales, heir to James VI and I (r. 1603–1625) and the Infanta María Ana of Spain, sister to Philip IV of Spain (r. 1621–1665). In John Reynolds’ (c.1588–c.1625) Vox Cœli, or Newes from Heaven (1624), an imaginary party composed of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Henry Stuart, prince of Wales, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and Anne of Denmark get together in heaven to discuss the convenience of the Spanish match of 1623. Reynolds’ fictional Mary is alone in promoting it, epitomising what was to become the predominant view in England about Spanish imperialistic designs. Here is her reply to Edward VI’s complaints about the Castilian taking of Navarre in 1512: O but Nauarre lay fit and commodious for the Prouinces of old Castile, Biscay, and Galicia, besides, the Kings of Spaine are the Catholique Kings, and therefore it is both proper and naturall for them to be Vniuersall.55 Moving on to different subjects, Mary closes one of the discussions by stating that, had she become a mother, ‘England had beene long since a Prouince of Spaine’.56 The implications of this statement are clear and, although written decades after the marriage, no one in the 1550s would have doubted that, had Mary had any children by Philip, the Tudor dynasty would have come to an 55\n\nJohn Reynolds, Vox Cœli, or Newes from Heaven, of a consvltation there held by the high and mighty Princes King Hen.8.

These points are crucial to the understanding of early modern anxieties over emerging nationalities and the concept of monarchia universalis or universal monarchy to which the Habsburgs aspired. With these remarks, Reynolds did something which a great deal of the subsequent historiography on the matter has not done; he looked at the motivations of the marriage from the Spanish point of view. Moving away from the Anglocentric views which have characterised most approaches to the topic, this book seeks to redress the imbalance enunciated in the preceding pages. There have been recent works which have looked at the reign from more positive and stimulating angles, on which this book will expand. In John Edwards’ biography of Mary, Philip is not the reluctant and helpless king consort anymore, but a young humanist prince who was active in his role as king of England. Edwards has really brought to the fore, not only that Philip was not the gloomy ogre of Protestant imagery but, also, that together with Mary he brought England back to the limelight of European politics in what he has called England’s attempt at ‘European integration’.57 Similarly, Alexander Samson has rediscovered a king who was earnestly involved in the government of England and that the reign fostered a period of creative cultural exchange between both kingdoms which would outlive the regime. England and Spain were not, Samson found, the caricature-like antagonistic enemies of old, but two countries which admired each other and exerted considerable cultural and economic influence on a mutual basis.58 Drawing from these new perspectives, the present work is the first fully to explore England’s position as an integral part of the Spanish Monarchy (commonly known as the Spanish Empire) during the reign of Philip I of England and II of Spain. The book is divided into two thematic sections, each consisting of three chapters. The first three chapters look at the conceptualisation of the Anglo-Spanish co-monarchy from the Spanish point of view and how this framing translated into different attitudes and expressions of power. This first section, therefore, pays full attention to the Spanish idea of empire, a ‘composite monarchy’ founded upon the concept of monarchia universalis (universal monarchy), and the way England was envisaged to fit within this structure. Contemporary critics of the marriage were concerned that a foreign prince would alter the laws and customs of the realm, yet the Habsburgs were very 57 Edwards, Mary I, passim but especially 159–225. 58 Samson, Mary and Philip, passim. Other relevant reassessments of the joint reign that have looked at it in the wider European context are to be found in, for instance, M. J. Rodríguez-Salgado, The Changing Face of Empire: Charles V, Philip II and Habsburg Authority, 1551–1559 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 79–94, 183–5, 305–25 and Parker, Imprudent King, 41–58.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n19\n\naware of national sensibilities and the need to preserve local laws to ensure the correct functioning of the Monarchy by avoiding dissent and rebellion. This realisation stemmed, in part, from the anxieties born out of the Comunero revolt that Charles V had faced in 1520–1521 but, also, from the ideological foundations of the Habsburg conceptualisation of the Spanish Monarchy, which recognised in the king of Spain the best candidate for universal monarchy. This concept and the notions of community which influenced it are given full attention in the first chapter. In February 1554, Mary faced a rebellion which was ostensibly aimed at preventing her marriage to Philip. Commonly known as the Wyatt rebellion after one of its main leaders, Sir Thomas Wyatt, it actually involved four different rebellions in the south of England which ultimately failed. The rebels always claimed that they had risen against the idea of having a foreign king because they understood it as an invasion and an alteration of England’s laws and customs. The rebels’ Protestant credentials, however, have not received the attention they deserve but they have been fully addressed in the second chapter. There also exists a myth that the coexistence between the Spanish and the English once the marriage took place in July 1554, was marred by constant conflict and violence. The two nations were, in this view, simply not destined to understand each other. Although it is undeniable that there were clashes between both nations, there was also plenty of room for friendship and collaboration too and this topic is explored thoroughly in the same chapter, including a survey of the Anglo-Spanish commission of justice that was set up to quell discord. Finally, in the third chapter, the Anglo-Spanish court that emerged from the marriage is given full attention. Representations of Philip are studied to show how he was depicted and imagined as king of England. There is a persisting view that Philip’s capacity to exert patronage had been seriously curtailed in the marriage treaty and that, therefore, he was somewhat isolated from his English courtiers. In this chapter this view is challenged to show that he not only exerted patronage, but, also, that this patronage extended into Elizabeth I’s reign. Other topics which are also investigated in this section include diplomatic relations and the place of England in Spanish diplomacy, the campaign to win over those who had originally been against the Spanish marriage and the creation of the select council. The second thematic section of the book looks at the religious aspects of the reign. The secular aspiration to universal monarchy of the Habsburgs was underpinned by the association of Spain to the Catholic Church, the ecclesia universalis (universal Church). The most important task faced by Philip as king of England was to reconcile the kingdom to Rome. England had been in schism since Henry VIII had first defied the papacy in the 1530s and bringing her back\n\n20\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\nto the Catholic fold was Philip and Mary’s most pressing matter, a challenge they surmounted in an emotional ceremony of reconciliation in parliament on 30 November 1554. In 1561, three years after Mary’s death and the end of his reign in England, Philip reminisced that it had been thanks to his actions as king that God had granted the great gift of opening the eyes of the English ‘and thus subduing that kingdom, in our time and through our hand, to the true path and to obedience and union with the Holy Roman Church’.59 A few years later, in 1570, in the context of Elizabeth I’s excommunication by Pope Pius V (r. 1566–72), and displeased that the pope had kept him in the dark about the process, Philip would repeat the claim. In an incensed letter to the duke of Alba he explained his frustration at the bull’s narrative: When referring to how that kingdom was subdued and the subsequent obedience it gave to the Apostolic See in times of Queen Mary, my wife (may she be in glory), he only mentions her, without mentioning me when, as you know, I was the head and main instrument in that affair.60 These assertions by King Philip will be put to the test in the fourth chapter of the book, with an extensive exploration of his role and agency in the process of reconciliation with Rome. If A. G. Dickens claimed that Mary ‘failed to discover the Counter-Reformation’ and Eamon Duffy that her regime, in a sense, ‘invented’ it, this book will argue that the reforming and vibrant impetus of Marian Catholicism owed much to the Spanish element present within it.61 Although the religious aspects of the reign were absolutely central to the 59 François Mignet, Histoire de Marie Stuart, vol. 1 (Paris: Bonaventure et Ducessois, 1852), 444: ‘[…] lo qual dimos por bien empleado con la merced que Dios nos havía hecho en abrir los ojos a los de aquel reino y haverse reducido, en nuestro tiempo y por nyestro medio, al verdadero camino y a la obediencia y gremio de la Santa Iglesia Romana […]’. 60 AGS, Estado 544, leg. 21, King Philip to Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, duke of Alba, El Escorial, 30 June 1570: ‘Y no menos ay bien que mirar en la forma del Breue de la priuación de la Reyna, señaladamente en la narrativa, que tratando de la reductión que se hizo de aquel Reyno y la obediencia que dio a la sede Ap[ostóli]ca en tiempo de la Reyna María, mi mujer que aya Gloria, hace mención della solam[en]te y ninguna de mí, hauiendo sido yo la cabeça y el principal Instrumento (como sabéis) […]’. For the excommunication process and Philip’s reaction to it see Gonzalo Velasco Berenguer, ‘Reigning in the Highest Places: The Excommunication of Queen Elizabeth I in Its Roman and Spanish Contexts’, Sixteenth Century Journal, 51, no. 3 (2020), 763–90. The most comprehensive analysis of the excommunication and its implications in England is the to be found in Aislinn Muller, The Excommunication of Elizabeth I: Faith, Politics, and Resistance in Post-Reformation England, 1570–1603 (Leiden: Brill, 2020). 61 Dickens, English Reformation, 384; Eamon Duffy, Fires of Faith: Catholic England under Mary Tudor (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2009), 207.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n21\n\nmonarchical project of Philip and Mary, their study has also suffered from the Anglocentric lens that has been used to study the secular aspects of the reign. Paradoxically, even though the presence of Spanish theologians in England has generally been acknowledged, their roles have been strangely neglected. The study of Marian religiosity has been characterised by its focus on a supposed insularity of the Catholicism revitalised by Mary and it has even been claimed that it imported no foreign ideas.62 Some works, however, have strongly questioned these views. José Ignacio Tellechea Idígoras (1928–2008) dedicated his life to the research of Bartolomé de Carranza (1503–1576), the famous archbishop of Toledo who would be embroiled in a decades-long inquisitorial process and was a key figure in the revitalisation of Catholicism under Philip and Mary. John Edwards has expanded on this topic and, from their research, Carranza’s centrality in religious matters during the reign has been firmly established.63 However, very little is known of the other Spanish men who were in England and, in one way or another, contributed to Marian Catholicism – men like the Franciscan Alfonso de Castro (1495–1558), who wrote two of the most utilised contemporary manuals against heresy, and the Dominicans Pedro de Soto (1493–1563) and Juan de Villagarcía (1529–1564), both lecturers at Oxford. Full attention is given to the theology that these men brought to England and its links and similarities with the theology of their English counterparts in the fifth chapter. Finally, the book deals with the approaches taken by Philip and Mary’s regime to tackle the problem of heresy. The persecution of Protestants has been central to most assessments of the reign and it will be, therefore, crucial, to explore the full extent of Spanish influence and involvement in it and the ramifications of such an involvement. As is well known, and as dramatically recounted by John 62 Ellen A. Macek, The Loyal Opposition: Tudor Traditionalist Polemics, 1535–1558 (New York: Peter Lang, 1996), 163–84; Lucy E. C. Wooding, Rethinking Catholicism in Reformation England (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 150–1, 179–80. 63 Among Tellechea’s many findings was the fact that Carranza was not only active in the restoration, but he also influenced and was in turn influenced by the religiosity of Marian England. His blueprint for a visitation of the diocese of Toledo, for instance, was extremely similar to the visitation process envisaged by the English Synod of 1556 and this, in turn, had been heavily influenced by Tridentine guidelines. See José Ignacio Tellechea Idígoras, Fray Bartolomé Carranza y el Cardenal Pole. Un navarro en la restauración católica de Inglaterra (1554–1558) (Pamplona: Diputación Foral de Navarra/Institución Príncipe de Viana/Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1977), 303–51. John Edwards has surveyed Carranza’s reformed Catholicism and his plans for England in the context of its revitalisation. See John Edwards, ‘Fray Bartolomé Carranza’s Blueprint for a Reformed Catholic Church in England’, in Thomas F. Mayer, ed., Reforming Reformation (Farnham: Ashgate, 2012), 141–60.\n\n22\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\nFoxe in his Acts and Monuments, during the reign 284 men and women were sent to the flames, accused of holding heretical beliefs. Traditionally, this has been interpreted as having been as big a mistake for Mary as the Spanish marriage was and one which cost the queen and Catholicism any popularity they had left in England. Eamon Duffy argued in 2009 that, on the contrary, the persecution of religious dissent was a tested means to eradicate what was seen as a destabilising element within the community. Staying aloof from twenty-first century sensibilities, Duffy contended that, far from being a disastrous decision, the persecution worked well and was largely winning the battle against Protestantism in England by the end of Philip and Mary’s reign.64 This book expands on this topic by looking at Anglo-Spanish notions of what constituted heresy and how heretics were equated to rebels against God and prince. It is seldom noticed that, at the same time as the Marian persecution was taking place, the regency government in Spain launched its own campaign against pockets of Protestants in Valladolid and Seville.65 The persecution in Spain is, therefore, given full attention in the sixth and last chapter, for its contemporaneity to the English campaign against heresy was no mere coincidence. The reader will find no detailed assessments of the war with France and the papacy, the fall of Calais, the Dudley conspiracy, or the relationship between Philip, the Spanish, and reformed Catholicism with Ireland. The first three topics have been left out because they have already been explored elsewhere and this book had different priorities.66 The latter subject, because, unfortunately, it is beyond the scope of this study, but it is undoubtedly one of the least 64 65\n\nDuffy, Fires of Faith, 171–87. An exception to this neglect is John Edwards, who has written an article on the links between the persecution of heresy in England and in Valladolid in which he reveals, among other things, Carranza’s influence in the burning of the bones of heretics at the English universities. See John Edwards, ‘The Spanish Inquisition Refashioned: The Experience of Mary I’s England and the Valladolid Tribunal, 1559’, Hispanic Research Journal, 13, no. 1, 41–54. 66 The most incisive account of the war with France and the papacy is still that by C. S. L. Davies, ‘England and the French War, 1557–1559’, in Loach and Tittler, Mid-Tudor Polity, 159–85. Glyn Redworth has recently challenged previous claims that the participation of the English in the war was negligible in ‘Where Were the English? Antoon van den Wijngaerde, the Evidence of Visual Culture, and the 1557 Siege of Saint-Quentin’, in Ana Sáez-Hidalgo and Berta Cano-Echevarría, eds., Exile, Diplomacy and Texts: Exchanges between Iberia and the British Isles, 1500–1767 (Leiden: Brill, 2021), 15–31.

For Sir Henry Dudley’s conspiracy of 1556, although there is probably justification for a future reappraisal of the subject, see Loades, Two Tudor Conspiracies, 176–237; Loades, Reign of Mary, 234–6, 241, 245, 249, 265–6, 278, 281–2.\n\nIntroduction: A Reasonable Regret?\n\n23\n\nexplored of Philip and Mary’s reign; an absence in the historiography which deserves future redress.67 Ultimately, this book seeks to bring some much-needed balance to the historiographical debate surrounding Philip of Spain’s rule as king of England and to correct some of the misunderstandings that have marred previous interpretations of the reign. By placing England within the orbit of the Habsburgs as an integral part of the Spanish Monarchy and not as an unwilling and unnatural partner, I seek to understand the precise ideological, political, religious, and social mechanisms that the marriage set in motion. For four brief years, England and Ireland were two more of the many territories integrating the empire of the Spanish Habsburgs, and it is imperative that the reign is finally explored from this angle. This is, primarily, what this book aims to do. This work is, therefore, an historical assessment of Philip’s role as king of England and Catholic monarch and of how the crown he briefly acquired through his marriage to Mary I fitted into the wider world of the Spanish Monarchy and the Catholic Reformation. 67\n\nSome work has been done on the relationship between Catholicism and the English and Irish crowns, although the subject is still in need of further exploration and the link with Spain is still to be studied.

Ellis, Tudor Ireland: Crown, Community and the Conflict of Cultures, 1470–1603 (London and New York: Longman, 1985), 209–10.

Some of them follow the king’s party and others follow the queen’s, but the king conducts himself so well towards all of them that they are all happy with him. The emperor has always written to his son encouraging him to uphold this business, for […] the queen is a very able woman but not as much as we had been told in terms of government. The ambassador [Simon Renard] does not only leave business unsolved, but he also obstructs it. We should be enlightened by him and yet he leaves us in the dark. However, I do not blame him, but whoever sent a man of his quality to such an event as the arrangement of so important a marriage without including a Spaniard in the business.1 The picture painted by Philip’s Portuguese-born confidant and councillor has coloured subsequent interpretations of the marriage and the reign of Philip and Mary. According to this view the Spaniards were stuck in a country ridden with factions and mismanagement due to Mary’s lack of experience and good judgement and they had to deal with an inefficient and troublesome Flemish ambassador who had constantly meddled in Spanish affairs. Gómez de Silva’s 1 AGS, Estado 808, no. 141. Ruy Gómez de Silva to Francisco de Eraso; London, 23 August 1554: ‘[…] ellos se an partido como creo q[ue] tengo escrito a v[uestra] m[erced] los vnos quieren la banda del rey y los otros la de la reyna mas el rey se a también con todos q[ue] a cada vno tiene contento.

From this perspective, the negotiations were carried out entirely by Charles V and Mary, with a reluctant Philip acquiescing when the marriage was presented as a fait accompli, an attitude which set the tone for his future disregard for England and his English queen.2 The only thing that interested the English was, therefore, the links to Flanders and its commerce and the centuries-old relationship between the English crown and the House of Burgundy. Alexander Samson has recently shown this supposed marginalisation of Philip and the Spanish to be untrue. Philip’s mayordomo, Diego de Acevedo, had been in England since the late spring of 1553 and had witnessed Mary’s accession and coronation, even writing an incisive narrative of the events to his wife. In addition, Philip had sent one of his favourites, Íñigo de Mendoza y Mendoza, to congratulate Mary on her accession and to establish independent communications with her in the summer of 1553. The prince was certainly not unaware of the negotiations or their evolution.3 When Mary died in 1558, Philip instructed Gómez Suárez de Figueroa, count of Feria, who was then representing him in London, to burn all his private correspondence with the deceased queen, so it is plausible that their communications during this period were more regular than previously thought.4 A closer scrutiny also reveals a stronger Spanish influence, as we shall see. Indeed, the anxiety experienced by the English was very similar to that experienced by Castilians when Ferdinand and Isabel married in 1469, or when Charles of Ghent arrived in Spain as her king in 1517, bringing with him a large retinue of Flemings whom he quickly placed in some of the highest offices of the realm. There is therefore a glaring need to explore the extent to which recent Spanish history might have influenced the drawing up of the marriage treaty and how the Spanish idea of empire, the ‘composite monarchy’, could accommodate to English sensibilities. Unless conquered in war (and even then, the notion could be qualified), it was usually the assumption of Spanish monarchs that the union of territories was an association based on 2 See, for instance, G. R. Elton, England under the Tudors [1955] (London: Methuen, 1974), 215–18; D. M. Loades, The Reign of Mary Tudor: Politics, Government, and Religion in England, 1553–1558 (London: Ernest Benn, 1979), 111–12, 128–39. 3 Alexander Samson, Mary and Philip: The Marriage of Tudor England and Habsburg Spain (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2020), 34, 61–3. 4 In fact, the burning of private correspondence was common practice for Philip after the death of a spouse – only two personal letters from any of his four wives survive. Both are draft letters of delicate topics written by Queen Mary. See Geoffrey Parker, Imprudent King: A New Life of Philip II (New Haven and London: Yale University Press: 2014), 382.\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\nthe principle of aeque principaliter (equally important), for the sustenance of which the observance of native laws and respect for native institutions was crucial and it was in this context that Philip and Mary’s marriage, and the union of their crowns, took place.5 1.1\n\nMary’s Accession and the Centrality of Community\n\nDifferent historians have agreed that Mary’s accession saw an explosion of joy among the population of England.6 John Seton (c.1498–1567), a Catholic priest who would end his days in Rome, wrote a treatise to thank God for Mary’s victory in which he compared her to the Virgin Mary, and which included a poem to celebrate Christ’s real presence in the Eucharist. This was one among several other publications to commemorate the event.7 Even Protestants, such as Richard Taverner (1505–1575) and Richard Beeard (✝ after 1574), congratulated the queen, the latter even encouraging her to continue to ‘buyld the house, and fortresse vp / Of trewe religion’.8 In the Spanish world, the news of her victory was widely celebrated, and imperial propaganda soon set out to publish works 5 The term ‘composite monarchy’ was coined by H. G. Koenigsberger in 1975 and has been amply studied by the late John H. Elliott, who has been its most convincing supporter. See H. G. Koenigsberger, Politicians and Virtuosi: Essays in Early Modern History (London: A & C Black, 1986), 1–26; John H. Elliott, ‘A Europe of Composite Monarchies’ in his Spain, Europe & the Wider World, 1500–1800 (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2009), 3–24. 6 On the accession of Mary and her popularity see, for example, John Edwards, Mary I: England’s Catholic Queen (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2011), 98–100; Peter Marshall, Heretics and Believers: A History of the English Reformation (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2017), 359; Loades, Reign of Mary, 63–4; María Jesús Pérez Martín, María Tudor.
