He accompanied Charles III to Madrid and was appointed Minister of the Treasury. The inkwell and staff of office allude to his many Neapolitan titles, while the letter destined Alla sua maestà delle due Sicilie points to his links with the King.\n\nParadise\n\nOil on canvas. 1754 - 1757\n\nGiaquinto, Corrado\n\nCorrado Giaquinto had frequent contacts with Spain as of 1735 or earlier. But the death of Jacopo Amigoni in 1752 led to his being summoned to Madrid the next year. During his stay in the Spanish Court, he earned the highest honors given to a painter in that era. He became First Painter to the Court in August 1753 and director of the Academy of San Fernando that December. His main mission was the\n\nVisit of Queen Maria Amalia of Saxony to the Arch of Trajan in Benevento\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1759\n\nJoli, Antonio\n\nThis architectural landscape showing the ancient Roman city of Benevento, near Naples, was painted around 1759 by Antonio Joli of Modena. A painter of theatre sets and vedute, Joli worked for theatres in Venice, London and Madrid, and painted numerous scenes for private collectors, which show the influence of Giovanni Paolo Panini, Gaspare Vanvitelli and Giovanni Antonio Canal (Canaletto). In 1756\n\nSolomon worshipping Idols\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1750\n\nConca, Sebastiano\n\nDisobeying God, Solomon loved numerous women, who convinced him to turn to the idolatry of the pagan gods. These gods are here symbolized by Diana and Minerva, to whom Solomon dedicated a temple outside Jerusalem, where his wives and concubines burned incense and offered sacrifices.\n\nAbdication of Charles III\n\nOil on canvas. 1759\n\nJoli, Antonio\n\nOn August 10, 1759, Ferdinand VI died without a descendant. As a result, his stepbrother Charles, then King of Naples and Sicily, inherited the Spanish throne. The first of seven children of Philip V and his second wife Isabel Farnese, Charles VII had reigned for a period of almost 24 years in Naples. In 1738, he had married the Pricess María Amalia of Saxony, and their thirteen children we\n\n1st Marquis of La Ensenada\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1750\n\nAmigoni, Jacopo\n\nBorn in 1702, Zenón de Somodevilla y Bengoechea obtained a marquisate in 1736 following the conquest of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies for the Infante don Carlos. Quartermaster General of the Navy, in 1743 he became Secretary of State, the Treasury, and of the Army and Navy. As minister under Ferdinand VI he achieved unequalled power.

Ca. 1660\n\nGiordano, Luca\n\nIn this complex allegory, Mars, the god of war, is rejected by his lover Venus, who symbolises the peace painted by Rubens (1577-1640). On the ground at the lower edge we see objects destroyed by war: political power (the sceptre and orb); commerce or scientific knowledge (the astrolabe and armillary sphere); literature or peace treaties (a rolled-up manuscript) and diferent arts (the mask, the st\n\nJudith at the Banquet of Holofernes\n\nOil on canvas. 1634\n\nRembrandt (Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn)\n\nIn the past various authors have expressed their scepticism about the attribution of the painting to Rembrandt. However, the Rembrandt Research Project includes it in the Corpus of 1986 as an original work, and this is supported by the technical study conducted at the Museo del Prado that year. As for the signature, the unsteadiness of the stroke and, above all, the yellow colour make it dubious.\n\nFerdinand VI and Barbara of Braganza in the Gardens of Aranjuez\n\nOil on canvas. 1756\n\nBattaglioli, Francesco\n\nThis view of Aranjuez Palace was painted in 1756, on the occasion of the celebration of the saint´s day of King Fernando VI (1713-1759). This work was one of a group of views of the Palace and of the celebrations that took place there. Originally, there were probably four, but only this one and View of Aranjuez Palace (P4180, also in the Prado Museum) remain. The moment depicted here is the passag\n\nCardinal-Infante Luis Antonio of Bourbon\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1737\n\nLoo, Louis-Michel van\n\nBorn in 1727, Don Luis, son of Philip V and Isabella Farnese, was destined for an ecclesiastical career since childhood and is already shown here as a cardinal. He renounced his vows in 1754 and in 1776 his brother Charles III arranged his marriage to the young María Teresa de Vallabriga, a member of the minor nobility, with the aim of ending his numerous scandalous affairs. He was also str\n\nLouis XVI\n\nOil on canvas. 1778 - 1779\n\nCallet, Antoine-François\n\nSon of Louis Fernande, Dauphin of France, and Maria Josefina of Saxony, Louis XVI was born in 1754 and married Marie Antoinette of Austria in 1770. His father died without acceding to the throne and Louis succeeded his grandfather, Louis XV, in 1774. Arrested just prior to the proclamation of the French Republic, he was guillotined in 1793. Callet here follows Rigaud’s paintings of Louis XIV (Mus&\n\nCardinal-Infante Luis Antonio de Borbón as a Boy\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1731\n\nRanc, Jean\n\nSon of Philip V and Isabel Farnese, Louis Antonio of Bourbon was born July 25, 1727, became archbishop of Toledo on September 9, 1735, and became cardinal on December 9 of that year. In 1739, he also assumed the archbishopric of Seville. Regardless of his high ecclesiastical rank, he lacked the interest or capacity to carry out such activities, and led a life of hunting and pleasure unsuitable to\n\nThe Nativity\n\nOil on canvas. 1597\n\nBarocci, Federico\n\nThe kneeling Virgin gazes in awe at the Holy Child. Saint Joseph points to the new-born Christ, showing him to the shepherds who peer in. The scene takes place inside the barn, illuminated by the light emanating from the new-born child. The painting is not only a depiction of the birth of Jesus, but also allegorical, with the presence of the basket of bread in the foreground, as well as a sack of\n\nThe Youthful Saint John the Baptist in the Desert\n\nOil on panel. 1753 - 1754\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nPainted with remarkable delicacy, probably from life, in this panel Mengs captures the artless fascination with which the saint presents to the world the message of the Redeemer’s arrival, inscribed on the scroll. The figure’s soft luminosity reveals the influence of Correggio (1493-1534), which was decisive for the early years of Mengs’s Roman period.\n\nCharles IV and his Family honoured by the University of Valencia\n\nOil on canvas. 1802\n\nLópez Portaña, Vicente\n\nDuring his visit to Valencia in 1802, the Literary University of the city gave the King this painting which shows the university, personified as a young matron, introducing the royal family to the various faculties: Theology, Law, Philosophy and Medicine. They are accompanied by the goddess Minerva, who points to Peace, Victory and Abundance, who fly over this symbolic reception."
