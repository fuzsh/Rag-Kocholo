        "text": "In 1657, the marquis of Villagarcía was appointed as president of the Audiencia of Charcas. Although, he eventually declined the post, his nomination generated an unusual trail of private documents. Using my study of this correspondence as a base, I will discuss how the networks of patronage were built and sustained, how they operated, and how they impacted the global mobility of imperial officials. Patronage networks were indispensable to itinerant officials who relied on their clients, patrons, and brokers to help them govern distant regions by gathering resources and information, and implementing their objectives. Moreover, this particular case gives us a glimpse into the relationship between Villagarcía as husband and his wife, and the private assessments and negotiations surrounding the transatlantic journey.\n\n4.

This is not to say that there was a weakening or elimination of the power of the nobility, but that it was incorporated into the royal and imperial apparatus. In fact, the political system was based upon the idea of multiple poles of power.

The University of Salamanca and its various colegios mayores prepared hundreds of men who served in the government and administration of the empire at its various levels. Thus, people who studied there, like don Mauro, not only got the necessary preparation and knowledge for occupying imperial offices, but they also got—and perhaps this was more valuable and useful—personal connections and engaged with highly influential networks of patronage. See the various works of María Torres, Ana Carabias, “Catálogo de colegiales del Colegio Mayor de Oviedo (siglo XVI),” Studia historica. Historia moderna 3 (1985): 63–106Google Scholar; Carabias Torres,“El ‘poder’ de las letras.

Villagarcía had been appointed city councilor of Santiago in 1649 by the archbishop of the city, his brother Fernando. He went to Madrid as the second procurador, replacing don Antonio de Prada. The other representative of Galicia was José Pardo de Figueroa, who was councilor in the Council of the Indies (1652) and as a reward for serving in the Cortes was granted a seat in the Council of Castile (1659). Then, in 1664, he became president of the House of Trade. Felipe Lorenzana de la Puente, “La representación política en el Antiguo Régimen. Las Cortes de Castilla, 1655–1834” (Doctoral thesis: Universidad de Extremadura, 2010), vol. 3, 88; Víctor Viana Martínez and Juan José Clopés Burgos, El arzobispo Andrade: un vilagarcian ilustre (Vilagarcía de Arousa: Concellería de Cultura, 2004), 28.\n\n15. Sobre conceder licencia para regresar a don Francisco de Nestares Marín, Madrid, December 17, 1655, AGI, Charcas, 3. Nestares was sent to Potosí with the explicit mission of investigating a massive swindle by which millions of coins containing much less of the required silver than was legal were minted. Lane, Kris, “Corrupción y dominación colonial: el gran fraude a la Casa de la Moneda de Potosí en 1649,” Boletín del Instituto de Historia Argentina y Americana “Dr. Emilio Ravignani” 43 (2015): 94–130Google Scholar; Lane, Kris, “From Corrupt to Criminal: Reflections on the Great Potosí Mint Fraud of 1649,” in Corruption in the Iberian Empires: Greed, Custom, and Colonial Networks, Rosenmüller, Christoph, ed. (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2017), 33–61Google Scholar. Incidentally, in the many consultations related to this nomination, there is not a single mention of Nestares and the blatant corruption he was commissioned to fight. It seems that the councilors assumed that the president had finished his job and no further actions were needed.\n\n27. Fernando de Andrade y Sotomayor (born in Vistalegre in 1578; died in Santiago, January 22, 1655) was an important figure in the religious and political life of his time who came under the protection of his uncle, the powerful priest Antonio de Sotomayor, who in turn became the Inquisition's General Inquisitor (1632–1645) and was a major actor in contemporary politics. Andrade was bishop of Burgos, Sigüenza, and Santiago de Compostela (one of the few Galicians who held such post), and temporary viceroy of Navarra, even leading the military defense of that kingdom against the French attack in 1637. Andrade's efforts to advance his family reached a high point when the king granted him, shortly before his death, the marquisate of Villagarcía. Moreover, when his brother Lope de Mendoza died, Andrade took care of his orphaned nephews, don Rodrigo de Mendoza y Sotomayor (who inherited the mayorazgo in 1633 and kept it to his death in 1641) and Fernando de Mendoza, taking them with him to Burgos to educate them. Likewise, the bishop donated several of his jewels and artworks, as well as his archive and library to his relatives so that they could embellish their homes. Andrade was also the main responsible of the construction in his native Vistalegre of the church and convent of Augustinian Recollect sisters, which harbored the family mausoleum.

Nonetheless, the lack of specifics does not deny noblewomen's important role in the networks of patronage, as they could act as patrons and brokers. See Kettering, Sharon, “The Patronage Power of Early Modern French Noblewomen,” Historical Journal 32:4 (December 1989): 817–841Google Scholar; Harris, Barbara J., “Women and Politics in Early Tudor England,” Historical Journal 33:2 (1990): 259–281CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Harris, , English Aristocratic Women, 1450–1550 Marriage and Family, Property and Careers (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002)Google Scholar; Daybell, James, Women and Politics in Early Modern England, 1450–1700 (Aldershot, Hants, England: Ashgate, 2004)Google Scholar. Likewise, several women wrote to the king asking to be rewarded in their condition of widows, daughters, mothers, or sisters. See Ghirardi, M. Mónica and Vassallo, Jaqueline, eds., Tres siglos de cartas de mujeres: reedición comentada de la obra Literatura Femenina de Pedro Grenón (Buenos Aires: Ediciones CICCUS, 2010)Google Scholar.\n\n43. Alejandro Cañeque argues that the early modern understanding of friendship, which involved “mutual good will, trust, and well-wishing,” was founded on the Aristotelian discourse in which “friendship gives rise to and sustains the most long-lasting political bonds.” Very importantly, this relationship was not only among equals; it could also involve people with different degrees of power. Therefore, political love and friendship—Greeks used the same word, philia, for these two concepts—bound rulers and ruled, and ultimately legitimized the king's rulership.

Baraona was appointed after don Fernando de Villafañe and Garci Pérez de Ulloa, oidor in Valladolid, successively refused the post. However, although Baraona had initially accepted the assignment to Charcas, he eventually declined it, claiming that he had been waiting over a year and a half to embark in the fleet and in the meantime his wife had gotten pregnant. The king then appointed don Diego de Salcedo and don Luis Moreno Ponce de León, who successively were unwilling to accept the office. Finally, in 1660, the king chose don Pedro Vásquez de Velasco (a candidate who had been proposed in almost all of the previous consultations), who happily moved from Quito to Charcas. Unfortunately for Nestares Marín, his successor arrived too late, and he was never able to leave La Plata, as he died there in April 1660.

Mauro de Pardiñas, born in Rianxo in 1615, was the son of Juan de Pardiñas Villar de Francos and Lucía Seco de Caamaño. He had several American connections thanks to his many years serving in Cádiz and with the navy and the fleet. Years later, his two sons, Bernardino and Juan Isidro, building on their father's career, became knights of Santiago, and continued the relationship with America. Bernardino served in the Royal Councils, and his son Nicolás was the first count of Castelo. Juan Isidro carried out his services in Cádiz under the command of his father until he moved to New Spain, where he settled and became governor of Nueva Vizcaya.

Carta de don Francisco de Soto Guzmán al capitán Mauro de Pardiñas, Posada, November 3, 1657, AHN, Estado, libro 210, no. 38. Born in 1618 in Briviesca, Castile, Soto Guzmán served as infantry captain some years in Tucumán in the late 1640s. In 1651 he was granted license to return to Spain, and was back in Buenos Aires by 1659. He proved to be as determined as he was competent and had a quick social and economic rise: in 1664 he entered the Order of Santiago; in 1674, he was named alguacil mayor of the Council of War, and in 1689, while residing in Cádiz, he bought the title of marquis of Torre Soto.

Scholars are rethinking the relationship between American elites and the Spanish crown. They are finding that autonomy, flexibility, and negotiation were fundamental elements of the political system. Under this perspective, American interests did not go against royal authority, nor weaken it, but rather these deals strengthened and united the empire. See for example Irigoin, Alejandra and Grafe, Regina, “Bargaining for Absolutism: A Spanish Path to Nation-State and Empire Building,” Hispanic American Historical Review 88:2 (May 2008): 173–209CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n87. Unfortunately, although agents’ importance is well acknowledged, studies on them are lacking. One of the few (if not the only) monographs is Gómez, Oscar Mazín, Gestores de la real justicia: procuradores y agentes de las catedrales hispanas nuevas en la corte de Madrid (Mexico City: Colegio de México, 2007)Google Scholar. Also relevant is Alvariño, Antonio Alvarez-Ossorio, “‘Pervenire alle orecchie della Maestà’: el agente lombardo en la corte madrileña,” Annali di storia moderna e contemporanea 3 (1997): 173–223Google Scholar. Ángel Sanz Tapia analyzes agents’ role in the purchase of offices in ¿Corrupción o necesidad?: la venta de cargos de gobierno americanos bajo Carlos II (1674–1700) (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 2009), 87–116. The agents of the Peruvian indigenous elites and towns are studied in de la Puente Luna, José Carlos, Andean Cosmopolitans: Seeking Justice and Reward at the Spanish Royal Court (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2017), 77–84Google Scholar. Guillaume Gaudin attempts to sketch some of the agents’ features in “Un acercamiento a las figuras de agentes de negocios y procuradores de Indias en la Corte,” Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos (October 2, 2017): http://journals.openedition.org/nuevomundo/71390, accessed July 20, 2019."
