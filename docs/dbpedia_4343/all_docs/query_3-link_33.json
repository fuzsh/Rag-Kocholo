        "text": "Guadalupe Victoria (born 1786, Tamazuela, Mex.—died 1843, Perote) was a Mexican soldier and political leader who was the first president of the Mexican Republic.\n\nVictoria left law school to join the movement for independence from Spain, fighting under José María Morelos in 1812. He changed his name to show his devotion to the cause of Mexican independence (the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, had been adopted as a symbol of the insurgency). After the death of Morelos, Victoria waged guerrilla war against the Spaniards from the mountains around Veracruz and Puebla. When Agustín de Iturbide came to power (1821), Victoria at first supported him, but by 1822, as Iturbide arrested all political opponents and dissolved the legislature, Victoria denounced him and joined Antonio López de Santa Anna’s successful revolt in 1823."
