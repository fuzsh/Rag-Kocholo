Still briefer notices about Mendoza appeared in 1604, 1607, and 1608, in works by Sandoval, Taxander, and Bermúdez de Pedraza, respectively. The first edition of Mendoza's poems came out in Madrid in 1610, carrying no biographical sketch. The first and second editions of Mendoza's Guerra de Granada (Lisbon. 1627, and Madrid, 1674) were issued with a story of his life as skimpy as that by Morales. It was written in 1627 by Baltasar de Çúñiga, and the biographical sketches from the eighteenth century by Mayans i Siscar and Sédano, more wordy but hardly more informative, were based on it. Mendoza's name survived until the middle of the nineteenth century on the strength of his (assumed) authorship of the Lazarillo de Tormes, his poetry, and the Guerra de Granada, but his life story remained practically unknown up to the 1840s, when at last the Royal Archives of Spain and other countries opened their doors to researchers. From then on publications of Mendoza's correspondence and studies about him followed each other rapidly. Adolfo de Castro y Rossi, Cayetano Roseli, Antonio Paz y Melia, Pascual de Gayangos, E. Señán y Alonso, and Cristóbal Pérez Pastor in Spain; Karl Lanz, Karl Stahr, Ferdinand Wolf, J. J. I. von Döllinger, August von Druffel, J. Fesenmair, and Walter Friedensburg in Germany and Austria; George Ticknor and William Knapp in the United States; Charles Graux and R. FoulchéDelbosc in France; and others—I do not claim completeness for this list—contributed to this growing interest in Mendoza. Their studies usually were biographical introductions to their editions of NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO\n\nχ\n\nPREFACE\n\nMendoza's writings. Fesenmair and Señan y Alonso published their essay-length studies as booklets. Simultaneously, Mendoza as a historic personality was met with more frequently in the more thoroughly researched histories of Charles V, Philip II, and the papacy that appeared during the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Inevitably, however, every new report of Mendoza was accompanied by inaccurate data, confusion, and misunderstanding. No full-scale biography was written, although Adolfo de Castro, who called Mendoza \"the great historical personage of Spain in the century of Charles V,\" announced in 1854 that he was writing \"the Life and Eulogy of this eminent author, which in due time will be published\" (ed. Poetas líricos, p. xix), a promise left unfulfilled although Castro lived until 1898. Pérez Pastor (1833-1908) had similar plans that he did not carry out. The momentum of the Mendoza revival continued into the beginning of the twentieth century despite A. Morel-Fatio's shattering—on insufficient grounds—of the traditional attribution of Lazarillo de Tormes to Mendoza (1886). But once Mendoza was deprived of his popular appeal as author of the first picaresque novel, while his other works, as well as the increasingly available information on his life, unfortunately were being submerged in esoteric scholarship—available only in widely scattered publications, difficult of access—interest in him slackened for several decades. Then it reawakened during the 1930s. Roger B. Merriman, professor of history at Harvard University, at work on The Rise of the Spanish Empire (vols. 3 and 4, 19251934), suggested to his student and assistant at the time, Garrett Mattingly, that he write the Mendoza biography that was so unaccountably lacking. Merriman undertook part of the work himself, still researching and writing up to the time of his death about Don Diego and the Guerra de Granada. (The late Professor Mattingly told me this, adding that Merriman's material and notes on Mendoza were accidentally destroyed.) In 1935 Robert Selden Rose, professor of Romance languages at Yale University, and his doctoral student Alberto Vázquez y Medina published Algunas Cartas (a selection of Mendoza's letters from Venice, Siena, and Rome), and in 1941 appeared the first volume of Vida y Obras de Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (Ma-\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\ndrid, 1941-1943), 3 vols., by Angel González Palencia and Eugenio Mele. Mendoza's irrepressible personality, so urbane, witty, and modern, first appeared to me in his letters as published in Algunas Cartas and Vida y Obras, vol. 3, kindling my wish to share this impression with English readers. My attempt to write this biography was greatly encouraged by Professor Selden Rose and Professor Garrett Mattingly, who recommended my project to the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. Radcliffe's two grants, 1962-1964, enabled me to use the resources of the Harvard College Libraries and to visit archives, as well as places associated with Mendoza, in Spain and Italy. The late Professor Selden Rose most generously entrusted me with all the material on Mendoza that he collected some thirty years ago when he intended to write a biography of Mendoza together with Dr. Vázquez, a plan they later abandoned. As will be seen from the source references in the footnotes marked \"Rosefile,\" in many instances I drew on this unpublished material, mainly for the letters Mendoza wrote Charles V from Venice and for the correspondence of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici with Mendoza and others. In the Archive of Simancas, I read the originals of many of the letters published by Selden Rose and González Palencia as well as those in the \"Rose-file,\" and I collected additional material there, as well as in Madrid and in Siena. Professor Mattingly of Columbia University, in the last year of his life, was an inspiring mentor of my efforts, offering constructive ideas in the area of Renaissance diplomacy. The writing of this book, especially in parts of chapters two. six, and nine, was much furthered also by Professor Paul Oskar Kristeller of Columbia University, to whom I am greatly indebted for deepening my understanding of Averroism and for many other helpful suggestions and generously given advice. Among officials of European archives who spared no effort in finding letters of Mendoza and other source material for me were, in Siena, Dr. Sem Falcini, vice-director of the State Archives in the Palazzo Piccolomini; in Madrid, the Rev. Padre D. Pedro Longás Bartibás, director of the Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, and Sr. D. Ramón Paz, director of the manuscript division of the Biblioteca Nacional; in Simancas, Sr. D. Ricardo Magdaleno Redondo,\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\ndirector of the Archive, and Señorita Concha Alvarez Terán, Señora Adela González Vega, and Señorita Ascención de la Plaza, unfailingly helpful archiveras. Sr. D. Julian Alvárez Zurro, photographer of the Archive of Simancas, excellently photographed and transcribed many documents for me. To all of them I am immensely grateful. I must give a special expression of thanks to the director of the Museum of the Alhambra in Granada, Sr. D. Jesús Bermúdez Pareja, professor of Arabic at the University of Granada. Professor Bermúdez was able to figure out (from some biographical data I told him) the approximate place of Mendoza's residence during the War of Granada, a fact not known before; he showed me the remains of the palace of the Count of Tendilla where Don Diego was born; and he most helpfully arranged to have Tendilla's portrait and the site of the palace photographed for me. With his unbounded enthusiasm for the Alhambra and for all of the Mendozas linked with its history, Don Jesús gave me much picturesque and useful information about the Mendozas and their circle in Granada. Any errors in judgment, and in the interpretation and compilation of facts, are of course mine. I am deeply grateful to Mrs. Mary I. Bunting, president of Radcliffe College, for founding the unique Radcliffe Institute, which gave me the opportunity for completing this book; to Miss Constance E. Smith, dean of the Institute, for her invaluable encouragement and advice; and to Mrs. Rene Bryant, Mrs. Jean Radcliffe, Miss Doris Lorentzen, and other former and present members of the Institute staff for their unvaryingly kind helpfulness. I could never have undertaken to write this book but for the endless patience of my husband, Tossy Spivakovsky, and of Ruth, our daughter, who grew up with this preoccupation of mine. Both have given me valuable and constructive criticism and constant encouragement to complete my task. Ruth, as well as her husband, Dr. Paul H. Voorhis, deserve the credit for trying to eliminate my foreign-sounding locutions and for devoting great care and interest in trying to make the manuscript generally readable. E. S. Westport, Connecticut\n\nxiii\n\nPREFACE\n\nA Note on the Text The names of internationally known figures such as Charles V, Philip II, Paul III, are anglicized; those of lesser-known personages, such as Don Pedro de Pacheco, are left in their Spanish or Italian forms. With the exception of François I, who is called Francis I, other Francises remain \"Don Francisco de Mendoza,\" etc. The Catholic sovereigns and their children I prefer to call by their Spanish names, Fernando, Isabel, Juana. Many ancient Spanish family names still in use, such as González, Sánchez, and López, were not written with accents in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. To be consistent I apply the modern accentuation, except in quotations where such names are given in the spelling copied exactly from original manuscripts. The spelling in the quotations that appear in the chapter notes might look full of errors to the nonspecialist unfamiliar with Spanish texts of the sixteenth century. Accents were rarely in use at that time (Mendoza never made a n y ) ; u, v, b, are interchanged, apparently at random, often in one and the same document; h appears in unexpected places; modern j is usually x. I transcribed all quotations as exactly as possible from: (1) original manuscripts— the texts furnished me by Simancas have, however, modern punctuation and capitalization; (2) Algunas Cartas, edited by Vázquez and Selden Rose, the major source book for this study; and (3) other printed sources that vary in their reproductions of the original orthography. The more recent publications tend to adhere closely to the original spelling in their documentation. Translations of foreign-language sources are my own, unless otherwise noted.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\n1. Background Mendozas and Pachecos.

BACKGROUND And this I say as philosopher and as Moor of Granada, or as a Marrano . . . Don Diego 1\n\nMendozas and Pachecos was born in the Alhambra of Granada in 1503 or 15042 into a family that a few decades earlier had played a crucial role in launching the Spanish monarchy on the path to world power. He was the last son of aging parents. If his mother, Doña Francisca Pacheco, survived this birth of her eighth living child, it was for a few years only. His father, a man in his sixties, Don Iñigo López de Mendoza, second D O N DIEGO HURTADO DE MENDOZA\n\n1 \"Y esto hablo como philosopho y como moro de Granada, o como marrano.\" Mendoza to the Bishop of Arras, Rome, September 1, 1548. Alberto Vázquez and R. Selden Rose, ed., Algunas Cartas de Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 15381552, p. 119. Cited hereafter as AC. 2 The year of Mendoza's birth is not usually given as 1504, but the following remarks by him narrow the date down to this year: Mendoza to Jerónimo Zurita, Granada, December 1, 1573: \"he casi setenta años,\" Diego José Dormer, Progresos de la historia en el reyno de Aragón, p. 502. In another letter, dated Sept. 20, 1568, Mendoza says he is sixty-four years old: Biblioteca de autores españoles (BAE) XXI, Historiadores de sucesos particulares, ed. Cayetano Roseli, I, xxviii. And in his last will, August 6, 1575, he says of himself that he is \"71 años o poco mas,\" Memorias de la Real Academia Española (MRAE), ed. C. Pérez Pastor, X, 153-194; also Angel González Palencia and Eugenio Mele, Vida y obras de Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (GP) II, 385.\n\nSON OF THE ALHAMBRA 4 Count of Tendilla, was the first Christian governor of the Moorish kingdom. After enduring for 250 years as the only Islamic state in Spain, Granada had been conquered in 1492 to the glory of the Catholic Sovereigns at the Mendozas' instigation and, largely, thanks to their support. This Count of Tendilla and his uncle, the Grand Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza \"whose opinion and prudence governed the Catholic Sovereigns,\" 3 joined by other members of their family—a group of about two dozen great lords, each a master of many vassals and able to raise a large private army— had been at the side of the royal couple since Queen Isabel's war of succession (1474-1479). The residence where Don Diego first saw the light of day, a Moorish palace in the sophisticated style of the Royal House, which it adjoined, was given his father by Fernando and Isabel as one of his rewards for his service in the Granadme war. 4 It had taken the Mendozas almost eight hundred years to fight their way from the narrow confines of their mountain passes in the Pyrenees, over the vast tablelands of Old and New Castile, and finally to the sierras of Granada. The original seat of the family was a small mountain estate in the Basque province Alava. In a cold and humid climate, the ancient estate Divina, later called Mendoça (perhaps from Mendioz, meaning \"cold mountain\"), 5 lies in the shelter of the Sierra of Badaya, one of the most impenetrable of regions. 6 Rough-hewn are the ruins of the old Mendoza castle, still standing about seven miles west of Vitoria, typical of a rough land inhabited by bands of shepherds, ferocious men unsubdued by any invaders, be they Romans, Goths, or Arabs. 7 Christianity 3 Francisco Henriquez de Jorquera, Anales de Granada, ed. Antonio Marín Ocete, I, 279. 4 In addition to his tenure as alcaide and captain-general in Granada, Tendilla received fifty percent of the income the Moorish kings and queens had drawn from the pasture lands in the Sierra Nevada.

Lautensach, Maurische Züge im geographischen Bild der Iberischen Halbinsel, p. 24, Alava is the only Basque region without a trace of Arabic or Germanic topographical names.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n5\n\nentered the region peacefully, brought by monks fleeing the Moors. Through the first three centuries of Arab rule in Spain, this martial people lived in daily expectation of Moorish attacks from the no man's land south of the castellated Alavan-Castilian frontier. The first of the warrior-lords of Alava adding \"Mendoza\" to his name was Don Lope López de Mendoza, who since 1124 served Castile's Queen Doña Urraca as majordomo. Either this Mendoza or his younger brother was in the direct line of Don Diego's ancestors. 8 Though called ricos hombres (\"rich m e n \" ) , the Mendozas were at first comparatively small lords. Over the centuries, they added to their landed estate in almost every generation by marrying heiresses. 9 Not infrequently, this happened two or three times to a single landowner, with the death, usually in childbirth, of his successive wives. Also, the kings of Castile often rewarded their services with territorial grants. Lands became increasingly available as the Christians reconquered them from the gradually retreating Muslims. With the new owners of latifundia came their herds of sheep and cattle, which transformed the empty Castilian tableland into a great wool-producing center, leading to the powerful organization of Spanish transhumance, the base of the growing wealth of the House of Mendoza. By the fourteenth century, these descendants of rugged, single-minded frontier fighters, now a highly educated court aristocracy, formed one of the leading five or six Castilian lineages. They established themselves in Guadalajara, from then on the permanent seat of the family. The first known poet among them, Don Diego's great-greatgrandfather, Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (1365-1404), still 8 Balparda, II, 321-325 et passim.

Rodriguez García, Crónica del Señorío de Vizcaya, pp. 45, 46. 9 The Castilian hereditary laws since Alfonso X granted females succession to the throne as well as to other titles of the nobility, reflecting a tradition going back to the earliest times of the Reconquest that preserved the seignorial houses through the distaff side. If a woman had no brothers, she inherited not only her father's property but also his name and title, which she could bestow on her husband to \"raise\" him. \"Hurtado\" and apparently also \"Mendoza\" continued through the female line.\n\n6\n\nSON OF THE ALHAMBRA\n\nuntitled, owned the estates of Mendoza, Hita, Buitrago, the Hermandades of Alava, and many other localities, and he was Chief Royal Justice, majordomo of the King, alcaide (castellan) of m a n y fortresses, and Chief Admiral of Castile. 10 With his son and heir, the famous poet Don Iñigo López de Mendoza (1398-1458), Don Diego's great-grandfather, who attained the Marquisate of Santillana, 11 the Mendozas advanced to the first rank of the entire nobility. Santillana shone also as a patron of writers and scientists, setting an example which, among his fourth-generation descendants, Don Diego alone emulated to a similar degree. The Marquis inspired the first tentative efforts of the literary movement of humanism in Spain, which Don Diego was not only to continue, but of which this great-grandson became the very embodiment. He commissioned a translation of the Aeneid; he introduced the Italian sonnet, and sometimes he used the content matter of the classics as thematic material for his poetry, although, unlike his progeny, the older poet and protohumanist was ignorant of both Latin and Greek. Santillana's titles and major landholdings went to the first of his seven sons, another Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, whom the Catholic Kings created Duke of Infantado in 1475; this ducal house was to remain the titular head of all the subsequent branches of the Mendozas. But the intellectual tradition continued with the second son, Don Diego's grandfather Don Iñigo López de Mendoza, and still more splendidly so with the fifth of Santillana's sons, the above-mentioned Grand Cardinal, Don Pedro González de Mendoza (1428-1495), to whose great position the older brothers deferred. 12 The Cardinal, Don Diego's outstanding great-uncle, besides laying the foundation for the Spain of Don Diego's time, also largely formed the lives of his grandfather and father (the Cardinal's elder brother and nephew, respectively). With Don Pedro González as 10 A sample of his work in Critical Anthology of Spanish Verse, ed. E.

Mendoza; Layna Serrano, Historia de Guadalajara, II, 36-74, 301-317.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n7\n\nChancellor of Castile (he headed the political councils first of Enrique IV, then of the Catholic Kings), the Mendozas reached the highest level of influence that the family was ever to have. 13 Their name gained in renown during the following century when its proud bearers, many of them serving Charles V and Philip II at all times, carried it into the wider world of the Spanish Empire, but these monarchs, increasingly absolutist, drew their political advisers chiefly from the lower classes. Under Enrique IV, the \"Impotent,\" whose reign (1454-1474) was plagued by civil wars culminating in his deposition (his enemies raising to King his half-brother Alfonso, a boy of eleven), the Mendozas supported the legitimate monarch. Against Enrique's declared heir apparent, his daughter Juana, the opposing faction promoted the succession of Isabel, his half-sister, to the throne of Castile, but the Mendozas stood by Juana; in 1467, they took charge of the Infanta, then five years old, caring for her in Buitrago at the house of Don Diego's grandfather, the Count of Tendilla I. Even when on Alfonso's sudden death Enrique IV was forced to agree to Isabel's succession, Don Diego's grandfather, more consistent than the wretched King in supporting his legal rights, still upheld Juana's side. In Buitrago, where the little girl still lived in his castle, the Count of Tendilla nailed a large poster to the Cathedral proclaiming the rights of the King's legitimate daughter; then he rode defiantly into Ocaña, the temporary abode of Isabel, and stuck the same notice to the very door of her residence. 14 But near the end of 1469, Isabel married Fernando, the heir presumptive of Aragon. In the face of this fait accompli, the Mendozas' interest in the Infanta Juana cooled. Though ostensibly still taking her side, they returned her to her father, starting now to listen to the attempts of rapprochement that the intelligent young princely couple made them. They waited, so it appears, for the highest bid. The only one truly loath to change sides must have been Don Diego's grandfather, a man of high principles, as we will see. 13\n\nThe rise of the Mendozas in the context of the Castilian aristocracy is traced by L. Suárez Fernández, Nobleza y Monarquía: Puntos de vista sobre la Historia castellana del siglo XV. 14 Ibid., p. 163; Layna Serrano, Historia de Guadalajara, II, 143.\n\n8\n\nSON OF THE ALHAMBRA\n\nIn the Mendoza empire of territories and titles of duke, 15 marquis, and count, the honor of a Cardinal of the Church was still lacking. The closest Spanish aspirant to the cardinalate was at the present time Alfonso de Carrillo, the Archbishop of Toledo, primate see of all the Spains—the Mendozas' enemy, and the life-long rival of Don Pedro González. Perhaps it was one of Fernando de Aragon's cleverest moves when, in 1473, he procured Don Pedro's nomination as cardinal. Though the clan still did not desert Enrique IV, the majority of them were from then on resolved, tacitly as yet, to help Isabel in the future. 16 On Enrique's death in December, 1474, many Castilian towns, Madrid and Burgos among them, rose at once in support of Juana. The King of Portugal (her mother's brother) swiftly entered the country with a large army, occupying the towns of Toro and Zamora, which had invited him in. Now the Mendozas were ready to swing their faction openly to Isabel's side. While the young royal couple laid siege to Toro, the second Marquis of Santillana brought virtually his entire House into their camp, his army increasing the Isabeline to match the Portuguese in numbers. But the two Iñigos, Don Diego's grandfather and father, were conspicuously absent, a fact revealing the first Count of Tendilla's unusual intransigence. Apparently, he did not share the clan's consensus to desert Doña Juana, and he had also prevented his eldest son, who was his comrade-in-arms, from switching his allegiance. 17 In the following year, however, the serious danger in which the Isabeline party found itself may have moved the recalcitrant Count of Ten15\n\nThe duke among them was Don Beltrán de la Cueva, Duke of Albuquerque (alleged father of the Infanta Juana, la \"Beltraneja\"), who was married to a daughter of the second Marquis of SantiUana. 16 Suárez Fernández, Nobleza y Monarquía, pp. 170-172. 17 In the document presenting the title of Duke of Infantado to the second Marquis of SantiUana, drafted in the encampment in front of Toro on July 22, 1475, Fernando and Isabel express their gratitude to seventeen members of the House of Mendoza, individually naming each one, except the Count of Tendilla and his older son. In contrast, his younger son (Don Diego's uncle and namesake, then Bishop of Palencia) is punctiliously mentioned there; since the Bishop never left the side of his Cardinal-uncle, the monarchs thanked him because he was his (as well as the recently named Duke's) nephew. They do not mention the Bishop's father even in this connection, although the fathers of all the others of the Mendoza brothers and cousins are specified in this document. Layna Serrano, Historia de Guadalajara, II, 186-189, 475-477.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n9\n\ndilla to reconsider, for he and his son joined Fernando's forces in the battle near Toro in March 1476, where they defeated the Portuguese and the large faction of the Castilian nobility allied with them. 18 Yet even with all the Mendozas now behind them, the Sovereigns' war of succession took three years longer. The eventual victory of the future Catholic Kings is unthinkable without their support. So, in the last instance, a cardinal's hat was responsible for the course of Spain's subsequent history, its unification, and its resultant emergence as a world power. This great-uncle of Don Diego rose from Archdeacon in Guadalajara as a boy of twelve to Bishop of Calahorra (1454), to Bishop of Sigüenza (1467), to Archbishop of Seville (1473), and to Cardinal the same year. After the death of his rival Alfonso Carrillo, he also became Archbishop of Toledo (1482). Parental direction was responsible for his clerical career; it was usual for at least one of the younger sons, with or without a spiritual inclination, to enter the Church. Don Pedro happened to be as secular a man as his brothers; choosing not to restrain his own nature, he was, in addition to being a master in statecraft, a warrior of personal courage, taking to the field in many campaigns. Two of his three illegitimate sons, proudly acknowledged, became heads of powerful titled families,19 and he lived in princely magnificence. In 1479, just when Isabel's victory in the war of succession had secured her Castilian throne, Fernando succeeded to the throne of Aragon-Valencia-Catalonia. Except for Granada, still held to be impregnable, all of Spain was unified, at least dynastically. With the Cardinal's encouragement (and most of the Castilian nobility 18\n\nIbid., pp. 190-193. The Catholic Kings raised the Cardinal's eldest son, Don Rodrigo de Mendoza, to Marquis of Cenete and Count of the Cid and Jadraque, titles comprising enormous territories in Granada and Valencia. The Marquis' heir was his daughter Doña Mencía de Mendoza, second Marchioness of Cenete, whose first husband was Henry, Duke of Nassau, after whose death she married Don Fernando de Aragón, son of the King of Naples, who was Duke of Calabria and had formerly been married to Queen Germaine de Foix, second wife and widow of Fernando, the Catholic King. The Cardinal's second son, Don Diego de Mendoza, was named Count of Melito; he became a celebrated commander whose most famous descendant was his granddaughter Doña Ana de Mendoza, later the wife of Don Ruy Gómez de Silva, Prince of Eboli. 19\n\n10\n\nSON OF THE ALHAMBRA\n\nnow behind h i m ) , the sovereigns at last attempted the conquest of Granada. Their triumph brought all of Spain under their rule. But there was as yet no central organ of Spanish power to express this union. Although the Queen of Castile and the King of Aragon intervened de facto in governing each other's patrimony, the legal basis for this connubial collaboration remained thinly defined. To reinforce this tenuous unity, Cardinal Mendoza counseled the monarchs to introduce the Inquisition to Castile (it existed, inactively, in Aragon where it was now being revived); and he created the office of Inquisitor-General of Spain, the first federal agency, as it were. H e picked Fray Tomás de Torquemada for that function, the sinister personality who has become the symbol for that era of persecution. Two, three generations later, the Spanish Inquisition would appear an eternal institution to Don Diego, as static as the principle of monarchy and just as normal, natural, and necessary, although he was prudent enough to protect himself from its terror. Yet the \"Holy Office\" was an almost casual creation of his great-uncle, a m a n who had no paltriness in his spirit, always advocating prudence, conciliation, and tolerance, and who could not have foreseen that he was letting loose a legacy of persecution that would last for almost 350 years. His motives in establishing the Inquisition were those of a statesman. The occasion for creating this new instrument of unification, analogous to the political, had arisen through the infiltration of the Spanish Church by converted Jews. In the fifteenth century, after a series of pogroms, with resulting waves of baptism in 1391, many conversos, some of them marranos (secretly, still Jewish believers), had taken clerical positions, high and low. In a bizarre development, former rabbis (and their descendants) had become Catholic priests, bishops, and confessors of kings. The enemies of the newly converted (including some of these converted themselves, denouncing their own brethren) were gripped by a persecuting fervor unmatched until then, calling for the extirpation of the \"heresy\" of those who were no longer Jews. This is not the place to go deeper into the history of that odious organization. It is touched on here only to illuminate the climate in which Cardinal Mendoza, a notably humane man, set the scene and chose the directors for the ensuing bloody drama of the Inquisition, a tragedy he had not intended to write. On the contrary,\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n11\n\nin 1478, when he could no longer avoid listening to complaints about the anarchy prevailing in the Church on account of the \"Judaizers,\" he advocated peaceful measures for improving the situation. He published a catechism spelling out the belief and duties of the Christian, stressing education as the most desirable means for consolidating the faith. 20 All this notwithstanding, the first fires of the Inquisition were lit in 1482 in Cardinal Mendoza's own diocese, Seville, site of the first auto de fé. The Cardinal, occupied in marshalling the forces for the Granadme war, was not present at those spectacles. Besides, once the Holy Office was established, he had no hand in its jurisdiction. Yet those events occurred under his aegis, as did ten years later the expulsion of the Jews, while at the same time he, his family, and virtually his entire class of aristocrats were protecting many actual and former Jews who managed the grandees' estates and served them in countless positions of trust. Could he not have prevented the horror, now incipient, soon to pervade the Spain he had united? Perhaps so, if the professed aim of the persecutors had not been the purification of the Church—and if his own life had been more saintly. He must have felt unable to speak up against the violent forces he had inadvertently set in motion in the name of administrative reform, because he himself, unscrupulous beneficiary of multiple bishoprics and sinner against the vow of continence, was an obvious symbol of the Church's corruption. Don Diego's grandfather Don Iñigo López de Mendoza 21 (born in Guadalajara 1419 or 1420, died 1479), second son of the first Marquis of Santillana, was made Count of Tendilla by Enrique IV in 1465. As a boy of eighteen, he joined his father in one of the occasional frontier skirmishes against the Moors; during the fighting he saved Santillana's life and felled the Moorish commander at the same time. This established Don Iñigo's fame of greatest military prowess among the seven brothers. Married young (at nineteen or twenty), spending his life in political and military service to the crown, he is described as devoted to letters no less 20\n\nHenry Charles Lea, A History of the Inquisition in Spain, I, 155, 156.

Spain's link with the Renaissance continued through him: as one of the few Castilian warriors knowing Latin, he was sent to Rome in 1455 as Enrique IV's ambassador to Pope Nicholas V and his successor, Calixtus III. In 1459/60, the King once more sent him as his envoy to the new Pope Pius II, who had convened a Congress in Mantua for all Christian monarchs to join him in planning a Crusade. On that occasion, Don Iñigo, annoyed that the French ambassador had taken precedence over him, insisted on a more honorable seat for himself as the Castilian King's representative. Entering the clerical assembly with an escort of armed vassals, he took it upon himself to remove the French ambassador bodily from the seat he had not been willing to yield—another incident showing the haughtiness and intransigence of Don Diego's grandfather. Some of his grandson's actions at the papal court about ninety years later will seem to be astonishingly similar. The long and fortunate life of Don Diego's father, also a Don Iñigo López de Mendoza (1442?-1515), the second Count of Tendilla (and from 1512, Marquis of Mondéjar), so overshadowed that of his father that during the sixteenth century historians believed both Iñigos to be one person. 22 (Pope Paul III, the former Alexander Farnese, distinguished them both, however. When he was in a good mood, he would never fail to remind Don Diego—who like his father and grandfather was ambassador to popes—that he definitely remembered his father and almost remembered his grandfather. To be exact, Farnese was not born until six or seven years after the time of the first Tendilla's second and last embassy.) 23 The second Tendilla, sometimes called \"the great Tendilla,\" 24 re22 Ambrosio de Morales, Las antigüedades de las ciudades de España. In his dedication to Don Diego (GP III, 470-474), Morales says that Santillana was Don Diego's grandfather, p. 471. Gutierrez Coronel, Historia genealógica, II, 332, attributes several events from the second Tendilla's life to the first Tendilla.

On Tendilla II, see ibid.,\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n13\n\nsembled his grandfather, the first Marquis of Santillana, in his intellectual interests, display of magnificence and patronage, and perhaps also in temperament. He seems to have been more conciliatory and prudent than his impetuous father, who was his senior by scarcely more than nineteen years. Until his father's death in 1479, he accompanied him to all his battles and ambassadorial missions. His first wife, who was his first cousin, Doña Marina Lasso de Mendoza, died childless in 1477 (but, in accord with the centuries-old Mendoza procedure, she left him estates). Soon after his marriage to his second wife, Doña Francisca Pacheco, in 1480, the Count took part in the Granadme war, interrupting this service from the end of 1485 until 1487, when he went as ambassador of the Catholic Sovereigns to Italy. Pope Innocent VIII hailed him as \"peacemaker in Italy\"—perhaps the finest honor any Mendoza ever earned. On his return, he brought with him Italian-trained architects to finish a la antigua (\"in antique style\") the College of Santa Cruz, founded by his Cardinal-uncle in Valladolid. Originally designed as a Gothic structure, the college was the first building in Spain to show neoclassic lines. 25 In his entourage also came the Italian humanist and Latin teacher Pietro Martire d'Anghiera (known to English readers as Peter M a r t y r ) , the first of Italian intellectuals seeking greener pastures in Spain. So, Count Iñigo, contributing to the introduction in Spain of the Renaissance in architecture and letters, laid the basis for a thorough Latinist education for his sons and daughters and their entire generation. Occasionally the Count composed Latin verse, but he is best known for his role in the war of Granada. In 1483 Tendilla saved Alhama, a town in the mountains southwest of Granada, and then an isolated Christian stronghold over thirty miles inside Moorish territory. 26 In 1489 he conquered Baza, defeating the Moorish Princes Cidi Yahia and Ben Omar, father and son, heroic defenders whom, after his victory, he persuaded to accept conversion. These Arabic chieftains (later known as Don pp. 292-299, 301; José Cepeda Adán, \"Andalucía en 1508: U n aspecto de la correspondencia del Virrey Tendilla,\" Hispania 22 (Madrid, 1962); Antonio Marín Ocete, El Conde de Tendilla, primer Capitán general de Granada, soon to be published by the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife. 25 Pedro Aguado Bleye, Manual de Historia de España, II, 246, 247. 26 Layna Serrano, Historia de Guadalajara, II, 264.\n\n14\n\nSON OF T H E A L H A M B R A\n\nPedro de Granada and Don Alonso de Granada y Venegas) kept their desertion into the Christian camp secret so as to lure m a n y of their trusting followers into military traps. This coup de grâce to the Moorish side eventually led to the bloodless surrender of Granada, which also was negotiated by the Count of Tendilla. On the second day of January, 1492, he, with a few other notables, planted on the Torre de Vela, highest tower of the Alhambra, his Cardinaluncle's silver cross, the royal Castilian banner with its lions and castles, and the standard of Santiago. 27 For the rest of his life— another twenty-three years—he was to command this kingdom. Don Diego's future mother, Doña Francisca Pacheco, whom the Count brought into his new hereditary estate on the Alhambra in 1492, was no blood relation of the Mendozas, but almost four hundred years before Don Diego's birth, one of her paternal ancestors, the Jewish doctor Ruy Capón, was physician and treasurer of Queen Doña Urraca when his paternal forebears also attended that Queen's court. There seems to have been no poetic or other literary heritage on her side—only traditions of political expertise and boundless ambition. Her father, Don Juan Pacheco, Marquis of Villena and Maestre of Santiago (1419-1474), was for m a n y years a favorite of Enrique IV. 28 He was reared from boyhood as Enrique's page and close friend, but his lineage was not then equal in rank to that of the ancient Castilian families. About 1443, however, in the year after his marriage to Doña María Portocarrero, one of the richest heiresses, he emerged as a great power next to the throne. In 1445, by obtaining the Marquisate of Villena, former crown land of King Juan of Aragon, he had lifted himself to the front rank of all the grandees. His wife, Don Diego's maternal grandmother, was of Moorish27 María del Carmen Pescador del Hoyo, \"Cómo fué de verdad la toma de Granada,\" Al-Andalus (A-A) 20, fasc. 2 (1955): 283-344. 28 Contemporary chroniclers were either violently biased against Juan Pacheco or presumably in his pay. See the bibliography on him in Aguado Bleye, Manual, II, 5-28; see also J. F. O'Callaghan, \"Don Pedro Girón, Master of the Order of Calatrava,\" Hispania 21 (Madrid, 1961): 345, n. 8.

Paz y Melia, is hostile toward Pacheco; Hernando del Pulgar, Crónica de los Señores Reyes Católicos Don Fernando y Doña Isabel, is friendly.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n15\n\nJewish descent. Among her ancestors was Doña María Ruiz, a Jewess of beauty and wealth, and a Cordobese noble, Don Hernando, forebears she shared with the future Catholic King Fernando, who was her cousin. (King Fernando's mother, the Queen of Navarre, Aragon, and Sicily, was Doña Juana Enriquez, aunt of Doña Francisca Pacheco.) Doña María Portocarrero is described as a woman of great qualities and authority. She is said to have been so devoted to her husband that she adopted his tremulous way of speech. Their thirteen or fourteen children married into the families of the Mendoza, Ponce de León, Aguilar, Dukes of Alba and many others; so practically the entire higher nobility of Spain owed their \"taint\" of \"impure\" blood mostly to this couple. 29 During the lifetime of Juan Pacheco, the Mendoza family bitterly opposed him. At one time Pacheco had conquered their town of Guadalajara and made the King sequester all the Mendoza properties that he could reach. This storm lasted more than a year, and the brothers Mendoza withstood it, holding out in their castle of Hita, which was besieged by Pacheco's troops. Near the end of his life Pacheco regretted the continuous feud, and tried to win the Mendozas by ties of marriage. In 1471 he affianced his young daughter Francisca to the ten-year-old grandson of the second Marquis of Santillana (the boy was Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza [14611531] \"el Grande,\" later the third Duke of Infantado), but this agreement must have been broken through new hostilities. In 1472 Pacheco himself, after a year or two as widower, married a young girl from their clan, the daughter of Pedro Velasco, Count of Haro. Yet the Mendozas continued on the opposite faction even after Don Juan Pacheco's death in 1474. Pacheco's son, the second Marquis of Villena (later, first Duke of Escalona), fought against them on the side of Juana. But in 1480, after the Isabeline victory, the Marquis of Villena gave the second Count of Tendilla his still unmarried sister Francisca with a dowry of three and a half million maravedís and the fortress and town of Jumilla. 30 The two stirpes had at last concluded peace. 29 On the descent of Pacheco's wife, see Julio Caro Baroja, Los Judíos en la España moderna y contemporánea, III, 288. 30 For data on Doña Francisca Pacheco, see GP I, 4; Gudiel, Compendio, p. 90; Fernández de Bethencourt, Historia genealógica, II, 186, 187.\n\n16\n\nSON OF T H E A L H A M B R A\n\nChildhood in Granada Count Iñigo and his wife, as far as we know, had three children before moving to Granada: Doña María, born in the 1480s (who in 1503 married her cousin Don Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza, Count of Monteagudo); Don Luis Hurtado, heir to the marquisate (1489-1566); and Don Antonio (1491?-1552), the later Viceroy of Mexico and Peru. The remaining five children of this couple, born within the Alhambra compound, were Doña María Pacheco (?-1531); Don Bernardino (?-1557); Don Francisco (?-1544); Doña Isabel ( ? - ? ) ; and lastly, Don Diego. 31 Of the \"Palace of Tendilla,\" only the foundations remain. 32 Rows of reddish brick, less than two feet high, remnants of ancient walls, trace the original design of the vanished house. Their long, low lines serve as dividers for flower beds. The oblong pool that once formed the heart of the palace, resembles the slightly larger pool in the \"Court of Myrtles\" nearby. It is set in gardens of a beauty defying description. Once, arcaded passages and graceful colonnades, similar to those preserved in the royal house, also enclosed this gleaming pool. Now, the alcoves, vaulted ceilings, stucco walls, are gone; the view from the site, once framed within the arches of double and triple partitioned windows, ranges without limit from the towers of the Alhambra in the foreground to the Cerro del Sol with its hillside, the Generalife; it embraces the hills of the Albaicin and Sacromonte and loses itself in the distant sierras. Flowering shrubs and trees fill the spaces that once housed 31 Tendilla II also had at least three illegitimate children, the first of them, Rodrigo, apparently from the time between his two marriages. In 1489, the ninth year of his marriage to Doña Francisca, the Count made a testament asking his wife for mercy to take care of \"don rrodrigo mi fijo\" in the event of his death. In his final testament in 1515, only a \"natural\" son, Pedro, appears; possibly he was born after the Countess had died. From that late time seems to hail also a daughter, María de Mendoza, whom her half brother Don Antonio, then Viceroy of New Spain, took with him to Mexico. 32 Antonio Gallego y Burin, La Alhambra, p. 198. During the time of Philip V, the owner of the house, a latter-day Count of Tendilla, who had taken the Austrian side in the W a r of the Spanish Succession, destroyed his palace rather than allow the Bourbon King or his entourage to lodge there. I am indebted for this information to Don Jesús Bermúdez Pareja, director of the Museum of the Alhambra.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n17\n\nprincely retainers and menials, women's quarters, baths, stables, and patios. The Count of Tendilla, first Christian host of this mansion of Arabic princes, used to entertain his guests in Moorish fashion, bidding them squat on silken rugs laid on floors of polychrome tiles. 33 He and his family adapted themselves to Arab customs without delay, and he was content to remain in this newly won territory. Sixteen years after the conquest, in 1508, he disclosed that he had not crossed the Sierra Morena for many years, having all but become a native of this region. 34 Tendilla's conciliatory manner had endeared him to the proud people of Granada who were, in fact, unbeaten. Their rulers had sold them out to the Christians without allowing them to fight for their city; the conquerors (led by Tendilla) stole through the back door of the Alhambra to take possession from Boabdil, the last King of the Nasirid dynasty. Stealthily, through the night, the troops had filed in, one by one, to occupy the towers and bastions of the Red Fortress. But when the Granadines awoke to the sight of the silver cross planted on the tower of the Alcazaba, and the presence of Christian occupation troops on and around the Alhambra, Count Iñigo's soft-spoken words and promises calmed their anger and fear. He left them undisturbed in their customs and daily pursuits; his civilian co-administrator Don Hernando de Zafra was equally tolerant, and his ecclesiastical collaborator, the first Archbishop of Granada, Fray Hernando de Talavera, was, by all accounts, a saintly man. On the advice of the Mendozas, the Catholic Sovereigns had granted the Moors complete freedom of religion and customs. They promised not to establish the Inquisition in Granada, and they even left the people in possession of their small arms (lances, daggers, bows and arrows, slingshots), sequestering only all cannon. 35 Granada, whose environment was an important factor in making 33 During, for example, the visit of Dr. Hieronymus Münzer.

Until the invading armies ravaged the flourishing countryside, it had been thriving in sericulture and horticulture. The working people and the small traders, mostly Arabs but also Jews, inhabited the Albaicin; on this hill's summit, level with the Alhambra fortress across the deep gorge of the Darro River, stood the largest mosque and another palace of the Arabic kings. The peace treaty with Boabdil had left also the numerous Jews of \"Granada, the Albaicin, and its suburbs\" undisturbed, but this situation was the first to be reversed. A scant three months after the conquest, the Jews were given notice to submit to baptism or, under penalty of death, leave within another four months not only Granada but also all of newly united Christian Spain. M a n y Moors considered this a warning to them as well, for a great number of them left by their own choice at the same time (ten years before the edict for their own expulsion was issued). Even so, the basic composition of the population did not change much. After the Jews' expulsion, the vacant houses of the exiles stood ready to receive incoming Christian settlers, and lately it has been noted that many of these new settlers were, in fact, Marranos. Escaping from the Inquisition now established in all other parts of Spain, these baptized Jews soon filled many places left behind by the Jews who chose emigration. Similarly, many Moors electing to remain bought houses and estates at enforced bargain prices from emigrating Moors. 36 At the start of its new life, Granada and its hinterland had to adjust to a shift chiefly among the middle classes. The Moorish kings and aristocrats were simply replaced in toto by the conquerors who seized all large estates as their spoils.37 The bulk of the Muslim population remained: workers, artisans, peasants, and small shopkeepers—those elements of the populace who have no36\n\nOn Jews in peace treaty, see DIE 8, item 38, p. 433; and Miguel Angel Ladero Quesada, \"Dos Temas de la Granada Nazari,\" Cuadernos de Historia 3 (1969): 321-345.

Soon the Moorish kingdom settled down to its usual ways, the majority of the people now \"vassals\" of new Christian landowners. Always poor, producing the same wealth for their new lords that formerly had flowed into the pockets of the Muslim King and his satellites, the workers and serfs in the mountain villages and on their Albaicin, with its honeycomb of tiny houses, did not find their life changed too much—at least not during the first seven years—under the moderate regime of Tendilla, assisted by Zafra and Talavera. But when Cardinal Mendoza, whose conciliatory counsel had guided the peace treaty, died in 1495, his successor as supreme adviser to the Kings, Fray Francisco Ximénez de Cisneros (who owed his appointment to Mendoza's recommendation), prevailed upon Fernando and Isabel to rescind their solemn guarantee of letting the Muslims exercise their religion and preserve their customs \"forevermore\" {para siempre jamás.) In 1499 Cisneros himself came to Granada to enforce baptism on the entire population. He hurled thousands of Arabic books into bonfires, irreplaceable manuscripts on religion, politics, and law. 38 By some twist of legality, he succeeded in consecrating the Great Mosque on the Albaicin, symbol of the identity of Granada's Moors, as the Church of San Salvador. Cajoling and bribing many people, he stunned them into conversions en masse. Soon it was apparent that the conversions were no more than skin-deep, and Cisneros turned from persuasion to persecution. He sent many principal citizens to prison, others he drove to flight; finally he touched off armed resistance in the more valiant. Late one night they left their silk-weaving looms, dyeing vats, tanneries, and cobbler, bake and butcher shops and assailed Cardinal Cisneros' residence (a stronghold in downtown Granada). At daybreak they were on the verge of storming it when Count Iñigo arrived with a superior force and dispersed them. Offended at seeing their trusted governor rescue their enemy, the Moors withdrew behind the walls of the Albaicin 38\n\nMiguel Lafuente de Alcantara, Historia de Granada, IV, 162, says that Cisneros burned 1,025,000 priceless Arabic manuscripts.

They chose forty men among themselves and established their own government. Entrenching themselves on top of their hill, they faced the Alhambra fortress defiantly from there. The revolt lasted ten days. To regain the people's confidence, Count Iñigo sent them his esquire with his own shield as a customary token of peace, but the shield was returned to him, stoned to pieces. Only Fray Hernando de Talavera succeeded in appealing to the rebels. In all of the seven years, he had patiently worked to convert the Muslims by kindness and good example, never by coercion. Now he walked humbly among them, unprotected by an escort, and having calmed the Moors, he opened a new avenue for the Count. Tendilla's dramatic gestures toward reestablishing his good relations with his people have become legendary. When he rode onto the major square on the Albaicin among the seething throngs, he tore his red bonnet from his head and threw it into their midst as his ultimate sign of peaceful intentions. It is said that the Moors, seeing the shining bald pate of their Viceroy for the first time, were so stupefied that many did not recognize him. (In later years the Count was to wear a white wig.) 39 They picked up the bonnet, kissed it reverently, and handed it back to him. But when the Count requested them to surrender their arms so that he could leave Granada for the court to prevail upon the King and Queen to pardon them, the Moors refused. The monarchs, they declared, could not be trusted since they had broken the peace agreement. In order to gain their confidence, the Count now offered to leave his wife and children as hostages with them for his word. While the Moors demurred, Count Iñigo, who did not wish to let them out of his sight as long as they held on to their weapons, sent for the Countess. Doña Francisca would have been waiting for her husband in the safety of her mansion behind the strong walls of the Alhambra fortress. When the Count's lieutenants appeared before her with the strange request to join him in the Moorish quarter, she went back with them to the Albaicin at once, taking two of her small children with her. Despite the Moorish mob that had recently been 39 I am grateful to Sr. Don Jesús Bermúdez for showing me Count Iñigo's portrait. It is presently in the Washington Irving Room of the Arabic Royal Palace and is reproduced here by his kind permission.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n21\n\nso angry, Countess Francisca moved into a house next to the Great Mosque, staying there as long as her husband was absent from Granada. Overwhelmed by the Tendilla couple's trust and chivalry, the Moors surrendered their arms; then Count Iñigo traveled to Seville to plead with the Catholic Kings for better treatment of the Moors. Probably he also effected at the same time the removal of Cisneros from Granada. 40 It is the only time Don Diego's (future) mother is mentioned individually. This manifestation of courage, this obedience to a husband's wishes, is impressive. She must have freely shared her husband's tolerance of the Moors and his humane convictions. Though the town reverted to its former calm, the example of the revolt on the Albaicin sparked similar revolts in the surrounding mountains. The Alpujarras southeast of Granada were thickly sprinkled with Moorish villages whose inhabitants (frugal mountaineers who grew mulberry trees and cultivated silkworms), like the town's people, had never been fought or subdued. Soon, a mountain war was ablaze. It fell to the Count of Tendilla, assisted by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (the later \"Great Captain\" who had learned warfare under Tendilla) and to King Fernando in person to fight this rekindled war in the new theater with superior force. By 1501 Christian victory was total. Now the Catholic Kings dropped all pretense of tolerance. Availing themselves anew of Cisneros' counsel, in 1502 they decreed that every Moor in the kingdom of Granada had to undergo baptism, or, under penalty of death, leave Castile—a law little different from that applying to the Jews ten years earlier (except that it did not touch the Moors of Valencia, Aragon, and Catalonia). The cross was now erected in every mosque, and the Moors who remained and became converted—the majority—were called \"Moriscos\" from then on. But under the tolerant administration of Tendilla and his successors, the law on the books remained one thing and its execution quite 40 See the sources in note 38, above. For more on Count Iñigo's actions, see Cepeda Adán, \"Andalucía en 1508,\" pp. 3-28; G P I, 3-26; Luis del Mármol Carvajal, Historia del rebelión y castigo de los moriscos del reyno de Granada, in ΒΛΕ XXI, Historiadores I, 155; Layna Serrano, Historia de Guadalajara, II, 291.

For almost seventy years, the Moriscos succeeded in circumventing this law. When Don Diego returned to Granada in 1569, the same mountain war was being fought all over again by the grandsons and great-grandsons of the parties involved in 1500, under the same basic conditions that had prevailed a year or two before his birth. By the time Don Diego was only about four years old, his mother apparently was not living. In 1508 the Count's eldest son Don Luis, then nineteen, was spending the summer with his household—he probably was already married—in Alhama, and his father sent Don Luis' little brothers, the hermanillos, along with him to escape the summer heat in Granada. A friend of the Count, who lived not far from Alhama, wrote Count Iñigo, inviting the children to his house, and the father, replying that they had already gone with Don Luis, seemed to regret that Don Yñigo Manrique's invitation had come too late. \"For all m y sins,\" he wrote, \"they need someone who is kind to them. I know well that they would have fared better in the house of Señora doña Ysabel whose hands I kiss [the wife of the addressed, presumably], than in a place where [the grown-ups] do not yet know what children are.\" 4 1 The Count does not mention his wife in this correspondence, nor in other letters of that year. But the hermanillos—too young to be in college or doing page-service at the royal court—were still in their father's house and in need of kindness. They would be Don Diego, about four years old, and the older Don Francisco and Doña Isabel, children still. Apparently the atmosphere around Don Luis was not a kind one to children; the young man was not yet a father. 42 In later years, Don Luis and Don Diego were never close. T h e elder brother brought law suits against the younger for the regulation of their properties; and we are told, also, that Don Luis resented being a head shorter than Don Antonio, the second of the brothers. 43 The impression is that Don Luis, as the future head of 41 Cepeda Adán, \"Andalucía en 1508,\" p. 36. 42 His first son, who did not survive, was born perhaps a year or two later; the second son, his heir Don Iñigo, was born in 1511; Caro Baroja, Moriscos, p. 142. 43 G.

Fué este marqués [Mondéjar II] devoto y liberal;\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n23\n\nthe Mondéjar-Tendilla branch of the Mendoza clan, carried himself pompously, lacking humor—the kind of person who would regard children as pests. Having lost his mother so early, Don Diego must have been thrown chiefly upon the affection of his aging father, who was spending the rest of his energies mostly in intellectual pursuits, surrounded by humanists, m a n y of them learned Moriscos and Marranos. 44 But the Count often went on inspection tours of the coastal fortifications, and he also undertook several military campaigns. In his old age, he sold some of his property to raise a private army and valiantly marched his famous banner against unruly Andalusian grandees at Gibraltar who had broken away from King Fernando. 45 (For this contribution, the Catholic King raised the Count to Marquis of Mondéjar.) 4 6 Perhaps his father's frequent absences were the reason that Diego regarded the estate of sympathetic neighbors as his second home early in life. On the Generalife lived the former Moorish prince, Ben Omar (Don Alonso de Granada y Venegas), alcaide of this summer palace of the Nasirid kings. He had married Count Iñigo's cousin Doña María (or Juana) de Mendoza and raised a family— at least a son, Don Pedro de Granada Venegas y Mendoza—of the approximate age of Don Diego. The buildings and gardens of the Generalife cover a hillside on the neighboring mountain, separated from the Alhambra hill by a deep ravine. A secret door on the north side of the Alhambra fortress led (and leads) to the well-camouflaged former royal path connecting both places that Don Diego must have crossed many parescía caña fistola siempre; riyó pocas veces, regañó infinitas; tuvo cuatro hermanos, los dos siete palmos mas altos que él. . . .\" 44 Previous to 1492, Count Iñigo had a Jewish majordomo and a Jewish physician; afterwards they and others may have continued to stay with him as conversos. See Fritz Baer, Die Juden im christlichen Spanien, I, part 2, 348, 426. 45 In the Mendozas' quartered emblem, a red diagonal stripe, edged in gold on a field of green, appears on the top and bottom fields; the two lateral golden fields have in azure letters the legend Ave Maria Gratia Plena, which was earned by their ancestor Garcilaso de la Vega in the battle of Salado against the Moors.

In his correspondence from Granada during 1569-1572, as well as in the Guerra de Granada, the only local person he mentions with any sympathy is the then-living owner and heir of the same house, Don Alonso de Granada Venegas y Rengifo, whom Don Diego calls his compañero.49 Whether Mendoza had a certain right to a lease on one of the estates on the Generalife (none is mentioned in his father's testament nor in his own), or whether he later rented a house on those grounds, or had an invitation for life to retire there—whatever the legal arrangements, it was his home, a sign that this half-Moorish family had close ties with him. Catholic orthodoxies did not hold Don Diego in thrall; he showed little need for religion—an atypical trait in a Spaniard. Neither the Virgin Mary nor the Saints appeared in his vocabulary. Would his exceptional childhood environment have influenced him into developing such an unusual attitude? Perhaps this happened in part because Doña Francisca had not been there to instill in her youngest son a worship of Mary. Despite her remote non-Christian descent, the Countess, like all Castilian noblewomen of her generation, must have been a devout Catholic, and a mother is possibly the most important influence in raising her child in religious devotion and belief. Instead, the elders who guided the young Diego, 47 On title to Generalife, see Antonio Gallego Morell, ed. Casa de los Tiros: Guías de los Museos de España, XI, 13; Luis Seco de Lucena, La Alhambra como fué y como es.

This peculiar circumstance of Mendoza's childhood may be a reason for his later individuality and originality. H e could become the future irreverent writer so easily because he was allowed to grow up uncowed by religious mysteries, frankly enlightened in the house of his exceptionally tolerant and imaginative father. Also, one of his two eldest sisters, both women of outstanding intelligence who had received a humanist education, was still at home (María Pacheco, who did not marry before 1510); and his nurse, the \"Señora Montalto,\" was presumably a Morisca. (Seventy years later, Don Diego's favorite servants in Granada still were \"New Christians.\") 50 But since the New Christians of his environment literally had been touched by few, if any, drops of holy water at their recent mass baptism, Don Diego grew up among a probably somewhat cynical company. By coincidence, he was born just when Spain's greatest champion of Catholicism, the Queen of Castile, was silenced. No appeal to religion was to be heard again with similar emphasis and power until Philip II reached the maturity and influence of middle age. Queen Isabel was dead. The body of the venerated monarch rested only a few steps away from Diego's house, in the Franciscan convent that the Count of Tendilla had installed in the Arabic palace adjoining his own. (It is now the Parador of San Francisco.) Her tombstone stood in the same small chapel that contained Doña Francisca's sepulcher. The conqueror of Granada and the wife of her Viceroy in that kingdom lay under a graceful ajimez—a window similar to one above the Lion's Court, divided by two slender columns into three round-arched partitions. The wall of the chapel still showed (and show today) Hispano-Mauresque traceries. There, as in the Alcázar, decorative inscriptions, elegantly interlaced with foliage patterns, spell in Arabic letters \"God, the only victor\"; others praise a Granadme king. 51 50\n\nOn the nurse, see G P III, 265, 266. In Mendoza's testament, among servants remembered for back pay and legacies, were \"New Christians\"; see C. Pérez Pastor, Memorias, pp. 153-194, fol. 814. 51 T h e bodies of Queen Isabel and King Fernando were transferred under Don Luis' direction in 1521 to the royal chapel of the new Cathedral of Granada. There is no trace of the tombs of Mendoza's parents in the old chapel on the Alhambra.\n\n26\n\nSON OF T H E A L H A M B R A\n\nWhenever the boy visited the graves, perhaps from filial piety or ceremonial duty, would the religious atmosphere have attracted or cowed him? Or would he rather have checked his progress in Arabic—the language now officially despised, but not yet forbidden —by trying to decipher the script on the wall? Presumably a precocious and observant child, tended at every step by nurses, grooms, and retainers, all drawn from the recently \"converted\" people, he must have been aware that the Queen's edict against the Moors had remained a dead letter. Neither did the late Queen, who could not conquer the hearts of the Moriscos, have the power to direct the path of his own personal religiosity. H e had absorbed his spirit of doubt and criticism early—if not with the milk of his (possibly) Morisca nurse, then perhaps as an attentive listener to his father's conversations. The shrine was to the right of Tendilla's house; to the left, further down, stood (and stands) the old Alcazaba fortress, where a garrison of hundreds of soldiers was stationed under the Count's command. Between the chanting of the monks on the one side, and martial music, drums, trumpets, on the other, Diego was exposed to the two contending forces that sought to determine his life. But it is possible that even then neither the cloister nor the military attracted him—at least far less than the books, manuscripts, and mathematical instruments he would have found in his father's Arabic house. As a philosopher, he would often quote Aristotle: \"From an upward movement and another, going downward, results the diagonal; for this we must look.\"52 Perhaps his early location between two extremes predisposed him toward his ideal of the middle way. As the youngest child, Don Diego was forced to compete at great odds with the achievements of his elders. He may have tried, consciously or unconsciously, to overcompensate for the head start the others had, not only in time and opportunity but even, unfairly as it seems, in money. This does not refer to the universal heir, Don Luis, who, under the law of primogeniture, received literally everything. (Either the Count was not wealthy enough or the time had passed to establish more than one mayorazgo, or entailed estate, per family. His grandfather, the Marquis of San52 Mendoza to Arras, Rome, February 11, 1550. AC, p. 198.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n27\n\ntillana, had been able to found seven mayorazgos, even though the six of the segundones were of relatively modest size.) Oddly, Don Antonio, an adult at the time of his father's death, received twice as much income-producing property as his young brothers Francisco and Diego; also Bernardino received a legacy that, although not specified in his father's testament, seems to have been larger than that of those least favored. An hijo bastardo, Don Pedro, in his turn, was dismissed with a lump sum of 100,000 maravedis— no more than the annual amount conceded to Francisco and Diego each. 53 Yet this was not simply a parental caprice. The younger sons were destined for the Church. If any of them took after their great-uncle, theirs could be the most lucrative of all businesses. The second and third sons, selected for political careers as courtiers, perhaps already engaged to be married by parental contract, required a higher guaranteed income than the future clerics, who would be gaining benefices in the course of their careers. It has been variously asserted and denied that Don Diego was ever destined for a career in the Church, 54 but it is unlikely that Count Iñigo had intended another future for him. Both his financial provision for Diego—similar to that of the older ecclesiastic-to-be, Francisco—and his Cardinal-brother's name, with which he had honored his youngest son, point in the clerical direction. 55 53\n\nG P I, 43; III, 265, 266. Cf. G P I, 69-71. 55 Don Diego's uncle, Diego Hurtado, at first Bishop of Palencia, then Archbishop of Seville and Cardinal, who had grown up under the protection of the Grand Cardinal without ever acquiring a similar political or even personal eminence, died on September 13, 1502, leaving two sons. H e had been very close to his brother, Tendilla II. I n his testament, the Count ordered ten thousand masses said for the soul of his brother Diego, the same commemoration accorded the souls of his first and second wives. G P I, 22; III, 256. 54\n\n2.

Don Diego in 1549 1\n\nEducational\n\nClimate\n\nhalf brothers, and first cousins, Don Diego is the only one who left evidence of intellectual activity. W e have little information of the kind of education predisposing him for that. His only autobiographical remarks known to us are those he made later in life to Ambrosio de Morales, one of Philip II's official chroniclers, who dedicated a book to him. (Morales, an archeologist, numismatist, and a generally erudite person, was interested in studying Mendoza's famous collection of ancient coins. Don Diego taught him all he knew about it; some of his treasures he gave him, others he let him borrow, just as he generously lent out his books and manuscripts to other scientists and men of letters who enjoyed his patronage. Probably he gave him money, because this is, after all, the duty of maecenases.) In order to document the testimonial preface of his book, Morales asked Don Diego some questions about his studies. Mendoza told the author that he had studied Latin, Greek, and Arabic in Granada and Salamanca, and later there the civil and canonical law; he had followed this by traversing a good part of AMONG ALL OF HIS MANY BROTHERS,\n\n1 \" . . . vieramonos en Toledo tan jovenes . . . ,\" R. Foulché-Delbosc, ed., Archivo de Investigaciones Históricas (AIΗ) II, 193.\n\nFORMATIVE YEARS, TO 1529\n\n29\n\nSpain in search of ancient sculpture, much of which he dug up; and then he had gone to Italy. 2 Don Diego gives no dates for his studies in Granada and Salamanca, but possibly he remained in Granada during the life of his father. Count Iñigo (then the Marquis of Mondéjar) died in July, 1515. When he was laid to rest next to the sepulcher of his wife in the Franciscan convent on the Alhambra, all his sons accompanied the funeral procession. Since Don Diego was around twelve, the usual age for commencing college studies, it seems likely that he departed for Salamanca shortly afterward. Determining Mendoza's exact movements as a boy and young man may be guesswork, but this much is clear: he lived his formative years during an unusual, open period in Spain, the splendor of which has been overshadowed by the later Spain of the Counter Reformation and by the next century's \"Golden Age\" of great literature. It is now recognized more generally that, for Spain, the first half of the sixteenth century was a unique time, a sort of reprieve. By the beginning of the era, the Inquisition, under the reign of Queen Isabel, was on its way toward establishing a tyrann y over the minds of the people. About sixty years later, Philip II ended the era by taking up the process which the Queen's death had interrupted. Don Diego was a product of the interregnum, when conditions in Spain were often chaotic. At first, the nominally united country almost fell apart because Fernando of Aragon's influence on the Catholic Queen's kingdom ended with the accession to the Castilian throne of Queen Juana and her husband, Philip the Fair of Habsburg, Duke of Burgundy, Archduke of Austria. With Philip's sudden death (1506), Fernando took over the regency of Castile in the name of his widowed and incompetent daughter. But the King was much more interested in territorial expansion than in suppressing the thoughts of Castilians and Aragonese. After his death in 1516, a series of regents alternated in Spain with infrequent, short appearances of the new King, Charles I (who was the Emperor Charles V ) . During many years when Charles was absent, Francisco de los Cobos, the easy-going minister of finance, was the 2 GP III, p. 472.\n\n30\n\nSON OF T H E A L H A M B R A\n\nde facto ruler. Until Philip II's return in 1559 as King, Spain had no consistent, single, strong authority. During the early part of that time, foreign influences—that of Erasmus and the Italian Renaissance—could enter Spain relatively unchecked. That intellectually splendid period of the Spanish Renaissance for the first time enabled a Castilian feudal noble to become a full-fledged secular intellectual. To be sure, this continued to be unusual. Mendoza practically stepped out of his class when he followed his real interests. Aside from the poet Garcilaso de la Vega (also one of Mendoza's—more distant—relatives), or Luis de Avila y Zúñiga (his friend and colleague in the Emperor's service, who was a fluent though not profound writer), few nobles wrote outstanding works. By and large, this abortive enlightenment was carried along by the relatively small middle class that furnished the professional educators and writers, many of them \"Erasmians,\" people of sometimes humble or uncertain, often converso, origin. Among the lights of a slightly older generation are Juan Luis Vives, Juan de Sepúlveda, Antonio Agustín; among the younger, Jerónimo Zurita and Juan Páez de Castro. But in this \"open\" period, irrational, mystic movements, like illuminism, were also able to spread. And stiff-necked scholasticism could find new voices to champion tradition—it was the era as well of Domingo de Soto and Melchor Cano. Since Don Diego had already learned Latin, Greek, and Arabic in Granada, he could hardly have studied with Peter Martyr, Count Iñigo's most famous protege, Latin teacher of Don Luis and perhaps of his other brothers. Martyr, who conducted a Latin school for the young nobles at court, was to be found wherever the itinerant royal court stopped for a while—Valladolid, Burgos, Seville, Madrid, and even in Tordesillas, residence of the mad Queen. In 1511, when the court spent more than six months in Seville, Count Iñigo joined King Fernando for the duration of his residence in Andalusia. 3 He may have brought Diego, then six or seven, along with him for some elementary grounding in Latin. Martyr finally settled in Granada not long before he died there in 1526, but by then Don Diego had long left his native town. 3 Peter Martyr to Pedro Fajardo, March 15, 1511: \" . . . mi Conde de Tendilla en estos momentos lo tenemos a él presente en la corte . . . ,\" in \"Epistolario de Pedro Martir de Anglería,\" DIE 10 (1953), 348.\n\nFORMATIVE YEARS, TO 1 5 2 9\n\n31\n\nAnother, more versatile, noted educator formed part of Count Iñigo's household during Don Diego's childhood—Hernan Núñez, the so-called Greek Commander, who taught Greek and Arabic, as well as Latin, and who stayed there at least until 1509 and possibly longer. 4 He might have been the one to give the very young Diego a rudimentary knowledge of Greek. Simultaneously, or later, the boy continued his study with an unknown teacher in downtown Granada. In those years, we are told, the hijos of the Count of Tendilla \"every day walked down the hill from the Alhambra into town to be taught by a teacher of grammar.\" (Hijos might refer to Don Diego and Don Francisco, but possibly also to Don Pedro, the illegitimate son, and perhaps Doña Isabel.) The hijos were accompanied by the future religious poet Fray Luis de Granada, who was of the same age as Don Diego and who served as page in the Count's household. One of his duties was to carry the books of the young lords as he trudged behind them on their way to and from school, but he studied together with them. 5 Intermittent\n\nAppearances\n\nin Spain and\n\nItaly\n\nDon Diego's adolescence fell into the early years of the reign of Charles I, the young Habsburg of Flemish birth, who was still in Flanders in 1516 when he took up his heritage on the death of his grandfather, King Fernando. The Mendozas were alert to the new era: Don Antonio formed part of a group of Spanish officials hastening at once to Flanders to attach themselves to the boy-king. This group included Francisco de los Cobos, old Count Iñigo's former protégé, who had succeeded Hernando de Zafra as secretary for civilian affairs in Granada. His trip with Don Antonio signifies the start of their close association in the coming administration; Cobos and the Mendozas were to help each other to the lion's share of Royal-Imperial power. Since the young monarch's 4\n\nAguado Bleye, Manual, II, 223. This story has been doubted, possibly because it seems incongruous to think of Mendoza and Fray Luis de Granada as having shared juvenile impressions and education in such a close contact. But Don Pedro de Granada, first Marquis of \"Campo-Rey\" or Campotéjar, son of Don Alonso de Granada Venegas, stated that he learned this from Fray Luis personally.

In ten to fifteen years the Spaniards were all to come out on top. In 1517, when Charles, seventeen, visited Spain for the first time, Don Diego was in all likelihood still in Salamanca. The young foreign-born monarch's first contact with his mother's country was not successful. The Spaniards disliked his looks, his slowness of speech, his ignorance of the \"Romance\" language; and one and all disapproved of the Flemings in his entourage who conducted themselves indiscreetly, grabbing powerful positions in Spain, extorting financial contributions. When Charles left the country in May 1520 in order to accept his new dignity of German Emperor-elect, Spain's resentment exploded in revolt: the civil war of the Comunidades (communities) spread from Toledo over most of Castile, that of the Hermandades (brotherhoods) over Valencia. 6 Of Don Diego we know nothing during the two years the war raged throughout the country. If he was not any more at school, he might have been with one or another of his brothers. Don Antonio did not accompany the King this time; he stayed behind to marry and settle down on his estate. 7 Both he and Don Bernardino were soon to appear as military assistants to the Marquis Don Luis in Granada; in the King's name they put down the Comunero revolt in the few places it had caught on in the Morisco kingdom. Don Diego might have done military service at their side. Or possibly he might have gone to Rome with Don Francisco who served Pope Leo X as chamberlain. 8 H e was not, we may be sure, with his sister Doña María Pacheco, wife of the first leader of the 6 For new studies of the Comunero movement, see José A.

The heroine of the movement, she kept up the rebellion in Toledo even after the defeat of the Comunidades by the Royalists and the execution of Padilla. In the end, her own townspeople surrendered and she had to flee for her life to Portugal. 9 Doña Maria's amazing individuality and talent (no less than her youngest brother, she knew Latin, Greek, mathematics, history, and poetry), indirectly throws light on the personality of Don Diego. Like his sister, he was apt to do something shockingly unexpected. Although her brothers petitioned Charles V for clemency in Doña Maria's behalf, he never forgave this turbulent woman. 10 From this we might guess that Don Diego, whatever side he may have felt sympathy for during the conflict, did not fight for the Comuneros at any time. Had he done so, the Emperor would not later have given him his complete trust for twenty-two years. In Italy, says Morales, \"you took part in the war, in the rank suitable to your person. You divided your year this way: In summer you assisted in the War. In winter you went to Rome and to Padua and to other universities.\" 11 But when did Mendoza first go to Italy? Twice, he says in his old age, he had seen Rome in times of sede vacante.12 One of these occasions was the conclave after the death of Paul III (1549-1550); the other, doubtful, occasion might refer to one of the conclaves following the deaths, respectively, of Leo X in December 1521, of Adrian VI on September 13, 1523, or of Clement VII on September 25, 1534. During 1534, though, Don Diego was in Charles V's personal service, and the Emperor happened to be in Spain. It is more plausible that he chanced to be in Rome at the preceding sede vacante, 1523, when Clement VII was elected. He recalls later that the father of Cardinal Salviati had introduced both him and the young Cardinal into the service of Clement VII. He does not mention in which capacity he served 9\n\nGP I, 42.

If at the beginning of Clement's reign, Don Diego could have combined his attendance at the papal court with his studies at the Sapienza, the university of Rome. But he may just as well have been in Rome at the death of Leo X in 1521. The evidence is uncertain, too, about the dates and places of his participation in \"the War,\" that is, the endless contest between France and Spain for the possession of Italy. The Spaniards, aptly, felt \"the W a r \" to be a permanent institution. In the early twenties, the balance of the seesawing struggle seemed to favor the King of France, Francis I; in 1524, the Most Christian King's troops had dispelled the Imperial army, which was laying siege to Marseilles, and in October of that year Francis I was seizing Milan. In the Guerra de Granada (written 1571 or 1572), Don Diego compares the later Christian armies under Philip II's lieutenants unfavorably with \"the m a n y disciplined and reputable armies in which I found myself, led by the Emperor Don Carlos, the others by King Francis of France.\" 14 He refers to the campaigns of Charles V in which he had taken part—the conquest of Tunis in 1535, and the invasion of Provence in 1536, where the French armies did not come out to meet the Imperials in battle. But unless he had confronted the king of France in an earlier campaign (that of Spain's recapture of Navarre in 1521, perhaps), he could not have seen Francis I at war except at the battle of Pavia of 1525. There, the Spanish commander Antonio de Leiva provoked the French King to an encounter between French and Imperial troops on the outskirts of Pavia. According to Sandoval, Francis I had his horse killed under him and fell to the ground. The first to seize the King was Juanes de Urbieta, a Basque soldier \"from the troop of Don Diego de Mendoza.\" Later on, the chronicler refers to \"another\" man-of-arms from Granada, Diego de Avila, 15 which implies that the regiment of Juanes de Urbieta—the one commanded by Don Diego de Mendoza—was precisely the one from Granada. Even though there is nothing else to support this identification, Sandoval's reference cannot possibly apply to anyone 13\n\nMendoza to Arras, Rome, December 1, 1549; AC, p. 137. Quoted from edition by Manuel Gómez Moreno in ΜHE, XLIX, 147. (G. de Gr.) 15 Sandoval, Historia, II, 87. 14\n\nFORMATIVE YEARS, TO 1529\n\n35\n\nelse. True, the name \"Don Diego de Mendoza\" seems ubiquitous in Spanish history, but at Pavia in 1525, none of Don Diego's homonyms could have taken the place of \"Don Diego de Mendoza from Granada.\" 16 It is therefore quite safe to assume that he was at Pavia, leading his own detachment \"suitable to his rank,\" as Morales had indicated. But he did not do anything of particular distinction, because Sandoval does not mention him again. Later that year, we find Mendoza in Toledo. The young emperor had summoned the Cortes there, just when the bulk of his victorious army was returning from Italy with the royal prisoner. The unexpected extent of the victory made these Cortes a triumphant occasion. Ambassadors from France, England, Portugal, Venice, Africa, and even Persia were present; so were the Papal legate Salviati, almost all the Castilian grandees, and lastly, Charles Lannoy, the Imperial Viceroy of Naples, who had conveyed the captive king to Spain and left him confined in Madrid. The whole world gathered in small Toledo, the town still largely battered from María Pacheco's fatal reign of only three years before. Among this beehive of people appeared two young men, Don Diego and Don Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, later the third Duke of Alba. In September 1549, when the then Duke of Alba was at the Emperor's court in Brussels, Don Diego wrote to him from Rome: \"Regarding [a frivolous allusion] we are still so green as we were in Toledo.\" 17 And in the same letter: \"Oh that we were still so young as in Toledo!\" Also, in April 1551, to the same, from Siena: \"You must see to it that your history be corrected by this wicked secretary [Don Diego himself], unless you want him to publish how badly you behaved in the alley of Toledo, where I gave an example of m y manliness, which now shines splendidly in these republics.\" 18 These references point to the Cortes of 1525. 16\n\nFor example, the Duke of Infantado, over seventy and ailing with gout, was in Guadalajara at the time; another namesake, also an old man, the Conde de Mélito, Viceroy of Valencia, was not at Pavia, either; and the Duke of Infantado's grandson and namesake was five years old in 1525; besides, at that time no other Diego de Mendoza came from Granada. 17 \". . . tan verdes nos estamos como in Toledo . . . ,\" ΑΙΗ 2: 193. 18 \". . . quan mal se huvo con la callejuela de Toledo, donde yo di el exemplo de mi virtud . . . ,\" AIH 2: 537.\n\n36\n\nSON OF THE ALHAMBRA\n\nAt no other period of their lives would Don Diego, then about twenty-one, and the future Alba, about eighteen, have been \"so green\" together—certainly not when Medoza met Don Fernando (who was Duke of Alba then, and married) again in Toledo, in the not so joyful winter of 1538/39. The events in the \"alley of Toledo\" that Mendoza alludes to were doubtless amorous adventures, a result of which, presumably, was the future Duke of Alba's illegitimate son.19 The time of these Cortes was for many Spaniards the best time of the entire century. 20 They had reason to rejoice in the presence of their young King, a favor so seldom granted them. Much as they formerly disliked him, now they appreciated him. He had shown clemency to so many participants in the Comunidades that the grievances of the few whom he never pardoned did not count The people were grateful, also, that he had worked hard to become a Spaniard. Now he spoke to them in \"Romance,\" and he bowed to the wish of the Cortes—it happened to coincide with his own— when he decided to marry his beautiful cousin Isabel, the wealthy princess of Portugal. The Cortes also demanded that all government officials in the Empire be replaced by Spaniards. Charles V, in order to obtain the Imperial dignity, had given the Germans his oath to put and keep Germans in all leading positions; he did not commit himself on this point to the Castilian Cortes. But a look at his domains not too many years later shows Spaniards in all important positions of the World Imperium (except for the Granvelles, father and son, from Burgundy, but they were glad to identify with the Spanish ruling caste). Not the least of these positions would be held by two presently carefree \"green\" fellows 19 See the notices about \"El prior Don Hernando de Toledo, hijo bastardo del Duque de Alba,\" in Mariano D. Berrueta, El gran Duque de Alba, pp. 59-73. On p. 64, the approximate date of the illegitimate son's birth is speculated to be 1527 or 1528; it might as well have been 1526. 20 The \"anonymous\" author of Lazarillo de Tormes gave this mood expression almost thirty years later when he let Lázaro conclude with these nostalgic words: \"This was the same year when our victorious Emperor entered the famous town of Toledo and had the Cortes there, with great rejoicing and feasts as you m a y have heard. For at that time I was prosperous and at the summit of all good fortune.\" Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, La Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, Biblioteca Universal, LXXIX, 78.\n\nFORMATIVE YEARS, TO 1529\n\n37\n\nwho in 1525 expressed their exuberance chasing the young wenches of Toledo. The Emperor set King Francis free under humiliating peace conditions. Then, in the exalted mood of a great victor (as far as his cautious nature would lend itself to such a mood), he went off to marry his princess in Seville and take her on their honeymoon to Granada. Spain was still jubilant, but Italy and much of Europe were in a different mood. In their eyes, the unfortunate royal prisoner was at least the moral victor. Almost the entire non-Imperial world joined Francis I in the \"League of Cognac,\" signed in 1526 between France, Pope Clement VII, Milan, Genoa, Florence, and Venice, while England and the Turks looked on with sympathy. The world was anxious to dispatch the Emperor's power from Italy. They saw the current situation correctly as the last opportunity to prevent Charles V from growing into the \"universal\" monarch. Against that coalition, Charles de Lannoy's armies, in thirty ships with eight thousand men, returned to Italy, and so, probably as one of the captains, did Don Diego. Forty-five years later, he praises the prowess of these armies. In the Guerra de Granada he shakes his head at the poor showing the Christian Spaniards were making in the face of a much smaller number of Moriscos, and recalls: \"What a sight this is for those in the know who have seen Don Antonio de Leiva challenging the entire League [of Cognac] of forty thousand infantry, nine thousand cavalry—and the city [Milan] hostile besides. H e encircled it with only seven thousand infantry, resisted the enemies, laid siege to the citadel, and in the end he took it, throwing out the enemies, and pursuing those who were strong and united, the flower of Italy, soldiers and captains! 21 The outstanding Spanish general to whom Don Diego fondly tenders posthumous laurels is Don Antonio de Leiva; greater admiration he showed none of the many other generals he had known. (Leiva had learned warfare as a boy in the Moorish W a r of 1500-1501 under Count Iñigo and the Great Captain.) But Don Diego makes no mention of any distinguished military action of 21 G. de Gr., p. 166.\n\n38\n\nSON OF THE ALHAMBRA\n\nhis own. He declares only that he had \"seen\" Leiva in action. Perhaps he was already training himself to be the exemplary historian of war, the \"Spanish Sallust,\" he was later to become. Student\n\nin\n\nItaly\n\nAgain it is Morales who gives us the only information about Mendoza's studies in Italy: \"You had eminent teachers, such as Agustín Nypho, Montesdoca, and others. You listened to their lectures on logic, philosophy, and mathematics. 22 Agostino Nifo (1473-1546) taught at the Roman Sapienza until the great upset by the sack of Rome (1527), so Don Diego, whose presence in Rome by October 1526 is noted by the Imperial ambassador, 23 would have attended Nifo's courses in the fall and winter of 1526/27. It was Don Diego's last chance to sit at Nifo's feet, for in May 1527 Charles V's Spanish and German armies descended on Rome and destroyed the university as well. Professors and students fled for their lives, as did half the population, including writers, artists, cardinals, ambassadors, princesses, Jews (some of them refugees in the great Spanish exodus of 1492), and even resident Spaniards (like Sepúlveda who escaped to Naples) and Germans. Many refugees rushed down the Tiber to Civitavecchia where "
