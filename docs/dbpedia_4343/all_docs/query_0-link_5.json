A mere chapter of my two-volume dissertation (1994) was devoted to Alonso Carrió’s exposé, but the imprint of my graduate studies and of my dissertation committee on this study is clearly visible: Cedomil Goic and Charles Fraker will readily recognize this influence. My general thinking about the eighteenth century has changed since that time, thanks to not only my colleagues in the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies (ASECS) who teach and research the viceregal period but also to a number of graduate students at the University of Virginia, the University of Rhode Island, and the University of Massachusetts who have taken my courses in Charlottesville and Salamanca. I owe a great deal to members of the Iberoamerican Society, an ASECS affiliate, and to Karen Stolley, Pedro Lasarte, Rolena Adorno, Raquel Chang-Rodríguez, Margaret Ewalt, L. Elena Delgado, Raúl Marrero-Fente, Maureen Ahern, Ralph Bauer, and Mariselle Meléndez. A large chunk of this study was inspired by my conversations at the John Carter Brown Library with James Muldoon, whose generosity of intellect and spirit I can never repay. Other colleagues in history (Joan Bristol, Karen Racine, Lance Grahn) aided me in ways that they have probably forgotten. Colleagues at the University of Virginia, such as Richard Handler, Alison Weber, David Gies, David Haberly and Michael Gerli, each contributed to this book in different ways. I am grateful to friends and loved ones who kept me going with their love, music, color, and company: Letizia Modena, Teresa Sanhueza, María Carrión, Regina Rush, Adina Galan and Donald Breen, Elizabeth Giráldez, Diane Mulroney and Brad Ellis, and Raina O’Neal. Generous financial and logistical support for this study was provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities; the John Carter Brown Library and the John Hay Library at Brown University; the Interlibrary Loan Office, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, the vice president for Research and Graduate Studies, and Special Collections at the University of Virginia; and Special Collections at the Johns Hopkins University Milton S.

Eisenhower Library and at the John Carter Brown Library for their professionalism and kindness. Both of these institutions also gave their kind permission when I asked to include in this study reproductions of maps and illustrations from their holdings. I am indebted to Joan Vidal for her fine copyediting, and to Andix Indexing Associates for producing the index. Finally, I thank everyone at Vanderbilt University Press who has had a hand in this project. I am eternally grateful to my superb editor, Betsy Phillips, who had confidence in this book when my own teetered. Sue Havlish and Dariel Mayer were helpful beyond belief.

Its author, Alonso Carrió de ­Lavandera (1715–1783), was a Spaniard who spent nearly fifty years in the viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru, trading, serving the Crown in a variety of capacities, and building a family and lifelong friendships.1 In 1767 the Crown commissioned Carrió de Lavandera to escort the exiled Jesuits out of Peru. A few years later, between 1771 and 1773, he was commissioned to conduct a review and personal inspection of the postal system in the Viceroyalty of Peru. This was the motivation for El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes. The relationship between Concolorcorvo (the alleged Inca scribe to whom Carrió attributed his exposé) and Calixto Bustamante (the man who accompanied Carrió on part of his inspection) and the historical relationship between Bustamante and Carrió are issues that I explore later. Here I wish to point out that Carrió, like the inspector of the posts with whom Concolorcorvo dialogues in the account, possessed more than a passing interest in law and economics, and his writings and experiences confirm that he was versed in not only imaginative literature but also philosophy, geography, and history. His experience with a variety of peoples and places compels us to remember that he was directing much of the information in his account to business travelers and that he was speaking to them in a manner designed to make their load seem lighter and their trip shorter. The image of Carrió as bluff and hearty inspector of the posts is largely one of his own account’s making, but much of what the Spaniard wrote in jest about Bourbon Spanish America was no laughing matter. In the jocose anecdote that closes El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes, the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima (which appears over and over in Carrió’s narration) is posed to Spanish residents of Lima by a Spanish resident of Guatemala and then solved in two different ways at the archbishop of Guatemala’s palace in 1746. It was around 1990 that I began to ask myself, “Why Santiago de Guatemala? It was not even part of Carrió’s inspection route. And why 1746, nearly twenty-five years before his inspection of the posts?” Little attention had been paid to the setting of this mock trial, or to its participants, but I became convinced that asking some obvi-\n\nHierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America ous questions would answer many mysteries about Carrió that remained even after the publication of so many critical studies. I did not realize then that answering my own questions would take more than a decade or that the answers would also speak to key issues in the fields of Hispanic, colonial, and imperial studies. The riddle and its solutions together undercut current theoretical notions about colonial identity in general, but there is far more to it than that. My research into the riddle and its solutions prompted me to confront a discursive reality particular to viceregal Spanish America that is not supported by history, or what I loosely call here material reality: the rivalry between criollos (Spaniards born in the New World) and peninsulars (Spaniards born in the Old World).2 The riddle of the 4Ps from Lima laughingly conveys the existence of reform-resistant, mixed (i.e., criollo and peninsular) oligarchical clans (or roscas) who understood hierarchy, commerce, and fraud only too well. This fact in turn holds important implications for Latin Americanists who employ the middle period model. The middle period is a category devised some two decades ago to replace the colonial, late colonial, and independence periods by setting the second half of the eighteenth century against the first.3 It assumes that Bourbon reforms in the second half of the eighteenth century set Spanish America on a course that it would traverse during the nineteenth century. Carrió’s witty anecdote suggests otherwise. It further suggests that scholars have sold Carrió and his century short by approaching El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes as a baroque echo that was deaf to the material reality and discursive options of eighteenth-century Spanish America, which were no less contradictory and polyphonic than those of seventeenth-century Spanish America and were probably more cosmopolitan than those of eighteenth-century France or England. In sum, the mock trial that supposedly took place in Santiago de Guatemala in 1746 was Carrió’s way of putting the cultural practices of his century, and several of his contemporaries from Mexico City to Lima, on trial. To productively engage with Carrió, who has entertained and confounded readers for centuries, we must get on our feet and get our bearings, not in discourse theory but in history. This book is divided into three parts. Part I comprises Chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 1 examines the four areas represented by the first solution to the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima: Pila, Puente, Pan, and Peines—literally, “Fountain,” “Bridge,” “Bread,” and “Los Peines.” Carrió reduced the economic and cultural rivalry between Lima and Mexico City to absurdity—to the four elements mentioned— ­after it served him, ideologically (as a pretext) and rhetorically (as a proemium), for the Guatemalan tale. My reading of the first solution to the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima makes it clear that Pila, Puente, Pan, and Peines were contemporary phenomena for Carrió in 1775. It does so by examining the ostensibly enlightened regime of Viceroy Manuel de Amat y Junient of Peru—a quintessential Bourbon technocrat if there ever was one—and the inspector’s portrait of it throughout El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes. Lima’s claim to fame, I argue, would truly have\n\nIntroduction\n\nbeen a claim to shame had the majority of its elites possessed any. Instead, they manifested an impeccable duplicity, presenting to the Crown in Madrid an image of propriety and sobriety—of Bourbon modernity—while engaging in behaviors that had traditionally been associated with deviants, miscreants, and paupers. Chapter 2 explains the importance of the Pardo de Figueroa clan to eighteenth-century Spain and Spanish America by examining Pedro, Pardo, Paulino, and Perulero, the second solution to the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima. Archbishop Pedro Pardo de Figueroa’s sexual and financial profile provides us with the crucial link between this second solution and the first. My close reading of the mock trial that solves the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima reveals that shame (infamia) was still formidable in Carrió’s times, and it made even a dead archbishop fair game. I do not provide a systematic account of the two types of shame (infamia iuris and infamia facti) then operative in the Spanish world. Instead, I show (1) how the solution Pedro, Pardo, Paulino, and Perulero is tied to both types and (2) the links between the codification of infamia, which began in the twelfth century, and the codification of purity (limpieza) in the Hispanic world, which began in the ­fifteenth. In closing, Chapter 2 demonstrates that the archbishop’s brother, José Pardo de Figueroa, was a prolific author of riddles and a provincial governor (corregidor) in Carrió’s aquaintance. Moreover, among Europeans (thanks largely to the French), he was the best-known Spanish American of the first half of the eighteenth century, and his reputation as a Bourbon encyclopedia of the arts and sciences would continue into the second half of the century. Carrió’s roughing up of both Pardo de Figueroa brothers in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes is an ignored aspect of the inspection report that goes to the very heart of discussions about Bourbon reform and Carrió’s views on Enlightenment culture. Part II addresses the most significant of the economic and political continuities that El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes brings to the fore. Chapter 3 shows (1) that, during the first half of the eighteenth century, illegal trade and the diversion of gold, silver, and mercury were interrelated practices of commerce in the viceroyalties of New Spain, New Granada, and Peru and (2) how they relied on the posts, which were already the target of Bourbon reformers. This culture of creative accounting, winks and nods, and outright fraud contributed to the formation of elites in Lima, Santiago de Guatemala, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires. Rather than attempt to point out all of the economic and social inflections of commerce and fraud, I detail where and why Carrió’s exposé repeatedly returns to this problem, both directly and indirectly, as I bring various critical voices and approaches into a dialogue on the ­issues. Chapter 4 examines the trade in illegal goods and the diversion of precious metals in the second half of the eighteenth century, when Carrió became directly involved in the rolling reforms of the post. I contend that, to a large degree (and one largely unmeasured by scholars), El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes pivots around\n\nHierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America the economic and social pretensions of Buenos Aires and Lima, the former on the rise and the latter in decline. Carrió’s exposé is, among other things, a tale of how Buenos Aires eclipsed Lima by using the same illegal means that merchants in Lima had used centuries earlier to defeat merchants in Seville. An examination of significant continuities between the first and second halves of the eighteenth century provides an alternative to the middle period model. Also examined is the fact that, just as blindness was a moral and intellectual trope in the iconological and literary explorations of Ignorance and Error in France, Italy, England, and Spain, blindness in Carrió’s Guide for Blind Rovers (or Guide for Blind Traders) impinges on different types of travelers—merchants, muleteers, readers of exotic travelogues (armchair travelers), government officials—and what they were packing, so to speak. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 constitute Part III. Chapter 5 argues that the prevailing scholarly approaches to hierarchy in viceregal Spanish America must reverse course: we cannot continue to use modern and postmodern categories and models of hierarchy to analyze viceregal society. Carrió’s cultural geography was not a postmodern one. This means that any examination of texts (in the postmodern sense) that were used to legitimate a social hierarchy—treatises on the circulation of blood, on faculty psychology, paintings of castas, the literature of heraldry, genealogical paintings and histories, poems and dramas about various castas and estados—cannot be analyzed without attending to the principles of that hierarchy and how they were negotiated in particular, or local, situations by the Crown, church, and individuals who lived that hierarchy as a material reality. Local hierarchies in the parts of viceregal Spanish America under examination were constituted from the intersecting principles of casta, estado, and limpieza (de sangre and de oficio). Although all of these hierarchical principles had their own discursive realities, none was materially biological or genetic; none was what would become known in the nineteenth century as race. Because genealogy could legally be (and often was) a discursive reality at odds with material reality, extralegal climbing within the social hierarchy—what the inspector in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes terms passing—was commonplace. Chapter 6 explores how social privileges, responsibilities, and taxonomies are figured in Concolorcorvo’s transformations. It also presents some fictional and historical inspirations for Carrió’s invention of Concolorcorvo, including Don Quijote de la Mancha (Cervantes 1983), which Carrió appropriated in order to give his opinion about several hot-button issues: the origins of the Indians, Crown and church policies of integration and assimilation that developed from the Reconquest period into the late eighteenth century, culture versus biology. Recalling the partly Indian man who accompanied Carrió on part of his inspection tour, ­Calixto Bustamante, this chapter suggests that his legal troubles and shame (infamia) shaped Carrió’s invention of Concolorcorvo as an impostor and a blowhard. That\n\nIntroduction\n\ninfamia was caused partially by his various manifestations of hybridity.4 Finally, the chapter looks at how the debates about the rights and responsibilities of provincial governors are figured in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes. Carrió’s opinions in these controversies placed him squarely in the camp opposed to Bourbon technocrats in Peru, which explains not only the inspector’s cantankerousness but also the legal problems that dogged Carrió after the clandestine publication of his exposé. Chapter 7 analyzes Carrió’s sense of humor and conceptualization of wit. It also explains how the Guatemalan tale functions rhetorically, as a unit within the broader unit that is El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes, and how closely Carrió followed rhetorical authorities (classical and modern) in his construction of the tale and the 4Ps from Lima riddle embedded in it. It suggests links between the Guatemalan tale, medieval tournaments, and mock trials in eighteenth-century Peru and France and then deliberates on the weighty legal and literary question “Is Carrió’s joke merely a friendly insult, or is it instead a piece of defamation?” Finally, the case is made again that Carrió’s exposé is not as baroque as literary historians believe it to be: the Guatemalan anecdote in which the riddle and its solutions are embedded could have been written in Cicero’s times or in Montesquieu’s. Its very presence reminds us that the baroque borrowed as much from antiquity as it bequeathed to the Enlightenment.5 Because most postmodern theorists believe that they are in some form or fashion reacting against the Enlightenment—against the eighteenth-century business of perfectability, against the costs of doing that business borne by cultures and institutions that were not valued within Enlightenment models—it is surprising that Carrió has not been claimed by colonial and postcolonial critique as an aged poster child for Enlightenment dissonance or difference à la Montesquieu. However, most of the criticism of Carrió’s account has de-emphasized the material conditions in which he lived and worked and wrote, choosing to focus instead on race, class, and other postcolonial approximations using structuralist, poststructuralist, and other largely ahistorical tools. To avoid the postcolonial trap, I do not approach Carrió’s report as fictional discourse or historiography in general as invented narrative; my objections to this approach have been aired on other occasions. I also call attention here to the fact that I have elected to speak of viceregal, rather than colonial, Spanish America for the same reason that Anglo-Americanists speak of colonial, rather than viceregal, New England: where a concept or category did not exist, it is not helpful to ­Anglo- or Ibero-Americanists to pretend that it did. The primary goal of this book is to uncover the messages that Carrió’s inspection report conveys about hierarchy, commerce, and fraud in eighteenth-century Spanish America within the geographical limits established earlier. Consequently, beyond the discussion of genre and audience in this Introduction, only Chapters 6 and 7 directly engage with El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes qua literary discourse.\n\nHierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America\n\nCarrió, Double Consciousness, and the Criollo/Peninsular Rivalry The 1768 trial (probatio) that resulted in Carrió’s recognition as an untitled nobleman (hidalgo) yielded the bulk of the information that we have about his immediate family. His father, Justo de Carrió y Lavandera, an hidalgo and permanent alderman in Gijón, Galicia, married Teresa Carreño Argüelles in 1705. They had several children: Fernando, a Benedictine monk; second-born Antonio, a Carmelite monk in New Spain; first-born Cosme, a priest; Justo; José; and Alonso, the fifth child, who was born on July 3, 1715 (Gómez-Tabanera 1984, 230–34). The inspector in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes, Carrió’s textual secret sharer, reveals that the young Spanish merchant left Gijón for New Spain in 1735. At the age of thirty, after spending four or five years trading in New Biscayne, he moved to Mexico City (see Figure 1), where he lived for more than five years (Carrió 1973, 459).6 In an unpublished Manifiesto written in 1777, Carrió stated that he had covered New Spain from Vera Cruz to Chiguagua as a merchant and from Mexico City to Guatemala (then part of New Spain) (see Figure 2) as a traveler (Real Díaz 1956, 4). Attempts to reform the bureaucracy in Mexico were especially intense in the 1740s and 1750s (Arnold 1991, passim); as a merchant and as a traveler, Carrió could not have ignored this fact. The Spanish Crown’s attempts at bureaucratic reform, which aimed to bolster its authority, are in fact a constant of Spanish history, according to Bertrand (1999b). A continuity stretches from the reforms instituted by Ferdinand and Isabella to those enacted by the Bourbon monarchs in the second half of the eighteenth century. The latter witnessed a deepening, or evolution, of the reform measures from the early eighteenth century rather than an overhaul of the administrative apparatus.7 Recognizing this continuity spurs us “to relocate the Bourbon reforms of the second half of the eighteenth century, traditionally baptized as ­enlightened, within a long-term historical perspective” (Bertrand 1999b, 325). This study approaches the Crown’s efforts at reform as inseparable from the processes of identity formation among Spanish residents in the viceroyalties of New Spain, Peru, and later New Granada and the Riverplate. El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes confirms that identity formation was very different from the narrative of it that elite criollos began to write at the end of the eighteenth century, when their monopoly of the high courts and of the production and distribution of goods and services—a monopoly made possible by the alliance of elite criollos with elite and aspiring-to-be-elite peninsulars—was challenged by the Crown. (Their story, which has been masterfully recorded by David Brading [1991] and Anthony Pagden [1992], is not the tale I wish to tell here.) The discourse of disenfranchisement that began at that point, unlike the earlier rebuttals of European attacks on criollos, was the father of the Spanish American Middle Ages narrative that served as a\n\nIntroduction\n\ncorner­stone of nation building for nineteenth-century Spanish American intellectuals and politicians. This refashioning of viceregal history, aided by the refashioning of Spanish history undertaken by their European contemporaries, portrayed viceregal Spanish America as a feudal comedy of errors in which criollos were victimized by European Spaniards.8 That so many Spanish American politicians and magnates were descendants of elite criollos who had pillaged their own lands in tandem with European Spaniards (who were often their wives, husbands, sonsin-law or daughters-in-law) is history. It is often ignored by the Sturm und Drang school of Spanish American identity that I have just sketched. My critique of current scholarly discussions of colonial subjectivity and discourse is therefore linked to my particular understanding of the criollo-peninsular rivalry, which privileges the long-term, microhistorical dimensions of social relationships in eighteenthcentury Spanish America.9 Even in the eighteenth century, the viceroyalties of Peru and New Spain were commonly called empires (Imperio Peruano, Imperio Mexicano), not colonies in the Anglo or French sense, and what Anglo and French scholars call the Spanish Empire was the Monarquía for the individuals who lived within it.10 I do not dispute in this study that attempts were made to turn the Empires of Peru and Mexico into colonies during the late eighteenth century.11 (Indeed, in 1774 the term colony [colonia] was used in the Anglo sense by Pedro Rodríguez Campomanes, Charles III’s minister and a keen student of Adam Smith.) What I question is the unqualified success of those attempts at administrative and economic reform, and I give evidence that those attempts did not significantly alter local and regional structures of power. Again I emphasize that questions of identity in the large chunk of Bourbon Spanish America that is the subject of this study—their practices of inclusion and exclusion and our interpretations of those practices in the postcolonial period—cannot be isolated from economic and bureaucratic matters in the Monarquía. The 1746 trial of wits in Santiago de Guatemala, at which the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima is posed and solved in two different ways, has several identity markers, as well as oblique references to what or who was in need of reform. Before the Spaniard from Guatemala poses the riddle, the inspector sets up the story: Para que Vm. dé fin, señor inca, a un viaje tan pesado, le concluirá Vm. con una burla chistosa que hizo un guatemalteco gachupín, a ciertos chapetones limeños. Para evitar toda equivocación y sentido siniestro, es preciso advertir que fuera de Lima se dicen limeños a todos aquellos que tuvieron alguna residencia en esta capital, ya sean criollos o europeos. En la Nueva España los llaman peruleros, y en la península mantienen este nombre hasta en sus patrias, y así en Madrid, a mi cuñado y a mí y a los demás criollos nos reputaban igualmente por peruleros o limeños. Se hallaban seis u ocho de éstos en Gua-\n\nHierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America temala a tiempo que gobernaban aquel reino los ilustrísimos señores Araujo y Pardo, peruleros, a quienes hacían la corte los chapetones o gachupines, como dicen allende y aquende el mar. (Carrió ���������������� 467–68) [In order to bring such a tiresome journey to a close, Mr. Inca, you shall conclude it with a practical joke that a Guatemalan gachupín played on some ­Liman chapetones. To avoid any ambiguity or sinister interpretations, it is necessary to note that, outside of Lima, all of those who resided for a time in this capital, whether they are criollos or Europeans, are called Limans. In New Spain they call them peruleros, and in the Peninsula they keep this name even in their homelands, and so in Madrid they treated my brother-in-law and me and the other criollos alike as peruleros or Limans. Six or eight of the latter found themselves in Guatemala at a time when the most illustrious lords, Araujo and Pardo, peruleros, were governing that kingdom, to whom the ­gachupines or the chapetones—as they say on this and that side of the Ocean, respectively—were paying court.] What is jarring about this passage is the fact that in the inspector’s declaration Carrió, who left Spain for New Spain when he was a grown man and then moved to Peru when he was about forty, refers to himself as an American Spaniard: “so in Madrid, they treated my brother-in-law and me and the other criollos alike as peruleros or Limans.” As if this “me and the other criollos” were not perplexing enough, given what we know about Carrió and what the inspector tells us in the Spaniard’s exposé, the inspector soon designates the archbishop and the governor of Guatemala, who were born and raised in Lima, as peruleros, a designation that was not restricted to American Spaniards: European-born Spaniards who took up residence in Lima were also called peruleros. None of this, I am convinced, was mere rhetorical slippage on the part of the Spanish author of El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes. The inspector’s multiple sites of enunciation, in fact, represent a multilayered subjectivity. They bring to the surface a positional hybridity, or double consciousness, that is closer to what theorists of colonial situations have assigned to the colonized indigenous person or African or to the colonizing/colonized ­ creole or criollo.12 What I have said of Carrió can be said equally of the Spaniard from Guatemala and of the Spaniards from Peru. Carrió’s Guatemalan tale refers to the former and the latter in language used to deride Spaniards who were not born in America: “El Gachupín Guatemalteco reparó en los muchos elogios que hacian de Lima los Chapetones.” (“The Guatemalan gachupín noted the many praises that the chapetones sang of Lima.”) (Carrió 1775, n.p.). After the Spaniard from Guatemala officially challenges the Peruvian delegation to solve the riddle of the 4Ps from Lima, the spokesman for the delegation replies in part:\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeñores, el Enigma que propuso nuestro Paysano el Gachupín, y el Desafio que hizo, prueban el poco conocimiento que tiene de las cosas que pasan allende el Mar, y que reputa a los Chapetones por unos Hombres que solo pensamos en nuestros particulares Intereses, sin atender a las particularidades del Pays. De todo estamos muy bien impuestos aunque Forasteros. (Carrió 1775, n.p.) [Sires, the Riddle that the Gachupín, our Countryman, posed, and the Challenge that he issued, confirm the little knowledge that he has about things that happen yonder the Sea and that he assumes us Chapetones are a bunch of Men who only look out for our particular Interests, without thinking about the particulars of the Country. Though Outsiders, we are on top of everything.] Here the spokesman for the Peruvian delegation refers to the Spaniard from Guatemala as a gachupín, the term that Spaniards born and raised in the Viceroyalty of New Spain used to designate Spaniards born in Spain. The same man refers to himself and the other members of the Peruvian delegation as chapetones, the term that Spaniards born and raised in the Viceroyalty of Peru applied to Spaniards born in Spain. He addresses the Spaniard from Guatemala as one of his countrymen and as a gachupín, which suggests two different ideas: (1) the Spaniard from Peru and the Spaniard from Guatemala are members of the same community and (2) the person speaking is a criollo, precisely a Spaniard born and raised in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (where the term gachupín was used), whereas the person to whom he is speaking is a Spaniard born and raised in Spain. To further complicate matters, the Spaniard from Peru identifies the Peruvian delegation as chapetones, which again suggests two different ideas: (1) he and the men whom he represents are European Spaniards and (2) the person speaking is a criollo, specifically a Spaniard born and raised in the Viceroyalty of Peru (where the term chapetón was used). Why does Carrió speak, by turns, as a European Spaniard, as an American Spaniard (criollo or español americano), and as a perulero (a Spaniard, European or American, who resides or once resided in Peru)? Why does the spokesman for the peruleros identify himself and his opponent from Guatemala as European Spaniards by employing the slang of first a criollo from New Spain and then a criollo from Peru? The answers to these questions, which have not been posed in the more than 225 years that have passed since the clandestine publication of Carrió’s exposé, are only hinted at in the autobiographical revelations and the inspector’s Guatemalan tale that have led me to pose the questions. We must look past Carrió’s discourse, and beyond the fetishization of the criollo, at the material reality of eighteenth-century Spanish America to find satisfactory answers. For those of us who are interested in issues of identity, Carrió’s perulero con-\n\n10 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America cept throws a spanner in our works: it disrupts the prevailing scholarly distinction between European and American Spaniard, positing an experiential identification (residence in Peru) rather than a geographical and pseudobiological one (birth in Spain or Spanish America). This is no simple matter: a Spaniard from Europe, Carrió nonetheless appears to be the colonized subject, or perhaps the colonizer/ colonized subject, of postmodern cultural studies. However, my point herein is not to postulate a middle category between criollo and peninsular: indeed, I could very easily coerce Bhabha’s concept of hybridity into playing that role, and there would be no need for me to carry the issue forward. Instead, I argue that a peninsular like Carrió, as well as any criollo, could have a double consciousness and that the elite criollos and peninsulars of the Guatemalan tale viewed themselves and functioned, historically and in spite of the double consciousness and ribbing, as one group. I believe this is what both the historical record and Carrió’s exposé tell us. It is also what several Latin American scholars have been telling us for decades. Perulero (or criollo, for that matter) is a discursive reality that can be fully grasped only by examining the material conditions—the historical relationships—in which it arose, conditions obfuscated by the discourse of elite criollos in the late viceregal period and Spanish American politicians in the nineteenth century and beyond. The elite tale of identity in late viceregal Spanish America assumes that criollo (American Spaniard) or europeo (European), like the modern concept of race, was an immanent category. According to this tale, birth in a particular place (i.e., place of origin) determined one’s identity, or framed what colonial and imperial studies scholars commonly call the colonial subject. Critical discussions about colonial subjectivity, including the criollo-peninsular rivalry, need to be reinscribed in material reality, I am persuaded, and this can be expedited by focusing on the microhistorical dimensions of social relationships, especially economic relationships. Microhistorical approaches to such relationships analyze social networks—organized relations between family, friends, and colleagues. They take us beyond the shared interests of professional groups (e.g., archbishops, judges, merchants, governors), geographic groupings (e.g., Europeans, Mexicans, Limans, Spaniards), and affective and ostensibly antagonistic communities (peninsulares and criollos), and they help us to understand the failure of Bourbon reforms in general and the ideological impetus of El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes in particular. As Bertrand explains in his study of the social networks of royal treasury officials in eighteenth-century New Spain: This framing in terms of social networks can therefore contribute to a re-framing of the issue of the Bourbon reforms, the transformation of the colonial state and its impact on the affirmation of protonational aspirations among the criollo elite. One can surmise that the reforms did not mean a whole lot as long as the values of the actors charged with applying them persisted without\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nradically changing. From this point of view, the passage from the Old Regime to modernity must be analyzed more from the point of social practice than from the norm imposed from above. (1999a, 49–50)13 Since the sixteenth century, elite criollos and peninsulares organized themselves through patterns of marriage and inheritance in order to defend their family and economic interests. Rejecting the notion that criollo-peninsular relations in eighteenth-century New Spain were antagonistic, Gloria Artís has reconstructed the genealogy of Mexico City’s elite families to understand how the old criollo aristocracy retained its economic and political dominance. It did so, in part, by incorporating peninsular merchants who had accumulated fortunes in New Spain. Thus, a dozen or so families enjoyed an increasing concentration of power and wealth.14 “In view of that, the vision of the oligarchy as a single group eliminates the distinction between criollos and peninsulars. Both formed part of the oligarchy and they were integrated into a single social organization sharing economic and family interests” (1994, 21). Bertrand makes a similar case against the “elitist and criollista” marriage model identified in previous studies of criollo elites: “Strong geographical endogamy, translated for the Spanish-American elite in terms of the criollo-peninsular dichotomy, cannot be verified for these [royal treasury] officials: 75% of the marriages reconstructed for a group of some three-hundred individuals do not obey this rule as they take place between a peninsular—the royal official—and a criollo woman.” When subjected to a rigorous examination by historians and anthropologists who do not ignore the microhistorical dimension of identity in viceregal Spanish America, the vaunted criollo-peninsular rivalry breaks down on both sides. When Bertrand tells us that 75% of the officials from Spain married women born in Spanish America, he also tells us that criollo elites were ready, willing, and able to marry their daughters to treasury officials who were from Spain. What is even more striking is that, according to Bertrand’s research, criollo elites were even willing to “marry down” their daughters to peninsulars: “The same thing occurs with social homogamy, or the tendency to fall back on one’s own social group, which translates into a difficulty with integrating newcomers in view of defending ‘honour’ and ‘blood.’ This behavior, frequently ascribed to the colonial elite, cannot be totally confirmed in the case of royal officials’ marriages, since 30%, or a very strong minority, of their marriages are forged with [criollo] families of much greater social prestige than their own” (1999a, 47). Bertrand’s research is replete with examples of marriage choices that link criollo elites in Mexico with elites in Madrid, Lima, and so forth. Social homogamy and geographic endogamy, he argues, yielded to familial endogamy (1999b, 224). The selling of offices and of licenses to marry a woman native to one’s jursidiction was Crown policy, and it enabled social networks to form and sustain themselves. In the face of overwhelming evidence presented by scholars of social networks\n\n12 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America in New Spain, it is high time that we discard the “elitist and criollista” marriage model, as well as the Romantic tales of criollo and peninsular hatreds. Yet to fully grasp that Carrió’s exposé is a tale of such networks throughout Spanish America, it is necessary to establish that elites in Peru, notwithstanding the economic and literary rivalries between Lima and Mexico City, were not unlike those in New Spain. This spadework has, in fact, already been done: Artís’s and Bertrand’s findings for New Spain are matched by Guillermo Lohmann Villena’s findings for Peru. According to his research, a handful of families dominated the religious and political posts of the Viceroyalty of Peru until the last quarter of the eighteenth century.15 Between the years 1700 and 1775, criollos were not underrepresented at the high court in Lima. In numerical terms, they held 46 percent of the posts. Natives of Lima alone occupied 33 percent of the judgeships; natives of Chile, 7.5 percent; and natives of New Granada, 2.5 percent. No less significant are his marriage statistics, which imply that elite marriage patterns in Peru were similar to those in eighteenth-century New Spain. A full 48 percent of the Lima-born judges married women from Lima, as did 4 percent of the judges from other parts of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Only half of the traditional model for elite criollo marriage (elite criollos marry their equals) can be confirmed here (criollos marry criollas), because Lohmann Villena did not specify the ancestry or wealth of the criollas, or criollo wives. Yet his analysis of the marriage choices made by peninsular judges on the high court in Lima calls into question even that half, because only 21 percent of them married women from Spain. A hefty 79 percent percent of them married criollas: 10 percent married criollas from outside Peru, 39 percent married women from Lima, and the remaining 30% found wives in Peruvian cities other than Lima.16 As Socolow has observed: To govern America the Spanish Crown had always strived, in theory if not in practice, to create a disinterested bureaucracy, a corps of civil servants unencumbered by personal and familial ties to local groups. . . . One of the ways envisaged . . . was to prohibit marriage with local women. As a result, Hapsburg legislation decreed that no Audiencia oidor, nor any of his children, could marry a native of the same Audiencia district. Indeed, a magistrate could only marry a criolla from another area after special royal permission had been secured. Regardless of legislation, in the Audiencias of Mexico, Lima, Santiago de Chile, and Santa Fe de Bogotá, criollos and Spaniards married to local women came to dominate the halls of justice and the fiscal administration of the colony. (1987, 193) Perhaps no one captured the concept of marriage as a mechanism of the criollopeninsular oligarchy in eighteenth-century Lima better than Antonio de Ulloa\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nand Jorge Juan, who stated that their observations about elite criollo-peninsular marriages in Lima were generally true for all of Spanish America: Among distinguished families, in particular, the same thing occurs in Lima as in Quito, and it is a general rule in all of the Indies that some families have been established there for years and others have settled there recently. Because Lima is the seat of all the commerce in Peru, many more Europeans flock there than to any other city, be it for this reason or because of the government and magistrate posts to which they are appointed when in Spain. For both types the most noble individuals are chosen, and although many return to their hometowns after they have completed their appointments, normally most of them stay on, and charmed by the abundance and the good climate, get married to ladies of nobility who, beyond their dowry of material assets, tend to have one of natural assets, and so this is how new families are continually established. (1748, 3:70) It was not supposed to be this way, of course. Lawyers for the Spanish Crown had been aware of potential problems, but royal dispensations (often purchased along with posts in Spain) thwarted the rationale of the laws that walled off the halls of justice and the vaults of the royal treasury from the loyalties of family. In the Viceroyalty of New Granada, too, European Spaniards paired off with elite criollas. As Ulloa and Juan reported, the former were merchants and the latter were offspring of the landed gentry, whose ancestors had come to Cartagena from Spain as government officials: The white homeowners that live in Cartagena can be divided into two types: the Europeans and the criollos, or natives of the country. The former, whom they call chapetones, are not many in number because they either return to Spain after they have made a respectable fortune or move to the interior provinces to better their fortune. . . . The families of criollos are the ones who own the land and farms, and among these are some of great nobility because their ancestors [in Spain] moved to those places with government appointments and their families, settled down there, and [the descendants] have tried to maintain the lustre of their ancestors by marrying either their criollo equals or Europeans who arrive in the armadas. (1748, 1: 40) A native of Madrid, Dionisio de Alcedo y Herrera (1690–1777) was appointed provincial governor of Canta, Peru, in 1721 and was designated governor and president of the high court in Quito in 1728 (González Palencia in Alcedo y Herrera 1915, v–xi.). In his Plano geográfico e hidrográfico del Distrito de la Real Audiencia de Quito (Geographic and Hydrographic Map of the District of the High Court in\n\n14 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America Quito), originally published in 1766, he wrote about “European Spaniards who leave these kingdoms [of Spain], appointed to positions, and the accompanying entourage that serve them, and [that in the Kingdom of Quito] they call both of these groups chapetones” (60). He went on to describe the situation of the two groups of peninsulars after their arrival in the kingdom: And upon arriving there, it is hard to find a man who continues in service because the latter is generally reserved for black, mulatto and sambo slaves, and others commonly devote themselves to trade, in which many tend to make a fortune, and the noble ones with families or without them marry into the families of the other patrician Spaniards who are called criollos, descendants of the conquerors and holders of encomiendas, and of others who have gone there with the same charge. . . . Thus the successions grow, the treasures, lands and farms increase and are distributed and shared, and their owners confine themselves to the comfort and utility of their commodities to maintain their houses and families with abundance, regalement and the utmost propriety, leading restful and quiet lives. (60–61) The Habsburgs had fought and lost the battle against the formation of c­ riollo-peninsular oligarchies in Spanish America. The Bourbons, for their part, were hamstrung by financial pressures and political goals during the first half of the eighteenth century and could scarcely fight the battle. During the heyday of sales, Spaniards purchased their judgeship and marriage dispensation together before they left for the New World.17 (This was also true of criollos, as we shall see.) Socolow has correctly signaled the purpose of some of the vaunted reforms attempted by the Spanish Bourbons. “The Bourbon reforms,” she writes, “especially the policies of the third Bourbon king, Charles III, signaled a reaction against this growth of local influence; one of the cardinal objectives of Charles’s program was to reconquer America from the hands of the creoles” (1987, 193). But despite the royal order of 1779 that reinforced the marriage prohibitions and added royal finance officials to the list, social practice undermined the stated intent of that and subsequent legislation. “The Spanish crown,” Socolow notes, “showed itself only two [sic] willing to disregard its own policies, granting permission to all those who petitioned the crown” (194). As an engineer from Spain who resided in Paraguay in the 1780s bragged, “The chapetones are practically owners of the daughters, farms and wills of the criollos upon becoming their relatives” (qtd. in Rípodas Ardanaz, 1977, 36). From New Spain to Peru, historical evidence does not support prevailing approaches to identity and subjectivity in viceregal Spanish America, which merely extend the Manichean identity tale spun by criollo elites in the late eighteenth century and by their successors in the independence period. The uneven, oscillating subjectivity of Carrió and the spokesperson for the Peruvian delegation refracts material reality; it is illuminated by, and it obliquely\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nconfirms, the historical evidence concerning elite marriages, inheritance patterns, and the levels of criollo and peninsular participation in the high court, royal treasury, and other hubs of viceregal power. A historical, or material, analysis of both yields a conclusion that escapes theories of colonial and postcolonial discourses as they are presently constituted: the object within one hierarchy is, simultaneously, the subject within another, and so it mattered little if Spaniards in Spain devalued a criollo in Mexico City who controlled, say, wheat production. Within the hierarchy of Spain and its dominions (i.e., the Monarquía) that was constructed by residents of Castile, the criollo and “criollized” elites in Peru—the cream of the ­ perulero crop—could be envied or rewarded, disparaged or admired as fellow members of the Nación. At the very same time, the local cultures of viceregal Spanish America had their own hierarchies articulated and coiffed by the very same criollo-peninsular roscas, simultaneously articulator and articulated, subjects and objects of hierarchy. Unlike revolutionary Spanish America, viceregal Spanish America is a tale of local resentments and struggles that were not waged primarily against a Crown that the lower orders did not know: they were waged against its representatives who, more often than not, were either locals or European Spaniards who were tied to locals by blood, marriage, or occupation. Local resentments are irreducible to the vertical concerns of local elites, for the resentments of plebeians are unassimilable to those concerns. Thus, the alleged criollo-peninsular rivalry had nothing at all material to do with indigenous rebellions, plebeian food riots, and the like, although discursively the criollo-peninsular opposition could be deployed in hopes of deflecting the lower order’s resistance to the oligarchical practices of the local elites.18 The inspector’s Guatemalan tale is an exemplum, a type of allegory by which Carrió captured social networks that were thwarting reform in Bourbon Spanish America.\n\nMultiple Audiences, Multiple Genres As José J. Real Díaz points out, Carrió sent a number of technical reports, itineraries, postal guides, updates, and summaries of his reforms to the viceroy of Peru and to postal administrators in Madrid between 1771 and 1774. Unlike his prior writings, El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes provides information of a nontechnical nature (1956, 20). His varied aims corresponded to different segments of his readership. On one hand, Carrió’s account is directed to material caminantes: persons who traveled throughout Peru for professional reasons—to sell mules, to trade goods, to get to their Crown or church posts, and so on. The very term caminante implied both travel and trade,19 and business travelers, no matter what their profession, needed to know about the posts and postal routes and about the different locales and their inhabitants. On the other hand, it is directed to armchair travelers, especially the supposedly enlightened literati and ministers in Europe who had\n\n16 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America never been to the New World.20 The majority of the first group in Carrió’s times valued experience; the majority of the second valued theory. The first group he often worked with; the second group he often worked for. Just as Carrió’s eighteenth-century readership was a motley assortment of potential interlocutors, so his discourse is a mixture of the popular and the highbrow.21 Yet it would be a mistake to associate the popular with the first audience, the highbrow with the second. The wit—insinuation, caricature, jest, riddle, tale—that is meant to entertain the material caminantes often operates at the expense of the second audience, because influential authors and officials during the first century of Spanish Bourbon rule in the main disparaged the culture (including humor) of previous generations of Spanish courtiers and tastemakers. Like the Benedictine Benito Jerónimo Feijoo y Montenegro, the internationally renowned cultural critic of the Spanish Enlightenment, many of these armchair travelers ­belonged to the mob (el vulgo) for Carrió, in spite of their education, personal libraries, and positions of influence. It was Baltasar de Gracián, not Feijoo y Montenegro, whom Carrió trusted; it is the theatrum mundi of El criticón (The Faultfinder), not the rationalist theater of Teatro crítico (Critical Theater), through which the inspector and Concolorcorvo move. In the second part of Gracián’s El criticón, Critilo and his naïve disciple Andrenio enter the “Plebs’ Square and Mob’s Theater.” The mob from various countries are huddled together, “speaking, but not reasoning” about politics, religion, and reform. Among the “shuffled fools,” Andrenio is astonished to see so many noblemen: “I never thought I would see,” pondered Andrenio, “so many wise fools in one place, and yet here I see them of every estate and type, even lay-brothers.” “Why, of course,” the wise man said, “for the mob can be found everywhere, and no matter how distinguished a community is, there are ignoramuses in it who have something to say about everything and take it upon themselves to pass judgment on things, without a bit of sense. . . . Do you think that a man is wise just because he is carried on a litter, or that he is well informed because he is well dressed? There are some who are just as base [vulgares] and ignorant as their footmen. And note that even if he is a prince, when he does not know certain things, but decides to take it upon himself to talk about them—to give his opinion about things he does not know or understand—right then and there he declares himself a base and plebeian man [un hombre vulgar y plebeyo]; because the mob is nothing more than a synagogue of presumptuous ignoramuses, and the less they understand things, the more they talk about them.” (1967, 730–31) Critical issues of genre and audience are inseparable from the instability of signifiers in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes. There is a high dose of what I call\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nsemantic variegation in Carrió’s exposé: his use of words such as bisoño (“rookie” or “naïf ”), caminante (“journeyman,” “traveler,” or “trader”), vulgo (“the mob,” “commoners,” or “ignorant people”), and ciego (“blindman,” “naïf,” or “scamp”) make translation into English a slippery art. Therefore, this study provides an English translation and the Spanish original when Carrió’s exposé is quoted. It is even more important to note that this semantic variegation allowed Carrió to speak to different audiences at the same time, delivering a different message to each, which was absolutely essential to his negotiation of the Bourbon cultural paradigm imposed by the men who hired him. A clear example of semantic variegation is sátira (satire). When Carrió caught wind of claims by some Limans that parts of El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes were libelous or defamatory (one of the meanings of sátira), he wrote to the head of the post in Madrid in defense of his work: “Yo estoy cierto de la ingenuidad, claridad y veracidad con que la escribí, hasta ocultar el nombre de los sujetos que agraviaron a las Rentas de Correos, por lo que suplico a V. V. S. S. que si fuera cierta esta noticia mande se señalen los puntos que contienen sátira para satisfacer puntualmente” (qtd. in Carilla 1976, 35–36) (“I am certain of the ingenuousness, clarity and veracity with which I wrote it, even shielding the names of the individuals who assaulted the Revenues of the Postal Service; I thereby beg Your Lords to order, were this information correct, that the points that contain libel be identified so I can give an exact response”). It is clear that Carrió distinguished between libelous satire, which some officials had accused him of having written, and a narration that folded in jocose bits (jocosidades, as he called them) in the spirit of Menippean satire. A great many people still enjoyed these jests in Carrió’s times, but the literati and ministers who supported the Crown’s attempts to remake Spain, and whom the Bourbon monarchs protected for this purpose, did not share Carrió’s sense of humor. What he viewed as urbane witticisms, or friendly insults rooted in truth and exchanged among respectable people, they viewed as sins and insults that rose to the level of sátira in the legal sense—defamation. Numerous critical attempts to categorize Carrió’s narration have been made.22 Many scholars have viewed El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes as a picaresque novel (Gómez-Tabanera 1984, 228). It is often inscribed within the carnivalesque, but the halfhearted deployment of this analytical concept has, paradoxically, underweighted the subversive freight of Carrió’s exposé. A privileging of form over content has unwittingly defused the text’s explosive charge: the material reality that prompted Carrió’s mockery has been displaced by what could properly be called a “descent into discourse.”23 Several scholars specifically site El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes within the Menippean tradition,24 and the deformations of material reality and the parody of various genres in Carrió’s work support this critical approach.25 The inspector’s secretary, Don Calixto Bustamante Carlos Inca, also known as Concolorcorvo, represents a significant transformation of material reality.26 In actuality, Calixto Bustamante was Carrió’s assistant for ten months, but he\n\n18 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America did not accompany Carrió beyond Potosí and he did not write the inspector’s report as the title page claims (Carilla 1976, 63–66). Furthermore, Carrió’s parody of several genres leaves no doubt that his exposé continues the carnivalesque and often corrosive Menippean tradition. The latter was full of the witticisms that Spaniards had practiced for centuries, and the most famous work of Spanish literature glorified the Menippean tradition and weighed heavily on Carrió. Although the collation of Don Quijote de la Mancha and El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes has often yielded parallels stripped of their ideological dimensions, the similarities between these works reveal a good deal about Carrió’s aims. From my point of view, a truly significant sharing is to be found in Carrió’s ideological motivations for writing and clandestinely publishing his account. After Don Quijote dies, the alleged author Cide Hamete Benengeli hangs up his quill (pluma). The last words of the novel are ones that he speaks to his quill: “for my desire has been none other than to make men hate the fake and nonsensical tales in the books of chivalry, which because of the tales of my true Don Quijote are now merely stumbling along, and will soon collapse altogether, without a doubt. Vale” (1983, 2:609). The alleged author of El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes, Concolorcorvo, ends his prologue after a sententia from Tacitus, saying, “con la que doy fin, poniendo el dedo en la boca, la pluma en el tintero y el tintero en un rincón de mi cuarto, hasta que se ofrezca otro viaje, si antes no doy a mis lectores el último. Vale” (121) (“with which I come to an end, putting my finger on my mouth, the featherpen in the inkwell, and the inkwell in a corner of my room, until another journey presents itself, if I do not rather give my readers their last one. Vale”). Both alleged authors express the desire of the actual authors of the narrations to extinguish certain genres of literature: Cide Hamete intends to debunk chivalric romances; Concolorcorvo intends to debunk geographical and historiographical romances.27 Scholars have been quick to classify Carrió’s account as a travelogue (libro de viajes)28 or to view facts in Carrió’s exposé as mere digressions (Pupo-Walker 1982). These critical positions both stem from a lack of clarity about the responsibilities of the inspector of the posts and his options. True, both Don Quijote and El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes involve travel and travelers—just as The Odyssey, The Adventures of Spiderman, Invisible Cities, and countless other works of literature have. Yet the veiled explosive charge of Carrió’s exposé, as I unveil it in subsequent chapters of this study, provides us with a more likely motive for his parody of travelogues and Don Quijote de la Mancha. It is undeniable that Menippean satire, in which travel motivates the narration and provides the protagonists with their privileged, most often otherworldy, access to the objects of the narration’s disdain and ridicule had a purchase on Carrió.29 At the very same time, we should not forget that travel was a material motive for Carrió: he had been commissioned to inspect and reform the posts and to write up a report. Many of his supposed digressions, I assert, were motivated by the different segments of his readership. Note the generous title that he gave to his narration: EL LAZARILLO DE\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nCIEGOS CAMINANTES desde Buenos-Ayres hasta Lima con sus Itinerarios segun la mas puntual observacion, con algunas noticias utiles a los Nuevos Comerciantes que tratan en Mulas; y otras Historicas. SACADO DE LAS MEMORIAS QUE hizo Don Alonso Carrió de la Vandera en este dilatado Viage y Comision que tubo por la Corte para el arreglo de Correos y Estafetas, Situacion y ajuste de Postas, desde Montevideo (Guide for Blind Travelers/Traders from Buenos Aires to Lima [Complete] with Itineraries/Routes Based on the Most Precise Observation and Some Useful Information for New Merchants Dealing in Mules and Other Historiographic Information. Excerpted from the Memoirs Prepared by Don Alonso Carrió de Lavandera during the Lengthy Journey and Commission That He Had Been Given by the Court [in Lima] for the Improvement of Delivery of Letters and Parcels, Location and Relocation of the Posts from Montevideo [to Lima]). A title such as this compels us to distinguish between rhetorical, or literary, features of Carrió’s account and the subject matter of his account, which was practical and historiographical/geographical (geography belonged to historiography in Carrió’s times), in part.30 He does, indeed, include plenty of material that today appears dry, but to the contemporary traveler, trader, or minister in the New World, that very same material was timely and practical. A brief look at two eighteenth-century works, one in manuscript and the other published, will bear this out. The manuscript by an unknown writer bears the following desert-like title: Itineraries and Courses in the Provinces of [the Viceroyalty of] Peru Declaring the Leagues and Stopovers Commonly Taken from Buenos Aires to Lima, from Lima to Potosí, to Potosí from Paita, from La Plata to the Cities in [the Kingdoms of] Buenos Aires and Chile, from Lima to Arequipa, and the Route That Mules Follow from Tucumán to the Inspection and Auction Houses in [the Kingdom of] Peru, and in Which the Distances from One Principal City or Village to Another Are Also Noted, Along with Some Useful Advisories for Those Who Might Have to Travel through Said Provinces.31 This work is basically a skin-and-bones sketch of what we today call Spanish-speaking South America, in which the author aims to help future travelers to the Viceroyalty of Peru prepare for their trip. Like Carrió’s account, it includes basic information about distances between towns and stopovers or post offices (mansiones) from Buenos Aires to Lima, the routes taken by mule traders from Tucumán to the auction sites in the Kingdom of Peru, and so forth. Carrió’s own “itinerario histórico” (“historiographical/geographical itinerary”), with his “advertencias” (“advisories”) designed to ensure that mail was properly sent and delivered (433), could have adopted the same format. Alcedo y Herrera’s Plano geográfico e hidrográfico was a comprehensive geographical report accompanied by a Demostración, or detailed map. The arrangement of his report corresponded to the routes (carreras) or roads (caminos) that led to San Francisco de Quito as shown in the Demostración: “For the communication, trade and commercial correspondences of such a vast and stretching province with the others in South America, and even with Middle America by the South\n\n20 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America Sea and ports that they commonly call on the other coast [de la otra costa], there are three routes or roads that lead to the capital city” (1915, 8). The first road led from Cartagena de Indias, under the jursidiction of the high court in the New Kingdom of Granada, to Quito. The second stretched from Piura, in the jurisdiction of the high court in Lima, to Quito. The third and final road connected Guayaquil, in the province of Quito, to the capital city, San Francisco de Quito (4). Two (Cartagena-Quito and Quito-Piura) of these three highways (carreras) were postal routes (los Correos) that linked the two high courts and viceroyalties of New Granada and Peru (8–11). A fourth highway was the third postal road that linked Lima, in the Viceroyalty of Peru, to Santiago in Chile, and Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the Riverplate (“carrera del tercer Correo del gobierno de aquel virreinato que llaman de la costa”) (59). Like many geographical reports written in this period, Alcedo y Herrera’s reads more like an encyclopedia volume today: from mines to rivers, customs duties, volcanoes, distances, exports and governors, it covers all the bases (Hill 1996a). Yet Alcedo y Herrera elected to guide his readers through the area described by referring to postal routes and postal carriers, because the post was so very central to communications and commerce in viceregal Spanish America. Like the two aforementioned works, Carrió’s exposé involves travel, but not exploration or exotic travel. Certain historical distinctions among types of travel and travelers should be recalled here. In eighteenth-century Peru, business travel was the bulk of travel (again, caminantes meant traders, not just rovers); leisure travel basically consisted of trips to the country, or promenades.32 Adventure trips to Peru were popular among Europeans who could afford them, and such adventure travel produced a substantial number of travelogues from which I quote throughout this book. Just as many drivers today use rest areas to refuel and get a bite to eat, business travelers in eighteenth-century Spanish America visited the offices of the post in sparsely populated areas to exchange mules or horses and to purchase supplies for the rest of their trip, and they often followed the postmen’s routes. In the main, El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes is historiographical (which included the geographical), and the manner in which Carrió presents his materials should not mislead us. Works that belonged to the catchall genre of the almanac and contained astronomical explanations, geographical descriptions, predictions about weather, harvests and political events, riddles, and even jokes left a deep imprint on his exposé. As left field as these works appear today, they bear on the title of Carrió’s exposé and on his shuffling of genres, registers, and audiences in it. Cosme Bueno, a Spanish resident of Lima whom Carrió admired, published his almanacs with the title Lazarillo de los ciegos (Blindmen’s Guide) (Stolley 1994, 249). Yet he did not invent this classification. Numerous almanacs published in Spain bear this or a similar title. Many were authored by the Spanish moralist, satirist, and college ��������� professor Diego de Torres Villarroel, including Los ciegos de Madrid. Almanak, pronóstico y diario de quartos de luna para el año bisiesto de 1732. Juizio �������������������� de los suces-\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nsos elementares y políticos de la Europa (The Blindmen of Madrid. Almanac, Forecast and Diary of Moon Quarters for the Leap Year of 1732. Judgment of the Elemental and Political Events in Europe) (Aguilar Piñal 1978, 61). Some almanacs promised to be guides to naïve, or “blind,” mortals in Madrid, as in the following title: Gran Piscator nuevo. �������������������������������������������������������������� Pronóstico para 1735. El lazarillo de los ciegos de esta Corte (The New ��������������������������������������������������� for 1735. Guide for Blindmen in This Court) (64). Another, Great Piscator. Forecast titled El segundo Lazarillo y Piscator de aventura en una escuela de niños. Pronóstico para 1737 (The Second Guide and Piscator of Adventure at a Children’s School. Forecast for 1737), played off the same suggestion (67). Like the seers of old, many astrologers of the eighteenth century were blindmen (or they represented themselves as blindmen), and many blindmen represented themselves as astrologers. Hence the title of one almanac directed at residents of Burgos: El ciego astrólogo. Nuevo Piscator burgense para 1751 (The Blind Astrologer. New Piscator from Burgos for 1751) (88). Still another almanac, published in Madrid in 1759, suggested that a council of blind seers had issued predictions about the weather, courts, and political events Pronóstico diario de quartos de luna, con los sucessos elementain Europe: Los ciegos. ���������������������������������������������������������������� ��������������� Diary les, áulicos y políticos de la Europa para el año de 1760 (The Blindmen. Forecast of Moon Quarters, with the Elemental, Royal and Political Events in Europe for the Year 1760) (104). Moreover, almanacs were not an exclusively Spanish affliction. There was a plethora of English guides, or “almanacs-plus,” published in Carrió’s lifetime— many of which included information that we find in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes—including The English Chapman’s and Traveller’s Almanack for the Year of Christ, 1711, Wherein All the Post-Roads, . . . the Marts, Fairs and Markets in England and Wales Are Alphabetically Disposed in Every Month (1711). Other examples are the twenty-first (1766) and twenty-second (1772) editions of Vade mecum, or The Necessary Pocket Companion, which contained Samuel Moreland’s Perpetual Almanack, as well as tables explaining how to cast Portuguese gold; the postal rates for letters; the story of the penny post; the principal roads in England; the rates charged by coachmen, carmen (men who loaded and unloaded goods for sale), and watermen; and so forth. The tenth edition (1765) of A Complete Guide to All Persons Who Have Any Trade or Concern with the City of London and Parts Adjacent . . . Designed for the Use of Persons of All Degrees, as Well Natives as Foreigners provided the names of streets, squares, churches, meetinghouses, companies, merchants, and trading houses. It also surveyed the rates and schedules of coaches; the rates of carmen, watermen, porters, and coachmen; and the rates, schedules, locations, and destinations of the general post and the penny post. It even provided charts to determine interest payments and the value of commodities, as well as maps of the Royal Exchange and the city of London. In my view, Carrió was very much a man of his times, and his exposé straddles different genres and registers with the same ease that authors of almanacs straddled them. Two works attributed to Daniel Defoe deserve separate mention here, both\n\n22 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America because they were very popular and because they bear striking resemblances to El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes. The first is called The Compleat Tradesman, or The Exact Dealers Daily Companion. Instructing Him Thoroughly in all things absolutely Necessary to be known by all those who would thrive in the World; and in the whole ART and MYSTERY of TRADE and TRAFFIC; and will be of constant use for all ­MERCHANTS, WHOLE-SALE-MEN, SHOP-KEEPERS, RETAILERS, YOUNG TRADESMEN, COUNTREY-CHAPMEN, INDUSTRIOUS YEO­MEN, TRADERS in Petty Villages, and all FARMERS, AND Others that go to Countrey FAIRS and MARKETS; and for all Men whatsoever, that be of any TRADE, or have any considerable Dealings in the WORLD. Chapter 35 gives the principal cities and towns in England and Wales and their distances from one another. Chapter 46 is called “Of the Post-Office” (Merchant 1684a, 161–62), and it discusses how letters are sent by post and on which days and to where, how men can go on horseback using post horses, and even how men and women “of better rank” can travel from London to nearby villages by stagecoaches called Flying Coaches for a small fee and how they can travel very quickly with the post (162). Chapter 47 is titled “The several rates that now are, and have been taken for the Carriage of Letters, Pacquets and Parcels, to or from any of His Majesties Dominions, to or from any other Parts or Places beyond the Seas . . .” (163–66). Chapter 48 is titled “The Rates and Orders of Coach-men” (166–68), and Chapter 49, “The Rates for Car-men” (168–71). Chapter 50, titled “Orders for Car-Men” (171–72), deals with the men who pack and unpack merchant carts. Chapter 52 is “A Table of Kings” (175), and Chapter 53 is titled “The Fairs in England” (176–80). The author provided a great deal of practical information of the same sort that is found in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes, but he also incorporated proverbs, poetry, and quotes in Latin borrowed from “the Satyrist” in The Compleat Tradesman. A work such as this held undeniable appeal for a seasoned merchant and traveler like Carrió, and if a popular foreign guide for traders mixed the mundane and the moronic, why could he not do the same in an account whose target audience included “tradesmen”? Remember, caminantes did not mean only “rovers”; the semantic field of this word also included traders, journeymen, and others involved in commerce. Moreover, the edition of The Compleat Tradesman that I consulted was published at The Black Raven, and Carrió’s exposé attributes authorship to Secretary Concolorcorvo (“Crow-with-Color”). The sequel to this guide is The Pleasant Art of Money-Catching, Newly and Fully Discovered. The last (and unnumbered) chapter is “A full account of the Penny-Post” (Merchant 1684b, 139–42), but several of the unnumbered chapters that precede it are cautionary tales, anecdotes, and satirical rebukes of con artists, adventurers, and bums. One is titled “How to Travail all England over Without a Farthing of Money, with an Account of those that have tried the Experiment” (71– 75). In this chapter the author discusses a shyster called the False-galloper, who tells rich farmers that he has been robbed and needs to borrow money to continue his travels. This impostor can travel throughout England on someone else’s dime:\n\nIntroduction 23\n\n“And thus with the Feathers of other Birds is this Monster stuck, making wings of sundry fashions, with which he thus basely flies over a whole Kingdom” (73). Another sort of impostor scams innkeepers: “There is a Twin-brother to this Falsegalloper, and he cheats Inn-keepers only, or their Tapsters, by . . . bringing counterfeit Letters of commendations” (73). Almanacs and guides for foreign tourists and business travelers can be seen as literature on travel, but they are not the same as travelogues, or libros de viaje: they advise for future travel (leisure or business) rather than narrate an explorer’s past travels. El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes was closer in purpose to those pocketbook almanacs, travel guides, and trade guides, although its witticisms most often target historical persons and events rather than social types or prototypes like Defoe’s False-galloper. In sum, a significant influence on Carrió was exercised by works that today are found in a bookstore’s travel section. Still, I contend that Carrió did not intend to write a travelogue: this was only one of many literary genres parodied by Carrió; to read his exposé as a travelogue would be like reading Don Quijote de la Mancha as a straight-up chivalric romance. Wit was upheld by the courtiers of the late medieval, renaissance, and baroque periods, but it was also appreciated well into the eighteenth century by anyone who could read. Getting the jokes in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes requires a certain diachronic flexibility in addition to a synchronic analysis of the material conditions in which Carrió lived, worked, and wrote. Central to Carrió’s report on the posts is the scathing riddle of the 4Ps from Lima, and it is difficult to ignore the influence of collections of jokes, scams, riddles, and laconics on Carrió’s exposé. Many jest books, which one Hispanist has qualified as the least critically defined subgenre of European fool’s literature, date from the sixteenth century (Márquez Villanueva 1979, 234–35). During the Spanish renaissance, several jest books, or collections of wit, brought together riddles, tales (casos), witty sayings, and retorts. Numerous editions of Floresta española (Spanish Anthology) by Melchor de Santa Cruz (originally published in 1574) were published well into the eighteenth century (1702, 1728, 1751, 1769, 1777, 1787, 1790) (Santa Cruz 1997, lvii–lviii). I refer several times in this book to Miscelánea o varia historia (Miscellaneous or Various Tales) (written in 1589) by Luis Zapata de Chaves (1999) and Las seiscientas apotegmas y otras obras en verso (Six-Hundred Apothegms and Other Works in Verse) (written in 1596) by Juan Rufo (1972). Unflattering tales of postmen were included in these collections.33 Rufo’s apothegms appeared in a 1718 Portuguese collection by Pedro José Supico de Moraes and more than fifty times in the 1730 Segunda parte de la Floresta española (Spanish Anthology Part Two) by Francisco Asensio (Rufo 1972, xxv–xlv). In the eighteenth century, original compilations other than Asensio’s Floresta española continued the jest book tradition. Bernardino Fernández de Velasco y Pimentel’s Deleite de la discreción y fácil escuela de la agudeza (The Delight of Wit and Easy School of Acuity) was published several times (1743, 1749,\n\n24 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America 1764, 1770). Tertulia de la aldea (Village Chat), a periodical collection of short stories, was published between 1775 and 1777 (and perhaps as early as 1768). Both of these texts contained riddles built from glyphs or initials (Fernández Insuela 1990, 850–53). The title of Carrió’s exposé and his claim of offering travelers a bit of relief and advice together recall in spirit two collections of wit by Joan Timoneda: Buen aviso y Portacuentos (Fair Warning and Story Carrier) (1564) and El Sobremesa y alivio de caminantes (Afterdinner Book and Travelers’/Traders’ Relief) (1563). His short stories are classified as either cuentos or dichos, following Juan de Boscán’s terminology in the Spanish version of Baldassare Castiglione’s masterpiece, Los cuatro libros de El cortesano (The Courier) (1994; originally published in 1534). Some had erudite sources: apothegms derived from Erasmus, and witty tales taken from Italian collections, whereas others were traditional, or rooted in lore. The majority of Timoneda’s stories are jocose, although some sententious tales appear as well (Timoneda 1990, 8–19). Timoneda’s El sobremesa y alivio de caminantes, read by many, echoed in Quevedo’s poetry and in a later (1728) edition of Santa Cruz’s Floresta española (21–24). He was not, however, the only author of a jest book to cross over, so to speak, from a seriocomic genre to a decidedly serious one. In Gracián’s Arte de ingenio, Tratado de la agudeza (Art of Wit, Treatise on Acuity), for example, he referred to Rufo more than thirty times, and in El criticón he again borrowed from Rufo’s collection (Rufo 1972, xxv–xlv). Carrió’s exhibition of wit in El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes should not be interpreted as a concession to journeymen or muleteers. Fool’s literature was not a phenomenon of Spanish popular culture: the masses in Spain did not read, and many men of Carrió’s standing and temperament devoured such books of wit. In Britain too, moreover, the long eighteenth century was the age of wit. In Richard Head’s Nugae venales, or Complaisant Companion, Being New Jests, Domestick and Foreign, Bulls, Rhodomontados, Pleasant Novels and Miscellanies, his “Epistle to the Reader” equated ignorance and blindness: “You ignorant brisk Fops, who being internally blind, can discern no farther than you can see, whose gaping mouthes dam’d up with silent Non-sense speaks loudly that ye are full of emptiness” (1675, n.p.). His first section, titled “Domestick Jests, Witty Reparties, &c.,” consists of witty short tales (1–132). The second section is “Foreign Jests: Witty Reparties, &c.” (133–98), and the third is “Witty Sayings of a French Jester” (199– 205); clearly, a jestbook was a cross-cultural enterprise. “A Bull Prologue” (206), “A Bull Letter” (207), and “Bulls” (208–43) follow. A section titled “Pleasant Stories” (244–75) precedes “A Cluster of Choice Novels” (276–311), which Head laughably claimed to have gotten from a gentleman who was standing in front of a pasquinade tacked to White Chapel Church, adding that they “may be more properly called Jests than Stories” (276–77). Another section is titled “Lyes and Improbabilities” (312–14), which is followed by “Miscellanies” (315–23). In his last section, “A Preachment on Malt,” Head elected to provide serious and jocose interpretations\n\nIntroduction 25\n\nof the riddle M.A.L.T. (324–27). Nathaniel Crouch’s Winter-Evening Entertainments (the seventh edition dates from 1737) contained tales and riddles with their solutions. There were also Jack Smart’s Merry Jester, or, The Wit’s Compleat Treasury (1750s), The Polite Companion, or Wit a-la-mode, Adapted to the Recreation of All Ranks and Degrees, from the Prince to the Peasant (1760), and the seventh edition of Ben Johnson’s Jests, or, The Wit’s Pocket Companion (1760?), all of which contained many of the same types of literature that we find in Santa Cruz and sprinkled throughout Carrió’s exposé: epigrams, inscriptions in jest and in earnest, tall tales, maxims, puns, moral tales, bulls and sundry jokes, retorts, and riddles. Comic theater’s contributions to El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes have not gone unnoticed. Several critics have studied the relationship of Concolorcorvo to the fool (bobo) of Spanish comedy, the closing epitaph’s relationship to eighteenthcentury Peruvian opera, and the similarities between Carrió’s targets of censure and those found in a satirical dialogue written in Lima during the same period.34 Carrió borrowed a great deal from drama, as did the blindmen who sold theatrical broadsides (pliegos teatrales), or recited them from memory.35 Rustics and their mules were often portrayed in baroque theater, and they are ever present in Carrió’s exposé. In one entremés (skit), a singing mule “turned monkey” laughed at and urinated on the play’s bobo (Ávila 1911, 205). Secretary Concolorcorvo is a serrano—a native of the Peruvian highlands—and often speaks like one, whereas one of his female counterparts (serrana) in a Spanish skit spoke of her Seor (instead of Señor) and had to choose between a wagoneer with his mule and a nobleman (Mendoza 1911, 332–35). Under “Author’s Obligations,” in the 1777 Reglamento para los teatros de Madrid (Ordinances for the Playhouses in Madrid) (Cotarelo y Mori 1904, 666–71), the list of “props and sundry items that [owners] must provide for their plays” included these: “Cardboard mules,” “Hempen Cloth Mule’s tail,” “Mule Harnesses and Saddles,” “Geese, bunkers and a bag-of-bones donkey,” and “Journal and Perfume Bottle” (668–70).36 Mules were still a part of everyday life in the Spanish world, even in capital cities, and comic theater during the Enlightenment still reflected their role in travel, trade, and communications. Indian painters and sculptors are “comic actors” (“comediantes”), the inspector observes (387), by which he meant that they were nobody’s fools. When Secretary Concolorcorvo asks for more time to describe the magnificence of his native Cuzco, the inspector responds with stage instructions, and the Secretary begins to mimic as a comic actor: Pasito, como digo yo; aparte, como dicen los cómicos españoles, y tout bas, como se explican los franceses, porque si lo oyen las mulatas de Lima le han de poner en el arpa, que es lo mismo que un trato de cuerda, con que ellas castigan a lo político. Molatas y molas, todo es uno, porque se fingen mansas por dar una patada a so satisfacción. Muy bien imita Vm [Concolorcorvo] a sus paisanos, porque no le cuesta trabajo. (395) �����\n\n26 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America [Keep it down, as I say; aside, like the Spanish writers of comedies say, and tout bas, as the French express themselves, because if the mulattas in Lima hear you, they will string you like a harp, which is the same thing as ­getting the cords treatment, with which they punish diplomatically. Mowlattas and mowles, they are one and the same, because they pretend to be tame just to kick yow harder. You imitate your countrymen quite well, [Mr. Concolorcorvo,] because it does not cost you any effort.] In Il Cannocchiale Aristotelico (The Aristotelian Telescope), published in the mid-seventeenth century, Emanuele Tesauro discussed symbols of wit that worked through words or content, noting that mimic performances were “animated hypotyposis.” They were metaphors built from hypotyposis in content, or things: “all this that represents some Action with a lifelike quality and energy and movement” (1968, 616). Like the fool of fool’s literature, Concolorcorvo often mimics others, and this adds a theatrical quality to El lazarillo de ciegos caminates. Yet make no mistake: Concolorcorvo is no fool; he just acts like one. As Don Quijote tells the bachiller Sansón Carrasco: “To tell witticisms and to write jokes is proper to great wits: the most astute figure in a drama is that of the fool (bobo), because he who wishes to let on that he is naïve, must not be” (2:53). In El lazarillo de ciegos ­caminantes, Carrió employs Concolorcorvo as a bobo to air his own wit, or discreción, on numerous ­occasions.\n\nJournalism and the Culture Wars: Carrió’s Indictment Significant links between newspapers and Carrió’s exposé have been conspicuously absent in discussions around the genre and audience of his narration. Newspapers and almanacs alike contained historical, geographical, and political news, as well as riddles. The practice of paying blindmen, who were often appropriated in the titles of almanacs, to sell newspapers was so pervasive that it had already yielded a popular adage to refer to a person who was going blind: “Está ya para vender gazetas” (“He’s already fit to sell newspapers”).37 Newspapers and journalists were the objects of contempt for many in Spain and Spanish America who decried their flattery, omissions, and plagiarism.38 Carrió himself was a critical reader of foreign news. In Montevideo, for example, Carrió’s alter ego, the inspector, laughs at an unidentified newspaper reporter from London who reported on a state dinner: “Venga ahora a espantarnos el gacetero de Londres con los trozos de vacas que se ponen en aquella capital en las mesas de estado. Si allí el mayor es de a 200 libras, de que comen doscientos milords, aquí se pone de a 500 sólo para siete u ocho gauderios” (136) (“Now let the gazetteer from London shock us with the pieces of beef that are served on state tables in that capital. If the biggest there weighs 200 pounds, which feeds 200 milords, here a piece weighing 500 pounds is served to just 7 or 8 gauchos”).\n\nIntroduction 27\n\nBecause Benedict Anderson (1983) has assigned to newspapers a significant role in the birth of nationalism, Latin Americanists by and large focus on Spanish-language newspapers published in the last third of the eighteenth century.39 Yet Spanish American newspapers published earlier help us to understand Carrió’s skepticism and his inclusion of an enigma (or riddle) in his exposé. Before addressing the specifics, it is important to have a general sense of what constituted journalism under the Spanish Bourbons and how the circulation of Spanish-language newspapers relied directly on the mail ferries and roads of the Spanish postal ­service. Like all literate residents in Spanish America, Carrió was familiar with Spanish newspapers such as Gaceta de Madrid (Madrid Gazette) and Mercurio histórico y político (Historiographical and Political Mercury). These, like letters and packages and commercial goods, traveled the postal routes of Spanish America. Even before they arrived in Spanish America, newspapers were dependent on the postal system in Spain. As Luis Miguel Enciso Recio has explained, “The shipments were done through La Coruña using the packetboats of the Postal Service. The routes were two: by way of Havana, from which they were distributed to New Spain, Cartagena and the Islands of Barlovento; and by way of Buenos Aires, which delivered to Peru, Chile and other points” (1957, 83). As a traveling merchant and later as postal inspector, Carrió was familiar with ports, postal routes, and mail ferries that traveled between Spanish America and La Coruña in his native Galicia. He had to have been familiar with the Gaceta de Madrid and the Mercurio histórico y político, which were sent to Spanish America by mail ferry in the years leading up to El lazarillo de ciegos caminantes and were distributed by the postal service. 40 The Gaceta de Madrid dates from the seventeenth century. The eighteenthcentury version was modeled after the French Gazette. In a royal decree that confirmed the publisher’s privileges in 1707, Philip V noted that he subscribed to and read issues of the Gaceta every week. In February 1761, publishing rights were incorporated by the Crown, and the publisher was compensated with monies taken from the postal service. By 1762, the Gaceta de Madrid was being managed by the secretary of state and his staff (Enciso Recio 1957, 25–32). Mercurio histórico y político had a more checkered past. Mercure historique et politique was published in Paris during the eighteenth century, and another Mercure historique et politique, which opposed the political flattery of the Parisian version, was published in Parma. Still another version was published at The Hague. According to one scholar of this last version, “Spain received extensive treatment and general condemnation in the Mercure historique et politique during the ascendancy of the Queen Elizabeth Farnese during the period 1714–1746. . . . In the 1750’s editorial fear of Spain as a force disruptive to the peace of Europe declined and editorial interest in Spain diminished from then on. For example, the enlightened despotism of King Charles III (1759–1788) went unpraised in stark contrast to the hero worship offered to Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great” (Crawford 1969, 181–83).\n\n28 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America The Spanish Mercurio histórico y político, which began publishing in 1738, translated news not only from the Mercure published in Parma but also from “different Diarios, Mercurios, Gacetas from all countries” (qtd. in Enciso Recio 1957, 44) for its reports. The editor also included geographical descriptions of Europe, stories, and recent developments in the arts and sciences. Since 1739, it was required that both the Gaceta de Madrid and Mercurio histórico y político be approved by one of the king’s ministers before going to press (Enciso Recio 1957, 26–44).41 Politics, rationalism, and economic desires underpinned the optimism of publishers and editors in eighteenth-century New Spain. The first newspaper to be published in Mexico City, Gaceta de México y noticias de Nueva España (Mexico City Gazette and News from New Spain) (1722) and the second, Gaceta de México (Mexico City Gazette) (1728–1739) were monthly publications. The editor of the first noted that, during the tenure of the marquis de Castell-dos-Rius, the first Bourbon viceroy of Peru, sheets of news had been printed in Lima and that a gazette was not without “utility,” since it was “a most faithful account of what occurs in these far-flung regions.” Journalists also could please those in Europe who “ask[ed] for news of America in order to enrich their histories with novelty” (qtd. in Agüeros de la Portilla 1911, 400). Europeans relied on newspaper accounts “to enrich . . . their histories,” a reliance shared by many of their Spanish American counterparts, and journalism played a significant role in the construction of learned versions of Spanish American events. As we shall see, that reliance could irritate participants in the same events whose memories of them differed from those “most faithful account[s].”42 The last issue of Gaceta de México y Noticias de Nueva España was published in June 1722. Roughly six years later, on January 1, 1728, the Holy Office’s publisher, Joseph Bernardo de Hogal, launched Mexico City’s second regularly published newspaper, Gaceta de México (Mexico City Gazette) (1728–1739). The publisher’s comments in the first issue confirm that the distinction between journalists and historians was becoming fuzzy and that rationalism was bolstering confidence in the work product of both sets of intellectuals: It has not been precisely determined when Gazettes came into fashion, but one can safely assume that it was over two centuries ago, for the great Historian, Father Famián de Estrada, put together the eloquent History of the Wars in Flanders for the most part from the Gazettes that he had read, and though knowledge of when they began in Spain has retreated from inquiry, their utility to Chronicles is public knowledge, and more so to the most recent ones, for the Gazettes of Madrid since 1700, which was [the year of ] the precious death of the pious Lord Don Charles II, contain the Reign of our August Philip, and with their news the discreet Historian, Dr. Don Juan de la Cruz, published four books, very pleasant though small. (qtd. in Agüeros de la Portilla 1911, 405–6)\n\nIntroduction 29\n\nThe editor of Gaceta de México noted that a viceroy of Peru had relied heavily on newspapers (including those published sporadically in Lima since the turn of the eighteenth century) to inform his mandates. (Guatemala, too, imitated Lima’s example: Gaceta de Guatemala [Guatemala Gazette] first rolled off Sebastián de Arévalo’s press in 1729 [Vela 1960, 1:160; Agüeros de la Portilla 1911, 400–407].) He then added, “In many courts in Europe, Gazettes roll off the press every week, and every month, like in Paris and Parma, . . . with the title of Mercurio Histórico y Político, which contains the actual state of Europe and what is happening in its Courts, the affairs of its Princes and their intentions” (qtd. in Agüeros de la Portilla 1911, 406). As the messenger to the gods and as the god of eloquence, commerce, theft, and travel, Mercury (Mercurio) was adopted as the name of many newspapers. Mercury made his appearance in Mexico City, in Mercurio de México (Mexico City Mercury), first published in 1742. Political and religious officials who worked outside of the Capital served as regional correspondents of the Mercurio de México by mailing their news to the editor (Agüeros de la Portilla 1911, 399–410). The first ­ issue of Gaceta de Lima (Lima Gazette) was published in 1744, and in the early years of the Gaceta, Mercury appeared at the top of the front page (Figure 3). While Carrió was inspecting the posts from Lima to Buenos Aires/Montevideo, a vehicle of Enlightenment science, Mercurio Volante con noticias importantes y curiosas sobre varios asuntos de Física y Medicina (Flying Mercury with Important and Curious News about Various Matters of Physics and Medicine) was published in Mexico City. True to its name, Mercurio Volante had a fleeting existence: it began circulation in November 1772 and ceased in February 1773 (413–16). In the late sixteenth century, historians had tried to guide travelers in their journeys; in the eighteenth century, travelers (including newspaper correspondents) were guiding historians. Spanish American newspapers allowed and even encouraged the learned—intellectuals and Crown officials alike—to become armchair travelers, while newspaper editors in the capitals relied on correspondents whose reports from the provinces reached the editors by post. But because travelers and armchair travelers alike required rest, newspapers in Europe and Spanish America frequently offered their readers a bit of intellectual entertainment in the form of a riddle (enigma). Sebastián de Covarrubias Orozco’s definition from 1611 confirmed that the learned of the renaissance knew of riddles: “ENIGMA. Is a Greek name . . . ; [it] is an obscure allegory, or a deceptive and intricate matter or question invented at the pleasure of the person who presents it” (1943, 520). Collections of riddles were very popular in Spain, and not only among renaissance humanists: Cristóbal Pérez de Herrera’s collection (1733, 1943), first published in 1608, was republished numerous times well into the eighteenth century. Emanuele Tesauro treated the marvelous (il mirabile), of which the last species was “the RIDDLE, which our Author [Aristotle] calls, A witty oration composed of\n\n30 Hierarchy, Commerce, and Fraud in Bourbon Spanish America the most disparate terms” (1968, 459). One sort of riddle that was published in collections and newspapers was aptly described by Tesauro in his treatment of ambiguity, or equivocation: “Likewise many Riddles are born from this, like when you call a Rainbow A bow without a string and without arrows. And the crane for lifting heavy objects, I am a Crane, but I do not fly. And threatening [someone] with the apple [pomo; i.e., handle] of a sword, I will make you eat an apple that will break your teeth” (389). These examples are of the sort of riddle often written in verse and called adivinanza (“guess”) in Spanish because it requires readers to guess (adivinar) the thing, person, or action to which the riddle alludes.43 In Arte de ingenio, Gracián discussed another type of riddle that was included in newspapers. In “On the Conceits of Questions” (“De los Conceptos por Qüestión”), Gracián wrote, “Every Question demands thought and is pleasant food for wit: through difficulty it gives pause and through the witty solution it pleases. The artfulness and wit of this principal form of sharpness consists, then, of a queer, hidden and mo"
