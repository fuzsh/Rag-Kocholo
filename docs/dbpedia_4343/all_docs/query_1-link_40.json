        "text": "Pedro de Mendoza (born 1487, Guadix, Granada [Spain]—died June 23, 1537, on shipboard in the Atlantic Ocean) was a Spanish soldier and explorer, the first governor of the Río de la Plata region of Argentina and founder of Buenos Aires.\n\nBorn into a distinguished Spanish family, as a young man Mendoza served as an officer during the Spanish campaigns in Italy. Because the emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain), spurred by reports of the great wealth of the Incas, wanted Spain to be the first nation to explore the interior of South America, he appointed Mendoza the head of an expedition of conquest and colonization in the Río de la Plata area, with instructions to found three cities and establish rule over an extensive region."
