The lawyer Eugenio de Salazar said that he understands that the person of the said Domingo Martínez parts concur so that Your Majesty do him favor, although by processes that he has followed as agent in this Audience against Carvajal, governor of el Nuevo Reino de León, it seems that the said Carvajal, nor [sic] the ones who have been in his company, have no obligation to Your Majesty for the services which they did for him there.\"103 Also Don Luis de Velasco II recommends him to the king: \"... a soldier who had performed the office of treasurer (sic for agent) of Your Majesty in that land with the governor, Luis de Carvajal, that his name is Domingo Martínez de Cearreta, nobleman and of good intentions and known by the people that travel that area...\"104\n\nOn April 27, 1589, Carvajal states in his process that Domingo lived in Mexico City at this date.\n\nPedro Martínez de Cearreta, son of the previous one; in April of 1589, he resided in el Nuevo Reino de León.\n\nCousin of Domingo Martínez de Dearreta, \"cleric who went from here to Peru.\"\n\nDiego Martínez de Valladares, \"official for making bells, inhabitant of the place of Yola (sic), diocese of Burgos ...works with the illustrious gentleman Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva and governor and captain general of el Nuevo Reino de León, of the provinces of la Nueva España, to populate the said kingdom.\"105\n\nAna de Reyes, wife of Diego de Madrid.106\n\nAlonso de los Reyes, native of Espinosa de los Monteros, connected with Carvajal to populate the Nuevo Reino de León February 9, 1580, together with Pedro López de Mendoza, Alonso García Mendoza, Juan Jiménez Mendoza and Pedro Rodríguez.107\n\nGeneral Index | Prologue | Next | Previous\n\nMain Page | Local History Documents\n\nUse CTRL + F to find text in the document\n\nPage 66\n\nPedro Rodríguez, native of Espinosa de los Monteros, simple homonym of the other Pedro Rodríguez, native of Fundao in Portugal.108\n\nJuan de Saucedo Espinosa, carpenter, native of la Puebla de Guadalupe (Cáceres), \"in his own name and in that of his wife, he is connects with ...

Settlers of el Nuevo Reino de León in the epoch of Carvajal (1582-1590).\n\nWe anticipate the reader that this important section we offer to him only as an unfinished writing which needs to be carefully elaborated again, deepening the investigation as far as possible, seeking zealously new sources which permit the enlargement of the list of settlers as well as the data regarding each one of them. The list, which up to now we have been able to form, is very incomplete and, what is more important, we do not have sufficient data to group them in a clear and convenient form; but, with everything and that, we believe it useful to present here our defective unfinished writing.\n\n1. Passengers of the \"Santa Catalina.\" We shall begin with a simple list of the passengers, of the vessel \"Santa Catalina,\" who entered with Carvajal into the Nuevo Reino de León, since the data, which we have of them, were consigned to the previous section .\n\nAndrés del Aguila, Pascual de Alcedo, Rodrigo de la Barreda, the carpenter Braba, Luis de Carvajal, the Younger, Vicente Correa, Gaspar Delgado,Alonso García Mendoza - in 1631 an Alonso García was major constable of the city of Monterrey - Manuel de Herrera, the carpenter Iñigo, Juan Izquierdo, Juan Jiménez Mendoza, Diego de Madrid, Domingo Martínez de Cearreta, Pedro Martínez de Cearreta Buitrón, Diego Martínez de Valladares, Felipe Núñez de Rivera, Francissca Núñez Viciosa, Luis Pimentel, Ana de los Reyes, Alonso del Río, Alonso Rodríguez, Antonio Rodríguez de Paiva, Baltasar Rodríguez, Francisco Rodríguez de Matos, Pedro Rodríguez, Diego Ruiz de Rivera, Juan Salado, Juan de Saucedo Espinosa, wife of Juan de Saucedo Espinosa.\n\nWe have serious doubts that some of those mentioned in this list would have entered into the Nuevo Reino de León although they contracted it in Spain as settlers of it, these are: Pascual de Alcedo, Juan Jiménez Mendoza, Pedro López de Mendoza, Diego de Madrid, Diego Martínez de Valladares, Ana de los Reyes, Alonso del Río, Pedro Rodríguez, Juan de Saucedo Espinosa, and his wife.\n\nThis results in a total of thirty-two persons of which ten are doubtful; we are left, with certainty, twenty-two passengers of the \"Santa Catalina\" who entered into el Nuevo Reino de León, a greater number than we had always imagined. It is interesting to note that ten persons, who seem doubtful to us, are precisely of those about whom we have no data to affirm their Judeo-Portuguese origin, of which we are certain of the other twenty-two that they were Sephardics.\n\n2. That entered through Pánuco. It is obvious that all these person entered into el Nuevo Reino de León from the province of Pánuco; let us say now, about others who, without having been passengers in the \"Santa Catalina,\" also came from Pánuco with Carvajal.\n\nPedro de Alvear, soldier of Carvajal in la Huasteca; October 20, 1580, he was in Mexico City accompanying the governor.110\n\nSomeone Alonso, \"... who lives near here (the jails of the Inquisition in Mexico City), served me two years (in el Nuevo Reino de León),\" states Carvajal in his \"Autodefensa.\"111 In our extensive list of settlers of the north of Mexico we have registered several persons of the surname Alonso who are Portuguese, like: \"Juan Alono [sic], Portuguese, inhabitant of Saltillo in 1589\"112 or \"Pedro Alonso Falcón, inhabitant of Coimbra in Portugal, father of Gonzalo Hernández, soldier of Juan de Oñate.\"113\n\nLuis Álvarez, Portuguese, soldier of Carvajal.114\n\nGeneral Index | Prologue | Next | Previous\n\nMain Page | Local History Documents\n\nUse CTRL + F to find text in the document\n\nPage 67\n\nGaspar de Meneses, soldier of Carvajal whom he accompanied to the war of Tamapache at the end of 1583.141\n\nAlonso Montaño, inhabitant of the town of los Valles, was a soldier of Carvajal142 and we believe that he remained in the lands of Coahuila or of la Nueva Vizcaya because, in 1604 a young bachelor named Alonso Montaño was an inhabitant of Cuencamé143 and in 1627 Catalina Montaño was the wife of Mateo de Villafranca, one of the oldest and most important inhabitants of the city of Monterrey.144\n\nPedro Morán, investigating official in el Nuevo Reino de León; he was the one who took the \"information of one hundred witnesses\" of which Carvajal speaks.145\n\nDiego Núñez de Mendoza, who was captain and junior judge in the city of Monterrey.146\n\nLuis Olid de Biedma, priest and vicar of the town of los Valles, who accompanied Carvajal in one of his entries into el Nuevo Reino de León. On March 14, 1584, he stated being of the age of 46 years (born in 1538) and having come to la Huasteca 16 years before (1568).147\n\nMartín Ortiz, cleric and vicar of we know not where, who traveled with Carvajal.148\n\nMelchor de Paiva, soldier of Carvajal, with whom he was on June 14, 1583, in the town of Tancolol;149 we believe that he is the Paiva mentioned by Luis de Carvajal, the Younger; \"Likewise, that to a Paiva of el Saltillo, to an Herrera, and to a Correa, he said of them that they were Jews, with fear and because they would leave him.\"150 As we were saying earlier, we believe this Melchor de Paiva, to be a very close relative of Simon de Paiva.\n\nAndrés Palomo, Alonso de León tells us: \"They helped very much in the discovery of this kingdom and everything else that the governor did, the captains Palomo and Agustín de Zarza, to whom Governor Luis de Carvajal owed the greater part of the fortune he enjoyed...\"151 On August 24, 1589, the vicar of the town of Saltillo and Captain Juan Marlete accused an Andrés Palomo: \"He gave notice as well, how an Andrés Palomo, soldier, being with other soldiers in the church, hearing major mass, the said vicar returning to celebrate the feast for the public, he reprimanded the said soldiers because they made entries and took the natives and took away their freedom, without having a commission for it, that they should see that it was a great offence to God, and that he should not absolve those said ones, nor could he do it; the said Andrés Palomo said to the soldiers who were next to him, do not give it a thought, that if the vicar does not want to absolve us, there is Chimamal who would absolve us, and Chimamal was a Chichimecan Indian who was hanged; witnesses of it are Juan Navarro and Pedro de San Juan Pérez Chocallo, inhabitants of this town and many other persons.\"152\n\nAndrés Pérez,on May 2, 1588, signed, as scribe of the government of el Nuevo Reino de León, the document of the arrival of the royal treasury to the town of Almadén and on the previous April 5 he had signed, with the same character, the title of lieutenant given by Carvajal to Diego de Montemayor.153 In 1590 he accompanied Gaspar Castaño de Sosa in his expedition to New Mexico, also as secretary of the government.154 In 1549 there was an Andrés Pérez , inhabitant of Pánuco, who declared having come to la Nueva España 22 years ago (1527) and that \"he was in the conquests of Motín & Jalisco and in many entries in the province of Pánuco ...\"155 Might he be the father of Carvajal's secretary?\n\nJuan Pinto, Portuguese, native of Tavira in the 'Algarves' of Portugal, inhabitant of Pánuco since 1568 and one of Carvajal's soldiers.156 On December 3, 1569, a certain Arias Pinto, Portuguese, lived in the town of los Valles.157\n\nPedro Pinto, Negro, native of Portugal who, in 1590, entered into New Mexico with Castaño de Sosa.158 At some time might he have been a slave of Juan Pinto?\n\nJuan de Portes was a scrivener of Carvajal in the war of Jalpa and in other entries. In 1591 he lived in Mexico city as \"scrivener ... before the officials of His Majesty.\"159\n\nDiego Ramírez Barrionuevo, on June 14, 1583, was one of the captains who accompanied Carvajal in the town of Tancolol; on March 11, 1584, he figures as Luis Carvajal de la Cueva's camp grandmaster in the war of Tamapache.160 In 1588 he was an agent of the royal treasury in the town of Almadén.161\n\nSebastián Rodríguez, associate of Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva in the cattle ranch that they bought from Don Lope de Sosa in la Huasteca.162 In reality we have no datumthat allows us to affirm that he entered with his associate into el Nuevo Reino.\n\nDiego de Salas, agent of Tampuxi (sic) in la Huasteca, accompanied Carvajal as a soldier on his trip from Pánuco to Mazapil in 1573 and on other entries. Salas was \"a native of this land (la Huasteca)\" and inhabitant of the town of los Valles.163\n\nFrancisco de Solís, soldier of Carvajal; on August 27, 1584, he declared, in the mines of Zimapán, being 28 years of age.164\n\nFrancisco de Sosa. Alonso de León says that the major justice Diego Rodríguez, in 1611, tried to rebuild the city of León (Cerralvo, N.L.) and work the mines there; for which some people came, that their not being able to withstand the hunger and too many Indians, the interest in the silver being so small, they went back; there remaining a mulatto called Francisco de Sosa - who came with Governor Luis de Carvajal - in that post, alone, with his wife and children. The impudences of the Indians grew, what with the little resistance they found; and one night, Sosa being outside of his hut, the Indians arrived shooting arrows. He fled to save himself; he was in his shirt sleeves; they shot at the white; he diverted the Indians by quickly taking off his shirt, which remained hanging on a spine; they continued shooting the shirt and he, since he was black and it was dark (sic) had time to enter into his house from where he defended himself that night. The strategy saved his life and with it he saved his house ... Another day Diego de Solís arrived sent by the major justice, to see how he was and, the impudence seen, they deserted right away; that the little strength oblige all that.\"165\n\nAntonio Velázquez, soldier of Carvajal with whom he was on June 14, 1583, in the town of Tancolol.166\n\nJuan de Victoria Carvajal. We believe that he is the Juan de Carvajal mentioned earlier, the interpreter of the Mexican language of Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva; our conjecture is strengthened at knowing that Juan de Victoria Carvajal was born in Yautepec in the marquisate of the valley of Oaxaca around 1561 and he was the son of Juan de Carvajal and very probably a mestizo, which would explain his knowledge of the Mexican language. He was of medium stature, with a light-brown beard and 37 years of age in February of 1597 when he entered into New Mexico with Don Juan de Oñate. He had already entered before, in 1590, with Gaspar Castaño de Sosa.167\n\nAgustín de la Zarza. See previous [material] what we say about Andres Palomo. In 1524 Miguel de la Zarza, native of Zarza de Alanje in Badojoz, arrived in la Nueva España in company of Juan and Tomé Cortés, natives of Medellín, also in Badajoz.168 In 1526 Juan de la Zarza, native of Ciudad Rodrigo in Salamanca went to Mexico with his brother Amador de Tapia, sons of Alonso de la Zarza and Teresa Gómez. Juan de la Zarza was a visitor of Oaxaca and la Mizteca in 1547.169\n\nThis second list of persons, who entered with Carvajal into la Huasteca, gives us a total of forty, of which we have data or vehement suspicions that 25 of them belonged to the crypto-Jews, or be it 62.5%. If we unite these data with those of the passengers of the vessel\"Santa Catalina,\" we would have a total of 72 persons, of which 47 would be Sephardics, which gives a percentage of 65.3%.\n\n3. That they entered through Saltillo. We go on now to speak of the people who, in the epoch of Carvajal, entered into el Nuevo Reino de León through the \"road of the Zacatecas,\" across Mazapil and Saltillo. We must advise the reader that we shall include, in this third list, the founders and the old settlers of Saltillo for the following reasons. First, Carvajal usurped this jurisdiction and changed authorities and attracted the inhabitants into his faction; let us hear what Alonso de León tells us: He went into Saltillo, which was an older settlement and in virtue of his stipulations, due to falling in the demarcation of his jurisdiction (we have already seen that this is false), he removed justice; placing on his own those which he liked. Having returned from Saltillo with some inhabitants of Saltillo, since he knew how to flatter all and attract them with his kindness and demeanor, he populated, in the north part of the eye of Monterrey, the town of San Luis.\"170 Second, we have already seen how the settlements founded (?) by Carvajal were ephemerid ones; Saltillo was the refuge of those who were depopulating them. Third, Carvajal took out of Saltillo all the settlers of his town of Almadén and a part of these accompanied Castaño de Sosa to New Mexico. Finally, the twelve families that entered with Montemayor for the foundation of the Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey in 1596, also left from Saltillo.\n\nOur third list is the following:\n\nGeneral Index | Prologue | Next | Previous\n\nMain Page | Local History Documents\n\nUse CTRL + F to find text in the document\n\nPage 68\n\nDiego de Aguirre. In 1580 Francisco de Urdiñola entered, on the orders of Captain Diego de Aguirre, to fight the warring Indians in the district of Saltillo.171\n\nFortunato de Aguirre, founder of Saltillo.172\n\nMatías de Aguirre, captain and one of the first settlers of Saltillo.173\n\nOrtuño de Aguirre, tailor and one of the oldest settlers of Saltillo.174\n\nSomebody Alanís, inhabitant of Saltillo since before 1586.175\n\nCatalina de Alfaro, Mestiza, inhabitant of Saltillo since before the marriage of Alberto del Canto (1586).176\n\nDiego Alonso, of the first settlers of Saltillo.177\n\nJuan Alonso, Portuguese and one of the founders of Saltillo who figures in the list of land water grants awarded by Alberto del Canto in 1577.178\n\nMelchor Álvarez, Portuguese, companion of Alberto del Canto in the founding of Saltillo..179 In 1584 an old Portuguese of more than 73 years of age named Melchor Álvarez lived in Guadalajara, presented as a witness for Francisco Barrón in his battle against Carvajal. Might he have something to do with his aforementioned homonym?180 Hernando Arias, \"the Samson\" of el Nuevo Reino de León of whom the chronicler speaks to us.181\n\nMagdalena de Avila, wife of Juan López, parents of Bartolomé, Tomás and Lucas López, from the old settlers of el Nuevo Reino de León.182\n\nMateo de Barraza, notary public and one of the founders of Saltillo.183 On April 1, 1578, he received from Martín López de Ibarra a gift of lands in the valley of el Pirineo (Parras, Coah.).184 In 1604 a married man without hacienda named Mateo de Barraza was an inhabitant of Durango.185\n\nAlonso de Barreda. \"About Alonso de Barreda we only know that he was the first senior mayor of Monterrey, designated by Montemayor in the record of foundation; and that he settled his farming hacienda to the west of Santa Catalina.\"186\n\nFrancisco de Bascones, companion of Castaño de Sosa in his entry in New Mexico.187\n\nFrancisco de Bellerías, owner of the woods of las Caleras in the jurisdiction of Saltillo.188\n\nCristóbal de Biruega, of the expedition of Castaño de Sosa to New Mexico.189\n\nDiego de Biruega.

In 1596 he was the owner of an hacienda of silver mining in las Tapiezuelas, in la Pesquería Chica (Marín , N.L.).191\n\nLuis Bogaror, captain and one of the oldest settlers of Saltillo.192\n\nSomebody Bustamante, in the battle the people of Diego de Montemayor and those of Alberto del Canto had in the city of León (Cerralvo, N.L.), \"they killed one of the outside ones (of the people of Alberto del Canto) named Bustamante.\"193 Might Pedro de Bustamante be a companion of Sánchez Chamuscado in his expedition to New Mexico? In 1582 he stated being 34 years of age, native of the town called Carancejas of the mountain in the valley of Cabezón near the town of Santillana, that he came to the Nueva España around 1572; that the first three years he was a discoverer of mines and the other seven at the service of His Majesty in the government of Diego de Ibarra.194\n\nJuan Calderón, town councillor of the town of Almadén around the year of 1588.195\n\nSomebody Camacho, one of the first settlers of el Nuevo Reino de León.196\n\nAlberto del Canto of whom we spoke earlier.\n\nFrancisco de Cardona, in 1599 he was an inhabitant of Monterrey.197\n\nSomebody Carrillo, inhabitant of Saltillo since before 1589 had been a prisoner in Guadalajara for bigamy.198\n\nGaspar Castaño de Sosa with whom we will occupy ourselves amply farther on.\n\nHernando de Castro, Portuguese, accused on April 10, 1575, of \"on holy Thursdays he locked himself in his room, in his dwelling (of Sain) and he would arm himself and he would take his sword in hand and with it he would stab at a crucifix, and then he would rest and he would sit in a chair to return to stabbing at the crucifix.\"199 Exactly forty years before, on April 3, 1535, there were, registering in the House of Commerce of Seville to go to the Indies, \"Hernando de Castro and Juan de Castro, his brother, sons of Hernando de Castro and of Teresa de Figueroa, inhabitants of Cáceres, at Santo Domingo.\"200 Although the investigator is never exempt from falling into the dangerous trap of the\n\nGeneral Index | Prologue | Next | Previous\n\nMain Page | Local History Documents\n\nUse CTRL + F to find text in the document\n\nPage 69"
