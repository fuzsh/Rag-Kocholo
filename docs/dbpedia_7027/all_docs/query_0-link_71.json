        "text": "The buzz on potential Oscar contenders from the first half of 2024 seems quieter than usual. Nonetheless, stars such as Zendaya, Cannes winner Jesse Plemons and Hollywood’s new “hit man,” Glen Powell, will be among those hoping to stay afloat in the awards conversation until the end of the season.\n\nSignificant financial successes from the top of the box office charts are worth celebrating. Warner Bros.’ sci-fi epic sequel, “Dune: Part Two,” could become the seventh movie nominated in all seven technical categories, following its 2022 predecessor. Pixar’s big comeback, “Inside Out 2,” might vie for more than just a spot in the best animated feature category.\n\nThis year also features several one-offs — films hoping for one or two mentions in a year likely to be dominated by legacy studios and streaming giants. As we approach this year’s midpoint, Variety is listing possible awards contenders in 20 of the 23 Oscar categories that could be in the running by the end of the year.\n\n[Editor’s Note: To discuss the most significant number of movies, a film is only highlighted in one category.]\n\nAmazon MGM’s “Challengers,” directed by Italian auteur Luca Guadagnino, boasts an impressive turn from Zendaya in a femme fatale role that could bring the 27-year-old her first Oscar nod. If it can sustain until the fall season, it might also contend for original screenplay or a best picture slot.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos’s anthology film “Kinds of Kindness” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but that’s typical for the Greek filmmaker’s audacious outings (“The Favourite,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”). After debuting at the Cannes Film Festival, the black comedy garnered a best actor trophy for Oscar nominee Jesse Plemons (“The Power of the Dog”). Depending on whether he campaigns for lead or supporting actor, Plemons could earn his second nod. However, anything outside of Plemons might be too tall of an order.\n\nNetflix is also in the running with the animated adaptation of the Japanese superhero “Ultraman: Rising” and, more notably, Richard Linklater’s dark rom-com “Hit Man.” The streamer acquired the film at TIFF in 2023, resulting in another big win for star Glen Powell, who also co-wrote the script adapted from the Texas Monthly article by Skip Hollandsworth. Netflix will work to keep it on voters’ minds throughout the year, aiming for at least some Golden Globes traction.\n\nBox office receipts fuel awards campaigns, which is why we might see efforts from studios with franchise movies such as DreamWorks Animation’s “Kung Fu Panda 4,” 20th Century Studios’ “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” and WB’s “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,” among the top 10 domestic grossers so far.\n\nHowever, money isn’t everything. Sony’s “The Garfield Movie,” featuring Chris Pratt as the world-famous Monday-hating cat, has accumulated an impressive $207 million globally. But that won’t be enough to overcome the film’s critical panning and mount an Oscar campaign.\n\nWhat happens when a movie doesn’t get audiences in the door? Is the 81% Rotten Tomatoes score enough for Universal Pictures to push for recognition for David Leitch’s action-ode to stunt performers, “The Fall Guy”? Or perhaps a Golden Globes push in the comedy races for stars Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt? It’s worth it, especially for sound and editing, and with a stunt Oscar on the horizon.\n\nThe first official best picture rankings will be posted on Monday, July 1.\n\n** Not all listed crew members are official. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and its various committees ultimately decide on credits."
