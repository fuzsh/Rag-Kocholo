        "text": "How to do a sequel - The Godfather: Part II review by CP Customer\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n09/05/2009\n\nThis is an example of a sequel delivering far more than we could have envisaged. Yet even as a standalone film it works marvellously well. Coppola weaves the continuing tale of the Corleone family; in effect there are two strands in this sequel. One concerning the original Godfather and how he came to be in America, but we also follow Pacino as his replacement, growing in power, influence and unleashing revenge on those who have done his family wrong. You should watch the Godfather trilogy in order but you can return to these films again and again to appreciate the marvellous quality.\n\n1 out of 3 members found this review helpful.\n\nEven better than the original - The Godfather: Part II review by RP\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n30/01/2012\n\nI've recently taken the opportunity to see (again!) the 'Godfather' trilogy. The original film in the series was made waaaaay back in 1972, 'Godfather Part II' in 1974 and 'Godfather Part III' in 1990. This film – Part II - is my favourite and I consider it even better than the original. Although a 'Best Supporting Actor' Oscar went to Robert de Niro for his role as the young Vito Corleone, my vote goes to Al Pacino for his role as Michael Corleone, Vito's son and successor as 'the Godfather'. (Aside: In fact he did win a BAFTA for Best Actor, but I'm sure he'd rather have had an Oscar). It is a superb film and while it is a sequel it is a fine film in its own right and is strong enough to stand alone. There are two strands to the story: Michael Corleone's progress as he ruthlessly expands his father's empire into legalised gambling in Nevada and (unsuccessfully) into Cuba, and the story of the young, orphaned Vito Corleone coming from Sicily to the US and making his name as a young but powerful figure in the New York Italian community. The film ends sadly with Michael reflecting on the deaths in his own family, his estrangement from his wife and the heartbreaking decision to order the killing of his own brother. Superb stuff – 5/5 stars.\n\n1 out of 1 members found this review helpful.\n\nMasterpiece - The Godfather: Part II review by GI\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n10/11/2022\n\nA simply glorious piece of film making and one of those rare occasions where a sequel is as good, if not better, than the original. Director Francis Ford Coppola's striking recreation of the early 1900s and the 1950s and the somewhat unique structure of this film makes it a rewarding viewing experience. It's a modern cinematic art masterpiece and a film worthy of repeated viewings. It's so rich in detail that there are gems to be discovered each time you see it. The film is both prequel and sequel to the original with the two storylines intermixed creating a contrast between the rise of Vito Corleone, here played by Robert De Niro, and the continuing saga of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he secures his empire through murder whilst claiming to be making the 'family' legitimate and having to deal with a senate hearing on organised crime. Coppola fills the screen with so much authenticity in the scenes that begin in Sicily with Vito, as a young boy, having to flee the local mafia boss who has murdered his family - a sequence that proves a key to the character's development later. The New York of 1901 and beyond where, as a young man, Vito realises that crime is the way to provide for his future sets his life on course to become the later head of the mafia family. There's some cold and precise violence displayed here although as with the first film it is restrained and whilst realistic it's not gratuitous. The intermixing of the family in Nevada where Michael rules without challenge is a story of corruption and Pacino's Michael has now transformed from reluctant crime boss to evil incarnate. His character is the epitome of the maxim 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' and we watch as he gradually turns on his own family members where he sees betrayal. Pacino is a tour de force here aided by Diane Keaton who has a more powerful role as his wife Kay who gradually comes to challenge and hate him. There's also a recreation of historical events that look and feel documentary in style especially the senate hearings and the Cuban revolution which has a key role in the narrative. A wonderful film, a family saga, epic and melodramatic and one of the finest films ever made.\n\n0 out of 0 members found this review helpful."
