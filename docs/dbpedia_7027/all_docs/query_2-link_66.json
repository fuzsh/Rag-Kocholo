        "text": "And the BAFTA for best prank goes to . . .\n\nMembers of the British Academy Film Awards security team revealed that they ousted a prankster shortly after he managed to join the cast and crew of “Oppenheimer” onstage after the ensemble won the coveted best film award on Sunday.\n\n“A social media prankster was removed by security last night after joining the winners of the final award on stage,” a BAFTA spokesperson told Deadline after the awards show. “We are taking this very seriously, and don’t wish to grant him any publicity by commenting further.”\n\nAccording to BAFTA officials, the prankster seized the opportunity to join the film’s cast and crew when “Oppenheimer” producer Emma Thomas urged several members of the cast to join them onstage, saying: “Where are you? Come on, all of you!”\n\nThe BBC broadcast caught the prank artist sprinting up onto the stage as Hollywood icon Michael J. Fox presented the team with the award.\n\nDespite the award show refusing to name the individual, several online fans identified the man as a YouTuber who uses the alias Lizwani.\n\n“Looks like @LizwaniYT broke onto the stage during #Oppenheimer winning at @BAFTA,” one fan posted on X along with a video of the prankster skulking behind Thomas, 52, and the film’s director, Christopher Nolan, who is her husband.\n\nThe prankster, who was dressed in a formal suit and black hat, can be seen looking around before smirking and looking at the ground during Thomas’ acceptance speech.\n\nThe Post reached out to both the BAFTAs and Lizwani for comment.\n\nLizwani, whose YouTube channel is filled with several other prank videos, confirmed his appearance at the award show by posting two photos and one video on his Instagram story.\n\nIn the video, Lizwani revealed that his infiltration of the BAFTAs was his “2nd TV appearance” and that a video will “be out soon.”\n\nThe prankster later further revealed that police had reportedly taken away part of his footage, but claimed that he still planned to release a video because he “has a lot left.”\n\nLizwani later posted a photo of himself claiming that if it reached 1,000 likes he would release the full video.\n\nThe post currently sits at 930 likes.\n\nThis is not the first time that the YouTuber has snuck into high-profile events.\n\nIn 2022, the man managed to sneak into the Brit Awards as well as the Fifa Ballon d’Or soccer award.\n\n“Oppenheimer” took home seven prizes, including a best director award for Nolan, 53, and star Cillian Murphy won the leading actor award."
