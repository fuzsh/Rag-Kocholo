        "text": "Her mother is an Oscar-winning film-maker. Her grandfather shot one of the greatest movies, The Godfather.\n\nNow, Romy Coppola Mars has joined the family dynasty - with a TikTok that has inadvertently made her a viral star.\n\nIn the clip, external, the 16-year-old daughter of Sofia Coppola and granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola said she had been grounded for trying to charter a helicopter with her dad's credit card.\n\n\"The Coppola dynasty continues to produce greatness,\" joked one new fan, external.\n\nThe teenager seemingly did not intend to announce herself as the latest sensation in the family line, saying she was going against her parents' rule not to have a public social media account only because she was already grounded.\n\n\"They don't want me to be a nepotism kid,\" she told her followers. \"But TikTok is not going to make me famous, so it doesn't really matter.\"\n\nHowever, she was wrong about it not making her famous and her account was short-lived, apparently being deleted.\n\nWhile the video may have disappeared from TikTok, it was captured before it did and has been viewed 10 million times on Twitter.\n\nIt begins with her in the kitchen inviting viewers to \"make vodka pasta sauce with me because I'm grounded\".\n\nShe then reveals she had been punished by her parents \"because I tried to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland on my dad's credit card because I wanted to have dinner with my camp friend\".\n\nHer father, Thomas Mars, is in French indie band Phoenix. At one point in the video, Romy holds up the Grammy Award he won in 2010.\n\nReturning to the recipe, she says she does not know the difference between a garlic bulb and an onion, before making an innocent face and holding up a kitchen knife.\n\nShe then introduces her babysitter's boyfriend, explaining \"my parents are never home, so these are my replacement parents\"."
