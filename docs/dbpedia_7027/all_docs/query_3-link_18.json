        "text": "Topline\n\nThe Oscars are the latest in a long line of targets branded as “woke” over rules that are set to take place next year to encourage diversity among Best Picture nominees—but some right-wing critics are erroneously stating that all nominees must meet an onscreen diversity requirement, which is just one of several standards that could be met for eligibility.\n\nKey Facts\n\nChief Critics\n\nFox News host Tomi Lahren called the diversity requirements a “snake eating its own tail,” suggesting that “whiny, rich, white Hollywood liberals are going to be out of work” as these rules take effect. Some of the social media outrage was sparked because of viral misinformation: Popular right-wing Twitter account “End Wokeness” tweeted a screenshot of just Standard A (which has been retweeted thousands and viewed millions of times) and falsely stated that films must meet the onscreen diversity requirement to be eligible. Oscar winner Richard Dreyfuss blasted the diversity rules last month: “No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is,” he said. The New York Post quoted an anonymous director who called the requirements “ridiculous,” stating: “I’m for diversity, but to make you cast certain types of people if you want to get nominated? That makes the whole process contrived.” Some, including the New York Post, speculated that films like The Godfather would not win Best Picture today, with one social media user suggesting it is “too white & too male.”\n\nContra\n\nThe diversity requirements may seem strict on the surface but will likely be easy for films to satisfy, the New York Times reported in 2020, given that studios may already have internship programs and many women and gay men work in publicity. The first criteria of Standard A, which mandates one lead or significant supporting character must be from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group, would have been an easy bar to clear for predominantly white Best Picture nominees like La La Land and Joker, which featured Black actors John Legend and Zazie Beetz, respectively, in supporting roles, the Times reported. The new requirements drew some praise: Activist April Reign, who started the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, called it “another step forward toward equity and inclusion” but stated “we are far from there.” Film producer Axel Kuschevatzky tweeted he fully supports the new standards, which he called “important.”\n\nTangent\n\nThe Oscars and other award shows have faced criticism in recent years over what critics say is a lack of diversity among nominees. The British Academy Film Awards, Britain’s most prestigious film awards, announced similar diversity requirements in 2016 for two categories, Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. To be eligible for these categories, films must meet diversity requirements in two of four areas, which are similar to those later implemented by the Oscars: onscreen representation and themes, project leadership, industry access or opportunities for diversity in audience development. BAFTA later announced a significant overhaul to their awards process in 2020, after it nominated all white actors and all male directors, including mandating unconscious bias training for voters; adding more than 1,000 members to the voting pool, with a focus on underrepresented groups; and implementing a quota for women on the best director award long list.\n\nKey Background\n\nCompanies deemed “woke” have drawn online right-wing outrage one by one over the past several months. Conservatives boycotted Bud Light in April for sending transgender TikTok creator Dylan Mulvaney, known for documenting her gender transition, a customized can with her face on it, starting a wave of momentum that has targeted others like Nike (which also collaborated with Mulvaney), Target and Kohl’s. The most recent targets include country musician Garth Brooks, who angered conservatives by pledging to sell all beers, including Bud Light, at his new Nashville bar, and Mark Cuban, who offended conservative commentators and fellow Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary for calling wokeness “good business.” Conversely, Starbucks recently faced criticism from the left and self-congratulatory reactions from the right after a workers’ union, Starbucks Workers United, accused the company long known as an LGBTQ ally of banning stores from putting up Pride decorations. The company refuted this, stating no policy regarding Pride decorations had changed.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThis year’s Oscars ceremony made some strides toward diversity: Everything Everywhere All At Once, which stars a predominantly Asian cast, won a leading seven awards, including Best Picture, and Michelle Yeoh became the first Asian woman to win Best Actress. Four Asian actors in total were nominated, the most ever in a single year. The ceremony still garnered criticism, however, for snubbing Black actresses Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till), who many awards pundits considered locks for nominations.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Oscars’ New Diversity Rules Are Sweeping but Safe (The New York Times)\n\nGarth Brooks, Cracker Barrel Are The Latest Targets Of LGBTQ Culture Wars: Here Are All The Others—From Bud Light To Target (Forbes)"
