        "text": "Marking the tenth anniversary of SuperMeets this year, the final event of 2011 took place last Thursday at Boston’s Stuart Street Playhouse. In the second annual SuperMeet installment to take place in Boston, the organizers from Final Cut Pro User Group Network pulled out all the stops. They brought Oscar and BAFTA award-winning editor Walter Murch on board for a special discussion of film and sound editing, and also to touch on the merits of Final Cut Pro X in his first public appearance since its release.\n\nAt the forefront of the ‘New Hollywood’ school of filmmakers in the 1970’s which included George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, Murch has won acclaim for his work on such seminal films as American Graffiti, The Godfather: Part II, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, for which he won his first Academy Award. He went on to score an unprecedented double-Oscar win for film and sound editing on The English Patient.\n\n“I’m very excited to be part of another SuperMeet, especially in the present moment of great ferment, and in Boston where I have many family connections,” said Murch.\n\nJoe Maiella, VP of Sales and Crew Booking for Media Services, was on hand at the SuperMeet, which encompassed an entire evening of networking, talks, cocktails and appetizers. Media Services clients and friends received a special 50% off admission to the event.\n\n“This was a wonderful event with a very strong turnout of bright and passionate production professionals,” said Maiella. “I look forward to having a presence at more SuperMeets in 2012.”"
