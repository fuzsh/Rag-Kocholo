        "text": "Hollywood stars and filmmakers including Al Pacino, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert De Niro have paid tribute to the late Godfather actor James Caan, who died on Wednesday aged 82.\n\nCaan played Sonny Corleone in Coppola's classic 1972 gangster movie.\n\nPacino, who starred as Michael Corleone, described him as a \"great actor\" and a \"dear friend\".\n\nFord Coppola said Caan's work \"will never be forgotten\".\n\nIn a statement provided to the PA news agency, the director said: \"Jimmy was someone who stretched through my life longer and closer than any motion picture figure I've ever known.\"\n\n\"From those earlier times working together on [1969 film] The Rain People and throughout all the milestones of my life, his films and the many great roles he played will never be forgotten.\"\n\nHe added: \"He will always be my old friend from {New York neighbourhood] Sunnyside, my collaborator and one of the funniest people I've ever known.\"\n\nCaan, who born in the Bronx, appeared alongside Pacino, Marlon Brando, Diane Keaton and Robert De Niro in the memorable mobster movie.\n\nSpeaking of his \"fictional brother and lifelong friend\", Pacino said: \"It's hard to believe that he won't be in the world any more because he was so alive and daring.\n\n\"A great actor, a brilliant director and my dear friend,\" he added. \"I'm gonna miss him.\"\n\nDe Niro added he was \"very, very sad to hear about Jimmy's passing\".\n\nCaan's role as the hot tempered Sonny saw him receive his only Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor.\n\nHe reprised the role for a flashback scene in The Godfather Part II, with the director's son Roman Coppola playing Sonny as a boy in the 1920s scenes.\n\nTalia Shire, who played Caan's on-screen sister Connie Corleone told PA he was \"a good man, a kind man, a family man, and a wildly gifted man - whose great talent will always be loved and remembered.\"\n\n\"My prayers are with his family that he treasured so dearly,\" she added.\n\nJoe Mantegna, who appeared in the third film in the Godfather series, paid his respects over Twitter. \"One of the great gifts in being part of The Godfather family was becoming friends with James Caan. Rest In Peace Jimmy,\" he posted., external"
