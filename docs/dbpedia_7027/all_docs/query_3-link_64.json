        "text": "“The Godfather” soundtrack is still making us an offer we can’t refuse\n\nThe Godfather is film crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It was released in the United States in 1972 and it wins three of the main music awards of the year.\n\nThe Godfather won a Grammy and Bafta awards for the best soundtrack and a Golden globe award for the best film’s music of the year.\n\nThe Godfather is based on Mario Puzo’s bestseller and it goes from 1945 to 1955th decade when Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, is focused on the transition of The Godfather to his son Michael, played by Al Pacino, to become into a mafia boss.\n\nThe Godfather was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and it’s still the highest-grossing film of all times. The film was rewarded with several Oscar’s prizes as Best picture, Best actor (Marlon Brando) and Best adapted screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola).\n\nYears later, in 1990, it was selected for the National Film Registry on the Library of Congress and it was designated as “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant” and it was ranked the second-greatest film in America, behind Citizen Kane, by the American Film Institute.\n\nThe Godfather’s music was created, mainly, by Giovanni “´Nino” Rota. Rota was an Italian composer born in Milan the 3rd December 1911 and died in Rome the 10th April 1979. Rota was an Italian composer, pianist, conductor and academic who is best known for his works wits directors as Federico Fellini and Luchino Visconti. He is also well known for working with Coppola for The Godfather part I and the Godfather part II and he also composed the music of Franco Zeffirrelli’s Shakespeare films. Some of the Godfather’s secondary themes were also composed by Carmine Copopola, well known as Francis’ dad.\n\nIt seems that Rota’s goal was to go forward the film. On the first part of The Godfather, Rota tried to explain to the public Corleone’s family with music themes. The film was divided in a Principal theme, a Central theme and some Secondary themes.\n\n“Rota’s themes for the first film, however, are the lasting sounds of the franchise, played longingly on street corners around Europe for decades to follow.”\n\nWe will start analyzing the Central theme. It has wrongly related and named as a love, but it’s the Sicily’s theme actually. This theme sound when Michael Corneone is in Sicily and his dad, Vito, remains in America as The Godfather. The music sounds on every scene which is shown on Sicily, before also when Michael Corleone meets his wife, Apollonia Vitelli, for this reason we cannot name as love theme because it has been there before Vitelli.\n\n“The style of Rota’s work was important in merging the sonic sensibilities of Sicily and America, incorporating the flair of solo instrumentation native to the former region with the larger, symphonic tone of the latter”.\n\nMichael Corleone is the only character in the whole film, which has a personal theme. This theme is like another character because we can see how it rises, we see how it grows, we contemplate how it expands and how dead into another.\n\nMichael’s theme first appear is when his dad attacks by the rivals and it keeps appearing and sounding higher while Michael starts to go deeper at the mafia like night hospital scene and the preparation and execution of his first murder.\n\nAt this point we can talk about the Main theme of the film. This theme talks about two fundamental themes of the film, this one is the Godfather and family’s theme. It’s amazing how the same theme can be so different depending on the situation of the film where Rota’s put it.\n\nThis theme sounds a total of twelve times in the film and when talks about the Godfather, it’s a power, inflexible and ruthless music while when it’s played for the family it’s a sentimental and emotional sound. It is inherited by Michael after his dad’s death and it’s when we realize that it wasn’t Vito’s music, it was the Godfather song who has now been Michael.\n\nConclusion\n\nRota shows us that the soundtrack is essential on every film. However the soundtrack is composed following and exposing a meaning that you can realise almost without any video source because of it’s melody and meaning distributed in three themes that explains perfectly the feeling of family, mafia, Sicily, Michael’s evolution and the Godfather theme.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSources"
