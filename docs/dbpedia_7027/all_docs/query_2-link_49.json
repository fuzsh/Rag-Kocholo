        "text": "by Cláudio Alves\n\nMany consider the Oscars to be the highest honor any filmmaker can achieve. However, as an American institution, they've favored Hollywood fare over world cinema. In other words, for all their aspirations, AMPAS is fairly provincial in taste and the composition of their voting body. Strides are made every year to change that, but it'll take a long time before the Academy Awards shake off the \"local\" allegations. That said, when the voters expand their horizons, one should celebrate it. This year, they certainly looked past Anglophone American-centric cinema, honoring five different non-English-language features…\n\nTo put things into perspective, I looked for the last time as many non-Anglophone films took awards on Oscar night. You have to go back to 2006, and even then, the 79th Academy Awards only passed muster thanks to the shorts categories. For a more polyglot feature selection, one has to return to the 70s and 60s, when world cinema was having a moment of uncommon power against mainstream American culture. Indeed, thanks to those decades, most of the Oscar categories already have some international flavor among their Pantheon of victors. Think of the Italian boom of the early 60s, for example.\n\nLet's celebrate the achievements of non-English-language films at this year's Oscars! The Boy and the Heron is only the second non-English-language film to take Best Animated Feature after Miyazaki's Spirited Away. It's also only the second 2D animation to win a prize that normally values CG and stop-motion techniques above hand-drawn efforts. While 20 Days in Mariupol's Documentary win and Anatomy of a Fall's Original Screenplay are less unique, they're worthy of applause. Also, for the record, while Triet's film has plenty of English dialigue, NEON insists that the majority of the text is in French - not sure I believe them, but that's another matter altogether. With The Zone of Interest's Best Sound win and Godzilla Minus One's Visual Effects victory, only three categories remain, with no non-English-speaking film among its champions.\n\nWe still need some linguistic variety in the supporting acting categories and Adapted Screenplay.\n\nConsidering those categories' histories, one wonders what nominees could have possibly made history as their first non-English-speaking winners. Valentina Cortese in Best Supporting Actress is an obvious option considering how much that year's winner – Ingrid Bergman in Murder on the Orient Express – made clear she thought the Italian thespian should have taken the prize. However, I can't think of a single possibility for Best Supporting Actor. Regarding Adapted Screenplay, Drive My Car would have made a sublime winner, though All Quiet on the Western Front was probably closer last season. Going further back in Oscar history, we find even worthier nominees. Think about Rome, Open City, The Bicycle Thief, or Z, among others.\n\nAre you excited that AMPAS is becoming more international, or would you prefer that the Oscars remain focused on Hollywood productions?\n\nI have mixed feelings about this but what I find mostly pathetic is the fact that the audience are sooo Oscar depending to get close to cinema, no matter if is to discover USA or international films\n\nThe possitive part of the inclussion of international cinema is the fact that the audience gonna be more interested in films around the world. The negative part: that interest gonna be exclusively to nominated films as it happens actually\n\nHonestly I would prefer that Oscar could it be local because that would help to put in the conversation more indie films from the US (and avoid the necessity of the US to conceive themselves as the center of the world)\n\nAnd it would be terrific if that interest for Oscar could it be spread to local awards from different countries but, I don't see how the industry could help to catch the attention of viewers to do that"
