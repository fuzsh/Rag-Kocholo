This is the War Room…”\n\nSaturday’s Underground Cinema selections explore dystopia and the darker side of the human psyche, and where better to begin than a 60th anniversary screening of Dr Strangelove?

This cult sensation remains a subject of debate to this day, but it still packs a punch and remains a visceral viewing experience a quarter of a century on.\n\nBook Now\n\nThe grandfather of B-movies is big on bugs\n\nSunday’s matinee screening is Them!, one of the first ‘nuclear monster’ films of the 1950s, and the first film to use insects as the monster. Seven decades on, this Oscar-nominated creature feature remains a highlight of B-movie history.\n\nBook Now\n\nThis creature feature breaks ground and will leave you legless\n\nSunday afternoon at the Underground Cinema starts with a double bill of films where monstrous worms steal the limelight…! First up is the comedy-horror Tremors, which sees Kevin Bacon and friends do battle against vicious “Graboids” in the Sierra Nevada outback. Given the Graboids’ subterranean nature, we’re inviting you to leave the surface far behind and face them head on!\n\nBook Now\n\nDavid Lynch + Frank Herbert = the definition of cult cinema\n\nOur double bill of films featuring monstrous worms continues with David Lynch’s adaptation of Dune, one of the most iconic sci-fi novels ever written. With the new films reviving interest in Frank Herbert’s magnum opus, revisit the original screen adaptation for its 40th anniversary - just remember to walk without rhythm, and it won’t attract the worms…\n\nBook Now\n\nCan you learn to dance the Magic Dance before the clock strikes thirteen?\n\nIn what has become Underground Cinema tradition, watch Jim Henson’s magical musical adventure Labyrinth at Redcliffe Caves. Get ready to dance the magic dance, and follow Sarah deep into the Goblin King’s realm where nothing can be taken at face value…\n\nBook Now\n\nThese sinister Salem sisters are doing it for themselves\n\nWe’re returning to Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol’s very own necropolis, with two days of spine-tingling cinema! Our first film at Arnos Vale this October is a firm festival favourite, the wonderfully witchy Hocus Pocus.

The acclaimed author adapted her own short story for the big screen in this darkest of dark fantasy tales; With its eerie atmosphere, striking imagery, and atmospheric score, this critically-acclaimed film is a must-see for fans of the genre.\n\nBook Now\n\nWitches have broomsticks, but in this 80s comedy-horror, vampires have motorbikes\n\nDue to massive demand in 2023, we’re bringing the vampire bikers sensation The Lost Boys back to the big screen this October.

Ingrid Bergman’s Oscar-winning performance is one of her finest, and the film remains so infamous that it has leant its name to the 21st Century term ‘gaslighting’. We’ll be pairing this extraordinary film with wines inspired by the characters and cast.\n\nBook Now\n\nAll’s not as it seems in this wine flight fit for the master of mystery…\n\nOur weekend of vintage psychological thrillers at Averys concludes with a 70th anniversary screening of Hitchcock’s timeless classic Rear Window.

We hope so!\n\nBook Now\n\nExplore the origins of horror cinema, with a very special live organ recital\n\nJoin us at St Mary Redcliffe this October for a very special anthology screening of some of the earliest horror films ever made.

It’s spawned a juggernaut of an ongoing franchise, but the fiendishly simple concept of the original is still yet to be topped - you’ll be watching through your fingers and counting your toes…!\n\nBook Now\n\nThe seminal 50s sci-fi thriller that got every body talking\n\nOur discounted Matinee Screenings of vintage horror return to the Caves on Saturday and Sunday mornings, starting with the seminal sci-fi chiller Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. Based on Jack Finney’s novel - which turns 70 this year - and shot in a film noir style, this 50s classic is both a gripping extraterrestrial thriller and a wry commentary on McCarthyism, and remains as eerie as ever…\n\nBook Now\n\nThey’ll be expecting you… and this October, so will we!\n\nSaturday’s programme at Redcliffe Caves is dedicated to 1984, a fantastic year for cult classic horror releases, so we’re celebrating some 40th birthdays - starting with Gremlins! This cult comedy-horror has its own wicked spin on the festive spirit, making it one of the few films that works well at Halloween or Christmas (or both, if you’re like us!).\n\nBook Now\n\nDrew Barrymore blazes a trail as a preternatural young prodigy\n\nThe double bill of 1984 Stephen King adaptations continues at Redciiffe Caves. Firestarter is full of searing pyrotechnical special effects, and a young Drew Barrymore provides a memorable turn in this adaptation of one of King’s more thought-provoking sci-fi chillers, which was surely a major influence on Stranger Things.\n\nBook Now\n\nIn Gatlin, Nebraska, you reap more than you sow\n\nOur day of 1984 horror films continues with a double bill of Stephen King adaptations. Children Of The Corn is a lo-fi, gruesome tale featuring some of the creepiest children in the horror movie canon; add in a pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton, some beautifully unsettling scenery and some subtle political commentary, and you’ve got a true cult classic!\n\nBook Now\n\nIt’s pronounced “Fronkensteen”, actually - common mistake…\n\nwe’re thrilled to be concluding our trio of Halloween-themed Vintage Screenings with a 50th anniversary screening of Mel Brooks’ frightfully funny comedy-horror spoof. We’ll be pairing it with a flight of wines from Eastern Europe, showcasing countries and varieties that are at last beginning to earn their rightful reputation in the international scene.\n\nBook Now\n\nThere is no witty caption. Only Zuul.\n\nThe day of 1984 horror classics at Redcliffe Caves continues with Ghostbusters. The franchise is still going strong four decades on, but nothing tops the original - strap on your proton packs and prepare for the Stay-Puftapocalypse!\n\nBook Now\n\n40 years on, and we’re still not truly ready for Freddy\n\nWe’re rounding off our day of 1984 films with a late night screening of one of the most iconic horror films of all time, A Nightmare On Elm Street. The franchise may have put its instantly recognisable villain through the injustices of numerous inferior sequels (and THAT novelty rap) but Freddy Kreuger’s delightfully creepy debut still has the power to haunt your dreams.\n\nBook Now\n\nWhen you just can’t shake off that lingering feline of dread…\n\nFor Sunday’s Matinee Screening at Horror In The Caves, we’re thrilled to present a special showing of Cat People, kindly licensed by the BFI. This 2K digital restoration brings out the eerie beauty of this creature feature noir’s stylish shadows and chiaroscuro lighting; it’s a moody and suspenseful alternative to the monster movie shtick of the 1940s, with one of the most celebrated jump scares in history…!\n\nBook Now\n\nHave you met Mr Babadook? Come to the Caves - you’ll see him if you look\n\nSomehow, it’s already time to celebrate the 10th birthday of The Babadook! This harrowing psychological chiller was part of our very first Horror In The Caves programme way back in March 2016, and we’re excited to bring it back to the Caves for an anniversary screening. Top hats off to first time director Jennifer Kent for this astonishing debut, which is one of the creepiest films of the century so far…\n\nBook Now\n\n“Once you see it, you can never forget. Once it sees you, you can never escape”\n\nJoin us for a 20th anniversary screening of The Grudge in Redcliffe Caves this October. Japanese filmmaker Takashi Shimizu directed this English-language remake of his 2002 hit Ju-On: The Grudge, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Bill Pullman; it’s a deeply unnerving watch with some of the most iconic imagery of early 2000s horror cinema!\n\nBook Now\n\nCelebrate half a century of one of the most infamous films ever made\n\nIf you’re feeling particularly brave this Halloween, enter the Caves for a very special 50th anniversary screening of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, with a stunning digital restoration showcasing this infamous cult classic in all its gory glory. It’s a must-see for any horror aficionado - and for those of you thinking that a 50 year old film can’t be all that bad, don’t say we didn’t warn you!\n\nBook Now\n\nThe tension is as relentless as the antagonist in this 21st Century nightmare\n\nAnother modern classic celebrating its 10th anniversary this year is the haunting It Follows. It’s a wickedly simple premise, executed with aplomb and has a truly nightmarish aura that will linger long in the memory. With a sequel only recently confirmed, and lead actress Taika Monroe currently starring in occult chiller Longlegs, now is the perfect time to catch it - before it catches you…\n\nBook Now\n\nWhere better to watch a cave-based horror film than in a cave complex…?\n\nDue to massive demand, we’ve added an extra screening of The Descent. Tickets always go fast for this, but watching it in the Caves is a truly immersive, and terrifying, experience, and possibly unsuitable for anyone with severe claustrophobia. It’s the ultimate way to experience Horror In The Caves – but you have been warned!\n\nKenneth Branagh’s in grave danger in this electrifying adaptation\n\nIn the build-up to Halloween, we present a 30th anniversary screening of Kenneth Branagh’s blood-soaked adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. This grisly retelling of a true horror classic, produced by Francis Ford Coppola, is one of the more faithful adaptations of the source material, and we’re delighted to screen this restoration from the original negatives in a suitably atmospheric venue this October!\n\nBook Now\n\nThis scathing satire of military might takes you to the heart of the ugly bugs’ crawl\n\nJust in time for Halloween, we’re bringing a double bill of 90s nastiness to the Planetarium, starting with the bombastic Starship Troopers. The irony of Paul Verhoeven’s startling send-up of fascism went over some contemporary critics’ heads, but its cult reputation as an action-packed sci-fi satire endures. Would you like to know more? Then enlist in the brutal battle against the bugs…\n\nBook Now\n\nFor 9-year-old Cole Sear, not every gift is a blessing\n\nOur Halloween season continues with a milestone anniversary screening of one of the few horror movies to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, The Sixth Sense. M. Night Shyamalan’s breakthrough film remains an arresting watch, 25 years on from its release - it’s got chills, thrills and twists that make it an instant pop culture classic!\n\nBook Now\n\nStar Trek meets The Shining in this chilling cult horror\n\nJust in time for Halloween, we’re bringing a double bill of 90s nastiness to the Planetarium, concluding with the cult horror Event Horizon. Paul W.S. Anderson’s “haunted house in space” movie horrified studio execs with its disturbing imagery; if you’ve never seen this delightfully creepy gem, you’re in for a night that will linger long in the memory…!\n\nBook Now\n\nRounding off Spooktober: our annual screening of the film that defines ‘cult classic’!\n\nWe’re heading to The Station this Halloween for a screening of the film that defines ‘cult classic’!

Need we ask whether you’re shivering with antici –\n\n– pation?\n\nBook Now\n\nJoin us for a celebration of innovation at Aerospace Bristol\n\nWe’re bringing another British icon to Aerospace Bristol this November with a screening of The Italian Job.

Take your seat in this beautiful venue and enjoy the great detective’s greatest challenge yet: to deliver a best man speech for Watson…!\n\nBook Now\n\nThe grandfather of all romcoms, and one of the finest of all time\n\nThis November, we’re celebrating the 90th anniversary of one of the all-time great comedies, It Happened One Night. Frank Capra’s screwball romcom prototype is one of only three films to date to win ‘The Big Five’ at the Oscars – Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress – so we’re pairing it with wines from around the world that have won a similarly impressive number of awards and accolades.\n\nBook Now\n\n“The greatest British film of all time” (BFI) is as haunting as ever\n\nOur Autumn Vintage Screenings continue with the film noir classic The Third Man, which turns 75 this year. In tribute to this film’s moody Vienna setting, this tasting will focus on Austrian wines to enjoy alongside this seminal piece of cinema history.\n\nBook Now\n\nDuncan Jones has really made the grade with this space oddity\n\nJust in time for its 15th anniversary, we’re screening Moon at the Planetarium this November. Sam Rockwell stars in Duncan Jones' moody, unsettling debut feature; it’s a gripping watch, made all the more impressive by the film’s comparatively low budget, proving you don’t it doesn’t cost the earth (surely “moon”? - Ed.) to make top quality sci-fi!\n\nBook Now\n\nThis gloriously madcap misadventure is barn-raisingly good fun\n\nThe Oscar-winning musical comedy Seven Brides For Seven Brothers turns 70 this year; it features some stunning choreography, including \"one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen.” In honour of the eponymous Pontipee brothers, we’re focussing on wines from around the world made with multiple grape varieties, showcasing how producers carefully balance their blends to create signature styles.\n\nBook Now\n\nReality is a thing of the past - 1999, to be precise\n\nWe’re excited to present a 25th anniversary screening of the seminal 90s sci-fi action film, The Matrix!
