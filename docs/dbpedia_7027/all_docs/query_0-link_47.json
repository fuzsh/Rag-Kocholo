        "text": "Door opening: 18:00\n\nDj Performance\n\nScreening: 21:00\n\nThe Godfather Part II\n\n1974 / USA / Color / 200'\n\nEnglish, Italian, Spanish, Latin, Sicilian; with Turkish subtitles\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola | Producer: Francis Ford Coppola | Screenplay: Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo | Cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, John Cazale | Music: Nino Rota | Cinematography: Gordon Willis | Editing: Peter Zinner, Barry Malkin, Richard Marks\n\nFestivals & Awards: Academy Awards (Oscar) - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Score, Best Art Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay (1975), Directors Guild of America Awards - Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures (1975), Writers Guild of America Awards - Best Adapted Screenplay (1975), BAFTA Awards - Best Actor (1976)\n\nConsidered by critics as one of the greatest sequels in cinema history, “The Godfather Part II” is the second installment of the epic saga. It pushes the power of the first film to its limits. The film skillfully weaves parallel narratives set in 1917 and the 1930s, depicting the youth and rise of Vito Corleone in the world of organized crime, while also focusing on his son Michael Corleone’s struggle to maintain his power. Delving deep into the inner worlds of both characters, the film carries the traces of the past into the present, exposing the dark side of the American dream. With themes revolving around family bonds, betrayal, the thirst for power, and the brutality of the criminal underworld, “The Godfather Part II” progresses with a complex and clever screenplay, captivating audiences with the mesmerizing power of cinematic art. The dazzling compositions created through the dance of light make each scene resemble a painting, while the Oscar-winning music by Nino Rota further enhances the atmosphere. Another triumph of the film is its magnificent ensemble cast. Al Pacino, in the role that defined his career, portrays Michael Corleone, bringing to life a man grappling with his ruthless and dark sides down to the smallest details. Robert De Niro, who plays the young Vito Corleone, delivers a performance that is crowned with an Oscar, serving as a masterclass in acting."
