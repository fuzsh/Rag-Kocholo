        "text": "Titles 11–100\n\n(in order of release)\n\nMetropolis (1927), shot by Karl Freund, ASC; Günther Rittau\n\nNapoleon (1927), shot by Leonce-Henri Burel, Jules Kruger, Joseph-Louis Mundwiller\n\nSunrise (1927), shot by Charles Rosher Sr., ASC; Karl Struss, ASC\n\nGone with the Wind (1939), shot by Ernest Haller, ASC\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939), shot by Harold Rosson, ASC (more here)\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (1940), shot by Gregg Toland, ASC\n\nHow Green Was My Valley (1941), shot by Arthur C. Miller, ASC\n\nCasablanca (1942), shot by Arthur Edeson, ASC (more here)\n\nSteven Shaw, ASC: There is one moment in Casablanca when Ingrid Bergman walks into the bar late at night, and it’s closed, and Bogart is there, [wallowing in] the blues, drinking whiskey — and she asks her former lover to give her and her husband a pass to get out of Casablanca and away from the Germans. That close-up, that moment, is, to me, the most beautiful close-up ever shot — it’s beyond beautiful.\n\nI love Casablanca. The trickeries of the lighting — the airport that doesn’t exist. It’s on stage. You feel the airport’s presence, because they’re panning a spotlight through the background. That airport had such a dynamic emotional element to it, and you feel the panic of not being able to escape, and it’s just a spotlight! It’s like magic. It’s one of the great lessons in lighting.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons (1942), shot by Stanley Cortez, ASC\n\nBlack Narcissus (1947), shot by Jack Cardiff, BSC\n\nThe Bicycle Thief (1948), shot by Carlo Montuori\n\nThe Red Shoes (1948), shot by Jack Cardiff, BSC\n\nThe Third Man (1949), shot by Robert Krasker, BSC\n\nAlexander Gruszynski, ASC: I love The Third Man. The camera angles and the lighting are the crucial components of how the story is told. If you take away the visual elements, the story wouldn’t be as powerful — and I think this is a requirement for a milestone of cinematography. This is where all the kudos go to the film’s cinematographer, Robert Krasker, BSC. The famous scene when we first see Orson Welles’ character, Harry Lime, drowned in shadow — you don’t see his face at all, just a pair of shoes and the cat. Then all of a sudden, a neighbor in the building turns on the light and we see Harry Lime for the first time. It’s told with the lighting and the camera. The Third Man is the gold standard for film-noir cinema. It’s the most important film, I would say, in the whole noir genre.\n\nRashomon (1950) shot by Kazuo Miyagawa\n\nSunset Boulevard (1950), shot by John Seitz, ASC (more here)\n\nOn the Waterfront (1954), shot by Boris Kaufman, ASC\n\nSeven Samurai (1954), shot by Asakazu Nakai\n\nThe Night of the Hunter (1955), shot by Stanley Cortez, ASC (more here)\n\nThe Searchers (1956), shot by Winton C. Hoch, ASC\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), shot by Jack HIldyard, BSC\n\nTouch of Evil (1958), shot by Russell Metty, ASC\n\nVertigo (1958), shot by Robert Burks, ASC (more here)\n\nNorth by Northwest (1959), shot by Robert Burks, ASC (more here)\n\nBreathless (1960), shot by Raoul Coutard\n\nLast Year at Marienbad (1961), shot by Sacha Vierny\n\n8 ½ (1963), shot by Gianni Di Venanzo\n\nHud (1963), shot by James Wong Howe, ASC (more here)Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), shot by Gilbert Taylor, BSC\n\nI Am Cuba (Soy Cuba; 1964), shot by Sergei Urusevsky (more here)\n\nNatasha Braier, ASC, ADF: There are shots in I Am Cuba that made cinematic history, and the most famous of these is the funeral procession [for a student who had joined the revolution]. I think it [epitomizes] everything that is amazing about this film — how they can do acrobatics with the camera and [accomplish] great technical achievements for that time, but in service to the film’s language, and to a message, and in a way that actually serves the story.\n\nThey didn’t have cranes or drones, yet the camera elevates and does all of these acrobatics. They had to create this whole system, where the operator wore a vest with a lot of hooks, and [crewmembers] were hooking him and unhooking him, and lifting him, and making him fly — with very simple means. The sequence starts with the camera on ground level, at a wide angle only a few inches from a young woman, so you really feel like you’re at this ‘human’ level. But then the camera starts to lift up vertically, and then horizontally to enter the third floor of a tobacco factory. It goes through the interior of that floor, and as if the shot wasn’t spectacular enough — especially for the time — the camera travels through [another] window and flies over the street, where you see a top shot of the procession. You’re now three stories high, and you see hundreds of people around the body, walking through the street, and the camera keeps flying above them.\n\nTo do all of that in one single take — on film, in the 1960s in Cuba, with such limited technology — is amazing, but it’s not just a technical stunt. The film’s language, acrobatics and camera stunts come together in this shot to tell that story. It touches all the elements that it needs to touch during the shot, going from the individual, to the collective, to the group of workers, to the big collective, which is almost like a wide shot of Cuba itself. It doesn’t make any sense to have a spectacular shot if it doesn’t have a meaning and a purpose behind it.\n\nDoctor Zhivago (1965), shot by Freddie Young, BSC\n\nThe Battle of Algiers (1966), shot by Marcello Gatti\n\nChris Menges, ASC, BSC: The Battle of Algiers is a startling and brilliant film about the Algerian war for independence from France. Shot in black-and-white, there are the most amazing re-created scenes of the struggle in the Casbah, the citadel of Algiers, with thousands of extras. There are scenes in which the tension is so powerful, scenes so moving, that you want to cry out. It is filmmaking at its greatest.\n\nCinematographer Marcello Gatti wheels the handheld camera to catch the moment. [Director] Gillo Pontecorvo lets the shots develop, never using the classical-editing reverse-shot technique. It’s inspired newsreel style: in black-and-white, with documentary-type editing to add to its sense of historical authenticity. The technique is enthralling.\n\nPontecorvo said, ‘My idea was to give the audience the impression that it was watching a documentary as events happened. We wanted our film to look like newsreel that looked grainy. Using a handheld camera let us spontaneously catch interesting faces and action.’\n\nA superb film — it lives!\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), shot by Haskell Wexler, ASC\n\nCool Hand Luke (1967), shot by Conrad Hall, ASC\n\nThe Graduate (1967), shot by Robert Surtees, ASC\n\nMichael Goi, ASC, ISC: I saw The Graduate when I was 8 years old, and I couldn’t believe how it made me feel. I realized ultimately that it was the cinematography that did that. Robert Surtees, ASC immediately became my hero. He had been the premier cameraman at MGM, had shot big movies like Ben-Hur, and when technology was changing, when new lightweight cameras were coming, he embraced it — and he worked with all the new, young directors when he was in his 70s.\n\nIn Cold Blood (1967), shot by Conrad Hall, ASC (more here)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West (1968), shot by Tonino Delli Colli, AIC (more here)\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), shot by Conrad Hall, ASC\n\nThe Wild Bunch (1969), shot by Lucien Ballard, ASC\n\nA Clockwork Orange (1971), shot by John Alcott, BSC (more here)\n\nKlute (1971), shot by Gordon Willis, ASC\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971), shot by Robert Surtees, ASC\n\nMcCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), shot by Vilmos Zsigmond, ASC, HSC\n\nMat Beck, ASC: In terms of my all-time favorite movies, in which the look and sound of the movie carry me into another world, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is such an extraordinary piece of work. When I first saw it, I just loved it — but I didn’t appreciate, as much as I later came to, how beautiful the photography was, and how important it was. It was such an otherworldly experience, and yet so real. It was like an extremely real dream, so I wasn’t thinking too much about how they’d gone about doing it. That movie is a masterpiece, and the photography is of a piece with it, creating a world.\n\nCabaret (1972), shot by Geoffery Unsworth, BSC\n\nLast Tango in Paris (1972), shot by Vittorio Storaro, ASC, AIC\n\nThe Exorcist (1973), shot by Owen Roizman, ASC (more here)\n\nChinatown (1974), shot by John A. Alonzo, ASC (more here)\n\nThe Godfather: Part II (1974), shot by Gordon Willis, ASC\n\nBarry Lyndon (1975), shot by John Alcott, BSC (more here)\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), shot by Haskell Wexler, ASC\n\nAll the President's Men (1976), shot by Gordon Willis, ASC (more here)\n\nTaxi Driver (1976), shot by Michael Chapman, ASC\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), shot by Vilmos Zsigmond, ASC, HSC\n\nSteven Poster, ASC: Close Encounters of the Third Kind [featured] the largest set ever built indoors for a movie, and Vilmos [Zsigmond, ASC, HSC] — who was a romantic realist, in my opinion — photographed it with such a sure hand, and in a way that no matter what was happening on the set, no matter how difficult the situation was, he pushed forward and did a remarkable job of telling that story. It had a personal quality that, for a movie of that size and complexity, was unprecedented. It was an extraordinary feat.\n\nThe Duellists (1977), shot by Frank Tidy, BSC\n\nThe Deer Hunter (1978), shot by Vilmos Zsigmond, ASC, HSC (more here)\n\nAlien (1979), shot by Derek Vanlint, CSC (more here, here and here)\n\nAll that Jazz (1979), shot by Giuseppe Rotunno, ASC, AIC\n\nBeing There (1979), shot by Caleb Deschanel, ASC\n\nThe Black Stallion (1979), shot by Caleb Deschanel, ASC\n\nManhattan (1979), shot by Gordon Willis, ASC\n\nThe Shining (1980), shot by John Alcott, BSC (more here)\n\nChariots of Fire (1981), shot by David Watkin, BSC\n\nDas Boot (1981), shot by Jost Vacano, ASC\n\nReds (1981), shot by Vittorio Storaro, ASC, AIC\n\nFanny and Alexander (1982), shot by Sven Nykvist, ASC\n\nThe Right Stuff (1983), shot by Caleb Deschanel, ASC\n\nAmadeus (1984), shot by Miroslav Ondricek, ASC, ACK\n\nThe Natural (1984), shot by Caleb Deschanel, ASC\n\nParis, Texas (1984), shot by Robby Müller, NSC, BVK\n\nBrazil (1985), shot by Roger Pratt, BSC\n\nThe Mission (1986), shot by Chris Menges, ASC, BSC\n\nEmpire of the Sun (1987), shot by Allen Daviau, ASC\n\nThe Last Emperor (1987), shot by Vittorio Storaro, ASC, AIC\n\nWings of Desire (1987), shot by Henri Alekan\n\nMississippi Burning (1988), shot by Peter Biziou, BSC\n\nJFK (1991), shot by Robert Richardson, ASC\n\nRaise the Red Lantern (1991), shot by Fei Zhao\n\nUnforgiven (1992), shot by Jack Green, ASC (more here)\n\nBaraka (1992), shot by Ron Fricke\n\nSchindler's List (1993), shot by Janusz Kaminski\n\nSearching For Bobby Fischer (1993), shot by Conrad Hall, ASC\n\nCharles Minsky, ASC: From the film’s beginning, Conrad Hall, ASC’s cinematography in Searching for Bobby Fischer is warm and intimate. His use of long lenses enhances this interior, personal story and invites the viewer into the complicated relationships between the characters. The camera is always seeking the heart of the story through the heart of the 7-year old boy at its center. Continually moving in and out of the shadows, the close-ups of the boy, his parents and his teachers reveal the boy’s search for a hero to believe in. The camera doesn’t turn away. Through the boy’s eyes, it makes us confront ourselves. From the beginning close-up of the chessboard, reflected in a pair of sunglasses, to the ending close-up of two 7-year-old boys walking arm in arm away from camera, it maintains a personal and intimate involvement in the boy’s life. It makes us understand that the boy is only a boy.\n\nTrois Coulieurs: Bleu (Three Colours: Blue; 1993), shot by Slawomir Idziak, PSC\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1994), shot by Roger Deakins, ASC, BSC (more here)\n\nSeven (1995), shot by Darius Khondji, ASC, AFC (more here and here)\n\nThe English Patient (1996), shot by John Seale, ASC, ACS\n\nL. A. Confidential (1997), shot by Dante Spinotti, ASC, AIC (more here)\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998), shot by Janusz Kaminski (more here and here)\n\nThe Thin Red Line (1998), shot by John Toll, ASC (more here)\n\nAmerican Beauty (1999), shot by Conrad Hall, ASC\n\nThe Matrix (1999), shot by Bill Pope, ASC (more here)\n\nIn the Mood for Love (2000), shot by Christopher Doyle, HKSC\n\nAs more related content regarding the titles on this list are added to our Historicals section, we'll continue to update this article with new links."
