        "text": "Country: United States\n\nLanguage: English, Italian, Spanish\n\nThe 1970s: Pushing the Boundaries\n\nA Film Center retrospective on the most groundbreaking films to come out of the 1970s.\n\nSee more Pushing the Boundaries\n\nAbout the film:\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola is an influential film director, producer, and screenwriter. Along with other New Hollywood filmmakers, his unconventional ideas challenged contemporary filmmaking and helped shape American cinema. In 1969, Coppola and George Lucas founded American Zoetrope, an innovative, independent film production company based in San Francisco that has produced feature films for directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Akira Kurosawa, Wim Wenders, Godfrey Reggio, and Coppola’s daughter Sofia.\n\nAmong his own projects, Coppola co-wrote the script for Franklin J. Schaffner’s Patton (1970). He then revolutionized the gangster genre with The Godfather (1972). He won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for The Conversation (1974) followed by his vivid Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now (1979), making him one of only nine filmmakers to have won the award twice. His other features include The Rain People (1969), The Outsiders (1983), Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992), and The Rainmaker (1997). Among other accolades, Coppola has won five Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA). The Godfather Part II (1974) became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nSee our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR SUPPORT\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
