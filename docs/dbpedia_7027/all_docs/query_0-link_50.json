        "text": "1. Robert De Niro: A Master of Deception\n\nRobert De Niro, nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Killers of the Flower Moon, is not a stranger to the world of wax or the Academy Awards. With several figures spread across Madame Tussauds globally, the Hollywood location showcases him in character from the movie Casino.\n\nDe Niro's deceptive performance as the cunning oil mogul William King Hale is a tour de force and is a must-see for any De Niro fan. De Niro's lengthy career in Hollywood has earned him eight Academy Award nominations, two of which he won Oscars for playing Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II (1974) and Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull (1980). He is also a six-time BAFTA Award nominee, and an eight-time Golden Globe Award nominee, and a multi-wax figure sensation!\n\n2. Ryan Gosling: Will His Performance Be \"Kenough\"?\n\nRyan Gosling, nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his lively performance in \"Barbie, has taken Hollywood by storm for his vibrant portrayal of Beach Ken. With several wax figures in multiple Madame Tussauds locations, fans can expect the newest wax figure to join the Madame Tussauds family at Madame Tussauds Hollywood this winter.\n\nRed carpet expert and Hollywood leading man, Ryan Gosling is no stranger to awards shows. Gosling was nominated for Best Actor in 2007 for his role in Half Nelson and again in 2017 for his musical and acting role in La La Land.\n\n3. Robert Downey Jr.: Iron Man in Wax\n\nKnown for his dramatic character roles, Robert Downey Jr. is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Oppenheimer where he plays Rear Admiral Lewis Strauss, a retired Naval officer and high-ranking member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission during World War II. Critics have said Downey Jr.'s performance is \"cool, calculated, and precise, with subtle hints of furious self-absorption that make his character truly chilling.\"\n\nWhile his on-screen character in Oppenheimer is manipulative and cunning, it strays far from his character in Marvel's Iron Man series, which is how his wax figure is styled at Madame Tussauds Hollywood. Perhaps fans will enjoy the chance to take a selfie with charismaticTony Stark a little more than the evil villain in Christian Nolan's atomic bomb masterpieces.\n\n4. Martin Scorsese: A Directorial Genius in Wax\n\nMartin Scorsese, nominated for Best Director for Killers of the Flower Moon, is not just behind the camera; he's also immortalized in wax at Madame Tussauds Hollywood and New York. His figures showcase the brilliance of a director bringing true stories to life on the big screen, making them a must-see for movie enthusiasts.\n\nHis ability to inspire awe in movie goers across generations has earned him 14 Academy Award nominations, nine of which were for directing. In 2006, he won the Academy Award for Best Director for The Departed - will 2024 be the year he reclaims this prestige?\n\nMake Sure to Tune In\n\nAs the excitement builds towards the 96th Academy Awards on Sunday, March 20, 2024, at 4:00 PM PT, make your way to Madame Tussauds Hollywood. Immerse yourself in the glamour of Hollywood, and who knows, maybe one of these wax celebrities will be taking home an Oscar! Don't miss the chance to witness the magic of both the silver screen and the wax world come to life in the heart of Tinseltown.\n\nGET YOUR TICKET TODAY"
