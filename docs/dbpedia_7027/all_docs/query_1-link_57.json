        "text": "The Wild Bunch\n\nYear Released: 1969 The Wild Bunch is an American western that first hit theaters in 1969. The film, which stars William Holden, Robert Ryan, and Ernest Borgnine, is known for being controversial for its time. These days, graphic violence is pretty much expected in certain types of films. But in the late 60’s, it was just starting to emerge.\n\nSam Peckinpah directed and co-wrote the revisionist movie, which was deemed as “culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant,” by the U.S National Film Registry in 1999. Now, it’ll be forever preserved in the Library of Congress as such.\n\nThe Searchers\n\nYear Released: 1956 Another Western, The Searchers came out in the mid 1950’s, starring John Wayne. The film has high ratings on nearly every movie critic website, including Rotten Tomatoes, Roger Ebert, and IMDb. Directed by John Ford, it follows Wayne, playing a Civil War veteran on the hunt for his abducted niece. Of course, he’s actually hunting her, not trying to rescue her like one may assume.\n\nOf all of the Western films that Wayne starred in, this one is known for being one of, if not his absolute best. It’s both influenced and made an appearance in several other films and television shows, including Martin Scorsese’s 1967 film, Who’s That Knocking at My Door, in which two of the characters have a conversation about it.\n\nNotorious\n\nYear Released: 1946 Well, we’re slipping back in time as we progress down the list, and right now, we’ve landed in the 1940s. In Alfred Hitchcock’s heyday, he released plenty of films that would be remembered as classics, and Notorious is one of them.\n\nThe film stars Carey Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Raines, and falls into the spy film noir category. The film was chosen to be preserved by the Library of Congress in 2006.\n\nBlack Narcissus\n\nYear Released: 1947 Around the same time as Notorious was released, Black Narcissus came out, as well. The film dives into the story of a small group of nuns on a goodwill mission on top of a mountain in the Himalayas. But the natives aren’t thrilled to have them there trying to mess with their way of life, and conflict between the groups (and within them) ensues.\n\nThe film has great reviews across the board and comes very highly recommended from several critics and publications. Although it’s been on the market for seven decades, it continues to impress new generations to this day.\n\nUnforgiven\n\nYear Released: 1992 Clint Eastwood stars in this 1992 film that he also produces and directs. He ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Director and being nominated for Best Actor. Aside from Eastwood, the cast was full of big names including Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman.\n\nThe film saw four Academy Award wins in total, including Best Picture and Best Film Editing. It was the third Western to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture and spent three weeks as the Number one film in North America upon its release.\n\nStrangers on a Train\n\nYear Released: 1951 Another one of Alfred Hitchcock’s films, Strangers on a Train has a near perfect rating on every major review platform, with a 4/4 on Roger Ebert and a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film follows two men who meet on a train and hatch a deadly plan to murder someone in each of their lives.\n\nAside from the suspense that Hitchcock is famous for, the film is also full of his unique camera angles. The film’s cinematographer, Robert Burks, was nominated for the Oscar for Best Cinematography, while Hitchcock was nominated for an award from the Directors Guild of America and the National Board of Review.\n\nBadlands\n\nYear Released: 1973 This 1970’s crime drama stars Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen as a young couple on the run from the law for murder. It’s often referred to as one of the best and most powerful films in history. The movie is rated 98% “Certified Fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Vincent Canby called it a “most important and exciting film.”\n\nSissy Spacek later said that shooting the film changed the entire way she thought about filmmaking in general. “The artist rules,” she said of the work. “Nothing else matters.” Her co-star, Sheen, says that Badlands is still, to this the day, the best script he’s ever read.\n\nIn a Lonely Place\n\nYear Released: 1950 Film star legend Humphrey Bogart stars in this film noir as an unstable screenwriter named Dixon Steele who is suspected of murder. It’s made several “best of all time” lists, including Time’s, “All-Time 100’s,” and Slant’s “100 Essential Films.”\n\nDirected by Nicholas Ray, the movie was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress in 2007. Two years later, Roger Ebert added it to his own list of great movies.\n\nLaura\n\nYear Released: 1944 Laura is hailed as being one of the best film noirs of the 1940s. Full of mystery, the film follows a New York City Police Detective who investigates a woman’s murder, and as he does, winds up falling in love with her.\n\nThe film won three Oscars, including Best Cinematography for a Black-and-White Film, Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Best Director, and was nominated for two more, including Best Writing in a Screenplay.\n\nThe Apartment\n\nYear Released: 1960 Although at one point, it was simply known as a romantic comedy and drama, The Apartment would be grouped into the “dramedy,” category these days.\n\nThe movie follows an insurance clerk played by Jack Lemmon, who lets his seniors at work use his nice apartment in the city to meet with women (that their wives obviously didn’t know about.) The Guardian has called it the sixth best romantic film of all time. It was nominated for ten awards and won five of the ten at the 33rd Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nYear Released: 2002 While many of the films on our list are a bit older, now we’re in a different area of film history now. The Lord of the Rings is one of the most popular film franchises, and the 2002 release of The Two Towers was met with $951.2 million at the box office, making it the highest grossing film of the year, and the fourth highest of all time, at least, at that point.\n\nOften hailed as being one of the best fantasy films, the movie was nominated for six awards during the 75th Academy Awards show and wound up winning two.\n\nWall-E\n\nYear Released: 2008 The first animated film on our list thus far, Wall-E came out in 2008 and delighted children and families all over the world. It grossed over $533 million across the globe against a $180 million budget. The film centers on lonely trash compactor robot who’s been left alone on an uninhabitable world and falls in love with another robot who happens to come visit him.\n\nWall-E made Time’s list of the “Best Movies of the Decade,” and voted 29th out of 100 “Best of the 21st Century” films by 117 international film critics. It won the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, among several other accolades.\n\nCoco\n\nYear Released: 2017 Coco is Disney’s 2017 coming of age tale about a pre-teen boy named Miguel that has dreams of becoming a musician. He finds himself in the land of the dead having a life altering experience and communicating with skeletons. The film, while it’s definitely a comedy, also really tugs on the heartstrings of viewers, and is hard to watch without getting at least a little teary-eyed.\n\nThe film won several awards in 2018, including both the Academy and Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. It is a favorite of both children and their parents and makes a great choice for family film night.\n\nShadow of a Doubt\n\nYear Released: 1943 It shouldn’t come as a surprise there are a few Alfred Hitchcock films popping up on this list. Shadow of a Doubt is a psychological thriller full of murder and mystery, but unlike the majority of Hitchcock films, is somewhat of a slow burn. The director has apparently said it’s his favorite of all that he’s created.\n\nThe film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Story and won the Satellite Award for Best Classic DVD. It has a 4/4 from Roger Ebert and a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nInception\n\nYear Released: 2010 Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this unique sci-fi film from Christopher Nolan that delves into lucid and hive-mind dream exploration. Audiences and critics alike went wild for the film, which the latter referred to as “wholly original,” and “cut from a new cloth.” And, indeed it’s not like anything we’ve ever seen before.\n\nInception was nominated for eight Oscars and won four, including the awards for Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. It was nominated for four more, including Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nYear Released: 1940 We’ve headed back in time to 1940, when this romantic comedy directed by George Cukor hit the scene. Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn star as a young married couple on the verge of divorce. Critics seem to agree that the storyline is one of the best of its time, with one calling it a “beautifully spun tale.”\n\nThe film won the Academy Award for Best Writing in an Adapted Screenplay and brought in $3.3 million – which was a lot of money in 1940.\n\nCool Hand Luke\n\nYear Released: 1967 With a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Cool Hand Luke is an absolute classic from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The film stars Paul Newman as the title character, Luke, a man who’s sentenced to a rough prison camp. Newman ended up being nominated for an Oscar for his part.\n\nAnd, even those who’ve never even seen the film are probably still aware of its most famous line; “What we’ve got here is failure to communicate,” which has become a popular saying since the movie’s release in 67’.\n\nRebecca\n\nYear Released: 1940 Next on our list is an Alfred Hitchcock film. This time, it’s for his 1940 picture, Rebecca. This was actually Hitchcock’s first American-made movie, and by far one of his best.\n\nRebecca won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture (the only one of those particular awards the director ever won.) It was also awarded Best Cinematography and was nominated for nine others.\n\nL.A. Confidential\n\nYear Released: 1997 This 1997 neo-noir crime thriller was based on Jame’s Ellroy’s novel which was published seven years before the film hit theaters. It stars Kim Basinger, Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito, along with Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, whose careers both skyrocketed after taking part in this production.\n\nL.A Confidential, which tells the tale of police corruption in Los Angeles during Hollywood’s Golden Age, was nominated for nine Academy Awards. Of the nine, it won two, including Best Supporting Actress (for Kim Basinger,) and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nThe Kid\n\nYear Released: 1921 The oldest and only silent film on our list so far, The Kid is a black and white film starring the legendary Charlie Chaplin in his first full-length feature. But Chaplin wasn’t just the star of the show, he also wrote, directed, and produced it.\n\nCritics had nothing but wonderful things to say about it upon its release, including one review in Theatre Magazine that said, “The Kid may be counted as a screen masterpiece.”\n\nHis Girl Friday\n\nYear Released: 1940 If you haven’t seen this 1940 romantic comedy, you must add it to your list for movie nights. His Girl Friday stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell and tells the story of a newspaper editor and reporter who get wrapped up in a murder case.\n\nThe film made number 19 on the American Film Institute’s list of 100 Years and 100 Laughs. In 1993, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation for being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”\n\nAll the President’s Men\n\nYear Released: 1976 This 1976 film starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford delves into the story of the infamous Watergate scandal that occurred during the presidency of Richard Nixon. Based on a 1974 novel from Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, the movie was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress in 2010.\n\nAll the President’s Men has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and was nominated for several awards upon its release, including multiple Golden Globes and Oscars. It’s also made a number of lists, like placing 34th on the American Film Institute’s list of “America’s Most Inspiring Movies.”\n\nAliens\n\nYear Released: 1986 Look back into the cinematic world of the 1980s and we land on one of the most popular sci-fi thrillers of all time: Aliens. This 1986 film starring Sigourney Weaver is still referenced as one of the best of its kind.\n\nThe film, directed by James Cameron, won two Academy Awards in 1987; Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Editing. And, it gave us one of the creepiest scenes in film history – you know the one!\n\nHoliday\n\nYear Released: 1938 This romantic Golden Age comedy stars the powerful on-screen co-stars Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. It didn’t make a ton of money in theaters, but critics loved it. Time Out London said that it was one of director George Cukor’s best films.\n\nHoliday was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction and carries a 100% rating (out of 24 reviews,) on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nYear Released: 1930 This 1930 epic anti-war film is directed by Lewis Milestone, and tells the story of a group of young German Army recruits in the midst of World War I. It is often regarded as the best anti-war film in history and has been praised by critics all over the world.\n\nOf course, Hitler and the Nazis didn’t appreciate the film, so they stooped so low as to toss sneezing powder and mice in movie theaters to keep people from viewing it. All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for four Academy Awards and won two of them; Best Director and Outstanding Production.\n\nPlaytime\n\nYear Released: 1967 Roger Ebert gave this 1967 film a 4/4-star rating. In his review, he goes on to say that Playtime is “one of a kind,” and, “complete in itself.” And he’s not the only one. With a 98% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s highly recommended by both critics and audience members.\n\nThe film was the most expensive ever produced in French history, and, even though it was very well-received, it didn’t end up being very successful at the box office. It did, however, win a silver prize at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival, and made the British Film Institute’s director’s list of the “50 Greatest Films of All Time.”\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nYear Released: 1958 This 1958 film noir stars Orson Welles, who also happens to be the movie’s writer and director. It tells the tale of corrupt law enforcement officers in Mexico, and, aside from Welles, stars Janet Leigh, Charlton Heston, Akim Tamiroff, and Joseph Calleia. It is commonly referred to as one of Welles’ best motion pictures.\n\nThe Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the U.S National Film Registry in 1993, and it continues to impress those who see it for the first time in the 2020’s, which is evidenced by its 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nYear Released: 1940 Film legend Henry Fonda stars in this 1940 film, which is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by John Steinbeck. It can be risky business to adapt a novel into a screenplay, as you risk irritating fans of the original. But The Grapes of Wrath film was well-received by audiences and critics and followed the novel closely.\n\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther called the movie “one of the best fifty films ever made.” The Film Daily’s 1940 poll called it the second-best film of the year (Rebecca was first.)\n\nSweet Smell of Success\n\nYear Released: 1957 Sweet Smell of Success first came out in 1957, created by Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions. It stars the legendary Burt Lancaster as a newspaper columnist who doesn’t approve of his younger sister’s growing relationship with a jazz musician. So, he hired a public relations specialist to get between them and destroy the romance.\n\nThe drama noir has racked up a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but when it debuted, it didn’t exactly get the best reaction from fans. In fact, it did pretty terribly at the box office. But critics felt differently, with the New York Herald and Time magazine even putting it on their top-ten best films of the year lists.\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nYear Released: 1992 This early 90’s crime thriller was Quentin Tarantino’s first feature-length film, and he didn’t disappoint. It’s become a cult masterpiece, with Empire listing it as the single “Greatest Independent Film of All Time.” Now that we’re all used to Tarantino’s love for gore, it’s not so shocking, but it was seen as controversial at the time of its release.\n\nStill, the film was a huge hit, both with critics and audiences. It’s only gained more popularity and notoriety over the years as Tarantino continued to put out hits. In 1993, it won the Critic’s Award at the 4th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.\n\nSpotlight\n\nYear Released: 2015 Spotlight is aptly named, as it definitely shines just that on the Catholic Church’s coverups of thousands of cases of clergy members sexually abusing children. The film stars Mark Ruffalo as a reporter at the Boston Globe who’s tasked with interviewing victims and digging up proof of the church’s involvement in burying evidence of the crimes (which they do, by the way.) It garnered nearly $99 million at the box office against a budget of $20 million.\n\nThe film won a score of awards in 2016, including the Academy Awards for both Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, and three Critics’ Choice Awards, among many others.\n\nWitness for the Prosecution\n\nYear Released: 1957 This 1957 crime drama holds a perfect 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes out of 31 reviews. On IMDb, nearly 100,000 votes have been cast to rate it an 8.5/10. Based on an Agatha Christie novel, it follows a screenwriter accused of murdering a wealthy older woman.\n\nWitness for the Prosecution never actually won any Oscars, but it was nominated for six, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actress.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America\n\nYear Released: 1984 This epic crime drama is based on a novel by Harry Grey. It stars Robert De Niro and James Woods and tells the tale of two best friends and Jewish gangsters living in New York City. The film was directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone, and it would be his last before he passed away five years later.\n\nWhen Once Upon a Time in America premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, it received a standing ovation that lasted for around fifteen minutes. Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office, bringing in just over $5 million with a budget of $30 million. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a great movie!\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope\n\nYear Released: 1977 With Star Wars being the immensely popular film franchise that it is, it shouldn’t come as any surprise that they would make an appearance on the list. This film stars the original cast, including Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher, and hit theaters in 1977. It was met with nearly $776 million – and it was filmed for just $11 million.\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV won a whopping six Academy Awards, including Best Film Editing and Best Visual Effects, along with the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score in 1978.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nYear Released: 1991 You probably won’t run into many people who haven’t at least heard of The Silence of the Lambs. Or, even if they’ve never heard the title, who don’t know about Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Hopkins stars as the deranged cannibal who gets inside the head of the young detective played by Jodie Foster.\n\nThe film won several awards, including four Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Actress. Jodie Foster then won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in the film.\n\nTo Be or Not to Be\n\nYear Released: 1942 This film came out in the middle of World War II and uses comedy to shine a light on some very real things that were happening in those days. The movie tells the story of a Polish theater company that’s threatened by the invading Nazis, so they turn into spies to support themselves.\n\nThe reviews for To Be or Not to Be were mainly positive, with Rob McShane of Time Out saying, “It’s certainly one of the finest comedies to come out of Paramount.”\n\nOut of the Past\n\nYear Released: 1947 This 1947 flick is based on the novel Build My Gallows High by Geoffery Homes, which is the same title used for the film adaption in the United Kingdom. No matter which title you prefer, the film noir is filled with mystery, twists and turns, and of course, amazing cinematography.\n\nOut of the Past is often hailed as being one of the best of its kind, including in a review by Roger Ebert, which is accompanied by a perfect rating of 4/4.

Among the cast members of the remake include Rachel Ward, Jeff Bridges and James Woods.\n\nDuck Soup\n\nYear Released: 1933 Duck Soup is another one of the films on our list that didn’t do so hot in the box office but gained more recognition and appreciation as time went on.

Roger Ebert gives it a 4/4, including in his review that he believes it to be the best of the Marx Brothers films.\n\nBoyhood\n\nYear Released: 2014 There’s a very interesting production tale behind this 165-minute film that was released in 2014. Written and directed by Richard Linklater, it took more than a decade to shoot, beginning in 2001 and wrapping up the year before it came out. The script was actually conceptualized throughout the years, as well, as they began with just basic plot points.\n\nThe film premiered at Sundance in 2014 and was released in theaters not long after. It won several awards, including the Silver Bear Award for Best Director at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, and two Golden Globes, though it was nominated for five.\n\nStagecoach\n\nYear Released: 1939 It’s unlikely you’ll find many people that haven’t at least heard of this 1939 film starring John Wayne in his first major role, and the one that would launch his career. Adapted from a short story by Ernest Haycox, the motion picture follows a group of people riding through Apache territory.\n\nStagecoach was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning two; Best Supporting Actor and Best Music Scoring. The others that they were up for included Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography. Critics absolutely loved the film as much as audiences, which is evidenced by great reviews across the board, and a perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSteamboat Bill, Jr.\n\nYear Released: 1928 An older film, and a rare silent one on our list with a 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes is Steamboat Bill Jr., circa 1928. The picture stars film legend Buster Keaton, and contains his most famous on-screen stunt, where an entire house falls on him. It is said that this film actually inspired Walt Disney’s Steamboat Willie – AKA the debut of Mickey Mouse.\n\nThe house stunt is hands-down the most widely recognized part of this film and has been recreated several times in other movies and television shows, including on MacGyver and Arrested Development. The film was featured in a book titled 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.\n\nStairway to Heaven\n\nYear Released: 1946 David Niven stars in this 1946 film, which was also released under the alternate title, A Matter of Life and Death. With a 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film continues to make “best of” lists, despite it being filmed several decades ago.\n\nCritic reviews were all very positive, for the most part. This includes a 2017 addition from Village Voice critic Alan Scherstuhl, which says that it “bursts with tantalizing ideas, surprising connections, suggestive flights of fancy.” And this isn’t the only film that Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell have teamed up on that have made our list. They’re also two of the people involved in Black Narcissus.\n\n12 Years a Slave\n\nYear Released: 2013 This historical drama tells the tale of a free black man living in New York the 1800s that finds himself kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South.

In the early 90’s, it was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress.\n\nUpon its initial release, the film kind of flopped at the box office, leaving the production company in the red by around $800,000. But it was re-released a number of times over the years, including in 1977, 2001, and 2017, which were all much more profitable than the original. 2001: A Space Odyssey was nominated for four Academy Awards and won one, in the category of Best Special Visual Effects.\n\nThe Wages of Fear\n\nYear Released: 1953 This French-Italian film is based on the French Novel Le salaire de la peur, which roughly translates to “the salary of fear.” It was hailed by critics everywhere when it debuted in the 1950’s and became the 4th highest earning film of the year in France.\n\nThe Wages of Fear earned a number of awards around the time of its release, including the Golden Bear Award at the 1953 Berlin Film Festival, and the 1954 BAFTA Award for Best Film.\n\nRaging Bull\n\nYear Released: 1980 Raging Bull stars a young Robert De Niro as a boxer rising up through the ranks, who falls in love along his way.

At the 52nd Academy Awards, it was nominated for eight different accolades, winning for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and just missing out on Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nYear Released: 1952 Everyone in the western world is at the very least familiar with the famous theme (title) song from Singin’ in the Rain. “What a glorious feeling, I’m happy again!” But the film that the song was pulled from was just as successful, especially in its heyday in the ‘50s.\n\nThe musical comedy was both directed and choreographed by Gene Kelley, along with Stanley Donen. Kelley also stars as male lead, Don Lockwood, a silent film star whose production company is transitioning over to sound for the first time.

The original cast teamed up with George Lucas to create another mega hit that grossed nearly $223 million after its 1981 re-release.\n\nCritics were just as thrilled with the film as audiences, with one even using the word “thrilling” to describe his experience in theaters.

Unfortunately, when it came out in theaters, audiences weren’t rushing to see it, which resulted in a less-than-stellar box office turn out.\n\nHowever, as the years have gone by, critics have changed their thoughts about the film, and it’s now considered one of the best in movie history. It has made a number of the American Film Institute’s lists, from 1998-2007.\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets\n\nYear Released: 1949 This 1949 British black comedy was fairly well-received by critics when it was initially released. It tells the story of the son of an aristocratic woman who becomes exiled from her wealthy family when they disapprove of her marrying someone they consider to be beneath their social class. The son, Louis, goes on a killing spree after his mother’s death, killing everyone in his way to the throne.\n\nAs with many classics, the more it is seen over the years, the more it seems to grow on the critics who watch it. One publication in the 60’s for instance, called it, “the most confident comedy to ever come out of a British studio.” Time and the British Film Institute (BFI) both listed the film on their “Top 100” lists.\n\nThe Great Dictator\n\nYear Released: 1940 This film, released in 1940, was the first from actor, writer and director Charlie Chaplin to involve dialogue. Up until then, the movie star was used to working on silent films, although he did have a background in live music, which made it a bit easier for him to transition over.\n\nThe Great Dictator is a political satire comedy that poked fun at Adolph Hitler – making light of a very serious situation, which is something the world desperately needed during those days. Chaplin won several awards for his work on the film, including the 1940 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and the Jussi Award for Best Foreign Filmmaker in 1974.\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\nYear Released: 1959 With a nearly perfect rating of 99% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, North by Northwest is consistently listed as one of the best films in history.

Hitchcock also won a Silver Shell Award for Best Director, which was his second after receiving the first for his work on Vertigo.\n\nDouble Indemnity\n\nYear Released: 1944 This 1944 film noir is directed by Billy Wilder, and stars Fred MacMurray, an insurance salesman married to a woman who’d like to claim her own policy – on a dead husband.

It also wound up being banned in all of the U.S military bases, both in and out of the United States.

He begins to watch his neighbors out of boredom, and winds up discovering something much more sinister than he expected to find.\n\nRear Window is widely regarded as one of Hitchcock’s best films.

Since the original’s release, it has been remade several times, both for film and television. The infamous shower scene has been the subject of all kinds of skits, as well as a documentary released in 2017 by filmmaker Alexandre O. Phillippe, called 78/52, a reference to the number of cuts and setups used by Hitchcock for the original film.\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nYear Released: 1962 Another epic war adventure film, Lawrence of Arabia is directed by David Lean, and based on the life of British archaeologist and army officer, T.E Lawrence.

It is widely regarded as one of the best movies of its time, and in film history, period.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nYear Released: 1994 This film is arguably one of the best prison drama films ever made, and potentially one of the best dramas period. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins star as two inmates serving life sentences in a rough prison. Unfortunately, one of the men (Robbins) didn’t actually commit the murders he was accused of, which makes his life particularly tough.\n\nIt’s kind of surprising that The Shawshank Redemption didn’t win more awards than it received, which didn’t include any Oscars or Golden Globes. It was, however, nominated for several of each, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nYear Released: 1966 This 1966 epic Western stars Clint Eastwood, who teams up with an outlaw in the Southwest during the Civil War to take out a sinister villain. It has a 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is widely regarded as the best of all Spaghetti Western films.\n\nMany more recent films have paid tribute to the classic western. One of them is Quentin Tarantino's 1992 movie Reservoir Dogs, when he creates a cinematic nod to the famed standoff scene. Stephen King also said that the film was his inspiration behind his novel, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger.\n\nDr. Strangelove\n\nYear Released: 1964 This 1964 film, which is also known as it’s full title: Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars George C.

Of the six, Dr. Strangelove took home four wins, including Best Film from Any Source and Best British Film.\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nYear Released: 2008 Directed by Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight is hands-down one of the best films in the Batman franchise. Christian Bale plays the superhero, trying to save the city from the maniacal Joker. The iconic villain was played by the late Heath Ledger in his final role on film, which won him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nThe film holds a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 4/4 from Roger Ebert. But critics weren’t the only ones who ate it up. Audiences loved the film, too, with one member saying it was the “sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted,” and went on to add, “Heath Ledger is a legend!” Yes, yes he is.\n\nChinatown\n\nYear Released: 1974 With a nearly perfect rating of 99% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, Chinatown has been hailed as director Roman Polanski’s best film. It stars a young Jack Nicholson as a detective hired to investigate a case of adultery and ends up stumbling upon something much larger and darker.\n\nThe film won several awards in 1975, including the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and four Golden Globes; Best Motion Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Director. It also won a number of other awards including BAFTAs and the Bodil Award for Best American Film.\n\nModern Times\n\nYear Released: 1936 Charlie Chaplin was the comic relief that the world needed during the Great Depression and some of the most troubling times society had seen. He took serious situations and satirized them, providing laughs when there weren’t very many reasons to smile.\n\nIn 1989, the Library of Congress deemed the film “culturally significant” and it was preserved in the National Film Registry. The film has also made several of AFI’s “100 Movies” lists.\n\nAll About Eve\n\nYear Released: 1950 Joseph L. Mankiewicz both wrote and directed this 1950 drama, based on a short story called The Wisdom of Eve by Mary Orr. Bette Davis stars as an aging Broadway star whose career is threatened by a young woman who worms her way into her life.

His work on-screen in The Third Man is no different, and is highly regarded as a favorite, both in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe British Film Institute called it the greatest film in history in 1999, and a poll of 150 actors, directors, critics and producers in Time Out magazine ranked it second-best of all time. It won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and was nominated for two others, including Best Director, and also won the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film.\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\n\nYear Released: 1975 Of course we’d include this 1975 classic drama on our list. The film stars Jack Nicholson as a psychiatric patient who leads an uprising in a mental hospital. The film was based on the 1962 novel of the same name, written by Ken Kesey, and is often referred to as one of the best films of all time, both by critics and audience members.\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was the winner of several prestigious awards, including the big five Oscars; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress. It also won six Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture (Drama) and Best Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama.)\n\nGoodfellas\n\nYear Released: 1990 Martin Scorsese makes yet another appearance on the “best of” list with his classic 1990 gangster drama, Goodfellas.

The film is widely regarded as the star’s masterpiece, which follows The Little Tramp on his attempts to court a blind girl that he’s fallen for.\n\nSight and Sound magazine’s 1952 poll named it the second-best film of all time, and that was one of many times it’s been given that honor. American Film Institute has included it in seven of their “100 Years” lists and called it the single “Best Romantic Comedy” on their 2008 “10 Top 10.”\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\nIf you’ve been expecting to see this one pop up on the list, you won't be disappointed!

That same year, it scored three Academy Awards as well.\n\nCasablanca\n\nYear Released: 1942 Even those who’ve never before seen a single minute of Casablanca have likely heard the famous line, “Here’s looking at you, kid.” But those who haven’t seen it should definitely check it out sometime, considering it is widely known as one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nAt the 16th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for a total of eight honors, and wound up receiving three; Best Director, Outstanding Motion Picture, and Best Writing in a Screenplay.\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nYear Released: 1993 Schindler’s List is a historical drama directed by Steven Spielberg and released in the early 90’s.

And we’re looking back on the 1920s during Hollywood’s silent film era to revisit this silent comedy directed by and starring Buster Keaton.

It’s considered such a classic that it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in 1991.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nYear Released: 1972\n\nThere was no way we could have our list without this crime drama classic from the early 1970s. The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan as members of an infamous Italian American crime family.\n\nThe Godfather constantly makes all kinds of “best films of all times” lists, and currently holds a nearly perfect (98%) score on Rotten Tomatoes. It also won a number of prestigious awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe for Best Director.\n\nThe Godfather: Part II\n\nYear Released: 1974 Two years after the ultra-successful first installment of The Godfather film franchise, the second part was released – and it did not disappoint. Starring the same celebrities and again directed by Coppola, the film brought in $88 million at the box office against a budget of just around $13 million.\n\nMost films on our list were at most around an 8.2 or 8.5/10 on IMDb, but The Godfather: Part II sits at a 9/10, which isn’t an easy feat when it comes to over one million votes.

It also received several other accolades, which include two National Society of Film Critics Awards.\n\nUnder the Skin\n\nYear Released: 2013\n\nNormally, a sci-fi film starring Scarlette Johansson doesn't need much else to get people to come to theaters. This one, however, was a little lost on moviegoers. With a budget of a little over $13 million and a box-office revenue of about $7 million, \"Under the Skin\" flopped hard.\n\nThat being said, critics adored it! The story of a men-eating woman-like alien and her outlook on the human world won accolades up the wazoo and was even listed as number 61 in the BBC list of 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century! Director Jonathan Glazer was also nominated for numerous awards for his work.\n\nGroundhog Day\n\nYear Released: 1993\n\nThe 1993 comedy classic 'Groundhog Day,' starring Bill Murray, was a relative success back when it came out. It’s a story about a cynical reporter who gets sent to cover Groundhog Day in the boring town of Punxsutawney, only to find out that due to some magical force, he has to relive the same day over and over again, with no explanation.\n\nThis film popularized the trope aptly called “Groundhog Day Loop”, in which a character has to experience the same events over and over, and starts experimenting until he finds out what caused the loop and solves it. Despite the film not having any incredible performance or acclaim when it first came out, over the years, 'Groundhog Day' has become a cult classic.\n\nTitanic\n\nYear released: 1997\n\nIf we have to choose the best romantic movie of the 20th century, \"Titanic\" has to be our choice. There is still no clear verdict if the movie was so successful because of its casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) or because of Celin Dions' astonishing performance in \"My Heart Will Go On.\"\n\nOne of the great things about this movie is the attention to detail. It is not easy reconstructing and bringing to life a piece of history, and the production of \"Titanic\" brought it to perfection. The movie is relatively long, with a love story of almost three hours, however, it is put together in such a way that even after Dion's last note, there is room for a little more.\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nYear Released: 1998\n\n“Saving Private Ryan” kicks off with a harrowing portrayal of the Normandy landings during WWII. A squad of soldiers is on a mission— to rescue Private Ryan from enemy territory. Director Steven Spielberg walks a fine line with the narrative, grappling with celebrating the soldiers’ bravery while laying bare the horrors of war, especially in a gut-wrenching opening battle sequence.\n\nThe balance between critiquing the larger machinery of war and recognizing human endeavor is never easy. In doing so, sometimes, the film contradicts itself but manages to get the point across. Overall, “Saving Private Ryan” is a visceral war film that stays with you. It's what war movies strive to be — raw, unfiltered, and powerful – and why the film remains a cherished classic still.\n\nForrest Gump\n\nYear Released: 1994\n\n\"Forrest Gump\" is a classic American film that you have most likely seen or at least heard of. Since its release in 1994, this comedy-drama has been watched by millions and has stolen many peoples’ hearts along the way. The story follows several decades of the life of Forrest Gump, who is played by Tom Hanks.\n\nGump is a dim-witted but warm-hearted man from Alabama who experiences several defining historical events in the 20th century in the United States. The film was a huge success and won numerous awards, including the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing.\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\nYear Released: 1998\n\nJeff Bridges is simply perfect as the laid-back protagonist in this Coen brothers' comedy. His character is known as \"The Dude,\" who is mistaken for a millionaire with the same name; mishaps ensue as he gets caught up in a kidnapping ring. The film is edgy and creative, and the ensemble cast did well to create memorable characters.\n\nMany might attribute the film's success to its pointed dialogue, but its life lessons about friendship are what make it so much more than a comedy. The movie was released more than 25 years ago and is as influential as it was back in its early days.\n\nSe7en\n\nYear Released: 1997\n\nAs a pair of detectives race to catch a serial killer who is offing people while following the seven deadly sins, we’re treated to an incredible movie that is, honestly, hard to watch. Still, it’s a really good film. Kevin Spacey is revealed to be the killer near the end of the movie – that’s not the twist.\n\nIn fact, that one was easy to figure out since people spotted the famous Spacey in the movie and figured that such a famous actor wouldn’t just be there for a single throwaway moment. The real twist was that Brad Pitt’s character is revealed to be the “wrath” of the seven sins, and he’s goaded into killing Spacey’s character when given a box that contains the head of his pregnant wife. Did we spoil this one for you? Go and watch it anyway.\n\nFight Club\n\nYear Released: 1999\n\nThis is one of the most famous and inspirational movies ever. A group of outcasts, led by the enigmatic, charismatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,) form a fight club that eventually turns into an illegal organization. The narrator, played by Edward Norton, watches all of this from the sidelines... or so he thinks.\n\nAt the end of the film, as the skyscrapers tumble, it’s revealed that Tyler Durden IS the narrator, and all the things that Brad Pitt’s character was doing were actually the actions of the narrator, whose name is revealed to also (or only) be Tyler Durden. While not only a great film, the twist elevated the movie to something that anybody of age should see.\n\nThe Matrix\n\nYear Released: 1999\n\nHave you ever had a dream that you were sure was real? How do you know the difference between a dream and reality? What if a movie had the power to change the way you understood your existence? For over 20 years, \"The Matrix\" has been challenging our perception of reality.\n\nAs Neo discovers the shocking truth about the life he knew to be accurate, viewers around the globe are sucked into an ongoing battle to destroy the illusion that has been enslaving humanity. \"The Matrix\" was groundbreaking. It opened the door for more innovative science fiction movies and left the audiences with too many things to think about and not enough answers in hand.\n\nJurassic Park\n\nYear Released: 1993\n\nThere are some movies you can watch over and over again, and Jurassic Park, which was released in 1993, is one of them. It is one of those movies that never seem to age and only get better and better. It is much more than just dinosaurs taking over the world — there is something captivating about the team who, together, try to fight terror.\n\nThe effects that Steven Spielberg used were outstanding, and his personal touch was felt throughout the entire movie. Spielberg managed to take a simple story and, by adding rich characters and a coat of drama, create a masterpiece of the 1990s.\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nYear Released: 2005\n\nIn 1963, two cowboys having an affair was unheard of. Until \"Brokeback Mountain\" was released, which brought this love affair to life. What started as two young men enjoying the summer holiday together, herding sheep enjoying the wilds of Wyoming, would soon turn into forbidden love and a masterpiece concerning Hollywood creations.\n\nThe late Heath Ledger, who played the role of Ennis, received remarkable reviews for his performance in the movie and turned a complicated and hidden relationship into such a heartwarming and inspiring story. At the 2006 Oscar Ceremony, \"Brokeback Mountain\" received three awards: Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World\n\nYear Released: 2010\n\nEdgar Wright's \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" came out in 2010 with a whopping $85 million budget. But, unfortunately, the movie-goers didn't think it was worth their time, only paying a collective sum of $49.3 million to see it.\n\nDespite its rocky start, the film quickly gained a cult following, thanks in no small part to its talented young cast, including Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Chris Evans. It's now hailed as one of the most innovative comedies of the 21st century, proving that sometimes, audiences don't know a good thing when it smacks them in the face with a bass guitar.\n\nThe Usual Suspects\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nWe can't talk about this great movie without mentioning the crime film “The Usual Suspects.” The movie has a man named Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) being interrogated by the police after a bank heist that went pear-shaped. Kint tells the story of the heist in flashbacks, describing how a mysterious man named Keyser Soze brought a team together and laid out a plan.\n\nHowever, after Kint has left the station, it’s discovered that there was never any Keyser Soze – Kint had made up the story wholesale, using items in the office he was in as inspiration. It seems so simple, but this is still regarded as one of the most famous ways to twist a movie ever – did ANYTHING in the film actually happen?\n\nMulholland Drive\n\nYear Released: 2001\n\nDavid Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\" had a lot going for it, including a $15 million budget, but unfortunately only made $20.1 million at the box office. Despite this initial lack of success, the film has gained a cult following since its release, with critics hailing it as one of the best films of the 21st century.\n\nOriginally planned as a T.V. series, the mysterious, mind-bending commentary on Hollywood has become a favorite of Lynch fans who enjoy delving into the film's complexities and theorizing about its mysteries. \"Mulholland Drive\" proves that sometimes it takes time for a film to find its audience and appreciate it for the masterpiece it truly is.\n\nLa La Land\n\nYear Released: 2016\n\nOne of the more recent additions to the pantheon of musical movies is the fantastic \"La La Land.\" Unfortunately, the now-infamous incident in which this movie was wrongfully announced as Best Picture at the Academy Awards has, in many ways, overshone the actual quality of this beautiful movie. Riding the wave of the success of his hit movie \"Whiplash,\" Damien Chazelle took virtually every aspect of his filmmaking repertoire to a whole new level.\n\nFirstly, he upped the ante with casting, with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone leading this one. The cinematography of \"La La Land\" was also a real sight for sore eyes. But maybe the most underrated aspect of the film is its musical numbers, which are nothing short of majestic.\n\nWest Side Story\n\nYear Released: 1961\n\nIt started out as an Off-Broadway play, and then somehow, it transpired into the musical movie that it is today, giving people from all around the world a chance to see it. \"West Side Story\" follows the lives of two youngsters from rival gangs in New York City who fall in love.\n\nTechnically, their love should be forbidden as they come from different ethnic backgrounds, and as such, the tensions build to tragedy as the story unfolds. Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise directed the 1961 version of this flick, and it somehow managed to claim a whopping 10 Oscars, whereas the modern-day 2021 counterpart by the legendary director Steven Spielberg earned just one.\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nYear Released: 1995\n\nJane Austen wrote the original story of \"Sense and Sensibility\" over 250 years ago in 1790. Austen was known for creating her magnificent interpretation of British middle-class society, all adorned with great and inspiring love stories. In the 1995 Hollywood version, not everything is about wild (in a British way) love, and it is also about complicated relationships between siblings and extended families in the 18th century.\n\nThe love stories in \"Sense and Sensibility\" are emotional and full of humor and bring their wittiness to the screen. It is one of those movies that surprises you with something completely different when you are sure you know what is the next thing that will happen.\n\nLife Is Beautiful\n\nYear Released: 1997\n\nIf there is one thing the Movie \"Life is Beautiful\" emphasizes, it is that no matter what people go through and no matter how life treats them, there is nothing stronger than the human soul, and if we choose to, we can overcome anything that comes our way, even the darkest days in modern history.\n\nAlthough \"Life Is Beautiful\" takes place in WWII Europe, the movie sheds light on an imaginary beautiful life a father paints for his young boy. Unsurprisingly, \"Life Is Beautiful\" grasped more than ten awards and is considered one of the best movies released in the 1990s.\n\nFrozen\n\nYear Released: 2013\n\nWe can't underestimate the impact that \"Frozen\" had on an entire generation. This really was the Disney musical epic for a very specific age group. It's amazing to think that there were only six years between the first one and the second one — because, for us, that gap in time felt like an absolute eternity!\n\nThe story of Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and the others is one for the ages. And when you consider the songs that came with it, most notably, \"Let It Go,\" it's no wonder that people are struggling to forget about this instant Disney classic. Heck, \"Frozen\" even ended up getting two Academy Awards, and rightfully so.\n\nMy Fair Lady\n\nYear Released: 1964\n\n1964's \"My Fair Lady\" is an almost perfect musical thanks to Audrey Hepburn's fearlessly fabulous performance. Set in 1910s London, the pompous professor Henry Higgins, who Sir Rex Harrison portrayed, is so sure of himself that he attempts to transform a crude Cockney girl into someone who is fit to be introduced into high society.\n\nThe working-class girl, Eliza Doolittle, is played by Hepburn, and she is pretty much sparkling like a diamond for nearly the entire duration of the movie. This movie won a mighty 8 Oscars, so if you haven't seen it, then maybe it's time to change that and give this movie a chance!\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nYear Released: 1987\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a movie that was so great that people just didn't get it. Of course, we're talking about \"The Princess Bride,\" a film that was a bit of a dud when it first came out in 1987. Maybe it was Fox's marketing campaign, or maybe people were just confused about whether it was a fantasy, action, comedy, or children's movie.\n\nWhatever the reason was, this movie is not only quoted until this day but is still watched all over the world (and it has been a good several decades since its release). The movie became a huge success only when it came out on VHS! It was like everyone had been living under a rock until they saw it. To put it in numbers, the movie had a budget of $16 million but made around $30.9 million at the box office."
