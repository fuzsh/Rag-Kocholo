        "text": "Est. 3min\n\nRussia's travel blacklist has sparked a dispute in the French Parliament. The right and left are divided over whether an official visit to Russia should go ahead in spite of the travel ban imposed on leading Socialist MP Bruno Le Roux. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 2min\n\nFrance’s foreign minister warned Monday that the international community had no option but to combat climate change as there is “no alternative planet”.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nUkraine's military accused pro-Russian rebels yesterday (13 April) of using heavy weapons that were meant to have been withdrawn under a ceasefire deal, after one Ukrainian serviceman was killed and six wounded in rebel-held territories.\n\nEst. 2min\n\nThe French, German, Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers will meet in Berlin on Monday (13 April) to review the fragile ceasefire agreed on in February, to end a year of bloody war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nInternational negotiations on disaster risk reduction ended on Wednesday 18 March with a disappointing agreement, despite the recent drama in Vanuatu. Some have seen this as a bad omen for this year's UN climate negotiations. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nThe countries involved in the COP 21 climate negotiations in Paris this year are running late with the submission of their national plans, which are due by the end of March. France has forced the subject onto the EU summit agenda this week to encourage its European partners to prod the late-comers into action. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nThe foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany agreed on Tuesday (24 February) to seek a reinforcement of the international monitoring mission in Ukraine and renewed their calls for an oft-breached ceasefire agreement to be respected.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nEU foreign ministers decided to delay putting more Ukrainian separatists and Russians on the sanctions list on Monday (9 February) in order to give a Franco-German peace plan time to work. Meanwhile in Washington, President Barack Obama has thrown his support behind EU diplomatic efforts.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nThe representatives of over 190 countries met in Geneva on Sunday (8 February) to continue talks on a UN-level agreement to tackle climate change.

EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: With ten months to go before the COP 21, Paris is doing all it can to provide the ideal conditions for a global agreement. Europe hopes to play a facilitating role in the international negotiations, which will focus on the needs and attainable contributions of individual countries. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nManuel Valls has announced a 735 million euro plan to bolster France's defences against terrorism over the next three years. The French government says this unplanned expenditure will not threaten their agreement with Brussels to reduce the national deficit. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nGermany and France are secretly discussing a deal to enable the European Commission to approve Paris's draft 2015 budget even though it breaks past deficit-cutting commitments, German weekly Der Spiegel said yesterday (19 October).\n\nEst. 5min\n\nDrones for Ukraine, no ground troops in Syria and Iraq: German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his French counterpart Laurent Fabius celebrated the French-German relations at a meeting in Berlin Wednesday (15 October), doing their best to circumvent controversial issues like the French budget deficit. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nUkrainian forces have raised their national flag over a police station in the city of Luhansk that was for months under rebel control, Kyiv said yesterday (17 August), in what could be a breakthrough in Ukraine's efforts to crush pro-Moscow separatists.\n\nEst. 7min\n\nEU foreign ministers threatened Russia yesterday (22 July) with harsher sanctions over Ukraine that could inflict wider damage on its economy following the downing of a Malaysian airliner, but delayed action for a few days.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nThe foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin yesterday (2 July) to hold three-way talks involving pro-Moscow rebels by Saturday, in order to pave the way for a new ceasefire, despite continued fighting that Kyiv says has now killed 200 of its troops.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nUS regulators could impose a record-breaking fine of $10 billion (€7.34 billion) against BNP Paribas. France will call the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) into question if US threats turn into action. EURACTIV France reports.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nFrance and Germany assured Georgia yesterday (24 April) that a deal bringing it closer to the European Union would be sealed within weeks, moving to tighten ties with the ex-Soviet republic as tension mounts between Russia and the West over Ukraine."
