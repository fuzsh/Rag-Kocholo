        "text": "Statements made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development Spokesperson (Paris, April 8, 2015)\n\nâ¢ Ukraine â Meeting between Laurent Fabius and his Ukrainian counterpart\n\nâ¢ Launch of TV5monde Style HD by Laurent Fabius\n\nâ¢ European Union â Germany - Harlem DÃ©sirâs visit to the headquarters of BASF France during the open house of the Office franco-allemand pour la jeunesse\n\nâ¢ Jamaica â Economic diplomacy â Awarding of Kingston container terminal concession to CMA-CGM\n\nâ¢ Germany - âEchoes of Franceâ and âJazzahead!â trade show (Bremen, April 9-26)\n\nUkraine â Meeting between Laurent Fabius and his Ukrainian counterpart\n\nForeign minister Laurent Fabius is meeting this afternoon with Pavlo Klimkin, his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nThey will discuss the follow-up to the Minsk agreement of February 12.\n\nThey will also work on strengthening the most important aspects of our bilateral relationship and will lay the groundwork for President Petro Poroshenkoâs Paris visit on April 22.\n\nLaunch of TV5monde Style HD by Laurent Fabius\n\nLaurent Fabius visited the offices of TV5Monde today to launch the networkâs latest venture, a new lifestyle channel called TV5Monde Style HD.\n\nIn French with English, Mandarin and Arabic subtitles, this channel will initially broadcast in the Middle East/Maghreb and in the Asia/Pacific.\n\nIt will feature programs on every aspect of French and Francophone lifestyle: culture, history, architecture, hotels, design, fashion, luxury, gastronomy, etc.\n\nA showcase for our savoir-faire and the excellence of our creators and companies, this network â carried by all French-language partners of TV5 Monde â is fully synergistic with the aims of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development in terms of influence, economic diplomacy, and Franceâs attractiveness to tourists.\n\nEuropean Union â Germany - Harlem DÃ©sirâs visit to the headquarters of BASF France during the open house of the Office franco-allemand pour la jeunesse\n\nEuropean Affairs minister Harlem DÃ©sir is going to Levallois today for the open house of the Office franco-allemand pour la jeunesse (French-German Youth Office).\n\nAt the headquarters of BASF France, he will meet with students from the Claude Debussy d'Aulnay-sous-Bois middle school (priority education network of Seine-Saint-Denis).\n\nComing just days after the 17th Council of French and German ministers in Berlin, this event will help young people better understand the concrete benefits of a dual French-German culture by showcasing companies operating in both countries.\n\nJamaica â Economic diplomacy â Awarding of Kingston container terminal concession to CMA-CGM\n\nOn April 7, the French shipbuilder Compagnie maritime d'affrÃ¨tement-Compagnie gÃ©nÃ©rale maritime (CMA-CGM) signed a 30-year concession for the Kingston container terminal. Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller attended the signing ceremony with the Presidentâs personal representative for Latin American and the Caribbean, Jean-Pierre Bel.\n\nThe awarding of the concession reflects the strengthening of ties between our two countries since the meeting, last June 16, between Laurent Fabius and his Jamaican counterpart, Arnold Nicholson. That was the first meeting between French and Jamaican foreign ministers since Jamaica gained its independence in 1962.\n\nValued at nearly 600 million euros, this initiative aims to make Kingston one of the Caribbeanâs five main ports. It is the largest investment project by a French company in the region, and its location will be particularly strategic with the Panama Canal expansion slated for 2016.\n\nGermany - âEchoes of Franceâ and âJazzahead!â trade show (Bremen, April 9-26)\n\nFrance is the country of honor at the 10th edition of the Jazzahead! trade show in Bremen from April 23-26. Considered Europeâs largest professional gathering focused on jazz and improvisational music, this show welcomes more than 3,000 participants each year.\n\nAhead of this event, the multidisciplinary âEchoes of FranceâÂ festival, running from April 9 to 23 with the support of Bremenâs Institut franÃ§ais, will present various facets of French culture in the fields of dance, theater, film and literature. Opening day performances will feature singer Emily Loiseau, trumpet player Erik Truffaz and the hip-hop dancers of âBlack, blanc, beur.â\n\nJazzahead! will recognize the importance of French jazz, with more than 100 artists featured in 20 concerts for the general public and music professionals.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.institutfrancais.de/bremen/?lang=fr."
