Afterwards the Ministers can report on these trips to the relevant Assemblée nationale and Bundestag committees.\n\n- The Ministers have agreed to drive forward cooperation on the early identification of crises and on crisis prevention.\n\n- The Ministers will examine specific options for the co‑location of diplomatic missions abroad.\n\n- With a view to the European elections, the Ministers intend to join forces in working to convey the significance of Europe to the citizens in France and Germany.\n\nThis meeting also gave both Ministers the opportunity to define the main issues which lend themselves to close cooperation between their two countries, particularly with regard to the Franco-German Council of Ministers on 19 February."
