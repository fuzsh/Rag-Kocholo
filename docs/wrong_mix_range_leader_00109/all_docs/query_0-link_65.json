        "text": "Macron himself is often described by officials who have worked closely with him as a “Darwinian” — espousing a survival-of-the fittest approach among his team. And burnouts are not unheard of in French foreign policy posts, including at the foreign ministry.\n\nOfficials who know Thuaudet and Gorjestani though, said they thrived in previous high-pressure jobs.\n\n“Teymouraz Gorjestani was the best I had in my team, Claire Thuaudet is wonderful and very hard-working,” said a former diplomatic official with a reputation for being tough who worked with both.\n\nThuaudet worked in the office of then-Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who was known as a demanding boss. Gorjestani served at the French Mission to the United Nations in New York, where the workload can be heavy and scrutiny is high.\n\nCurrent and former Elysée officials who witnessed outbursts in the cell described instances where Rufo lost her temper, yelling at, disparaging and undercutting colleagues for not doing a task as she had envisioned. Rufo denies this was the case, Elysée officials said.\n\nOfficials also described an environment in which Bonne and Rufo would yell at subordinates to the point of reducing them to tears, order staff to redo work over and over again while changing their instructions or failing to provide necessary information.\n\nMultiple officials with first-hand knowledge of the situation said Bonne and Rufo blocked a planned appointment of Thuaudet to the post of consul general in San Francisco and gave subordinates the sense they had the power to destroy their careers in the French diplomatic service.\n\nA presidency official close to the situation disputed that notion. “None of the people who left had their careers hindered,” the official said.\n\nStrife has also flared between Bonne and Rufo, according to multiple officials. Three said Rufo told colleagues that Bonne needs to be replaced. The presidency declined to comment.\n\n‘Brain death’ backlash\n\nBeyond these personnel issues, some French officials complained that the cell failed to prepare diplomats to deal with the huge international backlash against Macron’s description last year of NATO as experiencing “brain death.”\n\nTwo or three weeks before the remarks were published in the Economist, the cell had the transcript of the interview, according to two officials privy to the information.\n\nThey said concerns were raised at two weekly meetings of the cell about the effect Macron’s comment might have, though no one predicted the subsequent firestorm. During that time, neither Bonne nor Rufo gave instructions to their subordinates on how to handle any backlash, the officials said.\n\nThe presidency official close to the situation dismissed such criticism, saying “I do not recall meetings during which anyone warned of anything.”\n\n“The fact is the objective of the president was fulfilled,” the official added, in reference to Macron’s desire to give NATO a kind of diplomatic electric shock ahead of its December 2019 summit in London.\n\nOther officials said relevant people at the foreign ministry were only informed of the contents of the interview a couple of days before publication, or even later.\n\nLeaving diplomats in the dark might have been a deliberate choice by Macron, who publicly warned French ambassadors in 2019 not to try to undercut his disruptive policies and spoke of the “deep state” in a speech at the foreign ministry.\n\nBut the lack of a timely heads-up angered French officials and diplomats, who were left scrambling for talking points and ill-equipped to defend Macron to baffled allies.\n\nA second Elysée official close to the situation said the effect of Macron’s message had been anticipated and the diplomatic cell spoke to the foreign ministry “immediately.” But the official would not specify how far ahead of publication the ministry was notified.\n\nThe two officials also sought to play down any enmity between the cell and the foreign ministry.\n\n“The foreign ministry is a ministry with a mission, with people who are passionate about their job,” the first official said. The official said that sometimes presidency requests to the ministry go unanswered but said this “doesn’t matter,” adding that every adviser in the cell has a weekly coordination lunch with counterparts at the ministry.\n\nAggressive pushback\n\nBonne and Rufo are outsiders of sorts from the usual pool of candidates for their positions.\n\nRufo, who is a pure product of elite French institutions with degrees from the country’s three most prestigious social sciences and politics universities, has never served in an embassy abroad. She is also only 40 and the first woman to hold such a high level position in the cell.\n\nBonne did not attend such elite schools, but specialized in the Middle East, doing fieldwork, learning Arabic, Turkish and Farsi and serving in some of the most complex diplomatic posts including in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Lebanon as well as at the United Nations.\n\nThey both served in then-President François Hollande’s diplomatic cell, in lower positions, and met Macron when he was then deputy secretary-general of the Elysée.\n\nSince the investigation into the cell was revealed, officials at the presidency close to the situation have pushed back increasingly aggressively against the accusations.\n\nThey have pointed to the leadership role France has played on the international scene under Macron while dismissing the complaints as internal score-settling.\n\n“Beware of rumors, unless you want to participate in a targeted campaign,” one of those officials said. “The main reproach one can make of diplomats is that they are tattletales.”\n\nUnder Bonne’s leadership, the diplomatic cell has had to navigate extremely turbulent waters on the international scene, handling a once-in-a-century global pandemic, an ever-more belligerent Turkey, complex relationships with Russia and China and a U.S. level of disengagement with Europe not seen since before World War II.\n\nIt has handled these issues with less than a dozen advisers — a small fraction of the roughly 100 staff that are part of the U.S. National Security Council, its closest equivalent.\n\nThe cell has shepherded a series of high-profile French initiatives, coming as close as anyone to brokering a deal between the U.S. and Iran and hosting a G7 summit that won Macron widespread praise for his management of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nYet even though France and its president have their highest international profile in decades, French officials say diplomats have refused to take up the usually highly sought-after positions that have become vacant within the diplomatic cell.\n\nPresidency officials close to the situation deny that is the case, noting the recruitment at the end of August of a new adviser on Turkey and continental Europe, Isabelle Dumont — a Turkish-speaking former ambassador to Ukraine and Cyprus — and a new adviser on global affairs, Olivier Ray, who led the French Development Agency in Lebanon.\n\n“I find it unfair when I read that this team has problems recruiting,” one of the presidency officials said. “The team is doing its job, working. It’s not pleasant to hear that there are recruitment problems for those who just got recruited.”\n\nHowever, two other vacancies have yet to be filled — the posts of Europe adviser and strategic affairs adviser. Alexandre Adam, a technical adviser on Europe, is expected to step up to take the Europe job, which he has been filling in an acting capacity.\n\nRufo herself is expected to take on the strategic affairs post, according to officials, in a move that would give her more formal influence in the cell.\n\nNeither Bonne nor Rufo is planning to resign, according to officials."
