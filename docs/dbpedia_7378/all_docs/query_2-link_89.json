        "text": "Sandy Bresler, who served as Jack Nicholson‘s agent and spokesman for more than 60 years, died Thursday in Santa Monica after a short illness, his family announced. He was 87.\n\nBresler first met the eventual three-time Oscar winner when both were serving in the California Air National Guard. He began representing the actor in 1961 after starting his career as a secretary at the William Morris Agency a year earlier.\n\nBresler’s clients also included actors Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Louise Linton, now wife of film executive and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He “established the gold standard for personally curated talent representation,” his family noted.\n\nOn July 14, 1969, the day the Nicholson-starring Easy Rider premiered, the agent announced the launch of Sandy Bresler & Associates with an ad in The Hollywood Reporter in which he noted he was the actor’s “exclusive” representative.\n\nBorn on Jan. 20, 1937, Bresler was the son of Jerry Bresler, who produced such films as The Vikings (1958), Gidget Goes to Rome (1963), Casino Royale (1967) and an Oscar-winning 1943 short.\n\nIn 1983, he founded the independent boutique agency Bresler-Kelly & Associates with John Kelly. He also worked for CMA (before he was let go by Freddie Fields) and ICM, departing to establish Bresler, Wolff, Cota & Livingston (later known as The Artists Agency).\n\nHe served on the board of the Association of Talent Agents for nearly 30 years and as ATA president for more than a decade.\n\n“Throughout Sandy’s remarkable tenure, as a friend and leader, he demonstrated unparalleled dedication and visionary leadership, guiding the association through a period of significant growth and transformation,” ATA executive director Karen Stuart said in a statement. “Under his stewardship, ATA expanded its reach and influence.\n\n“Sandy’s unwavering commitment to the talent agency profession was instrumental in advancing the interests of our members and elevating the industry as a whole. Sandy was a mentor to many, and he leaves behind a lasting impact that will be felt for years to come.”\n\nHe survived a sextuple bypass in 2003.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 58 years, Nancy; his son, Eric; his daughter, Jennifer; and his twin grandsons, Brandon and Jonah. His funeral is set for noon on Aug. 6 at Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City."
