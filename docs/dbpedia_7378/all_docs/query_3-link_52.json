Well it was in season 18, episode Marge Gamer that the most frustrated mum in animated comedy announced she was born on the same day as actor Randy Quaid - October 1st 1956.\n\nFortunately, thanks to The Simpsons’ non-linear plot format, Marge will forever remain a youthful 34 (over her true age of 61), which is just as well given the amount of crow’s-feet-inducing-stress Bart and Homer have given her over the years."
