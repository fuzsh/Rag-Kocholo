Though his career has been somewhat uneven, his easy-going, slightly swaggering charm and Texan drawl have been put to good use in films by Philip Kaufman (The Right Stuff 1983) and Jim McBride (The Big Easy 1987). Quaid's second career as a singer-songwriter has made him an appropriate - though not always successful - choice to portray musicians on screen, as in The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (1981), Tough Enough (1983) and - as Jerry Lee Lewis - Great Balls of Fire (1989).\n\nDespite appearing in a number of unsuccessful films in the late 80s and early 90s, Quaid received praise for his performance in the decidedly dark Texas drama, Flesh and Bone (1993). Shedding his patented Chesire cat grin, Quaid played a man so haunted by his family's past that he is unable to have human contact. He also delivered an outstanding performance as Doc Holliday in Tombstone (1994). In Rob Cohen's medieval epic Dragonheart (1996), Quaid played a knight who teams with one of the last surviving dragons (voiced by Sean Connery) to battle an evil king (David Thewlis). He returned to more contemporary times for the thriller SwitchBack (1997) and Disney's remake of The Parent Trap (1998).\n\nAfter offering a stellar performance as a mercenary in the little-seen Savior (1998), Quaid turned in a fine performance as an aging quarterback in the Oliver Stone-directed Any Given Sunday (1999). He followed with a turn as a firefighter who is able to communicate across time with his grown son (James Caveziel) in the fantasy Frequency and then was cast as a slippery lawyer advising the wife of a drug lord in Traffic (both 2000).\n\nFormerly married to actress P J Soles, Quaid married actress Meg Ryan in 1991.\n\nFilmography\n\nThe Rookie (2002)\n\nDinner With Friends (2001)\n\nFrequency (2000)\n\nTraffic (2000)\n\nAny Given Sunday (1999)\n\nSavior (1998)\n\nEverything That Rises (1998)\n\nThe Parent Trap (1998)\n\nPlaying by Heart (1998)\n\nGang Related (1997)\n\nSwitchback (1997)\n\nSesame Street: Telling The Truth (1997)\n\nDragonheart (1996)\n\nSomething to Talk About (1995)\n\nWyatt Earp (1994)\n\nUndercover Blues (1993)\n\nWilder Napalm (1993)\n\nFlesh and Bone (1993)\n\nCome See the Paradise (1990)\n\nPostcards from the Edge (1990)\n\nGreat Balls of Fire!
