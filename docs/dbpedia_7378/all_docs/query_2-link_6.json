        "text": "Sadly, after several legal problems, Quaid moved to Canada with his wife, Evi and made several YouTube videos defending their innocence. In 2015, the Quaids went to Vermont after being denied Canadian citizenship, where they went to court. After settling their problems, he currently resides in Vermont.\n\nQuaid was a repertory player during season 11. His characters include The Floating Head from Limits of the Imagination, a Twilight Zone parody and Rudy Randolph, Jr., a Texas salesman who sells irregular merchandise. Impressions include Ed McMahon and Ronald Reagan. Like the rest of the cast members of the ill-fated season, save for Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller, and Nora Dunn, he would not return for the next season. However, he would come back to guest star in the \"In Conclussion Theatre\" sketch in the season 16 episode hosted by Catherine O'Hara.\n\nCharacters/Impressions[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nFloating Head\n\nRudy Randolph Jr.\n\nImpressions[]\n\nBob Guccione\n\nEd McMahon\n\nGregory Peck\n\nJoaquin Andujar\n\nJohn F.
