        "text": "Post by teleadm on\n\nHal Ashby, had he lived, would have turn 90 this year. Born in Ogden, Utah into a Mormon family. He would eventually become one the important directors of the 1970s making movies that felt right in that decade. Come the 1980s he went into decline, labeled a drug addict, both true rumours but also untru rumours in some cases. and unemployable, and his movie style simple didn't fit into the 1980s.\n\nAshby grew up in a Mormon household, the son a dairy owner.\n\nHis tumultuous childhood as part of a dysfunctional family included the divorce of his parents, his father's suicide, and dropping out of high school, though studio biographies concealed the latter fact.\n\nAs Ashby was entering adult life, he moved from Utah to California, where he pursued a bohemian lifestyle and ultimately became an assistant film editor through a long apprenticeship. He worked on movies like Friendly Persuasion 1956, The Big Country 1958, The Children's Hour 1962 and The Greatest Story Ever Told 1965.\n\nHis career gained momentum when he served as the editor of The Loved One 1965, an adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel that involved such New Hollywood contemporaries as screenwriter Terry Southern and cinematographer Haskell Wexler. After being nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing in 1967 for The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, his big break occurred in 1968 when he won the award for In the Heat of the Night.\n\nAt the urging of mentor Norman Jewison, Ashby directed his first film, The Landlord, an early rumination on the social dynamics of gentrification in Park Slope, Brooklyn, in 1970. While his birth date placed him within the Silent Generation, the filmmaker, who had been a habitual marijuana smoker since 1950, eagerly embraced the hippie lifestyle, adopting vegetarianism and growing his hair long before it became de rigueur.\n\nThe Landlord 1970, a comedy-drama, based on the 1966 novel by Kristin Hunter.\n\nIt stars Beau Bridges in the lead role of a privileged and ignorant white man who selfishly becomes landlord of an inner-city tenement, unaware that the people he is responsible for are low-income, streetwise residents. Also in the cast are Lee Grant, Diana Sands, Pearl Bailey, and Louis Gossett Jr.. The film was Ashby's first film as director.\n\nHarold and Maude 1971, a romantic dark comedy drama.\n\nThe plot revolves around the exploits of a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) who is intrigued with death. Harold drifts away from the life that his detached mother (Vivian Pickles) prescribes for him, and slowly develops a strong friendship, and eventually a romantic relationship, with a 79-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon) who teaches Harold about living life to its fullest and that life is the most precious gift of all.\n\nThe Last Detail 1973, a comedy-drama starring Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, Randy Quaid, Clifton James, Michael Moriarty and Carol Kane.\n\nThe film became known for its frequent use of profanity.\n\nShampoo 1975, a satirical comedy-drama starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Lee Grant, Jack Warden, Tony Bill, and Carrie Fisher in her film debut.\n\nThe film is set on Election Day 1968, the day Richard Nixon was first elected as President of the United States, and was released soon after the Watergate scandal had reached its conclusion. The political atmosphere provides a source of dramatic irony, since the audience, but not the characters, are aware of the direction the Nixon presidency would eventually take. However, the main theme of the film is not presidential politics, but sexual politics; it is renowned for its sharp satire of late-1960s sexual and social mores.\n\nBound for Glory 1976, a biographical film loosely adapted from Woody Guthrie's 1943 partly fictionalized autobiography \"Bound for Glory\". The film stars David Carradine as folk singer Woody Guthrie and Ronny Cox, Melinda Dillon, Gail Strickland, John Lehne, Ji-Tu Cumbuka and Randy Quaid.\n\nIt was the first motion picture in which inventor/operator Garrett Brown used his new Steadicam for filming moving scenes.\n\nAll of the main events and characters, except for Guthrie and his first wife, Mary, are entirely fictional.\n\nComing Home 1978, a drama starring Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, Bruce Dern, Penelope Milford, Robert Carradine and Robert Ginty.\n\nThe film's narrative follows a perplexed woman, her Marine husband, and a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran she meets while her husband is deployed in Vietnam.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on February 15, 1978. Upon release, the film was a critical and commercial success with critics acclaiming the direction, screenplay and performances while the film grossed $36 million worldwide against a budget of $3 million becoming the 15th highest-grossing film of 1978.\n\nBeing There 1979, a comedy drama starring Peter Sellers and Shirley MacLaine, and features Jack Warden, Melvyn Douglas, Richard Dysart, and Richard Basehart.\n\nIn 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected Being There for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nBecause of his critical success and dependable profitability, shortly after the success of Coming Home, Ashby was able to form a production company, Northstar, under the auspices of Lorimar. After Being There, Ashby became more reclusive, often retreating to his home in Malibu Colony, a gated enclave in the city. Later, it was widely rumored in a likely whisper campaign from Lorimar (whose executives clashed with the director) that Ashby had become dependent upon cocaine, a drug that he only used intermittently since the production of Bound for Glory. As a consequence of these rumors, he slowly became unemployable. Eva Gardos, an editor who worked with Ashby during the period, has claimed that his drug intake was largely confined to marijuana and psilocybin.\n\nDuring this period, the productions of Second-Hand Hearts and Lookin' to Get Out the latter a Las Vegas caper, were plagued by the increasingly strained relationship between Ashby and Lorimar. Filmed in 1979, Second-Hand Hearts only received a poorly-reviewed limited release in 1981 before being pulled from circulation for nearly thirty years. Belatedly released in October 1982, Lookin' to Get Out earned a little under $1 million in returns and rentals on an estimated $17 million budget. During this period, Lorimar executives grew less tolerant of his increasingly perfectionist production (811,000 feet of film were used shooting Lookin' to Get Out) and editing techniques, a montage in the latter film set to The Police's \"Message in a Bottle\" took six months to perfect but proved to be logistically unusable due to a Lorimar agreement with the American Federation of Musicians.\n\nSecond-Hand Hearts 1981, starred Robert Blake, Barbara Harris and Bert Remsen.\n\nLooking to Get Out 1982, starred Jon Voight, Ann-Margret, Burt Young and the 7 y/o Angelina Jolie.\n\nLet's Spend the Night Together 1983, a rock concert docomentary with The Rolling Stones.\n\nWhile post-production of Lookin' to Get Out continued, Lorimar permitted Ashby to film The Rolling Stones' 1981 American tour documentary, the director was a longtime fan of the group. He collapsed before the final filmed concert at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona on December 13, 1981. Although Jeff Wexler claimed that Ashby was \"partying way beyond his capabilities with the Stones,\" Caleb Deschanel has said that Ashby (who directed the concert shoot on a gurney) simply had the flu. The film was well-received but gained little traction during a limited theatrical release.\n\nThe Slugger's Wife 1985, a romantic comedy written be Neil Simon and starred Michael O'Keefe, Rebecca De Mornay and Randy Quaid.\n\nIt was a critical and commercial failure. Ashby (whose cocaine use had accelerated throughout the shoot) was fired after delivering a 20-minute rough cut of the beginning of the film that included almost no dialogue.\n\n8 Million Ways to Die 1986, a crime action thriller starring Jeff Bridges, Rosanna Arquette, and Andy Garcia.\n\nWhen the Oliver Stone-written movie fared badly at the box office, Ashby's post-production process was considered to be such a liability that he was fired by the production company on the final day of principal photography.\n\nThis became Ashby's last theatrical movie.\n\nAttempting to turn a corner in his declining career, Ashby stopped using drugs, trimmed his hair and beard, and began to frequently attend Hollywood parties wearing a navy blue blazer so as to suggest that he was once again employable. Despite these efforts, he could only find work as a television director, helming one of three pilots for Beverly Hills Buntz, an unsuccessful Hill Street Blues spinoff starring Dennis Franz. He also directed Jake's Journey, a sword and sorcery fantasy conceived by Graham Chapman of Monty Python fame.\n\nLongtime friend Warren Beatty advised Ashby to seek medical care after he complained of various ailments, including undiagnosed phlebitis; he was soon diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that rapidly spread to his lungs, colon, and liver. Ashby died on December 27, 1988 at his home in Malibu, California.\n\nPublished for the first time in 2011.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nThoughts, ideas, oppinions, lists, favorits, gossip and/or anything Hal Ashby is very welcome."
