She began her journey towards stardom at a very young age, dabbling in various artistic disciplines, including singing, acting, and filmmaking. She moved to Los Angeles with her mother and sister, immersing herself in the world of entertainment. By the tender age of six, she became the youngest student ever to attend the prestigious American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. Larson's acting career took off with a string of television appearances, but it was her role in the indie film Short Term 12 that truly catapulted her into the spotlight. Her portrayal of a supervisor at a group home for troubled teenagers earned her critical acclaim and showcased her ability to deliver nuanced performances. However, it was her performance in the 2015 drama Room that solidified her status as a leading lady. Playing the role of a woman held captive with her son for years, Larson's performance was universally lauded, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition to her acting prowess, Larson has also proven her mettle behind the camera. She made her directorial debut with the independent comedy-drama Unicorn Store. The film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, further highlighted Larson's multifaceted talents. Beyond her film career, Larson is known for her activism and advocacy for gender equality and sexual assault survivors.

Born in 1969 in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Zachary Knight Galifianakis hails from Greek heritage. His early years were spent in the backwoods of his hometown, where he developed a keen interest in performing arts. His initial career path, however, led him to pursue a degree in Communication at North Carolina State University, but he did not graduate, choosing instead to move to New York City to follow his passion for stand-up comedy. The Big Apple served as a perfect platform for Galifianakis's unique brand of humor, characterized by its offbeat, deadpan delivery. He found his niche in the late 1990s, becoming a regular on the Boston Common, an NBC sitcom. However, it was his breakthrough role in the Comedy Central Presents special in 2001 that catapulted Galifianakis into the limelight. Following this, he kept his momentum going with appearances in films like Out Cold and Corky Romano, and a host of television shows such as Reno 911! and Jimmy Kimmel Live. The year 2009 marked a turning point for Galifianakis when he was cast in the blockbuster movie The Hangover. His portrayal of the eccentric and unpredictable Alan Garner earned him critical acclaim and popular recognition. The success of The Hangover spawned two sequels, solidifying Galifianakis's position as a heavyweight in Hollywood's comedy scene. Beyond his acting exploits, he also created and hosted the Emmy Award-winning web series Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis. Despite his rise to fame, Galifianakis has maintained a low-key personal life, residing on a farm in North Carolina with his wife and two children. His journey from a small-town boy to a global comedy sensation is a testament to his immense talent and relentless pursuit of his passion.\n\nJulie Andrews, born Julia Elizabeth Wells on October 1, 1935, in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England, is a revered figure in the world of entertainment known for her distinctive four-octave voice and her roles in some of the most iconic films of all time.
