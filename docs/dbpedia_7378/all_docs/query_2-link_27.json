When they try to decide what to do next, Pam proposes they take off their clothes in get in bed together. While Pam slips off to the bathroom to disrobe, Chris strips and finds Randy Quaid in one of the beds who asks him to sleep in the other bed and starts to discuss his films before being cut off by Chris. When the kids are discovered by Jerome and Peter, Peter's admonishment of Chris causes Jerome to re-evaluate his feeling of Pam and Chris dating and he relents. As Randy Quaid stirs, Peter proposes to Jerome that they kill him."
