Henry Baldwin (born Jan. 14, 1780, New Haven, Conn., U.S.—died April 21, 1844, Philadelphia) was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1830–44).

Baldwin graduated with honours from Yale University in 1797 and studied law, subsequently opening his practice in Pittsburgh. He was elected to the first of three terms to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1816. He was a supporter of protective tariffs and played a leading role in Florida treaty negotiations before ill health forced him to resign in 1822.
