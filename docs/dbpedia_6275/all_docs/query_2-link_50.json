        "text": "SMALL POINT – “Bunny” Terry passed away peacefully in his favorite place, Small Point, Maine, on May 6, 2024, from complications due to cancer. He was 84 years old.\n\nBunny was born on Nov. 13, 1939, in Laurel Hollow on Long Island, N.Y. to Barbara and H.P. Baldwin Terry. He graduated from St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H. in 1958 and attended Yale where he graduated in 1962 with a B.A. in History.\n\nOn June 15, 1963, Bunny made the wisest decision of his life when he married the patient Lane Macleod, who fell for the charming, funny, twinkle-eyed Bunny when they were in high school. After marrying, he and Lane moved to Canton, Conn. living on Morgan Road for close to 50 years. There they raised their three sons, Porter, Marshall (Micky), and Grey. Bunny worked for a handful of insurance and other businesses as a stockbroker, including Hartford National Bank, E.F. Hutton, Stone and Webster, Connecticut General, and Westminster School. After retiring, Lane and Bunny eventually sold their home in Canton, Conn. and relocated permanently to Topsham, and eventually to their beloved Small Point year-round.\n\nBunny was a loving and lovable family man, and often a cantankerous husband to Lane for 60 years, until her death in 2022. Bunny was a solid and reliable father to his three sons who gifted him with five granddaughters. The entire family gathered every year in Bunny and Lane’s favorite place, Small Point, where Bunny had spent most of his summers since childhood. He had an unwavering loyalty to his family, also extended to his many friendships which lasted as long as his marriage – a lifetime. His loyalty matched that of his many dogs which might explain why he had such a fondness for them; he owned almost a dozen in his lifetime.\n\nHe and his wife Lane were big supporters of the communities in which they resided, often volunteering to help out or taking in a family member or friend who needed extra support through the years. Bunny and Lane also loved supporting the arts – proven by the collection of art by artist friends proudly displayed like a gallery on every inch of their seaside home. Bunny was also a true lover of the outdoors – he was an avid fisherman and hunter and made sure his sons enjoyed the same during many excursions to their family fishing camp in Canada. Whether it was catching fish, tending a garden, or walking his dogs on the beach, being outside was a large part of Bunny’s favorite past-times.\n\nBunny’s New England uniform of a loose collared shirt, khakis and blucher moccasins made it easy for him to be prepared for any activity he enjoyed over his lifetime, including: fishing, hockey, lawnmower kicking, tennis, maple syrup making, dog walking, snowshoeing, drain pipe kicking, boating, faulty sprayer Windex bottle throwing, hunting, driving fast, eating Tums, and enjoying the company of his wife, sons, granddaughters, friends, extended family, caregivers, neighbors, and dogs on his porch in Small Point.\n\nBunny is survived by his three sons and their spouses, H. Porter B. Terry III and Carol Smith Terry, Marshall “Micky” MacLeod Terry and Kristin Lesser Terry, Grey Mason Terry and Joey Lynn DeMeo Terry; his five granddaughters, Grace Faulkner Terry, Anna Townsend Terry, Hannah Lesser Terry, Lilli Catherine Terry and Boden Grey Terry; and his younger brother, Walter Grey Terry and his spouse Allyson Terry.\n\nA celebration of Bunny’s life will be held in Phippsburg at 11 a.m. Saturday, July 27 at Phippsburg Congregational Church with a reception to follow at the Small Point Club at 64 Club Rd. in Phippsburg.\n\nIf you tell this joke, please give Bunny credit: “Where does a pirate keep his buccaneers? Under his buccan-hat.”\n\nIn memory of Bunny please take a walk on the beach or in the woods, preferably with your dog, and preferably with that dog off leash. You can also send donations to\n\nThe McLanathan-Phippsburg\n\nFire and Rescue Fund,\n\nP.O. Box 87,\n\nPhippsburg, ME 04562"
