        "text": "Loammi Baldwin Jr.'s extraordinary abilities as an expert civil engineer brought him governmental and corporate projects up and down the East Coast. Local governments funded two trips to Europe during which he explored large-scale engineering projects.1 Praise from his own era rings down through the years; Baldwin is still seen as \"the Father of Civil Engineering in America.\"2\n\nLoammi Baldwin Jr. grew up in Woburn, Massachusetts, where the Baldwin family had deep roots. The Baldwins were among the first to settle in Woburn, incorporated in 1640, and had social status and political and economic influence.3 Loammi Baldwin Jr. attended the then-private Westford Academy4 and graduated from Harvard College in 1800. His studies of mechanical subjects were unusual and were not offered at Harvard. His nuclear family begged to differ with Harvard on the importance of civil engineering. Baldwin Jr., starting at age 14, and his four older brothers worked with their father on the ten-year project of constructing the Middlesex Canal, a 27-mile (44-kilometer) barge canal connecting the Merrimack River with the port of Boston.5\n\nAfter a three-year stint as a lawyer in Groton and in his own office in Cambridge, Baldwin Jr. returned to engineering. With explorations of England's public works financed by the City of Boston under his belt, in 1807 he opened an engineering office in Charlestown.6 There, as chief engineer working for the military and with the rank of Colonel, he focused on projects for the US Navy.7 The US Navy believed Baldwin Jr. could assist with tightening up coastal defense as they prepared for a pending war. The US Navy needed expert civil engineers who could design modern shipbuilding facilities that would make possible modern Naval defense and shipbuilding along the East Coast.8\n\nOne of Loammi Baldwin Jr.'s earliest engineering works for the military was Fort Strong (1814). He led the design and construction of this earthwork on Noddle's Island, one of the strong forts in Boston Harbor for defense against the British Navy during the War of 1812.9 Boston and other cities invited him to take part in many important engineering projects in the community and elsewhere.10\n\nAfter the war ended, in July 1816, Baldwin Jr. married Anna Williams of Salem.11 She joined him at his Charlestown domicile, built on Main St. in 1807.12\n\nIf he had not been known to Boston's male leadership networks due to his father's role in the long Middlesex Canal project, by 1825 Loammi Baldwin Jr.'s own performance would have opened the door for him. In that year, he was asked to join the Bunker Hill Monument Association (BHMA), which recognized and praised his contributions to the planning of the Monument's construction.13 Baldwin Jr.'s skills as a civil engineer were needed to plan, design, and execute construction of the Bunker Hill Monument. Straightaway, he recommended an obelisk form, and then supported the concrete design submitted by architect Solomon Willard.14\n\nBesides his involvement in this Bostonian civilian project, in 1827 Loammi Baldwin Jr. accepted an appointment from the United States to design and construct the naval dry docks at Charlestown, as well as at Norfolk, Virginia. Before he accepted the US Navy’s commission to design and construct the dry docks, however, Baldwin Jr. insisted on complete and unrestricted control of the projects, which the Navy granted.15 His Charlestown Dry Dock 1, built 1827-1833, can be visited at the Charlestown Navy Yard. It is still in use today, albeit enlarged several times since Loammi Baldwin Jr. supervised its construction.16 As a three-sided basin filled with, then drained of, water, a dry dock is an ingenious solution for the challenge of repairing a ship's underside. Baldwin engineered an intricate complex of masonry, engines, pumps, reservoir, tunnels, culverts, valves, and gates—in effect a huge well-coordinated machine. The Charlestown and the Norfolk Dry Docks were the first such naval structures in the United States.17 By 1833, Baldwin Jr.'s engineering skills were in demand; up and down the East Coast, he led all manner of large-scale projects that supported internal improvements the cities and companies were undertaking at that formative period in the United States.18\n\nIn 1828, Loammi Baldwin Jr. married Catherine Beckford of Charlestown, his first wife having died in 1821.19\n\nBaldwin Jr. died at Charlestown, Massachusetts on June 30, 1838, at the age of fifty-eight, about a year after he suffered a paralytic stroke. He was buried in his hometown of Woburn.20 There, he is a well-remembered local hero. His descendants and the Middlesex Canal Association's museum keep the community interest alive. The USS Constitution Museum has brought his memory back into the national foreground, honoring the feat of his Dry Dock 1 construction in 2015 when the USS Constitution entered it for repair.21\n\nFootnotes"
