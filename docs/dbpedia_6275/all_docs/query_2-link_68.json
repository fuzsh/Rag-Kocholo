The original Company L became the 4th N. Y. Volunteer Battery in October, 1861. In January, 1864, 205 enlisted men of the Enfants Perdus and two officers and forty enlisted men of the 4th N. Y. Volunteer Battery were assigned to the regiment by transfer; Company L was reorganized of men of the 4th Battery and Company M in April, 1864, from recruits in the field. Company M was, however, not fully organized until April, 1865, up to which time the uncompleted company was commanded by details of officers of other companies. At the expiration of its term of service the men entitled thereto were discharged and the regiment continued in the service.\n\nThe companies were recruited principally: A, B, D, H and L at New York city; C at Athens, Hudson and Cooperstown, Newark, N.
