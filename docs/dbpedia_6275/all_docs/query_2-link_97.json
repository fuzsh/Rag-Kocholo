        "meta_description": "Henry Ives Baldwin (1896-1922) was born in Saranac Lake, New York. After graduating from Yale University in 1919, he acquired his Master’s degree from the Yale Forestry School in 1922, studied at the Swedish Forestry School from 1923-1924, and received his PhD in Botany from Yale in 1931. Baldwin was a forester for the Brown Company of Berlin, N.H. and later became the state of New Hampshire’s first Research Forester at the Caroline Fox Forest in Hillsborough, a position he held for over thirty years. The Henry Ives Baldwin Collection contains correspondence and information relating to forestry, ecology, environmental organizations, meeting files on these subjects, skiing history, published works and manuscripts written by Baldwin, as well as photographs, slides and other visual materials.",
