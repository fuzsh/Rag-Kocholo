        "meta_description": "Gerard Baldwin, 89, passed away in the night of April 18th, 2018 surrounded by loved ones in Kingwood, Texas. Born the youngest of five on January 7th, 1929, Gerard was a bit of a surprise to Irish-Catholic Harold and Margaret (McGrath) Baldwin.  Growing up in depression-era New York City, his precociousness and creativity irritated countless nuns in school.  Taught to draw from an early age by his older brother Jack, upon graduating high school he studied at Chouinard Art Institute.  After honorably serving in the Army during the Korean War, Gerard had a successful career in southern California as an artist - animating, directing, and producing cartoon characters beloved around the world.  He brought to life countless personalities from programs including Mr. Magoo, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Yogi Bear, the Flintstones, culminating with Emmy Award-winning work on the Smurfs.   Gerard moved with his family to Kingwood in 1989, and had a second career passing on his extensive knowledge as a popular drawing instructor at Lone Star college.  Unceasing in ambition and creativity, Gerard never retired; he published a memoir, wrote essays, and created drawings and paintings until the end. Gerard is survived by his wife of 36 years, Frances, his four children, Leslie, Michael, Alison, and John, and his grandchildren, Audrey, Robert, and Julian.",
