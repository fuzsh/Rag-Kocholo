        "text": "(1780–1844). U.S. lawyer and politician Henry Baldwin was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1830 to 1844. During his tenure his legal opinions were wide-ranging and unpredictable.\n\nBaldwin was born on Jan. 14, 1780, in New Haven, Conn. He graduated from Yale University in 1797 and studied law, subsequently opening his practice in Pittsburgh. In 1816 he was elected to the first of three terms to the U.S. House of Representatives. He was a supporter of protective tariffs and played a leading role in Florida treaty negotiations before ill health forced him to resign in 1822."
