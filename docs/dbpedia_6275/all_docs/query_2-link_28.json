        "text": "Obituary of Henry Edward Baldwin\n\nHenry Edward Baldwin, better known to friends and family as Eddie, passed away at home on March 18, 2023. He was 36 years old.\n\nBorn in Newburgh, NY to Shirley Magee Baldwin and Henry Scott Baldwin, brother to Evelyn Baldwin, the family lived across the United States–from Kenosha, WI to Richmond, VA–before moving to Singapore in 1996. There, Eddie attended the International Community School, where he graduated in 2004. Although he subsequently returned to the U.S., Eddie considered Singapore his home, and it held a special place in his heart.\n\nEddie attended the College of William and Mary, where he majored in English and graduated with summa cum laude in 2008. During his time at William and Mary, Eddie spent a semester studying with Advanced Studies in Bath, England where he met fellow student, Anneke Demarest.\n\nFollowing his college graduation, he moved to New Jersey and earned a Master’s Degree from Montclair State University. He and Anneke were engaged on a return visit to Bath and married in Hope, NJ in 2010.\n\nEddie began teaching at Bergenfield High School in 2010, which he especially appreciated for its welcoming and diverse community. He deeply valued the relationships he built with students, his fellow teachers and administrators in his years at BHS. He was very proud of his students' many accomplishments and was honored to receive their trust and provide them with support and encouragement in all they undertook.\n\nHe began teaching AP English at BHS but over time, extended the curriculum by adding a class in AP Human Geography and leading the creation of a three year AP Capstone program. He began the Quizbowl Club, Culinary Club, and helped establish BHS’s eSports Team. His connection to his students included his attendance at countless high school sports matches, concerts and performances as well as through college recommendations, graduation notes, lunchtime chats and afterschool pickleball matches.\n\nEddie made travel a key facet of his life. He visited 44 countries from Iceland to Fiji including far-flung reaches such as the Maldives, Bhutan and Tonga. He enjoyed experiencing and sharing new cultures and cuisines often connecting with people all over the world through a shared love of soccer. At home, he enjoyed spending time with friends, games of all kinds, cooking, writing and trivia."
