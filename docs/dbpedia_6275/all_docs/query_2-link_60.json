        "text": "Baldwin Pleasant Jennings, Jr., 86, a resident of Staunton, passed away on Thursday, December 21, 2023, at Brookdale Staunton.\n\nHe was born on December 2, 1937, in Staunton, and was the son of the late Baldwin Pleasant, Sr. and Lois Estelle Dice Jennings.\n\nBaldwin was a student of the Staunton school system and graduated from Blue Ridge Community College in Weyers Cave.\n\nHe joined the United States Air Force in 1955, serving over five years in Vietnam. He was heavily decorated - most specifically with the Bronze Star with Valor device and many other awards. He retired after twenty years of service in 1975.\n\nAfter his military service, he worked and retired from the Virginia State Prison System.\n\nBaldwin loved Staunton and did much to improve the beauty of the town, most notably, Staunton's beautiful Avenue of Trees, brick sidewalks, improvements to Gypsy Hill Park and the Fairgrounds, and the Big Dig - downtown Staunton's transition from their network of above-ground utility cables to its current underground network. He also actively attended most Staunton City Council meetings for the last fifty years.\n\nHe is survived by his stepson, Don Hudgins; his brother, Donald Derwood Jennings, Sr. and his wife, Eleanor and their four children; his nieces and nephews, Donald, Jr., Ronald, Teresa, and Jeffrey; his great-nieces and nephews, Christopher, David, Andrew, Luke, Jeffrey, Jr., Justin, Sarah, and Rachel; and his great-great-nieces and nephews, Camila, Cailyn, Christian, Paxton, Cole, Landon, Beckett, and Millie.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he is preceded in death by his wife, Lois Jean Curry Jennings.\n\nA family and friends \"goodbye meeting\" will be held at Henry Funeral Home in Staunton on Wednesday, December 27, 2023, from 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM, where his many friends will be welcomed.\n\nBaldwin will be inurned at Thornrose Cemetery in Staunton."
