        "text": "Henry David Baldwin, 88, of Baltimore, OH passed away Wednesday July 24th at Pickering Hospice House. He was a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather. Henry had many hobbies, he enjoyed making things. He built his home with little help, crafted furniture and various other things. Many would say “if Henry couldn’t fix it, it couldn’t be fixed.” He also played the guitar and even built a guitar and banjo from scratch! He was a retiree of the Columbus Fire department, and he genuinely loved his job as well as the people he worked beside. Henry was as fantastic cook and to this day is known as one of the best cooks the fire department ever had. His carrot cake and pies were thought to be top quality and he often made them to share with others. Henrys love for God was not measurable. He prayed daily and attended Freewill Baptist Church in Reynoldsburg faithfully. In previous years Henry had volunteered at Fairfield Medical Center and was volunteering at the Baltimore Food Pantry up until the very end.\n\nHenry is survived by his daughter Beverly Rose Baldwin, grandchildren Rebecca Marjory, Benjamin Joseph Woodward, Daniel Jacob Woodward (Chelsea), and Megan Renee Baldwin. Great grandchildren Braydin Lee Geer, Parker Bruce Woodward, and Coner James Woodward. He is also survived by siblings Anna Marie (Jim), Judith “Judy” Hensley, Samuel “Sam” Baldwin, James “Jimmy” Baldwin (Vera), Charles Franklin, Michael “Mike” (Cheryl), Nancy Rose Parsley, Richard, Patricia “Trish” Hall, Stephen “Steve” (Judy), Jonathan “Jon” (Bunny), Louise Sturgill, and Alice Rebecca Bently. He also had many nieces and nephews whom he loved dearly. Henry is preceded in death by his wife Rose Edna, he thanked God every day for their 60 years together, his daughter Sharon Renee Woodward (Del), son Ricky David Baldwin (Wendy), mother Mary Collins, father William Henry Baldwin, siblings Mary Elizabeth Flood, Leona, Bernice Thacker, Paul Douglas, Susan Newsome, and brother Joseph.\n\nA memorial service will take place on Thursday, August 1, 2024 at 3 PM in the JOHNSON-SMITH FUNERAL HOME, 207 S Main St., Baltimore, OH 43105. Family and friends may visit from 1-3 PM before the service on Thursday.
