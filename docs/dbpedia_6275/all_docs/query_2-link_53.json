        "text": "Vernon Lee Baldwin age 84, returned peacefully to his Heavenly Father surrounded by his family at Kolob Regional in Cedar City, Utah on April 19, 2015. He was born January 7, 1931 to Louis Henry Baldwin and Lila Boggs Baldwin in Ramona, CA. In 1959, he married Marilyn Lorraine Cole in Ramona, CA. They lived in Ramona for 6 years when they moved to Montrose, CO. where he began working for his brother Jack Baldwin at his Mayflower Moving Company. A year later they moved to Aztec, NM. and the next year to Bloomfield, NM., where they remained for seven years until moving to Milford, UT. After several more moves, they landed in Orem, Utah where they stayed until moving to Cedar City to live with daughter Marilee and son in law, Ron Lowe. Vernon was also raised in Ramona during the depression. His family owned a dairy ranch during these years so he said they never hurt for food as many people did. He related that a couple of times a week, his mother would fill saddlebags full of milk, cheese, produce, bread and anything she could think of and send him around on his horse to neighbors that were in need. Both his parents were generous with what they had, and Vernon acquired this generosity. He was always so happy to be able to help out in any way he could. As his brothers were much older than he, it fell to him to help his parents run the dairy while they were away at war. He learned to work hard. Vernon followed in his brother’s footsteps and volunteered for the Korean War. He served his tour of duty in the United States Air Force. Each son served in a different branch of service. Richard served in the Army during WWII and Jack the Navy also, WWII. Their mother, out of love and pride in her sons and country held the record for the most blood donated by any one American during both WWII and the Korean War. All of Vernon’s jobs involved driving truck. If it had multiple gear shifts and a clutch, he could drive it. He loved to drive truck. He loved to hunt and fish and spent some very memorable hunting trips with his father in (his father’s) later years. Vernon joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints while they lived in Bloomfield. He did not become seriously active until his later years but when he did he made up for lost time by doing hundreds of hours of family genealogy. He became quite proficient and was called to assist in the Genealogy Center assisting others. He loved this. He also gained a love for the temple and went as often as he could. He also gained a strong testimony of his Heavenly Father and Savior, Jesus Christ. He loved his family and developed a special relationship with his great grandson, Michael. He was survived by his wife Marilyn until her death on December 31, 2016. He is also survived by his older brother Richard L. Baldwin (Helen) and his second oldest brother, Jack W. Baldwin (Coleen) who passed away on October 31, 2016. - He is also survived by son, George E. Baldwin (Christine), Grand Junction, CO, Venita L. Baldwin, San Francisco, CA, Ardith L. Turner, Pocatello, ID, Marilee L. Lowe (Ron), Cedar City, UT. Grandchildren, Marie Baldwin, Kimberly Baldwin, Auralia Davis (Royden), Nathaniel Schmall, Tyffanee Snyder (Jason), Brendon Lowe (Taylor), Bretten Lowe, and Alyssa Lowe, eleven great grandchildren and one great great grandchild. He is preceded in death by his parents. His memorial will be held in conjunction with Marilyn’s funeral on January 13, 2017 in the Cedar West Stake Center, 725 West 1100 South Cedar City, UT at 12:00. His ashes will be interred with Marilyn at the Beaver Cemetery, Beaver, UT. Arrangements are made under the direction of Hughes McArthur Mortuary, 2071 North Main Street Ste 1, Cedar City, UT., (435) 867-5566. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the family for burial expences at 1053 S. Cedar Knolls W. Cedar City, UT 84720"
