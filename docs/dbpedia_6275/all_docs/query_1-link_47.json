        "text": "Henry “Harry” Alexander Baldwin was born on January 12, 1871, the oldest of H.P. and Emily Baldwin’s eight children. As recounted by granddaughter, Maizie Sanford, Harry felt the responsibility of being first born in his family. He taught his siblings to swim, pushing them out with a bamboo pole so they would “practice more.” He saddled his father’s horse every morning and helped care for the family animals.\n\nIn 1886, he attended Punahou in Honolulu, an education cut short due to his love of horses. One stormy night, he brought his horse into the dormitory hall for shelter, which unfortunately resulted in his expulsion. He finished high school at Andover Academy in Massachusetts and went on to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He graduated from MIT in 1894 and returned to Maui to start his career at Ha‘ikū Sugar Plantation. In 1897, he married Ethel Smith, having had to wait two years until she turned 17, in order to gain proper permission from her parents to allow the union. They had three children, two of whom died quite young.\n\nBy 1904, Harry was manager of Maui Agriculture Company and had a number of other business enterprises, such as Maui Publishing Company, parent company of the Maui News. In 1911, upon his father, H.P. Baldwin’s death, Harry was named president of Haleakalā Ranch Company, a position he held for 35 years. He later named his youngest brother Sam as manager in 1916.\n\nIt was under Harry’s leadership that the ranch ventured into the pineapple industry, eventually splitting Maui Pineapple Company from the ranch. Harry also worked with Angus McPhee to open a cattle operation on Kaho’olawe Island.\n\nHaving taken over the H.P. Baldwin Trust after his father died, Harry helped the island philanthropically, supporting such causes as the Kula Sanatorium, Makawao Union Church, and the Baldwin Boys Home. Harry was very well liked. It was said of him that he wouldn’t turn down helping anyone “except wife beaters.” It was also said that he wouldn’t fire anybody unless you mistreated a horse or a dog or a woman."
