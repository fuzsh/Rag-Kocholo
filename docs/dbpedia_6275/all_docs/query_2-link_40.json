I will always remember how engaging and fun and knowledgeable his class was and out of all the AP classes, this was my favorite one ever. Just to name a few cool and funny moments out of so many as well as his general approach to class...he played \"Hard in Da Paint\" by \"Waka Flocka Flame\" and \"Big Pimpin'\" by Jay-Z to teach us lessons...he let us actually act out plays within the classroom...he brought a cake to class that said \"YOLO\"...he jokingly told us to behave when the principal was coming to watch our class and he let us joke back with him...he once asked us to name different sports and then roasted some of those sports...he brought a lot of humor to the authors and books he assigned to us...he went beyond traditional literature and introduced us to more diversity and justice...he made class different every day, whether through putting us in groups or having us read out loud or having time to edit our work...he communicated a lot with us and checked in often, both academically and personally. On Tuesday, February 7, 2012 at 9:45pm, he sent our class this email that I still have saved and want to share: \"Hi all, So I’ve noticed that lately everyone looks exhausted and worn down; I can see it on the face of most people at school, teachers and students. Maybe it is a universal February feeling. Everyone needs encouragement this time of year, but you all especially deserve it. I don’t think I’ve ever had, on average, a harder working group of students. Everyday, when I come to school, you all make me proud. I know I work you hard, and it can seem overwhelming at times, but ultimately I’m only trying to prepare you for what next year is going to look like. Still, you deserve a breather. I’m extending your Brave New World essay deadline to the week after the February break. That will be Wednesday the 22nd. You also will have no reading over that break as well, so hopefully everyone can come back a bit refreshed. Keep up the good work. -Mr. Baldwin\" This is just one of the many times he looked out for all of us and was so understanding without question and with so much compassion. He did this often. There were also moments in class where I noticed he stood up for really serious issues. When a student laughed about something really triggering that should have been taken seriously, Mr. Baldwin noticed the reactions from some of us and shut it down. When we were open about struggling with homework or assignments or life in general, he listened and took our feedback seriously, and considered our needs. On a lighter note, Mr. Baldwin often let me eat snacks in his class. On another lighter note, I often tried to make funny comments in class and I still remember Mr. Baldwin either shaking his head or laughing in response. There were days I cried or was stressed in his class from things not even related to AP Lit and Comp but he made the classroom feel like a safe space for all of us. I shared about my mental health issues with Mr. Baldwin through essays and in person. I still have a lot of those essays from 12th grade because the topics and his comments were so special to me. When my phone was stolen, though it seems so silly and trivial now, Mr. Baldwin was understanding of how much stress it caused a high school teen and made an exception for my quiz that day. There were other instances where I was slow with edits and revisions and homework assignments and he was more than gracious about extending the deadlines and giving me lots of guidance throughout the processes. I have another email saved from Monday, January 23, 2012 at 12:31pm: \"Thank you for being an advocate for your success; I'm really glad that you are engaged and on top of things. I looked for you on Friday 4th period to go over your essay; I'm sorry I couldn't look it over earlier; the gallery took up my time. Best, Mr. Baldwin\" I will always be thankful for Mr. Baldwin's memory and for being so patient with me being overly involved and running around in high school because he still made himself available and followed up, making sure I was succeeding in academics first and foremost and meeting me where I was at with my learning disabilities. Somehow, he always scheduled time for me and other students and somehow, he knew how to support various learning abilities, even if I didn't have the official paperwork and accommodations back then. When I was applying to college, Mr. Baldwin held hours after school in the library for extra support. He had a lot of these after school sessions and was really there for us throughout the college application process. He looked over my resume and essay. He also wrote my letters of recommendation. I procrastinated throughout my college application process but he never made me feel bad about it. I ended up getting into Penn State and still referred to how much I loved his class in later English classes I was in. He not only helped me as a student in his class but as a student juggling music, dance, sports, community service, and applying to college. He really saw me for me and knew all of the activities, clubs, and organizations I was passionate about. He knew so much about us in and outside of the classroom and gave us the confidence to believe in ourselves and our capabilities. Recently, when I was reviewing college applications, I saw Mr. Baldwin write so many letters of recommendation for students. I kept telling myself I was going to reach out to him eventually and that I was so excited to see his name. I didn't. I'm trying not to be upset at myself for not doing so. Knowing that Mr. Baldwin continued to advocate for students so earnestly is not surprising and all the more reason why losing him is so painful. One of my most distinct memories was of Mr. Baldwin's bravery. During the induction ceremony for various honor societies, he was the keynote speaker. He actually shared in his speech his diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. His specific example was if he were to hear something bad about a bank in the news. it would make him feel like he would have to take care of all his finances and withdraw all the money in an emergency. I remember he chuckled as he shared it and I remember how much I related to that very specific example. As someone who was dealing with severe anxiety, depression, and OCD without treatment and without having disclosed it to many others at the time, I totally got what he meant. I was also so shocked that he shared something so vulnerable with such a public audience. But the shock later became an inspiration. After that moment I became more open about my own mental health, with him and with others. I still think about that speech from time to time, when I go back and forth about mental health advocacy and being outspoken about it. Mr. Baldwin was the first person who taught me to be brave and open about mental health issues and take care of mental health in general. Mr. Baldwin was a teacher who was caring and involved and kind and passionate and so much more beyond that. There are so many things I could say about Mr. Baldwin teaching me, helping me, inspiring me, and supporting me. I know so many Bergenfield students that can say the same. Whenever I was asked who my favorite teacher was, whether online answering questions or in person talking to other Bergenfield students and other educators, the answer was and is Mr. Baldwin. I am keeping Mr. Baldwin's wife and family in my thoughts and prayers with so, so much love. I hope that these stories of his impact and legacy bring up fond memories and happiness. Mr. Baldwin, you did more than enough. Rest easy and rest in peace. <3. - Kirsty Nicole Bocado, Bergenfield High School, Class of 2012\n\nS\n\nSusan Lawrence uploaded photo(s)\n\n/public-file/1423/Ultra/Image_png.png\n\n/public-file/1424/Ultra/Image_png.png\n\nI was Eddie’s English teacher at ICS in Singapore. First laid eyes on him in my classroom in August of 1999 when he was 13 years old and in 8th grade. What a fantastic, fun class that was. Those kids were delightful; they were interesting; they were whip-smart, too. And Eddie was right in the middle of them, friendly and open to all. His sardonic wit would bubble up during class discussions, and though he did not often push himself into the exact center of attention, he made sure he was never too far from it, either. When you teach English, you read a lot of the students’ writings and get to know not only their writing style and thought pattern, but also the person behind the writing. As I taught Eddie through the years, I thoroughly enjoyed his insights into literature, his keen grasp of grammar and English usage, his excellent vocabulary and syntax—by the time he was a high school senior and in my AP English class, Eddie could drop a tight, provoking, critical essay on nearly any topic without breaking a sweat or losing his light touch with words—but man alive, did I ever enjoy the boy himself! He was steady, funny, thoughtful in an understated way, courteous (to all ages and nationalities), and kind. He was the guy you wanted to add to any group to bolster it along, keep it positive, and disarm any negativity. Outside the classroom, Eddie was involved. In everything. Sports. Youth activities. Those Christmas parties (picture included). Theatre. In fact, he had great presence on stage, partly because he never lost his head or dropped a line. “Our Town.” “Arms and the Man.” “The Importance of Being Earnest.” He acted in them all, a very satisfying actor to direct because he had the capacity to grow into his part on stage. When I think back to those years at ICS, it seems to me Eddie was quite happily, though not necessarily noisily, involved in everything, constantly with his friends, laughing, enjoying his youth and energy and a wide variety of interests. I kept track of Eddie, mostly from a distance (he was never one to be chased), as he progressed through college and into the workforce, but we did get to cross paths in January 2008, the last time we got to visit in person. (Picture included.) He was at William & Mary, and we were down visiting relatives, only 20 minutes away. Eddie talked non-stop. I loved it! I got to hear all about his English classes in college, and together we connected some dots from his high school classes, to our mutual delight. I was proud of him and happy for him, as he obviously enjoyed his studies immensely. It was a wonderful visit. He wrote me a few years after that, in 2011. I’ll include portions of it here: “Hi Susan/Mrs. Lawrence, So I generally hate going on Facebook because nostalgia makes me unhappy, but flipping through I saw your name and I felt I needed to let you know...I’m starting my second year of teaching...I’m teaching AP literature and composition at Bergenfield High School. I have a class website if you are interested....I still feel like a fraud, but I must be doing something right because most of my students, and my bosses, are very happy with me, and I won a NJ distinguished early career teacher award. I’m married now, life goes on, but in the quiet moments I miss the old days...All the best to you and your family. -Eddie” I’m sharing so that Eddie’s family, friends, students, and bosses can hear in his own words, written early in his career but not long after his childhood came to a close, that he thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated that childhood and its friendships though the sorrow of parting was hard to carry and sharp to recall, and that he loved and was genuinely amazed by his students as he became a real honest-to-goodness high school teacher, one that his bosses believed could actually do the job. Well. Of course he could. “The voice of God whispers in the heart So softly That the soul pauses, Making no noise, And strives for these melodies, Distant, sighing, like faintest breath, And all the being is still to hear.” --Stephen Crane Rest now, Eddie. I look forward to seeing you again. So very much."
