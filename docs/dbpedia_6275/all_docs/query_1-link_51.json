        "text": "POSTERITY OF EZEKIEL RICHARDSON\n\n49.\n\nHenry Baldwin, eldest son of Henry and Abigail (Fisk) Baldwin, of Woburn, and great-grandson of Ezekiel Richardson,1 by his daughter Phebe, who was Wife of the first Henry Baldwin, all of Woburn; was born in Woburn, Jan. 12, 1692-3; married his first wife May 7, 1717, a second cousin, Mary Richardson,4 born in Woburn, Jan. 10, 1694-5, eldest child of Joseph3 and Mary (Blodget) Richardson, of that town.\n\nHenry Baldwin died July 7, 1739. His widow Mary married Col. John Jones, of Hopkinton, Mass. She died in Shrewsbury, Oct. 25, 1798, in her ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTH YEAR. When she was one hundred years old, her pastor, Rev. Dr. Joseph Sumner, took her to a sleigh-ride. Dr. Sumner himself lived to be eighty-five years old, and died Dec. 9, 1824, having sustained the pastoral office in that town more than sixty-two years.\n\nThe children of Henry and Mary Baldwin, born in Woburn, were:\n\nHenry (Baldwin), b. Feb. 27, 1717-18; m. first, Abigail Butler, of Pelham, N. H. They settled at first in Pelham. and removed thence to Shrewsbury, Mass., about 1750, where they kept a public house. He and his wife were admitted to the church in Shrewsbury in 1773; the wife from the church in Nottingham West, now Hudson. N. H. His mother, after the death of her second husband, Col. John Jones, in Hopkinton, resided with this son in Shrewsbury. They had four sons and five daughters. His first wife died in Shrewsbury, May 23, 1777, aged 57. His second wife was Martha Abbott, widow of Ebenezer Abbott. Henry Baldwin died Nov. 17, 1789, aged 72. [Ward’s Hist. of Shrewsbury.]\n\nNathan (Baldwin). b.

He was judge of probate, brigadier general from 1768 to 1781, afterwards major general; he was also a member of the board of war, and of the supreme executive council of Massachusetts. He was a brother of Col. William Prescott, who commanded in the redoubt on Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775, and of Hon. James Prescott.† Lucy, the sixth child of Hon. Oliver and Lydia (Baldwin) Prescott, was the wife of Hon. Timothy Bigelow, of Medford; and their eldest daughter, Katharine, married Hon. Abbot Lawrence, of Boston.\n\nElizabeth (Baldwin); m.

For this Jackson family, see Jackson’s History of Newton.\n\n* The Jennison Family.\n\nRobert Jennison came from England, probably in the fleet with Winthrop, with m. brother William; settled in Watertown, as early, certainly, as 1636; twice married; died July 4, 1690.\n\nSamuel Jennison, his son, born 1645; married Judith Macomber; passed his life in Watertown; died Oct. 15, 1701.\n\nWilliam Jennison, his son, born in Watertown, April 17, 1676; married Elizabeth Golding, of Sudbury; lived in Sudbury and in Worcester; died Sept.19, 1744; father of Abigail, who married Col.

He came to New England about 1610; settled in Lancaster, of which he was one of the founders. His third son, seventh child, was:\n\nJonas Prescott, born in Lancaster, Mass., June, 1648; lived in Groton. His third son, twelfth child, was:\n\nBenjamin Prescott, born in Groton, Jan. 4, 1695-6; married, June 11, 1718, Abigail Oliver, daughter of Hon.

Oliver Prescott, in the text; grandfather of Judge William Prescott, of Boston, and great-grandfather of William H. Prescott, the historian.\n\n51.\n\nIsaac Baldwin, brother of the preceding; born in Woburn, Feb. 20, 1699-1700; married Mary Flagg, of Woburn, March 24, 1726. They lived in Woburn.\n\nTheir children were:\n\nLuke (Baldwin), b. Dec. 23, 1728.\n\nJeduthun (Baldwin), b. Jan. 13, 1731-2.\n\nNahum (Baldwin), b. May 3, 1734.\n\nIsaac (Baldwin), b. Dec. 12, 1738; he was mortally wounded at the battle of Bunker Hill, and died opposite the house of Col. Royal, in Medford, June 17, 1775.\n\n55.\n\nJames Baldwin, brother of the preceding; born in Woburn, Oct. 19, 1710; married, May 29, 1739, Ruth Richardson,4 born in Woburn, June 17, 1713, daughter of Lieut. Joseph3 and Mary (Blodget) Richardson, of Woburn, and sister of Mary, who married his brother, Henry Baldwin.\n\nThey lived at “New Bridge,” in North Woburn, where his grandfather, Henry Baldwin, settled in 1642. In each succeeding generation some of the family have resided there.\n\nHe died June 28, 1791, aged 81. The wife, Ruth, died a few weeks previous, May 13, 1791, aged 78.\n\nChildren, born in Woburn:\n\nCyrus (Baldwin), b. Nov. 5, 1740; m. Ruth Wilson, of Bedford. He was drowned at Dunstable, Nov. 5, 1790. No children.\n\nReuel (Baldwin), b. Slay 9, 1742; d. Feb. 21, 1745-6, aged 3.\n\nLoammi (Baldwin), b. Jan. 10, 1744-5; m. first, Mary Fowle; second, Margaret Fowle.\n\nReuel (Baldwin), b. June 30, 17,47; m. Oct. 4, 1769, Kezia Wyman. He died April 18, 1775. Children:\n\nReuel, James, Ruth, Josiah.\n\n59.\n\nTheophilus Richardson4 (Ezekiel,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel,1), son of Ezekiel3 and Elizabeth (Swan) Richardson, of Woburn; born there, Jan. 7, 1691-2; married, in Watertown, April 24, 1711, Ruth Swan, daughter of Gershom Swan, probably a relative of his mother’s.\n\nHe lived in Woburn, or perhaps latterly in Stoneham, and died in the autumn of 1723, in his thirty-second year, as is apparent from the inventory. The Probate Record says that “he died at Charlestown—i. e., in Stoneham, then a part of Charlestown—‘Charlestown End’—on his return from his majesty’s service at the eastward.” The explanation is, the Indians in Maine, instigated by Sebastian Rasles, the French and Jesuit missionary at Norridgewock, who was in close correspondence with the governor of Canada, had since the year 1722 been committing great ravages on the English settlements. They had captured nine families at Merry Meeting Bay in June, 1722; had burned Brunswick, and had taken sixteen Massachusetts vessels at Canseau. In the spring of 1723, they ravaged Falmouth, Scarborough, Berwick, Wells, York, and Dover. The government of Massachusetts had sent a force against these savages. Theophilus Richardson was one of the men sent, and died soon after his return. This war lasted till December, 1725, and included the famous “Pigwacket Fight,” in May, 1725.\n\nThe inventory is dated Dec. 12, 1723. It includes only personal estate, and amounts but to Â£13. 19. This shows that the family had become poor. The widow makes oath that this is “all she knows of estate,” and she has to “support herself and five small children, all sick at home of the feaver.” Of the three sons named below, Deacon Nathan Richardson [75], their father’s cousin, was appointed guardian Nov. 30, 1733, and held a small amount of property in trust for them. Col. Edmund Goffe, of Cambridge, was appointed administrator March 23, 1724-5.\n\nRuth, the widow of Theophilus Richardson, was married, April 6, 1726, to Ebenezer Parker, of Stoneham.\n\nThe children of Theophilus and Ruth Richardson were:\n\nMartha,5 b. Feb. 4, 1711-12; m. Ebenezer Thompson, of Reading, Dec. 22, 1736.\n\nRuth,5 b. Sept. 1, 1714; m. April 15, 1735, Josiah Walton, of Stoneham. The record of marriage describes her as “of Stoneham.” In the record of marriage he is said to be “of Reading.” Another document, dated Aug. 11, 1735, describes him as of Stoneham.\n\nEdward,5 b. March 17, 1715-16; m. Abigail Chenery.\n\nRichard,5 b. Nov. 9, 1719.\n\nMoses,5 b. April 8, 1722; m. Mary Prentiss.\n\n60.\n\nEzekiel Richardson4 (Ezekiel,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding, and son of Ezekiel 3 and Elizabeth Richardson; born in Woburn, April 22, 1694; married, at Watertown, Aug. 8, 1717, Lydia Ockington, of Needham. She was probably a daughter or sister of Thomas Ockington, of Watertown.\n\nHe lived in Woburn two or three years after marriage, and then removed to Needham—taken from Dedham, 1711—where he seems to have passed the remainder of his life. He was there certainly in 1722, when his second child was born.\n\n1723, May 17. Benjamin Colburn, of Dedham, husbandman, and Rebekah his wife, for eight pounds, sell to Ezekiel Richardson, of Needham, two parcels of land in Needham, containing five and two acres. [Suff. Deeds, xliv. 113.]\n\n1736-7, Feb. 25. Hezekiah Fuller, of Dedham, yeoman, and Elizabeth his wife, for Â£110, sell to Ezekiel Richardson, of Needham, land in Needham. [Suff. Deeds, ]xi. 238.]\n\n1747-8, Feb. 2. John Fisher, Esq., of Needham, and Elizabeth his wife, for Â£850, old tenor, sell to Ezekiel Richardson, of Needham, tanner, twenty acres of land in Needham. [Suff. Deeds, lxxiv. 200.]\n\nAll these purchases were in a depreciated currency. In 1749, forty-five shillings “old tenor” were given for one Spanish milled dollar. In two years more it was worth nothing.\n\nThe children of Ezekiel and Lydia Richardson were:\n\nTheophilus,5 b. in Woburn, Jan. 26, 1718-19; m. Hannah Chickering.\n\nEzekiel,5 b. in Needham, Aug. 1, 1722. In 1747-8, he was living in Needham, and bought one-fourth acre of land. [Suff. Deeds, lxxii. 70.]\n\nPeter,5 b. in Needham, Jan. 14, 1726-7.\n\n62.\n\nAaron Richardson4 (Ezekiel,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding; born in Woburn, Dec. 16, 1701; married Bethiah ______. They lived in Woburn.\n\nTheir children were:\n\nBethiah,5 b. Nov. 1, 1728; d. June 9, 1738.\n\nAaron,5 b. Dec. 24, 1730; d. June 26, 1738.\n\nPhebe,5 b. April 28, 1733; d. June 1, 1738.\n\nElizabeth,5 b. Sept. 13, 1736; d. May 31, 1738.\n\nBethiah,5 b. Jan. 5, 1738-9; m. her cousin, Amos Richardson, 1762.\n\nPhebe,5 b. June 18, 1741; d. July 16, 1741.\n\nNotice the fearful ravages of death among these children, sweeping off the entire family of children living in the summer of 1738, four in number, in a single month. It was undoubtedly caused by the throat-ail, so fatal in New England in that gloomy year, 1738, and still remembered and spoken of when the compiler was young.*\n\n* The disease originated in the manner now to be described. In May, 1735, a Mr. Clough, of Kingston, N. H., having examined the throat of a swine which had died of a throat disease, was himself suddenly attacked with a swelling of the throat, and lived but a few days. Three weeks after, three children in his neighborhood were attacked in a similar manner, and died in thirty-six hours. From this, the disease spread rapidly and proved fearfully fatal, particularly to children. It extended in all directions, passing through New England and into New York. It was two years in reaching the Hudson River. Between June, 1735, and July, 1736, nine hundred and eighty-four died in fourteen towns of New Hampshire. In this town, Haverhill, Mass., it appeared in October, 1736, and swept off more than one-half of all the children under fifteen years of age. Almost every house became a habitation of mourning. In many families not a child was left. One hundred and ninety-nine fell victims to this terrible scourge in this town, only one of whom was forty years of age. [Chase’s History of Haverhill, pp. 306, 307.]\n\n71.\n\nJohn Richardson4 (John,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel1), eldest son of John,3 and Deborah (Brooks) Richardson, of Woburn; born there, Dec. 29, 1692; married, at Cambridge, July 1, 1714, Abigail Swan, daughter of Gershom Swan.\n\nHe was a “husbandman,” and passed his entire life in Woburn. He died there, Nov. 15, 1745. His will is dated Nov. 7, 1745; proved March 17, 1745-6; recorded Midd. Prob. Rec., xxiv. 132.\n\nHis wife survived him. In his will, he makes his brother [Dea.] Nathan Richardson and his brother John Atwood, both of Woburn, joint executors. John Atwood was doubtless the father of Lydia Atwood, the wife of his son Jasher. Abigail Richardson, Isaac Richardson, and Samuel Tidd are witnesses.\n\nChildren of John and Abigail Richardson, all born in Woburn:\n\nGershom,5 b. May 4, 1715; living March 27, 1746.\n\nAbigail,5 b. May 27, 1718; m. ______ Stevens.\n\nEzra,5 b. June 13, 1721; m. Love ______.\n\nJasher,5 b. Dec. 8, 1724: m. Lydia Atwood.\n\nDeborah,5 b. March 26, 1728; m. Jabez Burdett, Jan. 26, 1749-50.\n\nAbijah,5 b. Jan. 22, 1730-1; m. first, Sarah Stewart; second, Mary Lawrence.\n\nAll living at the date of their father’s will.\n\n72.\n\nDeborah Richardson4 (John,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel1), sister of the preceding; born in Woburn, March 8, 1694-5; married, March 28, 1718, John Kendall,3 born in Woburn, July 8, 1699, youngest son of John2 and Elizabeth (Comey) Kendall, and grandson of Francis Kendall,1 one of the founders of Woburn, and ancestor—it is supposed—of all of the name in New England.\n\nThey lived in Woburn, and had these children:\n\nDeborah (Kendall), b. Feb. 9, 1719.\n\nMary (Kendall), b. March 6, 1721; m. March 20, 1746, Ignatius Marion (Merriam?)\n\nJohn (Kendall), b. April 25, 1723; m. Nov. 12, 1754, Sarah Wyman, of Woburn.\n\nZebedee (Kendall), b. March 30, 1725.\n\n74.\n\nJosiah Richardson4 (John,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding, and second son of John 3 and Deborah Richardson; born in Woburn, Feb. 14, 1700-1; married Phebe _____.\n\nThey lived in Dunstable, N. H. I suppose in that part which now constitutes the town of Litchfield, N. H.*\n\nChildren:\n\nPhebe,5 b. Jan. 19, 1727-8.\n\nJosiah,5 b. Sept. 28, 1729; m. Lucy _____.\n\nLucy,5 b. Oct. 5, 1731.\n\nEunice,5 b. Oct. 13, 1733.\n\n* Old Dunstable is often mentioned in our early history. It included the present Dunstable in Massachusetts and Tyngsboro, with parts of Groton and Dracut; also the towns of Amherst, Merrimack, Litchfield, Dunstable, Nashua, Milford, Hollis, Brookline, Hudson, and part of Londonderry.\n\n75.\n\nDeacon Nathan Richardson4 (John,3 Theophilus,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding, and third son of John and Deborah Richardson; born in Woburn, June 24, 1701; married first, Esther Peirce, daughter of Stephen Peirce, of Chelmsford. She died Nov. 10, 1727, aged 27. By a strange mistake, the gravestone describes her as the widow of Nathan Richardson. Second, July 3, 1729, Tabitha Kendall,3 born Jan. 22, 1706-7, youngest child of Samuel and Mary (Locke) Kendall, of Woburn; granddaughter of Francis Kendall1 and of William Locke,1 who both came from England, and were early settlers in Woburn. She died Nov. 25, 1739, aged 33. [Gravestone.] Third, Lydia Whitemore, of Malden, April 3, 1740. She died May 17, 1776, aged 84. [Gravestone.]\n\nHe lived in Woburn all his days; was a highly respectable and useful man, and often employed on public business. He was selectman 1759, 1760, 1761, 1762, 1763; was chosen deacon April 22, 1761; was one of the committee, chosen 1738, to have care of the town’s “loan money,” that is, money received from the sale of two thousand acres of land in Lunenburg, granted to the town by the General Court in 1644,* but not located till 1717.\n\nThrough neglect and mismanagement, this liberal grant of land proved of no advantage to the town for about seventy years. It served only as an occasion for altercation and strife, especially at the town-meetings. It lay in a wild, uncultivated state, and after 1728, when the town of Lunenburg was incorporated, Woburn had to pay taxes for it to Lunenburg. At length, in February, 1734, the tract was sold to Israel Reed, of Woburn, for Â£3,300. The money was not paid down, but was supposed to be sufficiently secured. Small portions were invested, and small portions were paid from time to time. It passed into the bands of different and successive committees during forty years or more, and at length proved nearly or quite worthless. The depreciation of the “old tenor,” the fictitious currency of Massachusetts, was the principal cause, sixty shillings of which in 1750 were worth only one ounce of silver. But from beginning to end, or nearly so, the management of the fund was extremely, bad, not so much from any want of integrity in the committee, as from their lack of financial ability, and the failure of many to whom the money was loaned from time to time to meet their engagements. [Sewall’s Hist. of Woburn, pp. 283-302.]\n\nNathan Richardson was from time to time appointed by the probate court guardian to sundry individuals, as to Edward, Richard, and Moses Richardson, sons of Theophilus, and to John Richardson, adjudged non compos mentis, June 7, 1736.\n\nHe died Oct. 21, 1775, aged 74. [Gravestone.]\n\nHis children, all born in Woburn, were, by first wife, Esther:\n\nNathan,5 b. April 21, 1725; m. Mary Peirce.\n\nEsther,5 b. Aug. 0, 1727; m. Joshua Peirce, of Woburn. They were published Oct. 27, 1753.\n\nBy second wife, Tabitha:\n\nTabitha,5 b. April 14, 1730.\n\nJohn,5 b. Feb. 5, 1731-2; m. Hannah Richardson, 1753.\n\nAmos,5 b. Nov. 6, 1733; m. Bethiah Richardson, 1762.\n\nJotham,5 b. Oct. 23, 1735; m. Phebe Whittemore, 1759.\n\nMary,5 b. Sept. 7, 1737.\n\n* It is not granted for any public service but to compensate Woburn for its alleged smallness of area. See Sewall’s Hist. of Woburn, pp. 35, 283, et. seq.\n\n103.\n\nMercy Richardson4 (Josiah,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1), daughter of Lieut. Josiah3 and Mercy (Parish) Richardson, of Chelmsford; born there, Jan. 9, 1688-9; married, 1707, Major Ephraim Hildreth, of Dracut.\n\nHe was an active and influential man, first in Chelmsford, then in Dracut; a major in the militia, and otherwise honored. He owned and sold land in Pelham, which had formerly, I believe, been in Dracut.\n\nHe died Sept. 26, 1740. His wife, Mercy, died Dec. 23, 1743, aged 55.\n\nTheir children, born in Chelmsford, were:\n\nThomas (Hildreth), b. 1707; d. Oct. 7, 1707.\n\nEphraim (Hildreth), b. Jan. 18, 1’708-9; m. Mary Clark, of Chelmsford, Feb. 11, 1735-6. He was town clerk, 1763; died Aug. 5, 1769.\n\nJosiah (Hildreth), b. Feb. 14, 1710-11; m. Rebecca Wright, of Dracut; published Dec. 20, 1740; d.

Nov. 27, 1732.\n\n104.\n\nCaptain Josiah Richardson4 (Josiah3, Josiah2, Ezekiel1) eldest son of Lieut. Josiah3 and Mercy (Parish) Richardson,* of Chelmsford; born there, May 5, 1691; married, first, 1712, Lydia ______. She died in childbed, March 28, 1737. Second, Elizabeth French, of Dunstable; published April 1, 1738. She died Dec. 15, 1771.\n\nHe was an active, capable, business man. His name often occurs on the Dracut records. He began to live in that town about 1710, when in his twentieth year. His name is placed against lot No. 10, as taken by him, under date of Jan. 2, 1710, probably 1710-11. At a general town-meeting, held Oct. 27, 1712, leave was granted to him to be a settled inhabitant in the town of Dracut, on the lot which his father—who died Oct. 17, 1711—took up with the consent of the committee of the General Court. This lot, No. 10, was thus bounded: It had Merrimack River on the south; the “Solomon lot” on the west; on the north and east it had marked trees. It was one of the fifteen lots that lay between Mr. Belcher’s farm and Mr. Winthrop’s farm, and near Walker’s Brook, and was “the thirtieth part of the undivided land required in the township of Dracut.” This description shows how sparsely settled Dracut was at that time.\n\nPart of this lot he sold in 1712 to Joseph Richardson, his second cousin, son of Thomas Richardson [135].\n\nMarch, 1714, he was chosen surveyor of highways. March, 1715, chosen fence-viewer. In 1720, one of a committee of three to receive “the money” (what money?) for the town of Dracut.\n\nIn 1728, he was one of the board of selectmen, and again in 1731. In 1749, selectman, assessor, and town clerk; also in 1755 and 1756. In 1752, town treasurer; again in 1753 and 1754.\n\nIn 1749, he is, on the records, I believe for the first time, called “Captain Josiah Richardson.”\n\nIn October, 1749, the town had recently built a meeting-house, and it was voted that the man paying the highest tax on real and personal estate in town should have the first choice of a pew; the man paying the next highest tax the second choice, and so on. Capt. Josiah Richardson had the second choice. The pews were not to be re-sold without consent of the town.\n\nHis will is dated Aug. 17, 1773; proved Dec. 31, 1776. In the will he calls himself “gentleman,” and gives his daughter Hannah Hildreth fifty pounds lawful money, in full of her portion. He then gives to his granddaughter, Sarah Richardson, daughter of his son Josiah Richardson, late of Dracut, deceased, twenty pounds lawful money. Then to his son Ephraim Richardson, Â£36. 13. 4., lawful money, this being the amount of a note signed by the said Ephraiin in favor of the testator; this to be in full of said Ephraim’s portion of the estate. To his son Moses, a deed of land and money. Next, to the children of his son David, late of Dracut, deceased, land and money. Next, to his late son Jonathan, late of Dracut, deceased, land and money. Next, to the children of his second ’daughter, Lydia Cummings, late of Ipswich, deceased, he gives six pounds a piece. Next, to his daughter Mercy Colburn, late of Dracut, deceased, to her children, land and money.\n\nThe remainder of the estate, after the payment of the testator’s just debts and funeral charges, he gives in equal shares to his two executors, Minh Colburn and Obadiah Richardson. Uriah Col-burn [402] was his grandson, son of his daughter Hannah. Obadiah Richardson was also his grandson, son of his son Moses. All this is from a copy of the will, now before me.\n\nThe children of Capt. Josiah and Lydia Richardson were:\n\nLydia,5 b. Nov. 4, 1713; d. same day.\n\nLydia,5 b. Sept. 27, 1714; m. Thomas Cummings, of Ipswich. They were published July 17, 1736. She died Nov. 24, 1753. Children:\n\nThomas, Lydia, Anna, Elizabeth, Rhoda.\n\nHannah,5 b. April 20, 1717; d. Feb. 26, 1717-18.\n\nJosiah,5 b. Dec. 29, 171S; m. Sarah Varnum, of Dracut; published Aug. 11, 1753. He died Feb. 13, 1756. They had:\n\nSarah,6 b. April 29, 1755.\n\nJonathan5 b. Dec. 19, 1720; m. Lucy Clark, of Chelmsford.\n\nEphraim,5 b. Sept. 12, 1722; m. Elizabeth Richardson.\n\nMoses,5 b. May 14, 1724; d. March 21, 1720.\n\nHannah,5 b. Dec. 25, 1725; m. first, Joshua Colburn; second, Elijah Hildreth.\n\nMoses,5 b. June 12, 1728; m. Elizabeth Colburn.\n\nMercy,5 b. Jan. 5, 1729-30; m. Abraham Colburn, jr., of Dracut. They were published Oct. 20, 1753.\n\nDavid,5 b. June 5, 1731; m. Elizabeth Colburn [258].\n\nSamuel,5 b. March 28, 1737; d. March 28, 1740.\n\n* The mother’s name was sometimes written Parris.\n\n105.\n\nRobert Richardson4 (Josiah,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding, and second son of Lieut. Josiah3 and Mercy (Parish or Parris) Richardson; born in Chelmsford, Oct. 2, 1693; married Deborah ______.\n\nThere can scarcely be a doubt that the full name of the wife was Deborah Parish or Parris, for the names were then convertible, and that she was the daughter of Robert Parris, an early settler of Dunstable, or rather of Litchfield, N. H., then a part of Dunstable. The name of their son affords sufficient evidence of the fact.\n\nHe lived some years in Chelmsford, at least till 1724, when, or about that time, he removed to Litchfield, N. H., where his wife’s father lived. He was a grantor of land in Litchfield in 1739.\n\nLitchfield, previously a part of Dunstable, was incorporated as a town July 5, 1734. It then and previously belonged to Massachusetts.\n\nThe country being kept almost constantly in alarm from the fear of hostile visits from the Indians, who often came unexpectedly, it was necessary to be always in a state of preparation for such visits. A large number of men in Dracut and vicinity were kept constantly armed and equipped; and since the Indians might come in winter, as well as summer, these men were supplied with snow-shoes, at the expense of the province. The whole north regiment of Essex County was thus supplied in 1710.\n\nThere were over fifty men thus supplied in the town of Haverhill, then including Methuen, and adjoining Dracut. They were known as “snow-shoe men.”\n\nIn 1725, Robert Richardson had a company of “snow-shoe men,” some of whom went in pursuit of the Indians after the “Pigwacket Fight,” May 8, 1725. They went because they were acquainted with the haunts and habits of the Indians.\n\nRobert and Deborah Richardson bad the children named below before leaving Chelmsford, and probably more afterwards:\n\nPhebe5 b. Feb. 22, 1719.\n\nParish,5 b. Dec. 18, 1724. He was a soldier in the company of Capt. John Hazen, of Haverhill, raised 1758, for the reduction of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. [See Chase’s History of Haverhill, p. 353.] He did not belong to Haverhill, but probably in Litchfield, which was but a few miles distant.\n\nThe town of Hollis, N. H., was included in Dunstable till April 3, 1746, when it was incorporated as a town. It had previously been the West Parish in Dunstable. One of the earliest settlers, if not the very earliest, was Capt. Powers commanded a company made up from Hollis, Dunstable, and the neighboring towns. In this company Timothy Richardson [221] and Luther Richardson [222] were privates. I presume they were sons of Robert Richardson, of Dunstable. The military ardor of the family, if nothing more, justifies the presumption.\n\n106.\n\nCapt. Zachariah Richardson4 (Josiah,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding; born in Chelmsford, February, 1605-6;. married Sarah Butterfield, born Sept. 23, 1701, daughter of Benjamin and Sarah Butterfield. Benjamin Butterfield was one of the founders of Chelmsford.\n\nIn his will, dated March 21, 1776—the day before he died—he styles himself “gentleman,” and gives to wife Sarah the free use and improvement of all his household goods, furniture, and live stock during her natural life, and directs that whatever may remain after her death be “divided equally between all my daughters, or their heirs.” He also makes a bequest to his grandson, Paul Richardson [son of his son Josiah].\n\nHe died March 22, 1776, aged SO. his widow, Sarah, died Aug. 11, 1788, aged 88. [Gravestone.]\n\nThey had twelve children, all born in Chelmsford. The names of two are wanting.\n\nSarah,5 b. Oct. 13. 1719.\n\nZachariah,5 b. Feb. 19, 1721; m. first. Hannah Blodget; second. Sarah Warren.\n\nA name wanting.\n\nBridget,5 b. April 23, 1726; m. Timothy Fletcher.\n\nDeborah,5 b. June 1, 1727; m. 1743. Joseph Farrar, of Chelmsford. They had, between 1743 and 1767, eight children. Among them was John. (Farrar), b. Aug. 16, 1767. They had also Bridget, wife of Wiley Richardson [514.] Their mother died June 30, 1808, aged 51.\n\nLydia,5 b. May 17, 1729; m. Jacob Chamberlain, May 21, 1761. She died May 31, 1775.\n\nMercy,5 b. Feb. 20, 1730-1; d. an. 19, 1745-6. Called Mary in the town record.\n\nJosiah,5 b. May s, 1734; m. Lydia Warren.\n\nRebecca,5 b.

Mr. Spalding died June 30, 1756. [Spalding Memorial.]\n\nChildren:\n\n233½. Lucy (Spalding), b. March 13, 1764; probably m. Thomas Richardson [513].\n\n234. Eli (Spalding), b. March 25, 1771; d. same day.\n\n234½. Phebe (Spalding), b. m. Dec. 28’ 1800, Joseph Butterfield Varnum, of Dracut, b. Sept. 28, 1775.\n\n108.\n\nCapt. William Richardson4 (Josiah3 Josiall,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding, and youngest son of Lieut. Josiah3 and Mercy (Parish) Richardson; born in Chelmsford, Sept. 19, 1701; married, about 1722, Elizabeth Colburn, daughter of Daniel and Sarah Colburn, of Dracut.\n\nHe settled in Pelham, N. H., in 1722, and cultivated a farm there; commenced housekeeping there that year. Pelham was a part of Dracut, but separated from it in 1741, when, by an order of the Privy Council of England, sixteen towns were taken from Massachusetts and annexed to New Hampshire.*\n\nHe was many years captain of a military company. He was also a representative in the General Court of the province.\n\nHis will is dated April 1, 1776; proved Nov. 7, 1776. He died in the interval. It may be found among the probate records of Rockingham County, at Exeter, N. H. He mentions wife Elizabeth, daughter Molly, wife of Jacob Fletcher, and other children as below. Sons Asa and Daniel, executors.\n\nChildren of Capt. William Richardson, born in Pelham, but all recorded in Dracut:\n\nElizabeth,5 b. July 27, 1724; m. Capt. Joseph Butterfield.\n\nAbnet,5 no date given.\n\nMary,5 b. April 15, 1728; m. Capt. Reuben Butterfield. They had Asa (Butterfield) and James (Butterfield). She was living in 1794.\n\nWilliam,5 b. January. 1730-1; was an ensign in a company of soldiers under command of Capt. John Hazen, of Haverhill, raised 1758, for the reduction of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Possibly 1 Mistake the man.\n\nMercy,5 b. June 17, 1736; m. Jacob Fletcher. [In her father’s will she is called Molly. an evident mistake in copying, for besides her there was a Mary, the wife of Reuben Butterfield.]\n\nAsa,5 b. Feb. 23, 1738; he was of Pelham, and was living February, 1794.\n\nSarah,5 b. Feb. 23, 1741-2; m. Benjamin Gage.\n\nHannah,5 b. March 8, 1746-7; m. first, Aug. 4, 1763, Lieut. Timothy Spalding, of Westford; second, Nov. 12, 1795, Joseph Jewett, of Westford.\n\nDaniel,5 b. March 11, 1749; m. Sarah Merchant.\n\n*The charter under which Massachusetts was settled was granted by Charles I , king of England, to sundry persons, on the 19th of March, 1627-8. It conveyed to these gentlemen, well known as the Massachusetts Company, all that tract of land, that portion of the earth’s surface, extending from a point three miles north of the Merrimack River, and every part of it, to a point three miles south of Charles River, and every part of it, mid within these limits from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, or Great South Sea.\n\nWith a view to ascertain the northern limit of this grant, a commission was appointed in 1639 by the government of Massachusetts. The limit was found at the outlet of the Lake Winnipiseogee, where the Merrimack leaves said lake. and where it begins to be the Merrimack. A certain tree three miles north of this was marked as the northern limit of Massachusetts. It is plain as the day-light that this is the true north limit whence the line should run, according to the charter.\n\nOne of the last acts of that profligate and irreligious prince, Charles II., was to annul the charter, and thus deprive the people of Massachusetts of any title to their lands, which were all held under this instrument.. It was a most flagitious and wicked proceeding, though done under the forms of law, in the Chancery Court of England, October, 1685. The rights and liberties of Massachusetts now lay prostrate in the dust. The government of New Hampshire, taking advantage of this unhappy state of things—for the new charter of 1692 did not recognize the old boundaries as established in 1628—after many efforts, continued through a score of years, at length prevailed on the Privy Council of England to issue the order referred to in the text. And thus, by a mere stroke of the pen, Massachusetts was shorn of a large portion of her heritage, of which she had full possession more than a century.\n\n110.\n\nElizabeth Richardson4 (Jonathan,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1), eldest daughter of Capt. Jonathan3 and Elizabeth (Bates) Richardson, of Chehnsford; born there, Oct. 19, 1696; married, 1714, Edward Colburn, of Dracut.\n\nThey lived in Dracut. She died Dec. 10, 1743.\n\nChildren, born in Dracut:\n\nElizabeth (Colburn), b. May 13, 1715.\n\nThankful (Colburn), b. Nov. 23, 1717; m. Benjamin Butterfield, of Dracut, Dec. 8, 1736.

He was a physician.\n\nHe died Dec. 22, 1756. Mrs. Mary Colburn, his wife, died Oct. 28, 1754.\n\nChildren, all born in Dracut:\n\nMary (Colburn), b. June 27, 1718.\n\nSamuel (Colburn), b.

June 3, 1742.\n\n112.\n\nLydia Richardson4 (Jonathan,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1), sister of the preceding; born in Chelmsford, July 14, 1702; married Rev. Thomas Parker, the first minister of Dracut.\n\nHe was born in Cambridge, Dec. 7, 1700, son of Josiah Parker, of that town, who was a son of Capt. James Parker, of Groton. He graduated at Harvard College in 1718; was invited to settle in Dracut, 1720, and accepted the invitation Jan. 30, 1720-1.\n\nDracut, formerly a part of Chelmsford, though the Merrimack divides them, was incorporated as a town Feb. 26, 1700-1. Several attempts were made between 1710 and 1720 to settle a minister, but without success. There was a meeting-house, built in 1715, but no church till the ordination of Mr. Parker. He was pastor there forty-five years, and died March 18, 1765, aged 65.\n\nThe children of Rev. Thomas and Lydia Parker were:\n\nThomas (Parker), b. Oct. 21, 1721.\n\nLydia (Parker), b. Feb. 2, 1723-4; d. young.\n\nLydia (Parker), b. June 10, 1725.\n\nWilliam (Parker), b. Jan. 14, 1727.\n\nElizabeth (Parker), b. Jan. 5, 1729.\n\nLucy (Parker), b. Jan. 5, 1732.\n\nSarah (Parker), b.

The inventory, dated March 18, 1765, includes real estate, Â£440, in lawful money; personal estate, Â£112. 16. 10. The widow, Esther, was living at the date of her son Silas’ will, Aug. 12, 1774. Silas Richardson, the eldest son, was made administrator, and was to have two-thirds of the real estate, after paying certain sums to his brothers and sisters.\n\nThe children of John and Esther Richardson were:\n\nSilas,5 b. Aug. 21, 1734; m. Lydia Fletcher.\n\nEsther,5 b. June 4, 1736; m. Stephen Spalding.\n\nElizabeth, b. March 2, 1738; m. William Adams.\n\nSarah,5 b. April 28, 1740; m. Feb. 12, 1767, John Colburn, jr., of Dracut, son of John and Sarah (Richardson) Colburn [118].\n\nMary,5 b. May 15, 1742; m. ______ Holden.\n\nSybil,5 b. May 19, 1744; m. James French, jr., March 3, 1768.\n\nTabitha,5 b. June 10, 1746; m. Oliver Fletcher, of Chelmsford, Feb. 25, 1766.\n\nJohn,5 b. April 8, 1748; he was of New Ipswich, a joiner. We learn from the will of his brother Silas, or rather from the probate of it, April 18, 1775, that he was then absent; but he perhaps afterwards returned, for the records represent that he died, intestate, previous to Jan. 12, 1785. At that date the probate court appointed a committee to appraise his estate. They returned an inventory Jan. 14, 1785. [Hillsboro’ Prob. Rec., i. 400.] No wife or children are mentioned.\n\nAbigail,5 b. Sept. 23, 1751.\n\nRebecca,5 b. Aug. 19, 1733; m. Francis Davidson, March 11, 1779.\n\nAll the above supposed to be living March 25, 1766, at the settlement of the father’s estate.\n\n123.\n\nHenry Richardson4 (John,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1), younger son of John and Elizabeth (Farwell) Richardson; born Sept. 19, 1714; his birth was in Chelmsford, but in that part of it which in 1729 was incorporated as the town of Westford; married Priscilla Spalding, born July 24, 1713, daughter of Edward and Lydia Spalding, of Chelmsford. Henry Richardson, of Westford, married Ruth Bates, also of Westford, July 12, 1784. Their children’s births are recorded in Westford. We suppose, therefore, that Westford was their home.\n\nChildren of Henry and Priscilla Richardson.\n\nLydia,5 b. Oct. 11, 1735: m. May 21, 1761, Jacob Chamberlain. She died May 31, 1775.\n\nOlive,5 b. April 24, 1742; m. Abel Adams.\n\nLuke.5 b. March 6, 1744; m. Sarah Minot.\n\nElizabeth,5 b. Dec. 12, 1747; m.

They lived in Westford.\n\n130.\n\nEleazar Richardson4 (Samuel,3 Josiah,2 Ezekiel1) youngest son of Samuels and Rachel (Howard) Richardson, of Chelmsford.\n\nHis birth does not appear on the Chelmsford records; but from a comparison of many dates on the town and county records, it must have taken place not far from 1720. The probate court appointed him administrator of the estate “of his other, Samuel Richardson,” May 20, 1754; and the inventory of said estate, dated June 10, 1754, represents him as the only son, that is, the only son living. He married Lydia Perham, born Sept. 24, 1722, daughter of Benoni and Sarah Perham, of Chelmsford.\n\nHe lived in Chelmsford. His will is dated June 24, 1776; proved Oct. 29, 1776. His wife, Lydia, survived him.\n\nTheir children, all born in Chelmsford, were:\n\n293. Lydia,5 b. May 10, 1749.\n\n294. Rachel,5 b. June 14, 1751. These are not mentioned in the father’s will, and probably died young. 295. Sarah,5 b. Oct. 4, 1753; m. Thomas Parker, of Reading, Feb. 4, 1773. 296. Samuel,5 b. Sept. 14, 1756; m. first, Elizabeth Hildreth; second, Amy Fletcher. 297. Oliver,5 b. March 17, 1759; m. Chloe Bancroft. 298. Hannah,5 b. Feb. 17, 1761; m. Thaddeus Monroe, of Hillsborough, N. H., Feb. 17, 1780. 299. Mary,5 b. Aug. 14, 1765; m. May 20, 1793, Lieut. Zebulon Blodget, of Dunstable, by Parker\n\nVarnum, justice of peace. In the town record of marriage she is called Marcy.\n\n133.\n\nJames Richardson4 (Thomas,3 James,2 Ezekiel1), son of Thomas3 and Hannah (Colburn) Richardson, of Dracut; born in Dracut, when it was part of Chelmsford, about 1686; married Mary _______.\n\nDracut became a separate town Feb. 26, 1701, after which they lived in Dracut.\n\nChildren:\n\nMary,5 b. April 9, 1711.\n\nJames,5 b. May 3, 1713; m. Molly Richardson, 1741.\n\nPhilip,5 b. Oct. 1, 1715; m. Eleanor Wood, 1744.\n\nSarah,5 b. July 1, 1717; m. Zachariah Goodhue.\n\nThomas,5 b. March 29, 1719; m. Rebecca Reed.\n\nHannah,5 b. Feb. 25, 1720-1; never married; a veteran school-dame as late as 1789; d. in Dracut, Dec. 25, 1812, aged 92 years.\n\nJohn,5 b. May 16, 1724.\n\nElizabeth,5 b. June 14, 1726; m. Ephraim Richardson [212].\n\nMoses,5 b. June 22, 1728; d. in Pelham, 1755.\n\nLucy,5 b. Dec. 16, 1733.\n\n134.\n\nEâªzekiel Richardson4 (Thomas,3 James,2 Ezekiel1), brother of the preceding; born in Dracut, at that time belonging to Chelmsford, about 1690; married Mary ______.\n\nThey lived in Dracut. Little is known of them.\n\nTheir children, born in Dracut, were:\n\nEzekiel,5 b. Sept. 24, 1714; m. Elizabeth Ditson; published Aug. 25, 1758.\n\nMary,5 b. Feb. 14, 1717; d. Feb. 28, 1717.\n\nEdward,5 b. Jan. 19, 1718-19; m. Sarah Blood. He died, intestate, Sept. 1, 1749, and previous to 1752 the widow, Sarah, m. Israel Mead.\n\nMary,5 b. June 24, 1720.\n\nThe records state that Hannah, sister of Ezekiel Richardson, was supported by the town of Dracut in 1797. Doubtless of this family.\n\nIt is also stated that Capt. Ezekiel Richardson sold his farm to William Adams, husband of Elizabeth Richardson [280], and “moved away.” This must have been about 1758, when William Adams was married, and is likely to have wanted a farm, and when Ezekiel Richardson also was married and wanted a farm. How far he moved is not said, and we are left to conjecture. Perhaps only to Pelham, the adjoining town; and the conjecture derives probability from the fact that not very long after we find an Ezekiel Richardson who died early in 1829, intestate, leaving a widow, Mary, and several children, one of whom was Dorothy, a minor, then over fourteen years of age, whose brother Ezekiel was appointed to be her guardian, Dec. 2, 1829; and she, about a year after or less, was married to James H. Currier, of Pelham. [Hillsboro’ Prob. Rec., xxx. 620; xxiii. 450.]\n\nWe also find that Ezekiel Richardson, of Pelham, who was no doubt son of the other Ezekiel, and guardian as above stated, died, intestate, in 1869, leaving a widow Sybil and a daughter Sybil. [Hillsboro’ Prob. Rec., lxxx. 363.]\n\n136.\n\nBenjamin Richardson4 (Thomas,3 James,2 Ezekiel1), youngest son of Thomas 3 and Hannah (Colburn) Richardson; born in what was then Chelmsford, afterwards the town of Dracut, March 30, 1696; married Eunice ______; perhaps Eunice Hodgdon.\n\nHe lived in Groton, at that time adjoining Chelmsford. In 1748, in a deed to James Gordon, he is said to be of Dunstable. He owned land, June 4, 1753, in Dunstable. The same year, 1753, we also find him in No. 2, N. H., which means Rockingham, Vt., then supposed to be in New Hampshire. It was near Bellows Falls, on Connecticut River.\n\nHis children, recorded in Groton, were:\n\nLydia,5 b. Aug. 9, 1721; m.
