        "text": "Henry Baldwin Hyde, a New York lawyer and onetime American spymaster who helped pave the way for the Allied landings in France, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 82.\n\nHe suffered a lengthy illness, his family said.\n\nMr. Hyde was a crucial player in the World War II team assembled by Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan, the ''Wild Bill'' Donovan of O.S.S. fame. General Donovan was the architect of the Office of Strategic Services and ''father'' of the Central Intelligence Agency that grew from it; Mr. Hyde served as his chief of intelligence in France and later in Switzerland.\n\nHe was the spymaster of Operation Penny Farthing, one of the most successful skeins woven by American intelligence in the thick of war. His exploits were detailed in ''Piercing the Third Reich'' by Joseph Persico, and ''The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan'' by Anthony Cave Brown.\n\nMr. Hyde's upbringing in France had afforded him an unusually suitable background, along with fluency in French and German. He was heading the French desk of the O.S.S. in Algiers when General Donovan picked him to engineer Penny Farthing. His job was to recruit, brief and equip agents, select drop points and coordinate secret radio links with O.S.S. operatives in France.\n\nHe hired agents from origins as divergent as socialist anarchism and -- closer to his own ilk -- the upper reaches of French nobility. After training them in London, he smuggled them into France and collected their gleanings.\n\nThe Penny Farthing network produced accurate information on German troop movements and helped the American high command plan and execute the landings in the south of France and Normandy. Mr. Hyde's conduct earned him two Bronze Stars, and the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
