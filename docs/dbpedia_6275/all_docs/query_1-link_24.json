Israel Walker,\n\nPhebe Baldwin (b. 7 Sep 1654) m. Samuel Richardson,\n\nJohn Baldwin (b. 28 Oct 1656) m. Mary Richardson,\n\nDaniel Baldwin (b. 15 Mar 1659) m. Hannah Richardson,\n\nTimothy Baldwin (b. 27 May 1661) m. Elizabeth Hill,\n\nMary Baldwin (b. 19 Jul 1663, d. there 8 Jan 1664),\n\nHenry Baldwin II (b. 15 Nov 1664) m. Abigail Fiske,\n\nAbigail Baldwin (b. 20 Aug 1667) m. John Reed,\n\nRuth Baldwin (b. 31 Jul 1670), and\n\nBenjamin Baldwin (b. 20 Feb 1673).\n\nHenry became a Freeman of Woburn on 26 May 1652,[8] a Sergeant of the Woburn militia from 1672 to 1685, deacon of the First Church in Woburn, from 1686 until his death in 1698 and a distinguished citizen of the town.[9][7]\n\nDeath and Burial\n\nHenry died on 14 February 1698 at Woburn.[10][6] He is buried in the First Burial Ground in Woburn[11]\n\nWill and Probate Records\n\nHenry wrote his will on 9 February 1697/8 and it was admitted to Probate on 4 April 1698 where he is called Deacon Henry.[12] His original will was admitted to probate on 4 April 1698. In it, Henry makes bequests to his 'well beloved wife', Phebe, his sons Henry, Daniel, Timothy and Benjamin, daughter and son-in-law, Susannah and Israel Walker, daughter and son-in-law, Phebe and Samuel Richardson and their son Zachariah Richardson, unmarried daughters, Abagail [sic] and Ruth, grandson Israel Walker if he resides with his uncle, Henry Baldwin, until the 'one and twentieth year of his age be expired,' and all of his grandchildren born of his own natural children as a token of his love. Henry appointed his 'Dear and loving wife' as Executrix, son Henry as Executor, his pastor, Jabez Fox and friend Lieut. Josias Converse as overseers of his will.[13]\n\n\"Baldwin House\" in North Woburn\n\nThe Baldwin House, also known as the Loammi Baldwin Mansion, located in North Woburn, was begun by Henry Baldwin in 1661, making it the oldest extant home in Woburn. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 7 October 1974. The home was moved from its original location adjacent to the Middlesex Canal to make way for urban expansion to its current location in 1971.[14] The home was owned, expanded upon and occupied by six generations of Baldwins, from 1661 until the 1930s. Henry's great grandson, Col. Loammi Baldwin, greatly expanded the home in the Palladian style, which garnered the name, 'The Baldwin Mansion.' The north chimney, installed by George R. Baldwin, is said to be the first 'single flue chimney' made in the country. The appearance of the home, now a restaurant, looks much the same now as it did in 1820.[9] Several photographs of the exterior and interior of the 'Colonel Loammi Baldwin Mansion' taken by photographer Arthur C. Haskell in 1936, as well as more recent color photographs of the home-cum-restaurant are available at the wikimedia link.[15]\n\nBaldwin House, North Woburn, Massachusetts begun in 1661\n\nBaldwin Immigrants from Aston Clinton and Common Ancestors\n\nHenry of Woburn, John Baldwin of Billerica, Sylvester Baldwin, Jr., the emigrant who died at sea en route to Connecticut, John Baldwin of Norwich, John Baldwin of Milford, and John Baldwin of Stonington, are related to each other and all migrated from the Aston Clinton region of Buckinghamshire to the colonies in the early 1600s. Most, if not all of these colonists are likely direct descendants of Richard Baldwin and Ellen Apuke and most, if not all, of their son Henry Baldwin of Dundridge and his wife Alice Kinge.[16][17][18] Henry of Dundridge and Alice Baldwin's children included 1. Richard (m. Christian Tokefield), who died without issue, 2. son Sylvester Baldwin and his wife Jane Wells, whose son, Sylvester Baldwin, Jr. was the emigrant who died en route to the colonies, 3. son John Baldwin of Stybbings, Wendover, whose son is the probable emigrant John Baldwin of Milford who was a mercer, and 4. son Robert, as well as four daughters.[18] The children of Sylvester and Jane (Wells) Baldwin include: 1. John Baldwin, of whom little is known, but believed dead by 1632; in depth search might determine if he could be John Baldwin of Norwich. Given their approximate ages, both John of Norwich and John of Milford were of the same generation. Chester argues that there is a strong tradition, if not positive proof that John of Milford was a 'near relative' of the Dundridge line.[18] Alternatively, Baldwin points out mistakes in Savage's account of the Baldwins, suggesting that John of Norwich or John of Milford could have been the son of Henry and Alice (Kinge) Baldwin's son, John of Stybbings, Wendover requiring greater search and sourcing.[17] Henry (heir to his uncle Richard, who died without issue), 3. Richard Baldwin who m. Phillipa Corbman whose children include Henry of Woburn, John Baldwin of Billerica, and Sarah Baldwin, (m. Richard Lawrence), who emigrated to New Jersey, 4. son William and 5. son Sylvester Baldwin, Jr. the migrant (m. Sarah Bryan), whose children included John Baldwin of Stonington.[17][18]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nPuritan Great Migration, Founding of Woburn\n\nAlthough not listed in Anderson's Puritan Great Migration, there is evidence that Henry Baldwin arrived during the timeframe. According to Anderson, \"The 13 of 3 month 1640 [13 April] was the date that the General Court granted the petition for the two-mile square addition to the town of Charleston, clearly the event that the settlers of Woburn consider to be the founding date for their town. Below these orders is a listing of thirty-two men who subscribed to the founding document of the town of Woburn in the same order in which they appear on the list. Twenty of the thirty-two resided in Charleston prior to coming to Woburn, including Edward Johnson, Edward Converse, John Mousall, Ezekiel Richardson, Samuel Richardson, Thomas Richardson, William Learned, James Thomas, John Wright, Michael Bacon, John Sears, John Wyman, Francis Wyman, Mr. Thomas Graves, Nicholas Davis, Nicholas Trerice, John Carter, James Converse, Daniel Bacon, Edward Winn. The next group of original Woburn settlers consists of ten men with no certain prior record in New England, may have come straight from England to Woburn, being participants in the final stages of the migration, or resided in Charleston without leaving a record, including Henry Beldin [Anderson corrects Belden to Baldwin on page 473], Francis Kendall, John Teed [sic], Henry Tottingham, Richard Lowden, William Greene, Benjamin Butterfield, Henry Jefts, James Parker, John Russell, James Britton and Thomas Fuller.[3]\n\nPossible Migration with Father and Siblings\n\nIn his Notes on the Baldwin Family, C. C. Baldwin indicates that Richard Baldwin, along with daughter Jane were known to have been in Braintree, Massachusetts in 1637 and it has been surmised that Richard may be the father to Henry of Woburn and John of Billerica. Richard, brother to the immigrant Sylvester, would have likely returned to England himself as his wife, Phillipa, was buried in Aston Clinton on 30 July 1641. Deacon Henry of Woburn was a witness to his brother John Baldwin of Billerica's will in 1686 reinforcing this family relationship.[19]\n\nMisattributed Birth Location\n\nSeveral sources incorrectly suggest the birth location for Henry Baldwin of Woburn as Devonshire, England.[7][9] Baldwin suggests that this error in birth location may have occurred because \"the name 'Baldwin' was there an old one--the first Earl of Devonshire, under William the Conqueror, having that name.\" He also indicates that the arms for the (Aston Clinton) Baldwins do not belong to the Devonshire Baldwins.[6]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Findmypast.Com.
