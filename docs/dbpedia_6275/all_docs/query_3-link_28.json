        "text": "As Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 30, pages 609 - 613\n\nRoger S. Baldwin died in New Haven, his native town, on the 19th day of February, 1863.\n\nThere are especial reasons why the members of the profession, as well as the public at large, in this state, should accord to his memory unusual honors. He had been for many years one of the brightest ornaments of our bar, and had also been, in various capacities, a most able, upright and faithful servant of our commonwealth.\n\nHe was of the best Connecticut stock on both sides, and was worthy of his pedigree. His father, Simeon Baldwin, who died about twelve years ago, universally respected and beloved, had been a representative of this state in Congress, and, for many years, a judge of the Superior Court and of the Supreme Court of Errors; and was a lineal descendant of John Baldwin, a Puritan emigrant from England, who came hither with Davenport, Prudden, Whitfield, and the other original settlers of New Haven, Milford and Guilford, and who was himself of the thirty-five original proprietors by whom the town of Norwich was afterwards settled.\n\nHis mother was a daughter of Roger Sherman, the statesman so justly renowned as one of the committee which reported the Declaration of Independence, as one of the signers of that instrument, as one of the ablest members of the convention which formed the constitution of the United States, and as a distinguished Representative and Senator from this state in the Congress of the United States.\n\nRoger Sherman Baldwin was born January 4th, 1793. He entered Yale College in 1807; graduated with honor at the age of eighteen; then studied law in his father's office, and afterwards, under the able instruction of Judge Reeve and Judge Gould, in the law school at Litchfield; and was admitted to the bar in 1814. He then commenced practice in New Haven; and from that time until the close of his life, except during those periods when his attention was engaged by official duties in the public service, devoted himself with unremitting energy to the pursuit of his profession.\n\nIn 1826 he was a member of the common council of New Haven, and in 1828 was one of the aldermen of that city. In 1837 he was a member of the senate of this state; and in 1838 was re-elected, and was chosen president pro tempore of that body. In 1840 and in 1841 he was a Representative of New Haven in the General Assembly. In 1844 he was chosen Governor of Connecticut, and in 1845 was re-elected to that office. In 1847 he was temporarily appointed by the Governor to fill that vacancy in the senate of the United States occasioned by the death of Senator Huntington; and in May, 1818, he was elected by the General Assembly as senator of the United States for the unexpired portion of Senator Huntington's term, which ended in 1851. In 1860 he was chosen as one of the Electors of President for the state at large; and was afterwards, by appointment of Governor Buckingham, a member of the celebrated \"Peace Congress\", in which he occupies a prominent and influential position.\n\nProbably no lawyer ever attained in Connecticut a higher rank at the bar than that which was generally conceded to Governor Baldwin by his professional brethren. He possessed every one of the characteristics and faculties of a great lawyer. All of those characteristics and faculties he possessed in a high degree, and many of them in a pre-eminent degree. In any forum, anywhere - in the Supreme Court at Washington, or in Westminster Hall, or at any other bar where our system of jurisprudence is understood and practiced - Governor Baldwin would have been regarded, not merely as a skillful practitioner, but as a man entitled to rank among the great lawyers of his day.\n\nHe possessed a comprehensive and thorough acquaintance with the science of his profession. He was master of its learning. He understood it in its great doctrines and in it details. In short he had that legal scholarship, that legal acumen, that legal knowledge, which no intellect but a high one can attain at all, and which even a great intellect can not fully acquire without long, thorough and conscientious labor.\n\nAlthough Governor Baldwin was powerful before the jury, he was more truly in his proper element before the court. A strong antagonist in trying questions of fact, he was especially formidable in the argument of nice and difficult questions of law.\n\nHis discourse, whether addressed to the court or the jury, was marked by uniform purity and transparency of style. His English was perfect. He was always able to say, - guarding with proper qualifications, exceptions and limitations, when necessary, every sentence and phrase, so that his idea, when expressed, stood forth sharply defined, exactly in the form in which he wished it to appear. Rarely, if ever, has he been known to construct an entangled or imperfect sentence. His steady and clear intellect so controlled his tongue, that with him every sentence spontaneously assumed its fit beginning, its appropriately arranged contents, and its accurate and graceful termination.\n\nHis oratory was not often impassioned. It was dignified, logical, clear and convincing, addressed to the intellect rather than to the feelings. Yet, having in himself a large reserve of feeling, he possessed the power of appealing in terms of impressive earnestness to the higher sentiments and sympathies of men. Personal pride, the sense of honor, contempt for meanness and fraud, indignation at corruption and injustice - these and such like sentiments of the human heart he knew how, on proper occasions, to touch and to inflame.\n\nIn guarding the interests of his clients his watchfulness was incessant. No circumstance, which might affect those interests favorably or unfavorably, escaped his notice or failed to receive his full attention. He never abandoned, without a vigorous contest, any claim, great or small, which he thought that his client could rightfully make, and which it was important in the slightest degree for him to maintain.\n\nIn his relations to his clients, to the court, and to his professional brethren, he was always courteous sincere, upright and honorable. His professional character, like his personal character, in whatever light it may be viewed, stands forth without one solitary stain upon it.\n\nSuch, in short, was the lawyer whom one of his most distinguished professional brethren - the late General Kimberly - pronounced to be \"the ablest lawyer that Connecticut has ever produced in any part of her history.\"\n\nGovernor Baldwin, although an earnest Whig and Republican, was not by any means, in the popular sense of the term, a politician. The arts of politicians he did not understand; and if he had understood them he would have scorned to use them. Therefore while he firmly held, and on all proper occasions energetically vindicated, his political opinions, he was, always treated with sincere respect by his political opponents. He never sought office. He never would consent to do any thing for the purpose of securing to himself a nomination or an election. Indeed his friends were sometimes disposed to complain of his excessive punctiliousness in this respect. Undoubtedly he desired to be returned to the United States Senate at the close of his term of service in that body. He did not say so; but his friends were conscious that such was his desire. He had ambition, - such ambition as was worthy of such a man. He had enjoyed his senatorial life. Its duties suited his style of mind and character; and it was impossible for him not to feel that he was able to discharge those duties with honor to himself and to his native state. When the question of his re-election came up in the General Assembly there was in the House of Representatives only as bare majority of Whigs, some two or three of whom declined to vote for him (although he was the nominee of their party) because they were under an impression that his opinions on some points did not exactly accord with the policy of their party as they understood it. His intimate friends knew that this impression had so little foundation that they could easily remove the obstacles in the way of his re-election if they could procure from him for their use, a written statement of his opinions upon the points in question. Such a statement he firmly and persistently refused to give; -declaring that he would not put himself into the position of a seeker of office; that such a written statement of his opinions would be regarded, under the circumstances, as a pledge: and that, in his judgment, a member of the senate ought to occupy in that body a position not trammeled by pledges of any sort whatsoever. The result was that he was not re-elected; -a result which he knew to be probable, if not certain, but which he was willing to accept rather than swerve from a principle of action which he considered sound.\n\nIf, however, rigor of his principles constituted, to no small extent, a barrier to his political success, he did not fail to distinguish himself in those official positions to which he was sometimes called. His administration as Governor of Connecticut was dignified and able. Chancellor Kent said of his annual address to the General Assembly, that they recalled \"the bright days of the Trumbulls, Ellsworths and Shermans, who threw such a lustre on the golden annals of the state.\" He took a high rank in the senate of the United States when it contained some of the ablest men who ever sat within its hall-Webster, Clay, Benton, Calhoun, Seward, and their contemporaries. He devoted himself with characteristic fidelity to his duties in that high place; and during the four years of his service there, few if any, of the members of the senate took a more active part in its debates and other proceedings than he. His principle speeches were upon the Mexican war, and the extension of slavery as connected with it; the admission of California into the Union; the Compromise Measures of 1850, especially the Fugitive Slave Law; and the Oregon bill. His speech against the Fugitive Slave Law was regarded by the opponents of that measure as an overwhelming and unanswerable argument against it, while the advocates of the law, however they might dissent from his conclusions, did not withhold from him the respect due to the power which he displayed in the discussion of his subject. His most spirited speech however was an impromptu one in reply to Mr. Manson, of Virginia, who had ventured to institute offensive comparisons between Virginia and Connecticut in regard to the Revolutionary history of the two states. Mr. Baldwin was the last man to shrink from a contest with any antagonist on such a subject. Mason's attack upon Connecticut was unprovoked, insolent and confident. No sooner had he taken his seat than Mr. Baldwin sprang to his feet. By a few words full of dignity, force and fire, he completely overwhelmed his adversary; and not only overwhelmed him but drove him into ignominious silence. At the conclusion of Mr. Baldwin's speech, Senator Underwood, of Kentucky, rose and suggested that his \"friend from Virginia\" had \"in this contest\" manifested \"much more valor than discretion,\" and advised him to not pursue the matter farther. The Virginian was wise enough to act upon his advise, and the debate thereupon ended. It was not safe for any man, as Mr. Mason on this occasion discovered to disparage Connecticut in the hearing of her senator. He was well acquainted with the history of his country. He knew too (what citizens of other states seldom care to remember, and perhaps seldom know, and, what we ourselves do not seem always to properly appreciate,) that the state which he represented had a history, civil, military, which enabled her to compare favorably, not only with Virginia, or with any other state in this Union, but with any commonwealth that ever existed upon earth; and with that history, especially dear to him for many reasons, he was perfectly familiar. Proud therefore of his native state, and abundantly able to defend her against all attacks, from whatever quarter they might come, he was always, while in her service, the vigilant guardian of her interests and her honor.\n\nNo part of Governor Baldwin's public life was more anxious, arduous and exhausting to him than the brief period during which he was a member of the \"Peace Congress.\" In that body, as a member of a committee of one from each state therein represented, he made a minority report in his own name, which he presented to the convention, with an accompanying resolution recommending the several states \"to unite with Kentucky in her application to Congress to call a convention for proposing amendments the constitution of the United States.\" This report and this resolution be supported, in a powerful speech, which was the last great effort of his public life.\n\nThe reserve and resistance which were marked characteristics of Governor Baldwin, made him appear, to those who did not know him, somewhat distant and formal; while, in fact, as those who were better acquainted with him knew perfectly well, kindness of heart, sensitiveness to the sufferings of others, and forwardness to give pleasure and confer happiness upon all within his reach, were fundamental traits in his character.\n\nThis sketch, necessarily short and imperfect, accomplishes its purpose and does justice to the subject of it only so far as it depicts the character, and partly discloses the life, of a great lawyer, whose own virtues secluded him in a measure from those opportunities distinction in public life to which his abilities entitled him, - and of an incorruptible, sensitive, honorable man, who did his duty in this life well and faithfully in those stations whereunto it pleased God to call him, and who died at last, lamented most by those who knew him best, and respected by everybody who knew him, leaving behind him, for the honor and comfort of his children, a noble and unsullied reputation.\n\n*Prepared, at the request of the reporter, by Henry B. Harrison, Esq., of the New Haven County bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 106, pages 735 - 738\n\nSIMEON EBEN BALDWIN was born February 5th, 1840, and died January 30th, 1927. His father, Roger Sherman Baldwin, a distinguished lawyer, was Governor of Connecticut, 1844-1846, and United States Senator, 1847-1849. His grandfather, Simeon Baldwin, who married a daughter of Roger Sherman, signer of the Declaration of Independence, was Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors from 1808-1818, when the downfall of the Federalist party in Connecticut brought about the appointment of a Democrat in his place.\n\nSimeon E. Baldwin graduated from Yale College in 1861, and after studying law in Yale and Harvard was admitted to the New Haven County bar in 1863.\n\nHis brilliant intellect, inherited legal instinct, and his ceaseless industry, supplemented by a retentive and ready memory, soon brought him to the front rank of a State bar distinguished for its ability. As his practice increased in importance he became more widely known as lawyer and author, especially in the then comparatively undeveloped domain of railroad law, and at his death Mr. Chief Justice Taft characterized him as one of the great lawyers and great judges of the nation. He was also a lawyer of an uncommon type in this respect, that although immersed in a practice which might well have absorbed all his energy, he found time to acquire an international reputation as scholar and author in the outlying fields of jurisprudence, comparative law, social science and colonial history, as well as in the field of substantive law.\n\nVery few of our great American lawyers have achieved a like distinction for broad scholarship. Besides all this, his profound sense of civic and professional obligation—which was perhaps the dominating motive of his life—led him into a practically continuous career of public service.\n\nHis activities were so varied that a brief and necessarily incomplete outline of his career will picture him better than in any other way.\n\nIn 1869, the death of its last surviving professor had left the Yale Law School without a faculty, and with but few students.The tradition is that the Yale Corporation desired to close the School. However that may be, Mr. Baldwin aided by his brethren, William C. Robinson and Johnston T. Platt, and with the cordial support of President Woolsey, undertook to carry it on without financial aid from the College. These three men were appointed instructors in 1869, and in 1872 they, with Mr. Francis Wayland, who had been appointed Dean, were made professors of law. Thus was the Yale Law School reborn, and so began the history of its steady progress and development.\n\nUnquestionably, Professor Baldwin was, and continued to be, the leading spirit in this undertaking. For fifty years, he taught unremittingly in the School, and his own fame as teacher, scholar, jurist and judge added luster to that of the School. The University and the profession owe him for that inestimable service a debt which they cannot repay, but can only gratefully acknowledge.\n\nMr. Baldwin again put the bar under deep and lasting obligation by the publication of Baldwin’s Digest, one volume issued in 1871 and the second in 1882. In 1873, he became a member of the Commission to revise the Connecticut statutes, and was Chief Editor of the Revision of 1875. He was one of the founders of the American Bar Association, a member of its executive committee from 1878-1888, its president in 1890, and for twelve years director of its Bureau of Comparative Law. In 1877, he was appointed a member of the Commission for Simplifying Legal Procedure, and in form and substance our present Practice Act, as well as the first edition of our Connecticut Practice Book, was his work more than that of any other. In 1885, he drew the report for a better system of taxation, and was later appointed chairman of the commission which recommended the statutory revision of our State taxation system in 1915-1917.\n\nIn 1893, he was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors, coming to that court directly from the bar, and was its Chief Justice from 1907-1910, when he reached the constitutional age limit.\n\nAs judge and chief justice he was courteous, patient, alert and wise in administering the rules of court. His opinions are marked for learning, brevity, clarity, accuracy of thought and diction, literary finish and finality of decision. They justly won for him the title of a great judge.\n\nIn 1911, he was elected Governor of Connecticut on the Democratic ticket, and he was re-elected in 1913. In that position also he served the State with distinction, exhibiting an accurate knowledge of the affairs of every department of the State government and of the institutions under its control and management, a just appreciation of their administration and necessities, and a capacity for practical statesmanship. With the pomp and ceremony of the office, he had little patience.\n\nIn his private life also Governor Baldwin was dominated by a sense of civic responsibility. He was for many years a trustee of the Hopkins Grammar School, president of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the New Haven Hospital, whose first president was his grandfather, Simeon Baldwin. To these and other institutions with which he was associated, Governor Baldwin gave both leadership and service. It was characteristic that although tenacious of his convictions in the performance of his individual duties, he accepted the decision of the majority where the responsibility was divided and assisted in carrying into effect, as if they were his own, the policies and measures which he had opposed.\n\nIntellectually he was unemotional, but in feeling and conduct, kindly and sympathetic. His reputation for austerity was belied by his works.\n\nIn religious matters, he was tolerant and liberal. Though devoted to Congregationalism because he saw in it the historical seeds of our religious and political freedom, he quarreled with no man’s creed. He disapproved of the dogmatic theology of the Puritans, but he appreciated and practiced the stern sense of personal duty which it imposed.\n\nThe range of his scholarship was wide. He was president of many national and international societies. Incidentally, he could preside over a meeting held in Paris where the proceedings were conducted in the French language. As an author he published two works on Railroad Law, a History of the American Judiciary, the introduction to and several chapters of Two Centuries Growth of American Law, Modern Political Institutions, The Life and Letters of Simeon Baldwin, and contributed very many leading articles to legal and scientific publications. His last important work entitled Colonial Period forms the first volume of Osborn’s History of Connecticut.\n\nIn all of his activities, Mr. Baldwin was a forward-looking man. As lawyer he was a leader in the development of railroad law, and in the simplification of legal procedure; as legal educator in the establishment of post-graduate courses of study; as judge in the adaptation of our common law to the necessities of modern civilization. No member of the Connecticut bar has rendered greater service to the profession, to the public and to the law; and to him the law was not a jealous mistress, for none has attained wider recognition as author, scholar and jurist.\n\n*Prepared by Hon.

He was born in Canton of this state August 2d, 1822, and his childhood and youth were spent there upon his father's farm. His mother was the sister of Rev. Dr. Heman Humphrey, an early president of Amherst College in Massachusetts, and was first cousin of the famous John Brown. The atmosphere in which he grew up was one of more than usual intelligence, while the best religious influences, operating on a responsive nature, made him from early life conscientious and dutiful and prepared him for a manhood characterized by high moral purpose. He took a course of study, helping himself by teaching at Amherst Academy and at Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Mass., and afterwards studied law in the Yale Law School and with the late Roger H. Mills, Esq., then a member of the Litchfield County bar and residing at New Hartford. He was admitted to the bar in 1849, and immediately commenced practice in Torrington in Litchfield County, where he remained for twenty-one years, holding, during fifteen years of that time, the office of judge of probate, and for twenty years those of town clerk and town treasurer. In 1850 he represented the town in the lower house of the General Assembly and in 1870 the Fifteenth District in the upper house. While in the senate he was chairman of the judiciary committee of the two houses. In 1879 he was appointed by the General Assembly upon a committee for the revision of our joint stock law, and in 1885 upon another for the revision of our probate laws, and in each case took a prominent part in the work undertaken.\n\nIn 1870 Mr. Barbour removed to Hartford and entered into partnership with his older brother, the late Heman H. Barbour, who had for several years been in the practice of law there. On the death of the latter in 1875 he formed a partnership with another brother, Sylvester Barbour, who had just removed to Hartford. This partnership was dissolved a few years later, and he entered into no other. On coming to Hartford he soon received the public confidence as a lawyer of great fidelity to business intrusted to him and of sterling integrity. His appointment upon the two commissions named was made after he went there. His mind was quite judicial in its character; with none of the brilliancy that might have enabled him to succeed as an advocate, and with no rhetorical faculty or ambition, he had excellent judgment, a habit of patient investigation, and a strong sense of justice, and discharged most creditably those minor judicial duties to which he was often called. His familiarity with the administration of town business, acquired in his long occupancy of town offices in Torrington, made his services valuable as the adviser for several years of the town officers of Hartford. He was also one of the best probate lawyers in the state.\n\nMr. Barbour was in the highest degree honorable in all his dealings, always fair and courteous in the trying of cases, painstaking and accurate in all his legal work, patient in investigation, kindly sympathetic in his treatment of others, modest and unassuming, and preeminently conscientious and just. He was governed everywhere by the law of kindness.\n\nIn the latter part of his life he became seriously involved through obligations assumed for others and his later years were years of professional toil, patiently borne under failing health, in the hope, never fully realized, of meeting and discharging the obligations which overloaded him, and of which he felt the pressure even upon his dying bed.\n\nHe had from early life been a man of decided religious convictions and character, and a valued member of the Congregational denomination, and was for several years a deacon in the Asylum Hill Congregational church.\n\nIn 1857 he married Pamelia J. Bartholomew, of Sheffield, Mass., who, with a son and daughter, survive him. His son is Rev. John Humphrey Barbour, a most esteemed professor in the Berkeley Divinity School at Middletown in this state.\n\nAt a meeting of the Hartford County bar, on the occasion of Mr. Barbour's death, Mr. F. L. Hungerford spoke of him as follows: \"I have known Judge Barbour since my earliest childhood, as I was born in Torrington where he had practised law for many years, and during my minority he was my guardian. He was the man of the town and prominent in church matters. Every one looked up to him and thought when they had his opinion on any matter they had all that could be gotten anywhere. He may not have been a man who could be called great, judged from the point of public greatness, but judged from the good his life has done society he has been a great success. He was not only a very kindly man, but one of great knowledge and excellent judgment.\"\n\nJudge W. J. McConville spoke as follows: \"Judge Barbour's death has been a personal loss to me. In his office I studied law, and with him have been associated for several years. No one outside of his family has in the last twelve years seen him as much. Between us there were no differences and neither appeared to be conscious of an unpleasant thought towards the other. No one could have such thoughts of him; he was so gentle, sympathetic and considerate of others. I have said of him many times, and can say truly now, as I can of no other I have known as well, that he never had an unkind word to say of any one. He loved his fellow men and delighted to help them. He practised law for the good he might do. He affected nothing, he had no arts, he deceived no one, he scorned meanness and indirection. He was just he seemed to be. If he ever made a friend or won a case he deserved them. In his declining years he had his full share of trials, but he bore them without a murmur. You would never know from anything he said that he ever had them. He died as he had lived, a patient, upright Christian gentleman.\"\n\nFurther eulogistic remarks were made by other members of the bar, and resolutions of respect to his memory were passed.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 29, pages 614 - 615\n\nI RECALL from the printer these closing sheets to add another worthy name to the list of our memorable dead. Jonathan Barnes Esq., for many years the acknowledged head of the Middlesex County bar, and a man of great classical as well as legal attainments, died at Middletown, where he resided, on the 24th of December, 1861, at the age of seventy-two. The following notice of him is taken from the Sentinel & Witness, a Middletown paper.\n\nJONATHAN BARNES was born in Tolland, in the year 1789, and was the son of Jonathan Barnes, an attorney of eminence in Tolland county. He was graduated at Yale College, in 1810. Having finished his collegiate course he commenced the study of law with his father, but removed to Middletown in 1811, and pursued and completed his studies with Chauncey Whittelsey, Esq., a prominent lawyer of this place. He was admitted to the bar in 1813, and from that time almost to the day of his death he has practiced in Middletown. We do not believe that any lawyer ever left behind him such an example of unremitting and unfaltering labor in his profession. He was constantly employed in the duties of his calling, never absent from the city, and seldom even away from his office. In sickness and in health he was to be found at his post, and at last he died with \"the harness on.\"\n\nIn his profession he stood among the first, as the many clients who entrusted their interests to his charge can testify. He never strove to shine, but simply endeavored to do his duty to his client, preferring rather the approval of a mind conscious of right than the plaudits of the public. His store of legal erudition was vast and varied, and was so systematized that it was on every occasion ready for use. His style of speaking corresponded with the character of the man. He never attempted empassioned declamation, or brilliant figures of rhetoric, but calmly made his statements of fact, and reasoned out his positions. He had a fine command of language, and a polished taste in the choice of it. He never gave utterance to anything low or vulgar; and if his arguments had been taken down as they fell from his lips, they would have made finished essays.\n\nHis reading outside of his profession was extensive and various, and upon almost every subject of ordinary conversation he could talk easily and interestingly. His love for literature never deserted him, even amid the trying duties of his profession. He devoted a portion of each day to reading the classics: and late in life he was probably more familiar with the great writers of Greek and Roman literature than when he received his diploma. To his classical attainments he added an excellent knowledge of several modern languages, and his acquaintance with the Hebrew text of the old Testament would have done credit to a theologian.\n\nHe did not aspire to political honors, and never stood before the public as a candidate for office. He preferred the quiet routine of the daily duties of his calling, and was contented never to quit them to join in the scramble of scheming politicians. If he had entered public life he would undoubtedly have been successful and distinguished, for he who served individuals so well and so faithfully would surely have served the public with exemplary fidelity.\n\nHe became a member of the North Congregational Church, on the 5th of July 1829, and has been ever since a pious and consistent christian. While he was in the enjoyment of health he was a regular attendant upon the service of the sanctuary, and even when stricken with disease he was present in his pew as often as possible. For many years he was a teacher in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and many of those who searched the scriptures under his guidance, and are now pursuing their various avocations in all parts of the country, remember to this day with delight the expositions which he gave. He died on the 24th of December 1861, and has gone down to the grave in the fullness of age. Leaving behind him a character fragrant with every excellence.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 126, pages 719 - 723\n\nHeredity and environment tended to make John Kimberly Beach the ideal lawyer. There were six John Beaches in Connecticut in the direct line, and all of them were ministers or lawyers. Born in New Haven on October 18, 1855, he lived there until his death on July 6, 1938. A graduate of Yale in the class of 1877, he was long a teacher in the School of Law. Active work in the profession for over fifty years broadened and ripened his character and mind. The last of a line of lawyers, he grew up in an office with his father, a keen and able practitioner.\n\nJudge Beach's apprenticeship brought him into close association with a fine and able group of men who were the leaders of the New Haven bar. This included, with his father, the brilliant and resourceful Ingersoll, the learned Baldwin, and the consummate solicitor Louis H. Bristol. These names with those of Torrance, Harrison, Stoddard and Watrous bring up memories of a bar, which has perhaps not been excelled in Connecticut in power and ability.\n\nThis young man was highly favored of fortune so far as concerns a propitious environment for a career in the law. With a sound New England toughness inherited from the Beaches was mixed the Quaker-Irish blood of his mother's family. This produced no complexes, but a rare combination of sweetness, friendliness and gayety, with a keen and dispassionate intellect ready to cope with the most intricate problems, and fully fitted to solve them. His mind and soul were exceedingly independent. Fishing in the North Woods, minding his pea patch in his charming retreat at Hammonassett, preparing a case for trial, or investigating the law for judicial opinions, he worked by himself. There remains a memory of him in middle life in the full swing of a busy practice. On a typical afternoon he would be found in his office, hour after hour, writing briefs in longhand on the arm of an old-fashioned rocking chair while he loudly argued the points with himself.\n\nUpon beginning practice he was at once engaged with his father in many important patent causes. They were days of rapid industrial development. Connecticut was full of inventors, and lawyers and clients were litigious. His father had the confidence of the business community and the young man had thus unusual opportunities. In early years his name is almost always associated in briefs with that of his father. There are many such in a long succession of patent causes in the Circuit Court. They had as well an extensive general practice. For example, at the June Term of 1887 the Beaches appeared together in the Supreme Court in a suit to replevy a quantity of brass and copper, in an appeal from a probate decree allowing a claim against the estate of an insolvent debtor, and in an appeal from a judgment allowing damages for diverting waters.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1887 he continued in practice with a brother. In 1898 he joined Samuel H. Fisher to form the firm of Beach and Fisher. Fisher came of a patent law family, and had had experience in Washington. These young men developed a fine business in patent soliciting, but the patent litigations were diminishing in number and importance, and when they were invited in 1902 to join the firm of Bristol, Stoddard and Bristol, they were glad to do so; and formed the firm of Bristol, Stoddard, Beach and Fisher. Henry Stoddard had retired from the bench in 1888, and fourteen years later was in the midst of a trial practice, which in character and volume has been without parallel in Connecticut. For the next ten years this firm enjoyed a splendid business in an atmosphere of cheerful friendliness, which tended to hilarity upon appropriate occasions.\n\nMr. Beach's practice had by then become largely general court work; the presentation of causes on behalf of or in conjunction with other lawyers. A few of his cases in the period 1908 to 1913 involved suits for diverting waters, for indemnity for damages caused by a strike of workmen against a carrier of strike insurance, against a life insurance company for distribution among policy holders of a so-called safety fund, for damages for property of a theatrical company destroyed by a fire on a railroad, and some important work in bankruptcy. It was during this period that for some years he was active in the defense of members of the hatters' union in the famous Danbury Hatters case (Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274, 223 U.S. 729, 187 Fed. 522). This was interrupted when he was appointed to the bench.\n\nHis briefs follow a common pattern. In his youth they are long and meticulous, with extensive citation of authority. Later they became simple, confined to clear reasoning for a few pages, covering only essential points, with sparing reference to decisions. He was wont to say that one strong assignment of errors is better than twenty weak ones. The essence of advocacy is simplicity; and Judge Beach learned this in his practice.\n\nAn outstanding characteristic in trial work was his fineness almost amounting to delicacy. He would not resort to cheap methods or tricks, and he resented the use of then by others. He seemed to regard a case predominantly as an intellectual problem. Having assembled the facts, he worked the matter out as one would a problem in mathematics. While this had the advantage of clarity and simplicity, it occasionally prevented a necessary shift in tactics to meet the vicissitudes of the courtroom.\n\nOn February 6, 1923, he resigned as law professor because of increasing pressure of his work upon the bench. Over a period of many years he had given instruction in the Yale Law School in Admiralty, Agency, Patent Law, Conflict of Laws, Sales, and Receivers. He taught by a combination of the textbook and case methods. For example, in his course on Sales the book he used was Benjamin's, which is to a large extent a classified digest of decisions.\n\nBecause of his soft voice and gentle manner the Judge was not at his best in public appearances at the bar or in the classroom. The true quality of his finely tempered mind is found in his briefs and opinions. He was born to sit upon a court of appeals. However, he succeeded in the chief function of a law teacher, the clear, orderly and comprehensive presentation of a course of study, available to the grasp of a student willing to learn. He received from Yale the honorary degrees of Master of Arts in 1908 and of Doctor of Laws in 1913.\n\nHe was, as C. R. Ingersoll said of his father, \"notably a lawyer and thoroughly a lawyer.\" All of his intellectual interests were concerned with the law. Professor Hicks says of him, \"He participated actively in the work of the American Law Institute as advisor to the reporter on Restatement of the Law of Agency. His colleagues report that, despite his advanced age, he was a learned, alert and stimulating associate.\" He was a member of the Connecticut committee on the federal rules of civil procedure, a work in which he took great interest. He was gravely disturbed about certain manifestations of the New Deal philosophy, especially the National Recovery Act, and what he called \"its successor in purpose, the pending bill to reform the. Court.\"\n\nAfter the decision of the case of State v. McCook, 109 Conn. 621, Judge Beach, then retired, became greatly interested in the subject matter of Section 12 of Article IV of the Constitution of Connecticut with which that decision dealt. In an unpublished paper he has left, he has gone at great length into the judicial history of this subject, and with customary clarity has given his reasons for preferring the conflicting federal rule.\n\nJudge Beach's last important undertaking was his work as state referee in hearing and reporting on an extensive investigation into conditions in the New Haven bar. He has left some notes on the foundation of legal ethics which are worth repeating:\n\nThe term \"ethics\" when applied to professional conduct includes as a matter of course common honesty and fair dealing in the contractual relation and it also connotes the existence of some rules of conduct for the breach of which the law does not give a remedy, but which have a sanction comparable to the social ostracism which follows persistent violation of the prevailing standards of personal conduct. So the persistent violation of such professional minor morals may justly result in professional ostracism. The time has gone by when the rule caveat emptor drew a distinct line between a business and a profession, but it still remains true that a business transaction may involve nothing more than a strictly contractual relation, whereas a professional transaction, though it also be contractual, includes always a relation of trust and confidence. A lawyer who does not feel and respond to this fiduciary obligation may do a considerable business, but he is not practicing his profession. Strict performance of this fiduciary duty is more important in the law than in any other profession; not merely to protect the interests of the client, but because any public distrust of the legal profession creates a corresponding distrust and impairment of the administration of civil justice.\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou might suppose there was no necessary connection between wholesale ambulance chasing and the loss of public confidence in the administration of justice. But the fact as indicated by the evidence is that the practice of ambulance chasing on a large scale is a highly specialized business and a highly competitive one. In the first place, the prospective clients are almost necessarily poor or ignorant, for it would be dangerous to employ on any large-scale persons who are in a position to make trouble. The next step is to make the employment attractive by offering to pay all medical and legal expenses, so that win or lose it will not cost the client a cent and the lawyer will rely on a percentage of the recovery for his compensation. Then to prevent the case from being captured by a competitor the client is required to sign a power of attorney giving absolute control of expenses, settlement or trial or abandonment of the case to the attorney. The lawyer being thus safely in full control of the joint enterprise is inclined to be autocratic in handling his client, and the net result appears to be that the average client is never sure that he has been fairly treated. and this not only for the reason stated but because the amount of the recovery, if any, is apt to be far below the rosy estimates held out by the attorney or his runner as an inducement to his employment\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn concluding this topic it might fairly be said that no single condition affecting the administration of civil justice confronts the profession and the courts, not only here but elsewhere, which is of greater importance than the problem of adequately dealing with the increasing accumulation of claims for damages for personal and property injuries, especially when that problem is aggravated by ambulance chasing and by the poverty of an overcrowded bar.\n\nJudge Beach is the last man who has been a member of the Supreme Court of Errors without having passed through apprenticeship of work as a nisi prius Judge. Appointed in 1913 by Governor Baldwin after twenty-five years or more of active practice involving important responsibilities, he became immediately a useful member of the court. Beginning in Volume 86 of the Connecticut Reports and continuing until Volume 103, when he retired for age in 1925, he regularly wrote an average of eighteen published opinions a year upon a great diversity of subjects. There are nearly three hundred of his opinions in sixteen volumes of the Reports. His brevity is truly remarkable. His forty opinions in Volumes 91 and 92 average less than four pages in length; and this includes two rather long opinions in appeals from conviction for murder.\n\nNotable brevity and clarity are virtues attained by few of our profession, but Judge Beach had the capacity to compress into a short paragraph of two or three sentences the essential facts and the fundamental law of a case. Examples of this may be found by taking his opinions at random. Good judges are always looking for the \"nub\" of the case. Judge Beach always found it, and generally stated it.\n\nSpace does not suffice to refer to many of his opinions. Mention is made of Napier v. Peoples Stores Co., 98 Conn. 414, overruling Wells v. Hartford Manilla Co.; Hartford-Conn. Trust Co. v. Devine, 97 Conn. 193, in which the court freed our law from the supposed sanctity of a seal; Blodgett v. Union & New Haven Trust Co., 97 Conn. 405, a leading case in succession tax law; and New Haven Sand Blast Co. v. Dreisbach, 102 Conn. 169. In the last in a field of law where he was thoroughly at home Judge Beach wrote an opinion longer than customary. For moderation, clarity, orderly progression from point to point, and thence to an irresistible conclusion, this opinion can perhaps not be surpassed in the Connecticut Reports.\n\nIt is difficult to reproduce the appearance or personality of Judge Beach. Professor Frederic C. Hicks has attempted it:\n\n\"Slight of build, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, moving about with quick bird-like motion, alert, friendly, animated, always aware of his surroundings, he had an engaging personality. Although he had strong convictions he was greatly respected for his fairness in practice and on the bench.\"\n\nFrom the point of view of his juniors in the profession, he was a wise and kind preceptor, a tolerant and generous master. He knew how to delegate responsibility, and by reposing confidence inspired the strongest loyalty and affection. He well fulfilled Rufus Choate's requirements for the ideal judge, who must be a man \"not merely upright and merely honest, and well intentioned, but a man who would not respect persons in his judgments,\" and in this he must possess the \"perfect confidence of the community.\"\n\n*Prepared by Frederick H.

And he was a lineal descendant of the Rev. John Beach, who from 1732 until 1782 was conspicuous in Connecticut as a devoted and efficient missionary of the Church of England in the service of the \"Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.\"\n\nGraduating at Yale College in 1839, Mr. Beach immediately entered Yale Law School, where he graduated in 1842. Being admitted to the bar in 1843, he began the practice of law at New Haven, where for nearly forty-five years, and almost down to the day of his death, he continued in the zealous and highly successful exercise of his profession.\n\nOn the 15th day of September, 1847, he married Rebecca Gibbons, of Wilmington, Delaware, who, with three sons and one daughter, survives him.\n\nFor twenty-two years he was a most useful member of the Vestry of Trinity Church, and he lived and died in that Christian faith wherein he had been born and nurtured.\n\nA meeting of the Bar of New Haven County, held on the 14th of September, Hon. Tilton E. Doolittle presiding, adopted the following preamble and resolutions :--\n\n\"JOHN SHELDON BEACH, the honored leader of the New Haven County Bar and for many years an eminent practitioner in all the courts of this state, having departed this life at his residence in the city of New Haven on the 12th instant, his brethren of the Bar with which his professional life has been most closely associated desire, in their sorrow, to place upon the records of the court so long adorned by his service, their sense of the bereavement sustained by them and by the community in which the labor of his life has been accomplished.\n\n\"Wherefore, it is by the members of the Bar of New Haven County, now assembled for the purpose,\n\n\"Resolved, that deeply impressed by the great and good qualities and the useful and honorable life of our deceased brother, we render this tribute of our admiration and respect to the high intellectual ability, the professional learning, the wise judgment and rare powers of argument, and the scrupulous integrity and fidelity which, through the forty-four years of his career at the bar, have distinguished his professional character, and which, combined with his signal private virtues, have brought to his life the respect and esteem of all who knew him and made of his death a public loss.\n\n\"Resolved, that the president of the Bar be desired to present these proceedings to the Superior Court at its next session in this county, with the request that they be entered on its minutes.\n\n\"Resolved, that this Bar will, as a body, attend the funeral services, of our deceased associate.\n\n\"Resolved, that a copy of these proceedings be transmitted by the clerk to the family of the deceased, with the respectful assurance of our sympathy in their bereavement.\"\n\nThose who knew him best will most fully recognize the truthfulness of the portraiture of this accomplished lawyer and gentleman as delineated by Ex-Governor Ingersoll in the address made by him upon the presentation of the resolutions--which address was, substantially, as follows:\n\nMR. INGERSOLL'S ADDRESS.\n\nIt is not easy, Mr. President, it is indeed impossible, to express adequately by formal resolution or, I may say, by any words of man, the sentiments by which you and I are moved upon this occasion. For we are here, in this large assemblage of our profession, alone almost, as the representatives of this Bar as it was in the decade which brought our dead brother into its ranks. For more than forty years, in summer and in winter, we have been by his side in almost constant practice of our profession, and during that long period in the friendly companionship involved in such relations. It is very hard to rupture such a tie. But my personal association with him goes back to an earlier date. Born in the same neighborhood in this town, we were companions in childhood, in school life, in college life, and following him to this Bar after an interval of two years we have ever since been closely associated in many ways not professional. I look back on this long life with which mine has been so connected and it is luminous with qualities that sanctify friendship and go into the making of good men and honored citizens. Mr. President, I cannot venture to dwell at this time upon those personal relations. A single allusion in this connection I will make, for the incident has given me too much satisfaction to be ignored. But a few weeks ago, at a social gathering, the last that he attended, I heard him, in conversation with a brother lawyer upon some of the agreeable characteristics of our profession, say that he had been in practice with me for over forty years, and that this had brought us together in the trial of a great many cases and not often upon the same side, but that during this long experience with its varied occasions for antagonism of opinion, no instance of serious misunderstanding had ever, under any circumstances, arisen between us. And that, Mr. President, was the literal truth.\n\nAs to his relations to this Bar and our profession, I will add a word or two. John S. Beach was notably a lawyer; and he was thoroughly a lawyer. His element was the atmosphere of courts. His ambition and his delight was to be active where justice is sought. And, outside of his home with its associations most cherished by him, his life duty was centered here, among judges and lawyers. And, Mr. President, the jealous mistress of the law never found occasion to reproach him for any neglect of her service. No public honor ever allured him from her side. No phantom of popular fame ever led him away in its pursuit. No temptation of quick gains in other paths ever ensnared him. But quietly, unostentatiously, industriously and conscientiously, he has for forty-four years, steadily followed the common routine of the practicing Connecticut lawyer. Followed it, however, as we all know, not as a plodder through a daily task--not in servile toil to heap up riches for he could not tell whom to gather. Far from that. He had a broad nature and his way of life was a generous one. There was noticeably in him, a freedom from anything cramped or cynical in his dealings, with men or his judgment of their conduct or motives. But he devoted himself to this career because he loved it. He was a man of purposes and very firm in them- \"justum et tenacem\" and I have no doubt that long ago he determined upon this plan of life because of the conviction of his judgment that in no other worldly vocation could his intellectual and moral nature procure higher and fuller satisfaction than in the faithful practice of our profession. Only recently he said that he believed he took as much pleasure in the trial of a case then as he ever did. But his delight was particularly in the presentation of his cases to a court in argument. I do not recall any criminal case in which he was ever actively engaged; and he always avoided if he could the trial of any issue by a jury. But in the open fair field of legal controversy, where principles could be expounded and applied, and in the region of pure fact, as the mechanics of a patent suit, he was always ready and very fond of the discussions involved. His style of presenting a case reminded one of that quaint characterization of an old English judge, \"there was no rubbish in his mind.\" Simple, clear, without rhetorical or any other display, and apparently to an onlooker without special effort, his prepared arguments were nevertheless the result of painstaking care. Their aim was to capture the reason of the trier, and the joints of premise and conclusion were always artistically fitted, and the whole structure polished by a pure and lucid diction, so that the argument not only commanded the attention but required the vigilance of him who had to hear another side.\n\nAnd this devotion to his profession received the reward that was merited and, doubtless, coveted. I do not think any lawyer of this Bar ever had a stronger clientage. There were few of the representative men of this community during the last thirty years who were not, at some time, familiar with his office. And most of our monied institutions and leading commercial establishments have, in one way or another, availed themselves of his counsel. What secured this confidence? Not alone, Mr. President, the intellectual skill and professional experience I have pointed out. But underlying it all was the primitive bed-rock of private virtue and moral strength, without which it is the glory of our profession that, in the long run of forty years, the cunning of the brain and all the acquired accomplishments of the lawyer avail but little.\n\nMr. President, I have been led into saying more than I intended. The earth has not yet closed upon the form that seems to have been but yesterday in this room, and it is the hour of lamentation rather than the hour of eulogy. But very soon nothing will be left here save the memory of him. Mr. President, let this Bar cherish that among its jewels. If our generation of its members has any legacy to leave to that generation fast pressing upon us, I know no richer one than the example of John S. Beach.\n\n*Prepared at the request of the Reporter, by Ex-Governor Henry B. Harrison, of the New Haven Bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 99, pages 736 - 738\n\nMORRIS BEACH BEARDSLEY was born in Trumbull, Conn., August 13th, 1849. He was the son of Samuel Gregory Beardsley and Mary (Beach) Beardsley. His preliminary education was acquired at the Stratford Academy and his academic education at Yale University where he took his degree in 1870. After attending the Columbia Law School for one year and spending the following year in study in the office of William K. Seeley, one of the leaders of the Fairfield County Bar, he was admitted to the practice of law June 14th, 1872.\n\nIt is difficult to pass on to posterity a description that will do justice to the character and attributes of Morris Beardsley. Nature was prodigal of her gifts to him. He was a strikingly handsome man of courtly bearing, distinguished manners, warm heart and sympathetic temperament. He early accepted the office of Judge of Probate for the District of Bridgeport, and held the same for nearly seventeen years.\n\nNever was there a more ideal judge of probate. No judge ever discharged the often depressing duties of that office with more tact, sympathy and thoughtful kindness. His charity was great. It could be truthfully said of Judge Beardsley that “to relieve the wretched was his pride.” Like John Ruskin, he trusted in the nobleness of human nature and the joy of its love. He, too, endeavored to love his neighbor as himself, and to labor with the strength and opportunity that God gave him. No finer tribute can be paid to the memory of Judge Beardsley than the one expressed in the minute of the Committee on Resolutions appointed by the Fairfield County Bar, which in part follows—\n\n“Judge Beardsley’s most conspicuous service was in the Probate Court. It was characterized by adequate capacity and constant fidelity. He was untiring in his effort to make his court a model probate court and the records of that day bear witness to the distinction with which he acquitted himself. He gave to that court every quality which that judge should have: a steady and fine character, an unblemished reputation, a commanding trust, habits of system and method, and promptness in the dispatch of public business, enthusiasm in the cause in which he had enlisted, a jealous devotion to the good name of the court, a high purpose to administer his office as a trust, a personality which inspired confidence, and a disposition and heart which gave to the heartsore and troubled not only sound direction, but unflagging sympathy. Every one came into his court respecting and trusting him and left it his life-long friend. His impartiality knew neither person, circumstance, creed nor race, and when he had served in this exacting position sixteen years and refused to longer continue in this office, the universal commendation of the people of the probate district followed him into his retirement. When he began again the practice of law, quite naturally, the greater part of his practice was in connection with estates and wills. He was connected in one capacity or another with most of the cases for the construction of wills arising in his locality during the period of his practice. He drew many wills and advised many testators, and was responsible for many of the bequests for charitable and philanthropic institutions in his locality.”\n\nJudge Beardsley had been the city clerk of Bridgeport, and served upon its library, education and park boards, a representative in the General Assembly, and the nominee of the Democratic party for Lieutenant-Governor and Governor. He had served as President General of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, and Governor of the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut. He had served in various capacities the charity and welfare organizations of his community; had been a director of a national bank and a trustee and president of a savings bank, and he had served as president of two important social organizations.\n\nIt would be impossible to adequately cover the many activities of Judge Beardsley in this sketch. One can only say he brought honor and distinction to all.\n\nHe was a good citizen and a good neighbor and countless deeds proved both. His personal life matched his public. He was a cultivated and a truehearted gentleman, kind in heart, gentle and sweet in disposition, generous in action, loyal and just to all, at home in every circle, never losing his natural dignity, yet meeting the contacts of the humblest in perfect equality and counting the hours of each day too few in which to minister to his stricken or sorrowing friends. He honored the law and was true to its high purposes and loyal to its ideals.\n\nJudge Beardsley died March 2d, 1923, and his funeral was held from the South Congregational Church with which he had so long worshipped. Many were the tears shed on that occasion in that crowded edifice. The feeling of personal loss oppressed all. The wise counselor, the helpful friend, the warm hearted, loving and lovable man would walk with them no more.\n\n*Prepared by Charles Stuart Canfield, Esq., of the Fairfield County Bar, at the request of the Reporter.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 58, pages 604 - 606\n\nSIDNEY BURR BEARDSLEY, ex-judge of the Supreme Court of Errors, died at Bridgeport where he had resided most of his professional life, on the 21st day of April, 1890, aged sixty seven.\n\nJudge Beardsley was born in Monroe in this state in 1823. He was the son of Hon. Cyrus H. Beardsley, who in 1846 was speaker of the House of Representatives of the state for several years judge of the County Court of Fairfield County. He prepared for college and entered Yale College, but did not graduate, afterwards receiving an honorary degree, studied law, and was admitted to the bar of Fairfield County in 1843. He began the practice of law in Norwalk, but soon after removed to Bridgeport, where he resided until his death.\n\nJudge Beardsley was a man of strong intellect, characterized by sound judgment and vigorous common sense, rather than brilliancy. As an advocate at the bar he never attempted to be rhetorical, nor to play upon emotions or passions of a jury, but presented his points in plain and simple language, addressed to their understandings, and with great clearness both of conception and statement. His arguments to the court were generally a thorough discussion of the legal principles involved, and were never overlaid with exhaustive legal authorities nor weakened by legal niceties. He soon acquired a prominent position in his profession, and a large and lucrative practice. He had very little personal ambition, and his best professional efforts were always called out by his interest for his clients rather than by a desire to add to his own reputation. He was entirely unassuming and wholly without pretension, and seemed indifferent to those honors that most men are so eager to obtain. He was elected to the State Senate in 1858, and was induced to run for Congress in 1869 upon the Republican ticket against William H. Barnum, afterwards United States senator; carrying his own city of Bridgeport and most of the towns of his county, but defeated upon the whole vote. There is believed are the only political offices that he ever held or aspired to.\n\nWhile Judge Beardsley was very successful at the bar, his mind was pre-eminently judicial in its character. He looked the judge. Quiet, imperturbable, with a compact and sturdy frame, and a countenance that, though easily lighted up, wore in repose a look of austerity, he seemed well adapted to hold the scales of justice, and lay down, with calm and sound judgment, the law between man and man. He had in a high degree that special judicial faculty that enables a judge to see through the complications of a case into the heart of it and to strip the legal question involved of all the inessentials that so often cluster about and obscure it.\n\nIt was therefore with much satisfaction to the profession and the public that in 1874 he accepted a seat on the bench of the Superior Court from which he was elevated to the Supreme Court of Errors in March, 1887. The last position he held, faithfully and acceptably discharging its duties, until the first day of November, 1889, when a resignation sent to the governor several months before, took effect. His failing health was the cause of his resignation.\n\nJudge Beardsley was a man of fine social qualities and was always a welcome attendant upon the festive gatherings of his professional brethren, and a welcome guest at private hospitalities, while he found much pleasure in receiving his friends at his own attractive home. In all the intercourse of life he was courteous, affable and kindly. He was true and faithful in his friendships, and the writer feels that in his death he has lost a warm personal friend.\n\nHe was married in his early manhood to Ann Eliza Daskam of Norwalk, who with a son and two married daughters, survives him.\n\nAt a meeting of the Fairfield County bar, held soon after Judge Beardlsey's death, appropriate resolutions of affection and respect were passed, upon which a number of the leading lawyers of the county spoke in eulogistic terms of his fine qualities of personal and professional character. Among those who addressed the bar on that occasion were Messrs. D. B. Lockwood, H. S. Sanford, J. B. Curtis, R. E. De Forest, L. N. Middlebrook, A. B. Woodward, G. W. Warner, S. B. Sumner, and A. B. Beers. A paper read by Judge Lockwood gives so full and interesting a sketch of the judge both in his professional life and in his personal relations, that it is given entire. It was as follows:--\n\n\"During the session of the county court at Fairfield in December 1849, I was introduced to Sidney B. Beardsley. I had been for some months reciting to the late Hon. Thomas B. Osborne, than a resident of Fairfield, and was desirous of entering a law office to pursue my studies. Upon asking Mr. Beardsley upon what terms I could study law under him, he promptly replied that if I would enter his office he would charge me nothing for tuition. In January, 1850, I entered his office as a law student, where I remained until my admission to the bar in August, 1851. During the time I was a student in his office I conceived an attachment for him which has ripened into a friendship of forty years' duration. The memories of those student days crowd in upon me like a flood upon this occasion. In those days there were a great many more trials before justices of the peace in surrounding towns than now. He always took me with him on such occasions, and my first insight into the practice of law was gained in legal contests before county justices, where Belden and Sturges and Loomis and Ferry and Treat, and others of equal ability, were his opponents.\n\n\"As a lawyer he seemed to me to comprehend a case more readily than any other lawyer I ever knew. His mind was symmetrical, well balanced and comprehensive, and he almost invariably reached the right conclusion, apparently by sort of intuition. He was a strong advocate, not indulging in flights of eloquence nor addressing the passions or emotions of a jury, but in plain concise and vigorous language he appealed to their intelligence and common sense. While at the bar he had a large clientage, and was retained in most of the important cases that were contested in our courts. In the trial of cases he took but few notes, but his retentive memory enabled him to state correctly any important item in testimony. He was a man of keen perceptions, a good judge of human nature, and could fathom the motives of men. He was a favorite with the members of the bar, and as courteous as he was congenial. He possessed a rare combination of brilliant qualities that made him the most companionable man I ever met.\n\n\"In 1874 he was appointed one of the judges of the Superior Court. Hon. Nathaniel Wheeler was that year a member of the state senate, and united with the members of the bar in pressing his name for the position of judge, for which he was eminently well-fitted. As a judge - a trier of cases - he had few equals. He was endowed by nature with a legal mind. While fully recognizing the demands of justice and law, he had at the same time a lively conscience and a tender heart. He had a keen appreciation of what constituted judicial integrity, and had the faculty of discovering what belonged to equity and good conscience. He was the \"upright judge.\" In 1887 he was promoted to the bench of the Supreme Court of Errors, which position he held until November 1st, 1889, when failing health compelled him to relinquish its arduous duties. In this, the highest court in our state, will be found the most enduring monument of his professional learning in the opinions he has left recorded.\n\n\"As a citizen and in all the relations of private life he won the respect and esteem of all with whom he became associated. He was the idol of his family, and was tenderly and devotedly attached to his wife and children and grandchildren and the endearments of home.\n\n\"His death is a public loss; and while we are met to express our mutual sympathy and to speak our common grief, I cannot but feel a personal loss in the death of him who was my godfather in the law.

He was the son of Thomas Bennett and Mary Ann (Hull) Bennett of New Haven. His father attended the Yale School of Law from 1835 to 1837, practiced in New Haven and was for a time a judge of the Municipal Court. Brothers of William were Thomas G. Bennett, Yale `70S, who was head of the Winchester Arms Company for a long time and a trustee of the, Sheffield Scientific School; Joseph H. Bennett, Yale `73, and George H. Bennett, ex-'74. William attended General Russell's Collegiate and Commercial Institute in New Haven and took the degree of B.A. at Yale in. 1869 and the LL.B. Degree at the Yale School of Law in 1871. In his student days, he was active in many ways, being a member of his school baseball team and in college a member of Beethoven Society, Delta Kappa, Linonia and Phi Theta Psi fraternities. He was admitted to the bar in 1871. Quite early in his practice he became a partner with Tilton E. Doolittle and Henry Stoddard in the firm of Doolittle, Stoddard & Bennett, and after Henry Stoddard's retirement from the firm continued in partnership with Mr. Doolittle and later with George A. Fay. From 1895 to 1898 he taught insurance, and later contracts, in the Yale Law School.\n\nJudge Bennett was appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas for New Haven County in 1905 and to the Superior Court Bench in 1908. On his retirement from the Superior Court upon reaching the age of seventy he was appointed corporation counsel of the city of New Haven by Mayor David E. FitzGerald and served in that capacity during Mayor FitzGerald's two terms of office, until 1923.\n\nJudge Bennett was married on June 5, 1878, in Brooklyn, New York, to Frances Theodosia, daughter of George Woolsey and Mary Ann Bardin (Richardson) Welles, who died October 25, 1888. They had three children: Ethel Welles, well known as an artist the wife of Walter Boudewyn Schiffer; Mary Elizabeth Sanderson, who for a time studied at the Yale School of Music and died August 9, 1920; and Francis Theodore, who died December 16, 1918, a few years after graduating college.\n\nFor a time after his retirement from the Superior Court bench Judge Bennett continued actively at work as state referee and, as has already been noted, as corporation counsel of New Haven. He gradually relinquished his professional activities and enjoyed well-merited quiet, the satisfaction of life with his daughter and her family and the indulgence of reading and of words, spending a large part of his time in his summer home in the retirement of the hills of the southern Berkshires. Until the last he retained his facilities, his interest in affairs and his enjoyment of humor, and within but two hours of his sudden death he was dressing to join his family circle. He had given away his professional library and destroyed his papers. His death was due to acute heart failure. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven.\n\nThere are now almost none who can remember Judge Bennett in his active professional career. The writer of this memorial recalls him on the Superior Court bench as a quiet, courteous, attentive trier, of sound and deliberate judgment, applying his knowledge and long experience readily but never hastily, and off the bench giving to the problems presented to him the careful consideration of a scholar.\n\nIn his earlier practice he may have been more aggressive than he appeared to be as a judge upon the bench, but that is doubtful. His two partners, Tilton E. Doolittle and Henry Stoddard, were both of the aggressive type. In 1896 ex-Governor Charles R. Ingersoll, in presenting resolutions in the Superior Court upon the death of Mr. Doolittle, said this of Judge Bennett's partner: \"He never posed for what he was not. He never posed, indeed, for anything that he was. In all his ways, in all his moods, under all circumstances, he was simply himself, -- he was Doolittle.\" While according to the writer's recollection William Bennett and Tilton E. Doolittle were strikingly opposite to one another in manner, yet of Judge Bennett, with his quiet but unassuming assurance based on unwavering principle and sound conviction, those same words of Governor Ingersoll might well be spoken.\n\nIt is interesting to go back and look at one of the earliest cases in which our friend appeared, City of New Haven v. New York and N. H. R.R. Co., 39 Conn. 128, argued at the February Term of the Supreme Court in 1872, Doolittle and Bennett for the plaintiff. The question was whether it was the duty of the defendant to keep in repair a certain portion of a highway leading to a railroad bridge. The defendant had been notified to repair and upon its neglect to do so the city made the needed repairs and sought to recover the expense in an action of assumpsit on the common counts, which was first tried before a justice of the peace, then in the Court of Common Please and reserved for advice in the high court. George H. Watrous, afterwards president of the railroad, appeared for the defendant. The Supreme Court at that time consisted of Butler, C. J., Park, Carpenter, Foster and Seymour, Js. We here see the beginning of a notable career dating far back of the memory of anyone now at the bar-a battle between the stalwarts Doolittle and Watrous with the probability, on the side, that Bennett, the younger participant, had prepared studiously a case involving the respective legal obligations of the two great corporations brought upon a small bill within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace and yet fought out to the limit to establish a principle. In little more than a year after that case, Doolittle and Bennett for the plaintiff city were again before the Supreme Court against the railroad company in two cases in an effort to collect taxes alleged to be due to the town and city of New Haven, with Watrous again for the defendants. Judgment in both was for the defendant but in one case the force of Mr. Doolittle and the industry of our friend Bennett won the approval of two of the five judges.\n\nWhile on the Superior bench, Judge Bennett was called to sit as a member of the Supreme Court at two or more full terms of court to fill a vacancy caused by the death of absence of one of the justices.\n\nHe lived and served his clients and his fellow citizens through a period which marks a notable development of the law and its practice - a change too, to be regretted, in the free intimacy of daily life of the lawyers. Mr. Doolittle, Judge Stoddard and our friend, when they were associated, occupied offices in what was afterwards known as the Law Chambers, next to what was then the county court house. In the same building were the offices of Charles R. Ingersoll, John S. Beach, his son John K. Beach and others. Those men in those days knew and visited one another and suspicion might be warranted that occasionally they indulged with one another in lighter pastime than argument of legal questions. They fought with one another nobly in the courts-in their offices fraternized as sympathetic, even jovial neighbors. From the start in that company William L. Bennett lived the life and did the work of an active professional and judicial career and when his work was done retired with the respect and affection of all his associates to enjoy the quiet of a peaceful old age.\n\n*Prepared by Leonard M. Daggett, of the New Haven bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 47, pages 604 - 606\n\nALFRED BLACKMAN, for many years a leading member of the New Haven bar, died at that city the 28th of April, 1880, in his seventy third year. He was born in Newtown, in this state, on the 28th of December, 1807, and there spent his boyhood. He was graduated at Yale College in the class of 1828, and after completing his law studies settled in Humphreyville, (now Seymour,) where he practiced his profession until 1842, when removed to Waterbury, and a year later to New Haven, where he spent the rest of his life.\n\nIn the year 1842 he was elected to the State Senate from the fifth senatorial district, and in 1855 represented the town of New Haven in the lower house of the General Assembly; and while residing in New Haven he held successively the offices of Judge of Probate, Judge of the County Court, Mayor of the city, and clerk of the United States District Court, holding the last office from 1853 to 1868.\n\nIn the year 1871, owing to the infirmities induced by repeated attacks of rheumatic gout, he established his office at his residence, retiring from public practice, but continuing his advice and counsel to some of his old clients. His health gradually failed from the inroads of the disease, which had become chronic, and during the last thee or four months of his life he was confined to his house, retaining however vivacity and cheerfulness that had characterized him through life, and a lively interest in all that was going on in the outside world.\n\nAt a bar meeting held upon the occasion of his death, and which was presided over by Charles Ives, one of the older members of the New Haven bar, who has himself since passed away, the following felicitous sketch of his character was given by ex-Governor Charles R. Ingersoll, in seconding some appropriate resolutions that were offered.\n\nADDRESS OF MR. INGERSOLL.\n\nMr. Chairman: There are a few of us here-and when I look around upon the many who are here the reflection that here are so few becomes a very sober one-to whom the event that brings the bar together at this time haws come with a peculiar impressiveness. It breaks about the last link that has connected us with the old bar of New Haven County. That bar, I mean, into which you, Mr. Chairman, and I entered more than a generation of men ago, but of whose contests we were for a while at least, the spectators rather than the sharers. In the lists of those days there was no more active champion than he whose death we are now here to deplore. Thirty years ago, in all courts and in all that our courts had to do, Alfred Blackman was a conspicuous man. And conspicuous, I beg to be understood, Mr. Chairman, because he deserved to be so. For no one of this bar whom I can recall had less desire than he for the distinction which comes from mere display. Nay, nothing would so quickly loosen those finely feathered arrows of his irony which upon just occasion he could so happily use, as the shams and vanities of human life - and nowhere was he so impatient of their exhibition as in the circle of our profession. But he was, at that time, in full tide of professional success-in the prime of life-a busy general practitioner-with a reputation already made as a trusted and faithful lawyer-and that it was certainly his ambition to be. And faithful, Mr. Chairman, let me add, in that high sense which implies something more than mere fidelity to the clients whom one serves. For he had an ardent temperament and it carried him into his cases with his whole strength and an unstinted zeal, but it did not betray him into a forgetfulness of that respect which belongs to the good opinion of our fellow-men or of those grave responsibilities which are suggested by the attorney's oath. And for this vocation he was, I think, admirably equipped. His intellectual qualities were indicated by this robust frame, lighted up as it was by a bright and cheerful countenance. They were sound and vigorous throughout, cultivated by much reading and reflection, but rich in \"saving common sense\" and with faculties that had been quickened and sharpened and made ready for the varied demands of general practice by a genial association with his fellow-men, and a keen observation of human nature in its manifold phases. In this latter respect he was remarkable. He had rare sagacity. His perception of human motives-his penetration into the hidden springs of human conduct-seemed to me instinctive, and he had that power we call magnetic of putting himself in accord with the varying moods of those he sought to convince. His presentation of cases was, therefore, always forcible, but in those cases where the tribunal was a jury drawn from the body of New Haven County, among whom the earlier portions of his professional life had been passed, I have heard appeals from him which were as effective as any I ever heard at this bar. In this he was greatly aided by a characteristic aptness of language. How he delighted in those simple and sturdy phrases which he would call his \"old Saxon,\" and which went so straight to the understanding and the sympathies of his hearers! He had, indeed, a natural fondness for the study of the English tongue, and frequently I have found him in his office enjoying the \"good reading\" which he used to say he never failed to find in his Worcester's Dictionary, of which the best edition he could command was always upon his office table. And to this taste was doubtless due that excellent diction he possessed, and which was manifested in every thing coming from his pen.\n\nIt is not easy for me, Mr. Chairman to discriminate between the professional and the merely personal character of Judge Blackman. He had such a strong individuality that to those who knew him well he was the same man, whether within or without his office. But he had a large acquaintance and many associations in this community that were not professional. I need not speak of the respect which his sterling qualities commended as a citizen, and which led him, without his seeking, into many positions of public trust. No one was better known upon our streets, and his affable presence, companionable ways and shrewd and lively conversation, brought him from all pursuits warm personal friends. It was my good fortune to be among them. He came to New Haven about the time I came to the bar, and we happened to become office neighbors, and so we continued to be so long as he continued in practice. The association soon brought us into relations of friendship. I forbear to speak of its enjoyments here. But it has led me to see much of him since his infirm health compelled him, some years ago, to lay aside his armor and retire to the quiet of his home and library. The shades of life's evening have been slowly, but very surely, closing about him for much of this time, and he has suffered much, occasionally very much. But it has brought no gloom to his clear conscious and cheerful spirit. And the same bright disposition, kind heart and buoyant temper that distinguished him in the heat of life's battle, has, in mercy, attended him as he has \"gathered the drapery of his couch about him.\"\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 143, pages 737 - 739\n\nWith the death on June 18, 1956, of John Rufus Booth in his eighty-third year, there ended a long life of service to the state and its people. Judge Booth was born in New Haven on September 26, 1873, the son of James Walter Booth and Marguerite Angaud Booth. He was named after his grandfathers, John Angaud and Rufus Booth. He had one sister, Lena, who, sixteen months his senior, is still living.\n\nAs children, John and Lena were inseparable, and were often referred to as \"the twins.\" They were members of the same class in grade school for several years, and both attended Hillhouse High School in New Haven. Lena Booth now fondly remembers their long walks to school together. The bond between brother and sister persisted to the end. In speaking of her early memories, Miss Booth describes what was, without doubt, the prevailing characteristic of Judge Booth's whole life. \"He was,\" she recalls, \"a sweet boy. Everyone liked him, and he liked everybody.\" Those who knew him in later years can easily recognize, in his genuine, selfless human warmth, the trait which so early made its impression on his sister.\n\nUpon completion of a two-year commercial high school course, Judge Booth worked for two years to support himself and finance his further education. He entered Yale Law School at twenty-one and was graduated in the class of 1897, which had among its members many men who have distinguished themselves at the bar and on the bench. Close upon graduation from law school, he married Grace Beers of Orange. The two children of this union are now deceased. A son died early in life. The daughter, Marjorie, died in 1943, leaving two daughters.\n\nAt the outset of Judge Booth's legal career, the hard years of the beginning, which then as now called for industry, integrity, ability and a pleasing personality, progress was not spectacular but steady. That he succeeded and firmly made his way is shown by his appointment as city attorney of New Haven in 1911 and as a judge of the City Court in 1913. He was on the City Court bench four years and soon showed the judicial fitness that so distinctly marked him throughout the remainder of his life. The business of the City Court was, to him, of the utmost importance. His concern was to supply kindly, helpful treatment in the incipient stages of the tragedies of humanity, to meet the responsibility of wielding a potent influence upon the future of the many persons who came before him, and to avoid the danger of stirring resentment in those whose helplessness might make them safe objects for verbal lashings. His philosophy of judicial conduct, developed in the City Court, characterized his conduct during his tenure in the higher courts. This philosophy is well exemplified in the counsel given by him in later years to a newly appointed judge of the Superior Court: \"Remember always the poor devil before you has plenty of trouble already and cannot defend himself against a scourging from the bench. You can much more justly fix his sentence if you have held your tongue.\"\n\nIn 1917 he was named the first public defender for New Haven County but did not accept the position. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas for New Haven County in 1920 and continued in that position until his appointment as a judge of the Superior Court in 1927. He served on the Superior Court until 1943, when he retired because of the constitutional limitation as to age. During these years, he remained the same modest, studious, careful, affable and courageous person he had always been. The possession of power did not change him. As his sister has said, his indignation, whether in private or public life, could be very real, but its only outward sign was the flash of his expressive eyes. He would never permit any feelings of slight or of friendship, or the recognition of possible hostility in others, to influence his action. This strict impartiality was maintained not only in matters which might he the subject of appeal but also throughout the broad field of judicial discretion which, under our system of jurisprudence, lies largely beyond the reach of appellate review.\n\nHis dedication, his restraint and his sense of justice produced remarkably worthy results. Appeals from his decisions were few in number and seldom resulted in reversal. One of the best testimonials to his judicial qualities is found in the words of a layman, given at a session of the Superior Court in Bridgeport on November 10, 1933. On that occasion a member of the jury then finishing its tour of duty remarked as follows: \"Your Honor, the jury has asked me to express a few words of felicitation to you personally in view of our happy experience with you in this court during the last two months. I think we can say very conscientiously that you personally have impressed us. We recognize your grace and grit, your poise and character, and your activity and aggressiveness . . . . We have been impressed with your mental balance, with your sense of the dignity of the law, . . . of the ... needs of humanity, the reality of the problems of life, of the suffering of people who are hurt . . . . And in view of all of this we go away with a high respect for the court, with a real, honest appreciation of the place of law in society, with the feeling that lawyers and judges and juries can really serve humanity in the interest of home, of personal safety, and of the development of human life.\"\n\nAs a boy, Judge Booth had been a member of the Christ Church and of its choir. In mature life he had a fine baritone voice, and often sang for the pleasure he could give groups of his friends or as a member of such organizations as the Gounod Club and the Masonic Lodge. His second wife, a musician of distinction, was Lenna Mallory, to whom he was married in 1918. Her tastes closely paralleled his. They were both devoted to outdoor activities, particularly golf, and both enjoyed fine music and literature.\n\nJudge Booth was for many years active in Masonic organizations. At his death he was the oldest living past master of Wooster Lodge No. 79, A.F. & A.M., and a member of the New Haven Commandery, Knights Templar, of the Franklin Chapter, R.A.M., of the Lafayette Consistory of Bridgeport, and of the Pyramid Temple, A.A.O.N.M.S. He was a member of the Graduates Club, the New Haven Country Club and the New Haven Grays.\n\nAlthough he had no formal church connection in later life, his close friends knew that he had an abiding faith in the great tenets of Christianity. He prayed often, but his petitions were more likely to be for his suffering friends than for himself.\n\nSeven years ago Judge Booth became gravely ill, and his physicians doubted that he could survive more than a few weeks. This emergency, as well as his sudden loss of sight, was met by Mrs. Booth with rare courage. Her devotion made it possible for him to live during the remaining years in comparative comfort and the fellowship of his friends.\n\nAfter his retirement, Judge Booth continued, so far as his health permitted, to serve the bench, the bar and the public. In addition to his work as a state referee, he made himself available to fellow judges and lawyers. He kept up with the development of the law by having recent decisions read to him. He came to his courthouse office almost every day. Many went there to consult him or simply to visit with a man of great heart and wide experience. So it was almost until the end. For a while he was missed at the courthouse, and then it became known that he would come no more. And thus ended one of those quiet, devoted lives which only in retrospect assume their true proportions.\n\n*Prepared by Thomas R. Robinson, of the New Haven bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 92, pages 714 - 715\n\nCHARLES HENRY BRISCOE, a descendant, in the eighth generation, of Nathaniel Briscoe who came to Newtown, Massachusetts, in 1631, was born in Newtown, Connecticut, December 20th, 1831, and died suddenly at Hartford, January 21st, 1918. For sixty-four years he practiced law in the courts of this State, and in his death the bar of Hartford County lost a venerable and respected member.\n\nHis early education was obtained in the schools of his native town, after which he studied law with the Hon. Amos B. Treat (See 54 Conn. 601) in Newtown, was admitted to the bar in 1854, and then came to Enfield where he always resided. Three years later (1857) Enfield chose him to represent her in the legislature, elected him again in 1864 and in 1878; on the latter occasion he was made Speaker of the House. He was a member of the State Senate in 1861 and chairman of the important committee on Military Affairs. In 1868, when the Court of Common Pleas was established, he became its judge, a position he held with exceptional ability and satisfaction until his return in 1875 to the active practice of his profession. While he was on the bench only nineteen appeals were taken from his decisions or judgments, and of these, fifteen were affirmed and only four reversed—a remarkable showing. From 1877 to 1881 he was a partner in the firm of Briscoe & Maltbie, and from 1882 to the end of 1893 it was the privilege of the writer to be his associate. The death of his son Willis in April, 1913 (See 87 Conn. 713), saddened his few remaining years.\n\nJudge Briscoe’s wide acquaintance brought him clients from all walks of life, and to their service he gave his time and his energy without reserve—and usually with results pleasing alike to them and to him. He was above all a jury lawyer and a most successful one, though it is not easy to discover the secret of his power. One of his few surviving contemporaries, writing of his ability as a verdict-getter, says: “He made no pretense of being an orator or of displaying any great learning, but somehow he got hold of the hearts and minds of the jury and held them to the end in a quiet homely way. During the last forty years of his practice at the Hartford bar he was, to say the least, the equal if not the superior of any brother lawyer. When he and Judge Eggleston joined their efforts before a jury—and they were many, many times together how very few cases you can recall in which they were not victorious. In saying these things about his power with a jury, I am not intimating that when he thoroughly studied a question of law you could lightly dispute him in his conclusions, for you would be very apt to find yourself in the wrong if you did.”\n\nJudge Briscoe did, however, possess the ability to look a fact in the face and to appreciate its full weight and significance, whether pro or con. In other words, he sized up a situation as the man in the street, the ordinary, average, every-day man, regarded it; and gift—for it was a gift—not only enabled him to settle the bad cases, but gave him an immense advantage in knowing how to approach the “twelve good men and true” in the jury-box. He always looked for justice, and if he found that, he spent but little time in trying to bolster up the case with rules of law or judicial precedents. Naturally he became a conservative, safe adviser, and the arbiter of incipient quarrels and neighborhood differences.\n\nBy his friends and associates, at the bar he was esteemed for his loyalty, his genial wit, his unswerving honesty, his kindly sympathy, his courtesy and willingness to oblige. During his later years he gradually relinquished practice, but he still came to his office and with a keen sense of humor would recall his earlier experiences at the bar with the giants of those days. He was well informed generally, and in conversation rarely failed to add something of value to the discussion. With a sweet and lovable personality his memory will long remain a fragrant one to his professional brethren.\n\n*Prepared by the Reporter.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 87, pages 713 - 715\n\nWILLIS ANSON BRISCOE, son of Charles H. and Anna Judson (Traver) Briscoe, was born at Enfield in this State December 16th, 1856, and died suddenly at Norwich on the 28th day of April, 1913. Of New England ancestry, he was a descendant in the ninth generation of Nathaniel Briscoe, who came to Watertown, Massachusetts, in 1639, and whose son, Nathaniel, afterward removed to Milford, Connecticut, where he was one of the ten original proprietors of that town.\n\nWillis received his education in the public schools at Thompsonville, then at the Hartford High School, where he was graduated in 1873, and in the fall of that year entered Yale and was graduated among the younger members of his class in 1877. As his father— who is still living at the age of eighty-two—was judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County from 1869 to 1875, and before and since in active practice, Willis grew up in a legal atmosphere and readily took to the study of law, which he pursued in the office of the Hon. T. C. Coogan in Enfield, and was admitted to the bar in May, 1879, after a most creditable oral examination. In the late fall or early winter of 1880 he opened an office in Bristol, Connecticut, in company with the present Reporter of the Supreme Court, and gave a large part of his time for the next few months in assisting to prepare the first edition of the Connecticut Index Digest, thereby acquiring an unusual familiarity with the judicial reports of this State.\n\nIt was not long, however, before the real work of his life began. In August or September, 1881, John C. Averill, Esq., of Norwich left the office of the Hon. Jeremiah Halsey to become clerk of the Superior Court in New London County, and Mr. Briscoe took the vacant place in Mr. Halsey’s office and incidentally also became Mr. Averill’s life long friend. At that time Mr. Halsey was undoubtedly the leader of the bar in eastern Connecticut and an association with him afforded Willis a chance to demonstrate his ability and worth—and well did he prove them. Until Mr. Halsey’s death in 1869 Willis was his constant companion and fellow-worker, and each held the other in affectionate esteem and regard. Thereafter the clients of Mr. Halsey turned to Mr. Briscoe for advice, and if they had not already learned to value his opinion, it did not take them long to do so; for they found him not only sagacious, sound, sane and safe, but also industrious and resourceful, and above all honest and with an eye single to their interests. Honesty in the ordinary sense is common enough; but Mr. Briscoe was above all honest with himself, and could not be swerved or tempted to shade or color his conclusions to suit the wishes or hopes of his clients, as many a man may do unconsciously. This trait, coupled with a capacity for analysis of remarkable power, which enabled him to unravel perplexing and difficult situations and to hold up to his listener the very pith and marrow of the case in hand, won him the lasting confidence of an ever expanding clien"
