Spundy attended Bullock County High School and later the Job Corps where he graduated and received his diploma and certification in auto mechanics. Spundy enjoyed landscaping, gardening and anything that involved the outdoors. In his spare-time he could be found mowing, fixing an engine or just tidying things up around his immaculately kept home. He kept busy showing God his appreciation for the blessings that had been bestowed upon him. His attention to order and timeliness led to him receiving management positions at Brownfield Farms. While at Brownfield Farms, he acquired his Commercial Driver’s License and later became a driver/transporter for Shoreline Transportation, where he drove until his departure. Being the oldest son in a family of ten, Spundy took on the leadership role and was big on family. He was a protector and loving in ensuring that his younger sibling and his immediate household were taken care of. His grandkids stole his heart and he treasured the time he spent with them. Family gatherings brought out the best in him. He set the pace by being up early making calls, cutting and raking yards, icing down SODAS and making sure everything (except the food-that was the ladies’ job) was prepared. Spundy was a hard-working REAL man. He was not afraid to show emotions and he loved his neighbor as himself. Mark 12:31 “Love you neighbor as yourself ”\n\nSpundy was preceded in death by His father, Henry James Baldwin, his mother, Bertha Lee Baldwin, father in law, Willie Henry Fitzpatrick, brothers-in-law Robert “Puddy” Jenkins, James “Peanut” Jenkins, and Sidney Jenkins.
