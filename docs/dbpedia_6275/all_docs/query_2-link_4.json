        "text": "HENRY BALDWIN was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on January 14, 1780. He attended Yale College and was graduated in 1797. He moved immediately to Philadelphia, where he read law in a law office and was soon admitted to the Pennsylvania bar. He moved to Pittsburgh, where he established a law practice with two partners. Baldwin also became joint owner of a newspaper and other business enterprises. He served on the Cityâ€™s Public Safety Council during the War of 1812. In 1816, Baldwin was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He served as Chairman of the House Committee on Domestic Manufacturers and was twice re-elected but was forced to resign because of ill health in 1822. Baldwin recovered and resumed his law practice and business interests in 1824, along with his civic activities and his role as an unofficial political leader of Allegheny County. On January 4, 1830, President Andrew Jackson nominated Baldwin to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Senate confirmed the appointment on January 6, 1830. Baldwin served on the Supreme Court for fourteen years. He died on April 21, 1844, at the age of sixty-four."
