After attending Windsor Locks High School, in 1962 he enlisted in the United States Air Force.\n\nHe married Mary Olson Lownds. Together they had six children. His career in the Air Force took him and his growing family to several locations including Hawaii, Germany, Greece, Washington, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. John completed his career with the United States Air Force on January 16, 1978.\n\nJohn and his family put down roots in Gillette, Wyoming where he became a constant presence in the oil field community as a water truck driver. He was well known for his mechanical abilities to fix the unfixable. He could be found tinkering on his latest project car or playing pool at the Corner Pocket. In his later years he would continue to have project cars, play pool and could be found playing cards, chess and Yatzee.\n\nJohn is survived by his children: John (Svetlana) Lownds; Lana (TJ) Wesley; Kathy (Jeff) Cole; Connie (Chad) Hansen; Jason (Elisha) Lownds; and Jessica Dixon; 16 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren; first wife, Mary Lownds; second wife, Jenny Lownds; companion, Evelyn Holt; and his dog Foxie.\n\nJohn is preceded in death by his parents, James and Carol Lownds and brothers Glen, James and Donald. Burial services will be Friday January 26, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. at The Black Hills National Cemetery in Sturgis, South Dakota.\n\nDavid Eugene VanderVoort: 1938 – 2024\n\nMemorial service for Dave VanderVoort will be held at 2:00 p.m., Wednesday, January 31, 2024 at Cam-Plex Heritage Center, with Chaplain Gordon Harper officiating. David VanderVoort, age 85, of Gillette, Wyoming passed away on January 19, 2024 surrounded by loved ones.\n\nDave was born on May 21, 1938 in Billings, Montana to Gertrude Vandersloot and Joseph VanderVoort. He grew up in Montana moving around a little bit, but spent the majority of his childhood in Big Timber, Montana.\n\nAt the age of 17, he enlisted in the Air Force. He spent his 4-year Air Force Career at bases in Cheyenne, WYyoming, Texas, Ellsworth in Rapid City, and some time overseas in Japan. On one of his leaves home from the Air Force he married his wife Inga (Jo) Undem in Helena, Montana with a justice of the peace. Last July they celebrated 65 years of marriage.\n\nAfter his career in the Air Force, he worked construction out of Rapid City, most notably on the highway that leads to Mount Rushmore. He worked construction for a few years until he interviewed for Naramore’s in hopes of starting a job at one of their Ford dealerships either in Newcastle or Gillette at the time. This was the start of a life long career with the Ford dealership in Gillette, Wyoming.\n\nSomewhere in the midst of all of this their two children were born, Claudette in 1961 and Keith in 1963.\n\nDave was incredibly proud of his career at the Ford dealership. He worked all the way from the bottom up, he spent time as a parts guy, shop foreman, mechanic, tow truck driver, and just about anything else they needed around the shop. He spent the end of his career as a salesman, selling many cars to folks from all around. He became quite the symbol for the Ford Dealership. He worked very hard to help his customers and their families, in return they came back specifically to him so that he could help sell them a vehicle time after time. Dave spent well over 60 years of his life working at the Ford dealership in Gillette.\n\nWhile in Gillette, Dave and his wife Jo lived in a few different places making friends that would last a lifetime, in 1975, they bought their little slice of heaven North East of Gillette where they ran cows, sheep, and a couple of horses over the years. The last several years it’s just been a small family haying operation, something that Dave always found enjoyment in and of course some stress as any good farmer knows.\n\nWhen Davie-bob wasn’t working at Ford, you could easily find him working on tractors for himself and others. He was also quite the woodworker; he built many different creations for his grandkids from potty training potties to wooden kitchens and cabinets to play. Back in the 60’s and 70’s Dave was very active in the volunteer Sheriff posse and spent quite a bit of time active with the Gillette Gun Club teaching different aspects of shooting sports. This was something he involved his kids in, it created wonderful memories for all of them.\n\nDave is survived by his wife Jo; his children, Keith (Ann) VanderVoort, Claudette VanderVoort; grandchildren: Kelly (Jason) Heinz, Haley (Austin) Idler, Cole (Makenzie) VanderVoort, and Rachael VanderVoort; he is also survived by his five great-grandchildren: Hayden, Everley, Oaklee, Presley, and Emmett. He is preceded in death by his parents, Joseph and Gertrude; brothers, Harold, Jim, and sister Joyce.\n\nDave was always happiest either running a tractor or petting a good dog. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to Fur Kids Foundation PO Box 7074, Gillette, WY 82717 in remembrance of Dave and his love for animals. There is nothing that would please him more than to know that all pets have their needs met and are well taken care of. Memorials and condolences may also be sent in David’s name in care of Gillette Memorial Chapel 210 West 5th Street, Gillette, WY 82716. Condolences may also be expressed at www.gillettememorialchapel.com\n\nThe family would also like to make a special heartfelt thank you to Thunder Basin Ford and their employees for the love and care that they have always given to the family and the special way they always looked out for Davie-bob. Dave could not have been as good as he was for as long as he was without each and every one of you. From the bottom of our hearts, Thank you."
