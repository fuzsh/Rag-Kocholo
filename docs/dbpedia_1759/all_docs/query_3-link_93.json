        "text": "S. 5-26 Stefan Heid (Rom): Gab es in Rom eine Gemeinde der Quartodezimaner? Abstract: \"Was there a community of Quartodecimans in Rome?\"-The followers of the popular house church theory refer to an alleged quartodeciman (house-)community in Rome in the 2nd century, which existed beside numerous other house churches led by a presbyter until its excommunication under bishop Victor. The essay examines the arguments and comes to the conclusion that such an assertion cannot be substantiated by any text, but is based on a number of hypotheses that are neither individually nor collectively valid. S. 27-42 Ingo Schaaf (Rom): Opfertod und Todessuche als Exemple in Antike und Christentum Abstract: \"Self-sacrifice and the search for death as an example in antiquity and Christianity\"-Since Jesusʼ questioning by Pilate the reactions of the pagans in view of the non-violent steadfastness of persecuted Christians were marked by incomprehension. While such behaviour seemed to the Roman authorities to be nothing more than obstinate, it is well known that Tertullian can speak of the seed of the martyrs' blood burgeoning in the expanding church. But how, intellectually, was the ground prepared for this process, or which views stood in the way of its unfolding? Starting from remarks on the profane concept of μάρτυς/μαρτύριον, the contribution traces the question under which premises the Christian willingness to suffer could be interpreted on the pagan side with particular emphasis on the accusation of suicide. Reciprocally to this it is discussed whether and, if so, in which way pagan ideas and figures offered points of contact for a specific Christian theology of martyrdom or could serve as a contrasting foil against the background of which corresponding ideas could be profiled in late antiquity. In this double perspective, so the basic assumption, one challenges not only the application of conventional derivation models to Christian martyrdom, thus keeping its proprium recognizable, but also better measures its radius of action in the midst of a non-Christian environment. S. 43-55 Domenico Benoci (Rom): Defensores fidei. Die Rolle der scholae peregrinorum in den epigraphischen und urkundlichen Quellen Abstract: \"Defensores fidei: the role of scholae peregrinorum in epigraphic and documentary sources\"-The article proposes hypotheses on the reasons and methods that led, towards the end of the seventh century, to the establishment of the scholae peregrinorum starting from the epigraphic documentation and written sources received. S. 56-79 Arnold Esch (Rom): Von Venedig ins Heilige Land und nach Ägypten. Pilgerberichte als historische Quelle Abstract: \"From Venice to the Holy Land and Egypt: Pilgrim reports as a historical source\"-The article examines what other important information the widely read travelogues of late medieval Jerusalem pilgrims have to offer the historian, in addition to the the actual, religious concerns of their authors: especially for the\n\nWith the gradual spatialization of Christian memory in Late Antiquity, the first Holy Land churches were built in places identified with a particular figure or event of religious significance. This tradition persisted in the construction of churches in the Byzantine, Crusader and modern periods in an evolving Christian “sacred geography”. The pilgrims travelling the Holy Land encountered the loca sancta identified with divine presence, as structured within monumental architecture and represented in its imagery. The following study explores the visual imagery and space of a new pilgrimage site in the map of Christian sacred geography: Magdala, on the north-western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Officially named \"the Magdala Tourist Center\", the site was founded by Fr. Juan Maria Solana, a Catholic priest of the congregation of the Legionaries of Christ, on land that he had purchased gradually, beginning in 2006, in order to build a guest house for pilgrims. The location below Mt. Arbel and north of Tiberias, had been identified since the nineteenth century as the site of Magdala of the New Testament, preserved in the name of the local Arab village el-Mejdel and the Jewish town of Migdal. Salvage excavations on the newly purchased land by the Israeli Antiquities Authority and later by a Mexican delegation, discovered the ruins of a Jewish town from the Early Roman period. Within the ruins, on the site designated for the construction of the guesthouse, a first century synagogue was discovered in 2009. In the main hall of the synagogue the archaeologists discovered a unique stone, covered with reliefs depicting elements from the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. This discovery, which drew immense academic and popular interest, was presented by the initiators of the site as a sign of Divine Providence. The new Magdala Center was termed the \"hometown of Mary Magdalene\", its synagogue presented as the place where Jesus taught, and the new site was defined as a \"crossroads of Jewish and Christian history\". The evolving religious significance of the site was structured into the artistic and architectural design of the Magdala church - officially referred to as a \"spirituality center\" - dedicated in 2014. The guesthouse built later and inaugurated in 2019, looks over the ruins of the synagogue that are the focal point of an archaeological park, in a compound which has since become a tourist attraction and a pilgrimage site. The narrative and the visual and spatial components of the site conform with familiar patterns of Christian localization of religious memory in the Holy Land. However, as in previous periods, the visual features of a holy site are shaped not only by tradition but also by the specific conditions of time and of space. Magdala has been shaped under political, theological and technological conditions that distinguish it dramatically from earlier churches; the new Christian site has been developed under the authority of the Jewish state, in the context of post-conciliar Catholicism, and within a technological reality radically different from that in which pilgrims encountered their destinations in the past. This study examines both the ways in which the visual and spatial components of Magdala resonate with existing traditions, and the ways in which it diverges from them, expressing new forms and meanings of Christian sacred space. On the basis of the historical, theoretical and methodological background discussed in the introduction, the study explores the visual shaping of Magdala as a pilgrimage site through three aspects. The first chapter examines the architecture of the Magdala church, in relation to traditions of Holy Land church architecture. This comparative perspective, in which the main points of reference will be Byzantine and modern architecture, points to the use of traditional architectural elements that serve to validate the site's sanctity as a locus sanctus, while the novelties in the shaping of these elements indicate the formation of new relations between subject and ecclesiastical space. I suggest that these features challenge the traditional boundaries between the sacred and the profane by the sacred being visually available, ratherthan concealed. The second chapter on the artistic imagery of the Magdala church is comprised of several sections, each of which discusses the location, medium, iconography and style of one work of art or a series of works of art in or near the church. Two major questions run through each of the sections: the relations between image and viewer, and between image and place as locus sanctus. The artistic localization of New Testament events and the original form and content of representation in the various works of art, express new interpretations of religious figures and themes in relation to iconographic traditions. These new meanings, I suggest, resonate with contemporary Catholicism in the contexts of gender and Jewish and Christian relations, as well as with contemporary forms of subjectivity. The third chapter examines the compound of the Magdala Center and its surroundings, from which the church draws much of its symbolic meaning. Part 1 focuses on the archaeological ruins and their display, integration and replication in the Madgala Center and in other sites of display. Special attention is paid to the Magdala stone and the meanings that have been attached to it through narrative of agents and visitors to the site, and through multiple forms of visual representation. Part 2 examines the natural and commercial landscape of the Magdala Center within the Christian sacred geography by the Sea of Galilee, and its visual representations in artistic imagery, in pilgrimage trails to Magdala, in virtual pilgrimage, and in products offered for sale in the Magdala Center. In the conclusion of this chapter, I point to the historical narrative and image of the Holy Land /Israel constructed through the archaeology and landscape, and to the symbiotic relations between the religious and commercial landscape. In the conclusion, I suggest that Magdala expresses an affinity to various aspects of Protestant aesthetics which are described in each of the chapters. However, while Magdala differs from earlier modern Catholic churches, I suggest that it shares some distinct features with a number of more recent Catholic sites in Israel, marking the emergence of a new phase of Holy Land Christian sites. This emerging phase is characterized by various forms of visual realism and symbolism that shape new relations between viewer and image, between space and text, and between Christians and Jews. Ultimately, this new phase redefines subjective experience and the collective significance of Christian sacred space in the Holy Land."
