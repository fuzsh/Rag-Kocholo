        "text": "A fund for extraordinary vet expenses for any of our cats in desperate medical need.\n\nPaws and Whiskers is pleased to share a new way to give! We now have an opportunity to provide extraordinary medical care to the sickest and most severely injured cats in our care through Phoebe's Fund. This fund was started with a generous $30,000 donation by Susan Matz in honor of her husband, Robert, and their cat, Phoebe, who was a tremendous source of comfort to Robert during his treatment for cancer. In addition, Susan has pledged to match donations specifically designated for Phoebe's Fund, up to $5,000 annually. We are deeply grateful to Susan, Robert, and Phoebe for the establishment of this fund.\n\nWe would love to have you partner with us to help our most vulnerable cats get the care they need through your generous donation to Phoebe's Fund. Simply fill out the donation form below. Every dollar counts and no donation is too small! Thank you for helping us take care of our sick and injured cats!\n\nIf you have an old vehicle you are looking to get rid of, but you don't want to go through the hassle of finding a private buyer or accepting a low trade-in offer, perhaps you should consider donating it to those in need. You can rest comfortably knowing that we will put it to good use in saving and caring for cats in need."
