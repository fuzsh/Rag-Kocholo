        "text": "Andrew John McNeely\n\n(October 12, 1882âJuly 5, 1982)\n\nAndrew John McNeely Biography\n\nAndrew John McNeely was born to Robert Campbell and Phoebe Jane Walker McNeely on October 14, 1882, in Dunkineely, Ireland. He was one of eleven children. John married Annie in 1909. (The 1910 Census says her name was Annie. John told Pat Oakes her name was Hannah). Annie was born in 1888, in New Jersey.) and they had a son Bob. John worked as a stenographer at a soap factory in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Annie died six months later from endocarditis. He next married Mabel Claire Barrett (1884â1977) on August 14, 1913, in Buffalo, New York. Mabel was the daughter of Clarence A. and Angie Wheeler of Oak Park, IL.She was born in Chicago on November 13, 1884. In 1918, John and Mabel were living in Erie, New York, where John worked as a machine operator for the American Car and Foundry Company. In 1942, he and Mabel were living in High View, NY where he worked as an inspector for the NY O & W Railroad. in Middletown, Orange, NY. John and Hannah's son, Theodore Robert \"Bob\" McNeely, born September 4, 1910, was married to Frances McNeely. Bob was a dentist in Austin, TX. He had lived in the Congregational Church basement during some of his time at the University of Texas. He and Frances were active members. John attended also and was an especially good friend of Rev. John Towery who helped him greatly as the years piled up. Upon his death, John left a legacy to the church. Bob died November 10, 1978. His mother's name on the death certificate was listed as \"Annie Doe.\" She was John's first wife. This was likely a result of Frances' memory issues at the time of his death. She was the informant on the certificate. John's wife Mabel died in Austin on May 25, 1977. They were living at 109 E. 31 Street. John eventually moved to Clarinda, Page, Iowa, to live out his years with friends. He died there on July 5, 1882.\n\nMcNeely Children, 1901-02\n\nBack Row: Elsie McNeely (1885â), Nathaniel \"Ben\" Benjamin McNeely (1889â1971), Frances (Fanny) Ingram McNeely (1876â), William \"Bill\" Ralph McNeely (Jan 1879-1950), Andrew John McNeely (Oct. 1882â1982), Phoebe McNeely (1883â1934)\n\nFront Row: Beatrice \"Bea\" Mary McNeely (August 16, 1889â1981), Reverend Dr. George Peabody McNeely (Feb 1878â1970), Elizabeth \"Bess\" Jane McNeely, (1875â), Robert Campbell McNeely Jr. (1894â1984),\n\nChild at Front: Isabelle \"Belle\" Margaret McNeely (1898-1995)\n\n(Identifications by Andrew John McNeely)\n\nParents: Robert Campbell McNeely, (May 1854 or 1852â1902) and Phoebe Jane Walker McNeely (Aug 1851 or 1853â1901),\n\nChildren by age: Elizabeth \"Bess\" Jane McNeely, (May 1877 or 1875â), Frances (Fanny) Ingram McNeely (Aug 1878 or 1876â), Reverend Dr. George Peabody McNeely (Feb. 1878â1970), William \"Bill\" Ralph McNeely (Jan 1879-1950), Andrew John McNeely (Oct 1882â1982), Phoebe McNeely (May 1883 or 1884â1934), Elsie (Essie McNeely (Nov. 1885â), Beatrice \"Bea\" Mary McNeely (1889â1981), Nathaniel \"Ben\" Benjamin McNeely (Dec 1889â1971), Robert Campbell McNeely (Feb. 1894â1984) and Isabelle \"Belle\" Margaret McNeely (January 1898- Mar 11, 1995)\n\nAssume picture was 1902 year of Senior Robert Campbell McNeely's death\n\nElizabeth J, 26, Fanny 25, George 24, Bill 23, John 20, Phoebe 19, Bessie 17, Bea 13, Ben 13, Robert 8, Isabelle 4\n\n(John McNeely thought the pictures was from ca. 1907, however Isabelle sets the date around 1901-02.)\n\nAcknowledgement: Many of the older family photos and other information used here are from Janeal Hepner's family tree located on Ancestry. com. I greatly appreciated her posting this material.\n\nMcNeely Passage to US 1890\n\nPhoebe McNeely and her children arrived New York on September 2, 1890. The name on the ship's manifest is Mcneilly. Her husband had come 6 weeks earlier. Pat Oakes spent many hours in 1980s trying to find when the McNeely's came. This was before the Internet so many letters were written and much help from inter-library loan to get microfilm of ship's manifest. Ted Gommi, her relative was most helpful. John McNeely recalled the ship's name, the Furnessia, however, he thought they came in 1889.The Furnessia made six voyages in 1890 from Glasgow. After several years searching, Pat found the manifest in 1983, after John had died. The manifest is below with information about the voyage. James Wilson of The Steamship Historical Society of America provided information about the Furnessia: The ship was built in 1889 and owned by the Anchor Line (British). She was built by the Barrow Ship Building Co. Barrow-in-Furness, England. tonnage: 5,495. Dimensions: 445' by 44'. Single screw, 14 knots. Compound engines. Two masts and two funnels. Iron hull. Maiden voyage: Glasgow-New York, January 27, 1881. Converted to single funnel in 1891, r-engined with triple expansion type. Made her final voyage to New York in 1911.

Godrey took over the farm, (Maybe this is the Walker farm in Ireland. Phoebe's mother died quite young in April 1862.\n\nPhoebe recalls being taken outside to see Halley's comet in 1886. Phoebe's older sister, Fanny came first to the US and had a long life. She had 3 children who all died quite young.\n\nJenny (Janey), a cousin planned to come to the US.
