They evolve towards a higher central condensation leading to formation of the central protostar. There is observational evidence that the chemistry does not undergo a complete reset with the formation of the protostar, and hence pre-stellar cores provide the budget of matter that will eventually be inherited by stars and planets.\n\nThe physics and chemistry of pre-stellar core are deeply interconnected. In my talk I will discuss our recent results on using pre-stellar cores as “space laboratory” to study the physics and chemistry in the early stages of star formation. In particular, I will present our observational and modelling efforts to use molecular spectra to dissect the physical and chemical structure of pre-stellar cores.\n\nImage: Molecular emission maps of the pre-stellar core L1544 from IRAM 30m data.

PAHs have been widely attributed as the carriers of the unidentified infrared bands where their aggregate vibrational emission spectra are extremely well matched to the observed line signals. Only in the last year have individual PAHs been detected in the ISM for the first time, however, allowing us to begin to investigate the detailed chemical pathways for the formation and destruction of these molecules. In this talk, I will discuss our detections of PAH molecules via their rotational transitions using Green Bank Telescope observations of TMC-1 from the GOTHAM collaboration. I will discuss the efforts to model the chemistry of these PAHs, the necessity of complementary laboratory kinetics work, our application of novel machine learning approaches to exploring the chemical inventory in TMC-1, and finally the benefits of unbiased reaction screening studies in the laboratory with Microwave Spectral Taxonomy.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 16 May 2022 3:30 p.m. / MPIfR, Bonn / Videostream / Host: Arnaud Belloche\n\nHigh Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy of Molecular Ions of Astrophysical Interest\n\nby José Luis Doménech, CSIC, Madrid, Spain\n\nMolecular ions are at the heart of the formation routes of more complex molecules in the ISM. At the low temperatures and densities prevalent there, only binary reactions with no activation barrier are likely to proceed, and ion-molecule reactions fall generally into this category. Molecular ions are also tracers of the physical conditions of their environment, such as the degree of ionization or the fraction of gas in molecular form.\n\nAlthough most of the identifications of molecules, including ions, in the ISM have been done using observations in the radiofrequency domain, the observations and laboratory experiments in the infrared region provide very valuable information. On the one hand, IR frequency measurements can provide accurate predictions of rotational transitions to be observed in space or in the laboratory, and, furthermore, ground-based observations in the IR are one of the few available means left to study light hydrides in the ISM.\n\nI will describe the experimental approach followed in our laboratory to study the spectrum of molecular ions, i.e. high resolution tunable infrared laser absorption in hollow cathode electrical discharges, together with some contributions of our lab in this field. I will also comment on ongoing work on the implementation of magnetic fields on the experiment and future prospects.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 30 May 2022 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall III / Host: Oskar Asvany\n\nThe Importance of Career Self-management for Academic Career Development\n\nby Aida Alisic, RWTH Aachen, Germany\n\nCareer self-management is a central demand in academic career paths, since individuals are frequently held responsible for managing their careers by themselves and face high levels of insecurity in the early career phase. In this talk, I will present results of three longitudinal studies that were part of a larger nine-wave research project on the career paths of young STEM scientists. This research is approached from perspectives of inter-individual as well as intra-individual differences. Questionnaire data were analyzed by using the random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM; Hamaker et al., 2015) to separate between-person effects from within-person effects. The first study examined reciprocal relationships between work-related self-management, occupational self-efficacy, and career insecurity (N = 3118 PhD students and PhD holders). Results showed increases in self-management and self-efficacy to predict decreases in career insecurity as well as increases in career insecurity to predict decreases in self-management and self-efficacy. The second study investigated the dynamic relationship between flow experience and career goal clarity (N = 3094 PhD students and PhD holders). Results revealed increases in career goal clarity to be associated with subsequent increases in flow experience, and vice versa. The purpose of the third study was to illuminate the process of disengagement from the goal to obtain a PhD (N = 2,011 PhD students). It was assumed that both the lack of self-directed career management as well as social support fuel the experience of an action crisis with regard to the goal to complete a PhD, which, in turn, mitigates the motivation to engage in career management and seek out social support. Results confirmed these predictions. Practical implications will be discussed.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nThis talk is canceled.\n\nMon 13 Jun 2022 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall III / Host: Gender Board\n\nProbing the Microphysics of Radiative Feedback from Massive Stars in the James Webb Space Telescope Era\n\nby Olivier Berne, CNRS/IRAP, Toulouse, France\n\nUltraviolet photons emitted by O/B stars have profound effects on the evolution of interstellar matter in our Galaxy and throughout the Universe, from the era of vigorous star formation at redshifts of 1-3 to the present day. The dominant radiative feedback processes can be probed by observations of the Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) where the far-ultraviolet photons (E=5.17-13.6 eV) create warm regions of gas and dust in the neutral atomic and molecular gas. PDR emission provides a unique tool to study\n\nin detail the physical and chemical processes that are relevant for most of the mass in inter- and circumstellar media including diffuse clouds, protoplanetary disks and molecular cloud surfaces, globules, planetary nebulae, and star-forming regions.\n\nIn this talk, I will present some recent efforts aiming at the improving our understanding of PDRs.\n\nI will describe how recent results from laboratory astrophysics providing molecular parameters for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be used to revisit the role and contribution of these species to the most important heating mechanism in PDRs, i.e. the photoelectric heating. I will then describe the PDRs4All project, which is an Early Release Science (ERS) program involving a large community of scientist from astronomy to laboratory astrophysics, aiming to observe the Orion Bar PDR with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the summer-fall 2022. Important efforts have been developed by the PDRs4All team, in terms of modelling and data processing methods relying on machine learning, to prepare for the analysis of the spectral images that will be obtained with the NIRSpec and MIRI spectrometers. These data in highly processed format as well as some analysis tools will be made available to the community in the months following the observations, and can be used to address key questions regarding PDR physics and chemistry which I will discuss. These efforts will contribute to a better understanding of the interaction of UV radiation with gas and dust, providing tools for the interpretation of JWST spectra which will be dominated by PDR emission throughout the Universe.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 04 Jul 2022 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall III / Host: Volker Ossenkopf-Okada\n\nThe Beginning of JWST Science: How We Got Here and Where We Are Going\n\nby Klaus Pontoppidan, Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, USA\n\nFirst science observations with the James Webb Space Telescope\n\nFollowing the release of the JWST First Images on July 12th, 2022, the observatory will have successfully completed its commissioning activities and begun what we hope is many years of exciting scientific exploration of our infrared Universe. I will summarize how we got to where we are and discuss the basic performance of the observatory as determined during commissioning. I will also showcase the first images and spectra, tell the story of how they were created, and discuss how they are a resource both for public outreach and for first science. Finally, I will look ahead to the first year of planned JWST observations, and what can be expected for in the coming years.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 18 Jul 2022 supplementary colloquium 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Videostream / Host: Lucas Labadie\n\nWinter Term 2021/22\n\nProbing the Stellar Initial Mass Function with CNO Isotopes\n\nby Zhi-Yu Zhang, School of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing University, China\n\nAll measurements of cosmic star formation and stellar mass must assume the stellar initial mass function (IMF) to extrapolate from massive stars to total. Traditional determinations of the IMF in galaxies are made at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths, which cannot be probed in dusty gas-rich galaxies. The C-13/O-18 abundance ratio in the ISM – which are produced mainly by low-and-intermediate-mass stars and massive stars, respectively -- has been demonstrated as a sensitive index of the IMF in gas-rich galaxies. Besides the C-13/O-18 ratio, which is associated with different elements, O-17 and O-18 are likely even more sensitive to the IMF. Here we will present new ALMA observations and archival data of 17O and 18O in nearby galaxies. A systematic trend of 17O/18O ratios from starbursts to dwarf galaxies implies that a variable IMF is inevitable. At the end, we will present recent benchmarking on the CNO isotope gradient of the Milky Way, extending to the low-metallicity outer region.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 04 Oct 2021 1 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall I & Videostream / Host: Thomas Bisbas\n\nConstraining the Cosmic Baryon Cycle with ALMA\n\nby Fabian Walter, MPI für Astronomie, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nNew observations with ALMA have provided a census of the density of molecular gas in the cosmic volume defined by the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field. This molecular gas density shows an order of magnitude decrease as a function of redshift from z~2 to z=0. It follows, to first order, the dependence of the cosmic star formation rate density. This is markably different from the atomic gas phase that shows a rather flat redshift dependence. At low redshift, observations of the interstellar medium of nearby galaxies (in particular the HERACLES survey of molecular gas and the THINGS survey of atomic hydrogen) have demonstrated that the atomic gas is significantly more extended than the molecular gas (the latter being tightly correlated with star formation activity). A similar picture is also emerging in observations of high-redshift galaxies. Assuming a simple galaxy model based on these findings, and using other measurements from the literature, the ALMA Hubble Ultra-Deep Field data are used to put observational constraints on the gas (net) accretion flows in galaxies. These gas flows are needed to explain the build-up of the stellar mass in galaxies, and are further compared to cosmological galaxy formation simulations.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nThu 07 Oct 2021 supplementary colloquium 1 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall III & Videostream / Host: Riechers\n\nFragmentation and Protocluster Formation\n\nby Qizhou Zhang, Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA\n\nMost stars in our Galaxy are born in clusters. How molecular clouds collapse and fragment to give rise to a cluster of stars with a range of stellar masses remains an open question. The physical conditions in clouds harboring protoclusters limit the Jeans mass to about 1 Msun. This creates a puzzle for massive star formation since dense cores much greater than 1 Msun tend to further fragment into lower mass cores. Recent sensitive and high angular resolution observations of cluster forming clouds begin to unravel the complex process of fragmentation. My talk will review the recent progress in fragmentation studies. I will present observations of protocluster forming clumps and discuss the role of turbulence and magnetic fields in the formation of protostellar cores.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 18 Oct 2021 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall I & Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nSimulating Chemistry in Star Forming Environments\n\nby Munan Gong, MPI for extraterrestrial physics, Garching, Germany\n\nChemistry determines many important aspects of the interstellar medium (ISM): for example, the abundance of observable species, heating and cooling of the gas, and the ionization fraction. Understanding chemistry is important for both understanding the physical processes that control star formation, and interpreting observations of molecular clouds in the local universe and beyond. In this talk, I will summarise our efforts in adding chemistry to numerical simulations of the ISM. I will give examples of applying chemistry in different contexts: the environmental dependence of the XCO conversion factor, self-consistent chemistry and thermodynamics, formation of molecules in HI clouds, and more.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 15 Nov 2021 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Lecture Hall I & Videostream / Host: Volker Ossenkopf-Okada\n\nProbing Star Formation in Dusty Galaxies\n\nby Daniela Calzetti, Department of Astronomy, University of Massachusetts, USA\n\nOver the next decade, new and upcoming facilities will secure observations of the restframe UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for millions of galaxies across the entire span of cosmic time. Measurements of star formation rates (SFRs), masses, and other physical parameters from those SEDs will enable comparisons with models of galaxy evolution with unprecedented accuracy. Dust in galaxies provides an important limitation to the reliability of those measurements. (Sub)mm facilities have limited areal coverage and sensitivity and will not be able to observe those millions of galaxies. This implies that IR-based dust corrections will be difficult to extend to large galaxy samples, and dust removal from the SEDs will require the use of attenuation curves. I will review the current state of our understanding of attenuation curves at low and high redshift, highlight both their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss what steps may be able to move the field forward. During this presentation I will also highlight some recent results from the Large Millimeter Telescope and the insights they provide on star formation processes.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 29 Nov 2021 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Videostream / Host: Brandt Gaches\n\nAstrochemistry at the Cryogenic Storage Ring\n\nby Holger Kreckel, MPI für Kernphysik, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nThe Cryogenic Storage Ring (CSR) at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg is the largest electrostatic storage ring project in the world. The CSR combines electrostatic ion optics with extreme vacuum and cryogenic temperatures. The storage ring has a circumference of 35 m, and all deflectors are housed in experimental vacuum chambers that can be cooled down to 5K. It has been shown that within a few minutes of storage inside the CSR infrared-active molecular ions (e.g., CH+, HeH+ and OH-) cool to their lowest rotational quantum states by spontaneous emission of radiation. Equipped with an ion-neutral collision setup and a low-energy electron cooler, the CSR offers unique possibilities for astrochemical experiments under true interstellar conditions. I will present an overview of the capabilities of the CSR, along with first experimental results on collision experiments between cold molecular ions and neutral atoms, free electrons, and photons, yielding quantum state-selective rate coefficients for astrophysically important processes.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 13 Dec 2021 3:30 p.m. / MPIfR, Bonn / Videostream / Host: Helmut Wiesemeyer\n\nTowards High-Precision Magnetometry in the ISM\n\nby Konstantinos Tassis, Department of Physics, University of Crete and Institute of Astrophysics, FORTH, Greece\n\nA large-scale magnetic field permeates our Galaxy and is involved in a variety of astrophysical processes such as star formation and cosmic ray propagation. Dust polarization has been proven one of the most powerful observables for studying the magnetic field properties in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, it does not provide a direct measurement of its strength. Indirect methods have been developed, based on the assumption of equipartition between turbulent kinetic energy and fluctuating magnetic energy. However, these are rather inaccurate. In the era of large polarimetric surveys that will multiply the number of stars with measured polarimetric properties by a factor of 1000, it is important to find ways to mine high-accuracy information about magnetic field strengths from polarimetric data. In this talk, I will discuss how this is possible, by better accounting for the properties of interstellar medium magnetized turbulence.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 10 Jan 2022 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Videostream / Host: Thomas Bisbas\n\nFrom Clouds to Planets: The Astrochemical Link\n\nby Paola Caselli, Center for Astrochemical Studies, MPI for extraterrestrial physics, Garching, Germany\n\nAll ingredients to make stars like our Sun and planets like our Earth are present in dense cold interstellar clouds. In these \"stellar-system precursors\" an active chemistry is already at work, as demonstrated by the presence of a rich variety of organic molecules in the gas phase and icy mantles encapsulating the sub-micrometer dust grains, the building blocks of planets. Here, I’ll present a journey from the earliest phases of star formation to protoplanetary disks, with links to our Solar System, highlighting the crucial role of astrochemistry as powerful diagnostic tool of the various steps present in the journey.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 24 Jan 2022 3:30 p.m. / Koeln / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nSFB parenting experiences\n\nby Rebekka Grellmann & Ronan Higgins, DLR/SFB 956\n\nWed 16 Mar 2022 supplementary colloquium 11 a.m. / Koeln / Videostream / Host: Gender Board\n\nSommer Term 2021\n\nAstronomy and the Climate Crisis\n\nby Leonard Burtscher, Leiden University, The Netherlands\n\nAstronomy is a dirty business, at least in terms of its carbon footprint. Frequent, long-distance flights, the operation of observatories at remote locations, as well as the execution of CPU-intensive simulations lead to per-capita greenhouse gas emission significantly larger than those of the general population. Fortunately, inexpensive solutions, that would significantly reduce our carbon footprint immediately, are available. In this talk, I will break down the typical emissions from astronomical research and argue that we should reduce our own emissions significantly and become role models for demanding realistic change while we continue to collaborate globally. Perhaps more importantly, astronomers can convey awe for the wonders of the universe, a sense of the uniqueness of our planet, and a feeling of global citizenship -- the most important ingredients to provoke a feeling of urgency about the climate crisis, that ideally leads to climate action.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 12 Apr 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Volker Ossenkopf-Okada\n\nThe Complex Chemistry of Young Stars\n\nby Jes Kristian Jørgensen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nThe environments in which young stars form show a rich and varied chemistry. Understanding how, when and where complex organic and potentially prebiotic molecules are formed in these regions is a fundamental goal of astrochemistry. With the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) we are moving into a new territory for these studies with ALMA's high sensitivity for faint lines, high spectral resolution which limits line confusion, and high angular resolution making it possible to study the structure of young protostars on solar-system scales. In this talk I will present some of our recent ALMA results concerning the chemistry taking place in star forming regions. I will discuss the implications of these results on the formation of complex organic molecules around young protostars and the link between the birth environments of these protostars, the conditions in their protoplanetary disks and eventually the chemistry in emerging solar systems.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 19 Apr 2021 / Videostream / Host: Karl Menten\n\nOur Galaxy’s Center: a Window into the High-Redshift Universe\n\nby Cara Battersby, University of Connecticut, USA\n\nGalaxy centers are the hubs of activity that drives galaxy evolution, from supermassive black holes to dense stellar clusters and feedback from newly-formed stars. Our own galaxy’s center has properties (densities, temperatures, and turbulent line widths) that are reminiscent of galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation, but in our own cosmic backyard, where the interplay of these physical processes can be resolved in detail. In this talk, I will discuss gas inflow into our Galaxy’s Center, properties of the gas, and incipient star formation. I will discuss simulations of gas flows into the Galactic Center, which are thought to contribute to the unusual properties of star formation in this region, namely that it is producing 10x fewer stars than predicted by standard scaling relations. I will describe observations of the gas and incipient star formation in this region, as well as discuss efforts to measure whether or not this unusual environment results in a change to the Initial Mass Function.\n\nImage: A three-color view of clouds in our Galaxy’s Center. Red shows new submillimeter observations, peering deep inside these dense clouds and pinpointing incipient star formation in the region (CMZoom: Battersby et al. 2020), Green is Herschel 70 micron (Molinari et al. 2010), and Blue is Spitzer 8 micron (Benjamin et al. 2003).\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 26 Apr 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nImplicit Bias: What it Is, Why it Matters, and What to Do (and not Do) about it\n\nby Jennifer Saul, Waterloo Chair in Social and Political Philosophy of Language, Canada\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the ways that implicit bias may contribute to the under representation of particular groups in academia. There has also been a large quantity of research on what does-- and doesn't-- work to combat implicit bias. One thing this has shown is that some of the most popular diversity-oriented interventions may be ineffectual or even counterproductive. This talk offers an overview of what implicit biases are, the sorts of effects that they may have in academia, and what remedies work and don't work for creating a more equitable environment. In particular, we will see that some of the most effective ways of combatting implicit bias require structural and institutional changes.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 03 May 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: SFB 956 Gender Board\n\nSimulating Star Formation with the Radiation Transport Code TreeRay\n\nby Richard Wünsch, Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic\n\nI will present a novel fast radiation transport algorithm TreeRay, suitable to work together with hydrodynamic codes. It is based on reverse ray tracing combined with tree-based accelerated integration. TreeRay is implemented in the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH, however, the method itself is independent of the host code and can be implemented in any grid based or particle based hydrodynamics code. A key advantage of TreeRay is that its computational cost is independent of the number of sources, making it suitable for simulations with many point sources (e.g. massive star clusters) as well as simulations where diffuse emission is important. A very efficient communication and tree-walk strategy enables TreeRay to achieve almost ideal parallel scalings. TreeRay can easily be extended with modules to treat radiative transfer at different wavelengths and to implement related physical processes. I will focus on the module calculating ionising radiation using the On-the-Spot approximation and describe various tests demonstrating that complicated simulations of star clusters with feedback from multiple massive stars become feasible with TreeRay. Finally, I will show several applications where TreeRay has been used, including project SILCC (SImulating Life Cycle of Clouds) - complex simulations of the interstellar medium in a part of the galactic disk, designed to capture the full matter cycle between gas and stars.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 10 May 2021 3:30 p.m. / MPIfR, Bonn / Videostream / Host: Sac Medina\n\nPrecise Test of Quantum Theory and Determination of Fundamental Constants with HD+ Ions\n\nby Stephan Schiller, Institut für Experimentalphysik, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nFrequency metrology of cold trapped molecules provides exciting opportunities in fundamental physics, including test of ab initio calculations (in particular of QED effects), determining fundamental constants, and search for physics beyond the standard model.\n\nOur object of study is the HD+ molecule - a deceptively simple bound three-body quantum system that allows a high-precision calculation of its rovibrational energies, including relativistic and QED corrections. As of today the latter have been computed up to order α6 relative to the nonrelativistic energy. Since the theoretical calculation requires as input the values of fundamental constants (proton-electron mass ratio mp/me, deuteron-electron mass ratio md/me, proton and deuteron charge radii rp, rd, and Rydberg constant), a comparison of theoretical with experimental transition frequencies provides a means to determine these constants. Also, the level of agreement between theory and experiment can set an upper bound on a hypothetical non-Coulomb proton-deuteron spin-averaged interaction.\n\nExperimentally, we showed that for a string of molecular ions, trapped in a linear ion trap and sympathetically cooled, excitation of transitions with radiation propagating perpendicularly to the trap axis allows spectroscopy in the Lamb-Dicke regime(1), i.e. Doppler-free.\n\nWe have performed spectroscopy of the fundamental rotational(1) (1.3 THz) and the fundamental vibrational(2) (5.1 µm) transitions in the ground electronic level. We measured 6 hyperfine transitions of the fundamental rotational transition and two hyperfine components of the fundamental vibrational transition.\n\nThe comparison with our high-precision ab initio calculations of the energy levels, that used CODATA2018 values of the fundamental constants, yields agreement at the fractional level 3x10-11. Alternatively, applying a suitable analysis technique, the comparison between experiment and theory results permitted determining a value of me (mp-1+md-1) with uncertainty smaller than both CODATA2018, and from direct mass measurements in Penning traps. Finally, our experiment also sets a > 20 times improved upper bound for the strength of a hypothetical \"fifth force\" between proton and deuteron, in the form of a Yukawa potential.\n\n(1) S.

How important is the B-field? What is the role of the B-field in the presence of gravity and turbulence? While a growing number of instruments is now offering dust polarization observations as a tool to observe B-fields, the analysis and interpretation of these data can still be challenging. We present a synergetic multi-scale picture of the magnetic field, based on a series of dust polarization observations in high-mass star-forming regions. These observations image the B-field morphology with progressively higher resolutions from the pc-scale envelope, to globally collapsing cores, to the fragments within cores, and down to a network of core-connection fibers with the currently highest resolution around 500au. These data cover a range in resolution of about a factor 1,000 in area. Together with these scale-dependent B-field morphologies we analyze the gravitational vector field. In particular, our analysis is building on methods that are extracting local information of the B-field, to make optimized use of the detailed B-field structures that carry the imprints of the star-formation processes. As a result, we find recurring similarities in the B-field and in the gravitational vector fields. These self-similar structures point at a multi-scale collapse-within-collapse scenario. At the highest resolution, we find B-field orientations that are prevailingly parallel to the core-connecting extensions and fibers. With this we derive a stability criterion defining a minimum field strength that can stabilize fibers against a radial collapse. We find that the detected fibers are stable, hence possibly making them a fundamental component in the accretion onto central cores.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 21 Jun 2021 11 a.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nOn the Universality of the Star-formation Processes\n\nby Fabien Louvet, CEA-Saclay and ENS-Ulm, Paris, France\n\nStar formation is a key astrophysical process. On small scales, it governs the settling of planetary systems and the complex chemistry allowing the emergence of life. On large scales, star formation controls the energy budget of galaxies. In this presentation, I will review some key similarities and differences between low- and high-mass star formation in line with one of the most important outcomes of star-formation: the initial mass of stars (IMF). We will question both its origin and universality, two hot topics in modern astrophysics.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 05 Jul 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nMonitoring of OH Radicals on Ice Surfaces at Low Temperatures: Diffusion and Proton-hole Transfer\n\nby Naoki Watanabe, Hokkaido University, Japan\n\nThe surface of cosmic ice dust is known as the birth place of various interstellar molecules in a very cold region in space, so-called a molecular cloud. Because the temperatures of ice dust are typically as low as 10 K in molecular clouds, radical reactions having little barriers play dominant roles on the surface. However, because of intrinsic experimental difficulty in detecting radicals, little is known about the behaviors of radicals on the ice surface. On cosmic ice dust, hydroxyl (OH) radical is considered to be one of most abundant adsorbates. The OH radicals can be easily produced by photolysis of water ice and reaction of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Recently, we have developed the method to monitor the OH radical on ice at very low temperatures, which can open a new phase of research on physicochemical processes of radicals. My presentation will consist of two topics: description of the OH detection method and information of OH adsorption sites; clarifying a proton-hole transfer in ice using that method.\n\nThe detection of OH radicals on ice can be achieved by a combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization methods. The kinetic and internal energies of desorbed OH were measured. From the results of experiments and quantum chemical calculations, we will discuss photodesorption mechanisms and adsorption sites of OH radicals on ice. Furthermore, information of surface diffusion of OH radicals on ice will be provided. We also focus on the behavior of OH radicals with coexistent of electrons on the ice surface. we found that once OH adsorbate captures an electron on the surface, the OH- on the surface abstracts a proton from neighbouring H2O which becomes OH-. The sequence of this proton-hole transfer leads to the flow of negative current in ice.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 19 Jul 2021 11 a.m. / Videostream / Host: Stephan Schlemmer\n\nWinter Term 2020/21\n\nThe C+ Universe\n\nby Xander Tielens, Astronomy Department, University of Maryland, College Park and Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, The Netherlands\n\nThe interstellar medium (ISM) and its interaction with massive stars are central to galactic evolution. Interstellar gas is known to exist as atomic (HI) clouds and star forming molecular clouds. Recent observations reveal that half of the interstellar gas is in CO-dark molecular gas that has eluded detailed characterization because of lack of suitable tracer. Hence, its physical conditions and relationship to other gas reservoirs are largely unknown. Atomic and CO-dark molecular gas are heated by far-UV photons from massive stars through photo-electrons from large molecules, producing (inter)cloud phases of the ISM and controlling its emission characteristics. Through winds and explosions, stars also stir up the ISM dynamically. This source of turbulent pressure supports clouds & the gas disk against (self)gravity, disrupts molecular clouds, and compresses gas, triggering new star formation.\n\nHowever, until recently, there was no good tracer for this dynamic interaction. LOFAR has opened up the low frequency sky to efficient surveys, providing a sensitive diagnostic of physical conditions and kinematics of HI and CO-dark molecular gas. Development of sensitive THz heterodyne receiver arrays combined with SOFIA's nimble telescope allow large scale surveys at sub-km/s resolution, probing coupling of radiative and mechanical energy from massive stars to their environment. Centered on these new observing opportunities, I will review our current understanding of the interstellar medium.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 16 Nov 2020 4:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Stefanie Walch-Gassner\n\nGOTHAM: A Meeting of Laboratory Spectroscopy, Observations, and Machine Learning\n\nby Kelvin Lee, Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA\n\nThe recent discovery of benzonitrile towards the cold, dark molecular cloud TMC-1 with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope sparked interest into understanding the role small aromatic molecules play in the chemistry and physics of the interstellar medium. On the spectrum of molecular complexity, these species are intermediate between the small, several atom large molecules that are routinely as tracers, and the peculiar behemoths like the fullerenes and the ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Beyond mere chemical curiosities, understanding how these molecules are formed and destroyed is relevant to how a substantial amount of material—in particular carbon—is transported and transformed in the interstellar medium, as well as gas phase synthetic routes to prebiotic molecules.\n\nIn this talk, I will present the latest results from the GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting Aromatic Molecules) project, a large scale spectral line survey focusing on characterizing the chemical inventory of TMC-1 in the context of small aromatic molecules.I will discuss new molecular detections from this collaboration, which have been facilitated by new workflows in high resolution laboratory spectroscopy and signal analysis. Finally, I will present new machine learning methods I have developed to automate the discovery of new molecules, with the aim of providing guidance to laboratory, observation, and chemical modeling work in GOTHAM and subsequent campaigns.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 30 Nov 2020 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Stephan Schlemmer\n\nThe Inner Workings of a Starburst\n\nby Alberto D. Bolatto, University of Maryland at College Park, USA\n\nStarbursts are a rare phenomenon in the present day universe, but they represent perhaps the most common mode under which stars form and galaxies grow during the z~1-2 peak of cosmic star formation activity. This mode of star formation is not a simple scaling of what happens in typical molecular clouds, but represents a much more efficient manner of converting gas into stars likely through the formation of massive clusters. The resulting feedback in the form of galaxy-scale outflows is, together with AGN, thought to be one of the main forms of regulation of galaxy growth. NGC 253 is the premier local example for a nuclear starburst, and has been targeted with several ALMA observations in order to study how these processes work. I will discuss the properties of the galactic molecular outflow, including our best constraints on the mass and outflow rate, and the\n\nproperties of the molecular gas. I will, however, focus on the results from high-resolution observations which reveal a dozen compact structures with properties corresponding to massive young star\n\nclusters and super star clusters (SSCs), most of which are so embedded that are invisible in optical and NIR observations (the exception is a known SSC). Finally, I will present the analysis of our 0.5-pc resolution observations which reveal feedback and disruption on the scales of these clusters, I will discuss the properties of these \"cluster-scale\" outflows, and I will compare them to theoretical expectations.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 14 Dec 2020 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Frank Bigiel\n\nPeering into the Dark: Probing the Formation and Early Evolution of Massive Stars\n\nby Gary A. Fuller, Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, The University of Manchester, UK\n\nThis presentation will focus on recent work aimed at understanding the formation and early evolution of massive protostars. The massive (M>8 Msol) stars into which these evolve are the primary drivers of galactic ecosystems. The energy and nuclear processed material these massive stars inject into their enviroment during their lives and ultimately as supernovae, shapes the physical and chemical evolution of the ISM in galaxies. These stars are the precursors of a range of important astrophysical phenomena inlcuding pulsars, blackholes and gamma-ray bursts. Understanding the formation and early evolution of massive protostars is therefore essential for building comprehensive models of star formation and galactic evolution. Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are dense regions which are not (yet) dominated by the feedback from star formation and so are important regions for studying the initial conditions for the formation of massive stars, and their associated clusters of lower mass stars.\n\nIn this presentation I will discuss recent results from a number of studies of infrared dark clouds which shed light on the formation of these regions and the protostars which are forming within them. Using data from ALMA and other telescopes I will describe the evidence for infall over pc-scale sized regions around the most massive IRDCs and explore the extent to which observations can constrain the properties of the infall. I will then move on to discuss the initial results from TEMPO, an ALMA survey to investigate the chemical properties of a sample of massive protostars as a probe of their evolutionary stage.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 11 Jan 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nThe Chemistry of Planet Formation\n\nby Catherine Walsh, Astrophysics Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, UK\n\nProtoplanetary disks around young stars are the\n\nfactories of planetary systems. These structures contain all the\n\nmaterial - dust, gas, and ice - that will build planets and other bodies\n\nsuch as comets. Hence, understanding the physics and chemistry of disks\n\nprovides much needed insight into the conditions under which planets\n\nform, and determining their molecular content reveals the raw\n\ningredients of planetary atmospheres.\n\nIn this colloquium I will present early results from the first ALMA\n\nLarge Program dedicated to the observation of molecular line emission\n\nfrom protoplanetary disks around nearby young stars at high angular\n\nresolution (0.1\" - 0.3\"), titled \"Molecules with ALMA on Planet-Forming\n\nScales\" or MAPS. I will present images that reveal intriguing\n\nsub-structure in emergent line emission from key organic molecules such\n\nas CO, C2H, HCN, and CH3CN. I will discuss the link between known dust\n\nsubstructure and the observed line emission, and will present results\n\nfrom quantitative analyses of source properties such as radial mass\n\ndistribution, chemical structure, ionisation structure, and elemental\n\ncomposition of the gas. I will also discuss how observations in the\n\ngas-phase of large organic molecules provide insight into the\n\ncomposition of the icy-comet building reservoir around other stars.\n\nFinally I will discuss how early results from MAPS have provided the\n\nmost detailed studies to date of the chemistry of planet formation.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 18 Jan 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Arnaud Belloche\n\nCloud Formation and Feedback Processes: Results from the THOR Survey\n\nby Henrik Beuther, Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nThe large program THOR conducted with the Very Large Array (VLA) is a Milky Way survey that investigates our Galaxy in the atomic gas 21cm line, in molecular gas OH emission, and in the ionised gas in the continuum and radio recombination line emission. With this diverse setup, scientific questions can be addressed from the formation of clouds and atomic to molecular gas conversion at early evolutionary stages, to feedback processes of HII regions and Supernova remnants at late evolutionary stages of star formation.

One of the big open questions concerns how planetary systems and multiple-star systems form and what causes the diversity in their orbital characteristics. For instance, the orbits of many Hot Jupiters are tilted with respect to the stellar spin axis, indicating that these planets formed in the outer disk and were then transported onto oblique orbits through dynamical interactions.\n\nIn this talk, I will outline how infrared interferometry allows us to explore the origin of the diversity that we see in star and planetary systems. I will discuss results from our MIRCX six-telescope imager at CHARA, where we achieve the resolution of a 330m telescope and search for potentially planet-induced structures in the innermost astronomical unit of protoplanetary disks. In another study, we find evidence for the disk tearing effect, where the gravitational torque of companions on misaligned orbits tears the disk apart and moves disk material out of the disk plane, enabling planet formation on highly oblique orbits.\n\nIn the second part, I will present the ERC-funded GAIA-BIFROST project that will measure orbital parameters, precision masses, and spin-orbit alignments for thousands of binary and planetary systems. We will build a new beam-combination instrument for ESO’s VLT Interferometer, named BIFROST, that will open the short-wavelength and high spectral-resolution window at VLTI. This will allow us to measure spin-orbit alignments for wide-separation planets, providing fundamentally new insights on the dynamical processes that shape system architectures.\n\nFinally, I will outline the prospects of using BIFROST with the VLTI unit telescopes for the characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres. Combining star-light suppression from interferometry and adaptive optics, BIFROST will be able to probe closer-in planets than GRAVITY/GRAVITY+ and provide access to complementary molecular line tracers, probing deeper layers of the atmosphere.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 01 Feb 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nA New Guided Ion Beam Instrument – NOVion: Recent Results\n\nby Igor Savic, University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Physics, Serbia\n\nLaboratory experiments concerning the formation and destruction of molecular ions are of great importance for modeling astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. The H3+ ion is the dominant ion in any kind of hydrogen plasma, triggering the formation of other molecular ions (in interstellar space as well as in laboratory plasmas). Formation and destruction of HeH+ ions (they were recently discovered in the planetary NGC 7027) are also significant for helium-hydrogen chemistry in different environments.\n\nIn this lecture, details about the newest Guided Ion Beam instrument will be presented, in addition to the technique in general. This instrument is used for investigating low energy collisions of interest for astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Additionally, recent results on the formation of H3+ by collision of H2+ and H2 will be given. First results on the formation of HeH+ via collision of H2+ and H3+ with He will be presented. Furthermore, the results on the destruction of HeH+ in collision with H2 will be shown.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 08 Feb 2021 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Oskar Asvany\n\nSommer Term 2020\n\nCCAT-prime: Status and Perspectives\n\nby Jürgen Stutzki, I.

I will outline how the ISM properties of galaxies evolve in different environments throughout 13 billion years of cosmic history based on some of the most detailed recent observations obtained with the most powerful facilities operating at radio to submillimeter wavelength such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large sub/Millimeter Array (ALMA). I will describe new results from the VLA COLDz and ALMA ASPECS molecular line scan surveys, and from targeted multi-wavelength studies of main sequence galaxies and massive dusty starbursts out to the highest redshifts. I will show how these results provide a consistent view of the full baryon cycle from gas to stars, where they hint at additional complexities, and where they challenge our current understanding built on simulations. I will conclude by discussing how planned and upcoming facilities like the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and CCAT-prime will provide new avenues towards overcoming some key challenges in our current understanding.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 27 Apr 2020 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Stefanie Walch-Gassner\n\nCharacterizing the Dense Molecular Gas in Galaxies\n\nby Serena Viti, Physics and Astronomy Department, University College London, UK\n\nIt is now well established that chemistry in our Milky Way as well as in external galaxies is rich and complex. In this talk I will show how molecules play a key role in determining the characteristics of our own Galaxy, as well as nearby galaxies. By using examples from different regions of space, from interstellar and star forming gas, to extragalactic shocked regions, I will demonstrate how molecules can be ideal probes of the nature of the dense gas and hence help us to describe the different phases of the neutral gas in galaxies. Finally I will present a new approach for theinterpretation of molecules using Bayesian and Machine Learning techniques.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 11 May 2020 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nThe Origin of Interstellar Turbulence\n\nby Mark Krumholz, Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia\n\nIn this talk, I review attempts to build a self-consistent model for the origin of turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galactic discs. Ideally such a model would incorporate all potential sources of turbulence: stellar feedback, gravitational and other instabilities, and driving by stellar gravity, and would be able to explain observed correlations between ISM turbulence and other properties of galaxies, such as their star formation rates. I summarise the various ways that theorists have attempted to fit together physical ingredients to reach this goal, the differing physical pictures behind these models, and the strengths and weaknesses of each when it comes to reproducing the observations. I then show that it is possible to combine the best elements of these models into a single, unified picture that explains the relative roles of the various sources of turbulence, and successfully reproduces most of the major observations. I suggest future observations that can be used to test this unified model.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 18 May 2020 1 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Frank Bigiel\n\nThick as Thieves - Feeding and Feedback in the Most Obscured Galaxy Nuclei\n\nby Susanne Aalto, Department of Space, Earth and Environment (SEE), Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nCold gas plays a central role in feeding and regulating star formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy nuclei. Particularly powerful activity occurs when interactions of gas-rich galaxies funnel large amounts of gas and dust into nuclei of luminous and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs/ULIRGs). These dusty objects are of key importance to galaxy mass assembly over cosmic time. Dust embedded galaxy evolution also occurs in less extreme galaxies – including nearby starbursts or enshrouded AGNs. Studying them is fundamental to our understanding of how galaxies evolve in the Universe.\n\nSome (U)LIRGS have deeply embedded galaxy nuclei that harbour a particularly active evolutionary stage of AGNs and/or starbursts: the Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs). The nuclear activity drives mechanical feedback in the form of molecular winds, jets and outflows. This feedback can remove baryons from low-mass galaxies, prevent overgrowth of galaxies, explain “red-and dead” properties of local ellipticals, and be linked to the M-sigma relation. With mm/submm to FIR and IR telescopes, we can study the morphology, velocity structure, physical conditions and even chemistry of the obscured nuclei and their cold flows at unprecedented sensitivity and resolution.\n\nI will focus on recent ALMA and NOEMA studies of enshrouded nuclei, AGN and feedback. ALMA studies (resolution 0.”02 (1 – 7 pc)), reveal launch regions of molecular outflows, inflows, and dusty nuclei of the nearby LIRGs NGC1068, NGC1377 and IC860. The outflows are different from each other where NGC1068 shows gas carried out by a radio jet, NGC1377 has a 150 pc scale radio-quiet molecular jet, and the IC860 flow is exceedingly compact and dense. I will also discuss how vibrationally excited molecular emission (e.g. HCN) can reach behind the curtain of dust to undertake new studies of heretofore hidden, rapid evolutionary phases of galaxy nuclei. Do CONs represent a new, unknown evolutionary phase of galactic growth?\n\nMon 25 May 2020 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nGender Bias in STEM\n\nby Lina Vollmer, Freelance Trainer in the Field of Diversity and Anti-Discrimination and Consultant in the Department of Gender & Diversity Management at the UoC\n\nDespite decades of gender equality policy, the proportion of women declines with each higher level of scientific qualification and is particularly low in the STEM area. My talk \"Gender Bias in STEM\" serves as an introduction in the topic of gender-specific exclusion mechanisms in science and gender bias.\n\nGender bias is a form of unconscious bias. This term describes distortion effects of our perception which we are not aware of. These distortions arise in connection with stereotypes and are directly related to social discrimination processes. They affect our judgements, our decision-making and eventually our actions. They can influence personnel selection decisions, performance appraisals and can cause biased judgements, even if we think we are acting fairly. I will present different gender bias effects in science and mechanisms of gender specific exclusion at universities. We will also discuss to which extent such mechanisms are particularly strong in the STEM sector and which approaches of intervention are appropriate from the university's point of view.\n\nPicture: copyright Kira auf der Heide, unsplash.com\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 29 Jun 2020 3:30 p.m. / Videostream / Host: SFB 956 Gender Board\n\nWinter Term 2019/20\n\nExplaining the Luminosity Spread in Young Clusters\n\nby Troels Haugbølle, Center for Star and Planet Formation, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nAn important shortcoming of the classical model of low-mass star formation is the so-called luminosity problem, whereby embedded protostars are observed to be under-luminous compared to what is expected from a steady mass accretion. An effect of this is observed in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of star forming regions that show a large luminosity spread, which is incompatible with well-defined isochrones based on classic non-accreting protostellar evolution models. A possible solution is that accretion is not steady, but varies with time. It is debated if the time evolution of accretion rates in deeply embedded protostars is best characterised by a smooth decline from early to late stages, or by intermittent bursts of high accretion. Furthermore, while an age can be defined for a star forming region, the ages of individual stars in the region will vary. I will discuss how we can trace the accretion history of young stars, how non-steady accretion impacts the evolution of the protostellar structure, and how the observed luminosity spread can be explained through the combined effect of a protostellar age spread, a consequence of sustained star formation in star forming regions, and time-varying protostellar accretion for individual protostars.\n\nImage: Star formation is a chaotic and dynamic process of interacting gas and stars. The gravitational collapse makes it inherently multi-scale, and variability is seen on a large range of space and time-scales. This is illustrated here column by density images obtained from global models of a star forming region with a dynamic range of up to 500 million allowing us to capture dynamics on the star cluster, core, and circumstellar disk scales.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 07 Oct 2019 / Koeln\n\nQuasiparticle Approach to Molecules Rotating in Quantum Solvents\n\nby Mikhail Lemeshko, Institute of Science and Technology (IST), Austria\n\nRecently we have predicted a new quasiparticle - the angulon - which is formed when a quantum impurity (e.g. a molecule, atom, or electron) exchanges its angular momentum with a many-particle environment (such as lattice phonons or collective excitations in a liquid) [1,2]. Soon thereafter we obtained strong evidence that angulons are formed in experiments on molecules trapped inside superfluid helium nanodroplets [3].\n\nIn my talk, I aim to introduce the concept of angulon quasiparticles and to demonstrate how complex problems of far-from-equilibrium many-body dynamics can be simplified using this concept. In addition, I will describe novel physical phenomena that arise in molecules interacting with superfluid helium [1,5,6], as well as possible connections between matrix isolation spectroscopy and non-equilibrium magnetism.\n\n[1] R.

Stellar feedback affects all astrophysical scales: it shapes the interstellar medium and mass function of galaxies, determines the fragmentation and star formation efficiency of molecular clouds, and plays a central role in the geochemical evolution of terrestrial planets. High-mass stars shape the local star-forming environment - the ecology - via radiation pressure, stellar winds, photoionization, and supernovae. Photoionization is the least explored of these; however, recent numerical work suggests that it dominates the destruction of molecular clouds and planet-forming disks around stars born in clusters. These predictions depend critically on the dynamics of newborn stars and feedback-altered gas, but these quantities are poorly unconstrained. I will talk about on-going surveys using ALMA, MUSE/VLT, and M2FS/Magellan to measure gas and stellar kinematics in order to test the role of environment in shaping the outcome of star and planet formation.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 18 Nov 2019 / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nPHANGS: Star Formation, Feedback and Chemical Enrichment in Nearby Galaxies\n\nby Annie Hughes, Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planetologie (IRAP), France\n\nThe Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS) project is pursuing thee major observing programmes with ALMA, VLT/MUSE and the HST in order to study the interplay of the small-scale physics of gas and star formation with galactic structure and galaxy evolution across a representative sample of star-forming main sequence galaxies in the local Universe (d\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 02 Dec 2019 / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nPlanetary Mass Spectrometry 389Team - Compact QIT-Mass Spectrometers for Lunar and Planetary Applications\n\nby Frank Maiwald, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, USA\n\nThe Mass Spectrometer 389Team consists of experts in modeling, developing, and deploying technologies.

With new VLT/MUSE optical integral field spectroscopy, the PHANGS team now has a wealth of emission line maps that trace different ionization sources and physical conditions across nearby disk galaxies at the 50pc spatial scales needed to isolate individual ionized regions (e.g. HII regions, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae) from surrounding diffuse ionized gas. I will present our most recent results connecting the molecular gas with observed sites of massive star formation, and measuring the gas phase oxygen abundances across thousands of HII regions.

The primary tracers of star formation and the ISM are observable at FIR through (sub)millimeter wavelengths, yet most analysis of early Universe galaxy evolution has been done using optical/near-infrared studies. However, in the rest-frame UV and at visible wavelengths, most of the star formation is strongly obscured by foreground dust, so few constraints exist on the universal star formation activity, in particular in redshift z>3 galaxies. To bridge this gap in our understanding, large (sub) millimeter surveys will be necessary.\n\nI will illustrate the anticipated scientific capabilities of such surveys by presenting scientific results we have already obtained from observations with the GISMO 2 mm continuum camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope in Spain. These observations include one ultra-deep and one medium deep millimeter survey in the HDF and in the COSMOS field, respectively. As an example of nearby hidden star formation I will present a recent analysis of GISMO observations of the Galactic Center region.

I will report how these techniques are providing crucial insight into how magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is structuring the interstellar medium (ISM).\n\nFinally, I will show how the extensions of these machine vision techniques can be used to look for the imprints of the molecular cloud formation and destruction in the extended HI and 13CO observations from the THOR and GRS surveys of the Galactic plane.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 / Koeln\n\nFirst astrophysical observations of the helium hydride ion (HeH+) in a planetary nebula\n\nby David Neufeld, Johns-Hopkins-University\n\nMore than four decades after the helium hydride ion was first recognized as potentially-detectable interstellar molecule, its first astrophysical detection was obtained recently (Güsten et al. 2019, Nature) with the use of the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies (GREAT) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to observe the fundamental rotational transition at 2010.184 THz (149.137 µm) toward the planetary nebula NGC 7027. In this talk, I will discuss the discovery of astrophysical HeH+, its astrophysical significance, its astrochemistry in planetary nebulae, and recent ground-based observations that have led to the detection of HeH+ vibrational emissions from NGC 7027.\n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 supplementary colloquium 2:30 p.m. / Koeln\n\nTowards a Unified Model for Star-formation\n\nby Alvaro Hacar, Leiden University, The Netherlands\n\nUsing single-dish and ALMA molecular observations, we have investigated the internal structure of several paradigmatic nearby proto-clusters across their entire mass spectrum. In all cases, the analysis of different molecular line tracers indicates a high level of internal organization in which apparently monolithic clumps are actually complex networks of small-scale fibers. In both low- and high-mass clusters, fibers are characterized by presenting transonic internal motions respect to their local sound speed and a mass per-unit-length close to hydrostatic equilibrium. Conversely, the fiber dimensions (width and length) appear to be self-regulated depending on their intrinsic gas density of their local environment. Combining observations in different star-forming regions, we identify a systematic increase of the surface density of fibers as a function of the mass of these systems. Based on this empirical correlation, we propose a unified star-formation scenario where the observed differences between low- and high-mass clouds, and the origin of clusters, emerge naturally from the initial concentration of fibers.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 27 Jan 2020 / Koeln / Host: Alvaro Sanchez-Monge\n\nSommer Term 2019\n\nExploring the H3+ and H4+ Potential Energy Landscape by Photodissociation and Reactive Scattering\n\nby Xavier Urbain, Institute of Condensed Matter and Nanosciences, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium\n\nThe H3+ and H4+ species both exhibit a rich potential energy surface topology, which affects their collisional and laser induced dynamics. We have investigated the charge transfer and atom interchange in a series of fast-beam experiments.\n\nPhotodissociation experiments were conducted to investigate the role of the avoided crossing seam between the ground and first excited potential energy surface of H3+[1]. Three-dimensional imaging of dissociation products was used to determine the kinetic energy release and branching ratio among the fragmentation channels. Vibrational distributions were measured by dissociative charge transfer of H2+ products. It is found that the photodissociation of hot H3+ in the near ultraviolet produces coldH2+, but hot H2. Modelling the wavepacket dynamics along the repulsive potential energy surface accounts for the repopulation of the ground potential energy surface. The important role of the H3+ avoided crossing seam for the astrophysically relevant H2+ + H2 charge transfer reactions [2] will be underlined.\n\nThe partially deuterated isotopologues of H3+, i.e. H2D+ and D2H+, have pure rotational spectra that can be excited at prestellar core temperatures, allowing for the total H3+ abundance to be inferred, provided the deuterating reactions of H3+ are well understood. Here, we present laboratory measurements of the rate coefficients for the reactions of atomic D with H3+, H2D+, and D2H+. The measurements were performed using a dual-source, merged fast beams apparatus [3]. In addition, high-level quantum ab initio calculations have been carried out to model the zero-point-energy corrected energy profile and the shape of the potential energy barrier, allowing an evaluation of tunneling effects. From the combination of our experimental and theoretical results, we derive thermal rate coefficients in the temperature range relevant for prestellar cores [4].\n\n[1] X. Urbain, A. Dochain, R.

Many details of the star formation process can only be investigated in the Milky Way. Such research thus provides us with important information about the evolution of the gas and the stars in galaxies over cosmic time.\n\nI will discuss two studies of star formation in the Milky Way that seek to advance our understanding of cosmic star formation. First, I will talk about research into Galactic Center molecular clouds with ALMA and other interferometers. This informs us about star formation under extreme conditions, resembling those found in starburst galaxies. Second, I will present results from the LEGO Large Program on the IRAM 30m–telescope, which obtains the most comprehensive wide–field spectroscopic views of molecular clouds available to date. Such work shows us how we can characterize spatially unresolved gas in other galaxies, and it reveals the astrochemistry of star and planet formation at an unprecedented level of detail.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 29 Apr 2019 / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nExtended Townes-Dailey Analysis and Four-Fold Internal Rotation\n\nby Stewart Novick, Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT, USA\n\nThis talk (might) cover three topics, depending on time. Topic1, The use of the Extended Townes Dailey (ETD) analysis to understand the two hyperfine tensors of 2-bromopyridine. The ETD analysis is a generalization on the original Townes-Dailey analysis, which involved determining the only one component of the nuclear quadrupole coupling tensor, With ETD, all component of the tensor are predicted, including when the orbitals of atom in question is hybridized. With this as a background, the ETD analysis will be used to try to understand how the p orbitals on nitrogen could generate an eQq of CN+ of +5.0 MHz. Topic 2, The first high resolution study of the torsional splittings of a four-fold internal rotor, vinylsulfur pentafluoride. Topic 3, will be on spin statistics made (overly) simple. This part of the talk is pedagogical, and should be useful for researchers and students.\n\nChart caption: Correlation diagram for the four-fold internal rotor\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 13 May 2019 / Koeln\n\nLinking the Initial Conditions of Star Formation to Galactic Environment\n\nby Sarah Ragan, Cardiff University, UK\n\nSurveys of the Milky Way plane in a variety of gas or dust tracers have helped us develop an understanding of how the physical conditions of the interstellar medium vary throughout the Galaxy. We are now able to investigate what role Galactic environmental factors might play in giving rise to the conditions conducive to star formation. I will discuss a recent study conducted using the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL), which has catalogued over 100000 compact objects, or \"clumps\", throughout the plane and characterised their properties by modelling their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We find that although the spiral arms of our Galaxy are where clumps are primarily (though not exclusively) concentrated, the clumps found in arms are not significantly more likely to be star-forming than interarm clumps. We also find a notable gradient in the prevalence of star formation in clumps with Galactocentric radius. I will also discuss our studies of \"giant\" 100-parsec scale molecular filaments in the Galaxy which enable us to link the clump scales up to Galactic scales. A comprehensive profile of the Milky Way from parsec to kiloparsec scales provides us with the appropriate context in which we can understand star formation in other galaxies.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 27 May 2019 / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nRadiative Feedback and PDRs in Orion\n\nby Javier R.

To overcome these limitations, we have carried out the CO Luminosity Density at High Redshift (COLDz) survey, a large volume line scan search for cold molecular gas in galaxies at redshifts 2-3 and 5-7 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The resulting measurement of the \"cold gas history of the universe\" near the peak epoch of cosmic star formation and in the first billion years of cosmic time provides important information on the fueling mechanisms that drive cosmic star formation. Surveys like COLDz set the necessary broader context for targeted in-depth studies of the physical properties of star formation in different galaxy populations back to the earliest epochs with the Atacama Large sub/Millimeter Array (ALMA). Such studies fundamentally enhance our picture of early galaxy evolution by providing a better understanding of the stellar mass buildup, and they are a critical pathfinder toward galaxy and large-scale structure surveys in the early universe with the most powerful upcoming facilities, in particular the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and CCAT-prime.\n\nFri 05 Jul 2019 supplementary colloquium 2 p.m. / Koeln / Host: Stefanie Walch-Gassner\n\nFrom Cosmic Web to Molecular Clouds: the Multiple Scales of Star Formation\n\nby Amelie Saintonge, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London, UK\n\nObservations of molecular gas and dust in distant galaxies are experiencing a coming-of-age, transitioning from a \"discovery\" to a \"survey\" mode. New and upgraded facilities are now making it possible to survey the cold interstellar medium efficiently for large galaxy samples, and these observations are proving to be critical in refining our general picture of galaxy evolution. In this talk, I will review results from a number of new large surveys for molecular gas and dust across the galaxy population at low and high redshifts, and show how they combine to lend strong support in favour of the \"equilibrium\" model for galaxy evolution, under which most of galaxy evolution is regulated by gas inflows and outflows, and by the efficiency of the star formation process. These results highlight the multi-scale nature of the galaxy evolution problem, from gas flows along the cosmic web to the small-scale physics of star formation, and the need to investigate new tools to study the cold interstellar medium of distant galaxies.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 08 Jul 2019 / Koeln / Host: Stefanie Walch-Gassner\n\nWinter Term 2018/19\n\nISM Dynamics and Star Formation\n\nby Ralf Klessen, ITA, Universität Heidelberg, Germany\n\nStars and star clusters form by gravitational collapse in regions of high density in the multi-phase interstellar medium. The process of stellar birth is controlled by the complex interplay between the self-gravity of the star-forming gas and various opposing agents, such as supersonic turbulence, magnetic fields, cosmic ray and gas pressure, or stellar feedback in form of radiation, winds, and supernovae. Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at the same time it can promote local collapse. This process is modified by the thermodynamic response of the gas, which is determined by the balance between various heating and cooling processes, which in turn depend on the chemical composition of the material. I will review the current status of the field and discuss a few examples of recent progress.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 08 Oct 2018 / Koeln / Host: Stefanie Walch-Gassner\n\nMultifractal Analysis of Herschel/Hi-GAL Observations: First Results\n\nby Davide Elia, Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, INAF, Roma, Italy\n\nThe images of the interstellar clouds, obtained observing molecular lines or dust continuum emission, exhibit a certain degree of self-similarity, generally ascribed to internal turbulence. The fractal geometry is therefore invoked to provide a quantitative description of the cloud morphology. As a further development, the multifractal approach is based on a continuous spectrum of exponents rather than on a single descriptor (the fractal dimension). It is more suitable to describe sets of intertwined fractals, showing a deviation from a strict self-similarity, which is typical of natural (stochastic) fractals, including clouds. However, the multifractal geometry remained an underexploited approach to describe and quantify the large-scale structure of interstellar clouds. I'll describe how multifractal analysis was applied to Herschel far-infrared (70-500 ?m) dust continuum maps, representing an ideal case of study. In particular, I computed the so-called multifractal spectrum and generalized fractal dimension of six Hi-GAL regions in the third Galactic quadrant, measuring systematic variations of the spectrum at increasing wavelength, which generally correspond to an increasing complexity of the image. Furthermore, I found a peculiar behaviour for each investigated field, strictly related to the presence of high-emission regions, which in turn are connected to star formation activity. The same analysis was also applied to synthetic column density maps, generated from numerical turbulent molecular cloud models and from fractal Brownian motion, allowing for the confrontation of the observations with models with well controlled physical parameters. I will discuss the results for both these classes of images. Finally, the link between mono-fractal parameters and multifractal indicators was investigated: I will describe common trends, but also differences highlighting the fact that multifractal analysis can offer a more extended and complete characterization of the cloud structure.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 22 Oct 2018 / Koeln / Host: Nicola Schneider\n\nModels of Isotope and Spin-state Chemistry in Star-forming Clouds\n\nby Olli Sipilä, Max-Planck-Institut für Extraterrestrische Physik, Garching, Germany\n\nThe high density and low temperature in the central areas of star-forming cloud cores leads to the efficient depletion of various molecules onto the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. This severely limits the number of available tracer molecules that we can use to obtain information on, e.g., the gas temperature in these conditions. Fortunately, the onset of depletion allows deuterium chemistry to proceed, and indeed the abundances of deuterated molecules tend to peak toward high-density regions where depletion is strong. This provides us with unique observational tools to study the physical properties of star-forming cores, and hence it is highly desirable to develop detailed models of deuterium chemistry in order to understand the observations. Deuterium chemistry is strongly affected by spin-state chemistry, and in fact spin states can play a role in the formation of heavier species, such as ammonia, as well.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss in detail the connection of isotope (in particular deuterium) and spin-state chemistry, and will describe how studies of these topics allow us to understand the initial stages of the star-formation process better. I will introduce several past and present modeling efforts in this context, and will also outline future prospects that will further enhance our understanding of interstellar chemistry.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 05 Nov 2018 / Koeln / Host: Daniel Seifried\n\nSimulating Cosmic Ray-Driven Processes in Astrochemical Models: How and Why\n\nby Christopher Shingledecker, Max-Planck-Institut für Extraterrestrische Physik, Garching, Germany\n\nMaterial in the ISM is subjected to bombardment by several types of ionizing radiation including cosmic rays, stellar winds, x-rays, and gamma-rays from radionuclide decay. It is known that such radiation can have a significant physicochemical impact on interstellar environments, and a large body of experimental work has shown that the interaction between such energetic particles and low-temperatures ices can result in the formation of complex - even prebiotic - molecules. Even so, modeling the chemical effects of cosmic ray collisions with interstellar dust grain ice mantles has proven challenging due to the complexity and variety of the underlying physical processes. In this talk, we review recent work by us on the methods of incorporating such processes into astrochemical models, as well as their effects on cold core simulations.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 19 Nov 2018 / Koeln / Host: Stephan Schlemmer\n\nReactions of Molecules on Ice Nanoparticles: Synthesis of Complex Molecules from Simple Precursors in the Space\n\nby Michal Fárník, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague\n\nExtremely low densities leading to rare collisions between molecules and low temperatures in the majority of the interstellar space make it a very unfriendly environment for any kind of chemistry. Thus, the more complex molecules in the space have to be formed either in barrier-less ion-molecule reactions or reactions on ice/dust particles, which can adsorb reactant molecules on surfaces for long times.\n\nIn our laboratory, we can investigate the reactions on ice nanoparticles in a complex molecular-beam apparatus. Beams of different ice nanoparticles are produced in supersonic expansions. The nanoparticles fly isolated in vacuum and cool down by evaporation to typical temperatures of 10-100 K. Thus they represent good proxy for astronomical ices. As they pass through several pick-up cells, the nanoices can pick-up various gas-phase molecule on their surfaces. Then reactions can be triggered by photons (UV or IR) or electrons (fast, ~100 eV, causing ionization or slow, 0-10 eV, leading to the electron attachment), and we observe the reactions by mass spectrometry, velocity map imaging and other techniques.\n\nSeveral examples of such investigations will be presented: pickup and coagulation of simple molecules on pure water-ice nanoparticles, generation of biologically relevant hydrogen bonds between molecules adsorbed on ices, ionization of doped ammonia ices, reactions of methanol and formic acid on ices, etc.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 03 Dec 2018 / Koeln / Host: Oskar Asvany\n\nFollowing the Interstellar Gas and Ice through the Formation of Stellar Nurseries\n\nby Valentine Wakelam, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux, Univ. Bordeaux/CNRS, France\n\nCarbon and heavier atoms are born in the centre of stars. At the end of their life, stars spread their inner material into the diffuse InterStellar Medium (ISM), yielding at the same time the formation of interstellar dust refractory cores. This diffuse medium (where photo-dissociation dominates the chemistry) gets locally denser in the form of dark clouds whose innermost part is shielded from the external UV field by the dust, allowing for molecules to grow and get more complex. As dust grains start to be covered by molecules, they also undergo coagulation. Gravitational collapse occurs inside these dense clouds forming protostars and their surrounding disks, and eventually planetary systems like (or unlike) our own solar system. Throughout all these stages, chemistry keeps evolving far from the equilibrium/steady-state set by physical conditions.\n\nIn recent years, our knowledge on the composition of the ISM and the process of star formation has entered a new area with the powerful capabilities (in term of sensitivity, spatial resolutions and/or new wavelength windows) of recent ground based and space observatories (Spitzer, Herschel, ALMA, NOEMA, and the new EMIR receiver on the IRAM 30m). These new instruments have allowed for the detection of new molecules (in the gas-phase or in the ices), either simple ones such as HCl+ or complex ones such as CH3NCO. In addition to revealing the richness of the ISM chemistry, they have revealed the non-uniform distribution of their abundances from object to object or even within a certain type of object (with similar physical conditions). One of the key questions astrochemists want to answer is: how do these molecules in the gas-phase or in the ices form and can we reproduce their variability in abundance?\n\nIn this presentation, I will describe the tools and methodology used to study the chemical composition of the interstellar medium and what we think we currently know about it.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 17 Dec 2018 / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nCharacterising the Physical Properties of the ISM from Molecular Emission\n\nby Pierre Gratier, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux, Univ. Bordeaux/CNRS, France\n\nNew receivers and spectrometers installed at millimeter and submillimeter telescopes now have very large bandwidths spanning tens of gigahertz at very high resolutions (~50-200kHz) yielding spectra comprising of hundred of thousands channels. These observing modes are now standard, which means that spectral surveys are now the observations obtained by default. With these instruments, large, several square degree, maps of the ISM are starting to be observed yielding massive hyperspectral datasets combining the emission of tens of species. The observed line intensities are function of both the ISM chemical composition and physical condition; using these molecular datasets it is possible to extract these ISM properties. In the framework of the ORIONB IRAM 30m large program we have developed statistical methods to study the physical conditions of the ISM solely from the observed molecular emission. I will present in particular:\n\ni) the application of a Principal Component Analysis to decompose the maps into regions of low/high density and low/high UV illumination (Gratier et al. 2017),\n\nii) the application of the MeanShift clustering algorithm to segment the molecular cloud into physically and chemically similar regions (Bron et al. 2018) and,\n\niii) preliminary results on the application of supervised machine learning to infer the total column density from molecular emission.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nThis talk is canceled.\n\nMon 14 Jan 2019 / MPIfR, Bonn / Host: Arnaud Belloche\n\nNew Simulations and Observations of Highly-complex Molecules in Star-forming Regions\n\nby Robin Garrod, University of Virginia, USA\n\nThe interstellar medium (ISM) is replete with molecules, and high-mass star-formation regions in particular are host to some of the most complex organic molecules yet detected outside of our solar system. Millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelength spectral data from the ALMA telescope allows us to explore the chemistry of such regions in much greater detail than ever before. The ALMA 3mm line survey EMoCA (\"Exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA\") of the chemically-rich Galactic Center source Sagittarius B2(N) has not only identified several new molecules in that source, but has led to the identification of new hot cores - a total of five are now known to exist in Sgr B2(N).\n\nI will give a brief overview of the molecular detections made by EMoCA toward Sgr B2(N). I will also present chemical kinetics models of the coupled gas-phase and grain-surface/ice-mantle chemistry occurring in Sgr B2(N) related to these molecules, with an emphasis on the treatment of the recently-detected branched carbon-chain molecule iso-propyl cyanide (i-C3H7CN). I will assess the possibilities for the presence and detectability of other branched carbon-chain molecules in the ISM. I will also present recent work that uses complex molecule abundances to constrain the cosmic-ray ionization rates and chemical timescales within different hot cores.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 21 Jan 2019 supplementary colloquium / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nOn the Formation of OB Stars: Clouds, Filaments, Cores, and the Role of Stellar Feedback\n\nby Nicolas Peretto, Cardiff University, UK\n\nThe initial conditions of star formation are imprinted within the properties of the many interstellar gaseous structures that are involved in the process. Understanding what physical mechanisms drive star formation therefore requires a detailed understanding on what regulates the dynamical evolution of the interstellar gas, from large diffuse clouds to these compact balls of nuclear burning gas. Mostly driven by the powerful combination of recent sensitive sub-millimeter large-scale surveys of star-forming clouds and high-angular resolution follow-up observations of selected sources, significant progress has been made in our understanding of star formation in the past decade. However, despite such progress, fundamental questions regarding, for instance, the pace at which gas flows from large to small scales and the origin of the low star formation efficiency within molecular clouds, still remain highly debated. In this context, I will present recent results on the properties of massive-star-forming molecular clouds from tens of parsec scales down to a few thousand AU scales. More specifically, I will be focusing on three key aspects: the evolution of cloud virial ratios as a function of cloud sizes; gravitational collapse and the role of hub filamentary systems in the formation of massive cores; and the impact of feedback from OB stars on the gas properties of the parent clouds.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 28 Jan 2019 / Koeln / Host: Peter Schilke\n\nIRAM Status, Developments and Plans – Breaking the Path for Modern Millimetre Astronomy\n\nby Karl Friedrich Schuster, IRAM, Grenoble, France\n\nIn 2019 IRAM will celebrate 40 years of existence and service to the astronomical community. Since the foundation of IRAM, operational and instrumental upgrades have kept IRAM at the forefront of millimetre wave astronomy. Over the last years IRAMs facilities NOEMA and the 30m telescope once more underwent rapid evolution and upgrades on all levels. I will describe the recent status of the observatories and the resulting scientific capabilities. While the upgrades provide vastly improved return for well-established science topics they also open up totally new approaches of astronomical research.\n\nIn a second part I will describe the challenges of the next steps as well as outline the ongoing developments and the current plans for the future of the IRAM facilities.\n\nThu 14 Mar 2019 supplementary colloquium 11 a.m. / Koeln / Host: Andreas Eckart\n\nSommer Term 2018\n\nThe Manifold Roles of Cosmic Rays in Star-forming Environments\n\nby Marco Padovani, INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, Firenze, Italy\n\nThe study of the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar matter is a multi-disciplinary investigation that involves the analysis of several physical and chemical processes: ionisation of atomic and molecular hydrogen, energy loss by elastic and inelastic collisions, energy deposition by primary and secondary electrons, gamma-ray production by pion decay, the production of light elements by spallation reactions, and much more.\n\nCosmic-ray ionisation activates the rich chemistry of dense molecular clouds and determines the degree of coupling of the gas with the local magnetic field, which in turn controls the collapse timescale and the star-formation efficiency of a molecular cloud. In recent years a wealth of observations from the ground and from space has provided information and constraints that still need to be incorporated in a consistent global theoretical framework. My goal is to use the results of chemodynamical models and state-of-the-art numerical simulations supplemented by dedicated observations to provide a unifying interpretation of the data with a model of cosmic-ray propagation specifically developed to make predictions that can be tested against the observations.\n\nFinally, I will talk about my most recent study: a mechanism able to accelerate local thermal particles in protostars that can be used to explain the high ionisation rate as well as the synchrotron emission observed towards protostellar sources.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 09 Apr 2018 / Koeln / Host: Alvaro Sanchez-Monge\n\nSpectroscopy in Solid Para Hydrogen Matrices\n\nby Yuan-Pern Lee, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan\n\nFri 13 Apr 2018 2 p.m. / Koeln / Host: Stephan Schlemmer\n\nPGOPHER – A Program for Rotational, Vibrational and Electronic Spectra\n\nby Colin M. Western, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, UK\n\nPGOPHER is a general-purpose program for simulating and fitting rotational, vibrational and electronic molecular spectra. It can be used with many different spectroscopic techniques, including microwave, infra-red, Raman, visible, ultra-violet and multiphoton spectra. It can handle many different types of molecule and interactions, including linear, symmetric and asymmetric tops, fine and hyperfine structure and perturbations. It can handle many states and species simultaneously. It is designed to be used both for analyzing unknown spectra and extracting information such as temperature and state populations from observations on known species. It is an open source program, and can be freely downloaded from a supporting website.\n\nThe talk will start with a tutorial style introduction to what the program can do, and how calculations can be set up, including an example of its use in undergraduate teaching labs. This will be followed by presentation of recent developments in the program for automatic and semi-automatic assignment of unknown spectra. Assignment of spectra remains a significant problem; it is not unusual for high resolution spectra to have 20,000 lines needing assignment, with little or no obvious pattern to the lines. PGOPHER has recently gained several tools to help with this, including several different types of plot, and methods of trying many different trial assignments, and these will be discussed.\n\n(Abstract PDF)\n\nMon 23 Apr 2018 / Koeln / Host: Oskar Asvany\n\nAnalysis of the Helicity Measured in Tomo-PIV Jet Experiments\n\nby Rodion Stepanov, Institute for Continuous Media Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Sciences\n\nTomographic Particle Imaging Velocimetry (Tomo-PIV) is a new technique to determine three-dimensional velocity vector "
