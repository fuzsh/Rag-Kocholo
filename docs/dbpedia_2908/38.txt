Ahead of performing a condition assessment of the cellar’s dry well, Preservation staff undertook an investigation of the ice house dry well, as a point of comparison.

Washington’s Ice House

On the same day that Washington was dismayed to find that no ice survived in the cellar dry well, he was pleased to discover that ice remained in a pre-existing dry well located southeast of the Mansion. Following the advice of Robert Morris, Washington eventually made improvements to that southeast dry well, noting on October 26, 1785, that he, “Took the cover off my dry Well, to see if I could not fix it better for the purpose of an Ice House, by Arching the Top, and planking the sides.” This dry well, located on the steep riverbank above the Potomac River, ultimately became his ice house.

Insulated with layers of hay, the ice melted at a much slower rate, allowing the Washingtons to enjoy ice cream and chilled drinks into the summer.
