Any suggestions are welcome\n\nHere is how the dry wells ( 5 feet depth ) are going to be connected sequentially\n\nI'm happy with the whole but I'm worried about my building foundation like I mentioned earlier and I want to take all the steps to make sure my building is safe and sound.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOur house is built like in the below picture [ Framed structure not Load bearing wall structure ]\n\nSand Character:\n\nUpdate\n\nPlease find the video of dry wells on the south side of the building here\n\nPlease find the video of dry wells on the north side of the building here\n\nFYI:\n\nAccording to local engineers , I have nothing to worry about this whole cement ring well drainage set up , because ground water table level is already at 3 to 5 feet so every building in the town is practically standing at wet ground so this drainage well will not do any harm. But I'm not convinced this dry well can saturate the soil bit more and could cause settlement which can lead to fraction in the wall ?\n\nSomebody please give their wisdom in this."
