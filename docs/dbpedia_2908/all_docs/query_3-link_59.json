        "text": "Dry wells are subsurface stormwater facilities that are used to collect and temporarily store stormwater runoff generated by clean rooftops; runoff is discharged through infiltration into the subsoil.\n\nEligible Components\n\nExcavation\n\nGrading/reseeding\n\nStone\n\nStorage reservoir\n\nPiping\n\nNon-woven geotextile fabric\n\nPre-treatment and overflow components\n\nDelivery of stone\n\nSeed/sod\n\nCost Share and/or Tax Credit Rates\n\nApplicants, including any entity or member of the same household, will be limited to $50,000.00 in cost share\n\nPermit fees are not an eligible component cost for any practice and therefore cannot receive cost-share\n\nFor specific amounts, contact the district office\n\nFAQs\n\nDue to the potential for groundwater contamination, the use of dry wells, and all stormwater infiltration best management practices (BMPs), is prohibited in areas where high pollutant or sediment loading is anticipated\n\nStorage Volume:\n\nDry wells are intended for small storm events\n\nThe storage volume of a dry well must be no greater than the runoff volume generated by the WQDS or the difference in runoff volume from pre-construction to post-construction for the 2-year storm, whichever is larger\n\nNo standing water should remain in the dry well 72 hours after a precipitation event in order to allow for sufficient storage for the next event\n\nContact the District Office to learn more!"
