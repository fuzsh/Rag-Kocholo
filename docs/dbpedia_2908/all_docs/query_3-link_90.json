        "text": "Difference between infiltration and exfiltration\n\nExfiltration trenches store water that is fed by pipe, whereas infilatration trenches are fed from the top surface and percolates into the trench.\n\nEngineers will design a stormawater drainage system for a project and calculate all the dimensions needed for an exfiltration area.\n\nThe size and elvations of pipe and the top of exfil elevation are extremely important for the drainage to work properly.\n\nThe exfiltration areas' elevations are important so that all the other drainage flows to the correct areas. If elevations do not match the design then the system will not perform as designed.\n\nBelow is a plan of an exfil. It was designed by an engineer and the highlighted exfil specs are what we use to install a correct exfil.\n\nEngineered exfil specifies all dimensions needed for this fairly large exfiltration area\n\nThe Exfil area is wrapped in cloth to keep small particles out of the rock area, a perforated pipe is run into the rock to allow water to seep in.\n\nEngineered Elements of an Exfiltration Trench\n\nWashed Rock, in Florida usually Washed #4 Rock\n\nPerforated Pipe (size & length of runs)\n\nFiltration Cloth to wrap the rock\n\nInvert elevation of the pipe\n\nDimensions of the trench/pit (determines water storage)\n\nTop of Rock Elevation\n\nWhat is a dry well ?\n\nA dry well is almost the same as an exfil trench, but is usually a square or round hole rather than a long trench.\n\nWhat is a detention pit?\n\nSome exfilatration trenches or pits can also be detention systems. The only difference is that a detention system also has an outflow as well as in inflow. This will enable the exfil to overflow to another area if it ever fills up to the maximum."
