        "text": "Spanning 200 years of occupation, the West Kitchen Yard area is one of the most artifact-rich archaeological sites excavated at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. This site, located just to the south of Monticello’s southern wing of dependencies includes deposits from three large features: the Dry Well, Mulberry Row Structure 1 (MRS-1), and a large ditch feature. The Dry Well, or large cold-storage feature, is dominated by early Jefferson-period household refuse, while the rest of the yard features are a mixture of deposits from the kitchen, South Dependency slave quarters, landscaping projects, and the MRS-1 structure.\n\nThis photograph is an overhead view of the West Kitchen Yard excavations, facing northeast. Taken near the end of excavations, the Dry Well is in the foreground, the MRS-1 (F11) stone foundation is to the south, and the ditch (F05) is to the north. The South Dependency wing of the Monticello mansion is visible in the background. Under the direction of Dr. William Kelso, this block excavation included over 45 excavation units, over 350 individual archaeological contexts, and recovered more than 100,000 artifacts over the course of three field seasons from 1979 to 1981.\n\nRecent re-analysis of the West Kitchen Yard excavations conducted in the 1980s by Kelso established a robust relative chronology for the features of this site. The Dry Well (F01) was the earliest of the three major features, followed by the ditch (F05), and then MRS-1 (F11). Furthermore, the MRS-1 assemblages were contemporary with a small assemblage from the Ha-Ha (F17). More information about this site’s chronology can be found on the DAACS Chronology page for the West Kitchen Yard.\n\nThis gallery includes artifact images, photographs, site maps, and Jefferson documents pertaining to the West Kitchen Yard Excavations. Here we specifically focus on the Dry Well feature, which not only includes some of the more remarkable artifacts from this site, but is also the feature best understood after our reanalysis project. The Dry Well is the only feature that can be directly linked to Jefferson-era documents that indicate its construction occurred between 1770 and 1771. It was built close to the South Pavilion, one of the few other structures standing at the time and where Jefferson and his wife Martha first lived on the mountain. The documents are silent as to when the Dry Well was filled, yet analysis using ceramics data from the Dry Well assemblages indicate that it was likely filled by c.1780. As you can read about in the Historical Documents section on the DAACS Background page, the Dry Well was abandoned after Jefferson constructed his final dependency wings for the mansion in other locations.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the Dry Well was likely filled fairly quickly with sediment from diverse sources.1 There is no indication that this feature caved in or was filled through erosion processes. In addition, there is no evidence that it was partially filled and then left open for any period of time prior to its final filling. Had this been the case, evidence for erosion along the walls of the feature or deposits resulting in the accumulation of eroded soils would have been identifiable.\n\nFurthermore, the different strata, or layers, of sediment in the Dry Well were visually distinct and comprised of a variety of sediments harking from different original sources. Some deposits consisted of kitchen refuse, identifiable not only by the large quantity of faunal and cooking-related artifacts within them, but by the rich organic loam and charcoal-rich matrix that surrounded them. Other deposits consisted of construction debris and sediments such as dense clay dug out from other parts of the mountain likely during the construction of the mansion’s cellars. However, many deposits were comprised of a mixture of refuse and sediments likely from other trash sources that were all gathered and mixed together to fill the extremely large Dry Well feature after it was abandoned. This secondary deposition often makes it difficult to ascertain what the original sources of the deposits were and therefore who were the original users of the objects found within those deposits.\n\nThe artifacts found within the Dry Well do provide us with an insightful glimpse into those who lived at Monticello during its earliest days. Since it was in use for a short period of time and filled rapidly, the Dry Well contains artifacts from a very narrow time span. Additionally, the size and depth of this feature ensured that it was not significantly disturbed after it was filled. Therefore many nearly intact objects were recovered. This gallery features several of these items.\n\nGiven the complexity of the entire West Kitchen Yard site, it is a challenge to unravel the history of the site. Here we present some of the most visually compelling artifacts, with the knowledge that tens-of-thousands more came from this site. We encourage visitors to this website to explore these data and do their own analysis using more detailed data provided throughout the archive.

Price, George Washington’s Mount Vernon.\n\nDuring the early construction and landscaping of the Monticello mountaintop, Thomas Jefferson drafted several plan drawings for the layout of his mansion and the accompanying dependencies, or essential service rooms. Included in these plans are references and depictions of a “dry well,” or deep cold food storage area resembling an ice house that did not use ice.\n\nConjectural drawings by Jefferson dating to the 1770s depict a “dry well” in the same location as the pit discovered by Dr. William Kelso in the West Kitchen Yard.1 A hand-drawn sketch from about 1770 shows an L-shaped wing, comprised of an above-ground covered passage extending to the south from the South Pavilion and leading to a row of connected dependencies stretching to the west.2 The rooms labeled on this plan include a laundry, dairy, smokehouse, storeroom, hen house, cook’s room, and Dry Well. A hardline drawing, likely completed shortly after the sketch, documents a similar plan.3 The Dry Well is the only part of this plan found to have been constructed in the location depicted. However, some of the other structures drawn on it may lie undetected to the west, outside the limits of Kelso’s excavations.\n\nIn an entry in his Memorandum Book from December 1770, Jefferson documented the construction process of the Dry Well, as discussed elsewhere in this gallery. The term “Dry Well” also appears on several other documents from the 1770s. A full summary and discussion of the historical documents pertaining to the Dry Well can be found on the West Kitchen Yard’s Background Page.\n\nThese architectural plans and primary sources represent the only historical record of the Dry Well feature. No references have yet been found pertaining to how, why, or when it was abandoned and filled. However, the documents pertaining to the construction of the Dry Well did provide archaeologists with enough information to link what was excavated with what appears in Jefferson’s early documents, thus confidently identifying the large pit feature as the early Dry Well.\n\nReferences\n\n1Kelso, William M.

They were recovering very few artifacts from the thick layer of re-deposited subsoil, which at Monticello consists of orange-colored clay and greenstone, when they revealed dark green glass poking through the clay. Further excavation revealed six intact wine bottles, sitting upright at the bottom of the Dry Well, many with their corks still intact. If this was not enough of a remarkable discovery, when the bottles were fully exposed the archaeologists saw that they were filled with liquid, sediment, and what they would soon discover, Jefferson-era preserved fruit. This photograph shows the bottles in situ, or in place, shortly after they were discovered.\n\nThe bottles were removed to the archaeology laboratory, where they were cleaned and photographed and then their contents were carefully removed. The bottles contained small cherries, grapes, and cranberries, many of which were still whole . Some of the fruits had deteriorated and only pits and skin remnants from the fruit remained. The fruit had been blanched and stored in these bottles, likely using methods similar to blanching and canning fruit today. This was a documented practice during the Colonial period1 and other bottles similar to these were found during excavations at Colonial Williamsburg in the 1960s.2 Further analysis indicated that the liquid inside was water, possibly ground water that had slowly seeped in over the centuries.\n\nThe bottles themselves are made from dark olive-green glass, sometimes called “black” glass due to the overall dark appearance of the bottle. They were manufactured in England and their size, shape, and style indicates that they were likely manufactured in the 1760s and 1770s. This correlates with the manufacturing date for many of the Dry Well artifacts.\n\nThese bottles, their contents, and their location in the Dry Well are significant because they are the only concrete evidence that the Dry Well was used as a cold storage feature prior to the construction of the Monticello cellars. While the other contents of the Dry Well were removed before it was filled in, these bottles were left in place, possibly forgotten or not considered valuable enough to remove.\n\nReferences\n\n1Brandau, Rosemary.
