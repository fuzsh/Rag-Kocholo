It will help you understand how to manage Class V wells to prevent contamination of underground sources of drinking water (USDWs).\n\nWhat is a Class V well?\n\nA Class V well is used to inject non-hazardous fluids underground. Fluids are injected either into or above an underground source of drinking water.\n\nClass V wells include any wells that are not already classified as Classes I-IV or Class VI wells. This diverse group ranges from simple shallow wells to complex experimental injection technologies.\n\nMost Class V wells are \"low-tech\" and depend on gravity to drain fluids directly below the land surface. Dry wells, cesspools, and septic system leach fields are examples of simple Class V wells. Because their construction often provides little or no pretreatment and these fluids are injected directly into or above an underground source of drinking water, proper management is important.\n\nMore sophisticated Class V wells may rely on gravity or use pressure systems for fluid injection. Some sophisticated systems include advanced wastewater disposal systems used by industry, experimental wells used to test new or unproven technologies, and systems used to inject and store water for later reuse.\n\nWhat are the common uses of Class V wells?\n\nClass V wells provide for the injection of fluids for a variety of municipal, business and industry practices. They include injection wells with both simple and complex designs.\n\nExamples of \"low-tech\" Class V injection wells that typically rely on gravity drainage include:\n\nApartment buildings that use septic systems for sanitary waste disposal\n\nMunicipalities where stormwater flows into dry wells\n\nStrip malls where businesses such as photo processors and dry cleaners discharge sanitary wastes and process chemicals into septic systems\n\nOffice buildings that inject water passed through heat exchangers to cool the buildings\n\nCarwashes where wastewater enters a floor drain that leads to a dry well or septic system\n\nExamples of sophisticated Class V wells include:\n\nExperimental wells used for slurry injection of municipal waste\n\nWells used for the injection of drinking water treatment residuals\n\nDeep brine injection wells\n\nHow many types of Class V wells are there?\n\nClass V wells vary according to the businesses that use them, their construction, and the fluids they receive. In 1999, EPA conducted a study of 23 Class V well types and estimated that there are more than 650,000 of these wells in use in the United States. Class V wells are located in every state, especially in unsewered areas where the population is also likely to depend on ground water for their drinking water. EPA's Class V study provides detailed information on:\n\nSpecific Class V well types\n\nGeographic distribution of Class V wells\n\nCharacteristics of injected fluids\n\nIndividual state regulations\n\nRead EPA's Class V Underground Injection Control Study to learn more about Class V wells\n\nHow Do the Requirements for Class V Wells Prevent Contamination?\n\nClass V wells are a concern because they pose a risk to underground sources of drinking water. Because of this they are regulated by the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program under the Authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nEPA established minimum requirements to prevent injection wells from contaminating underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). In addition, Class V regulations are linked to EPA's source water assessment program.\n\nLearn more about the federal requirements for Class V Wells.\n\nWhat Can I Do to Protect Drinking Water?\n\nPreventing contamination can save you money and protect your family's health. Here are some things you can do to help protect your drinking water source:"
