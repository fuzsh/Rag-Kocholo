        "text": "Private Well Safety Program\n\nThe Private Well Safety Program goals are to raise awareness of private water well supplies and promote drinking water safety. We can provide technical assistance, and in the future, offer free water sampling to eligible participants.\n\nDue to the overwhelming popularity of the free well water sampling program, we have reached the maximum number of samples we can take at this time. However, please continue to submit the online interest form and we will contact you as soon as we procure additional grant funding for this project.\n\nInterested in participating?\n\nPlease fill out and submit our online form.\n\nGroundwater\n\nLife as we know it would be impossible without groundwater. It is the world's most extracted natural resource and supplies drinking water to approximately 164 million Americans each day. Don’t take groundwater for granted. Pay it forward during National Groundwater Awareness Week by letting others know the importance of groundwater and how to ensure your private well water is safe. Do you know where your water comes from?\n\nCDC Groundwater Awareness information.\n\nIn Deschutes County:\n\n•There are approximately 17,000 private wells in Deschutes County serving 34,846 people\n\n•180 public water systems serve 180,207 people and all but one use groundwater alone\n\nIn Oregon:\n\n•90% of public water systems in Oregon utilize ground water exclusively\n\n•Approximately 400,000 (23%) of Oregonians rely on water from 350,000 private wells\n\n•20% of private wells test positive for coliform bacteria\n\n•3,800 new wells are drilled every year\n\nWhat can you do to protect your private water supply?\n\nGround water sources can become contaminated with germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, as well as chemicals, like those used in fertilizers and pesticides, which can cause sickness and disease. Be aware of the source of your water. If your water is sourced from a private well its your responsibility to ensure your water is safe.\n\nKnow where your wellhead is located and how it is sealed.\n\nMake sure fuels and chemicals are stored away from the wellhead.\n\nMake sure septic systems are at least 100 feet from the well.\n\nPeriodically inspect the wellhead for cracks or gaps.\n\nEnsure surface runoff drains away from the well casing.\n\nHire a licensed well driller or pump installer for repairs or modifications.\n\nKeep the area around the wellhead clean and under your control.\n\nSample your well annually for bacteria and nitrate.\n\nHow do you test a private well in Deschutes County?\n\nSpring is right around the corner and is a great time to test your domestic well. The CDC recommends testing your private well at least once per year for Coliform bacteria and nitrates. Several local labs offer testing for private well owners. Please contact them directly for sampling instructions and cost of testing. Special sample bottles are required so make sure you call the lab prior to taking your samples.\n\nEdge Analytical, Inc. Bend 541-639-8425\n\nUmpqua Research Company Bend 541-312-9454\n\nBox R Water Analysis Laboratory, L.L.C. Prineville 541-447-4911\n\nWhen selling a property with a water well used for domestic purposes, it must be tested for bacteria, nitrate, and arsenic.\n\nThe Domestic Well Safety Program has you covered on what you need know! Visit their website at: www.healthoregon.org/wells\n\nFor more information about drinking water, public water systems and private wells in Deschutes County visit https://www.deschutes.org/health/page/drinking-water\n\nWhat to do if your well runs dry\n\nGet a backup water storage tank, such as a cistern. According to Chrissy Lucas, with OSU, even well owners who are not experiencing water shortages should have a back-up tank in case of emergencies. See https://wellwater.oregonstate.edu/ for more information for well owners.\n\nContact a licensed well constructor or pump installer to access the well, if you are experiencing trouble with your water supply. Oftentimes, wells get clogged due to a lack of maintenance and haven't actually gone dry. If you do need to dig deeper or construct a new well, find a licensed well constructor: https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/gw/well_license/default.aspx\n\nLocate your well log. This provides details on geologic formations encountered in a well, as well as details about the well design, construction and yield, and can help you decide what to do if your well has gone dry. If there is a copy of your well log, you can find it through the water resource department: https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/gw/well_log/Default.aspx\n\nReport a dry well to the Oregon Water Resources Department:\n\nReporting your dry well also helps scientists and water managers better understand changes in groundwater supplies and how those changes may be impacting people that rely on those supplies. If you report your dry well, the Department may notify you of funding and other assistance, if the Department is made aware of any available for your area. Report a Dry Well Here\n\nApply for funding:\n\nWell Abandonment, Repair and Replacement Fund (WARRF)\n\nhttps://www.oregon.gov/owrd/programs/GWWL/WARRF/Pages/default.aspx\n\nNeighbor Impact Home Preservation Loan Program\n\nhttps://www.neighborimpact.org/home-preservation-loan/\n\nRural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC)\n\nhttps://www.rcac.org/\n\nIn addition to Oregon-specific grants, funding may be available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides loans to low-income homeowners up to $40,000 to repair or improve homes, including private water wells. See: USDA Rural Development Grants\n\nDuring drought, increased groundwater pumping coupled with reduced recharge can result in low water yields from wells. More information on some of these items is included in this Dry Well Handout\n\nRead the Oregon Water Resources Department's well owner’s handbook for more information: Water Well Owner’s Handbook\n\nFunding Resources"
