        "text": "I have a dry well to prevent my yard and studio/office from flooding. It has a rim of bricks, which rise above the ground a little to stop too much garden waste entering the well (I guess). I want to cut channels into the bricks to improve water flow: it seems that the top of the rim is almost level with the top of the step into the studio. But, I also want to prevent mosquitos from breeding in it.\n\nPhoto of dry well showing edge/rim with inadequate inlet channels.\n\nPhoto looking down into dry well, showing the pump and float and outlet pipe. The rim is made of newer bricks; presumably it was added recently to keep out garden waste.\n\nPhoto of a nearby building entrance with a high water mark almost at the point where it would overflow indoors.\n\nHow can I increase water flow into the dry well while also keeping mosquitos out?\n\nI could make the channels wide and install a mesh, but I'm hoping for something simpler. Mosquito nets need to be finer than 1.2mm, but I wonder if these can be a little wider because they will be deep grooves, not a thin mesh? So like, how narrow do other gaps around the house have to be to prevent mosquitos, e.g. gaps around doors? I plan to use a circular saw which I think will be wider than 1.2mm.\n\nAs visible in the photos above, the well currently has a cover that definitely won't keep mosquitos out. I'll be replacing that for sure.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the layout of your dry well that it has a rim of brick that you want to modify to allow more water but no mosquitos through, but aren't worried about them just flying into the opening. In any case...\n\nAccording to this site:\n\nTreat Water Features\n\nHere are some easy ways to steer mosquitoes away from water features like fountains and pools:\n\nRun fountains and other water features regularly so that the water keeps moving\n\nRegularly clean water features\n\nGrow mosquito-repelling plants, such as rosemary, lavender, citronella, catnip, and mint, close to water features\n\nApply solutions of larvicide to interrupt the breeding cycle\n\nSprinkle the water with cinnamon\n\nAdd essential oils to the water\n\nAdd mosquito-eating fish\n\nSome points will require regular maintenance after every rain when there's water sitting in the dry well and may be impractical. However, decorating around the top with the plants near the \"water feature\" will be an ongoing solution that requires a minimum of maintenance on your part.\n\nFollowing some of these suggestions should help prevent the mosquitos from getting into the well and breeding in the first place. Additionally, if you plant mint, it tends to spread, so you could transplant some to other locations around your yard and, possibly, end up with an entirely mosquito free yard!\n\nanswered Oct 14, 2022 at 13:46\n\nFreeManFreeMan\n\n47.8k2525 gold badges9494 silver badges199199 bronze badges"
