        "text": "Why is this well running dry with such a high water table?\n\nWells go dry based on their use, not just where they are.\n\nEven a well in a high water table will eventually run low if a lot of villagers are accessing it.\n\nTry surrounding the well with decorative trees. When you’re placing trees they show a surrounding area where they increase ground water. I’m not sure if this actually works, but it is suggested in a tooltip somewhere. I’m also unsure if all tree types have the same impact on groundwater, it would be cool if there was variation though.\n\nAlso check to make sure it isn’t getting a penalty for being too close to another well, it looks pretty close to the limit so I can’t tell just by looking at it.\n\nSo after playing around with it to try work out what is happening I have confirmed that planting trees around the well can increase the “terrain water bonus” sometimes. It seems to maybe depend on the elevation whether planting a tree will or won’t have an effect. Raising or lowering terrain doesn’t seem to effect that though, so maybe that elevation is hard baked when you start a map. There is a seasonal water bonus too, which combines with the ground water bonus though together they cap at 100%. It isn’t clear whether this water bonus is to capacity or replenishment rate. Groundwater bonus feels like it would be capacity, but the seasonal bonus feels more like replenishment rate. They get combined for the final bonus though so possibly it is increasing both? Also when it rains it says there is a 300% bonus to refill rate.\n\nIn conclusion, the current numbers displayed are a bit of a mystery when trying to work out what is actually happening. “Bonus” to what? It would be good if it showed how much groundwater was available/max, what the groundwater replenishment rate is, and what the well draw rate is. Maybe someone else will have a better time guessing at the hidden mechanics behind wells.\n\nA bit more info would help. I had the same issue, upgraded wells always run dry, but at least in my case, didn’t seem to affect anything and everyone always had plenty of water regardless. I destroyed them and put regular wells back down just because the dry notification bugged me.\n\nMy wells were all far enough apart, were well in the blue for water, and had multiple trees planted around them. Yet still ran dry almost immediately after placement. Some that ran dry were even located on the edges of towns in areas I had hardly built out, and were barely in use. And no, they didn’t get used up putting out a fire either.\n\nIt is pretty weird when a “Upgrade” is actually a downgrade."
