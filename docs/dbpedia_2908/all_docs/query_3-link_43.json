        "text": "Hi,\n\nThat shouldn’t be a problem for your trees. The area under your dry well will be saturated but the trees have a lot of space in other parts of the yard to have dry roots. Over irrigating near the trunk, or over a large portion of the root zone, can be a problem though.\n\nThe water in your dry well will probably get stinky and anaerobic, but so long as no one contacts it it shouldn’t harm anything.\n\nIf you are interested in using the greywater for irrigation then a different sort of system would be required. Greywater systems are designed to prevent ponding water and spread it out over a larger area so there is no stagnant, stinky water."
