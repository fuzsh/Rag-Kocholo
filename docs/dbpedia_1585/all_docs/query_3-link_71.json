However, a firm uses a specific method based on its project needs. So, let us explore the widely used Agile methodologies in software development.\n\nScrum\n\nScrum is one of the commonly used Agile development methodologies. It breaks down the project into small development cycles called Sprints. Typically, the scrum method involves a small team led by a Scrum master whose main job is to remove roadblocks in the project. As a result, this method focuses on managing tasks by delegating each task to different teams.\n\nKanban\n\nKanban is a visual workflow technique to manage the development team in SDLC. It is an Agile methodology of software development that involves using Kanban board tools to supervise software creation. The team uses cards and columns to represent each task and stage in the SDLC. As a result, this method enables them to reduce the amount of work in the development process since it helps identify all the roadblocks through visualization.\n\nFeature Driven Development\n\nFeature Driven Development (FDD) focuses on designing and creating features that the developers are working to build. Therefore, this method outlines work phases for each feature to review its codes and designs. Besides, FDD relies on customer input to develop features in software apps that suit the target customers' needs.\n\nExtreme Programming\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) is an efficient Agile methodology of software development since it focuses on the technical aspects of the SDLC. It also introduces best practices to help the development team simplify the entire development process. Besides, the XP method prioritizes communication and customer involvement to make the process efficient.\n\nAdaptive Software Development\n\nAdaptive Software Development (ASD) is a common Agile methodology used in companies that involve continuous adaptation.

The stakeholders will again participate in this step to provide more information on the app's needs and functionality.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe next step in the Agile methodology of software development is iteration. It is the longest stage in the Agile development lifecycle since it involves carrying out all the work mentioned in the planning stage. Here, the developers and UI/UX designers work together to turn the app concept into full-fledged software apps. If the product owner wants to include more features, the developers can build them during this stage.\n\nRelease\n\nOnce the app gets built, the QA team performs tests to validate the app's performance. The team ensures the app is free from defects before its launch. If QA specialists find any potential issues in the app, they send the app to the developers to fix them.\n\nMaintenance\n\nOnce the product becomes accessible to the end users, the developers provide ongoing maintenance services. Leveraging this service ensures the software runs smoothly without a hitch in the real world. Besides, new iterations occur during this stage to make the software more feature-rich.\n\nRetirement\n\nRetirement typically is the last stage of the Agile methodology of software development. A software product enters this phase when it becomes outdated or replaced by new software.
