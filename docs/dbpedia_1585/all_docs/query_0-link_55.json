        "text": "Here is a list of the top 5 types of Agile Methodology. To keep up with the rapid changes in the paradigm of technology, agile technology was born. Agile provided a notable shift in the project management method known as “Waterfall” which had previously been the standard.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAgile software development methodologies came to prominence circa 2001. They arose out of the revered agile manifesto that laid down the principles and core practices. Before understanding the agile methodologies definition, it is pertinent to know what agile is.\n\nAgile is a set of techniques that a team follows to administer a project or plan by dividing it into various stages with continuous collaboration with customers. There is constant monitoring at every phase of the software development of the project. The agile methodology advantages are that both the development plus testing actions are parallel and synchronized, unlike the conventional waterfall methodology.\n\nRead more about Agile.\n\n5 Important Types Of Agile Methodology\n\nThere are various types of agile methodology available in the market to suit every project’s wants. Although there are different agile methodologies, the principles in the agile manifesto undergird them all.\n\nToday, software professionals refer to any use of these principles as “Agile”, regardless of which type they ultimately use. However, one can only reap the agile methodology benefits with the collaboration of all the involved parties.\n\nThe below list comprises famous types of agile methodology that one can opt to utilize:\n\n1) Kanban\n\nOriginating from the Japanese language, the translation of the word ‘Kanban’ is “signboard”. It is part of the Japanese concept of “just in time”. The Japanese originally introduced the Kanban concept to increase innovation and efficiency in the manufacturing industry. It was a tremendous success. Consequently, the software industry adopted it because many of its concepts dovetail perfectly.\n\nKanban is a very visual framework for developing and managing projects. Participants utilize a multi-column “Kanban Board” to depict the process flow of software development. This helps in increasing visibility, as the teams can see the progress through every stage of development. Seeing the tasks on the board helps motivate them to deliver the product “just in time”.\n\nThis method requires total transparency in order to work. You can’t hide from the Kanban board!\n\n2) Scrum\n\nOne of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development methodology. In this method, project managers break each project into “sprints” which can last from a few days to a few months. During each sprint, the team focuses on completing a specified set of deliverables, without worrying to much about the big picture. Then when the sprint is over, all stakeholders review the completed work. They then plan for the next sprint based on the learnings and feedback they’ve gleaned from the last sprint.\n\nThe benefit of this method is that it allows one to adjust priorities in real-time as they watch the application come to life.\n\nScrum Team has exclusive project roles such as a scrum master and a product owner with constant communications on the daily scrum where the activities are harmonized to devise the best way to implement the sprint.\n\nCodeStringers typically employs this method, for example in the development of RapidOnboarder for MasterControl.\n\n3) Extreme Programming (XP)\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and feedback. It focuses on constant development and customer satisfaction. Similar to scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a team to create a productive and highly efficient environment.\n\nExtreme Programming technique is very supportive in a situation of constant and varying demands from the customers. It motivates the developers to accept changes in the customer’s demands, even if they pop-up in an advanced phase of the development process.\n\nIn Extreme Programming, the project is tested from the initial stages by collecting feedback that progresses the output of the system. This also presents a spot check to implement easily any customer requirements.\n\n4) Crystal\n\nMr. Alistair Cockburn invented Crystal. He was one of the original, monumental persons in formulating the Agile manifesto for software development. Crystal is his latest iteration. Crystal is a group of smaller agile development methodologies: Crystal Yellow, Crystal Clear, Crystal Red, Crystal Orange, and more. Each has its peculiar and exclusive framework that is characterized by factors such as system criticality, team size, and project priorities. One chooses a framework depending on the nature of the project or system criticality. Some examples of the factors are: Comfort (C), Essential Money (E), Discretionary Money (D), and Life (L).\n\nSimilar to other methodologies of Agile, Crystal also addresses prompt delivery of software, regularity, less administration with high involvement of users, and customer satisfaction. The Crystal family advocates that each system or project is inimitable. Therefore, each necessitates the solicitation of diverse practices, processes, and policies to achieve the best results.\n\n5) Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nThe Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) addresses the need for a standard industry charter for the swift delivery of software. DSDM gives a comprehensive structure that is defined and modified to create a plan, execute, manage, and scale the procedure of software development. Based on a business-driven approach and eight principles, the DSDM anticipates ongoing project modifications. However, it maintains the focus on quality and timely delivery.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne must use a dynamic approach in choosing the right agile methodology. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each agile methodology as it pertains to your particular circumstances.\n\noriginal article: Ajay Sarangam"
