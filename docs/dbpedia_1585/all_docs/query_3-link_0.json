        "text": "What is Agile?\n\nAgile is an approach to project management that centers around incremental and iterative steps to completing projects. The incremental parts of a project are carried out in short-term development cycles. The approach prioritizes quick delivery, adapting to change, and collaboration rather than top-down management and following a set plan.\n\nIn the Agile process, there is continuous feedback, allowing team members to adjust to challenges as they arise and stakeholders an opportunity to communicate consistently. Though originally created for software development, the Agile approach is now widely used in executing many different types of projects and in running organizations.\n\nContrast this with any traditional method of project management. Traditional project management generally progresses linearly through planning, designing, implementation, and closing stages. One stage must be completed before moving to the next one. Â Â\n\nIf you're considering learning Agile to advance your project management career, you might consider boosting your resume with a certificate. You can earn a career certificate from Google by completing their Agile Project Management course or complete the entire course series to earn the Google Project Management Professional Certificate.\n\nAgile pros and cons\n\nAlthough Agile is gaining in popularity and has a host of advantages, itâs not without its challenges. Below are some of the benefits and drawbacks Agile users faced, according to Digital.aiâs 2024 State of Agile Survey [1].\n\nWhen should you use Agile project management?\n\nThe tenets of Agileâadaptability, iteration, continuous delivery, and short time frames, among othersâmake it a project management style thatâs better suited for ongoing projects and projects where certain details arenât known from the outset. That means if a project doesnât have clear constraints, timelines, or available resources, itâs a good candidate for an Agile approach.\n\nFor example, designing and launching new products might push project teams against several unforeseen challenges. Having an Agile approach can mean projects already have the methodology to test products as often as needed, iterate quickly, and communicate changes with project stakeholders.\n\nTraditional project management approaches like Waterfall can be easier to plan out and progress easier to measure. This can make projects with clearly demarcated constraints (like a strict budget or timeline), or projects where teams are expected to work independently of stakeholders better suited for traditional approaches.\n\nIndustries that use Agile methods\n\nAgile grew from the minds of a group of software development project managers. Since then, it has continued to be popular in software development, but has expanded to many other industries as well. These include finance, IT, business, fashion, biotechnology, and even constructionâamong many others.\n\nUsing both Agile methods and Waterfall methods\n\nNot all projects fit neatly into one category or the other. For projects that might benefit from elements of both a traditional approach and iterative approach, an Agile-Waterfall hybrid approach can make sense. This could mean, for example, that planning and design are done in Waterfall, but development is carried out in short development cycles, Agile-style.\n\nRead more: 12 Project Management Methodologies: Your Guide\n\nAgile methodologies and frameworks\n\nThere are several Agile methodologies and frameworks, each with its own pros and cons. Some are hybrids of multiple methodologies. Scrum is the most commonly used Agile methodology. Digital.ai found that 63 percent of Agile adopters use Scrum [1].\n\nPopular Agile methodologies include:\n\nScrum\n\nKanban\n\nLean\n\nCrystal\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nFeature-Driven Development (FDD)\n\nDomain-Driven Design (DDD)\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nScrumBan\n\nAgile-Waterfall/Hybrid Agile\n\nScrum XP Hybrid\n\nRead more: Agile vs. Scrum: Which Should You Use, and Why?\n\nScaling methods\n\nAgile scaling methods are used to implement Agile practices across multiple teams, or entire organizations. There are several scaling methods, including the following:\n\nScaled Agile Framework (SAFe)\n\nScrum of Scrums\n\nDisciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)\n\nLarge Scale Scrum (LSS or LeSS)\n\nEnterprise Scrum\n\nLean Management\n\nAgile Portfolio Management (APM)\n\nNexus\n\nAgile values and principles\n\nAgile project management was established on four values and twelve principles. These values and principles are rooted in the Agile Manifesto, which was created in 2001 by seventeen managers of software development [2]. Much of the philosophy that underpins the Agile Manifesto came about in reaction to what people perceived as the bottlenecks of software development processes at the time.\n\nAgile Values\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools: While tools and processes are important, the Agile Manifesto prioritizes the people behind them. Having the right people in place and empowering them to interact smoothly with each other can lead to successes that tools by themselves wonât be able to.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation: The creators of Agile believed that it was more important to get stuff done than get bogged down in the planning and documentation stages.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation: Instead of siloing stakeholders off from the project, Agile aims to maintain contact with them throughout the creation process.\n\nResponding to change over following a plan: Following a plan that doesnât make sense to follow anymore can be counterproductive. Adaptation is central to the Agile philosophy.\n\nThe twelve principles define early and frequent delivery, simplicity, constant feedback, the collaboration of interested parties, and individual support, among other principles, as the pillars of Agile project management [3].\n\nAgile certifications\n\nCertifications in Agile project management can verify your knowledge of Agile as a whole, or in specific Agile methodologies. Think about what skills youâll likely use in your workplace and career before deciding on which certification to get.\n\nCommon Agile certifications include:\n\nPMI-Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)\n\nICAgile Certified Professional (ICP)\n\nAgilePM Foundation - APMG\n\nRead more: 6 Popular Agile Certifications\n\nYou can also consider a certification in a specific framework. Scrum is the most commonly used Agile method, so a Scrum certification could be a good place to start. These include:\n\nCertified ScrumMaster (CSM)\n\nProfessional Scrum Master (PSM)\n\nCertified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO)\n\nRead more: 7 In-Demand Scrum Master Certifications\n\nUsing Agile for AI products\n\nWith IBM's AI Product Manager Professional Certificate, you can learn to apply your project management skills to the AI product management lifecycle. You'll examine real-world case studies of successful AI integration and develop or strengthen your knowledge of Agile concepts and methodologies. By the end, you'll have earned a Professional Certificate from an industry leader in technology.\n\nSharpen your Agile skills with Coursera\n\nTaking online courses can be a great way to get to know Agile basics and incorporate this methodology into your workplace. Coursera has several top-rated courses to get you started:\n\nConsider Atlassian University's free course, Agile with Atlassian Jira, to learn how to configure the Jira software and use it to practice the Agile methodology.\n\nWhen you're ready to advance your career in Agile, take the University of Virginia's Agile Development Specialization. This course takes about a month to complete and covers how to lead product development teams using the Agile approach."
