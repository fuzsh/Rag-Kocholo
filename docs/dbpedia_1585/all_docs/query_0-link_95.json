        "text": "NASCAR and Formula One teams have the same goal: get a car around a racetrack as quickly and safely as possible. But they take different approachesâNASCAR uses stock cars, and Formula One uses open-wheel cars.\n\nAgile methodologies are a bit like these racing teams, as they each offer software development teams different ways to quickly get products and features to customers. The best part, you donât need to pick just one. Software development teams can use a mix of Agile processes based on their budgets, customers, market conditions, and other factors important to them.\n\nNot sure where to start in adopting these methodologies? Keep reading to learn about the benefits of Agile and how some of the most popular methodologies work, so you can choose the best one(s) for your software development team.\n\nWhat is Agile?\n\nAgile methodologies are sets of practices that help software development teams deliver value to customers through iteration.\n\nThe goal is to make continuous, fast, incremental improvements as a development team based on feedback from end users.\n\nProjects are broken up into shorter phases for teams to cycle through: first planning, then executing, and finally evaluating the impact of their work.\n\nThe official history of Agile starts with the Agile Manifestoâa document that was created in early 2001 by a group of software development professionals that called themselves the âAgile Alliance.â The document highlights the values and principles that have become pillars of the agile development model.\n\nBut whyâd they create it? Developers were looking for a more modern approach to software development, something to replace the âWaterfallâ methodology popularized in the 1970s.\n\nâWaterfallâ is a linear sequential model, which is a very academic way of saying that your team doesnât move on to the next phase of your project until the prior step is fully developed, tested, and ready to go. Agile doesnât have this rigidity: development and testing happen simultaneously, creating a continuous feedback loop for all stakeholders (like developers, product managers, designers, QA, and customers).\n\nWhat are the main benefits of Agile?\n\nCustomer needs and expectations can change during the development lifecycle. Unlike the âWaterfallâ model, agile development makes it easy to adapt to these shifts by changing previous phases or even pivoting to an entirely new initiative when necessary.\n\nWith this flexibility and adaptability come many advantages of Agile.\n\nFrequent delivery\n\nAgile principles emphasize working iteratively and quickly, but this doesnât mean rushing processes for the sake of speed. It means empowering teams to deliver smaller changes on a more regular basis.\n\nProjects are broken down into smaller, repeatable tasks with frequent deliveries. In linear development methods, the customer doesnât see what the product is going to look like until itâs finalized. Agile brings customers into the development process, gathering and incorporating their feedback throughout.\n\nImagine youâre building a travel booking website. The website should allow people to find and book flights, train rides, car rentals, hotels, and more.\n\nInstead of waiting for the entire website to be completed before making it public, an agile development approach could focus on delivering âflightsâ first.\n\nReleasing new features incrementally allows customers to interact with them. Customers can then immediately evaluate and provide feedback on a feature. The insights garnered from user behavior and feedback can then be used to improve your development process for upcoming features.\n\nTighter collaboration and communication\n\nAgileâs fast-moving initiatives and frequent deadlines make close collaboration and teamwork a priority. Fast, incremental delivery requires all stakeholders to be equally invested in the process in order to achieve their goals.\n\nAgile teams have the visibility they need to plan ahead and prioritize tasks. Better communication also decreases the chances of team members not having anything to work on or having too much on their plates at once. In Agile, transparency and a willingness to share ideas openly are crucial, making collaboration and open communication key.\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nWith linear development methodologies, teams only review processes once projects are complete. Agile project management gives teams more room to experiment with processes, see what works and what doesnât, and make necessary changes immediately instead of waiting for the project to finish.\n\nThrough constant evaluations, your team will get better at estimating the time it takes to complete tasks. Youâll also be able to understand your customers better through continuous communication and tailor your processes over time to match their preferences as well.\n\nFor example, you might notice after each new release that your customerâs reactions or comments are becoming increasingly sparse. This might be a sign that your communication style is too technical, and they donât really understand whatâs been delivered.\n\nAgile work can catch an issue like this early to constantly improve every aspect of your work, customer communication included.\n\n4 popular agile project methodologies\n\nAt their cores, all agile frameworks share the same principles: iteration, collaboration, learning, and delivering value to the end user.\n\nSince all agile methodologies preach the same principles, itâs not unusual for teams to use a couple of different methodologies at once. For example, the two most popular frameworks, Scrum and Kanban, are often combined to create a hybrid system called âScrumban.â\n\nLetâs take a look at some of the most popular agile approaches to get a better understanding of what agile software development looks like in action.\n\n1. Scrum\n\nThe term âScrumâ originates from the sport of rugby. In rugby, a scrum is when the team huddles together to move the ball forward in unison. In software development, it signifies your team coming together to move the product forward.\n\nAll work in the Scrum methodology revolves around the âSprint.â A Sprint is a fixed time period of work: the iteration period. It could be a week, a month, or any other period of time, depending on the project and what it calls for.\n\nGenerally, the shorter the Sprint, the more frequently teams receive feedback.\n\nScrum roles\n\nScrum teams have three main roles: the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the Developers.\n\nThe Scrum Master leads the team. Their responsibility is to keep communication and collaboration between all stakeholders running smoothly\n\nThe Product Owner is in charge of managing the product backlog. The Scrum Master lets the Product Owner know the goals and scope of the initiative, so the Product Manager can focus on prioritizing the features that deliver value as quickly as possible\n\nThe Developers are building the code, so they can give the most realistic time estimates for each iteration. They will work with the Product Owner to decide what features will be built during each Sprint\n\nScrum processes\n\nThere are four main processes that are included in each Sprint:\n\nSprint planning defines the goals for each Sprint. During planning, theyâll pick features from the backlog to work on and define how long the Sprint will last.\n\nDaily standups are 15-minute daily meetings to discuss progress and call out any potential roadblocks that could compromise the Sprintâs success\n\nSprint reviews occur at the end of each Sprint. The team discusses what they achieved and how much progress theyâve made\n\nSprint retrospectives are more detailed reviews where the team discusses what worked well and what problems need to be addressed to make the next Sprint more successful than the last\n\nIs scrum right for your team?Â\n\nScrum is the most popular agile methodology because it can be used by just about any type of team. Itâs one of the best methods for teams new to Agile because the roles and processes are logical, simple, and easy to follow.\n\nWhile the most basic version of Scrum is designed to work best with small teams, there are offshoot methodologies for larger Scrum teams, like Scrum of Scrums (SoS), Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS), and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).\n\n2. Kanban\n\nScrum and Kanban are very similar concepts that both focus on incremental, continuous improvement.\n\nThe biggest difference is that Kanban is a much more loose and less structured methodology. Kanban is a continuous planning process. There is no formal commitment to complete something in a set duration of time, like in a Sprint.\n\nKanban roles\n\nWhile there are no official roles in Kanban, teams sometimes give certain members unofficial roles: most commonly, the Service Request Manager (SRM) and Service Delivery Manager (SDM):\n\nThe SRM is similar to the Scrum Master. Itâs one person on the team who is designated to liaise with customers and other stakeholders (like upper management) to understand their needs and expectations better and relay that knowledge to the team\n\nThe SDM is like the Product Owner. They are tasked with identifying and helping to remove blockers to make sure that the team is able to work on their tasks without interruptions and unwanted delays\n\nKanban processes\n\nKanban uses a âcontinuous workflowâ structure without defined increments like Sprints. However, teams do create stages for their continuous workflow. Every team defines these stages as they please, but most commonly itâs âTo Do, In Progress, In Review, Blocked, Done.â\n\nThe centerpiece of the process is the Kanban Board, which helps the team visualize work that passes through each stage. The Kanban Board has several core elements:\n\nWorkflow stages (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Blocked, and Done) are visually present as columns or pipelines\n\nTask cards represent each task that needs to be completed. They are moved through the pipeline and taken off the board when they are considered done\n\nWork-in-progress limits designate the maximum number of tasks your team should have in each column at any given time. These limits provide a framework to gauge capacity, optimize the workflow, and minimize burnout.\n\nIs Kanban right for your team?Â\n\nIf you appreciate the values and principles of Scrum but find it a bit too time-bound, Kanbanâs style of continual workflow with no fixed iterations might be perfect for you. The biggest difference between the two is the Sprint.\n\nWith Kanban, you donât have to wait until a Sprint is over to deliver a feature or reflect on the work youâve done. The development process is continuous and doesnât have any strict deadlines or timeframes to follow.\n\nKanban Boards are also great for teams that respond better to visual frameworks and want an easy and clear way to follow their progress.\n\n3. Extreme programming (XP)\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) is an agile methodology that prioritizes speed without sacrificing code quality. Developers are expected to push themselves to the limits of their abilities, hence the âextremeâ epithet.\n\nBut how do you work quickly without sacrificing quality? In XP, you write the tests before you write the code, and every line of written code must pass testing before itâs released. In this test-driven development, short cycles and immediate feedback result in more reliable code that works the way itâs supposed to on the first try.\n\nXP roles\n\nThere are three main roles in an agile XP team:\n\nCoaches are typically external consultants who have experience working with XP teams but arenât directly involved with the development processes. They can help teams that are new to XP avoid common mistakes\n\nTrackers are the link between the developers and customers: the people who organize meetings and keep track of progress. You can assign one of your developers to be the tracker, as it doesnât have to be a position of its own in XP\n\nThe Developers are the people who build the product and are responsible for writing and testing code\n\nXP processes\n\nThe five main phases of XP that are iterated continuously are:\n\nPlanning: Define requirements in the form of user stories. These stories describe the desired results of each feature or product. Once user stories are created, the team gives estimates on how long each story will take to complete\n\nCoding: The actual coding performed by developers. There are three main coding standards in XP:\n\nPair programming means two programmers working together on the same code. Usually, one will focus on writing while the other focuses on reviewing the code to fix mistakes and recommend improvements\n\nContinuous integration means that XP teams commit code multiple times a day, a process known as continuous delivery\n\nCollective code ownership means that the entire team takes responsibility for the code, and everyone is allowed to review and update all code. This helps avoid code duplication and encourages frequent communication\n\nTesting: The core XP process that involves both regular automated testing and acceptance tests in which the customer verifies whether the feature or product is working according to the agreed requirements\n\nListening: Constant communication and feedback among developers, project managers, and customers to make sure that value is being delivered as planned\n\nIs extreme programming right for your team?Â\n\nExtreme Programming is primarily only used among highly experienced development teams as it's more about the process of planning what to code, coding, and reviewing the code. And since it calls for developers to write their own tests and collaborate on code all across the project, it works best for highly experienced and skilled development teams with a flat hierarchy.\n\nIn XP, group dynamics are prioritized over role distinctions and tenure. It shouldnât be important who on the team is a senior, medior, or junior developer.\n\n4. Crystal\n\nCrystal is one of the more unorthodox agile methodologies. Instead of prioritizing processes and tools, the focus is placed on the team members and their skills, personalities, and interactions.\n\nIn Crystal, every project is considered unique. Itâs up to the team members to decide how to optimize their workflow by picking the tools and processes that work best for a given project.\n\nThere is no one true Crystal method, rather it evolves to fit project characteristics like:\n\nTeam size\n\nCriticality\n\nProject priority\n\nCrystal methodologies are represented by different colors on a spectrum, for example:\n\nCrystal clear: Teams of six or fewer\n\nCrystal yellow: Between 7-20 team members\n\nCrystal orange: Between 21-40 team members\n\nCrystal red: Between 41-80 team members\n\nCrystal maroon: Between 81-200 team members\n\nTo gain a more detailed understanding of the spectrum, take a look at Alistair Cockburnâs (the âfatherâ of Crystal) article, âCrystal clear a human-powered methodology for small teams.â\n\nCrystal roles\n\nRoles in the Crystal methodology are very flexible and are assigned by the team based on the needs of each project. These are the most typical roles youâll see in the Crystal methodology:\n\nThe Executive Sponsor: The person paying for the project (often the customer)\n\nThe Ambassador User: Someone who has been involved in the project since day one and is familiar with the entire system and what needs to be delivered. They are the ones who test the final product\n\nThe Lead Designer: Like a Product Owner, the Lead Designer is familiar with software development and evaluates the projectâs progress\n\nThe Programmer: The person (or people) who are coding the project\n\nCrystal processes\n\nAs mentioned, there is no formal structure to the Crystal methodology. However, the work being performed is based on six key principles:\n\nFrequent delivery: Release and test new projects as soon as possible\n\nReflective improvement: After each delivery, reflect with your team on what can be improved in terms of tools and processes\n\nConsistent communication: Make sure that your team is constantly communicating about everything related to the project: blockers, best practices, whatâs working, and what isnât. Cockburn preaches the importance of âosmotic communicationâ: having teams in the same physical space when possible to allow information to flow between members at all times\n\nPersonal safety: Itâs important to make sure that all team members feel free to express opinions and give suggestions. Crystal prioritizes safe communication where no one is afraid to comment on the project in whatever way they feel necessary.\n\nEasy access to experts: The team should always have access to people who have expertise in whatever is being worked on and can provide guidance whenever necessary. Experts can be internal or external\n\nTechnical tooling: Crystal encourages development teams to have open conversations about the tools being used and whether they can be upgraded or altered to improve processes. Cockburn recommends continuous deployment and automated testing tools to quickly catch and fix errors\n\nIs Crystal right for your team?Â\n\nCrystal works best for teams that work on a wide variety of products and need complete flexibility to adapt to each new endeavor as needed.\n\nIn Crystal, interpersonal relationships and promoting open communication are prioritized. Cockburn also believes that Crystal works best when teams are small and work together in a single location, where they can interact in person every day.\n\nFigure out which agile methodologies work best for your team with ClickUp\n\nChoosing the right agile methodology for your team or project is far from an exact science.
