        "text": "Even the smallest of all IT projects may require several tools, reports, specialists, and various discussions. For the software to run smoothly, all the above must get managed well. Sometimes, well-managed development may become challenging, especially in predicting the difficulties that may emerge shortly. However, most organizations and companies follow Agile software development methodology to boost their software delivery and become flexible to the numerous changes. At least 60% of companies follow the methods since it quickly changes most of their priorities.\n\nAgile entails a mixture of principles and values, as described in the manifesto. The company’s primary goals are to make improvements, accept change, and develop a product as fast as possible. There are many software development methodologies, and they have their features and places to get applied.\n\nAgile methodology types\n\nEach methodology aims to utilize a different approach in organizing software development even though all their principles are aligned to meet a customer’s requirements and deliver a product with the highest quality. For instance, Scrum Utilizers sprints and Kanban has a lot of tasks that get placed on board. All the frameworks for agile are best on these principles;\n\nFocusing on the needs of a customer and note their instruments.\n\nAnything can get changed at any step of the development.\n\nDevelopers and clients mass cooperate as long as the development is on.\n\nHave the rights environment and provide all the necessary tools to come up with the project.\n\nThe above rules have popularized a jail and also encouraged other frameworks to emerge. After all, they are among the most demanded software methodologies.\n\nRoles in the agile scrum team\n\nTeam leader\n\nIn such teams, the leader assists the other team members to follow the process of their product development, which is time-tested. Therefore the team lead is focused on managing the team, providing all the necessary tools and environment for the project, and also removes any obstacle that may cause commotion along the way.\n\nMembers of the team\n\nThe team has various people, including software developers, analysts, DevOps, QA engineers, interface engineers, and designers. The whole team welcomed the project, and there the responsible people to build and release the product.\n\nProject manager\n\nAny person assigned in this role and was wrong the customer’s vision gets transferred to the team, and they also manage the backlog of the product. The project manager’s responsibility is to implement the project and deliver the product in line with the requirements as fast discussed. The project manager doesn’t manage the team as they tend to negotiate with the team leader to map progress or identify problematic areas.\n\nStakeholder\n\nThey include everybody that is either directly or indirectly involved with the product. So, for example, it may consist of people in development, sponsors, customers, and many others.\n\nAdvantages of Agile Methodology\n\nProduct of high quality\n\nThe development team breaks down the complex product into more pleasing and smaller parts, making them able to focus on collaboration and quality. That is also regular reviews and testing after every iteration, which helps the team find and fix any problems that may arise and define all the mismatches between the customer’s expectation and that product while it is still in its early stages.\n\nA high satisfaction from the customer\n\nConsumers add a part to their decision-making process, which increases their involvement with the product. In the traditional model, the customers are usually in their planning stage. Still, in agile development, they have an active role, which affects the product’s flexibility and adaptability. If you keep your customers in the loop, you will make your changes based on their feedback and get to deliver a fine product that is in line we did their requirements.\n\nGreat risk management\n\nAny product user will not purchase a product that is lagging or one that has a lot of bugs. Agile tends to focus on delivery, giving them a chance to tweak some improvements when each iteration comes to an end. The team can also fix the bugs faster, and all the potential risks can get one indeed when and on time.\n\nBetter control\n\nProject managers have got more control, especially over the development process, because their projects are always focused on the main features and based on the feedback from the customers. As a result, they ensure quality gets streamlined in the whole process, and all stakeholders get involved in the project.\n\nAccurate measurements and metrics\n\nAgile software development methodology utilizes a more specific and relevant set of metrics dress teammate the project’s performance compared to the traditional models. For example, Agile focuses on achieving outstanding results and optimizing its performance according to the user’s requirements. Agile tends to adopt essential metrics like the cycle time, leave the time, identify weak spots, and make the best decisions to make them strong.\n\nMethods of Agile software development\n\nScrum\n\nAt least 60% of companies use scrum in managing their working processes. The feature works with fixed periods known as sprints, and within this bubble, the developers tended to implement some parts of the product. It starts with planning, and it ends with delivering an already pre-established product in some way.\n\nSome of the elements of the traditional scrum are;\n\nReview\n\nIt involves the project manager demonstrating some new functionality to consumers or clients and receives their feedback.\n\nMeetings with scrum master\n\nThe sessions get done daily. All the team members come together to discuss whatever tasks they went over the previous day, whatever they’re trying to plan in doing for that particular day, and some of the obstacles they have come along the way.\n\nKanban\n\nThe future focuses on having a seamless competition of tasks without having to split them into sprints. For example, Kanban does not use backlogs of sprints because it’s the board with jobs already set to get done. It’s, therefore, possible to predict the direction that a project will take when stakeholders move their cards along their boards.\n\nExtreme programming\n\nExtreme programming begins with planning, just like all other models of Agile software development. The team considers all the needed project requirements and develops the timeframes that every task will use. Instead of having to write the codes first, the developers will go on to use the acceptance tests. The tests tend to define the work of each card according to all the requirements that have gotten given. After testing has gotten done, the two developers will develop a code and run it in the acceptance tests. They will then integrate their system after every task gets completed.\n\nFeature-driven development\n\nIt is a model based on building a complete product, and it means that you are performing features step by step and a bit by bit, receiving feedback and integrating them into the particular product to bolster them. The media’s purpose is to deliver good software that is working and make it as quick as it can within the shortest time possible.\n\nCrystal\n\nIt is probably one of the most universal and most straightforward methods of Agile software development. The group says and future strategy will get decided according to the project’s vitality and business priorities. It, therefore, tends to focus on versatility, client involvement, production delivery, and reducing distractions.\n\nThe above all depends on the project itself and also the types of framework to get used. In this line of work, there is usually no wrong or right strategy. If you have a long-term project that is rather complex, then scrum would be a better way to go. Lean development is also a better choice, especially for startups who want to build MVPs. If you have smaller projects, then you’d opt for Kanban video."
