        "text": "Agile software development is a more flexible approach than the Waterfall model’s strictly set phases. As a result, many teams are moving toward Agile’s adaptive methodology and moving away from the predictive Waterfall methodology when developing software.\n\nThe conventional Waterfall development method follows strict phases, sticking to the original requirements and design plan created at the beginning of the project. A project manager spends time negotiating milestones, features, resources, working at length in the planning stages of a project, usually developing a full-blown project plan that details how the work will be moved through many gates to completion.\n\nCustomers finalize requirements before development begins and then a lengthy development process occurs, with the project manager tracking every movement of the project through each handoff and finally on to delivery. If everything goes well, this process produces an on-time, on-budget release.\n\nBut the chief drawbacks to this approach are well-documented: it is not responsive to change and it takes a long time to deliver working software. When technology forms the field of play and drives every change, a six month (or longer) release cycle, with requirements chiseled in stone, does not meet the business need.\n\nThe history behind Agile software development is one of frustration with the traditional waterfall methodology. Agile is designed to accommodate change and the need for faster software development (as discussed in the Agile Manifesto's Values and Principles). The project leader typically facilitates the work of the development team, eliminates bottlenecks, and helps the team stay focused in order to deliver software iterations on a regular basis. It is less about milestones than it is about hours, feature selection, prioritization, and meetings.\n\nUnlike the Waterfall model, the development team ultimately decides at the beginning of a sprint (or iteration) what can be accomplished in the timeframe and sets out to build a series of features, delivering working software that can be installed in a production environment at the end of the sprint. Since Agile software development methods (such as Dynamic Systems Development Method- DSDM) are flexible, most are suitable for method tailoring – where development teams can adapt the flow to meet the needs of the product.\n\nThe Agile software development lifecycle is dominated by the iterative process. Each iteration delivers the next piece of the development puzzle: software and supporting elements (e.g. documentation) available for use by customers, until the final product is complete. Each iteration is usually two to four weeks in length and has a fixed completion time. The iteration process is methodical and the scope of each iteration is only as broad as the allotted time allows.\n\nMultiple iterations will take place during the Agile software development lifecycle and each follows its own workflow. During an iteration, customers and business stakeholders provide feedback to ensure that the features meet their needs.\n\nA typical iteration process flow can be visualized as follows:\n\nRequirements: Define the requirements for the iteration based on the product backlog, sprint backlog, and customer and stakeholder feedback.\n\nDevelopment: Design and develop software based on defined requirements.\n\nTesting: Quality assurance (QA) testing, internal and external training, documentation development.\n\nDelivery: Integrate and deliver the working iteration into production.\n\nFeedback: Review customer and stakeholder feedback and work it into the requirements of the next iteration.\n\nThe flow of work in Scrum is directed via a series of meetings, as described below:\n\nSprint planning is used to choose the work that will be incorporated into an upcoming Sprint based on the product backlog.\n\nA daily Scrum is a short meeting where each participant answers the following questions:\n\nWhat work did you do yesterday?\n\nWhat work will you do today?\n\nWhat obstacles are in your way?\n\nThe Scrum master, who manages the meetings, uses the data gathered to update the burndown chart and look for ways to remove the obstacles that were identified.\n\nA sprint review is a meeting at the end of each Sprint to evaluate what was completed and to review the product backlog and determine what still needs to be done. Reviews focus on the product.\n\nFinally, the sprint retrospective meeting at the end of each Sprint which covers what worked well and what can be improved. Retrospectives focus on the process.\n\nYou can read more about Scrum in our comprehensive guide."
