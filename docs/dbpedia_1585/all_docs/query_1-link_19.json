        "text": "What Are the Different Types of Agile Frameworks?\n\nAgile refers to the methods and best practices for organizing projects based on the values and principles documented in the Agile Manifesto. However, there’s no one right way to implement Agile, and many different types of frameworks from which to choose.\n\nIn this article, we will cover the basics of Agile methodology and explore the different frameworks.\n\nBefore we begin, you can unlock a free trial with Wrike right away and experience the full potential of Agile software.\n\nKanban\n\nKanban methodology is about day-to-day workflows and processes. It is a simple, visual means of managing projects that enables teams to see the progress so far and what’s coming up next. Kanban projects are primarily managed through a Kanban board, which segments tasks into three columns: “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done.”\n\nMany project management software solutions have Kanban board integration, which teams can use to plot out a task’s progress from start to finish.\n\nThe main benefit of this methodology is the increased transparency, allowing team leaders to clearly see which tasks are assigned to which team members and what is yet to be completed to make meaningful progress.\n\nScrum\n\nScrum is one of the most popular Agile methodologies, as it can bring teams together with a sharp focus and an efficient, collaborative approach to task execution.\n\nIt is similar to Kanban in many ways. Scrum typically uses a Scrum board, similar to a Kanban board, and groups tasks into columns based on progress. Unlike Kanban, Scrum focuses on breaking a project down into sprints and only planning and managing one sprint at a time.\n\nUnder this methodology, you would assign a Scrum leader and product owner, who have a direct influence over the rest of the team. This assigned leadership can help teams to spearhead projects and complete them over a short space of time through a series of sprints.\n\nSprints are the Scrum way of breaking projects down into iterations that can last anywhere between one and four weeks each. Bringing team members together from different departments, these sprints help you channel a collective focus to your projects.\n\nScrum also features a robust set of principles and activities that dictate how you work. These include:\n\nSprint planning: Planning sessions to identify the purpose behind your sprints\n\nRoles: Key roles in the Scrum project management process\n\nProduct backlog: A list of tasks arranged according to priority level\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) was designed for Agile software development projects. It focuses on continuous development and customer delivery and uses intervals or sprints, similar to a Scrum methodology. However, XP also has 12 supporting processes specific to the world of software development:\n\nPlanning game\n\nSmall releases\n\nCustomer acceptance tests\n\nSimple design\n\nPair programming\n\nTest-driven development\n\nRefactoring\n\nContinuous integration\n\nCollective code ownership\n\nCoding standards\n\nMetaphor\n\nSustainable pace\n\nExtreme Programming puts the customer at the center of everything the team does. In XP, teams can involve the end users in a meaningful way and use the feedback they get to deliver the best possible product.\n\nFeature-driven development (FDD)\n\nFeature-driven development is another software-specific Agile framework. This methodology involves creating software models every two weeks and requires a development and design plan for every model feature. It has more rigorous documentation requirements than XP, so it’s better for teams with advanced design and planning abilities. FDD breaks projects down into five basic activities:\n\nDevelop an overall model\n\nBuild a feature list\n\nPlan by feature\n\nDesign by feature\n\nBuild by feature\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nThe Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) was born of the need for a common industry framework for rapid software delivery. Rework is to be expected, and any development changes that occur must be reversible. Like Scrum, XP, and FDD, DSDM uses sprints. This framework is based on eight fundamental principles:\n\nFocus on the business need\n\nDeliver on time\n\nCollaborate\n\nNever compromise quality\n\nBuild incrementally from firm foundations\n\nDevelop iteratively\n\nCommunicate continuously and clearly\n\nDemonstrate control\n\nCrystal\n\nCrystal is a family of Agile methodologies that includes Crystal Clear, Crystal Yellow, Crystal Orange, Crystal Red, etc. Each has a unique framework. Your choice depends on several project factors, such as your team size, priorities, and project criticality.\n\nLean\n\nLean development is often grouped with Agile, but it’s an entirely different methodology that happens to share many of the same values. The main principles of the Lean methodology include:\n\nEliminating waste\n\nBuild quality in\n\nCreate knowledge\n\nDefer commitment\n\nDeliver fast\n\nRespect people\n\nOptimize the whole\n\nAdaptive Project Framework\n\nAdaptive Project Framework, or APF, is an Agile methodology that keeps teams on their feet, ready to adapt to changing circumstances and project scope.\n\nBy breaking each project down into iterative cycles, or phases, teams can frequently check in and evaluate what’s necessary to complete each small project. Through regular assessment, teams can react quickly to changes and ensure they stay on track with timelines.\n\nSupercharge Agile methodology with Wrike\n\nSo, now you know all about the different Agile frameworks, it’s time to select robust project management software that can help you implement them.\n\nWrike offers a range of features specifically designed to support Agile methodology. From Kanban boards to sprint planning, Wrike empowers teams to effectively implement Agile practices while maintaining visibility, transparency, and productivity.
