        "text": "Agile visionaries believed that teamwork is essential to delivering great software and that great agile teams embody \"we\" rather than âI.\" Nothing is more rewarding than sharing the adventure of building something that truly matters with engaged teammates.\n\nDespite sharing common values, there is no formula for the perfect agile team. Some implementÂ scrumÂ while others useÂ kanban. Agile purists prefer co-located teams, but business realities sometimes necessitateÂ distributingÂ an agile team across geographies. Most agile teams possess all the required skills, but sometimes it's necessary to call on specialists for specific work. So how do you know whether your team is on the path to greatness? Read on.\n\nOnce the team is in place, it's important to remember that agile teams are like individuals: they take time to grow.Â Agile theorists often quote Tuckman's \"stages of group development.â Agile teams go through four key phases as they develop.\n\nAfter a team reaches the performing stage, development truly becomes awesome. Members trust each other, understand one another's strengths, and use that understanding to optimize how they build software.\n\nThere are two other pillars of great agile teams: continuous mentoring and shared skill sets. One of the big benefits in working on a team is that colleagues learn from one another and mentor one another. Mentoring isn't just an activity for junior members to learn from senior members.Â Everyone on the team learns from one another so that the impact of the team as a whole is greater than the sum of the impact made by it's individual members.Â Meanwhile, shared skill sets unlock the power of the team to tackle heterogeneous work. As engineers, it's always important to learn new skills because it makes us more valuable to the organization and better equipped to support each other's work. It also guards against someone becoming a critical path, which takes a load offÂ everyone's mind.\n\nEach product phase is supported by three teams (ideally 5-7 members each), and forms a triad. Each triad is agile in its approach, because as the product develops, teams are continuously working on each phase and learning more about the product as well as the market. Below is a breakdown of each triad and the who, what, where, and why for each team within the larger software team.\n\nHere's the catch: reaching the 'performing' stage is impossible if a team's make-up shifts a lot.\n\nRegardless of which triad your team operates in, agile can make your team deliver faster and have more fun. Dig further into this section and learn how to focus and optimize agile teams."
