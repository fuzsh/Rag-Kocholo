        "text": "What is agile methodology in software development?\n\nAgile is now a fancy notion among team landscapes. Essentially, it is a set of principles that usher in an adaptive approach towards software development. For better perception, let’s look at the key elements of the right Agile working process and some of the philosophy that underlies this methodology.\n\nDiscover about how to build an MVP and how long it takes\n\nKey elements of the agile working process\n\nSmall teams\n\nAgile teams are deliberately kept small, mostly 7-9 committed members. Thus, this size is intentional to be able to work as a team effectively and ease of communication that targets everyone’s input.\n\nChange-driven\n\nOne of the critical features of Agile is that it welcomes change. Unlike traditional approaches, Agile encourages amendments even in a later stage of development.\n\nContinuous feedback loop\n\nAgile is not a one-way street but an ongoing dialogue. Developers get continuous input from stakeholders, end-users, and fellow team members. It helps implement changes needed very quickly for the product to fit into user needs.\n\nWhat are the values of agile development?\n\nIt was around two decades ago when the Agile Manifesto came out which summarized core principles and values of Agile philosophy. We will briefly recap them as they still hold good in agile practices now.\n\nWhy do companies choose the agile approach to software development?\n\nThe 4 decisive reasons to choose agile over anything else are:\n\nFlexibility. It gives the companies a chance to make a pivot in plans along with changing business demands and valuable client feedback. Thanks to such an approach, emerging client needs can be accommodated speedily while keeping agile in dynamic market situations.\n\nTesting. This is not just a phase in the project – it is done in every sprint. It means from day one of the product development lifecycle that it goes through several tests before store release happens. With continuous feedback, any problem or bug gets identified and resolved at an early stage.\n\nProactive product ownership. Agile is biased towards the proactive participation of product owners. Collaboration amongst all stakeholders is encouraged for a better understanding of the client’s requirements. Involving the product owner more closely into the development process helps having clear communication and alignment of project goals.\n\nBetter quality and faster results. Active participation of the product owners in the development enhances the quality of the product to a great extent. The constant availability of the product owner during the sprint period ensures that everything is kept on schedule all through. This alignment contributes to the delivery of high-quality results in a shorter time frame.\n\nTraditional project management VS agile?\n\nTwo distinct methodologies stand out: traditional and Agile project management. While both have their merits, it’s vital to understand the differences to choose the one that suits your company.\n\nTraditional project management, like Waterfall, is based on systematic planning, detailed paperwork, and the implementation of preplanned methods. It works well in a linear manner where one stage has to be achieved for the other one to begin. While this methodology presents a clear roadmap, it may face challenges in responding adequately to changes especially where the conditions of the project shift abruptly.\n\nThe most popular approaches we know are Waterfall and Scrum. We will zoom in on the methods for you so you have a clear grasp of their differences.\n\nCompared to the traditional approach, Agile has proven resilient to unexpected change. The fact is reflected in numbers: The CHAOS Report states that only 14% of traditional projects are completed on time, within scope, and within budget. The same report highlights that 44% of traditional projects fail due to changing project requirements. Not compelling enough, right?\n\nAspect Waterfall Agile Approach Linear and Sequential Focused on flexibility, teamwork, and change Phases Each phase is completed before moving on to the next A project divided into smaller, manageable units Change\n\nmanagement\n\nChallenging to make changes once a phase is completed, often requiring going back to the beginning Change is expected and embraced Project\n\nrequirements\n\nRequires well-defined and stable project requirements up front Adaptive to evolving requirements Meetings Not specific to Waterfall Collaboration and cross-functional teams\n\nHow to assemble the right Agile team?\n\nWhen we are talking about forming a team, it does not mean you have to hire the most expensive and expert team. The main point here is to correctly define what specialists you need to cover all the project development needs, so each team member has its mission and value. For instance, when you decide not to hire business analysts, you risk getting the wrong product requirements in projects. For your information, a study by the Project Management Institute proves that inadequate requirements gathering is a primary cause of project failure in 37% of cases. This can lead to prolonged and challenging development, even with a team of exceptionally skilled developers. Moreover, such a choice not only impacts the pace of software delivery but also jeopardizes meeting user needs effectively. In essence, it becomes a total drain on both time and resources.\n\nWhat are the types of agile teams?\n\nStructures of the development team\n\nIt depends on the type of cooperation with the client. The development team can work:\n\nAlongside the client’s team (if there is such)\n\nIn this case, the team is responsible for a certain amount of work, such as developing a specific functionality or feature. To achieve the best result we have a knowledge transfer to synchronize the work with the internal team.\n\nAutonomously on the contractor’s side and report to the client\n\nWhen working autonomously, here is more about the technical side of the development as all the organizational and other duties, such as sales and marketing, are on the client’s side. The development team gets clients’ demands, and Business Analysts transform them into detailed requirements for the team to develop them.\n\nWhat specialists are there in the Agile team?\n\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities of the Agile delivery team?\n\nEach member has a specific role to do within the team and each is equally vital for a successful project delivery. Here we discuss the basic agile team structure and roles and, of course, what they do on their part.\n\nProject manager. You can’t go far without a professional Project Manager when developing software. The PM is responsible for meeting each product development milestone on time, solving all the issues throughout the development process, and connecting the Product Owner with the development team.\n\nBusiness Analyst. Business Analyst translates non-technical ideas into well-written and clear technical requirements, which are transformed into a product’s features by software engineers. A strong BA expert is a must in the team as product quality directly depends on the quality of requirements that they make.\n\nTech lead. Tech lead is responsible for project tech realization and in their field of responsibility are frameworks, different tools, and programming languages\n\nDevelopers. Developers are the people who do the core job – developing the software. There are two main types of developers – front-end and back-end developers. The first one is responsible for developing the external side of the software, or in simpler words, the part users interact with directly while using the software. The second is responsible for writing code and developing the core of the software, its algorithms, and business logic.\n\nDevOps. DevOps are practical combinations and tools that are aimed to make traditional development processes faster and more efficient by removing barriers between development and operations. It fosters communication and collaboration which makes the DevOps model a great way for teams to work together.\n\nQuality Assurance Engineers. The QA team’s role is to guarantee the best final product quality through precise testing and revealing all the bugs and issues the product has. It is important to fix them as soon as possible to make them cheaper and easier.\n\nUI\\UX designers. They develop the interface design of the product, defined by requirements. It can be a menu, buttons, pages, and others.\n\nProduct owner. The product owner has to control and prioritize product requirements due to the need to reach the desired result and to take part in the development process to ensure the development of the product goes smoothly and in the right direction. Usually, the product owner is on the client’s side.\n\nThese agile team structure roles and responsibilities are fundamental. You can hire more narrow specialists – that’s up to you, but never compromise on a single link because it can affect the quality in a bad way.\n\nWhat does the typical agile development team structure look like?\n\nWhat are the must-have tools for agile teams?\n\nYou will find various management tools out there, but we recommend using these tried and tested ones that have established their reputation in the market for top-notch usability.\n\nJira. The one-stop solution for all your management needs while working with Agile is Jira by Atlassian. It is loaded will all the required functionality to edit user stories, create sprints, and monitor development through Kanban boards as well as Scrum boards.\n\nTrello. In Trello, you can create step-to-step lists and cards with a visually oriented task organization feature that ought to resonate with many Agile teams.\n\nVersionOne. Supporting Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe methodologies, VersionOne has robust Agile flexibility with features like backlog management, sprint planning, and reporting.\n\nAsana. This is a tool popular for its ability to be applied in many Agile workflows including the creation of tasks and task prioritization, allowing team members to collaborate.\n\nConfluence. It’s a collaboration documentation tool, which works well with Jira. This one helps Agile teams create and share project documentation including requirements and meeting notes.\n\nGitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket. These are some of the code collaboration platforms that help a lot in Agile development, as these help manage code, track changes made to the code and even collaborate with other people while coding.\n\nSlack. Slack is a real-time messaging application that facilitates instant messaging, and sharing files and integrates perfectly with several other tools for better interconnectivity.\n\nMiro. It is the digital whiteboard and collaboration tool that agile teams use for visualizing workflows, user-story mapping as well as remote retrospectives and planning sessions.\n\nWhat does the agile development process look like?\n\nThe agile software development life cycle consists of 6 phases. They cover the whole path from an idea to the closing phase when the project has to be closed.\n\nConcept\n\nThe first step in development is where you define the whole further development process. In the list, we have to define the scope of work, develop the main requirements of the functions and features needed to develop the product in the first place, set deadlines, define possible risks and issues that can challenge the development, and estimate approximate costs.\n\nInception\n\nThe inception phase is the software development start, where all the requirements are accurately defined.\n\nDevelopment phase (iteration)\n\nThe main part of the process starts here when the development team has tasks and aims. It takes the most time among other steps. Here is the process that conveys previously made requirements for features and functions into fully working software\n\nTesting and final product release\n\nBefore releasing the product, it is essential to conduct testing by the QA team, who will ensure that the product has no issues or bugs. In case there are bugs, the QA team will fix them. Be aware that you can not eliminate all the bugs during pre-release testing, as new bugs can emerge even after the release.\n\nMaintaining\n\nIt is a crucial phase of the product. The maintenance phase takes care of supporting software on the market, fixing bugs that emerge, upgrading the product according to user feedback, and other processes that are necessary for support.\n\nCeasing support\n\nIt is the closing phase of software where the software can not perform its purpose and satisfy customer needs. There are two ways further: completely update the software according to the new market needs and trends and closely support the product to create a new one.\n\nStages of software development and what they have to do with the team structure\n\nTypically, they are research, ideation, design, development, and iteration, but our company has a slightly different picture. There are three stages of software development at ASD Team which were designed based on our 15 years experience of working with different types of clients and project types to help both us and clients achieve more efficient results during and after the actual software development.\n\nInitiate\n\nAt this early stage, it’s all about getting to know the project inside and out. Our team dives in, asking questions, analyzing, and brainstorming potential adjustments where needed.\n\nRoles involved:\n\nStakeholders\n\nAccount Manager\n\nThe account Manager is responsible for constant communication with the client, which includes gathering information and feedback about the project and working process. It can be performed by the Project Manager as well, but it depends on who has tighter relationships with the client.\n\nThe Initiative stage includes the following activities:\n\nsetting the development environment (accounts, credentials, repositories, CodeStyle, additional tools, DevOps consultation, QA team);\n\nbacklog and board review;\n\nknowledge transfer and communication plan of transferring the information from the client’s team to ours.\n\nExecute\n\nThis stage is an important one in terms of detailed planning and further development process. It includes the following:\n\ntime required for the development testing and deployment; creating tickets and assigning them to the development team members who will be working on a certain task;\n\nWhen we reach the development stage itself, here is where the coding process starts. Along with the coding, there are:\n\nregular requirements review in the roadmap;\n\nanalysis of requirements and formalization if everything is clear for the PM, BA, and QA.\n\nOur team presents all the developed features and functions to the client at the end of each sprint. That allows us to receive feedback from the client and to clear the further steps and actions regarding the development of the software itself\n\nRoles involved:\n\nProject Manager\n\nBusiness Analyst\n\nDevelopers\n\nQA\n\nDevOps\n\nEvaluate\n\nThe evaluation stage is not a single-time performance as we are constantly gathering feedback from our development team and the client to evaluate how the working process on the project is going.\n\nAfter each sprint, commonly biweekly, there are retrospective meetings where the team discusses and shares feedback about the last sprint. It helps gather all the necessary information to improve some sprint drawbacks in the next one.\n\nMoreover, each month there is a separate meeting conducted by an Account Manager or Project Manager aimed at gathering the overall feedback directly from the client to understand if the client is satisfied with our cooperation and how we can improve our services and the whole development process.\n\nRoles involved:\n\nProject Manager or Account Manager\n\nBusiness Analyst\n\nDevelopers\n\nStakeholders\n\nQA\n\nHow to form an ideal agile team structure: step-by-step guide\n\nThe flawless agile team structure is based on healthy team practices. Some of them are:\n\nConduct a deep analysis of the project needs\n\nStart from the identification of the project’s requirements and goals. Get down to the client’s vision, user needs, and business objectives. This allows for a team structure fully attuned to the dynamics of the project through analysis.\n\nMake sure there are no skill gaps\n\nEvaluate the knowledge and skills of the development team members. Highlight any possible skill or expertise gap that might slow down project progress. Make sure that each member of the development team has such competencies to deliver their best for the project.\n\nAdjust communication within the development team\n\nAny Agile methodology points out the importance of communication. Encourage members to converse with each other to foster collaboration, information sharing, and fast decision-making. This will include daily stand-up meetings with every team member present, occasional retrospectives for analysis, and transparent documentation considering all parties involved.\n\nLet’s form your ideal Agile team?\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you might have. Our experts will be glad to assist you\n\nAnatolii Fesuik\n\nHead of Project Management\n\nSigns you have a productive Agile product development team:\n\nThe team has perfect communication\n\nGood communication is the key to success. Properly adjusted and aligned communication channels in an agile software development team are a must and a sign of a productive team.\n\nProperly divided responsibilities\n\nWell-defined responsibilities and roles make the software development process work as it has to work.\n\nThe team is autonomous\n\nA team that understands the project doesn’t need constant supervision and motivation to perform the job. The autonomous teams do their job as they know what and why should be done.\n\nLooking for a tech partner for your project?\n\nOur team has talented experts who can help you develop your product\n\nLet’s talk\n\nIn sum, we have an excellent methodology that makes the software development process flexible and adjustable to change what positively impacts the speed and quality of software development.\n\nReferences:\n\nstatista.com"
