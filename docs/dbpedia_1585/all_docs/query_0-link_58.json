        "text": "Here is a list of the top 5 types of Agile Methodology. To keep up with the rapid changes in the paradigm of technology, agile technology was born, which is portrayed to be a notable shift in project management method is contrary to the traditional “Waterfall model”!\n\nIntroduction\n\nDeveloped in 2001, the agile software development methodologies were based on the most revered agile manifesto that laid down the principles and core practices. Before understanding the agile methodologies definition, it is pertinent to know what agile is.\n\nAgile is a set of techniques followed by a team to administer a project or plan by dividing it into various stages with continuous collaboration with customers. There is constant monitoring at every phase of the software development of the project. The agile methodology’s advantages are that both the development plus testing actions are parallel and synchronized, unlike the conventional waterfall methodology.\n\nTypes\n\nKanban\n\nScrum\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nCrystal\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nFeature Driven Development (FDD)\n\nLean Software Development\n\nScaled Agile Framework (SAFe)\n\nA) Definition\n\nThe agile methodology is one of the easiest and uncomplicated routes to transform an idea and varied needs into feasible software solutions. The agile method is an iterative and incremental tactic for software design that utilizes constant planning, understanding, upgrading, team partnership, development, and delivery. The agile process is fragmented into separate models that teams work on, thereby encouraging flexibility to changes.\n\nDriven by the principles of providing value and collaborating with stakeholders, the agile methodology originates with customers defining the end uses of the final product and the kind of problems the final product attempts to address. This exercise helps in resolving and clarifying the customer’s anticipations and requirements for the project development team.\n\nAs the project commences, the designated teams start to plan and work on a complete process through planning, implementing, and appraising. As the development process is iterative, errors are resolved in the intermediate stage of the project. This process enables the final deliverable product to match the customer’s wants better.\n\nB) Types\n\nTherefore, every framework or behaviour that adapts these principles is named Agile, and, notwithstanding the different types of agile methodologies a team implements, the agile methodology benefits can be copiously apprehended only with the collaboration of all the involved parties.\n\nThe below agile methodologies list comprises famous types of agile methodology that one can opt from:\n\n1) Kanban\n\nOriginating from the Japanese language, the translation of the word ‘Kanban’ is “visual board or signboard” and is connected to the concept of “just in time”! Initially, the Kanban concept was introduced as a lean manufacturing system and slowly drove its way to agile software development teams. This method uses visual methods for developing and managing projects.\n\nProjects through Kanban are overseen with the help of the Kanban Board, which is divided into columns to depict the process flow of the software development. This helps in increasing the visibility of teams as the teams can see the progress through every stage of development and prepare for the upcoming tasks to deliver the product “just in time”!\n\nThis method requires thorough interaction and transparency to enable the team members to be equipped with the right stage of development at any time and have a cohesive flow of work at all times.\n\n2) Scrum\n\nOne of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development methodology, which is depicted by various cycles of development. Similar to Kanban, Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called ‘sprints’. The development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, thereby managing only one sprint at a time.\n\nScrum and agile methodologies focus on continuous deliverables, and thus this method lets designers adjust priorities to ensure that any incomplete or overdue sprints get more attention.\n\nScrum Team has exclusive project roles such as a scrum master and a product owner with constant communications on the daily scrum where the activities are harmonized to devise the best way to implement the sprint.\n\n3) Extreme Programming (XP)\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and feedback. It focuses on constant development and customer satisfaction. Similar to scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a team to create a productive and highly efficient environment.\n\nThe extreme Programming technique is very supportive in a situation of constant and varying demands from the customers. It motivates the developers to accept changes in the customer’s demands, even if they pop up in an advanced phase of the development process.\n\nIn Extreme Programming, the project is tested from the initial stages by collecting feedback that progresses the output of the system. This also presents a spot check to implement easily any customer requirements.\n\n4) Crystal\n\nIntroduced by Mr Alistair Cockburn, one of the monumental persons in formulating the Agile manifesto for software development, Crystal is a group of smaller agile development methodologies comprising Crystal Yellow, Crystal Clear, Crystal Red, Crystal Orange, and more. Each has its peculiar and exclusive framework that is characterized by factors such as system criticality, team size, and project priorities. Depending on the nature of the project or system criticality such as Comfort (C), Essential Money (E), Discretionary Money (D), and Life (L), the kind of crystal agile methodology is chosen.\n\nSimilar to other methodologies of Agile, Crystal also addresses prompt delivery of software, regularity, less administration with high involvement of users, and customer satisfaction. The Crystal family advocates that each system or project is inimitable and necessitates the solicitation of diverse practices, processes, and policies to achieve the best results, earning the name of the most lightweight methods of agile methodology.\n\n5) Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nTo address the need for a standard industry charter for the swift delivery of software, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) was developed. DSDM gives a comprehensive structure that is defined and modified to create a plan, execute, manage, and scale the procedure of software development. Based on a business-driven approach and eight principles, the DSDM believes that modifications to the project are always expected, and quality with timely delivery must never be negotiated.\n\n6) Feature-Driven Development (FDD)\n\nSeveral industry-recognized best practices are incorporated into this iterative, customer-centric, and incremental agile method. Its primary goal is to consistently produce working software in a timely fashion.\n\nLifecycle stages include developing an overarching model of the project; creating feature lists; planning by feature; designing by feature; and finally building by feature. Using this five-step process, large project teams will be able to move their products forward at a steady pace.\n\n7) Lean Software Development\n\nThis agile methodology is based on seven principles:\n\nDeleting what doesn’t matter- Anything that doesn’t add value is removed from the project\n\nQuality development- The discipline and control of the number of residuals created are essential to quality development\n\nKnowledge creation- The team is driven to document the entire infrastructure to preserve this value in the future\n\nDefer commitments- This point encourages the team to focus less on planning and anticipating ideas without first having a prior and complete understanding of the business requirements\n\nDelivery promptly- Providing value to the customer as quickly as possible\n\nRespecting the team- two essential points are communication and conflict management\n\nOptimize the whole- To create a flow of true value, the development sequence must be perfected enough to remove errors from the code\n\nUsing this lean methodology, development time and resources are optimized. This method is easily scalable and adaptable to projects of any size.\n\n8) Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)\n\nA set of workflow and organizational patterns for implementing agile practices at an enterprise scale is known as the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). Adopting SAFe allows you to take advantage of a framework that is relatively light while still maintaining the centralized decision-making required at the enterprise level for software development efficiency. To put it another way, SAFe takes the agile philosophy and applies it to software executives who are tasked with addressing more strategic issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nA dynamic approach is required in choosing the right agile methodology among the different types of agile methodology. The advantages and disadvantages of agile methodology must always be considered to choosing the framework for one’s business to entice talent and convey remarkable digital experiences in this aggressively competitive market.\n\nSo, have you made up your mind to make a career in Cyber Security?
