Toni Morrison (1931-2019) was an American novelist who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. Her most famous book is her 1987 novel Beloved, which has been recommended several times on Five Books. Before her death in 2019, she was the Robert F Goheen Professor in the Humanities, Emeritus, at Princeton University.
