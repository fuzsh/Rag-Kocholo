Sunday, October 7 marked 25 years since Morrison won the Nobel Prize in Literature for her expansive and phenomenal body of work. Celebrate one of the greatest living writers of our time by exploring her work at the library.\n\nAll works by Toni Morrison can be found here, but you can always get started with some of her most Beloved works (if you’ll excuse the pun):\n\nAlready read the books above? Try some lesser-known, but no less excellent options:\n\nWhile she’s best-known for her fiction, Morrison’s non-fiction works are also incredibly rich:"
