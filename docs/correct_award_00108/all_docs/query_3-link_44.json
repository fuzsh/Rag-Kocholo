Her works are taught in courses on the novel as well as in African-American literature courses, and she is a sought after commentator not only on racial issues but on American arts and culture in general. At the same time, her books regularly reach bestseller lists, and she has even appeared on the cover of Newsweek.\n\nParadoxically, Morrison attributes the breadth of her vision to the precision of her focus. Each of her novels highlights the struggles of black people to rediscover and maintain connections to their cultural history and mythology—to their “ancestors,” as she put it in an essay entitled “Rootedness: The Ancestor as Foundation.” Morrison envisions her literature of suffering and survival functioning as did the oral storytelling of the past, reminding members of the community of their heritage and defining their roles. She has fostered these ends by teaching such courses as African-American literature and techniques of fiction at various colleges and universities, as well as by using her position as a senior editor at Random House to publish other black authors such as Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones, Angela Davis, and Henry Dumas. Through her teaching and editing, therefore, as well as her own writing, she has exerted unparalleled influence in the African-American literary renaissance of the past several decades.\n\nMorrison’s early life was steeped in the black folklore, music, language, myth, and history that now richly texture her fiction. Born Chloe Anthony Wofford, she grew up during the Depression in the small steel-mill town of Lorain, Ohio, on Lake Erie. Her maternal grandparents, Ardelia and John Solomon Willis, had been sharecroppers in Alabama until they migrated north in 1912 to Kentucky, where John Solomon, a violinist, worked in a\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn Chloe Anthony Wofford, February 18, 1931, in Lorain, OH; daughter of George and Ramah (Willis) Wofford; married Harold Morrison (an architect), 1958 (divorced); children: Harold Ford, Slade Kevin.

When they discovered, however, that their daughters knew more mathematics than the one-room schoolhouse teacher, they determined that they must move again. Continuing north, they settled in Lorain.\n\nMorrison’s parents displayed the same resourcefulness, pride, and creativity that her grandparents had. Her father, George Wofford, was a shipyard welder who took such intense pride in his work that he would write his name in the side of a ship whenever he welded a perfect seam. A tireless worker, he held three jobs simultaneously for seventeen years. Morrison’s mother, Ramah Wofford, dealt diplomatically with white bill collectors, and once when the meal the family received on relief was bugridden, she wrote a long letter of protest to then-U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. George and Ramah thrilled their four children with ghost stories and nourished their pride with stories of black ingenuity. In an essay in the bicentennial issue of the New York Times titled “Rediscovering Black History,” Morrison captured one such instance: “‘Oh Mama,’ I cried, ‘everybody in the world must have had sense enough to wrap his feet.’ ‘I am telling you,’ she replied, ‘a Negro invented shoes.’” Morrison’s mother sang around the house and in the church choir, and her grandmother kept a dreambook by which she played the numbers. Not surprisingly, Morrison characteristically juxtaposes riveting realism in her novels with what she calls forms of knowledge “discredited” by the West: lore, gossip, magic, sentiment. Many critics agree that both the searing accuracy of her portrayals of black life in America and the fabulistic qualities for which her work has been praised clearly derive from Morrison’s own life experiences in a family of storytellers.\n\nInsistence on Cultural Specificity\n\nMorrison’s appetite for stories led her to read voraciously as a child and adolescent. When she entered the first grade she was the only black child in her class and the only child who could already read. Before she graduated with honors from Lorain High School, she had read widely among the great nineteenth-century Russian novels and such other European classics as Madame Bovary and the works of Jane Austen. She cites these novels as particular influences on her, justifying the cultural specificity of her own work with reference to them. These classics, Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor Susan Blake quoted heras saying, “were not written for a little black girl … but they were so magnificently done that I got them anyway—they spoke directly to me.” She expanded on this comment in an interview with Walter Clemons for Newsweek: “When I write, I don’t translate for white readers.… Dostoevski wrote for a Russian audience, but we’re able to read him. If I’m specific, and I don’t overexplain, then anyone can overhear me.”\n\nMorrison attended Howard University as an undergraduate, majoring in English and minoring in the classics. At Howard she changed her name to Toni because people consistently mispronounced Chloe. Howard disappointed her in many ways; she found the social life there shallow: “It was about getting married, buying clothes, and going to parties,” she related, as quoted by Blake. In the summers, Morrison traveled with the Howard University Players, a student-faculty repertory troupe that took plays on tour in the South. These tours, Blake suggested, “provided a geographical and historical focus for the sense of cultural identity her parents had instilled in her.”\n\nAfter graduating from Howard, Morrison spent two years at Cornell University earning a master’s degree in English. She wrote a thesis on the theme of suicide in the works of William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf, and then went on to teach English for two years at Texas Southern University. Morrison began to write when she drifted into a writers’ group after returning to Howard in 1957 to teach English. The only rule governing this group was that everyone had to bring something to read. In a conversation with fellow African-American novelist Gloria Naylor published in Southern Review, Morrison explained that when she had run out of “old junk from high school” to bring along, she wrote a short story about a little black girl who wanted blue eyes. Out of this story she developed her first novel, The Bluest Eye, a noval that Naylor credits with having inspired her to begin writing seriously.\n\nAt Howard, Morrison met and married Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architectural student. Though she speaks very little about this difficult period in her life, she has said that the marriage suffered because of cultural differences between them, and eventually it ended in divorce. In the early 1960s, Morrison returned with her two young sons, Harold Ford and Slade Kevin, to her parents’ home in Lorain. After about a year and a half, she found an editing job with a textbook subsidiary of Random House in Syracuse. It was there, each night after her children were asleep, that she returned to her short story and developed it into a novel. Though it was rejected many times, Morrison eventually found an editor who read an unfinished version of The Bluest Eye and encouraged her to complete it. In 1970, Holt, Rinehart and Winston published the novel.\n\nThe plot of The Bluest Eye is as simple as its implications are staggering. Morrison illuminates the multiple levels of victimization at work in brutally racist and sexist American society by placing at the story’s center the quietly tragic figure of Pecola Breedlove, a little black girl on the verge of adolescence, who desperately wants to be loved. Barraged on all sides—from the movies, from teachers at school, from her own family—with the message that the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned appearance of Shirley Temple is beautiful, she concludes that the reason she is ridiculed and hated is that she is black and therefore ugly. Violated over and over by other characters reacting to their own victimizations, Pecola finally retreats into insanity, believing that she is the most beloved little girl of all because she has the bluest eyes of all.\n\nThe Bluest Eye received a moderate amount of attention, for the most part appreciative. The very features of Morrison’s writing that some critics selected for praise prompted negative criticism from other reviewers, and such divergence has been a hallmark of Morrison criticism ever since. For instance, though Frankell Haskell in the New York Times Book Review objected to a “fuzziness born of flights of poetic imagery” and a lack of focus in the novel, Phyllis R. Klotman praised its “lyrical yet precise” language in Black American Literature Forum.\n\nLater in the 1960s, Morrison moved to a senior editorial position at Random House in New York City. She began to contribute articles and reviews to various journals, most notably the New York Times. At the same time she was writing her second novel, Sula, which was published in December of 1973. “I always thought of Sula,” Morrison said in an article in the Michigan Quarterly Review, “as … new world black and new world woman.’ Daring, disruptive, imaginative, modern, out-of-the-house, outlawed, unpolicing, uncontained and uncontainable.” Sula explores the life and death of a black community called The Bottom in the town of Medallion, Ohio, by focusing on the friendship from childhood between two very different women, Sula Peace and Nel Wright. Nel grows up to marry, have children, and otherwise conform to all that society and her community expects of her. Sula, on the other hand, embarks on what the narrator terms an “experimental life.” She becomes a pariah, defining by her rebellious violations the boundaries and social codes of the community: “Their conviction of Sula’s evil,” the narrator tells us, “make[s] the townspeople their best selves.” Morrison speaks of Nel and Sula as two halves of one person; the ideal, she told Bill Moyers on a segment of his PBS television show World of Ideas, would be “a Sula with some responsibilities.” Nevertheless, Morrison will not allow her readers to rest comfortably in any particular moral stance toward the events or characters in Sula: we wonder whether to admire Sula’s grandmother Eva’s bravery in allowing her leg to be cut off by a train in order to collect insurance money to feed her children, or instead to be repulsed by such self-mutilation, just as we vacillate on whether to celebrate Sula’s autonomy or to deplore her selfishness.\n\nSula garnered more attention than had The Bluest Eye and was nominated for the 1975 National Book Award in fiction. Sara Blackburn’s review in the New York Times Book Review caused a minor controversy because it suggested first that the novel lacked “the stinging immediacy” of Morrison’s nonfiction and then that “Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous recorder of the black side of provincial American life.” But Blackburn stood virtually alone in her impression that Morrison’s novel was limited by its focus on a black community. Faith Davis’s review in the Harvard Advocate was more nearly representative in its assessment that Sula has the capacity to touch all readers: “Her citizens of the Bottom jump up from the pages vital and strong because she has made us care about the pain in their lives.”\n\nAttempts to Recover Black History\n\nIn February of 1974, Random House published The Black Book, a volume complied by Middleton Harris and edited by Morrison. In “Rediscovering Black History,” Morrison explained that she hopes The Black Book, a scrapbook of three hundred years of black life in America, will enable blacks to “recognize and rescue those qualities of resistance, excellence, and integrity that were so much a part of our past and so useful to us and to the generations of blacks now growing up.” Amid the photographs, patents, newspaper clippings, advertisements, recipes, etc. that make up the book, Morrison found verification of the stories of black achievement—despite slavery, racism, and sexism—that her parents and grandparents had told her when she was growing up: “[I] felt a renewal of pride I had not felt since 1941, when my parents told me stories of blacks who had invented airplanes, electricity, and shoes.… And there it was among Spike Harris’s collection of patents: the overshoe. The airplane was also there as an airship registered in 1900 by John Pickering.” Once again, Morrison had discovered a sustaining connection between her family history and habit of storytelling, black history, and her own sense of identity.\n\nAppropriately, Morrison’s third novel, Song of Solomon, charts a similar discovery. Milkman Dead sets out on a trek down south from his home in Ohio in hopes of recovering lost family treasure. What he finds is not gold, however, but the spiritual wealth of his rich family history. For Milkman, the journey becomes not only one from ignorance to knowledge, but also from selfish materialism and immaturity to joy, love, and selfless commitment to community. Morrison casts the narrative in the familiar mythological pattern of the odyssey and specifically invokes an African-American folktale about a group of African-born slaves who rise up from the plantation and fly back home across the ocean. At the end of the novel, Milkman has clearly freed himself from the confinement of materialism and entered into the realm of possibility, but whether or not he will survive his leap into that unknown remains unresolved.\n\nSong of Solomon secured Morrison’s place as a major writer of American fiction. A critical and commercial success, it became a paperback bestseller and in 1978 won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Those critics who had reservations about the novel generally felt that Morrison failed to integrate believably the realistic with the mythic elements. Vivian Gamick wrote in the Village Voice: “At a certain point one begins to feel a manipulativeness in the book’s structure, and then to sense that the characters are moving to fulfill the requirements of that structure.” Other critics discerned, however, that in Song of Solomon Morrison extended her primary themes across a much broader spectrum of subject matter than she had previously. Song of Solomon sweeps out from one man’s quest for self-discovery to encompass his entire family history—becoming, as Claudia Tate put it in Black Women Writers at Work, “a kind of cultural epic by which black people can recall their often obscured slave heritage.” Reynolds Price summed up this evolution in the New York Times Book Review: “Here the depths of the younger work are still evident, but now they thrust outward, into wider fields, for longer intervals, encompassing many more lives.”\n\nExplores Cost of Assimilation\n\nMorrison published her fourth novel, Tar Baby, in March of 1981. It, too, made the New York Times bestseller list, and Newsweek magazine devoted its March 30th cover that year to Morrison. Like Song of Solomon, Tar Baby is a novel saturated in black folklore. It is set primarily on a tiny French West Indian island named Isle des Chevaliers, after a group of mythical African horsemen. According to the legend, these blind horsemen were imported to work as slaves but were never actually enslaved and are said to still be riding the hills. Against this mythological backdrop, Morrison stages a modern adaptation of the African-American folktale of Tar Baby and Brer Rabbit, in which a farmer devises tar baby as a lure to trap the rabbit, who has been raiding gardens. Once captured, Brer Rabbit outwits the farmer by begging not to be thrown into the briar patch, which is of course his only real haven. In Morrison’s novel, the character of Jadine parallels that of Tar Baby. Jadine, a jet-setting, Sorbonne-educated black model is the niece of Sydney and Ondine Childs, butler and cook to retired white millionaire Valerian Street. Street has financed Jadine’s education and treats her like a guest. When the handsome outlaw, Son, intrudes on the household during a visit by Jadine, hostile racial and sexual undercurrents bubbling beneath the surface of the familial relationships burst forth. Jadine and Son fall in love, but neither can adapt to the life ways of the other. Cut off from the “ancient properties” of her ancestors, Jadine cannot live with Son in the “briar patch,” which is the black community of Eloe, Florida; nor can Son adapt to the superficial materialism of Paris or New York society.\n\nA number of critics objected to the convoluted plot structure of Tar Baby, which some felt deprived the characters of credibility. Webster Schott suggested in the Washington Post Book World that the characters’ actions seem at times “determined by Morrison’s convictions, not their histories,” and in a Nation article, Brina Caplan attributed this heavy-handedness to Morrison’s decision to displace the small black communities that “nourish her mythology” with settings dominated by white culture. Nevertheless, critics agreed in the main that the book’s flaws, due primarily to the ambitiousness of her project, are outweighed by the power of Morrison’s voice and the richness of her language.\n\nSharpens Focus on the Meaning of Freedom\n\nMorrison’s characters typically yearn for freedom, which, like Jadine, they often narrowly associate with escape from the restrictions placed upon them by their membership in a visible and exploited minority. Morrison suggests that while achieving that freedom may require individual rebellion against an unjust order, it certainly demands a communal effort to confront history and to assume collective responsibility for it and for one another. In her fifth novel, Beloved, published in 1987, Morrison sharpened her focus on the question of personal freedom and the lengths to which one might justifiably go in order to secure it. More than a decade earlier, while working on The Black Book, Morrison had come across a nineteenth-century magazine clipping that became the inspiration for Beloved. According to the article, a young runaway slave woman named Margaret Garner was tracked by her owner to Cincinnati, where she had sought refuge with her freed mother-in-law. Facing imminent capture, Garner attempted to kill her four children, and in one case succeeded. All of the accounts of the tragedy remarked on the woman’s tranquility, Morrison explained in various interviews, but Garner was simply insisting that her children must not be forced to live as she had lived—as a slave.\n\nBeloved has been called Morrison’s most technically sophisticated novel to date. Using flashbacks, fragmented narration, and shifting points of view, the author explores in the story the events that have led to protagonist Sethe’s crime. Sethe lives with her surviving daughter, Denver, on the outskirts of Cincinnati in a farmhouse haunted by the tyrannical ghost of her murdered baby daughter. Paul D., a fellow slave from the Kentucky plantation to which Sethe refused to return, comes to live with them. He violently casts out the baby spirit, or so they believe, until one day a beautiful, young, memoryless stranger arrives, calling herself “Beloved.” This stranger, the embodiment of Sethe’s murdered daughter and of the collective anguish and rage of the “sixty million and more” who have suffered the tortures of slavery, eventually takes control of the household. Feeding on Sethe’s memories and explanations, Beloved nearly destroys her mother, until the community of former slave women who have ostracized Sethe and Denver since the murder join together to exorcise Beloved at last.\n\nAwards Controversy Fails to Diminish Literary Stature\n\nBeloved sparked controversy soon after its publication. Although widely regarded as Morrison’s masterpiece, it failed to win either the annual National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award. Forty-eight prominent black writers and critics—outraged over the lack of recognition afforded Morrison for her novel—signed a tribute to her achievements that was published in the New York Times Book Review on January 24, 1988. Later that year, Morrison was awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for fiction for Beloved.\n\nSelected writings\n\nThe Bluest Eye, Holt, 1970.\n\nSula, Knopf, 1973.\n\n(Editor) The Black Book (authology), Random House, 1974.\n\nSong of Solomon, Knopf, 1977.\n\nTar Baby, Knopf, 1981.\n\nDreaming Emmett (play), first produced in Albany, New York, January 4, 1986.\n\nBeloved, Knopf, 1987.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Gale, Volume 4, 1975, Volume 10, 1979, Volume 22, 1982, Volume 55, 1988.\n\nCooper-Clark, Diana, Interviews With Contemporary Novelists, St. Martin’s, 1986.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Gale, Volume 6: American Writers Since World War II, 1980, Volume 33: Afro-American Fiction Writers After 1955, 1984.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Yearbook: 1981, Gale, 1982.\n\nEvans, James H., Jr., Spiritual Empowerment in Afro-American Literature: Frederick Douglass, Rebecca Jackson, Booker T.

Not surprisingly, Morrison characteristically juxtaposes riveting realism in her novels with what she calls forms of knowledge “discredited” by the West: lore, gossip, magic, sentiment. Many critics agree that both the searing accuracy of her portrayals of black life in America and the fabulistic qualities for which her work has been praised clearly derive from Morrison’s own life experiences in a family of storytellers.\n\nMorrison’s appetite for stories led her to read voraciously as a child and adolescent. When she entered the first grade she was the only black child in her class and the only child who could already read. Before she graduated with honors from Lorain High School, she had read widely among the great Nineteenth-century Russian novels and such other European classics as Madame Bovary and the works of Jane Austen. She has cited these novels as particular influences on her, justifying the cultural specificity of her own work with reference to them. These classics, Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor Susan Blake quoted her as saying, “were not written for a little black girl ...but they were so magnificently done that I got them anyway-they spoke directly to me.” She expanded on this comment in an interview with Walter Clemons for Newsweek: ”When I write, I don’t translate for white readers....Dostoevski wrote for a Russian audience, but we’re able to read him. If I’m specific, and I don’t overexplain, then anyone can overhear me.”\n\nMorrison attended Howard University as an undergraduate, majoring in English and minoring in the classics. At Howard she changed her name to Toni because people consistently mispronounced Chloe. Howard disappointed her in many ways; she found the social life there shallow: “It was about getting married, buying clothes, and going to parties,” she related, as quoted by Blake. In the summers, Morrison traveled with the Howard University Players, a student-faculty repertory troupe that took plays on tour in the South. These tours, Blake suggested, “provided a geographical and historical focus for the sense of cultural identity her parents had instilled in her. ”\n\nAfter graduating from Howard, Morrison spent two years at Cornell University earning a master’s degree in English. She wrote a thesis on the theme of suicide in the works of William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf, and then went on to teach English for two years at Texas Southern University. Morrison began to write when she drifted into a writers’ group after returning to Howard in 1957 to teach English. The only rule governing this group was that everyone had to bring something to read. In a conversation with fellow African American novelist Gloria Naylor published in Southern Review, Morrison explained that when she had run out of “old junk from high school” to bring along, she wrote a short story about a little black girl who wanted blue eyes. Out of this story she developed her first novel, The Bluest Eye, a novel that Naylor credits with having inspired her to begin writing seriously.\n\nFound Work Editing\n\nAt Howard, Morrison met and married Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architectural student. Though she speaks very little about this difficult period in her life, she has said that the marriage suffered because of cultural differences between them, and eventually it ended in divorce. In the early 1960s, Morrison returned with her two young sons, Harold Ford and Slade Kevin, to her parents’ home in Lorain. After about a year and a half, she found an editing job with a textbook subsidiary of Random House in Syracuse. It was there, each night after her children were asleep, that she returned to her short story and developed it into a novel. Though it was rejected many times, Morrison eventually found an editor who read an unfinished version of The Bluest Eye and encouraged her to complete it. In 1970, Holt, Rinehart and Winston published the novel.\n\nThe plot of The Bluest Eye is as simple as its implications are staggering. Morrison illuminates the multiple levels of victimization at work in brutally racist and sexist American society by placing at the story’s center the quietly tragic figure of Pecola Breedlove, a little black girl on the verge of adolescence, who desperately wants to be loved. Barraged on all sides-from the movies, from teachers at school, from her own family-with the message that the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned appearance of Shirley Temple is beautiful, she concludes that the reason she is ridiculed and hated is that she is black and therefore ugly. Violated over and over by other characters reacting to their own victimizations, Pecola finally retreats into insanity, believing that she is the most beloved little girl of all because she has the bluest eyes of all.\n\nThe Bluest Eye received a moderate amount of attention, for the most part appreciative. The very features of Morrison’s writing that some critics selected for praise prompted negative criticism from other reviewers, and such divergence has been a hallmark of Morrison criticism ever since. For instance, though Frankell Haskell in the New York Times Book Review objected to a “fuzziness born of flights of poetic imagery” and a lack of focus in the novel, Phyllis R. Klotman praised its “lyrical yet precise” language in Black American Literature Forum.\n\nLater in the 1960s, Morrison moved to a senior editorial position at Random House in New York City. She began to contribute articles and reviews to various journals, most notably the New York Times. At the same time she was writing her second novel, Sula, which was published in December of 1973. “I always thought of Sula,” Morrison said in an article in the Michigan Quarterly Review,”as ...new world black and new world woman....Daring, disruptive, imaginative, modern, out-of-the-house, outlawed, unpolicing, uncontained and uncontainable.”\n\nSula explores the life and death of a black community called The Bottom in the town of Medallion, Ohio, by focusing on the friendship from childhood between two very different women, Sula Peace and Nel Wright. Nel grows up to marry, have children, and otherwise conform to all that society and her community expects of her. Sula, on the other hand, embarks on what the narrator terms an “experimental life.” She becomes a pariah, defining by her rebellious violations the boundaries and social codes of the community: “Their conviction of Sula’s evil,” the narrator tells us, “make[s] the townspeople their best selves.”\n\nMorrison speaks of Nel and Sula as two halves of one person; the ideal, she told Bill Moyers on a segment of his PBS television show World of Ideas, would be “a Sula with some responsibilities. “Nevertheless, Morrison will not allow her readers to rest comfortably in any particular moral stance toward the events or characters in Sula: we wonder whether to admire Sula’s grandmother Eva’s bravery in allowing her leg to be cut off by a train in order to collect insurance money to feed her children, or instead to be repulsed by such self-mutilation, just as we vacillate on whether to celebrate Sula’s autonomy or to deplore her selfishness.\n\nSula garnered more attention than had The Bluest Eye and was nominated for the 1975 National Book Award in fiction. Sara Blackburn’s review in the New York Times Book Review caused a minor controversy because it suggested first that the novel lacked “the stinging immediacy” of Morrison’s nonfiction and then that “Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous recorder of the black side of provincial American life.” But Blackburn stood virtually alone in her impression that Morrison’s novel was limited by its focus on a black community. Faith Davis’s review in the Harvard Advocate was more nearly representative in its assessment that Sula has the capacity to touch all readers: “Her citizens of the Bottom jump up from the pages vital and strong because she has made us care about the pain in their lives.”\n\nRecovered Black History\n\nIn February of 1974, Random House published The Black Book, a volume compiled by Middleton Harris and edited by Morrison. In “Rediscovering Black History,” Morrison explains that she hopes that The Black Book, a scrapbook of 300 years of black life in America, will enable blacks to “recognize and rescue those qualities of resistance, excellence, and integrity that were so much a part of our past and so useful to us and to the generations of blacks now growing up.” Amid the photographs, patents, newspaper clippings, advertisements, recipes, etc. that make up the book, Morrison found verification of the stories of black achievement-despite slavery, racism, and sexism-that her parents and grandparents had told her when she was growing up: “[I] felt a renewal of pride I had not felt since 1941, when my parents told me stories of blacks who had invented airplanes, electricity, and shoes....And there it was among Spike Harris’s collection of patents: the overshoe. The airplane was also there as an airship registered in 1900 by John Pickering.” Once again, Morrison had discovered a sustaining connection between her family history and habit of storytelling, black history, and her own sense of identity.\n\nAppropriately, Morrison’s third novel, Song of Solomon, charts a similar discovery. Milkman Dead sets out on a trek down south from his home in Ohio in hopes of recovering lost family treasure. What he finds is not gold, however, but the spiritual wealth of his rich family history. For Milkman, the journey becomes not only one from ignorance to knowledge, but also from selfish materialism and immaturity to joy, love, and selfless commitment to community. Morrison casts the narrative in the familiar mythological pattern of the Odyssey and specifically invokes an African American folktale about a group of African-born slaves who rise up from the plantation and fly back home across the ocean. At the end of the novel, Milkman has clearly freed himself from the confinements of materialism and entered into the realm of possibility, but whether or not he will survive his leap into that unknown remains unresolved.\n\nSong of Solomon secured Morrison’s place as a major writer of American fiction. A critical and commercial success, it became a paperback bestseller and in 1978 won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Those critics who had reservations about the novel generally felt that Morrison failed to integrate believably the realistic with the mythic elements. Vivian Gamick wrote in the Village Voice: ”At a certain point one begins to feel a manipulativeness in the book’s structure, and then to sense that the characters are moving to fulfill the requirements of that structure.” Other critics discerned, however, that in Song of Solomon Morrison extended her primary themes across a much broader spectrum of subject matter than she had previously dealt with.Song of Solomon sweeps out from one man’s quest for self-discovery to encompass his entire family history-becoming, as Claudia Tate put it in Black Women Writers at Work,”a kind of cultural epic by which black people can recall their often obscured slave heritage.” Reynolds Price summed up this evolution in the New York Times Book Review: ”Here the depths of the younger work are still evident, but now they thrust outward, into wider fields, for longer intervals, encompassing many more lives.”\n\nExplored Cost of Assimilation\n\nMorrison published her fourth novel, Tar Baby, in March of 1981. It, too, made the New York Times bestseller list, and Newsweek magazine devoted its March 30th cover that year to Morrison. Like Song of Solomon, Tar Baby is a novel saturated in black folklore. It is set primarily on a tiny French West Indian island named Isle des Chevaliers, after a group of mythical African horsemen. According to the legend, these blind horsemen were imported to work as slaves but were never actually enslaved and are said to still be riding the hills. Against this mythological backdrop, Morrison stages a modern adaptation of the African American folktale of Tar Baby and Brer Rabbit, in which a farmer devises tar baby as a lure to trap the rabbit, who has been raiding gardens. Once captured, Brer Rabbit outwits the farmer by begging not to be thrown into the briar patch, which is of course his only real haven.\n\nIn Morrison’s novel, the character of Jadine parallels that of Tar Baby. Jadine, a jet-setting, Sorbonne-educated black model is the niece of Sydney and Ondine Childs, butler and cook to retired white millionaire Valerian Street. Street has financed Jadine’s education and treats her like a guest. When the handsome outlaw Son intrudes on the household during a visit by Jadine, hostile racial and sexual undercurrents bubbling beneath the surface of the familial relationships burst forth. Jadine and Son fall in love, but neither can adapt to the life ways of the other. Cut off from the “ancient properties” of her ancestors, Jadine cannot live with Son in the “briar patch,” which is the black community of Eloe, Florida; nor can Son adapt to the superficial materialism of Paris or New York society.\n\nA number of critics objected to the convoluted plot structure of Tar Baby, which some felt deprived the characters of credibility. Webster Schott suggested in the Washington Post Book World that the characters’ actions seem at times “determined by Morrison’s convictions, not their histories,” and in a Nation article, Brina Caplan attributed this heavy-handedness to Morrison’s decision to displace the small black communities that “nourish her mythology” with settings dominated by white culture. Nevertheless, critics agreed in the main that the book’s flaws, due primarily to the ambitiousness of her project, are outweighed by the power of Morrison’s voice and the richness of her language.\n\nMorrison’s characters typically yearn for freedom, which, like Jadine, they often narrowly associate with escape from the restrictions placed upon them by their membership in a visible and exploited minority. Morrison suggests that while achieving that freedom may require individual rebellion against an unjust order, it certainly demands a communal effort to confront history and to assume collective responsibility for it and for one another. In her fifth novel, Beloved, published in 1987, Morrison sharpens her focus on the question of personal freedom and the lengths to which one might justifiably go in order to secure it.\n\nMore than a decade earlier, while working on The Black Book, Morrison had come across a Nineteenth-century magazine clipping which became the inspiration for Beloved. According to the article, a young runaway slave woman named Margaret Gamer was tracked by her owner to Cincinnati, where she had sought refuge with her freed mother-in-law. Facing imminent capture, Garner attempted to kill her four children, and in one case succeeded. All of the accounts of the tragedy remarked on the woman’s tranquility, Morrison explained in various interviews, but Garner was simply insisting that her children must not be forced to live as she had lived-as a slave.\n\nBeloved has been called Morrison’s most technically sophisticated novel to date. Using flashbacks, fragmented narration, and shifting points of view, the author explores in the story the events that have led to protagonist Sethe’s crime. Sethe lives with her surviving daughter, Denver, on the outskirts of Cincinnati in a farmhouse haunted by the tyrannical ghost of her murdered baby daughter. Paul D., a fellow slave from the Kentucky plantation to which Sethe refused to return, comes to live with them. He violently casts out the baby spirit, or so they believe, until one day a beautiful, young, memoryless stranger arrives, calling herself “Beloved.” This stranger, the embodiment of Sethe’s murdered daughter and of the collective anguish and rage of the “60 million and more” who have suffered the tortures of slavery, eventually takes control of the household. Feeding on Sethe’s memories and explanations, Beloved nearly destroys her mother, until the community of former slave women who have ostracized Sethe and Denver since the murder join together to exorcise Beloved at last.\n\nWon the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes\n\nBeloved sparked controversy soon after its publication. Although widely regarded as Morrison’s masterpiece, it failed to win either the annual National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award. 48 prominent black writers and critics-outraged over the lack of recognition afforded Morrison for her novel-signed a tribute to her achievements that was published in the New York Times Book Review on January 24, 1988. Later that year, Morrison was awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for fiction for Beloved.\n\nMorrison experienced many personal trials during the next few years, including the death of her mother. Morrison stayed busy, however; in 1992 alone, she published another novel, Jazz, as well as two nonfiction works, including a collection essays she edited. Her reward came in 1993, when it was announced that the Swedish Academy had voted her the 1993 Nobel Laureate, a distinction which included an $817,771 monetary award. In winning, the woman who “gives voice to the voiceless,” according to The Atlanta Constitution, accepted the prize as a “redemption” of the “female writer” and “black writer” categories.\n\nMorrison related her feelings of triumph during an interview with The New York Times Magazine, stating, “I felt a lot of Nwe’ excitement....I felt I represented a whole world of women who either were silenced or who had never received the imprimatur of the established literary world. “She added, “It was very important for young black people to see a black person [succeed]....Seeing me up there might encourage them to write one of those books I’m desperate to read. And that made me happy.”\n\nMorrison also hoped the prize was a signal of her luck changing. She told The New York Times Magazine,”In the two years around the Nobel, I had a lot of bad luck, a lot of serious devastations. My mother died, other things. The only thing that...was truly wonderful was the Nobel Prize. So I regard the fact that my house burned down after I won the Nobel Prize to be better than having my house burn down without having won the Nobel Prize.” Despite the loss of her personal and sentimental effects, Morrison took small comfort in the fact that her works-in-progress and other papers were saved. Rather than rebuilding her Grand View-on-Hudson, New York home, she relocated to Princeton, New Jersey, where she had been teaching since 1989. Once settled, Morrison got back to the business of writing once again.\n\nAmong other published projects, Morrison edited a book by former Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton and revealed her thoughts and observations of regarding “The Trial of the Century,” that of former football star O. J. Simpson, who was accused of killing his ex-wife and her friend. In March of 1995, Morrison delivered that year’s Charter Day address to the graduating class of her alma mater, Howard University and was bestowed an honorary doctorate by the institution. Morrison’s creative energies were sought by Atlanta’s Cultural Olympiad in April of 1995. The three-day “Olympic Gathering” featured seven other Nobel Laureates in Literature, all of whom participated in discussion panels, read from their works, and signed autographs. Later that summer she collaborated with dancer Bill T. Jones and jazz drummer Max Roach to present “Degga,” one of three dance performances commissioned for the American Visionaries series at New York City’s Lincoln Center.\n\nThe following year, Morrison received the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and was selected as the 1996 Jefferson Lecturer-one of the highest U.S. honors given for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities-by the National Endowment for the Humanities. While all of Morrison’s novels had been made available as a boxed set by Alfred A. Knopf Inc. in 1994, Song of Solomon was propelled onto the bestseller lists in 1996, after talk show host Oprah Winfrey recommended the book to her viewers. Early the following year, Winfrey invited Morrison and “four regular women who love to read” to her Chicago home for dinner. Taped for television and aired in February of 1997, the group of women enjoyed one another’s company, discussed Song of Solomon, and dined on a sumptuous meal of roasted cornish hens, autumn vegetables, and pistachio pear tarts.\n\nThe program provided further evidence that Morrison is firmly entrenched in the literary psyche of readers all over the globe. Extremely popular, the writer and educator is “greatfun-a woman of subversive jokes, gossip, and surprising bits of self revelation” who “unwinds to Court TV and soap operas,” according to The New York Times Magazine. As Morrison informed the magazine, “I would like my work to do two things: be as demanding and sophisticated as I want it to be, and at the same time be accessible in a sort of emotional way to lots of people, just like jazz.” Successful on both counts, perhaps that’s why she is so beloved.\n\nSelected writings\n\nThe Bluest Eye, Holt, 1970.\n\nSula, Knopf, 1973.\n\n(Editor)The Black Book (anthology), Random House,1974.\n\nSong of Solomon, Knopf, 1977.\n\nTar Baby, Knopf, 1981.\n\nDreaming Emmett (play), first produced in Albany, New York, January 4, 1986.\n\nBeloved, Knopf, 1987.\n\nJazz, Knopf, 1992.\n\nPlaying in the Dark: Whiteness & the Literary Imagination (lectures), Random House, 1992.\n\n(Editor)Race-ing Justice, En-Gendering Power: Essays on Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas, & the Construction of Social Reality, Pantheon, 1992.\n\nNobel Prize Speech, Knopf, 1994.\n\n(Editor) Newtown, Huey P.,To Die for the People, Writers & Readers Publishing, 1995.\n\nDancing Mind, Random House, 1996.\n\nBirth of a Nation’hood: Gaze, Script & Spectacle in the O.

Morrison books, including Jazz, Beloved, Tar Baby, Paradise, Song of Solomon and The Bluest Eye, have been adapted to audio cassette.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Nobel laureate Toni Morrison has a central role in the American literary canon, according to many critics, award committees, and readers. Her award-winning novels chronicle small-town African-American life, employing \"an artistic vision that encompasses both a private and a national heritage,\" to quote Time magazine contributor Angela Wigan. Through works such as The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, and Beloved, Morrison proves herself to be a gifted storyteller of stories in which troubled characters seek to find themselves and their cultural riches in a society that warps or impedes such essential growth. According to Charles Larson, writing in the Chicago Tribune Book World, each of Morrison's novels \"is as original as anything that has appeared in our literature in the last twenty years. The contemporaneity that unites them—the troubling persistence of racism in America—is infused with an urgency that only a black writer can have about our society.\"\n\nMorrison has also proved herself to be an able creator of children's books, working in collaboration with her son Slade Morrison. Together the two writers have produced the rhyming parable The Big Box and The Book of Mean People, a child's eye view of the world—as seen by a rabbit. They have also collaborated on a series of retellings of the tales from Aesop, titled \"Who's Got Game?\"\n\nMorrison's artistry has attracted critical acclaim as well as commercial success; Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor Susan L. Blake called the author \"an anomaly in two respects\" because \"she is a black writer who has achieved national prominence and popularity, and she is a popular writer who is taken seriously.\" Indeed, Morrison has won several of modern literature's most prestigious citations, including the 1977 National Book Critics Circle Award for Song of Solomon, the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for Beloved, and the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature, the first African American to be named a laureate. Atlantic correspondent Wilfrid Sheed noted: \"Most black writers are privy, like the rest of us, to bits and pieces of the secret, the dark side of their group experience, but Toni Morrison uniquely seems to have all the keys on her chain, like a house detective…. She [uses] the run of the whole place, from ghetto to small town to ramshackle farmhouse, to bring back a panorama of black myth and reality that [dazzles] the senses.\"\n\nAccording to Jean Strouse, writing in Newsweek, Morrison \"comes from a long line of people who did what they had to do to survive. It is their stories she tells in her novels—tales of the suffering and richness, the eloquence and tragedies of the black American experience.\" Morrison was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in Lorain, Ohio, a small industrial town near the shores of Lake Erie. New York Review of Books correspondent Darryl Pinckney described her particular community as \"close enough to the Ohio River for the people who lived [there] to feel the torpor of the South, the nostalgia for its folkways, to sense the old Underground Railroad underfoot like a hidden stream.\"\n\nTwo important aspects of Chloe Wofford's childhood—community spirit and the supernatural—inform Toni Morrison's mature writing. In a Publishers Weekly interview, Morrison suggested ways in which her community influenced her. \"There is this town which is both a support system and a hammer at the same time,\" she noted. \"Approval was not the acquisition of things; approval was given for the maturity and the dignity with which one handled oneself. Most black people in particular were, and still are, very fastidious about manners, very careful about behavior and the rules that operate within the community. The sense of organized activity, what I thought at that time was burdensome, turns out now to have within it a gift—which is, I never had to be taught how to hold a job, how to make it work, how to handle my time.\"\n\nOn several levels the pariah—a unique and sometimes eccentric individual—figures in Morrison's fictional reconstruction of black community life. \"There is always an elder there,\" she noted of her work in Black Women Writers (1950–1980): A Critical Evaluation. \"And these ancestors are not just parents, they are sort of timeless people whose relationships to the characters are benevolent, instructive, and protective, and they provide a certain kind of wisdom.\" Sometimes this figure imparts his or her wisdom from beyond the grave; from an early age Morrison absorbed the folklore and beliefs of a culture for which the supernatural holds power and portent. Strouse stated that Morrison's world, both within and outside her fiction, is \"filled with signs, visitations, ways of knowing that [reach] beyond the five senses.\"\n\nAs a student, Morrison earned money by cleaning houses; \"the normal teenage jobs were not available,\" she recalled in a New York Times Magazine profile by Claudia Dreifus. \"Housework always was.\" Some of her clients were nice; some were \"terrible,\" Morrison added. The work gave her a perspective on black-white relations that touched Morrison's later writing. As she told Dreifus, \"In [The Bluest Eye] Pauline lived in this dump and hated everything in it. And then she worked for the Fishers, who had this beautiful house, and she loved it. She got a lot of respect as their maid that she didn't get anywhere else.\" While never explicitly auto-biographical, Morrison's fictions draw upon her youthful experiences in Ohio. In an essay for Black Women Writers at Work she claimed: \"I am from the Midwest so I have a special affection for it. My beginnings are always there…. No matter what I write, I begin there…. It's the matrix for me…. Ohio also offers an escape from stereotyped black settings. It is neither plantation nor ghetto.\"\n\nAfter graduating with honors from high school, Morrison attended Howard University, where she earned a degree in English. During this time, she also decided to change her first name to Toni. Morrison then earned a master's degree in English literature from Cornell. During this period, Morrison met and married her husband, an architect with whom she had two sons. In 1955, Morrison became an English instructor at Texas Southern University. Two years later, she returned to Howard University, teaching English until 1964. It was during her stint at Howard that Morrison first began to write. When her marriage ended in 1964, Morrison moved to New York, where she supported herself and her sons by working as a book editor at Random House. Morrison held this position until 1985, during which time she influenced several prominent black writers.\n\nMorrison's own writing career took off in the late 1960s, and several themes and influences were in early evidence. \"It seems somehow both constricting and inadequate to describe Toni Morrison as the country's preeminent black novelist, since in both gifts and accomplishments she transcends categorization,\" wrote Jonathan Yardley in the Washington Post Book World, \"yet the characterization is inescapable not merely because it is true but because the very nature of Morrison's work dictates it. Not merely has black American life been the central preoccupation of her … novels … but as she has matured she has concentrated on distilling all of black experience into her books; quite purposefully, it seems, she is striving not for the particular but for the universal.\" In her work, critics claim, Morrison strives to lay bare the injustice inherent in the black condition and blacks' efforts, individually and collectively, to transcend society's unjust boundaries. Blake noted that Morrison's novels explore \"the difference between black humanity and white cultural values. This opposition produces the negative theme of the seduction and betrayal of black people by white culture … and the positive theme of the quest for cultural identity.\" Newsweek contributor Strouse observed: \"Like all the best stories, [Morrison's] are driven by an abiding moral vision. Implicit in all her characters' grapplings with who they are is a large sense of human nature and love—and a reach for understanding of something larger than the moment.\"\n\nQuest for self is a motivating and organizing device in Morrison's fiction, as is the role of family and community in nurturing or challenging the individual. In the Times Literary Supplement, Jennifer Uglow suggested that Morrison's novels \"explore in particular the process of growing up black, female and poor. Avoiding generalities, Toni Morrison concentrates on the relation between the pressures of the community, patterns established within families,… and the developing sense of self.\" According to Dorothy H. Lee in Black Women Writers (1950–1980), Morrison is preoccupied \"with the effect of the community on the individual's achievement and retention of an integrated, acceptable self. In treating this subject, she draws recurrently on myth and legend for story pattern and characters, returning repeatedly to the theory of quest…. The goals her characters seek to achieve are similar in their deepest implications, and yet the degree to which they attain them varies radically because each novel is cast in unique human terms.\" In Morrison's books, blacks must confront the notion that all understanding is accompanied by pain, just as all comprehension of national history must include the humiliations of slavery. She tempers this hard lesson by preserving \"the richness of communal life against an outer world that denies its value\" and by turning to \"a heritage of folklore, not only to disclose patterns of living but also to close wounds,\" in the words of Nation contributor Brina Caplan.\n\nAlthough Morrison herself told the Chicago Tribune that there is \"epiphany and triumph\" in every book she writes, some critics find her work nihilistic and her vision bleak. \"The picture given by … Morrison of the plight of the decent, aspiring individual in the black family and community is more painful than the gloomiest impressions encouraged by either stereotype or sociology,\" observed Diane Johnson in the New York Review of Books. Johnson continued, \"Undoubtedly white society is the ultimate oppressor, and not just of blacks, but, as Morrison [shows],… the black person must first deal with the oppressor in the next room, or in the same bed, or no farther away than across the street.\"\n\nMorrison is a pioneer in the depiction of the hurt inflicted by blacks on blacks; for instance, her characters rarely achieve harmonious relationships but are instead divided by futurelessness and the anguish of stifled existence. Uglow wrote: \"We have become attuned to novels … which locate oppression in the conflicts of blacks (usually men) trying to make it in a white world. By concentrating on the sense of violation experienced within black neighborhoods, even within families, Toni Morrison deprives us of stock responses and creates a more demanding and uncomfortable literature.\" Village Voice correspondent Vivian Gornick contended that the world Morrison creates \"is thick with an atmosphere through which her characters move slowly, in pain, ignorance, and hunger. And to a very large degree Morrison has the compelling ability to make one believe that all of us (Morrison, the characters, the reader) are penetrating that dark and hurtful terrain—the feel of a human life—simultaneously.\" Uglow concluded that even the laughter of Morrison's characters \"disguises pain, deprivation and violation. It is laughter at a series of bad, cruel jokes…. Nothing is what it seems; no appearance, no relationship can be trusted to endure.\"\n\nOther critics detect a deeper undercurrent to Morrison's work that contains just the sort of epiphany for which she strives. \"From book to book, Morrison's larger project grows clear,\" remarked Ann Snitow in the Voice Literary Supplement. \"First, she insists that every character bear the weight of responsibility for his or her own life. After she's measured out each one's private pain, she adds on to that the shared burden of what the whites did. Then, at last, she tries to find the place where her stories can lighten her readers' load, lift them up from their own and others' guilt, carry them to glory…. Her characters suffer—from their own limitations and the world's—but their inner life miraculously expands beyond the narrow law of cause and effect.\" Harvard Advocate essayist Faith Davis wrote that despite the mundane boundaries of Morrison's characters' lives, the author \"illuminates the complexity of their attitudes toward life. Having reached a quiet and extensive understanding of their situation, they can endure life's calamities…. Morrison never allows us to become indifferent to these people…. Her citizens … jump up from the pages vital and strong because she has made us care about the pain in their lives.\" In Ms., Margo Jefferson concluded that Morrison's books \"are filled with loss—lost friendship, lost love, lost customs, lost possibilities. And yet there is so much life in the smallest acts and gestures … that they are as much celebrations as elegies.\"\n\nMorrison sees language as an expression of black experience, and her novels are characterized by vivid narration and dialogue. Village Voice essayist Susan Lydon observed that the author \"works her magic charm above all with a love of language. Her soaring … style carries you like a river, sweeping doubt and disbelief away, and it is only gradually that one realizes her deadly serious intent.\" In the Spectator, Caroline Moorehead likewise noted that Morrison \"writes energetically and richly, using words in a way very much her own. The effect is one of exoticism, an exciting curiousness in the language, a balanced sense of the possible that stops, always, short of the absurd.\"\n\nAlthough Morrison does not like to be called a poetic writer, critics often comment on the lyrical quality of her prose. \"Morrison's style has always moved fluidly between tough-minded realism and lyric descriptive-ness,\" said Newsweek contributor Margo Jefferson. \"Vivid dialogue, capturing the drama and extravagance of black speech, gives way to an impressionistic evocation of physical pain or an ironic, essay-like analysis of the varieties of religious hypocrisy.\" Uglow wrote: \"The word 'elegant' is often applied to Toni Morrison's writing; it employs sophisticated narrative devices, shifting perspectives and resonant images and displays an obvious delight in the potential of language.\" Nation contributor Earl Frederick concluded that Morrison, \"with an ear as sharp as glass … has listened to the music of black talk and deftly uses it as the palette knife to create black lives and to provide some of the best fictional dialogue around today.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Morrison completed her first novel, The Bluest Eye. Although she had trouble getting the book into print—the manuscript was rejected several times—it was finally published in 1969. At age thirty-eight, Morrison was a published author, and her debut, set in Morrison's hometown of Lorain, Ohio, portrays \"in poignant terms the tragic condition of blacks in a racist America,\" to quote Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi in Critique. In The Bluest Eye, Morrison depicts the onset of black self-hatred as occasioned by white-American ideals such as \"Dick and Jane\" primers and Shirley Temple movies. The principal character, Pecola Breedlove, is literally maddened by the disparity between her existence and the pictures of beauty and gentility disseminated by the dominant white culture. As Phyllis R. Klotman noted in the Black American Literature Forum, Morrison \"uses the contrast between Shirley Temple and Pecola … to underscore the irony of black experience. Whether one learns acceptability from the formal educational experience or from cultural symbols, the effect is the same: self-hatred.\" Darwin T. Turner elaborated on the novel's intentions in Black Women Writers (1950–1980). Morrison's fictional milieu, wrote Turner, is \"a world of grotesques—individuals whose psyches have been deformed by their efforts to assume false identities, their failures to achieve meaningful identities, or simply their inability to retain and communicate love.\"\n\nBlake characterized The Bluest Eye as a novel of initiation, exploring that common theme in American literature from a minority viewpoint. Ogunyemi contended that, in essence, Morrison presents \"old problems in a fresh language and with a fresh perspective. A central force of the work derives from her power to draw vignettes and her ability to portray emotions, seeing the world through the eyes of adolescent girls.\" Klotman, who called the book \"a novel of growing up, of growing up young and black and female in America,\" concluded her review with the comment that the \"rite of passage, initiating the young into womanhood at first tenuous and uncertain, is sensitively depicted…. The Bluest Eye is an extraordinarily passionate yet gentle work, the language lyrical yet precise—it is a novel for all seasons.\"\n\nThe 1994 reissue of The Bluest Eye prompted a new set of appraisals. In an African American Review piece, Allen Alexander found that religious references—from both Western and African sources—\"abound\" in the novel's pages. \"And of the many fascinating religious references,\" Alexander continued, \"the most complex … are her representations of and allusions to God. In Morrison's fictional world, God's characteristics are not limited to those represented by the traditional Western notion of the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Ghost.\" Instead, Morrison presents God as having \"a fourth face, one that is an explanation for all those things—the existence of evil, the suffering of the innocent and just—that seem so inexplicable in the face of a religious tradition that preaches the omnipotence of a benevolent God.\" Cat Moses used the forum of African American Review to contribute an essay outlining the blues aesthetic in The Bluest Eye. The narrative's structure, Moses wrote, \"follows a pattern common to traditional blues lyrics: a movement from an initial emphasis on loss to a concluding suggestion of resolution of grief through motion.\" In depicting the transition from loss to \"movin' on,\" said the essayist, The Bluest Eye \"contains an abundance of cultural wisdom.\"\n\nIn 1973's Sula, Morrison once again presents a pair of black women who must come to terms with their lives. Set in a Midwestern black community called The Bottom, the story follows two friends, Sula and Nel, from childhood to old age and death. Snitow claimed that through Sula, Morrison discovered \"a way to offer her people an insight and sense of recovered self so dignified and glowing that no worldly pain could dull the final light.\" Indeed, Sula is a tale of rebel and conformist in which the conformity is dictated by the solid inhabitants of The Bottom and even the rebellion gains strength from the community's disapproval. New York Times Book Review contributor Sara Blackburn contended, however, that the book is \"too vital and rich\" to be consigned to the category of allegory. Morrison's \"extravagantly beautiful, doomed characters are locked in a world where hope for the future is a foreign commodity, yet they are enormously, achingly alive,\" wrote Blackburn. \"And this book about them—and about how their beauty is drained back and frozen—is a howl of love and rage, playful and funny as well as hard and bitter.\" In the words of American Literature essayist Jane S. Bakerman, Morrison \"uses the maturation story of Sula and Nel as the core of a host of other stories, but it is the chief unification device for the novel and achieves its own unity, again, through the clever manipulation of the themes of sex, race, and love. Morrison has undertaken a … difficult task in Sula. Unquestionably, she has succeeded.\"\n\nOther critics have echoed Bakerman's sentiments about Sula. Yardley stated: \"What gives this terse, imaginative novel its genuine distinction is the quality of Toni Morrison's prose. Sula is admirable enough as a study of its title character,… but its real strength lies in Morrison's writing, which at times has the resonance of poetry and is precise, vivid and controlled throughout.\" Turner also claimed that in Sula \"Morrison evokes her verbal magic occasionally by lyric descriptions that carry the reader deep into the soul of the character…. Equally effective, however, is her art of narrating action in a lean prose that uses adjectives cautiously while creating memorable vivid images.\" In her review, Davis concluded that a \"beautiful and haunting atmosphere emerges out of the wreck of these folks' lives, a quality that is absolutely convincing and absolutely precise.\" Sula was nominated for a National Book Award in 1974.\n\nFrom the insular lives she depicted in her first two novels, Morrison moved in Song of Solomon to a national and historical perspective on black American life. \"Here the depths of the younger work are still evident,\" said Reynolds Price in the New York Times Book Review, \"but now they thrust outward, into wider fields, for longer intervals, encompassing many more lives. The result is a long prose tale that surveys nearly a century of American history as it impinges upon a single family.\" With an intermixture of the fantastic and the realistic, Song of Solomon relates the journey of a character named Milkman Dead into an understanding of his family heritage and hence, himself. Lee wrote: \"Figuratively, [Milkman] travels from innocence to awareness, i.e., from ignorance of origins, heritage, identity, and communal responsibility to knowledge and acceptance. He moves from selfish and materialistic dilettantism to an understanding of brotherhood. With his release of personal ego, he is able to find a place in the whole. There is, then, a universal—indeed mythic—pattern here. He journeys from spiritual death to rebirth, a direction symbolized by his discovery of the secret power of flight. Mythically, liberation and transcendence follow the discovery of self.\" Blake suggested that the connection Milkman discovers with his family's past helps him to connect meaningfully with his contemporaries; Song of Solomon, Blake noted, \"dramatizes dialectical approaches to the challenges of black life.\" According to Anne Z. Mickelson in Reaching Out: Sensitivity and Order in Recent American Fiction by Women, history itself \"becomes a choral symphony to Milkman, in which each individual voice has a chance to speak and contribute to his growing sense of well-being.\"\n\nMickelson also observed that Song of Solomon represents for blacks \"a break out of the confining life into the realm of possibility.\" Charles Larson commented on this theme in a Washington Post Book World review. The novel's subject matter, Larson explained, is \"the origins of black consciousness in America, and the individual's relationship to that heritage.\" However, Larson added, \"skilled writer that she is, Morrison has transcended this theme so that the reader rarely feels that this is simply another novel about ethnic identity. So marvelously orchestrated is Morrison's narrative that it not only excels on all of its respective levels, not only works for all of its interlocking components, but also—in the end—says something about life (and death) for all of us. Milkman's epic journey … is a profound examination of the individual's understanding of, and, perhaps, even transcendence of the inevitable fate of his life.\" Gornick concluded: \"There are so many individual moments of power and beauty in Song of Solomon that, ultimately, one closes the book warmed through by the richness of its sympathy, and by its breathtaking feel for the nature of sexual sorrow.\"\n\nSong of Solomon, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1977, was also the first novel by a black writer to become a Book-of-the-Month Club selection since Richard Wright's Native Son was published in 1940. World Literature Today reviewer Richard K. Barksdale called the work \"a book that will not only withstand the test of time but endure a second and third reading by those conscientious readers who love a well-wrought piece of fiction.\" Describing the novel as \"a stunningly beautiful book\" in her Washington Post Book World piece, Anne Tyler added: \"I would call the book poetry, but that would seem to be denying its considerable power as a story. Whatever name you give it, it's full of magnificent people, each of them complex and multilayered, even the narrowest of them narrow in extravagant ways.\" Price deemed Song of Solomon \"a long story,… and better than good. Toni Morrison has earned attention and praise. Few Americans know, and can say, more than she has in this wise and spacious novel.\"\n\nMorrison clearly attained the respect of the literary community, but even in the face of three well-received novels, she did not call herself a writer. \"I think, at bottom, I simply was not prepared to do the adult thing, which in those days would be associated with the male thing, which was to say, 'I'm a writer,'\" she told Dreifus in 1994. \"I said, 'I am a mother who writes,' or 'I am an editor who writes.' The word 'writer' was hard for me to say because that's what you put on your income-tax form. I do now say, 'I'm a writer.' But it's the difference between identifying one's work and being the person who does the work. I've always been the latter.\"\n\nStill, critics and readers had no doubt that Morrison was a writer. Her 1981 book Tar Baby remained on bestseller lists for four months. A novel of ideas, the work dramatizes the fact that complexion is a far more subtle issue than the simple polarization of black and white. Set on a lush Caribbean Island, Tar Baby explores the passionate love affair of Jadine, a Sorbonne-educated black model, and Son, a handsome knockabout with a strong aversion to white culture. According to Caplan, Morrison's concerns \"are race, class, culture and the effects of late capitalism—heavy freight for any narrative…. She is attempting to stabilize complex visions of society—that is, to examine competitive ideas…. Because the primary function of Morrison's characters is to voice representative opinions, they arrive on stage vocal and highly conscious, their histories symbolically indicated or merely sketched. Her brief sketches, however, are clearly the work of an artist who can, when she chooses, model the mind in depth and detail.\" In a Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook essay, Elizabeth B. House outlined Tar Baby's major themes: \"the difficulty of settling conflicting claims between one's past and present and the destruction which abuse of power can bring. As Morrison examines these problems in Tar Baby, she suggests no easy way to understand what one's link to a heritage should be, nor does she offer infallible methods for dealing with power. Rather, with an astonishing insight and grace, she demonstrates the pervasiveness of such dilemmas and the degree to which they affect human beings, both black and white.\"\n\nTar Baby uncovers racial and sexual conflicts without offering solutions, but most critics found that Morrison indicts all of her characters—black and white—for their thoughtless devaluations of others. New York Times Book Review correspondent John Irving claimed: \"What's so powerful, and subtle, about Miss Morrison's presentation of the tension between blacks and whites is that she conveys it almost entirely through the suspicions and prejudices of her black characters…. Miss Morrison uncovers all the stereotypical racial fears felt by whites and blacks alike. Like any ambitious writer, she's unafraid to employ these stereotypes—she embraces the representative qualities of her characters without embarrassment, then proceeds to make them individuals too.\" New Yorker essayist Susan Lardner praised Morrison for her \"power to be absolutely persuasive against her own preferences, suspicions, and convictions, implied or plainly expressed,\" and Strouse likewise contended that the author \"has produced that rare commodity, a truly public novel about the condition of society, examining the relations between blacks and whites, men and women, civilization and nature…. It wraps its messages in a highly potent love story.\" Irving suggested that Morrison's greatest accomplishment \"is that she has raised her novel above the social realism that too many black novels and women's novels are trapped in. She has succeeded in writing about race and women symbolically.\"\n\nReviewers praised Tar Baby for its provocative themes and for its evocative narration. Los Angeles Times contributor Elaine Kendall called the book \"an intricate and sophisticated novel, moving from a realistic and orderly beginning to a mystical and ambiguous end. Morrison has taken classically simple story elements and realigned them so artfully that we perceive the old pattern in a startlingly different way. Although this territory has been explored by dozens of novelists, Morrison depicts it with such vitality that it seems newly discovered.\" In the Washington Post Book World, Webster Schott claimed: \"There is so much that is good, sometimes dazzling, about Tar Baby—poetic language,… arresting images, fierce intelligence—that … one becomes entranced by Toni Morrison's story. The settings are so vivid the characters must be alive. The emotions they feel are so intense they must be real people.\" Maureen Howard stated in New Republic that the work \"is as carefully patterned as a well-written poem…. Tar Baby is a good American novel in which we can discern a new lightness and brilliance in Toni Morrison's enchantment with language and in her curiously polyphonic stories that echo life.\" Schott concluded: \"One of fiction's pleasures is to have your mind scratched and your intellectual habits challenged. While Tar Baby has shortcomings, lack of provocation isn't one of them. Morrison owns a powerful intelligence. It's run by courage. She calls to account conventional wisdom and accepted attitude at nearly every turn.\"\n\nIn addition to her own writing, Morrison during this period helped to publish the work of other noted black Americans, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayle Jones, Angela Davis, and Muhammad Ali. Discussing her aims as an editor in a quotation printed in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Morrison said, \"I look very hard for black fiction because I want to participate in developing a canon of black work. We've had the first rush of black entertainment, where blacks were writing for whites, and whites were encouraging this kind of self-flagellation. Now we can get down to the craft of writing, where black people are talking to black people.\" One of Morrison's important projects for Random House was The Black Book, an anthology of items that illustrate the history of black Americans. Ms. magazine correspondent Dorothy Eugenia Robinson described the work: \"The Black Book is the pain and pride of rediscovering the collective black experience. It is finding the essence of ourselves and holding on. The Black Book is a kind of scrapbook of patiently assembled samplings of black history and culture. What has evolved is a pictorial folk journey of black people, places, events, handcrafts, inventions, songs, and folklore…. The Black Book informs, disturbs, maybe even shocks. It unsettles complacency and demands confrontation with raw reality. It is by no means an easy book to experience, but it's a necessary one.\"\n\nWhile preparing The Black Book for publication, Morrison uncovered the true and shocking story of a runaway slave who, at the point of recapture, murdered her infant child so it would not be doomed to a lifetime of servitude. For Morrison, the story encapsulated the fierce psychic cruelty of an institutionalized system that sought to destroy the basic emotional bonds between men and women, and worse, between parent and child. \"I certainly thought I knew as much about slavery as anybody,\" Morrison told an interview for the Los Angeles Times. \"But it was the interior life I needed to find out about.\" It is this \"interior life\" in the throes of slavery that constitutes the theme of Morrison's novel Beloved. Set in Reconstruction-era Cincinnati, the book centers on characters who struggle fruitlessly to keep their painful recollections of the past at bay. They are haunted, both physically and spiritually, by the legacies slavery has bequeathed to them. According to Snitow, Beloved \"staggers under the terror of its material—as so much holocaust writing does and must.\"\n\nWhile the book was not unanimously praised—New Republic writer Stanley Crouch cited the author for \"almost always [losing] control\" and of not resisting \"the temptation of the trite or the sentimental\"—many critics considered Beloved to be Morrison's masterpiece. In People, V. R. Peterson described the novel as \"a brutally powerful, mesmerizing story about the inescapable, excruciating legacy of slavery. Behind each new event and each new character lies another event and another story until finally the reader meets a community of proud, daring people, inextricably bound by culture and experience.\" Through the lives of exslaves Sethe and her would-be lover Paul D, readers \"experience American slavery as it was lived by those who were its objects of exchange, both at its best—which wasn't very good—and at its worst, which was as bad as can be imagined,\" wrote Margaret Atwood in the New York Times Book Review. \"Above all, it is seen as one of the most viciously antifamily institutions human beings have ever devised. The slaves are motherless, fatherless, deprived of their mates, their children, their kin. It is a world in which people suddenly vanish and are never seen again, not through accident or covert operation or terrorism, but as a matter of everyday legal policy.\" New York Times columnist Michiko Kakutani contended that Beloved \"possesses the heightened power and resonance of myth—its characters, like those in opera or Greek drama, seem larger than life and their actions, too, tend to strike us as enactments of ancient rituals and passions. To describe Beloved only in these terms, however, is to diminish its immediacy, for the novel also remains precisely grounded in American reality—the reality of Black history as experienced in the wake of the Civil War.\"\n\nBeloved may be an American novel, but its images and influences come from the British Romantic tradition, theorized Martin Bidney in Papers on Language and Literature. \"Simply to list a few of [the book's] major episodes—ice skating, boat stealing, gigantic shadow, carnival 'freak' show, water-voices sounding the depths—is almost to create a rapidly scrolled plot synopsis of Wordsworth's Prelude,\" Bidney wrote. \"When Baby Suggs declares that the only grace we will receive is the grace we can 'imagine,' or when Sethe tells how Paul D's visionary capacity makes 'windows' suddenly have 'view,' we hear the voice of William Blake.\" The critic also saw traces of Keats in the scenes of Paul D's musings \"on the superiority of imagined love to mere physical sex.\" But the achievement of the novel ultimately belongs to Morrison, Bidney added: \"These few examples are by no means a complete listing of all the Romantic allusive motifs that combined to help make Beloved the visionary masterwork it is.\"\n\nAcclaim for Beloved came from both sides of the Atlantic. In his Chicago Tribune piece, Larson claimed that the work \"is the context out of which all of Morrison's earlier novels were written. In her darkest and most probing novel, Toni Morrison has demonstrated once again the stunning powers that place her in the first ranks of our living novelists.\" Los Angeles Times Book Review contributor John Leonard likewise expressed the opinion that the novel \"belongs on the highest shelf of American literature, even if half a dozen canonized white boys have to be elbowed off…. Without Beloved our imagination of the nation's self has a hole in it big enough to die from.\" Atwood stated: \"Ms. Morrison's versatility and technical and emotional range appear to know no bounds. If there were any doubts about her stature as a pre-eminent American novelist, of her own or any other generation, Beloved will put them to rest.\" London Times reviewer Nicholas Shakespeare concluded that Beloved \"is a novel propelled by the cadences of … songs—the first singing of a people hardened by their suffering, people who have been hanged and whipped and mortgaged at the hands of white people—the men without skin. From Toni Morrison's pen it is a sound that breaks the back of words, making Beloved a great novel.\"\n\nBut for all its acclaim, Beloved became the object of controversy when the novel failed to win either the 1987 National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award. In response, forty-eight prominent African-American authors—including Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, and John Wideman—signed a letter to the editor that appeared in the January 24, 1988, edition of the New York Times. The letter expressed the signers' dismay at the \"oversight and harmful whimsy\" that resulted in the lack of recognition for Beloved. The \"legitimate need for our own critical voice in relation to our own literature can no longer be denied,\" declared Morrison's peers. The authors concluded their letter with a tribute to Morrison: \"For all of America, for all of American letters, you have advanced the moral and artistic standards by which we must measure the daring and the love of our national imagination and our collective intelligence as a people.\" The letter sparked fierce debate within the New York literary community, \"with some critics accusing the authors of the letter of racist manipulation,\" according to an entry in Newsmakers 1988. Beloved ended up winning the Pulitzer Prize for 1988.\n\nMorrison's subsequent novel, Jazz, is \"a fictive recreation of two parallel narratives set during major historical events in African-American history—Reconstruction and the Jazz Age,\" noted Dictionary of Literary Biography writer Denise Heinze. Set primarily in New York City during the 1920s, the novel's main narrative involves a love triangle between Violet, a middle-aged woman; Joe, her husband; and Dorcas, Joe's teenage mistress. When Dorcas snubs Joe for a younger lover, Joe shoots and kills Dorcas. Violet seeks to understand the dead girl by befriending Dorcas's aunt, Alice Manfred. Simultaneously, Morrison relates the story of Joe and Violet's parents and grandparents. In telling these stories, Morrison touches on a number of themes: \"male/female passion,\" as Heinze com-mented; the movement of blacks into large urban areas after Reconstruction; and, as is usually the case with her novels, the effects of racism and history on the African-American community. Morrison also makes use of an unusual storytelling device: an unnamed, intrusive, and unreliable narrator.\n\n\"The standard set by the brilliance and intensi"
