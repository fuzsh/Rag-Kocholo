        "text": "[beloved's] failure to win the National Book Award sparked a protest by 48 black writers and critics, who signed a statement published in The New York Times Book Review lamenting the fact that Ms. Morrison had been overlooked for the award and had not yet received a Pulitzer Prize. Shortly afterward, Ms. Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for \"Beloved.\" In a 2006 New York Times survey of prominent writers, \"Beloved\" was chosen the best work of American fiction of the previous 25 years. Read full article from the NY Times\n\nJune Jordan Houston A. Baker Jr. STATEMENT\n\nDespite the international stature of Toni Morrison, she has yet to receive the national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve: she has yet to receive the keystone honors of the National Book Award or the Pulitzer Prize. We, the undersigned black critics and black writers, here assert ourselves against such oversight and harmful whimsy.\n\nThe legitimate need for our own critical voice in relation to our own literature can no longer be denied. We, therefore, urgently affirm our rightful and positive authority in the realm of American letters and, in this prideful context, we do raise this tribute to the author of ''The Bluest Eye,'' ''Sula,'' ''Song of Solomon,'' ''Tar Baby'' and ''Beloved'':\n\nAlive, we write this testament of thanks to you, dear Toni: alive, beloved and persevering, magical. Among the fecund intimacies of our hidden past, and among the coming days of dream or nightmares that will follow from the bidden knowledge of our conscious heart, we find your life work ever building to a monument of vision and discovery and trust. You have never turned away the searching eye, the listening ear attuned to horror or to histories providing for our faith. And freely you have given to us every word that you have found important to the forward movement of our literature, our life. For all of America, for all of American letters, you have advanced the moral and artistic standards by which we must measure the daring and the love of our national imagination and our collective intelligence as a people.\n\nYour gifts to us have changed and made more gentle our real time together. And so we write, here, hoping not to delay, not to arrive, in any way, late with this, our simple tribute to the seismic character and beauty of your writing. And, furthermore, in grateful wonder at the advent of ''Beloved,'' your most recent gift to our community, our country, our conscience, our courage flourishing as it grows, we here record our pride, our respect and our appreciation for the treasury of your findings and invention.\n\nRobert Allen, Maya Angelou, Houston A.

Williams, Sherley Anne Williams.-\n\nHey Milton, it was mentioned in a related in the Times article that Jimmy Baldwin, for example, never received any of these awards and today he is recognized as one of America's most important writers. Obviously his importance to the Black community is even more significant.\n\nDo you think Baldwin's prose would have been more on target if he'd won a Pulitzer? Do you think winning a National Book Award would have validated his work or given it more credibility?\n\nGiven Baldwin's life long commitment and output we can assume with a great deal of certainty that he did not write for the purpose of being given a trophy or a medal. I doubt most serious writers write for this reason.\n\nYou raise a great point: \"Awards have a commercial benefit\". The financial benefit accrues not just to the recipient.\n\nJesmyn Ward's National Book Award for Salvage the Bones, for example, even benefited AALBC.com -- advertising from the publisher, commissions on increased book sales, traffic, conversation, etc. This is all great.\n\nAwards with financial prizes also help writers continue to write.\n\nThe only problem I have is our reliance on these awards for validation -- further our inability to bestow an award of equal prestige.\n\nThe NAACP, for example, bestows Image Awards for literature every year\n\nThe ALA Give out the Coretta Scott King Award for children's books\n\nEssence used to give out Literary Awards:\n\nThe African American Literary Awards Show has been doing it for years\n\n-- but had to cancel their ceremony last year:\n\nI could go on and on pointing out awards that have relatively little consequence within our community. ReShonda Tate Billingsley winning an NAACP image award had zero impact here. Kadir Nelson winning a boat load of Correct Scott King Award means nothing as far as I can tell.\n\nNo advertising from the publisher, not increased traffic, sales, nothing...\n\nWhat this means however is that I have all the incentive in the world to cover Black National Book Award Winners than I do to cover Hurston/Wright winners.\n\nIt is a good thing I'm not just here for the money... and certainly not for awards"
