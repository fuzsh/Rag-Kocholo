        "text": "Essay on Flight in Song of Solomon\n\n1580 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIt's not just about telling the story; it's about involving the reader. we (you, the reader, and I, the author) come together to make this book, to feel this experience\" (Tate 125). But Morrison also indicates in each of her novels that images of the zero, the absence, the silence that is both chosen and enforced, are ideologically and politically revelatory. Morrison's male characters imagine themselves in flight and are almost all in love with airplanes. . In the tradition of black literature since Richard Wright's Native Son, however, the privilege of flight, at least in airplanes, is mostly reserved for white boys.\n\nThe Glass Castle, by Jeannette Walls\n\n768 Words | 2 Pages\n\nOn December 10, 1950, in Stockholm, Sweden, one of the greatest literary minds of the twentieth century, William Faulkner, presented his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize. If one reads in between the lines of this acceptance speech, they can detect a certain message – more of a cry or plead – aimed directly to adolescent authors and writers, and that message is to be the voice of your own generation; write about things with true importance. This also means that authors should include heart, soul, spirit, and raw, truthful emotion into their writing. “Love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice” (Faulkner) should all be frequently embraced – it is the duty of authors to do so. If these young and adolescent authors ignore this message and duty, the already endangered state of literature will continue to diminish until its unfortunate extinction.\n\nBlack Humanity In Toni Morrison's The Site Of Memory\n\n1350 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMy job becomes how to rip that veil drawn over “proceeding too terrible to relate.\"(Pg.91) I particularly love the switch in the technique of writing for Black literature that Morrison mention where \"the interior life\" is revealed. Morrison does this to identify the change from where we used our literary power to prove our humanity to now using that power to heal our community and in turn invite the marginalized group being discussed to speak for themselves. “It is the duty of the younger Negro artist . . . to change through the force of his art that old whispering\" I want to be white,\" hidden in the aspirations of his people, to \"Why I should want to be white? I am a Negro? And beautiful!” (Langston Hughes, The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain 1926) As Black Artist we are called to love the arts even if the arts doesn 't love us in return. We beg and bleed for black art. To me you 're an Artist when you are speaking, singing, drawing, dancing etc. your many truths drawn from and for the community to which you belong for all to see. As a progressive artistic community we must then write, produce, act, dance, sing, and be those truths. In continuing my journey as a Black artist, I will be doing an independent study on “Black Life on the Global Scale – An Ubuntist Identifies Art” with the advisement of a faculty advisor, the dynamic poet Kimmika Williams Witherspoon. This independent study will lead to a three part project that features social media as a platform in study broad advocacy, a documentary film, and a one woman show featuring a host of characters based on the people I will meet abroad. As a black actress, a black poet, a black singer and a creative Afrocentric human being I consider myself a black artist whose goal is to find and define her own artistry that will\n\nCritical Analysis of Recitatif Toni Morrison\n\n1321 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn the story, “Recitatif,” Toni Morrison uses vague signs and traits to create Roberta and Twyla’s racial identity to show how the characters relationship is shaped by their racial difference. Morrison wants the reader’s to face their racial preconceptions and stereotypical assumptions. Racial identity in “Recitatif,” is most clear through the author’s use of traits that are linked to vague stereotypes, views on racial tension, intelligence, or ones physical appearance. Toni Morrison provides specific social and historical descriptions of the two girls to make readers question the way that stereotypes affect our understanding of a character. The uncertainties about racial identity of the characters causes the reader to become pre-occupied with assigning a race to a specific character based merely upon the associations and stereotypes that the reader creates based on the clues given by Morrison throughout the story. Morrison accomplishes this through the relationship between Twyla and Roberta, the role of Maggie, and questioning race and racial stereotypes of the characters. Throughout the story, Roberta and Twyla meet throughout five distinct moments that shapes their friendship by racial differences.\n\nNative American Culture in a Modern America: House Made of Dawn by Scott Momaday\n\n2018 Words | 5 Pages\n\nScott Momaday was born on February 27, 1934, in Oklahoma. His mother was a literature teacher and his father was an art teacher. Momaday’s parents both where authors and taught on Indian reserves. Momaday was forced to adjust between two cultures from an early age; although, he views this situation as an advantage, both in his life and in his work. After receiving a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of New Mexico, he submitted a few poems to a creative writing contest sponsored by Stanford University. There Ivor Winters, professor and established poet, secured a scholarship for the young man and became his mentor. Momaday remained at Stanford to earn a master's and Ph.D. in English and continued to write fiction and poetry. He came out as a highly successful writer of many books, and his literary career full of outstanding achievements. House Made of Dawn, his “classic first novel”, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. In his writings, Momaday ha..."
