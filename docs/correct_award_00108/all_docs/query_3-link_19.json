She was a homemaker and a devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nMeanwhile, her father, George Wofford, was raised in Cartersville, Georgia.\n\nWhen Morrison was about two years old, her family’s landlord set fire to their house while they were home because her parents could not afford to pay rent.\n\nMorrison’s parents instilled in her a sense of heritage through telling traditional African-American folktales and singing songs.\n\nShe read frequently as a child.\n\nAmong her favorite authors were Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy.\n\nMorrison became a Catholic at 12 years old.\n\nShe chose the name Anthony for her baptismal ceremony in honor of Anthony of Padua.\n\nThis is how her nickname, Toni, came about.\n\nWhen she attended Lorain High School, she was active on the debate team, the drama club, and the yearbook team.\n\nShe then studied drama at Howard University, where she encountered racial segregation for the first time.\n\nMorrison started writing fiction while she was at Howard University with a group of writers.\n\nShe graduated with a B.A. in English in 1953 and later earned a Master of Arts degree from Cornell University.\n\nTEACHING AND LITERARY CAREER\n\nAfter teaching at universities and facing personal struggles like divorce and raising her kids, she became an editor at Random House.\n\nThere, she helped publish books by famous African-American authors like Muhammad Ali and Henry Dumas.\n\nMorrison also edited important collections that showed Black life in the United States, which helped bring African-American literature to more readers and support new African-American writers.\n\nOne of her stories, which she wrote at Howard University, became her first novel, “The Bluest Eye,” which was published in 1970 and received good reviews.\n\nAlthough it didn’t sell much at first, it became popular when colleges started including it on their reading lists.\n\nMorrison went on to write more successful novels like “Sula” and “Song of Solomon.”\n\nIn 1983, she quit her job at Random House to focus on writing and teaching.\n\nShe also wrote a play called “Dreaming Emmett” based on a true story, which was performed in 1986.\n\nToni Morrison drew inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, an enslaved woman, while working on “The Black Book.” This inspired her most renowned novel, Beloved, which was published in 1987.\n\nThe novel recounts the tragic narrative of a mother who sacrifices her child to shield her from slavery’s horrors, only to be haunted by the child’s ghost later on.\n\nEven though it faced some critical reviews at first, “Beloved” achieved bestseller status and earned Morrison the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988.\n\nMorrison delved deeper into themes of love and African-American history in what is now known as the Beloved Trilogy.\n\nThe trilogy’s second installment, “Jazz,” published in 1992, is set against the backdrop of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nIn the same year, she published one more book, “Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination,” in which she scrutinized the portrayal of African-Americans in White American literature.\n\nIn 1993, Morrison made history by becoming the first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nHer profound impact on literature was further acknowledged through accolades such as the Jefferson Lecture and the National Book Foundation’s Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.\n\nShe concluded the Beloved Trilogy with “Paradise,” published in 1997.\n\nIn 1998, a movie based on “Beloved” was shown in theaters.\n\nIt was a big deal because Oprah Winfrey helped make it happen and even acted in the movie.\n\nThe movie ended up not doing well with audiences.\n\nHowever, some critics liked how the movie explored important issues through its spooky parts.\n\nMorrison also worked on music projects and even helped create an opera based on a true story that inspired “Beloved.”\n\nAs Morrison’s fame grew, she was recognized as one of the best American writers of the past few decades.\n\nThe Toni Morrison Society, which focused on scholarly research on Morrison’s works, established its home base at Oberlin College in August 2012.\n\nMorrison’s eleventh novel, “God Help the Child,” published in 2015, centers on a woman navigating emotional wounds from her past.\n\nMorrison’s contributions also extended to The Nation magazine’s editorial advisory board.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nWhile teaching at Howard University from 1957 to 1964, she met and married Harold Morrison, an architect from Jamaica, in 1958.\n\nToni took his last name and became known as Toni Morrison.\n\nThey welcomed their first son, Harold Ford, in 1961.\n\nShortly after, in 1964, while pregnant, Toni and Harold divorced.\n\nA year later, in 1965, their second son, Slade Kevin, was born.\n\nTragically, Slade Morrison passed away from pancreatic cancer on December 22, 2010, while Toni was in the middle of writing her novel “Home.”\n\nShe took a break from writing for a year or two before finishing the book, which was eventually published in 2012.\n\nAt the age of 88, Toni Morrison passed away at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, New York City, on August 5, 2019, due to pneumonia complications.\n\nIMPACT AND LEGACY\n\nToni Morrison made a huge impact on how people think about race and identity.\n\nHer books were not just popular but also influenced how people see the world.\n\nShe was not afraid to talk about difficult subjects like racism and how it affects people’s lives.\n\nAside from writing, she also taught at places like Princeton University and helped other Black writers get their work published.\n\nHer writing and teaching inspired many people to speak up about important issues like fairness and equality.\n\nToni Morrison Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Toni
