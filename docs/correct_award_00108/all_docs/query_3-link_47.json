        "text": "Why Honor Toni Morrison\n\nShe is a global citizen who left this world enriched by her presence here. —Johnny Coleman\n\nToni Morrison’s ties to Oberlin College and Lorain County can be traced her childhood in Lorain, Ohio. Born Chloe Ardelia Wofford, she grew up captivated by stories—narratives and oral histories—told to her by her parents, grandparents, and others in her close-knit community. These stories would help shape her view of the world outside her working- class upbringing, and provide the basis for the recurring themes in many of her novels: humanity, community, love, loss, memory, and the devasting effects of poverty, enslavement, racial hatred.\n\nFrom her first novel, The Bluest Eye, to her 11th and last, God Help the Child, the impact of Morrison’s life and the breadth of her work qualitatively has inspired generations of writers, whose work has come to be read, and to whom the writers are speaking.\n\nOberlin College’s Alan and Irene Wurtzel Theater will be the site of a daylong commemoration of Morrison on February 18—‘‘In Celebration of Toni Morrison: A Gesture of Love and Reflection.’’ The live-streamed event will be presented and experienced in real time, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Persons may also call in to 440-775-5493 to share a tribute.\n\nAnyone who’s been inspired by and is interested in expressing their appreciation of Morrison is invited to read an excerpt from one of her books, offer an anecdote, or share their feelings in what organizer Johnny Coleman wants to be a gesture of love: an intentional coming together across region, generation, culture, and nation to celebrate her as one village.\n\nColeman, an Oberlin College professor of studio art and Africana studies, developed this idea upon learning of Morrison’s death. Honoring her on the day of her birth is a means to acknowledge her life and the significance of her work.\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nToni Morrison was the first African American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1993, for ’‘the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.’’ She has written 11 novels; children’s books that she coauthored with her son, Slade Morrison; literary criticisms; a play; and essay collections.\n\nHer first book, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970, followed by Sula in 1973. Song of Solomon, published in 1977, received the National Book Critics Circle Award that same year. Beloved, published in 1987, earned the Pulitzer Prize in 1988. Her books regularly appeared on the New York Times Bestseller list and are often featured as book club favorites by television icon Oprah Winfrey.\n\nIn addition to her own work, largely published by Alfred A. Knopf of New York, Morrison championed the work of many African American and African writers during her time as an editor at Random House. Among them were Angela Davis, Muhammad Ali, Toni Cade Bambara, and Gayl Jones.\n\nMorrison, 88, died August 5, 2019, of complications of pneumonia at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx."
