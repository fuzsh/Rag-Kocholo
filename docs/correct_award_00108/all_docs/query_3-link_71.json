        "text": "Toni Morrison is one of the greatest authors to ever live because she commanded respect and appreciation with everything she wrote and her work was renowned for its rich historical profundity and emotional panoramas. Her lucid accounts of the Black American experience made her an encyclopedia of truth for readers who wanted to see the world with new eyes and truly view the experiences of others with an allegiance to humanity and shared understanding. Morrison’s journey as a writer began while she was raising two sons and working as an editor at Random House. Her debut novel, The Bluest Eye, which she published at 39 years old, was inspired by her own desire to read stories that reflected the complex nature of Black life as captured in her famous quote: “If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.”\n\nAs a winner of the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom, Morrison had ideas that shifted culture, and an approach to her craft that was unlike that of other writers in her generation, one which empowered her to shape stories that have stood out in the literary canon as paradigm shifting. With her words, she transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary, the deflated into the lush, and the mundane into the eccentric, all while transfusing ideas and transcribing the rawness of the human story.\n\nToni Morrison Books In Order\n\nMorrison’s repertoire is more than a resume; it has become a rich literary reservoir and the legacy of her Midas touch, which has produced several acclaimed Bildungsroman masterpieces like Bluest Eye, magical realism stories like Beloved, and emotional works like Sula, among others.

Love specifically examines the life of Heed and Christine, two women bound together by a shared past involving the wealthy Cosey family.

Just 17 miles away is another town called Convent, where women revolt against the agenda of Ruby’s male-dominated society.

Jadine and Son live different lives and approach their Blackness from different tangents. More importantly, Morrison shows the sharp contrast between Jadine’s assimilation into white culture and the privilege that can come with it, and Son’s contrasting perspective, which has been informed by his life of poverty. Skillfully, Morrison uses different settings to show their affair and examine issues of race, culture, loyalty and betrayal.\n\nWho should read this book: Readers who are curious about the intersection of race, loyalty and class.\n\nWhere to read this book: Penguin Random House.\n\n4. The Source of Self-Regard (2019)\n\nAmong Morrison’s most notable works is The Source of Self-Regard, a compilation of powerful essays, speeches, meditations, a eulogy and decades of knowledge by Morrison all condensed into what would become the last of her works to be published before she died.

The epic plot spans several decades, giving readers a three-dimensional insight into Milkman’s adventure to find his roots and cultural heritage. The plot’s narrative, rich with symbolism, complex characters and evocative imagery, is a captivating journey for readers. The book was met with national acclaim after its release, and in 1978, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. Although the book was well-received, some controversy came along with that acclaim. Between the ‘90s and early 2000s, several schools across the United States banned the book, citing that it contained degrading and sexually lewd content. However, most of those bans were later lifted.\n\nWho should read this book: This is an ideal book for readers who are curious about complex family and cultural heritage.\n\nWhere to read this book: Penguin Random House.\n\n2. The Bluest Eye (1970)\n\nMorrison’s classic debut novel, The Bluest Eye, is a welcoming introduction to readers who haven’t read any of her work before. In this non-polemic novel, Morrison incisively analyzes the destructive influence of racism and its translation and perceptions of beauty standards through the story of 11-year-old Pecola Breedlove, a young Black girl from an abusive home who yearns for acceptance, but more importantly, blue eyes. Set in 1940s Lorain, Ohio — Morrison’s hometown — the novel notes how societal pressures devastate Pecola’s life, leading to a tragic conclusion. Morrison’s unflinching prose delves into themes of identity, community and the longing for what can seem to be unattainable acceptance. Some critics consider Morrison’s The Bluest Eye to be one of her best works because in many ways, the novel set the tone for her career, although its popularity grew years after its release.\n\nWho should read this book: Readers who are interested in racial and social issues will appreciate this book.\n\nWhere to read this book: Penguin Random House.\n\n1. Beloved (1987)\n\nMorrison’s magnum opus, Beloved, is a poignant story about the trauma of slavery and its lasting scars. The novel follows the story of Sethe, a freed slave who is still traumatized by the ghost of her daughter, and the farm Sweet Home in Kentucky, where she endured horrifying experiences even years after she became free. Set in post-Civil War America, the novel takes a grim and brutally honest approach to the trauma of slavery survivors. It presents their experiences in a way that is deeply personal to each character, yet universally significant to all who read it. Morrison’s Pulitzer-winning Beloved is the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped from a Kentucky plantation in 1856 with her family but was later re-captured. Instead of allowing her daughter to return to slavery, Margaret kills her daughter, which leads her enslaver to believe that she is mentally deranged, and this leads her owner to refuse to keep her.\n\nWho should read this book: Beloved is an essential read for those who enjoy historically rich and emotionally charged stories.\n\nWhere to read this book: Penguin Random House.\n\nBottom Line\n\nToni Morrison’s work, which includes novels, non-fiction and children's books, has significantly contributed to readers’ understanding and appreciation of Black culture. Her most acclaimed novels, including Beloved, The Bluest Eye and Song of Solomon, have combined the richness of the Black identity and its existence in society, securing her as an icon of literary repute."
