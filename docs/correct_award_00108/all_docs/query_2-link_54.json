        "text": "Editor’s Note: In 2003, staff writer Jennifer Haliburton interviewed Toni Morrison about her time growing up in Lorain, Ohio, and how it shaped her life and her work. The resulting story originally ran in the November 2003 issue of Ohio Magazine.\n\nThe story of the little girl from Lorain could have been just another one of Ella Wofford’s tall tales.\n\nElla was, after all, a masterful storyteller, capable of summoning magical plot lines and exotic characters on a moment’s notice to entertain her two daughters on chilly autumn nights. Sitting in their usual seats near the warm, pot-bellied stove, the girls would have been spellbound as Ella unwound the story of the Lorain girl named Chloe, a poverty-stricken child from a small steel town who grows up to achieve great fame and fortune. Ella would have described how Chloe’s family endured terribly difficult times during the Great Depression — how when they could no longer afford the $4-a-month rent, their vindictive landlord set the family’s house on fire — and her daughter would have gasped in horror. The girls would imagine little Chloe crying, her family embracing each other on the sidewalk in front of their burning home, watching in disbelief as flames and thick smoke poured from the windows and turned the gray Lorain sky even darker.\n\nElla’s daughter reveled in her stories. Whenever she told the tale of Cinderella, reciting how the beautiful servant girl waltzed with a prince at a glamorous ball, the youngest daughter would rise from her seat and dance around the room.\n\nYoung Toni Morrison — born Chloe Wofford — spinning around the room as her mother spun fantasy and folklore, didn’t know that her own life’s story would one day rival Ella’s tales. As she glided across the room, the story of Cinderella providing the soundtrack to her dancing, Morrison didn’t know that she could be preparing for the day in 1992 when she would attend a sort of magical ball of her own at the Grand Hall in Stockholm, Sweden. The day when she — already the star of the ceremony as the first African-American to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature — would mirror a character in one of Ella’s fair tales, as the sequins on her long, black gown began reflecting the Grand Hall’s 13 chandeliers and making Morrison shine like a beacon.\n\nThe scene was a long way from the smokestacks and steel mills of Lorain that were the backdrop of Morrison’s youth in the 1930s and ‘40s. But her work that was honored by the Swedish Academy — and has made her an international best-selling author and a Pulitzer Prize winner, earning her the title of “America’s greatest storyteller” by Time magazine pulses with the images, impressions and ear for dialogue she cultivated while growing up in Ohio.\n\n“There are a lot of people from Ohio in publishing in New York,” says Morrison, 72, who is promoting Who’s Got Game? The Lion or the Mouse?, the latest in a series of children’s books she has co-authored with her son, Slade, as well as her seventh novel, Love, to be released this month. “They speak about their Ohio towns with … complete contempt, as though they had been in a prison. It was someplace that they just had to leave. But I don’t feel that way about the town I was born in. … I don’t mean it was all happy, but it was unique for me. I never felt as though I was running away from it.”\n\nMorrison has written that, “Ohio offers an escape from stereotyped black settings. It is neither plantation nor ghetto.” Lorain was in the grips of the Great Depression when Morrison was born in her grandparents’ home on Elyria Avenue on Feb. 8, 1931 — the second of four children. However, in previous years, the town had not only offered an escape for African-Americans seeking refuge from the brutal prejudice of the South, it was also a haven for European immigrants hoping to find financial stability in the town’s many industrial plants. Once an agricultural town, Lorain found itself in the perfect location to benefit from the country’s booming production of steel in the early 20th century: the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad ran through town, conveniently connecting Lorain to coal deposits in the southern parts of the state; the Nickel Plate Railroad tied it to major hubs of commerce, including Chicago and New York City; and the town sat nicely on the spot where the Black River meets Lake Erie — prime territory for shipbuilding.\n\nThe geography was too attractive for industry to ignore. Thew Shovel Company set up shop in south Lorain along the B&O tracks. East Lorain offered the best spot for The American Shipbuilding Company. Then, of course, there was the king of them all, The National Tube Company, which moved to Lorain in 1894, its network of blast furnaces and rail bar and pipe mills quickly consuming one-fifth of the town and luring 9,000 laborers at its peak in the early 1920s.\n\n\"There were so many people working in the plants and the shipyards — there was always a lot of labor here,\" recalls Morrison. It was this often-gritty landscape of factories and freighters that provided the setting for Morrison’s first book, 1970’s The Bluest Eye — the only one of her works to feature her hometown. The story follows two sisters and their friendship with 11-year-old Pecola Breedlove, a girl who believes everyone would love her — including the mother who neglects her, the father who victimized her, and the society that shuns her — if only she had blue eyes. Morrison filled the book with Lorain references — alternating the names of some places as when she refers to Lorain’s Zipp’s Coal Company as “Zick’s.” In The Bluest Eye, the sisters, Claudia and Frieda, traverse the town, a setting as unwelcoming as Pecola’s family:\n\nGrown-ups talk in tired, edgy voices about Zick’s Coal Company and take us along in the evening to the railroad tracks where we fill burlap sacks with the tiny pieces of coal lying about. Later we walk home, glancing back to see the great carloads of slag being dumped, red hot and smoking, into the ravine that skirts the steel mill. The dying fire lights the sky with a dull orange glow. Frieda and I lag behind, staring at the patch of color surrounded by the black. It is impossible not to feel a shiver when our feet leave the gravel path and sink into the dead grass in the field.\n\nWith companies based on steel production quickly making Lorain home, so did a mix of European immigrants and laborers from across the country. The National Tube workforce was so diverse signs in the company’s mills were often printed in five or six different languages. The population would eventually be made up of residents from such a wide range of countries, Lorain could be coined “the International City.”\n\n***\n\n“A real melting pot is what they used to call it, and it was,” says Morrison. She remembers that, unlike the biting racism and sharply drawn color lines that existed in many small towns in America in the early 20th century, Lorain’s unique cultural diversity had Irish people living next to Portuguese people living next to African-Americans living next to whites. And during the Depression, when steel production slowed dramatically and National Tube reduced its workforce from 9,000 to only 1,300 full-time workers in 1932, these families who all shared the same employers were all equally poor.\n\n“I think people in many parts of the country are not familiar with the ways in which small, industrial towns work; they have this stereotyped impression of how things are between the races,” says Morrison, who, while living on 21st Street, fashioned dolls out of toothpicks and hollyhock flowers with her Italian and German neighbors. “When I grew up, the major differences between people were not racial, they were financial.”\n\n“There wasn’t that much middle class here — you either had money or you didn’t,” says Morrison’s sister, Louis Brooks. The girls and their two brothers felt the sting of the Depression when they were forced to move into nearly a dozen different houses and storefronts in Lorain in the 1930s and ’40s. Like many blacks migrating to the area, Morrison’s parents, George and Ella Ramah Wofford, both the children of Southern sharecroppers, had come seeking opportunities for employment and education the South refused to offer. But during the worst years of the Depression, the family faced poverty, and Morrison’s father struggled to make ends meet as a welder in the steel mill and as a construction worker, and in whatever other jobs he could find."
