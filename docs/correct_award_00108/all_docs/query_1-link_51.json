        "text": "This course will be an intermediate/advanced seminar honoring and exploring the works of Toni Morrison (1931–2019), an African-American author who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988 and numerous other notable awards. She was a giant of a public intellectual and contemporizing figure in American Literature; her works continue to inspire and transform readers and scholars of all identities although her primary purpose was to write for black people. As Morrison herself said, “If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, you must be the one to write it.” In writing she changed the literary landscape of the US. In particular, her poetics illustrate how African-American and especially African-American women authors express depths of meaning and experience absolutely central to any understanding of the complex culture and histories of the US. Another Morrison quote hints at the profundity of her own view of her life’s work: “We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.” These two quotes provide a framework for the course, which seeks students interested in language and its power, literature and its insights, and the black female experience. Over the course of the term students will read through Morrison’s oeuvre of novels (The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Love, A Mercy, Home, God Help the Child) as well as a number of her key essays and addresses (Playing in the Dark, The Source of Self-Regard), scholarly criticism, and responses to Morrison’s 2019 passing. There may be some division of labor with the later novels (after Paradise), but the course is reading intensive. Students will also prepare frequent short written responses and a final project responding to Morrison in some way. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, passage analysis, and the final Morrison project to be shared with the class.\n\nAlways visit the Registrar's Office for the official course catalog and schedules."
