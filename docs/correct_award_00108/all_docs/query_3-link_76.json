        "text": "Toni Morrison was a prolific novelist and a force in the literary world—and now, her many accomplishments are being recognized with a commemorative stamp. In the span of five decades, she published 11 novels and won countless awards for her writing, from the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction to the National Book Critics Circle Award to the Nobel Prize in Literature. Morrison was also awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.\n\nFour of Morrison’s books have been selected for Oprah’s Book Club (see the full list here), including Sula, Song of Solomon, and The Bluest Eye, and Oprah and Morrison maintained a close friendship after Oprah starred in a film adaptation of Beloved in 1988.\n\nThat made Oprah a perfect person to share sentiments about Morrison during the stamp unveiling ceremony, which took place earlier today. In addition to Oprah’s speech, the ceremony included remarks by Christopher L. Eisgruber, Princeton University’s current president—Morrison held the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Humanities position there for nearly 20 years—as well as the Dean of the Faculty, Gene A. Jarrett, who happens to be a former student of Morrison’s. Deborah Feingold, the photographer whose portrait of Morrison is being used for the stamp, spoke, and a Princeton professor, Ruha Benjamin, read a letter from the Obamas before Oprah’s video was played in closing.\n\n“Toni Morrison’s books are in so many of our homes and abide in our hearts—because she served as a catalyst for generations of readers over the years to understand the power of reading and words,” Oprah begins in the video, adding that Morrison’s writing represented exactly what Oprah was looking for when she started her book club. “I knew what I wanted to do was to create an environment where people could gather and open our minds to explore great books.”\n\nShe continues by telling some stories from Morrison’s visits to The Oprah Winfrey Show—including the time Oprah told Morrison that her books are often challenging reads. “She said, ‘Well, think about how difficult they are to write.’”\n\nBut that was the power of Morrison’s words: They meant something. “What she was able to do was bring people from all over the country and the world together in an entirely new experience,” Oprah says, noting that women from vastly different places all saw themselves in Pecola Breedlove, the protagonist of The Bluest Eye.\n\n“When she was there for The Bluest Eye, she shared one of her most profound stories,” Oprah continues. “She told the story of being a young mother, raising Slade and Ford as young boys. Often, when they came into the room, she would greet them with a critical eye. She would ask, Did you comb your hair? Pull up those socks! Tuck in your shirt.” But Morrison said that came out of a “desire for them to do well,” Oprah explains, and that Morrison eventually realized it was all about love. “She realized that what children want to feel is, does your face light up when I enter the room? Do your eyes light up? Are you glad to see me?”\n\nAccording to Oprah, that was one of the most poignant moments in the entirety of The Oprah Winfrey Show. “At the time, I could hear mothers in the audience gasping; it was such an enlightening moment,” she says. “I was at an airport recently and a woman came up to me and told me that that moment with Toni Morrison on the show changed the way she parented forever.”\n\nOprah finished her speech by thanking Morrison. “I will be forever grateful for her work—and know that we will always have Toni Morrison in our lives because we will always have her words.”\n\nWatch her video honoring Morrison below."
