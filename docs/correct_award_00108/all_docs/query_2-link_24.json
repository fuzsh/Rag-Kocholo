        "text": "Toni Morrison, the American author whose books like \"Beloved\" and \"Song of Solomon\" developed deep characters and evoked a nation's original sin of slavery, Jim Crow and discrimination, died Monday. She was 88.\n\nMorrison, a longtime Grand View-on-Hudson resident, was well-known and highly respected in the Rockland community.\n\nIn 2015, Morrison returned to Rockland for the installation of a \"Bench by the Road\" in Nyack's Memorial Park to honor abolitionist Cynthia Hesdra, who was a former slave who became an entrepreneur.\n\nOBITUARY: Toni Morrison, Nobel Prize winner, author of 'Beloved,' dies at 88\n\n2015: Toni Morrison gives Rockland a seat for remembrance\n\nMorrison established the Bench by the Road Project to create spaces to summon the history of slavery of Africans in the United States and the Caribbean, and reflect on the absence of their stories in our historic teachings.\n\n\"This particular bench placement to commemorate the life of Cynthia Hesdra, in my neighborhood, is really profound,\" Morrison said at the time.\n\nBill Batson, a Nyack artist and trustee of the Nyack Historical Society, chaired the committee that brought the \"Bench by the Road\" program to Nyack in 2015.\n\n\"We feel like we've been connected to the whole world through this,\" Batson said Tuesday morning. \"There are now 25 communities connected to the African-American diaspora.\"\n\nBatson said the Nyack bench committee will start planning a way to celebrate Morrison and her role as a writer and humanitarian. \"Thanks to her, there will be hundreds of communities that have found a way to have honored a history that is not properly commemorated,\" he said. \"We will be forever in her debt.\"\n\nBatson said a memorial service is planned for 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Nyack Center, on the corner of Depew and South Broadway.\n\nA child of sharecroppers, the granddaughter of a slave, Morrison achieved the pinnacle of success as a writer. She won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, the first African-American given the honor. Morrison told the Washington Post at the time that other African-American writers had called to congratulate her. \"I feel like it's shared among us,\" she said.\n\nHer novels captured the most personal of stories amid the most awful of a nation's deeds. As a leader in the literary field, Morrison pushed for multicultural \"literary canon\" to be considered the core of influential writings.\n\nHer books include \"The Bluest Eye,\" which later became an Oprah Winfrey Book Club choice; \"Sula,\" a National Book Award nominee; \"Song of Solomon,\" which won a National Book Critics Circle Award and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award; \"Tar Baby\"; \"Beloved,\" a Pulitzer Prize winner; \"Jazz\"; and \"Paradise.\"\n\nMorrison's \"Beloved\" was brought to the big screen by award-winning director Jonathan Demme, a longtime Nyack resident who died in 2017.\n\nA longtime professor at Princeton University, Morrison had also been a writer-in-residence at SUNY Stony Brook and SUNY Albany and a visiting lecturer at SUNY Purchase.\n\nNancy Cutler writes about People & Policy for the USA Today Network Northeast.
