DE SILVA, J., ABEYWARDENE, J. & SIVA SELLIAH, J.\n\nAPPLICATION No. 122/82 ‑ HIGH COURT COLOMBO CASE No. 649/79.\n\nJUNE 5, 6, 7, 8 AND JULY 2 AND 3, 1984.\n\nMurder - sections 293 and 294 of the penal code - Requirements to prove a charge of murder the fourth limb of section 294 - propriety of questioning of Jury by Judge to elicit reasons for verdict - sections 235 (1) and (2) of the code of Criminal procedure Act.\n\nThe appellant in this case was indicted in the High Court on the charge of having committed the murder of one Jezima Gray by inflicting fatal gunshot injuries. At the conclusion of the trial the Jury returned an unanimous verdict of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The presiding Judge purporting to act under Sec. 235 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 inquired from the Jury as to the basis on which they arrived at this decision. In answer, the Foreman replied that they had doubts as to whether the gunshot was directed solely at the deceased. On futher questioning by the Trial Judge the Foreman of the Jury informed court that they were unanimous in their view that the gunshot was fired by the accused. The learned Trial Judge not satisfied by the verdict , purporting to act under Sec. 235 (2) of the code of Criminal Procedure Act gave further directions to the Jury in respect of the charge of murder dealing particularly with the fourth limb of Sec. 294 of the Penal code. Thereafter the Jury unanimously found the appellant guilty of murder.\n\n235\n\nThe accused appealed against the conviction to the Court of Appeal.\n\nHeld-\n\n(a) In view of the direction given by the Trial Judge in his original summing up pertaining to the question of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the ground of knowledge, the original verdict brought in by the Jury is not perverse.\n\n(b) The verdict returned on the first occasion by the Jury was unambiguous and unanimous.\n\n(c) if the learned Trial Judge disagrees with the verdict of the Jury he could give further directions under Sec. 235 (2) and ask the Jury to reconsider their verdict‑\n\n(d) In terms of Sec. 236 (1) the learned Trial Judge can only pose questions to the Jury as to the reason for their verdict only for the purpose of ascertaining their verdict and not to find out the reason or basis therefor.\n\n(e) The learned Trial Judge has failed to direct the Jury, that to prove that the accused is guilty of murder under the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person committing the act knew that it was so imminently dangerous that (1) it must in all probability cause death or (2) in all probability cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and that the accused committed such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.\n\nCases referred to:\n\n(1) M, E.

DE SILVA, J.\n\nThe 1st accused‑appellant and two others viz : H. L. A. Sumathipala and R. A. Sumanadasa alias Edwin stood indicted on four counts In count. 1 all three accused were charged with having committed on 17th September 1977 at Stace Road, Grandpass, the murder of one Jezima Gray, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the penal Code. On count 2, the 2nd accused Sumathipala stood charge with attempting to commit the murder of one H. N. R. Alwis by means of a bomb, an offence punishable under Section 300 of the Penal Code while on count 3 he was charged with the attempted murder of the said A. N. R. Alwis with a bomb but made punishable under Section 4(2) of the Offensive Weapons Act No. 18 of 1966. On the count 4 the 3rd accused R. A. Sumanadasa alias Edwin stood charged with voluntarily causing hurt with a sword to one U. G. Dayaratne an offence punishable under Section 315 of the Penal Code.\n\nAt the end of the prosecution case the State Counsel withdrew counts 2 and 3 against the 2nd accused and he was therefore acquitted on those two counts at that stage. Later the Court directed the jury to acquit the 2nd and 3rd accused on count 1 with the result that counts 2 and 3 against the 2nd accused having already been withdrawn, he was acquitted on all charges against him while the 3rd accused was acquitted on count 1.\n\nThe 1st accused was called upon for his defence on count 1 while the 3rd accused was called upon for his defence on count 4.\n\nThe jury by an unanimous verdict acquitted the 3rd accused on count 4 and found the 1st accused guilty of murder on count 1 and he was accordingly sentenced to death.\n\nEvidence of the incident in which Jezima Gray by her death was provided by one Dayaratne who had been living in Jezima's house for about 12 years and Farook, her brother.\n\nDasa the 1st accused was known to these two witnesses for about 4 to 5 months prior to the date of the incident and he was living near the Grandpass Police Station. The 2nd accused Sumathipala was known to Dayaratne for about 12 years while Farook did not give the period of time he had known the 2ndaccused. The 2nd accused too\n\n237\n\nWas living near the Grandpass Police Station, this Police Station being about 500 yards from the Jezima theatre where the incident took place.\n\nTwo days prior to this incident i.e. on 15th September 1977,Dayaratne had made a complaint to the Grandpass Police Station against the 2nd and 3rd accused. The 1st accused was a close associate of these two accused.\n\nJezima theatre has two gates, the one on the right hand side was kept closed and it was near the open left hand side gate that the shooting had taken place. Leading from Stace Road was a motorable gravel road leading to Jezima Gray's house bounded on two sides by walls, one 12 ft. high on the boundary of the land of one Sirisena, and the other 5 to 8 ft. high being the wall of the Jezima theatre. Near the left hand side gate was the boutique of one Kesawan, and was also known as Kochchiyage kade.\n\nThe incident had taken place between 10.30 and 11.30 p.m. Dayaratne and Farook had come to see the 9.30 p.m. show at Jezima theatre along with one Tilak and Rohita. While they were watching the film, Jezima Gray had come to the cinema hall at about 10.30 or 11. 30 p.m. and informed them that Dasa, the 1st accused had come to meet them. Farook, Dayaratne, Rohita and Tilak came out of the cinema hall and with the deceased got on to Stace Road. The 1st accused was near the boutique of Kesawan with an unidentified man in a red shirt. When Dayaratne went close, the 1st accused in general asked that the complaint made on 15th September be withdrawn. The 2nd and 3rd accused said they cannot do anything and to ask Dayaratne. Then Dayaratne had said that he was not going to withdraw the complaint he had made and to do whatever they wanted. At this time the deceased too was present but she did not speak a word. The 1st accused told Ranjith and Tilak not to interfere but Ranjith had said that if anything happened to Dayaratne, he would come forward. At this stage, the 1st accused pulled out a pistol from his waist and said in general, \"I will kill you now\". Then the deceased came forward saying \"Dasa, don't don't\". The 1st accused saying \"who are you to stop me\" aimed the pistol in the direction of the deceased and when she tried to turn the shot was fires. The deceased fell down on receipt of the gunshot. Dayaratne ran to Sirisena's land while Farook ran in the direction of the house for about 75 yards and looked back.\n\n238"
