We regularly report on the human rights violations taking place in the Island of Sri Lanka. Our reporting is based on indisputable facts, the authentic details of which we receive from our sources directly from the North East and other parts of the Island. The United Nations human rights monitoring bodies have appreciated the veracity of our reporting.\n\nIn our submission to the 6th session, we will be high-lighting the human rights violations perpetrated against the people in the North East and other parts by successive governments that ruled the island since independence in 1948.\n\nOur report includes the history in a nutshell, colonisation & ethnic cleansing in the East, recorded figures of violations from 1956 to 2007, killing and harrassment of journalists, humanitarian workers, religious dignitaries, academics, parliamenterians - and major massacres and killings. Also the report includes details of military occupation of civilian dwellings/land, schools, places of worship and public buildings. We have also included details of cultural genocide in the North East with a list of 299 Christian churches and 1348 Hindu/Saiva temples/kovils which were fully or partially damaged by aerial bombing and shelling in the North East.\n\nThe incidents we have mentioned in our report since 1956, have never been subject to an independent inquiry - nor have the perpetrators been arrested and punished nor have the victims been compensated. There are many more incidents to be added to those we have in this report.\n\nImpunity is a very serious problem in Sri Lanka. Many notorious human rights violators in the Security forces especially in the Army, Police and the Paramilitary have received the best promotions and appointments as Ministers and to high profile jobs in the government. The government of Sri Lanka encourages and allows the perpertrators to move freely in society - and the violations continue.\n\nIn the Northeast the human rights situation has been deteriorating for many long years. Genocide, cultural genocide, multiple displacements are occuring and a systematic economic embargo to the North East is starving the people.\n\nFirst hand witnesses to these Crimes against humanity - cemeteries full of murdered bodies, hospitals full of child and adult casualties, camps full of displaced people, people starving due to the economic embargo and buildings destroyed in all parts of North East. The security forces have created ÒHigh Security ZonesÓ in the densily populated residential areas of the Northeast and are occupying civilian homes and public buildings.\n\nSirs / Mesdames,\n\nThe Sinhala constitution denies fundamental and political rights to the Tamil people. The introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in 1979 and 27years of emergency rule (ER) have inflicted terror upon the Tamil people in the island. ER and the PTA permit the Sri Lanka security forces to arrest, torture, rape and kill the Tamils with impunity. Only a few cases have attracted international news coverage - and international human rights and humanitarian organisations are paying attention to these.\n\nPress freedom and freedom of expression are in peril in Sri Lanka. Journalists are arrested, tortured, abducted, disappeared and killed over-night. Misinformation is heavily used internally and internationally by the government of Sri Lanka to distort the real picture of what is happening in the conflict areas.\n\nEthnic cleansing of Tamils and Singhalisation in the North East continues with foreign help. As part of the ethnic cleansing, the murdering of religious leaders and laymen inside and outside places of worship has also been taking place over the years.\n\n3\n\nSo far more than 100,000 Tamils have been killed and more than 200,000 have been multiply internally displaced. Another 600,000 or more Tamils have sought asylum in foreign countries.\n\nSirs / Mesdames, If we analyse respect for human rights by the government of Sri Lanka, the following truth becomes crystal clear - Sri Lanka has a regular habit of pretending to take some action on the massive human violations only a month before the beginning of the UN Human Rights' forums. These hollow promises of action are intended to avoid or counter any criticism that may be made by these forums, rather than to vigorously promote and protect human rights in real and effective terms.\n\nTypical examples of this are the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry and an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) in September 2006. We predicted the fate of the IIGEP in our earlier reports.\n\nIt is well known that for the last twenty four years, the LTTE has been engaged in an armed struggle with the support of the Tamils in exercise of their right to self-determination in the Tamil hereditary regions.\n\nAfter nearly a quarter century of armed conflict, there is a de-facto government in the Tamils' hereditary region under the LTTE administration. It has been in existence for more than 15 years and it has its own infrastructures - police and judiciary, Law College, Banking and Educational institutions, as well as welfare centres for children, disabled people, elders and war victims. This has been well witnessed by diplomats, dignitaries and VIPs.\n\nSirs / Mesdames, the reports of the UN Special rapporteurs, Special representatives of the UN Secretary General and the Working groups and furthermore the statements by international NGOs to every UN Human Rights forum clearly indicate that the human rights situation in Sri Lanka is far from improving - in fact it is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nAs Sri Lanka is a signatory to various UN covenants and conventions, it has an obligation to maintain international standards and to abide by iternational law.\n\nIn the past, UN action on various other country situations reminded us that \"Naming and Shaming\" is one of the preventive techniques in the protection of human rights. Therefore the reports of the UN dignitaries and other appeals, reports, joint-statements, interventions, written statements by various NGOs to the UN Human rights forums must all be taken into consideration in this period to apply UN action on Sri Lanka.\n\nAt this crucial situation, there is no doubt that International human rights law and international humanitarian law are severely and massively violated by Sri Lanka. Considering these facts, the best mechanism in hand which can be used, is to charge the President of Sri Lanka, the Commander-in-Chief of the Sri Lanka Security Forces and other Military officials with War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.\n\nIn addition, we urge this session to take immediate steps to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe that is being deliberately inflicted by the government of Sri Lanka on civilians in the North East.\n\nSir, being the President of the 6th session of the Human Rights Council, you can see that the international community is failing in its duties regarding Sri Lanka and that it is backing an aggressor which is perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity against a people who have been struggling for their Right to Self-determination for many decades.\n\nWe appeal to you to take immediate action during this session of the Human Rights Council.\n\nThank you,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nS. V. Kirubaharan\n\nGeneral Secretary\n\n4\n\nHistory in a nutshell\n\n1505 The Portuguese arrived in Ceylon during the existence of three sovereign kingdoms, one Tamil Kingdom in Jaffna, and two Sinhala Kingdoms in Kotte and Kandy.\n\nThe island was divided into three kingdoms, a Tamil kingdom in the North East, the Kandy kingdom of the highlands and the Kotte kingdom situated in the South.\n\n1619 Tamil sovereignty ended in June when the Portuguese defeated the Tamil King, and the Jaffna Kingdom became a Colony of the Portuguese.\n\n1658 The Dutch arrived in Ceylon and the Jaffna Kingdom became a Dutch Colony.\n\n1795 The British arrived in Ceylon and the Jaffna Kingdom became a British Colony.\n\n1802 Ceylon became a British Crown Colony.\n\n1833 For the first time in over 2,500 years of its recorded history, the entire island of Ceylon was brought under a single administration based on the recommendations of the Colebrook-Cameron Report.\n\n1862 Tamils from Southern India were brought as labourers to work in the tea plantations in the hill country by the British. During the same period Tamil labourers from South India were taken to work in the sugar cane plantations in South Africa, Mauritius and in many other British colonies.\n\n1885 Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan ­ Tamil leader called for increased representation in Legislative council for Tamils.\n\n1915 In June, Sinhala Buddhist-Muslim riots in Ceylon. Riots spread from the central province to the western and northwestern provinces.\n\nThere were heavy casualties amongst the Muslims. According to available records, 36 Muslims were killed and 205 Muslims were injured and raped. Nearly 85 mosques were damaged and more than 4,075 Muslim-owned shops were looted by the Sinhala rioters.\n\n1919 The Ceylon National Congress (CNC), the first full-fledged \"Nationalist\" political party was formed by a celebrated Tamil, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam.\n\n1921 Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam quitted the CNC, denouncing it as a party representing mainly a section of the Sinhalese.\n\n1927-1931 Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam had talks with Sinhala leaders when the Donoughmore Commission announced its recommendations in 1927. The talks ended in a failure as the Sinhala leaders ignored the aspirations of the Tamils.\n\n1944 The first Tamil political party, ÒAll Ceylon Tamil Congress-ACTCÓ was founded by G. G. Ponnambalam to champion the cause of the Tamils against Sinhala Buddhist domination.\n\n1947 The United National Party (UNP) was formed.\n\nThe first constitution of Ceylon was adopted by an Order in Council rather than by a Constituent Assembly. It was known as the (Lord) ÒSoulbury ConstitutionÓ which remained in force until 1972.\n\n1948 The British left Ceylon ­ independence was granted to ÒCeylonÓ and the power to govern Ceylon was handed over to the Sinhalese who were numerically superior.\n\nAfter the stringent 15 November 1948 Citizenship Act and the laws of disenfranchisement were enacted and adopted, the Tamils of Indian origin Tamils in the hill country (plantation Tamils) were deprived of selecting their representatives to the Parliament. More than a million plantation Tamil workers were rendered stateless.\n\n1948-50 The Government launched massive Sinhala colonisation schemes in the Eastern province. Gal oya in Batticaloa, Allai and Kathalai in Trincomalee were colonised under pretexts of development.\n\n1949 Dissension with the ÒTamil CongressÓ party led to the formation of the ÒTamil Federal PartyÓ (FP) under the leadership of S. J. V. Chelvanayagam.\n\n1951 S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike broke away from UNP and forms the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).\n\n5\n\n1956 On 14 June S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake father of President Chandrika Kumaratunga proclaimed the ÒSinhala Only ActÓ which made the Sinhala language the only official language of Ceylon.\n\nThe peaceful Satyagraha campaign staged by the Tamils to protest against the ÒSinhala Only ActÓ at the Galle Face Green, in front of the Parliament in Colombo was brutally savaged by Sinhalese thugs with the connivance of government. The outbreak of first anti-Tamil riots in the island. More than 150 Tamils were burnt or hacked to death and million rupees worth of properties belonging to Tamils were looted and destroyed.\n\nYear\n\nKilling\n\nRape\n\nInjuries\n\nDisplaced\n\n1956\n\n150\n\n20\n\n300\n\n3000\n\n1957 Soon after the ÒSinhala Only ActÓ was passed in Parliament, talks were initiated between the Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and the Federal Party leader S. J. V. Chelvanayagam.\n\nOn 26 July an agreement known as \"Band Chieva\" pact was signed between Bandaranayake and Chevanayagam. This agreement was based on a quasi federal system devolving certain powers to the Tamils in the North East provinces.\n\nWithin a week of signing the ÒBanda-ChelvaÓ pact, it was unilaterally abrogated by the Prime Minister Bandaranaike due to vehement protests staged by the UNP, Buddhist clergy and SLFP. J R Jeyawardena of United National Party-UNP undertook a march to Kandy in protest against this pact.\n\n1958 Anti-Tamil pogrom broke out in the island. Many Tamils were massacred and million of rupees worth of properties belonging to the Tamils were looted and destroyed.\n\nYear\n\nKilling\n\nRape\n\nInjuries\n\nDisplaced\n\n1958\n\n355\n\n100\n\n350\n\n35000\n\n1965 Dudley Senanayake leader of the UNP formed the government with the help of the Federal Party and other parties.\n\nTalks were held between the Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and S. J. V. Chelvanayagam.\n\nOn 24 March, an agreement known as \"Dudley-Cheva\" Pact was signed between Dudley Senanayake and S. J. V. Chelvanayagam.\n\nThe agreement was abandoned without being implemented due to opposition from the SLFP, the Buddhist clergy, and UNP backbenchers.\n\n1971 Armed revolution by the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna was suppressed by Srimavoa Bandaranayke. Thousands of Sinhala JVP youths were killed.\n\nTalks were held between various Tamils leaders and Srimavo Bandaranayake on constitutional amendments.\n\nNo agreement was reached but the Sinhala leaders went ahead undeterred with their republican constitution amending the minimum safeguards granted to Tamils by the earlier constitution.\n\n1972 Ceylon became a ÒRepublicÓ on 22 May and Ceylon was officially renamed as the ÒRepublic of SRI LANKAÓ\n\nThe United Front government enacted a Sinhala-Supremacist \"Republican Constitution\" for the country, which made Buddhism the state religion.\n\nFormation of Tamil United Front (TUF) comprising Federal Party led by, S. J. V. Chelvanayagam, Tamil Congress (TC) led by GG Ponnambalam, and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) led by Savariamoorthy Thondaman.\n\nState discrimination against Tamil students' admission to Universities reached the peak with the introduction of \"Standardisation\". University admission based on merit was abandoned deliberately to stop Tamil students entering Universities.\n\nA youth group comprising self-sacrificing and disciplined youths named Tamil New Tigers (TNT) was formed by Mr. V. Pirabaharan to fight for the right to self-determination of the Tamils in the North East.\n\n1974 On 10 January, Sinhalese Police unleashed an unprovoked violent attack on those attending the prestigious Ò4th Tamil Research ConferenceÓ in Jaffna, leaving nine innocent civilians dead.\n\n6\n\n1975 On 5 May the Tamil New Tigers -TNT was renamed as Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ­ LTTE. Mr. V. Pirabaharan was named the Chairman and military commander of the LTTE.\n\n1977 In July, Tamil United Liberation Front-TULF, contested and won overwhelmingly at the Parliamentary election giving them a mandate to establish the ÒRight to Self-determinationÓ of Tamil Eelam in the North East. J. R. Jeyewardena of UNP became the Prime Minister, with a five-sixth majority in the Parliament. The TULF became the major opposition party in the parliament.\n\nTalks took place between Prime Minister J.R. Jayawardena and the Tamil United Liberation Front. No agreement was reached. Anti-Tamil pogrom occurred immediately after elections in the areas where Sinhalese were in the majority killing hundreds of Tamils.\n\nYear\n\nArrest/Torture\n\nKilling\n\nRape\n\nInjuries\n\nDisplaced\n\n1974\n\n25\n\n9\n\n15\n\n1977\n\n45\n\n150\n\n90\n\n35\n\n15000\n\n1979 The government enacted the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), banning the Tamil militant organisations. On 11 July, the Jaffna peninsula was brought effectively under martial law under Public Security ordinance. Anti-Tamil pogrom broke out in the island. Many Tamils were killed and properties belonging to Tamils were looted and destroyed.\n\nYear\n\nArrest/Torture\n\nDisap.\n\nKilling\n\nRape\n\nInjuries\n\n1979\n\n150\n\n22\n\n13\n\n13\n\n15\n\n1981 In June, another anti-Tamil pogrom was unleashed. Increased military repression in the North. The Jaffna Public Library was burnt down by the Sri Lankan armed forces, allegedly under the direction of two senior government ministers, Gamini Dissanayake and Cyril Matthew. 95,000 volumes of books including numerous culturally important and irreplaceable manuscripts and the buildings were totally destroyed by arson. The Jaffna city market, the office of the Tamils daily newspaper ÒEelanaduÓ, the office of the political party TULF, etc were burnt down by the Sri Lanka security forces.\n\nYear\n\nTorture\n\nDisap.\n\nKilling\n\nRape\n\nInjuries\n\nDisplaced\n\n1981\n\n200\n\n4\n\n35\n\n50\n\n37\n\n5000\n\n1982 Government sponsored a Sinhala settlement in the Tamil populated Mullaitivu.\n\n1983 Major anti-Tamil pogrom took place in July all over the island with the buoyed up support of the government. During the four days riots, more than 6,000 Tamils were killed and over 250,000 were rendered refugees. Thousands of Tamils fled the country and went to India and to Western countries. Billions rupees worth of Tamils properties was looted and destroyed by the Sinhala rioters.\n\nBetween 27-28 July, fifty-three Tamil political prisoners were massacred inside the walls of the Welikadai prison in Colombo by the Sinhala inmates. The government masterminded this massacre and the Sinhala attackers were released from the prison and were rewarded with houses and properties in the Sinhala settlements in the Tamil homeland.\n\nHundreds of youths joined the LTTE movement and the TULF Members of Parliament sought asylum in India.\n\nJ. R. JeyawardenaÕs government enacts the 6th amendment to the constitution and rejected the right to self-determination of the Tamil people in the island on 8th August. This amendment outlawed the mandate voted by the Tamils in 1977 general election. The Sixth amendment and the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 1979 along with the Emergency Law provisions became the instruments through which repression was unleashed on the Tamil people.\n\nYear\n\nArrest/Torture\n\nDisap.\n\nKilling\n\nRape\n\nInjuries\n\nDisplaced\n\n1983\n\n1425\n\n571\n\n6000\n\n750\n\n3383\n\n250000\n\n1984 At the beginning of EELAM WAR-I.\n\n1985-87 State repression and counter attacks intensified in the North East resulting in all-out war between the Sri Lankan state and the LTTE. LTTE effectively took control of the Jaffna peninsula and other Northern areas.\n\n7\n\n1986 In November, talks between the LTTE representatives and President J. R. Jeyawardena took place through the mediation of the Indian Prime minister in Bangalore, India.\n\n1987 On the 29th July 1987, a peace accord known as ÒIndo-LankaÓ pact was signed between Sri Lanka and India. Even though this accord purported to bring an end to the islandÕs ethnic crisis, it was signed by India and Sri Lanka without any consultation with LTTE and the Tamils of the North East of the Island.\n\nThe LTTEÕs first public meeting was held in Suthumalai on 4 August 1987. The LTTE Leader Mr. PirabaharanÕs speech in this meeting became known as the ÒSuthumalai DeclarationÓ.\n\n1989 Talks between the LTTE the President Premadasa took place in Colombo. LTTEÕs chief negotiator Dr. Anton Balasingham, Mrs Adel Balasingham and many other LTTE high-level leaders took part in the talks.\n\n1990 At the beginning of EELAM WAR ­ II. Hostilities broke out again between the Sri Lankan forces and the LTTE. Economic blockade was imposed causing severe shortage of food and medicine in the North\n\n1994 The People's Alliance led by Chandrika Kumaratunge won the Parliamentary elections with the pledge to \"end the war and bring peace\". The LTTE unilaterally announced a temporary ceasefire to welcome the change of government.\n\nTalks between the LTTE and the PA government led by President Chandrika Kumaratunga commenced in Jaffna. Kumaratunge won the Presidential election. LTTE chief negotiator Dr. Anton Balasingham, and many other LTTE high-level leaders participated in the talks.\n\n1995 On 5 January, the Government of Sri Lanka (President Chandrika) and the LTTE (Leader V. Pirabahakaran) signed an agreement for cessation of hostilities. The Government announced lifting of the economic embargo on some items only on paper, but the embargo continued. Later Chandrika government argued that there was no such thing as an economic embargo in the Tamil region. This was considered by civil society and the international humanitarian organisations as an ÒUtter lie with hidden agendaÓ.\n\nThe LTTE gave a two-week ultimatum in March to the government to implement what they had promised to the civilians. This ultimatum was later extended by another three weeks until April 19th. Talks ended in failure.\n\nGovernment launched a major offensive in July in several parts of the Jaffna peninsula after imposing a press censorship. This was the beginning of EELAM WAR-III.\n\n2001 The LTTE have announced unilateral cease-fires many a time. One lasted for four months. President ChandrikaÕs government refused to reciprocate the cease-fire declared by the LTTE and opted to continue with its military agenda.\n\nThe Tamil political parties formed a front known as the ÒTamil National Alliance (TNA)Ó and contested the Parliament elections in the North East on the 5th December 2001 and won in 16 electorates. TNAÕs Election manifesto.\n\nIn December, the UNP government headed by the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe came into power with the mandate for peace and negotiations with LTTE. The LTTE declared a one month cease-fire and it was renewed. The government also declared one month cease-fire and renewed it.\n\n2002 LTTE released 10 prisoners of war as a gesture of good will for peace.\n\nThe Norwegian government re-activated its peace role. The Norwegian delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesenand and Mr. Eric Solheim met with the LTTE chief negotiator Dr. Anton Balasingham in London and the Prime Minister and other ministers in Sri Lanka.\n\nOn 21 February, an historic agreement, a ÒMemorandum of UnderstandingÓ was signed between Mr. V. Pirabaharan, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ­ LTTE, and the Sri Lanka Prime Minister Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe. This MOU was worked out under the facilitation of the Norwegian government.\n\n2003 As there is non implimentation of the out come of talks, in May, the peace talks between the LTTE and the government Sri Lanka came to a halt.\n\nIn November, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) submitted its proposals for Interim Self-Governing Authority – IGSA in the North East region to the Sri Lankan Government through the Norwegian facilitators on November.\n\nThis proposal was totaly ignored by the Singhala leaders.\n\n8\n\n2004 In the General elections the political party \"Tamil National Alliance (TNA)\" won overwhelmingly in 22 electorates in the Tamil region, North East.\n\nTheir election manifesto stated, \"Accepting LTTEÕs leadership as the national leadership of the Tamil Eelam Tamils and the Liberation Tigers as the sole and authentic representatives of the Tamil people, let us devote our full cooperation for the ideals of the Liberation TigersÕ struggle with honesty and steadfastness\".\n\n2005 In November, Mahinda Rajapaksa won the Presidential election with the support of the Sinhala extreme political parties.\n\n2006 In February, and October. 1st round of peace talks in Geneva was after two and a half years of interval. As there is non implimentation of the agreement signed in the 1st round of peace talks in Geneva, once again the 2nd round of peace talks came to a stalemate in October.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPeace talks between\n\nTamil and Singhala leaders since 1927\n\nYear Talks\n\n1927-1931 Ramanathan brothers had talks with Sinhala leaders when the Donoughmore Commission announced its recommendations in 1927\n\n1957Sinhala Only Act.\n\nTalks between S.

Although the Tamils protested, the Colombo administration ignored the Tamils and settled Sinhalese in these regions.\n\nApproximately 7,500 sq.km of Tamil land was plundered by the Sinhala GovernmentÕs Demarcation and Resettlement Plan when it came into operation. This has been taking place over the last forty years.\n\nBefore 1833, 25% of Tamil speaking people occupied 35% of land, which was in their administration as Tamil ancestral homeland. In 1901 this area shrunk from 35% to 29%.\n\nWithin 162 years the Sinhalese government under its crafty Demarcation and Resettlement Plan has plundered 50% of the Tamil ancestral homeland and is still attempting to colonise more and more!\n\nEthnic cleansing\n\nOn 7 June 2007\n\n* 500 Tamils were forcefully expelled from the lodges in Colombo and sent out of Colombo to Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Vavuniya with Police escort\n\n* Further 400 are being detained in Police stations in Colombo.\n\nSri Lanka police send Tamils back to their villages\n\nCOLOMBO, June 1 (Reuters) - Ethnic minority Tamils staying in the capital Colombo \"without a valid reason\" are being sent back to their villages in a bid to stamp out rebel attacks, Sri Lanka's police chief said on Friday.\n\nHundreds of minority Tamils, many from poor rural areas, live in boarding houses in Colombo while they work or search for jobs or seek employment abroad.\n\nMany ethnic Tamils in Colombo complain they are being deliberately targeted by the security forces, detained and searched as the state fights a new chapter of a two-decade civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\n11\n\n\"Because there is no a special label to identify an LTTE terrorist and a civilian, we took the decision to send them back to their villages after they finished their work here in Colombo,\" Inspector General of Police Victor Perera told a news conference.\n\n\"Some people who have arrived in Colombo do not have a valid reason to stay,\" he added. \"Anybody can come to Colombo, there is no restriction. But they can't stay loitering in Colombo. We have decided to provide transport facilities for them to go back to their own villages.\"\n\nThe move comes after two suspected Tamil Tiger bomb attacks in the capital in a week and a string in recent months as a conflict that has killed nearly 70,000 people since 1983 deepens.\n\nOfficials suspect that Tiger cells are installed in the capital and seeking to stage attacks. But the planned restriction on Tamils rang alarm bells.\n\n\"If a democratic society takes this course of action, it is unacceptable because it is clearly a serious violation of their human rights,\" said Jehan Perera of the National Peace Council, a non-partisan advisory group. \"This is a very harsh decision.\"\n\n\"This is the first time such a thing has been spoken about officially, so it suggests the conflict is deteriorating,\" he added. \"This is a new low.\"\n\nFighting is now focused on the north after the military captured the Tigers' eastern stronghold, and a string of land and sea battles has killed around 4,000 people since last year.\n\nRanil on forced eviction of Tamils\n\nDaily Mirror, 8 June 2007 - Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, yesterday, compared the plight of the Tamils under the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration, to that of the Jews in Germany during World War 2 and of Black Africans, during the apartheid era in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on the government led eviction of Tamils in Colombo, Mr. Wickremesinghe said that Jews and Black Africans had faced similar persecution in the past, at the hands of Germans and Whites respectively.\n\nHe said the governmentÕs actions violated the Constitution, which clearly stated that all citizens of Sri Lanka must be free from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and had the right to free movement and to choose their area of residence.\n\nÒWe are also concerned about the security of the country. If the government suspects anyone they can produce that person before a magistrate and remand the suspect, or release the person,Ó he said.\n\nHe noted that when people were evicted from the lodgings in such an arbitrary manner, they would return in anger to blast bombs.\n\nMr. Wickremesinghe added that the situation would bring shame upon Sri Lanka at the European Parliament sessions, and queried as to why the government was creating such a crisis for the country.\n\n(Excerpt)\n\nSend Tamils to India – UNP!\n\nBBC Sinhala service, 8 June 2007 - Sri Lanka's main opposition party has requested the giant neighbour to allow minority Tamils to settle in India. The United National Party (UNP) legislator Lakshman Kiriella said the party urges India to allow Tamils to migrate until their safety is guaranteed by the island nation.The UNP made the request after hundreds of Tamils were evicted from Colombo's lodges by the police. (Excerpt)\n\nMahinda 'dividing' Sri Lanka\n\nBBC Sinhala service, 8 June 2007 - Rights activists have accused of President Mahinda Rajapaksa of working on an agenda to divide Sri Lanka between ethnic lines. Protesting the eviction of hundreds of Tamils from the lodges in Colombo, they said Sri Lankan citizens should have the right to live where they like irrespective of their ethnicity.\n\n12\n\nSiritunga Jayasuriya, chairman of Civil Monitoring Committee (CMC), told BBC Sandeshaya that Sri Lanka authorities are trying to alienate Tamils community in Sri Lanka.\n\nWar on terror\n\nPresident's Rajapaksa's administration, he said, is working on an agenda similar to that of President Bush's War on Terror. Jayasuriya accused the authorities of trying to divide Sri Lanka. \"President Rajapaksa has put the first step towards dividing Sri Lanka into separate countries,\" Jayasuriya told bbcsinhala.com. (Excerpt)\n\nWorld War II\n\nThe leader of the Left Front, Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne, questioned under which regulations authorities decided to deport Tamils from Colombo. He compared the eviction of Tamil lodgers to the eviction of Jews by the Nazzis during the second world war. \"The Tamils were taken away like animals without offering any food or water,\" Dr. Karunaratne said. (Excerpt)\n\nThe United States condemns the forced removal of Tamils\n\nJune 8, 2007 - The United States condemns the forced removal of Tamils from Colombo. Such measures violate the Sri Lankan ConstitutionÕs guarantee that every citizen has the right to freedom of movement and choice of residence within Sri Lanka.\n\nThe United States understands and supports Sri LankaÕs obligation to defend itself against terrorism. But this action can only widen the ethnic divide at a time when important efforts are underway to reach a national consensus to end Sri Lanka's nearly quarter-century old conflict.\n\nWe call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to stop the forcible removal of its citizens from Colombo, to make public the destinations of those already removed, and to ensure their safety and well-being.\n\n(The Embassy of the United States – Sri Lanka & Maldives, 8 June 2007)\n\nNorway condemns enforced removal of Tamils from Colombo\n\n09 June 2007 - The full text of the press release by Norweigian Embassy in Colombo concern the forced evication of Tamils from Colombo :\n\n\"Norway condemns yesterdayÕs sudden and enforced removal of civilian Tamils from their dwellings in Colombo.\n\n\"The move by the Colombo police is a clear violation of international human rights law. The Government of Sri Lanka has legitimate security concerns. Moreover, it has the right and obligation to take measures to guarantee the safety of its population. However, such measures should not indiscriminately target Tamils, or any other ethnic group, and should always be in accordance with international human rights law.\n\n\"We urge the Government of Sri Lanka to cease any further enforced removal of Tamils from Colombo, and to consider granting immediate permission to return for those already removed from the city. \"\n\nCanada condemns the forced removal of\n\ncitizens of Tamil origin from Colombo\n\n10 June 2007\n\nThe Canadian High Commission's full text of the press release :\n\n\"Canada condemns the forced removal of citizens of Tamil origin from Colombo back to the conflict zones in the north and the east\".\n\n\"Whilst Canada acknowledges that the Sri Lankan government has the right and the duty to protect itself and its citizens against potential terrorist attacks, such as the reprehensible bombings in Colombo Fort and Rathmalana in recent weeks, the heavy-handedness of this sweeping action will only alienate the vast majority of innocent Tamils and further complicate the search for a durable peace settlement .\"\n\n13\n\n\"Canada welcomes the stay issued by the Supreme Court which prevents further removals and notes that President Rajapakse has directed that these people be returned to Colombo if they wish.\"\n\n\"Canada reiterates that there cannot be a military solution to the conflict that has besieged this Island for more than 20 years and reaffirms the need for a political solution where the rights and aspirations of all citizens of Sri Lanka can be respected.\"\n\nIndian PM concerned over eviction of Sri Lankan Tamils\n\n10 June 2007\n\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh Saturday expressed concern over the eviction of minority Sri Lankan Tamils from the capital Colombo and hoped 'better sense will prevail' in the troubled nation.\n\n'On attempt to expel Tamils from Colombo, Sri Lanka, we shared our anxiety with important world leaders,' the prime minister said while returning from Germany where he attended the G8 Outreach Summit.\n\n'Hope better sense will prevail. It involves human rights of citizens,' added the prime minister, referring to a pre-dawn raid by the armed police Thursday on the temporary lodgings of Tamils in Colombo and forcing them go return to the northern and eastern provinces.\n\n'I heard that this move has been stayed by their Supreme Court.

(Excerpt)\n\nEviction is not Ôwinning hearts and mindsÕ\n\nBy Shakuntala Perera\n\n(Daily Mirror – 30 August 2007)\n\nNationalist politics invariably crossing over to various levels of extremism have always been the bane of Sri Lanka. Such opportunist politics have always beein in the way of the country reaching its development goals. It has more importantly been the biggest obstacle in the way of minorities receiving their due. But, never in the history of this country has the situation dropped to the depths that they have today.\n\nAllegations of attempts to change the demography of the country, especially with regard to the contentious Eastern and Northern provinces, increase at an alarming rate. Several development plans of the government especially in the East is showing strong moves to this end.\n\nThe newly ÔliberatedÕ Eastern province is today a volcano awaiting eruption. The political agendas of various nationalist groups are threatening the peace of the province as never before. More seriously, they are threatening the lives of innocent people caught in between.\n\nFollowing the first movement of displaced persons, 6,000 families, approx 30,000 persons, took place in April 2006 from the Trincomalee District to the Batticaloa District after the Mavil Aaru clashes between the Government and the LTTE. The IDPs first moved from Trincomalee to Vaharai in the Batticaloa district, then in late 2006 from Vaharai to Batticaloa. The third movement of persons was from West Batticaloa to Batticaloa East.\n\n14\n\nThe resettlement plans of the government are accused of attempts to ÔSinhaliseÕ the province. The allegation is strongly contributed to by clear moves to cement the demands by religious foundations.\n\nBoth humanitarian agencies operating in the areas and the people left destitute confirm that there were clear moves by certain political organizations to settle Sinhala families within Muslim villages have only poured fuel to the sensitivities of the area. The anger rising out of the Muslim community is not to be ignored. Such anger has the potential to grow in to militancy as we experience with the LTTE. The frustrations growing out of the situation are not to be ignored.\n\nThe government by Gazette notification No 1467/3 Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No 40(1978), declared a new High Security Zone covering Sampur and Muttur East on 16 February 2007. The declaration of HSZ for an Economic Zone will lead to the displacement of thousands. The government has reportedly already taken action to acquire land for relocation of said displaced families. Eastern Security Forces Commander Parakrama Pannipitiya has been appointed as the Competent Authority for the implementation of the regulations.\n\nThere are suspicions that Ôa new and trustworthy work force and new communities, most likely Sinhala will be moved into Trincomalee, Ôdramatically impacting on the demography and the ethnic balance in the Trincomalee District.Õ Already local communities are expressing fears that their areas are being marginalized and their needs and rights are being ignored in the proposed development plans.\n\nMoves under the BOI Trincomalee Development Plan, to establish a nature park and in Seenanveli, north of Illankaiturai Muhattuvaram, a HSZ and a special fishing zone are not without their questionable implications. The residents, most of them Tamils of Veddha descent, from about 8 villages, have been transported and virtually dumped in the open. ÔThey are prevented from going home on the pretext of landmines while their meagre possessions have been reportedly looted by ÔSinhaleseÕ from the Mahindapura colony, acting allegedly in cooperation with the ArmyÕ. The army is also engaged in constructing a Buddhist Temple, Samudragiri Vihara, in Seenanveli.\n\nThe Coalition of Muslims and Tamils for Peace and Coexistence (CMTPC) maintain the allegations have a sound basis. They allege that the current development plan for Trincomalee or the soon to be unveiled Eastern Development Plan has elements contributing to the mistrust. ÔThis concern of minority communities needs to be addressed and their fears allayed as speedily as possibleÕ they maintain.\n\nCertainly the eviction of 251 resettled farmers from Arafa Nagar on 10th, August, without prior notice by the military, demonstrates that it is not purely security concerns that keep the Tamils out of their lands. Such actions and in some instances obstacles placed in the way of resettlement are prompted more by ethnic considerations than by security safeguards. These Muslim families who earlier received the green light to rebuild their lives and continue farming from the security forces were suddenly evicted. All hopes of bringing some normalcy to their hopeless lives were short lived, they found. Five months to be exact.\n\nA board declaring it a High Security Zone was erected on August 10, with a warning issued against trespasses. Trespassers were threatened with death. It is such harsh decisions by the State that are pushing the minority communities further and further awy from the Centre. These are far from the ambitious plans that the government spoke about to Ôwin hearts and mindsÕ of the liberated people. In effect these and many other similar examples are pushing the people towards the LTTE. There are serious questions raised if the demands of the LTTE are not justified. Pertinent questions are being asked on the intentions of the government policy in this regard. The people want to know if liberation from one terror group was only going to push them towards another dictatorial rule.\n\nSouth Asians for Human Rights last week charged against the moves to Sinhalise the area. ÔAppointment of numerous Sinhala government officials to the Provincial Council in the East after the de-merger of the Northern and Eastern province; establishment of Sinhala resettlements in Ampara; and building Viharas in Pottuvil, a predominantly Muslim area. The Muslim people, correctly, viewed themselves as being stuck between Sinhala and Tamil nationalisms,Õ they allege.\n\nThe concern of international communities canÕt be ignored in this scenario. Human rights violations, what ever form they take must remain the necessary concern of the international stakeholders. Attempts to antagonize them would not help the government in any way. The fact remains that all democratic governments are accountable at some point. It is irrelevant what their interpretation of liberation is. There is simply no justification for the human cost of the most ÔnobleÕ of causes.\n\n15\n\nJournalists and other staff\n\nkilled, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka\n\n1990-2000\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\nDate\n\nName of victim\n\nReporting for\n\nIncident\n\n18/02/1990\n\nRichard de Zoysa (journalist for UN funded Rome based agency - IPS)\n\nInternational Press Service\n\nAbducted in and shot dead in Colombo by the Sri Lanka military intelligence.\n\n14/05/1999\n\nSri Lal Priyantha\n\nLakbima\n\nArrested by the Police\n\n15/07/1999\n\nTen journalists\n\nFreelance & News\n\nAssaulted by the Police\n\n21/07/1999\n\nSeveral journalists\n\nFreelance & News Papers\n\nVictims of violence by PSD (Presidential Security Division)\n\n07/09/1999\n\nRohana Kumara\n\nEditor-Satana\n\nShot dead in suburb of Colombo believed to by the PSD\n\n27/09/1999\n\nSusannah Price (British)\n\nBBC\n\nReceived death threats by telephone\n\n02/11/1999\n\nNadarajah Atputharajah\n\nThinamurusu\n\nShot dead by EPDP in Colombo\n\n03/04/2000\n\nAiyathurai Nadesan\n\nVirakesari\n\nGrenade attack at his home in Batticaloa\n\n20/10/2000\n\nMylvaganam Nirmalarajan\n\nBBC & IBC, UK\n\nShot dead at his home in Jaffna by EPDP\n\nJournalists and other staff killed, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka - 2001\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\n17\n\nJournalists and other staff killed, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka - 2002\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\n18\n\nJournalists and other staff killed, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka - 2003\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\n19\n\nJournalists and other staff killed, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka - 2004\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\nJournalists and other staff killed, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka - 2005\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\n20\n\nJournalists and other staff killed, attacked and harassed in Sri Lanka - 2006\n\nTamil Centre for Human Rights – TCHR / Centre Tamoul pour les Droits des l'Homme, France\n\n(many more to be included)\n\nDate\n\nName of victim\n\nReporting for\n\nIncident\n\n24/01/2006\n\nSubramaniyam Sugirdharajan (SSR)\n\nSudar Oli\n\nShot dead in Trincomalee by paramilitary forces working with the Sri Lanka Army\n\n02/05/2006\n\nSuresh Kumar - Marketing Manager\n\nRanjith Kumar\n\nUthayan\n\nShot dead in \"Uthayan\" office in Jaffna by EPDP members.

What other conclusion is possible when in the face of this long and protracted war, neither the Commission nor the Sub-Commission has issued a resolution since 1987? Have these bodies not paid any attention to the reports of the Commission's Working Groups and Rapporteurs? Are these bodies unaware that Sri Lanka is just behind Iraq in disappearances and that almost all the disappeared are Tamils? \"\n\n\"Are the Tamil people not as fashionable as the Bosnians? Is the fact that the Tamil people are historically Hindu a problem, seeing that so few other countries are Hindu? Is it because certain foreign powers have such an interest in Trincomalee harbour (in the Tamil areas) for their geo political control of the region? Why is it that the international community imposes sanctions on the Republic of Yugoslavia because of the practically identical situation in Kosovo and says not a word about Sri Lanka?\" (In a Statement by Karen Parker – The chief delegate of the International Educational Development/Humanitarian Law Project in the 50th session of the UN Sub Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities - 5 August 1998)\n\nUN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n61st SESSIONS MARCH/APRIL 2005\n\nInternational League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples – LIDLIP\n\nOral Intervention by Verena Graf, Secretary General of the International League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples, NGO with Special Consultative Status at the United Nations, under agenda (item 5) on the right of peoples to self-determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation, 18 March 2005\n\n\"The hopes for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Sri Lanka in the wake of the ceasefire agreement of February 2002 between the then government and the LTTE as sole authentic representative of the Sri Lankan Tamils have largely proved illusory.\n\n\"Long before disaster struck the island on December 26, 2004, negotiations had been suspended, cooperation largely ceased in the face of the continued occupation of huge tracts of land in the North East by the Sri Lankan army in the name of 'high security zones', of hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons waiting in vain to be able to return to their homes, of lack of investment for the reconstruction of the destroyed countryside.\n\n\"The new government that came to power in 2004 has not advanced the peace process, on the contrary it contains parties totally opposed to any negotiated settlement. If anything, the tsunami that has particularly affected the coastal areas in the North East, already suffering from war related destruction and very poor in comparison to the rest of country, has worsened the situation.\n\n\"While it galvanised the common people of all communities to come to each others help, the government did not follow suit. Instead of a joined effort at reconstruction and national integration the international aid has been instrumentalised for political purposes.\n\nIn the name of relief measures, the distribution of aid and the planning for reconstruction have been highly centralised in the president's office and handpicked committees at the expense of the immediate victims, including local NGOs or the Tamil Rehablitation Organisation working in the LTTE controlled areas.\n\n\"International media accounts as well as local parliamentarians have complained of government inefficiency, if not outright discrimination of the people in the North East, that includes Tamils and Muslims.\n\nMore over, emergency regulations have been reintroduced, and the army put in charge of the welfare centers. Following the most recent official arms` purchases or the government`s refusal to allow the UN Secretary General in early January to visit LTTE controlled areas devastated by the tsunami, have further raised suspicion that the government`s true intentions aim not just at isolating the Tamils and their leaders but to use the catastrophe to change the balance of forces on the ground and to effectively renounce any negotiations.\n\n103\n\n\"In the Norwegian facilitated peace talks, the LTTE had agreed to renounce for the time being the Sri Lankan Tamils' right as a nation for an independent homeland Tamil Eelam and to explore the possibilities to redress decades of collective discrimination within the frame-work of large-scale internal autonomy.\n\n\"The developments during the last three years compounded by the post- tsunami experiences raise the specter that time is running out; that there is no hope for the Tamils within a united Sri Lanka, that their only chance lies in fighting for external self-determination.\"\n\nUN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n61st SESSIONS MARCH/APRIL 2005\n\nInternational Association of Democratic Lawyers - IADL\n\nOral intervention made by Deirdre McConnell, International Association of Democratic Lawyers under Agenda Item 9: Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world, 22 March 2005\n\nMr Chairman,\n\nGeneral Assembly resolution 32/130 states that in approaching human rights questions within the United Nations system, the international community should accord priority to search for solutions to mass and flagrant human rights violations.\n\nIn the island of Sri Lanka, the Tamil peopleÕs human rights and fundamental freedoms have been violated for more than fifty years. Since 1948, legislation has denied the rights of Tamils, in citizenship, language, education, religion, land and other areas.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s the Tamil peopleÕs non-violent struggle for equality, justice and dignity was crushed by violent military repression, followed by horrific pogroms of genocidal proportions in which thousands of Tamils were killed. These persistent attacks on the Tamil community eventually gave rise to armed conflict.\n\nDuring twenty years of war over 79,000 Tamils have been killed or ÒdisappearedÓ; 500,000 have sought political asylum in Europe and other countries and 2375 buildings of religious places of worship have been destroyed in the North East, the traditional Tamil homeland area, in aerial bombings and artillery shelling by military forces.\n\nRape and murder used as a weapon of war systematically by regular armed forces, with impunity, has inflicted horrendous suffering on thousands of Tamil women.\n\nThere have been no independent inquiries into any of the above endemic and chronic violations against Tamils, despite repeated calls by human rights organisations.\n\nMr Chairman,\n\nThe alleviation of the suffering of the Tamil people, thereby creating conditions of normalcy in which peace talks could begin, is central to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam signed more than three years ago, with the facilitation of the Royal Norwegian Government.\n\nIt is sad to note that although the ceasefire has created normalcy in the seven Southern provinces, normalcy does not exist for the people in the North East.\n\nIn breach of CFA article 2.1 and 2.5 people are harassed at checkpoints in the NorthEast. Over the last year the incidence of harassment, rape and sexual assault of Tamil civilians by regular armed forces has increased.\n\nViolating CFA article 2.2, the army continue to occupy temples and churches in the North East; violating article 2.3 school buildings are still occupied by the Sri Lanka army. In a few cases, the army has withdrawn, but ÒHigh Security ZonesÓ have been immediately built nearby.\n\nMany people in civil society are asking, Ò ÔSecurityÕ – for whom? Certainly not the security of local Tamil peopleÓ. The situation of IDPs remains critical, they are prevented from resettling in their own homes due to these militarised zones.\n\nFishermen are still severely restricted in pursuing their livelihood, they are persistently harassed and intimidated by Navy and armed forces.\n\nIn violation of article 1.8 of the CFA, the government has not disarmed paramilitaries nor ensured they leave the North East. On the contrary, these paramilitaries working with the Sri Lanka armed forces have been responsible for recent assassinations in the East, of human rights activists and political leaders and activists, causing terror and destabilisation.\n\n104\n\nMr Chairman,\n\nIt was the coastal parts of the North East which were the worst affected when the disastrous tsunami recently struck the island on December 26 last year. The majority of the casualties were Tamils from the North East. 24,500 Tamil people were killed by the tsunami and 10,000 are missing; nearly 700,000 Tamils were displaced and over 120,000 houses in Tamil areas were completely damaged.\n\nMr Chairman,\n\nThe authorities prevented the UN Secretary General from making a humanitarian visit, which he requested, to the North East, the areas in the island most affected by the tsunami. This is a serious violation of the UN Charter, Chapter XV Article 100 by the Sri Lankan government.\n\nIn conclusion, this Commission has the capability, the ability and the authority to immediately send a mission to Sri Lanka and ensure that in the affected areas the victims of these human rights violations receive redress. We urge the Commission to take urgent action.\n\nUN SUB COMMISSION ON THE PROMOTION\n\n& PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n58th SESSIONS - AUGUST 2006\n\nInternational Educational Development\n\nOral intervention made by Karen Parker, International Educational Development under Agenda Item 2 at Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, 58th Session, 14 August 2006\n\nSub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights\n\nFifty-eighth session\n\nAgenda item 2\n\nStatement of International Educational Development, Inc.,\n\nWhile we welcome the action undertaken by the Human Rights Council in regards to attacks on protected facilities and persons under the Geneva Conventions and humanitarian law as a whole in Lebanon, the Council has not called for action regarding several other conflicts in which targeting of protected facilities and persons is equally serious. One of these is the conflict in Sri Lanka, where since the elections in November there has been the worst levels of fighting since the 2002 Cease Fire Agreement. In the past few weeks, the level of fighting has increased dramatically, as have the numbers of military operations of the government armed forces flagrantly targeting protected facilities and persons.\n\nFor example, on 6 August 2006 17 humanitarian aid workers from the French NGO Action Contre le Faim were brutally massacred in the government-controlled areas in Trincomalee, prompting 3 independent experts of the Council (H.Jilani, human rights defenders; P. Alston, extrajudicial, arbitrary and summary executions; J. Ziegler, the right to food) to issue a press release on 11 August 2006 in which they state: Òthe deliberate targeting of humanitarian workers is a serious violation of the basic principles of international and humanitarian law and the Declaration of Human Rights Defenders.Ó Also on 6 August 2006, several members of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission narrowly escaped attacks from the government forces in Maavil Aaru. On 9 August 2006 government forces attacked an ambulance belonging to Nedunkerni hospital killing a doctor, 2 nurses and the driver. On 14th of August, the government forces deliberately bombed a girlÕs orphanage killing 60 girls and wounding 120 who were between the ages of 15 and 18. An attack on St. Philip Mary church in Allaipiddy left 15 dead and more than 100 injured.\n\nSince the renewed fighting, there are more than 100,000 newly displaced, many without food or water. UNICEF and the UNHRC report the continued blockage by the government forces of urgently needed aid to the rapidly increasing numbers of displaced, prompting the UN officer in Sri Lanka to express concern. UNHCR reports that of the over 40,000 newly displaced in Muttar, more than half are women and children, but in a statement on 8 August 2004 indicated they were not allowed access.\n\nThe situation of Tamil civilians is made much worse because so many Tamils are still displaced by the Tsunami and because most of the international aid raised on their behalf was not allowed to be delivered. For example, the American Red Cross, that received hundreds of thousands of $$US for Tsunami victims in Sri Lanka, was told by US authorities that they could not distribute it in the Tamil areas.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government also severely restricted aid to the Tamil Tsunami victims, only allowing aid raised by the Tamil diaspora and then restricting that as well. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of Tamil refugees who have sought and obtained asylum outside of Sri Lanka, the current figures of internally displaced indicates nearly 1/3 of the entire Tamil population is displaced or in exile.\n\n105\n\nWe have long indicated to the Sub-Commission that the United States geopolitical interests in ports and airfields in the Tamil areas has been a major impediment to resolving this long conflict and we invite you to consult our written statements in this regard that we submitted to both the Sub-Commission and the Commission. In light of this we were alarmed by recent pronouncements in Colombo and elsewhere by high State Department officials: in our view the US has given the government of Sri Lanka a Ògreen lightÓ to undertake actions that violate humanitarian law under the pretext that due to the unabated demonization of the Tamils by Sri Lankan and US authorities, no one will dare defend them, and in any case, no one will be able to do anything about it.\n\nHowever, because now the UN independent experts, UNICEF and UNHCR have spoken up, and because the UN is in a process to reform its work, we hope that the Sub-Commission, which as rightly undertaken to address attacks against medical and other protected persons in time of war, will inform the Council of its concerns regarding Sri Lanka and the situation of the Tamil people and will request that the Council act. (Excerpt)\n\nUN SUB COMMISSION ON THE PROMOTION &\n\nPROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n58th SESSIONS - AUGUST 2006\n\nInterfaith International, Geneva, Switzerland\n\nOral intervention made by Deirdre McConnell, Interfaith International, Geneva, Switzerland, under Agenda item 5(a) Racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia\n\nMr Chairperson,\n\nInterfaith International is happy to note that the Sub Commission has prevention of discrimination as one of its agenda items, especially at a crucial time of this august forum.\n\nIn todayÕs world various types of discrimination have paved the way towards Civil war, Ethnic Conflict, Armed conflict, and so on. Many of these conflicts, fought in exercise of the Right to self-determination, have as their ultimate goal, a durable solution to the political problems which are based on discrimination and xenophobia.\n\nIn the past, this august forum has heard much about the discriminatory application of law and practise of the Sri Lanka government against the Tamil people, therefore we do not need to go into much detail.\n\nSince Independence, Sinhala dominated governments brought much systematic discriminative legislation against Tamil people.\n\nAs soon as Sinhala leaders obtained power in 1948, the Tamils working on the tea plantations were disfranchised and their citizenship was denied. A one language Act (Sinhala only) was forcefully introduced by the Sinhala politicians and nine (1956, 1958, 1961, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1981, 1982 and 1983) state sponsored anti-Tamil pogroms destroyed the economy and the cultural heritage of the Tamil people. In the meantime, the Tamil politicians of the day protested - against these denials of political rights, Sinhala colonisation in the Tamil regions and destruction of Tamils properties, demanding justice, by non-violent methods, for nearly thirty-five years.\n\nHowever these struggles in and outside of the parliament were continuously suppressed by the Sri Lankan security forces made up of 95% Singhalese. In 1972, discrimination in the education system (standardisation) where Tamil students had to gain more marks than the Singhalese students for University entrance, gave birth to the TamilsÕ militancy in the island.\n\nDuring this period, in the 1977 general elections, the Tamil people in the North East overwhelmingly voted to exercise their right to self-determination. As the Singhala dominated government ignored this democratic mandate and continued to implement their racist policies, an armed conflict was born in the island in 1983.\n\nAfter a long struggle and massive civilian casualties, a defacto government covering 70% of the Tamil hereditary land has been in existence, that is, for the last 15 years. Since 2002, this has been well acknowledged by many foreign dignitaries and diplomats who have visited the NorthEast.\n\nThe Tsunami natural disaster which struck mostly the Tamils areas, caused severe casualties to the Tamil people. Again the people in the North East received discriminatory treatment by the Sri Lankan government. The aid which was sent by the international community was never distributed equally and even the P-TOMS Post-Tsunami agreement for reconstruction of the Tsunami affected areas was blocked by the Sinhala judges in the South.\n\nMr Chairperson,\n\nIt is now four and a half years since the Ceasefire Agreement was signed between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - LTTE and the government of Sri Lanka. There are still 800,000 internally displaced people who are prevented from resettling due to the Sri Lankan military occupation of their land.\n\n106\n\nThe current situation in the island is alarming, human rights violations over the last 10 months have increased disturbingly. A further 60,000 displaced people in the Trincomalee area are being denied food and aid in an embargo imposed by the government. More than 700 Tamil civilians have been killed by the security forces and the paramilitaries working with them since November 2005. In the last week it appears that once again the government has declared war on the Tamil people. The ceasefire agreement has been violated several times, especially since last April with the beginning of Aerial bombardment of Tamil areas by the Sri Lankan air force.\n\nOn Monday 14 August 2006, sixty-one school girls were killed and 129 seriously injured in the brutal and callous deliberate bombing of a childrenÕs home in Mullaitivu in broad daylight, by the Sri Lanka Air Force. Soon after this bombing the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), and UNICEF personnel, visited the spot and confirmed that it is a childrenÕs home known as Sencholai and not a military installation as claimed by the Sri Lanka Government.\n\nThe shelling and bombings from land, air and sea by the Sri Lankan security forces in the Tamil regions have caused severe destruction to Tamil homes and lives, property, public buildings, and cultural places. These and many other actions of the Sri Lanka government are persistently in serious breach of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nOn Saturday 5th August, 17 Tamil humanitarian workers, from the French International Non-Governmental Organisation Action Contre la Faim, were massacred at point blank range by government security forces. UN VIPs in the field of human rights, the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani; the Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial, arbitrary and summary executions, Prof Philip Alston and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Jean Ziegler, jointly made a statement on 11 August, expressing serious concerns and calling for a vigorous independent investigation to be held and the perpetrators to be brought to justice. They urged the government to render the findings public.\n\nAttacks on Tamil journalists, parliamentarians and human rights defenders have escalated. Journalists following up human rights violations have been killed with impunity, by the security forces. Those defending Civil and Political rights and those defending Economic, Social and cultural Rights are also being killed by the Sri Lanka armed forces.\n\nIn a stark incident on 06 August 2006 the SLMM was nearly bombed by the government Air Force which attacked, despite an agreement being in progress concerning the irrigation issue in Trincomalee. This shows how the international monitors are being treated.\n\nWhen speaking from Colombo about the killing of the 17 humanitarian workers, the SLMM Head, Maj. Gen. Ulf Henricsson, told Reuters on 11 August:\n\n\"I have experienced this in the Balkans before. When you're not let in, it's a sign that there's something they want to hide. You have a lot of time to clear it up\"ÉÉÉ..\"They are denying us access to the whole area, so we cannot monitor. There were journalist trips arranged to Muttur last Saturday and Sunday. That was possible, but we had no access. Why? For security reasons? Of course not. There are other reasons. I have recommended to the facilitator -(Norway) to at least consider a withdrawal.\"\n\nSLMMÕs monitors say there is evidence that Sri Lankan troops have been involved in extrajudicial killings of Tamils in the North and East. According to information coming out of the latest fighting in Jaffna, the Tamil people are being prevented from fleeing to safety, by the Sri Lanka security forces.\n\nMr. Chairperson,\n\nThe ethnic conflict in Sri "
