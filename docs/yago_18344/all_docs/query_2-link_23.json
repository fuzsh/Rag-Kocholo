W. Corporate Secretarial (Pvt) Ltd – a firm which provides capital market related services to listed companies.\n\nMrs. Pieris has also served as the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Finance from 2002 to 2004.\n\nShe was a Legal consultant to the Colombo Stock Exchange (2004-2011), a Member of the Committee of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka on Takeovers and Mergers Code, a Member of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and a Member of the Law Commission (2020).\n\nShe served on the Boards of Asia Assert Finance PLC (2012-2021) and Abans Electricals PLC (2012-2021).\n\nPositioned as the leader in wood coatings in Sri Lanka for the past 28 years, JAT is largely recognized for its impeccable drive to constantly innovate and improve its deliverables, by keeping its consumers at the heart of its operations.\n\nWith the appointment of two widely capable and influential figures to its Board of Directors, JAT Holdings will continue to elevate the playing field in Sri Lanka and take the country to new heights.\n\nBusinesscafe - Mr. Devaka Cooray (left) and Mrs. Priyanthi Pieris (right)."
