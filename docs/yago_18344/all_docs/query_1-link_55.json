        "text": "Abstract Food prices have been increasing sharply since 2003. In the globalized world, the transmission of global food price increases to domestic market determines the decision of economic agents and policy makers of a domestic economy. The recent growth of global food prices affects the welfare of poor consumers and producers. In Sri Lanka, large segment of the population spends more than 50 percent of their income on food. Thus, this study investigates and assesses how international food price surge affects domestic inflation process in Sri Lanka. The empirical statistical results are derived by using a battery of parametric and non-parametric econometric techniques using monthly data of price series for the period from 2003M1 to 2013M12. The co-integration analysis results confirm that global food prices, domestic prices are co-integrated. Therefore, Sri Lankan government needs to develop a safety net program for the poor and a longer term poverty reduction strategy. Policy attention needs to shift towards efforts to increase food production. The results of this study have various policy implications for monetary policy, food and agricultural policy and trade policy for Sri Lanka. Keywords: co-integration, error correction model, food price inflation, global price transmission\n\nThe present study investigates the impact of macroeconomic factors on food price inflation in India utilizing the monthly time series during January 2006–March 2019. The long-run relationship is confirmed among the variables using the ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration. The coefficients of long-run estimates show that per capita income, money supply, global food prices, and agricultural wages are positively and significantly impacted food price inflation in both the short and long-run. While food grain availability has a negative and significant impact on food price inflation in both the short-run and long run. Further, the short-run estimates revealed that real exchange rate positively impacts food price inflation. However, the coefficient is insignificant in the short-run. The Granger causality estimates show that a short-run bidirectional causality is confirmed among per capita income, the exchange rate, per capita net availability of food grain and food price inflatio...\n\nFood prices have been increasing sharply since 2003 in Sri Lanka as well as in the world.In the globalized world, the transmission of global food price increases to domestic market determines the decision of economic agents and policy makers of a domestic economy.Thus, this study examines how international food price increases affects domestic inflation dynamic process in Sri Lanka. To assess this purpose, the study uses the VAR Granger causality/Block Exogeneity Wald Tests. The empirical statistical results are derived by using parametric and non-parametric econometric techniques.The data span for this study is from 2003M1 to 2013M12.Granger causality reveals unidirectional causal relationship running from global food price to domestic prices and the past changes of global food price help to explain current changes of domestic prices over and above the study period in Sri Lanka.Therefore, Sri Lankan government needs to develop a safety net program for the poor and a longer term pov...\n\nThis paper conducts a forensic examination of inflation in India with a focus on food price inflation, using a disaggregated high-frequency commodity-level dataset spanning last two decades. First, we document stylized facts about the behavior of overall, food and non-food inflation. Second, we quantify the contribution of specific commodities to food price inflation. We find animal source foods (milk, fish), processed food (sugar, edible oils), fruits and vegetables (e.g., onions), and cereals (rice and wheat) to be the primary drivers. Finally, we conduct case studies of the top contributors. Combining the insights from macro as well as micro analyses, the paper suggests specific policy implications\n\nUsing a vector error correction model (VECM), the paper examines the relative response of food and manufactured prices to change in interest rate and money supply in India during the period 2001:Q1 to 2010:Q2. It finds that, in the long-run, while money supply leads to rise in the prices of both food and manufactured prices, hike in call rate has a negative effect only on manufactured prices. The impact of money supply is, however, more on food prices than on manufactured prices. There is no evidence of long-run neutrality of money, as increase in money supply leads to less than proportionate change in price. In the short-run, there is overshooting in the prices of both food and manufactured products from their respective long-run equilibrium following monetary shocks. The overshooting, however, is more in food prices than in manufactured prices. Further, in the shortrun, call rate has a significant impact only on manufactured prices, while the impact of money supply is significant ...\n\nThis study focuses on the identification of main determinants of food price inflation in Pakistan. Using the data from 1972 to 2008, Johansen’s co-integration technique is utilized to find out the long run relationships among food price inflation and its determinants like inflation expectations, money supply, per capita GDP, support prices, food imports and food exports. Empirical findings prove the long run relationships among food price inflation and its determinants. All the determinants affect food price inflation positively and significantly except money supply which is insignificant with correct positive sign. In the short run, only inflation expectations, support prices and food exports affect the food price inflation. The results reveal that both demand and supply side factors are the determinants food price inflation in Pakistan. However, our study supports the structulists’ point of view of inflation as money supply shows insignificant results."
