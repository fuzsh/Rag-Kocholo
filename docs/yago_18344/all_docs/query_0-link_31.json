        "text": "This paper expands the framework of the Bourdieusian field theory using a world-system theoretical perspective to analyze the global system of social sciences, or what might be called the world-system of knowledge production. The analysis deals with the main agents of the world-system of social sciences, and it also investigates the core-like and periphery-like processes of the system. Our findings affirm that a very characteristic center-periphery structure exists in global social sciences, with a few hegemonic countries and distinctly peripheral world regions. Our analysis not just presents empirical data on power structures in global social sciences but it also offers meaningful typologies for analysis of the roles different world regions play in maintaining the world-system of global knowledge production. The paper also proposes a three-dimensional model by which both geographical and social/institutional center-periphery relations may be analyzed.\n\nKnowledge management practices is the key area for the evolving present higher education system across the country which produce better opportunities for the skill enhancement as per the need of industries. In the post globalisation period, it is great advantages for the academicians to enhance their skill so that they will give right knowledge for the students which make them competitive one in the competitive environment. Today many higher educational institutes introduced new pattern of education like business analyst, it means, trainers will use right tools and appropriate techniques so that they will analysis the subject, forecasting the subject with scientific way. At the same time, globalisation put pressure on the higher educational institutes for create practical oriented environment for the students. It makes the opportunities for expands the education from urban to rural India which can empowers the nation. This study is based on measuring the perception of the academicians related to the impact of the globalisation on knowledge management practices in higher educational institutes. In this study, we have gathered the feedback from the experienced teaching and non teaching employees in different universities and colleges in odisha through standard questionnaire to know the opinion about the climate, culture in the higher educational institutes and how knowledge management practices can successfully implement for boost the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of graduates who can satisfy the employers \" need in the entry level of employability in their future.\n\nBook Description Globalization is a multidimensional concept that encompasses the politico-economic, socio-cultural and educational spheres of contemporary societies across time and space. The ideological convictions and methodological subscriptions of social scientists guide the discourse on globalization to unravel the meanings and implications for institutions, individuals and social groups in shaping and changing their everyday life experiences. Globalization unleashed major lessons and has played a key role in shaping the educational systems of developing countries, including India. In this context, this book: (1) maps the multiple epistemological traditions to approach the conceptual formulations of the globalization of education; (2) examines the socioeconomic context of the globalization of education in India; (3) analyzes the local responses to processes associated with the knowledge discourse; and (4) examines the relation between the globalization of education and its implications on the functioning of institutional structures, such as caste, class, gender, marriage in general, and the education system in particular. The book proposes various secondary readings and empirical observations of the global political and regional social economies that have, in fact, been guiding the Indian education system. The institutional engagement with globalization needs to be located within the framework of social mobility either to extend or retain the social position of groups within the current social hierarchy. This book proposes that the globalization of education not only hegemonizes the nature and direction of education, but also hierarchizes the production and consumption of knowledge systems. The hierarchical knowledge system tends to legitimize market-driven education by simultaneously marginalizing the other multiple streams of knowledge systems. The marginalisation of liberal knowledge creates a one-dimensional pedagogy which tends to erase the tradition of critical reasoning which questions the oppressive elements of the state and suppressive values of the civil society."
