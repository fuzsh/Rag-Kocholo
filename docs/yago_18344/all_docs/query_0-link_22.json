        "text": "Standing from left: Devaka Cooray, Priyanthi Pieris, Richard Gunawardene, Anika Williamson, Hussain Akbarally, Joyce Gunawardene Seated: Chairman Siva Selliah and Managing Director Aelian Gunawardene\n\nJAT Holdings, Sri Lanka’s trusted leader of wood coatings, proudly presents its gender-balanced leadership, inclusive of three ladies of distinction who have been appointed to its high-powered Board of Directors. With the visionary aim to enhance the quality of management decisions, the mixed representation of the Board will bring about a variety of perspectives, ideas, expertise and problem-solving – further positioning JAT Holdings as a game-changer in the corporate world.\n\nWith this specific prescience as its mission, JAT Chairman Dr. Siva Selliah and JAT Managing Director Aelian Gunawardene unanimously determined the tremendous advantage of acknowledging the enormous aptitude in females of power. Moreover, in granting them the platform, authority and freedom of creativity with which to utilise the expertise of each individual, this verdict would further pave the way for women of equal stature to gain the distinction they deserve.\n\nBy bringing a wealth of diversity, not only in providing gender equality, panache and cutting-edge proficiency to the Board, Priyanthi Pieris, Joyce Gunawardene and Anika Williamson eloquently herald a vision of the compelling influential role which modern women will play in the future of the Sri Lankan business model.\n\nPriyanthi Pieris, Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, encompasses nearly 40 years of expertise in the field of Corporate/Securities Law. Currently serving on the Boards of LOLC Finance PLC, Associated Electrical Corporation Ltd. and MTN Corporate Consultants Ltd., Pieris also brings in a wealth of experience gained as the Legal Adviser for the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2011.\n\nJoyce Gunawardene currently serves as an Executive Director to Brush Master Ltd. With over 15 years of experience in the field of Advertising and Promotion, Gunawardene was appointed to the Board of Directors of JAT Holdings in 2015. She holds a B.Sc. Degree in Psychology from the University of NSW Australia.\n\nAnika Williamson currently serves as an Executive Director to JAT Global Ltd. and was appointed to the Board of JAT in 2020. She has over eight years of experience working in finance, import, export and banking industries. In the year 2020, Williamson was appointed as the Finance Director of JAT Property Group Ltd. She holds a Double Degree in Accounting and Entrepreneurship from Curtin University, Australia and was a member of the prestigious Pro Vice Chancellors Chapter.\n\nThe appointment of a well-balanced, diversified Board of Directors will enable a larger pool of ideas, perspectives and expertise, which will further allow the organisation to explore more convenient and efficient methods of obtaining overall organisational goals. Therefore, it is a forgone conclusion that JAT Holdings will continue to carve even more innovations onto the rock-solid fabric of their business model."
