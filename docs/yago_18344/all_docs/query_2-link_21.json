The investor forum also involved a detailed discussion into the company’s operations, financial performance and growth trajectory.\n\nManaged by CAL and NDB Investment Bank, JAT Holdings’ IPO aims to raise Rs. 2.2 billion by offering 82,904,846 ordinary voting shares to the public. The IPO price per share of Rs. 27.00 offers an immediate upside of 21% to an incoming investor on the value per share of Rs. 32.70; derived from a combination of discounted cash flow (DCF) and forward-earnings ratio (PER) valuation methods.\n\nProceeds from the company’s IPO will be used for the company’s near-term objectives of investment in enhancing the existing R&D facility to a fully-fledged, state-of-the-art facility for all coatings, setting up a manufacturing facility in Bangladesh, expanding the WHITE by JAT marketing and development initiatives and setting up a manufacturing facility in East Africa.\n\n“We are incredibly excited as the organisation takes its next step through the nearing IPO. Even though we face challenging times with the COVID-19 pandemic, JAT Holdings has never shied away from making key monumental decisions and large strides towards developing and innovating the current industry landscape,” commented JAT Holdings Founder and Managing Director Aelian Gunawardene. “The virtual investor forum stood as a great opportunity to engage with potential investors and better discuss the specifics of the IPO before the opening date.”\n\nInterested parties can visit ipo.jatholdings.com to refer to the prospectus and obtain more IPO related information.
