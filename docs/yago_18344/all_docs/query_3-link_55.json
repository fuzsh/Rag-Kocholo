        "text": "I'm a fan of every day being a day for truth and reconciliation. The best thing you can do is independent research that includes some human to human interaction. The best thing you can do is talk to real humans whose lives, lineage, and communities have been directly impacted. Remember: your role is to listen. The best thing you can do is not see yourself as being outside of the problem, but rather part of the solution. When you zoom out, what story can you piece together? The best thing you can do is never forget your humanity. One of the greatest fallacies we are conditioned to believe and often accept is that there is more that divides us than unites us. Be a human. #EveryChildMatters #CanadianHeritageMinutes #nationaldayfortruthandreconciliation #truth #land #nature #history #fact #truth #heal #awareness #research #criticalthinking #reels #mindset #love #compassion #curiosity #coach #mentalhealth #success #unity #human #beahuman #peace #forgiveness #reparations #community #explore #Canada\n\nIf love & peace is what you truly want you must be love & peace People carry egoic attachments that's not to be confused with being conceited .It's all the descriptors/labels and accompanying behaviours. Hence the idea of them vs us You vs me . At its extreme and we are most definitely at that point, It's how to create chaos E.g. I am an Audiologist etc but that's a label it's not my identity. No externally acquired titles ,positions are who we truly are. No matter how comfortable they make us feel. But again, where does our values base/opinions arise from. They should stem from a place of love respect truth and honour for all sentient beings. The fact that are passed on generationally via religion, culture & societal conditioning does mean we learn them by rote So do we question them contemplate on them to actually determine their genuine value.? That's why so many are stuck in high functioning auto pilot thinking not discerning Looking not not seeing Hearing not listening Doing not being Reacting not responding Can we all actively and mindfully sit with ourselves and truly contemplate. We all appear to want the same things; to live well and to be well and that only comes from cultivating spaces where love ,respect, honour for all sentient beings can thrive. #love #peace #honour #respect #humanbeings\n\nðŸŒŸ The Power of Kindness: A True Testament of Humanity ðŸŒŸIn a world dominated by fast-paced growth, let's remember the profound impact of cultivating kindness. Our actions speak volumes about who we are as individuals and the legacy we leave behind.It takes a special soul to understand that goodness transcends time and surpasses worldly limitations. Saluting those who nurture the divine mark of a pure heart, setting them apart as cherished ambassadors of humanity.Spread love, elevate others, ignite moments of kindness â€“ for it is through these small deeds that we leave an everlasting impression. Join the movement and let the goodness within us endure!Hashtag your thoughts: #GoodnessEndures #HeartfeltWisdom #ThoughtLeadership #LinkedInForCreators #ViralPost #LinkedInMagic #InspirationalContent"
