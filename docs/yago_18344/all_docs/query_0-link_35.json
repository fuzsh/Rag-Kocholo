        "text": "JAT Holdings has announced the appointment of two industry professionals, Mr. Devaka Cooray and Mrs. Priyanthi Pieris, to its Board of Directors.\n\nThis appointment further strengthens the balance of the JAT Board by increasing the ratio of independent Directors to far greater than all norms and SEC regulations. It also makes JAT Holdings one of the very few, if not the only large conglomerate to have three female Directors on the Board, in addition to having the Director Finance and the Head of Legal of the organisation as females as well.\n\nIn a media release issued by the company, its Chairman Dr. Siva Selliah stated, “The decision to appoint Mr. Cooray and Mrs. Peiris was taken mainly due to their standing in the business and social society and to re-emphasise the transparent governance of the company”.\n\nMr. Cooray is a Fellow Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants of the United Kingdom. Mr. Cooray currently functions as the Managing Director of Management Systems (Pvt) Ltd. while serving as a Director of Hatton National Bank PLC, Life Insurance Corporation (Lanka) Ltd and HVA Foods PLC.\n\nMs. Priyanthi Pieris is an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, a Solicitor of England and Wales. With over 39 years of experience in the field of Corporate/Securities Law, Ms. Pieris’ expertise spans across handling corporate restructuring, privatizations, capital market transactions, take-overs, mergers and amalgamations."
