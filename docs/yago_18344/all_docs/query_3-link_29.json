        "text": "How can it be an End of the Story Amit Kumar, when its just a beginning for me. That 50km ride is in the making at the end of the month….!! I dont have a photo that I can post for a before and after comparison but I have surely changed the belt holes now…! For now, I can only post this photo where I closed all my activity rings on majority of the days.\n\nThis new year has started with a bang. A different kind though, which has been rather unusual of me. Since last 10 years, I never paid attention to my weight and health. Although I continued playing cricket (or shall I say box cricket), I never paid attention to any other outdoor activities and it continued taking a toll on my body. But it all changes from this year...! Inspired by a couple of dearest friends Amit Kumar and Chintan Desai, I took on this enormous challenge of getting back in shape and my show has just begun. Hoping to continue this forever and shed a lot of kilos which I am sure my family and my close friends are dying to see me achieve...! #FromFatToFit #icandoit\n\nWe did it….! 58 weeks of hard work has finally paid off. We are finally live on Gap #Conversion into Barclays Bank US in partnership with Mastercard. Like all big ticket items, this one also tested us a lot. But when the going got tough, we got tougher as a unit and sailed through. All those marathon sessions with Amit Tare, Archna Negi, Rashmi Jahagirdar has paid rich dividends. Couldn’t have been possible without the collaboration our teams had. I must call out the constructive (and sometimes not so very easy) discussions with Aditya Khasnis, Rohit Mahajan, Seeva Selliah, Atul Gopinath, Rajashri Mandal, Neeraj Nangia and Sujit Sankaran Unni...! (Especially Mr. Khasnis who has off-late developed a habit to push me & my team beyond limits to achieve great business outcomes...!) Super support from the entire Infrastructure Leadership Team - Ganesh Badhe, Shalini Jaybhaye, Deepak kaul, Diwakar Patil, Dennis Thomas and Nikhil Chalil. My friends in the Technology Command Centre, under the leadership of Craig Williams, Richard Porter and Sulakshana Kale. During the go-live, these guys played a significant role in ensuring we get all the right level of support. Thanks to Dhana D, Rajesh TK, Nitin Mulay and Latha Ayyar for continuing to provide that much-needed leadership support to us from India. Above all, a very special mention for my mentor and my partner in crime Jered Powell. The guy was there for me at all times. He gets hugs and teddy bears whenever I meet him the next time. And my sincerest Thank You to our fantastic team David Bell, Siva Sandeep Vallapu Reddy, Gaurav Prakash, Manish Gupta, Ryan Mathias, Urvir Palan, Anupma Rathore, Gowtham Srinivasa Raghavan, Rajib Bhaumik, Rani Sattur, Nidhi Khanna, Greta Romano and Akash Jain. What a Show guys….! A huge pat on the back to all of you…! You deserve a break (but dont you go out all at the same time - we still need to monitor this thing in production)"
