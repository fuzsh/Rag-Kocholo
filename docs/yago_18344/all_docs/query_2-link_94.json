        "text": "JAT Holdings, Sri Lanka’s trusted leader in wood coatings, hosted an informative virtual investor forum today (08) for their upcoming Initial Public Offering, following the official launch event held on the same day. The launch event of the IPO was open to the public to participate via Zoom, Facebook Live and YouTube Live, whereas the Virtual Investor Forum was attended by distinguished invitees such as financial analysts, fund managers and other parties interested in the IPO. The investor forum also involved a detailed discussion into the company’s operations, financial performance and growth trajectory.\n\nManaged by CAL and NDB Investment Bank, JAT Holdings’ IPO aims to raise Rs. 2.2 billion by offering 82,904,846 ordinary voting shares to the public. The IPO price per share of Rs. 27.00 offers an immediate upside of 21% to an incoming investor on the value per share of Rs. 32.70; derived from a combination of discounted cash flow (DCF) and forward-earnings ratio (PER) valuation methods.\n\nProceeds from the company’s IPO will be used for the company’s near-term objectives of investment in enhancing the existing R&D facility to a fully-fledged, state-of-the-art facility for all coatings, setting up a manufacturing facility in Bangladesh, expanding the WHITE by JAT marketing and development initiatives and setting up a manufacturing facility in East Africa.\n\n“We are incredibly excited as the organization takes its next step through the nearing IPO. Even though we face challenging times with the COVID-19 pandemic, JAT Holdings has never shied away from making key monumental decisions and large strides towards developing and innovating the current industry landscape,” commented Mr. Aelian Gunawardene, Founder and Managing Director of JAT Holdings. “The virtual investor forum stood as a great opportunity to engage with potential investors and better discuss the specifics of the IPO before the opening date.”\n\nInterested parties can visit ipo.jatholdings.com to refer to the prospectus and obtain more IPO related information.
