        "text": "Dearest Appa, It definately was God's gift for giving me a Father like you who was: Kind, Sharing, Loving and a good-hearted person. You supported me through thick and thin, you were always there for me. I am really sad because you did not tell me any words before you died so I was not prepared. I am really missing you and everyday when I look into your photos, I start crying because I really loved you! Thank You Appa for looking after me and my family! Yours loving daughter, Ganeswary.\n\nGaneswary Patel 25th May 2010\n\nMy Grandfather was much more than just a grandfather he was also a person really close to me that helps me through difficult situations. He was a brilliant grandfather to not only me but to all of his grandchildren. Being one of his grandchilds, to me he was: Kind, Sharing, Loving and a very generous person who never did anything bad. After he died, I felt as if I had lost a really important person in my life, which is true. I hope that he will look over me and bless us all with health, wealth and happiness. Do not stand at my grave and weep; I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush I am the swift uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circled flight. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry; I am not there, I did not die. It was a great poem by Mary Frye. I miss my grandfather and no matter where I am I will think about him. Thank You. From Babu Patel.\n\nBabu Patel 24th May 2010\n\nDear Peri amma, Nava anna, Siva acca, Ganesh and Puvana Please accept my deepest sympathies on passing away of our dear Peri appa. Peri appa was a godly man with the heart of Gold. His generosity towards the people in need is second to none. I had the privilege of knowing him in a very personal way. His life has been a great inspiration to me. He had been the tower of support to my family during the difficult times. We have always looked-up to Peri appa & Peri amma as our godly parents. His life had been a true testimony of how one should live. Being a successful businessman and at the same time a kind hearted caring person are the most remarkable attributes that touched my heart. His exemplary life had influenced me in a positive way. It is sad to see that Peri appa no longer with us but the legacy he had left behind will live in my heart forever. I will always remember to uphold you in my prayers, may our good Lord comfort and sustain you & the loved ones during this most difficult times of losing my dear Peri appa. Love Mahenthiran Sabaratnam\n\nMahenthiran Sabaratnam 22nd May 2010\n\nI knew late Mr.sundrampillai form my kindergarten. we are first cousins.we studied at same village school after passing our fifth standared he joined Vaddukoddai Hindu college. his family was strong hinsu and he was a very good devotee. As his father was a businessman after leaving school he took up the business and moved out to Jaffna town, to better his prosfects. In Jaffna he took up to business and was running furniture shop as well as a Timer Merchant. He ranked as a top businessman. during this time he got married and I used to help in his business looking after his furniture shop.As we moved as very good friends, I got married to his sis-In- low. thereby our relationship increased. He was respected and helped those who were in dire needs. As a businessman ge flourished well and bought the the property and built a house and extended his business further. he was a very good father, respector of persons, and god fearing man. he left to U.K after closing his business to join his children, and was living peacefully. It was Providence that we (me and my children) miss you at the movement. but your actions and deeds cannot beforgetten. We miss you \"Periappa\" . though we were very good friend I call him restpectfully as \"Periappa\" as call by my children.

Your's baba,chandra,papa,Jeyendran, Mahen ,Naren (Sabu's children)\n\nchandra saba 19th May 2010\n\nIs with a lot of love and affection I start to write some words about Mr Sundarampillai. He is one big men...I write this, because for me he is eternity...forever he will stay in all of our minds, life and hearts...The life for him didn't finish...because I am sure now he will start a new stage...together with GOD. I am comfortable because I know every person in his family gave a lot of compassion, love and lots of attention. GOD look after him now...and We all will ...pray forever. We will miss you. From his loving daughter in law Sabrina Nava xxx\n\nDaniely Navaratnarajah 15th May 2010\n\nI am I and you are you, whatever we were to each other that we still are. Speak to me in the easy way which you always used. Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? Life means all that it ever meant, it is the same as it ever was.\n\nExtract from a poem by Henry Scott Holland"
