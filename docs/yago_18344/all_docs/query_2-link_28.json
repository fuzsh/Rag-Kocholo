        "text": "Saivam in Eelam\n\nIn Ceylon Sri Lanka Saivam was established in Eelam before historical period other religions which prevails now, were established only after the above mentioned period. The period of the establishment of Saivam cannot be pointed to a particular period; because it prevails from a very ancient time in Eelam.\n\nThe ancient citizens of Eelam were Iyakkar and Naagar. They worshipped God Siva. The Naga race lived not only in Sri Lanka but also all over India. Where ever the devotees they worshiped God Siva only. Their main temple was Thirukketheeswaram. They also inhabited thus place says researchers.\n\nThose who lived in this place are mentioned as Maathuvadda Visuvakarma, Mayan, Kuberan, Ravanan and Mandothari. They were also very strong devotees of God Shiva.\n\nAncient Tamils worshipped Gods with flowers and flavoured smile. Their ideas were that the flower denoted the devotee’s heart and the smoke deflated the melting heart. King Ravana who lived in South of Sri Lanka conducted Siva Pooja regularly and where ever he went he use to take a Sivalingam flowers and flavoured smoke for his worship.\n\nMayan’s daughter and Ravana’s wife Mandotheri lived and worshipped Thirukkatheeswara Peruman.\n\nWhen Mandothari was a spinister, she worshipped Thirukkatheswarapperuman and got blessing from God Siva. The following song narrates the incident. What the sung was “Kuil Paththu” Mani Vasakar has mentioned about this in the following song.\n\n“Vanthimaiyoorkal…….\n\nPerunthuraiyahti Annaal\n\nUnthu Thiraikkadalaik Kadainthu Anru\n\nOonku Mahtil Ilankai Yathanil\n\nPanthanai Melvirarkkarulum\n\nParisu Arivaar Empiran Avarae”\n\nThus sang Manivasakar also Manivasakapperuman has mentioned about Ravanan and Mandothari, their devotion towords God Shiva in and their daily reciting Panchadchchar Japam etc in his holy lines as following:\n\nVandamaroothi Madanthai Paenina\n\nPandai Ravanan Paadi Uyinthana”\n\nAnd also he mentions about Holy Ash used by Ravana as follows:-\n\n“Ravanan Mallathu Neeru” from there incidents were able to study how far has Sivapakthty spreaded in Eelam.\n\nThadchcha Kailaya Purnamam says that Ravanan conducted his mother’s last rites at “Kanniya Theeththam” in Trincomalee.\n\nOnce King Ravana wanted to carry Kailai Malai along with God Shiva and place it in Sri Lanka i.e Eelam. On that instant God Shiva got irritated and with his toe he pressed the hill and Ravanan was about to squeeze under Kailai Hill. Soon Ravanan realized his fault and sang the “Vilari Pun” and got himself excused by God Shiva.\n\nInfact there lies a truth that Ravanan’s father named Ravanan as “Sivathasan” Kumbakarnan as “Peraman” Vipeedanan as “Pasupathy” Soorppanakai and “Umai Ammai” After the opposers of these above mentioned characters only named them as “Ravanan, Kumbakarnan Vipeedanan, Soorppanaki and so on. Thus says in the text “Akaththiyar Ilanka” by Puththur. V. Nathar.\n\nThe name of Soorapathuman’s grandfather is “Thuvadda” he had no children for a long period. So he prayed to Thiruketheesvarapperuman who fulfilled his request for a long period Thuvadda lived there, and that city was formed by Mahathuvadda and in course of time the city got the name as “Maathoddam”\n\nIn Ancient time those who lived in “Eelam” were of a high standard in piety education and conduct. At the start “Saivam” was the only religion at “Eelam” Siva was their only God. Ravanan and his people were are Saivaist. They built Sivan Temple all over their country.\n\nAt Kankesanthurai, there was the Sivam temple. Named as ‘Kankeyaneswaram”, built by “Kaithan” alai as Murukan – a commander of Army. In addition he gave Hindu lectures at in all Sivan temple and helped the common people to gain more and more knowledge about “Saivaism”.\n\nEven historical researchers about ancient history of Sri Lanka Ceylon mentioned that Saivaims was the 1st among the religions those prevailed in Sri Lanka.\n\nOne Portugal historical writer named “Kuvirose” has mentioned in his historical book that, it was in the year 13.00 B.C the Koneshwarar temple was built thus say the engraving on a stone cutting.\n\nBefore of the coming of Vijayan and after his period too Savaism was flourishing in Ceylon says Rev. Valapola Rakula in his book named “The history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka” (or Ceylon) one Mr. J. W.Tenet in his book “History of Ceylon” has noted that the ancient people who settled in Ceylon wee none but Hindus.\n\nAmong the scholar of the 19th one Sri John William Johns, had done a wide research on the ancient in habitants of Ceylon about their language, literature Religion and their ancient products. He concluded saying that from the time which even our thoughts can’t reach Saivaists have lived in Ceylon.\n\nIn the Urukumai National Park a cut shine was found belonging to the period before Christ and once the name “Savanagar” was seen.\n\nWith the coming of King Viyayan the acceptance of throne he began to repair all the ruined Sivan temples and for their protection he build new temples for on all the four sides of the ancient temples found. Thus say Yalppana Vaipavamalai”`\n\nTHE PERIOD OF ANURATHAPURA\n\nThe successors of King Vijayan named Paanduka Vasuthevan, Apayan and Paondukapayan were all Hindus.\n\nAmong, those who ruled before Theesan were found in the name of “Sivan” for eg. Kirikandasivan, Nootha Sivan, Mahasivan were found in the period BC (307 – 2671). Among them Mahasivam belonged to BC (257 – )\n\nIn Anurathapura Bharamins who were well versed in Vedas and Aakamoms were found in great number. King Paandukaapayan took interest in them and also be built a Sivan Temple says “MahaVamsam”.\n\nDuring the period BC 145 – 101 Ellalan was ruling Anurathapura the was a Hindu Saivam Nourished here during his region. But their activities religion was not recorded. So we all are not aware of the defects.\n\nA radical change followed regarding “Saivam” during the reign of the King of Mahasenan during the period of A.C 4th Mahasenan supported Buddhism and destroyed all other temples including Shivan temples.\n\nDuring AC 5th King Kulakkoddan achola King came to Ceylon and did enough service to Thirukkoneswaram and Muneshwaram also he appointed the necessary Gurus to conduct the daily Pooja.\n\nTHE SEKILAR MARAPU AT EELAM\n\nSekilar is a family name. Also there were families in the names of Koodalkilaan, Purisaikilaan and Kundaiyoor Kilaan even in Sangakalam the name Kilan was common. The following names of such category was common among the people eg. Killimangalakilar\n\nKooviyurkkilar, Nallavoorkkilar Maruthankilar, Perunkunrakilar and Moankulikilar.\n\nOn a cutting stone the following were engraved South Indian Sasana No. 1403 II “Sekilan Seddi Eenkan Anurathapuram Ilankai Theevu (607 – 1912B).\n\nThe above details were found in a cutting stone in Tamil Sreesankapothy Marayan 5th. Here it is also mentioned that about the payment of 70 Eela coins for the expense of buying Nantha Vilakku and food items.\n\nAlso with the notification of the following 608/2 same King sekilan Sennai gave a donation.\n\nThe above two stone cuttings proves that the name “Sekilar” was common in Eelanadu.\n\nAccording to Mahavamsam, King Sankapothy III came to throne in (1913 E.P 103) from this Sekilars is well known. The period of Arulmoliththervar who wrote Thiruththondar Puranam also indicates that Sekilar is period is the 12th. Even years before this period Sekilar Marpu existed in Eelam.\n\nFrom the above details we can come to the conclusion that Sekilar Marupuk Kudikal lived not only in Thondai Nadu, but also at Sola Nadu and Eela Nadu from very ancient time and they were strange devotees of Shiva and did great amount of Services to Hindu Temples there they offered Thanam too for the welfare of the Sivan Temples.\n\nNAVALOOR NANTHA VILAKKU\n\nSuntharamoorthy Swamikal was born at Thirunavaloor Suntharar has mentioned about his birth place in the following lines”\n\n“Nakanukku Oor Namakkucor Narasingha Munairaiyan, Aatharithtu Esanukku Aadseyum Orani Navaloor” The cutting stone of the 28th mentions about the offering of NanthaVilakku” follows temple. The following statement says about the Villakku as follows Rajathiththevar Thayar Nampiraddayar Sekilanadikal Parivaraththan, Siththir Komalam Vaiththa, Nantha Vilakku, Onrukku, Vaiththa Sava Muraiperaedu Thonooru Eelavilakku Onnu”\n\nThe offering of this Nantha Vikkiram to Tamil Nadu Thirukkovil proves that there were skilled artists at Eela Nadu.\n\nOne, Pahiyan on his way to Eelam in the 5th has mentioned thus Ceylon King who followed all Hindu rites and with a pure heart etc. mention Samuel Beal a scholar. who purely belonged to Saivam only.\n\nTHE PERIOD OF PALLAVAR\n\nFrom the beginning of A.C 7th Pallavar’s region started and shone during this period Saivanayarmar, worked for the revival of Saivaism in Tamil Nadu. They worshipped and sang Thevara Thiruppathikams on Thirukkonomalai and Thiruketheeswaram from thus we are able to study that Saivaists maintained their religion in such a way that all this Saiva religious literature and Thevara Pathikam nourished in a high standard.\n\nAt this time Mahendra Pallavan started following Saivaism from Samanam. His relation too followed the Kings Way Manavarman (A.C 691) during his period, he went to Tamil Nadu, and stayed under the rescue where he joins the Pulikesi II and continued helping Nara Simma Varman. Soldiers who fought and helped Manavarman in the battle stayed in Eelam and for their worship many temples were built which are named as Kedikaikal in Nalantha.\n\nSaivaism hourished in Eelam among the common people during Manivasaka Peruman s period when the event occurred when the Eela Neddes Buddhists were defeated in Debals, their rest the citizens began to fallen Saivaism. They are Eelam known as Saiva Velaala Cheddikal in Jaffna.\n\nMaviddapura Period\n\nAt the last period of the 8th and the early part of the 9th a prince named Ukkira Singhen ruled the north of Ceylon residing at Kathira Malai “now known as Kantharodai” this prince married a Cholo princess named Marathapuravechavalli who at once had the face of the horse on her request she also built Maviddapuram Kandaswamy Kovil . After he changed his place from Kathiramalai to Singai Nagar, also as Vallipura Kuricheli later Maruthapuraveechevali was blessed with a son, named “BALASINGAM”\n\nIt is Balasingam who gave Jaffna which was Menelti in its former name to one Veera Ragavan who was talented is music and poetry composing Veera Rakevan claims Yaalpadi is different person from Anthakakavi Veeraragavan .They lived in different periods.\n\nPeriods of Cholars during the 10th 11th the power of Chola Lingeswar were spread not only in South India but also in south Asian countries at the time Raja Raja Cholan ruled the major part of Ceylon. He was followed by his son Raja Rajendran Cholan who brought the entire Ceylon under his region rule. In A.C 10th 1017 Ceylon was for of Chola Samrajam during which period the capital city was transferred from Anuradhapura to Polanaruva and the latter got she name “Jananathapuram”.\n\nChola kings built so many Siva temples in each and every part of Ceylon when Cholars were ruling former Pulanththuma Nagar in the name of Polanaruvai he built 10 Sivan temple at Polonaruwai. Among these the Archeological researchers say that one Sivan temple renew in good standard even now. This temple was built in the name of Raja Rajan’s wife and named after her name as Vanavan Ma Devy Eswaram. There is this particular area another Sivan temple is found which was built during Pandava Mannans region.\n\nAgain Manankeni cut stone stays that the Chola prince named Ilankeswara Thevan took interest in Koneswaram. During his time Koneswaran was named as Machesuvaram cut stone that belongs to Chola period says that 250 acres of land was offered to Koneswaram also it is proper to mention that the following Sivan temples was built during this very period as Kanthalai Sivan temple, Palamoddai Sivan Mathevar temple and Pathovia Sivan temple. Among there was built by Thalikkumaran who was one of Rajaraja Cholans Army Commanders say the Sasanaem that belongs to Colombo Museum.\n\nAgain Chola Mandala Saththiriya Sikamoni Valanaddu Sirukootta Nallur Kilavan Thalikkumaran built Rajaraeshwaram temple at Mathoddam Rajaraja Puram and could to it. In addition to this she offered all income from Arunamoliththevar Also he helped to run an inn and the meet then necessary expenses to conduct the May Vaikasi Viskavila for seven days etc. Also he made arrangements to read and study “Ithikams” during that auspicious period. Also the temple Thiruviraameesuvaram were found at Maathoddam says a cut stone of the 11th.\n\nOne of the commanders of Rajendracholan donated a good sum of money for the maintenance of Santhy Vilakku Juction lamp. This cut stone also mentions that the following groups were made to settle at Maathoddam so as to supply the necessary products to the temple. They were Vettilai Vanikar another group of them named Senkara Paadiyar etc.\n\nDuring Chola period at Pathavia a good number of Sivan temples were built. The ruins were found by researchers some time back a cut stone gives this message about temples built by Rajaraja Cholan, in Pathavia one famous temple is Ravikula Manica Eswaram is one the authorities and Army Commanders of the Chola King donated gold, cash, lamps bells etc. to his temple mention a cut stone at Pathavia during this period.\n\nA stamp belonging to the 13th during the ruling period of Kalinka Maahan at Polonnruwai incuding Batticaloa district was found with Kiranth Language. It mentions about God Mahesar at the village Sri Pathy where maximum Bharamins live. This proves that during the time of Mahan the rule and the Sivan temples found there were of high standard.\n\nThe stableness of God Nadarasar Godess Paravathy and Naalvar found at Polannaruvai how at Colombo Museum are of great importance. During this period Eelaththil Saivam was at it’s with all specialties.\n\nEven today you can view the ruins of Sivan temples of the Cholar’s period at Polomoddai near Kanthalaai. Even stone cuts with family letters are found there. According to the details given, it seems that temple is named as Thenkailasam. For the maintenance of this temples, a Bharamin lady named Nakaichchani donated gold and cash also for the maintenance of flower garden, lighting lamps sets one named “Velakkaran” of the above affairs. This portion belonged to Kanthalai.\n\nThe Paravathy Annai Saththiram (Inn) at Kanthalai belongs to Chola periods, but some say that this was built by Keerthishiree Nisanka Mallan\n\nAccording to the order of Nisankamallan who ruled Polonnaruvai till A.C 12th a Katsasenan which was cutoff was found at Kanthalai in 1921. From this it was found out that during ancient times Kanthalai was known as “Sathur Vetha Puram|” which made that was the living city of the Bharamins who studied all the 4 Veda in other words town where the Bhramins who were taught of all the 4 Vedas.\n\nDuring the Chola period Saivam flourished in Ceylon and so even the Sinhala Kings who came after Chola kings didn’t want to destroy the same atmosphere. The 1st King (1070 – 1114) who brought back, Bhuddaha revolution encouraged and donated for the temples erected by the Chola Kings Viyayabhahu the 1st also supported the Kat Kovil “Then Kailasam alias Kanthalai temple. During his time this temple was known as “Viyayaraja Eashwaram”. He also supported the Bharamin families all over.\n\nPALAMODDAI KALVEDDU\n\nA Sivan temple in ruined condition was found in 1933 in the Kanthalai Palamoddai Village at Trincomalee. In a cut stone found here, this temple is named as Vijaya Rajeswaram and Kanthalai is known as Vijaya Raja Sathur Vetha Mankalam. In 1244 Bharamins who were well versed in all the four Vedas lived at Kanthalai says research scholars.\n\nThe Cholars rule came to an end in AC 1070 but the Chola warriors and soldiers named Ahampadiyar and other Tamil continued living at Kanthalai and Polanaruvai Even now there are standing proves for the above saying.\n\nThose Kings who ruled after Vijayabahu I were the decendents of Kalinka or Panaliya lot and so gave full support to Saivaism and Hindu temples. They also built new Saiva temples.\n\nG.E. Milton mentions about the changes and benefits of Cholar’s rule in the religious details as follows:- In Polonaruvai Saivam topped the pure Buddhist principles. In south India because the activities increased and most of them stayed there permanently their principles topped among the society and as the result Saiva worship topped in the society.\n\nAlso it is said that during the rule of Parakkiramabahu till the end of his rule A.C 1186 – 1197) in his life time there occurred many Hindu Saiva rites. Also it mentioned that his King built 12 new Hind Saiva temples and re-named 79 ruined Saiva temples. Thus says “Choola Vamsam a book of historical importance.\n\nAlso it is mentioned that Keerthi Sharee Nisanka Mallan who ruled up to AC 1186 – 1197 built a new temple at Rameshwaram in the name of “Nishankamaheswaram”. Also the Thiruppani activities took place at Rameshwaram.\n\nKing encouraged the growth and nourishing of Saivasm during their rule in Thambathniya Kurunakal, Kampalai, Kottai and Irayagama. Dr.G.G. Mendis has mentioned in his book “Ilankai Poorveeka Sarithram”. The ancient History of Sri Lanka about the growth of Saivasm during this period.\n\nVANNIYAR KAALAM\n\nTHE PERIOD OF VANNIYAR\n\nThe text “Silai Elupathu describes about Vanniyar Manmiyam. After the fall of Chola’s rule, their worriers stayed back there and continued their ruling there which is now known as Vanni Nadu’ It is said that these Vanniyar belonged to Akni Kulam and their main places were Panankamam, Kumarapuram, Oomanthai and Thambalakamam.\n\nAt the end of 13th these Vanniyar nourished well and started encouraging the growth of Saivasm in their\n\nThese Vanniyar families started which those who lived in Araali, Tholpuram, Moolai, Chulipuram, Navaali, Sankanai, Koppai, Irupaalai, Thellippalai, Maravanpum, Uduppiddy and Kovilaakkandi\n\nPAANDIYA KAALAM\n\nThe period of Paandiyaas the two Pandian Kings. Sadavaraman and Sunthara Pandiyan had Ceylon under their rule during the following periods 1253 – 1270 1270 – 1310. They supported a lot for the growth of Saivasm during his rule Sunthar Pandian involved much in the renewal activities of Thirukketheeswarm.\n\nIt is also said that at the entrance of Fredric courts in Trincomalee there was a stone emblem on which the stamp emblem of a fish engraved and it was done by none but Sunthara Pandiyan.\n\nThus Shiva worship nourished and owing to this our island was also named as “Sivapoomi”, But in course of time, owing to the coming of other religious races into our country, some of the Sivan temples were destroyed and some got ruined, and some temples were actually hidden in thick forests. Some are unseen but their names are in black and white. We are able to know and understand clearly, the ancient history of the above temples and places the Kings who tried to maintaine their historical items and the details of the paddy fields, gold and other products etc, through the holy and ancient temples like Thirukketheeswaram, Thirukkoneswaram, Munieswaram, Naguleswaram and also from some of the cut stones found here and there and also from the religious and historical texts Thadchana Kailasa Maamiyam, Thadchana Kailaya Puranam, Thevaram, Thiruvasakam, Ramayanam, Mahavasmsam, Yalppana Vaipavamalai, History of Ceylon, Sri Lanka etc.\n\nYALPPANATHTHARASAR KAALAM\n\nThe period of Jaffna Kings\n\nFrom the 12th A.C , Kings of Jaffna are those who bares a special and important place in the history of Sri Lanka Ceylon. They are called Aariya Sakkaravarththikal. They have done a great deal to Tamil Language. Saivaism, and Siththa Vaiththiyam. These Kings paid more alteration to the daily Pooja and religious rites conducted in the following temples which are as follows; Thirukketheeswaram, Thirukkoneswaram and Rameswaram, one Kunasingha Aariar built Rameswaram temples Karippak Kiraham in 13 A.C, with the stones he brought from Trincomalee. Because of the strong link between these Aaria Sakkaravarththikal and Rameswaram, they were given a special name as “Sethukavalar”\n\nRamewswaram was under the custody of their Kings who were very pious and did all what needed for the temples also they protected the “Sethu Theerththam” with special care. As we start to anything with the beginning as “ Sivamayam” “Thiruchchittambalam”, they started anything and everything with the word “Sethu” It was their special emblems also King Sankiliyan on his shield carved the word “Sethu” says Rev. Fr. Kuvirose also the King added the emblem “Nanthi” as a sign of religious importance Nenthi is the of God Shiva King Pararajasekaran without the knowledge of his son “Sankili”, collected all his wealth, including his golden crown and saved it in Pilaththuvaram at portion of wealth to Rameswaram and gave this wealth to one of the ministers, requesting there to renew the fall including the Karpakirukemadapam and also appointed a person to supervise the above mentioned repair were this occurred in the A.C16\n\nAlso Sekaraja Sekara Mannan also built an Anna Sathiram at Rameswaram which could help quench thirst and hunger those abide near.\n\nIn short the Jaffna Kings were really served as Aathisethukavalar at that time.\n\nKANDY ARASAR KAALAM\n\nThe period of Kandy Kings\n\nDuring the region of the Kandian Kings Saivam nourished in Ceylon. There Kings got married to princess from Tamil Nadu were all found to be Saivaists. Due to this erected many Hindu temples at Kandy also. Temples like Koneshwaram, Muneeswaram, Kathirkamam, Kandy Kathiresan temples were all got the full support of these Kings.\n\nEven in places where the Tamils lived in minority, the Hindu culture and worship reached its high lights in the 16th. The Seetha Vakai King named Rajasinghan I, who fought with the Portuguese, let down his religion and started following “Saivaism”. He built a Shivan temple named “Bhairava Aandi” at Seethavakkai. This King also donated all his income from Sivanolipatha Yaaththirai to Saivaism says “Soolavamsam”.\n\nVijayabhahu II, renewed the Konesar temple and Kathirkamam says its history.\n\nThere was a Kandaswamy temple in Colombo province during the region of the region of Vijayabhahu King says a cut stone.\n\nJayavarththanapura was the capital of fort, where a Hindu temples were found where Tamil songs were played in Kernatic Musical instrument and Thevaram were also recited with piety says 12th verse of a Sinhala book named “Pasalavi Hini Santhesa”.\n\nVIDAI KODI The flag of Idapam\n\n“Ariya Sakaravarthy” who was mentioned as the Chief Commander of Pandias named Kulaththunke Sinkai Aariya Sakkaravarththi, during whose region, the flag was “Sinkai Arasan” Vidaikkodi Thus says “Yalppana Vaipavamalai\n\nINN FOR THE NAYANMARKAL\n\nJaffna Kings were found Aariya Sakkaravaththikal all to Saivaists. They built so many Hindu temples. Among these temples “Nallur Saddanathar Aalayam is specially noted till went the Jaffna in to the hands of the Europeans, the Jaffna Tamils were strict Saivaists. The minister of the who saved the King of Jaffna, during his period build a big inn and maintained worship his name was “Adiyaarikku, Nallar” owing to this inns that place got the name as “Nayanmarkkal.”\n\nEven today this name is in use. This indicates that the people concerned were pious and at the same time they involved themselves in various religious and sincere activities.\n\nPURANA PADANAM\n\nIn this country along with the regular Poojas religious rites that were common in all Shiva, Vinayaka, Subramania temples, there was also the habit of “Purana Padanam”, yearly the Puranams that were recited and explained were Periya Puranam, Thiruvilayadat Puranam, Thiruvathavooradikal Puranam, Kantha Puranam, Kasikaandam etc, They allocated certain periods for the recital of Puranams every year; The specially was that, one the day they fulfil the Purana () donations took place. This has been the habit from ancient time. Even now this good and special habit of Puranapadam prevails in our country and it is to be mentioned such regularity of Puranapadam is not found anywhere in Saiva temples, but for Eelanadu. This specialty ought to be appreciated by one and all.\n\nURAI AASIRIYARKAL OF HINDU / SAIVA TEXTS\n\nThose who have the capacity of bring all facts and ideas in the verse forms into prose form are known as Uri Aasiriyarkal.

It is also known as “Vetharaniyam”. Saiva Kurukkal paramparai was in charge of Thirumarai Kadu temple and its properties Varani Thillai Natha Thambiran Swamikal’s period they enjoyed these rites.\n\nOn 22nd of Oct 1949 Madras Aranilaya authorities was put in charge of this, and from that time who belonged to Varani Aathenam remains as the hereditary Trustee and conducts all what needed for the welfare of the temple up today.\n\nDuring the month of August 66 year named “Parapava” Arankavalar Shrelashree Kathirkama Pandara Sannithy successfully conducted the temples Thirumanchana (Kumbavishaka) ceremony.\n\nHindu Rites in English Langue\n\nAankilaththil Saivakkolkai\n\nIn order that people belonging to all different race and religion, English wrote way Hindu texts and Hindu articles. The following personalities are some of them.\n\nIn 1857 one Mr. K. Muthukumaraswamy wrote one special article on the topic. “Synopsis of Saiva Siddthantha” in one Royal Asiatic Club magazine belonging to Sri Lanka branch. The credit is that the 1st and the foremost research article on Saiva Siththantham is this.\n\nAlso one German Scholar named H.W.Schomerus who was a religious preacher wrote a book in German language on Saiva Siththantham in 1912 in the year 1912. This was translated in to English by one Dr. Arthur Fiz which was appreciated by the whole world as the one and only publication in European Language confirming the full details of Saiva Siththantham. The one who wrote originally is one Mr. Schomerus having Sir Pon. Ramanathan’s book as its basis which he has mentioned in his publication too. Also it is to be mentioned that all lectures by Sir. Pon. Ramanathan in America were based on Saiva Siththantham alone.\n\nBesides on Mr.J.M. Nallasamypillai published magazine named “Siththantha Theebikai” in English in order to spread the knowledge of “Siththantha Saivam” all over. In that very magazine Kokkuvil Kugathasan S. Sabarathna Muthaliyar has written many articles on “Saivasm” also he wrote the following books which earned a special name to him all over the world. The following are his publication which earned a popularity among the Hindu Saiva population all over the world.\n\nThe following two books “Saiva School of Hinduism” was written by Saiva Periyar S. Sivapatha Sundaram Pillai, printed and launched in London and the other book name of Saivaism written by the famous Saiva Paripalana Sabai in Jaffna, were considered as the two eyes of Saivaism in Eelam. Following this in 1948 the above mentioned Saivaperiyar was invited Tamil Nadu by Tharmapura Aatheenam and was given the responsibility of revising and renewing the publication of J.M. Nallasamippillai translation and then launched the same his publication named Sivagnana Botham with a rejoinder to Christian critic – 1951 s really the apt book to be read and undertook by those who study religious philosophy at present time.\n\nIn 1942 Jaffna Saiva Paripalana Sabai launched the book named “The elements of Saiva Sithantham” which was mentioned as the publication of a Science graduate Vinchanappaddatha… for the learners of Saiva Siththantham. The second editor of the some books took place in 1955. The one who wrote this book in the name of a valuable guide alias a Science graduate was name but Neeraliyadi A Visvanathapillai brother of Araali A Sellappa Pillai one of the senior members of Colombo Vivekanandasabai.\n\nIt is ideal to mention here that “Thiruvasakam” was first translated into English, by the famous Dr. G.U. Pope. The 2nd edition of the same was done by the Madras University. In 1934 one Mr. Vethamuththy, translated Thiiruvammanal and Thiruchchalal and this was launched by the Chennai Christian Society. Again in 1958 K.M. Balasubramaniam launched his own translation.\n\nIn this series one English poet of our country, Mrs Rethna Navaratnam Ex-Director Education wrote a book of her own named Thiruvasaka Vilakkam in English and it was launched the Bharathy Viththya Bhavan. This book narrates well how this book is of piety and above explanation to certain selected songs in Thiruvasakm another book of Mr.S. Ratna is “A New appreciate to Thiruvasakam launched is 1971 as A 2nd edition by the University of Annamalai.\n\nJaffna College at Vaddukkoddai is a Christian College started in 1923. At the beginning the teaching staff were all English people. They translated the Saivaism books into English and carried out their duty of priest who belonged to this college named Henry Richard Hoisington learnt Tamil Language and Sanskrit and translated a good number of Hindu religious books into English.\n\nOne Dr. Dashil during his time 1846 – 49 with the help of Kathiravet Pillai translated the following sithantha texts. Sivappirakasam and Sivagnanabotham.\n\nOne, Kailakurumani the 22nd Head Guru requested Vipulananda Adikal in 1944 to translate the 14 Maikanda Sastres in to English and to spread the Saivasiththantha Policies in up countries as the Vethantha policies were spread there heither too. Swami Vivekananthar consented to his request; he will live for a long after this incident. To all our great loss he passed away. If only he would have lived for some more time, many more Vipulanandha Sabai would have been established all over the world and the Saiva world would have benefitted a lot and enjoyed to the full.\n\nTHE 19TH CENTAURY\n\n1814, there were 329 Hindu Saiva Temples were found in Jaffna. These details are found in the book “A Short Account of Jaffna Patanam” written by Dr. Rev. Baldaeus in 1816. Also the details of the other temples in various parts of the country are found in the “Ceylon Gazetteer by Syman Kaasi Chetti.\n\nDuring the middle parts of the 19th the Saiva Samaya revolution curtailed the spreading of Christianity and encouraged the established of Saiva Samaya principles. This affairs were much supported and helped by Sreelashree Arumuga Navalar. Before that on 1842/9/30 a meeting was held at Vannapannai and their decision took place about building a Saiva school a press and issuing a Saiva News Paper. This news was published in the newspaper Uthaya Tharakai a Christian newspaper dated 20th Oct. 1842.\n\nNallur Kanthaswami Temple priest named Shivasree Subramaniya Iyar took efforts to establish a Sanskrit and Tamil school in Jaffna with the help of the Government he took many efforts in this matter. But as no definite principles regarding education was available in the hands of the Govt. these efforts did not workout. In 1834 234 Saiva schools were in Jaffna but in course of time the Christians got hold of them so, a necessity arose for establishing new schools for the Saiva students. But majority of them were very small.\n\nThe Christian school authorities were bent on for bidding the usage of holy Sandal and Kunkumam by the Saiva students were studying in the Christian Institutions. The students who rejected the idea were dismissed from the Christian institutions. So, following Navalar in 1872 started a Hindu English school for the betterment of the Saiva students. But unfortunately this very school was to be closed forever in 1876 owing to shortage of money and lack of Govt. support.\n\nIn 1990 those were in good positions owing to their English knowledge took interest the development of such Saiva schools. Among them were found Lawyers, Judges and Lectures and Politicians.\n\nTHE FIRST SAIVA SCHOOL\n\nBefore the establishing of Navalar Padasalai by Navalar Peruman, one Mr. Arulambala Muthaliyar a Saiva devotee belonging to Uduppiddy found a Saiva school for the education of Saiva students there in 1820. After him his son named Ambalavana Mudaliyar continued running the same school properly and in a special way rather than the former thus says Uthaya Tharakai a Christian Magazine of 1851/9/20.\n\nPAKTHY LITERATURE\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th the verse forms for literature were all concerned with religion. During this period (Songs) Thevarams appreciating the Saiva truth were (Sung) recited in all Saiva Hindu, temples in all villages concerned pious Thothiram in the rich form of Anthathy, Venba, Unjal, Ahaval and Maniam. Among these varieties Anthathy and Unchal were welcomed by the poets.\n\nIn Eelam wherever Tamils live Hindu temples were found. There is no doubt about it. Those temples are praised and description of the some are found in Pirapantha Vakai Padalkal.\n\nIn the growth and of Saivam in Eelam a lot of flourishing Rakthi Elakkiyam were composed and such atmosphere was created by Navalar Peruman only. There is no doubt in this matter.\n\nIt is Navalar Peruman who created such an atmosphere for the composition of immense Pakthi Elakkiam and also his pullaver Paramperai continues in Jaffna even today. There is no doubt in this saying.\n\nThere is none who isignorant of Navalar Peruman or his literary affairs. All his disciples are religious minded and their writings are of Navala Peruman’s style. There is no doubt in it. All his were about Saivasm and its principles etc.\n\nSAMAYA THAPANA THOOTAM The Formulation of Religious Organize\n\nMany Samaya Organizations alias Sthapanankal were formed in order to assemble the Saivaists and to encourage them to participate in the activities of Saivasm and its other affairs. Such an organization was found compulsory at that time. Thus following religious organizations come to existence All Ceylon Saiva Paripalana Sabai, Jaffna Saiva Paripalana Sabai and Vivekanand Sabai.\n\nSaiva schools and Saiva Colleges were formed to function for the growth and welfare of Saivasm. In 1913 with an idea of giving training by senior lectures a training collage was formed. This college was encouraged and supported in its activities by Karainagar Arunadsala Master and Earamba Iyar during this period. In the Eastern Province they formed Hindu religious movement to activate the religious society and those who started this movement were all good. But servants owing to the unwanted comments of the missionaries the Govt. tried to object this attempt. This is mentioned in the Hanzard 1913 – 16\n\nAARANILAYA KADDLAI SADDAM\n\nIn 1889 Bhauththa Ara Nilai Saddam was formed in Sri Lanka. Such a Law was highly needed for the Saivaists compelled Sir. Pon. Ramathan in 1890 at Sadda Niroobana Sabai. This requests were also published journal like “Theesapimani” etc. The Govt. Servants of the best and contributed for the betterment of all administration including temple administration. Certainly opposition also peeped in but the Govt. agents stressed on the main point that the Hindu Temple administration must be brought under the “Ara Nilai Kaddalai Saddam.\n\nIn 1900 Rev. A. Konga Sabai stressed on this above mentioned affairs. Govt. too concerned that the Hindus can submit an idea plan for the betterment of the temple administration, it will do its maximum help in this matter till 1910, the Saivaists did not come to a conclusion, the administration affairs Saiva temples were brought under Ara Nilaya Kaddalai Saddam.\n\nIn 1950 and 1975 this request was strengthened but its importance decreased because of certain oppositions.\n\nSAIVA THONRALKAL\n\nIn this country a good number of Hindu Saiva leaders lived and served for the betterment and growth of the Saiva world. Even the scholars and religious devotees of Tamil Nadu appreciated their services, composition lectures etc. Even the Heads of Aathenam and Tamil Nadu Kings appreciated and respected them. Among the above mentioned crowd, Gnanappirakas Swamikal stands in the 1st rank the served during the English rule, but he remained a sage at Chiramparam and gave a wide explanation in prose form for Siththiyar Subakalam.

The two Hindu religions Newspapers Hindu Sathanam in Tamil and Hindu organ in English were published. Once in two weeks’ time, on Virothy year August 2816 (11/9/1889) Wednesday Kirishana Pakkath Thuthiyai Uththaradam observing the benefits of Navalar Peruman’s religions lectures, the Saiva Saba also arranged such lecturers by Navala’s students and scholars among all villages for the betterment of the common people. Such lecturers wee Sivashree K. Supaiar, A. Muthukkumarasamikkurukkal, S. Erambaiyar, S. Ramalinga Vanianar etc.\n\nLater, one named Sankara Subaiyar, alias Sachithanantha Rajayoki to helped the Saivasaba in serving as honouring lecturer.\n\nSuch lectures took place in Thirumadams Temples and Saiva schools.\n\nEDITION OF THATHUVA PIRASARAM\n\nOne, Seerkali Thathivapirasara Swamikal was the student of Seerkali Sittampala Nadikal one of the disciples of Maikandathevar. He lived in the 14th and stone as Sivagnani. He wrote the book in Thathuva Pirakasam.\n\nThis book gives a vivid explanation of Thenthira, Manthira, Pathesa Kalakal, which contains the essence of Sariyai, Kiriyai, Yogam and Gnanam as found Sivaganam by God Shiva.\n\nThis text contains all Athara Sastras which not even mentioned in Sivagnanasiththiyar and Sivagnanpotham texts.\n\nThis text gives vivid explanation of Saiva rites in Tamil Language. So this book is really a treasure for the Saivaists.\n\nAfter the time of Maikandar Saiva Siththandha books were published in great number. But these can be compared to Maikandar’s Sivagnanasiththiyar and Sivagnanapothiam in their contents, but among them this text Thaththuvapirakasam scores the 1st rank.\n\nThis book was published in the proper way after a through revision by Velanai Saivapirakasa Vidyala Salai principal named Saiva Thirukanthapillai in the year 1891 in the month of February, at Kikkuvil Sothnda Pirakasa press.\n\nADANKAN MURAI PUBLICATION\n\nAdankan Murai means collecting Thevarams of Moovar Thevaram – Appar, Sundarar and Sampanthar were in the form ie (Palmyra palm leaf bits) After doing all corrections the one who published them for the first time was Navalar Peruman’s disciple named Kandarmadam Swaminatha Pandithar. These publications are worshipped by all Hindus as a big treasure.\n\nTHIRUVASAKAM\n\nThiruvasakam is a book form was printed and published for the 1st time by Jaffna Vannarpannai “Navalar Koddam” A Muththuthambypillai in 1970. It was published at Navalar press. It contained 30 pages with an in production. In this in production quotations from Thevara Thirvasakm and Uppanidathram are quoted as examples to prove the truths and specialists that are in Thiruvasakam. Regarding Upanidathapiramanakal it is mentioned it in that it’s rather donated by Siva Shree Upayavethakam Pandit N.V. Kanakasabapathy Iyar to Pillai Avarkal.\n\nThiruvasakam means it is what and which contains graceful word or sentences. The term Vasakam also means that it is the language or Paskam that explains the substance and essences of the Vethapporul. Vethapporul is the substance of Piranavam ie “Sivam” So it can be concluded text the explains in details the nature of Sivam and gives the ways to understand clearly what mention that Thiruvasakam was raised as the best among such books published and was awarded Silvar.\n\nYal co-oprative society where Tamil Books were printed and sold.\n\nThis Kalakam or society printed and sold in reasonable price all guides and other Saiva texts by our former scholars. This was a great service to the Hindu religious society which has done in the past. Really it is a great serial of the Saiva world. It can be also praised as a Divine Service and it is the duty at each and every Saiva member to contribute his service to attempt.\n\nART KADDALAIKAL\n\nIn our country for the betterment aided growth of Saivaism, Shreelashree Aarumuganavalar, Malavarayar, Thopuram Mana Muthaliyar, Punniya Nachchi and Sir Pon. Ramanathan scholars organized same Aratkadalaikal. There are some other great Kaddalaikal too prevailing. In order to make the best use of these Arakkaddalkal religions scholars and Saiva Sabas are doing their attempts to the maximum.\n\nThe success of the above will definitely contribute to growth one of the development of Saivaism.\n\nIt is our fore most duty to mention about one J.M. Nallasamipillai, who was a brilliant Saivasithantha writer speaker, translator and teacher. He had the courage and will power to mention openly that if at all there is one Saba or High Peedam for Saiva Siththantham that is none but Colombo Vivekananda Sabai. In the year 1958 on the 29th of May on the occasion of the above Saba Thuthukudy Saiva scholar N. Sivagurunatha Pillai has given his ideas about the Vivekananda Sabai as follows:-\n\nIt is free that the above Sabai has given wide knowledge is Tamil grammar and literature and also Saiva to have conducted exams too. This can be named as “Sabai live long with all properly to encourage the growth of Saivaism how to Ganakulathar Thirugnanasambandhar to help to achieve the mentioned request. To conclude I can say that our Saiva relgion is in allured position as to draw the attention of other Saivaists who lives in other foreign countries.\n\nSITHTHANTHA MAHA NADU\n\nThe so called Saiva Sithantha Samarasam was organized in 1905.7.17 with the blessing of Thiruppalhirippuliyoor Gnanaswamikal with a view of spreading Siththanthasaivam, Its Taththuvasasthira decisions and the life style according these principles. In this affairs Sir. Pon. Ramanathan played an important role in this Samasam it was decided that the Siththantha Maha Nadu must be met once in every year. Such a Maha Nadu met thrice in Eelam. This is to be appreciated by all Hindus.\n\nThe 43rd meeting of the Saiva Siththantha Maha Nadu met in Jaffna, in December 1948. The President of the meeting was one Mr. Balasubramania Mudaliyar. The meeting of the Maha Nadu was well arranged by the Saiva Paripalana Sabai Members.\n\nThe 44th meeting of the same Maha Nadu met in Colombo on the month of January 7th 1950. This was conducted by Colombo Vivekananda Sabai. The head of the Maha Nadu was none but P. Meenadchisundarampillai, and Colombo Vivekananda Sabai conducted it. It this meeting the 7th and the 9th Days that took place at Colombo Vivekananda Hall and the 8th day Saiva Ilaicher Maha Nadu and Saiva Mankayar Maha Nadu took place at Wellawatta Semmankodu Manikka Pillayar Temple Hall. The details of Colombo Vivekananda Saba who monthly Sanka gave a good effect those who read it understood the importance of the same and as a result many more such Sankakal were formed all over the country. They functioned well and as the result many such Sangankal were formed which could firmly establish such Sangams in our county up to day. Also these Sangams service will help in preventing the entering of other religions into ours. This credit goes to the Sabai and Sabai alone.\n\nThe 54th Maha Nadu was held at Thiruketheeswaram in 1960 December on the 30th and 31st and in 1961 on the 1st of the month January. The Maha Nadu took place under the president ship of Periyar S. Satchithanantha Pillai, and conducted Thirukeetheeswaram Temple. Thiruppani Sabai, Kandiah Vaithyanathan supported to the full for those activities on behalf of this Maha Nadu a Malar named Thiruketheeswara Saiva Maha Nadu Malar was published, when these Maha Nadu activities took place in Tamil Nadu the Sri Lankan Scholars were invited and encouraged participating in it. These events also made us understand the respect the Tamil Nadu Scholars had towards Sri Lankan’s Saiva Scholars ets.\n\nThe following gives details of the events and participants of such Maha Nadu\n\nMahanadu Year Place Name of Presidents 1st 1906 Chithamparam Sir.

The main person who was bent on assembling this Maha Nadu was none but Saivapperiyar M.S. Ilayathamby he was successful Lawyer too. Also the Editor of Inthu Sathanam. He was bent on enriching Saivam more and more He devoted his entire life for the above cause. He was one among the three who did their best to term Colombo Vivekananda Sabai at Colombo in the year 1902. The other two were C.M. Kamara Veluppilai, M.S. Ilayathamby and C.S. Jembasamy.

Kanagasabai member of Saddamanru too delivered speeches. As a result and benefit of this Maha Nadu, came to exist many Hindu Saiva Youths Sangams.\n\nTHIRU MURAI VILA\n\nNormally Maha Nadukal use to occur regarding Saiva Samaya Thothira Sasthira texts among such occasions. Thirumurai Vila held in the year 1955 at Veknai was great and spcial among all which took place heither too. Many Saiva Scholars from Tamil Nadu attended this great function.\n\nFollowing this Vila at Velanai in 1962 April 7, 8, 9th one Thirumurai Vila was conducted by Colombo Vivekananda Sabai on a large scale and many such Vilas followed. But the Thirumurai Vila on 1975 June 29th was considered one of the best in the history of such celebration. This Vila started from Colombo Kochchkadai Ponnampalavaneshar Temple with Mangala Vathia Music thro Colombo streets, on which occasion the Thevara Thirumurai Eeddu Swaddikal were on the back of an Elephant carrying them to the Hall concerned in the form of a grand procession.\n\nThe crown remarked that they have not seen such a grand and holy procession heither too.\n\n9.7.1956 Today every year Thiru Murai Vilas also taking place for some years temple entering was rejected by the authorities but, inspite of this hindrance such Maha Nadu Meeting took place as a result those who were rejected temple entry also enjoyed the change of entering and worshipping the God Mukkannan who is none but God Shiva and Shiva alone, this event was publically accepted in the year of 1956 July 9th. Even before this, it is state that a Siva Kama School was formed.\n\nVETHA SIVAKAMA SCHOOLS\n\nSuch schools were formed with a great motive to bring up good Saiva Teachers for the wide knowledge, conduct talents piety and good character. Such schools were formed at first on the year 1961 November at Thirukketheecharam and it was transferred to Jaffna Vannarpannai Sivan Temple in the year 1974 with the same motive. One Muhandram Siva Sri Sathasiva Iyar started a Piraseena schools and the 1st head of this school was Mahavidva Siva Sree Ganash Iyar.\n\nTo add another Sivakam school was formed by Siththankeni Vaithlingam for the sake of the Bharamin generation to study and practice all Sivakamam principles and Saiva Aagama Philosophical explanations and to gain knowledge about Shree Sastra both in Tamil and English language.\n\nIn the year 1957 December 9th one All Ceylon Siva bharamin Sangam was established and if continue conducting Vetha Sivakama Classes. Such class is found in Inuvil and being conducted by Inuvil Sivasree Mahadevakurukkal today.\n\nAarumuga Navalar Peruman did the preparations to the coming generation to do the needful for the growth the of Sivakama knowledge and accordingly his brother’s son one T. Kailasapillai conducted Kovil class, printed books concerned Sivakamasaram and also special classes suitable for Sivachariyarkal.\n\nOne Mr.S.Sivapprakasa Pandithar who were born at Chunnakam and lived at Neervely were good and able schlars in Tamil and Sanskirit. They had wide knowledge in Sivakamankal in Sanskrit and Siththa texts in Tamil. Their students shined well and become talend Bharamins who became able Sivachchariayar. Among them Keerimalai Sivasree Sebapathy Kurukkal can be mentioned as one of the best in that category. Again Sankara Pandithar who lived in Jaffna can be mentioned for his Sankskrit knowledge it was mentioned as a leading scholars among Sankskrit Pandits. Even now, there are Pandits of the same special category in Ceylon shining in their special religious Aagama kind Sithantha knowledge. In this category Saivathiu Eelalai M. Ganapirakasam, Pandit M. Kandiah and Avarankal Pandit S. Subramaniam are to be mentioned.\n\nArchakarkal were brought from Tamil Nadu who were well versed in Sivakammam to Vannarpannai Veitheeswaran Kovil and they contributed much for the spreading of Vetha Aththuanam and Siva also Gnanam all over the country.\n\nIf favorites to maintain its standard of the priests of Colombo Ponampalavaneshwaram in Siva Kama Kiriyai, Sir Pon. Ramanathan did all families for them to reach the needed standard.\n\nTo add, Sivasree Muththukkumarasamy Kurukkal and Sankanai A. Arunasalasashthirikal spent their life time teaching Vadamoli Kaviam Viyakkaranam Aakamam and Pathhtthikal, so as Mathakal Sivasree S. Erampaiyar, Keerimalai Sivasree T. Cumarasamy Kurukkal and Atchuvely Sivasreee Cumarasamikurukkal served a lot giving practice to the priests and to guide them properly in their various activities. Same efforts were taken by Saiva Paripalana Sabai in Jaffna Hindu College and by Colombo Lawyer Saivathru S. Subramaniam at Nallur Kailaya Pillayar Temple Hall with the permission of the Arakavalar.\n\nN.B\n\nIt is important to mention here that students who wish to come out with full proactive and standard ought to do Kurukulavasam and get practice continuously for 5 or 7 or 12 years. Along with the Vadamoli Vetha Sivakama knowledge, one must also gain knowledge about Tamil Language and literature Saiva Thirumuraikal Sithamtha Sasthirankal and Puranars only then they can serve as good priests and lecturers.\n\nVADDUKKODDAI NAGARATHAR PANI\n\nThe service of Vaddukoddai Nagaraththar\n\nVaddukkoddai Cheddikal were also known as “Nakaraththar” They come to our country from, Tamil Nadu for business purpose. The pols point of theirs is that wherever they go, they do a good service in contributing for their religion ie. Saivam. Their places can be mentioned as Jaffna, Colombo, Kandy, Mampalai, Navalppiddy, Pandaravelai, Ratnapuri, Mathambai, Puttalam, Kurunagal, Neer Colombo, Galle and So in these places stayed and built Saiva Temples and Inns and they put tight security for such places by spending a lot of money in this affairs. Though such activities are not found at the former speed and rule yet they are good enough to contribute for the growth of the religion and certain festivals that took place in those halls and inns found by them made the public to remind and think of their good services.\n\nTo mention here the Vellivila which is specially celebrated yearly in Colombo from A.C 1820 is considered to be a special national Vila (event) this particular day was granted as Govt. public holiday from A.C 1931 up to AC 1956.\n\nCOMPULSORY EDUCATION\n\nThe Govt. did a useful thing in making compulsory that students must study their own religion as their compulsory subjects. This made all the students to learn and gather knowledge about their own religion for examination sake they must study about their own religion at the same time they must practice what they learnt in their religion in their daily life. This habit is sure to lead them to a standard life such an atmosphere is found in our country and it is really a blessing to all of us\n\nNEWS PAPERS\n\nThe following are the details of the newspaper, journals concerned with our Saivaist and its growth from period to period\n\n1977 – Ilankai Nesan H.M.
