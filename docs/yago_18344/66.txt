“This is a cause close to my heart. I have always been passionate about helping those in need, particularly people living without a home, so it is a real pleasure to join the team at Caritas Anchor House” – Siva Selliah, newly appointed Director of Finance.

Having worked in finance for over 20 years, and in several housing associations along the way, Siva brings with him both comprehensive experience and compassion for his work. His previous role was with Greenbrook Healthcare, a primary care organisation caring for NHS patients across London, where he acted as Finance Controller for four years. He has also previously worked for small charities providing housing and support for people experiencing homelessness, learning difficulties or mental health problems.

As someone who has lived in Newham and the neighbouring Borough of Redbridge for a large part of his life, Siva was delighted to return to a local charity and is excited at the prospect of increasing our potential and expanding our services. Siva has already previously been involved various volunteering and outreach work in Newham with St. Barnabas Church, Helping Hands and a range of other organisations providing care for rough sleepers.

At Caritas Anchor House Siva will be guiding our finance function, which encompasses the coordination of our resident’s personal finances, including housing benefit, alongside the income and outcome streams of our organisation overall. He has shared that he looks forward to maximising our income to allow us to help as many people as possible, to ensure all our services remain financially stable, and to ensure the safety and longevity of our organisation.
