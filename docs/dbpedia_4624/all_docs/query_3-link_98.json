        "text": "Future developments. For the latest information about developments related to Pub. 530, such as legislation enacted after it was published, go to IRS.gov/Pub530.\n\nResidential energy efficient property credit. The residential energy efficient property credit is now the residential clean energy credit. The credit rate for property placed in service in 2022 through 2032 is 30%.\n\nEnergy efficient home improvement credit. The nonbusiness energy property credit is now the energy efficient home improvement credit. The credit is extended to property placed in service after December 31, 2032.\n\nMortgage insurance premiums. The itemized deduction for mortgage premiums has expired. The deduction doesn’t exist for premiums paid after December 31, 2021.\n\nHome Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). If you benefit from Pay-for-Performance Success Payments, the payments aren’t taxable under HAMP.\n\nRepayment of first-time homebuyer credit. Generally, you must repay any credit you claimed for a home you bought if you bought the home in 2008. See Form 5405 and its instructions for details and for exceptions to the repayment rule.\n\nHome equity loan interest. No matter when the indebtedness was incurred, for tax years beginning in 2018 through 2025, you cannot deduct the interest from a loan secured by your home to the extent the loan proceeds weren't used to buy, build, or substantially improve your home.\n\nHomeowner Assistance Fund. The Homeowner Assistance Fund program (HAF) was established to provide financial assistance to eligible homeowners for purposes of paying certain expenses related to their principal residence to prevent mortgage delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, loss of utilities or home energy services, and also displacements of homeowners experiencing financial hardship after January 21, 2020. If you are a homeowner who received assistance under the HAF, the payments from the HAF program are not considered income to you and you cannot take a deduction or credit for expenditures paid from the HAF program. Rev. Proc. 2021-47 provides an optional method for certain homeowners who itemize their deductions to determine the amount you can deduct for home mortgage interest and state and local real property taxes if you paid the mortgage servicer with your own funds but also received financial assistance from the HAF program described in Rev. Proc. 2021-47. Please note, though Rev. Proc. 2021-47 provides for the possible deduction of home mortgage insurance premiums, you cannot deduct any home mortgage insurance premiums you paid after December 31, 2021. For more details about the HAF program, see Homeowner Assistance Fund. You may use the optional method if you meet the following two requirements.\n\nYou paid a portion of the mortgage interest or state and local real property taxes from your own sources (that is, out-of-pocket payments not subsidized by any governmental financial assistance programs).\n\nYou meet the rules to deduct all of the mortgage interest on your loan and all of the real estate taxes on your main home.\n\nThe optional method allows you to deduct the mortgage interest and state and local real property taxes reported on Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, but only up to the amount you paid from your own sources to the mortgage servicer during the tax year. You are not required to use this optional method to figure your deduction for mortgage interest and state and local real property taxes on your main home.See State and Local Real Estate Taxes and Home Mortgage Interest, later, to determine whether you meet the rules to deduct all of the mortgage interest on your loan and all of the real estate taxes on your main home. For more details about the HAF program, see Homeowner Assistance Fund at Treasury.gov/haf. If you received HAF funds from an Indian Tribal Government or an Alaska Native Corporation and want more details about the HAF program, see frequently asked questions (FAQs) at IRS.gov/ITGANCFAQs. . See State and Local Real Estate Taxes and Home Mortgage Interest, later, to determine whether you meet the rules to deduct all of the mortgage interest on your loan and all of the real estate taxes on your main home..\n\nExtended tax benefit. Certain tax benefits, including the following, that were set to expire have been extended.\n\nThe nonbusiness energy property credit has changed to the energy efficient home improvement credit. The credit is extended to property placed in service through December 31, 2032.\n\nThe exclusion from income of discharges of qualified principal residence indebtedness has been extended through 2026.\n\nResidential energy credits. You may be able to take a credit if you made energy saving improvements to your home located in the United States in 2023. See the Instructions for Form 5695, Residential Energy Credits, for more information.\n\nMortgage debt forgiveness. You can exclude from gross income any discharges of qualified principal residence indebtedness made after 2006 and in most cases before 2026. You must reduce the basis of your principal residence (but not below zero) by the amount you exclude. See Discharges of qualified principal residence indebtedness, later, and Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment), for more information.\n\nPhotographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.\n\nWhat You Can and Can’t Deduct\n\nTo deduct expenses of owning a home, you must file Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Income Tax Return for Seniors, and itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). If you itemize, you can’t take the standard deduction.\n\nThis section explains what expenses you can deduct as a homeowner. It also points out expenses that you can’t deduct. There are three primary discussions: state and local real estate taxes, sales taxes, and home mortgage interest.\n\nGenerally, your real estate taxes and home mortgage interest are included in your house payment.\n\nYour house payment.\n\nIf you took out a mortgage (loan) to finance the purchase of your home, you probably have to make monthly house payments. Your house payment may include several costs of owning a home. The only costs you can deduct are state and local real estate taxes actually paid to the taxing authority and interest that qualifies as home mortgage interest.These are discussed in more detail later.\n\nSome nondeductible expenses that may be included in your house payment include:\n\nFire or homeowner's insurance premiums,\n\nMortgage insurance premiums, and\n\nThe amount applied to reduce the principal of the mortgage.\n\nMinister's or military housing allowance.\n\nIf you are a minister or a member of the uniformed services and receive a housing allowance that isn’t taxable, you can still deduct your real estate taxes and your home mortgage interest. You don’t have to reduce your deductions by your nontaxable allowance. For more information, see Pub. 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers, and Pub. 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.\n\nNondeductible payments.\n\nYou can’t deduct any of the following items.\n\nInsurance, including fire and comprehensive coverage, and title insurance.\n\nWages you pay for domestic help.\n\nDepreciation.\n\nThe cost of utilities, such as gas, electricity, or water.\n\nMost settlement costs. See Settlement or closing costs under Cost as Basis, later, for more information.\n\nForfeited deposits, down payments, or earnest money.\n\nInternet or wifi system or service.\n\nHomeowners association fees, condominium association fees, or common charges.\n\nRepairs to home.\n\nState and Local Real Estate Taxes\n\nMost state and local governments charge an annual tax on the value of real property. This is called a real estate tax. You can deduct the tax if it is assessed uniformly at a like rate on all real property throughout the community. The proceeds must be for general community or governmental purposes and not be a payment for a special privilege granted or special service rendered to you.\n\n. The deduction for state and local taxes, including real estate taxes, is limited to $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately). See the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040) for more information. .\n\nDeductible Real Estate Taxes\n\nYou can deduct real estate taxes imposed on you. You must have paid them either at settlement or closing, or to a taxing authority (either directly or through an escrow account) during the year. If you own a cooperative apartment, see Special Rules for Cooperatives, later.\n\nWhere to deduct real estate taxes.\n\nEnter the amount of your deductible state and local real estate taxes on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5b.\n\nReal estate taxes paid at settlement or closing.\n\nReal estate taxes are generally divided so that you and the seller each pay taxes for the part of the property tax year you owned the home. Your share of these taxes is deductible if you itemize your deductions.\n\nDivision of real estate taxes.\n\nFor federal income tax purposes, the seller is treated as paying the property taxes up to, but not including, the date of sale. You (the buyer) are treated as paying the taxes beginning with the date of sale. This applies regardless of the lien dates under local law. Generally, this information is included on the settlement statement you get at closing.\n\nYou and the seller each are considered to have paid your own share of the taxes, even if one or the other paid the entire amount. You each can deduct your own share, if you itemize deductions, for the year the property is sold.\n\nExample.\n\nYou bought your home on September 1. The property tax year (the period to which the tax relates) in your area is the calendar year. The tax for the year was $730 and was due and paid by the seller on August 15.\n\nYou owned your new home during the property tax year for 122 days (September 1 to December 31, including your date of purchase). You figure your deduction for real estate taxes on your home as follows.\n\n1. Enter the total real estate taxes for the real property tax year $730 2. Enter the number of days in the property tax year that you owned the property 122 3. Divide line 2 by 365 0.3342 4. Multiply line 1 by line 3. This is your deduction. Enter it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5b $244\n\nYou can deduct $244 on your return for the year if you itemize your deductions. You are considered to have paid this amount and can deduct it on your return even if, under the contract, you didn’t have to reimburse the seller.\n\nDelinquent taxes.\n\nDelinquent taxes are unpaid taxes that were imposed on the seller for an earlier tax year. If you agree to pay delinquent taxes when you buy your home, you can’t deduct them. You treat them as part of the cost of your home. See Real estate taxes, later, under Basis.\n\nEscrow accounts.\n\nMany monthly house payments include an amount placed in escrow (put in the care of a third party) for real estate taxes. You may not be able to deduct the total you pay into the escrow account. You can deduct only the real estate taxes that the lender actually paid from escrow to the taxing authority. Your real estate tax bill will show this amount.\n\nRefund or rebate of real estate taxes.\n\nIf you receive a refund or rebate of real estate taxes this year for amounts you paid this year, you must reduce your real estate tax deduction by the amount refunded to you. If the refund or rebate was for real estate taxes paid for a prior year, you may have to include some or all of the refund in your income. For more information, see Recoveries in Pub. 525.\n\nItems You Can’t Deduct as Real Estate Taxes\n\nThe following items aren’t deductible as real estate taxes.\n\nCharges for services.\n\nAn itemized charge for services to specific property or people isn’t a tax, even if the charge is paid to the taxing authority. You can’t deduct the charge as a real estate tax if it is:\n\nA unit fee for the delivery of a service (such as a $5 fee charged for every 1,000 gallons of water you use),\n\nA periodic charge for a residential service (such as a $20 per month or $240 annual fee charged to each homeowner for trash collection), or\n\nA flat fee charged for a single service provided by your local government (such as a $30 charge for mowing your lawn because it had grown higher than permitted under a local ordinance).\n\n. You must look at your real estate tax bill to decide if any nondeductible itemized charges, such as those listed above, are included in the bill. If your taxing authority (or lender) doesn’t furnish you a copy of your real estate tax bill, ask for it. Contact the taxing authority if you need additional information about a specific charge on your real estate tax bill..\n\nAssessments for local benefits.\n\nYou can’t deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property. Local benefits include the construction of streets, sidewalks, or water and sewer systems. You must add these amounts to the basis of your property.\n\nYou can, however, deduct assessments (or taxes) for local benefits if they are for maintenance, repair, or interest charges related to those benefits. An example is a charge to repair an existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge.\n\nIf only a part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest charges, you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the deduction. If you can’t show what part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest charges, you can’t deduct any of it.\n\nAn assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your real estate tax bill. If so, use the rules in this section to find how much of it, if any, you can deduct.\n\nTransfer taxes (or stamp taxes).\n\nYou can't deduct transfer taxes and similar taxes and charges on the sale of a personal home. If you are the buyer and you pay them, include them in the cost basis of the property. If you are the seller and you pay them, they are expenses of the sale and reduce the amount realized on the sale.\n\nHomeowners’ association assessments.\n\nYou can't deduct these assessments because the homeowners’ association, rather than a state or local government, imposes them.\n\nForeign taxes you paid on real estate.\n\nYou can't deduct foreign taxes you paid on real estate.\n\nSpecial Rules for Cooperatives\n\nIf you own a cooperative apartment, some special rules apply to you, though you generally receive the same tax treatment as other homeowners. As an owner of a cooperative apartment, you own shares of stock in a corporation that owns or leases housing facilities. You can deduct your share of the corporation's deductible real estate taxes if the cooperative housing corporation meets the following conditions.\n\nThe corporation has only one class of stock outstanding.\n\nEach stockholder, solely because of ownership of the stock, can live in a house, apartment, or house trailer owned or leased by the corporation.\n\nNo stockholder can receive any distribution out of capital, except on a partial or complete liquidation of the corporation.\n\nAt least one of the following.\n\nAt least 80% of the corporation's gross income for the tax year was paid by the tenant-stockholders. For this purpose, gross income means all income received during the entire tax year, including any received before the corporation changed to cooperative ownership.\n\nAt least 80% of the total square footage of the corporation's property must be available for use by the tenant-stockholders during the entire tax year.\n\nAt least 90% or more of the expenditures paid or incurred by the corporation were used for the acquisition, construction, management, maintenance, or care of the corporation’s property for the benefit of the tenant-shareholders during the entire tax year.\n\nTenant-stockholders.\n\nA tenant-stockholder can be any entity (such as a company or corporation, trust, estate, partnership, or association) as well as an individual. The tenant-stockholder doesn't have to live in any of the cooperative's dwelling units. The units that the tenant-stockholder has the right to occupy can be rented to others.\n\nDeductible taxes.\n\nYou figure your share of real estate taxes in the following way.\n\nDivide the number of your shares of stock by the total number of shares outstanding, including any shares held by the corporation.\n\nMultiply the corporation's deductible real estate taxes by the number you figured in (1). This is your share of the real estate taxes.\n\nGenerally, the corporation will tell you your share of its real estate tax. This is the amount you can deduct if it reasonably reflects the cost of real estate taxes for your dwelling unit.\n\nRefund of real estate taxes.\n\nIf the corporation receives a refund of real estate taxes it paid in an earlier year, it must reduce the amount of real estate taxes paid this year when it allocates the tax expense to you. Your deduction for real estate taxes the corporation paid this year is reduced by your share of the refund the corporation received.\n\nSales Taxes\n\nGenerally, you can elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040). You must check the box on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5a, if you elect this option. Deductible sales taxes may include sales taxes paid on your home (including mobile and prefabricated), or home building materials if the tax rate was the same as the general sales tax rate. For information on figuring your deduction, see the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040).\n\n. The deduction for state and local taxes, including general sales taxes, if elected instead of income taxes, is limited to $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately). See the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040) for more information. .\n\n. If you elect to deduct the sales taxes paid on your home, or home building materials, you can't include them as part of your cost basis in the home..\n\nHome Mortgage Interest\n\nThis section of the publication gives you basic information about home mortgage interest, including information on interest paid at settlement, points, and Form 1098.\n\nMost home buyers take out a mortgage (loan) to buy their home. They then make monthly payments to either the mortgage holder or someone collecting the payments for the mortgage holder.\n\nUsually, you can deduct the entire part of your payment that is for mortgage interest for acquisition debt (or debt that qualifies as acquisition debt) if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). See\n\nHome Acquisition Debt for more information.\n\nLimits on home mortgage interest.\n\nYour deduction for home mortgage interest is subject to a number of limits. If one or more of the following limits apply, see Pub. 936 to figure your deduction. Also see Pub. 936 if you later refinance your mortgage or buy a second home.\n\nLimit for loan proceeds not used to buy, build, or substantially improve your home.\n\nYou can only deduct home mortgage interest to the extent that the loan proceeds from your home mortgage are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home securing the loan. The only exception to this limit is for loans taken out on or before October 13, 1987; the loan proceeds for these loans are treated as having been used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home. See Pub. 936 for more information about loans taken out on or before October 13, 1987.\n\nLimit on loans taken out on or before December 15, 2017.\n\nFor qualifying debt taken out on or before December 15, 2017, you can only deduct home mortgage interest on up to $1 million ($500,000 if you are married filing separately) of that debt. The only exception is for loans taken out on or before October 13, 1987; see Pub. 936 for more information about loans taken out on or before October 13, 1987.\n\nSee Pub. 936 to figure your deduction if you have loans taken out on or before December 15, 2017, that exceed $1 million ($500,000 if you are married filing separately).\n\nLimit on loans taken out after December 15, 2017.\n\nFor qualifying debt taken out after December 15, 2017, you can only deduct home mortgage interest on up to $750,000 ($375,000 if you are married filing separately) of that debt. If you also have qualifying debt subject to the $1 million ($500,000 if you are married filing separately) limitation discussed under Limit on loans taken out on or before December 15, 2017, earlier, the $750,000 limit for debt taken out after December 15, 2017, is reduced by the amount of your qualifying debt subject to the $1 million limit. An exception exists for certain loans taken out after December 15, 2017, but before April 1, 2018. If the exception applies, your loan may be treated in the same manner as a loan taken out on or before December 15, 2017. See Pub. 936 for more information about this exception.\n\nSee Pub. 936 to figure your deduction if you have loans taken out after October 13, 1987, that exceed $750,000 ($375,000 or less if you are married filing separately).\n\nLimit when loans exceed the fair market value of the home.\n\nIf the total amount of all mortgages is more than the fair market value of the home, see Pub. 936 to figure your deduction.\n\nRefund of home mortgage interest.\n\nIf you receive a refund of home mortgage interest that you deducted in an earlier year and that reduced your tax, you must generally include the refund in income in the year you receive it. For more information, see Recoveries in Pub. 525. The amount of the refund will usually be shown on the mortgage interest statement you receive from your mortgage lender. See Mortgage Interest Statement, later.\n\nDeductible Mortgage Interest\n\nTo be deductible, the interest you pay must be on a loan secured by your main home or a second home, regardless of how the loan is labeled. The loan can be a first or second mortgage, a home improvement loan, a home equity loan, or a refinanced mortgage.\n\n. Interest paid on home mortgage proceeds is only deductible to the extent the loan proceeds were used to buy, build, or substantially improve your home. .\n\nPrepaid interest.\n\nIf you pay interest in advance for a period that goes beyond the end of the tax year, you must spread this interest over the tax years to which it applies. Generally, you can deduct in each year only the interest that qualifies as home mortgage interest for that year. An exception (discussed later) applies to points.\n\nLate payment charge on mortgage payment.\n\nYou can deduct as home mortgage interest a late payment charge if it wasn't for a specific service in connection with your mortgage loan.\n\nMortgage prepayment penalty.\n\nIf you pay off your home mortgage early, you may have to pay a penalty. You can deduct that penalty as home mortgage interest, provided the penalty isn't for a specific service performed or cost incurred in connection with your mortgage loan.\n\nGround rent.\n\nIn some states (such as Maryland), you may buy your home subject to a ground rent. A ground rent is an obligation you assume to pay a fixed amount per year on the property. Under this arrangement, you are leasing (rather than buying) the land on which your home is located.\n\nRedeemable ground rents.\n\nIf you make annual or periodic rental payments on a redeemable ground rent, you can deduct the payments as mortgage interest. The ground rent is a redeemable ground rent only if all of the following are true.\n\nYour lease, including renewal periods, is for more than 15 years.\n\nYou can freely assign the lease.\n\nYou have a present or future right (under state or local law) to end the lease and buy the lessor's entire interest in the land by paying a specified amount.\n\nThe lessor's interest in the land is primarily a security interest to protect the rental payments to which the lessor is entitled.\n\nPayments made to end the lease and buy the lessor's entire interest in the land aren't redeemable ground rents. You can't deduct them.\n\nNonredeemable ground rents.\n\nPayments on a nonredeemable ground rent aren't mortgage interest. You can deduct them as rent only if they are a business expense or if they are for rental property.\n\nCooperative apartment.\n\nYou can usually treat the interest on a loan you took out to buy stock in a cooperative housing corporation as home mortgage interest if you own a cooperative apartment, and the cooperative housing corporation meets the conditions described earlier under Special Rules for Cooperatives. In addition, you can treat as home mortgage interest your share of the corporation's deductible mortgage interest. Figure your share of mortgage interest the same way that is shown for figuring your share of real estate taxes in the Example under Division of real estate taxes, earlier. For more information on cooperatives, see Special Rule for Tenant-Stockholders in Cooperative Housing Corporations in Pub. 936.\n\nRefund of cooperative's mortgage interest.\n\nYou must reduce your mortgage interest deduction by your share of any cash portion of a patronage dividend that the cooperative receives. The patronage dividend is a partial refund to the cooperative housing corporation of mortgage interest it paid in a prior year.\n\nIf you receive a Form 1098 from the cooperative housing corporation, the form should show only the amount you can deduct.\n\nSBA disaster home loans.\n\nInterest paid on disaster home loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) is deductible as mortgage interest if the requirements discussed earlier under Home Mortgage Interest are met.\n\nMortgage Interest Paid at Settlement\n\nOne item that normally appears on a settlement or closing statement is home mortgage interest.\n\nYou can deduct the interest that you pay at settlement if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). This amount should be included in the mortgage interest statement provided by your lender. See the discussion under Mortgage Interest Statement, later. Also, if you pay interest in advance, see Prepaid interest, earlier, and Points next.\n\nThe term “points” is used to describe certain charges paid, or treated as paid, by a borrower to obtain a home mortgage. Points may also be called loan origination fees, maximum loan charges, loan discount, or discount points.\n\nA borrower is treated as paying any points that a home seller pays for the borrower's mortgage. See Points paid by the seller, later.\n\nGeneral rule.\n\nYou can't deduct the full amount of points in the year paid. They are prepaid interest, so you must generally deduct them over the life (term) of the mortgage.\n\nException.\n\nYou can deduct the full amount of points in the year paid if you meet all the following tests.\n\nYour loan is secured by your main home. (Generally, your main home is the one you live in most of the time.)\n\nPaying points is an established business practice in the area where the loan was made.\n\nThe points paid weren't more than the points generally charged in that area.\n\nYou use the cash method of accounting. This means you report income in the year you receive it and deduct expenses in the year you pay them. Most individuals use this method.\n\nThe points weren't paid in place of amounts that are ordinarily stated separately on the settlement statement, such as appraisal fees, inspection fees, title fees, attorney fees, and property taxes.\n\nThe funds you provided at or before closing, plus any points the seller paid, were at least as much as the points charged. The funds you provided aren't required to have been applied to the points. They can include a down payment, an escrow deposit, earnest money, and other funds you paid at or before closing for any purpose. You can't have borrowed these funds.\n\nYou use your loan to buy or build your main home.\n\nThe points were figured as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage.\n\nThe amount is clearly shown on the settlement statement (such as the Uniform Settlement Statement, Form HUD-1) as points charged for the mortgage. The points may be shown as paid from either your funds or the seller's.\n\nNote.\n\nIf you meet all of the tests listed above and you itemize your deductions in the year you get the loan, you can either deduct the full amount of points in the year paid or deduct them over the life of the loan, beginning in the year you get the loan. If you do not itemize your deductions in the year you get the loan, you can spread the points over the life of the loan and deduct the appropriate amount in each future year, if any, when you do itemize your deductions.\n\nHome improvement loan.\n\nYou can also fully deduct in the year paid points paid on a loan to substantially improve your main home if you meet the first six tests listed earlier.\n\nRefinanced loan.\n\nIf you use part of the refinanced mortgage proceeds to substantially improve your main home and you meet the first six tests listed earlier, you can fully deduct the part of the points related to the improvement in the year you paid them with your own funds. You can deduct the rest of the points over the life of the loan.\n\nPoints not fully deductible in year paid.\n\nIf you don’t qualify under the exception to deduct the full amount of points in the year paid (or choose not to do so), see Points in Pub. 936 for the rules on when and how much you can deduct.\n\nFigure A.\n\nYou can use Figure A as a quick guide to see whether your points are fully deductible in the year paid.\n\nFigure A. Are My Points Fully Deductible This Year?\n\nFigure A.

See the discussion on Points.\n\nContinue To End\n\nProcess (b)\n\nYou can fully deduct the points this year on Schedule A (Form 1040).\n\nContinue To End\n\nEnd\n\nThis is the ending of the flowchart.\n\nPlease click here for the text description of the image.\n\nAmounts charged for services.\n\nAmounts charged by the lender for specific services connected to the loan aren't interest. Examples of these charges are:\n\nAppraisal fees,\n\nNotary fees,\n\nPreparation costs for the mortgage note or deed of trust, and\n\nMortgage insurance premiums.\n\nYou can't deduct these amounts as points either in the year paid or over the life of the mortgage. For information about the tax treatment of these amounts and other settlement fees and closing costs, see Basis, later.\n\nPoints paid by the seller.\n\nThe term “points” includes loan placement fees that the seller pays to the lender to arrange financing for the buyer.\n\nTreatment by seller.\n\nThe seller can't deduct these fees as interest. However, they are a selling expense that reduces the seller's amount realized. See Pub. 523 for more information.\n\nTreatment by buyer.\n\nThe buyer treats seller-paid points as if the buyer had paid them. If all the tests listed earlier under Exception are met, the buyer can deduct the points in the year paid. If any of those tests aren't met, the buyer must deduct the points over the life of the loan.\n\nThe buyer must also reduce the basis of the home by the amount of the seller-paid points. For more information about the basis of your home, see Basis, later.\n\nFunds provided are less than points.\n\nIf you meet all the tests listed earlier under Exception except that the funds you provided were less than the points charged to you (test 6), you can deduct the points in the year paid up to the amount of funds you provided. In addition, you can deduct any points paid by the seller.\n\nExample 1.\n\nWhen you took out a $100,000 mortgage loan to buy your home in December, you were charged one point ($1,000). You meet all the tests for deducting points in the year paid (see Exception, earlier), except the only funds you provided were a $750 down payment. Of the $1,000 you were charged for points, you can deduct $750 in the year paid. You spread the remaining $250 over the life of the mortgage.\n\nExample 2.\n\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the person who sold you your home also paid one point ($1,000) to help you get your mortgage. In the year paid, you can deduct $1,750 ($750 of the amount you were charged plus the $1,000 paid by the seller). You spread the remaining $250 over the life of the mortgage. You must reduce the basis of your home by the $1,000 paid by the seller.\n\nExcess points.\n\nIf you meet all the tests under Exception, earlier, except that the points paid were more than are generally charged in your area (test 3), you can deduct in the year paid only the points that are generally charged. You must spread any additional points over the life of the mortgage.\n\nMortgage ending early.\n\nIf you spread your deduction for points over the life of the mortgage, you can deduct any remaining balance in the year the mortgage ends. A mortgage may end early due to a prepayment, refinancing, foreclosure, or similar event.\n\nExample.\n\nDan paid $3,000 in points in 2015 that he had to spread out over the 15-year life of the mortgage. He had deducted $1,600 of these points through 2022.\n\nDan prepaid his mortgage in full in 2023. He can deduct the remaining $1,400 of points in 2023.\n\nException.\n\nIf you refinance the mortgage with the same lender, you can't deduct any remaining points for the year. Instead, deduct them over the term of the new loan.\n\nForm 1098.\n\nThe mortgage interest statement you receive should show not only the total interest paid during the year, but also your deductible points paid during the year. See Mortgage Interest Statement, later.\n\nWhere To Deduct Home Mortgage Interest\n\nEnter on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a, the home mortgage interest and points reported to you on Form 1098 (discussed next). If you didn't receive a Form 1098, enter your deductible interest on line 8b, and any deductible points on line 8c. See Table 1 for a summary of where to deduct home mortgage interest and state and local real estate taxes.\n\nIf you paid home mortgage interest to the person from whom you bought your home, show that person's name, address, and social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN) on the dotted lines next to line 8b. The seller must give you this number and you must give the seller your SSN. Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, can be used for this purpose. Failure to meet either of these requirements may result in a $50 penalty for each failure.\n\nTable 1. Where To Deduct Interest and Taxes Paid on Your Home\n\nSee the text for information on what expenses are eligible.\n\nIF you are eligible to deduct . . . THEN report the amount\n\non Schedule A (Form 1040) . . . state and local real estate taxes line 5b. home mortgage interest and points reported on Form 1098 line 8a. home mortgage interest not reported on Form 1098 line 8b. points not reported on Form 1098 line 8c.\n\nMortgage Interest Statement\n\nIf you paid $600 or more of mortgage interest (including certain points during the year) on any one mortgage to a mortgage holder in the course of that holder's trade or business, you should receive a Form 1098 or similar statement from the mortgage holder. The statement will show the total interest paid on your mortgage during the year. If you bought a main home during the year, it will also show the deductible points you paid and any points you can deduct that were paid by the person who sold you your home. See Points, earlier.\n\nThe interest you paid at settlement should be included on the statement. If it isn't, add the interest from the settlement sheet that qualifies as home mortgage interest to the total shown on Form 1098 or similar statement. Put the total on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a, and attach a statement to your return explaining the difference. Enter “See attached” to the right of line 8a.\n\nA mortgage holder can be a financial institution, a governmental unit, or a cooperative housing corporation. If a statement comes from a cooperative housing corporation, it will generally show your share of interest.\n\nYour mortgage interest statement for 2023 should be provided or sent to you by January 31, 2024. If it is mailed, you should allow adequate time to receive it before contacting the mortgage holder. A copy of this form will also be sent to the IRS.\n\nExample.\n\nYou bought a new home on May 3. You paid no points on the purchase. During the year, you made mortgage payments that included $4,480 deductible interest on your new home. The settlement sheet for the purchase of the home included interest of $620 for 29 days in May. The mortgage statement you receive from the lender includes total interest of $5,100 ($4,480 + $620). You can deduct the $5,100 if you itemize your deductions.\n\nRefund of overpaid interest.\n\nIf you receive a refund of mortgage interest you overpaid in a prior year, you will generally receive a Form 1098 showing the refund in box 4. Generally, you must include the refund in income in the year you receive it. See Refund of home mortgage interest, earlier, under Home Mortgage Interest.\n\nMore than one borrower.\n\nIf you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if you file a joint return) were liable for and paid interest on a mortgage that was for your home, and the other person received a Form 1098 showing the interest that was paid during the year, attach a statement to your paper return explaining this. Show how much of the interest each of you paid, and give the name and address of the person who received the form. Deduct your share of the interest on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8b, and enter “See attached” to the right of that line.\n\nHome Acquisition Debt\n\nHome acquisition debt is a mortgage you took out after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home. It must also be secured by that home.\n\nIf the amount of your mortgage is more than the cost of the home plus the cost of any substantial improvements, only the debt that is not more than the cost of the home plus improvements qualifies as home acquisition debt.\n\nHome acquisition debt limit.\n\nThe total amount you can treat as home acquisition debt at any time on your home cannot be more than $1 million ($500,000 if married filing separately). However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, there is a further limitation. If you purchased your home during this time, the total amount you can treat as home acquisition debt at any time on your home generally cannot be more than $750,000 ($375,000 if married filing separately).\n\nDischarges of qualified principal residence indebtedness.\n\nYou can exclude from gross income any discharges of qualified principal residence indebtedness made after 2006 and in most cases before 2026. You must reduce the basis of your principal residence (but not below zero) by the amount you exclude.\n\nPrincipal residence.\n\nYour principal residence is the home where you ordinarily live most of the time. You can have only one principal residence at any one time.\n\nQualified principal residence indebtedness.\n\nThis indebtedness is a mortgage that you took out to buy, build, or substantially improve your principal residence and that is secured by that residence. If the amount of your original mortgage is more than the cost of your principal residence plus the cost of substantial improvements, qualified principal residence indebtedness can’t be more than the cost of your principal residence plus improvements.\n\nAny debt secured by your principal residence that you use to refinance qualified principal residence indebtedness is qualified principal residence indebtedness up to the amount of your old mortgage principal just before the refinancing. Additional debt incurred to substantially improve your principal residence is also qualified principal residence indebtedness.\n\nAmount you can exclude.\n\nYou can only exclude debt discharged after 2006 and in most cases before 2026. The most you can exclude is $750,000 ($375,000 if married filing separately). You can’t exclude any amount that was discharged because of services performed for the lender or on account of any other factor not directly related either to a decline in the value of your residence or to your financial condition.\n\nOrdering rule.\n\nIf only a part of a loan is qualified principal residence indebtedness, you can exclude only the amount of the discharge that is more than the amount of the loan (immediately before the discharge) that is not qualified principal residence indebtedness.\n\nQualified Home\n\nThis means your main home or your second home. A home includes a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, house trailer, boat, or similar property that has sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities.\n\nMain home.\n\nYou can have only one main home at any one time. This is the home where you ordinarily live most of the time.\n\nSecond home and other special situations.\n\nIf you have a second home, use part of your home for other than residential living (such as a home office), rent out part of your home, or are having your home constructed, see Qualified Home in Pub. 936.\n\nHow To Get Tax Help\n\nIf you have questions about a tax issue; need help preparing your tax return; or want to download free publications, forms, or instructions, go to IRS.gov to find resources that can help you right away.\n\nPreparing and filing your tax return.\n\nAfter receiving all your wage and earnings statements (Forms W-2, W-2G, 1099-R, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, etc.); unemployment compensation statements (by mail or in a digital format) or other government payment statements (Form 1099-G); and interest, dividend, and retirement statements from banks and investment firms (Forms 1099), you have several options to choose from to prepare and file your tax return.

If you choose to have someone prepare your tax return, choose that preparer wisely. A paid tax preparer is:\n\nPrimarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return,\n\nRequired to sign the return, and\n\nRequired to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).\n\n. Although the tax preparer always signs the return, you're ultimately responsible for providing all the information required for the preparer to accurately prepare your return and for the accuracy of every item reported on the return. Anyone paid to prepare tax returns for others should have a thorough understanding of tax matters. For more information on how to choose a tax preparer, go to Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer on IRS.gov..\n\nEmployers can register to use Business Services Online.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) offers online service at SSA.gov/employer for fast, free, and secure W-2 filing options to CPAs, accountants, enrolled agents, and individuals who process Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement.\n\nIRS social media.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/SocialMedia to see the various social media tools the IRS uses to share the latest information on tax changes, scam alerts, initiatives, products, and services.

If you don’t have a bank account, go to IRS.gov/DirectDeposit for more information on where to find a bank or credit union that can open an account online.\n\nReporting and resolving your tax-related identity theft issues.\n\nTax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit.\n\nThe IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n\nGet an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns. When you have an IP PIN, it prevents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN.\n\nWays to check on the status of your refund.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Refunds.\n\nDownload the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status.\n\nCall the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954.\n\n. The IRS can’t issue refunds before mid-February for returns that claimed the EIC or the additional child tax credit (ACTC). This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits..\n\nMaking a tax payment.\n\nPayments of U.S. tax must be remitted to the IRS in U.S. dollars. Digital assets are not accepted. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for information on how to make a payment using any of the following options.\n\nIRS Direct Pay: Pay your individual tax bill or estimated tax payment directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you.\n\nDebit Card, Credit Card, or Digital Wallet: Choose an approved payment processor to pay online or by phone.\n\nElectronic Funds Withdrawal: Schedule a payment when filing your federal taxes using tax return preparation software or through a tax professional.\n\nElectronic Federal Tax Payment System: Best option for businesses.

Contact your financial institution for availability, cost, and time frames.\n\nNote.\n\nThe IRS uses the latest encryption technology to ensure that the electronic payments you make online, by phone, or from a mobile device using the IRS2Go app are safe and secure. Paying electronically is quick, easy, and faster than mailing in a check or money order.\n\nWhat if I can’t pay now?\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Payments for more information about your options.\n\nApply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/OPA) to meet your tax obligation in monthly installments if you can’t pay your taxes in full today. Once you complete the online process, you will receive immediate notification of whether your agreement has been approved.\n\nUse the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier to see if you can settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. For more information on the Offer in Compromise program, go to IRS.gov/OIC.\n\nFiling an amended return.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Form1040X for information and updates.\n\nChecking the status of your amended return.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/WMAR to track the status of Form 1040-X amended returns.\n\n. It can take up to 3 weeks from the date you filed your amended return for it to show up in our system, and processing it can take up to 16 weeks..\n\nUnderstanding an IRS notice or letter you’ve received.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Notices to find additional information about responding to an IRS notice or letter.\n\nResponding to an IRS notice or letter.\n\nYou can now upload responses to all notices and letters using the Document Upload Tool. For notices that require additional action, taxpayers will be redirected appropriately on IRS.gov to take further action. To learn more about the tool, go to IRS.gov/Upload.\n\nNote.\n\nYou can use Schedule LEP (Form 1040), Request for Change in Language Preference, to state a preference to receive notices, letters, or other written communications from the IRS in an alternative language. You may not immediately receive written communications in the requested language. The IRS’s commitment to LEP taxpayers is part of a multi-year timeline that began providing translations in 2023. You will continue to receive communications, including notices and letters, in English until they are translated to your preferred language.\n\nContacting your local TAC.\n\nKeep in mind, many questions can be answered on IRS.gov without visiting a TAC. Go to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for the topics people ask about most. If you still need help, TACs provide tax help when a tax issue can’t be handled online or by phone. All TACs now provide service by appointment, so you’ll know in advance that you can get the service you need without long wait times. Before you visit, go to IRS.gov/TACLocator to find the nearest TAC and to check hours, available services, and appointment options. Or, on the IRS2Go app, under the Stay Connected tab, choose the Contact Us option and click on “Local Offices.”\n\nThe Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) Is Here To Help You\n\nWhat Is TAS?\n\nTAS is an independent organization within the IRS that helps taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. TAS strives to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n\nHow Can You Learn About Your Taxpayer Rights?\n\nThe Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. Go to TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov to help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are your rights. Know them. Use them.\n\nWhat Can TAS Do for You?\n\nTAS can help you resolve problems that you can’t resolve with the IRS. And their service is free. If you qualify for their assistance, you will be assigned to one advocate who will work with you throughout the process and will do everything possible to resolve your issue. TAS can help you if:\n\nYour problem is causing financial difficulty for you, your family, or your business;\n\nYou face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action; or\n\nYou’ve tried repeatedly to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.\n\nLow Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs)\n\nLITCs are independent from the IRS and TAS. LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with the IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition, LITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, go to the LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/LITC or see IRS Pub. 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List, at IRS.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4134.pdf."
