        "text": "It may not be your first instinct to see a chiropractor if you’re having a hard time conceiving but here are some reasons why seeing a chiropractor should be your first stop on your pregnancy journey!\n\nChiropractic Care\n\nOne of the basic premises of chiropractic care is that vertebral subluxations affect nerve function and transmission. Think of your brain as a computer which coordinates, via your nervous system, the functions of your organs and cells. Nerve messages can be interrupted by spinal (and pelvic) subluxations, which occur when there are misalignments of one or more vertebrae.\n\nThe nervous system will effectively integrate the chemical, physical and emotional information between the brain and all systems of the body, including the reproductive systems. Among other effects, vertebral subluxations can compromise optimal reproductive system function and our capacity to conceive.\n\nWhen our nervous system works well, we are better able to adapt to our environment and its stressors, which in turn influence our capacity to reproduce. Physical traumas such as car accidents, sporting injuries, falls and even long-term, “invisible” trauma caused by poor posture or stress can all impact the function of the nervous system.\n\nIn one review published in the Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics (2008), the case studies of eleven “infertile” women, aged 22 to 42, were examined. Ten of the women were actively trying to become pregnant and had been unsuccessful. Their pregnancy histories included one natural childbirth, two miscarriages, two failed IVF treatments and three failed artificial inseminations. Within 1 to 20 months of receiving chiropractic care, all eleven women had become pregnant. They all had adjustments made to vertebral subluxations in their spines using a variety of chiropractic techniques. Nine of the eleven received no other medical care during this time. This is one example in the growing body of research that suggests chiropractic care improves reproductive system function.\n\nThere is no exclusive fertility cure-all for couples. These proactive recommendations are designed to allow the body to balance itself and recreate its own “order.” Health practitioners cannot take credit for the magnificent design of the human body, which has an innate intelligence working to heal itself.\n\nIf couples take the time to listen to their own bodies, they will receive invaluable advice, for the body is always sending messages. This does not mean we need be alone, passive or inactive in the healing process. Given the right support and enough time, the body has repeatedly shown that it is capable of transforming “dis-ease” and dysfunction into wellness…and for many couples, “infertility” into fertility.\n\nRegardless of the type of chiropractic technique used, when subluxations are addressed, nerve function is improved and reproductive and endocrine function is enhanced.\n\n**Adapted from Pathways Magazine and Jennifer Barham-Floreani, DC\n\nChiropractic care once you’re pregnant:\n\nChiropractic care before and during pregnancy is an essential element of our prenatal care choices. Obstetrical texts report that difficult labors are caused by pelvic imbalances and its resulting effects on your uterus and the baby’s position. Care at Lake Pointe Chiropractic & Wellness restores balance to your pelvic muscles and ligaments which leads to easier births with fewer interventions such as pitocin, forceps, vacuum extractions and cesarean sections. Chiropractic adjustments not only reduce physical aches and pains, they remove interference on your nervous system allowing your uterus to function at maximal potential, and your baby to get into an optimal position for birth. This supports safer, and more satisfying labor and deliveries.\n\nFunctional medicine:\n\nMany chiropractors also special in Functional Medicine, which looks at the root cause of illness, rather than covering up symptoms or administering harmful medications. If you’re struggling with infertility, your chiropractor / functional medicine doctor can help you get to the root cause of your symptoms often through utilizing objective lab testing (both from your medical doctor and our office) to determine the cause of your infertility. At Lake Pointe, we use combinations of nutrients/supplements and other healing modalities to heal your body vs. using medications to reach your health goals.\n\nYour chiropractor / functional medicine doctor will also look at lifestyle, diet and mental health to ensure that you are addressing all areas of your health. “Certain lifestyle factors, such as poor diet, stress and the use of medication (inluding antibiotics and the contraceptive pill), can deplete critical nutrients and minerals necessary for reproductive success. Research indicates that the contraceptive pill alters the uptake and utilisation of the vitamin B groups, as well as vitamins A, C, E, K, folic acid, biotin, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, zinc and copper. Studies also revealed that vitamin E deficiency in animals can lead to infertility, that zinc supplementation can improve intrauterine growth, and that women who reported using iron supplements were 40% less likely to have ovulation-related infertility than non-users.” (Jennifer Barham-Floreani, MD in Pathways Magazine is Replenish Your Body. )\n\nRather than looking at each system independently and going to several different “-ologists”, functional medicine reveals how each system of the body can impact the whole and why a missing link in communication or support in one system impacts the whole body, including other systems in the body.\n\nDutch Test\n\nWhen looking at infertility, the Dutch Plus test with Cortisol Awakening Response is an excellent test that takes an in-depth look how your body is using it’s hormones. By looking at your sex hormones and cortisol from a functional standpoint, your doctor at Lake Pointe can find the imbalances and deficiencies that cause your symptoms. The DUTCH Plus™ adds the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) to look deeper at your stress response and how it impacts your body and your ability to conceive.\n\nYou can order the Dutch Plus with CAR test here.\n\nDetoxing\n\nIf you’re trying to conceive, it’s imperative that you take steps to ensure your bodies are clean and your reproductive systems are in the best possible working order. We recommend all couples looking to conceive, to do a 7-day detox to flush out toxins and increase your chances of fertility. You can read more about that detox week here.\n\nSupplementation\n\nYour chiropractor has access to many beneficial and natural supplements and vitamins to nourish your body, flush out toxins and to increase fertility. Vitamins are an essential part of any healthy life—but they’re even more important when you’re trying for a baby.\n\nIt’s a common misconception that you only need to take vitamins once you’re pregnant. However, we strongly recommend all our patients begin a vitamin regimen before, during, and after pregnancy.\n\nWhy?\n\nBefore you conceive, vitamins are necessary to help prepare your body by supplying it with the vital nutrients it needs to fulfill the nutritional and physical demands of pregnancy.\n\nWhile you’re pregnant, these vitamins will continue to help support your body and your developing baby with all the nutrients you need for a healthy pregnancy.\n\nAnd after pregnancy, it’s important for a baby’s healthy growth to continue supplying your body with these nutrients that will be transferred to your baby through your breast milk.\n\nOur top choice for prenatal vitamins\n\nThe Prenatal Complete with DHA by Ortho Molecular is our top choice for getting women’s bodies in good health prior to having a baby, during pregnancy, and post-birth while breastfeeding.\n\nWe recommend the Prenatal Complete because it contains the main nutrients that are extremely important for a healthy baby: iron, magnesium, DHA, active folate, and calcium.\n\nThis specific formula also contains DHA, which is an omega-3 fatty acid. This essential nutrient is extremely important throughout all stages of pregnancy, but especially while you’re pregnant so it can help support the healthy development of the fetal brain, retina, and cognitive and motor functions.\n\nWe also like the Prenatal Complete with DHA because it’s formulated to be free of gluten, soy, yeast, milk, eggs, nuts, artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives and additives, making it safe for anyone with food allergies.\n\nMany over-the-counter prenatals can contain a lot of dyes, chemicals, and toxins that may be unsafe for you and your baby. They can also contain folic acid, which is not what you want in a prenatal vitamin. Many people can’t convert folic acid into an absorbable nutrient in their body.\n\nFolate, however, is very important to a baby’s development. It prevents birth defects, promotes healthy spine and nervous system development, and is much easier for your body to absorb. Luckily, Ortho Molecular’s Prenatal Complete is made with folate vs. folic acid.\n\nThese very important details in a prenatal vitamin are why we always recommend vitamins and supplements from health industry innovators like Ortho Molecular.\n\nOther services your chiropractic office may offer: Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine"
