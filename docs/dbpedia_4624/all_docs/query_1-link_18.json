        "text": "Should I Sell My House “For Sale By Owner” (FSBO)?\n\nAre You Really Saving Money?\n\nAccording to the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), sellers who engage the services of a REALTOR® will sell their homes an average of 18% higher priced than FSBO*. In most cases, the 3% co-op fee that FSBO’s are trying to save is recouped with an increased net sales price.\n\nUltimately, a higher net sales price is achieved through proper pricing, professional staging and photography, effective national marketing, experienced negotiating and evaluation of offers and shorter marketing time.\n\nTiming Is Everything\n\nSome sellers want to sell as quickly as possible while others want or need to coordinate timing of a home sale to coincide with the purchase of a new home, completion of a new build, a move out-of-state or perhaps transitioning to a senior community or alternative living situation.\n\nAccording to the NAR, sellers who engage the services of a REALTOR® sell faster than FSBO*. If contract terms need to be negotiated to accommodate a special seller move timeline, an experienced REALTOR® can typically negotiate terms that meet your specific needs.\n\nDo You Have the Experience Needed?\n\nAn average home-owner buys and sells 5 houses in their LIFETIME. Most LifePoint Real Estate agents are full-time REALTORS® selling on average 2-17 houses each MONTH.\n\nWe are EXPERTS in our field and know the Central Ohio real estate market.\n\nLifePoint Real Estate agents evaluate and market properties AND negotiate contracts and request-to-remedies like it’s our JOB… because it is!\n\nAre You Protected Legally?\n\nWhat happens if you make an error in disclosure, documentation or unintentional misrepresentation? Professional REALTORS® typically carry a minimum of $1M in errors and omissions insurance….DO YOU?\n\nIs it worth the risk in this litigious society to manage this important transaction on your own?\n\nWho Are You Letting Inside Your Home?\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is honest, qualified and/or truly interested in potentially purchasing your home but may have ulterior motives for accessing your property.\n\nWhen you are represented by a professional REALTOR®, no one is permitted to enter your home without a real estate salesperson accompanying them AND a secure, time-restricted lockbox is installed for your protection.\n\nAre you vetting buyers before allowing them inside your home and possibly putting yourself, your family and belongings at risk?\n\nLearn More About Your Options"
