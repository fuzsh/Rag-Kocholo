        "text": "HI, I'M LONI!\n\nSHE / HER\n\nI am the founder and owner of LP Creative Events, I have lived in Colorado for 12 years with my husband, our dogs, Dax and Penny, and horse, Dusty. I have been a planner and logistics wizard for as long as I can remember!\n\n​​​\n\nI have a wide range of experience from planning weddings, engagement parties, galas, golf tournaments, luncheons, grand openings, large scale experiential marketing events, and 5Ks and endurance events!\n\nI am a Certified Wedding Industry Professional and I am serving on the National Board of Directors for WIPA as their Secretary for 2024. I am a Full Time Professor at the University of Colorado Boulder teaching in the Advertising, PR, and Design Department.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to planning events, I have been a keynote speaker and panelist for industry events and organizations like PartySlate, Wedding Industry Professionals Association, Boulder Wedding Showcase, and the International Wedding Summit in Rome, Italy.\n\nHI, I AM LYDIA!\n\nSHE / HER\n\nI am the Senior Lead Planner + Events Manager with LP Creative Events! I recently relocated to Denver from my small Oregon town of Hood River where I worked as a venue, catering, and planning lead.\n\nAfter receiving an extensive hospitality education at my family restaurant, I couldn’t deny my love for creating and executing memorable experiences for others. With a degree in Hospitality Management from Colorado State University and my experience in food service, floral design, and events, I am thrilled to be planning weddings and events back in beautiful Colorado!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the challenge of taking an idea and making it a reality (no matter how out of the box) and look forward to helping you make your wedding day dreams come true!\n\n​\n\n\"Loni is a powerhouse and is who you need to have the wedding of your dreams. We were fortunate enough to have Loni help us with full planning!. She helped us to find the absolute best team of vendors. Our wedding ended up being held in Salt Lake City but we interviewed her in Denver before moving to SLC. She was confident in her ability to help us coordinate and plan a wedding in a city that she hadn’t worked in before and in the end, she blew it out of the water. She even took the time to fly out several months before our big day to meet vendors and become familiar with our site. She’s the type of planner that really becomes a friend during the planning process and I’m so happy we found her. On our wedding day, she was an encouraging and calming presence but I honestly had no idea what she was doing most of the day while everything went perfectly. I feel like that’s the sign of a well seasoned wedding planner/coordinator. It took no more than five minutes to show her where our 20+ boxes of knick-knacks were and in the end, everything was set up just as I had envisioned. We stopped by the next morning to pick everything up and she had even loaded our car up with all of our packed boxes! We couldn’t recommend Loni more highly.\"\n\nJanine + Jake, UT"
