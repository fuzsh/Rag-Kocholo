        "text": "It’s no secret that Melbourne’s inner north is dominated by some pretty epic thoroughfares (both Smith Street and Gertrude Street have landed on this list in the past – in first and second place, no less), but in 2024 there’s another contender nipping at their heels. Enter High Street, which weaves through the ultra-trendy suburbs of Northcote, Thornbury and Preston, and is easily accessible from the CBD via the 86 tram line (a route so beloved it scored its own music festival last year). High Street’s bona fide cool status comes down to its unique, something-for-everyone local businesses. Craving authentic Portuguese tarts? Head to Casa Nata. Want to sip a local natty vino? Make a beeline for Northside Wines. Got the urge for a late-night boogie? Hit up Francesca’s Bar. It’s a strip where vintage stores and cool cafés sit comfortably alongside a food truck park and boutique indie cinema. We hate to be clichéd and say there’s something for everyone on High Street, but in this case it’s true.\n\nEAT The signature lasagne at 1800 Lasagne, of course. These saucy slabs ​​feature a mix of pork and beef mince, a creamy bechamel layer, silky pasta sheets and an oh-so-rich sauce.\n\nDRINK We Melburnians love a rooftop bar, and High Street’s home to a real beauty in Gigi Rooftop. Intimate and exclusive (the teeny space is accessible only via Umberto Espresso Bar), it’s the go-to spot for a Spritz at sundown with a side of sweeping suburban views.\n\nDO Catch a gig at one of High Street’s many live music venues. Whether it’s at legendary locations like Northcote Social Club and the Croxton Band Room, or smaller spots like High Note and Shotkickers, all music tastes are catered for.\n\nHollywood Road is one of Hong Kong’s oldest streets: this bustling artery through Central and Sheung Wan dates back to 1844. It pre-dates LA’s famous entertainment district – according to legend, the street likely got its name from the holly bushes that once lined its edges. But right now, it’s where all of the city’s coolest new venues are popping up. Walk this 1km-long stretch and you’ll see everything from the Man Mo Temple to the Mid-Levels Escalator made famous in 90s movie Chungking Express, alongside heritage site-turned-arts and culture hubs like Tai Kwun and PMQ. Hollywood Road does it all: it’s a treasure trove of antiques, a culinary hotspot home to the city's best bars and restaurants, and a hub for the arts, with murals, installations and galleries around every corner.\n\nEAT The neighbourhood has plenty of great restaurants, but the most sought-after tables are on Hollywood Road – namely at Michelin-starred Tate Dining Room, which serves up adventurous and refined Chinese cuisine with a French touch.\n\nDRINK The milk-punch style Silk Stocking Cocktail at Lockdown, the latest Central speakeasy which is hidden behind a toilet bowl display.\n\nDO Mooch around the antique shops and art galleries – especially right now, as the city celebrates Arts Month every March.\n\nNo other street in Austin encapsulates the city's spirit more than this quarter mile of pavement east of I-35. While not constantly vying for the spotlight like other thoroughfares around town, East Eleventh earns its beloved status among locals by packing every square inch with incredible food, excellent coffee, a historic venue, and a backyard stage that evokes the bespoke approach Austinites take to keep the city’s soul alive. Buy locally designed dress boots from HELM, sample game-changing brisket from Franklin Barbeque, slide into speakeasy Busy Signal, and behold the iconic Austin moontowers.\n\nEAT A bacon, egg, and pimento cheese burger at one of the best rooftop brunch spots, Paperboy.\n\nDRINK A glass of wine in one of the various reading rooms with a new book in hand at Vintage Bookstore and Wine Bar.\n\nDO See a band perform in a makeshift venue that feels like a permanent house party (minus the house) at Kenny Dorham’s Backyard.\n\nSTAY Enjoy a maximalist-styled room at the paradoxically timeless and contemporary Frances Modern Inn.\n\nBuenos Aires’ culinary scene got its long overdue flowers last November when the Michelin Guide finally honoured the Argentine capital. Two of the city’s four newly green-starred restaurants are on Palermo Viejo’s Guatemala Street, as well as one of only two Michelin-starred restaurants: Don Julio, aka the world’s best parrilla. Much more than a casual steakhouse, this incarnation (literally) of meat culture is deeply rooted in local traditions of breeding and grilling; of wine and friends. And you’ll find that conviviality all over Guatemala Street. Even waiting in line for a table becomes a social occasion here – every night, you’ll see people hanging out by the old tram line enjoying glasses of Malbec. From humble origins to gourmet hub, this cobbled street sits at the heart of the historic Palermo Viejo, a formerly down-at-heel area that Jorge Luis Borges once called home.\n\nEAT Artisanal charcuterie, sirloin milanesa and any salad at the legendary El Preferido. This rustic venue, which opened in 1952 as a modest tavern, rears their own animals and grows their own vegetables. As with most restaurants on Guatemala Street, you’ll have to join the crowd outside if you want to get a table.\n\nDO People watch at Merienda, a glass corner cafe perfect for soaking up Palermo lifestyle and savouring nostalgic porteño food with a modern touch. Follow it up with a session at Ardha Bikram Yoga.\n\nDRINK Do as the locals do and ‘drink a helado’. The best place to slurp up your ice cream is Obrador Florida. Owner Mercedes Román uses agroecological seasonal fruits to create innovative flavours, like orange and lemon infused dulce de leche, and transforms the place into a cacao bar during winter.\n\nIn a city of rapid change, Commercial Drive remains defiantly ungentrified. McDonald’s and Starbucks tried and failed to stay the course, and the many clothing shops and boutiques are devoted either to vintage (see: The Only and Mintage) or ethically sourced items from far-off places (Wander Emporium, Paranada). Sure, there’s a low-flying doughnut chain outlet and one of the street’s best (former) dives is now a generic watering hole, but nearly everything else is unique and one-of-a-kind. Hip by default, the Drive (as it’s known to locals) also boasts a family-owned bowling alley, a plethora of coffee shops (try finding a seat on a nice day), no fewer than four used book shops and three record stores – and more pizza (and pizza slice) joints than you can shake a pepperoni stick at. Like many other vibrant neighbourhoods, the Drive is still suffering a post-2020 malaise – a street that once boasted five stages for live entertainment is now down to two – but it’s still the best hang-out-and-people-watch show in town.\n\nEAT Although pizza and sushi dominate the Drive, Lunch Lady’s modern take on Vietnamese street eats ensures the resto is almost always at capacity.\n\nDRINK Commercial Drive is the heart of Vancouver’s Little Italy, and Bar Corso is one of the newer Italian additions. The small, intimate establishment is a perfect date-night destination for a Negroni or Amaro, followed by a glass of Barolo and a grappa finish.\n\nDO Visit The Drive Canteen, a local snack bar with local and exotic eats, house-made sweets, and a large selection of non-alcoholic beer, wine, and mixed drinks.\n\nJalan Petaling is one of Kuala Lumpur’s oldest streets, home to the city’s first Chinese settlers in the nineteenth century. Over the last few years, it’s been experiencing a renaissance – you’ll find Kuala Lumpur’s oldest temples next door to colonial shophouses housing the newest dining and drinking joints. Begin the day with a cuppa and a spot of brunch (or start off at a kopitiam, a local-style coffeehouse), cosy up at a resto-bar, and come nightfall there’s always a party, whether you’re into drum ’n’ bass, jazz or reggae.\n\nEAT Modern Malaysian cuisine at Chocha Foodstore, championing locally sourced, seasonal ingredients and produce. Casual setting + communal dining = what’s not to love? After dinner, head upstairs to Botakliquor Bar for cocktails spotlighting local botanicals.\n\nDRINK Natural wines from around the world at the hole-in-the-wall resto-bar Small Shifting Space. Beers and cocktails are available too, plus tasting menus and sharing plates. On the top floor, find DJs on deck duty.\n\nDO At the very intersecting heart of Jalan Petaling, the haggler’s haven Chinatown still beats on with stalls peddling everything from snacks to souvenirs (and, of course, fake designer goods). Even if you’re not looking to shop, it’s a must-visit for foodies: for generations, Jalan Petaling has served up the city’s best street eats such as Hokkien-style fried noodles, sweet potato balls, tau foo fah (soybean pudding) and more.\n\nFew neighbourhoods in Lisbon have lived as many lives as Cais do Sodré, a neighbourhood which has grown beyond its nightlife legacy and become a place to shop local, have a family brunch and dinner with friends. Right next door to the original Time Out Market, Rua da Boavista is an excellent representation of the neighbourhood’s new chapter: a central thoroughfare where new ventures in eating, drinking and shopping sprout up all the time.\n\nBUY Stylish, organic cotton from +351, a Portuguese clothing brand known for its minimalist, unisex pieces. Look out for the colourful shark hanging from the ceiling.\n\nEAT Cav 86, Planto, and Tricky's may not be longtime tenants, but everyone already knows them on Rua da Boavista. The first is an ode to sharing, where seasonality takes the lead; the second, led by the rebellious chef Vítor Adão (known for fine dining restaurant Plano in the Graça neighbourhood), focuses on traditional Portuguese recipes; and the third emphasizes small producers and natural wines.\n\nDRINK Natural wine at Boavista Social Club, a place that reflects the trends and tastes of a changing Lisbon. Pair with French chef Marc Le Rohellec’s sharing plates and sets of jazz, disco, soul, and hip-hop for a relaxed night out typical of Cais do Sodré.\n\nNot too long ago, Botafogo’s Arnaldo Quintela would’ve been a ghost town after work hours. But over the last few years, this street has established itself as a culinary hotspot, and now you can hardly move for people filling its sidewalks each night. Old mechanic shops have become cosy places to eat and drink; groups gather inside and outside traditional bars like Xepa and Treme Treme; and hipster hangouts such as Calma are where to see and be seen. There are more upmarket restaurants for those who prefer to sip fine wine with a standout meal and there are plenty of places to dance ‘til late. If you’re cool, you’re probably there.\n\nEAT A slice of pizza with a sourdough crust, created by a New York awardwinning chef, on the rooftop at Ferro e Farinha.\n\nDRINK Any of the signature drinks at Quartinho Bar, one of the first places to open in the neighbourhood and a bar so cool their menu is a fanzine. Want a drink that pops in your mouth? Go for Miss Dynamite, Meu Amor with gin, strawberry, Aperol, Lillet, white vermouth, sparkling wine and explosive sugar.\n\nDO A bar crawl followed by a late night boogie (or headbang, whatever floats your boat). Culto is for rock fans and serves amazing burgers. Macuna plays hip hop and electro, while Mãe Joana is a go-to for samba. For Brazilian music, we have to once again recommend Quartinho – you can’t go wrong.\n\nJust two train stops away from Shibuya, Tokyo’s Sangenjaya neighbourhood has the ideal mix of city-centre excitement with the relaxed vibe of a mostly residential neighbourhood. Its main thoroughfare is Chazawa-dori, which is presided over by a giant gorilla jutting out from the rooftop of a FamilyMart convenience store. But this street has more to offer than an iconic photo opportunity. Every Sunday afternoon, Chazawa-dori is closed to traffic, making it the perfect time to explore this vibrant street on foot, popping in and out of friendly restaurants, cosy cafés, local grocers and charming bakeries. Start from the junction near Sangenjaya Station and you’ll eventually hit Shimokitazawa, one of Tokyo’s coolest neighbourhoods for thrift shopping and scoring vintage finds.\n\nEAT Sleek and modern Sancha Monica serves sushi with wine, as well as affordable kaisendon (raw seafood rice bowls) for weekday lunch.\n\nDRINK Guuutara Coffee specialises in OTT cream soda floats topped with ice cream, fresh fruit and more.\n\nDO Just around the corner from the intersection is Carrot Tower, home to a top-floor observation deck, where you can take in an aerial view of Tokyo for free.\n\nSince Consell de Cent’s pedestrianisation, Eixample no longer feels like a chore to walk through – there are now over 6 kilometres that cut right through the city's core, from Joan Miró Park to Passeig de Sant Joan. It's a vibrant stretch, lined with restaurants, boutiques, and hangout spots – walking down Consell de Cent is like taking a stroll through a microcosm of Barcelona. You've got everything from the latest crazes like Chinese hot pot joints, CBD shops, and beauty salons to timeless favourites like vermouth bars, cozy tortilla spots, and artisan bakeries.\n\nEAT Dive into an authentic Neapolitan pie at Da Michele, or treat yourself to some of the city's finest gelato at Delacrem (just be prepared to wait in line).\n\nDRINK A classic vermouth at Morro Fi, where they've breathed new life into the age-old aperitif scene.\n\nDO Soak up some culture at one of Consell de Cent’s many galleries – Mayoral just unveiled a slick new space this February. And when the night rolls around, hit up one of the vibrant LGBTQ+ spots like Priscilla Café or Plata Cocktail Bar.\n\nThis buzzy inner-city boulevard in the heart of Cape Town has been a hub for the ‘Mother City’ for centuries. The street was named because it was bree – ‘wide’, in Afrikaans – enough to turn an ox cart at the nearby market, and today you’ll often find yourself jostling for space. Bree Street comes filled with boutiques and bars, restaurants and art galleries showcasing the best the city has to offer. And it’s set for an injection of new energy in 2025 with the redevelopment of the City Park building, a former hospital which will become a multifunctional hub of apartments, restaurants, co-working spaces and a design-driven international hotel brand.\n\nEAT At Boma, chef Vusi Ndlovu (also at Time Out Market Cape Town) brings a contemporary lens to pan-African street food, while Gypsy Rabbit does the same for flame-grilled South African shisa nyama. Across the street, Nikkei serves up a delicious Japanese-Peruvian fusion.\n\nDRINK Cape wine at Culture Wine Bar, cocktails at fable and The Drinkery, and artisan coffee at Rosetta Roastery.\n\nDO Bree is a hub for the monthly First Thursdays events, with inner-city galleries open late, but any day of the week you can tap into the city’s creative spirit: the Youngblood Foundation, Sisonke and Reservoir galleries provide a platform for ascendant African artists. Or release your own inner artist at Tuft Crowd and Clay Café. For something more active, Rook Cycles offers free guided group rides on Wednesday evenings.\n\nDay or night, there’s an unbelievable amount of stuff happening on Oranienstraße. In the evening, the strip is thick with revellers, amping themselves up to dance past dawn at one of Berlin’s world-famous clubs. Meet them in eclectic bars like the dimly lit, gritty and ever-so-trendy Café Luzia, or in the graffiti-covered, punk-rock-pumping Franken Bar. Fans of music history need to stop by SO36, the past haunt of mega-stars David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Today, this celebrated queer event space hosts everything from roller discos, ballrooms and the monthly LGBTQ+ event Gayhane. During the day, second-hand seekers sift through antiques, furniture and garms in shops like Vintage Living and Kleiderei.\n\nEAT Go traditional at the neighbourhood’s German restaurant, Max und Moritz.\n\nDRINK This street is made for people-watching. Grab a beer from a späti corner store, sit outside, and watch local life go by.\n\nDO Wander in Nachbarschaftsgarten, the urban community garden at Moritzplatz.\n\nNo, not that Fifth Avenue. We’re talking about the ‘Other Fifth’, over in Park Slope, with the Barclays Center to its north and the Prospect Expressway to the south. This street has been has been quietly cool for a while, hiding behind its stroller army-mommy mafia and family-friendly reputation – but its regular community festivals, restaurants, shops and third spaces make it New York City’s coolest street in 2024. There are the stalwarts we love: indie shops like Brooklyn Superhero Supply Store, Galaxy Collectibles and Community Bookstore; bars and restaurants like Ginger's Bar and Good Judy. But relative newcomers like The Ripped Bodice bookstore, Honeycomb Hi-Fi Lounge, the Sip N Play board game cafe and Miatzil are keeping the stretch fresh and making it harder to keep this gem under the radar.\n\nEAT At Masalawala & Sons for actually good creative cocktails and wonderful Indian dishes including macher dim, keema kaleji and unforgettably comforting rice.\n\nDRINK We like the low-key, living room feel of Skylark with dozens of drafts on tap, or Blueprint for something a little more high-end with speakeasy vibes. Order the My Dear Julius.\n\nDO Go to the Old Stone House for history, play some games at Sip N Play (don’t skip the boba tea), and catch a Nets game at the Barclays Center – or head to nearby Union Hall for a comedy show, karaoke or trivia.\n\nFor Bangkok’s younger generation and dedicated foodies, craving for street-style fare is often succeeded by a trip to Ban Tad Thong. What was once a street hawking car and motorcyle parts has been transformed, over the past few years, into Bangkok’s most exciting new foodie destination. Both sides of the 1.3-kilometre stretch are now lined with more eating options than you could ever imagine, from long-standing khao tom joints and up-and-coming sweet spots to upscale mala hotpots – all ready to satisfy hungry visitors that come in their droves on a nightly basis. Nearby, you’ll find brand-new art space Slowcombo – and award-winning bar Find The Photobooth recently relocated to the area, too. In April, the street will host its first Songkran Water Festival.\n\nEAT Slurp spicy, Michelin Bib Gourmand-certified tom yum at Jeh O, savour stewed duck at Jeh Keang, and chow down on water mimosa salad and fried pork belly at Jeh Sri. Sweeten your palate with icy, soy milk-based sweets at Jeh Wan (but be prepared to wait in line).\n\nDRINK Find the Photobooth, the passion project of four bartenders from Asia’s best bars (Mahaniyom in Bangkok, Nutmeg and Clove in Singapore, Bar Mood in Taipei, and Bar High Five in Tokyo) has found a new home along Ban Tad Thong. Trying to find this hidden speakeasy is an adventure in itself.\n\nDO One side of public park Chulalongkorn Centenary Park runs along Ban Tad Thong. This green space offers locals the opportunity to reconnect with nature, and doubles as a wetland, absorbing rainwater to prevent flooding.\n\nA little over a decade ago, LA’s once-industrial Arts District began to cultivate small pockets of cool along 3rd Street. But in the past few years, these handful of blocks and their handsome brick warehouses have grown into one of LA’s most walkable and boastworthy stretches of street, trimmed with colorful murals, pink flowering trees and on-street patios (all about two blocks from Metro’s newest A and E Line station). Just past Downtown high-rises and a Little Tokyo temple, the Arts District’s slice of 3rd Street is the sort of place where you can have Michelin-starred sushi at 715 or bump and tilt your way to pinball stardom at EightyTwo, and where a gallery visit at Over the Influence is a natural prelude to a beer and a brat at Wurstküche or a Mexico City-inspired rooftop party at LA Cha Cha Chá.\n\nEAT Tucked inside the loading dock of an old steel company warehouse, Camphor will romance you with French bistro dishes that have occasional South Asian touches – and then leave you head over heels in love with its next-level kiwi dessert.\n\nDRINK Dark and in demand, LA’s petite outpost of the acclaimed Death & Co serves some of the finest cocktails in the entire city, with boozy creations broken up by flavor profiles like ‘light and playful’ and ‘boozy and honest’.\n\nDO With numerous sizable gallery spaces, a gift shop, an art book store and a patio restaurant that pulls eggs fresh from the chickens in its mural-adorned garden, there’s no other art gallery quite like Hauser & Wirth’s former flour mill complex.\n\nPraça Carlos Alberto is always lively, especially on Saturdays when the Porto Belo Market fills this square with vinyl records, illustrations, handmade toys, vintage clothing and antiques. But its surrounding backstreets are where you’ll find the real local buzz, and Rua Sá de Noronha in particular has become a must-visit passage in Porto. Walk from Aduela Bar at the top of the street (a local favourite for an after-work drink) to Reitoria Restaurant at the bottom (a wine bar and steakhouse set in a beautifully restored nineteenth-century building), and you’ll see why we’ve crowned Rua Sá de Noronha the city’s coolest street.\n\nEAT Casa Guedes’ famous pork sandwiches (there’s also francesinhas, alheira sandwiches and hot dogs). This is the brand's third address, located in the historic Café Progresso building.\n\nDRINK Portuguese wine, sangria or Moscatel (a sweet wine from the southern Setúbal region) at Aduela. If the terrace is full, do as the locals do: order a drink and sit on the street.\n\nDO Snoop around Poetria, which was born in 2003 with two great loves: poetry and theater. Its collection is dedicated to its own editions and the Portuguese poetry, as well as English literature, Brazilian poetry, and books from small publishers. You can even stick around for a presentation or debate.\n\nThese days Chinese influence on our culture can be seen, heard and tasted all over the capital. There are amazing restaurants showcasing hitherto-obscure regional cuisines in every corner of the tube map. But Chinatown, the one in Soho, is special, both in terms of its historical significance and also its present-day, social media-powered renaissance. A few years ago, following the pandemic, Londoners genuinely feared for its survival. Today, Gerrard Street (Chinatown’s main lantern-festooned drag) is maybe the most bustling, lively bit of London. TikTok has made social media stars of nearly every single food stall and eatery in the area. New restaurants have opened up, a few of which are competing with the likes of Four Seasons, Leong's Legend and Wong Kei for the coveted 'best place in Chinatown' crown. Meanwhile, Gen Z-friendly shops and boutiques have replaced the manky tat stores. Will all the people filming in the middle of the street get annoying at some point? Undoubtedly! But right now it's great to see such an important area rise once more.\n\nEAT There are a load of new restaurants on Gerrard Street, but the pick of the bunch (as far as our reviewer is concerned) is Real Beijing Food House. High-quality, (mostly) northern Chinese fare, with a charmingly throwback vibe to the Chinatown of my youth.\n\nDRINK It may have ridden a wave of unbelievable marketing hype, but the nearby Devonshire (aka ‘the Dev’) is a very decent addition to the Soho pub scene. Main man Oisin Rogers has turned this new boozer into a site of pilgrimage for anyone serious about Good Guinness.\n\nBUY Fifty years in, and Loon Fung is still one of London’s best, and most gloriously overwhelming, Asian supermarkets. Loads of fresh ingredients (including fish and meat), affordable cooking utensils as well as jars and jars of arcane condiments and sauces you’ll buy, use once and then leave in the fridge for two years.\n\nOvershadowed by neighbouring Malasaña, Conde Duque has flown under the radar until very recently – as has this street, which gives its name to the neighbourhood. Thanks to the buzz of activity around the Condeduque Cultural Center, a former military barracks converted into an exhibition hall, theatre, summer cinema (and much more), the area has now been given a fresh injection of life. It seems that the magnetism of this institution has attracted endless new stores, bars and restaurants, which have turned Conde Duque Street into one of the trendiest areas in the capital. Gourmet businesses like Cultivo (for artisan cheese) and Panic (for authentic sourdough bread) coexist alongside traditional stores like La Pomarada, which has the largest cachopo (a very meaty traditional dish) in Madrid.\n\nEAT Somewhere between cafe, juice bar and restaurant, Frutas Prohibidas serves up healthy breakfast, brunch, lunch and snacks. Carnivore? Head to El Toril for a nice and messy smash burger.\n\nDRINK With exposed brick walls, natural wines and a cosy atmosphere, Siniestro is that small neighbourhood specialty cafe where you can go for everything from breakfast with homemade pastries to a vermouth after work.\n\nBUY Modern and stylish menswear from Sportivo, where you’ll find cult international brands such as the British Still by Hand or the Parisian Lemaire, alongside up-and-coming designers.\n\nThis avenue has all the bohemian charm of Colonia Juárez while being that little bit closer to Mexico City’s historic centre. It’s crammed with architectural highlights like Plaza del Reloj Chino and the Mascota building, and it’s moments away from Arena Mexico and Plaza del Danzon (where you can watch dressed-up locals dance from noon ’til night). But it’s Bucareli’s diverse dining scene that has made the street such an epicentre: our favourites include specialty cafe Tirasavia, Italian trattoria Suppli and steakhouse La Sirloneria. The bartending tradition lives on at Cervecería Vizcaya and El Club de Bucareli, and Galería Karen Huber is the place to go for contemporary art. Close the day with a coffee in the nostalgia of Café La Habana, which retains its ’50s decor.\n\nEAT A classic Mexican breakfast for under MX$200 at Fonda Margarita.\n\nDRINK A glass of French or Italian wine at the gallery and speakeasy Cinco Pies, inside Tirasavia.\n\nDO Catch a secret play or concert at the beautiful Centro Tudor, around the corner from Bucareli on Artículo 123.\n\nRue de Belleville is the main artery running through the former village of Belleville. Once home to a funicular tramway, the street climbs up to the highest point of the tallest hill in Paris (hence the name ‘Belle Vue’, meaning beautiful view). And the street isn’t short of beauty: at the intersection with Rue des Pyrénées, the Eiffel Tower appears as if by magic. Rue de Belleville is so popular with Parisians because it brings together some of the best bars in the capital, and at the centre of Belleville Chinatown, there’s plenty of delicious stuff to eat, too. Arrive before sunset and be prepared to spend the night.\n\nDRINK Combat is a must for cocktails – start there and go for your second round (and an assortment of mezzes) at Kissproof. Natural wine fans should moor at La Cale.\n\nEAT If you’re craving street food, head to Mian Guan; but if you really want to treat yourself, there’s no better place for it than the Michelin restaurant Cheval d'Or.\n\nDO Chill out in Belleville Park to admire the view before belting out some bops at a legendary karaoke spot in Chinatown.\n\nDespite challenges with gentrification in recent times, Pilsen remains one of the main hubs for Chicago’s Mexican American community. The South Side neighbourhood’s busiest thoroughfare is 18th Street, a corridor lined with businesses, art galleries and much more. Spend an afternoon browsing the shelves at Pilsen Community Books, sipping on cocktails at The Alderman and checking out gorgeous murals by local artists. And when dinner time rolls around, you’ll be spoiled for choice: 18th Street's collection of restaurants is second to none, with everything from acclaimed favourites to mom-and-pop institutions.\n\nEAT Golden hunks of carnitas, which are made with every part of the pig and served by the pound. They’re accompanied by tortillas, salsas, onions and cilantro so you can build your own tacos. Two local standouts have been doing it for decades: Carnitas Uruapan and Don Pedro Carnitas.\n\nDRINK A punch bowl with friends at Punch House. The subterranean bar feels like a basement straight out of the ‘70s, with a menu that features both contemporary concoctions and classics, such as the Milk Punch #2 (funky rum, coconut, lemon, chai tea).\n\nDO See a show at Thalia Hall. Built in 1892, the historic landmark reopened as a music venue in 2014, hosting acts from all genres.\n\nJust ten minutes’ stroll from the city’s tourist-packed centre, Camden Street and its surrounding area feels like that rare thing: a sprawling neighbourhood that’s retained a no-frills, post-modern grit, despite becoming a hotspot for creative spaces. Mentioned in Ulysses, and around the corner from the ancestral home of George Bernard Shaw, Camden Street is characterised by unpretentious pubs, political street art and a buzzy dining scene. It’s full of surprises, from Ireland’s best Taco Truck Los Chicanos to the secret Cake Café, accessible only by way of high-ceilinged, secondhand book seller The Last Bookshop.\n\nEAT Sourdough cinnamon buns from Meet Me In The Morning, small plates at Mister S (be sure to book ahead), the best cheeseburger and shoestring fries from Bunsen, and a thali from Dublin’s best Indian, Pickle.\n\nDRINK Guinness (let it settle, first) in the Bleeding Horse, sundowners in Frank’s and cocktails in Delahunt. Bonus points if you manage to swing into Devitt’s for whiskey, too.\n\nDO Some morning stretches at Yogahub, go to a comedy night at Anseo, see live music in Cassidy’s and round it all off with a DJ set at Hang Dai.\n\nFor a little street, Foster Street packs big punch. Along with neighbouring Campbell Street, it’s part of the inner city precinct known as the Hollywood Quarter. Speaking of Hollywood, the area recently attracted pop superstar Taylor Swift. The singer dined at Foster Street’s Pellegrino 2000, our favourite Italian restaurant, where you can order delicious silky pasta that she would have learnt is worth risking the paparazzi for. Despite the dazzling name, the quarter brings low-key cool vibes, and is bordered by Central, Thai Town, and cool suburbs Surry Hills and Darlinghurst.\n\nEAT At the aforementioned Pellegrino 2000. Or, for a cheap weekday lunch, join the queue at Malibu (for a sandwich as big as your head).\n\nDRINK At the Hollywood Hotel. Although we have some other favourite drinking spots in the area (The Rover, Tio’s), this charming Art Deco pub-slash-small bar is a true Sydney institution (and the Hollywood Quarter’s namesake).\n\nDO Several floors above the street in a cavernous, warehouse-style space is China Heights, a gallery showing a rotating collection of works from extremely cool young Sydney artists. Or head around the corner to the Golden Age Cinema & Bar to catch an indie flick.\n\nWhile most tourists flock to Myeongdong and Hongdae, locals in Seoul head elsewhere for good food and drinks. Welcome to Songridan-gil. This street in Jamsil – not too far from Lotte Mall, Jamsil Tower and Lotte World – is buzzing with activity on the weekends, especially in the evenings. With a megamall and amusement park within reach, the street retains Seoul’s big-city vibe while also having the industrial aesthetic typical of Seoul’s older neighbourhoods. It’s known for its many top-notch restaurants and bars, many of which come with unbeatable views of Seokcheon Lake.\n\nEAT You won't go wrong with Oreno Ramen Songpa – the chicken broth used for the ramen is rich, velvety smooth, and deeply flavourful without being cloying. Otherwise, head to Jeunson Grilled Jeju Black Pork for thick, succulent cuts of the namesake meat.\n\nDRINK Get a taste of traditional Korean alcohol at Songridan Brewery, where you'll be able to sip on some Makgeolli (Korean rice wine) alongside a whole bunch of local side dishes to pair it with. Misaeng Sijang is a watering hole reminiscent of a no-frills Korean bar, and is the perfect place to hang out with friends.\n\nDO Korea is obsessed with self-timed photo booths, and you'll find almost one on every corner along Songridan-gil. Each one offers different designs, filters and props – you have to try them all at least once.\n\nRunning along the eastern shore of Tay Ho, Quang An Street is the vibrant, cosmoplitan heart of Hanoi. New businesses have been steadily cropping up along the 1km stretch in recent years, transforming the lakeside road into a hub of cosy cafes, boutique shopping and global cuisine. It’s just 5km north of Hanoi’s bustling Old Quarter – and while all those restaurants and a popular nighttime flower market keeps Quang An lively, the waterfront location lends the street a peaceful vibe. We can’t think of a better place for a stroll.\n\nEAT Flavourful and authentic Spanish tapas in the delightfully ambient Olé, paired with handcrafted cocktails and wine.\n\nDRINK Ceremonial-grade matcha imported directly from Japan at NAGOCHA. Choose from the traditional latte or opt for a more creative spin on the powdered green tea.\n\nBUY Handcrafted souvenirs from around the globe at Better World, where partial proceeds are donated to local charities.\n\nOur pick for one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods in 2023, Coral Gables’ downtown is anchored by Miracle Mile, a palm and oak tree-lined street where you’ll find plenty of independent shops and some of Miami’s best restaurants (including several that recently earned nods from the Michelin Guide). Like the rest of its historic neighbourhood, Miracle Mile and its surrounding promenades boast beautifully maintained Mediterranean Revival-style architecture with stucco facades and arched doorways. There are lively events year round; don’t miss the two-day Carnaval on the Mile festival every March.\n\nEAT The Coral Gables outpost of one of our favourite restaurants in Miami resides under telltale yellow and white striped awnings along Miracle Mile. A bright and airy Mediterranean-inspired space, Motek serves up everything from crispy falafel and juicy schnitzel to fresh salad and creamy house-made hummus. Order the Arayes, a brilliant Middle Eastern take on a burger stuffed in a pita and baked into a neat and flavourful meat package.\n\nDRINK Stop in for happy hour (daily 3-6pm) at Vinya Table, a chic neighbourhood wine bar and market where you can sip somm-curated glasses of wine starting at $8 and excellent cocktails like the Whitecap Negroni starting at $9. Before you leave, peruse the market shelves in the back for a few to-go bottles.\n\nDO See a show at the historic Miracle Theatre. Built in 1948, it’s now the home of Miami’s critically-acclaimed Actors’ Playhouse.\n\nStroll between the landmarks of Art Mûr, a three-storey art gallery, and the brunch spot Le Toaster, and you’ll hit on a Villeray section of Saint-Hubert Street that’s totally unique in the city. A Latin enclave and hipster hotspot, Saint-Hubert Plaza is partly covered with a glass roof, making it ripe for exploring whatever the season. There’s everything from top-tier Mexican street food, tiki bars and prom dress shops to bookstores, thrift stores and made-in-Montréal streetwear stops like Pony. For something a little fancy, Montréal Plaza by Toqué! alums doles out small plates and fine wines in a fantastically decorated space, but most of Saint-Hubert Plaza’s vibe is deliciously relaxed.\n\nEAT The gorditas, burritos and tortas de chilaquiles at Place Juárez draw crowds out the door. There’s also pizza and Jersey-style casino clams at Marci, spag bol with a side of Texas Ranch Water at Spaghetti Western and pillowy dumplings at La Maison de Mademoiselle Dumplings.\n\nDRINK Anything tropical at the black-lit Snowbird Tiki Bar – whether it’s the house Mai Tai or the sharing Scorpion Bowl – will take you to a very special place.\n\nDO Go bowling and beering with friends at Quilles G Plus, just off the strip, before catching a show at Ausgang Plaza.\n\nAttracting a bohemian, community-minded mix of artists, designers, musicians and digital nomads, Petralona has become one of Athens’ most desirable residential neighbourhoods over the past decade. Increasingly at the heart of it all is Troon, which runs from Thissio and the observatory on Filopappos Hill down to the very gentle hubbub of the southerly Merkouri Square. The beautiful, rolling hill is punctuated by classic villas, retro apartment blocks and a new wave of architectural residential buildings, with friendly locals lolling between relaxed classic tavernas and easy-going bars. But beyond those Athenian staples, the street seems to perfectly capture the current shift in the Greek capital’s energies – fusing the city’s scruffy, old-world charm with interesting contemporary art developments and modern fine dining.\n\nEAT At eccentric and eclectic Aster, whose unusual menu for Greece blends classic Cretan cooking with modern tapas, or enjoy the retro vibes of Rantevou, a genuine cafeneio (traditional Greek all-day café) serving good value small plates in the evening.\n\nDRINK Paribaba and Botella both buzz with the coffee/brunch crowd by day and cocktail lovers by night.\n\nDO Pick up quirky zines and indie magazines at bookshop-cafe Adad’s or settle in for an alfresco movie at one of Athens’ beloved outdoor cinemas, Zéphyros.\n\nDon’t write off Cecil Street as somewhere only the corporate office crowd lurks. Despite its location in Singapore’s central business district, there’s surprisingly a fair bit of fun packed within this oft-overlooked stretch in the Raffles Place area. Beyond a seemingly steely appearance lies a handful of cool bars, cosy cafés, and trendy fitness studios, making it a great place for those who want to eat well, drink well, and live well.\n\nDO Have a swing at Five Iron Golf, an indoor virtual golf simulation centre. Go on a journey across the world’s most gorgeous courses, or try fun beginner-level golfing games to hone your putting skills. With Tex-Mex grub and opening hours till as late as midnight on most days, it’s the perfect spot for an after-work hangout.\n\nEAT Hapi Café isn’t just a healthy eatery – it also doubles up as a co-working space, with VR gaming sets to boot. For your coffee fix, make a beeline for 22 Grams Café or 6oz Espresso Bar, whose brews will jolt you right awake.\n\nDRINK The relatively new Wine Meadow, a fully alfresco bar by Rosemead, is a foolproof pick for a casual date over vino and tapas. Tommy’s Sake Bar has an extensive Japanese sake menu, with reasonably-priced sashimi sets to go with. Finally, there’s rum haven Sugarhall – try their bubble tea-inspired cocktails.\n\nRunning along rows of commercial establishments and upscale residential apartments, the laidback L.P Leviste Street doesn’t scream cool at first glance. But there’s a reason why this street is one of Manila’s most coveted addresses and constantly draws both the city’s well-heeled and hipster set. You’ll find coffee shops, thrift stores and a host of independent food and drink joints hidden inside nondescript buildings if you know where to look. You also can’t miss the well-loved Salcedo Community Market, which happens every weekend, for a taste of local produce and freshly prepared Filipino favourites. It’s recently moved to a parking lot at Paseo Center, just a stone’s throw away from L.P Leviste.\n\nDO Stop by Jaime Velasquez Park, former home of the famous Salcedo Community Market. Every year, an open-air art festival called Art in the Park takes over this verdant square.\n\nEAT Manila’s fashion insiders are known to gather at all-day bistro, Elbert’s Collective, which serves brick oven pizza, hearty sandwiches, and creative cocktails. Then there’s Golden Gibbon, a cool ‘hidden jungle’ with a fresh take on Southeast Asian food.\n\nDRINK Hit Sampiro for great cocktails before heading down to Spritz for a fine selection of premium spirits. On the weekend, put on your dancing shoes for DJ nights at Pablo Bistro, a Spanish joint that knows how to throw a good fiesta."
