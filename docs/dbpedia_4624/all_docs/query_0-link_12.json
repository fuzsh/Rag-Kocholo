        "text": "The clean energy transition may offer one of the largest, multi-decade secular growth opportunities. The $100+ trillion of investment needed to reach net zero emissions¹, government policy support for climate action and declining clean technology costs have created a compelling investment environment.\n\nUnlike most clean energy indices, GCLN’s index uses asset-level data and corporate business mix expectations to invest in a larger, multi-sector set of highly exposed “clean energy enablers2” - companies that are progressing the energy transition - seeking lower concentration and volatility."
