        "text": "In Annex I Prevention of pollution by oil, Annex II Control of pollution by noxious liquid substances, Annex IV Prevention of pollution by sewage from ships and Annex V Prevention of pollution by garbage from ships, MARPOL defines certain sea areas as \"special areas\" in which, for technical reasons relating to their oceanographical and ecological condition and to their sea traffic, the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution is required. Under the Convention, these special areas are provided with a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea.\n\nAnnex VI Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships establishes certain sulphur oxide (SOx) Emission Control Areas with more stringent controls on sulphur emissions and nitrogen oxides (NOx) Emission Control Areas for Tier III NOx emission standards.\n\nSpecial areas under MARPOL are as follows:\n\nAdoption, entry into force & date of taking effect of Special Areas Special Areas Adopted # Date of Entry into Force In Effect From\n\nAnnex I: Oil\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\nBaltic Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\nBlack Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\nRed Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\n\"Gulfs\" area\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n2 Oct 1983\n\n1 Aug 2008\n\nGulf of Aden\n\n1 Dec 1987\n\n1 Apr 1989\n\nAntarctic area\n\n16 Nov 1990\n\n17 Mar 1992\n\n17 Mar 1992\n\nNorth West European Waters\n\n25 Sept 1997\n\n1 Feb 1999\n\n1 Aug 1999\n\nOman area of the Arabian Sea\n\n15 Oct 2004\n\n1 Jan 2007\n\nSouthern South African waters\n\n13 Oct 2006\n\n1 Mar 2008\n\n1 Aug 2008\n\nAnnex II: Noxious Liquid Substances\n\nAntarctic area\n\n30 Oct 1992\n\n1 Jul 1994\n\n1 Jul 1994\n\nAnnex IV: Sewage\n\nBaltic Sea\n\n15 Jul 2011\n\n1 Jan 2013\n\n**\n\nAnnex V: Garbage\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n31 Dec 1988\n\n1 May 2009\n\nBaltic Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n31 Dec 1988\n\n1 Oct 1989\n\nBlack Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n31 Dec 1988\n\nRed Sea\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n31 Dec 1988\n\n\"Gulfs\" area\n\n2 Nov 1973\n\n31 Dec 1988\n\n1 Aug 2008\n\nNorth Sea\n\n17 Oct 1989\n\n18 Feb 1991\n\n18 Feb 1991\n\nAntarctic area (south of latitude 60 degrees south)\n\n16 Nov 1990\n\n17 Mar 1992\n\n17 Mar 1992\n\nWider Caribbean region including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea\n\n4 Jul 1991\n\n4 Apr 1993\n\n1 May 2011\n\nAnnex VI: Prevention of air pollution by ships (Emission Control Areas)\n\nBaltic Sea (SOx )\n\n(NOx)\n\n26 Sept 1997\n\n7 July 2017\n\n19 May 2005\n\n1 Jan 2019\n\n19 May 2006\n\n1 Jan 2021****\n\nNorth Sea (SOx)\n\n(NOx)\n\n22 Jul 2005\n\n7 July 2017\n\n22 Nov 2006\n\n1 Jan 2019\n\n22 Nov 2007\n\n1 Jan 2021****\n\nNorth American ECA\n\n(SOx and PM)\n\n(NOx)\n\n26 Mar 2010\n\n1 Aug 2011\n\n1 Aug 2012\n\n1 Jan 2016***\n\nUnited States\n\nCaribbean Sea ECA\n\n(SOx and PM)\n\n(NOx)\n\n26 Jul 2011\n\n1 Jan 2013\n\n1 Jan 2014\n\n1 Jan 2016***\n\n# Status of multilateral conventions and instruments in respect of which the International Maritime Organization or its Secretary-General perform depositary or other functions as at 31 December 2002.\n\n* The Special Area requirements for these areas have not yet taken effect because of lack of notifications from MARPOL Parties whose coastlines border the relevant special areas on the existence of adequate reception facilities (regulations 38.6 of MARPOL Annex I and 5(4) of MARPOL Annex V).\n\n** The new special area requirements, which entered into force on 1 January 2013, will only take effect upon receipt of sufficient notifications on the existence of adequate reception facilities from Parties to MARPOL Annex IV whose coastlines border the relevant special area (regulation 13.2 of the revised MARPOL Annex IV, which was adopted by resolution MEPC.200(62) and which entered into force on 1 January 2013).\n\n*** A ship constructed on or after 1 January 2016 and is operating in these emission control areas shall comply with NOx Tier III standards set forth in regulation 13.5 of MARPOL Annex VI.\n\n**** A ship constructed on or after 1 January 2021 and is operating in these emission control areas shall comply with NOX Tier III standards set forth in regulation 13.5 of MARPOL Annex VI."
