This year, we’ve made things easier by using PTA funds to cater quarterly lunches, so our educators can enjoy a great meal without any hassle. We’re also enhancing key events, like back-to-school gatherings and the Halloween parade, with DoorDash coffee and other refreshments. Our aim is to celebrate our hardworking staff and ensure that every parent and member of our community feels valued throughout the year.\n\nhospitality manager needed\n\nWe’re seeking a volunteer to coordinate these events. It’s a wonderful opportunity to support our educators and enhance community spirit. If you’re organized and enthusiastic, we’d love to hear from you!"
