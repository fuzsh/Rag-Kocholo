        "text": "Live: JO QUAIL\n\nMi, 22.11.2023\n\nDoors open 19:00\n\nUnboundaried contemporary instrumental music composed and performed by UK cellist Jo Quail.\n\nJo Quail is an internationally acclaimed composer and virtuoso cellist from London, UK. Equally at home on stage solo, with bands, or in collaboration with choir and orchestra, she combines an eloquent mastery of her instrument with innovative looping techniques, to realise her complex, evocative music for audiences worldwide.\n\nInspired by the visual arts as much as by fellow composers, Jo cites Barbara Hepworth and Georgia O’Keefe as key influences, alongside the diverse music of Debussy, Pärt, Tool, and Trent Reznor. As a result, she freely crosses the boundaries between genres, awakening listener emotions, and taking audiences into uncharted territory with each concert. Her exuberant, celebratory performance style has won her a fanbase in the contemporary classical world as well as among enthusiasts of progressive music, post-rock, metal and electronica.\n\nSince starting to play solo in 2010, Jo has released four albums, three EPs and a live DVD. Her most recent album ‘Exsolve’ was recorded with Chris Fielding at Skyhammer Studio, released in November 2018.\n\nAlongside her own work, Jo is in high demand as a guest artist and musical partner. Some recent collaborations:\n\n‘Rosebud’ (RareNoise Records), with Eraldo Bernocchi and FM Einheit (Einstürzende Neubauten);\n\n‘Revolve’ (One Little Indian) by Poppy Ackroyd;\n\nPeformances with Cappella Gedanensis, Poland, presenting Jo’s choral/orchestral arrangements of her own compositions.\n\nOther live work includes appearances at many rock and alternative festivals, such as Dunk! (BE), WGT (DE), Latitude (GB), with additional performances in Japan, South Africa and New Zealand. She has completed several solo tours across Europe and Australia, and toured supporting artists including Caspian, MONO, Myrkur, Amenra, and Boris among others.\n\nJo began her music studies at an early age, benefitting from the outstanding teaching she received at the Centre for Young Musicians in London. In turn, this has inspired her to educate and empower upcoming artists at every opportunity. In both the UK and Australia, Jo runs masterclasses and interactive workshops on composition, performance, and looping/effects modelling. She has written several pieces specifically intended for a wide combination of instruments, and mixed ability among the players, and performed them with a range of ensembles at home and abroad.\n\nVVK 25€ (ab 25.08.)\n\nViper Room Vienna (zu Event-Öffnungszeiten)\n\nWiener LP Cafe (https://www.lp-cafe.wien/)\n\nTicketmaster (zuzügl.
