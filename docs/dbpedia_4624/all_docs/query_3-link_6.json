Just type your search term and click on the Search button to the right of the search box. ClinVar can be searched with terms like:\n\ngene symbols, e.g. PTEN\n\ngene symbol and c. or p., e.g., mutyh c.1187g>a\n\nlocation / chromosome coordinates, e.g., chr1:11,102,837-11,267,747, 2:144,213,941 - 144,690,824, etc.\n\nHGVS expressions, e.g. NM_000314.4:c.395G>T\n\nprotein changes, e.g. G132V\n\nrs numbers, e.g. rs180177042\n\ndiseases, e.g. cystic fibrosis\n\nsubmitters, e.g. Invitae\n\na ClinVar accession number (VCV, RCV, or SCV)\n\nsearching for a VCV or an RCV accession results in the current version of that record. You can search for a previous version of the record searching by the accession.version. Searching for an SCV accession number, with or without the version, returns the VCV record that includes that SCV.\n\nMore complex queries\n\nClinVar uses the same type of query interface you may be familiar with if you use PubMed or other databases at NCBI. In other words, when you enter a term or phrase of interest in the query box, that term or phrase will be processed to retrieve records that contain or have some relationship to the word(s) you entered. The information is also organized into information categories or fields, so that queries can be constructed that retrieve records only if the term of interest occurs in that field. If you know the name of the field, you can enter that field name yourself. Otherwise you can use the Advanced page to help you build your query.\n\nQuery strategies\n\nPurpose\n\nExamples\n\n(try the link)\n\nComments Find records for a gene BRCA1[gene]\n\nIf you enter the gene symbol, your results include variations that affect that gene.\n\nA lollipop diagram also shows where variants are within the gene.\n\nGenes are shown in the orientation they are on the chromosome.\n\nA useful strategy to focus a search is to hover over an exon in the Gene track and follow the Exon link in the tooltip.\n\nAfter zooming in, click \"Update search results to this region\" to synchronize the search results with the lollipop diagram.\n\nHovering over a dot on the lollipop diagram reveals a tooltip with information about the variant. If there is a cluster of variants, a link to zoom to variants in that region is provided.\n\nFind records by chromosome location\n\nchr2:136937000-146682000\n\nGRCh38:2:136937000-146682000\n\n17[chr] AND 43000000:44000000[chrpos37]\n\nIf you enter a chromosome location, your results include variations within and overlapping that region.\n\nA genome view also shows a graphical representation of the variants.\n\nWhen the assembly isn’t specified, like chr2:136937000-146682000, the results are for GRCh37 by default. When the assembly is included, like GRCh38:2:136937000-146682000, the results are on the specified assembly.\n\nGenes are shown in the orientation they are on the genome.\n\nEach variation > 1kb is displayed as a blue bar (copy number gain) or red bar (copy number loss).\n\nEach variation < 1kb is displayed in the Small variant track at the top of the display.\n\nZooming in goes no closer than 1 kb. After zooming in, click \"Update search results to this region\" to synchronize the search results with the genome view.\n\nHovering over a blue bar, a red bar, or elements on the Small variant map reveals a tooltip with information about the variant.\n\n17[chr] AND 43000000:44000000[chrpos37]: The [chrpos], [chrpos37], and [chrpos38] fields support queries by range where the range separator is a colon (:). Don't forget to provide the value for chromosome as well.\n\nFind records for a disease or phenotype \"breast cancer\"[dis]\n\nIf you enter the name of the disease or phenotype followed by [dis], your results include variations reported for that disease/phenotype.\n\nIf you do not include [dis], your results include records where the disease/phenotype is anywhere in the record, not necessarily reported for that variant.\n\n* is used as the wild card. It can be used only at the end of a word.\n\nAdvanced Search\n\nAdvanced search is useful when you want to construct a query that combines several concepts and/or restricts values to specific fields.\n\nClick on Advanced in the gray query bar.\n\nBrowse for terms that may be anywhere in the database (All Fields) or in a particular field (selected from the menu of field names).\n\nCombine your search term with others using AND , OR or NOT in the menu to the left of the next query term.\n\nWe provide more details on using Advanced Search.\n\nClinVar's Field Name Abbreviation Scope and explanation Allele ID [alleleid] The ClinVar identifier for an individual change. e.g. for a haplotype of five SNPs, each individual SNP has its own Allele ID. Base position\n\n[chrpos] [cpos]\n\n[cposition]\n\n[chrpos38]\n\nThe chromosome base position, based on the current reference assembly (GRCh38).

Cytogenetic band\n\n[cytgen]\n\nThe cytogenetic location for a variant. Disease/Phenotype [dis] Disease or trait associated with a variant. External allele ID Identifiers for alleles/variants from sources other than ClinVar, such as OMIM allelic variant ID, IDs from LSDBs, rs#, or dbVar identifiers. Filter\n\n[sb]\n\n[filter]\n\nThese filters represent the infrastructure to link between ClinVar and other Entrez databases.\n\nFilters based on links to other records:\n\nclinvar_all[Filter]\n\nclinvar_dbvar[Filter]\n\nclinvar_gene[Filter]\n\nclinvar_medgen[Filter]\n\nclinvar_omim[Filter]\n\nclinvar_pmc[Filter]\n\nclinvar_pubmed[Filter] (based on citations provided in ClinVar records)\n\nclinvar_pubmed_calculated[Filter] (calculated based on matching gene and text of a variant description)\n\nclinvar_snp[Filter]\n\nThis filter finds all records and can be used in combination with other filters to exclude records:\n\nall[Filter]\n\nGene Full Name [gene_full_name] Full name for a gene of interest. Gene ID [geneid] GeneID for a gene of interest. Gene Name [gene] Symbol for a gene of interest. HGNC identifier for human gene [hgnc] HGNC identifier for a gene of interest. Last interpreted [clinsig_last_eval] The date that a variant was last interpreted by a submitter. In other words, the date is for each submission or SCV, not the aggregate record. Length of the variant [varlen] The length of the variant. For insertions and duplications, this is the length of the inserted or duplicated sequence. MIM [mim] MIM number from OMIM. Modification Date\n\n[moddate]\n\n[mdat]\n\nLast date the VCV record was modified. Molecular consequence [molcons] Calculated result of the indicated allele based on difference relative to reference. Name of the ClinVar record [titl] The ClinVar record name\n\ne.g for an SNV\n\nNM_000314.8(PTEN):c.1034T>C (p.Leu345Pro)\n\ne.g for a CNV\n\nGRCh37/hg19 10p15.3-q26.3(chr10:100027-135427143)x3\n\nOrganism [orgn] Scientific and common names of organism. All ClinVar records are for human variants and conditions. Origin [origin] The origin of the variant allele. De novovariants are represented asde novo, not by the maternal/paternal origin of the chromosome with thede novovariant. Properties [prop] Terms in the property field are standards used to categorize records in ClinVar. Properties include values for classification (options starting with \"clinsig\"), mode of inheritance, and others. The full list of properties, and their definitions, are provided in this document. PubMed ID [pmid] PubMed IDs linked to the record. Review status [revstat] Review status of the record. Study Name [studyname] The name of the study in which the variant was classified, such as CSER. Submitter Batch [subid] The name of a batch of submissions from a submitter. This corresponds to \"Submission name\" registered by the submitter in the ClinVar Submission Portal. Taxonomy ID\n\n[taxid]\n\n[tid]\n\nIdentifier for the species in the NCBI Taxonomy database. All ClinVar records are for human variants and disorders/phenotypes. Text Word [text] Any word in a ClinVar record. Trait identifier [traitid]\n\nDisease or phenotype identifiers, such as CUI or HPO.\n\nExamples:\n\nHP:0000006 \"HP 0000077\"[Trait identifier]\n\nORPHA100 ORPHA100[Trait identifier]\n\nOMIM 219700 219700[Trait identifier]\n\nCUI C0004135 C0004135[Trait identifier]\n\nMeSH D00052 D000052[Trait identifier]\n\nType of variation [vartype] Type of variation represented in the record. Variant name [varnam] Name of the variant. Variation ID [uid] The ClinVar identifier for the variant or set of variants that were classified. e.g. for a haplotype of five SNPs, the set of five SNPs has a single Variation ID (or unique identifier - UID).\n\nWhen you search ClinVar, you are searching for variants, specifically the aggregate variant record (VCV), not for individual submissions (SCVs). For example:\n\n“Creation date” is the date that the VCV record was first created, not the date that an individual submission (SCV) was created.\n\na search for 'genedx[Submitter] AND \"clinsig pathogenic\"[Properties]' results in VCV records classified as \"pathogenic\" that include an SCV from GeneDx but not necessarily an SCV that GeneDx classified as \"pathogenic\".\n\nThe only exception is when an RCV record is used as the query; the RCV record is returned.\n\nReviewing the result set\n\nSearch results are displayed as a table. You can re-sort the table by gene or genomic location with the \"Sort by...\" menu at the top.\n\nSearches for gene symbols and genomic locations also show the results as a graphical display.\n\nYou download the search results as a file using the Download option at the top right. The download includes several more columns of data than the web display.\n\nUsing filters to refine the results\n\nYou can refine your search results further using the filters to the left of the results.\n\nClinVar's Filter Name How to use the filter Clinical significance The germline classification (formerly called clinical significance) of the VCV record. Note that this may differ from a classification reported by a submitter (SCV).\n\nIf you filter on “Pathogenic”, the results include all VCV records with an aggregate classification of “Pathogenic”, “Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic”, “Pathogenic, low penetrance”, or “Established risk allele”.\n\nIf you filter on “Likely pathogenic”, the results include all VCV records with an aggregate classification of “Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic, “Likely pathogenic”, “Likely pathogenic, low penetrance”, or “Likely risk allele”.\n\nIf you filter on “Uncertain significance”, the results include all VCV records with an aggregate classification of “Uncertain significance” or “Uncertain risk allele”.\n\nIf you filter on “Likely benign”, the results include all VCV records with an aggregate classification of “Benign/Likely benign” or “Likely benign”.\n\nIf you filter on “Benign”, the results include all VCV records with an aggregate classification of “Benign” or “Benign/Likely benign”.\n\nTypes of conflicts The type of conflicting classifications for a VCV record. Based on the classification terms defined above, conflicts are reported between:\n\nPathogenic and/or Likely Pathogenic vs Likely Benign and/or Benign (P/LP vs LB/B)\n\nPathogenic and/or Likely Pathogenic vs Uncertain significance (P/LP vs VUS)\n\nUncertain significance vs Likely benign and/or benign (VUS vs LB/B)\n\nIf there are no conflicting germline classifications for the variation, this filter is not provided. Molecular consequence The molecular consequence of the variation, calculated by NCBI. Variation type The type of variation. Variant length The length of the variant sequence. This filter is useful to distinguish between smaller sequence variants and larger structural variants. Review status The review status of the germline classification for the variant. You can limit results to variants where at least one submitter provided assertion criteria with the filter \"at least one star\".\n\nIf you select multiple options within a filter, the results will include records with any of the selected options within that filter. As you make multiple selections within a category, the numbers displayed next to each filter value will change to reflect what is now present in your result set.\n\nIf you make selections for more than one filter, the results will include records that match the combination of filters selected.\n\nFor example:\n\nif you select\n\nPathogenic under Clinical significance\n\nCopy number gain under Variation type\n\nthe query results include VCV records that are copy number gain and were reported as pathogenic.\n\nif you select\n\nLikely pathogenic under Clinical signficance\n\nPathogenic under Clinical significance\n\nthe query results include VCV records that were reported as either Pathogenic or Likely pathogenic.\n\nIn Boolean terms:\n\nwithin a filter category, multiple selections are processed as the Boolean OR\n\nbetween categories, they are processed as the Boolean AND\n\nThe first query above is processed as (\"clinsig pathogenic\"[Properties] AND \"copy number gain\"[Type of variation]).\n\nThe second query above is processed as (\"clinsig likely pathogenic\"[Properties] OR \"clinsig pathogenic\"[Properties]).\n\nYou can also use the Advanced search function to construct complex queries like these.\n\nUnderstanding the ClinVar web display\n\nThe primary web display in ClinVar is a variation-centric page that aggregates information submitted for a variation for all of the reported conditions (the accession starting with VCV), along with details for each submission about the variation (the accession starting with SCV). Read more detailed information on the ClinVar variation display.\n\nIn addition, there is a ClinVar page that is specific to the combination of variation and disease, represented by the summary accession in ClinVar (the accession starting with RCV). This page also includes details for each submission about the variation and disease (the accession starting with SCV). Read more detailed information about the ClinVar record display.\n\nData standards\n\nClinVar uses established standards for data types such as variation description, variation type, diseases, genes, proteins, and classification. You can find more information in our documentation for HGVS usage, nomenclature, and authorities.\n\nBuilding URLs"
