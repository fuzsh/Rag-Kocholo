Fingers crossed he checks his mail before work, so he can mail me a photo before we all explode with frustration!\n\nI just call randomly to australia and ask someone to go to the manning bar to take pictures and the guy who answered doesnt sound very happy he said:\n\nare you fkin mad is 5 of the morning\n\nI failed but i tried\n\nHoly fuck! I'm so excited!!!!! I wonder if it's like a real-non online game, where people have to go out and search for things, and maybe, like people already said it involves a few countries around the world...if so- best shit ever!\n\nI think once the hunt is coming to a close, fans will see Chester.\n\nAnd Chester will tell them that they've tried so hard and got so far. But in the end, it didn't even matter.\n\nBOOM.\n\nF'ing genius. Lol, you killed him\n\njust throwing it in for logistical purposes (derek or someone write these kinds of info down): if there is anything about the hunt in COLOGNE, GERMANY, contact me. I will check it then.\n\nWhen you get to the place, a cd will be found. When you play it you'll hear Empty Spaces and you will know that the trolling has begun.\n\nOn a more serious note, I think this is a very cool initiative from LP. They said we wouldn't be ready for this and I'm gonna agree in some way, I did not see this coming at all. They really want us to work together, which is really great. Kudos to LP!\n\nFor anyone who wants : http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Manni...ar=Sydney+New+South+Wales,+Australia&t=m&z=18\n\nI've emailed my brother in law who lives near by.\n\nI will be around for anything in the UK Manchester area too. Good luck all."
