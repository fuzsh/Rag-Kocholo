        "text": "Each new member is required to be a consistent, registered member of an LPBC team or training group for their first year of membership. A new member who wishes to row on their own at the LPBH outside of their team’s practices can get approval and assigned an appropriate boat through the Head Coach or Assistant Coach.\n\nAll Associates and guests must know how to swim; expected proficiency is the ability to swim 100 meters in light clothing, and to tread water for at least ten minutes.\n\nThe Lincoln Park and Park 571 boathouses and aprons are Chicago Park District property. The Chicago Park District prohibits the following from the Park 571 and Lincoln Park boathouses: Alcohol, Tobacco, Dogs or other pets. Pets and Tobacco are not allowed at the Lathrop boathouse.\n\nBikes, scooters, and skateboards are not allowed inside any LPBC boathouse or boat storage area.\n\nAssociates and guests may use a locker for their belongings for each visit to the club. If you wish to rent a locker for overnight or permanent storage, please visit our Regatta Central page to register for one.\n\nKeep the facilities clean by cleaning equipment after use, picking up your belongings, and disposing of your own refuse. After entering or exiting, be sure boathouse doors and gates are closed securely.\n\nNon-members may now join LPBC to row or paddle on a limited and temporary basis via our Guest and Visitor options. Guest rowers must be hosted by a current LPBC member; Visitors do not need to be hosted by a current member.\n\nGuests must pay a $15 fee and register in advance of their attendance. Guest rowers must be paired with a current member at all times they are present at LPBC rowing locations. LPBC requires an emailed confirmation of sculling skill level from a home club (to be initiated by the guest rower) if the member plans to row a club double or single. No email confirmation is necessary if the guest is rowing a private shell. This guest pass is valid for 4 rows maximum within a 2 week period. If the guest is planning to row at LPBC longer than that, they should consider one of our monthly membership team options.\n\nVisitors must pay a $50 fee and register in advance of their attendance. Visiting rowers or paddlers are not being hosted by a current member of LPBC. This visitor pass is valid for 2 rows maximum within a 2 week period. The visitor must coordinate practice times with coaches and needs to row with one of our teams or training groups. If the visitor is planning to row at LPBC longer than two times, they should consider a supporting membership or monthly membership.\n\nVisitors who wish to row or paddle outside of existing team practices may schedule a private lesson with a coach. All Private lesson registration options are available under Programs/Classes on our RegattaCentral registration page.\n\nMembers must use iCrew to check out shells and log their meters. This is for both private and club-owned equipment.\n\nRowing shells are categorized by skill level. There are boats for novices, for general use, and for competitive use. Approval by the Head Coach or Assistant Coach is necessary for competitive use shells.\n\nAny off-site use of Club equipment must be cleared in advance with the Head Coach, Rowing Director, or Paddling Director.\n\nLPBC members may not use equipment owned by private individuals, unless they have made previous arrangements with the owners.\n\nAfter use, all equipment must be wiped down and shells must be checked back into iCrew. Please remember to put oars and slings away as well.\n\nKayaks and canoes must be dried inside and out before being returned to the racks.\n\nDo not paddle kayaks without a seat, foot brace, or pins.\n\nMost equipment parts are not interchangeable; don’t remove or replace parts without explicit instruction or permission of the Rowing or Paddling Directors, Head Coach, or Assistant Coach"
