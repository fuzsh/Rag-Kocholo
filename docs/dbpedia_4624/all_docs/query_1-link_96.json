I added a comment, hoping that this would accelerate the path towards becoming official.\n\nComment by gvdhoorn on 2017-03-03:\n\nI've seen your comment. You might want to point back to your ROS Answers post, and provide a bit more context / background. I think input from a mfg of IMUs would be very welcome.\n\nComment by tobi_s on 2017-03-05:\n\nThanks for the encouragement. I think what is described in REP-145 is perfectly reasonable. I'm not familiar enough with ROS to decide whether it's a good idea to post imu messages with potentially different frames (ENU vs NED) in the same topic.\n\nComment by tobi_s on 2017-03-05:\n\nThe frame of the orientation quaternion will drift over time. W/out magnetometer, this will happen because of the lack of reference about the vertical axis, w/ magnetometer movement relative to nearby ferromagnets or electrical motors will affect the field, so the constant world frame is fictitious.\n\nComment by gvdhoorn on 2017-03-06:\n\nI'm not an expert, but I think in ROS we like to delegate those kind of things to other entities within your ROS node graph (ie: robot_localization fi).\n\nComment by tobi_s on 2017-03-06:\n\nSeeing this again: just to be clear, my previous two comments refer to two different issues, but the lack of space in the comments made me not write clearly enough.\n\nThanks for the pointer to robot_localization, will have a look."
