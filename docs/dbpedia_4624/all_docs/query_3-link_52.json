        "text": "A lumbar puncture is a test where a doctor uses a needle to get fluid from your child's lower back. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Your child lies on their side and is held still, and a doctor puts a needle between the bones of the lower back. It does not go near the spinal cord. Lumbar punctures are also sometimes called a spinal tap or LP.\n\nWhy does my child need a lumbar puncture?\n\nA lumbar puncture is needed to test the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. This test may be done to find out if a child has meningitis (a serious infection around the brain). Meningitis may be suspected in a baby with a fever, especially in babies less than one month old. Early diagnosis of meningitis can greatly improve your child's chances of a full recovery. If your child has meningitis, they will need other tests and treatment in hospital.\n\nLumbar punctures are also done for other reasons, but your child's doctor will discuss these with you before performing an LP.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nDuring a lumbar puncture, your child will lie on their side with their knees tucked into their chest and head bent forward. Babies will be curled in a ball to get a better position. Young children and babies will be held in position by an assistant. A doctor then puts a needle into the spaces between the spine bones (see white arrows in the figure below) to the area where the fluid is. This area is called the subarachnoid space.\n\nA lumbar puncture is an uncomfortable test, and sometimes painful. In addition, babies and small children do not like being held in place and will often cry. Your child may be given some cream or an injection to help numb the area where the needle will go in, and some children can be given medicine to make them feel calmer and less scared.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nA lumbar puncture is a safe test. Sometimes doctors are not able to get fluid, and they may have to try more than once. A small number of children may have a headache or backache for a day or two after the test. The risk of any serious complications, including bleeding, infection or damage to nerves, is extremely low.\n\nCare at home\n\nAfter the procedure, your child can be bathed normally. If there is a dressing or sticking plaster (e.g. BandAid) on your child's back, it can be taken off the next day or left to fall off by itself if your child prefers.\n\nIf your child has a headache or sore back, you can give them some paracetamol (see our fact sheet Pain relief for children).\n\nKey points to remember\n\nIn a lumbar puncture, a doctor uses a needle to take fluid from your child's lower back.\n\nIt is the only way to be sure if your child has meningitis or not, and is also used for other tests.\n\nA lumbar puncture is a safe test. The needle does not go near the spinal cord.\n\nFor more information\n\nKids Health Info fact sheet: Reducing your child's discomfort during procedures\n\nKids Health Info fact sheet: Pain relief for children\n\nKids Health Info fact sheet: Meningitis\n\nDeveloped by The Royal Children's Hospital General Medicine and Emergency Medicine departments.
