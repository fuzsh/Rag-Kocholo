        "text": "December 3, 2019\n\nPix4D makes it possible to measure from images. Ground control points make it possible to measure accurately.\n\nIf youâve attended a Pix4D training session, or spent any time on the Pix4D community or documentation, youâll have heard the term ground control points.\n\nGround control points are âthose big square thingsâ - right?\n\nRight - but theyâre a whole lot more than that too.\n\nIn this article, weâll cover what ground control points are, and why theyâre important in an aerial mapping project.\n\nWhat is ground control point in photogrammetry?\n\nGround control points (or GCPs) are points on the ground with known coordinates.\n\nIn an aerial mapping survey, GCPs are points which the surveyor can precisely pinpoint: with a handful of known coordinates, itâs possible to accurately map large areas.\n\nWhy do GCPs look like that?\n\nGround control points can be anything that can be easily recognized in the images. Typically they look like a small section of a checkerboard. The shape leaves very little ambiguity about where the âpointâ of a ground control point is.\n\nTheyâre almost always black and white because itâs easier to recognize high contrast patterns.\n\nThe points may be measured with traditional surveying methods, or have used LiDAR, or an existing map - even Google Earth.\n\nHow do I create ground control points?\n\nThere are many ways to make your own ground control points and in theory, GCPs can be made out of anything. The go-to rule is to use high-contrast colors - which is why ground control points are usually black and white - and be sure that they are large enough to be identified from your particular flight altitude.\n\nIt is better to use water-proof materials if you plan to use them again, and use a matte finish to reduce glare and improve visibility.\n\nOur users have made ground control points out of concrete posts (because painted GCPs kept getting washed away in the rain), vinyl flooring, baseball bases, and cardboard.\n\nA team of Pix4Ders baked cookie GCPs to test this theory - they worked well as manual tie points, but because we didnât know the precise coordinates we canât say the model was correctly georeferenced.\n\nGCPs, automatic and manual tie points - whatâs the difference?\n\nIn Pix4D software, tie points are points which exist in multiple images. These can be detected by the software (automatic tie points), or added manually by the user (manual tie points).\n\nManual tie points help improve the relative accuracy of a project, but donât help with absolute accuracy, as their location in space has not been defined.\n\nHow many GCPs are needed for an accurate aerial map?\n\nYou may be surprised - independent tests show you need fewer GCPs than you think for accurate results.\n\nThe Nevada Department of Transportation found that placing more than 5-10 GCPs had very little benefit.\n\nWhile placing ground control points can be time consuming, it takes less time than reflying a project to improve accuracy. We recommend using at least five ground control points.\n\nHow do I choose where to place ground control points?\n\nIf you were surveying a perfect square, it would be easy to answer that question: one ground control point at each corner, and one in the center.\n\nThings are seldom as simple as that. These quick tips will help you place ground control points for better accuracy.\n\nStay low. Ground control points should be on the ground for consistent results.\n\nBe careful when choosing ânaturally occuringâ ground control points. Some features (such as parking spaces or the corner of buildings) may be too repetitive to be useful. Shadows are tempting - but they may move even in the time it takes to fly a site.\n\nIf the area isnât perfectly flat, place GCPs across the different elevations - at the top and bottom of a hill, for example.\n\nExternal tests show thereâs generally no need to place dozens of ground control points: aim for between 5 and 10.\n\nHand painted ground control points: sacrificing accuracy for speed\n\nMappers in a hurry sometimes slash an X on the ground with spray paint to use as a GCP. The juryâs still out on whether or not this is better than nothing.\n\nImagine a line of spray paint: it might cover a handbreadths of the site. Small in relation to a building, but the 'center' is unclear compared to a traditional GCP.\n\nWhere is the center of each of the above images? Itâs easy to spot the center of the printed GCP on the right. On the spray painted X on the left, the âcenterâ is could be anywhere within a 10cm area: enough to throw off your results.\n\nWe always recommend checkerboard GCPs over spray painted ones. If you must use spray paint, paint a letter L rather than an X and pinpoint the corner, rather than the center.\n\nAdding GCPs to a Pix4D project\n\nYouâve placed GCPs in the field, marked them accurately, and flown your survey - whatâs the next step?\n\nPix4D documentation has detailed and up-to-date information about how to include GCPs in your project.\n\nDo I always need to use ground control points?\n\nIt depends.\n\nGCPs have been a traditional part of aerial mapping projects. However, this is changing.\n\nIf you are using an RTK drone, then our tests have found ground control points do not meaningfully improve accuracy.\n\nIf your drone is not RTK enabled, then we will always recommend using GCPs.\n\nSkipping ground control points may yield perfectly fine results, but your reconstruction might not have the correct scale, orientation, or absolute position information. GCPs or RTK geotags can help you verify the accuracy of the reconstruction.\n\nThe future of accuracy: AutoGCPs\n\nPix4Dengine is a powerful platform which drives photogrammetry at scale. And itâs just had a major upgrade.\n\nAutoGCPs is a new module which is currently exclusive to Pix4Dengine. As the name suggests, they can automatically detect GCPs in your project, accurately completing a manual task faster. The combination of machine-learning and computer vision allows the software to pinpoint the exact center of a ground control point almost instantly.\n\nInternal tests confirm that with RTK-enabled drones, AutoGCPs achieves âbetter than pixel precision,â says project lead Andrea Dotti. âWhen people take the measurements manually, the results are as accurate as they are.â\n\nThe technology is currently limited to Pix4Dengine: get in touch with the team to try it for yourself.\n\nAccuracy above all\n\nAs surveying and mapping professionals (and enthusiasts) know, accuracy is key to the success of just about any project.\n\nUsing a drone for aerial photography can yield impressive-looking images, but aerial photogrammetry requires precision and accuracy.\n\nThereâs a number of tools you can use to achieve this goal, as we will continue to outline in this series of posts. GCPs are just one of them."
