        "text": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\n\nGeneral Information About Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nKey Points\n\nAdult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.\n\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\nThere are different subtypes of AML.\n\nSmoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of AML.\n\nSigns and symptoms of AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.\n\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose AML.\n\nAfter AML has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\n\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\n\nAdult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.\n\nAML is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.\n\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\nNormally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. Blood stem cells mature into cells in the myeloid line or the lymphoid line. AML occurs due to a problem with blood stem cell development in the myeloid line.\n\nMyeloid stem cells go through several stages of development in the bone marrow before fully maturing into:\n\nred blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body\n\ngranulocytes and other types of white blood cells that help the body’s immune system respond to infection, allergens, and inflammation\n\nplatelets that help stop bleeding by forming clots\n\nIn AML, there is an increase in the number of immature white blood cells called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. As the number of these cells, also called leukemia cells, increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy platelets, red blood cells, and other white blood cells. This may lead to easy bleeding, anemia, and infection.\n\nThe leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. Sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma is also called extramedullary myeloid tumor, granulocytic sarcoma, or chloroma.\n\nThere are different subtypes of AML.\n\nMost AML subtypes are based on how mature (developed) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis, and how different they are from normal cells.\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML. This leukemia occurs when genes on chromosome 15 switch places with some genes on chromosome 17, and an abnormal gene called PML::RARA is made. The PML::RARA gene sends a message that stops promyelocytes (a type of white blood cell) from maturing. Problems with severe bleeding and blood clots may occur. This is a serious health problem that needs treatment as soon as possible. APL usually occurs in middle-aged adults.\n\nSmoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of AML.\n\nAML is caused by certain changes to the way blood stem cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for AML, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things people cannot change, like their genetics, getting older, and their health history.\n\nThere are many risk factors for AML, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to AML. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer?\n\nHaving one or more of these risk factors does not mean that you will get AML. Many people with risk factors never develop AML, while others with no known risk factors do.\n\nPossible risk factors for AML include:\n\nbeing male\n\nolder age\n\nsmoking\n\nhaving had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past\n\nbeing exposed to radiation in the environment (such as nuclear radiation) or to the chemical benzene\n\nhaving a personal history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome\n\nhaving certain syndromes or inherited disorders\n\nTalk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\n\nSigns and symptoms of AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.\n\nThe early signs and symptoms of AML may be like those caused by the flu or other common diseases. Check with your doctor if you have:\n\nweakness or feeling tired\n\nfever\n\ninfection\n\npaleness or loss of normal skin color\n\nbleeding\n\nLess common signs or symptoms may be caused by clusters of leukemia cells in the CNS or testicles, or a tumor of myeloid cells called a chloroma.\n\nSymptoms of acute leukemia often develop between 4 and 6 weeks before diagnosis.\n\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose AML.\n\nIn addition to asking about your personal and family health history and doing a physical exam, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\n\nComplete blood count (CBC) is a laboratory test in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for:\n\nthe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets\n\nthe amount of hemoglobin (the substance in the blood that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells\n\nthe amount of hematocrit (whole blood that is made up of red blood cells)\n\nPeripheral blood smear is a laboratory test in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.\n\nFlow cytometry is a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other) markers on the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient's blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a fluid, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy is the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.\n\nTumor biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues from a lump using a needle. This may be done if the doctor suspects the leukemia cells may have formed a solid tumor called a myeloid sarcoma (also called a chloroma).\n\nCytogenetic analysis is a laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.\n\nMolecular testing is a laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of blood or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing AML. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a prognosis.\n\nImmunophenotyping is a laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia. For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample. A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.\n\nReverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test (RT–PCR) is a laboratory test in which the amount of a genetic substance called mRNA made by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of RNA into a matching piece of DNA, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer. This test is used to diagnose certain types of AML including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).\n\nAfter AML has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow:\n\nLumbar puncture is a procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\n\nCT scan (CAT scan) is a procedure that uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.\n\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\n\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your AML diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\n\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care. You can contact NCI’s Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer.\n\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\n\nThe prognosis and treatment options for AML depend on many factors:\n\nThe patient's age. Older age at diagnosis may be linked to lower remission rates and more complications.\n\nWhether the leukemia has spread to the CNS.\n\nWhether the patient has a systemic infection at the time of diagnosis.\n\nWhether the patient has a very high white blood cell count at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThe subtype of AML.\n\nWhether the patient received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past to treat a different cancer.\n\nWhether there is a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nWhether the cancer has been treated before or recurred (come back).\n\nIt is important that AML be treated right away.\n\nStages of Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nKey Points\n\nThere is no standard staging system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nThere is no standard staging system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nThe extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. Instead of stages, AML treatment is based on one or more of the following:\n\nthe subtype of AML\n\nwhether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow\n\nwhether the leukemia is newly diagnosed, in remission, refractory, or recurrent\n\nNewly diagnosed (untreated) AML\n\nIn untreated AML, the disease is newly diagnosed. It has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true:\n\nThe complete blood count (CBC) is abnormal.\n\nAt least 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells) or there are certain gene changes.\n\nThere are signs or symptoms of leukemia.\n\nAML in remission\n\nIn AML in remission, the disease has been treated and the following are true:\n\nThe CBC is normal.\n\nLess than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).\n\nThere are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain and spinal cord or elsewhere in the body.\n\nRefractory or recurrent AML\n\nAfter treatment with chemotherapy, some people with newly diagnosed AML will not go into remission. This is called refractory cancer. In contrast, recurrent AML is cancer that has recurred (come back) after remission. The AML may come back in the blood or bone marrow.\n\nLearn more in Recurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet When Cancer Returns.\n\nTreatment Option Overview\n\nKey Points\n\nThere are different types of treatment for people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nThe treatment of AML usually has two phases.\n\nPatients receive supportive care for side effects of treatment.\n\nThe following types of treatment are used:\n\nChemotherapy\n\nRadiation therapy\n\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\n\nTargeted therapy\n\nOther drug therapy\n\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n\nTreatment for acute myeloid leukemia may cause side effects.\n\nFollow-up care may be needed.\n\nThere are different types of treatment for people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nDifferent types of treatments are available for people with AML. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the phase of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\n\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You’ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you’ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Treatment.\n\nThe treatment of AML usually has two phases.\n\nThere are two treatment phases of AML:\n\nRemission induction therapy is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission.\n\nPostremission therapy is the second phase of treatment. It begins after the leukemia is in remission. The goal of postremission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse. This phase is also called remission continuation therapy.\n\nPatients receive supportive care for side effects of treatment.\n\nPatients must be closely monitored during treatment of AML. Myelosuppression, a condition which results in fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, is a side effect of both AML and treatment with chemotherapy. Supportive care during remission induction therapy may include:\n\nred blood cell and platelet transfusions to replace blood cells destroyed by the cancer or its treatment\n\nantibiotics and antifungals to prevent or treat infections\n\nThe following types of treatment are used:\n\nChemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the subtype of AML being treated and whether the leukemia cells have spread to the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord).\n\nSystemic chemotherapy is when chemotherapy drugs are taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.\n\nSystemic chemotherapy drugs used to treat AML include:\n\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\n\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat AML that has spread to the CNS (brain and spinal cord). Intrathecal chemotherapy is a method of placing chemotherapy directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This approach is used because the blood-brain barrier, a protective layer around the brain, can prevent chemotherapy drugs given by mouth or into a vein from reaching the CNS.\n\nCytarabine and methotrexate are two chemotherapy drugs given as intrathecal chemotherapy to treat AML. These drugs can also be given systemically.\n\nTo learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more, see Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer and Chemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy\n\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. AML is sometimes treated with external radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Total-body irradiation sends radiation toward the whole body. It is a type of external radiation that may be used to prepare the body for a stem cell transplant when the leukemia has recurred.\n\nLearn more about External Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer and Radiation Therapy Side Effects.\n\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\n\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell transplant is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\n\nLearn more about Stem Cell Transplants in Cancer Treatment.\n\nTargeted therapy\n\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Your doctor may suggest biomarker tests to help predict your response to certain targeted therapy drugs. Learn more about Biomarker Testing for Cancer.\n\nTargeted therapies used to treat AML include:\n\nLess-intensive targeted therapies in people who are unable or unwilling to receive other treatments include:\n\nLearn more about Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer.\n\nOther drug therapy\n\nArsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option.\n\nUse our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nTo learn more about clinical trials, see Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers.\n\nTreatment for acute myeloid leukemia may cause side effects.\n\nFor information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, visit our Side Effects page.\n\nFollow-up care may be needed.\n\nAs you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\n\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\n\nTreatment of Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nStandard treatment of untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during the remission induction phase depends on the subtype of AML and may include:\n\ncombination chemotherapy that includes cytarabine\n\ncombination chemotherapy with targeted therapy (midostaurin or quizartinib), for people whose AML has a mutation in the FLT3 gene\n\ncombination chemotherapy with the targeted therapy drug gemtuzumab ozogamicin\n\nintrathecal chemotherapy (cytarabine or methotrexate), for central nervous system (CNS) leukemia\n\nsupportive care\n\nFor older adults or people who are unable or unwilling to receive intensive chemotherapy, the following may be continued as long as the person benefits or until toxic effects occur:\n\ntargeted therapy (enasidenib, gilteritinib, glasdegib, ivosidenib, or venetoclax)\n\nlow-dose chemotherapy (azacitidine, low-dose cytarabine, or decitabine)\n\ntargeted therapy with low-dose chemotherapy\n\nintrathecal chemotherapy, for CNS leukemia\n\nsupportive care\n\nTo learn more about these treatments, see the Treatment Option Overview.\n\nUse our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\n\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\n\nPurpose of This Summary\n\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult acute myeloid leukemia. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\n\nReviewers and Updates\n\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\n\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board.\n\nClinical Trial Information\n\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.
