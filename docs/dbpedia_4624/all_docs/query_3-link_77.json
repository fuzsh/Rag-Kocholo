        "text": "Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.\n\n\"Invent and Simplify\" Leadership Principle Explained by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\n\nLeaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.\n\n\"Hire and Develop the Best\" Leadership Principle Explained by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\n\nLeaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.\n\n\"Insist on the Highest Standards\" Leadership Principle Explained by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\n\nLeaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.\n\n\"Earn Trust\" Leadership Principle Explained by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\n\nLeaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\n\n\"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\" Leadership Principle Explained by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\n\nLeaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.\n\n\"Strive to Be Earth's Best Employer\" Leadership Principle Explained by CEO Andy Jassy\n\nWe started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.\n\n\"Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility\" Leadership Principle Explained by CEO Andy Jassy\n\nDownload a reference copy of Amazon's Leadership Principles."
