A goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team to touch the puck prior to the puck entering the net.\n\nNote: Goals scored during a shootout do not count towards a playerâ€™s goal total.\n\nGame-winning goals. After the final score has been determinded, the goal which leaves the winning team one goal ahead of its opponent is the game-winning goal (example: if Team A beats Team B 8-3, the player scoring the fourth goal for Team A receives credit for the game-winning goal).\n\nNote: Goals scored during a shootout are not credited as game-winning goals."
