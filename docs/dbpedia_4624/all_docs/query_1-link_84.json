        "text": "Our Board of Directors is made up of six executive directors, the Chair and five non-executive directors. Our Council of Governors appoint the Chair and non-executive directors for a fixed term of up to three years. The Chief Executive Officer and executive directors are appointed by the non-executive directors.\n\nBoard of directors' meetings are held on the dates listed below and these meetings are open to the public. The agenda and papers for the meetings will be posted on this page approximately seven days prior to the meeting. 15 minutes is allowed at the start of the meeting to respond to questions previously notified from the public.\n\nThe next Board of Directors meeting will take place on Thursday 5 September 2024. If you would like to submit a question to the Board prior to the meeting, please email our Deputy Trust Secretary, Amy Poole, by 5pm on Monday 26 August at amy.poole1@nhs.net.\n\nThe last Board of Directors meeting took place on 11 July 2024.\n\nWatch it back here\n\nBoard stories\n\nA story involving our services, from either a patient or member of staff, is heard at each board meeting. These stories serve to highlight their experiences and are presented first-hand by the member of staff or patient if they are happy to speak at the meeting.\n\nInformation for staff, patients and carers who are presenting service experiences at a Board meeting:\n\nWhen presenting a story, it is important to offer a balanced view of strengths and opportunities. It is also important not to disclose patient identifiable information and this may require some thought as to how to achieve this. For example, anonymous patient, ward, hospital and town names.\n\nThink about the key issues for the service and the information the Board may require to make decisions or to make quality improvements. Meetings are held ‘in public’, which means that anyone is free to attend and with notice, may ask a questions. The Chair allows up to 15 minutes at the start of the meeting for this. It is quite likely that you will start within a minute or so of 9am.\n\nThe room will be set up in board room style (everyone sits around one table) There will be a projector and screen at one end of the room. Please email Karen Scott if you will be using PowerPoint or any other visual aids. This will ensure that the presentation is loaded and checked in advance of the meeting starting.\n\nThe meeting will start at 9am prompt. It is recommended that you aim to arrive a few minutes before so that you can familiarise yourself with the room and the arrangements. Jenna and Karen will be in the room from 8.30am onwards. Please keep any story and presentation to about 10 minutes, which will be followed by questions.\n\nThe Chair will coordinate the questions and will invite individuals to ask these in an ordered way. This is a formal meeting, however, the Board will try to put the patient, staff and other attendees at ease. They will allow them to tell their story in a way that they feel best informs the audience. If you would like any more information, please feel free to contact Karen to discuss. Please send any presentation to them in advance of the meeting."
