        "text": "ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nBeing technical consultants, we have conducted various feasible insurance studies for major financial institutions where we have contributed efficiently to deliver distinguished medical healthcare products and unparalleled insurance services.\n\nAs such, we have been assigned to follow the administration and revision of the medical claims process to ensure prompt settlement and accuracy and in the same time, act as a liaison between Bank’s insurance division and Insurance Companies.\n\nFurthermore, we have been involved constantly to broaden the business operation of the ALARGAN Group for expansion and diversification into new profitable business ventures. Therefore by playing a major role of being part of this Group, We firmly believe that our business performance have always been successful. After all, we are always dedicated to make a difference to be seen as a part of constructive and innovative solutions to achieve our goals. In fact this has allowed us to consolidate our position in the market, raise our standard and grow steadily along with the right partner.\n\nTHE PART & FUNCTION OF THE INSURANCE BROKER\n\nWe, at alargan are not merely an intermediary searching for an insurer and an insured and bringing them together. Above all we are the technical adviser & the administrator of the client’s interests in all insurance matters.\n\n1 - STUDY\n\nUsing our experience of risks and possibilities of placing them, we will first make an analysis of the situation which causes the need for guarantee. For this purpose we first of all resort to the technique of risks, which varies according to the nature & exposure of the risk.\n\nShould you have a specialized department, we will be glad to make the study in co-operation with them.\n\nWe, from our side, will offer you our experience and our knowledge of the market, acquired by negotiating similar cases\n\n2 - ACTIVITIES\n\nHow do we see such a study & how do we proceed?\n\nThe first step is gathering information through questionnaires, in order to get a general idea of your company or organization.\n\nThe next important phase is an interview with the members of your staff who are in charge of the topics that are subject to our study. In this phase a good personal contact is of major importance.\n\nThen we present our findings and a draft of the measures to be taken.\n\nThe confrontation of our report with your point of view results in a final solution with regard to the risks which you can bear yourself and those which the insurers are to take over...\n\n3 - ELABORATION OF THE CONTRACT\n\nOnce the risk has been marked out, we apply the proper insurance technique, according to the kind of insurance.\n\n» We give a simple solution to a complex problem and are ready to assist you at all times. » We thoroughly examine all your relevant insurance problems and study the existing insurance policies of your organization. » Either we will adapt the particular conditions to your needs or, if necessary elaborate a complete policy and avoid having a gap in the cover. » Sometimes we draw-up several schemes in order to offer you an alternative choice and propose you an appropriate insurance cover made to measure.\n\n4 - PLACING\n\nOnce the guarantees have been fixed, taking into account the insurance possibilities and when our negotiations with you lead to a favourable stance, we start with the commercial study of the placing. In this case too, our experience of the market, which is always in evolution , indicates the right steps to be taken :\n\n» Which companies are more specialized in underwriting this or that risk? » Which companies accept certain conditions, less common but more advantageous for the insured? » Which companies offer the most reasonable and competitive premiums? » Sometimes we draw-up several schemes in order to offer you an alternative choice and propose you an appropriate insurance cover made to measure.\n\nConsequently, a call for tenders will be issued by us in complete and absolute discretion, selecting the companies in view of their capacity and solvability in the first place and in view of their specialization and quotations in the second place 5 - ADMINISTRATION\n\nOnce the matter has been concluded and agreed upon, we take care of the contract’s administration, and keep an eye on due dates. In case of a claim, we will follow-up the claim settlement process.\n\nStill, we think that our job is not finished there, and at regular intervals further follow-up may be necessary.\n\n6 - CONCLUSION\n\nOur description allows a striking comparison: the brokers part is equal to that of an architect who, after hearing the client’s wishes, advises him about the project to be realized. He then drafts it, chooses the materials and the techniques to be used, according to the newest developments in the field.\n\nWe are devoted to render our professional support to provide distinguished and unrivalled services to satisfy the various needs to our clients.\n\nWe believe it is worthy to join our views with yours. Our task is to improve your insurance programs and reduce considerably your costs as we are convinced we can.\n\nMAJOR LINES OF OUR INSURANCE SERVICES"
