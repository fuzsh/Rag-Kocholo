These local agents can conduct property tours for foreign buyers, provide relevant information about the property and the area, and guide them through the purchase and transaction process. Also, they can exploit their local networks and connections to promote and sell residential properties to foreign buyers.\n\nCreating a professional and attractive website to display available residential apartments and related information can help you attract foreign buyers. On the website, include high-quality photos of the property, comprehensive information about the property and area, related facilities and services, and related rules and regulations. Also, you can use online marketing methods such as Google Ads, using social media and other digital methods to attract foreign customers.\n\nParticipating in exhibitions and events related to the property and housing industry in the Middle east and West asia can provide a good opportunity to introduce residential properties to foreign buyers.

This includes advertising in local media such as radio, television, newspapers, magazines and billboards. By using local ads, you can reach local and foreign buyers in your target area.

They can assist foreign buyers as mediators and consultants in the purchase and transaction process by providing accurate and appropriate information. Providing professional and reliable after-sales service to foreign buyers can differentiate you from your competitors. Ensuring that foreign buyers are well supported during the decision-making process and after the purchase can increase their trust and satisfaction and make them more likely to recommend you to others.\n\nBecause foreign buyers may not know their native language well, translating and presenting relevant information in different languages ​​can help them understand and access the information. The most important point in marketing to foreign buyers is to understand and pay attention to their needs and variables. Use the local and cultural information of your target area and try to get to know the foreign housing market well."
