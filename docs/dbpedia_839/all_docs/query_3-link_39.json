        "text": "Who are we\n\nOur young team of professionals with residence at Palma de Majorca is staking on the relationships with our clients built on trust and transparency in the management of our own and someone else’s property. We are acting through various companies and in different business sectors in view of the optimization of our own and foreign resources, achievement of minimum investment risk and maximum cost efficiency of the investor’s capital.\n\nIn order to achieve all planned goals, we endeavor to be ahead of the market investing in newly arising or established sectors and withdrawing our investments from sectors, where business perspectives are of no interest. At present, “Grup Jomac” is operating in many different sectors such as: real estates promotion – on national and international levels, land management, restaurant management, insurance business and informatics.\n\nBy the moment, we have gained vast experience in the real estate business on the Balearic Islands, Valencia, Andalusia and Bulgaria. We directly manage APTC restaurant, which is in the process of enhanced expansion. The services as insurance agency, applied informatics products and consulting in the field of informatics are the result of our efforts to offer a full service package to our clients-investors.\n\nSince 2005, “Grup Jomac” established lasting presence in Bulgaria with an office in Burgas to manage the investments in the country, mainly in the real estate sector, but with continuous monitoring and studying the market because of the big potential of this area.\n\nOur team comprises young people – Spaniards and Bulgarians, working together for the fast, easy and efficient solution of any kind of problem as of our group, as well as of our clients.\n\nOur goal is to offer services to foreign investors, who wish that, as well as to take care of the development of our own business, mostly – sales of apartments along the Black Sea coastline – in South Sands Resort complex."
