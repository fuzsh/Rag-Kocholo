        "text": "In March of 1959, mathematics was firmly established at the IHÉS by the appointment of Jean Dieudonné and Alexander Grothendieck as professors. Their seminars attracted mathematicians from abroad as well as from the region of Paris. In physics, things developed more slowly; no permanent appointments were made in 1959. However, Res Jost, Léon van Hove, Murray Gell-Mann and Louis Michel were named permanent invités. The first visiting member appears to have been Eduardo Caianiello in April 1959. As far as I know the next two visitors were Gunnar Källén and I in May and June 1960. … The director of the IHÉS [was] Léon Motchane. Källén and I located our operations in the garden. Fortunately, the weather was outstandingly good that summer. We had plenty to talk about, as I will now relate in some detail, since our preoccupations had a connection with Motchane’s idea that the IHÉS should be a place where mathematicians and physicists interacted."
