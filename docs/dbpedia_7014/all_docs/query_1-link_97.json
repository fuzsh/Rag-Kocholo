He largely created the theory of continuous symmetry and applied it to the study of geometry and differential equations. He also made substantial contributions to the development of algebra. Here are some of his key contributions: 1. Theory of Continuous Groups (Lie Groups): Lie's most significant contribution was the development of the theory of continuous groups, now known as Lie groups. These are groups of transformations that are continuous, in contrast to the discrete groups studied in other parts of mathematics. Lie groups have become fundamental in many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, particularly in the study of symmetry. 2. Lie Algebras: Associated with Lie groups are Lie algebras, which are algebraic structures that capture the essence of the groups' infinitesimal transformations. Lie algebras have become a crucial tool in various areas of mathematics and physics, including quantum mechanics and string theory. 3. Transformation Groups: Lie extensively worked on transformation groups, which are groups of geometric transformations. His work laid the groundwork for the modern approach to symmetries in geometry and physics. 4. Differential Geometry: Lie's work in the field of differential geometry was pioneering. He applied the concept of continuous groups to the study of differential equations and geometric structures, which was a novel approach at the time. 5. Integration of Differential Equations: Lie developed new methods for the integration of differential equations based on his theory of continuous groups. This had a significant impact on the field of differential equations. 6. Lie's Third Theorem: This theorem, one of his most important results, states that to every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over the field of real numbers, there corresponds a Lie group. This theorem bridged the abstract study of Lie algebras with the more concrete study of Lie groups. 7. Influence on Other Fields: Lie's theories have influenced various fields, including algebra, geometry, and the theory of differential equations. They have also played a crucial role in the development of modern physics, particularly in areas such as particle physics and cosmology. Lie's work was characterized by a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of different areas of mathematics and a vision that saw the unifying role of symmetry in mathematics and physics. His contributions continue to influence contemporary research and are considered foundational in several areas of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.

AIFI - Artificial Intelligence Finance Institute\n\nTalking about unsung math heroes, it's hard not to mention the 19th-century French mathematician Pierre Wantzel. In a single paper published in 1837, Wantzel solved not one, but two problems that mathematicians had been attempting to solve for many millennia! What were these problems? Ancient Greeks were obsessed with so-called ruler-and-compass geometrical constructions, where achieving a certain goal was only allowed using those two instruments (the ruler was supposed to be unmarked). Consequently, there are numerous problems, such as constructing a square with an area twice that of the original square or another regular polygon, creating a line with a length equal to the square root of the original one, and so on. Two particularly notorious problems that stumped the best mathematicians for many millennia were: a. Trisecting an angle: dividing a given angle into three equal parts. b. Doubling a cube: constructing a cube with twice the volume of the original one. Now, in his paper, Wantzel had just proved that these tasks were impossible to achieve! How did he do it? Wantzel converted this purely geometrical problem into an algebraic one. He demonstrated that solving both would require finding a solution of a cubic equation, but only quadratic ones are solvable by geometrical means. Today, we associate these kinds of proofs with the work of another French genius, Évariste Galois, who single-handedly created a new branch of mathematics we call modern (or abstract) algebra. Galois wrote virtually all his work in one night on May 30, 1831, before his duel, where he was fatally wounded, dying a day later at the age of 20. Nevertheless, his work was only published in 1848, giving Wantzel credit for the original solution of these two puzzles. For someone who solved two millennial problems, Wantzel has certainly not received enough credit. In fact, his work was never mentioned in any publication for about 50 years! Even today, Wantzel’s name is not a household one, despite all the hard work he put in. And Wantzel did work hard. If your parents or your teachers ever told you that no one died from overwork, Wantzel could have been used as a counterexample - he literally worked himself to death. His early demise at the age of 33 was attributed to his unhealthy work habits, including working through the night with only a few hours of sleep and consuming colossal amounts of coffee. Let’s then remember Wantzel as a man who managed to solve two of the hardest problems in the history of mathematics by thinking outside the box and as someone who serves as an example of the importance of work-life balance for everyone."
