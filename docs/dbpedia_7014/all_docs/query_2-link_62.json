German-born, but raised in France, Grothendieck is credited in his adopted country with having reconstructed algebraic geometry and of being nothing short of the modern Euclid. Ordinary mortals, unable to grasp even the premises of his logic remain baffled, but to the tiny fraction of humanity versed in his theorems, he remains a giant.\n\nRecondite, abstruse and arcane are the words that will spring to most people’s minds in connection with Grothendieck’s achievement. Americans would add “awesome”, and they would not be wrong. One is reminded of the famous story about the physicist and mathematician Sir Arthur"
