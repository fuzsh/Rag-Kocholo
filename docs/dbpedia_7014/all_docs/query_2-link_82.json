This work, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1962, played a key role in the development of differential topology. 2. Morse Theory: Milnor's book \"Morse Theory\" became a fundamental text in the field. Morse theory relates the topology of a manifold to the critical points of a smooth function on the manifold. His clear exposition and insightful treatment of the subject have made this theory more accessible and applicable to a broader range of mathematical disciplines. 3. Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces: In this area, Milnor studied the singular points of complex hypersurfaces, which led to the development of what is now known as Milnor fibration. His work on singularities has been influential in both algebraic geometry and topology. 4. H-Cobordism Theorem: Milnor's proof of the h-cobordism theorem was another major contribution to differential topology. This theorem, which gives conditions under which a cobordism is trivial, has been a foundational result in the classification of high-dimensional manifolds. 5.

An alternative form of tropical algebra uses max(x, y) for addition. Computations of tropical algebra are easier/faster to implement in hardware, because multiplication is simplified to addition and exponentiation to multiplication. When real-valued input data is encoded as the transition instant of a signal from 0 to 1, a single OR gate can perform tropical addition. The descriptor \"tropical\" was attached to this algebra by French mathematicians in honor of the Hungarian-born Brazilian computer scientist Imre Simon, who published several papers on these ideas in the late 1970s. Apparently, to Frenchmen, Brazil is quite tropical! Some on-line sources credit Bernard Carre's 1971 paper, \"An Algebra for Network Routing Problems,\" as the birthplace of these ideas. Many of the properties of ordinary algebra are valid in tropical algebra. For example, distributivity holds: x tm (y ta z) = (x tm y) ta (x tm z) Translation: x + min(y, z) = min(x + y, x + z) A polynomial in tropical algebra takes the form: f(x) = (a(0)) ta (a(1) tm x) ta (a(2) tm 2x) ta . . . ta (a(n) tm nx) = min(a(0), a(1) + x, a(2) + 2x, . . . , a(n) + nx) Explanation for tropical exponentiation: x te j = jx Tropical algebra began garnering serious attention when it was realized that the Floyd-Warshall shortest-path algorithm using min-plus operations can be formulated in tropical algebra. There is more to tropical math than the short introduction above. For example, there is tropical geometry, tropical analysis, and tropical cryptography, to name a few related areas. The following book describes Tropical geometry as \"a combinatorial shadow of algebraic geometry, offering new polyhedral tools to compute invariants of algebraic varieties. It is based on tropical algebra, where the sum of two numbers is their minimum and the product is their sum. This turns polynomials into piecewise-linear functions, and their zero sets into polyhedral complexes. These tropical varieties retain a surprising amount of information about their classical counterparts.\" Maclagan, Diane and Bernd Sturmfels, 'Introduction to Tropical Geometry,' American Mathematical Society, 2015. Here is a nice introduction to tropical mathematics: https://lnkd.in/gMmwcQrV\n\nVladimir Igorevich Arnold ( 1937 – 2010 ) was a Russian mathematician. He is known for the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem regarding the stability of integrable systems, and contributed to several areas, including geometrical theory of dynamical systems theory, algebra, catastrophe theory, topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, symplectic topology, differential equations, classical mechanics, differential geometric approach to hydrodynamics, geometric analysis and singularity theory, including posing the ADE classification problem. Here are some of his key contributions: 1. KAM Theory: Together with Andrei Kolmogorov and Jürgen Moser, Arnold developed the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. This theory addresses the stability of integrable systems in classical mechanics and provides conditions under which an integrable Hamiltonian system can be slightly perturbed without becoming chaotic, thus explaining the persistence of quasi-periodic motions in certain systems. 2. Arnold Diffusion: In celestial mechanics, Arnold contributed to the understanding of the diffusion process in the phase space of Hamiltonian systems, which can lead to slow changes in the orbit of a celestial body over a long time. 3. Singularity Theory: Arnold made significant advancements in singularity theory, which studies the properties of spaces that are not smooth, like the points of a cone or the edge of a cube. His work laid the foundation for understanding the classification and characterization of singularities in different contexts. 4. Arnold's Conjecture in Symplectic Geometry: This conjecture relates fixed points of a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism to the topology of the underlying manifold. It has been a central problem in symplectic geometry and has driven much research in the field. 5. Topological Fluid Dynamics: Arnold applied topological methods to the study of fluid dynamics, offering a new perspective on the behavior of incompressible flows. This approach led to what is now known as Arnold's structure theorem, which describes the global structure of steady flows. 6. Arnold's Cat Map: In the field of dynamical systems, Arnold introduced the concept of the cat map, a linear, chaotic map that is an example of an Anosov diffeomorphism. This concept is used in various fields, including cryptography and image processing. 7. Ergodic Theory: Arnold also made contributions to ergodic theory, which deals with the statistical properties of dynamical systems. 8. Mathematical Education: Beyond his direct research contributions, Arnold was known for his unique approach to teaching. His textbooks and problems have influenced mathematical education worldwide. Arnold's work is characterized by its depth, originality, and the elegant application of geometric and topological methods to solve complex problems in various fields of mathematics and physics.

Source: Wiki, Brown University, AIs and Humans https://lnkd.in/dBXvpSmr AIFI - Artificial Intelligence Finance Institute\n\nRobert Phelan Langlands, ( 1936 ) is a Canadian mathematician. He is best known as the founder of the Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures and results connecting representation theory and automorphic forms to the study of Galois groups in number theory,for which he received the 2018 Abel Prize. He also got the Wolf Prize in 1995. He was an emeritus professor and occupied Albert Einstein's office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, until 2020 when he retired. Here are some key aspects of his scientific contributions: 1. Langlands Program: Langlands' most significant contribution is the formulation of the Langlands program. This set of conjectures and ideas, first proposed in a letter to André Weil in 1967, seeks to create a grand unifying theory linking areas of number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. The program suggests deep connections between Galois groups (which arise in the study of polynomial equations and their roots) and automorphic forms (complex-valued functions with certain invariance properties). 2. Reciprocity Conjectures: A cornerstone of the Langlands program is the series of reciprocity conjectures. These conjectures generalize class field theory (which describes abelian extensions of number fields) to non-abelian Galois groups, proposing a correspondence between Galois representations and automorphic representations. This was a revolutionary idea that opened up new ways of thinking about and studying these mathematical objects. 3. Functoriality and Endoscopy: Langlands introduced the concept of functoriality within his program, which deals with how automorphic representations of one group relate to those of another group. He also developed the theory of endoscopy, a set of techniques to understand the internal structure of automorphic representations, particularly in cases where functorial transfer is not straightforward. 4. Trace Formula: Langlands made significant contributions to the development of the trace formula, a powerful tool in the study of automorphic forms. The trace formula is an analytic tool that allows mathematicians to count automorphic representations with certain properties. 5. Influence on Other Fields: The Langlands program has influenced various other areas of mathematics. It has played a role in the proof of major theorems, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles, and has been instrumental in the development of the theory of Shimura varieties in algebraic geometry. 6. Collaborations and Mentoring: Beyond his own research, Langlands has been influential through collaborations and mentoring other mathematicians, contributing to the growth and development of the field. His contributions have not only opened new avenues of research but have also provided a framework that connects various seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. https://lnkd.in/d7BYmRP4 AIFI - Artificial Intelligence Finance Institute"
