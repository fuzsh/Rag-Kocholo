        "text": "Some of these items just form a particular style of doing mathematics, or constitute lofty but not ridiculous ambitions here. This encompasses your items 1,2,5 and 6. Probably the most concrete objective here is the first one: You can start with an existing theorem, and then tinker with it to try and find out what exactly its requirements should be, what concepts should be mentioned in the proof, and what the \"proof from the book\" for it is. The others are more what is in the far distance, and getting anywhere will require a significant body of work. Also, do keep in mind that many of your goals refer to aesthetic judgment, and thus will require substantial interaction with the broader community.\n\nGoals 4, 8 and 9 are a mix between being ultimately meaningless and far to grandious to ever state about ones own work.\n\nGoals 3 and 7 are bad goals to have. They may be very worthy things to actually do, in certain circumstances, but if you start out intending to transform mathematics, you will fail. In order to convince others to use your new language, you need to make the case that it is a significant, maybe even necessary improvement over the status quo. To able to make this case, you should only seek radical change if the mathematics itself drives you to it. Otherwise, you will just come about as a crank and be ignored.\n\nOne important question you need to ask yourself here is whether you actually seek to do mathematics in this way, or whether you are simply captivated by the image of yourself-as-the-new-Grothendieck. The latter would be a very human motivation, but that motivation would also explain why the doing doesn't come naturally to you."
