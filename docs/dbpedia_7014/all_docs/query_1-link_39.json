There are also various theses by students of Grothendieck on Dessin d'enfants which are very readable (and show his influence on their way of writing). I do not know of a link for them but you can search on the website of the institute at Montpellier and by following up the links on the Grothendieck circle website.\n\nAs stated by Tim Porter in his answer, it all depends on what's the meaning you assign to the word 'concrete'.\n\nSaid that, possibly one of the most concrete (up to the limit of being applied and applicable) works of Alexander Grothendieck is, in my personal opinion, his work on (the \"algebrization\" of) Fredholm theory. His approach, described in the work [1] (and others references cited therein) seems inspired to an approach to abstraction I wrote about also in other posts on this and on the Math.SE sister site: according to this approach, \"abstract\" means \"applicable in the widest possible context\", thus in turn deeply concrete.\n\nReference\n\n[1] Alexander Grothendieck, \"La théorie de Fredholm\", (French) Bull. Soc. Math. Fr. 84, 319-384 (1956), MR88665, Zbl 0073.10101."
