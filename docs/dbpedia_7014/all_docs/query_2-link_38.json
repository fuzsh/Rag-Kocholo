I'm sincerely sorry, if you think it isn't.\n\nFor a lot of time, \"EGA\" by Alexander Grothendieck and Jean Dieudonne was \"the\" reference on the basics of scheme theory and homological methods. Students and teachers got a lot of books following EGA - Hartshorne's \"Algebraic Geometry\" and the rest. Those are textbooks. Some can say they are more pedagogical than \"EGA\". Especially, books like Vakil's \"Foundations of Algebraic Geometry\", which try to convey the intuition on the highly technical and abstract subject for the new learners. But \"EGA\" had it's pros. It is complete, it has all the proofs, it's as general as possible. Despite what many people said (and they were right, it's just they probably confused \"majority\" with \"everyone\"), for some people \"EGA\" was \"the\" source. They like it abstract and rigorous. It's how their mind works.\n\nNowadays, we have \"The Stacks Project\". It's 5000 pages for modern algebraic geometry - schemes and stacks, and the needed prerequisites. One could say it's \"the modern EGA\" or \"EGA of 21st century\". I'm not saying that \"EGA\" is not valuable anymore, I don't have expertise to claim it even if I wanted to, and I certainly don't want to.\n\nFor those who could benefit more from the \"handbook-like\" presentation, I wonder how a first course from \"The Stacks Project\" could be taught. It has a lot of information in there, certainly, one, especially, a novice, could get lost in there.\n\nI would like you to propose a roadmap of studying scheme theory from \"The Stacks Project\". What chapters are relevant for the first fundamental independent study of modern algebraic geometry, and what are reserved for later or simply more specialized."
