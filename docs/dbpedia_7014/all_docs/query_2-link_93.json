        "text": "Hitler's ascent to power in 1933 marked a profound change in the balance of power in mathematics. Not only did German-Jewish mathematicians escape to Britain and America, but a revival of French mathematics began under the influence of young scholars who had gone to Germany to study. Lamenting the lack of suitable modern textbooks, they created their own using the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki â€“ the name of a French general in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nThe Greek origin of the name suited the intended style of a multi-volume work under the heading Elements de mathematique, inspired by the title of Euclid's great work Elements. Following their first meeting in 1934, the Bourbaki group's influence went international, with new volumes of Elements published over the next 50 years. After the World War II, they produced a series of advanced monographs by individual authors based on public lectures in Paris in the Seminaire Bourbaki. Paris was rapidly taking over from Germany as the centre of mathematics.\n\nDuring this time, a brilliant young boy named Alexander, born in Berlin in 1928, was hidden on a farm in northern Germany. His father, Alexander Schapiro, a Russian anarchist, had taken part in the failed 1905 revolution. He lost an arm escaping from prison 10 years later; leaving Russia on forged papers, he reached Berlin in 1922. When the Nazis took power in 1933 Schapiro escaped to France and was later joined by Alexander's mother, Hanka Grothendieck. The two of them joined in the Spanish Civil War. After returning to France in 1939, Schapiro was interned in Camp Vernet in the French Pyrenees, before the Vichy regime handed him over to the Nazis and he disappeared into Auschwitz. That year, Alexander's surrogate parents decided Germany was too dangerous and put him on a train for France where he rejoined his mother, living in various camps for displaced persons.\n\nJourney of rediscovery\n\nLoading..."
