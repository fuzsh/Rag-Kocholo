        "text": "In 2006, The New Yorker published “Manifold Destiny,” an article detailing a mathematical scandal over a proof of the century-old Poincaré Conjecture by the reclusive Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman. Perelman had received the Fields Medal, the most prestigious prize in mathematics, for his 2002 proof of the conjecture, which had taken four years to properly vet. However, in 2006, two students of the mathematician Shing-Tung Yau published a proof of the conjecture which cited Perelman, but claimed that their own proof “should be considered as the crowning achievement of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of Ricci flow.” Yau defended his students’ work as a major accomplishment for Chinese mathematics, and said of Perelman’s argument that “many key ideas of the proofs are sketched or outlined, and complete details are often missing.” Along the way, the article also claimed that Yau and his students had attempted to take credit for a proof by another mathematician, Alexander Givental. According to the New Yorker piece, the two wrote to Givental “explaining that they had found his arguments impossible to follow and his notation baffling, and had come up with a proof of their own,” which they then published. “Manifold Destiny” itself immediately became another piece in the drama: Yau alleged that the article had incorrectly quoted him and misrepresented the situation, proceeding to threaten legal action. The New Yorker ultimately stood by the piece.\n\nControversy over the ownership of a mathematical idea is not foreign to the discipline. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz famously engaged in a battle over who deserved credit for the invention of calculus, with each throwing allegations of plagiarism at the other. Last year, the Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki published an almost 150-page defense of his proof of the long-unsolved abc conjecture, which many mathematicians outside of Japan have disputed. And in the 1930s, a group of French mathematicians fabricated a mathematician named Nicolas Bourbaki, under whose name they enacted a project to perfectly formalize mathematics. The pseudonym acted as something between a prank and political cover, delighting those who were in on the joke while excluding older mathematicians who might resist them.\n\nWhen studying the history and sociology of technical subjects like mathematics, moments of controversy often unveil previously-unarticulated assumptions about how the subject operates. Each of these cases from the history of mathematics involve a disagreement over or ambiguity within mathematical authorship, wherein the relationship between a living mathematician, a text produced by that mathematician, and an abstract result is called into question. They lead us to ask: what is the relationship between a text and a result, especially if the clarity or validity of the text is disputed? What validates a claim to having proved a theorem first? How do we decide if two arguments are actually different? And to what is the mathematician’s name attached—the mathematical theorem, the published text proving the theorem, or something else? Drawing on Michel Foucault’s notion of the “author function” in his article “What is an Author?”, I wish to explore the idea of mathematical authorship. I begin by arguing, contra Foucault, that mathematical authorship is not an arbitrary process of assigning names to results, but a historically and sociologically complex operation reflective of the evolving values and meanings of mathematics itself. I then examine the relationship between the mathematician and the text, and determine that what is at stake in mathematics is not authorship of a text itself, but of a true idea. Finally, I consider what “true” and “idea” really mean. Both the truth of a mathematical idea and the boundaries of the idea itself vary historically and are determined not by an impartial logical process, but by the historically contingent practices of mathematicians.\n\nIn “What is an Author?”, Foucault interrogates the question of authorship, following a line of inquiry opened by Roland Barthes’ 1967 piece “The Death of the Author.” In Foucault’s view, the author serves a “classificatory function” which varies over time and across disciplines. This so-called “author function” tends to attach to a corpus a constancy of value, a requirement of noncontradiction, a stylistic cohesion, and a historical bound and basis for the text based on the author’s lifetime and biography. He discusses a number of scientific examples of author functions, such as how the author in biology provides an “index of ‘reality’ in relation to the techniques and objects of experience made use of in a particular period and in such-and-such a laboratory”—that is, the scientific author grounds the text in a specific scientific paradigm. By contrast, he does not believe that the mathematical author function is particularly noteworthy: “In mathematics,” he writes, “reference to the author is barely anything any longer but a manner of naming theorems or sets of propositions.” Concretely, for Foucault, “Bolzano’s Theorem” would not refer to any relationship between the person Bolzano and the mathematical statement “if a continuous function is sometimes positive and sometimes negative on an interval I, it must be 0 somewhere on I,” but is merely a signifier for the latter.\n\nBut I think there is something more to this question of mathematical authorship than a method of finding convenient names for mathematical concepts. On the most basic level, an attribution can provide a historical glimpse into who proposed an idea or give a hint as to the epoch of mathematics in which the idea originated or could first be formulated. However, there are more subtle ways in which the association of a mathematician’s name to a mathematical idea operates. For instance, the twentieth-century mathematician Alexander Grothendieck was famous for his extreme abstraction. His tools of choice were the newly developed language and (mathematically-)modernist language of category theory, through which he rewrote classical definitions, and his “rising sea” approach to problem solving, which involved building progressively more complex machinery around difficult problems until their solutions appeared straightforward—like, in his own words, a hard nut soaked in water until “the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado!” Consequently, attaching Grothendieck’s name to an object, approach, or theory adds a sort of subtle flavor of abstraction and lateral thinking. Take, for example, the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem. As the mathematician Terence Tao explains, the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem is easily stated in the language of algebra, but is difficult to prove using purely algebraic techniques. Grothendieck’s proof involves a counterintuitive shift to the vastly more abstract—and recently developed—realm of mathematical logic instead; once the shift is made, though, the proof is straightforward. The Ax-Grothendieck Theorem was proved independently by both Ax and Grothendieck and, due to any number of historical quirks, could have easily been called Ax’s Theorem. But in attaching it to Grothendieck’s name, we classify it within the corpus of other Grothendieck-related results, and therefore understand it in terms of the value and stylistic qualities of that corpus. Conversely, in constructing a corpus of Grothendieck theorems in the first place, we build an author function which, like Foucault’s author function, “provides the basis for not explaining the presence of certain events in a work, but also their transformations, distortions, and diverse modifications”—that is, provides an explanation not just for particular historical techniques or definitions, but also for their place in relation to other techniques.\n\nFor the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem, mathematical authorship seems to refer to naming a mathematical concept or approach after a person. But in the various priority disputes discussed above, there is a much more complex interplay between the mathematician, their text, and the abstract idea. These three related-but-distinct concepts raise a number of questions: what, exactly, does the mathematician author? Is it a published text or an abstract theorem? Relatedly, can whatever the mathematician authors be separated from the mathematician? In the literary realm, critics such as Barthes have attempted to move away from the privileged position of the author by instead appealing to the work as the basis for analysis, neatly sidestepping questions of relationality. Foucault critiques this move on two grounds. First, he notes, it is unclear what exactly constitutes the work beyond “what an author has written.” Second, even after one accepts some relationship between the author and the work, it is unclear how exactly the work is bounded. For instance, it is certainly not everything written by an author, as this metric does not distinguish Nietzsche’s laundry lists from his rough drafts—or from a notebook which contains both.\n\nSince mathematics is an a priori domain—in which truth is deduced from first principles—there is something to be said for defining the mathematical “work” to be a proof, or the list of formal manipulations required to achieve a result. Thus mathematics could be thought of as a collection of proofs without regard for those who author them. However, this definition calls into question the status of more marginal mathematical ideas that are not full proofs but still leave their mark on the historical record. Consider, for example, the case of Fermat’s Last Theorem, conjectured by Fermat in 1637, but not solved until 1995 by Andrew Wiles. Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem opens with a quote in Latin from the margins of Fermat’s notebook, wherein he states the theorem and claims to have a proof but writes that it will not fit in the margins: “Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.” Does this margin count as a mathematical work?\n\nOn the one hand, Fermat certainly stated a theorem, an act which was sufficient for us to call the theorem Fermat’s Last Theorem rather than “Wiles’s Theorem.” On the other hand, this statement, published posthumously by his son, was not intended for public consumption and was certainly not the same kind of work as Wiles’s over 100-page proof, in that it did not produce an actual proof. The historians of mathematics Michael Barany and Donald MacKenzie distinguish between two kinds of mathematical texts: mathematical papers, which function similarly to their equivalent in the natural sciences; and the “tentative, transitory marks that try to produce new orders out of old ones” such as blackboard writing and scrap paper, where meaning is located in the moment of writing rather than the record it leaves. This second category of texts is where the real creativity—or, perhaps, work—of mathematics occurs. Encompassing the blackboard lecture as well as the half-scrawled note-to-self, this category is also the location of much of the communication between mathematicians, and thus an integral part of the process by which a piece of mathematics becomes associated with a particular mathematician. If a marginal note that happened to take on historical importance is considered a work, should all such transitory marks? Or, if the margins had been big enough and Fermat had given his proof—which, considering the hundreds of years of algebraic developments needed to formulate Wiles’s approach, would almost certainly have been incorrect—would that be considered a work?\n\nCorrectness is certainly an important part of the process by which the name of a mathematician is attached to a result. Although Fermat’s Last Theorem is named after Fermat, the credit for its proof goes straightforwardly to Wiles. However, this was almost not the case, as Wiles’s initial proof of the theorem had an error, subsequently corrected alongside Richard Taylor over a period of a year. If Wiles had not been able to prove the result, he would have been like the many other mathematicians who had tried to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem and failed. In this example, the text itself is secondary: since the error was localized to one specific application of the Kolyvagin–Flach method, most of the text of his final article could remain the same.\n\nIn a similar vein, mathematicians will know about, say, Banach spaces or Galois theory—often with a considerable understanding of their history and relationship to the person who originally produced them—but will be unable to name the text in which the result originates. It seems, then, that the mathematician is not the author of a text but of an idea, by which I mean a true concept in mathematics (under some sense of the word true—more on this later). I say “idea” rather than “theorem” to account for the variation in the form an idea can take: Banach spaces are a definition; Fermat’s Last Theorem is a statement of a theorem, and Wiles’s proof a formal list of steps; and Galois theory refers to both a specific subdiscipline of mathematics and a genre of correspondence between mathematical objects. When the idea is a theorem, it need not be new at all. Part of the power and novelty of Grothendieck’s work, for instance, was not only its ability to prove new theorems, but also to unify and generalize known ones. To take an example from my own work, a recent research project I worked on was based on a new proof of the homology cobordism classification of lens spaces, a result that had been known since the 1980s but had only recently been expressed in a manner considered elementary. Mathematical ideas go beyond mathematics as a list of known results; they belong to mathematics as a practiced discipline, something continuously produced by real people.\n\nSo, we might call the mathematical author function, in the Foucaultian sense, the process by which the name of a mathematician becomes associated with a true idea. But what is meant by a true idea? Intuitively, a true statement would be a mathematically true one, that is, one which follows from a commonly agreed upon set of axioms. However, this does not hold up under historical scrutiny, as many fields of mathematics have had their foundations entirely rewritten in such a way that rendered their original ideas incorrect. Consider calculus: Newton and Leibniz’s original treatments of calculus used arbitrarily small quantities called infinitesimals, the existence of which they could not justify. Even their contemporaries questioned the validity of infinitesimals—the eighteenth-century mathematician and philosopher George Berkeley famously critiqued them as “the ghosts of departed quantities.” In the nineteenth century, calculus was put on rigorous ground by a new approach that rewrote it to instead concern arbitrarily small but still finite quantities, now known as the modern discipline of mathematical analysis. But nineteenth-century analysis relied on a definition of real numbers, which was only fully formalized in the twentieth century.\n\nPhilosopher of mathematics Imre Lakatos raises this issue in the book Proofs and Refutations, where he notes that a “formalist heaven” of modern rigorous concepts “denies the status of mathematics to most of what has been commonly understood to be mathematics.” Of calculus, he writes, “On those terms Newton had to wait four centuries until [the twentieth century logicians] Peano, Russell, and Quine helped him into heaven by formalising the Calculus.” As Lakatos implicitly highlights, we certainly do not attribute calculus to a group of logicians but to Newton and Leibniz—and have been doing so long before any rigorization was provided. It seems, then, that the mathematical author function does not require an idea to be true (in some transhistorical sense), so much as sufficiently accepted, or at least useful, within its historical context. In other words, regardless of Berkeley’s critiques, calculus could still be the foundation of centuries of mathematics, as well as physics, engineering, and other applied sciences. Like the mathematical idea, truth also belongs to the domain of mathematical practice.\n\nHowever, just as the notion of mathematical truth is historically unstable, so too is the idea to which a mathematician’s name is attached. Consider, for example, the case of Galois theory. Galois theory is named for the mathematician Evariste Galois, who, in 1832, proposed a theory of the relationship between a polynomial equation and the permutations of its roots. In the modern language of abstract algebra, Galois’ ideas form the basis for a statement about the relationship between a field extension, a complicated algebraic object, and its automorphism group, a simpler algebraic object. This statement is termed the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, although none of the objects it references had been defined in Galois’ lifetime. The generalization from the Galois theory of the mathematician Evariste Galois to modern-day Galois theory straightforwardly recast Galois’ initial methods in modernized language. However, as mathematicians Francis Borceux and George Janelidze demonstrate in their book Galois Theories, in the twentieth century the notion of Galois theory was generalized to encompass topics far outside the purview of Galois’ initial concept. Along the way, certain Galois theories did pick up other names—for instance, a generalization due to Grothendieck is frequently referred to as “Grothendieck’s Galois theory” or “the Galois theory of Grothendieck”—but the term “Galois” remains.\n\nIn the view of Borceux and Janelidze, what unifies these theories is the mathematical fact that every “Galois theory” is an example of a single abstract result in category theory, which they term the Categorical Galois Theorem. But conflating the Galois author function with the Categorical Galois Theorem ignores the fact that the term “Galois theory” long predates Janelidze’s statement of the theorem in the 1980s. Foucault terms figures such as Galois “founder[s] of a science.” Like a “founder of a discourse”—such as Marx or Freud—the texts of a founder of a science produce “the possibilities and the rules for the formation of other texts.” In other words, they make possible “not only a certain number of analogies but also (and equally important) a certain number of differences” from the original text. But for a founder of a discourse, their text continues to generate the discourse in perpetuity; consequently, reexamining the work of Freud changes psychoanalysis itself. On the other hand, founders of a science are subsumed into their discourses. Reexamining the work of Georges Cuvier does not change biology, as the subject has moved on. Galois, like Cuvier, has been subsumed into his own discourse: although his work established the foundations for and limits the nature of Galois theory, it is no longer the center of the modern system of Galois theory itself. But nor, for that matter, is the Categorical Galois Theorem—the term “Galois connection” is also employed in reference to a sort of correspondence that is more general than the Categorical Galois Theorem, but lacks its depth and richness of structure.\n\nThus, the mathematical author is not, as Foucault claimed, merely “a manner of naming theorems or sets of propositions.” Instead, just as the Foucaultian author serves the “classificatory function” of grouping together texts, the mathematical author groups together mathematical ideas. These ideas transcend the precise texts in which they are written. But, as the example of calculus shows us, they need not be truths that follow from modern axiom systems, only concepts or methods that were true or useful by the standards of the time in which they originate. Along the way, the grouping-together-of-ideas by the author function can produce a sort of mathematical post hoc justification for the grouping, as the Categorical Galois Theorem produced a mathematical explanation for what unified various Galois-associated theories. Crucially, although there is a coherence to these groupings, they are also a product of historical contingencies in mathematical practice, rather than some transhistorical and irrefutable logic.\n\nPut another way, in the dispute of the Poincaré Conjecture, the stakes go beyond personal disagreements over whether Perelman’s proof was actually missing details or if Yau’s students stole credit. If the result is remembered as Perelman’s, it will be situated with Perelman’s approach of big ideas; if it is Cao and Zhu’s, it will be remembered by their careful and rigorous approach. Each association—and, indeed, “Manifold Destiny” itself—provides a coherent way of situating the result in the historical development of mathematics."
