        "text": "The Many Faces of Nicolas Bourbaki\n\nThe French Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) has a tradition for pranks. One such prank was a fake lecture given in 1923 to the 21 entering students (including Paul Dubreil and future Bourbakists Henri Cartan, Jean Coulomb and René de Possel) by Raoul Husson (1901-1967, ENS 1921) an older peer wearing a false beard to impersonate a distinguished venerable mathematician billed as \"professeur Holmgren\".\n\nThe lecture presented a series of fake results from fictional mathematicians named after famous French generals, culminating in Bourbaki's theorem (named after General Charles Bourbaki, 1816-1897). That's how some future ENS alumni took note of the Bourbaki name.\n\nAccording to André Weil (1992) the moniker Nicolas was picked by his future wife Eveline de Possel, who was then still married to fellow founder René de Possel (1905-1974).\n\nOne of the most famous mathematics textbooks of all time was Cours d'analyse mathématique by Edouard Goursat (1858-1936; ENS 1876). The first edition was published in two volumes (1902,1905). The second edition was published in three volumes (1910-1913) which were later updated once or twice (most recently in 1924, 1925 and 1923, respectively).\n\nGoursat is credited to be the first person who noticed how Stokes' theorem could be very beautifully generalized using differential forms, as shown below.\n\nStokes' theorem actually generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus. It was first proved by Poincaré (1899) well before Georges de Rham (1903-1990) put forth a conceptual frame (1931). The need for a full elucidation was such a key preoccupation of some Bourbaki founders that it's not an exaggeration to state that Nicolas Bourbaki and this general result are significantly due to each other...\n\nòW dw = ò¶W w\n\nSome Incarnations of Stokes' Theorem Gradient Conservativity\n\nò b\n\na grad f . dM = f(b) - f(a)\n\nKelvin-Stokes' Formula òòS rot U . dS = òC U . dM Ostrogradsky's Theorem òòòV div U dV = òòS U . dS\n\nThe birthdate usually quoted for the group which would become known as Nicolas Bourbaki is the date of their second formal meeting (1935-01-14). They had already met one month earlier (1934-12-10) and several other preliminary meetings had not been formally recorded at all. The prospective founders were talented young French mathematicians who were all alumni from ENS, with the sole exception of Szolem Mandelbrojt (1899-1983).\n\nThe first Congrès Bourbaki took place from 10 to 20 July 1935 at the Station biologique universitaire in the medieval city of Besse in central France (called Beça in Occitan) which was recognized as a free town in may 1270 and officially named Besse-en-Chandesse between 1961-04-02 and 1973-07-01, when it merged with Saint-Anastaise to become part of Besse-et-Saint-Anastaise. The name Besse-en-Chandesse is still used on some road signs, road maps and touristic guides. It's where the ski resort marketed as Super Besse is located. On 2003-07-12, a plaque was unveiled outside the building housing the meeting room identifying it as the birthplace of Nicolas Bourbaki. That event followed a conference by Christian Houzel, attended by a crowd of about 120 mathematicians. It was the brainchild of Paul-Louis Hennequin (Ulm, 1949) on behalf of the mathematical department of the Blaise Pascal University which had been owning the building since 1901. Hennequin is the son of Aimé Hennequin, from Taupe Laplace.\n\nTheir initial ambition was to put together (within six months) a much-needed Analysis textbook to replace Goursat's Cours d'Analyse. They already had a preliminary agreement with Hermann to publish it.\n\nAs André Weil would later recall, one key point was the aforementioned urge to elucidate the general validity of the above formula (Stokes Theorem) which unifies great results of vector calculus. However, that sparked a search for rigorous settings which would delay by many years the publication of the final presentation by Bourbaki of that particular topic...\n\nEventually, they ended up putting on a fresh solid foundation the entire mathematical knowledge of their time. This took the form of a collection of books entitled Eléments de Mathématique (note the militant use of the grammatically incorrect singular form of mathématiques).\n\nThe Bourbaki collaboration has been extremely influential in France and elsewhere. Bourbaki brought about new rigor based on the logical foundations of mathematics (along the way, they also became instrumental in some controversial reforms of mathematical education, dubiously known as New Math in the US).\n\nThis can be traced to a 1952 meeting (in Melun, France) between Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980), Bourbakist Jean Dieudonné (1906-1992) and two other leading mathematicians concerned with education reform, Gustave Choquet (1915-2006) and André Lichnerowicz (1915-1998).\n\nThe active founding members of the Nicolas Bourbaki&nbsp group were:\n\nHenri Cartan (1904-2008; ENS 1923), son of the geometer Elie Cartan .\n\nClaude Chevalley (1909-1984; ENS 1926).\n\nJean Delsarte (1903-1968; ENS 1922).\n\nJean Alexandre Eugène Dieudonné (1906-1992; ENS 1924).\n\nAndré Weil (1906-1998; ENS 1922).\n\nThe official list of founders includes four members who were less active, namely:\n\nThe geophysicist Jean Coulomb (1904-1999; ENS 1923) who left in 1937.\n\nCharles Ehresmann (1905-1979; ENS 1924) who left in 1950 .\n\nRené de Possel (1905-1974; ENS 1923).\n\nSzolem Mandelbrojt (1899-1983) who left in 1939.\n\nSzolem Mandelbrojt was the uncle and early mentor of the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2010; X1944) of fractal fame.\n\nTwo other mathematicians had been present at preliminary meetings, before the actual foundation of the Bourbaki group:\n\nJean Leray (1906-1998; ENS 1926)\n\nPaul Dubreil (1904-1994; ENS 1923)\n\nThus, the number of Bourbaki founders can be argued to be 5, 9 or 11.\n\nOther noted bourbakists, who joined the group later, include:\n\nCharles Pisot (1910-1984; ENS 1929).\n\nClaude Chabauty (1910-1990; ; ENS 1929).\n\nFrédéric Roger (1910-1984; ENS 1930).

[Current member?]\n\nThe guideline is that all members should retire from the group at the age of 50 (Grothendieck and Lang left early, in anger). Almost all of the above are retired.\n\nIt was never a strict rule, but the level of enforcement is difficult to evaluate because the exact duration of a member's tenure was rarely made public. Samuel Eilenberg (1913-1988) prophet of Category theory, retired at 53.\n\nRumor has it that a coconutization procedure was used, inspired by an urban legend about tropical tribes: When the fitness of the chief is questioned, he has to climb on top of a coconut tree and the whole tribe attempts to shake him down. If he doesn't fall, then he's deemed to be still fit for his functions.\n\nThe mathematical counterpart of that is to throw some utter nonsense during a meeting. If the unsuspecting target of the coconutization fails to detect it, then the age-rule will be enforced and he won't get invited to the next meeting. Nobody has to be rude about it (kinda). This was told by Vladimur Arnold (1937-2010) of KAM fame, who was never a Bourbakist himself. I heard the same story from a good friend who's a former classmate of Alain Connes.\n\nThe semi-mandatory retirement rule was instigated by Weil as the founding members were near the critical age: A letter from him proposing a gradual disappearance of the founding members was read by Cartan during the Summer conference of 1956, at the end of a lunch for Dieudonné's fiftieth Birthday (1956-07-01). It was a drastic way to incite the more recent members to take on full responsibility. A necessary condition for the group's planned immortality.\n\nAccording to Jean Dieudonné (interviewed on 1987-06-12) one of the motivations for the age rule was that many mathematicians seem overly enamored with what they learned when they were young. The founders wanted the group to remain forever receptive to new ideas.\n\nRetired members were not entirely cut off from active members as they continued to receive the internal newsletter La Tribu (The Tribe) containing the proceedings of the meetings. (Tribe is what the original group liked to call itself.)\n\nPierre Cartier said that, during his own tenure from 1955 to 1983, the Bourbaki group was holding three yearly meetings (for a total of about one month per year).\n\nPart of the preliminary recruitment of new Bourbaki members was to invite them to one of those meetings. Sir Michael Atiyah went to a single meeting as a prospect but decided he didn't like the Bourbaki working style. Only one person who was not formally a member of Bourbaki ever took part in writing up pieces which were eventually published under the Bourbaki name (after many revision by several members, as usual): Paul-André Meyer (1934-2003; ENS 1954). This case is so unique that some notorious Bourbaki members thought he had been formally inducted, but this ain't so (video).\n\nThe (nonprofit) Association formally incorporated in 1952 seems alive and well, although it's not nearly as active and/or influential as it once was. At one point, there were concerns that the volumes published in 1983 and 1998 would be the last ones of the collection. However, one major update was published in 2016.\n\nTwo Glitches in the Popularity of Nicolas Bourbaki\n\nAt this writing (2018-12-08) this page consistently ranks in Google's top page for queries related to Nicolas Bourbaki. Its average rank has been 6.3 over the last three months spanned by the plot below, where the light-blue curve (scale at right) indicates the number of daily impressions of whatever Google result-page (usually the top one) mentions the page you're now reading. The dark-blue curve (scale at left) gives the number of daily visits our page received from Google.\n\nThe latter closely follows the former, with noise due to the varying location within Google's search results (on most days, our rank was between 5 and 8).\n\nEither curve is a good way to monitor the number of enquiries about Bourbaki in Google. That was less than 100 per day before the incident diagnosed below, which caused a hundredfold peak (and a tenfold increase in the aftermath).\n\nWhatever happened in late September (see below) caused the peak of 11836 impressions observed on Sunday, October 4, 2018 (157 visits to the page you're reading, whose average position was 5.6 that day). At first, I had hoped this had been the result of some nice mathematical online discussion. Not so. It turns out that the name of Nicolas Bourbaki was just used by songwriter Tyler Joseph (1988-) in the third track (entitled Morph) of the Trench album officially released on October 5, 2018 by his Twenty Øne Piløts band/duo.\n\nTyler's rap lyrics just pertain to his so-called Dema dreamworld, haunted by bishops he named André [Weil?] and Nico. He had previously called the latter Blurryface before identifying him as Nicolas Bourbaki. The Twenty Øne Piløts publicity campaign spread doctored bits of iconography from the original Bourbaki tribe to send fans on a wild-goose chase, which they seem to enjoy.\n\nIn the wake of the above, one such fan produced the following two videos, which are tedious to watch for those of us who aren't interested in Tyler's ramblings. At least, this lady can boast some of the scientific training which Tyler lacks.\n\nHow Bourbaki Connects to Trench / Twenty Øne Piløts (2018-09-18).\n\nBourbaki Meaning in Morph/Trench by Twenty Øne Piløts (2018-10-24).\n\nNearly two years later (July 2020) the effectivenes of this page to monitor Bourbaki-related Google searches was hampered by an average rank of 9.4, which no longer puts it consistently on the first page (top 10) thus missing a majority of those searches. That was still good enough to detect another glitch:\n\nOn Sunday July 5, 2020, the observed number of Bourbaki queries was only 112 (the actual number is probably three times larger, for the aforementioned reason). The next day (Monday, July 6) this rose to 6683. Then 7188 on Tuesday, 2219 on Wednesday, 2206 on Thursday, 1789 on Friday, 1348 on Saturday, 1104 on Sunday, 988 on Monday July 13. 248 a week later. 242 after another week (stabilizing to about 150% of the pre-peak level thereafter). So, what happened on July 6?\n\nWell, that's the day a well-meaning animated video was released on YouTube:\n\nThe greatest mathematician that never lived (5:12) by Pratik Aghor (TED Ed).\n\nThe echoes were perfunctory, resembling one by Steven Pomeroy (2020-07-07).\n\nNot Even Bullshit by Joachim I, Krueger, Brown University (Psychology Today, 2015-12-06)."
