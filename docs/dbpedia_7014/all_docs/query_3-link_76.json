        "text": "Alexander Grothendieck was revered for revealing connections between seemingly unrelated realms. Then he dropped out of society.\n\nBy Rivka Galchen, May 9, 2022\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/...isappearance-of-a-revolutionary-mathematician\n\nI've seen the name of Grothendieck mentioned various threads, but I didn't know much about him. Truly amazing and sad story.\n\nGrothendieck’s work also survives as the structure in which much of math happens today. When Fermat’s Last Theorem was proved, by Andrew Wiles, in 1994, Grothendieck’s contributions to algebraic geometry were essential. Ravi Vakil said, “Whole fields of mathematics speak the language that he set up. We live in this big structure that he built. We take it for granted—the architect is gone.”\n\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/alexander-grothendieck-is-no-longer-with-us.781945/\n\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threa...nd-grothendiecks-standard-conjectures.242483/\n\nGrothendieck is definitely one of the greatest mathematicians of the last century.\n\n\"Discovery is the privilege of the child: the child who has no fear of being once again wrong, of looking like an idiot, of not being serious, of not doing things like everyone else.\" ~ Alexander Grothendieck\n\nSad is a matter of viewpoint. Unusual, sure, but sad?\n\nIn an almost 600-page \"letter\" (Pursuing stacks, A la poursuite des champs, 1983) to Daniel Gray Quillen, who was involved in developing the K-theory initiated by Grothendieck, he showed interest in his theory of higher categories (his book Homotopical algebra from 1967), on the basis of which he also saw a new basis for topology (including his own vision of a generalization from the 1960s, the topos theory).\n\nAll in all, another example from the chapter: Genius and Madness.\n\nfresh_42 said:\n\nSad is a matter of viewpoint. Unusual, sure, but sad?\n\nYes, I'd would consider sad as in separation from parents, loss of father, abandonment of his wife and children, and then abandonment of a son by another woman.\n\nShortly after Grothendieck’s reunion with his parents, whom he hadn’t seen in six years, Sascha was sent to an internment camp outside the city. (He later died in Auschwitz.) The mother and child were sent to Rieucros, a camp in the south.\n\nthen at the end of the article\n\nGrothendieck shed or burned most of his meagre possessions, but even at the end of his life he still had a painting that had been made of his father in the internment camp.\n\nIn the middle of the article:\n\nn 1970, Grothendieck abruptly left. He left the I.H.E.S., he left the twelve to sixteen hours a day of thinking about math, he left his wife and his three children.\n\nand later\n\nHe began dating a mathematician, Justine Skalba, whom he had met at a talk at Rutgers; soon afterward, she agreed to leave her studies and follow him. The commune, founded with friends, started with only four people, but others came and went, and sometimes meetings were held on Survivre issues which attracted up to a hundred people. Grothendieck sold sea salt and organic vegetables, but others called him “the bank,” because he was the source of all cash. The commune fell apart within a year. Skalba had a child. By the time the child, John, was two months old, she had left Grothendieck; John grew up having almost no relationship with his father and went on to study math at Harvard . . .\n\nSo, I would consider that sad, at least for the people he abandoned, despite his considerable accomplishments."
