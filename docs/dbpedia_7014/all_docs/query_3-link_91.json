        "text": "He was born in 1928, first name: Alexander. His father was a Russian anarchist, Alexander (Sascha) Shapiro, who had participated in the failed Russian Revolution of 1905, and his mother was a Protestant journalist, Hanka Grothendieck. They lived in Berlin, and since it was dangerous for a Jew to be identifiable as such in Germany, the young Alexander took his mother’s last name.\n\nHis mom and dad were revolutionaries in the true sense of the word, fighting together in a variety of wars, including the Spanish Civil War, as part of the International Brigades. Alexander had, therefore, an odd childhood – first spending years in a foster home with a Protestant pastor, and then finally reunited with his mom. Those were years filled with anti-Semitism hatred, and eventually, in 1942, his father was delivered to the Nazis by the Vichy government and deported to Auschwitz, where he died only two days after his arrival at the concentration camp.\n\nThe fact that Alexander Grothendieck escaped death turned out to be an event that changed the history of modern science, as he became the greatest mathematician of the 20th century (and certainly one of the greatest mathematicians ever).\n\nGrothendieck’s mathematical work is described in detail in a variety of specialized journals, but the thing that always struck me about his mathematics was the fact that his interest lay in redesigning the entire mathematical world into a unified, integrated edifice. It has been said that there are two kinds of mathematicians: the problem solvers, whose passion lies in solving great and difficult problems (the famous Erdos is certainly the best-known example), and those who want to build large-scale theories. Grothendieck was, in no uncertain terms, a mathematician of this second kind. In order to do so, like many other mathematicians before him, he wanted to grasp the notion of space, and indeed (as silly as this may appear to a non-mathematical reader), he did so by redefining (in an incredibly deep and profound way) the notion of point!\n\nI first learned about his work when I was a junior in college at the University of Milano and took a class on mathematical logic. My teacher was a young, charismatic professor, Giancarlo Meloni, who first opened the door for me and my classmates to Grothendieck’s intricate theory of schemes and topos. While I have sat in thousands of classes, I have never felt again the same kind of excitement that Meloni’s lectures gave me, as we took our first steps in what I can only call a mathematical paradise. Not only was the theory beautiful, but for the first time I felt that all the disparate areas of mathematics could be subsumed under one common roof: the unity to which I aspired, as a young mathematician, was being delivered by the work of Grothendieck.\n\nWhen I heard of Grothendieck’s passing this past Nov. 13, I was immediately catapulted back to this class at the University of Milano, with both a sense of gratitude for what I had experienced and a sense of longing for a period during which every day was bringing a new discovery.\n\nBut Grothendieck was more than simply the greatest mathematician of his time; he was a man of strong convictions and an active and convinced pacifist. As an activist, he demonstrated with equal energy against the American intervention in Vietnam (by actually traveling to Hanoi, and teaching mathematics in the jungle to young Viet Cong), as well as against the Soviet Union’s militaristic society.\n\nIn 1966, he received the Fields Medal (the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for mathematicians), but he turned it down because, in protest, he refused to travel to Moscow, where the award was going to be given, during the International Congress of Mathematicians.\n\nIn 1970, he abandoned mathematics because of his concern for the way in which science was and is used to military purposes. The same uncompromising approach that he took in mathematics, he was now taking in this second part of his life, where he devoted himself to pacifism (in the tradition of other great scientists like Einstein and Pauling) and to radical ecologism.\n\nHis last few years were not easy, as he was possibly fighting mental illness and living in isolation as a hermit. But we like to remember him smiling at the blackboard, explaining his new world to his colleagues, as captured in a very famous black-and-white photo from his early years in France. As we look at his deep eyes, he seems to remind us of his lasting legacy: an example of what can be accomplished as a mathematician but also a reminder of the social responsibility that scientists have."
