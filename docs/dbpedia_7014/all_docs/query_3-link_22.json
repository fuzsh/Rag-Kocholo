Apart from this he is also known for his works in number theory and topology.\n\nContribution in mathematics\n\nAlgebra\n\nAlgebraic geometry is a branch of algebra. In This geometry is based on the different algebraic techniques. Alexander is known to make significant changes in it. Thus he is known worldwide for renewing algebraic geometry.\n\nApart from this, Grothendieck is also known for his contribution in topology and number theory.\n\nBooks written by Grothendieck Alexander\n\nElements de geometrie : algebrique\n\nThe grothendieck festschrift\n\nThe tame fundamental group of a formal neighborhood of a divisor with normal crossings on a scheme\n\nA general theory of fibre spaces with structure sheaf\n\nLocal cohomology : a seminar\n\nPolitics\n\nPolitically Alexander is not with both the american or capitalists and soviets or socialists thoughts. He was a pacifist. In 1970 he formed a political party with two other mathematicians Claude Chevalley and Pierre samuel.
