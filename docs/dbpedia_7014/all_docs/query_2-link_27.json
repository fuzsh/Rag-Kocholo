        "text": "Since this question has not been answered, I have decided to expand my comment. A well documented construction allows one to associate a generalised space of distributions to each unbounded self-adjoint operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $H$. It is motivated by the elementary and axiomatic approach of the portuguese mathematician J. Sebastião e Silva who showed that one can correct the basic “fault” of the differential operator on spaces of continuous functions by embedding them (in a unique manner) into larger superspaces on which it is everywhere defined. These are the Schwartzian distributions. In the general situation described above, a simple construction shows we can embed $H$ in a (in a suitable sense) unique manner into a vector space $H^{-\\infty}$ on which $T$ is everywhere defined. If we choose for $T$ any of the classical self-adjoint differential operators, we obtain a unified approach to many known, but also many new, spaces of distribution, including those introduced by Schwartz. We can also vary the construction in simple ways to obtain other variants, including some which involve differential operators of infinite order.\n\nThe space $H^{-\\infty}$ has a natural lc structure of a well-studied type (as the inductive limit of a sequence of Banach spaces with weakly compact linking mappings—Komatsu). If $T$ has a discrete spectrum and its sequence $(\\lambda_n)$ of eigenvalues converges to infinity (i.e., it is genuinely unbounded), then it is a Silva space (defined as above but with compact links). Finally, if $(|\\lambda_n|^\\alpha)$ is summable for some negative $\\alpha$, then it is nuclear, with all resulting benefits. This latter condition is fulfilled if the eigenvalues are asymptotically like a positive power of $n$ as is the case for most of the classical differential operators which are relevant here.\n\nReferences as requested:\n\nKomatsu spaces: Projective and injective limits of weakly compact sequences of locally convex spaces, J.

Mat. e Appl. 14 (1955), 388-410.

(1975), 257-284. This contains the criterion for nuclearity.\n\nYou can then construct ready made distribution spaces by consulting the long tradition of computing the spectral properties of the classical self-adjoint differential operators, a tradition which goes back to Fourier, Thomson and Tait. For the Sturm-Liouville operators, you could use the good old Courant and Hilbert. A more modern treatment with emphasis on connections with functional analysis is in Triebel’s “Höhere Analysis”.\n\nFor the spectral properties required for distributions on manifolds, see Berger et al, “Le Spectre d’une Variété Riemannienne”. Corresponding results for Schrödinger operators have been investigated by Barry Simon amongst others."
