This document provides a biography of renowned mathematician Alexander Grothendieck. It discusses his difficult childhood, with a father who was imprisoned for revolutionary activities and later disappeared in Auschwitz, and a mother who struggled to provide for him. Grothendieck showed early mathematical talent and reconstructed the Lebesgue integral on his own as an undergraduate. He went on to make revolutionary contributions to algebraic geometry before withdrawing from mathematics and publishing a lengthy introspective work. The document provides context for Grothendieck's remarkable career and personality.",
