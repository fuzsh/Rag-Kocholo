        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt is superfluous to introduce Alexander Grothendieck to mathematicians: he is recognized as one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century. For other audiences, however, it is important to explain that Grothendieck is much more than his rather sulphurous reputation, that of a man in a state of rupture, committing what one could call the suicide of his work, or at any rate consciously destroying the scientific school that he had created. What I want to discuss here are the interactions between his scientific work and his extraordinary personality. Grothendieck’s story is not absolutely unique in the history of science; one may think of Ludwig Boltzmann for example. But there are essential differences: Boltzmann’s work was rejected by the scientific community of his time and remained unrecognized until after his death, whereas Grothendieck’s scientific work was immediately and enthusiastically accepted in spite of its innovative nature, and developed and continued by top-notch collaborators. The path traveled by Grothendieck appears different to me: a childhood devastated by the effect of Nazi crimes, an absent father who soon perished in the torments of the time, a mother who held her son in thrall and permanently affected his relationship with other women; all of this compensated for by an unlimited investment in mathematical abstraction, until psychosis could no longer be held off and came to drown him in the anguish of death — his own and the world’s.\n\nThe case of Georg Cantor is an intermediate one, which has been beautifully analysed by Nathalie Charraud. After encountering violent opposition to his ideas, the support of great mathematicians such as Dedekind and Hilbert allowed him to reach an apotheosis at the International Congress of Mathematicians1 in 1900 in Paris. The French school of analysis, from Poincaré to Borel, Baire and Lebesgue, was converted with enthusiasm to Cantor’s ideas. Cantor’s ultimate mental shipwreck may perhaps be attributed to the “Nobel syndrome”, by which term I mean a type of depression which has been observed to occur in certain Nobel prize winners. Incapable of confronting their own individuality and the life that remains before them — especially when the prize has been attributed at a young age — with the world-renowned public figure they have now become, they fear that they have already given the best of themselves and will never again be able to reach the same height. There is an echo of self mockery in this feeling.\n\nThe typology of Grothendieck is incredibly complex. Like Gauss, Riemann, and so many other mathematicians, his major obsession was with the idea of space. But Grothendieck’s originality was to deepen the idea of a geometric point. As futile as such research might appear, it is nevertheless of considerable metaphysical importance, and the philosophical problems related to it are far from entirely solved. But what kind of intimate concerns, what secret fears are indicated by this obsession with the point? The ultimate form of this research, that of which Grothendieck was proudest, was that concerning the concept of a “motive”, considered as a beam of light illuminating all the incarnations of a given object in its various guises. But this is also the point at which his work became unfinished: a dream rather than an actual mathematical creation, contrarily to everything else I will describe below in his mathematical work.\n\nThus, his work eventually opened onto an abyss. But Grothendieck’s other originality is that of fully accepting this. Most scientists are careful to efface their footprints on the sand and to silence their fantasies and dreams, in order to construct their own inner statue, in the words of Francois Jacob. André Weil was typical in this: he left behind a perfectly finished product in the classical style, in two movements: his Scientific Works, recently graced by a compelling Commentary written by himself, and a fascinating but carefully filtered autobiography, Memories of an Apprenticeship, in which the effects of privacy and self-censorship are veiled by the appearance of a smooth and carefree tale.\n\nGrothendieck played at a different game, nearer to Rousseau’s Confessions. From the depths of his self-imposed retreat, of now nearly ten years – which it would be indecent to attempt to force – he sent us a vast introspective work: Récoltes et Semailles. I will make use of this confession to try to clarify some of the main features of his work. But let us not fool ourselves: Grothendieck reveals himself in all his nakedness, exactly as he appears to himself, but there are clear signs of well-developed paranoia, and only a subtle analysis could reveal all the partly unconscious blockages and silences. The existence of Récoltes et Semailles aroused a somewhat unhealthy curiosity in the eyes of a certain public, akin to the sectarian devotion to a guru, an imaginary White Prince. For myself, I will stick to an analysis of the work and of the biography of the author, remaining as rational and honest as possible, before letting Récoltes et Semailles illuminate this exceptional body of work from within."
