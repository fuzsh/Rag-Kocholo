        "text": "The voice of John von Neumann dedicating the NORC computer in 1954 (short excerpt and full speech).\n\n(source: washington.edu)\n\nThe wire recording is a bit murky; here is my best-effort transcript of the short excerpt:\n\n\"Those of you present who have lived with this field, and who have lived with and suffered with computing machines of various sorts, and know what kind of regime it is to invest in one, I'm sure have appreciated the fact that it appears that this machine has been completely assembled less than two months ago, has been run on problems less than two weeks ago, and yesterday already ran for four hours without making a mistake. Those of you who have not been exposed to computing machines, and who do not have the desolate feeling which goes with living with their mistakes, will appreciate what it means that a computing machine, after about two weeks of breaking in, has really a faultless run of four hours. It is completely fantastic on an object of this size; I doubt it has ever been achieved before, and it is an enormous reassurance regarding the state of the art and regarding the complexities to which one will be able to go in the future, that this has been achieved.\"\n\nHere is the BibTeX reference to a printed version (which differs slightly from the speech).\n\n@incollection{vonNeumann:54, Author = {J. von Neumann}, Booktitle = {John von Neumann Collected Works}, Editor = {A. H. Taub}, Publisher = {Pergamon Press}, Title = {The N.O.R.C.~and Problems in High Speed Computing}, Volume = {5}, Year = 1954, Pages = 238--247}\n\nAddendum: Are there any videos or audio excerpts of any talks given by Grothendieck which are available anywhere? I'd be grateful if anyone could post any such links. Thanks in advance.\n\nActually, several lecture courses by Grothendieck have been recorded but afaik not available online. Maybe you can make a FOI request if you are really interested---the copyright is by University of Buffalo so hopefully subject to Freedom of Information Act.\n\nHere is a reference: http://www.archmathsci.org/catalogue/general-chronology-of-recordings-since-1973/chronology-of-recordings-1973-1980/1973-recordings/\n\n1973 Recordings Lecture Courses by Alexandre GROTHENDIECK 3 Lecture Courses on respectively\n\nAlgebraic Geometry\n\nThe Theory of Algebraic Groups\n\nTopos Theory\n\n( The copyright of all these recordings is that of the Department of Mathematics of SUNY at Buffalo )\n\nEdit\n\nNow you can find the audio in the section 1973 of the webpage Thèmes pour une harmonie (work in progress!), or on YouTube.\n\nAnother place you can watch Bertrand Russell is in Aman (1967), to my knowledge the unique appearance of a mathematician in a Bollywood film. The relevant part is here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGqLXOFFlqo ,\n\nin which Russell talks with a medical student who is proposing to do research on atom bomb survivors in Japan.\n\n(The Hindi voiceover during the interview just repeats what they're saying in English. In the 30 seconds before Russell appears, the dialogue roughly translates as \"A letter from Bertrand Russell! Gee whiz!\"\n\nEdit: The above video seems to be private, the link below works:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BilHsf4FcG8\n\nHere are some videos of French mathematicians :\n\nAndré Lichnerowicz, speaking about mathematical structures in 1966 : http://www.ina.fr/economie-et-societe/education-et-enseignement/video/I00002874/andre-lichnerowicz-sur-les-mathematiques.fr.html\n\nLaurent Schwartz, speaking about the student contestations in France in May 1968 : http://www.ina.fr/politique/gouvernements/video/I00005058/le-professeur-laurent-schwartz.fr.html\n\nThere is also a video tape of an interview of Laurent Schwartz made by the École polytechnique in 1995 (it is not available online but can be purchased here). It contains, among others, a short video extract from a lecture he gave (long ago) to the Polytechnique students. His enthusiast lecturing style is remembered by many, if not all, students from these times.\n\nFinally, the following audio file contains an interview of the probabilist Paul Lévy (1886-1971) made by the French radio \"France Culture\" in 1971 : http://www.jehps.net/Juin2006/levy.mp3\n\nI found the video recording of The Atle Selberg Memorial which was held at the IAS a few years back. There is an \"archival clip\" of Selberg at the IAS included in the same page. This may be the same video which others have already posted. I apologize if it is. Nevertheless, the video recording of the memorial should be of interest.\n\nAlso, here is an interview (in PDF format) of his wherein he discusses the dispute arising from the Prime Number Theorem and his trace formula among other things. It makes for a very good reading over a cup of steaming hot coffee."
