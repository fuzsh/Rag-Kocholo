        "text": "Surely the step from numbers to groups and fields (which is due mostly to 19th-century mathematicians such as Abel, Galois and Dedekind) must count as one one of the greatest leaps forward in history.\n\nMuch of what was already known about numbers was quickly reproven for abstract algebraic structures – and thus for an infinite number of concrete structures with sheer limitless applications.\n\nMy 5 cents in favor of category theory by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane.\n\nNot only did it provide a unifying language for very diverse groups of objects/relations, it was the first (to my very limited knowledge) abstract theory to put the emphasis on morphisms preserving structure (rather than structures themselves), and it paved the way to Grothendieck's Topos theory.\n\nAlso, at first sight it can seem quite over-abstract and pointless (see for instance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense), which makes its power even more surprising.\n\nEdit: I also need to include Laurent Schwartz for his theory of distributions, which (at least in common terms) are generalizations of $L^1$ functions and Radon measures. The theory finally gave a proper context to write things like $H' = \\delta$ (with $H$ the Heavyside function and $\\delta$ the Dirac \"function\"). Anecdotally, it helped me understand the point of taking the smallest possible set (here test functions) to build the largest possible dual space.\n\nI would have to say the invention of set theory by Cantor. At first, there was a huge amount of resistance to it, which, if anything, is a very good measure of how big of a leap it was at the time. Grothendieck, in the introduction to EGA, says:\n\n«Il sera sans doute difficile au mathématicien, dans l’avenir, de se dérober à ce nouvel effort d’abstraction, peut-être assez minime, somme toute, en comparaison de celui, fourni par nos pères, se familiarisant avec la théorie des ensembles. »\n\nI am always impressed by mathematicians who were able to make statements beyond our everyday experience, which is shaped by the mostly finite physical world, especially when going from the finite to the infinite, like\n\nthe folks who went from ten fingers to larger numbers\n\nArchimedes approximating the area of a circle with $n$-polygons\n\nEuclid proofing the existence of infinite many prime numbers\n\nthe mathematicians who came up with infinite sequences, sums, products and continued fractions\n\nCantor finding different levels of infinity\n\nthe mathematicians who extended finite dimensional vector spaces to infinite function spaces\n\nI am not sure if that is rather extension than generalisation, but in these cases the domain of existing concepts were extended.\n\nI'd like to introduce my favorite example by citing a question I found in an email in the net:\n\nWhen I asked many people what is the most difficult areas of math to understand, and also what is the most important unsolved mathematical problem, they always responded with two words: Langlands Conjecture (or Langlands philosophy or Langlands Program).\n\nIn this email we can also read from [email protected] (Tal Kubo):\n\nThe Langlands program is a system of conjectures connecting number theory and the representation theory of Lie groups.\n\nIt predicts that a large class of the $\\zeta$- and $L$-functions coming from number theory and algebraic geometry coincide with $L$-functions coming from representation theory.\n\n$L$-functions have been used for over a century in number theory; Langlands isolated the correct analogue from representation theory (so-called \"automorphic\" $L$-functions) and was the first to understand the general picture.\n\nAs an example of why one might expect some sort of connection between Lie groups and number theory, consider the Galois group $$G = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$$ where $K$ is an algebraic closure of a number field $L$.\n\nNumber theorists are very interested in representations of $K$. $G$ is a profinite group (projective limit of finite groups). Representation theory of profinite groups is not so well-developed but there is at least one situation where there is some hope: algebraic groups over p-adic rings. Lie groups over p-adic fields turn out to be prominent actors in Langlands' conjectures.\n\nAll these theories are (of course) far beyond my knowledge. But I'm deeply fascinated about it.\n\nHere's a (so-called) elementary introduction and an interesting page with refs. You might also find some interesting posts about the Langlands conjecture in math overflow.\n\nTo get a quick impression of this extremely difficult and extraordinary exciting field you may also visit Geometric Langlands and QFT where you can find some milestones from the beginning of the theory in the early $1970$s up to $2006$.\n\nPerhaps Claude Shannon deserves a mention for his work, such as defining Entropy in the 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" and generally spurring the field of information theory. He created very general models for communication and gave some profound results about them. I don't know much about Shannon's other contributions (besides that they are numerous) so hopefully someone can inform.\n\nAlan Turing's general computing device, the \"Turing Machine\", could be mentioned. In a world without electronic computers, \"this machine can compute anything that you can\" seems to me to be a monumental generalization, even to the foundations of mathematics."
