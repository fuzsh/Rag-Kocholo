        "text": "rgold\n\nTrad climber\n\nPoughkeepsie, NY\n\nTopic Author's Original Post - Nov 14, 2014 - 08:31am PT\n\nOne of the greatest 20th century mathematicians and a real iconoclast.\n\nHis influence, from Wikipedia:\n\nWithin algebraic geometry itself, his theory of schemes is used in technical work. His generalization of the classical Riemann-Roch theorem started the study of algebraic and topological K-theory. His construction of new cohomology theories has left consequences for algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, and representation theory. His creation of topos theory has appeared in set theory and logic.\n\nOne of his results is the discovery of the first arithmetic Weil cohomology theory: the ℓ-adic étale cohomology. This result opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed by his student Pierre Deligne. To this day, ℓ-adic cohomology remains a fundamental tool for number theorists, with applications to the Langlands program.\n\nGrothendieck influenced generations of mathematicians after his departure from mathematics. His emphasis on the role of universal properties brought category theory into the mainstream as an organizing principle. His notion of abelian category is now the basic object of study in homological algebra. His conjectural theory of motives has been behind modern developments in algebraic K-theory, motivic homotopy theory, and motivic integration.\n\nFor those who know about such things, not mentioned here is that Jean Dieudonne (his thesis advisor) compared Grothendiecks early work in topological vector spaces as equivalent in influence to Banach\n\nIn the light of all this, the following quote (translated from French of course) is interesting, perhaps especially in view of some of the other discussions about mathematics that have occurred on this site.\n\n...I've had the chance, in the world of mathematics that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my \"elders\" and among young people in my general age group, who were much more brilliant, much more \"gifted\" than I was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradlewhile for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I had to learn (so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates, almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.\n\nIt has been said archly, that at either end of the economic spectrum, there is a leisure class. Perhaps to this we should add that at either end of the intellectual spectrum, there is a dumb ox.\n\nyanqui\n\nclimber\n\nBalcarce, Argentina\n\nNov 14, 2014 - 11:44am PT\n\nGrothendieck probably had as much to do with the mathematics I used in my thesis as anyone: topological tensor products, nuclear spaces, topological algebras, derived categories, D-modules; I used all the big guns. He was definitely an interesting (excentric? insane?) guy who, for a period, worked extremely hard in mathematics and was incredibly productive. Then he just stopped. Malgrange once told me that he felt Grothendiek had worked so hard that something broke in his brain. Was Grothendieck a mad man? a genius? He was the most talked about mathematician among my peers when I was a graduate student. To a large extent, he was rejected by the mainstream when he began to publicly protest the compliance of professional mathematics with the military-industrial complex. He went to Brazil to teach and publish his new developments on topological vector spaces and then, latter on, went to the jungles of North Vietnam to teach category theory to the Viet-Cong. I wonder if those guys complained that mathematics (as Grothendieck saw it) wasn't useful? In the end he just disappeared from public life and never returned. RIP Grothendieck.\n\nPS: plus his name is pretty much impossible to spell correctly. jgill\n\nBoulder climber\n\nColorado\n\nNov 16, 2014 - 03:33pm PT\n\nAlexander can't even hold his own against Zsa Zsa Gabor in the Supertopo page levels. (rgold)\n\nIndeed, the trend toward increased generality and abstraction, which can be seen across the whole field since the middle of the 20th century, is due in no small part to Grothendiecks influence. (NYT)\n\nAG's contributions and influence were phenomenal, but his legacy is generally incomprehensible to most normal, college-educated people*. A hundred and fifty years ago or so it may have been possible for mathematical discoveries to be appreciated by many in the educated population, but for the last hundred years levels of abstraction have risen to the point that, apart from a few number theory conjectures and geometric conundrums, a lot of what has transpired is as unintelligible as a peculiar foreign language. Of course there are always a few entertaining analogies that convey quite a bit: e.g., the discussion that a topologist is someone who cannot tell the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup!\n\nIn graduate school almost fifty years ago I had the option of going into \"soft analysis\" (abstract), but chose to turn to the past for (modest) new discoveries in \"classical analysis\"(less abstract). That served me well, for I don't think I had the ability to make contributions in a very abstract mathematical world.\n\n* Tim or Rich or others might disagree. If so I'll learn something! rgold\n\nTrad climber\n\nPoughkeepsie, NY\n\nTopic Author's Reply - Nov 16, 2014 - 05:38pm PT\n\nAG's contributions and influence were phenomenal, but his legacy is generally incomprehensible to most normal, college-educated people.\n\nI think it is fair to say that a large fraction, perhaps a majority, of working mathematicians don't understand Grothendieck's work and contributions; it is in some ways very specialized even though in other ways extremely general. You probably have to be working in algebraic geometry or some allied field to really know what Grothendieck was up to.\n\nThat said, I think an analogy, no doubt flawed in more ways than I realize, might be made with, say, Isaac Newton. Newton was in possession of Kepler's calculations of planetary orbits, based on Tyco Brahe's astonishingly accurate celestial observations (done without a telescope, indeed with wooden instruments, with a resolution about the width of a human hair held at arm's length). Kepler had made some utterly remarkable observations, in some sense the least of which is that the planets travel in elliptic orbits with the sun at one of the two foci. And the question was is this always true, and if so why?\n\nNewton looked past the exceptional complexity of the observations and the almost mystical nature of Kepler's insights and instead sought basically simple fundamental structures whose existence would entail Kepler's observations as consequences. These he found, in the form of his three laws and the supposition that the gravitational force between two bodies is inversely proportional to the distance between the bodies. Newton was obliged to invent calculus along the way in order to work out the consequences of his basic laws. What we got was an exceptionally fruitful theory that is the basis of almost all world-scale enterprises involving force and motion.\n\nFinding simplicity where almost everyone else sees overwhelming complexity is the work of geniuses. I think one could argue that Grothendieck did something similar in the fields he contributed to, primarily algebraic geometry. I don't think one could make a case for simplicity here, but we could say that Grothendieck found abstract structures that had consequences that were conjectured but beyond the realm of proof. And abstraction, being essentially the ignoring of details, is really a form of simplicity, even when it is hard to learn.\n\nPlaying the role of Kepler's observations were the Weil conjectures, which seemed as if they might be true because of analogies with other branches of mathematics, in particular algebraic topology, but which lacked the structural underpinnings (eg continuity) to be verified in their own context. Something akin to the concept of cohomology with rational coefficients in the realm of algebraic topology was needed in the realm of algebraic geometry. Grothendieck built a whole abstract edifice that made the analogies possible and conferred new and unanticipated powers on the workers who mastered it. Andrew Barnes\n\nIce climber\n\nAlbany, NY\n\nNov 16, 2014 - 07:31pm PT\n\nGrothendieck's brilliance is universally acknowledged in mathematical circles. As people in this thread have pointed out, he has revolutionized\n\nalgebraic geometry and number theory - the notion of a scheme and the\n\nsimplifications it has engendered are hard to describe.\n\nHis personality and life trajectory are not too surprising, even though\n\nunconventional (for mathematicians). There was nothing he could have gained\n\nby feigning respect for the mathematical establishment, and he didn't. If he\n\n\"retired\" from mathematics early, that was his prerogative. A day or a\n\nmonth of Grothendieck is much more than a lifetime for most regular\n\nmathematicians.\n\nWhen one has seen the light and scaled the divine celestial heights, there is nothing to be gained from the pedestrian bickerings of academia, tenure, grants, publishing etc. No prizes or marks of human recognition can add to\n\nthe lustre of Grothendieck. He was a mathematician who discovered eternal truths, of the kind that time does not diminish. yanqui\n\nclimber\n\nBalcarce, Argentina\n\nNov 17, 2014 - 10:02am PT\n\nI think it would be unrealistic to imagine that Grothendieck's break from his life as a professional mathematician was the happy separation of a man who was too authentic to fit into the the phoniness of academic life. Certainly the break had elements of authenticity, but it also seems to have had elements of madness and it's not at all clear that Grothendieck ever found what he might have been looking for. For anyone who might be interested, here are some in depth considerations from a biographer who made the effort to wade through the thousands of pages of Grothendieck's meditations:\n\nhttp://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800930p.pdf\n\nI also think it's inaccurate to hold Grothendieck, in some sense, as responsible for a higher level of abstraction in mathematics. Early on, Grothendieck integrated smoothly (ha ha: math metaphor!) into the elite group of French academics of his day and participated in (more like: became a leading figure in) the kind of mathematics that was already going on in that time and place. In this sense, a new level of abstraction was not a revolutionary feature of Grothendieck's work.\n\njgill\n\nBoulder climber\n\nColorado\n\nNov 17, 2014 - 07:38pm PT\n\nThe article in the AMS Notices cited by Yanqui paints a sad picture of a genius in psychotic decline. It reminded me of articles I read years ago about Georg Cantor.\n\n\"Abstraction\" in math is frequently equated to \"generalization.\" I'm not sure I entirely agree with this, but my argument would be weak. Like a giant snowball rolling down a slope math keeps accumulating as its outer \"shell\" grows, new definitions appearing to describe categorization processes. A simple example: some complex functions may be differentiated, thus leading to a class of complex functions called \"holomorphic.\" Some holomorphic functions are \"injective\" or one-to-one, and are then labeled \"univalent.\" On and on it goes . . . and where it ends, nobody knows. (Used to enjoy that guy! Recognize him?)\n\nMuch of \"soft\" analysis revolves around functions that are \"linear\" (very well behaved) and abstractions abound, some in functional analysis for instance providing the kinds of overviews mentioned above as AG's wonderful insights. But once one leaves linearity and moves into non-linear territory - analytic theory of continued fractions, e.g. - not a lot of cosmic perspective is available. When I was active in a small international group years ago we would talk about a hypothetical generalized theory that might explain analytic continued fractions like the wonderfully simple structures of power series - or a hypothetical metric that might open new vistas - but these things didn't happen. Still awaiting someone like AG . . ."
