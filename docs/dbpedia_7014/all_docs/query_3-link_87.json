        "text": "For topic 4 (schemes), I'd suggest Schemes: The Language of Algebraic Geometry, by Eisenbud and Harris. This book is out of print, and is generally regarded as having been \"superseded\" by its successor, The Geometry of Schemes. But for your purposes, I think the earlier book is actually better, since it's only 160 pages, and if you just want the main ideas, the first two chapters should suffice. The authors specifically aimed at making the topic accessible to students encountering schemes for the first time.\n\nLet me suggest having looking at Grothendieck's own article The cohomology theory of abstract algebraic varieties in the proceedings of the 1958 ICM. This is both short (15 pages) and in English. Although written quite early on, it explains the motivations and intuitions for many of the developments that lay in the future in a lucid way. For instance, he compares and contrast his notion of scheme (referred to here as a pre-schema) with the more classical notions. He hints at \"a definition of the Weil cohomology (involving both 'spatial' and Galois cohomology)...\", which would eventually become étale cohomology.\n\nTopic 10 got developed further via the concept of o-minimality. See e.g. \"Tame topology and o-minimal structures\" by Lou van den Dries, 1998 CUP, http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511525919\n\nA shorter text is by Michel Coste: http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/michel.coste/polyens/OMIN.pdf\n\nSee also nLab article on tame topology: http://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/tame+topology\n\nFor learning about topoi, I'd strongly recommend Goldblatt's Topoi: The Categorical Analysis of Logic, which goes over the subject and a few interesting applications in a very approachable and pleasant manner. It's not particularly concise at 556 pages, though you needn't read the entire text to get a solid foundational concept of topoi.\n\nInfinity-stacks\n\nBefore learning about infinity stacks, one ought to learn about stacks. For this, look at section 4.1.1 of Vistoli's notes, Notes on Grothendieck topologies, fibred categories and descent theory, which is an exposition of one concrete case. This section is around a page and a half. He states:\n\nthat the fact we can glue continuous maps and topological spaces says $(Cont)$ is a stack over $Top$.\n\nThis in fact a generalisation of the clutching construction of bundles. And you can learn about bundles in the very readable first chapter of Grothendiecks Kansas notes on fibre bundles.\n\nThere is also an expository note by Barbara Fantechi, Stacks for Everybody.\n\nFor 5. Topoi. There is a very readable notice of the AMS: What is... a topos?, Luc Illusie, and with M Raynaud about Schemes at Grothendieck and Algebraic Geometry. In fact, the webpage of Professor L. Illusie contains very valuable material regarding the question.\n\nYou can read (online) about various of the listed topics in Lectures grothendieckiennes Edited by Frédéric Jaëck\n\nAnd find a lot of original material at Thèmes pour une Harmonie!"
