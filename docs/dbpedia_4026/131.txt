The Patriarchate of Alexandria temporarily stopped mentioning the name of the Patriarch of Moscow and dismissed the metropolitan Leonid Klinsky.

A statement on the website of the Patriarchate of Alexandria stated that the Holy Synod, in a session held in the Cathedral of the Holy Patriarchal Monastery of Saint George in Old Cairo, dealt in detail with the issue of what it said was an uncanonical incursion of the Church of Russia into the borders of the spiritual and pastoral jurisdiction of the Alexandrian Patriarchate on the African continent, in coordination with the so-called "Patriarchal Exarch of Africa" ​​from the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Klinsky Leonid Gorbachev".

"After an exhaustive debate and conversation, the Holy Synod decided to dismiss the former Metropolitan Leonid of Klin from the high office of the hierarchy, due to a series of canonical transgressions (intrusion into the jurisdiction of an ancient Church, consecration of antimins, distribution of holy Myrrh, buying native clerics with money - even broken, conspiracy, ethnophiletism, etc.) and condemned the newly appeared ecclesiological-political "theories" of shepherding the Russian world everywhere under the sun, based on national affiliation. Finally, after many months of ignoring and silence by the Moscow Patriarch Mr. Cyril to the written protests of the Blessed Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria sent to him, to call back the "exarchical authorities" sent from the North to Africa, the Head of the Alexandrian Church temporarily stops mentioning the name of the Patriarch of Moscow, the announcement says.

According to announcements, the sessions of the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria continue tomorrow.
