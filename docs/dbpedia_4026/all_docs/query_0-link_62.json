        "text": "St. Sergius and Bacchus Church, also known as Abu Serga, in Coptic Cairo is one of the oldest Coptic churches in Egypt, dating back to the 4th century.\n\nSergius and Bacchus were fourth-century Roman Christian soldiers revered as martyrs and saints by the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches.\n\nThe church is dedicated to Sergius and Bacchus, who were soldier-saints martyred during the 4th century in Syria by the Roman Emperor Maximian.\n\nSaints Sergius and Bacchus Church is traditionally believed to have been built on the spot where the Holy Family, Joseph, Mary and the infant Jesus Christ, rested at the end of their journey into Egypt. They may have lived here while Joseph worked at the fortress.\n\nThis church is built over a roman cave “Now Holy Crypt” where Holy Family believed to be lived for longest period during their Voyage to Egypt to avoid execution of baby Jesus from King Herold of Jerusalem.\n\nThe most interesting feature is the crypt where Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus are said to have rested. The crypt is 10 meters deep and, when Nile levels are high, is often flooded.\n\nThe Church was built in the 4th century and was probably finished during the 5th century. It was burned during the fire of Fustat during the reign of Marwan II around 750. It was then restored during the 8th century, and has been rebuilt and restored constantly since medieval times; however, it is still considered to be a model of the early Coptic churches.\n\nFounded in 1910 and renovated in 2006, the Coptic Museum in Cairo is dedicated to the culture and history of the Copts, Egypt’s orthodox Christians, who make up approximately 10% of Egypt’s current population.\n\nThe museum traces the history of Christianity in Egypt from its beginnings to the present day. It was erected on 8,000 square meters offered by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria under the guardianship of Pope Cyril V.\n\nThe fortress’s tower now marks the entrance to the tranquil courtyards and lush, verdant gardens of the Coptic Museum.\n\nThe mashrabiya is a type of oriel window enclosed with carved wooden latticework.\n\nThis is the beautiful ceiling woodwork and stained glass from the Coptic Museum.\n\nThe icons\n\nThe Testament and the Codex\n\nThe museum’s collection, which includes icons, textiles, books, religious items, and objects of daily use, illustrates the essential role that Copts have traditionally played in Egyptian society, as well as their importance to the development of Christianity and Christian Monasticism.\n\nThe Coptic museum houses the world’s most important examples of Coptic art.\n\nThe Church of St. George is a Greek Orthodox Church in Coptic Cairo. The church dates back to the 10th century (or earlier). The current structure was rebuilt following a 1904 fire.\n\nThe Church of St. George in Coptic Cairo is the principal Greek Orthodox church of Egypt. It is built atop an old Roman tower and adjoins the Monastery of St. George.\n\nThe Church of St. George was built in the 10th century, but a fire destroyed the original structure. The present church dates only from 1904.\n\nInside, the dark interior is heavy with incense and pierced by sunbeams that filter through its stained glass windows.\n\nThe Monastery of St. George is now the seat of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria. The monastery rarely admits tourists.\n\nAfter the Church of St. George, I went to the Coptic Museum.\n\nKhan el-Khalili is a major souk (marketplace or commercial) in the Islamic district of Cairo. The bazaar district is one of Cairo’s main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike.\n\nThe souk dates back to 1382, when Emir (commander or general) Djaharks el-Khalili built a large caravanserai in Cairo under the Burji Mamluk Sultan Barquq; the eponymous khan is still extant. (khan means caravanserai)\n\nBy the time of Barquq, the first Circassian Mamluk Sultan (1382–1399) much reconstruction needed to be done within the walls of the city in order to repair the damage incurred as a result of the Black Death.\n\nThe Egyptian guide said; Visiting Cairo, your trip is not completed without a stop at the Khan El-Khalili bazaar, where you will be transported back in time to an old Arab souk.\n\nShop owners calling you to their stalls, the scent of spices, the hustle and bustle of trade, and the many beautiful objects will have you lost among alleys for hours.\n\nPut your haggling skills to the test when buying statuettes, spices, souvenirs, silver jewelry, t-shirts, galabiyyas, belly dancing costumes, or anything for that matter.\n\nWhen your shopping’s done, don’t miss out on a traditional cup of tea at the famous Café Layaly el-Housen.\n\nAfter shopping, I tried a shishah in the Café Layaly el-Housen. It was not such good for me. (Shisha is a syrupy tobacco mix with molasses and vegetable glycerol which is smoked in a hookah.)\n\nAfter American continent discovery, the tobacco spread out in the world. Original tobacco culture flourished in each place of the world. The people are going to keep out cigarettes in many countries, so it will be extinct by the splendid culture now. It is very good for the stress emission if you smoke appropriately.\n\nDepression patients increase recently as non-smoker increase in Tokyo.\n\nGoing to Sultan Hassan Mosque from Muhammad Ali mosque.\n\nThe Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan is a massive Mamluk (Military of the slave social position native place in the Islam) era mosque and madrassa located near the Citadel in Cairo.\n\nThe Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan is regarded as the finest piece of early-Mamluk architecture era in Cairo, an age of architectural splendour.\n\nThis mosque which was built from 1356 through 1363 by the mandate of sultan Hasan. Contrary to the magnificent appearance, the process until completion was really full of disturbance, and it had tragedy such as the sultan being killed just before completion.\n\nThe story has that the construction of this complex was boring and was a process of the tragedy. In fact, it was built between 1356 and 1363 by the Sultan Hassan who was murdered shortly before the mosque was completed.\n\nSultan Hassan’s madrassa-mosque was built out of huge blocks of stone. Due to its tremendous height, this mosque soon became a symbol of the culmination of all the architectural power developed throughout a century of Mamluk rule.\n\nWhen arriving to the mosque, your eyes will be immediately drawn upward into the blue sky. And as you lower your head, you will witness the most amazingly patterned mosaic-paved courtyard, unprecedented in Cairo. Only a glimpse of the splendour you’ll gaze at inside.\n\nInterestingly, after his assassination, Sultan Hasan’s body was hidden and never found; the mosque never served its purpose.\n\nThe great Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha is a mosque situated in the Citadel of Cairo and commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha between 1830 and 1848.\n\nSituated on the summit of the citadel, this Ottoman mosque, the largest to be built in the first half of the 19th century, is, with its fantastic silhouette and twin minarets, the most visible mosque in Cairo. The mosque was built in memory of Tusun Pasha, Muhammad Ali’s oldest son, who died in 1816.\n\nThe interior has a measure of 41×41 meters and gives a great feeling of space.\n\nMuhammad Ali Pasha (4 March 1769 – 2 August 1849) was an Albanian commander in the Ottoman army, who became Wāli (governor), and self-declared Khedive (title of the Egyptian ruler) of Egypt and Sudan. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres that he instituted.\n\nHe also ruled Levantine (historic areas of Palestine, Israel and Syria) territories outside Egypt. The dynasty he established would rule Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\n\nMuhammad Ali Pasha was buried in a tomb carved from Carrara marble, in the courtyard of the mosque.\n\nThe Memphis open air museum at Mit Rahina is located to 4km east of Saqqara.\n\nAccording to legend, the city was founded by the pharaoh Menes around 3000 BC. Memphis was the ancient capital of Aneb-Hetch, the first nome (district) Lower Egypt.\n\nMemphis, capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom, it remained an important city throughout ancient Mediterranean history.\n\nAncient Greece historian Herodotus describes, after builing a reclamation dike and changing the flow of the Nile Pharaoh Menes built a Memphis as the capital. But according to the ancient tradition, Menes made ​​a habit of sacrifice and luxurious lifestyle.\n\nAnd some Egyptologist says, his reign was 62-year and killed by hippopotamus.\n\nAt least, Menes is the form of the king’s name that was used by the 3rd century B.C. Two other first dynasty kings’ names are associated with Menes, Narmer and Aha.\n\nThe Egyptian guide explained that Queen Hatshepsut was made ​​this Sphinx, so the face of the Sphinx is friendly and similar to her.\n\nThe ruins of ancient Memphis have yielded a large number of sculptures representing Pharaoh Rameses II.\n\nWithin the museum in Memphis is a giant statue of the pharaoh Rameses II carved of monumental limestone, about 10 metres in length. Rameses II is really handsome.\n\nHeading to the hotel in Giza, after this.\n\nDahshour is a small village approximately a population of 15,000 and located 8km south of Saqqara . It looks like the vellage of Saqqara.\n\nDahshur is famous for its royal necropolis located in the desert on the west bank of the Nile. It is known chiefly for several pyramids, two of which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613-2589 BC.\n\nThe Red Pyramid is the largest of the three major pyramids located at the Dahshur necropolis. Named for the rusty reddish hue of its sandstones, it is also the third largest Egyptian pyramid, after those of Khufu and Khafra at Giza. The Red Pyramid is 105 metres high. It was the third pyramid built by Old Kingdom Pharaoh Sneferu.\n\nSneferu is an ancient pharaoh of Egypt, the old kingdom era and is the founder of the Egyptian fourth dynasty. The reign is 2589 from 2613 B.C.\n\nPharaoh Sneferu who is the father of the Khufu King built the Red Pyramid in the fourth dynasty for the ancient Egypt, old kingdom era in Dahshur.\n\nBent Pyramid\n\nThe Bent Pyramid is a unique example of early pyramid development in Egypt, this was the second pyramid built by Sneferu as well.\n\nThe lower part of the pyramid rises from the desert at a 54-degree inclination, but the top section is built at the shallower angle of 43 degrees, lending the pyramid its very obvious “bent” appearance.\n\nArchaeologists now believe that the Bent Pyramid represents a transitional form between step-sided and smooth-sided pyramids.\n\nAfter the village of DahshourI, going to the ancient capital, Memphis.\n\nAfter the Great Sphinx, left for the little village, Saqqara.\n\nSaqqara is a very small village. The villager runs agriculture with the water of the canal from the Nile. They are poor, but are peaceful.\n\nSaqqara is 32 km to the south of Cairo and particularly to the extensive ancient necropolis on the plateau above the Nile Valley, the location of tombs and pyramids dating to the Predynastic, Old Kingdom, New Kingdom and Late Periods of ancient Egyptian history.\n\nThe Pyramid of Djoser (Step pyramid) is archeological remains in the Saqqara necropolis, northwest of the city of Memphis.\n\nDjoser was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty during the Old Kingdom and the founder of this epoque. He was the son of Pharaoh Khasekhemwy and queen Nimaethap.\n\nIn the time, Djoser got mineral resources of Sinai Peninsula. He started power expansion using the wealth and reached to the southern Aswan.\n\nThe inscriptions of the former Sehel Island that is located in the Nile, about 3.2 km southwest of Aswan shows expansion of the power, too.\n\nWhen the country became the famine by a shortage of water of the Nile, he appointed Imhotep who was a priest of Thoth God as a prime minister; and got over the difficulties.\n\nRoofed colonnade corridor leading into the complex, with stone pillars carved to imitate bundled plant stems.\n\nIt was built during the 27th century BC for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser by Imhotep, the vizier (The highest official in Ancient Egypt to serve the pharaoh).\n\nThe right image is Imhotep (circa 2650–2600 BC).\n\nHe served under the Third Dynasty king Djoser as chancellor to the pharaoh and high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. He was a superior prime minister. In addition to being a superior architect, he was a good physician. After his death, he was considered to be God as “God of wisdom, medicine and the magic” and was identified with Greek medicine God Asklepios.\n\nPharaoh Unas (ruled 2375-2345 BCE) also built his Pyramid at Saqqara. Inside he placed an undecorated black basalt sarcophagus and built the walls of his burial chamber of fine cream colored alabaster (calcite) carved and painted to resemble a sacred tent with a ceiling of golden stars. Here was engraved the first known example of the “Book of the Dead”, careful instructions on overcoming the obstacles of the next world. This beautiful chamber is yet another treasure of Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining or couchant sphinx (a mythical creature with a lion’s body and a human head) that stands on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza.\n\nIt is the largest monolith statue in the world, standing 73.5 metres long, 19.3 metres wide, and 20.22 m high. It is the oldest known monumental sculpture, and is commonly believed to have been built by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of the Pharaoh Khafra.\n\nPharaoh Khafra (c. 2558–2532 BC)\n\nThe builder of Giza’s second pyramid, Khafra is perhaps best known because his face was the model for that of the Great Sphinx, which guards his tomb site. One of the younger sons of the pharoah Khufu, Khafra succeeded his half-brother Djedefra to become fourth king of the Fourth Dynasty. Khafra also adopted the title ‘Son of Ra’ (sa Ra), which his half-brother had initiated to reflect the importance of the cult of the sun god Ra at this time.\n\nUnlike Djedefra, who built his pyramid at the site of Abu Roash, Khafra returned to Giza to build his own tomb – close to that of his father, Khufu. Although a little smaller than his father’s, Khafra’s pyramid was built on slightly higher ground, to lessen the difference in height. Its ancient name, Khafra is Great, reflects the status of its omnipotent owner.\n\nA sphinx is a mythical creature with, as a minimum, the body of a lion and a human head.\n\nAccording to Greek tradition, it has the haunches of a lion, the wings of a great bird, and the face of a woman. She is mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer her riddle suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster.\n\nUnlike the Greek sphinx which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man. In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent in contrast to the malevolent Greek version and was thought of as a guardian often flanking the entrances to temples."
