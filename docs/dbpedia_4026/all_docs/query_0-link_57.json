        "text": "The Church of Alexandria is one of the autocephalous Orthodox Churches. Its primate is the Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa, the successor to the Apostle Mark the Evangelist, who founded the Church of Alexandria in the 1st century. It is one of the five ancient patriarchates of the early Church, called the Pentarchy.\n\nGreek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa Founder(s) Apostle Mark Autocephaly/Autonomy declared Traditional Autocephaly/Autonomy recognized Traditional Current primate Pope Theodoros II Headquarters Alexandria, Egypt Primary territory Egypt and Africa Possessions abroad ? Liturgical language(s) Greek, Swahili, English, local languages Musical tradition Byzantine Chant Calendar Revised Julian Population estimate 250,000 Official website Church of Alexandria\n\nHistory[]\n\nSince the schism occurring as a result of the political and Christological controversies at the Council of Chalcedon (451 A.D.), the portion of the Church of Alexandria loyal to Chalcedonian Christology has liturgically been Greek-speaking, the majority of its native (i.e., Coptic) population and their modern descendents becoming a part of the Coptic Orthodox Church (i.e., non-Chalcedonian).\n\nThe Church today[]\n\nIn recent years, a considerable missionary effort was enacted by Pope Petros VII. During his seven years as patriarch (1997-2004), he worked tirelessly to spread the Orthodox Christian faith in Arab nations and throughout Africa, raising up native clergy and encouraging the use of local languages in the liturgical life of the Church. Missions spread and thrived in Kenya, Uganda, Madagascar, Cameroon, and elsewhere across the African continent.\n\nParticularly sensitive to the nature of Christian expansion into Muslim countries, His Beatitude worked to promote mutual understanding and respect between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. His efforts were ended as the result of a helicopter crash on September 11, 2004, in the Aegean Sea near Greece, killing him and several other clergy, including Bishop Nektarios of Madagascar, another bishop with a profound missionary vision.\n\nToday, some 300,000 Orthodox Christians comprise the Patriarchate of Alexandria, the highest number since the Roman Empire. The current primate of the Church of Alexandria is His Beatitude Theodoros II, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa.\n\nThe Episcopacy[]\n\nThe Holy Synod[]\n\nHis Beatitude Theodoros II, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa\n\nHis Eminence Paul (Lyngris), Elder Archbishop of Memphis\n\nHis Eminence Dionysios (Hatzivasiliou), Elder Archbishop of Leontopolis\n\nHis Eminence Petros (Giakoumelos), Elder Archbishop of Aksum\n\nHis Eminence Makarios (Tillyrides), Archbishop of Kenya\n\nHis Eminence Jonah (Lwanga), Archbishop of Kampala and All Uganda\n\nHis Eminence Seraphim (Iakovou), Archbishop of Johannesburg and Pretoria\n\nHis Eminence Alexander (Gianniris), Metropolitan of Nigeria\n\nHis Eminence Theophylaktos (Tzoumerkas), Metropolitan of Tripolis\n\nHis Eminence Sergios, Archbishop of the Cape of Good Hope\n\nHis Eminence Alexios, Metropolitan of Carthage\n\nHis Eminence Ieronymos, Metropolitan of Mwanza\n\nHis Eminence Kallinikos (Pippas), Archbishop of Pilousion\n\nHis Eminence Proterios (Pavlopoulos), Metropolitan of Ptolemais\n\nHis Eminence George (Vladimirou), Metropolitan of Zimbabwe\n\nHis Eminence Nicholas, Archbishop of Ermoupolis\n\nHis Eminence Dimitrios (Zaharengas), Metropolitan of Irinopolis\n\nHis Eminence Ignatios (Madenlides), Archbishop of Central Africa\n\nHis Eminence Emmanuel (Kiagias), Metropolitan of Khartoum and Sudan, Exarch of All Sudan\n\nHis Eminence Gregory (Stergiou), Metropolitan of Cameroon, Exarch of Central Africa\n\nDiocesan Bishops[]\n\nHis Grace Ioakeim (Kontobas), Bishop of Zambia\n\nHis Grace Damaskinos (Papandreou), Bishop of Ghana\n\nHis Grace Ignatios (Sennis), Bishop of Madagascar\n\nHis Grace Meletios (Kamiloudes), Bishop of Kolwezi\n\nHis Grace Theodoros (Dimitriou), Bishop of Mozambique\n\nAuxiliary Bishops[]\n\nHis Grace Athanasios of Cyrene\n\nHis Grace Gabriel of Mareotis\n\nHis Grace Spyridon of Kanopou\n\nHis Grace Nikodemos of Nitria\n\nHis Grace Gennadios of Nilopolis\n\nTitular Archbishops[]\n\nHis Excellency Theoklitos of Helioupolis\n\nHis Excellency Philemon of Karvasos\n\nHis Excellency Ioakeim of Tamiathus\n\nHis Excellency Porfyrios of Thivais\n\nHis Excellency Kyrillos of Nafkratis\n\nRetired Bishops[]\n\nHis Grace Panteleimon of Antinoe\n\nHis Grace Petros of Nikopolis\n\nHoly Archdioceses and Bishoprics[]\n\nArchdiocese Established See Jurisdiction Archdiocese of Memphis ??
