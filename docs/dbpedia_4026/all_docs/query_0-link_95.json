        "text": "By Mulengera Reporters\n\nArchimandrite Constantine Mbonabingi, a member of the Uganda Orthodox Church, has been chosen as the bishop of the Orthodox Church in Juba and South Sudan.\n\nURN understands that Mbonabingi’s appointment to the episcopal rank was decided during the recently concluded Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria and all of Africa. This synod, presided over by Pope and Patriarch Theodore II, convened last month at the cathedral of the Holy Patriarchal Monastery of Saint George in Cairo.\n\nThe announcement of Archimandrite Mbonabingi’s election was made on Friday to a congregation comprising Orthodox, Anglican, and Roman Catholic faithful at Old Kampala SS playground. The three Christian denominations had convened for the ecumenical public way of the cross.\n\nPrior to his elevation, Archimandrite Mbonabingi has been serving as the dean of the Fort Portal Region and at the same time Executive Secretary of the Uganda Joint Christian Council-UJCC."
