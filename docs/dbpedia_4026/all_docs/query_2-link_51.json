        "text": "Abstract Human Development indices for most African nations have been rated very low owing to the quality of education obtainable by their citizenry. Consequently, Africa nations’ development has best been described as developing. The pathetic stories of slave trade and colonialism have often described how most African nations were under-developed by Europe; through colonialists. In the same vein, missionary educational curriculum is also blamed for under-educating Africa. Unfortunately, while several Africa nations aimed for a revolution of their educational sector at post independence; leadership problems and military incursions in most African States aborted such dreams. As a result there is a sharp drop of human development capital as a nation cannot develop beyond the level of education of its people. The Nigeria case presents a typical African nations’ experience where military misrule erode the nation of quality tertiary education through poor funding and policies. Hence, even the Premier University along with others first generation universities grabble for the back seats in the global university cyber metric ranking. The implications include un-employability and under-employment of most African graduates and poor development of future national leaders. This is further worsened by human capital flight resulting from foreign policies such as Bologna Process sets in. One wonders if Africa therefore has hope of becoming a developed continent as Europe. It is from this background that the contributions of the Church in Nigeria towards Faith Base Private Universities are considered. The emergence of Faith Base Private Universities have been linked to poor enrolment of students; poor facilities; strike actions, pervasive immorality, and “quality” problem that characterised the public universities .The paper therefore argues that, faith base Private universities would only make tangible contribution to Human development in Nigeria and Africa at large, by providing quality curriculum base and affordable education; that can prepare graduates for leadership and services bearing in mind the competitive atmosphere of global ranking with consideration of the poverty level in Africa. The paper therefore adopted historical and critical approaches. The paper examined the quality of these Faith Base Private Universities using secondary data on the accreditation of academic programmes collected from National University Commission .The performance of the Non-Faith Base University and the Public University in Nigeria were compared through the data. Also, the affordability of the universities was contrasted to justify the impact of the Faith Base Private University in the poverty context of Nigeria.

(AM 136) Both African synods have indicated important areas for research in African Catholic Institutes of Higher learning. These include African Theology, Inculturation, Liturgical Inculturation, publishing books on Catholic Truth, undertaking assignments given by Bishops, and the Study of cultures (EA 103; AM 131). In addition the areas of marriage, the veneration of ancestors, and the spirit world are of particular importance but such research should be carried out in association with the bishops (EA 104). This is because \" The cultural aspects of problems in Africa need studying from the theological, sacramental, liturgical and canonical points of view \". (EA 104) Benedict XVI added two other important areas: Youth evangelisation and ministry (AM 135) as well as Challenges in African societies today (AM 135). It is clear that this last area goes beyond the focus on culture presented earlier and raises a whole host of research areas within philosophy, history, scripture, systematic theology and social sciences which could motivate our research in the future. It merits particular attention What about Seminaries? Major Seminaries provide appropriate religious formation and instruction in duties proper to the priesthood for young men who intend to become priests (CIC 235 §1). Seminaries fall under the dicastery of the Clergy (MI 2013). Catholic Institutes of Higher learning fall under the dicastery of Catholic Education. However in many of our countries, seminaries also provide the major concentrations of highly qualified Catholic theologians, philosophers, as well as academics in other fields in the humanities. Seminaries are often consulted by bishops in a wide range of theological and pastoral questions. Seminary staff also provide a significant number of future local bishops. For these reasons, seminary staff should also be considered as an important locus for the production of Catholic knowledge on local issues. In an increasingly globalized world such\n\nThe article reflects on the challenges of theological education in the 21st century and in Africa. Reputation, impact, success and funding have become the driving forces of the modern university. However, we are living in the 21st century and in Africa with a subsequent frame of reference that is holistic and faith-based. The article therefore argues for a multi- and transdisciplinary approach towards the nature of a university and recognition of the unique contribution theological education can contribute. Due to the inherently cooperative nature of theological scholarship, theological education could be able to avoid the extremes of the Scylla and the Charybdis, that is, fideism and secularisation, and therefore be able to survive at an academic institution. Both sectarianism and scientism should be avoided. Theological education in Africa needed to travel the same difficult road of theological faculties in Europe in the previous century."
