No war should be supported, ever, however “justified” it may seem. The cycle of human-to-human violence and destruction of God’s creation will never be broken as long as we seek to justify and support wars, and support one nation or group of people against another. Based on that, shame on you.\n\nYour stance also, unfortunately, is injected with a political charge as well, so, once more, shame on you. All political thoughts and leanings need to be left outside the church door, in the parking lot, in your homes. They should therefore also be off websites.\n\nSocial activism by a church group is one thing; to do so with the burden of political stances is quite another. Simply ask: What would Jesus say about all this?\n\nDavid Mahoney (Monson, Maine)\n\n__________________\n\nJun. 25, 2024\n\nMar. 16, 2024\n\nAlthough I disagree with Fr John Whiteford about many political and some theological issues, I think that the way that you are representing him here is not quite fair (less so than the Texas Monthly article, which was at least somewhat balanced).\n\nFr John was the acting pastor for two years of St Catherine’s in Lubbock, Texas, where I conducted reader’s services during the pandemic. The parish is hundreds of miles from Houston, so he only visited occasionally, but I had a fair amount of contact with him. He did indeed talk (over the dinner table, not in church) about the Confederacy in ways that made me highly uncomfortable, and he holds the usual Southern conservative views on many social and political issues. However, on the basis of his conversation and more importantly of his actions, I am 100% certain that he is not a White supremacist or fellow-traveller. Moreover, his opposition to the ordination of women does not seem to carry over into opposition to women having equality with men in secular life.\n\nBefore meeting him, I had expected from his internet writings that he would be much more of a fire-breathing sectarian than proved to be the case. Indeed, in many respects (and rather to my surprise), he struck me as an excellent pastor.\n\nNorman Dionysius Redington (Lubbock, Texas)\n\n__________________\n\nNov. 1, 2023\n\n[The following letter responds to The Moscow Patriarchate’s Absurdities in Africa.]\n\nThe question should really be why is the Moscow Patriarchate trying to undermine the Patriarchate of Alexandria? Why is the Moscow Patriarchate acting like a part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and propaganda for the Russian government? Why does the Moscow Patriarchate feel that it must undermine the Orthodox Christian missions and ministries of the canonical patriarchate in Africa? Particularly, why does Moscow feel it needs to interfere in the canonical territory of the Patriarchate of Alexandria on behalf of the Russian government?\n\nThe Russian government is using the Moscow Patriarchate as an espionage agency in its contest for political influence in Africa.\n\nArchbishop Lazar (Puhalo) (All Saints of North America Monastery, Dewdney, British Columbia)\n\nOrthodox Church in America (Retired)\n\n__________________\n\nAug. 26, 2023\n\nApparently the author is unrepentant of those impulses and unrestrained in acting upon them. His primary identity—as set forth in the title—is that of “a gay man” rather than “baptized child of God”.\n\nI pray that he may more completely die with Christ rather than to “persist in sin so that grace may abound”.\n\nRev. Father Deacon Thomas Shelley (Loganville, Pennsylvania)\n\nGreek Orthodox Archdiocese\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 6, 2023\n\nI am writing in response to the Open Letter about the list of candidates for the Metropolitan election on January 13, 2022, in Dallas TX. The candidates listed on the ballot need to meet the requirements. There needs to be respect for democracy, the democratic process, and its rules. You look shady when you hold an election and you can’t follow your own rules. The Church is not the place for shady elections to take place. You need to be proactive and organized when you run an organization that clearly you are not doing and aren’t paying attention to your own organization. Also, when people have election questions, they need to be answered in a direct manner that is straightforward and honest. Everyone is asking how does a parish select a delegate and what are the criteria for someone to qualify as a delegate?\n\nIt would be in your best interest and the interest of the faithful if you re-examined all of the candidates for the Metropolitan position. Do they qualify according to the rules that are written? You need to clearly and in a straightforward fashion answer all the questions from all of the parishes about this election and its process. You also need election monitors so election fraud does not take place.\n\nI can’t begin to put into words how horrible the Archdiocese looks at the present time. You need to function in reality and with the issues in front of you and answer the questions of the people you serve. When you stick your head in the ground, function in denial, and ignore the reality in front of you, all of the problems explode, which is exactly what has happened.\n\nDo your job! Remember, power is in numbers!\n\nAthena D. Tarsinos, MS (Glenview , Illinois)\n\n__________________\n\nNov. 10, 2022\n\nNB: For context see the Metropolitan Joseph: The Scandal section in our Archives 2020-22 linked at the top of this page. We publish this letter anonymously because the author is one of our principal sources of leaks from both Damascus and Englewood. It is addressed directly to the person of our editor Giacomo Sanfilippo and published with the author’s consent.\n\nI prayed for you in the Divine Liturgy, asking God to grant you good health and thanking Him for giving us, through Orthodoxy in Dialogue, the freedom to express our thoughts and discomfort about our church leadership. I just wanted to let you know that you are in our prayers and how much you are loved and appreciated by many people around me.\n\nWhen I send you anything, I put it in the hands of the Holy Spirit and you to decide what to do with it. This email is solely to extend my enormous appreciation to you and to let you know you are in our prayers supporting your path in Christ Our Lord and Savior.\n\nMay God always protect you from the evil one!\n\nLove in Christ.\n\n__________________\n\nOct. 20, 2022\n\nI am a lay Antiochian Orthodox and a university professor in Lebanon. I have been reading with interest Orthodoxy in Dialogue, including its coverage of the scandal of Joseph Zahlaoui. It is indeed a scandal. The church leadership should have acted swiftly and more firmly. The position you have advocated is, to be sure, justified and appreciable. I value your courage and uncompromising stance on corruption as well as on any other unethical behavior.\n\nHowever, there were instances where your condemnatory language went too far in its generalization or gross exaggeration. A regrettable illustration is a quote attributed to an unidentified source which says, “The reason for non-deposal is because most of the Metropolitans in the old country have a woman…. A jury of MJ’s peers cannot depose him of the exact thing they are doing.” Such a sweeping statement is totally unfounded, even if there might have been one or two bishops whose image conforms to the stereotypical portrayal you quote.\n\nAnother unacceptable illustration concerns Metropolitan Philip Saliba’s “generosity.” It is true that he has provided, on behalf of the North American Archdiocese, financial assistance to one or two dioceses and/or institutions. It is also likely that a few bishops were close to him and might have received his gifts or were given the opportunity to fundraise in the USA. Anything beyond that is largely fanfaronades of Philip and his coterie.\n\nHaving said this, I sincerely wish that you opt for a greater caution and precision in what you write and quote, for the sake of the credibility of your defense of a good cause. The truth sets us free.\n\nMarwan Mansour (Beirut, Lebanon)\n\n__________________\n\nOct. 18, 2022\n\nI know people are justifiably upset over the Synod’s decision, but would you please use your connections to report on whether there is going to be a truly independent auditing of the Archdiocese’s and Metropolitan Joseph’s finances?\n\nEric Perry (Belle, West Virginia)\n\nEditor’s note: Suspicion of financial crimes by Joseph Al-Zehlaoui and the Archdiocese is running high among the faithful. A number of individuals have taken the initiative to speak to federal and state law enforcement, and will let us know if and when there is something to report.\n\n__________________\n\nSep. 24, 2022\n\nThanks for printing my good friend Mike Woolsey’s letter [immediately preceding]. I wholeheartedly agree with the tenor of his opinion. I wish that there was a section of your reporting that relied only on the facts. I truly believe that headlining factual letters with unproven opinion and “evidence'”just drags down your potential value. Your and others’ opinions could be separated somehow.\n\nIt seems obvious that something negative has happened with Joseph and his situation. All investigations, potentially leading toward civil and criminal liabilities, not only of him, but also of his accusers, must continue if the Faith, as expressed through its trusted stewards, bishops and clergy, is to be honored and revered. Regardless, as many have said and written, “God is still on high, the Gospels are still on the altar, the Creed still states our beliefs, and Christ is risen!”\n\nBest regards in continuing to print the “facts” and let others express opinions in another section of your reporting. Your work seems extremely valuable for 21st-century Orthodoxy.\n\nP.S. Since Joseph is “retired,” by his own action, and given the apparent acceptance by Patriarch John, it seems strange that parishes in the Antiochian Archdiocese are still ordered to acknowledge him during services, rather than the Patriarch or local Bishops where they exist.\n\nPhil Tamoush (Redondo Beach, California)\n\n__________________\n\nSep. 21, 2022\n\nI am sympathetic to a site like yours generally. I am a new viewer. But you totally lose me when you add such speculative writings as The Far Reach of the Metropolitan Joseph Scandal: Evidence of Criminal Wrongdoing? (“… it appears to be either an investment scheme, a way to funnel money to Joseph, or heaven knows what [laundering??]),” The Adulterous Metropolitan’s Pathetic Attempt to Retain (Regain?) His Dignity, etc etc. I feel like I am watching/reading the typical so-called news stations of today that are not news but rather opinion shows with a bias.\n\nYou can do much better without the sensational headlines. I appreciate your platform but am disappointed in the tenor of the coverage. I was hoping for straight news and mature discussion here.\n\nMike Woolsey (Torrance, California)\n\n__________________\n\nSep. 3, 2022\n\nClearly, you’re not interested in the truth regarding the accusations against His Eminence, Metropolitan Joseph. You’ve already made up your mind. You’ve gone from reporting—if that was ever your intent—to prosecuting.\n\nHowever, unlike an honest prosecutor, you equate hearsay with evidence and accusations with a conviction. Neither is true. Anyone with a commitment to the rule of law, a casual understanding of the judicial process, or the standards of journalistic integrity would respect the difference.\n\nI don’t know if the Metropolitan is innocent or guilty. (How would I?) But I do know that an honest inquiry of the matter would assume he’s innocent, suspend judgment, and then dispassionately consider all the evidence.\n\nThe one thing we know from human nature is that “the first one to plead his cause seems right, until his neighbor comes and examines him” (Proverbs 18:17). In other words, there are always two sides to every story. Anyone who renders a judgment prior to hearing both will inevitably regret it.\n\nThe final straw for me is the fact that you quoted Buzz Learn. This says far more about you than the Metropolitan. You have now become the TMZ of Orthodoxy.\n\nMarcus Hoekenga (Charlotte, North Carolina)\n\n__________________\n\nAug. 25, 2022\n\nI do not understand why you are rushing to judgment on Metropolitan Joseph. It sounds like you have seen evidence that is compelling. However, this is not enough to condemn the man as you have done.\n\nThis is precisely why we have due process—investigations, ecclesiastical courts, and civil courts. Those who are accused are presumed innocent until proven guilty. If this is not the case, then every accusation becomes an indictment.\n\nEvery leader will inevitably face accusations. Sometimes they’re true; sometimes they’re false. That’s why St. Paul exhorts St. Timothy, “Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses” (see 1 Timothy 5:19).\n\nTo assume Metropolitan Joseph is guilty and to refer to his accuser as a victim, rather than “the alleged victim” lacks journalistic integrity and Christian charity.\n\nIf he’s guilty, then he should be defrocked and deposed. But that first needs to be determined by an investigation and the synod of bishops. Until that work is complete, we should pray for both Metropolitan Joseph and his alleged victim.\n\nIsn’t this how you’d want to be treated if you were in this situation?\n\nMarcus Hoekenga (Charlotte, North Carolina)\n\n__________________\n\nAug. 24, 2022\n\n[Published unedited.]\n\nHello, you may put this on your nasty website: the only reason I feel bad about Met. Joseph doing (that is if he really did) is the fact he allows the devil workers (you and others) to take advantage of what is happening and hit the morality of Clergy which in reality the devil’s way of hitting the Church. But make no mistake: you and others will wither and the Morality of the Church as it’s part of it’s tradition and life will Live forever!\n\nIyad Jabbour (Lexington, Kentucky)\n\n__________________\n\nJul. 25, 2022\n\n[The following response to OCA Synod of Bishops Slams Door Shut on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Orthodox Christians has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nWe are all children of the same God.\n\nOver forty years ago, I was honest with my father confessor about my loving orientation and was advised to be monogamous and still receive Holy Communion. I was 20 years old, attending college in San Diego. I was blessed with a true Orthodox Christian priest.\n\nA year later, he was transferred. The new priest turned me away during confession and would not give me Holy Communion because I told him I could not change my loving (sexual) orientation. I felt like the worst sinner in the world when that happened. I went to speak to the priest at my home church where I had been baptized and had served as an altar boy growing up. He told me I was excommunicating myself by not repenting of my orientation. I then left the Church, but I never left my Orthodox faith, which remains in my heart as part of my identity to this day.\n\nI did find a welcoming and affirming Episcopal parish to attend. Ironically, the pastor, Father George Regas, had previously been Greek Orthodox. This was a special place to worship, full of people on fire for Jesus who worked hard to help the poor and stood up for peace and justice. The tears would run down my face as I heard the priest speak of the God who loved all of His creation, including His gay children.\n\nI am heartbroken over this new statement from the Orthodox bishops that I have just read. They have not, in over 40 years, nor will they ever, strip me of my Orthodox faith and my love of all people and of God.\n\nI have been in a loving relationship for almost 9 years. My partner is Catholic. We attend an affirming Catholic parish where the priest allows me, as Orthodox, to receive Communion.\n\nI wish all Orthodox Christians who have been turned away from the Orthodox Church could find a second home just until my hope is realized that the bishops of the Orthodox Church will soon soften their hearts and let the love of Christ for all of God’s children shine through them.\n\nIn closing, I want to mention another true Orthodox Christian priest from a parish nearby. This priest is also welcoming and affirming as much as he can be. This priest makes me feel whole when I attend an Orthodox service there. I go up for a blessing during Holy Communion. Receiving his blessing gives me strength for the journey and keeps me connected to my rich Orthodox upbringing in the Church that I still respect.\n\nEdward Mark Harry Stepanian (Signal Hill, California)\n\n__________________\n\nJul. 22, 2022\n\nThe statement of the OCA Synod of Bishops is the most theologically offensive and intellectually insulting declaration about same-sex orientation that I have ever read, even by Roman Catholic and evangelical authors.\n\nAt the moment I am too angry to offer any rational proposal for how I might participate in a “disobedient” counter-offensive; but please put me on your list of ‘those who are willing. Meanwhile, if I can think of some creative way to resist, I’ll let you know.\n\nFinally, if there is some informal organization of like-minded Orthodox, whether lay or clergy, I would very much like to associated with it.\n\nBill Hood (Birmingham, Alabama)\n\n__________________\n\nJul. 21, 2022\n\nI’m not surprised about this announcement from the OCA Synod of Bishops. Last year I suffered great psychological abuse from my ex-pastor in the OCA. It was bad enough that an ambulance was summoned to my home. That event snapped me out of what now seems to me like a cult in the way they exerted their control over my thoughts and actions. Looking back, I am grateful that it happened because now I am free to grow in Christ without living in fear. There is a profound sense of pietism and complete disregard for the marginalized.\n\nM.F. (Santa Rosa, California)\n\n__________________\n\nJun. 2, 2022\n\nAs a member of an OCA parish, if I learned that my bishop’s lineage originated from a self-ordained fraud, I would want someone to “quibble” over that.\n\nJohn Arbogast (Mableton, Georgia)\n\n__________________\n\nMay 31, 2022\n\nI just read A Question for ROCOR and the OCA: What Now? As a lifelong member of thirty-nine years in the OCA—from a family of seminary graduates, choir directors, and people who have helped build up the Church in America for as long as we have been here (over 100 years now), here’s what I think is going to happen: my gut says that +Tikhon and the OCA are going to bend the knee to Kirill for ten rubles of silver, not even thirty.\n\nPhilip Brunke (South Plainfield, New Jersey)\n\n__________________\n\nMay 30, 2022\n\nThank you for the most recent and very good piece on the OCA and ROCOR. One correction: the UOC-MP did not condemn Kirill. They expressed disagreement (незгода) with his position regarding the war in Ukraine. (See the announcement on the UOC-MP website.) This is a relatively soft term considering the circumstances.\n\nVyacheslav Karpov, PhD (Kalamazoo, Michigan)\n\n__________________\n\nApr. 4, 2022\n\nThis may sound like a childish concept, but I am so upset over events in Ukraine that I would like to see everyone drop the word “Orthodox” from the title of the Russian Church. There is NOTHING ORTHODOX in that body.\n\nI hated seeing Hilarion Alfeyev touring Syria to express the Moscow Patriarchate’s concern for children there while children in Ukraine are tortured and murdered!\n\nShame on them!!!\n\nProtopresbyter Basil Papanikolaou (Davenport, Iowa)\n\nRetired, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese\n\n__________________\n\nNov. 28, 2021\n\nIn his response [the letter immediately below] to my article, Paul Nizinskyj cites four reasons that induced him to conclude that, on balance, the UK was better off outside the EU. He also states that he assumed, at the time of the vote, that the UK would remain within the EU Customs Union. I do not want to argue with his reasons, and certainly would not maintain that the EU is perfect. Nevertheless, I believe that the EU has massively benefited member nations, including the UK, and that the advantages of membership far outweigh the disadvantages. Paul identifies real problems and shortcomings that the UK would have been in a good position to influence if she were still an EU member. With Brexit, that opportunity is gone.\n\nThat Nizinskyj and others voted in good conscience I do not doubt. But I would argue that he was, along with millions of others, betrayed, if not at the time of the actual vote, then later, when, despite earlier assurances, it transpired that the UK was to leave the Customs Union, and that frictionless trade and freedom of movement would end. He chose to trust the Tory Party, whereas I did not.\n\nJames Chater (Le Mans, France)\n\n__________________\n\nNov. 28, 2021\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 22, 2021\n\nDue to the petition currently being sent around against Orthodoxy in Dialogue, I just wanted to register my support publicly for Orthodoxy in Dialogue.\n\nEsther Robinson (Fond du Lac WI)\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 16, 2021\n\nIt is so enjoyable to read Orthodoxy in Dialogue. It doesn’t pull any punches. It is understandable for all and does not couch itself in faux piety or high theological rhetoric. It is truly a conversation of a church. The original meaning of church was a gathering of people, and not what we see today, clergy, institutions, etc. Dialogue is not meant to be pretty, maudlin, saccharin, smarmy, etc. It is to the point and seeks common ground.\n\nThere are those who think that Orthodoxy is somehow ossified or petrified in a specific form. They conflate cultural tradition with sacred tradition. Sacred tradition is living, growing, and transforming in time, cultures, and places.\n\nThank you for the great service you provide for all of us.\n\nGerard Zabik (Niantic CT)\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 8, 2021\n\nI recently stumbled upon your site and I have to say I am utterly disgusted and dumbfounded that you cannot see the blatant contradiction in claiming to be Orthodox while perpetuating secular garbage such as same-sex marriage and other extreme immoralities.\n\nI see your attempts at reconciling traditional Orthodox doctrine with sodomy and the rejection of nature (i.e., transgenderism) as nothing short of Satanic. Although I am myself a most unprofitable sinner, I must beg you to repent for these egregious and incomprehensible errors.\n\nGod bless.\n\nBrandon Bruzzese (Minden NV)\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 25, 2021\n\nOver here in Europe, we’ve been following the developments in the USA with, generally, anxiety, relief, hope, and deep concern all mixed together.\n\nThis is a time of high passions, for all of us. Current world events, like a pandemic, invite it. Resisting them is a challenge.\n\nI’m fond of Orthodoxy in Dialogue. I believe this is a necessary platform, I’m grateful for the insights the people I’ve met here have provided me, and I enjoy occasionally writing for it. I love to have a place where we can actually learn from disagreeing with one another. But along with Fr John Daly, who wrote an earlier letter to the editors [Dec. 20, 2020 below], I also find myself a little worried.\n\nThere is, at times, a very fine line between refuting lies and maintaining a feud. Headlines like the ones that have been used lately can be incendiary, which would do nothing to change the minds of opponents, but can put off those ‘on the fence’, as it were. We should wear like a badge the heart and mind of Christ. And, occasionally, we probably should let the sun go down on our anger.\n\nI love this platform. I want to continue loving it.\n\nMonica Spoor (Veenendaal, Netherlands)\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 15, 2021\n\n[Due to the importance of this matter and the author’s credible fear of repercussions to their family, we have agreed to publish their letter anonymously after verifying their identity.

Those are not headlines worthy of a serious Orthodox organization. They are more in keeping with the debased and debasing political culture our country has been trapped in for decades now. Please consider a different approach to people you profoundly disagree with. You can’t win hearts and minds with insults. The people you disagree with bear the same iconic image of God as we all do. We are all struggling to manifest His likeness in the world, sometimes wisely, sometimes foolishly.\n\nPerhaps the words of Francis of Assisi apply here: Ubi caritas et amor, Deus ibi est (Where charity and love abide, there God is).\n\nGod bless and keep you well.\n\nV.

While I may not agree with Mr. Tereshko’s implication that Marxism is inherently incompatible with Christianity, I think it is important that we acknowledge the implicit cynicism of Marxist and critical theory and how this, perhaps in ways even more so than dialectical materialism, is truly corrosive to the witness of Christians in the public sphere.\n\nAlbert Camus, in an address entitled “The Unbeliever and the Christians,” once spoke to an audience comprised of both Marxists and Christians (and probably some Christian Marxists) along these lines:\n\nIf [Christianity and Communism] are pessimistic as to man, it is optimistic as to human destiny. Well, I can say that, pessimistic as to human destiny, I am optimistic as to man.\n\nWe cannot ignore the systemic and impersonal evils that are built into the structures of today’s communities and human experiences. However, we cannot afford to exhaust our efforts on systemic evil alone. Any social movement that does not strive for the transformation of the self as much as, if not more than, the transformation of society is a pharisaical deception.\n\nWe must not give in to the deep and sinful inertia of thinking that everything is okay that seems so, but we must also remember that truth does not always thrive in times of triumph and apparent social progress, to say nothing of when these movements instrumentalize violence even for putatively noble ends.\n\nCan we find it in ourselves to accept this thought: that I am the only Antichrist who needs to be overcome for peace to reign in the world? I dare to believe that if only one person could do this, and truly believe it, then their light would be irresistible and the ages would be transfigured, and God would be all in all.\n\nDaniel Nicholas (Ashland OR)\n\n__________________\n\nJul. 24, 2020\n\n[The following letter responds to our Do Black Lives Matter? Our Bishops Respond of June 7, 2020.]\n\nI don’t think that any Orthodox Christian denies that we should love ALL of our neighbors as we love ourselves and that we are all children of G-d.\n\nHowever, the Eastern Orthodox Church teaches us that we do NOT bear the guilt of original sin, although we suffer the consequences. While bearing the guilt of our personal sins, we also do NOT bear the guilt of the sins of our ancestors—parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, all the way down our lineage.\n\nWhile keeping our Orthodox Christian duty in mind, we should be very wary of falling into the trap of supporting politically correct “social justice” organizations that have their basis in the lies of godless Marxism. Unfortunately, the legitimate movement for social/racial justice in our country has been hijacked by blatant Marxist movements like Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA.\n\nAs a Russian Orthodox Christian I am very much aware of the misery, suffering, and death brought upon Holy Orthodox Mother Russia by the godless Marxists for seventy-four years. The Bolsheviks of today are so emboldened that they do not even mask their intent and openly trumpet their agenda on their websites.\n\nMike Tereshko (St. Paul MN)\n\n__________________\n\nJun. 28, 2020\n\nThe blessing of the Lord be upon you.

Father Josiah is certainly qualified to apply for the position but he never applied and was not one of the twelve candidates who did apply. Your sources are wrong and the implication that this seminary had no choice but to remove him from consideration is a lie.\n\nPlease remove this “fake news” from the article. I will be tracking it closely to see how quickly you respond to my request to not falsely associate St. Vladimir’s Seminary with your article.\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\nGreetings from a non-Orthodox Christian believer.\n\nLet me just say that I was like many former Evangelicals who convert to Orthodoxy. You could say I am not unlike Rod Dreher in that I converted to Catholicism, but after the abuse scandals I did not seek greener pastures in the Orthodox Church. I went to the Anglican Church. There I found a Church struggling with different issues and trying to incorporate gays and others who have been marginalized. It’s not perfect there, of course.\n\nI have looked at Orthodoxy, but am wary of what sounds too good to be true. I found Father Trenham and Rod Dreher and thought something seemed to be off with them. In Orthodox web forums any criticism, no matter how innocent, is censured. You can’t criticize anything Orthodox or you’re out.\n\nOrthodoxy in Dialogue is great. Keep up the good work. If more Orthodox people were like you I would convert to Orthodoxy. The Church has always been a home to people with disparate opinions gathered together to worship God. Many Orthodox have made an idol of their Church, and while they habitually scrutinize other faiths, they never scrutinize their own.\n\nMark Ortega (Bronx NY)\n\n__________________\n\nApr. 27, 2020\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 8, 2020\n\nDaniel Nicholas’ words in After Tradition: Choosing the Life of the Spirit over Lifeless Conformism resonated with me: “It is in these ‘wilderness’ moments, when we feel most disoriented, that disentangling the content of the faith from its context may be most necessary.”\n\nIt is exactly that wilderness that I am going through now.\n\nFor example, I do not believe in the ritual impurity of either sex, just because there is an issue of reproductive materials from the body. And I frankly do not care what “holy (t)radition” says on this matter.\n\nHe that is the Author of all life made the menstruation cycle as well. By His taking on of flesh, Christ has cleansed all things of the taint of the Law, taboos, and superstition; so what God has cleansed let no one call unclean.\n\nGood Lord, I could go on, but won’t for now.\n\nWilderness, you say? Wasn’t a voice heard from there once?\n\nGood job, Daniel Nicholas.\n\nSubdeacon Michael Day (Columbia MD)\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 8, 2020\n\nWhat you have experienced with Facebook [see “Temporarily” Thrown off Facebook?] strongly resembles what many patriotic Ukrainian bloggers have gone through, and I suspect that the mechanics behind the incident may be the same. Russian (Russian Orthodox) trolls flood Facebook with complaints about offensive/hateful content. Facebook moderators err on the side of caution (cowardice), and someone’s page is gone.\n\nCoincidentally, you recently criticized authors of “Russian Faith” [see Englewood Sure Knows How to Pick ‘Em: Antiochian Priest Feeds His Family by Bashing “Trannies, Homos, and Wife-Swappers” from the Safety of His Russian Hideaway], which to me seems like an offshoot of the Russian “Orthodox” propaganda machine in the US. And that was in addition to your courageous defence of the Ukrainian Church…. So, I am not surprised.\n\nMay God give you strength in your noble endeavors. Even though on occasion I disagree with you, I admire your courage and your love-inspired work.\n\nVyacheslav (Slava) Karpov (Kalamazoo MI)\n\nProfessor of Sociology, Western Michigan University\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 7, 2020\n\nYou should shut your sham-show down.\n\nJohn Milbank (Nottingham UK)\n\n__________________\n\nFeb. 7, 2020\n\nDaniel Nicholas’ After Tradition: Choosing the Life of the Spirit over Lifeless Conformism is very timely and pertinent, especially for those of us struggling with the question of Orthodox identity in a country which is not Orthodox by tradition.\n\nOne point worth adding is that, it seems to me, the concept of Tradition, which is a process of handing on or passing on, is inseparable from evangelization in the broad sense of carrying out the “great commission,” when Christ commands His disciples: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit” (Mt 28:19).\n\nTradition is not an icebox where things are preserved and frozen for all time, not a museum, nor a long corridor closed at both ends. It is, or should be, more like throwing s stone in a pond and seeing the ripples spread out. In this sense the Orthodox Church needs to reconnect with its raison d’être, its fundamental mission. This it will do only when it ceases to make an idol out of Tradition.\n\nJames Chater (Avallon, France)\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 31, 2020\n\nI read Suddenly I’m Afraid in horror, shame, and concern for Giacomo Sanfilippo.

Christopher Mathews, M.D., MSPH (San Diego CA)\n\nProfessor Emeritus of Clinical Medicine\n\nDirector, UCSD Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Clinical Core\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 31, 2020\n\nBefore coming to Orthodoxy, I ran from any churches which smacked of fundamentalism, anything Calvinist, or which promoted the subjugation of women or allowed anyone to be abused. I no longer believed that anyone who’s not a Christian or who doesn’t follow all the “rules” of a particular sect automatically goes to Hell.\n\nI came to Orthodoxy on the promise of a mystical theology which allows the possibility of even non-Christians to go to Heaven. Of a God of love and mercy. That even the “wrath of God” is a human term to describe consequences of our own actions, not a raging God. And the women of my church are hardly an example of meekness.\n\nOrthodoxy was also presented to me as using oikonomia, following the spirit and not the letter of the law, capable of recognizing when small-t traditions are manmade and don’t have to be followed, rather than Catholic legalism.\n\nTrenham [see Josiah Trenham: The Scandal in our Archives 2020 for context] would put us back under the horrors of the Protestant fundamentalist churches that I ran from. It sounds like he’s bringing in the tyranny of the Calvinist Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, which is driving many women out of Evangelical churches.\n\nWas I a victim of a bait-and-switch? The kind of thing promoted by Trenham has no resemblance to what I’ve seen of Orthodoxy in the fourteen years I’ve been in my local parish.\n\nI can’t believe that Trenham’s version is the real “Orthodoxy,” but converts from fundamentalist churches trying to bring poison from their old churches into Orthodoxy, rather than embracing the God of love and mercy.\n\nIn listening as well to what he has said about homosexuality, it sounds like a bunch of fear-mongering, ignoring the fact that perversions also abound among heterosexuals, making people afraid of those who simply want to live chastely and be allowed to marry the person they are in love with.\n\nMarriage between a gay man and a straight woman, for example, can never reach the passionate love that most people want in a marriage. Both would be ultimately unsatisfied, leading in many cases to infidelity. Yet we’re told this is the only option for homosexuals. [See, for instance, Father John Whiteford’s Appalling Ignorance and Pastoral Malfeasance.]\n\nWe know a lot more now about sexuality than we did 2000 years ago. We also know more about science, leading to the acceptance of evolution and non-abortive birth control. Why stay stuck in 2000-year-old ideas about sexuality and gender? I’ve read the Bible numerous times, and Jesus never said that homosexuality is wrong. That came from other writers, most of them during the same time that people were told not to mix linen and wool or eat shellfish. Yet Christians mix fabric all the time without a thought, and shellfish is allowed us even during Lent.\n\nEsther Robinson (Fond du Lac WI)\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 31, 2020\n\nWe don’t want sexual degeneracy in the Church, thank you very much.

He hides behind a number of anonymous websites and email accounts where he presumes to use an icon of St. John of Kronstadt as his avatar and describes himself as follows: Monarchist, traditionalist, nationalist, anti-Zionist. Future convert to Eastern Orthodoxy. Against both capitalism and communism and in favour of agrarianism and localism. Generation Zyklon. Zyklon was apparently a 19th-century pesticide later used by the Nazis as one method among many to exterminate Jews: this makes Steadfast Reactionary XII’s “anti-Zionism” a euphemism for the most extreme and dangerous anti-Semitism. He sent his letter in the midst of a concerted internet onslaught directed against Orthodoxy in Dialogue over the past few days by anonymous trolls in defense of Father Josiah Trenham, his “teaching,” and his “preaching.”\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 31, 2020\n\n[This letter responds to Karen Prescott, author of the letter below dated 1/26/20.]\n\nYou open your letter with, “Orthodox Christians, of which you are not, don’t take your articles or website seriously.” Yet here you are. Thanks for sharing your insight with us, in judging those of us who read and support Orthodoxy in Dialogue, that we are not Orthodox Christians.\n\nThanks also for the smile you gave me when I read the rest of your letter, especially “you rewrite church and biblical beliefs to accommodate your agendas.”\n\nBiblical beliefs like “Judge not, lest you be judged,” or “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” or, God forbid, “Love your neighbour as yourself.” And let’s not forget, with the last quote, that Christ elaborated on a working definition of who my neighbour is: those demonic Samaritans! As noted in John’s Gospel, “The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” Of course, there was nothing demonic about Samaritans, but our Lord was so playful and really loved to mess up the heads of His disciples (and our own) that He showed us the way to enter into His Divine Life by experiencing the Love that He is, with His Father and Spirit. Love of the Other (and, in your case, perhaps the homosexual, transgender, or whatever you decide) could be a road leading to your divinisation within Christ?\n\nTry embracing the diversity and beauty within our Lord’s creation and not the narrow strictures you seem to be imposing on yourself.\n\nTheodoros Lambros (Sydney, Australia)\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 30, 2020\n\nLast week I was introduced to your website after a conversation I had with my husband over our concerns with the present climate of Orthodoxy. How grateful I am to have found Orthodoxy in Dialogue! That night I pored over the website for hours, dug into the archives, and was heartened by what I was reading. Surprised that what I had been longing for—thoughtful dialogue on current issues—was right there.\n\nI’ve seen too many people leave Orthodoxy because they’ve dared to ask meaningful questions and have been discouraged from thinking differently from whatever popular Orthodox online media outlets present as “true Orthodoxy.” Orthodoxy, which was feeling dead, is now feeling alive to me again. Glowing embers have been stirred. I feel hopeful and less alone knowing that there are others out there who want to see Orthodoxy engage with the world.\n\nI have already told many people about Orthodoxy in Dialogue. It’s a valuable resource—one I hope you keep going in spite of the attacks I know you receive.\n\nThank you for what you’re doing.\n\nJihan Nicholas (Harker Heights TX)\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 28, 2020\n\nI read your Review: That All Shall Be Saved: Heaven, Hell, and Universal Salvation with great interest.

[See our Review: That All Shall Be Saved: Heaven, Hell, and Universal Salvation.] That is something that too many academic and quasi-academic Orthodox scholars do unchallenged. The mark of expertise is specialist publication, from which in this instance it can be said without fear of contradiction that Hart is a philosophical theologian and/or religious philosopher. He is not regarded as a patristics scholar by specialists at work in the field.\n\nAs to his style, it is by design pyrotechnical and tendentious. I find reading his publications is wearying—not because they are too sophisticated to understand (they aren’t). They are wearying because the bluster typically distracts from the lack of underlying rigour.\n\nAs a general matter, I presume that clarity, simplicity, and directness are the hallmarks of profound knowledge.

Trenham. Now.] regarding the so-called need for Metropolitan Joseph to SILENCE Father Josiah, and, I call, “BOGUS!” This article drips with a leftist-leaning and mushy-modern sentiment.\n\nFather Josiah is absolutely a hard-liner. He speaks in unambiguous terms about many issues—the encroachment of Islam in the US and elsewhere, the scourge of abortion in this nation and throughout the world, and the legal affirmation of same-sex lifestyles as normative and good.\n\nIf this (scared-to-give-his-name) clergyman wants to specify where Father Josiah is wrong, he should do so—openly, and with the opportunity for the accused to respond.\n\n[NB: In fact “the accused” has never asked Orthodoxy in Dialogue to publish anything from him.]\n\nAs this article stands, the accuser makes broad brush condemnations of Father Josiah’s unloving, hateful, violence-inciting, non-Orthodox, etc., etc., errors that should have had him SILENCED years ago.\n\nWHY DO ALL LEFTISTS ESCHEW OPEN DEBATE AND DIALOGUE, WHILE ADVOCATING CENSORSHIP AND THE STOPPING OF EARS?\n\nWHY?!!!\n\nI may have never referred to any of these hot-button issues in the same manner as Father Josiah. But, I would bleed and die fighting for his right to do so—and doing so IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS ORTHODOX PRIESTHOOD.\n\nNothing mentioned regarding the content of Father Josiah’s perspectives on these issues was proven completely false, unloving, unorthodox, or as a cause of harm. Those assertions were just repeated over and over in this article, and that somehow made them more clearly so (I knew I was facing a storm of ad hominem accusations when I got five or six paragraphs into the article and NO ACTUAL INCIDENTS OR STATEMENTS WERE CITED).\n\nNever forget, many (THE Many) turned away from our Lord when He taught about the most sensitive subjects of His day (the eating of His Flesh and Blood, His going to the Cross for our sake, and His clear instruction that he, as Messiah, was NOT leading an insurrection against the Romans). Many in Israel continued to persecute and murder the Apostles and disciples for speaking about this Crucified One, and (note; the Forerunner) for speaking out against sexual immorality (“It is not lawful for you to have her as wife!”).\n\nThe author of this article, on the other hand, says that whenever a person gets offended at Father Josiah, it is FATHER JOSIAH’S FAULT. Every person who leaves the Church did so BECAUSE OF FATHER JOSIAH! And, every use of harsh terms IS CLEARLY NOT CHRISTIAN!\n\nHas this priest read the words of the Lord, His Apostles, the Prophets, the Forerunner? Or was all that reading filtered through a perspective that focuses on “feeding the poor and the needy,” and, protesting racism, slavery, misogyny, raining down bombs on children, and the oppression of indigenous peoples?\n\nThere are times and places for dealing with all such issues (helpful hint: not everyone thinks a bigger government subsidizing program and a deeper national guilt is the answer for these problems).\n\nFather Josiah was NOT addressing those other issues. He was addressing sexual immorality as he sees addressed in Holy Scripture, throughout holy history, and in his study of the Church and her Fathers.\n\nIf this anonymous priest (or whatever) wants to have those more left-leaning perspectives preached, THEN HE SHOULD PREACH THEM!\n\nBut, he should ABSOLUTELY NOT advocate the muzzling of another priest’s views, while hiding in the shadows of anonymity, and not even showing the “wrongness” of that priest’s views.\n\nAnd, NO!!!\n\nFather Josiah saying words that hurt other people’s feelings does NOT constitute being wrong, being unloving, being un-Christian, or being non-Orthodox in one’s teachings.\n\nAnd, if anyone wants to have these kinds of “opposings,” at least OPPOSE HIM TO HIS FACE!\n\nThe Apostle Paul did so to the chief of the Apostles, Peter.\n\nBut when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. (Gal 2:11)\n\nWhy this author and this website felt the need to snipe from the shadows is beyond me!\n\nIt smacks of cowardice, really!\n\nDouglas B.

From experience, I know that those numbers will grow to the thousands before day’s end. Cumulatively, our articles on Father Trenham’s pastoral and theological malfeasance—while few in number compared to other subjects that we cover—constitute our readers’ second or third most popular topic.\n\nMy work as editor of Orthodoxy in Dialogue positions me to be almost daily on the receiving end of confidences, inquiries, and appeals for clarity and spiritual support from people around the world, both Orthodox and outside of our Church, many of whom have been deeply wounded by priests such as Father Trenham and the silence of our hierarchs. The brief stories that these latter have shared with me only confirm the more detailed narrative provided by the clergy author of our Open Letter.\n\nRespectfully I encourage Your Eminence to order all of Father Trenham’s internet content taken down from wherever it appears—Ancient Faith, Patristic Nectar, YouTube, etc.—until it can be thoroughly evaluated for its appropriateness and its consistency with the Orthodox faith; to have Father Trenham issue a retraction and apology to be published by Orthodoxy in Dialogue and the AOCA website (as Father Warwick was ordered to do); and to communicate your awareness and handling of this troubling situation with our readers. Orthodoxy in Dialogue stands at the ready to publish whatever words of reassurance you submit to us.\n\nOur Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, whose incarnation unto our deification we have just celebrated, was never profiled by a Hatewatch Staff, nor has His Church, Body, and Bride ever been designated a hate group.\n\nThe world is watching and placing its hope in your paternal care for us.\n\nThe unworthy servant of Christ,\n\nGiacomo Sanfilippo (Toronto ON)\n\nEditor, Orthodoxy in Dialogue\n\nThe above was emailed to Metropolitan Joseph, the AOCA Chancery, Ancient Faith Ministries, and Father Trenham earlier this morning.\n\n__________________\n\nJan. 11, 2020\n\nJan. 11, 2020\n\nI must oppose everything in Abortion, Contraception, and Christian Faith and Orthodoxy in Dialogue on Abortion.

It seems they have changed jurisdiction several times. (See Russian Backtracking in Relation to Aspropyrgos “Metochion” in Attica at Orthodox Times.) The monasteries in Switzerland, Norway, Germany, and Italy were founded by the Greek Archimandrite Dionysios Kalampokas, who is under interdiction in the Church of Greece and the Patriarchates of Jerusalem and Constantinople. Their last juridiction was the Church of Georgia. The monasteries in Norway were released by the Georgian Patriarchate in March 2016. (See Monastic Warning: The Georgian Patriarchate Excludes the Cult. [Editor’s note: While this report reads almost like an excommunication, the actual letter on Patriarchate letterhead releases them and recommends that they place themselves under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.])\n\nSuddenly, on Thursday, December 17, this list disappeared and was replaced with a smaller one, without the ten mysterious sketes and monasteries.\n\nOn December 19, a communiqué appeared, stating that the Archdiocese has accepted, after a meeting of the Archdiocesan Council on Friday, December 13, to grant “canonical hospitality” to these communities. The communiqué explains that they had been under Georgia, but the Ecumenical Patriarchate had put pressure on the Georgian Church to release them. For this reason Georgia gave them a canonical release, “to attach themselves to Constantinople or to any canonical Church.”\n\nThe removal of the list from the website is explained as follows: Metropolitan John had granted these communities only temporary hospitality in the Archdiocese while they undergo examination by an ad hoc committee. (But why had they been listed there before, may we ask?)\n\nNevertheless, your comment on the Archdiocese’s trespass of the canonical territory of the Church of Greece retains its pertinence. It seems to be a part of a set of problematic decisions by Metropolitan John, probably under the guidance of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nA question which I cannot help asking is this: Was Metropolitan John acting on his own accord (with the support of what he calls “the Council”), and was he really moved by pastoral interest and care (in a rather clumsy way), or does he simply want to increase the number of candidates for auxiliary bishops? Or is it an example of Moscow politics to assign “dirty work” to him, that is, to contribute even more to the division between the Orthodox Churches?\n\nAlexandra de Moffarts (Brussels, Belgium)\n\n__________________\n\n[The following eight letters were sent in response to Trump Administration Invites Patriarch Bartholomew to Speak on…the Environment? and Have Your Say: What Would You Like Patriarch Bartholomew to Say to Donald Trump?.]\n\nDec. 9, 2019\n\nI think Patriarch Bartholomew’s planned visit to Washington provides an excellent opportunity for His All-Holiness to point out to Donald Trump and to the world the devastating effects of having ignored the message of Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth for all these years.\n\nOn peace, Thomas Merton said, “The root of all war is fear.” Need I say more? Trump’s decisions are all based on fear: fear of the enemy, and fear of losing money and/or economic power.\n\nThe whole problem with Trump is spiritual, or rather a lack of spirituality. For me spirituality is based on being honest with myself, accepting the consequences of this honesty, and taking responsibility for myself and my deeds.\n\nHow to bring this message across to Trump I have no idea. Hopefully His All-Holiness has some idea.\n\nThe core problem of Trump is that he cannot take any criticism, which leads to denial and sheer lying. I think it is ironic he has invited the Patriarch. He probably knows he is called the Green Patriarch. I would not be surprised if he has invited him to try to make a good impression internationally.\n\nThe Patriarch should point out to Trump how irresponsible his behaviour is in withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, abandoning the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and demanding increased defense investments from other countries. Stepping out of the nuclear agreement with Iran has made the Middle East and the world as whole a more dangerous place. Through his economic policies he is increasing the perverse gap between poor and rich.\n\nIt is a daunting task for the Patriarch. Both His All-Holiness and Trump need our prayers.\n\nVincent van Buuren (Haarlem, Netherlands)\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 7, 2019\n\nThank you so much for the opportunity to give my opinion on this very important question.\n\nMy gut reflex was no. Then, I thought hard about how to possibly turn this into a positive.\n\nSince we know Trump is only using Patriarch Bartholomew for any possible election advantage he can muster, I say let the Patriarch speak—to condemn every infraction Trump has imposed upon people and planet alike, and to do so with authority and clarity. For now is the time for boldness!\n\nCynthia Gallion (Raleigh NC)\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 7, 2019\n\nUsing Christ’s teaching that we are not to judge others, I will firstly state that I do not know the mind or heart of your President.\n\nI have two comments which I hope will be useful: one for not attending, and one for attending.\n\n1. From what I have seen and heard of President Trump, I would say that unless Patriarch Bartholomew is prepared to speak truth to power, he would do well to decline the offer, simply stating that the timing might be viewed as a political endorsement and so he must decline. This way offers no offense.\n\n2. One reason for going: Christ gives us an example that many Christians fail to grasp. He spoke to/mixed with/taught the tax collectors. In so doing, Christ makes it clear that we are to engage with those who are failing to reflect His image or do not agree with us.\n\nBy attending, the Patriarch steps through the opened door and grasps the opportunity to convert President Trump on climate change.\n\nHis All-Holiness is not a fool. Yet he must be on his guard. He could use this opportunity to bring the Holy Spirit into Trump’s life. The outcome could be an opportunity to create great good for the planet and the creatures on it, but also, the opportunity for this man to turn from his present path.\n\nI will pray that His All-Holiness make the right decision,\n\nDr. Christina Nellist (Winchester UK)\n\nAuthor, Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Animal Suffering: Ancient Voices in Modern Theology\n\nEditor, Pan-Orthodox Concern for Animals\n\nEditor’s note: Dr. Nellist is referenced in Aidan Hart’s The Making of a New Icon: “Christ Breaking the Bonds of Animal Suffering”.\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 6, 2019\n\nThe possible visit by Patriarch Bartholomew to the White House will certainly have political import, but I doubt whether it will be significant. His All-Holiness should make the decision to attend closer to the date, and dependent on a few things such as any actions by the current White House occupant which the Patriarch may not want to endorse, whether he has his own important message to convey regardless of political winds, and regarding any local pressure not to attend.\n\nI have long admired the Green Patriarch, but doubt that his environmental activism plays any role in the invitation. I doubt the Ukrainian Orthodox split with the Russian Church plays any role, or purported moves by the Russian Church to bolster their presence in Turkey. I doubt this is pushback by the US against Turkey for their invasion of Syria.\n\nMore likely, this invitation is a response to the likely pressure the White House will get next year from their opponents because of Trump’s Muslim immigration ban, and plays to Trump’s significant anti-Muslim constituency.\n\nIt also shows the sharp contrast between the Ecumenical Patriarchate’s small, vulnerable presence in an overwhelmingly Muslim country versus the easy immigration of Muslims policy of most Western European countries, which Trump probably hates.\n\nSo, the invitation plays to Trump’s base and his immigration policies, but I would leave it up to His All-Holiness to make a final decision considering all the factors at play closer to the time of the visit.\n\nJohn Munter (Warba MN)\n\nMember, St. Michael’s Serbian Orthodox Church\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 6, 2019\n\nThe only reason that His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew would have to visit Mr. Trump would be to share his wisdom on the role that the Orthodox Church and all of humanity have to protect God’s beautiful creation.\n\nMr. Trump’s environmental policies which promote the degradation of the creation and our global climate are anathema to what our beloved Patriarch teaches us about being environmental stewards. Mr. Trump’s policies are putting children and families across the globe, especially those living in poverty, at risk from climate-related disasters and disease.\n\nIf we are to expect any changes to improve the health and humanity of children, which is of course an essential core of our responsibilities as Christians, then the leadership of our Archdiocese should be extremely cautious about how it conducts and publicizes meetings with this White House, lest these meetings give the impression of condoning Mr. Trump’s environmental destruction.\n\nWhile I understand that the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese has been aligned with the Republican Party because of its historically conservative policies, this current administration has been inhumane to the most vulnerable among us. The Orthodox Observer’s depiction of a photograph of Archbishop Elpidophoros with Mr. Trump earlier this fall, praising Mr. Trump’s treatment of Christians around the world, eroded my trust in our Church’s ability to keep us separated from the hunger for alignment with secular power.\n\nWhat would a Patriarch Bartholomew-Donald Trump meeting or photo op convey to Orthodox Christians?\n\nWhat would Christ say to Mr. Trump regarding his disregard of climate change while children around the world are literally burning and drowning to death?\n\nMaria Karapelou Brown, MD, EdM, FAAP (Baltimore MD)\n\nPediatrician and Children’s Environmental Health Advocate\n\nMember, Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 6, 2019\n\nI had the great honor of meeting Patriarch Bartholomew during the June 2018 Green Attica Symposium in Greece. I am writing to express my hope that His All-Holiness will decline any invitation to meet with President Trump. I do not wish the Patriarch’s moral stature to be exploited by a political leader who has so swiftly and systematically dismantled protections on God’s creation and who continues to conduct an all-out assault on the sacred web of life.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Margaret Bullitt-Jonas (Northampton MA)\n\nMissioner for Creation Care\n\nEpiscopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts Conference, United Church of Christ\n\nEditor’s note: See Dr. Bullitt-Jonas’ bio at Reviving Creation.\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 5, 2019\n\nDonald Trump cannot be trusted. He has hurt people, places, and the marvelous animals of our beloved and beautiful planet over and over again without showing any signs of remorse. Indeed, he seems to relish the thought that this suggests he is tough—and standing strong beside the greed and callousness that promotes this behavior.\n\nPatriarch Bartholomew is, we trust, far too smart to be taken in by a person who will take advantage of any situation without regard for the truth or dignity that might be compromised as a result.\n\nPlease tell the Patriarch to wait to celebrate our National Restoration Day—taking place after the 2020 election because we will have elected, with God’s help, an individual who will be a true steward, and worthy of His All-Holiness’ attention.\n\nLise Van Susteren, MD (Washington DC)\n\nBoard Certified: General and Forensic Psychiatry\n\nEditor’s note: See Dr. Van Susteren’s bio at Climate for Health for her clinical focus on the mental health effects of climate change and her record of climate change activism and other philanthropic initiatives.\n\n__________________\n\nDec. 3, 2019\n\nThank you for publishing Trump Administration Invites Patriarch Bartholomew to Speak on…the Environment? and Have Your Say: What Would You Like Patriarch Bartholomew to Say to Donald Trump?.\n\nPatriarch Bartholomew probably already knows that Donald Trump is functionally an atheist. His religious coating is only for public relations, and this is true for a large percentage of those in Congress. If they have positions on moral and ethical issues, it is primarily for public relations purposes.\n\nFor the Patriarch’s meeting with Donald Trump, a polite discourse about responsibility for the future would be important, including some mention of how virtually all of organized religion in America is concerned about the urgency of climate change. (See my Religion and Global Climate Change: A Handbook for Faith Leaders and Climate Activists.)\n\nPatriarch Bartholomew has been strong and emphatic about the importance of addressing global climate change. This should be his theme in his public remarks in May, as this is the most crucial issue facing America. This is also an issue which the Orthodox bishops in the US have addressed in strong terms. By taking this approach, the Patriarch will speak with integrity to his past statements and address an issue on which President Trump can learn and which the American people need to hear.\n\nAs background, I previously worked as a campaign manager for the Republican National Committee and am knowledgeable about the Congress.

What is the point of that?\n\nWe in Africa are living on a knife edge as the Ukrainian schism spreads, apparently throughout the Orthodox world. Planning services is provisional, depending on the state of the schism.\n\nIt seems to me that the article published by Orthodoxy in Dialogue comes pretty close to “hate speech,” and certainly is provoking hatred among people like the one who posted the link to the article on Facebook.\n\nThe Ukrainian schism is threatening to become the worst schism since 1054, possibly even worse. Soon we will be reaching the point where we will have to say, “I believe in two holy, catholic and apostolic churches,” and Orthodox mission will be at an end, because which of the two churches will you invite people who are interested in Orthodoxy to join?\n\nIn these circumstances, how can Orthodoxy in Dialogue seek to heal the schism rather than exacerbate it?\n\nDeacon Stephen Hayes, DTh (Tshwane, South Africa)\n\nEditor’s note: Most Orthodox mission in Africa is conducted under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which has recently recognized the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine.\n\n__________________\n\nNov. 17, 2019\n\nWhen I saw today’s article with the “icon” of Putin, I laughed: Surely it was a ruse.

On that note, though, tell me, how many Central Americans have you personally provided shelter for?\n\nIn fact, let me wager that you’re personally more committed to shirking God’s will for human sexuality than you’ll ever be concerned for the plight of a single refugee, asylum seeker, or economic migrant.

I do not agree with Daniel Struve’s assessment of it [in the letter immediately preceding this one]. There is nothing “natural” or “inevitable” about the return of the rue Daru Archdiocese to the Moscow Patriarchate. It is a step backward. Too much water has flowed under the bridge since 1929, when the Archdiocese left the Moscow Patriarchate for Constantinople.\n\nMany people with no personal links to Russia have joined the Archdiocese and thrived in its multi-national character. For these people, enracinement—putting down roots in the local, West European soil—is important; whereas, for certain Russians and other East Europeans, maintaining links with the mother country is considered more important. The Archdiocese was a delicate alliance between these two groups, which has broken down under the impact of recent events.\n\nThe reason for the break of 1929 was that it became impossible to have meaningful communication with a church that had no independent voice or freedom because of Communist control.\n\nMany, including myself, would argue that a similar situation exists today, the main difference being that the Russian government does not seek to destroy the Church, as it did back then, but merely to subvert it, turning it into an instrument of state power.\n\nDe Moffarts’ article is written in the context of a double scourge affecting the Church in Western Europe: Moscow’s rupture with Constantinople [over Ukrainian autocephaly], followed shortly after by the Ecumenical Patriarchate’s brutal and sudden decision to rescind the tomos from the Archdiocese of rue Daru.\n\nIt is impossible to overestimate the disaffection and, yes, contempt, with which Orthodox hierarchs are held by Orthodox in the West. For these people, among whom I include myself, hierarchy is division, plain and simple.\n\nIt is urgent that the jurisdictional overlaps and duplications that caused this mess should be speedily addressed. Tragically, there is little prospect of this happening in the near future.\n\nJames Chater (Avallon, France)\n\n__________________\n\nNov. 9, 2019\n\nAlexandra de Moffarts’ Quo Vadis, rue Daru? is indeed a very subjective and highly biased view of the situation, full of confusion.\n\nShe writes, “From here on, we move in a kind of surreal split, where it is difficult for many to discern who is in and who is out, and where and what the Archdiocese really is.”\n\nThis is not my impression at all.\n\nThere are differences, of course, but they are very clear, and a large majority of the clergy and of the flock followed Archbishop John (Renneteau) to the Moscow Patriarchate, even if some did it reluctantly.\n\nThe reasons are simple:\n\n1. The alternative was dissolution and spoliation by Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (Ecumenical Patriarchate).\n\n2. The Moscow Patriarchate created the Archdiocese at first (in 1921), and has been insisting on our return for years. The problem was pending and was dividing the Archdiocese. Patriarch Bartholomew’s November 2018 decision settled the question, giving us the necessary impulse to make the change. In this sense it was a welcome and a sage decision, even it it shouldn’t have been presented in such a brutal way. All the Ecumenical Patriarchs until Demetrios always thought and said that some day we should return to the MP. There are many problems in the MP, of course (and some in the EP…). But then our very existence is closely linked to the Russian tragedy.\n\nThose who left the Archdiocese on this occasion may feel disoriented, and it will probably take some time for them to be integrated in their new ecclesiastical environment. But these events appear to me on the whole as a clarification, far from the confusion described by de Moffarts.\n\nShe writes about “fighting over our affairs in court—with, perhaps, no real chance to win against Moscow.” Actually, there were some threats of this kind from the Greek Metropolis of France, but nothing has emerged yet. If someone fights in courts, it will be Metropolitan Emmanuel, and the fight will be against the Archdiocese (“rue Daru”), not against “Moscow.”\n\nI can’t imagine on what grounds the Greek Metropolis of France should have any claim on the properties of the Archdiocese.\n\nDaniel Struve (Paris)\n\n__________________\n\nOct. 18, 2019\n\nWhat you post in Orthodoxy in Dialogue is most certainly food for thought, both pro and contra. Being new to the site, I did not know the length and breadth of the problems that are discussed, railed about, and so forth. However, in reflection on my time in the Orthodox Church and my past experiences as a seminarian, I am not surprised by any of it.\n\nOn the matter of masculinity and femininity we have the Deisis to teach us, where perfect humanity of both men and women is embodied in Christ; perfect femininity is embodied in the Theotokos; and perfect masculinity is embodied in John the Forerunner. Thus, all the poles of human sexuality are included. Those he-men priests you spoke of [here and here] should reflect on the icons they would otherwise so heartily defend.\n\nYet, should not the masculine also say “Be it done unto me according to Thy word”? Should not the feminine also be a “voice crying in the wilderness”?\n\nApparently, things are not so neat and tidy as we would like.\n\nMichael Day (Columbia MD)\n\n__________________\n\nJul. 20, 2019\n\nI am E.

Would romantic love between two straight people be reduced in the same way?\n\nI was taught—not simply in words but by example—that in a healthy romantic relationship between two human beings (note the wording there), sharing sexual intimacy is an expression of that love. People who obsess over the sexual habits of others reveal their own obsessions, which are, ironically enough, unhealthy.\n\nAnd also, it is none of my business how sexuality is expressed at those intimate moments—that’s why they are intimate—insofar as it is a healthy, mutual expression of love.\n\nThank you and keep up the good work!\n\nJoshua Sellers (Rochester NY)\n\n__________________\n\nJul. 13, 2019\n\nThank you, with all my heart, for posting This Weekend #ProtectEachOther from ICE and the announcement it contains!

It makes a lot of peremptory demands that the bishops follow current fashions in secular thought, without even attempting to give a theological reason for this.\n\nMaking peremptory demands that people “cease” doing things that most of them have probably never even thought of doing does not look like dialogue to me—it smacks of prejudice, and even bigotry rather than a desire for dialogue.\n\nI have seen very few, if any, pronouncements on morality from Orthodox bishops of the kind that the web page is demanding that they stop making.\n\nIt makes me wonder—where should Orthodox Christians get their moral compass—their sense of right and wrong?

We are in a New World order of fear, racism, and hate, in which some of our own clergy are involved in the most despicable ways. I hope that more of our hierarchy and clergy will have the courage to speak out on this inhumane behaviour.\n\nSome of our people are just fine with this because these refugees have brown skin instead of white. I have had encounters before with so-called “pro-lifers” who have a fixation on the unborn, but absolutely do not care for the already born. They accuse anyone who cares about already born children as being socialists or leftists. What does this say for our moral condition as Christians?\n\nArchbishop Lazar (Puhalo)\n\nRetired, Orthodox Church in America\n\n__________________\n\nMay 16, 2018\n\nI have just read Adam DeVille’s review of Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life. Although I am in no way competent to judge whether the book is beneficial in any way, I do want to say something about the book review itself: it seems less of an actual review than a biased polemic against Peterson. I must say, I have never read an “academic” review, or even an honest general review, that went to such lengths to simply say that something is garbage. It’s not really a review, is it? It’s just book-bashing.\n\nI have recently gotten into Peterson and am attempting to understand him. What is obvious to me at this point is that Peterson is a thinker. It’s too early in the game for me to decide what, if any, redeemable qualities are a result of what he is thinking.\n\nI must say I am not certain someone with only an undergrad degree (DeVille) in psychology can produce a fair and sustained value judgment against Peterson. I understand full well DeVille has further degrees in philosophy and theology, but question whether he has the groundwork in psychology to critique Peterson with anything resembling non-biased precision. It’s quite obvious he cannot do it lovingly.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this review comes across as being angry the majority of the time and condescending at least part of the time. I highly doubt the review will serve any other purpose than to spur inquisitive people to listen to Peterson more attentively and read his work more thoroughly.\n\nI was looking at 12 Rules on Amazon last night and decided not to buy it. However, after reading DeVille’s over-the-top review, I am now compelled to purchase this book and everything else Peterson has written. All thanks to DeVille!\n\nS.

Thank you for posting it.\n\nWhile I think Mr. Dreher makes many good points, I disagree with his conclusion about the inevitability of “progressivism” prevailing in the Orthodox Church through websites like yours. If we really trust the Orthodox Church as Christ’s true Body, I strongly believe we can also trust that the truths She has always taught about sexual morality will withstand the sexualized and secularized onslaught that modernity is trying to bring against Her. I also believe that truly open dialogue will help these truths to prevail in the Church.\n\nI would like to reinforce in particular one of Mr. Dreher’s good points—that of his identifying the tendency of “progressives” to quickly dismiss any conservative viewpoint as being “fundamentalist.” I very much hope you and your site are not repeating this completely unjust and highly flagrant mistake. Just because all traditionalists reject all sexual relations outside of marriage (as the Church always has done) does not mean that all traditionalists are “fundamentalists”—though of course, some of them are.\n\nI have the feeling that there may be some “progressive” Orthodox Christians who are convinced, or at least suspect, that I myself—and by extension, St. Tikhon’s Seminary as a whole—are “fundamentalist.”\n\nI frequently emphasize the dangers of fundamentalism/sectarianism in my Church History courses at St. Tikhon’s—especially when we talk about the rigorist early heresies of Montanism, Novatianism, and Donatism; when we study Protestantism and Islam; and when we discuss the Old Believers in Russia, ROCOR before the reconciliation with the Moscow Patriarchate in 2007, and modern-day Greek Old Calendarist groups.\n\nDavid C.

Through your work, theology has regained some of its dynamism—”theology in motion.” I have let other people know about your site.\n\nWishing you all a peaceful Holy Week and joyous, joyful Pascha.\n\nSusan Arida (Boston MA)\n\n__________________\n\nMar. 29, 2018\n\nMar. 21, 2018\n\nAgain my congratulations, this time to Aidan Hart for his “Icons and Culture: Transformation or Appropriation?” I’ve read nothing better in any language. He poses the questions, analyzes the issues, and makes judicious observations with admirable tact and conciseness. He strengthens the foundations for iconography’s future, which ill-inspired travesties like those of Brother Lentz were threatening to sap. I look forward to reading more of what Aidan has written. May God grant him many years.\n\nJohn J.
