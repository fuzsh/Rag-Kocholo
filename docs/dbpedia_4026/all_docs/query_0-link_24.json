        "text": "The two men met yesterday, January 14, and cordially discussed about the church. The Patriarch informed the Egyptian Prime Minister about the final phase of the historical St. George church renovation.\n\nMahlab praised the multifaceted work of Patriarch Theodore and assured him that the upcoming inauguration events will be placed under the auspices of the country’s President. He also stressed that the church – the only Rotunda in all of Middle East – is a symbol of friendship between the people of Egypt, Greece and Cyprus as well as a symbol of coexistence and respect between Christians and Muslims.\n\nThe Church of St. George in Cairo is the main Greek Orthodox church of Egypt. It was built in the 10th century on top of a Roman tower of the fortified town called Babylon, but the original structure was destroyed by a fire. The present church was built in 1904. The unique Church of St. George is the only round church found in Egypt and it is the seat of the Greek Patriarchate of Alexandria.\n\n…we do have a small request. More and more people visit Orthodoxy and the World website. However, resources for editorial are scarce. In comparison to some mass media, we do not make paid subscription. It is our deepest belief that preaching Christ for money is wrong.\n\nHaving said that, Pravmir provides daily articles from an autonomous news service, weekly wall newspaper for churches, lectorium, photos, videos, hosting and servers. Editors and translators work together towards one goal: to make our four websites possible - Pravmir.ru, Neinvalid.ru, Matrony.ru and Pravmir.com. Therefore our request for help is understandable.\n\nFor example, 5 euros a month is it a lot or little? A cup of coffee? It is not that much for a family budget, but it is a significant amount for Pravmir.\n\nIf everyone reading Pravmir could donate 5 euros a month, they would contribute greatly to our ability to spread the word of Christ, Orthodoxy, life's purpose, family and society."
