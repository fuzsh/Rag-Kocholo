        "text": "At the meeting of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on 11 October it was decided to change the leadership of the Patriarchal Exarchate of Africa. Instead of Metropolitan Leonid of Klin, Bishop Konstantin of Zaraisk was appointed to the post of acting Patriarchal Exarchate of Africa, the official website of the Russian Orthodox Church\n\n“In connection with the report received to His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia by His Holiness Metropolitan Leonid of Klin with a statement of reasons preventing him from fulfilling the duties of Patriarchal Exarch of Africa, to relieve Metropolitan Leonid of Klin from this position with gratitude for his labours and with retaining for him the temporary administration of the Yerevan-Armenian Diocese,” the ROC website reads\n\nMetropolitan Leonid of Klinsk has been serving in the Church since 1986. In 2004, he was appointed to the post of representative of the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia to the Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa. In 2021, the position was transformed and the Metropolitan became Patriarchal Exarch of Africa with the assignment of governing the North African Diocese and temporarily governing the South African Diocese\n\nBishop Konstantin of Zaraisk was born into a priest’s family, and was involved in Orthodox educational institutions: he was vice-rector of the Kolomna Theological Seminary, teaching theology, chairman of the department of religious education and catechesis of the Moscow diocese, rector of the Kolomna Theological Seminary, and others. In July 2022, he was elected an honorary member of the Moscow Theological Academy\n\nUntil 2019, the Russian Orthodox Church recognised the African continent as the exclusive canonical territory of the Patriarchate of Alexandria. However, after relations with the Patriarchate of Alexandria broke down due to the recognition of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (PCU), the Patriarchal Exarchate of Africa was established in 2021 by decision of the Synod. As of July 2023, communities of the exarchate operate in 25 countries of the African continent."
