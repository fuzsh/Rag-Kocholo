        "text": "1. Orthodox Christianity: the COPTIC ART of EGYPT AND NUBIA\n\nFrom an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, NY in 2023/24 of the links between Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity in Africa\n\nThis is the first exhibition of Byzantine links with Africa organized by the Met.\n\nThe Holy Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, the traditional site of Moses’ Burning Bush and the keeper of what is believed to be the oldest icon of Jesus Christ, loaned important pieces from its vast collection of icons, books and manuscripts.\n\nIts abbot gave a dedicatory blessing when this exhibition opened: a reminder that the objects loaned are not considered ‘art’ in their native civilizations.\n\nThey are sacred objects; they are invested with agency.\n\nThey sanctify the places where they are.\n\nThey provide sanctuary (temenos), instruction, and blessing to the faithful.\n\nThey are repositories of the wisdom tradition of the civilization in which they were made.\n\nTheir ‘artistic’ attributes serve these purposes and are subordinate to them.\n\nThe history of Christianity in north and north-East Africa is tied to the Byzantine empire and to the evolution of the Orthodox Church. This relationship was of more than 1500 years duration.\n\nThis period traversed the end of the Roman Empire, the transition from pre-Christian religious practices and beliefs to Christianity; and the emergence of Islam and the fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nImmediately below are some pre-Christian images and objects from north Africa, Egypt and Nubia in the first six centuries after the birth of Christ.\n\nMosaic with Preparations for a Feast, 4th quarter of the 2nd century; Carthage (Tunisia); marble, limestone, glass, paste.\n\nLoaned by the Musee du Louvre to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY in 2023/24\n\nMuseum guidance is that mosaics with such scenes decorated the walls or floors of wealthy houses throughout the North Africa, one of the richest parts of the Roman Empire.\n\nOne man carries a basket of fruit, another a tray of what looks like bread, a third a flagon of wine.\n\nConstantine the Great (272-337), ruler of the Roman empire, converted to Christianity in 312 and rebuilt Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, as his capital city.\n\nas above\n\nTheodosius (401-450), the last emperor to rule both the western and eastern Roman empires, confirmed Christianity as the state religion.\n\nMosaic with Lion Attacking Onager, Hadrumetum (Sousse, Tunisia), 150-200, stone, glass\n\nJ. Paul Getty museum loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY in 2023/24\n\nOver the next 2 centuries, the Western Roman empire disintegrated under external onslaught and internal rebellion.\n\nTextile Fragment with Diana (on the right) and Actaeon?, 5th-7th, linen and wool, tapestry and plain weave, Byzantine Egypt.\n\nBritish Museum loan to the Metropolitan Museum, NY in 2023/24\n\nThe Eastern – the Byzantine – stabilized under the rule of emperors who clarified, amidst much disputation, the tenets of Orthodoxy.\n\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Nubia and a number of other churches outside of Africa adhered only to the agreements of the first 3 of the 7 ecumenical councils which met under Roman and/or Byzantine aegis between 325 and 787.\n\nThe break with the Roman (Catholic) and with the Byzantine Orthodox churches came over a period of several hundred years.\n\nThe Orthodox churches in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and a number of other areas outside Africa are collectively referred to today as Oriental Orthodox Churches.\n\nThe ‘Coptic’ (from the ancient Greek name for Egypt) Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria governed also the church in Nubia. And the church in Ethiopia and Eritrea until 1959.\n\n————————\n\nEGYPT AND NORTH AFRICA\n\nThe tradition is that St. Mark brought Christianity to Egypt and established the church in Egypt in 46 CE.\n\nEgypt, a province of the Roman Empire until the 7th century, was its granary.\n\nShroud of a Woman Wearing a Fringed Tunic, 170-200 CE, tempera on linen.\n\nPerhaps from Antinopoulos, Egypt. Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY\n\nAntinopoulos was a predominantly Greek-speaking city founded by the Emperor Hadrian in 130. This woman, wearing much jewellery, is flanked by Egyptian gods.\n\nDuring this time and after, there were extensive diplomatic and trade links between Egypt and north Africa and the Byzantine area of control and influence in the eastern Mediterranean. There were exchanges with areas in sub-Saharan and West Africa and as far as the Silk Route and India.\n\nEgypt is the birthplace of the Christian monastic tradition in the fourth century. Saint Anthony the Great (Father of All Monks) was born and died in the Roman province of Egypt: 251-356).\n\nAn Egyptian Orthodox priest visiting the galleries during this exhibition\n\nThese contacts with the Byzantine empire continued after Moslem control of Egypt began in the 7th century. Egypt continued as an important producer of industrial and agricultural goods.\n\nPanel with Painted Image of Isis, 2nd century, tempera on wood, Egypt.\n\nLoaned by the The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY in 2023/24. Photo from the net.\n\nHellenized form of the Egyptian goddess, Isis: she was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire after the annexation of Egypt by Rome in 31 BCE.\n\nNorth Africa, however, became more and more marginal to the Byzantine empire after the arrival of Islam.\n\n——————\n\nMosaic of “Lady of Carthage”, marble, limestone, glass paste.\n\nTunisia, 4th-5th centuries, Carthage. Musee de Carthage Nationale\n\nFound in a village in Carthage, this figure of a woman in a pose of blessing, wearing a military tunic, is thought to represent the city herself.\n\nNUBIA\n\nMissionaries were sent by the Byzantine emperor, Justinian (482-565), and his wife, Theodora, to Nubia – part of today’s Sudan – to establish Christian communities.\n\nA Metal Crown, silver and gemstones. Nubia, Sudan, 5th-6th century\n\nBeaten silver covered with royal and divine insignia including those associated with Isis and Horus. Found at or near the royal cemetery at Qustul, Nubia\n\nFrom the 6th century onwards, 3 Nubian kingdoms gradually adopted Christianity. By the 8th century, Nubia had adopted Byzantine political language, art and culture.\n\nBridal chest, 4th-6th century, wood and ivory, Qustul, Nubia\n\n21 inlaid ivory panels, incised and filled with green and red wax paste. The motifs are mythological and of fertility and prosperity. The Egyptian goddess Bes is depicted. The ivory is thought to have been obtained from Ethiopia (Axum). The wood and metal are thought to be local.\n\nBetween the 12th and the 15th centuries, these kingdoms merged under the name ‘Dowato’. Throughout this time, the Nubian Church remained under the Patriarchate of Alexandria.\n\nIslam gradually replaced Christianity from the 8th century onwards.\n\nIn modern times, much of the former Christian areas of lower Nubia, including the site of a cathedral at Faras, were flooded by the construction of the Lake Nasser dam.\n\nMore than 100 Christian paintings, tempera on dry plaster, 8th to the 14th centuries, were found. The majority were removed to museums in Khartoum and Warsaw, Poland.\n\n————————–\n\nByzantine influences continued to surge and wane in north and north-east Africa from the 3rd century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nThereafter Byzantine artistic stylistic norms continued to be recalled in the sacred art of the area, adapted and transformed for local sympathies.\n\nAll of this to say that Coptic art absorbed and adapted diverse artistic norms: indigenous, late Roman pre-Christian, Jewish, Byzantine, Islamic.\n\nThe syncretic styles of religious art which resulted are of striking beauty and skilled workmanship.\n\nThis work continues to be made.\n\nIts value to adherents of the Church (Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea) is attested by the influential status of the Church among Orthodox Christians of these countries to this day.\n\n—————————–\n\nChristian art: Egypt and Nubia in chronological order\n\nWall Painting with Virgin and Child, Nubia.
