        "text": "On this Old Coptic Cairo tour, you will be given the opportunity to get to know the Coptic Quarter, an area of ​​the city characterized by being a melting pot of religions throughout history: Christians, Jews, Orthodox and Muslims have lived in this part of Cairo. Its monuments include the Hanging Church, built on the Fortress of Babylon; the Church of Saint Sergius, where the Holy Family is believed to have gone into exile in Egypt when they fled from Herod; or the Ben Ezra Synagogue, one of the oldest in the country dating from the 7th century.\n\nAfter picking you up at your hotel, we will go to the Coptic neighborhood of Cairo . During the journey we will learn about the history of the Christians of Egypt and we will discover the differences between Coptic Catholics and Coptic Orthodox. Both religious currents have their own temple, which we will visit on our tour.\n\nFirst, we will enter the interior of the church of Santa María la Virgen, better known as “the hanging church of Cairo” because it was built on one of the old doors of the Babylon Fortress. Inside the temple, we will observe various works of art and their mosaics belonging to different historical periods.\n\nWe will continue the tour admiring the exterior architecture of the church of San Jorge. The temple, consecrated to the Coptic Orthodox cult, constitutes the seat of the Patriarchate of Alexandria. Nearby is the church of San Sergio. Inside we will see the sacred space where, according to tradition, the Holy Family took refuge during their flight from King Herod."
