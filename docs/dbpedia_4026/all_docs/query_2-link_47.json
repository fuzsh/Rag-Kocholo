Within the framework of its inter-religious dialogue mandate, EUCLID has designed a comprehensive and challenging online doctoral degree in Orthodox theology (PhD classification) which is presented here with full documentation of syllabus and faculty resources, as well as total tuition.\n\nThis comprehensive information will enable students globally to determine if this program is suitable for them.\n\nAcademic Presentation:\n\nNote: This degree program is distance-based only and requires fluency in the English language.\n\nRequirements for admission:\n\nApplicants must have a an advanced degree in theology issued by a recognized institution.\n\nGovernment-sponsored applicants (who are already government staff) may be admitted without the required educational credential if their level of education and experience is deemed sufficient. EUCLID may require these participants to complete bridge courses prior to enrolling in the program.\n\nFluency in English (spoken and written) is required and will be tested.\n\nStudents are expected to be in position to dedicate 10 to 15 effective hours of study on a weekly basis.\n\nProgram courses (\"roadmap\"):\n\nBased on the applicant's background and incoming credits, as well as intended specialization and thesis topic, a roadmap of courses will be created to meet EUCLID's academic standards and international guidelines.\n\nEUCLID Online Doctorate in Orthodox Theology courses (from EUCLID database):\n\nPRIMARY ASSOCIATED COURSES\n\nCode\n\nCourse Name\n\nUS Credits\n\n-ACA-401D International Academic Writing (Doctorate)\n\n3\n\n-TPH-499 Argumentation and Critical Thinking\n\n2\n\n-THE-333 The Canon of Scriptures\n\n3\n\n-THE-481 History of Development of Christian Doctrine\n\n4\n\n-THE-444 Temple Theology\n\n3\n\n-DEB-555 Comparative Christian Theology and Debates\n\n2\n\n-T-DTHESIS Doctoral Thesis / Dissertation\n\n25\n\n-T-DTH1 Doctoral Thesis 1/5\n\n5\n\n-T-DTH2 Doctoral Thesis 2/5\n\n5\n\n-T-DTH3 Doctoral Thesis 3/5\n\n5\n\n-T-DTH4 Doctoral Thesis 4/5\n\n5\n\n-T-DTH5 Doctoral Thesis 5/5\n\n5\n\nTotal Credit Hours (US):\n\n67\n\nElective Courses:\n\nSTANDARD DEGREE ROADMAP - ELECTIVES\n\nCode\n\nCourse Name\n\nUS Credits\n\n-EC-300 Early Church Studies\n\n2\n\n-LIT-501 Orthodox Liturgics\n\n3\n\n-ORTH-702 Orthodox Soteriology\n\n2\n\n-ORTH-705 Orthodox Liturgy Theology\n\n3\n\n-PAT-601 Patristics I (Early Church Fathers)\n\n3\n\n-PAT-602 Patristics II (Latter Church Fathers)\n\n3\n\n-PAT-603A Orthodox Ascetical Tradition\n\n2\n\n-PAT-603B Orthodox Ascetical Tradition\n\n1.5\n\n-THE-405 Comparative and Critical Theology: Saints and Images\n\n0.5\n\n-THE-436 Comparative and Critical Theology: Sola Scriptura (1)\n\n0.5\n\n-THE-446 Soteriology: The 'Salvation by Faith alone' debate\n\n0.5\n\n-THE-447 Scripture - Canon: The controversy on the OT canon\n\n0.5\n\n-THE-448 Ecclesiology: The Debate on the Roman Papacy\n\n0.5\n\n-THE-483 Early Christian Doctrines\n\n2\n\n-THE-484 The Orthodox Church\n\n3\n\n-THE-485 The Church at 325 (Eusebius: Church History)\n\n2\n\n-TPH-4477 Introduction to Greek Philosophy\n\n1\n\n-TREL-4680 Philosophy of Religion\n\n1\n\n-TREL-4680 Philosophy of Religion\n\n1\n\n-TREL-6100 Great World Religions, 2nd Edition: All 5 Religions (Set)\n\n3\n\n-TREL-6172 Comparative Religion\n\n3\n\n-TREL-647 Early Christianity: The Experience of the Divine\n\n1\n\n-TREL-653 Old Testament Background / Overview\n\n1\n\n-TREL-656 New Testament\n\n2\n\n-TREL-657 Apostle Paul\n\n1\n\n-TREL-6577 From Jesus to Constantine: A History of Early Christianity\n\n1\n\n-TREL-897 American Religious History\n\n2\n\n-TTH-367 World of Byzantium\n\n2\n\n-DOC-700 Writing the Doctoral Dissertation: A Systematic Approach\n\n0\n\n-DOC-701 How to Complete and Survive a Doctoral Dissertation\n\n0\n\n-THIS-8380 History of Russia: From Peter the Great to Gorbachev\n\n1.5\n\n-TPHI-4453 Natural Law and Human Nature\n\n1.5\n\nFor more information:"
