        "text": "Pope Francis, on a trip to Egypt, has visited a church where 29 people died in a suicide bombing in December.\n\nHe attended a service at St Peter and St Paul church in the capital Cairo with Coptic Christian leader Pope Tawadros II.\n\nThe Pope's visit comes at a time when Egypt's Copts are facing an increased threat from extremist groups.\n\nJust three weeks ago, suicide bombers struck two other Coptic churches, killing a further 45 people.\n\nPope Francis had earlier urged an end to the funding of groups that promote violence, an act which could not be committed in the name of God, he said.\n\nDuring a speech at al-Azhar University, a key centre of Sunni Islamic learning, which aimed to improving Christian-Muslim dialogue, the pontiff said religious leaders were \"duty-bound\" to unmask such violence.\n\nHe also condemned the \"rise of demagogic forms of populism\", adding it was essential\" to \"block the flow of money and weapons\" bound for those who promote violence \"which purports to be carried out in the name of the sacred\".\n\nThe recent rise of populism, he said, was detrimental to worldwide peace and stability.\n\n\"It is disconcerting to note that, as the concrete realities of people's lives are increasingly ignored in favour of obscure machinations, demagogic forms of populism are on the rise,\" the pontiff said.\n\nBefore the 27-hour visit - the first papal trip to Cairo in 20 years - he said he was travelling as a \"messenger of peace\".\n\nThe visit came as the Egyptian branch of so-called Islamic State (IS) put Christians under increased threat, describing them as its \"favourite prey\".\n\nIn a message ahead of the trip, Francis said he wanted the visit to be \"a witness of my affection, comfort and encouragement for all the Christians of the Middle East\" and \"a message of brotherhood and reconciliation with all the children of Abraham, particularly the Muslim world\".\n\nA three-month state of emergency is in place in the wake of the Palm Sunday bombings, and security has been boosted around churches.\n\nBut many Copts say the government should have done more to protect them, and say they are also under pressure from sectarian tensions and long-standing discrimination.\n\nMore about the Coptic Orthodox Church"
