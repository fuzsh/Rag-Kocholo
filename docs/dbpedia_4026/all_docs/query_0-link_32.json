Serge\n\nPosted By: StuartK Re: Heretical Patriarch declared a Saint - 11:46 AM\n\nIt is more than ironic that the Church of Jerusalem has chosen to glorify a person whose Confession was condemned at a synod held in that very city, Before he was Ecumenical Patriarch, Lukaris was Patriarch of Jerusalem. I'm not very familiar with what he did during his tenure, but perhaps there is some act that the Church of Jerusalem considers worthy of sainthood. The news release gives no rationale for his elevation. There has long been a school of thought (fostered by the Orthodox themselves) that the Loukaris Confession was a forgery--but I don't know of any scholars today who support that position. If the Church of Jerusalem thinks Cyril Lukaris has been traduced by history, it should just say so and take its lumps.\n\nLukaris' Confession was quite blatantly and seriously in error, and the Orthodox Church's rejection of it at Jerusalem was unambiguous. Moreover, in its place it adopted a rigorously Orthodox confession of faith by Patriarch Dositheus, just so there would be no mistake as to what the Orthodox Church believed and professed.\n\nBut one has to feel some sympathy for the admittedly devious and oleagenous Cyril. He was Ecumenical Patriarch, I believe, no fewer than six times (the last being fatal), and he bought and bribed his way to the top of a Church in which, as Runciman quotes, \"everyone and everything was for sale\". Orthodoxy in the early 16th century was in a serious crisis. The Church of Constantinople was decadent, there were no schools, no seminaries, no books, and no real intellectual ferment, such as was going on in the West. Russia was only little better off than Greece, pressed from the West by Catholics and Protestants alike, and still facing threats from Tatars and Turks to the east and south. Loukaris thought that the Reformation offered a counterpoise to an aggressive Latin Catholicism, as well as an intellectual framework that could revitalize Orthodoxy. He was, of course, dead wrong (as the later exchange of letters between Patriarch Jeremias II and the Tubingen divines would show), but we should at least be sympathetic to his situation and his motivation. He was a desperate man in desperate times.\n\nPosted By: Anthony Re: Heretical Patriarch declared a Saint - 05:05 PM\n\nAlexandria glorified him, not Jerusalem, if I read the article correctly.\n\nPosted By: StuartK Re: Heretical Patriarch declared a Saint - 05:39 PM\n\nYou are right. Substitute Alexandria for Jerusalem. Cyril was Patriarch in Alexandria before he was Patriarch in Constantinople. What he did for Alexandria, I don't know. They must have liked him, as a home-town boy. As I said, when the Confession was published (in Zurich, of all places), quite a few Orthodox claimed it was a forgery. That didn't stop the Synod of Jerusalem (I got that part right!) from condemning it as Cyril's work. But others, perhaps including Alexandria, must have accepted the story of a forgery (though why someone in Zurich would forge such a document, I don't know).\n\nPosted By: Alice Re: Heretical Patriarch declared a Saint - 06:42 PM\n\nA friend and former poster, Dr. Alex Roman, sent this to my private email. I am assuming he would like me to post it for your interest:\n\nThe Myth of the \"Calvinist Patriarch\"\n\nby Archbishop Chrysostomos of Etna\n\nWebmaster's Note: The Orthodox Christian Information Center asked Archbishop Chrysostomos, the Academic Director for the Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, to review the comments made by a Protestant publication called Credenda Agenda in their articles \"Confessio Fidei\" and \"The Reformation that Failed\" (by Chris Schlect; see Vol. 6, No. 5). His Eminence graciously replied and made a number of comments about the issues at hand, excerpts from which are presented in a condensed and selected form below. This is the first of numerous forthcoming installments responding to the articles in Credenda Agenda.\n\nJust as today one must see the Orthodox world in its greater historical context, so in Patriarch Kyrillos’ day, too, Orthodoxy existed in a world of political reality that must be carefully studied, in order to see what implications rise above his specific witness and faithfully address Orthodoxy at a general level. To this end, let me just say, as a general observation, that with the fall of Constantinople the Orthodox East fell under Latin domination and the Turkish Yoke. Its survival threatened, its spiritual and intellectual primacy relinquished to the West, Orthodoxy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries took on an historical character that cannot be applied universally to the Church’s experience and ethos, and especially, again, without careful examination and precision.\n\nToo much scholarship today comes from secondary and from encyclopedic sources, offered up by inadequate scholars who ignore primary sources and who, in the field of Orthodox studies, fail to capture the thinking of the Fathers. For example, the political intrigue surrounding the reign of Patriarch Kyrillos is very complex. It involves theological and political issues dating back to the time of his mentor and (most probably) relative, Patriarch Meletis (Pegas) of Alexandria, and to Loukaris’ strong opposition to the Latin Church and the Unia, an opposition that brought him into conflict with certain circles (both in Alexandria and in Constantinople) which had primarily political reasons for their sympathy with Rome. To reduce these complicated factors to some supposed opposition within the Orthodox Church to Patriarch Kyrill’s so-called Protestantism is absurd. Such a faulty reduction also creates a myth about the Patriarch that is to a great extent a fabrication of Western scholarship and of those Orthodox captured by the West. It also ignores the standard historiographical assumptions of Orthodox Greek writers, who have a far more expansive knowledge of Orthodoxy in the age in question than their Western counterparts. In this vein, it is rather amazing that one of these articles in Credenda tries to make something of the fact that the Patriarch’s \"Confessio fidei...\" was published in Geneva. Could we imagine it being published in post-Byzantine Constantinople? Anyone with even an elementary knowledge of intellectual life of the Greeks at this time would readily understand why men of Greek letters published throughout the West, and especially in Italy and France. It is astonishingly naive for anyone to attach to the publication of Loukaris’ confession in Geneva any special significance at all. The notion that these particular writings were \"composed\" by Loukaris in Latin is another troubling statement. It needs careful scrutiny and actually says nothing to support the thesis that Loukaris had, by implication, a keen appreciation and knowledge of Western (Reformed) theology. It leads us, rather, in another direction, as we shall see.\n\nWhile he knew Latin, it is clear from his many letters and writings, as well as from biographical data from contemporaries of his, that Patriarch Kyrillos could not have produced a polished text such as that of the original Latin \"Confession.\" Indeed, many Greek scholars even dispute the claim that the Greek text, which appeared together with the Latin text four years later, was the work of Loukaris. Rather, it is argued by most Greek scholars that the text was essentially the work of Calvinist scholars with whom Cyril communicated on a regular basis and who condensed many of his letters and exchanges into a conveniently Calvinistic confession that ignored the Patriarch’s Orthodox understanding and grasp of reformed theology. For a brilliant textual analysis in support of these assumptions, see Professor Ioannis Karmiris, Orthodoxia kai Protestantismos (Athens, 1937). (Cf. Chrysostomos Papadopoulos, Kyrillos Loukaris [Athens, 1938].)\n\nIt is only by ignoring his many sober theological works and writings, wholly in concord with traditional Orthodox theological concepts, and his synodal confessions and justifications, that one can argue that Patriarch Kyrillos was a supporter of Calvinism. The whole idea of a \"Protestant\" Patriarch who was forced to betray his Protestant leanings is a bit of Western fancy that the Reformers used to slap at Rome (beset as it was by the \"problem\" of the Eastern Church only a few centuries after having, however fruitlessly, \"united\" with it, a \"problem\" which the Lutheran Reformers had also exploited at the Diet of Worms). This fanciful idea was also one that the Latins used in their struggles against Loukaris, on account of his many years of opposition to the Unia and the Jesuits in Eastern Europe, characterizing him as a betrayer of his own Faith. (Remember that the Latins had a deep hatred for this Patriarch. Through the machinations of the Jesuits and other anti-Orthodox agents in Constantinople, the Papists were finally able, through the Austrian Embassy, to bribe the Turks to condemn and kill Patriarch Kyrillos in 1638, and thus to silence him. His body was, indeed, unceremoniously thrown into the Bosporos.)\n\nLet us also say that the Orthodox Church, which in Her mind constitutes the successor of the very Church established by Christ, has a theology and spiritual life quite foreign to those of the West, whether Latin or Reformed. Soteriology, the sacraments (or, more properly, the Mysteries), and Christian anthropology and cosmology, however misunderstood and misrepresented by the West (we think, here, of the gross stupidity of Western scholars who imagine our theological traditions to be neo-Platonic—an accusation which shows an ignorance both of Orthodoxy and of Neo-Platonism), are concepts that we discuss in a context and with nomenclature foreign to the Papists and Protestants. When addressing Roman Catholics, our Church has, however, spoken about seven sacraments and about various administrative structures in Western language (though, in fact, our Mysteries are without number and order always yields to prophecy in Orthodoxy); speaking with Protestants, we have spoken of the interaction of Faith and good works and of Divine Providence and Grace in ways that they understand (when, in fact, the first distinction is unknown to us and the apophatic and Hesychastic traditions of Orthodox theology approach the second issue in a way largely mystifying to Western theologians). Admittedly, less-gifted Orthodox thinkers today also seek to form a \"systematic theology\" in response to the West (notwithstanding the fact that it is in the realm of spiritual practice, not confessional theology, that any notion of the systematic properly applies in Orthodoxy). But all of this does not mean that we are speaking the language of the heterodox in our hearts, let alone that we share their theological precepts.\n\nWhen we address Westerners on their own terms, we are reaching out to them in the limited language that they grasp. Setting aside the issue of the authenticity of his confession, when Loukaris reached out to the Protestants, then, whatever his motives and whatever his language, his writings, his witness, and his Orthodoxy were in no way compromised by these actions. Nor did he become that which he addressed. I leave it to others to judge the wisdom of his actions. But to characterize them in any way than that which I have is to argue, once more, against all that one can glean from studying his life and reading his writings as a whole. If the modernist Orthodox can make \"Popes\" of their Patriarchs and create a melange of Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and Papism that they pass off as \"official\" and \"canonical\" Orthodoxy, Protestants sectarians can make of Patriarch Cyril a Protestant. But these creations do not change the truth. Both in the case of modern Orthodoxy (which has created its own religion from the language of mission by which Orthodoxy has been preached in the West) and a phantom \"Protestant\" Patriarch, we are dealing with false creations of theological nomenclature that are separated from true experience.\n\nDespite Western references to Patriarch Kyrillos’ wide contacts with the Reformers, he is in fact most famous in the Orthodox world for his anti-Papist stand against the Uniate menace and for his opposition to Jesuit missions in Eastern Europe. His contacts in Eastern Europe, where he studied, served, and traveled, were extensive. His opposition to Uniate Catholicism after the Brzeesc-Litewski Treaty of 1596 was so strong and widespread, that his so-called \"Confession,\" whatever its true source, is a mere footnote to his struggle against Papism. It was THIS anti-Latin Loukaris who supported Protestant opposition to Papism, who perhaps allowed his views to be restated and published by his Calvinist contacts in Geneva, and who earned the enduring hatred of the Papacy, which has played an essential role—if one reads the intellectual history surrounding this issue—in perpetuating the idea that the \"Confessio\" was the direct work of Kyrillos and that he was a Protestant in his thinking. If one ignores almost all of his scholarship and accepts the \"Confessio,\" and if one ignores almost all of his activities and accomplishments in Eastern Europe and in resisting Uniatism, then it might be argued that Loukaris was the author of an Orthodox \"reform\" that almost was. But this fantasy, so favored by Protestants and so boldly bequeathed to them by Latin polemicists, is much like modernist Orthodoxy in America. It has the press. It has attention. It can dismiss arguments against it as those of fringe elements and cultists. But just as a thorough study of those who hold forth as Orthodoxy’s \"official\" spokesmen today show these people to be something other than what they are, so with a careful study of the facts surrounding the \"Confessio fidei\" of Kyrillos Loukaris the myth of a \"Protestant\" Patriarch goes the way of Pope Joan.\n\nfrom www.orthodoxinfo.com [orthodoxinfo.com]\n\nPosted By: Alice Re: Heretical Patriarch declared a Saint - 06:43 PM\n\nDr. Roman also sent me this from the website of the Ecumenical Patriarch:\n\nCyril I Lucaris\n\nThe entire life of the Patriarch Cyril I Lucaris is characterized by ceaseless activity and constant concern for the integrity and safety of the Orthodox Church.\n\nCyril Lucaris was born in 1572 in Heraclion, Crete, and had the chance to be a pupil of Meletius Vlastos, the learned monk who taught at the School of the Sinaitic Metochion of St. Catherine's Monastery.

He completed his studies in Venice (1584-1588) and later enrolled as a student in the University of Padova (1589-1593).\n\nIn 1593, at the age of 21, he was ordained deacon and, later, presbyter by the celebrated Patriarch of Alexandria Meletios Pegas (1549-1601), who perceived the young man's qualities and encouraged him in many ways.\n\nCyril's association with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and, particularly, with the great Patriarch Jeremias II Tranos gave him the opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the problems facing the Orthodox Churches. Later, he travelled throughout SW Russia, especially the Ukraine, to boost the morale of the Orthodox and strengthen their resistance against the proselytizing propaganda of the Uniates.\n\nIn 1601, at the age of 30, Cyril was elected to the Patriarchal throne of Alexandria, succeeding Meletios Pegas. As Patriarch of Alexandria (1601-1620), he re-organised the Patriarchate's finances, repaired churches, devoted time to preaching and kept a running correspondence with the Churches of Jerusalem, Cyprus and SW Russia. In 1612 he acted as locum tenens of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for a short period. But all the time, the problems created by the Uniate Church in SW Russia and Constantinople were among his main concerns. In an attempt to normalise the relations between the other Churches and the Patriarchates of the East, he made contacts with the Church of England and his efforts were readily supported by the English and Dutch Ambassadors to the Porte. Later, this policy was continued with the Calvinist divines of Geneva. Among the results of these inter-Christian approaches was the invitation of young Greeks to study in England. One of them was a youth from Macedonia, Metrophanes Critopoulos, who became, later, Patriarch of Alexandria (1589-1639). Cyril presented King James I with a very fine manuscript of the Holy Bible, known as Codex Alexandrinus, and sent a valuable manuscript of the Pentateuch, with Arabic translation, to Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nOn 4 November 1620, the Holy Synod of Constantinople elected «Cyril Lucaris, renowned for his virtue and wisdom», Ecumenical Patriarch. From 1620 to 1638 Cyril reigned five times (1620-23, 1623-33, 1633-34, 1634-35, 1637-38), and found himself at the centre of the acrimonious dispute between the Papacy and the Reformists, while the Churches of the East, especially that of Constantinople, experienced the stifling and infuriating propaganda of the Jesuits.\n\nState diplomacy took an active part in the conflicting actions and counteractions of the Jesuits and the Reformists. France and Austria offered their services to Rome, where the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide was organizing a scheme against Cyril. Part of the plan was to discredit the Patriarch with the clergy and laity by spreading the rumour that he was a Calvinist. At the same time, the Ambassadors of France and Austria were pressing the Porte to depose Cyril.\n\nIndeed, Cyril was deposed five times and each time he was re-elected to the Patriarchal throne by the clergy, with the support of the Orthodox population. Anglicans and Protestants (the English, Dutch, Germans, Swedes) also supported the return of Cyril to their own advantage. In the swirl of conflicting political and religious rivalries and the resulting dangerous climate, Cyril Lucaris tried to steer a course that, in his opinion, would serve best the interests of the Orthodox Church. He was fully aware of the critical state of affairs and of the pervasive influence of the Jesuits. He wrote: They (the Jesuits) «seek our destruction and the ruin of the Patriarchate and of the entire Church of the Greeks».\n\nThe Calvinists, from their side, used political influence, diplomacy, money and every other means to win the Patriarchate and the Orthodox Church over to their views. Cornelius Van Haag, the Dutch Ambassador, made use of all his influence in this unrelenting struggle, assisted by the Calvinist divine Antoine Leger. The latter, through theological discussions, fiery sermons and friendly approaches eventually swayed the Patriarch's entourage, which included Nathaniel Conopios, Metropolitan of Smyrna, Meletios Pontogalos, Metropolitan of Ephesus, Theophilos Corydalleus, Metropolitan of Arta, and John Caryophyllos.\n\nAt about that time, the Calvinists of Geneva arranged to print and publish the Holy Bible translated into modern Greek by Maximos Callipolitis. Cyril found himself obligated to sanction Callipolitis's translation, though it contained Calvinist views that could cause confusion to the common people. This confusion became chaotic when, in 1629, the Calvinists of Geneva published the first Latin edition of the so-called «Lucarian Confession», in which the Patriarch appeared to accept the Calvinist doctrines and betray the Orthodox faith. From 1629 to 1633 the «Eastern Confession of Christian Faith» was published under the name of Cyril Lucaris in Latin, Greek, French, German and English. J. Carmiris writes: «This inelegantly worded Confession roused great commotion and indescribable agitation throughout the Church and caused preoccupation not only to the ecclesiastical theologians but also to the politicians and the diplomats. In the beginning almost everyone believed it to be a forgery, not a true work of the Patriarch». More than 350 years have elapsed since the first publication of the so-called «Lucarian Confession». Eminent historians, theologians and researchers have tried to clarify whether Lucaris was the actual author of the «Confession» attributed to him by the Calvinists. The Patriarch himself verbally denied it on several occasions and proclaimed his Orthodox faith with his attitude and in his letters. To the end, however, Cyril did not disavow the «Confession» in writing. Successive Synods of the Orthodox Church have condemned the «Confession» as heretical and alien to the Orthodox faith of the Fathers.\n\nThe tragic figure of Cyril Lucaris stood in the midst of opposing religious currents. On the one side the Protestants tried hard to win over the Orthodox in their struggle against the Roman Catholics, going so far as to involve the Patriarch himself with the «Lucarian Confession» in order to promulgate their novel doctrines. On the other side the machinations of the Jesuits reached unheard of extremes. The Ecumenical Patriarch, alone, unprotected and betrayed, was judged and condemned. On 27 June 1638, he was strangled and his body was flung into the Bosporus. Manuel Gedeon writes that after some time «the sea out of compassion for this outstanding champion of Orthodoxy washed ashore his body on the island of Chalki». Cyril's body was buried with all honours by the Patriarch Parthenius I (1639-1644) in the precinct of the historical monastery of Panagia Kamariotissa on Chalki.\n\nIn the course of his difficult patriarchy «the much famed and very wise» Cyril Lucaris issued a large number of decrees on many ecclesiastical matters. A few of the synodical resolutions, patriarchal decisions and sigils are noted below:\n\n1. A synodical resolution in July 1622 canonized St. Gerasimos of Cephalonia.\n\n2. A special patriarchal encyclic appealed to all the Orthodox to make donations for the rebuilding of the monastery of Simonopetra, Mount Athos, which had been destroyed by fire.\n\n3. In 1627, Cyril set up a patriarchal printing-press for the publication of Orthodox works that\n\nwould invigorate the faith of the sorely tried Orthodox world.\n\n4. Cyril appointed as Director of the famous Patriarchal Academy «Theophyllos Corydalleus, celebrated erudite and expounder of Aristotle's writings».\n\n5. In 1628, Cyril instituted the dating of patriarchal documents from the Birth of Christ and not from the Creation of the World, as was the practice until then.\n\n[author: Athanasios Paliouras, translation: Helen Zigada]"
