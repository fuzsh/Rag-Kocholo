        "text": "Orthodoxy was a theme of King Charles of England’s Christmas speech to his nation and world. Orthodoxy in Africa Archimandrite Chrysostom Onyekakeyah of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa, Rev. Giorgi Tskitishirli of St. Vladimir’s Orthodox Seminary in Yonkers, New York performed the liturgy on the “Sunday of Orthodoxy” with presbyter Rev. Andrew Cadieux of the Transfiguration Church. The priests conducted the liturgy and Greek, English, Nigerian and Georgian languages. An interest in Orthodoxy is widespread for many reasons.\n\nA friend gave me information on the Coptic monastery of the Virgin Mary at Al-Muharrag in Qosqam. Ancient sanctuaries were not only places of worship, but a physical location that had been consecrated by notable acts od holiness or sacrifice. Biblical scholar and attorney Dr. Jeannie Constantinou said in her podcast The Massacre of the Innocents and Flight to Egypt said “The gospel does not tell us where Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus lived in him Egypt.\n\nThey went there for at least two years. The Coptic church has a tradition of where Jesus and Mary lived. I encourage all to visit these places because there are churches built on these sites. The memory of these place is kept alive. The Bible is a historical document written in the living memory of persons. They are all original, first-generation sources and not likely invented. The stories were written by persons who knew and most likely as historical sources.”1\n\nOur family friend, whose identity is anonymous, gave us information and souvenirs of the Coptic monastery of the Virgin Mary at Al-Muharrag. It lies on the path of the flight of the Holy Family in Egypt, south of Cairo. It is not located in the desert. They left Egypt when Joseph in a dream was informed by an angel “”Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead which sought the young child’s life”. (Matthew 2:20 & 21).\n\nAs Christianity spread in Egypt, from the preaching by saying more of the hospital and evangelists, churches were built throughout its land. Among many the very same house with the holy family lived, as confirmed from Coptic tradition, led later became the church dedicated to the name of the holy Virgin Mary.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Virgin Mary (al-Adra), which lies next to the square tower, is the oldest church in the monastery and is believed to date to the first century AD. The Church of St. George was built in the 19th century in place of an older one that dated from the 18th century. The most notable characteristic is of this church is its two high steeples and Byzantine/Greek styled Iconostases. The library of the monastery is divided into two main sections: modern books and reference material dating from the 19th and 20th centuries of religion, science Coptic, Greek, Arabic, English and Amharic and hand-written manuscripts in Coptic and Arabic dating back to 13th century.2\n\nThe Coptic icon art is not only a religious art. It is an authentic popular art that expresses the feelings of the people. In spite of terrible persecution, Coptic art is positive. It expresses joyful life filled with victorious spirit and power of soul prevailing of innocents, love, and the kindness and purity of soul. The icons in the iconostasis attracts the person to eternal glory.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Virgin Mary (known as St. George Church) became the destination of visitors through the generations. The needy and the sick found shelter and. Each year multitudes of pilgrims from every district continued to visit the monastery, as the location is well known for its science, wonders, and healing of many diseases.3\n\nWarren Treadgold in his article “The Persistence of Byzantium” says “Ever since a population exchange in 1923 removed most of the Greeks from Turkey, few people have spoken Greek outside Greece and Cyprus. Yet a patriarch of Constantinople remains in Turkish Istanbul as head of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eastern Orthodoxy remains the majority faith not only in Greece and Cyprus but in Russia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and Belarus. Eastern Orthodox Christians remain significant minorities in Albania, Syria, and Lebanon–and in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Most Armenians and many Egyptians and Ethiopians remain Eastern Christians without formally belonging to Eastern Orthodoxy. All of these groups have inherited much of their culture from Byzantium. It is mainly people who are not Eastern Christians whom Byzantium still perplexes.”4 In 2023, Eastern Orthodoxy is entering the consciousness od Western leaders, scholars and general public.\n\nThis is in Memory of our friend of the Coptic faith who recently passed away, who we remember.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/searchthescriptureslive/the_massacre_of_the_innocents_and_flight_to_egypt\n\nalmuharraqmonastery.com/en/\n\nGuidebook “The Monastery of Virgin Mary at Al-Muharraq,” pp.13-14.\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/40260386\n\nPhotos:\n\nPhoto 1 – Archimandrite Chrysostom Onyekakeyah of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa,(right) conducting liturgy with Rev.

Dr. Abraham Malkhasyan, pastor of the Armenian Church of the Holy Martyrs in Bayside, New York, participated in a Greek Orthodox service recently. Father Abraham has a unique operatic voice that touched all in his Armenian Benediction.\n\nI experienced a moving moment when we traveled to Dadivank monastery in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, before the devastating Azerbaijan war in October-November 2020. A charismatic priest, Father Abraham Malkhasyan, invited me to join his pilgrimage to Armenia recently with the Holy Martyrs Church under the leadership of President Aram Ciamician in coordination with the Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR ).\n\nIn Artsakh, we traveled to Dadivank, a monastery of incredible beauty in a scenic gorge. It was being restored. Poor Kurds, struggling to exist, lived in it, destroying its mosaics through heating sources. This monastery’s restoration will rewrite our perception of Armenian Orthodox monasteries. The numerous monasteries we visited did not have mosaics or iconography as in Greece, Russia, or Italy.\n\nRestoration of the 1214 fresco of St. Stephen was being conducted in the Katoghike Church that was used as stables during the communist regime. “The Enthronement of St. Nicholas” and restoration of the St. Stephen frescoes are beautiful. Father Abraham had a religious service in Katoghike Cathedral. He chanted Armenian hymns, blessing the souls of all martyrs with traditional Armenian religious chanting.\n\nThe St. Nicholas fresco in St. Mary Mother Church of Katoghike was explained in detail by a monastery sign. It was erected in the year 1214 by the Queen Arzou of Haterk. The interior walls of the Memorial Cathedral are richly decorated with frescoes. Part of a large inscription in Armenian, which covers the entire entrance wall of the Cathedral reads: “I, Arzou-Khatoun, obedient servant of Christ … wife of King Vakhtang, ruler of Haterk and all Upper Khachen, with great hopes built this holy cathedral on the place where my husband and sons rest in peace … My first-born Asan martyred for his Christian faith in the war against the Turks, and, three years later, my younger son Grigor also joined Christ … Completed in the year 663 of the Armenian calendar.”\n\n“The Enthronement of St. Nicholas” fresco amazed me. St. Nicholas was an exact replica of Byzantine icons, with fair features in religious Roman garments. Jesus is passing the bible to St. Nicholas. The Archangel Michael and Virgin Mary are seen watching the enthronement. Some fragments of the frescoes were painted in crimson red (vordan karmir) color. According to the inscription, they were made in 1297.1\n\n“Warren Treadgold who wrote in “The Persistence of Byzantium,” in wilsonquarterly.com said “Ever since a population exchange in 1923 removed most of the Greeks from Turkey, few people have spoken Greek outside Greece and Cyprus. Yet a patriarch of Constantinople remains in Turkish Istanbul as head of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eastern Orthodoxy remains the majority faith not only in Greece and Cyprus but in Russia, Bulgaria, former Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and Belarus. Eastern Orthodox Christians remain significant minorities in Albania, Syria, and Lebanon–and in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Most Armenians and many Egyptians and Ethiopians remain Eastern Christians without formally belonging to Eastern Orthodoxy. All these groups have inherited much of their culture from Byzantium. It is people who are not Eastern Christians whom Byzantium still perplexes.”2\n\nFather Abraham is celebrating his 10th Anniversary of ministry at Holy Martyrs Apostolic Church. We experienced his unique Armenian chanting in a Greek Orthodox church. As Eastern Orthodox Christians of all nationalities and races we have a common bond rooted in the Greek-Roman Byzantine civilization.\n\nPhotos\n\nPhoto 1 – Rev.

Archimandrite Chrysostom Onyekakeyah of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa, Rev. Giorgi Tskitishirli of St. Vladimir’s Orthodox Seminary in Yonkers, New York performed the liturgy on the “Sunday of Orthodoxy” with presbyter Rev. Andrew Cadieux of the Transfiguration Church. The priests conducted the liturgy and Greek, English, Nigerian and Georgian languages.\n\nA two-year Memorial service was held for Gus (Konstantinos) Markotsis. A procession took place with the community holding icons in the church interior. The Sunday of Orthodoxy is the first Sunday of Great Lent. The dominant theme of this Sunday since 843 has been that of the victory of the icons. In that year the iconoclastic controversy, which had raged on and off since 726, was finally laid to rest, and icons and their veneration were restored on the first Sunday in Lent. Ever since, this Sunday has been commemorated as the “Triumph of Orthodoxy.”1\n\nFather Andrew held a unique family icon of several saints, which has only two copies in the world. The church gathered to aid the civilians of Ukraine. The war was on everyone’s mind. A Fasolada Lenten luncheon sponsored by the Philoptohos Ladies Society followed in the church hall. Archimandrite Chrysostom was the guest speaker. For more information on the many persons who worked for this exceptional event, contact the Transfiguration Church on Facebook or the church office at 631-298-9652.\n\nArchimandrite Chrysostom shared with this writer the life of Orthodox Christians in Nigeria, his country. “It is dangerous father going to church in Nigeria, because of internal, political conflict. My parents were farmers, who were Roman Catholics. I converted to Greek Orthodoxy. Nigerians are farmers who have 1 to 3 marriages with many children. They have up to twenty-one children who work 6 to 7 days, morning to night, forming. The children work the land. These are customs and traditions of the Nigerian people.”\n\n“I was a Catholic who became Orthodox<” he explained. “The Orthodox church does not attempt to change our culture, traditions in their image. Orthodoxy respects the customs and traditions of Nigerians. They recognized the children of the first to third marriages. The Greek Orthodox Church protects all children.” Archimandrite Chrysostom shared with us his book “Orthodoxy in Africa.” For more information, email awomission@yahoo.com.\n\nRev. Giorgi Tskitishirli is an immigrant from the former Soviet union Republic of Georgia. “I was in the 2008 Georgian war with Russia. My family just returned to Georgia,” he said. Father Giorgi drove Archimandrite Chrysostom from New York City for this special Lenten liturgy. In this time of international unrest, Orthodox priests of different nations joined hands to celebrate a Lenten liturgy.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. https://www.goarch.org/sunday-of-orthodoxy luncheon sponsored by the female “ladies society followed in the church hall.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/4mwbnqNsmAfPvEdt5 – album\n\nPhotos:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has a thousand-year history of strong political as well as spiritual influence over the inhabitants of the Russian state. After enduring the Soviet era as a state-controlled religious facade, the church quickly regained both membership and political influence in the early 1990s.1 Christmas falls on January 7, 2022 in the Gregorian calendar. The Russian Orthodox Church is one of the largest autocephalous, or ecclesiastically independent, Eastern Orthodox churches in the world. Its membership is estimated at more than 90 million.2\n\nSt. Nicholas is a beloved Russian saint. My Russian tour guide Irina, a mother of three sons, who I met in the autumn of 2015, emailed photos of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker Church in the village of NIKOLO-URYUPINO, Moscow region.\n\nThe church has an interesting history. In 1664-1665 Nikita Ivanovich Odoevsky built the stone church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, the authorship of which is attributed to a serf master Pavel Potekhin… In 1840 M. D. Bykovsky added the St. Nicholas Church with a bell tower; otherwise, it retains its original appearance to this day.3 Seeing Irina’s photos, I am experiencing the beauty of Russian Orthodox architecture and culture.\n\n“The church where I go is named after the Wonderworking and Unmercenary Saints Kosmas and Damian of Asia in Maroseika Str.,” said Irina Chetina, who emailed these photos and information from Moscow. “Our church life is very busy too. A lot of people attend services. In some churches (including my church) they do two liturgies on Sundays. Besides the services, churches organize many events for parishioners. In 2006 the priests of our church founded the orthodox center “Discovery of Belief”, Which includes Sunday school for children and enlightening courses for adults. They invite people for classical and church music concerts, lectures on Russian literature and history, meetings with interesting people etc. Now because of covid restrictions, they (churches) must eliminate the number of events or do them online.\n\nNevertheless in November they started a new course of lectures on liturgy. They are very popular, as people want to understand the main service in detail, learn about its historic development and traditions historic periods. This course is led by father Sergius, who baptized me and whom I follow.\n\nThis year father Sergius has organized two pilgrimage trips for parishioners of our church.\n\nI will send you some photos of the one which took place in beginning of Nov. We visited two old monasteries in Moscow suburbs. One is New Jerusalem monastery, founded by the Russian Patriarch Nicon in the 17c. Another is Savvino-Storojevsky monastery founded by St.Savva in the end of the 14c.” This is life in Russia during a time of pandemic. The churches are helping their parishioners rediscover their Russian Orthodox faith.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Russian-Orthodox-Church\n\nhttps://bnm.wiki/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE-%D0%A3%D1%80%D1%8E%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAthens Cathedral\n\nOn a pre-covid 19 summer day, I explored the deserted streets of the center of Athens. I passed though a typical urban center. Suddenly I came across an immaculate square with a statue of the last emperor of the Byzantine empire Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos. This was the only statue I saw of the last Byzantine emperor in a major Greek city. The architects and monarchy remembered their Byzantine roots. The second is a statue of Archbishop Damaskinos who was Archbishop of Athens during World War II and was Regent for King George II and Prime Minister of Greece in 1946. I was at the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Annunciation (Theotokou). The Cathedral was closed. But the statues. icons over the entrances and architecture gave an insight of the national importance.\n\nComposer Mikis Theodorakis, of Zorba fame, was given a public funeral at the Cathedral from September 6th-8th. The Metropolitan Cathedral remains a major landmark in Athens and the site of important ceremonies with national political figures present, as well as weddings and funerals of notable personalities.\n\nConstruction of the Cathedral began on Christmas Day, 1842 with the laying of the cornerstone by King Otto and Queen Amalia. Construction started under the architect Theophil Hansen and was continued by Dimitris Zezos, Panagis Kalkos and François Boulanger. Workers used marble from 72 demolished churches to build the Cathedral’s immense walls. On May 21, 1862, the completed Cathedral was dedicated to the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary (Ευαγγελισμός της Θεοτόκου) by the King and Queen. The three-aisled, domed basilica has inside the tombs of two saints killed by the Ottoman Turks during the Ottoman period: Saint Philothei and Patriarch Gregory V.\n\nThe month of September 2021 commemorates the 99th Anniversary of the “Burning of Smyrna” and end of the 3,000-year long presence of Greeks in Asia Minor. Metropolitan Chrysostomos Kalafatis of Smyrna, canonized as St. Chrysostomos for his death as a martyr, worked in the Cathedral. In an emotional speech, he spoke to the Cathedral community “the dawn of the resurrection of the whole Nation.”1 Like Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos, Metropolitan Chrysostomos did not desert his community, when the defeated Greek army retreated, leaving the civilians to the atrocities of an enraged Turkish militia. His torture and barbarous death are graphically recorded in September 2021 Greek media.2 The Western governments watched, did nothing, letting civilians exterminated. Private, non-government persons saved some of the survivors.\n\nWho was Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos the man? A point overlooked in general history is that the last emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Constantine Palaiologos, was half Serbian. His mother, Helena Dragas was daughter of the Serbian magnate Constantine Dragas. When he became emperor, he referred himself as Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos after his mother Helena. 2021 tennis champion Novak Djokovic gives an insight into the Serbian character. Novak Djokovic said “We have a harder way to succeed in life as Serbs because of the past that we had and because of the history we had…Before I am an athlete, I am an Orthodox Christian”\n\nByzantines had a multi-national character, like the USA, united by Greek language, culture, and Greek Orthodox faith. Emperor Constantine died in battle defending Constantinople. Following his death, he became a legendary figure in Greek folklore as the Marmaromenos Vasilias, the “Marble Emperor” who would awaken and recover the Empire and Constantinople from the Ottomans. His death marked the end of the Roman Empire that lasted 1100 years.3\n\nConstantine XI was the ablest, charismatic, and courageous of Byzantine emperor Manuel II’s sons. He was deeply conscious of Byzantium’s long and glorious history. He was determined to uphold its dignity. Constantin XI considered appeasement to be another form of treachery. The last Byzantine emperor would not be humiliated in the eventual destruction.\n\nAt 43 years old, he had spent half his life fighting the Turks. He knew his enemy well. He faced the Ottomans’ large cannons in his fight to save Athens. He lost and retreated. This was the age of the cannon. Unfortunately, he did not have the money to ire Urban , the Hungarian cannon maker. Urban went o Ottomans and created 2 huge cannons. Constantine XI knew Byzantium’s fate was sealed. Yet he fought on.4\n\nThe imperial ministers begged Constantine to flee and set up a government in exile until the city will be retaken. Exhausted but firm, Constantine refused. These were his people. The emperor would be with them to the end. His funeral oration at he last Greek Orthodox service in Hagia Sophia reminded his soldiers of their glorious history. “Animals may run from animals, but you are men,” he said. “You are Worthy heirs of the great heroes of ancient Greece and Rome.”5\n\nAt the end, from his position by the Saint Romanus Gate, Constantine knew all was lost. With the cry, “the city is lost, but I live, he flung off his imperial regalia and plunged in the breach wall, disappearing in history. Constantine XI’s body was not found. In death, if not in life, Constantine XI had eluded his oppressor’s grasp. Shocked and shattered Byzantines were now in permanent exile. But they could reflect their empire came to a glorious and heroic end.\n\nConstantine Dragases Palaiologos chose death over surrender or a diminishment o his ideals. He had found a common grave among the men he led. Proud and brave, the 88th emperor. Of Byzantium brought the empire full circle. Like the first (Constantine the Great) to rule in the city by the Bosphorus, he had been a son of Helena named Constantine, the founder of Constantinople. This is the factual Constantine Dragases Palaiologos that comes alive in Lars Bownworth unique masterpiece Lost To The West: The Forgotten Byzantine Empire That Rescued Western Civilization.6\n\nMikis Theodorakis image to this writer was negative. My outlook changed on Mach 16, 2018 at the 1.5 million Macedonian rally in Athens, sponsored by the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater N.Y., the Pan Macedonian Association of USA, and the Hellenic American Congress, regarding the opposition to any use of the word Macedonia in negotiations between the governments of Greece and FYROM (now North Macedonia). Dimitris Filippidis, Journalist/Hellas FM radio/President of the Pan Macedonian Association of USA, explained in broadcasts that the leftist faction visited Theodorakis to change his opinion. His home was destroyed by negative graffiti, all to persuade him not to attend the 2018 rally.\n\nTheodorakis went in a wheelchair through the crowds, to show he was a Greek patriot. A man of contradictions, Theodorakis demonstrated he was first a patriot and fought for Greece. I changed my outlook based on Mr. Filippidis positive representation of the composer who said his country came first. The Athens Metropolitan Cathedral of the Annunciation is a monument to the great men who are part of Greece’s history.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Cathedral_of_Athens\n\nhttps://greekreporter.com/2021/09/10/brutal-murder-of-metropolitan-chrysostomos-of-smyrna-still-haunts-greece/\n\nhttps://greekamericanexperience.wordpress.com/2020/03/23/on-the-road-in-the-dalmatian-coast-hotel-asimovic-trebinje-bosnia-herzegovina/\n\nBrownworth, Lars.

A story of faith describes the building of the Basilica of Santa Maria della Salute. Venice in 1630 had a plague that killed 1/3 of the 150,000 population. How did they deal with this catastrophe? The Venetians built a church dedicated to St. Mary of the Health or Santa Maria della Salute.\n\nDurant Imboden in simple language described how the “Venetian Senate made an offer to God: ‘Stop the plague, and we’ll build a church to honor the Virgin Mary.’…. Whatever the reason, the plague was stopped in its tracks. The Venetian authorities honored their promise by giving the Virgin a prime chunk of real estate near the tip of Dorsoduro, where the Grand Canal merged with St. Mark’s Basin.\n\nIn the resulting competition for a church design, the winner was an unknown architect named Baldassare Longhena, who had proposed a massive octagonal basilica that combined elements of Venetian Byzantine architecture with domes inspired by St. Peter’s in Rome. Longhena described his design as “strange, worthy, and beautiful…in the shape of a round ‘machine’ such as had never been seen or invented either in its whole or in part from any other church in the city. The resulting church wasn’t completed until half a century later, in 1682.”1 Byzantine civilization, even after its fall in 1453, continued to shape Europe.\n\nThe exterior shows statues of the four evangelists, St. George, and other saints. “The octagonal church, while ringed by a classic vocabulary, hearkens to Byzantine designs such as the Basilica of San Vitale…The Baroque high altar arrangement, designed by Longhena himself, shelters an iconic Byzantine Madonna and Child of the 12th or 13th century, known as Panagia Mesopantitissa in Greek[4] (“Madonna the mediator” or “Madonna the negotiator”) and came from Candia (Crete) in 1669 after the fall of the city to the Ottomans.”2\n\nCooler weather reduced the population of the plague-ridden fleas. The Venetians who lost 1/3 of their people believed its was their religious faith that saved them. We all enjoy seeing the Basilica of Santa Maria della Salute in person, television, and internet as an inspiration to all during the 2021 Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nReferences:\n\nAll photos by Despina Siolas, MD/Ph.D\n\nhttps://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/santa_maria_della_salute.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_della_Salute\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nVaccinated persons can go unmasked into premises without capacity limitations, except for social distancing.

The loucoumades stand is a magnet that attracts many who love this fried dessert dipped in honey. Preorders of food with the St. Nicholas Church application was used by many. Souvlaki and gyro were barbecued expertly for a very reasonable price. A 50/50 raffle was held each day. Vendors with hand crafted jewelry, publications, novelties, and non-profit organizations had booths. These independent booths are to be commended for their extraordinary effort to resume business under the new normal. Prominent political persons attended.

The 2021 Festival is a success.”\n\nIInternational scientist Andreas George investigated the existence of St. Nicholas “In The Footsteps Of St. Nicholas.” His scientific examination of sources and historical sites disproves the 1970’s action of the Vatican, demoting St. Nicholas as a major saint or characterization as a mythological figure. Mr. George says his goal is to “present reasonably, accurate historical information about his life. During my search for St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, who lived in the 3rd-4th centuries A.D., I tried to establish credibility in the face of conflicting information, distortion and exaggeration.”\n\nThe author visited places that influenced St. Nicholas’ character. His search through Greek documents in Byzantine Bari, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor and Cyprus reflects his scientific background for accuracy. He describes the evolution of St. Nicholas of Myra as Santa Claus, in its evolution in America, primarily in New York. His miracles are explained in detail. Relics of St. Nicholas were in several churches in New York. The customs, traditions, social and religious life of St. Nicholas Shrine Church in Flushing, New York are described in detail.\n\nThe life of St. Nicholas in Myra, modern Demre in Asia Minor, Turkey is not widely known. Mr. George describes his life in detail referring to many sources. His major source is Michael the Archimandrite of 842 A.D., Symeon the Translator, written five centuries after St. Nicholas’s death in 335 A.D. and others. The problem with his research, he admits is that it is not based on primary sources. There are no primary sources describing his personal life, only secondary sources centuries after St. Nicholas’ death. Alexander the Great’s life is based on the same secondary sources.\n\nSt. Nicholas’ ancestors were Greeks, descendants of Alexander the Great’s colonists or of Cretans. The author believes St. Nicholas’ ancestors were most likely from Crete, because of similar customs and traditions with the Greek island. Modern Greek sources on the Greek Cities of Asia Minor show that the Greek communities along the Asia Minor coast had up to 50 percent Cretans until the 1922 Catastrophe. Their dialect and customs were also like the Cretan culture. Mr. George’s research added information that St. Nicholas spent time in Cyprus through his visits to monasteries and study of Greek sources. His translations into English of these facts are invaluable to a serious reader.\n\nThe author explains that the lack of written information on St. Nicholas comes from the following historical events: suppression of information by Julius the Apostate; destruction of church documents by the 9th century Iconoclastic movement, the Crusaders, Moslems, Arab pirates, and the Protestant Reformation. The 11th and 12th chapters provide facts that will open the reader’s eyes on the real St. Nicholas of Myra. The author’s pilgrimage to Demre in Turkey (Ancient Myra) shows the rediscovery of the Christian homeland.\n\nI personally was fascinated by his portrayal of Bari, Italy as a Byzantine stronghold. In Modern Greek history books, the fall of Byzantine Bari to the Normans was a major catastrophe listed on every timeline. The relics of St. Nicholas were sent to Bari in the 11th century to save them from the Moslem invaders of Myra, Asia Minor. The history and the building of the Basilica of St. Nicholas of Bari give one a total view of this center of Byzantium in the west. The glory of Bari, unknown to many, makes chapter 6 and 7 of major interest to all whose ancestors were from this major trade center.\n\nWhat did St. Nicholas look like? Unknown to many, the author describes the reconstruction of the saint’s bones in the 1950’s by Anatomy Professor L. Martino of the University of Bari and two doctors. Their scientific investigation showed the bones were of a man 1.67 meters (about 5 feet and six inches) tall with a broad forehead and large sunken eyes. This description is like the facial characteristics in Byzantine icons. Professor Martino explained the bones belonged to a Mediterranean, more likely a Greek from Asia Minor. Mr. Andreas George is a scholar, having written scientific papers on radioactivity and radiation exposure. His background as a scientific investigator and author makes this one of the finest books written on St. Nicholas of Myra. The book is available at Seaburn, 3318 BroadwayAstoria, NY 11106, (718) 784-2224, www.seaburn.com. The 2021 St. Nicholas Shrine church Festival brings to life the meaning of St. Nicholas, beloved by all.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe birthplace of Eastern Christianity is ravaged and disappearing. It is time to realize the positive outcome of Eastern Orthodoxy in international communities. The transfiguration of Christ Greek Orthodox Church on Breakwater Rd., Mattituck, New York was my introduction to legendary work of iconographer George Filippakis of the Cretan School.\n\nWhat is the Cretan School of iconography? “an important school of icon painting, under the umbrella of post-Byzantine art,[1] which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements”1Byzantine art masterpieces are practically non-extent in the areas that composed the Byzantine Empire. I am lucky I went to Russia in 2015 before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMr. Filippakis is from the island of Crete. “When he was 11, he apprenticed with a Byzantine iconographer, Stylianos Kartakis, to paint some additional scenery for the church. ”That’s how I learned iconography,” he said.”2\n\nI feel comfort at the interior exit watching the wall icon of the Nativity. In Fall 2015, our guide Irina Chetina opened the “Legacy of Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire” to us through art and architecture in modern Russia. We went to the Tretyakov Gallery and saw the “Nativity of Jesus” by Andrei Rublev.3 Mr. Filippakis’ Nativity is classic Byzantine. Directly underneath are the Archangels Gabriel (messenger) and Michael (warrior). When I view these Archangels, the Christian message and fighting spirit is reinforced. They give the onlooker a feeling of protection.\n\nThe Transfiguration of Christ wall icon comes alive when we celebrate the church Feast Day on August 6th. Gazing at the Transfiguration continues to give me the meaning of transformation and metamorphosis of one’s life. The colors are impressive. Every space is fill with large wall icons such as: Baptism of Jesus Christ; Entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday; The Crucifixion; Resurrection; Ascension and Pentecost and other icons. Father Andreas Cardieux is the Theologian expert who can describe all to interested persons.\n\nWhat was the Byzantine Empire? It was a multi-ethnic, multi-racial society without Nationalism. Everyone was a Roman with a secular education of classics, math, science. The Greek/Roman civilization was based on Eastern Christian religion. It was termed Byzantine during Renaissance by a German scholar to show it was inferior to West. The Byzantine Empire is the only empire in history to last over 1100 years.\n\nThe survival of the culture of the successors of Alexander and of Rome must also be attributed to the unrecognized Hellenized Armenians. The Armenians embraced the Empire’s Greek language, culture and religion becoming Byzantines. They helped saved Western Civilization for over five hundred years as Emperors, military leaders, and soldiers, protecting Western Europe from barbarian invasions. They intermarried with Roman Byzantine Aristocracy. Armenians assimilated in a Christian melting pot.4\n\nWarren Treadgold who wrote in “The Persistence of Byzantium”, in wilsonquarterly.com said that “Byzantium is also a frustrating subject for those who adopt the modern view that all that matters, or has ever mattered, is race, class, and gender. Like other ancient and medieval peoples, the Byzantines had no idea of race in the modern sense, and to them black skin was like red hair, merely an uncommon physical characteristic. Practically all Byzantines, including their few slaves, were what we would call white. They may be called multiethnic in the sense that, along with the ethnically mixed people we call Greeks, they included Armenians, Slavs, Syrians, Egyptians, Albanians, and others…. Moreover, in a generation or two, the Armenians, Syrians, and others who migrated to Greek-speaking areas forgot their own languages, intermarried with Greeks, and became indistinguishable from them. Byzantium was far less a multicultural society than it was a melting pot.5\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Christian communities remember their roots. George Filippakis’ iconography elevates him to the great masters of Byzantine art. As we face a second season of Covid-19 pandemic, memories of his work at the Transfiguration of Christ Greek Orthodox Church, Mattituck, give me hope that our Eastern Orthodox Christianity will persevere and overcome all obstacles to survive in 2021.\n\nReferences:\n\nFor more information, contact Father Andreas Cardieux, who is bilingual Greek/English at https://www.facebook.com/TOCCMattituck, transgochurch@optimum.net and church office 631 298-9652.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_School\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/10/nyregion/a-touch-of-byzantine-art-finds-its-way-to-greenlawn.html\n\nhttps://greekamericanexperience.wordpress.com/2017/12/19/byzantine-nativity-icon-seen-throughout-holiday-season/\n\nhttps://greekamericanexperience.wordpress.com/2019/10/\n\nhttp://archive.wilsonquarterly.Photocom/essays/persistence-Byzantium- Persistence of Byzantium\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBrunelleschi’s Dome (Duomo) is a must see in Florence,” said our guides before the 2020 Covid 19 pandemic. It dominates the Florence skyline. Two geniuses, Filippo Brunelleschi, a founding father of Renaissance architecture, and Cosimo Medici the Elder, a Florence banker’s generosity, created a one of kind dome for the Florence Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. Brunelleschi and Cosimo Medici had one purpose: to glorify their Christian faith through a unique architectural dome. It helped launch the early Renaissance whose center was in Florence.\n\nA duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral where the bishop is located. Filippo Brunelleschi was chosen because he promised to build a dome without scaffolding. Cosimo Medici believed in him. He built two domes one nested inside the other, without scaffolding. Brunelleschi built the largest masonry dome in history. The dome showcased the wealth and glory of Florence.\n\nWe were impressed with Giorgio Vasari’s Last Judgement dome fresco painted by Federico Zuccari. The famous Duomo Clock is one of a kind, painted by Paolo Uccello. The oil painting of Niccolò da Tolentino shows the condottieri, or military leader, who fought to defend the Florentine Republic. The religious mosaic under the clock reminded me of Byzantine iconography. Spacious with Gothic arches, the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore is the architectural achievement of the Renaissance.\n\nI was amazed how one Banker saved Greek classics. Our 2020 generation knows very little of the Renaissance, because it is not part of the politically correct curriculum. The European Union influenced the revision of Greece’s 6th grade education book eliminating aspects of their history. Cosimo Medici the Elder’s dedication and generosity expanded humanism, making Florence the leader of the rebirth of the study of the Greek classics in the early Renaissance of the 15th century. He was fascinated by the philosophy of Plato. Reliable manuscripts of Plato became available in Western Europe during Cosimo’s lifetime.They were brought from Constantinople by Greek Orthodox churchmen and Byzantine scholars, whose city was under the increasing threat from the Turks.1\n\nThe Council of Florence is not widely known by general public. It was the final attempt by the Byzantine Empire to unite with the West by union of the churches. It happened in Florence from 1438-39, because of the richest man in Europe, Cosimo Medici. He paid for all expenses. Cosimo wanted Florence to have the prestige of the end of the Schism of the East and Western churches. Also, the Council offered possibilities of new business deals.2 “The empire was not known as Byzantine,” said scholar Father Nicola Madaro. “It was the Roman Empire. There was only one Roman Emperor acknowledged in the West. He was not called the Byzantine Emperor. He was treated with great respect in Florence.”3\n\nThe Greek party of 700 officials, scholars, theologians, and interpreters was led by the Patriarch of Constantinople and Emperor John VII Paleologos. The emperor wanted military aid against the Ottoman Turks through this religious unity. The Florentines were mesmerized by Byzantine culture. Unity took place, but was not accepted by the people of Constantinople. The West had no interest in saving Constantinople. It fell. What is unsaid is understood. Cosimo and his friends were inspired by Plato. He had an ambition to read all Plato’s works towards the end of his life. He paid for scholar Marsilio Ficino to translate Plato into Latin. In 1462, Medici established the Platonic Academy in his Villa Careggi. His library was open to his friends to study. Plato gradually recovered a leading role in philosophy, because of the generosity and interest of a Banker.\n\nBrunelleschi’s dome and the early Renaissance spearheaded by Cosimo Medici was and is remarkable. Cosimo the Elder’s purpose is best describes in his words: “All those things [meaning works of art] have given me the greatest satisfaction and contentment because they are not only for the honor of God but are likewise for my own remembrance. For fifty years, I have done nothing else but earn money and spend money; and it became clear that spending money gives me greater pleasure than earning it”\n\nReferences:\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://greekamericanexperience.wordpress.com/2017/12/09/following-byzantine-footsteps-interview-with-father-nicola-madaro/\n\nhttps://study.com/academy/lesson/cosimo-demedici-of-florence-biography-lesson-quiz.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi\n\nhttps://study.com/academy/lesson/the-duomo-cathedral-of-florence-architecture-history-facts.html\n\nPhoto 6 – Niccolò da Tolentino the condottieri, or military leader.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
