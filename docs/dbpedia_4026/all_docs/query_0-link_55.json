The\n\nprimate of the world’s largest and most influential Orthodox Church\n\nbegan his trip with the See of St. Mark and will finish it in Damascus,\n\nSyria. The news was quickly circulated in the parish, and preparations\n\nfor the great spiritual event soon began in both Alexandria and Cairo.\n\nPatriarch Kirill and Patriarch Theodore II officiated the Divine\n\nLiturgy in the Patriarchal Cathedral, in Alexandria. Priests from Cairo,\n\npreceded by Archimandrite Elias Habib, went to Alexandria to share the\n\nAlexandrian parishioners in this historical event.\n\nI believe that the joyous reaction and celebratory atmosphere can be\n\nexplained in the light of two important factors. Firstly, the\n\nhistorically strong ties between the two patriarchates. Secondly, the\n\nsignificant prestige of the Patriarch of Moscow as a prominent\n\nspiritual figure in the Orthodox world.\n\nIn the last two decades, the Russian Orthodox Church has developed\n\nits spiritual role and contribution in the Middle East. A great\n\nCathedral of Saint Nicolas was built in the United Arab Emirates and a\n\nrenewal of activities in Jerusalem can be clearly witnessed, which has\n\ngiven financial and spiritual support to the Antiochian Christians.\n\nToday, we also find missionaries in Africa supporting the Alexandrian\n\nPatriarchate’s efforts in this poor and often neglected part of the\n\nworld.\n\nHistorically, we – Alexandrians – know how the Russian Church helped\n\nin the restoration of Orthodox Churches and the Patriarchal Library. The\n\ncurrent Patriarch of Alexandria, Theodore II, was the Exarch of the\n\nAlexandrian See in Moscow. He speaks Russian fluently, and even prays in\n\nRussian sometimes. He was among the attendants in the ordination of\n\nPatriarch Kirill and officiated with him his first Liturgy after\n\nordination, at Christ the Savior Cathedral.\n\nAs further indication of the strong relationship, Patriarch Kirill\n\nwill present bells cast in Russia, made especially for St. George\n\npatriarchal monastery in Cairo. This can be seen as an indication of a\n\npromising future of cooperation on the pastoral and institutional level\n\nas well.\n\nAs an Alexandrian Orthodox Christian, I look forward to seeing\n\nPatriarch Kirill’s first visit to the Patriarchate of Alexandria as a\n\ncontinuance of cooperation and contribution of the Russian Church. The\n\nChurch in Egypt needs support in its projects and development. Poverty\n\nand social difficulties are the main challenge facing the Church. The\n\nmissionaries in Africa need support from all the Christendom, to help\n\nthem in their message of preaching the good news and bringing the divine\n\nlight to those who live in difficult conditions in the poorest\n\ncontinent.\n\nOn the spiritual level, there is an increasing interest in the\n\nRussian spiritual fathers’ legacy. The Middle East Orthodox today are\n\nworking on translating and producing studies on the Russian fathers and\n\nsaints. In Egypt, the Holy Archangels Orthodox Church has published\n\nvarious translations of modern Russian fathers’ famous works. The\n\nwritings of Bulgakov, Alexander Schmemann and Florovsky are gradually\n\nbecoming known to Arab speaking Orthodox faithful. I believe that\n\nthere’s a duty of the Russian Church today to present and lead more\n\ncommunication activities between the Alexandrian and Russian Christians,\n\nincluding illuminating the Russian spiritual experience for today’s\n\nOrthodox Christians of the Middle East."
