        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 309\n\nYes, the native language is used in the chanting from what I can tell. I only listened very briefly to this, and it reminds me more of African Roman Catholicism than Orthodoxy from the musical angle, but this is my first impression, listening to only a few seconds of it.\n\nI believe the true spirit of Alexandria is Coptic, not Hellenic. I use the Ethiopians as the template for any future evangelization in Africa. I am not a fan of the Roman Catholic spirit on that continent, (particularly its NO flavor; regardless I'm not much a fan of the once Tridentine Africa, either. [I know a charming middle-aged lady from Senegal who goes TLM] In retrospect the Roman Church only seems to fit a little in such African countries because of their interaction with the colonlizing Europeans), especially given how its relations with the indigenous culture and pagan religious customs can run the risk of being an experiment (sometimes dangerous) more than a non-heterodox healthy, embracing between the Church and the culture, such as the case is in Ethiopia.\n\nIf there is any missionary activity to be done, the Coptic spirit of Alexandria is required, with the Ethiopians as the perfect example of true Coptic African Christianity (I'm nauseated by NO Latin Africans going on about their \"African Christianity\" lunacy or their bogus \"African spirit\". If you want genuine African Christianity and spirit, head to what the Rastfarians call the promised land and see it for yourself) Ethiopia is the proper example of African Christianity and spirituality, not the artificial RC kind that sometimes entails an unhealthy contamination of religion by paganism at the level of freak experimentation, and in my opinion not the Hellenic kind either.\n\nThe Syriacs and Copts eventually became Byzantized, and the Byzantine patrimony is a great treasure. However, I find consolation in the presence of the Churches in the Middle East that truly exhibit the spirit of the Churches of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch. Dr. John has mentioned the Constantinopolitan family ceaselessly, and indeed we Melkites and Antiochian Orthodox are, no doubt so spiritually to an extent, but above all we are Antiochian, and were the non-Chalcedonian Churches not present today, and I had to choose between the existance of Byzantine Churches, or those adhering to the Alexandrian, Antiochian, and Jerusalemite liturgical traditions, in those lands under those three territorial jurisdictions, I would choose the latter. From a historical perspective, I wish that those three Churches that accepted Chalcedon never underwent Byzantization and remained identical in rite to their non-Chalcedonian counterparts. In the context of the present, I fully accept the existance of both rites, the Byzantine and the native, in those territories. However, if it came to what would be considered the respective \"traditional territories and lands\" of evangelization for these three jurisdictions, I would not be in favor of the Byzantine ritual traditions spreading as their presence was a result of Constantinople's influence over the three Chalcedonian Patriarchates. Instead I would wish the proper ritual traditions of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria to spread in the missionary territories of these three Churches. I don't like the thought of Byzantine or Latin Christianity spreading in Africa. Coptic and Ethiopian Christianity is the kind of model for Africa I have in mind. That would be one BIG Church. And Mor, sorry my friend, but it would HAVE to be Chalcedonian also. ;-)\n\nIn IC XC\n\nSamer\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 1,698\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by SamB:\n\nAnd Mor, sorry my friend, but it would HAVE to be Chalcedonian also. ;-)\n\nIn IC XC\n\nSamer\n\nAww, Samer, here I was all happy with everything you wrote, and then you had to throw a wrench in the thing. :p\n\nSeriously, though, our theology and your theology are virtually the same...you guys just have your way of teaching it, and we have our way, and both ways make sense to our respective traditions, but to mix and match probably wouldn't. So why we'd have to be \"Chalcedonian\" is beyond me.\n\nIf we recognise that Chalcedonian theology is completely Orthodox (and I think all the Oriental Orthodox Churches agree on that point...I know at least the Syrians and the Armenians agree), and if most Chalcedonians (I know at least the Catholics feel this way) accept our theology as Orthodox, then why do we need to change our theology to suit all those of the Byzantine tradition who say we need to be Chalcedonian? We might as well add the Filioque in the Creed too, or latinise or byzantinise our liturgical rites.\n\nWith all due respect, my brother, my friend, I must disagree. I still love ya though!"
